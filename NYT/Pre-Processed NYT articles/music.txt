sometimes whale want change tune 
one thing researcher learned recently eavesdropping whale several part world listening change pattern pitch together new study suggest whale whistling water constantly evolving form communication beginning understand 
whale dolphin vocalize dolphin toothed whale mostly make clicking whistling sound humpback possibly bowhead sing complex song repeated pattern said michael noad associate professor cetacean ecology acoustic laboratory university queensland australia 
bird may broadcast social hierarchy among song sharing population allowing dominant bird pick playlist pattern whale pas song fragment across hundred mile thousand animal far mysterious 
biggest question whale sing 
thing always get bed morning function song dr noad said find humpback song fascinating point view evolved 
leading hypothesis male humpback male sing trying attract female may also switch tune another male nearby apparently ass rival size fitness said dr noad senior author one four new paper whale song 
humpback musical pattern tend complex whale also bit murky dr noad suggested development may result called runaway selection 
early humpback complex song much successful mating gained substantial evolutionary advantage brother simpler vocalization led large sometimes noisy animal 
julien bonnel associate scientist wood hole oceanographic institution massachusetts said growing research also show importance collecting data many year offering insight whale ocean condition affect specie 
technology recording whale gotten much cheaper last dozen year making accessible researcher computer program analyze huge data set quickly helped interpret year recording 
tagging whale without hurting produced data dr noad noted tag remain whale hour limiting information collected 
one new study led scientist new york based wildlife conservation society researcher tracked humpback singing along east west coast africa comparing song sung coast gabon near madagascar 
study published journal royal society open science confirmed two population interact noting overlap vocalization researcher recorded song annually using hand held hydrophones aboard boat 
male humpback whale within population tend sing song type continuously changing evolving time said melinda rekdahl study first author marine conservation scientist wildlife society thought one best example cultural evolution animal kingdom 
dr rekdahl boat collected sound new study know firsthand amazing experience said 
sound nearby singer resonates hull boat singer close hear song getting fainter whale surface nearby recalled 
singer close added often sit hour recording hearing song headphone see whale anywhere 
dr rekdahl based new study data collected thought recording offered best opportunity compare song similarity neighboring population 
idea using song look population mixing connectivity relatively new said proven valuable last year 
animal repeat sound others sing aberrant tune juvenile may hum jingle altogether different adult humpback also alter tune time 
one reason might novelty nearby female swimming whale male singing song would drive crazy dr rekdahl said maybe female like give new song 
two additional recent study examined song change seasonally across year 
one paper jenny allen doctoral student dr noad found unexpected pattern among humpback song reach certain level complexity humpback drop tune entirely pick new simpler one study first quantify complexity song published proceeding royal society b biological science 
clear oscillating pattern something really expect said dr allen postdoctoral researcher university queensland lecturer griffith university australia 
assuming song meant attract female might brand new song bit sexier continuing sing complicated version old song said hard memorize whole new song simplifying make easy learn much new material 
humpback song lot repeating pattern might make easier remember rhyme end poetry line aid memorization dr allen said also found lot predictability pattern compared pop song based four chord 
another new paper researcher university brest france found pitch antarctic blue whale pygmy blue whale fin whale vocalization fell various recording site southern indian ocean 
whale anatomy louder call higher pitch quieter one lower essentially whale gotten slightly quieter said emmanuelle leroy research fellow university new south wale author new research 
blue whale mostly solitary communicate across large distance need produce really low frequency high intensity call said call really loud propagate hundred kilometer 
team two hypothesis explain drop pitch across year population rebounding since end commercial whaling perhaps whale need call carry far heard others 
like science time page facebook sign science time newsletter 
perhaps ocean acidifying climate change call naturally carrying farther allowing whale reduce volume team believe change pitch tied directly human activity 
research published journal geophysical research ocean also showed call pitch antarctic blue whale varies across season pitch increasing hertz spring summer dropping time 
might whale response loud cleaving iceberg spring summer extremely loud sound like cracking ice glass make harder whale hear one another crank volume dr leroy said 
dr noad think overall drop pitch could reflection aging population older whale making deeper sound 
contrary scientist also belief whale hear human made noise quite distance way people urban environment hear distant rumble traffic even car passing directly 
humpback whale made really nice comeback since commercial whaling largely stopped dr noad said unknown reason blue fin whale still struggling thousand antarctic blue whale remain 
yet another new study related whale song researcher wood hole found short finned pilot whale living coast hawaii vocal dialect suggesting different group purposely avoiding one another 
relatively little known specie behavior new research provides better sense social tie whale group could promote understanding genetic diversity evolution well conservation researcher said

austin tex among techie attended annual south southwest interactive conference past day hottest topic conversation besides swarm drunken idiot careening around austin rented electric scooter senator elizabeth warren ground shaking proposal break large tech company like amazon google facebook 
proposal released eve conference m warren argued company abused power harmed competition two big way 
first offering product platform control amazon giving preferential treatment house brand apple promoting apps inside io app store m warren massachusetts democrat presidential candidate argues company required one sell good run third party marketplace 
umpire team said umpire one team game 
m warren also argues acquiring potential competitor facebook acquisition instagram whatsapp large tech company made harder smaller start ups compete fair term proposes appointing regulator would undo merger break conglomerate 
regulating big tech quickly becoming central theme presidential race senator amy klobuchar minnesota senator bernie sander vermont others also talked need rein tech giant m warren demonstrated technology literacy elected official 
many tech industry insider spoke austin including agree m warren big company powerful cautioned detail proposal vague could backfire put effect written 
m warren plan bold first stab reform proposal make lot sense offer edits 
apply specific fix specific problem one shortcoming m warren plan understandable one given campaign proposal final set rule proposes broad solution narrow problem 
lawmaker typically craft regulation individual company good reason law specifically targeted amazon competitor would seen creating unfair double standard 
instead m warren proposal target technology company billion annual revenue operate third party marketplace group includes apple amazon facebook google proposes set rule apply well company meet threshold future microsoft make billion annual revenue third party marketplace form window app store somehow spared 
problem applying one size fit four model tech industry analyst ben thompson written large tech company different business model pose different anti competitive risk stranglehold google facebook digital advertising market different way amazon muscle e commerce brand different way apple us app store force burdensome term developer 
possibility unintended consequence mean tailoring regulation address problem important law banned amazon competing third party seller platform could also cripple chromebook laptop prevent iphone user getting access itunes library 
rather one giant package crams everything together set effective tech regulation would treat problem discretely address surgical precision 
split cloud business m warren proposes big tech company split significant chunk business like separating google ad operation search engine mention one clearest example oligopolistic behavior tech industry cloud computing 
right much internet powered infrastructure owned small number giant tech company include amazon microsoft google company make killing renting data storage computing power essential service business essentially selling pick shovel digital gold rush 
cloud computing market may seem like obvious antitrust target highly competitive year price war giant driven cost service giving young start ups ability rent world class infrastructure make easier harder compete 
yes concentration critical infrastructure among company also operates enormous consumer internet business give company enormous power invite anti competitive abuse 
example let imagine jeff bezos amazon chief executive decided sabotage netflix run amazon web service amazon cloud computing unit order help company streaming video service could theoretically tell amazon web service team slow netflix traffic analyze usage pattern determine netflix show amazon streaming video team copy 
clear mr bezos extremely unlikely given would scandalous violation amazon privacy policy would cost company lucrative customer reality company dominant internet service also provide infrastructure power much consumer internet clear example kind market consolidation m warren trying address 
effective breakup proposal could require company like amazon google microsoft spin cloud computing division stand alone business manner similar one m warren proposed breaking e commerce marketplace adapt baseball analogy tech company would either play team stadium 
get rid app tax another easy specific fix would stop apple google maker two dominant mobile operating system taking unfair advantage mobile app developer 
moment company want sell app purchase subscription io app must pay software developer derisively call apple tax fee percent apple skim top app purchase subscription bought user google mobile app store charge similar fee 
fee add quickly removed app subscription last year netflix paying apple estimated day privilege selling subscription app competitor begun complain platform strict developer policy amount bullying wednesday spotify filed complaint european commission apple app store policy arguing unfairly stifle competition 
apple google would argue fee justified operating app store requires hiring reviewer security team kind expense company monopoly control mobile universe used power set virtual tollbooth suck billion dollar year pocket smaller competitor 
get lured censorship debate something bizarre happened monday facebook momentarily took several m warren facebook ad promoting proposal break big tech m warren seized episode saying proof facebook ability shut debate power 
ad quickly reinstated facebook made clear removal case politically motivated censorship company longstanding policy limit use facebook name ad measure mostly meant prevent sketchy advertiser claiming falsely facebook official quiz game whatever 
idea facebook would censor one prominent critic irresistible politician including senator ted cruz republican texas conservative lawmaker spent past several year complaining social medium platform engaging partisan censorship 
right big tech way much power silence free speech mr cruz wrote m warren message twitter 
one problem debate tech company power risk conflating real anti competitive behavior like facebook shutting data access competitor imaginary abuse like mr cruz unsupported claim social medium platform biased conservative former real menace latter bad faith attempt work ref preserve partisan advantage political discourse framed proof need neutral platform 
best advice could possibly give m warren democrat hoping bring big tech heel focus squarely competition avoid sucked partisan debate content censorship 
worst outcome push regulate big tech company would set rule made easier people exploit company power leaving fortress intact
