year michigan born rocker james osterberg better known stage persona iggy pop earned reputation godfather punk thanks mostly tenure frontman proto punk band stooge also reckless sui generis stage presence embodied gleeful slightly scary abandon became synonymous genre 
presence loom punk four part documentary series fashion politics musical influence defined punk rock debuted week epix 
osterberg credited iggy pop executive producer series along fashion designer john varvatos might raise eyebrow given varvatos put would say final nail punk coffin buying cbgb hallowed punk club bowery replacing one boutique 
phone interview osterberg defended varvatos also discussed sex pistol drug favorite music critic edited excerpt conversation 
punk original form nothing iconoclastic feel critic fan musician call godfather punk 
get reverence bother 
yeah 
initially mind called godfather punk suppose grown suit occasional personal feeling come one one interaction someone let know something genuine role work played life type music still enjoying vitality social influence people carry style figure produce style becomes academic really imperceptible step 
even country music hell big stretch going hank williams garth brook buddy process change happens genre rock roll sort took beating basically irrelevant got mined death whatever anybody want call called worse thing godfather punk 
said sex pistol honest fan always told fan trusted 
said always thought honest remember applauding anybody saying trust much impressed onstage ability whether swindled thousand dollar manager malcolm mclaren care mean mclaren effective barnum type showman know fine 
group whole lot flair johnny lydon good thing supposed good front group guitarist steve jones really good foil johnny especially came publicity everybody contributed something musically term image group 
punk death sex pistol bassist sid vicious girlfriend nancy spungen presented example drug essentially killed punk movement 
lot stuff around music business experienced punky type hard stuff always price paid lsd marijuana stuff pushed taking drug way breaking barrier people need hold together barrier broken also get insight life world around especially grown milk fed american lamb slaughter told vietnam ask 
cocaine came next seemed like good drug weed lsd anymore people getting speed cocaine upscale stimulant effect kept party going eventually people nerve shot patience worn thin many turned opioid drug well valium soporific subtle dangerous drug 
book critic either music punk music think especially valuable 
lester bang nick kent two people think top head sort flailing wild highly subjective way least two treating write like actually important 
read stuff lester bang wrote thought buffoon wait salient blowtorch nihilism cool wait cool sure one book hardback long long time sitting shelf along andy warhol diary collected work allen ginsberg book look spine think important 
punk talk work without retrospectively judging kind question asked make feel 
knew worked john varvatos accepted interview fairly basic responsibility come listed executive producer love genuinely interested music saw one store book greatest rock album something time modeling picking free swag book thoughtful work soulful commerce would say knew show interview question going coming like would inevitably question like became junkie sort thing 
whereas critic concerned arcanum pure art going different question case listen question try answer inasmuch respected try insert something nothing question get lick try twist thing little bit point view 
would say people remain outraged cbgb turned varvatos boutique 
would say people think happened cbgb man something room conducive range musical approach centered kind detail oriented reference oriented intellectually tinted art rock like talking head many aspect ramones stylized many way blondie though obvious blondie lead singer debbie harry seemed learn sing nowhere know could done without club could learning 
patti smith group obviously even though think piss factory recorded nightingale little dive bar smaller cbgb kept sawdust floor people going puke pee spit right also playing cbgb could develop room small particular way 
fresh year pop music come hope new sound new idea new style new artist leading charge make field even wild expansive already

maren morris broke country music rule major label debut album hero vivid indictment country dull masculinist norm wit creativity punch ambition 
might expect thing nashville made morris moderately successful country music clogged dullish gentleman last year morris recorded genre promising music good handful hit cheeky rich desperate could use love song howling church tartly underscored ideologically robust rest genre 
took sidestepping country altogether morris get something like due middle chunky electro pop stomper zedd grey became biggest maren morris hit hot grammy nominated also one least specific talent 
see zedd maren morris year old songwriter turned chord middle 
perhaps vagueness ooze throughout scattershot new album girl attributable success best song hero disarmingly detailed sometimes funny girl however tip away strength favor self help bromide broad enough exclude one 
time girl morris seek wide open territory many song aim universal big tent feel make lighthearted looking love fun great one favor abstract image detail perfect storm let pour good woman shade feel distant even flavor oriented around female empowerment veers toward bland yeah lady make dough play victim fit mold 
middle revealed morris voice natural home beyond country music fair debut album showed versatile vocal approach capable delivering aspirational pop novel country also impressive shade voice thin brittle cut variety production style easily 
many forceful vocal performance girl far country music like tempo soul number rsvp tweak could easily make sense say monica sza one finest moment bone nod chainsmokers daya hit let feature album sturdiest songwriting 
morris lean country music past lightly echo dolly parton chipper anthem favorite people feature brother osborne singing arched eyebrow performing hee haw sketch disruptive way pay homage 
favorite people one detailed song album also one echo theme morris nod weed smoking assertion love love kacey musgraves morris contemporary peer jolting country music center occasional drug reference grammy album year winner even luke bryan slipping note tolerance song gesture feel le urgent seemed audacious year ago pro forma 
way hero demonstrated comfortable morris coloring outside country music line girl instead indicates well morris might fill pre existing boundary one downside moving goal post move well

old town road original remix mean first country rap crossover collaboration across genre line like nelly tim mcgraw song country singer rap like jason aldean dirt road anthem blake shelton boy round performance fully genre flexible like sam hunt take time

track also arrived fortuitous moment heel trickle western aesthetic high style universe last couple year also following success stylistically diverse country performer like kacey musgraves demonstrated country musician beacon cool far outside genre wall even kanye west recently took countryside unveiling last album wyoming cowboy ranch 
another moment aesthetic choice old town road might perceived pure kitsch kitsch side tastemaker though removal song country chart reflected initial resentment mood soon switched country singer said found old town road country country enough want wrong side cool

sometimes whale want change tune 
one thing researcher learned recently eavesdropping whale several part world listening change pattern pitch together new study suggest whale whistling water constantly evolving form communication beginning understand 
whale dolphin vocalize dolphin toothed whale mostly make clicking whistling sound humpback possibly bowhead sing complex song repeated pattern said michael noad associate professor cetacean ecology acoustic laboratory university queensland australia 
bird may broadcast social hierarchy among song sharing population allowing dominant bird pick playlist pattern whale pas song fragment across hundred mile thousand animal far mysterious 
biggest question whale sing 
thing always get bed morning function song noad said find humpback song fascinating point view evolved 
leading hypothesis male humpback male sing trying attract female may also switch tune another male nearby apparently ass rival size fitness said noad senior author one four new paper whale song 
humpback musical pattern tend complex whale also bit murky noad suggested development may result called runaway selection 
early humpback complex song much successful mating gained substantial evolutionary advantage brother simpler vocalization led large sometimes noisy animal 
julien bonnel associate scientist wood hole oceanographic institution massachusetts said growing research also show importance collecting data many year offering insight whale ocean condition affect specie 
technology recording whale gotten much cheaper last dozen year making accessible researcher computer program analyze huge data set quickly helped interpret year recording 
tagging whale without hurting produced data noad noted tag remain whale hour limiting information collected 
one new study led scientist new york based wildlife conservation society researcher tracked humpback singing along east west coast africa comparing song sung coast gabon near madagascar 
study published journal royal society open science confirmed two population interact noting overlap vocalization researcher recorded song annually using hand held hydrophones aboard boat 
male humpback whale within population tend sing song type continuously changing evolving time said melinda rekdahl study first author marine conservation scientist wildlife society thought one best example cultural evolution animal kingdom 
rekdahl boat collected sound new study know firsthand amazing experience said 
sound nearby singer resonates hull boat singer close hear song getting fainter whale surface nearby recalled 
singer close added often sit hour recording hearing song headphone see whale anywhere 
rekdahl based new study data collected thought recording offered best opportunity compare song similarity neighboring population 
idea using song look population mixing connectivity relatively new said proven valuable last year 
animal repeat sound others sing aberrant tune juvenile may hum jingle altogether different adult humpback also alter tune time 
one reason might novelty nearby female swimming whale male singing song would drive crazy rekdahl said maybe female like give new song 
two additional recent study examined song change seasonally across year 
one paper jenny allen doctoral student noad found unexpected pattern among humpback song reach certain level complexity humpback drop tune entirely pick new simpler one study first quantify complexity song published proceeding royal society biological science 
clear oscillating pattern something really expect said allen postdoctoral researcher university queensland lecturer griffith university australia 
assuming song meant attract female might brand new song bit sexier continuing sing complicated version old song said hard memorize whole new song simplifying make easy learn much new material 
humpback song lot repeating pattern might make easier remember rhyme end poetry line aid memorization allen said also found lot predictability pattern compared pop song based four chord 
another new paper researcher university brest france found pitch antarctic blue whale pygmy blue whale fin whale vocalization fell various recording site southern indian ocean 
whale anatomy louder call higher pitch quieter one lower essentially whale gotten slightly quieter said emmanuelle leroy research fellow university new south wale author new research 
blue whale mostly solitary communicate across large distance need produce really low frequency high intensity call said call really loud propagate hundred kilometer 
team two hypothesis explain drop pitch across year population rebounding since end commercial whaling perhaps whale need call carry far heard others 
like science time page facebook sign science time newsletter 
perhaps ocean acidifying climate change call naturally carrying farther allowing whale reduce volume team believe change pitch tied directly human activity 
research published journal geophysical research ocean also showed call pitch antarctic blue whale varies across season pitch increasing hertz spring summer dropping time 
might whale response loud cleaving iceberg spring summer extremely loud sound like cracking ice glass make harder whale hear one another crank volume leroy said 
noad think overall drop pitch could reflection aging population older whale making deeper sound 
contrary scientist also belief whale hear human made noise quite distance way people urban environment hear distant rumble traffic even car passing directly 
humpback whale made really nice comeback since commercial whaling largely stopped noad said unknown reason blue fin whale still struggling thousand antarctic blue whale remain 
yet another new study related whale song researcher wood hole found short finned pilot whale living coast hawaii vocal dialect suggesting different group purposely avoiding one another 
relatively little known specie behavior new research provides better sense social tie whale group could promote understanding genetic diversity evolution well conservation researcher said
