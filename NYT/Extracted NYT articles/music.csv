Here’s a lovely profile of the composer George Crumb, who is getting a little festival from the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center on Sunday and Tuesday as he approaches his 90th birthday this fall.  Corinna went out to his home studio in Pennsylvania, and we pulled together some highlights from a rich career of wondrous sounds: Here’s “Black Angels,” inspired by the Vietnam War and written for amplified string quartet, complete: And here’s the much-loved “Vox Balaenae”: In other news! A crazy story out of Hungary: When the Hungarian State Opera’s white cast of singers came together in Budapest earlier this month to revive a production of George Gershwin’s opera “Porgy and Bess,” they received letters carrying an unusual request: to declare themselves African-American.  Jaap van Zweden, the New York Philharmonic’s music director, burned himself while icing himself last week — I know, I know — so Simone Young jumped into this weekend’s performances of Mahler’s Sixth. Josh opines that her extensive work in opera may have informed her approach.

ZACHARY WOOLFE As the Miller Theater at Columbia University begins to wrap up its 30th-anniversary season — a Composer Portrait concert featuring David T. Little’s music comes next, on Thursday — I’ve been thinking about some of the best concerts I’ve heard there in recent years.  One particularly fine show was in October 2007, when the composer David Sanford conducted his own big band ensemble, the Pittsburgh Collective. Both raucous and exquisitely poised, the music was decked out with some broadly perceptible reference points — including traces of classical modernism, jazz improvisation and the attack of punk. Yet it was the composer’s way of combining these surface-level traits that proved most memorable.  While Mr. Sanford’s music is not heard in New York nearly enough, a taste of his more recent work is available, thanks to a set on the Boston Modern Orchestra Project’s label. The 11-minute work that gives the album its title, “Black Noise,” is a 2017 piece commissioned by the orchestra, known as BMOP.  Less immediately boisterous than some of what Mr. Sanford has written for his own band, “Black Noise” lavishes time on an investigation of spectral trends in contemporary classical harmony. In his liner notes, Mr. Sanford cites composer Fausto Romitelli as an influence, as well as the “harmonic world” of Pierre Boulez. Boulez’s “Notations” for orchestra don’t feel all that far away at points. But other of Mr. Sanford’s stylistic predilections also push themselves to the fore, including a frenzied section in the middle, which is helped along at first by authoritative, pizzicato bass lines, suggestive of Mr. Sanford’s appreciation for Charles Mingus.

These images came to my mind on Sunday in an unlikely setting: at Corpus Christi Church in Manhattan, during a choral concert by the ensemble Blue Heron that was part of the series Music Before 1800. That’s because this beguiling program of expressive and richly ornate polyphonic works from the English Renaissance constituted an encounter with survivors of a much older cultural cataclysm. Under the title “The Lost Music of Canterbury,” Blue Heron presented works drawn from a collection of manuscripts called the Peterhouse Partbooks, named after the University of Cambridge college where they are kept. These offer the single most important window into English music of the 1530s and ’40s. Like other forms of English culture nurtured by Catholic institutions, much of this music came to be lost in the upheaval that followed Henry VIII’s dissolution of the monasteries. Libraries were destroyed, and books, torn of their precious bindings, were sold off in bulk. A blizzard of manuscript paper came to be used — as one contemporary, using an old term for privies, described it — “to serve theyr jakes, some to scoure candelstyckes, and some to rubbe their bootes.” The works performed by Blue Heron escaped such ignominies because a chorister from Magdalene College, Oxford, copied them out for use in the newly reconstituted Canterbury Cathedral. They eventually made their way to the library of Peterhouse, where they survived yet another wave of destruction — that wrought by the Puritans in the 1640s. Preserved inside the partbooks are pieces by well-known composers, like John Taverner. Some works are what scholars call unica — meaning they don’t exist in any other source. In some cases, they stem from the pen of a musician who left no other trace at all. For instance, virtually nothing is known about Arthur Chamberlayne, the composer of a spirited setting of the “Hail Mary.” In Blue Heron’s fresh and full-bodied reading, single words — “Jesus” and “salve” (“hail”) — popped out like bright speech bubbles amid a thicket of arabesque counterpoint. As Scott Metcalfe, the ensemble’s director, said in remarks from the stage, that single antiphon constitutes the complete works of Chamberlayne. But Blue Heron’s devotion to this repertory — the ensemble has recorded five albums of music from the Peterhouse Partbooks — is not justified only by its rarity. This is vivid and radiant music. That it can be heard again at all is because of the dogged commitment of Nick Sandon, a British musicologist who spent four decades reconstructing the scores. (The book containing the tenor voice of these five-part compositions is missing, as are a few pages of the treble’s.) With two or three singers to a part and women stepping into the shoes of boy choristers, Blue Heron brings a zesty and sensual sound to these works of devotional music. Nicholas Ludford’s “Salve Regina” is a joyous tangle of long, florid lines with the occasional tangy dissonance illuminating a single word. Hugh Aston’s “O baptista vates Christi” is a rhythmically buoyant work full of forward-driving energy and elegant harmonies. To Mr. Sandon, quoted in a program note, the partbooks have become “a reminder of the catastrophe that English music suffered in the late 1540s and early 1550s, when a very highly developed, confident and ambitious musical culture and the infrastructure that sustained it were brought to an end virtually overnight, and most of its works and much other evidence of its activity were deliberatively destroyed.” Scholars will have to decide how much English music history needs to be adjusted to account for the wealth of discoveries embedded in these lone survivors. To a lay listener, the feeling that most resonates is one of vindication, tinged with melancholy. "
5c82bdba49f0eacbf105c1cc,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/arts/music/classical-music-youtube.html,"[Read all of our classical music coverage here.] Readers! The big news this week was the premieres — both on Thursday — of new piano concertos by Thomas Adès and John Adams.  Josh Barone spoke with the composers beforehand: And David Allen and I were there — in Boston for the Adès and in Los Angeles for the Adams — to review: I was also in L.A. earlier this week for the premiere of Bryce Dessner’s wan meditation on Robert Mapplethorpe, “Triptych (Eyes of One on Another).” Josh covered a new concerto for Yo-Yo Ma and Wu Man at the New York Philharmonic. Seth Colter Walls was wowed by Roscoe Mitchell at the Park Avenue Armory, including a work that’s evolved over time: I was sadly underwhelmed by “Rameau, Maître à Danser,” a program that the usually excellent ensemble Les Arts Florissants brought to the Brooklyn Academy of Music last weekend. The Rameau opera-ballets on the double bill were slight, to say the least, as was the staging; the singing was, for the most part, fine, but not remarkable; the music, played from the back of the stage, faded by the time it reached the audience. (The choruses, though, were tenderly handled, and a delicate passage that combined flute and pizzicato strings a perfect example of Rameau’s innovations.) ZACHARY WOOLFE What was that sound? William Christie and Les Arts Florissants have introduced me to plenty of French Baroque repertoire over the years, but when they returned to the Brooklyn Academy of Music last week with “Rameau, Maître à Danser,” they also introduced me to an instrument I had not known before. When I first heard its drone poking through the ensemble, I thought for a second it might be a hurdy-gurdy. Then I thought bagpipe — but with a slightly mellower, English-horn-type sound. Finally the musician, François Lazarevitch, strolled across the stage playing what appeared to be a petite, elegant bagpipe. It was a musette, a bagpipe with bellows that was in vogue among 17th- and 18th-century French aristocrats. You can hear it in this video Mr. Lazarevitch made for Les Musiciens de Saint-Julien. MICHAEL COOPER The John Zorn show came to the Miller Theater at Columbia University on Thursday. And it was most assertively a show. Though he did not perform himself, Mr. Zorn played the role of M.C. with relish, taking microphone in hand to introduce each successive grouping of players. He said a few words about each piece, encouraged applause, and then got off the stage. (Among his other attributes, Mr. Zorn is rare among new-music ringleaders in his frequent avoidance of energy-sapping intermissions.) He had reason to be confident in his cast. The musicians who gathered to perform the hour-plus set of new and recent pieces was something of an all-star team. The JACK Quartet, the pianist Stephen Gosling, the percussionist Tyshawn Sorey and the vibraphonist Sae Hashimoto all made multiple appearances. Among the premieres, I was most struck by Mr. Gosling’s take on the piano-miniature series “Encomia,” which included tributes to composers as diverse as Charles Wuorinen and Debussy. And between its quick-changing volleys of Zornian exultation, “Konx Om Pax” — played by Mr. Gosling, Ms. Hashimoto, Mr. Sorey and the bassist Shanir Ezra Blumenkranz — also contained stretches of luminous brooding, suggestive of noir film music. It probably won’t take very long for some of these pieces to appear on recordings from Mr. Zorn’s Tzadik label. But in the meantime, anyone looking for music similar to some of the works heard on Thursday should acquire “The Interpretation of Dreams” — a stirring 2017 disc that includes a piano quintet for the JACK players and Mr. Gosling, as well as some lights-out playing by Ms. Hashimoto and the rhythm section of Mr. Sorey and Mr. Blumenkranz. SETH COLTER WALLS Like Caravaggio before her, the Baroque painter Artemisia Gentileschi knew how to build scenes of taut drama with far-from-idealized figures crammed into a constricted pictorial space and bathed in harsh light. The composer Laura Schwendinger and the librettist Ginger Strand achieve something similar in their potently claustrophobic opera “Artemisia,” which received its staged premiere at Trinity Wall Street’s St. Paul’s Chapel on Thursday (and repeats on Saturday). Gentileschi’s life story could provide fodder for many hours of music drama. The daughter of a painter, she was raped by her teacher when she was a teenager. At a court trial, her assailant was convicted, but only after she had been subjected to torture to verify her testimony. She went on to attract the attention of Cosimo II de’ Medici, befriended Galileo Galilei and worked in London at the invitation of King Charles I. “Artemisia” lasts just 80 minutes, but fits in big themes set to music of quivering intensity. The story of the rape is there, blended with Gentileschi’s unbearably compassionate painting of the biblical character Susanna, who was ogled and shamed in her bath. But larger questions of idea and form, image and projection, sight and gaze also find nuanced and intelligent treatment. CORINNA da FONSECA-WOLLHEIM "
5caf67dc49f0eacbf1f82d71,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/arts/music/george-crumb-90th-birthday.html,"MEDIA, Penn. — The sounds that filter into George Crumb’s composition studio here are a typically suburban mix of placid and suddenly brash. The occasional car skulks by on the leafy street outside. Visitors are greeted by vociferous barking from one of the shelter dogs rescued by Mr. Crumb and his wife of 70 years, Elizabeth. She keeps the radio on the classical music station most of the day, while their youngest son, Peter, who lives with them, blasts country in his bedroom upstairs. The music Mr. Crumb has dreamed up in this home studio, a converted garage, over the decades is often peaceful and jolting, like his sonic environment. But his compositions unfold in another world that is dreamlike and sometimes nightmarish. He continues to compose here even as he approaches his 90th birthday, coming in October. On Sunday and Tuesday, the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center gets in early on the celebration, presenting a two-concert tribute to Mr. Crumb at Alice Tully Hall. Included is the premiere of a new piece for percussion ensemble, as well as some of the classic works that have made him one of the most recognizable and beloved voices in contemporary music. Among them are “Vox Balaenae,” which draws whale-like sounds from a flute, and the Vietnam War-haunted “Black Angels” for amplified string quartet, which one critic called “a work of frightening intensity, where Jimi Hendrix and Pierrot Lunaire shake hands with the devil.” In “Music for a Summer Evening,” for two pianos and percussion, the musicians become celebrants in a mesmerizing ritual that requires the pianists to reach deep into the instrument’s strings. The pianist Gilbert Kalish, who has long championed this music and will perform in both concerts, spoke in an interview about Mr. Crumb’s expansion of the piano’s color palette through novel techniques. “It’s like a new instrument he’s invented,” he said. “And it’s really wild.” Mr. Crumb’s compositions inhabit a strange kind of suburbia themselves, a liminal space, rooted in the canon of Western music but venturing out into the world of natural sounds and acoustic phenomena. Echoes abound, whether from the careful manipulation of overtones and resonances or through the discreet halo created by metallic percussion. Mr. Crumb, who grew up in Charleston, W.Va., with the sound of a rushing river ricocheting off the surrounding hills, said early sound memories might have found a way into his music. “There were echoes constantly,” he said on a recent afternoon in his studio, as he sat in an office chair that allowed him to scoot back and forth between a desk piled high with scores and a piano in need of tuning. “I do think that composers inherit a kind of acoustic.” Fragments from other composers float through his works and settle in strange places. “Vox Balaenae” references the optimistic ascending brass fanfare of Strauss’s “Also Sprach Zarathustra,” but in so spectral a manner that it seems like a trick of the listener’s imagination. For much of Mr. Crumb’s career, such quotations were anathema to the reigning modernist ethos. But the battles that raged in the middle of the 20th century between warring aesthetic movements seem to have passed him by. Asked whether he was ever criticized for writing tonal pieces or quoting Chopin, Mr. Crumb replied innocently. “No, I don’t recall anything like that,” he said as his face creased into a smile. “Maybe they spoke about it, and I didn’t hear them.” While much of the respected music in those days was intellectual and a bit airless, “George was a maverick,” Mr. Kalish said. “His music was so appealing and emotional.” That’s not to say Mr. Crumb makes it easy for performers. His scores are known to delight and terrify musicians in equal measure. The hand-drawn staves on his manuscripts sometimes curve into circles or break up into islands in a sea of white paper. The flutist Tara Helen O’Connor, who will perform “Vox Balaenae” on Sunday, said in an interview that the arrangement of notes on the page in a Crumb score is “his way of expressing how the music flows through space, which is really beautiful and unique.” At the same time, she added, “it also leaves some of the magic and creativity up to the performer.” Folded into the elegant design are countless instructions, both exacting and poetic. Some of them read more like stage directions than expressive markings: Under the title “An Idyll for the Misbegotten,” a work for flute and drums, Mr. Crumb wrote “to be heard from afar, over a lake, on a moonlit evening in August.” “It puts the performer into that space,” Ms. O’Connor said. “Now I have a temperature; there’s insects and bugs; and there’s a thunderstorm brewing.” The music becomes an organic process: “It’s based in nature.” For Mr. Crumb, the process of designing his manuscripts and drawing each stave by hand is painstaking, but he wouldn’t have it any other way. “I just don’t like computer notation,” he said. “It all looks alike.” His works are loved by performers and audiences to a degree that few other living composers can match. Mr. Crumb counts over 20 recordings of his piano cycle “Makrokosmos” alone. Last fall, he received three new ones in the mail in the space of six weeks, made by pianists from Spain, Greece and Japan. But it’s not just the notation that’s laborious for Mr. Crumb. Over a long career he has produced just around 50 pieces, a number he compared, with a wistful laugh, with the more than 600 Mozart wrote in a much shorter life. He has said his productivity dipped in the 1980s and into the ’90s as he devoted himself to teaching. “You read about some composers who could write at the speed of wind,” Mr. Crumb said. “It was never that way for me. It’s like groping for something that’s resistant.” He gestured to the stacks of manuscript scores on his desk, with their custom-drawn staves and hand-lettered instructions. “You truly have to believe that you live forever,” he said. “Because it takes time.” "

I wouldn’t recommend the trip to Brooklyn for Ivo van Hove’s sluggish, overstuffed staging of Janacek’s “Diary of One Who Disappeared” at BAM.  I would, though, recommend listening to the piece, which I offer below in two versions, the original (for voices and solo piano) and a later, lusher orchestral arrangement (played gorgeously by the Berlin Philharmonic under Claudio Abbadio). And read Thomas May’s moving story on the composer George Walker, whose Sinfonia No. 5, “Visions” — his response to the 2015 shooting at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church — has its first live performance in Seattle on April 11. (His hands on the piano are in the photo above.) I leave you with Anna Netrebko’s “Pace, pace” from the London “Forza del Destino” I was lucky enough to attend recently. Happy listening! ZACHARY WOOLFE The Criterion Collection recently released a new restoration of Ingmar Bergman’s 1975 screen adaptation of “The Magic Flute” — a stylized and slightly bonkers Swedish-language take on Mozart’s opera. It’s a film as much about Bergman’s love of the opera as it is a film of the piece itself. The director sets it in a theater, presenting both his vision for a staging and the experience of putting on a performance. During the overture, you never see the orchestra; instead, the camera settles on the face of a young girl experiencing Mozart’s magical score for the first time. Then you see other faces: young, old, male, female, white, brown. This is music for everyone. Throughout the show, Bergman moves fluidly between onstage action and backstage humor. Papageno nearly misses his entrance because he is napping. He rolls out of his dressing room and runs to the wings, where is outfitted with his birdcage backpack and pan flute just in time to play the flute’s famous upward scale. During intermission, the Queen of the Night is seen smoking under a sign that says “Smoking strictly forbidden,” while the dragon walks awkwardly down the corridor and Tamino and Pamina play chess to pass time. This is nothing like the opera films of Franco Zeffirelli, which are lavishly literal-minded. It’s much stranger and smaller, and endlessly endearing. JOSHUA BARONE The pianist Emanuel Ax played works by Brahms, Ravel and Chopin splendidly at his recent recital at Carnegie Hall. But I was especially stuck by his pairing of two seemingly disparate works, when he followed an alluring account of George Benjamin’s “Piano Figures” (2004) with Schumann’s “Fantasiestücke,” hardly taking a break between the two.  In juxtaposing old and new works, an artist can call attention to resonances that bridge centuries. That’s what happened here. Mr. Benjamin’s 14-minute “Piano Figures” is a set of 10 elusive miniatures, each exploring a different element of music, like hypnotic repetitions in “Spell” or jagged tangles of counterpoint in the aptly titled “Knots.” Then Mr. Ax turned to Schumann’s fantastical set of eight pieces. Playing the two works side by side, Mr. Ax emphasized the wildness, even radicalism, of the Schumann and highlighted hints of mystical Romanticism in the Benjamin. He ended with a dazzling account of Chopin’s “Andante Spianato and Grande Polonaise Brillante,” another work he has played (and recorded) to acclaim. ANTHONY TOMMASINI "
5c2fb04d3a125f5075c02e2d,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/arts/music/princeton-meditation-music.html,"PRINCETON, N.J. — For as long as I can remember, I have loved the silences of the concert hall almost as much as the sounds. The expectant hush that falls on an auditorium when the oboe’s A pierces through the hum of voices and the lights dim. The way a spellbound audience can wrap a protective silence around a pianissimo ending. But on a recent afternoon in Richardson Auditorium at Princeton University here, silence became an equal partner to the music. I was in the hall for a series called Live Music Meditation. (The next event, on March 28, features the violinist Patricia Kopatchinskaja.) For the first 20 minutes, while listeners quietly filed in, I sat motionless with my eyes closed, noting the sounds of footsteps and the rustle of coats. Gradually, the calm deepened, broken now and then by a male voice inviting us to focus on our breath, relax our shoulders, and clear our minds. From inside this stillness, the sound of a gong rang out like a bright explosion, followed by waves of amber overtones that seemed to dance with each other in space. Then more silence, long minutes of nothing to hear but the breathing of strangers. When the first notes of a clarinet threaded their way into my consciousness, they seemed to come from inside me. For the next half-hour, as a piano joined the clarinet, music wound its way through me as sound turned pure sensation. Eventually the last note settled back into silence. Then one more time the gong, followed by that male voice, sounding a little sheepish: “Some people would find it appropriate to clap now.” The applause, when it came, did seem out of place. And the performers, the clarinetist Martin Frost and the pianist Henrik Mawe, didn’t bow. In an onstage discussion after the unusual concert, they professed to being somewhat overwhelmed. “We were so aware of you listening to us so intensely that we started to listen to ourselves even more intensely, too,” Mr. Mawe said. An audience member told the musicians that, for him, “the most special thing was the silence before and after you played. There was anticipation without expectation.” The series, which is free to the public, was conceived by Dasha Koltunyuk, a pianist and a longtime member of a meditation group led by Matthew Weiner, a dean in the office of religious life at the university. By combining guided meditation with live music, she hoped to create a space in which, she said in a statement, “our tendency toward passivity or judgment while hearing music disperses into a pure, perceptive and receptive state of intense, present listening.” Composers have long played with silence. In the 20th century, they began to dissolve the border between scripted silence inside the music — the rests — and the ambient silence of a given acoustic space. Ligeti’s “Lux Aeterna” fades into seven bars of rest at the end. John Cage’s “4’33”” consists entirely of notated silence. These days, more presenters are experimenting with ways to make the audience aware of its role in creating the silence out of which music grows. When the artist Marina Abramovic presented the pianist Igor Levit in Bach’s “Goldberg” Variations at the Park Avenue Armory in 2015, listeners were relieved of their cellphones and outfitted with noise-dampening headphones that helped them sink into deep quiet for 30 minutes before the first notes of Bach. Concerts inside the Moab Music Festival’s red rock grotto in Utah begin with an invitation to take in the stillness of the natural setting. A two-minute “celebration of silence” is at the center of Chatter in Albuquerque, N.M., and Gather NYC at SubCulture in Manhattan, both Sunday morning series combining classical music and storytelling. In a telephone interview, the violinist and conductor David Felberg, who runs Chatter, said that most audience members close their eyes for that period. “They’re either meditating or trying to listen to the sounds that exist naturally around them,” he said. “For us, it’s a bit of a palate-cleanser. It’s almost like you’re fresh and ready to listen to the music.” Mr. Weiner, the Princeton dean, who led the guided meditation, said in an interview that he thinks of the quality created in the room not so much as silence but as sensitivity. In Buddhism, he said, that “doesn’t just mean verbal silence with your tongue. It means softening the constructions in your mind that get in the way of experiencing what’s in front of you.” As a critic normally tasked with shaping those constructions into written words, I was keenly aware of that softening. And as a diligent but novice meditator, I caught a glimpse, through the music, of what it means to let thoughts bubble up without engaging with them — through applause or judgment. Here was music not as a text to be read nor a recreational drug to be consumed for mood management, but as an audible process of coming-into-being and fading-away. And, for a short while, listening turned into a state of pure receptivity: beginner’s ear. "

This week, the soprano Christine Georke brought her much-hyped Brünnhilde to the Metropolitan Opera for the opening of Wagner’s “Die Walküre,” my favorite installment of the “Ring.” Her arrival is remarkable if only because vocal troubles nearly pushed her to quit opera; you can read all about it in Michael Cooper’s profile of her:  Corinna da Fonseca-Wollheim, who reviewed “Die Walküre,” wrote that in Ms. Goerke, the Met “has found a Brünnhilde who marries vocal vitality and emotional presence in each radiant note.” I couldn’t agree more. Listen for yourself how she tosses off those howls of “Hojotoho!”  Expect more coverage of the “Ring” as the Met rolls its revival of Robert Lepage’s production. Anthony Tommasini has offered his thoughts on how Wagner’s epic always seems to be eerily resonant, especially now in this moment of divisive American politics.  But enough about Wagner (for now). Elsewhere this week, I attended the latest edition of the New York Philharmonic’s Nightcap series. These little concerts are meant to provide an intimate introduction to living composers — John Adams, in this case. The program Mr. Adams curated, however, was generous and illuminating, featuring only two of his works (“I Still Play” and “First Quartet”) to make room for ones by his younger colleagues.  So Mr. Adams presented music by people like Timo Andres — he also played the evening’s solo piano pieces — and Nico Muhly, as well as Gabriella Smith, who I hope will be heard at the Philharmonic again soon. Enjoy an excerpt from her “Carrot Revolution,” a sonically intrepid piece that has the impression of an image coming in and out of focus, joyously performed at Nightcap by the Attacca Quartet.  I was back at the Philharmonic on Wednesday for a one-night-only concert featuring Yuja Wang, as thrilling as ever, in Robert Schumann’s Piano Concerto in A minor. The great Maurizio Pollini was originally scheduled to appear, but canceled. As it happens, Ms. Wang is currently touring the work. She was mesmerizing in a performance last month with the Boston Symphony Orchestra, where she struck a Martha Argerich-like balance of commanding precision and wildness. The scales tipped slightly at David Geffen Hall this week as she opened the concerto with a fiery run of chords. Which is not to say she gave a feral performance: She never appeared out of control as she navigated the piece’s changing moods and fickle attachment to Romantic and Classical styles. For an encore, she leaned into Romanticism with one of her standbys, Liszt’s stirring transcription of the Schubert song “Gretchen am Spinnrade.”  For those following Ms. Wang’s many appearances in New York this season, she’ll next play at Carnegie Hall on April 10, where her Perspectives series continues with a recital featuring the cellist Gautier Capuçon. On the program is Rachmaninoff’s Cello Sonata in G minor, a chamber work whose dreamy sound world I’m always happy to revisit. See you there. JOSHUA BARONE If the opera world had awards like the Oscars, then in 1998 the tenor Anthony Dean Griffey would surely have won for best actor in a leading role, for his wrenching performance as the hulking, slow-witted Lennie in Carlisle Floyd’s “Of Mice and Men” at New York City Opera. (Here he is in the video above, in a 2011 production at Opera Australia.)  Mr. Griffey might even have picked up the award again in 2008, for the title role of Britten’s “Peter Grimes” at the Metropolitan Opera. His Grimes came across like a dangerously intemperate and painfully isolated man-boy.  Now a professor of voice at the Eastman School of Music, Mr. Griffey returned to New York for a recital last Sunday at the Morgan Library & Museum. He shared the program with the gifted, radiant-voiced young coloratura soprano Amy Owens (presented in collaboration with the George London Foundation). The Warren Jones was the elegant, superb piano accompanist.  Mr. Griffey brought robust sound, tenderness and his trademark crisp diction to songs by Frank Bridge, John Jacob Niles, Charles Ives and others. He paid tribute to Mr. Floyd, now 92, singing Sam’s Aria from “Susannah,” which he once performed at the Met with Renée Fleming in the title role. Mr. Griffey also expressed gratitude to André Previn, who died last month, for giving him career-changing opportunities, including casting him as Mitch in the premiere of the opera “A Streetcar Named Desire” (which also starred Ms. Fleming). Mr. Griffey then sang a wistful performance of Mitch’s revealing aria. ANTHONY TOMMASINI "

You may notice that this week’s compendium has been put together and published on Saturday morning, rather than the usual Friday afternoon.  Blame the unreliable Wi-Fi on my flight back from London, where I had traveled to see the opening of Verdi’s “La Forza del Destino” at the Royal Opera House. The main draw: the show brings together Anna Netrebko and Jonas Kafumann in a staged opera for the first time since 2008. It was a particular coup for Ms. Netrebko, who gave, I wrote, “one of the performances of her career.” Comparing it with some other recent new roles, “it is a more spontaneous creation than Ms. Netrebko’s serene Aida or her stilted Tosca, with the grandeur and sorrow of her Adriana Lecouvreur and a febrility that recalls her Lady Macbeth.” Here’s a clip of her singing “Pace, pace,” the climactic aria in “Forza,” in concert in Buenos Aires last year: Lincoln Center’s Mostly Mozart Festival announced its 2019 season. Here’s our summary, and here’s the full release. Some good news out of New England: Florence Price’s music will make its debut with the Boston Symphony, five years after William Robin, writing in our pages, called the orchestra out for overlooking her. And Anthony Tommasini compared the Met’s old and new “Ring” productions when it comes to Wotan’s Narrative, perhaps the cycle’s emotional center. Here are the clips! With singing like that, I hope you’ll agree that late was better than never this week. Enjoy your weekend! ZACHARY WOOLFE On Wednesday at Zankel Hall, the vocal ensemble Theatre of Voices and its director, Paul Hillier, presented small sets of music by Arvo Pärt and David Lang. But the impact of their tour through Pärt — an assemblage of works composed in different decades — was drained of some pleasure by a video piece projected alongside it. The sedate shots of animals and skyscapes brought Mr. Pärt’s profundity (as well as the group’s singing) down to earth. The premiere of the full version of Mr. Lang’s “the writings” helped illustrate how little help musicianship of this caliber actually requires. Presented simply, without multimedia interference, Mr. Lang’s work brought the Theatre’s singers together with members of Yale Voxtet. They made a strong case for Mr. Lang’s latest cycle, which draws inspiration from the Hebrew Bible. The text of the third movement, “for love is strong,” is a long list poem of similes revolving around rooted, droning tones. And in a later movement, one could hear a chattering central vocal part that seemed influenced by Meredith Monk. But the harmonies — quickly shifting, comforting and peculiar at once — served as reminders of Mr. Lang’s individual artistry. SETH COLTER WALLS On Monday evening, the Metropolitan Opera brought back David McVicar’s handsomely efficient production of “Tosca,” with the conductor Carlo Rizzi leading a rich and exciting reading of the score. Flu season provided more excitement: On Monday afternoon, the soprano Jennifer Rowley, who was to have sung the title role, withdrew because of illness. She was replaced by Iulia Isaev, a Romanian soprano making her Met debut. With a powdery soft tone and comforting low register, Ms. Isaev was most convincing in the first act, in which we get to know Tosca as a sweet and playfully pious diva. Her flirtatious interplay with Joseph Calleja’s Cavaradossi felt alluringly natural. (He, too, was battling a cold but pulled out some stirring lines.) But the opera’s fascination stems from Tosca’s growth under pressure, as she faces the awful choice between hearing her lover tortured and submitting to a sexual bully — and then when she, with desperate clarity, kills her tormentor. Ms. Isaev never quite marshaled the power to convey that transformation. The aria “Vissi d’arte” should mark a turning point in the opera, but while Ms. Isaev’s rendition had melting sadness, in the cautious top note of the climax there was none of the bitter fire that should fuel the dramatic events to come.

5c87758e49f0eacbf105c92d,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/12/arts/metropolitan-museum-reopens-music-gallery.html,"That’s Japan on your left. The first thing you may notice, inside a glass case filled with musical instruments, is the eighth-century koto, a long, low instrument with strings sometimes played while sitting on the floor. Southeast Asia is on your right. What looks like a small crocodile is a 19th-century mi-gyaung, or crocodile zither, from Myanmar (when it was Burma). Just beyond those cases are lutes, lyres, gongs, drums, horns, harps, whistles, Italian violins, Indonesian gamelans, lamellaphones from sub-Saharan Africa, a golden harpsichord seemingly supported by mythical creatures and keyboard instruments small enough to fit in your carry-on luggage. This is Gallery 681, “Mapping the Art of Music,” an intimate second-floor space at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, which opened last month after a three-year makeover. (An exhibition of non-Western instruments was here before.) “We still have a lot of questions about the origins of music,” said Bradley Strauchen-Scherer, an associate curator who oversaw the new gallery’s creation — and a French horn player since her middle school days in Connecticut. But the new gallery, she said, sheds considerable light on music’s travels. “It sets up these really wonderful juxtapositions, how these different places have talked to each other, traded with each other,” said Ms. Strauchen-Scherer, who joined the Met seven years ago after almost two decades as a curator in London. There are some 250 instruments in the new gallery, the oldest a terra cotta trumpet (circa 200 B.C.-A.D. 400) in the shape of a jaguar. It’s from the Moche civilization in what is now northern Peru. The jaguar sits next to a couple of 11th- to 15th-century Peruvian “whistling jars.” Anyone who ever created musical notes as a child by blowing across the top of a glass soda bottle will get the idea. One of the newest objects here — although it looks far from contemporary — is an akonting (circa 2000), a traditional West African stringed instrument that served as a forerunner of the banjo. And while enslaved Africans may not have carried their instruments across the Atlantic Ocean, nothing could take away their musical influences. “Instruments survive,” Ms. Strauchen-Scherer said. “That’s why we spend so much time studying them.” But the imports, she said, were just as much in the hearts, minds and memories of the people crossing borders over the centuries: tradesmen, immigrants, soldiers, explorers and prisoners. “They’re thinking about rhythm; they’re thinking about harmony,” she suggested, referring to Africans on the Middle Passage. “It melds with American thinking, and it becomes ragtime — it becomes jazz.” The research that went into the new gallery’s development did not reveal one single geographic origin of all music. What it demonstrated was to what extent people all over the planet were discovering a lot of the same things simultaneously. One enormous influence was the Silk Road, the trade route that connected East and West for some 1,500 years and the later Triangular Trade, among North America, Europe and Africa. Music galleries need music, of course, and the exhibition includes some 80 audio clips. Visitors can even enjoy free audio guides on Bose headphones, if they arrive from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. There’s also a small concert stage with state-of-the-art sound equipment. A number of musical selections from the featured instruments are also on the museum’s website. There are demonstrations of the morin khuur of Mongolia, the tanbur panj simi and the shakuhachi. One of the more familiar selections is “Yankee Doodle Dandy,” played on a Brooklyn-made hand-crank-operated barrel piano like the ones that street musicians carried or wheeled down city walkways in the mid-19th century. But the new gallery is an enthusiastically visual experience too. “We celebrate instruments as works of art,” Ms. Strauchen-Scherer said. The Japanese odaiko (1873), for instance, is an ornate cloisonné and enamel drum with lacquerwork dragons on the skins. The Mexican seven-course guitar (guitarra séptima, 1880) has geometric patterns and floral designs in spruce, rosewood and inlaid mother-of-pearl. On top of that, Gallery 681 has borrowed pieces of art from elsewhere in the museum and hung them above Michele Todini’s gilded mid-1600s Italian harpsichord. One standout is Fernando Botero’s “Dancing in Colombia” (1980), an almost nine-feet-wide oil showing sizable musicians in bowler hats. The opening of “Mapping the Art of Music” completes the museum’s André Mertens Galleries for Musical Instruments. It sits just beyond the section’s other large gallery, “The Art of Music Through Time,” which reopened last year. Gallery 681 isn’t necessarily easy to find. Visitors take the glass elevator in the first-floor American Wing to the second floor and look for the frosted glass doors on the east balcony. When they see the massive 1830 Thomas Appleton pipe organ, they’ve arrived. "
5ca78f6f49f0eacbf1f81379,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/05/arts/music/janacek-diary-bam-review.html,"In the summer of 1917, the composer Leos Janacek met Kamila Stosslova. Both were married, and Stosslova was nearly 40 years younger, but they developed an intimate more-than-friendship: Janacek sent her more than 700 letters, increasingly intense, over the final decade of his life. The relationship — almost completely, and agonizingly, unconsummated — immediately inspired a late-in-life creative flowering. Janacek started writing his smoldering song cycle “Diary of One Who Disappeared” shortly after meeting Stosslova. The connection is obvious between that fateful meeting — and Janacek’s guilty passion — and the subject of “Diary,” which is playing through Saturday at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in a busy yet listless staging by Ivo van Hove. In the cycle, a young farmer abandons his home and family to go off with Zefka, a Gypsy woman he falls in love with. Janacek, no surprise, connected Zefka with Stosslova, whose dark hair and features he described as Gypsy-like. “I always thought about you in that work,” he later wrote to her. The Brooklyn production, directed by the inescapable, much-debated Mr. van Hove (“Network,” “A View From the Bridge,” “The Damned”) in collaboration with the Dutch company Muziektheater Transparant, clumsily brings this subtext to the fore. The young tenor protagonist (Andrew Dickinson), here a modern-day photographer puttering around his home darkroom, is doubled by an older male actor (Wim van der Grijn) wearing the same style of suit. We eventually come to realize that the actor represents Janacek, though this isn’t quite clear until the end, when he is burning papers and soberly intones the section of the composer’s will stating that a portion of the royalties from “Diary” and other late works inspired by Stosslova — his “Zefka” — will go to her after his death. Janacek’s “Diary” is an intimate, enigmatic series of not quite two dozen short songs accompanied by a solo piano, less than 40 minutes in all — as rich, and as transient, as a dream. It was hardly unusual in the classical tradition to create a song cycle tracking the agonies of love — think of Schubert’s and Schumann’s wrenching collections — but Janacek, working with anonymous poems that had appeared in a Czech newspaper, made things a bit more theatrical. The Gypsy love interest is not just sung about but also appears and sings, a haunting presence made even more so by an unseen chorus of three female voices. The cycle has been staged on rare occasions, but even in concert form, physical movement is suggested: The score indicates the points at which the mezzo-soprano soloist (in Brooklyn, Marie Hamard) should inconspicuously enter and leave, a spectral, passing reminder of a recalled time gone by. Mr. van Hove has swelled these suggestions into a full-on memory play. Interpolations of new music (Annelies Van Parys, politely unobtrusive) and spoken passages have added 20 minutes or so to the running time, turning Janacek’s jewel-box melancholy into a sluggish, stagy hour. Objects are angrily swept off a table. An urn full of the ashes of a long-ago lover is emptied into a sink. Lovers roll around on the floor. The music of “Diary” is often passionate, but this melodrama — the kind of needlessly heightened, smugly visceral stage action that’s characteristically van Hove-ian — feels out of place, false. Jan Versweyveld’s long, horizontal strip of a set is handsome; even more evocative is Mr. Versweyveld’s lighting, which occasionally turns this contemporary live-work space into something like a forest, with golden sunlight filtering through the leaves. But surprisingly little comes of the decision to make the main character a photographer. This choice feels less like a real reckoning with memory and loss than a way of solving the problem of how we are to know the identity of the woman onstage. (Our tenor has conveniently taken contact sheets full of shots of her, making it clear that she’s the Zefka he’s singing about.) Some effort is put into fleshing out Zefka’s character, with Ms. Van Parys contributing gentle, sinuous, chant-like settings of texts inspired by poems by Romany women, sung by Ms. Hamard and the offstage choir (Raphaële Green, Annelies Van Gramberen and Naomi Beeldens). It’s fine to try and give Zefka a fuller personality, but in practice it merely creates confusion, a muddle of memories. The real problem is that in Mr. van Hove’s staging, skulking around in a red dress, the character comes across as an even vaguer vixen than she does in Janacek’s score — less complex, not more so. There was subtlety in Lada Valesova’s piano playing, and some richness in Ms. Hamard’s voice. But Mr. Dickinson strained toward Janacek’s tensely ardent climaxes. At just 60 minutes, the evening feels inflated yet stingy. The punch line “and such small portions” came to mind. "

[Read about the final run of the Met’s “Aida.”] There will be just two more performances, on March 4 and 7. When the opera returns, it’ll be to open the 2020-21 season in a new staging by Michael Mayer, of the Met’s Rat Pack “Rigoletto.” (The “Aida” cast looks incredible: Anna Netrebko, Anita Rachvelishvili, Piotr Beczala and Ludovic Tézier, conducted by Yannick Nézet-Séguin.) Other things this week: — Josh Barone revisited John Adams’s recent opera “Girls of the Golden West” in Amsterdam. — Accusations of bullying threaten Daniel Barenboim’s previously sacrosanct position in the Berlin music scene. — Nate Wooley makes amazing music. — Hear seven of the best works from the middle of the last century, a sadly neglected period in American music. — Reviews of “Falstaff” at the Met, a virtuosic pianist and the tenor Matthew Polenzani. (Gotta love a singer who programs Janacek’s “Diary of One Who Disappeared.”) In a tweet, the composer Nico Muhly yanked me in the direction of Alexandre Tharaud’s recording of Rameau keyboard works, which I listened to and promptly recommended to everyone I know. You need to hear this strange and glorious recording! Enjoy the weekend. ZACHARY WOOLFE As if the list of stellar pianists still in their 20s and early 30s weren’t long enough, here’s another name to add to it. Beatrice Rana, 26, should probably already be on the list, to be fair, with a handful of strong recordings including a “Goldberg” Variations that I named as one of the releases of the year in 2017.  But she’s only now making her way around the recital circuit, with a debut to come on March 12 at Carnegie Hall. I heard the program she’ll play there this past Wednesday, as part of the Celebrity Series of Boston. Agosti’s transcription of Stravinsky’s “The Firebird” had all the virtuosic flair that you’d expect, but never for its own sake; Ravel’s “Miroirs” were as polished as pearls, each blessed by uncommon sensitivity of touch; and if I was never quite convinced by her meditative take on Chopin’s Op. 25 Études, it always intrigued. One to watch. DAVID ALLEN "

For Holy Week, the seven movements of Haydn’s “The Seven Last Words of Christ” are paired with companion commissions by the contemporary composers Jessica Meyer, Colin Jacobsen, Nico Muhly, Tania León, Reena Esmail, Paola Prestini and Caroline Shaw. 212-799-5000, juilliard.edu DAVID T. LITTLE at Miller Theater (April 18, 8 p.m.). Little is perhaps best and deservedly known for his operas, including “Dog Days” and “JFK,” so this composer portrait is a welcome opportunity to hear some of his instrumental music. Not that the music to be played here sets aside the political approach that he has taken in so much of his work. “Haunt of Last Nightfall,” for percussion quartet and electronics, takes its story from the 1981 El Mozote massacre in El Salvador by soldiers trained by the United States military; “AGENCY,” for string quartet and electronics, is a work about secrecy, itself written using ciphers. Third Coast Percussion and the American Contemporary Music Ensemble are on hand to perform. 212-854-7799, millertheatre.com [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] LONDON PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA at David Geffen Hall (April 14, 3 p.m.; April 15, 8 p.m.). A doubleheader from this solid British ensemble, led by the conductor Edward Gardner, albeit with distinctly routine programs. On Sunday, they perform Debussy and Ravel, including Ravel’s Piano Concerto, with Jean-Efflam Bavouzet at the keyboard; on Monday, Beethoven’s “Egmont” Overture, Sibelius’s Violin Concerto with James Ehnes, and Mahler’s Symphony No. 1. 212-721-6500, lincolncenter.org ORCHESTRA OF ST.

The English Concert’s annual performances of Handel oratorios and operas at Carnegie, under Harry Bicket, have been surefire hits for the past several years. Brenda Rae sings the title role, alongside Elizabeth DeShong, Soloman Howard, Benjamin Hulett, Ailish Tynan and the Clarion Choir. 212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org ‘SIEGFRIED’ at the Metropolitan Opera (April 13, 11:30 a.m.).

This fine, exuberant ensemble is led from the violin by Richard Tognetti, who also made two of the arrangements on this program, namely the first four fugues from Bach’s “The Art of Fugue,” and Beethoven’s mammoth Op. 130 quartet, with “Grosse Fuge” as its ending. Also on the bill is Mozart’s Piano Concerto No. 12, with Inon Barnatan at the keyboard. 212-721-6500, lincolncenter.org BUDAPEST FESTIVAL ORCHESTRA at Carnegie Hall (April 5-6, 8 p.m.). One of the best orchestras in the world brings a pair of avowedly Hungarian programs to New York, under the ceaselessly interesting baton of Ivan Fischer. On Friday, Bartok’s Concerto for Orchestra and the suite from “The Miraculous Mandarin” are put in the context of the composer’s rarely heard choral music, performed by the Cantemus Choir, directed by Denes Szabo. On Saturday, there’s more Bartok, with a focus on the folk music that so inspired him, to be sung by Marta Sebestyen, before his chilling “Bluebeard’s Castle.” Ildiko Komlosi and Krisztian Cser are the singers for that one-act opera. 212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org MIRANDA CUCKSON AND CONOR HANICK at Bargemusic (April 5, 7 p.m.).

Pollini had to cancel a recent, scheduled appearance with the New York Philharmonic, so keep everything crossed that this most eminent of pianists can make it this time. He plays Chopin and Schumann, as he does so often, but there’s also something of a novelty for these fingers: the Brahms Op. 117 Intermezzos, late music of unbearable poignancy. 212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org MARIANNE SCHROEDER at St. Peter’s Episcopal Church (April 5, 8 p.m.).

This week, I’ve looked to my colleague Josh Barone for reports on Yuja Wang’s concert at Zankel Hall with the music-comedy duo Igudesman & Joo, which had sketches and jokes about sex and race that Josh found troubling. He reviewed the program. But we felt there was still more to explore. So he wrote this thoughtful piece about the event and the line between satire and offense. Please read it, and let us know what you think. Coming up this weekend at the Los Angeles Philharmonic is an intriguing small festival devoted to William Grant Still and music of — and inspired by — the Harlem Renaissance. Still’s First Symphony, which will be played on Saturday, gets some play; his Fourth, set for Sunday, very little. Take a listen: Some other things to catch you up on: The conductor Daniel Harding, who’s had trouble with American orchestras, is dipping his toe in this country again. Here’s a playlist of some of his best recordings: The ensemble Blue Heron has made a specialty of nearly vanished music of the English Renaissance. Listen to what it’s uncovered: And “Rigoletto” returned to the Metropolitan Opera, to little effect. Enjoy the weekend! ZACHARY WOOLFE Szymanowski’s First Violin Concerto (1916) was the oldest work on the Boston Symphony Orchestra’s program last Friday. But it felt like the most modern. That isn’t a dig against the other two pieces: Olly Wilson’s 1981 “Lumina,” and Copland’s Third Symphony, which was given its premiere by the Bostonians in 1946. But they seemed conservative compared with the Szymanowski — a restless, single-movement adventure that dances back and forth between lyricism and mayhem. The orchestra, enthusiastically conducted by Andris Nelsons, seemed almost gleeful as the concerto’s hodgepodge sonority was at its most raucous and exotic. Lisa Batiashvili, the soloist, was the calmest person onstage. Yet she was also the most thrilling to watch, and virtually flawless as she navigated her mercurial part’s taxing blend of harsh double stops, screeching high notes and soaring melodies. JOSHUA BARONE The baritone Gerald Finley may be best known for creating the role of the ambitious, tormented J. Robert Oppenheimer in John Adams’s 2005 opera “Doctor Atomic.” His latest appearance at the Met was in the title role of Bartok’s “Bluebeard’s Castle.”  It was chilling to witness Mr. Finley, with his warm, robust voice, bringing such subdued malevolence to the murderous Bluebeard. I was reminded of a completely different triumph for Mr. Finley at the Met, in the title role of Rossini’s masterpiece “Guillaume Tell” in 2016.  Here he is in a poignant excerpt from the Act III aria “Sois immobile,” when Tell, who has been arrested, is ordered to shoot an arrow into an apple balanced on the head of his beloved son. He instructs the young man to stay completely still while calling upon God. Mr. Finlay conveys an aching mix of outward assurance and inner panic. ANTHONY TOMMASINI "

In memory of Michael Gielen, the searching conductor who died last Friday at 91 — read David Allen’s superb obituary — hear one of the selections David chose: Beethoven’s “Missa Solemnis,” rendered with cleareyed power. Listen as you go about chores, or take the subway, or drive to the bank. You’ll be glad you did. On Wednesday, I was at the Metropolitan Opera for the return of “Samson et Dalila” with a fresh cast — notably the galvanizing mezzo-soprano Anita Rachvelishvili.  It was clear from the start that the Samson, Aleksandrs Antonenko, was struggling; after intermission, the Met announced that he was ill with a cold, and would be replaced by Gregory Kunde. It’s not easy to jump into the middle of a performance, but Mr. Kunde did it with stylish ease. Now 65(!), he’s moved on from specializing in bel canto earlier in his career to the heroic roles of Verdi and Puccini. But he’s hardly ever sung at the Met. Hopefully that changes now. His success brought me back to an already classic recording of Rossini’s “Armida” made from 1993 performances in Italy. Here’s Mr. Kunde combining memorably with Renée Fleming: This week our critics reviewed the return of “Das Rheingold” to the Met; the New York recital debut of the pianist Beatrice Rana; the umpteenth Carnegie concert by the great violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter; and two concerts from Esa-Pekka Salonen and the Philharmonia Orchestra of London. In darker news, the musicians of the Chicago Symphony have gone on strike, largely over proposed changes to their pension plan. And Christine Goerke spoke with Michael Cooper about taking on Brünnhilde at the Met, where she was once in the young artists program. “I think if you talk to anyone who’s ever been a young artist in any house, it’s always hard to come back and feel like a grown-up,” she said. “I’m going to be 50, and I still feel like I’m 24.” Enjoy the weekend! ZACHARY WOOLFE The night after Beatrice Rana’s New York debut, on the same stage (Zankel Hall), the fun was doubled in a fascinating program of exciting works for two pianos, performed by the formidable Kirill Gerstein, who can play anything, and Thomas Adès, an eminent composer who is also accomplished pianist.  Recently they were with the Boston Symphony Orchestra for the premiere of Mr. Adès’s Piano Concerto, written for Mr. Gerstein. (They bring that work to Carnegie Hall on Wednesday.) At Zankel, they began with Debussy’s “En Blanc et Noir,” a late work, from 1915, which in this starkly beautiful and steely performance seemed not far removed from the shock-and-awe radicalism of Stravinsky’s “The Rite of Spring” (1913).  Turning to Stravinsky, they played Shostakovich’s rarely-heard arrangement of the “Symphony of Psalms.” With the chorus part (a setting of psalm texts) divided between the pianos — and without the distraction, so to speak, of the score’s dark, percussive orchestral sonorities — the modernist daring of Stravinsky’s harmonic language came through stunningly. The program also included Mr. Adès’s stream-of-consciousness Concert Paraphrase from his opera “Powder Her Face,” and ended with an account of Ravel’s “La Valse” that had this showpiece sounding dangerous. Don’t believe me? Here they are playing it in Paris in 2016. ANTHONY TOMMASINI "

The Metropolitan Opera announced its 2019-20 season on Wednesday, and our writers have chosen some highlights. And Corinna da Fonseca-Wollheim took the measure of Daniel Harding and the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam. In sadder news, the composer Dominick Argento, who spent much of his life in Minnesota, died at 91. A Facebook friend told me Argento was close with Mary Ann Feldman, the Minnesota Orchestra’s longtime program annotator, who died this week, too. “A sad week for the classical music community in the Twin Cities,” my correspondent wrote. Argento’s song cycle “From the Diary of Virginia Woolf,” written for Janet Baker, is one of his finest achievements. Enjoy it. ZACHARY WOOLFE The director Mary Birnbaum, in her intriguingly updated production of Purcell’s “Dido and Aeneas” at the Juilliard School, gives us an ambiguous ending. The staging posits that Dido doesn’t die of heartbreak, but by self-immolation, after the public humiliation of being abandoned by her lover, Aeneas. (After all, what kind of queen falls hopelessly for an enemy?) But Ms. Birnbaum further complicates things: Her Dido storms off at the end and seems not to die at all.  It’s a difficult concept, but the cast, dressed in modish, stylized costumes, embraced it and brought lots of youthful, ardent singing to the music, backed by the sensitive period-instrument Juilliard415 ensemble, with Avi Stein conducting. (It runs through Sunday.) The mezzo-soprano Shakèd Bar was a dark-toned, calculating Dido, a role she performed in 2017 in a semi-staged performance with the Jerusalem Baroque Orchestra. The baritone Dominik Belavy, in a sleek three-piece suit covered with embroidered flowers, was an impassioned Aeneas. I must mention Chance Jonas-O’Toole, a sweet-voiced tenor whose small role as a sailor was fortified with a couple of inserted, thematically appropriate Purcell songs. ANTHONY TOMMASINI The Hebrew word “mar’eh,” which means “face” or “sign,” is the revealing title the composer Matthias Pintscher gave his 2011 work for violin and orchestra, which he led with the New York Philharmonic on Thursday. In this 23-minute score, the violin has long passages that seem to be suggesting the myriad auras, or faces, of sounds.  It begins with the violin playing almost gauzy, hushed high tones and scratchy effects. In time, the sounds coalesce into wandering, elusive lyrical lines. Slowly, the violin becomes a questing, sometimes challenging protagonist in a dialogue with the orchestra. Violin utterances draw fidgety, softly rumbling and skittish reactions. Only passing episodes of assertive, gnarly music disrupt the mostly hushed, urgent conversation that dominates this sonic tone poem.  Renaud Capuçon was a spellbinding soloist, as in this excerpt from a 2015 performance with the Berlin Philharmonic, with the composer conducting. To open the program in New York, which runs through Saturday, Mr. Pintscher led a sumptuous, wildly animated yet cagey performance of Ravel’s “Alborada del gracioso.” He ended with a riveting account of Stravinsky’s “Firebird,” a fresh, startling account that conveyed both the plaintive beauties and slashing rawness of this 1910 score. ANTHONY TOMMASINI On Thursday at the Miller Theater at Columbia University, members of Yarn/Wire and the International Contemporary Ensemble gathered for a Composer Portraits concert devoted to works by Wang Lu. The program began with the title work from her recent album, “Urban Inventory.” That suite incorporates some prerecorded street scenes, captured by the composer while visiting Xi’an, the city in China where she was born. The playing at Miller was sharp, particularly in the 2008 chamber work “Siren Song,” which includes passages of acidic squall, as well as pools of melodic reverie. Yet in other works, the players’ acute emphasis on more striated textures occasionally seemed to lose sight of a fine balance between rupture and reflection that can be heard in this composer’s music — as in the final movement of “Urban Inventory,” during which traces of a recording by the pop singer Yang Yuying can be heard. SETH COLTER WALLS On Wednesday, a different sort of pop-classical meeting came during Andy Warhol’s 1966 film “Hedy,” which screened as part of a triple feature at the Whitney Museum of American Art, currently showing a Warhol retrospective. Though the film progressed with the same long-take style of other Warhol moving-image works from the period, “Hedy” also employed interstitial music during its scene transitions. The wildly pulsing drone music that could be heard offstage as Warhol’s camera zoomed in and out was immediately recognizable as the Velvet Underground. The film has no traditional credits, but the Warhol Museum cites work by Underground members Lou Reed and John Cale as part of “Hedy.” In his book “Andy Warhol’s Ridiculous Screenplays,” Warhol collaborator Ronald Tavel remembers the entire group as being present at the Factory during the shoot — though Warhol “amazingly, unforgivably” never managed to capture footage of their playing in the film. Mr. Tavel cites the composer La Monte Young as a likely influence on the group’s playing in this performance, though the forceful music for the film also brought to mind some experiments conducted outside of Mr. Young’s Theater of Eternal Music — including Mr. Cale’s 1965 guitar solo “Summer Heat,” as well as a later collaboration with Tony Conrad, “Dream Interpretation.” SETH COLTER WALLS I made a point of catching a set by the saxophonist and composer Caroline Davis last Saturday at the Greenwich House’s “Sound It Out” series. That was a priority, thanks to the compelling lead single from her next album, “Alula,” which is forthcoming from New Amsterdam Records. Over the three-minute span of “Wingbeat,” you can hear Ms. Davis’s talent for deriving long, dizzying motifs from smaller melodic cells. At Greenwich House (as on the forthcoming album), Ms. Davis was joined by the reliably outstanding keyboardist Matt Mitchell. But since the drummer on the recording, Greg Saunier, had his own gig on Saturday — uptown at the Ecstatic Music Festival — Ms. Davis’s Greenwich House trio included Dan Weiss, some luxury backup casting. This group made a thrashing impression, suggesting both the strength of the compositions on “Alula” as well as the significant potential for additional works by this configuration in the future.

PIOTR ANDERSZEWSKI at Alice Tully Hall (April 2, 7:30 p.m.). Anderszewski is something of a specialist in Beethoven’s Diabelli Variations: He has been associated with it at least since his brilliant release on Virgin Classics in 2001. Here the eccentric pianist prefaces the Beethoven with preludes and fugues from the second book of Bach’s “The Well-Tempered Clavier.” 212-721-6500, lincolncenter.org CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER at Alice Tully Hall (March 31, 5 p.m.). One of the Chamber Music Society’s more enticing programs this season pairs a Bach cantata, “Ich habe genug,” with Haydn’s “The Seven Last Words of Our Savior on the Cross.” The Orion String Quartet performs the Haydn and is joined by the oboist Stephen Taylor, the bassist Timothy Cobb, the harpsichordist Paolo Bordignon and the bass-baritone Ryan Speedo Green for the Bach. 212-875-5788, chambermusicsociety.org CHOIR OF KING’S COLLEGE, CAMBRIDGE, at St. Thomas Church (April 1, 7:30 p.m.). There is a symbolic passing of the baton here, or at least of the vestments. Stephen Cleobury has been the director of music at King’s College, with its famed boy choristers, since 1982. On this, his final tour before retirement in the fall, he and his choir stop at St. Thomas, where his successor, Daniel Hyde, is currently director of music. The program sprawls, from Monteverdi, Tallis and Byrd to Britten, Howells and Vaughan Williams. 212-757-7013, saintthomaschurch.org ‘LA CLEMENZA DI TITO’ at the Metropolitan Opera (March 30, 8:30 p.m.; April 3, 8 p.m.; through April 20). Jean-Pierre Ponnelle’s production returns, and with it comes the prospect of Joyce DiDonato singing the role of Sesto. Joining her are Matthew Polenzani as Tito, Ying Fang as Servilia, Elza van den Heever as Vitellia, Christian Van Horn as Publio and Emily D’Angelo as Annio. Lothar Koenigs conducts. 212-362-6000, metopera.org ‘DIARY OF ONE WHO DISAPPEARED’ at BAM Howard Gilman Opera House (April 4-6, 7:30 p.m.). In association with the Flemish opera company Muziektheater Transparant, the inimitable Ivo van Hove directs a much-anticipated staging of Janacek’s raw song cycle, with added music by Annelies Van Parys.

5c9c7f5f49f0eacbf105f783,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/28/arts/music/hudson-yards-the-shed-arts-center.html,"On opening night at Lincoln Center, in 1962, Leonard Bernstein and the New York Philharmonic, joined by opera singers and a choir, performed music by Beethoven, Mahler, Copland and Vaughan Williams for an audience in tuxedos and gowns. The atmosphere should be decidedly more funky at the concerts that inaugurate the Shed, the 21st-century arts complex devoted to presenting new work, which is just two miles from Lincoln Center. Its first concert series, Soundtrack of America, will celebrate not the European classical sphere but the heritage of African-American music across a broad historical and stylistic spectrum, from spirituals to hip-hop. Most of the crowd will share a dance floor. It’s a statement of purpose, though it also promises to be a party. It signals that the Shed, a $475 million arts center within the Hudson Yards development of luxury retail, name-brand architecture and multimillion-dollar residences, will welcome cultural events and audiences well outside the economic elite. As with all of its programs, some tickets — spread across the room — will be only $10. “Because we’re starting from scratch, we’re trying to customize every decision to being inclusive,” said Alex Poots, the Shed’s artistic director and chief executive. He added: “We commission work across all platforms with parity between performing arts, visual arts and pop. They’re all equal, and there’s no poor relation either in terms of investment or in terms of space, in terms of facilities or in terms of brainpower.” Soundtrack of America, a five-concert series from April 5-14, is directed by the visual artist and film director Steve McQueen (“12 Years a Slave”) and will feature 25 up-and-coming musicians, five per night, playing roughly 15-minute sets. The performers’ mandate is to view the past from the present, placing songs of their own alongside music that influenced them. Their individual artistic paths are intended to add up to an expansive musical constellation. At first, Mr. McQueen said, he had imagined presenting an orderly linear musical progression, from the African rhythms that survived in Congo Square in New Orleans to the present. But America’s musical history made him reconsider. “It’s not linear,” he said. “It goes back on itself, it goes left, and it goes right. Is the wind linear? Sometimes it blows back and forth. It’s like a garden more than anything else. Things are sprouting up all over the place.” The opening-night roster includes Jon Batiste, the bandleader for “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert,” and PJ Morton, the Grammy-winning keyboardist from Maroon 5; other nights feature the rapper Smino; the Grammy-winning blues-rocker Fantastic Negrito; the blues-rooted guitarist Melanie Faye; and the idiosyncratic R&B songwriters Moses Sumney and Eryn Allen Kane. The Shed sought out musicians who are thoroughly conscious of forebears and possibilities. Serpentwithfeet — the self-described “pagan gospel” songwriter Josiah Wise — is on the bill April 9. “This show holds a different place in my heart,” he said. “I’ve always been a fan of not just black music itself, but of the narrative of black music. I’m thinking about the music of today, and how does that relate to the music of the 1940s, or the 1870s. I’m constantly thinking about it. I don’t have the privilege not to. Black music isn’t just decorative. It always has a lot of legwork.” The musicians will be backed by a house band — including horns and strings when needed — led by Greg Phillinganes, the prolifically recorded session keyboardist who has been the musical director for Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder onstage, among many others. The music, Mr. Phillinganes said, will be unmistakably live. “This is an Auto-Tune-free zone,” he said. Mr. McQueen intends the staging to focus on musicians at work. “We want to get as close to the bone as possible, to get to the idea of performance rather than any idea of spectacle,” he said. “I want to see the sweat. I want to see the tears. I don’t need glitter. I don’t need smoke.” The brain trust choosing and advising the performers also includes the history-making producer Quincy Jones, along with two younger producers, Dion Wilson (better known as No I.D., who produced Jay-Z’s album “4:44” and tracks for Kanye West, Drake, Common and Nas) and Tunji Balogun, an executive producer for H.E.R. and Khalid. Building Soundtrack of America was a labyrinthine process. To program the Shed, Mr. Poots cast a wide net of ideas — to, among others, Mr. McQueen, with whom he had curated projects in England. One day Mr. McQueen “phoned me out of the blue,” Mr. Poots recalled at an interview in the Shed’s temporary New York City offices. “He said: ‘Imagine hearing the history of African-American music. Imagine a family tree, and you hear from when the boats arrive, and African-American music starts happening all over the country, right up to now.” Mr. Poots immediately wanted to make that the Shed’s grand opening project, forthrightly declaring that African-American music was central to modern culture. “The minute the idea was hatched, this was going to be it,” he said. “I had absolutely no idea how to do it, and Steve really didn’t, but he said, ‘Let’s just start.’” Instead of a gala opening featuring superstars, Soundtrack of America will present emerging musicians. “We didn’t think it was strange,” Mr. Poots said. “But people have pointed out, ‘Who launches a new arts center with 25 pretty much unknown musicians?’ To me, it was a logical conclusion to the idea and the goal that Steve had set down.” Mr. McQueen and Mr. Poots, who are both British, knew they needed American perspectives and solid academic underpinnings, so they called on an expert: Maureen Mahon, a cultural anthropologist and associate professor at N.Y.U. who concentrates on African-American music. She oversaw a “family tree” — intended as a suggestion, not a canon — of music: from unrecorded African-American music through work songs, spirituals, blues, jazz, swing, bebop, R&B, rock ’n’ roll, hip-hop and onward. A panel of other advisers included the journalist Nelson George and musicologists with specialties ranging from current trap back to little-documented slavery-era music.  The family tree went out to the performers, but beyond that tree, musicians didn’t receive assignments; they defined their own musical genealogy. “It’s hard to pick fruit from such an amazing tree, but no matter which one I pick, I know it’s going to be sweet,” said Tarriona Ball, a.k.a. Tank, the frontwoman of New Orleans poetry-funk-jazz band Tank and the Bangas. “Or maybe even a little bitter, because the history isn’t always so clean.” PJ Morton, who grew up in New Orleans, plans to incorporate prime New Orleans R&B and Stevie Wonder in his set. “It’s a beautiful thing that we can be influenced by everything now,” he said. “But I do think it’s important to know that these are real people and real things, and to understand how we got here.”  The jazz-soul singer and songwriter Sy Smith is hoping to dovetail her father’s doo-wop, her classical music studies, the go-go music she heard while attending Howard University, the mixtape culture of early hip-hop and her current jazz-tinged mode. “I want people to appreciate that we all come from different places to end up where we are,” she said.  The initial five concerts may not be the end of Soundtrack of America. It will be filmed in a five-camera shoot; it could spin off an educational app. And given the infinitude of African-American music old and new, it could lead to additional concerts in many formats as the Shed welcomes culture without tuxedos. “I don’t view our first five concerts as the endgame,” Mr. Poots said. “That's the starting point. We could do this for years.” "

Javier Camarena sang 18 high C’s at the Metropolitan Opera on Thursday evening. Read all about it, and watch: This week the New York Philharmonic announced its 2019-20 season, and we writers came together to make a list of our highlights. Or pre-highlights, perhaps. There’s some good stuff! And Tony Tommasini, our chief critic, offered some lovely memories of working with the American baritone Sanford Sylvan, who died last week: I reviewed an austere but moving revival of Robert Ashley’s opera “Improvement (Don Leaves Linda),” which I’d highly recommend. (It runs through Feb. 16.) Take a listen to the piece: And I’ll leave you with Scriabin’s Piano Concerto, which Daniil Trifonov will play with the New York Phil next season. Here’s a lucid, feeling recording with Pierre Boulez conducting Anatol Ugorski and the Chicago Symphony. Enjoy! ZACHARY WOOLFE Finally, the overlap in the Venn diagram of Arnold Schoenberg and bluegrass music is getting a bit larger, thanks to “(Gimme Some of That) Ol’ Atonal Music,” by the country prankster Merle Hazard. The whole thing made me smile, but it was his high-pitched, Bob Wills-ian “Aha” during the atonal banjo solo that made me crack up. MICHAEL COOPER Instead of watching the State of the Union address on Tuesday, I heard Messiaen’s “Quartet for the End of Time” in the crypt of a church. As part of the Crypt Sessions series at the Church of the Intercession in Harlem, the piece got a mystical and moving performance from a makeshift group: Yoonah Kim, clarinet; Orion Weiss, piano; Stefan Jackiw, violin; and Jay Campbell, cello. They played with the synchronicity of a seasoned ensemble, nailing exposed and dangerous passages like the octave runs in the “Interlude” and “Tangle of Rainbows.” In the extreme intimacy of the crypt, you could hear the click-clack of the clarinet’s keys, and the airy sounds of bows on strings. Up close, the quartet seemed to deal only in disorienting extremes, like the alternating alarms and chirps, both chilling and playful, in “Abyss of the Birds,” a lengthy solo played with inexhaustible virtuosity by Ms. Kim. And proximity lifted “Praise to the Eternity of Jesus,” a duet for cello and piano (heard here in a luxury-casting album from 2017), to the sublime. JOSHUA BARONE Yuja Wang’s regular partnership with the violinist Leonidas Kavakos isn’t the place to hear the sustained stretches of imaginative power that characterize her solo-piano concerts. On their recording of the Brahms violin sonatas — and at their gripping recital at Carnegie Hall on Wednesday — it’s possible to sense Ms. Wang pulling back on the throttle. Which isn’t a bad thing; it can be a revelation to hear this bold pianist in a collaborative setting. That quality of reserve can also make Ms. Wang’s occasional lurch into more demonstrative playing all the more shocking. On Wednesday, her florid energy found a moment for expression during Brahms’s Violin Sonata No. 2. During the middle movement’s “Vivace di più” section, the rhythmic charge Ms. Wang put into select chords made it feel as though she could vault into Stravinsky’s “Petrouchka” transcription at any second. She didn’t, of course — and Mr. Kavakos’s steely sense of purpose kept the performance from losing its overall form. But it was a reminder of how thoroughly Ms. Wang can transform a familiar work. SETH COLTER WALLS Recently, over five days in New York, three pianists at very different stages of their careers gave remarkable recitals. Leon Fleisher celebrated his 90th birthday with musician friends at Zankel Hall. Jeremy Denk, 48 and in his prime, concluded a varied program (literally: he offered theme and variation pieces by Beethoven, Mendelssohn and John Adams) at Carnegie Hall with a magnificent account of Schumann’s Fantasy in C. And Behzod Abduraimov, 28, appeared at the 92nd Street Y. This fast-rising Uzbek pianist, who combines prodigious technique with a feeling for color and youthful temperament, gave a stunning account of Liszt’s formidable Sonata in B minor.  But his overeagerness came through in 10 Pieces from Prokofiev’s “Romeo and Juliet.” There were captivating moments but also passages of slam-bang steeliness. Perhaps he had trouble adjusting to the Y’s intimacy; he has said that he prefers big spaces. Mr. Abduraimov can certainly play with wondrous fleetness, clarity and imagination, as he did in his encore, Liszt’s “La Campanella.” Just listen to him in this excerpt from a 2015 performance in Munich.

ZACHARY WOOLFE The director Dmitri Tcherniakov’s opera productions often end with a plot twist. His latest, Berlioz’s “Les Troyens” for the Paris Opera, ends with two. Gone is the nationalism — even much of the Romanticism — that courses through Berlioz’s grand opera. Mr. Tcherniakov’s approach, which runs through Feb. 12 (and let’s hope for a live stream at some point), aims for something more intimate, psychologically rich and, ultimately, wrenching. I haven’t been able to get it out of my mind. The first two acts, which depict the fall of Troy, place the action in a wartime cityscape, with coldly gray buildings juxtaposed with the brightly lit, wood-paneled interior of the royal family’s home. Instead of a Trojan horse, there is a horse as metaphor: Énée (Brandon Jovanovich, indefatigable) makes a coup-like deal with the Greeks that goes awry, leaving Troy in ruins and him in flight with his surviving comrades. Acts III through V take place in Carthage, which in Mr. Tcherniakov’s staging is a war-rehabilitation facility where patients are treated with yoga, breathing exercises and role-playing. One of those games involves declaring Didon (Ekaterina Semenchuk) the queen, complete with a cute paper crown, ruff and cape. Both she and Énée are damaged goods: Trauma has left her with crippling depression, while he arrives shouting nationalistic rallying cries at a wall. Berlioz’s sweeping epic become a tale of insurmountable illness. The lines between playacting and reality begin to blur. Didon and Énée do fall in love, though without ever touching during their duet “Nuit d’ivresse.” But he, hearing voices and teeming with toxic masculinity, hubristically leaves for Rome. She is left alone to sing her swan song, “Adieu, fière cité,” while downing a bottle of pills and putting back on her childlike crown and cape. It’s pathetic, and devastating. Fade to black — but then the lights come on: In what seems like a typical Tcherniakov move, Didon appears not to have died at all. The role-playing exercise instead continues, with the chorus narrating Didon’s climactic funeral pyre and the birth of Rome. But Didon seems a bit out of sync with the crowd — woozy, fading. The pills were real after all; she collapses as the score comes to its mighty end. Without changing a word, Mr. Tcherniakov turned this sprawling tale, of romance amid the fall and rise of civilizations, into an all-too-real story about two people who, ravaged by suffering, fail to ever recover. JOSHUA BARONE Last Friday at Roulette in Brooklyn, members of the Tri-Centric Vocal Ensemble celebrated the release of their new 12-disc set of works by Anthony Braxton (who, as I reported in January, is on a creative tear). At Roulette, the group performed Composition No. 255, an item from Mr. Braxton’s “Ghost Trance Music” catalog. When the ensemble recorded this same piece for the CD release, they took advantage of Mr. Braxton’s invitation to thread other of his compositions throughout. At Roulette, they doubled down on this collage-style layering — including lines of dialogue from Mr. Braxton’s recent opera “Trillium J.” The idiosyncratic pulsing style that introduces Composition No. 255 was a reminder of how instantly recognizable Mr. Braxton’s music is. Yet this particular performance’s increased emphasis on ambient complexity underlined the creative role he encourages performers to claim. A second set at Roulette, this one devoted to Mr. Braxton’s “Echo Echo Mirror House Music,” was even more notable in this regard. Past performances of the “Echo” pieces have relied on iPods, which were used to pipe in specific vintage recordings of Mr. Braxton’s other works. Here, however, the bassist and electronic musician Carl Testa used a new electroacoustic setup — designed in collaboration with the composer — to control the playback files. Alongside the pianist Cory Smythe, who played some of Mr. Braxton’s 1970s solo piano music, Mr. Testa oversaw a head-spinning, surround-sound environment that felt more immersive than past two-channel stereo recordings of the “Echo” pieces. On Saturday, Wadada Leo Smith, a longtime associate of Mr. Braxton’s, brought his Golden Quintet to the Appel Room, inside Jazz at Lincoln Center, for the New York premiere of selections from his suite “America’s National Parks.” During the early set on Saturday, this music seemed less fiery than on the version Mr. Smith and his group recorded for a 2016 release.  But there were innumerable passages of delicate beauty — often featuring the quintet’s cellist, Ashley Walters. Ms. Walters also figures prominently in Mr. Smith’s forthcoming CD release of another extended composition: “Rosa Parks: Pure Love. An Oratorio of Seven Songs.” On an advance clip posted to SoundCloud, you can hear Ms. Walters’s playing amid trumpets, electronics and a solo turn from the violinist Shalini Vijayan.

Its resulting legacy has been mixed — from slickly produced multiday affairs to unmitigated disasters, like the Fyre Festival — but the wildfire-spread of festivals since has led to an increasing number of exciting, smaller-scale events organized each year.  These eight U.S.-based music festivals are notable for their stunning settings, extracurricular programming and highly curated, alternative lineups. Marfa Myths is a collaboration between Ballroom Marfa, a nonprofit cultural arts space, and the Brooklyn-based record label Mexican Summer. Since it began four years ago, in a West Texas town internationally recognized for its art and culture, Marfa Myths has showcased a diverse roster of under-the-radar talent. Expect the same this year, with acts like Khruangbin and Cass McCombs. And don’t miss the art exhibitions around town. PRO TIP “Bring boots, and hydrate!” advises Sarah Melendez, the Ballroom Marfa program director. Booking accommodations and meal reservations in advance is a must, too.

But those differences stop at accommodations; No V.I.P. sections or access are available otherwise. May 10-12 in Arcosanti, Az. $379 for a weekend pass, basic camping included; glamping add-ons start at $349 It’s the 10th anniversary of this scrappy festival organized by Gundlach Bundschu winery, Eric D. Johnson of the Fruit Bats and FolkYeah!, a Northern California music promoter. Held on the winery grounds, Huichica keeps attendance tight — just 600-800 people are there at any given time. (No worries: Additional festivals are planned later this year for the Hudson Valley and Washington state). Musical highlights this year include Love, Kelly Stoltz, and Lee Fields and the Expressions. It’s an intimate environment: Expect to see musicians watching the show, not hiding out backstage. KIDS WELCOMED While Huichica is not a children’s festival, it’s decidedly family-friendly, with a dedicated kid zone that makes it easy for parents to start them young. June 7-8 in Sonoma, Calif. From $155 for a weekend pass; children under 12 attend free Wilco lovers unite at this festival highlighting Jeff Tweedy and company’s current musical favorites. This year, Courtney Barnett, The Feelies and Tortoise will join Wilco, plus band members’ solo work. The musical performances are integrated within Mass MoCA’s expansive grounds and contemporary art collection. Not into art? Festival goers can attend an axe-throwing workshop, or for a more sedate activity, attend a panel featuring Jon Hamm and John Hodgman. EARLY BIRD GETS THE ART Attendees are advised to arrive before the shows to best explore the museum; you’ll be better equipped to seek out last-minute musician pop-ups, which are often announced on Twitter. June 28-30 in North Adams, Mass. From $189 for a weekend pass; day passes from $74-$129 With a zero-waste ethos, the Pickathon festival combines art, architecture, food and music. Its Treeline Stage is designed annually by architecture students using sustainable materials (last year’s stage was later used to build homeless shelters). This year, the lineup includes Nathaniel Rateliff and the Night Sweats, Phil Lesh, and The Preservation Hall Jazz Band, and will be bracketed by morning yoga, late-night dance parties and a street art showcase. EAT UP Join a Curation Series dinner, a communal, sit-down dinner party for 100 that pairs cuisine from top Pacific Northwest chefs and live music (tickets on sale in April). Aug. 2-4 in Happy Valley, Ore. From $325 for an adult weekend pass; early entry add-on for $90 The interactive artists’ collective Meow Wolf organized Taos Vortex last year to bring mind-bending art installations and musical performances to Kit Carson Park, walking distance from downtown Taos. Year two boasts more acts reflecting New Mexico’s diverse population (the full lineup will be announced April 2) and no shortage of art you can touch. Camping is available for 1,000 (out of 6,000 expected attendees) and Max Beck-Keller of Meow Wolf encourages all to “inhabit the space, make it your home.” ADVENTURE TIME To highlight the beauty of Taos, the festival organizes outdoor adventures including balloon rides and paddle boarding on the Rio Grande.  Aug. 16-18 in Taos, N.M. From $199 for a three-day pass with camping, $179 without; day passes from $79 Afropunk Brooklyn is entering its 20th year celebrating black culture. With a musical lineup ranging from jazz to hard-core hip-hop, the two-day festival also boasts the Spinthrift Market, a destination for art, fashion and hair products, plus the live Solutions Sessions talks featuring likes of Ava Duvernay and Terence Nance. Despite having grown in scope and size — the weekend sees 60,000 attendees — the co-founder Matthew Morgan notes that positive vibes have persisted. STRAIGHT FROM THE LOWER LATITUDES Expect to hear acts from Johannesburg and other areas of South Africa thanks to an Afropunk expansion into that country. Aug. 24-25 in Brooklyn. From $110 for a weekend pass; from $60 for single day According to the co-founder Melissa Auf der Maur, the eclectic nature of Soundscape (which can range “from grindcore to poetry”) is largely dictated by the venue. A factory turned art space, Basilica Hudson offers a striking canvas for Soundscape’s blend of music, visual art and readings. The venue and the limited crowd (capped at 1,200 people) are meant to capture the feeling of musical and artistic discovery in a pre-Internet age. UPSTATE OF MIND Attendees are encouraged to take the train (book early) and leave room for exploring Hudson. The Half Moon, a local bar, hosts a festival after-party each night.

I went west last weekend to hear Esa-Pekka Salonen’s first concerts with the band he’ll soon take over, the San Francisco Symphony. It was an exciting evening, with the promise of a happy marriage: intense, committed yet self-effacing playing from a very good orchestra. Mr. Salonen brought over Anna Thorvaldsdottir’s “Metacosmos,” which he led with the New York Philharmonic last year: It’s a sly, darkly gorgeous piece, and a perfect complement to Strauss’s “Also Sprach Zarathustra.” Sibelius’s “Four Legends from the Kalevala” (also known as the “Lemminkäinen Suite”) ended things with color: lithe brooding and taut energy. Speaking of the New York Phil, this weekend is bringing the premiere performances of Julia Wolfe’s “Fire in my mouth,” about the 1911 Triangle shirtwaist factory fire. Michael Cooper did a lovely piece walking around with Ms. Wolfe and shopping for an unusual instrument: scissors. And before I sign off, a treasure: The great baritone Ettore Bastianini was just 44 when he died of cancer, on Jan. 25, 1967. He deserves deep listening, and here’s a start: Enjoy the weekend. ZACHARY WOOLFE Hello from Paris, where so far this week I have been to a sleepy concert by Paavo Järvi and the Orchestre de Paris (missing its soloist Radu Lupu, who was replaced at the last minute by Nelson Goerner in Beethoven’s Fourth Piano Concerto) and the premiere of a new production of Scarlatti’s “Il Primo Omicidio” at the Paris Opera. This Baroque oratorio, staged inside the Baroque-inspired Palais Garnier, was directed by Romeo Castellucci — more on that next week — and conducted by René Jacobs, who recorded the piece with the Akademie für Alte Musik Berlin in the late 1990s. (On that album, he also sang the countertenor role of God.)  Here, he led the Belgian ensemble B’Rock, with a beefed-up orchestration to more easily fill the Garnier. Normally I would be skeptical of expanding an orchestra simply for volume; it risks sacrificing the score’s details and texture. But, under Mr. Jacobs’s baton, B’Rock still sounded like a small chamber orchestra: nimble, clear, precise. And restrained, reserving its most powerful sound for dramatic effect, which added a sense of theater to a piece whose plot often verges on inertia. JOSHUA BARONE Thursday would have been the 100th birthday of the composer, pianist and conductor Leon Kirchner, who died at 90 in 2009. One of the most comprehensive musicians of his day, he was a valued teacher during a long career at Harvard. As a composer, Mr. Kirchner demonstrated that one could write works of rigorous complexity employing modernist techniques but in an instinctive, richly expressive, viscerally dramatic way.  Though steeped in the dodecaphonic music of his beloved teacher Schoenberg, Kirchner never used the 12-tone system strictly. Just hints of the aesthetic run through this mysterious slow movement from Kirchner’s Second String Quartet (1958), beautifully performed here by the Orion Quartet. Bartok and Stravinsky where also major influences, as the punchy opening movement of Kirchner’s First Piano Concerto (1953) make clear in this 1956 performance featuring the composer at the piano, with Mitropoulos conducting the New York Philharmonic.  Some musical highlights of my years living in Boston were the concerts Mr. Kirchner conducted with the Harvard Chamber Orchestra. He was not the tidiest technician. But he led scores by Mozart, Beethoven, Brahms and contemporary giants like a fellow composer who completely understood how the piece at hand worked. ANTHONY TOMMASINI Any ensemble making its American debut is likely to feel some jitters, especially when the program includes a masterpiece as dense and thorny as Beethoven’s Op. 130. But on Sunday, members of the Maxwell String Quartet had an additional reason for feeling a little, well, vulnerable. Addressing the audience at the New School, the group’s cellist, Duncan Strachan, explained why. “I must say,” he said, “this is a very high stage for kilts.” Flashes of thigh, and wit, are not the only reason to take note of the Maxwell Quartet, which hails from Scotland and advertises that fact both in its dress and in its repertory, which includes striking arrangements of folk music. (As the sole Englishman in the lineup, the violist Elliott Perks wore tartan trousers.) As Sunday’s eloquent performance demonstrated, the players bring the same charisma and sense of adventure to their selections. The slightly tart, resiny sound of traditional fiddle playing carried over beautifully into fresh readings of Haydn and into the Beethoven. But perhaps the most arresting moment was James MacMillan’s “Memento” from 1994, in which wisps of a melody floated on hazy harmonies and coalesced into heaving sighs before dissolving again into ghostly strains, rendered with a kind of fierce tenderness.

5ca4f29849f0eacbf1f80a53,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/03/arts/music/public-records-gowanus-music-scene.html,"On the second floor of a stately brick building across the street from the Gowanus Canal, an electrical wire dangled over a dusty desk on a recent Monday afternoon, and the sounds of light construction drifted through an open doorway. Until last year, this rather remote building had been home to Retrofret, a niche guitar repair shop. But now it was just weeks away from becoming Public Records, a state-of-the-art music venue and watering hole that hopes to become a beacon for a neighborhood in flux. The club’s three youngish partners — Francis Harris, Shane Davis and Erik VanderWal — sat around the desk along with the saxophonist Rob Reddy, who will be booking an ongoing weekly jazz series there, and explained their idea. During the day, Public Records will serve as a vegan cafe, and at night as a bar. On weekends and many weeknights, the back room will host concerts. The audio systems throughout the space will be profoundly high-fidelity, and at the bar a different record collector will spin vinyl each evening. “We want to be a community-based performance space that supports avant-garde or experimental music, while at the same time feels like a neighborhood spot,” said Mr. Harris, the member of the triumvirate in charge of all things musical. Public Records is perched at the northern tip of Gowanus, a postindustrial neighborhood of warehouses and former factories along the edge of the East River, hidden away between the tonier Park Slope and Carroll Gardens. Gowanus has long been hospitable to small manufacturing businesses and artists seeking affordable studio space, but it tends to clear out at night. Club owners prize the cheap rent, but often have trouble drawing a crowd for gigs. “There’s not a built-in audience. You have to bring your own crowd,” said the trombonist and pianist Brian Drye, who runs iBeam, a cooperative studio and performance space about 10 blocks south of Public Records. “Generally what works best here is music that has smaller audiences, and requires an attentive listening crowd.” Still, a small syndicate of offbeat stages has sprouted up across the neighborhood in the last decade, helping to fill a vacuum left by the disappearance of experimental music clubs in the Lower East Side and the East Village. (Tonic and Fez closed in the early 2000s, and the Knitting Factory eventually decamped to a smaller space in Williamsburg. The Stone left last year to be absorbed into the New School.) iBeam is run by the roughly two-dozen musicians who use it to rehearse and teach. Mr. Drye started the club 11 years ago when an adult student offered to rent him an empty space that he owned on Seventh Street, just a half block off the canal. (A similar institution, the Douglas Street Music Collective, also run by jazz musicians, sprang up soon after but eventually closed down.) On weekday evenings, members of the iBeam cooperative present their own music there; on weekends, Drye books other acts — typically a mix of outré improvisers and young composers looking to showcase new work. In 2012, the bassist Matthew Garrison and the entrepreneur Fortuna Sung opened ShapeShifter Lab around the corner from iBeam. It was founded as a music club, but attendance was not strong enough for it to survive on shows alone. So Ms. Sung and Mr. Garrison have turned it into a flexible event space and recording studio. As the neighborhood around it has gradually grown more residential, it has begun to host weddings, bar mitzvahs and student recitals as well as regular concerts: “Shape-shifting with the hood,” Mr. Garrison said in a recent interview. The shifts have been slow, partly thanks to zoning laws, which have warded off rapid real-estate development while keeping the area friendly to the small businesses that use it for storage and light manufacturing. As a result, while many artists have work spaces in Gowanus, few actually live there. But with Public Records open, the area may start to have more of a nighttime ecosystem. In nearby Red Hook, Pioneer Works has become one of New York’s essential multi-arts spaces, and in Park Slope, just three avenues over from iBeam, Barbés is one of Brooklyn’s most creatively curated pint-size music rooms. Public Records will have a different feel from all these places. Its team is devoted to craft comforts: The space has high-flown ceilings and elegant, exposed concrete. Walls are lined with wood panels to help improve the acoustics. The food will all come from Henry Rich, the local restaurateur behind Rucola, who will run a commissary kitchen in the building. And the team is also devoted to flexibility. Mr. Harris imagines that Mr. Reddy’s Wednesday-night jazz series — which will be in the barroom, rather than the back — might open the door to more spontaneous musical happenings throughout the week. “Our hopes were to create an environment where great players can drop in and do a set,” Mr. Harris said. Public Records’ early bookings for performances in the main space include Damo Suzuki, the Japanese musician known for his stint singing with Can; the ambient-music giant Laraaji; and the minimalist techno artist Jan Jelinek. It isn’t a rock room or a dance hall, and it’s not a jazz club. You could think of Public Records as a kind of genre-agnostic music festival in residence (like Big Ears in Brooklyn), or as a contemporary expansion on what Tokyo’s jazz record-spinning cafes used to be. It’s a little bit of both. “I come from a jazz and creative-music background, and I’ve seen a lot of venues come and go really quickly,” Mr. Reddy said. He remembered that the Knitting Factory in particular had felt like “a home base where you could go any night of the week and hang,” and said that he senses “a real hunger” for something similar again today: something as reliable as it is eclectic. “I wanted to be conscious of programming artists of different ages, different genders and different races,” he said, listing some of the jazz musicians that he’s already lined up to perform: James Brandon Lewis, Patricia Brennan, Adam O’Farrill. “I wanted it to be inclusive — as inclusive as I could.” "

On Sunday they perform Bruckner’s Symphony No. 7. On Monday the main event is Salonen’s own Cello Concerto, with Truls Mork as the soloist, in between Sibelius’s “The Oceanides” and Stravinsky’s “The Firebird.” 212-721-6500, lincolncenter.org/great-performers BEATRICE RANA at Zankel Hall (March 12, 7:30 p.m.).

See for yourself in these two performances of the first drama of Wagner’s “Ring.” There are potential high points among the cast: Norbert Ernst and Gerhard Siegel will likely be ideal as Loge and Mime; Günther Groissböck excels in everything he sings, including Fasolt; and there’s the prospect of Jamie Barton’s Fricka, too.

Grimly compelling this year, the Prototype festival of new music theater continues through Sunday, so get on it. The shows I saw last weekend are done on Saturday, so really get on it: And if you’re in Los Angeles (lucky you), check out the L.A. Phil, which is performing Philip Glass’s Symphony No. 12 — settings of lyrics from David Bowie’s album “Lodger” — under the baton of John Adams on Friday and Sunday. I spoke with Mr. Adams and Mr. Glass about the work: In other news: — The Metropolitan Opera’s “Aida” revival is a mess; “Carmen” is rather better. — The New York Philharmonic plays too damn loud. — The baritone Benjamin Appl is a Schubert whiz. Let’s play you out with Maria Callas’s “Aida” Triumphal Scene high E flat. Greet the weekend like she greets the closing of that Act II curtain! ZACHARY WOOLFE The welcome revival of interest in the composer Florence Price continues this week, with the release of a buoyant recording of her First and Fourth symphonies, with the Fort Smith Symphony of Arkansas conducted by John Jeter. Both works bear trace influences of folk forms — including, as the musicologist Douglas W. Shadle writes in the liner notes, a reference to “Wade in the Water” during the Fourth’s opening movement. But there are as many sections that seem like a composer channeling her own individual muse. Among the most compelling moments is the close of the Fourth — a scherzo full of slaloming melody (and, in the final minutes, some pleasingly potent tutti chords). SETH COLTER WALLS It says something that a song cycle of despair, heartbreak, alienation and yearning for death has become an anthem of our unsettled times. Schubert’s mournful “Winterreise,” which he worked on up to his death at 31, has been a regular feature of recent New York seasons, sung by some of the world’s greatest singers. I have seen stagings of the cycle, but I have never seen a performance more theatrical than the one the German baritone Benjamin Appl gave, without any props at all, on Thursday in the Park Avenue Armory’s intimate Board of Officers Room. It was the kind of vocal acting — fearlessly physical, with a broad palette of tones and styles, and a willingness to go for the occasional unbeautiful moment when called for by the text — that could devolve into histrionics. But Mr. Appl was utterly convincing. He made a vivid miniature of each song. For “Frühlingstraum,” Mr. Appl brought out the Jekyll-and-Hyde contrast terrifyingly. After singing the sweet opening passage, a vision of merry birds in a May meadow, he seemed to turn on a dime, changing his voice and bearing to deliver the shock of the next section: a bitter waking nightmare of crowing roosters, shrieking ravens and loneliness. It was only in those ferocious moments that you realized his foreshadowing: How, even in the loveliest passages of the song’s opening, there had been something unhinged in his voice, and his eyes.

Sign up here to get it delivered to your inbox. Let me know what you think at dearmaya@nytimes.com. “I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it.”— Ariana Grande Bills flying. Backsides shaking. Drinks flowing. And hardly a man in sight.  For as long as there have been music videos, there have been male artists flaunting their riches with zero subtlety and surrounding themselves with gyrating, nearly naked women. But in the past few weeks, two of the world’s most powerful pop stars — women — have reimagined the played-out concept by keeping the outrageous displays of wealth and women’s bodies, but cutting men out of the picture, literally. Ariana Grande and Cardi B, who are up for a collective seven Grammys on Sunday night, recently released videos just weeks apart, in which they expertly extracted the testosterone — in front of and behind the camera. (Both videos were directed by women.)  And while both stars are coming off high-profile breakups, neither song is a lament of lost love, or anything close to it. In fact, the lyrics barely mention men at all.  [Sign up here to get this column, In Her Words, delivered as a newsletter to your inbox.] “Young women right now have a kind of outlaw energy in our public sphere,” Ann Powers, NPR Music’s critic, told me this week. “Economic independence is a central part of their sexiness, a central part of their glamour,” she said.  The video for “7 Rings,” by Grande, whose new album dropped today, is dedicated entirely to her staggering wealth, which she boasts about defiantly — lavishing herself and her band of tattooed, braid-whipping besties with drinks and diamonds.  “I don’t mean to brag, but I be like, ‘Put it in the bag,’” sings Grande, 25, about reaching a level of success that allows her to buy whatever she wants. In “Money,” Cardi B presents a hyper-glam, gold-encrusted, nudity-packed celebration of cash and the women proudly in pursuit of it.  The video famously includes a scene where she is breast-feeding her baby, peppered amid images of women shooting money guns and dancing on poles while other women (and only women) shower them in bills.  “I don’t really need the D, I need the money,” Cardi B, 26, raps.  The messages Grande and Cardi B are sending — these recent music videos have about 140 million and 45 million views on YouTube — may feel new and particularly relevant in this era, but music has a storied history of female artists flexing their independence and money, Powers said.  In the 1920s, the blues artists Bessie Smith and Ma Rainey sang about having money of their own and being supported by other women. (Rainey’s nickname was “the gold-neck woman” because she piled on gold jewelry.) Then there were Aretha Franklin, Janis Joplin, Dolly Parton, Annie Lennox and Madonna, among others, who have been forces of women’s empowerment in pop music. More recently, we have Beyoncé and Rihanna leading the feminist charge in pop by celebrating other women and being unapologetic about their success and their sexuality.  Despite all that, the music business remains male-dominated, Powers said. But these women — and more of them — are increasingly saying, “‘O.K., we’re going to do it for ourselves.’” ______ Our gender editor, Jessica Bennett, writes:  “Long before the age of Twitter, ‘Letters to the Editor’ sections of newspapers were how citizens engaged in public discourse. And yet those letters — like their more modern counterpart, the comments sections — remain predominantly written by men. (By our rough estimate, women account for about a quarter of New York Times letters submissions — although they do tend to write in greater numbers about issues like education, health, gender and children.)  Earlier this month, The Times said it would strive for parity in its Letters section. And we need your help to make it happen. Got anything you’d like to tell us, or women you think would make great letter writers? See our guidelines for submission at the link in bio. We hope to hear from you soon!” ______ Here are five articles from The Times you might have missed. “She subscribed to every surf magazine but found them boring because they featured action shots of only boys and men.” The fight for gender equality in one of the most dangerous sports on earth. [Read the story] “When a sister becomes pregnant, the priest insists that she have an abortion.” The sexual abuse of nuns by Catholic priests and bishops has for years been overshadowed by other scandals. [Read the story] “Women can choose to knock each other down or build each other up.” The White House is to unveil a global women’s empowerment initiative, led by Ivanka Trump. [Read the story] “He was looking for how to be, in kind of a pure way.” Years before weighing a 2020 presidential run, Beto O’Rourke faced a quarter-life reckoning as a punk rocker (and live-in nanny) in New York City. [Read the story] “Our stereotype about women who are giving care and friendliness in a gentle, intimate way is linked with our image of women being sexual.” A.S.M.R. videos give people the tingles (no, not that way). [Read the story] ______ Once upon a time, Beyoncé didn’t rule the music world — or at least The Times didn’t think that she did, or that she would. In this 2003 article, the music critic Kelefa Sanneh reviewed Beyoncé’s debut solo album, “Dangerously in Love” and Ashanti’s “Chapter II,” which were released a week apart.  About Beyoncé, he wrote: “Maybe this album is merely a misstep, and maybe Beyoncé has yet to record the brilliant solo album that people expected. Or maybe it's proof that she isn’t quite as versatile as she seemed.” “Dangerously in Love” went on to become a multiplatinum album, selling over 15 million copies worldwide.

Dance music’s euphoria and church music’s rapture have been conceptual relatives for years, but Ms. English’s joyful 12-inch singles often made the connection explicit, speaking plainly about her Christianity and soaring with the fervor of gospel music. Like house music itself — a form of electronic dance music that emerged in the early 1980s — Ms. English was born in Chicago. But she became best known through her relationship with New York garage, a strain of dance music that embraced lush production and melodies more amenable to gospel and soul. Her breakthrough was “Nite Life,” a 1994 12-inch disc given a luxurious mix by the New York garage producers Masters at Work and a harder-edged remix by Armand Van Helden. It became an enduring club staple, with Ms. English singing like Dorothy Gale back in Kansas but still dreaming of Oz: “I’m trying hard to find this place again/Lord knows, I’m glad at least I’ve been.” From 1999 to 2007, with singles like “Unspeakable Joy” and “Everyday,” Ms. English scored eight No. 1 hits on Billboard’s club/dance chart, more than chart-topping dance notables like Daft Punk, Calvin Harris and New Order. Ms. English was born on Sept. 6, 1970, to Annie (Herron) English, a schoolteacher, and Ronald English, a corrections officer. She went to high school at Kenwood Academy in Chicago, studying under the famed vocal teacher Lena McLin, whose students have also included the opera baritone Mark Rucker and R. Kelly. On the list of more than 20 influences on Ms. English’s Facebook page, Ms. McLin appears first. In the early 1990s, the Chicago house D.J. Gershon Jackson brought Ms. English to the attention of the vocalist Byron Stingily of Ten City, a Chicago trio of vocalists, songwriters and producers that combined house and R&B. “Her voice actually reminded me, very much so, of Anita Baker’s voice,” Mr. Stingily said in an interview. “And to hear that smoky alto voice on a dance song, it was just so unique and so different at the time.” Her career as a dance diva took off when Mr. Stingily gave a copy of the Ten City/English collaboration “Nite Life” to Little Louie Vega of Masters at Work, who passed it along to the New York club label Nervous Records. “I did know right away the song had something special,” Mike Weiss, a founder of the label, said in an interview. “And once I knew that Masters at Work were going to be doing the remix, then it really was an automatic for me.” Masters at Work (Mr. Vega and Kenny Gonzalez, known as Kenny Dope) were in-demand remixers, and “Nite Life” was licensed to Polydor in Britain, where it hit the Top 40. In America, where house music was still an underground phenomenon, it was played at Mr. Vega’s small but influential Underground Network party at the Sound Factory Bar in Manhattan. Mr. Weiss said that Ms. English’s first live performance was there, in 1994. “And she did it in front of the key individuals and all the key tastemakers in the house music community,” he added. “She really wasn’t so comfortable onstage, and it was really putting someone in the spotlight without having had any experience in the New York community — but she did great. The song was so strong that as soon as she sang the chorus, everyone started singing along.” The Armand Van Helden remix took “Nite Life” to another level in Europe, according to Mr. Weiss. Soon, thanks to mixes and remixes, Ms. English’s voice was being matched with house heavyweights like David Morales, Mood II Swing, François K and Todd Edwards. Ms. Markusic said that once Ms. English’s production deal with Ten City was over, she wrote more of her own songs. Her first No. 1 club hit, in 1999, was a song she co-wrote, “Unspeakable Joy,” a Maurice Joshua production full of church organs and gospel-choir harmonies. In it, Ms. English testified, “When I wake up, in the morning, gets me out of bed/Keeps me running, skipping, jumping like a little kid.” “As her career and her writing got more developed, she did push more and more toward the religious base,” Mr. Weiss said. “She also wanted to have the word ‘God’ in the songs. I’m very open-minded when it comes to religion, but I did feel like having ‘God’ in a song all of a sudden, you might limit the audience a little bit.” Ms. Markusic said that for Ms. English, religion had been inseparable from music: “Every single one of the songs that she’s ever put out, whether people know it or not, they’re all related to God.” Ms. English is survived by her parents; her son, Christopher Raymond; and her brothers, Eric, Richard and Ronald. Her marriage to Kevin Raymond ended in divorce. After her last No. 1 single, “My Destiny,” in 2007, Ms. English became a full-time student at Purdue University. She earned a bachelor’s degree in child and family services and joined the historically black sorority Zeta Phi Beta. She remained active in both music and church, singing in the choir of the Family Christian Center megachurch in Munster, Ind. She was performing her own music live as recently as last year. “Kim’s mission has always been to minister to people through music,” Ms. Markusic said. “I’ve seen some amazing stories. I’ve been in situations where I’ve been in a club and had one of the club kids come up crying to Kim about how she saved her life from suicide.” Mr. Stingily put it this way: “She didn’t want to do any music that was not uplifting.” "

TONY BENNETT at Radio City Music Hall (April 13, 8 p.m.). For the better part of a century, this decorated singer from Astoria, Queens, has championed the great American songbook, bewitching audiences with renditions of pop and jazz standards by Cole Porter, Irving Berlin and others. More recently, the 20-time Grammy Award winner introduced himself to younger generations with a series of “Duets” albums, on which he sang alongside contemporary artists like Lady Gaga, John Legend and Amy Winehouse. Bennett still actively tours at the age of 92 and, per the title of his most recent book, is “just getting started.”212-465-6000, radiocity.com LAURA JANE GRACE & THE DEVOURING MOTHERS at Bowery Ballroom (April 18, 7 p.m.). This trio is a side project of Grace’s, whose work as the frontwoman of the Florida punk band Against Me! has highlighted her experiences as a transgender woman, particularly on albums like “Transgender Dysphoria Blues” and “Shape Shift With Me.” Alongside her Devouring Mothers — the drummer Atom Willard (also in Against Me!) and the bassist Marc Jacob Hudson — Grace writes more restrained songs that retain hints of her punkish invective. At this Lower East Side club, the trio will receive support from the New Jersey-based rock group Mercy Union and the Philadelphia-based noise-punk band Control Top. 212-260-4700, mercuryeastpresents.com ‘LIVE FROM HERE’ at the Town Hall (April 13, 5:45 p.m.). The mandolinist Chris Thile had already taken over hosting duties on the weekly radio variety show “A Prairie Home Companion” before its original host, Garrison Keillor, fell from grace. This rebranded program, like its predecessor, is recorded before a live audience, often traveling from its home base in St. Paul to theaters around the country. Among the guests at this week’s taping in Midtown is Sara Bareilles, the pop singer behind radio hits like “Love Song” and  “King of Anything.” She shares the bill with the folk duo Milk Carton Kids and the comedian Aparna Nancherla. 212-997-6661, thetownhall.org NATALIE PRASS at Bowery Ballroom (April 17, 8 p.m.). As this singer-songwriter from Richmond, Va., knows, creating art with a political point of view can be risky. Her second album, last year’s “The Future and the Past,” was written largely in response to the 2016 presidential election; finding a label willing to release it took her longer than she had hoped. In the past year, Prass has toured the album tirelessly, as both a headliner and a supporting artist on Kacey Musgraves’s “Oh, What a World” Tour. On this stop, she’ll perform funk-flavored pop songs like “Oh My” and “Short Court Style,” as well as more orchestral holdovers from her 2015 debut. 212-260-4700, mercuryeastpresents.com [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] PRETTY LOU’S THIRD ANNUAL CHARITY CONCERT at Irving Plaza (April 16, 6 p.m.). The New York hip-hop community rallied around the Brooklyn-based D.J., nightlife personality and Fat Joe affiliate Pretty Lou Ortega (not to be confused with the member of the 1990s rap group Lost Boyz, whose moniker he shares) after he learned he had the rare blood condition aplastic anemia, which has since developed into leukemia. In its third year, this annual showcase benefiting leukemia and A.L.S. research will feature Fat Joe and his fellow Terror Squad member Remy Ma, as well as Raekwon and Ghostface Killah of the Wu-Tang Clan, the Diplomats and others. 212-777-6800, mercuryeastpresents.com PRIESTS at Elsewhere (April 16, 8 p.m.). The members of this trio from Washington have long pushed back on the “political punk” label that critics often affix to their work; still, how they earned it is clear. The debut record from these firebrands is colored by brash guitars and the muscular vocals of their frontwoman, Katie Alice Greer, whose lyrics broach subjects like consumerism and free will. Riffing on the name of Thomas Frank’s 2004 book on the rise of populist conservatism, Priests titled their just-released follow-up “The Seduction of Kansas.” This album is similarly concerned with American politics and identity; this time, though, their sound is more polished. elsewherebrooklyn.comOLIVIA HORN EMMET COHEN TRIO at Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola (April 16, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). Cohen, 28, has a breezy, phlegmatic command at the keyboard, and a deep well of historical jazz references at his fingertips. He has worked as a side musician for such luminaries as Christian McBride and Herlin Riley, and has recorded with the elder statesmen Ron Carter and Jimmy Cobb. If he wasn’t already an obvious heir apparent to the neo-traditional jazz mantle, his win at last weekend’s 2019 American Pianists Awards ought to make it official. At Dizzy’s, he will be joined by the bassist Philip Norris and the drummer Kyle Poole. They will draw some of the night’s material from Cohen’s recent trio album, “Dirty in Detroit.”212-258-9595, jazz.org/dizzys MIHO HAZAMA AND M_UNIT at Jazz Standard (April 17, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). The crossbreeding of classical and jazz has a long history, stretching back to the Third Stream movement of the 1960s. And new approaches to this amalgam have been thick on the ground of late: Just try to count how many young jazz musicians are writing for string quartet these days. One of the boldest thinkers and most delightful composers in this vein is Hazama, who studied Western classical music in Japan before making the jump to jazz. Her chamber orchestra, m_unit, blends strings and horns and mallet percussion in service of her resplendent, highly singable compositions. At the Standard, the group will be playing selections from the recently released “Dancer in Nowhere.”212-576-2232, jazzstandard.com BEN MONDER, TONY MALABY AND TOM RAINEY at Public Records (April 17, 8 p.m.). This newly opened music club, cafe and bar in Gowanus, Brooklyn, has a high-fidelity sound setup in two different rooms. In the back, which is laid out like a typical nightclub, electronic and experimental shows run throughout the week. Every Wednesday going forward, the barroom hosts a weekly jazz series. The group playing this Wednesday is a trio featuring three esteemed, New York-based improvisers with a long history of collaboration: the dark-toned, harmonically sophisticated guitarist Ben Monder, the undersung saxophone titan Tony Malaby and the roving, idiosyncratic drummer Tom Rainey.publicrecords.nyc BRANDON ROSS’S PHANTOM STATION at the Jazz Gallery (April 12, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). Ross, a guitarist best known for his work in the jazz-rock power trio Harriet Tubman, doesn’t just play a slew of different instruments (banjo, soprano guitar, regular old electric guitar, etc.), he also ranges freely from sweet and lyrical playing to wavy, confrontational distortion. Phantom Station is not a band; it’s an opportunity for him to embrace his proclivity for newness and change. He performs under this name with a wide variety of collaborators and formations. On Friday, the ensemble will include Graham Haynes on cornet and electronics, J. T. Lewis (also a member of Harriet Tubman) on drums and Hardedge on sound design. 646-494-3625, jazzgallery.nyc STRETCH MUSIC FESTIVAL at Harlem Stage Gatehouse (April 12, 7:30 p.m.). The trumpeter Christian Scott aTunde Adjuah is about to close the book on a three-year residency at Harlem Stage. As part of that, since 2017 he has convened an annual Stretch Music Festival, comprising educational events, discussions of art and activism, and performances. (The event’s title is a reference to the way Scott refers to his own music; it’s an effort to wriggle free from the limitations of genre.) He is coming off the release last month of “Ancestral Recall,” an impressive album on which West African-derived rhythms and whispery synthesizers fortify his bristling trumpet playing and the strident, subversive poetry of Saul Williams. Friday’s festival will include performances by Scott, the saxophonist Logan Richardson and Freelance, a band that fuses contemporary R&B with backpacker hip-hop and jazz.212-281-9240, harlemstage.org JOHN ZORN’S NEW MASADA QUARTET at the Village Vanguard (April 14, 3 p.m.). Last year, Zorn, the eminent alto saxophonist and downtown arts organizer, released “The Book Beriah,” the final portion of his 613-song epic, “Masada,” a collection of experimental, often lovely compositions based in Jewish folk song, klezmer and free jazz (613 is the number of commandments, or mitzvot, in the Torah). As is the wont of this serial collaborator, Zorn featured a different ensemble on each of “Beriah’s” 10 CDs (11, including the bonus disc). Here he plays material from “Masada” in a new quartet featuring three talented improvisers: Julian Lage on guitar, Jorge Roeder on bass and Kenny Wollesen on drums. 212-255-4037, villagevanguard.comGIOVANNI RUSSONELLO "

CLAIRE CHASE at the Kitchen (March 1-2, 8 p.m.). The most important flutist of our time reaches the sixth part of “Density 2036,” her 23-year journey to create a wholly new repertoire for her instrument. Although Chase is joined by the polymath composer Tyshawn Sorey for performances of his “Bertha’s Lair,” revised after its premiere earlier in this series, the new pieces here are all by women. Olga Neuwirth’s “Magic Flu-idity” is for flute and typewriter; Pamela Z’s “Louder, Warmer, Denser” is for flute and fixed media; Phyllis Chen’s “Blood Beat” includes a part for live heartbeat; and Sarah Hennies’s “Reservoir 2: Intrusion” stars the voices of Constellation Chor.212-255-5793, thekitchen.org CHIAROSCURO QUARTET AND KRISTIAN BEZUIDENHOUT at Zankel Hall (March 4, 7:30 p.m.).

5c45a63d3a125f5075c057a4,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/21/opinion/nashville-music.html,"NASHVILLE — I am not a musician, or even an aspiring musician, but I moved to Nashville in 1987 because of music. One of my college roommates was in graduate school at Vanderbilt and invited me to visit, and my own grad school boyfriend tagged along. Haywood was, and still is, a picker himself, and he expected to fall in love with Music City; he even packed his résumé. Katy Ginanni, my college friend, lived on 17th Avenue South, in the section called Music Square West. It’s part of a rectangle of streets that collectively form Nashville’s fabled Music Row, which became the heart of Nashville’s music industry — not just country music, but also gospel music and Christian music and, in recent decades, pretty much every other kind of music. Music Row is the very definition of a cultural center, but Nashville’s cultural center didn’t spring from the mind of an urban planner. It grew up organically, as music-related businesses opened in the mid-20th century to capitalize on the growing popularity of country music. Centered on 16th and 17th Avenues, it was originally the site of recording studios (many of which have lately moved elsewhere), music-publishing firms, talent agencies, publicists and booking offices, all nestled among old bungalows and churches and human-scale commercial buildings. B.B. King and Loretta Lynn and Dolly Parton and Elvis Presley and Charley Pride all recorded there, which you probably know, but so did Bob Dylan and Neil Young and Simon & Garfunkel and the Beach Boys, which you might not. In 2015, the National Trust for Historic Preservation designated the whole district “a national treasure.” Tour buses drive up and down the streets of Music Row, their guides telling tourists the stories they came to town to hear. But the city’s explosive growth in the last decade has imperiled its own beating heart, with quaint Music Row houses and historic Music Row studios falling again and again to developers who put up fancy condominiums and trendy restaurants and shiny office buildings in their place, despite concerted efforts by individuals and historic preservation nonprofits to save the Row’s character. In 2014, we even nearly lost the iconic RCA Studio A. Back in 1987, my friend Katy’s apartment was within walking distance of the Country Music Hall of Fame (it has since moved downtown), as well as seemingly innumerable tiny “museums” dedicated to specific stars. Broke as we were, Haywood and I paid to have our picture made with a wax museum version of Dolly Parton, just to have a souvenir of our visit. It was so hot in the building that even Dolly’s wax doppelgänger is sweating in that Polaroid photo. We loved the kitsch, but what really sold us was the music. We had arrived in Nashville in time for a music festival called Summer Lights, an act-after-act marvel of unfathomable talent. Near Katy’s place on Music Row, music and cigarette smoke poured out of the neighborhood bars, and during our visit we stopped in to tap our feet and drink a beer at I don’t know how many of them. We especially loved a shabby little tavern called Bobby’s Idle Hour. Back in those days Bobby’s occupied a trailer, which I remember thinking was like a living stereotype, the kind of place that becomes the center of the story every time you talk about the time you went to Nashville. It’s nothing like the music-themed bars that now line the tourist center known as Lower Broad, where neon and big-hat country hold sway — the part of Nashville that the journalist Steve Cavendish, writing in Rolling Stone, calls the “bar industrial complex.” Bobby’s is an altogether different kind of bar. It began life in 1948 simply as the Idle Hour. By 1978, when Bobby Herald bought it and added his name to the sign, it had already been on the Row for decades, a place where songwriters and neighbors and music scouts and industry regulars gathered. On weekend afternoons, people would bring their kids to hear the music. In 2005, the Idle Hour was evicted from its longtime site — a condominium complex sits there now — and Bobby Herald and his wife, Dianne, moved the bar to its current location on 16th Avenue, eight doors down from the old trailer. Bobby died later that year, but Dianne kept the bar going. It still has autographed head shots of musicians taped to the walls, interspersed with dollar bills signed by guests. Hundreds, maybe thousands, of dollar bills, many yellowed by smoke from the years before the bar banned smoking. Lizard Thom Case, 72, bought the place in 2013 after Dianne retired, but he’d been a regular at the bar there for years before he bought it — so much of a regular that Dianne handpicked him to be Bobby’s “steward,” as Mr. Case calls himself. Even he doesn’t remember how the tradition of taping dollar bills to the walls began: “I don’t know how it started, but it grew like a fungus,” he said. His best guess: “Tourists love this place so much, they just want to leave some part of themselves here.” Visitors still come back years later, he said, and take selfies next to their own signed bills. Last summer Mr. Case’s landlord announced that he was selling the site and four adjacent buildings to a developer. (All five evicted businesses are quintessentially Music City: a clothing store called So Nashville, a guitar repair shop, a music academy, a music publisher, and Bobby’s.) Short of the kind of 11th-hour miracle that saved Studio A, Bobby’s Idle Hour (“The only live music venue on Music Row!” according to its website) would end its seven-decade run, and yet another office building would rise in its place. “Nashville doesn’t have preservation tools that other cities use as a matter of course,” Carolyn Brackett, senior field officer for the National Trust for Historic Preservation, told The Tennessean last summer. “There are practical solutions that would balance development with the preservation of Music Row’s historic fabric and retain the music businesses that fill them. We urge Mayor Briley and Metro Nashville leaders to adopt them before it’s too late.” For the current iteration of Bobby’s Idle Hour, it’s already too late. Last fall Bobby’s was named to the “Nashville 9,” an annual list of the most endangered historic places in Nashville, but this time no miracle was forthcoming. Mr. Case has until the end of the month to clear everything out. It was never his plan to retire: “If we’d been able to stay in this venue, this particular building, I could’ve kept this bar another 10 years,” he said. “I love it. I love nurturing the songwriters. I love setting up these great nights of music. It’s been my life.” I stopped by the bar on Jan. 12, the last day it was open to the public, and spoke with Josh Distad, 29, a songwriter and Minnesota native who’s been tending bar at Bobby’s for the past four years. He and three other investors, all Bobby’s regulars, had just bought the contents of the bar, along with its name, from Lizard Case. They hope to open again at a new location in the summer. Mr. Distad isn’t worried about making Bobby’s a success; Bobby’s is already a success, and he’s been studying what makes it work. But he recognizes the forces that he and his partners are up against, too. They’re considering a site just around the corner from the current Idle Hour, but there may be zoning issues to address there — it’s near a church — and other obstacles to repurposing the building as a tavern. The chief obstacle is Nashville itself. The five-year lease the building’s owner has offered is within the new owners’ price range, but they know they may well be priced out of the neighborhood again as soon as the lease is up, and they can’t afford to buy. “The real estate in this area — real estate in the city, really — is so high now that a small mom-and-pop shop just can’t succeed,” Mr. Distad said. “The lowest property we found on the market in this area is listed for a million dollars.” Even so, he believes the right place will turn up in time. The death of a neighborhood bar in a growing city is in no way a tragedy. There are much more disruptive consequences to poorly planned growth: the loss of affordable work-force housing, the destruction of a vibrant tree canopy that offsets the effects of greenhouse gases, destabilized communities and debilitating strains on aging infrastructure, among others. But cultural continuity does matter. Bobby’s Idle Hour is “part of the fabric of this town,” said Carolyn Lethgo, 29, a Middle Tennessee native and one of Mr. Distad’s co-investors. “We just want to carry on the meaning and the legacy of this place.” It’s quite a legacy. Before you even walk in the door, the big plywood guitar out front tells you that Bobby’s Idle Hour is the place you’ve been looking for, the kind of place that makes you pack up and move to a new city to start your life all over again. In part because of Bobby’s, my husband and I have been here 31 years, our entire adult lives. Jonathan Long, 72, is a songwriter from upstate New York who came here in 1971. He’s also one of the Idle Hour’s longtime bartenders: “I’ve been working here 20 years,” he told me, “but I’ve been drinking here 47.” He plans to be at work at the new Idle Hour, too, wherever it lands, even if that’s not on Music Row. I asked Mr. Long if the Nashville moment had passed, if it’s too late now for a songwriter with a dream to make a life in Nashville. He wasn’t entirely hopeless: “If it’s something you want to do, don’t even bother to come here,” he said. “If it’s something you have to do, you might want to come. But if it’s something you are, get your ass down here. It has to be who you are, or it’s not going to work.” "

THE CACTUS BLOSSOMS at Bowery Ballroom (April 11, 8 p.m.). Because of their tightly woven harmonies and rockabilly influences, this band of brothers from Minneapolis has racked up comparisons to two of music’s most celebrated siblings: the Everlys. This year, the group, comprising Page Burkum and Jack Torrey, released “Easy Way,” a record that ever-so-slightly mussed up the clean-cut sound of their 2016 label debut, but maintained a sunny outlook and retro coziness. One highlight, “Got a Lotta Love,” was written with Dan Auerbach from the Black Keys. With its heart-on-its-sleeve lyrics, it illustrates their songwriting strategy. As Torrey told Rolling Stone, singing about love is “more attractive than singing about divisive subjects.”212-260-4700, mercuryeastpresents.com ELLA VOS at Brooklyn Steel (April 10, 8 p.m.). Many women’s careers are hindered by pregnancy; this pop singer’s was propelled by it. Her best-known song, the moody, R&B-tinged track “White Noise,” centers on her experience with postpartum depression, and she has said that becoming pregnant is what gave her the courage to pursue music in the first place. The anonymity granted by Vos’s stage name (her chosen moniker roughly translates from Spanish to “she you”) further boosts her confidence, empowering her to tackle difficult material in her songs. “You Don’t Know About Me,” from her debut album, addresses women’s lack of bodily agency, and “Empty Hands,” from an EP released in January, documents the cancer treatment she recently underwent.888-929-7849, bowerypresents.com HAND HABITS at Bowery Ballroom (April 10, 8 p.m.). Meg Duffy, the songwriter behind this indie-rock project, is a musician’s musician. A product of New York’s Hudson Valley D.I.Y. community, Duffy gained a reputation in Los Angeles for shredding on demand as a go-to session guitarist and a member of Kevin Morby’s touring band. Duffy’s solo work is more restrained and reflective, as evinced on Hand Habits’ recent sophomore album, “Placeholder,” which features a softened guitar tone and raw lyrics about anxiety. After supporting Japanese Breakfast at two New York shows in January, Hand Habits return as a headliner.212-260-4700, mercuryeastpresents.com [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] HONEY DIJON at 99 Scott (April 5, 11 p.m.). “House music for me was never just about tracks,” this D.J., transgender activist and fashion darling told Vice. “It was really about creating something that was too black, too queer and too gay.” Coming of age in Chicago during the heyday of house, Honey Dijon was mentored by Derrick Carter, a pioneer of the genre. Her own style grew to be more eclectic, drawing on techno and sampling soul and pop hits, but it honors her house roots. As a performer, she strives to foster human connection through sound, channeling the sense of liberation she found in her own formative musical experiences, like sneaking into Chicago nightclubs as a teenager. tixr.com SOUNDTRACK OF AMERICA at the Shed (April 5 and 7, 8 p.m.; April 9, 8:30 p.m.; through April 14). For its opening, this flashy new interdisciplinary arts space — a cultural counterweight to the surrounding commercial development in Hudson Yards — will host five nights of concerts honoring the influence of African-American musicians. Developed by the filmmaker Steve McQueen, the series aims to explore the story of black music in America from early spirituals to today’s diverse forms. To that end, the performances in the coming week feature artists such as the jazz pianist and bandleader Jon Batiste, the rappers Smino and Rapsody, the avant-pop cellist Kelsey Lu and the R&B singer Emily King.646-455-3494, theshed.org Y LA BAMBA AND HABIBI at BRIC House Ballroom (April 11, 8 p.m.). Luz Elena Mendoza’s Mexican heritage has long informed her songwriting: As the frontwoman of Y La Bamba, she sings in both Spanish and English, taking cues from traditional musica mexicana as well as American folk songs and dream pop. Her band’s most recent album, “Mujeres,” grapples with what it means to be Mexican in the current political climate, and with the machismo entrenched in Mexican society. At this Brooklyn arts center, Y La Bamba share a bill with Habibi, another group for whom multicultural identity is a central concern. Their “Cardamom Garden” EP from last year was recorded partly in Farsi, celebrating their lead singer’s Iranian roots, and cultivated a distinctly American surf-rock vibe.718-683-5600, bricartsmedia.orgOLIVIA HORN MICHAËL ATTIAS at Greenwich House Music School (April 6, 7:30 p.m.). On Friday, Attias will release “Échos la Nuit,” an album of slow, ruminative solo recordings on which he plays both the alto saxophone (his primary instrument) and the piano. Hearing these 12 tracks is like inspecting the mysterious line drawings of a beloved artist. Sometimes you’ll almost discern the contour of a landscape or the dark shading of a limb, but ultimately the shapes all drift back into a desolate, spacious abstraction. At Greenwich House, Attias will perform solo and in a quartet.212-242-4770, greenwichhouse.org AMIR ELSAFFAR AND TWO RIVERS WITH HAMID AL-SAADI at Pioneer Works (April 8, 7 p.m.). ElSaffar, a lauded Iraqi-American trumpeter, leads bands mostly comprising jazz musicians, but he gets them to use the trundling rhythms and maqam-based melodies of Middle Eastern music, rather than the typical tools of contemporary jazz. Recently he has been performing with Al-Saadi, a singer and scholar of traditional maqam. Here Al-Saadi will join ElSaffar’s sextet, Two Rivers.pioneerworks.org JONATHAN FINLAYSON at the Stone (April 10-13, 8:30 p.m.). Last year, Finlayson, a young trumpeter with an appetite for tangled rhythm and lithe, fugacious melody, released a compelling album, “3 Times Round,” with his sextet. In the coming week at the Stone, across four evenings, he gathers a different band each night: On Wednesday and Thursday, there are trios (featuring the bassist Mark Helias and the drummer Tom Rainey on the first night, then the saxophonist Brian Settles and the drummer Chad Taylor on the second). On April 12, he presents a quintet that includes the alto saxophone phenom Immanuel Wilkins, and on April 13, he closes the run with a septet, playing a new suite of music called “The Odyssey of Big Boy.”thestonenyc.com SULLIVAN FORTNER TRIO at the Village Vanguard (through April 7, 8:30 and 10:30 p.m.). Fortner is just 32, but the New Orleans-born pianist — who’s often clad in a loose smoking jacket and fedora — carries himself with the wizened, avuncular comportment of a jazz elder. When he sits down at the piano, though, youthful energy comes spilling off him like sweat from an athlete’s back. He plays bracing, mile-a-minute postbop, often tangling up his arpeggios and using both hands to create layers of rhythm. At the Vanguard he is joined by Ameen Saleem on bass and Jeremy Clemons on drums; the group will likely draw some repertoire from Fortner’s most recent release, “Moments Preserved.”212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com OLIVER LAKE at Roulette (April 5, 8 p.m.). An avant-garde alto saxophonist and multimedia artist, Lake has been at the top of his class since the early 1970s, when he arrived in New York from St. Louis, where he had helped establish the influential Black Artists Group. In 1976 he and three other saxophonists formed the World Saxophone Quartet, an all-sax combo that became one of the most successful, if unorthodox, jazz groups of the following decade. At Roulette, he presents Alto Madness, a similar ensemble featuring three fellow alto saxophonists — Bruce Williams, Darius Jones and Michaël Attias — as well as the drummer Pheeroan AkLaff. The band will play “Tone Poem for J. A. H.,” a piece Lake originally wrote 12 years ago for the World Saxophone Quartet.917-267-0368, roulette.org ‘A TRIBUTE TO DAVE VALENTIN’ at the Hostos Center for the Arts and Culture (April 6, 7:30 p.m.). Valentin, a Grammy-winning flutist and a fixture of New York’s salsa and Latin jazz scenes, died in 2017 at 64, cutting short a career that encompassed the release of almost two dozen of his own albums, as well as stints with McCoy Tyner’s Latin All-Stars and Tito Puente’s Golden Latin Jazz All-Stars. The pianist Bill O’Connell was the musical director of Valentin’s final band, and here he presents an hommage to his former boss, playing songs from Valentin’s repertoire with a quintet that includes the flutist Andrea Brachfeld. After an intermission, O’Connell will retake the stage with a new 10-piece group, Bill O’Connell’s Afro-Caribbean Ensemble, featuring the master percussionist Roman Díaz. 718-518-4455, hostos.cuny.edu/culturearts MCCOY TYNER AND CHARLES MCPHERSON WITH THE JAZZ AT LINCOLN CENTER ORCHESTRA at the Rose Theater (April 5-6, 8 p.m.). Two jazz giants, Tyner and McPherson will celebrate their 80th birthdays together in a performance with Wynton Marsalis’s Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra. (Tyner reached the milestone late last year; McPherson will turn 80 in July.) The large ensemble will play Tyner’s and McPherson’s compositions, which have been newly arranged for orchestra by members of the group.212-721-6500, jazz.orgGIOVANNI RUSSONELLO "

Call this the Week of the Critic’s Pick, our positive distinction for reviews that reviewers want to flag for you: the reader, the listener, the concertgoer. We’ve had many in recent days: Zachary Woolfe, reporting from the Cleveland Orchestra’s production of Strauss’s “Ariadne auf Naxos,” writes that “there is no orchestra I’d rather hear play” this most operatic of operas. Corinna da Fonseca-Wollheim was pleased with the rising soprano Sabine Devieilhe’s Carnegie Hall debut, “an evening of delicate, nuanced French art songs.”  She also had high praise for “Perle Noire: Meditations for Joséphine,” the latest installment of the soprano Julia Bullock’s luminous residency with the Metropolitan Museum of Art this season.  And Anthony Tommasini was pleasantly surprised by Jaap van Zweden’s conducting with the New York Philharmonic.  Also receiving a Critic’s Pick this week was the premiere of Debussy’s “Pelléas et Mélisande” at the Metropolitan Opera — where it is back for an agonizingly brief run, through Jan. 31.  In the pit for “Pelléas” is Yannick Nézet-Séguin, the Met’s new music director — and an openly gay maestro whose appointment signifies a turning point in New York culture. As Zachary Woolfe writes in this revealing (and often touching) profile:  While culture — particularly high culture — is indelibly associated with gay tastemakers, audiences and creators, it’s a sign of how outmoded our conception of authority is that remarkably few major performing arts leaders have been openly gay. In classical music and opera, even New York, the city that gave rise to the modern gay rights movement with the Stonewall riots 50 years ago this June, has been dominated since then by two conductors: Leonard Bernstein and James Levine, who both kept sexual relationships with men hidden. What matters most, of course, is Mr. Nézet-Séguin’s artistry. And I’m happy to report that his conducting in “Pelléas” on Tuesday was brilliant. Teasing out inner, deep voices, he made a rich score even richer — and inherently more Wagnerian, though you won’t hear any objection from me on that front. (I’d be remiss to not also mention the bass-baritone Kyle Ketelsen, a commanding and compelling Golaud.) Enjoy this clip of Mr. Nézet-Séguin leading the ominous opening bars of the opera. JOSHUA BARONE When Columbia Records originally produced its “Black Composers Series” — a nine-LP set, released between 1974 and ’78 — some reviews gently pondered the question of why such a collection might be necessary in the first place. More than four decades later, the failure of mainstream classical music programming to incorporate works by composers of color has not changed drastically for the better. All of which makes Sony’s reissue of the full “Black Composers Series,” on CD and digital platforms this month, a welcome development. The repertoire of the series included works by the 18th-century composer Joseph Bologne — a.k.a. the Chevalier de Saint-George — as well as then-contemporary pieces by artists like Hale Smith. The albums in Columbia’s series contained some smart sequencing, too (often pairing a composer’s best known works with comparative rarities). The LP dedicated to Mr. Bologne contains a compelling fragment from his opera “Ernestine.” A stretch of one LP devoted to William Grant Still kicks off with his Symphony No. 1 (which the Los Angeles Philharmonic is scheduled to play, next month, as part of a Harlem Renaissance festival). But the album also includes two arias from “Highway 1, U.S.A.,” Mr. Still’s rarely heard opera. Here, alongside the conductor Paul Freeman and the London Symphony Orchestra, tenor William Brown delivered a suitably dramatic version of “What Does He Know of Dreams?,” an aria for the opera’s stingingly arrogant villain. (What would it have sounded like if these artists had been given a budget to record the entire work? The mind reels.) Cutting-edge trends were also emphasized, on these Columbia albums. In particular, Olly Wilson’s “Akwan” — for piano, electric piano, amplified strings, and orchestra — proved a worthy addition to the madcap-modernist American catalog. And Ulysses Kay’s symphonic work “Markings” gleefully tears through a succession of textures, in its opening minutes: exploding with some percussive polyphony, before settling into some droning tones and more brooding themes. One of the most rewarding albums in Columbia’s series was split between works by three composers — including Adolphus Hailstork (who is still active, with a new commission set to debut at the Los Angeles Philharmonic’s series in February). The punchy finale of George Walker’s Piano Concerto, from that same album, gives a sense of the richness that Columbia’s series made available to a wider audience. Encountering the “Black Composers Series” anew, at this remove, can also feel a bit depressing — given these recordings’ implicit reminder of what’s still not being performed more widely, today. Though the documentation they provide remains enticing, on its own terms. SETH COLTER WALLS [Read Seth’s recent profile of the composer-performer Anthony Braxton.] Two of the most moving depictions of aging kings in opera come in quite different works: Philip II in Verdi’s “Don Carlo” and Arkel in Debussy’s “Pelléas et Mélisande.”  The great Italian bass Ferruccio Furlanetto has long been acclaimed as Verdi’s Philip, a monarch who, in a peacemaking political maneuver, marries the young French princess intended for his son and heir, Carlo. But this rash act reveals Philip as a hobbled and isolated leader threatened by his dreamy, idealistic son.  In the Metropolitan Opera’s 2010 production, conducted by Yannick Nézet-Séguin, Mr. Furlanetto brought grave authority touched with unbearable anguish to the profound Act IV aria “Ella giammai m’amo,” when Philip grieves over his loneliness as an unloved husband and as a king.  Here he is singing the aria at the Met. And now, at 69, Mr. Furlanetto, working again with Mr. Nézet-Séguin, is magnificent as Debussy’s Arkel, the leader of a sullen, troubled royal family. Though nearly-blind, this king sees clearly that we are all controlled by fates we can only guess at. The haunting “Pelléas,” a revival of Jonathan Miller’s production, is a highlight of this season. ANTHONY TOMMASINI "
5c2fa05c3a125f5075c02e0e,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/arts/music/roulette-brooklyn.html,"If you’re the kind of New Yorker prone to wondering what it would have been like to go to a CBGB that wasn’t located inside the Newark airport, you might also wonder if you arrived in the city too late. Fair enough. But the old bohemian, culturally rich downtown Manhattan spirit still has a few embers burning through the city. And at least one of these, Roulette, is actually more powerful now than at the time of its birth in 1978. Forty years after opening, Roulette is now nestled inside a YWCA complex at the corner of Third and Atlantic avenues in another downtown: Brooklyn’s. Instead of the 74 seats its co-founder — and current director — Jim Staley provided when he first organized concerts in his Tribeca loft, Roulette now has a theater that can accommodate 400. It’s not only the widest ranging music presenter in the city, but also the most comfortable and welcoming. “As long as it’s something that’s of a creative and experimental nature, they’re interested in it,” Henry Threadgill, the Pulitzer Prize-winning composer and saxophonist, said in an interview. “They’ve always been interested in it.” A potent trombonist as well as an administrator, Mr. Staley is modest in describing the roots of one of New York’s most important avant-garde music spaces. “It started out as a collective,” he said in an interview at Roulette. “And then I sort of initiated a series.” That first regular series in Manhattan, which began in 1980, took place in Mr. Staley’s place on West Broadway. “We were just trying this out,” he recalled. “All these people came, and watched John Cage and Merce Cunningham come through the door, pay their five bucks.” It didn’t take long for noted composers, like the Fluxus artist Philip Corner, to start pitching concerts to him. When the neighborhood changed, Mr. Staley started looking for another home in Lower Manhattan. Late in the 2000s, Roulette leased a spot on Greene Street, until the financial crash sent the building owner’s assets into chaos. In 2011, it came to Brooklyn, where it is host to a jovial mixture of styles. In recent seasons, Roulette has presented work by a trio including YoshimiO, the sometime drummer of the avant-rock group Boredoms; a sterling evening of two-piano works by Philip Glass; and a semi-staged presentation of a four-act opera by the composer and saxophonist Anthony Braxton. It is also the rental hall of choice for some of the city’s most vital music programmers, like the avant-jazz Vision Festival and Thomas Buckner’s Interpretations series. At a recent Interpretations concert, the composer and pianist Anthony Davis, author of grand operas like “X — The Life and Times of Malcolm X” and “Amistad,” announced he would perform some material from his next opera, “The Central Park Five,” set to premiere at Long Beach Opera in June. Mr. Davis’s operatic writing was once performed at Lincoln Center by New York City Opera; now, if you want to hear this work in the city, you’ll likely end up at Roulette. Even if you can’t make it in person, you can tune in online; clips of select recent shows run on Roulette TV, while vintage audio recordings have been popping up on the venue’s SoundCloud page. Excerpts from performances by María Grand, Jennifer Choi and Amirtha Kidambi are particularly good on Roulette TV, and the SoundCloud page offers work by the likes of Leroy Jenkins and Pauline Oliveros. A launch party for an even more in-depth archive is scheduled for Feb. 12. The organization also supports up-and-coming artists with residencies and commissions. In the months before the pianist and composer Kelly Moran made her debut on the Warp label, with the album “Ultraviolet,” you could hear her working out the balance of live pianism and electronics at Roulette, thanks to one of its emerging artist grants. Describing the award as “way more monetary support than I’m used to,” Ms. Moran said in an interview that she was “shellshocked” to receive it: “It was kind of a surreal moment, because I had all these ideas for projects I wanted to do related to my record, and now I had the means to do them.” Roulette is generous to audiences, too. To my mind, its balcony remains far and away the city’s loveliest, most relaxing location from which to take in music. I knew Mr. Threadgill liked it, too, based simply on the number of times I have spotted him there. “It’s just so comfortable,” he said during our interview. “I got addicted to sitting upstairs.” Strangers tend to talk to each other during intermission, more than at other spaces devoted to experimental music. Artists often circulate before and after performances. And that beer you bought in the lobby? You can bring it into the hall. “It’s always been the nature of these kind of places that allowed for that,” Mr. Staley said, when I asked how Roulette fostered that welcoming spirit. But once again, he sounded a little too modest. Certainly plenty of spaces pay lip service to the idea of openness, but wind up feeling cliquish. “Some of the places I know, there’s a feeling of: When the thing’s over, get out,” Mr. Staley finally allowed. After a short beat, he added: “It’s not necessarily the vibe here.” Roulette itself isn’t going anywhere, anytime soon. In 2010, it signed a 20-year lease with the YWCA, with a 10-year extension option. The spring 2019 calendar includes a vocal ensemble performing works by Mr. Braxton, music by the composer Erin Gee, and a night of duets by the pianists Vijay Iyer and Craig Taborn. Prices are affordable: just slightly higher than the average New York movie ticket. (A subscription also knocks $5 off the price of most concerts.) If this range of offerings can’t entice you to check out one of the city’s most inviting experimental spaces — well, you can’t blame that on gentrification over in Manhattan. "

A-TRAK at Marquee (March 22, 11 p.m.). A touring D.J. for Kanye West in the early 2000s, this Canadian turntablist quickly graduated from trusted collaborator to label boss: In 2007, he co-founded Fool’s Gold, a Brooklyn-based record company that has championed artists like Danny Brown and Kid Cudi. He has also released his own work through the label, including 2016’s “In the Loop: A Decade of Remixes,” a box set compiling a selection of his 200-plus credited remixes (most notably, his version of “Heads Will Roll” by the Yeah Yeah Yeahs). A-Trak celebrates his birthday with a guest set at this trendy West Chelsea nightclub. 646-473-0202, marqueeny.com MARIAH CAREY at Radio City Music Hall (March 25, 8 p.m.). Since the early 1990s, this powerhouse has put the full might of her five-octave voice behind radio hits that straddle genres, from the honeyed daze of “Always Be My Baby” to the hip-hop flair of her “Fantasy” remix featuring Ol’ Dirty Bastard. Currently, Carey is on the road touring her 15th studio album, “Caution” — a record graced by collaborators like Ty Dolla Sign and Dev Hynes. It prioritizes a more subdued, of-the-moment R&B sound over the vocal theatrics for which Carey is known. Still, expect the singer to dust off the showstoppers for her hometown crowd.  212-465-6000, radiocity.com FLOHIO at Baby’s All Right (March 22, 8 p.m.). This Nigeria-born, British-bred rapper makes her way to Brooklyn this weekend to perform hard-charging songs that draw together elements of grime, trap and techno. An energetic M.C., Flohio — whose given name is Funmi Ohiosuma — floods her music with a brashness that she attributes to her South London upbringing. Ohiosuma recently told The Guardian, “Rap isn’t meant to be too happy; there’s meant to be grit in there.” That attitude guides her recent EP, “Wild Yout,” on which she touts her authenticity and taunts her detractors. Released in November, it was the culminating effort of her breakout year. 718-599-5800, babysallright.com JOSÉ GONZÁLEZ at the Apollo Theater (March 21-22, 8 p.m.). In his solo work, this Swedish-Argentinian songwriter is a practiced minimalist, painting pictures with just his fingerpicked guitar and soft vocals. But González transforms in the company of collaborators. His sound expands whether he’s recording with the folk-rock group Junip or touring with the String Theory, an experimental orchestra from Berlin and Gothenburg with whom he released a live album last month. The String Theory will join him for his two-night run at the Apollo, performing new arrangements of songs from González’s three solo albums. 212-531-5305, apollotheater.org [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] KAIA KATER AND KARINE POLWART at Carnegie Hall (March 23, 9 p.m.). This double bill showcases a range of folk traditions, embraced by two distinctly contemporary artists. For Quebec-born Kater, the Canadian folk songs of her childhood and the Appalachian music she studied while attending college in West Virginia serve as touchstones; Polwart, meanwhile, draws from the musical heritage of her native Scotland. The noted political dimension in the songwriting of both women makes this a natural pairing: Kater has sung about the Black Lives Matter movement and political strife in her father’s home country of Grenada, and Polwart’s 2018 album, “Laws of Motion,” addresses Trumpism and the experiences of migrants. 212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org TORRES at Le Poisson Rouge (March 22, 8 p.m.). In the six years since she released her debut album, the Brooklyn-based singer Mackenzie Scott (a.k.a. Torres) has made the journey from quiet, confessional songwriter to adventurous, often boisterous rocker. On her most recent album, 2017’s “Three Futures,” Scott textured her guitar work with industrial and electronic sounds, aiming to create something that engaged all five senses. For her show at this Manhattan multimedia club, expect sensory engagement, beginning with her ritual preshow burning of palo santo sticks. Annie Hart, of the trio Au Revoir Simone, will open, setting the stage with lush, synth-driven pop songs. lpr.comOLIVIA HORN ALTERNATIVE GUITAR SUMMIT at various locations (March 21, 25 and 27-28, 7:30 p.m.). Organized by the guitarist Joel Harrison, the annual Alternative Guitar Summit gathers some of the most talented six-string improvisers in jazz, post-rock and world music. This year’s festival begins on Thursday with a 50th-anniversary celebration of the music of Woodstock, at Le Poisson Rouge in Greenwich Village. Harrison will play music from the Richie Havens and the Grateful Dead songbooks alongside the Everett Bradley Choir. The guitarist Ben Monder and the vocalist Jo Lawry will collaborate on music by John Sebastian and the Band. And the guitarist Nels Cline, who’s best known for his work in Wilco, will revisit Santana’s iconic Woodstock performance. The summit’s second concert takes place on Monday, when Cline, Leni Stern and others will pay tribute to the esteemed guitarist (and multi-instrumentalist) Ralph Towner at Drom, in the East Village. It concludes on Wednesday and Thursday at Jazz Standard with solo shows from Towner himself. (On the last two nights, there will be second sets at 9:30 p.m.) alternativeguitarsummit.com AARON DIEHL TRIO at the Baruch Performing Arts Center (March 28, 8 p.m.). Diehl’s piano playing has the same courtly, dapper flare as his wardrobe (he’s usually attired in a crisp, dark suit, sometimes topped off with a pair of thick-framed glasses). Picking up the mantle of midcentury greats like Bud Powell, Barry Harris and Cedar Walton, he espouses the ideal of jazz as America’s classical music, whether he’s performing standards or his own neo-traditionalist compositions. He may be best known for his work alongside Cécile McLorin Salvant, an eminent young vocalist, but at Baruch the spotlight will fall squarely on Diehl and his trio, which features the bassist David Wong and the drummer Aaron Kimmel. They will be playing music from his most recent album, “Space, Time, Continuum,” as well as some new pieces.212-352-3101, baruch.cuny.edu/bpac FIRE! AND MADALYN MERKEY at the Clemente Soto Vélez Cultural Center (March 28, 8 p.m.). The tenor saxophonist Mats Gustafsson, one of Europe’s most uncompromising free improvisers, angles toward the void in Fire!, a trio that includes the bassist Johan Berthling and the drummer Andreas Werliin. Whether scrawling an illegible smear of notes across the top of a pounding beat or erupting in fury as the rhythm dissolves beneath him, Gustafsson keeps the intensity high and your ears alight — even when his tone skews murky and dark. Fire! shares the bill here with Merkey, whose semi-ambient electronic music guides listeners into a kind of dreamlike state. This concert — Fire!’s first ever in New York — is presented by the nonprofit organization Blank Forms.blankforms.org DEREK GRIPPER at Roulette (March 23, 8 p.m.). Gripper, a South African guitarist, has developed a virtuoso approach to playing Malian music that was originally composed for instruments such as the kora (a 21-string instrument, somewhere between a harp and a guitar) and the ngoni (a possible progenitor of the banjo). He fingerpicks his classical guitar in percussive swirls, producing a sound that’s as enlivening as it is hypnotic. His repertoire includes music by the kora master Toumani Diabaté and the guitarist Ali Farka Touré, as well as folk songs from South Africa’s Western Cape. This concert kicks off the fifth annual A World in Trance festival, which spotlights music from around the world with explicitly spiritual overtones.917-267-0368, roulette.org MANUEL VALERA AND THE NEW CUBAN EXPRESS BIG BAND at Terraza 7 (March 28, 9 p.m.). Valera, a Cuban-born pianist with a blazingly fluent right hand and a mellifluous compositional style, has long led the New Cuban Express, a midsize band that integrates elements of contemporary New York jazz with Afro-Cuban forms. On Thursday he will premiere a big-band iteration of the ensemble, featuring the vocalist Sofía Rei and the alto saxophonist Román Filiú, plus 16 other instrumentalists.347-808-0518, terraza7.com WEBBER/MORRIS BIG BAND at the Jazz Gallery (March 22, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). The tenor saxophonist and flutist Anna Webber recently put out “Clockwise,” an album full of atonality and friction and discomfited momentum — not to mention, some of New York’s premier improvising musicians. Angela Morris, a fellow saxophonist, shares some of Webber’s style, while also drawing more heavily on the influence of Impressionist composers and jazz’s most ancient styles. They have been playing their ambitious original compositions in this big band for a few years, and supposedly there’s an album on the way — but so far all we have to show for it are a few YouTube clips and a bit of buzz on the scene. To really hear the Webber/Morris Big Band, you’ve got to go in person.646-494-3625, jazzgallery.nyc GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO "
5c91625749f0eacbf105defc,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/19/arts/music/tamaryn-dreaming-the-dark.html,"LOS ANGELES — On a rainy March evening, the singer-songwriter Tamaryn waited for a gnostic priest to begin his lecture on the transformative power of tarot at a small lodge in the Hollywood Hills. “This is the gothest night,” she whispered. A first-name-only artist who has been steadily releasing music for the past decade, Tamaryn, 37, appreciated Mother Nature’s cooperative stage direction: Between claps of thunder, lightning illuminated the stained-glass windows and the candlelit altar bearing a dagger and a single pink rose. “It’s not my religion,” she explained. “This is a journey I’m learning about. In 10 years, I might say it’s hocus-pocus.” Tamaryn’s fascination with mysticism largely stems from her fourth album, “Dreaming the Dark,” which is due on Friday and finds her confronting childhood memories in unexpected ways. Raised by her mother and godmother, both Jungian psychologists, along with a nomadic group of bohemian types who moved around New Zealand and, later, the western United States, Tamaryn said she frequently witnessed a form of therapy involving ritual theater. Participants would inhabit roles from the tarot deck’s Major Arcana — the 22 pictorial cards (like the Empress and the Devil) that in certain interpretations overlap with Carl Jung’s notion of archetypes and the collective unconscious. “I don’t think I ever thought it was normal,” she said over dinner a few days later during an intense conversation that spanned several hours. A lace maroon top covered her black bustier, and a glow-in-the-dark cross dangled from one ear. “But they basically instilled the idea that creativity is a route to heal,” she continued, “and that applies in such a huge way to my life now.” Since leaving home at 13, Tamaryn, born Tamaryn Brown, has spoken only sporadically to her mother. (She never met her late father, but knows he was a competitive bridge player.) Before settling in Los Angeles three years ago, she lived in San Francisco and New York. Denizens of the Lower East Side in the rapidly gentrifying early aughts might have bumped into her at Mondo Kim’s on St. Marks Place, where she was a salesclerk (“I would sit there and listen to Lydia Lunch really loud,” she said), or behind the bar at the similarly defunct club Tonic, where she also performed one-off shows with various outfits. “Dreaming the Dark” is her first album since the 2015 LP “Cranekiss,” both of which were written and produced alongside Jorge Elbrecht, known for his collaborations with Ariel Pink. Driven by lushly orchestrated synths and emotionally intense vocals, the record’s nine songs invoke a range of influences, including Sisters of Mercy, the composer Angelo Badalamenti and Kanye West circa “808s & Heartbreak.” (She said she specifically wanted to mimic “the whipping sounds” from Depeche Mode’s “Master and Servant” for the industrial number “Victim Complex.”) The intentionally low-budget music videos that she’s been directing have, in psychoanalytic parlance, unlocked her subconscious. She realized she was relying heavily on tarot imagery — for instance, casting herself as the Moon upon a crescent-shaped swing for “Angels of Sweat.” “I didn’t come up with this concept,” she said. “It revealed itself to me.” She acknowledged that her approach might sound “woo-woo,” but she doesn’t care. From an early age, Tamaryn was encouraged to be wary of the mainstream. “When I was 7, my godmother saw me dancing super sexy in front of the TV to the ‘Solid Gold’ dancers,” she said. “She was like, ‘That’s not the only way to dance.’ She took me into her room, put on Kate Bush’s ‘The Dreaming,’ and was like, ‘No one’s watching you, move any way that makes sense to the music.’” Despite attracting critically positive notices since her 2010 debut LP “The Waves,” Tamaryn hasn’t had a breakout moment and has supplemented her income with various jobs. For a spell in 2013, she helped the Dum Dum Girls with general creative direction, scoring the interstitial music to a video written by Bret Easton Ellis for their song “Are You Okay?” She has also built step-and-repeats for red-carpet events and worked in the shipping department of a perfume company. “There’s this myth that you’re a failure if you have to have a job,” she said, casually tugging at the fringed bangs of her crimson-red hair. “I kind of feel the opposite. I feel you should keep your creativity as uncompromised as you can.” “The Waves” and its 2012 follow-up, “Tender New Signs,” both recorded with the guitarist Rex John Shelverton, proudly embraced the atmospheric soundscapes and washed-out vocals of their shoegaze roots. But eventually, according to Tamaryn, “I could have put out a straight-up disco song, and somebody would say that it was pushing the boundaries of shoegaze.” She laughed. She intended “Cranekiss” to be the “first statement that I’m no longer a band working within certain parameters.” She switched up her collaborators, bringing in Elbrecht, a member of the art collective Lansing-Drieden, and Shaun Durkan from the Bay Area noise-pop band Weekend. “She was really precise with what she wanted,” said Elbrecht. “It’s pretty crucial to her to have a certain melancholic feeling.” The “Cranekiss” centerpiece “Hands All Over Me” earned her a fan in Sky Ferreira, who Tamaryn said later asked her to do some writing. The album also impressed the musician Mariqueen Maandig Reznor, who praised Tamaryn’s “talent and good taste” in an email, adding that she has played the LP “every other day for the last four years. I was unsure if I would ever stop consistently listening to it, but now I have ‘Dreaming the Dark,’ and have it on rotation obsessively.” But following “Cranekiss,” she took a break from music. Craving stability — a quest that, as a child, led her to figure skate competitively, she said — she went to school to be hair colorist. She ended up traveling to Japan as a hair model, donning rainbow-colored extensions and performing David Bowie songs at various events. “I thought I was quitting touring to settle down and get a trade and then it’s like, no, I’m literally dressed as a mermaid singing ‘Life on Mars,’” she said. At the same time, she was mourning her friend, the celebrity photographer Matt Irwin, who died by suicide in 2016. “The last conversation I had with him was about a toxic relationship that he couldn’t get over,” she said. “It was a wake-up call.” “Dreaming the Dark” is dedicated to him. Sensing it was time to return to music, Tamaryn connected with a young Vegas-based musician named Jordan Collins through Instagram who inspired her to write some demos with him about her own unhealthy relationships. “A lot of things on this record I can’t say to other people, because I shouldn’t talk to those people,” she said. And in early 2018, she reconvened with Elbrecht, who pushed her to explore “the pop quality” of her vocal range, he said. “She could really get up high and project.” As a result, many of her new songs, like the standout “Path to Love,” share a similar theatricality with her formative inspiration, Kate Bush. “It could be emotionally draining to listen to it all the way through,” she said, with a laugh. She is already at work on a follow-up EP, and will spend the spring touring South America and Europe. Tamaryn does not expect to quit her latest day job — a freelance gig narrating erotic audiobooks — at the moment, but that’s O.K. “I just want to look back and be able to mark the different eras of my life by the records I made,” she said. “That’s the only real goal.” "
5caf2ca149f0eacbf1f82c25,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/arts/music/kendrick-lamar-pulitzer-prize-music.html,"A year ago, shock waves rippled through the arts world when the Pulitzer Prize in Music, almost always bestowed on a classical composer, was awarded to Kendrick Lamar’s album “DAMN.” “This is a big moment for hip-hop music and a big moment for the Pulitzers,” Dana Canedy, the prizes’ administrator, said then. “I never thought I’d be a part of it,” Mr. Lamar told Vanity Fair about the prize. “It’s one of those things that should have happened with hip-hop a long time ago.” It was not only the first time the prize had gone to a hip-hop work; never before had it been given to any kind of mainstream popular music. Even as Pulitzer-winning musical styles shifted over the decades, from the Americana of Copland’s “Appalachian Spring” (1945) to the fragmented atonality of Donald Martino’s “Notturno” (1974) to the joyful genre-bending of Caroline Shaw’s “Partita” (2013), the prize has remained almost exclusively the province of classical music. But Mr. Lamar’s Pulitzer upended all that. Was “DAMN.” a fluke, or will the prize — the 2019 winner will be announced on April 15 — genuinely embrace popular music? What now counts as a “distinguished American composition”? The music Pulitzer was established in 1943 as a celebration of homegrown art in the midst of World War II; the first winner was a briskly patriotic cantata by the Neo-Classicist William Schuman. For decades, the prize was mostly given to well-established composers: As Mr. Martino once said, “If you write music long enough, sooner or later someone is going to take pity on you and give you the damn thing.” There was also long a sense that awardees largely came out of the insular academic scene. In a scathing 1991 article, the critic Kyle Gann chastised the Pulitzer as a “reward for conformity and a compensation prize for ineffectuality.” After winning, in 2003, John Adams told The New York Times that, “among musicians that I know, the Pulitzer has over the years lost much of the prestige it still carries in other fields like literature and journalism.” (Mr. Adams, as well as six other Pulitzer-winning composers, declined to be interviewed for this article; Mr. Lamar was unavailable for comment.) Recently the prize has broadened in aesthetic scope and given a career boost to young composers like Ms. Shaw, who was 30 when she won. But until Mr. Lamar, it had still barely budged outside of its old classical music limits. When, in 1965, the music jury attempted to break free of those constraints by requesting a special citation for Duke Ellington, the Pulitzer’s governing board declined the recommendation. The prize has been haunted by that embarrassing episode, only partly rectified by special awards and citations granted posthumously to Ellington and other jazz legends like Scott Joplin and John Coltrane. A turning point came in 1997, when Wynton Marsalis won, the first time the prize recognized jazz. The guidelines subsequently eliminated an original reference to classical forms and, in 2004, dropped a requirement to provide a notated score, allowing for recording-only submissions. There were critics. “I don’t think it’s a good idea at all,” Mr. Martino said of the new openness in 2004. “Let these people win DownBeat polls,” referring to the jazz magazine. (Characteristic of the history of the prize is the contradiction that some of the composers who have complained about its insularity have also vociferously defended its boundaries.) Such changes, though, didn’t overturn the status quo. Since Mr. Marsalis, only two other jazz composers have won: Ornette Coleman and Henry Threadgill. Even Mr. Lamar’s path to victory last year was somewhat unusual: “DAMN.” had not been officially submitted. But during a weekend of deliberations, the five-member music jury weighed the merits of some classical submissions that drew on hip-hop influences, and came to the conclusion that hip-hop itself should be under consideration. The jury introduced “DAMN.” into the process and ultimately decided it was worthy of the prize. “We’re there all day listening, reading, discussing,” one of the 2018 jurors, the jazz violinist Regina Carter, said in a recent interview. “We were all really respectful of one another and listened to each other. There was no fighting going on: We’d argue our cases, but it never got ugly.” Ms. Canedy, who spent much of her career as a reporter and editor at The New York Times, became the Pulitzers’ administrator in 2017. She sees Mr. Lamar’s win as a step toward diversifying the submission pool. “The biggest thing we could have done to send a signal to the music industry that we’re serious about this is to award a Pulitzer to Kendrick Lamar,” she said in a recent interview. “That’s not why we did it; we did it because his work was spectacular. But if it sends a signal to the industry that we really are open to all kinds of amazing music, then that’s a good thing.” But even if SoundCloud rappers and aspiring singer-songwriters start to submit, their work still needs to be evaluated by a jury. Pulitzer juries in the past decade have typically comprised a mix of classical and jazz musicians, critics, academics and arts administrators. Will future juries give adequate attention to nonclassical submissions — or have the knowledge to properly distinguish a work of the caliber of “DAMN.” from other hip-hop entries? “Technically speaking, excellent music is excellent music,” Ms. Canedy said. “So I think if you can judge excellent music, you can do that across genres.” Maybe, or maybe not. Having listened to Mr. Lamar’s music, Steve Reich, who won in 2009, said, “I don’t know enough hip-hop to separate him from other hip-hop artists.” “To make a judgment, you have to make an informed judgment,” Mr. Reich added. “And I don’t have that. Therefore, I wouldn’t be competent to judge him.” The composer Kevin Puts, who won in 2012, said in a recent interview, “I do a lot of judging of competitions for so-called classical music, like orchestra music. I feel I’m qualified to do that. But I wonder, if there were more genres or more styles involved, if I would really be the person to make a good decision.” Ms. Carter expressed confidence in the diversity of the two juries on which she has served. But she also acknowledged that there were potential limitations in the early stages. “If you have jurors and no one is familiar with that genre, then I think it’s not even going to make it into that forward pile,” she said. Excellent music may be excellent music, but not all musicians have equal understanding or even respect for different traditions; consider the many online commenters who dismissed Mr. Lamar’s win, one of whom described the album as “neurologically divergent from music.” The prize, moreover, is not actually decided by the music jurors. The jury is instructed to provide the Pulitzers’ administrative board — which includes journalists, editors and academics, but not professional musicians — with three unranked nominations. The board then decides which of the three receives the award. “We would have been happy with whomever they had chosen to win both times,” Ms. Carter said of her juries, “because all of the composers felt really strong and their works were really intriguing.” Last year’s Pulitzer could well have gone to one of the other, more conventional finalists, the composers Ted Hearne and Michael Gilbertson, rather than Mr. Lamar. And if a future board were to be confronted with, say, an opera by Tania León, an experimental record by Nicole Mitchell, and a visual album by Beyoncé, might its members tend to select the finalist with whom they were already most familiar? “That’s just never happened,” Ms. Canedy said. “Every finalist gets its due when it comes before the board,” she added. “They do what they do, which is download the work, listen to it, debate it, and then make a decision.” It’s not always that simple. The Ellington controversy arose from disagreement between a jury eager to award a jazz master and a board concerned that it was violating the prize’s rules. In 1992, the music jury recommended only a single finalist: a work by the composer Ralph Shapey. The board  demanded that the jury provide a second option and, when a piece by the composer Wayne Peterson was submitted, the board chose the Peterson. Angry jurors then released a statement describing the board’s decision as “especially alarming because it occurred without consultation and without knowledge of either our standards or rationale. Such alterations by a committee without professional musical expertise guarantees, if continued, a lamentable devaluation of this uniquely important award.” And the Pulitzer remains singularly important — which makes its intricate rules and shifts of stylistic emphasis big news in the music world. The 2019 prize may go to a groundbreaking symphony, a confessional folk record or a transcendent mixtape. Speaking in late February, Ms. Canedy said that the music jury — which will remain anonymous until the prize is announced — had selected its three finalists. “We had a diverse slate of entries,” she said. “We have three finalists that we’re incredibly proud of, and would be happy to see any of the three win a Pulitzer.” "

CALIDORE STRING QUARTET at Town Hall (Feb. 17, 2 p.m.). What a fine series the bargain-basement Peoples’ Symphony has put together this season, particularly in terms of leading pianists and string quartets. And this foursome is certainly among them. Recipients of the Avery Fisher Career Grant last year, they will play recent quartets by Hannah Lash and Caroline Shaw alongside Haydn’s Quartet in F (Op. 77, No. 2) and Beethoven’s Quartet in C sharp minor (Op. 131).212-586-4680, pscny.org THE CHOIR OF TRINITY WALL STREET at St. Paul’s Chapel (Feb. 15, 7:30 p.m.). Julian Wachner leads his own contribution to Trinity’s Mass Reimaginings project, the “Epistle Mass,” as well as the East Coast premiere of Nico Muhly’s “The Faire Starre” and the New York premiere of Daniel Schlosberg’s “Nightingale+Rose.” As ever with Trinity’s performances, admission is free.212-602-0800, trinitywallstreet.org DARMSTADT at Le Poisson Rouge (Feb. 20, 8 p.m.). This will be the 15th annual performance by this Brooklyn group of Terry Riley’s “In C,” that classic early statement of Minimalism. Among the notable performers this year are Gelsey Bell and Joan La Barbara.lpr.com MARCO FUSI AND THE KUKURUZ QUARTET at the Italian Academy (Feb. 20, 7 p.m.). This quartet — pianos, not strings — is joined by a leading new-music violinist for a sprawling, free program that culminates with another contribution to the Julius Eastman revival, a performance of his “Gay Guerrilla.” Before that, there is music by Salvatore Sciarrino, Giacinto Scelsi, John Cage and Marcel Zaes.212-854-2306, italianacademy.columbia.edu [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] WANG LU at Miller Theater (Feb. 21, 8 p.m.). This Chinese-born composer benefits from the first of Miller’s spring composer portraits, and from the advocacy of the new-music royalty on hand to perform her pieces: the International Contemporary Ensemble and Yarn/Wire. There’s one world premiere, “A-PPA-Aratus,” as well as “Childhood Amnesia,” “Rates of Extinction,” “Urban Inventory” and “Siren Song.”212-854-7799, millertheatre.com NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC at David Geffen Hall (Feb. 21, 7:30 p.m.; through Feb. 23). Matthias Pintscher leads the Philharmonic this week, and the conductor-composer brings along one of his own works, the violin concerto “Mar’eh,” in which Renaud Capuçon is the soloist. Also on the bill are Ravel’s “Alborada del gracioso” and Stravinsky’s “The Firebird,” performed in its entirety. After the concert on Feb. 23, Pintscher curates a Nightcap concert in the Kaplan Penthouse, with Nadia Sirota as the host.212-875-5656, nyphil.org RUSSIAN NATIONAL ORCHESTRA at David Geffen Hall (Feb. 20, 8 p.m.). Nothing more imaginative than an all-Rachmaninoff program is on offer here, but from an orchestra with a unique sound and personality. Kirill Karabits conducts the “Symphonic Dances” and the Piano Concerto No. 2; Mikhail Pletnev is the soloist.212-721-6500, lincolncenter.org/great-performers JORDI SAVALL AND LE CONCERT DES NATIONS at Zankel Hall (Feb. 21, 7:30 p.m.).

ANTIBALAS at Brooklyn Bowl (March 15-16, 8 p.m.). This Brooklyn-based Afrobeat band is celebrating 20 years together with a two-night run, during which they will perform the kind of large-ensemble party music — think a vibrant horn section and multiple percussionists — that’s made them so irresistible for the past two decades. Their work incorporates dub, funk and jazz, creating a rich, textured version of the kind of global dance sound that’s become increasingly popular over the course of their career. On Friday, the music collective Innov Gnawa will open, and on Saturday, the hip-hop group Poetic Thrust will kick things off. 718-963-3369, brooklynbowl.com GARY CLARK JR. at the Beacon Theater (March 21-23, 8 p.m.). As a gifted blues guitarist, this Austin, Tex., native could easily stick to traditional sounds. But Clark continues to make songs that are expansive and forward-looking. He channels his remarkable technical ability toward hard-edge, political and genre-bending music that is nevertheless rooted in the blues, or at least its angst and earnestness. On his most recent album, “This Land,” he tackles racism and American politics through tunes that are anything but easy listening — and all the better for it.212-465-6000, beacontheatre.com GUSTER at the Beacon Theater (March 16, 8 p.m.). Since the members of this alternative rock band met during orientation at Tufts University in 1991, they have made consistently upbeat and pleasantly eccentric albums. Their latest, “Look Alive,” is their first release in four years, but their enthusiasm hasn’t dulled — at least if the album’s bright, polished, synth-driven indie-pop track list is any indication. Its sound is as approachable and harmony-rich as that of the songs that earned the still-independent band spots on mainstream soundtracks like “The O.C.” and “Wedding Crashers.”212-465-6000, beacontheatre.com [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] HABIB KOITÉ at Le Poisson Rouge (March 15, 8 p.m.). A virtuosic guitarist, Koité has cultivated his own niche within the string-rich musical culture of his native Mali. He uses unorthodox tunings and incorporates a global mix of flamenco and blues into his interpretation of dansa, a traditional form of Malian music from his hometown, Kayes. The resulting sound has reached international audiences and gained fans like Bonnie Raitt. Perhaps best known for his approachable 1998 album, “Ma Ya,” Koité, 61, continues to act as an ambassador of Mali’s music.212-505-3474, lpr.com LOUDON WAINWRIGHT III at Sony Hall (March 15, 8 p.m.). You might have already seen this show — it’s the live version of Wainwright’s recent Netflix special, “Surviving Twin,” which itself is the filmed version of a one-man set he’s been performing since 2013. “Surviving Twin” takes its title from a Wainwright song of the same name, which is about the singer-songwriter’s relationship with his father, Loudon Wainwright Jr.; the show, though, is about relationships between fathers and sons more broadly, including Wainwright’s son and fellow performer, Rufus.212-997-5123, sonyhall.com DALE WATSON AND KINKY FRIEDMAN at Union Pool (March 16, 7 p.m.). Two Texas titans visit Brooklyn this week to perform a brand of country music that’s so traditional, it has made them outsiders. Watson favors a polished rockabilly shuffle that sounds straight out of the 1960s, while Friedman tempers his irreverent, occasionally profane tunes with twangy guitar and banjos. Both are beloved for their willingness to buck trends (and any chance of mainstream success) and deftly play country music that transports listeners anywhere — even in Williamsburg — to an old-fashioned honky-tonk. 718-609-0484, union-pool.com NATALIE WEINER CARLA BLEY TRIO at Jazz Standard (March 19-20, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). Unlike her compositions — a lovable admixture of American folk songs, avant-garde jazz, soft rock and Romanticism — Bley, at age 82, remains a rather inaccessible figure. She doesn’t tour often, and she has long preferred the scholarly remove of a composer’s identity to the more public one of a bandleader. All of which makes this appearance, featuring her longstanding trio (Bley on piano, Steve Swallow on bass and Andy Sheppard on saxophones), something especially worth seeking out.212-576-2232, jazzstandard.com MARÍA GRAND at Roulette (March 21, 8 p.m.). A dauntless young tenor saxophonist whose concept and ambition seem to grow broader by the week, Grand is unwilling to accept anything as a given — stylistically, culturally, whatever. This concert, which she has titled “Music as a User’s Manual,” is meant to upend the passive relationship between audience and performance. How will she achieve this? That, presumably, depends on you as much as on her. But we know this: The first portion of the night will feature Grand alone, on saxophone and vocals; she’ll then be joined by Ganavya Doraiswamy on vocals, Joel Ross on vibraphone and Rajna Swaminathan on mridangam, for a separate set.917-267-0368, roulette.org LARRY GRENADIER at Zürcher Gallery (March 15, 8 p.m.). A leading jazz bassist since the 1990s, when he was a member of Brad Mehldau’s watershed trio, Grenadier recently put out his first solo-bass recording, “The Gleaners.” The album feels like a peek into a private world, as if you’re discovering the poems of a great writer who was known only for his essays. (In actuality, it’s inspired by film: specifically, Agnes Varda’s famed documentary about potato harvesters, “The Gleaners and I.”) For much of the record Grenadier focuses on arco playing, showing great range: He can use the bow to create spritzed, lively rhythms or a luminous, slow immersion. Abstraction would seem inherent to a solo-jazz-bass performance, but there’s nothing dreamlike about this album; his sound is as direct and powerful as it is elegant.galeriezurcher.com THANDISWA MAZWAI AND NDUDUZO MAKHATHINI at the Africa Center (March 15-16, 8 p.m.). Mazwai is an A-list celebrity in South Africa, where she upholds a long tradition of politically engaged pop singing. She rose to prominence in the 1990s as the lead vocalist in Bongo Maffin, a famed group in the kwaito genre (a kind of house music). In the years since she has become known as a solo artist carrying on the legacies of Miriam Makeba, Brenda Fassie and other vocalists who blended jazz, pop and South African folk music. Here she appears alongside Makhathini, a young pianist with a thriving career as both a sideman and a solo artist, always guided by an attentiveness to music’s potential for healing and renewal. This concert is presented as part of the Salon Africana series, which features performers chosen by the vocalist Somi.salonafricana.com CHARLES TOLLIVER at the Blue Note (March 14-17, 8 and 10:30 p.m.). A trumpeter with a strong, unvarnished attack, Tolliver launched his recording career in 1968 with the release of “Paper Man,” an epochal record reflecting the blend of post-bop, psychedelic rock, salsa and increasingly militant funk being played around New York City at the time. He celebrated the 50th anniversary of the record’s release last year in a triumphant performance at the Charlie Parker Jazz Festival, and this weekend at the Blue Note he will reprise the reprisal once again. In addition to the alto saxophonist Gary Bartz — who was in the quintet that recorded the original album — he will be joined by the pianist Vijay Iyer, the bassist Buster Williams and the drummer Lenny White.212-475-8592, bluenote.net ‘UNFORGETTABLE: THE MAGIC OF NAT KING COLE’ at Flushing Town Hall (March 15, 8 p.m.). The pianist and vocalist Nat King Cole — who died in 1965, at the height of his fame — would have turned 100 on Sunday. In honor of his life and legacy, the svelte and subtly inventive vocalist Sachal Vasandani will interpret songs from Cole’s repertoire with an all-star band: Shai Maestro on piano, Reuben Rogers on bass and Obed Calvaire on drums.718-463-7700, flushingtownhall.orgGIOVANNI RUSSONELLO KAREN O AND DANGER MOUSE at Florence Gould Hall (March 20, 7 p.m.). Jon Pareles, chief pop music critic for The New York Times, hosts an evening of music and conversation with the Yeah Yeah Yeahs frontwoman Karen O and the musician and producer Danger Mouse. On Friday, the duo will release “Lux Prima,” their first-ever collaboration. The audience will get to hear a selection of songs from the album during this discussion.timestalks.com "

BILAL at National Sawdust (March 29, 8 p.m.). A onetime member of the Soulquarians, this Philadelphia-born singer, songwriter and producer is well known as a collaborator: He has won a Grammy for his work with Kendrick Lamar and lent his vocals to the likes of Jay-Z and Mac Miller. Bilal himself took a circuitous path as a solo artist after his sophomore album was shelved in 2006. Disenchanted with the industry, he parted ways with his label and began experimenting with jazz and electronic sounds, rejecting the “neo-soul” billing that has followed him for much of his career. The result, heard on recent albums “A Love Surreal” and “In Another Life,” is fluid and inviting. 646-779-8455, nationalsawdust.org BROADLY PRESENTS EUPHORIA at Villain (March 30, 8 p.m.). This Vice-owned event space hosts a celebration of International Transgender Day of Visibility, organized by the media company’s female-focused internet channel. Following an afternoon fair for transgender-centered businesses, the evening session will culminate with a dance party hosted by the D.J. Bronze Goddess and the House of LaBeija, one of New York’s oldest drag houses. A performance by Big Freedia — the New Orleans-based rapper and an ambassador of the city’s distinctive bounce style, known for her high-profile collaborations with Beyoncé and Drake — is sure to be a highlight.eventbrite.com EARL SWEATSHIRT at Irving Plaza (March 30, 8 p.m.). For years, the rapper Thebe Kgositsile has been fighting against his own founding myth. Kgositsile, who performs as Earl Sweatshirt, got his start with the California collective Odd Future, gaining a following in 2010 as a viral teenage provocateur with an affinity for shock value and gore. Following his first mixtape, Kgositsile’s music started to show more vulnerability. His latest album, an exploratory set titled “Some Rap Songs,” considers family: A standout track, “Playing Possum,” incorporates sampled audio from his mother and recently deceased poet father. Kgositsile’s performance is sold out, but tickets are available through the resale market.212-777-6800, mercuryeastpresents.com [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] EX HEX at Bowery Ballroom (April 4, 8 p.m.). Technically skilled and wildly inventive, the rock nomad Mary Timony is routinely held up as a guitar god. With Ex Hex, the Washington-based trio she has led since 2014, Timony’s style pulls back from the experimentalism she embraced as the frontwoman of the riot-grrrl-adjacent group Helium in the 1990s. Rounded out by the bassist Betsy Wright and the drummer Laura Harris, Ex Hex play more straight-ahead garage rock; their second full-length recording, “It’s Real,” is packed with power chords, revved-up guitar solos and layered vocals — perfect fodder for the group’s notoriously fun live show.212-260-4700, mercuryeastpresents.com MATMOS AND KEITH FULLERTON WHITMAN at Pioneer Works (April 4, 7 p.m.). Both acts on this double bill work with experimental hybrids of electronic and organic sound. Since coming together in 1997, Matmos — the duo of Martin Schmidt and Drew Daniel — have obsessed over the materiality of music. They compose by gathering samples from diverse sources, like washing machines, animal cages or amplified nerve tissue; their new record, “Plastic Anniversary,” cleverly comments on the impending environmental crisis by drawing from all-plastic source material. Expect to hear selections from that album at this art center in Red Hook, Brooklyn, as well as the highly technical experiments in ambient and drone from the Brooklyn-based performer Whitman.pioneerworks.org DEEM SPENCER at Baby’s All Right (April 3, 8 p.m.). On his earliest releases, this soft-spoken rapper from Queens delivered a sound that might have been described as half-whispered, and half-finished, poetry. Last month’s “Pretty Face” — his first full-length recording — is built on the same melancholy lyricism and lo-fi production that defined previous projects, but it feels more resolute, nudging up the intensity on his heartsick ruminations. Spencer’s performance at this fittingly intimate club in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, is two milestones in one: his first headlining show in New York and the live debut of tracks from “Pretty Face.”718-599-5800, babysallright.comOLIVIA HORN BACHIR AND MUSTAPHA ATTAR at Roulette (March 30, 8 p.m.). The Master Musicians of Jajouka, a heritage band from a small village in Morocco, have become an influence on the rest of the world thanks to their work with Western stars such as Ornette Coleman, Bernardo Bertolucci and even the Rolling Stones. They’re defined by the sharp scrawl of the ghaita, a double-reed instrument, and the resounding pound of the tebel drum, which is made of goatskin and struck with wooden sticks. Bachir and Mustapha Attar are the sons of Hadj Abdesalam Attar, who led the Master Musicians when they made their first recordings in the 1960s. At this concert, part of the continuing A World in Trance festival, the Attar brothers will perform alongside three improvising musicians based in the United States: the saxophonist and clarinetist Ned Rothenberg; the saxophonist, vocalist and visual artist Arrington de Dionyso; and the percussionist Ben Bennett.917-267-0368, roulette.org BROKEN SHADOWS at the Village Vanguard (through March 31, 8:30 and 10:30 p.m.). The alto saxophonist Tim Berne, an outré doyen of the New York music scene, writes runic, sharp-edged, fiercely desiccated tunes. They’re a lot of fun if you’re the type who likes to question the entire phenomenology of “tunes” or, better yet, “fun.” Broken Shadows, his new band, which is about to release an album on the subscription-only Newvelle Records imprint, is more immediately rambunctious. This music is easy to sing along with, and to move to, partly because the group mostly plays the compositions of Ornette Coleman, and partly because of the personnel: the underappreciated tenor saxophonist Chris Speed, the wily bassist Reid Anderson and the gallivanting drummer Dave King.212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com EDDIE HENDERSON at Smoke (March 28-30, 7, 9 and 10:30 p.m.). In big-band jazz and bebop, a trumpeter was often responsible for adding a flare of percussive energy to the upper reaches of a group’s sound. In later forms of jazz, more heavily influenced by funk and soul, the instrument sometimes played more of a steadying role — holding sultry tones, projecting calm — while the rhythm section addressed questions of impact more directly. Eddie Henderson is comfortable in both circumstances, though he is more commonly associated with the jazz-funk movement of the 1970s, when he was known for work in his own bands and those led by Herbie Hancock. He performs here with Donald Harrison on alto saxophone, Peter Zak on piano, Essiet Okon Essiet on bass and Mike Clark on drums — most of whom appeared on “Be Cool,” Henderson’s strong album from 2018.212-864-6662, smokejazz.com SUSIE IBARRA at H0L0 (March 31, 7 p.m.). Ibarra plays the drums with cool precision and a sense of architectural awareness that befits a great composer. After all, she’s that too. Always blazing a new creative trail, she will present at H0L0 a fresh project, “Bird Songs,” featuring original music inspired by bird calls, with Jake Landau on guitar and keyboards and Jean-Luc Sinclair on electronics. The cellist Leila Bordreuil and the vocalist and performance artist Lauren Tosswill will open the show with separate solo performances.h0l0.nyc MARCUS MILLER at the Rose Theater (March 29-30, 8 p.m.). During the 1980s, Miller was the bassist and musical director in some of Miles Davis’s final bands; he wrote and produced almost every tune on “Tutu,” Davis’s Grammy-winning jazz-pop album from 1986. Here Miller will present a concert surveying the panorama of Davis’s electric period, which stretches back to the late 1960s, in an octet featuring Brett Williams on keyboards, Alex Han on saxophone, Marquis Hill and Russell Gunn on trumpet, Vernon Reid on guitar, Alex Bailey on drums and Mino Cinelu on percussion. Each night’s concert will be preceded by a discussion with Miller at 7 p.m.212-721-6500, jazz.org ‘TWO WINGS: THE MUSIC OF BLACK AMERICA IN MIGRATION’ at the Stern Auditorium (March 30, 8 p.m.). The operatic mezzo-soprano Alicia Hall Moran and the pianist Jason Moran, a MacArthur fellow, like to think beyond the idea of multimedia performance. In 2012, with “Bleed,” they transformed a floor at the Whitney Museum of American Art into a zone of convergence and exchange, inviting dozens of performers, scholars and healers to collaborate over a period of days. And on Saturday they will debut “Two Wings,” a community-crafted project that uses the Morans’ own family lore to interrogate the history of America’s Great Migration. The Morans’ fellow performers will include the vocalists Pastor Smokie Norful, Toshi Reagon and Hilda Harris, and the Imani Winds quintet. The historian Isabel Wilkerson will read portions of her definitive account of the Great Migration, “The Warmth of Other Suns.” The concert is part of “Migrations: The Making of America,” a continuing festival produced by Carnegie Hall.212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO "

But the building has changed hands and the club seems safe for now. By Karen Zraick You could say that stepping into Terraza 7, a tiny, eclectic and fiercely beloved music club on the border of Jackson Heights and Elmhurst, Queens, is like taking a trip to Latin America. But that’s not exactly right. Yes, many of the patrons speak Spanish, and the rhythms you’ll hear may have originated in Central or South America. But the bar is a classic New York archetype, a remix that aims to bring together diverse musical traditions and blend them into something new. Freddy Castiblanco, the energetic owner of the bar, sought to foster that syncretism when he opened Terraza 7 in 2002. Its name is a reference to indigenous agricultural practices as well as the 7 train, which rumbles past along Roosevelt Avenue. The bar showcases many types of folk music, jazz, salsa, cumbia and other genres.  But the club’s future had been in doubt since 2016, when the owner of the building at the time announced plans to raze it and build a high-rise. In December of last year, after many months of anxiety, Mr. Castiblanco, 47, received some good news. The building had changed hands again and the new owner said he would keep it as it was. And he would keep the club’s rent low. Mr. Castiblanco is still waiting for a new lease, but he is cautiously optimistic.  Mr. Castiblanco had been a doctor in Colombia, but decided to emigrate amid what he said was a crisis in the country’s health care system in the late 1990s. He arrived in New York in 2000, and as he set about learning English, his father, who already lived in the city, spotted an empty storefront and suggested opening a business there.  Mr. Castiblanco envisioned a bar with live music that would allow his neighbors to celebrate and share their songs and stories.  “I wanted it to be a laboratory,” Mr. Castiblanco said.  On a Saturday in March, the space hosted three events back-to-back-to-back: a Spanish-language poetry reading in honor of Women’s History Month; a wedding of two musicians who met at the bar; and a concert by a Cuban jazz band. “Terraza 7 is a very generous place with all the artists,” said Juana Ramos, a professor at York College, who helped organize the poetry reading. “They always open the door for us.” The bar also serves as a hub for local activists. It hosted a town hall with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez last year when she was running for Congress and a campaign fund-raiser for Jessica Ramos, who won a State Senate seat last November. Mr. Castiblanco has also run for office. Last year, he made a bid to represent the Colombian diaspora in that country's Congress. He lost, but he’s had other types of victories: Mr. Castiblanco introduced Jose Manzano and Lorens Tatiana Barrios, the musicians who ended up getting married at the bar, to each other, and he was among those snapping photos as they said their vows.  “She came through the door and it was like, ‘Oh my God.’ We started talking about music and ever since that night, we didn’t stop seeing each other. After a month, we decided to get married. It just felt right. It feels right.” — Jose Manzano, 34  After the ceremony, the guests watched video messages from the bride’s family in Barranquilla, Colombia, and the couple performed their first dance to a vallenato song, “Mi Novia Mujer,” by Rafa Pérez. Both the bride and groom perform in vallenato bands; he plays the accordion and she sings, often at Terraza 7. Ms. Barrios also tends bar there and coordinates Monday-night karaoke.  “This place is very dear to me,” said Elena Bernal, a wedding guest and a Terraza 7 regular who grew up nearby.  Ms. Bernal, who is 30 and Colombian-American, said she cherished that such a unique venue with so much Spanish-language music existed.  “It helped me embrace my roots,’’ she said, “and showed me how to be in touch with a deeper me.” Illustrations by Julia Wertz "

Sondra Radvanovsky sings the title role for just three performances in this brief reprise of the one of the Met’s most famous and opulent productions, and they should not be missed. Jorge de León is Radamès, Olesya Petrova is Amneris, Stefan Kocan is Ramfis and Soloman Howard is the King. Plácido Domingo conducts.212-362-6000, metopera.org ETHEL at the Jewish Museum (Feb. 28, 7:30 p.m.). Julia Wolfe has become most notable in recent years for working on a large scale, particularly with “Fire in My Mouth” and her Pulitzer Prize-winning “Anthracite Fields,” but here is an opportunity to delve deep into her chamber music, with a first-ever concert of her complete string quartets performed by the contemporary foursome Ethel.212-423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org ‘FALSTAFF’ at the Metropolitan Opera (Feb. 22 and 27, 8 p.m.; through March 16). Ambrogio Maestri returns for Verdi’s late, great comedy to sing the lead, a role that the baritone owns. Robert Carsen’s production was widely acclaimed when it first appeared at the Met in 2013, and benefits here from a cast that includes Golda Schultz as Nannetta, Ailyn Peréz as Alice, Marie-Nicole Lemieux as Mistress Quickly and Jennifer Johnson Cano as Meg Page. Richard Farnes conducts.212-362-6000, metopera.org NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC at David Geffen Hall (Feb. 28, 7:30 p.m.; through March 2).

Jean-Yves Thibaudet is the pianist.212-875-5656, nyphil.org [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] ORCHESTRA OF ST. LUKE’S at Carnegie Hall (Feb. 28, 8 p.m.). There’s nothing more innovative in this program than Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven, but sometimes there’s nothing more satisfying than Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven. The orchestra’s principal conductor, Bernard Labadie, leads Haydn’s overture to “L’Isola Disabitata” and his Symphony No. 45, the “Farewell,” as well as Beethoven’s Piano Concerto No. 2 and Mozart’s concert aria “Non temer, amato bene.” The soloists are luxury casting: Paul Lewis is at the keyboard; Ying Fang is the soprano.212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org MATTHEW POLENZANI at Zankel Hall (Feb. 24, 3 p.m.). One of the Met’s leading tenors appears with the pianist Julius Drake for a recital featuring Schubert, Beethoven, Brahms and, most intriguingly, Janacek, in the form of “The Diary of One Who Disappeared,” for which Polenzani is joined by the mezzo Jennifer Johnson Cano and a trio of offstage female voices.212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org INBAL SEGEV at Roulette (Feb. 28, 8 p.m.).

5c2fbcb23a125f5075c02e49,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/arts/music/new-years-sounds-the-week-in-classical-music.html,"[Read all of our classical music coverage here.] Happy new year! The Metropolitan Opera rang in 2019 with a boffo “Adriana Lecouvreur,” featuring a love triangle of Anna Netrebko, Anita Rachvelishvili and Piotr Beczala with enough sizzle to lead some critics to warm to the not-always-respected work. More on that in a second. I was more than 4,000 miles away, celebrating in Vienna with a life-affirming 26-hour musical marathon: Strauss’s ‘’Die Fledermaus” at the State Opera on New Year’s Eve; more Strauss the next morning at the Vienna Philharmonic’s New Year’s Concert in the Musikverein; and the Vienna Symphony playing Beethoven’s Ninth that evening. Is there a more musical city? In the New York of my childhood, aggressive street hawkers offered drugs to passers-by. In Vienna they sound almost as furtive, but their pitch is: “Concert? Opera? Strauss? Mozart?” Here are some postcards. MICHAEL COOPER I’ve often wondered: Do the star conductors the Vienna Philharmonic brings in each year for its New Year’s concerts actually conduct, given that this music is practically this orchestra’s birthright? When I entered the mostly empty, majestically gilded Musikverein to watch the players rehearse with Christian Thielemann, the principal conductor of the Dresden Staatskapelle and music director of the Bayreuth Festival, I got an inkling. As he took to the podium, the shimmering strings announced that he was beginning the rehearsal at the end, with the traditional encore: Strauss’s “Blue Danube” Waltz. It is perhaps the most famous waltz there is, and one the orchestra could probably play in its sleep. But Mr. Thielmann was not one to let the players set the coordinates to 3/4 time and go on cruise control. He stopped them quite a bit, at one point asking the cellos to shape one of its most familiar phrases differently, and he continued fine-tuning the piece until he was happy. “It is wonderful to work with a strong partner,” Mr. Thielmann said in an interview, saying that he prefers orchestras like the Vienna Philharmonic, with strong points of view, to those that treat scores as blank slates to be filled in by conductors. “The weak partners are difficult.” The New Year’s concert must be the world’s most widely seen regularly held classical music event: It is televised in 91 nations, and before the month is out, Sony plans to release it on CD, DVD and Blu-ray. This year there were 14 cameras in the hall; some of the cameramen hid behind the copious floral arrangements, like hunters in a duck blind. It is not easy to bring off “Die Fledermaus” these days. Should it be updated? Translated? Made “relevant”? Can it be performed with a suitably Viennese sensibility? Without such second-guessing, the Vienna State Opera’s unapologetically old-fashioned Otto Schenk production, with opulent sets by Günther Schneider-Siemssen, still holds the stage on New Year’s Eve, as it has for years. (Mahler conducted the work when he led the company.) There were a few flash moments — the bass René Pape was the special guest in the second act, singing “Some Enchanted Evening” at Prince Orlofsky’s ball — but the evening’s chief pleasure was getting to see a production that took the work neither too seriously nor too lightly. The waltzes lilted, the patter went by quickly enough, and the cast amused — especially Adrian Eröd, who brought humorous, easy physicality to the role of the duped Eisenstein, and Annette Dasch, who brought operatic glamour as his wife, Rosalinde. And walking out of the opera house in time for an al fresco mug of hot mulled wine, followed by a cold glass of champagne, on Kärntner Strasse, as fireworks exploded overhead at midnight, made the evening difficult to replicate. For more than four decades, the Vienna Symphony has marked the changing of the year with Beethoven’s Symphony No. 9. While the Philharmonic’s morning concert was in the gilded Musikverein — where golden, topless caryatids seem to hold up the balconies and the richly coffered ceiling is even more dazzling than the crystal chandeliers — the Symphony’s evening concert was in the stately Konzerthaus, with its Secessionist and Art Nouveau touches. Something about seeing the physical differences of the two halls — the Musikverein opened in 1870, the Konzerthaus in 1913 — brought home just how long Emperor Franz Joseph, who was in power for both openings, reigned. They evoke different eras. Andrés Orozco-Estrada, who will succeed Philippe Jordan as the orchestra’s music director in 2021, conducted, and managed to bring out the true strangeness of the Ninth. Under his baton Beethoven’s stops and starts and changes of direction still startled. The stars of the Met’s new production of “Adriana Lecouvreur” could not be better: the ravishing soprano Anna Netrebko in the title role, the smoldering mezzo-soprano Anita Rachvelishvili as the Princess of Bouillon, and the clarion tenor Piotr Beczala as Maurizio, the dashing count both women love. It’s easy to overlook several excellent singers in supporting roles, especially the baritone Ambrogio Maestri as Michonnet, the gruff stage manager of the Parisian theater company where Adriana is a headliner. With his beefy voice and Falstaffian physique, Mr. Maestri often sounds like a kind of basso. And Falstaff, his signature role, which he has sung to acclaim at the Met, has also been the province of some major bass-baritones and basses. Still, Mr. Ambrogio is a genuine baritone, albeit with an exceptionally deep and booming voice, who has excelled as Puccini’s Scarpia and, as this excerpt from an “Aida” in Florence some years ago makes clear, Verdi’s Amonasro. Here, joining Hui He in the intense Act III duet, Mr. Ambrogio brings a winning blend of Italianate lyricism and robust power to his singing. ANTHONY TOMMASINI "
5cae0db549f0eacbf1f82589,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/10/arts/music/t-bone-burnett-invisible-light.html,"Joseph Henry Burnett, known as T Bone, has spent most of his long career in music behind the scenes. He has won 13 Grammy Awards as a producer, music supervisor and songwriter for albums including “Raising Sand” by Robert Plant and Alison Krauss and soundtracks for “O Brother, Where Are Thou?,” “Walk the Line,” “The Hunger Games” and “Crazy Heart,” which also brought him an Oscar for collaborating on the best original song. Lately his projects have included producing Sara Bareilles’s new album, composing and choosing the soundtrack for HBO’s “True Detective” and working on the debut of a country singer, Logan Ledger. But every so often, Burnett carves out time to record under his own name. This week he releases “The Invisible Light: Acoustic Space,” the first album of a planned trilogy he recorded with the keyboardist Keefus Ciancia and the drummer Jay Bellerose. On his own and in his collaborations, Burnett has become known for twangy, rootsy, naturalistic rock. But “The Invisible Light” veers into stranger territory. Drumbeats lurch and sputter amid eerie, amorphous electronic sounds; instruments like guitars or pianos are relegated to the far distance. In that setting, Burnett speak-sings his way through free-associative songs that contain biblical allusions, echoes of the blues, tall tales, lovers’ plaints and warnings about disinformation, the cult of personality and the encroachments of technology. (The trilogy’s next installment, Burnett said, “is more rocking, more punk rock, and the third edition gets very, very jazz, pretty out there.”) A conversation with Burnett, 71, easily wanders from musical particulars to philosophical speculations and back. He spoke from his home and studio in Los Angeles, where he makes most of his music; he had been awake, he said, since 4 a.m. The following are edited excerpts from the interview. The songs on “The Invisible Light” revolve around technology and theology, with some very dark tidings. I called it “The Invisible Light” for two reasons. It’s from T.S. Eliot’s “Choruses From ‘The Rock’” — he refers to divinity that way. But also, I’m actually optimistic about humanity’s chances, and in all this darkness some light is also contained. Except you have to really listen into it to hear the mirth and the optimism. You also name-check songs like Delbert McClinton’s “Victim of Life’s Circumstances.” The whole album is full of references, and that’s part of the notion of it. Because artists really do only one thing. Artists say, “I went to this place at this time and I saw this thing and it was good.” And we mark it, we mark the things that we think are important and worthwhile. The material isn’t exactly songs or spoken words. How did it come together? I started writing a play with Marshall Brickman, and the ambition for the play is to get it to Broadway one day. That led me to study Frank Loesser, and Lerner and Loewe, and Stephen Sondheim and all the great Broadway writers. Writing for theater is very different than just writing hillbilly songs or rock ’n’ roll songs. You only have a couple of hours to tell the story, and everything in the song has to be part of the narrative. It takes a great deal of discipline. And so I started getting up at 4 every morning and writing for several hours when everything was quiet. I finished writing the music for the play in about a year. But because I’d gotten in the habit of waking up at 4 in the morning and writing, I’ve continued doing that, for about the last three years. It’s this evolving poem that must be about 5,000 lines now, which I would guess someday I will publish as a poem. That became the sheet music in essence. I would pull a group of lyrics out of this stuff and give it to Keefus and give it to Jay, and we would just start jamming. Melody is really codified inflection. In all of the lyrics there were melodies already hanging around in them, ghost melodies, and some were specific melodies. It’s maybe a form of Beat poetry. I certainly still think of myself as part of the Beat Generation. One song, “A Man Without a Country,” ends with two full minutes of ambient landscape sound, almost silent. Why? One could think of this album as a film that hasn’t been made that we’re scoring. Part of what we’re after is the fact that the electronic universe has been shrinking and fragmenting our attention spans for decades now. I want to create periods of time where people can just sit in pure sound without stimulation, where we can allow ourselves to relax into pure sound. It’s not really that nothing’s happening. It’s something’s happening but we don’t know what it is, so to speak. Musicians praise the drum sound in your productions, and drums are way up front on this album. What’s the secret? There was a time in the 1970s when everybody was dampening down drums and trying to take all the overtones out and focus purely on attack. But all of the most interesting sounds of the drums are the sounds of the overtones that react with one another and create other melodies and other rhythms within the piece. Which are the very things that get covered up by the guitars and the basses and the more normal instruments that are brought forward in a mix. By taking all those away you’re able to hear what the drums actually are doing. We do it by playing very, very softly so that the attack is minimized. The trick, if it’s a trick, or the technique since it is technology, is to place the microphones so that they hear all of the tone and the overtones of the drums and then they also hear the tone and overtones of the adjacent drums. The room we’re recording all these pieces in is a very small bedroom, so you can only play so loud. Yet the sound of the tracks suggests huge spaces. That is the idea, to conjure these open, wild spaces. We wanted it to be an indefinable place, a dangerous place, a dark place, yet within it there’s all this life. There are also a lot of warnings: about a “celebrity-in-chief,” about lies and willful self-deception. There’s an extraordinary experiment in behavioral modification going on now. We live in a time now where leaders emerge from fiction and create the politics of eternity where there are no facts. That’s an extremely dangerous place to live. The “politics of eternity” is from Timothy Snyder’s “The Road to Unfreedom.” I think it’s the most important book of the 21st century so far. It’s a well of sanity. Do you think about who your listeners are? No, other than that the listeners are human beings and I have a love and a caring for humanity, and I hope that comes through. This is anti-anti-human music. There’s a lot going on in the world that is anti-human at the moment, and this is fighting that. Art has to be irresistible. It can’t be pedantic or instruct or preach. I certainly have been accused of preaching in the past, and I hope I’ve overcome any tendencies I’ve had in that direction. More than preaching I’ve been raising the alarm. Hopefully I’ve gotten good enough at it so that I’m not preaching, but just ringing the bell. "
5c78309f49f0eacbf105ab61,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/28/arts/music/nate-wooley-review.html,"Taking on the largest ice field in the Rocky Mountains, a dramatic 125-square-mile sprawl along the border between British Columbia and Alberta, the composer and trumpeter Nate Wooley has created music of disarming intimacy. “Columbia Icefield,” his new work for quartet, isn’t really about depicting the grandeur of nature, à la Strauss’s “Alpine Symphony.” It feels, rather, like the musings of a man encountering that grandeur, or perhaps reflecting on it in his tent in the middle of the night — a mixture of quiet exaltation, wild exaltation, melancholy, fear, curiosity, struggle to keep warm. Played amid chilly, windswept weather on Monday evening at Pioneer Works, the cavernous factory turned cultural center in Red Hook, Brooklyn, the primary mood of “Columbia Icefield” is loneliness. But it is also very much ensemble music, a show of togetherness in the face of dread. In its cozier moments on Monday, it seemed like the prettiest (if most progressive) campfire music ever written. For the project, Mr. Wooley brought together a fresh group of established avant-jazz stars: He was joined for the hourlong performance — as on a recording, just released on Northern Spy Records — by Susan Alcorn (pedal steel guitar), Mary Halvorson (guitar) and Ryan Sawyer (drums and, in a crucial section, spoken-sung vocals). In the opening section, “Lionel Trilling” — your guess is as good as mine (Mr. Wooley’s literary allusions become clearer in the next two parts) — relaxed repetition inevitably turns into obsession and anxiety. Gentle strums of guitar at the start quickly expose rhythms that don’t quite fit together; the drums can evoke a heart beating a little too fast. Moments, both for guitar and for trumpet, seemed to be winking at the famous three-note stepwise motif at the start of Strauss’s “Also Sprach Zarathustra,” the riff that scores the dawn in “2001: A Space Odyssey.” In “Columbia Icefield,” by contrast, it never quite reaches the octave: Rather than achieving a triumphant vantage, this music is modest, ambivalent. The composer’s role, Mr. Wooley suggests, is to question and imply, not to assert or proclaim. The second section, “Seven in the Woods,” its title drawn from a Jim Harrison poem, feels like Mr. Wooley’s aria, his playing smokily soft. When the guitars enter, it’s in an almost hymnlike spirit; fluttery guitar is answered by trumpet, and then they tumble along in tandem for a bit. With some of the words obscured by the music, as if in a snowstorm, Mr. Sawyer reads one of John Berryman’s “Dream Songs” in the final part, “With Condolences” — a shuddering, driving conclusion, and an artful balance between vastness and privacy. The concert was the first event in a new monthly series at Pioneer Works, False Harmonics, which promises to feature “two unique performances meant to contrast yet complement each other.” To that end, the “Columbia Icefield” artists were preceded by MV Carbon, who made a rich, ripping noise on electric cello, vocals and electronics. Her set was far louder and more overtly dramatic than the one that followed. But it couldn’t compete with the pristine integrity and shaggy poignancy of “Columbia Icefield,” often gloomy yet somehow never quite depressing. "

Instead, Meek Mill took the long way to the top, first gaining credibility as a battle rapper and flirting with mainstream success, which was derailed by protracted legal battles and stints in prison. The strength of the work from the early years of his career, though — especially “Dreams and Nightmares,” the album cut that has become every underdog’s anthem, and the rapper’s best-known song — helped him push through.

Weezer have continued to release albums at a fairly prolific clip and still own a significant chunk of the alt-rock canon, from “Say It Ain’t So” to “Hash Pipe.” Their most recent brushes with the mainstream, though, have been less expected — namely, a viral cover of Toto’s “Africa.” After playing three nights at the comparatively cozy Brooklyn Steel last November, Pixies are bringing their unorthodox noise pop back to one of the city’s biggest stages.212-465-6741, msg.com NATALIE WEINER EZRA COLLECTIVE at Rough Trade NYC (March 9, 8:30 p.m.). Afrobeat from the 1970s, woozy new R&B, dub reggae and classic backpacker hip-hop all help define the sound of this London-based band’s new disc, “You Can’t Steal My Joy,” due next month. They have become something of a sensation, and the album is likely to be one of the year’s most-talked-about releases from Britain’s thriving contemporary jazz scene. The group — which features the brothers T. J. and Femi Koleoso on bass and drums, respectively; Joe Armon-Jones on keyboards; Dylan Jones on trumpet; and James Mollison on saxophone — will play material from the coming disc at this Brooklyn rock club.roughtradenyc.com VIJAY IYER AND CRAIG TABORN at Roulette (March 12, 8 p.m.). Two leading jazz pianists in their late 40s, Iyer and Taborn each have their own specific formulas, but both are built on a mix of studious abstraction and propulsive weight. Next week they will release their first album as a duo, the expansive, richly improvised “The Transitory Poems,” on ECM Records. The crystalline scatter of Taborn’s playing meets Iyer’s slightly thicker articulation in a sympathetic repartee; the pair seem to constantly divert their own path. They celebrate the album’s arrival at this concert, playing on two grand pianos.917-267-0368, roulette.org ‘IDENTITY: FREEDOM’ at the Kitchen (March 7-9, 8 p.m.). The nonprofit organization Arts for Art organized this series of concerts to highlight some of free jazz’s most respected elders, all of whom are presenting suite-length original works here. The festival begins on Thursday with “Trail of Tears Continuum (1492-2019),” a 90-minute piece composed by the bassist William Parker (a founder of Arts for Art) featuring singers, poets and a five-piece instrumental group, as well as a film component. On Friday, the pianist Dave Burrell debuts “Harlem Renaissance,” a response to the life and work of the dancer Josephine Baker; Burrell’s sextet will play in conversation with two dancers, Marguerite Hemmings and J’royce Jata. The series concludes on Saturday with a presentation of Andrew Cyrille’s “Haitian Fascination” project, in which this storied drummer fuses the music of Haiti — his ancestral home — with avant-garde jazz.212-255-5793, thekitchen.org MIYA MASAOKA at the Park Avenue Armory (March 13, 7 and 9 p.m.). Masaoka’s style on the koto, a long, stringed instrument from Japan, bespeaks deep equanimity: She is comfortable allowing vast amounts of open space — playing quietly, just a few notes at a time — but within that serene composure she strategically builds a feeling of tensile anticipation. You can lie down and stretch out inside her music, but you can’t ever get completely comfortable. An eclectic collaborator across the worlds of traditional and avant-garde music, at the armory she debuts “The Long Arc of Time,” a work inspired by traditional Japanese Buddhist chants and by the poetry of Tracie Morris. The performance will feature Masaoka alongside fellow Japanese and American musicians and the soprano Kamala Sankaram.212-616-3930, armoryonpark.org OMAR SOSA AND SECKOU KEITA at Merkin Hall (March 9, 7:30 p.m.). Sosa, a Cuban pianist of great percussive power and fluid grace, released a collaborative album in 2017 with Keita, a Senegalese master of the kora (a West African stringed instrument typically used to create spiraling layers of rhythm), and the Venezuelan percussionist Gustavo Ovalles. Here the trio will perform some of the pristine, soothing music from that release. All three of these musicians now live in Europe, so a New York sighting is rare — especially featuring all of them together.212-501-3330, kaufmanmusiccenter.org KAMAAL WILLIAMS at Le Poisson Rouge (March 9, 7:30 p.m.). This young keyboardist crafts tightly woven grooves that are equally influenced by the cosmic soul-jazz of the 1970s as they are by the broken-beat and nu-jazz traditions of his native London. Partly thanks to his work in the short-lived but widely acclaimed duo Yussef Kamaal, Williams finds himself at the front of a crowded pack of young keyboardists on the busy British scene. Here he’s likely to draw heavily on the material from his debut solo album, last year’s Herbie Hancock-indebted “The Return.”212-505-3474, lpr.com MIGUEL ZENÓN at the Village Vanguard (March 12-17, 8:30 and 10:30 p.m.). One of the most casually prodigious alto saxophonists of today, Zenón devotes most of his creative energy to exploring the music of his native Puerto Rico, always through a vigorously intellectual lens. Last year he released a striking album, “Yo Soy La Tradición,” featuring music sourced largely from Puerto Rican folk traditions, retrofitted for saxophone and string quartet. And later this month, he will join up again with his longstanding jazz quartet to record a new album devoted to the music of Ismael Rivera, a heroic popular vocalist in Puerto Rico during the late 1960s and the ’70s. At this Vanguard run, the group — featuring Luis Perdomo on piano, Hans Glawischnig on bass and Henry Cole on drums — will set about breaking in this new material.212-255-4037, villagevanguard.comGIOVANNI RUSSONELLO LOU REED DRONES at the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine (March 13, 6:30 p.m.).

5c91306649f0eacbf105de6c,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/19/obituaries/jh-kwabena-nketia-dead.html,"J. H. Kwabena Nketia, a Ghanaian ethnomusicologist and composer who became the world’s leading scholar on African musical traditions, died on March 13 in Legon, a suburb of Accra, the capital of Ghana. He was 97. His death, at a hospital, was confirmed by the composer Fred Onovwerosuoke, who studied with Dr. Nketia and became a close friend. In a career stretching back to the 1950s and continuing into his 90s, Dr. Nketia wrote hundreds of articles and books in English and Twi, a Ghanaian language, on topics ranging from music theory to folklore, as well as scores of compositions. He held professorships at the University of California, Los Angeles; the University of Pittsburgh; and the University of Ghana, where he helped shape the curriculum after Ghana broke free from British rule. His 1974 book, “The Music of Africa,” is widely considered a definitive historical study, and “Ethnomusicology and African Music,” a collection of his writings published in 2005, is used in classrooms throughout Africa and across the world. As a composer, Dr. Nketia wrote music for choirs, solo voices and instrumental groups that used both African and Western instruments. His music was particularly informed by the sounds of Ghana, but he integrated influences from across the African continent. In his academic work, too, Dr. Nketia espoused a Pan-African ideology even as he insisted on the multiplicity of sub-Saharan cultures. “The most important characteristic of this family of musical traditions is the diversity of expressions it accommodates, a diversity arising from different applications of common procedures and usages,” he wrote. “The music of Africa, like its language, is, so to speak, ‘ethnic-bound.’ Each society practices its own variant.” Dr. Nketia devised ways of using Western techniques to document and analyze African music while preserving its indigenous characteristics. He revolutionized how the rhythms of sub-Saharan African music are transcribed, employing the 6/8 time signature rather than a simple two-beat measure. And his studies went beyond rhythmic analysis. He made a point of championing the diversity of harmonic languages used throughout Africa as well. “He always wanted to ensure that the West knew about the diversity of our harmonic language,” Dr. Onovwerosuoke said. Robert Farris Thompson, a professor emeritus of art history at Yale University, wrote in an email that Dr. Nketia was “one of the finest scholars in all of post-colonial Africa,” adding, “He showed that the African history of music was a sacred tradition revealed.” Joseph Hanson Kwabena Nketia was born on June 22, 1921, in Asante Mampong, Ghana. In the Akan language, Kwabena is the name for boys born on Tuesday. An only child, he was raised by his mother and maternal grandparents after his father died. He credited his grandparents as his first music teachers. He received training in European music theory as a high school student at the Presbyterian Training College in southeastern Ghana. In 1944, he was one of 20 Ghanaians in the first class awarded Britain’s Commonwealth scholarship, which sent him to England to study linguistics at the School of Oriental and African Studies. He also took classes at the Trinity College of Music and Birkbeck College at the University of London. In 1952, back in Ghana, he accepted a research fellowship in African studies at what is now the University of Ghana and traveled the country recording musical performances and festivals. He began developing interdisciplinary programs at the university that explored the intersections of language, dance, music and folklore. Dr. Nketia traveled to the United States for the first time in 1958, on a Rockefeller Foundation fellowship; over the course of a year he studied at Juilliard, Columbia University and Northwestern University, and developed relationships with such prominent American musicians and folklorists as Charles Seeger and Henry Cowell. Dr. Nketia performed “The Republic Suite,” perhaps his defining musical composition, at Ghana’s Republic Day Concert on July 1, 1960, celebrating the election of his friend Kwame Nkrumah as the nation’s first president. The suite’s formal elements aligned it with Western classical music, but many of its melodies were drawn from traditional songs recognizable to Ghanaian listeners. Dr. Nketia became the deputy director of the University of Ghana’s new Institute of African Studies in 1961. Three years later, having attained tenure as a full professor, he became the first African to serve as the institute’s director. Soon after, he became the founding director of what is now the School of Performing Arts, and he filled its faculty and research positions with prominent Ghanaian artists, including the playwright Efua Sutherland, the author Ama Ata Aidoo and the choreographer Albert Mawere Opoku. In 1992 he founded the International Center for African Music and Dance, an archive based at the university. Dr. Nketia was the recipient of many awards and worked with a number of international cultural organizations, including Unesco’s International Commission for a Scientific and Cultural History of Mankind. Tireless in his scholarship, he delivered lectures at universities on five continents well into his later years and published his last book, “Reinstating Traditional Music in Contemporary Contexts,” in 2016, on the eve of his 95th birthday. He is survived by three daughters, Akosua Adoma Perbi, Priscilla Naana Nketia and Adjoa Nketia; seven grandchildren; and nine great-grandchildren. His wife and their two sons, Kwabena Yeboa Nketia and Eric Kwame Gyimah Nketia, died before him. Dr. Nketia’s grandson Kwame Ametepee Tsikata, a famed Ghanaian rapper known as M.anifest, remembered him as “very generous with all his knowledge and his wisdom.” “He had an incredible intellectual curiosity,” Mr. Tsikata said, “until the end.” "
5cafa87649f0eacbf1f83123,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/arts/music/music-exhibitions-leonard-cohen-instruments-punk.html,"A man’s voice recites lines from a poem as fantastical low-resolution images of cityscapes are projected on a screen in a darkened room. “When I couldn’t sleep/I learned to write,” we hear him say. “I learned to write/what might be read/on nights like this/by one like me.” The lines come from Leonard Cohen’s “The Only Poem,” and the visuals, by Jon Rafman, are a collection of processed found photos and landscapes from video games that take the words somewhere far away and transform Cohen’s crisp verse into the narration of a dream. This piece can be found in “Leonard Cohen: A Crack in Everything,” an exhibition celebrating the life and work of the singer-songwriter, who died in 2016. It comes to the Jewish Museum on Friday after a run in Montreal.  The lines from “The Only Poem” speak to the almost mystical bond between those who create art and those who consume it. When a transmission like the one described in the poem happens in pop music, particularly fertile ground for intense longing of all kinds, we might hear a fan say, “That song saved my life.” This emotional identification is, to varying degrees, the animating force behind four current museum shows that center on music, including “A Crack in Everything” and exhibitions at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Arts and Design and the Museum of Sex. Each has something to say about how pop music fits into our lives, how we absorb its history, what it means to present the pop experience in an institutional setting, and how people use music to find themselves. At the Met, “Play It Loud: Instruments of Rock & Roll,” which opened Monday, seeks to enrich what you already know, telling a familiar narrative through objects that seem like stars in their own right. Presented in collaboration with the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, “Play It Loud” offers a vision of history in which the rock music that flowered in the 1960s and ’70s sits firmly at the center. The format of the rock band provides the structure of the show, with one room given over to the rhythm section (here we see a double bass from the low-end legend James Jamerson, whose playing provides the rhythmic drive for dozens of Motown hits, as well as drum kits from the Beatles and Metallica) and another showcasing “Guitar Gods,” featuring instruments from Eric Clapton, Jerry Garcia and many more. Another room has a display highlighting the guitar’s destruction, with pieces of instruments trashed by Kurt Cobain and Pete Townshend. To the extent that it shifts focus toward the tools of the rock trade, the show is illuminating. Of particular interest is the room set aside for “Creating a Sound,” which focuses on the sonic possibility of electronics and includes beautiful objects like the first Moog modular synthesizer owned by Keith Emerson of the progressive rock band Emerson, Lake & Palmer. Emerson’s instrument is a towering monolith with patch cords hanging off it like an automaton’s viscera, and it highlights how the story of popular music is bound to technology. The Moog presents itself as a roadie’s worst nightmare — it’s almost impossible to imagine a crew packing up a machine of such complexity and loading it onto a truck for the next show. The lighting in “Play It Loud” is dim, perhaps reflecting rock music as the sound of the night. Each individual instrument shines like a beacon, as if it’s catching the glint of an onstage spotlight. It makes the space between audience member and musician seem vast, but that doesn’t diminish the wonder of browsing the tools once used by pop royalty. One of the defining principles of punk, in contrast, is that this gap should be much narrower. “Too Fast to Live, Too Young to Die: Punk Graphics, 1976-1986,” which opened Tuesday at the Museum of Arts and Design, adheres to this stricture. The presentation, curated by Andrew Blauvelt, director of the Cranbrook Art Museum in Michigan, is modest, befitting the humble beginnings of the images on display, and the show offers a fascinating look at how punk and new wave music met the eye. Many of the objects on display in “Too Fast to Live” were first hung in record stores or in the bedrooms of teenagers. Posters promoting new albums, tours and shows are mixed in with album art, zines, buttons and other miscellany. Most of the pieces are affixed to the walls with magnets and are not framed, and almost all show signs of wear. The presentation reinforces that this was commercial art meant for wide consumption, and the ragged edges and prominent creases in the works make the history feel alive. That enduringly ragged aesthetic extends to the design itself. Punk as an idea has never left the conversation and retains its aura of cool. Peter Saville’s iconic image for Joy Division’s “Unknown Pleasures” album, for example, seen here in a promotional poster, could just as easily be found on the T-shirt of a current high school student. Early on, punk’s cheap, trash-culture aesthetic bumped up against the art world, and the mix of high and low makes “Too Fast to Live” a rich show. One room focuses on the influence of comics, as seen in posters for the Angry Samoans and the Damned, while large and beautiful Stiff Records tour posters, designed by Barney Bubbles, bring to mind Warhol’s screen prints. But while the range of style and aesthetics on display is striking, almost everything here was created for a specific commercial purpose, and directed squarely at those who loved (and might one day love) these bands. The display of buttons that once decorated book bags and jean jackets drives this home. “Too Fast to Live” ultimately feels like a celebration of record culture and fandom. Through these objects, most of which were very inexpensive, a subset of music fans defined themselves as part of a tribe. The Museum of Sex has a show that comes at punk from another angle, illustrating the visceral core lurking beneath these iconic images. “Punk Lust: Raw Provocation 1971-1985” essays a secret history of this music, one based on the presentation of desire. In the exhibition, which opened in the fall, chain-link fencing surrounds mannequins adorned with fetish gear, and between that and the rivet-studded steel floors, you feel like you’re inside one of the trash-strewn early 1980s downtown New York clubs on display in films like Slava Tsukerman’s “Liquid Sky” or Martin Scorsese’s “After Hours.” As music movements go, punk rock, which, at its extremes, can be nihilistic or politically didactic, isn’t necessarily associated with sex. But “Punk Lust” suggests that carnal energy throbs at the music’s core. The show begins with imagery from the Velvet Underground: the 1963 paperback of that title, an exploration of what was then called deviant sexual behavior and gave the band its name, is one of the first objects on display. Working through photos, album art and fliers by artists like Iggy Pop, the New York Dolls, Patti Smith, and, yes, the Sex Pistols, the exhibition demonstrates how punk offered a space for sexual expression outside the mainstream. In the story told by “Punk Lust,” much of it laid out in placards by the writer and musician Vivien Goldman, one of the show’s curators, graphic sexual imagery is a tool for shock that frightens away the straight world and offers comfort to those who remain inside. While some of the power dynamic is typical — underage groupies cavorting with rock stars — images from female, queer and nonbinary artists like Jayne County and the Slits make a strong case for sex as an essential source of punk liberation. That sexual expression in music can encompass both crude pornographic fliers created by Adam Ant, which are on display in “Punk Lust,” and also the cool and elegant sensuality coursing through the work of Cohen, says something about how vast the subject is. The erotic side of Cohen’s catalog is one focus among many in “A Crack in Everything,” an exhibition that shows rather than tells. The curators of the show, John Zeppetelli of the Musée d’Art Contemporain de Montréal, and Victor Shiffman, commissioned artists of various disciplines to develop pieces inspired by Cohen. Some are simple and quiet, like “Ear on a Worm” from the film artist Tacita Dean, a small image playing on a loop high in the space that shows a perched bird, a reference to “Bird on the Wire” from Cohen’s 1969 album “Songs From a Room.” Some are closer to traditional documentary, like George Fok’s “Passing Through,” which intercuts performances by Cohen throughout his career with video that surrounds the viewer, suggesting the songs are constant and eternal while the performer’s body changes with time. Candice Breitz’s installation “I’m Your Man (A Portrait of Leonard Cohen)” gathers video portraits of 19 men over the age of 65 singing and humming Cohen’s songs. Each is life-size and high resolution, and the effect of walking through the room is as if the men were present. It’s a breathtaking meditation on fandom, aging and impermanence. (Cohen remained fully immersed in the last two subjects. His final album, “You Want It Darker,” a meditation on his own mortality, was released a month before his death at 82, after a fall in the night.) Taken together, the layered work on display in “A Crack in Everything” has a lot to offer on Cohen, but even more to say about how we respond to music, bring it into our lives, and use it as both a balm and an agent for transformation.

5c9e656f49f0eacbf105fcec,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/29/arts/music/kate-soper-new-york-festival-of-song-review.html,"For much of music history, songs were accompanied by an instrument that could act as a foil to the human voice. In recent decades electronics have often taken the place of the lute or piano, with dramatic effects. When the taped sounds contains snippets of the voice itself — recorded either beforehand or sampled live in performance — the distinction between song and accompaniment dissolves. But there’s also a risk that this dialogue with technology becomes little more than an echo chamber, too insular and self-validating. On Thursday at the DiMenna Center, the New York Festival of Song presented an evening of works for voice and electronics that sometimes felt sterile and self-absorbed. The program was designed by the composer and vocalist Kate Soper and opened with her performing her own “The Understanding of All Things.” The text is by Kafka and imagines a philosopher who snatches spinning tops from playing children in an attempt to understand reality. Ms. Soper’s setting takes a dryly literal approach, with recorded sounds of a spinning top mixing with scrambled phrases and her own live, fragmented, recitation. The attentive sound artist here and throughout the evening was Sam Pluta. Electronics can blur the border between human and machine-made sounds in a way that allows artists to play on themes like alienation, objectification and the splintering of the self. The composer Natacha Diels’s “Bahnhof” was a twist on the ancient myth of Philomela, the abused woman who, deprived of speech, turns into a nightingale. For this potentially arresting work — the props malfunctioned on Thursday — the soprano Charlotte Mundy donned special gloves outfitted with sensors at the fingertips and tethered with cables to a laptop. Standing, marionette-like, with outstretched arms, she produced wordless vocalizations accompanied by clicks, pops and wet sputters. In “quarks” the vocalist Charmaine Lee and Mr. Pluta created a dystopian world of thuds, gurgles and sandy abrasions through extended vocal techniques that were creatively miked, processed and amplified at often brutal volume. (One contact mike was taped to Ms. Lee’s neck with what looked like medical bandage.) At the center of a program of caustic sounds two works from the late 1990s formed an oasis of radiant beauty. In three selections from Alvin Lucier’s “Wave Songs,” Ms. Mundy produced long held notes on top of electronic sine waves in such a way that the minute pitch differences created a gently pulsating massage in the listener’s ear. Kaija Saariaho’s “Lonh” was a stunning example of the expressive riches that electronics can produce in the hands of a master of tone color. The text, by the medieval troubadour Jaufré Rudel, is the same one that inspired her luscious opera “L’Amour de Loin.” Here, the taped backdrop shimmered and bloomed underneath Ms. Mundy’s warm and soft-grained soprano in a way that deepened the sense of a lover drunk on unconsumed passion. The concert ended with two excerpts from an opera Ms. Soper is developing that also draws on medieval poetry — the “Romance of the Rose” — but uses texts of her own and by contemporary poets. “Shame’s Triple Aria Transformation,” performed with dramatic conviction by Devony Smith, distorts the voice with screechy, serrated effects. Ms. Soper performed the second selection, as an allegory of Reason, in which a neo-Classical piano part adds arch prettiness to a text that cleverly spins variations and puns on the same key words. In the electronic score microtonal dissonances similar to those in Mr. Lucier’s “Wave Songs” add a pale throbbing halo around the voice like a migraine aura. In “Lonh” the taped score drew the listener into a closer state of identification with the character. Here the electronics ensured cool detachment. "

5c49fd603a125f5075c0623c,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/24/arts/music/desolation-center-punk-desert-concert-film.html,"Under the first full moon of 1985, the psychedelic punk band Meat Puppets shredded in the depths of the Mojave Desert, powered by a generator and surrounded by incandescent cactuses. Some 500 pink-haired, leather-clad punks had traveled — many in a caravan of yellow school buses — from downtown Los Angeles to what was advertised only as a “remote desert location.” Those who came to the gig, called the Gila Monster Jamboree, in cars were given hand-drawn maps directing them to a checkpoint in Victorville, Calif., where they received a second guide, pointing three miles down a dirt road to a dry lake bed. Many were on acid. “It all seemed like a cartoon,” the Meat Puppets guitarist Curt Kirkwood said in an interview. “It was someplace no one was supposed to be.” In her memoir, the Sonic Youth bassist and singer Kim Gordon called her band’s performance that day — its first on the West Coast — one of her “favorite shows ever.” [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] The spectacle was a part of Desolation Center, a series of guerrilla punk shows in Southern California that set an adventurous precedent that lingers today. Fifteen years before the world’s highest-grossing festival started, Gary Tovar, the founder of Goldenvoice, which produces Coachella, attended a Desolation Center gig. Perry Farrell, who helped mastermind Lollapalooza, played the Jamboree with his pre-Jane’s Addiction group Psi Com. These anarchic desert happenings didn’t last long — they ran from 1983 to 1985 — and have rarely been celebrated, but now their history is chronicled in a documentary called “Desolation Center” that premieres this week at the Slamdance Film Festival in Park City, Utah. Its director is the Desolation Center organizer Stuart Swezey, who began booking shows in 1982 as a 21-year-old college dropout. Growing up amid incendiary late-70s L.A. punk, Swezey was galvanized by the self-starting ethos of underground zines and labels. A self-described autodidact who “found out about Nietzsche from Adam Ant,” he followed the great question mark of punk where it led. “What about venues?” he recalled wondering. “How could we question the assumptions of how you see music performed?” “I felt this compulsion to take music out of nightclubs,” he said in a phone interview, explaining that he preferred the community and spontaneity of unconventional spaces like the Hong Kong Cafe in Los Angeles — a former Chinese restaurant that was loudly overtaken by bands including Black Flag and the Bags — or an Elks Lodge. “It feels more authentic when it’s somewhere it shouldn’t be happening. You’re taken out of your everyday reality.” Swezey was in Mexico, traversing the Sonoran Desert and listening to the L.A. post-punk band Savage Republic, when he decided to book shows in the desert. Like his favored permutations of punk, the landscape was austere, spatial and extraterrestrial. Better still, the desert location would dodge the L.A.P.D., who had shut down Swezey’s earlier efforts at booking downtown warehouse shows. He and the Savage Republic guitarist Bruce Licher tracked down the owner of the remote dry lake-bed property, but did not get in touch. “We looked at each other and said, ‘No one’s going to say yes to us doing this,’” Swezey said. With the San Pedro band Minutemen on board, Swezey advertised $12.50 tickets with photocopied fliers and sold 115. He found a sound person with a generator; arranged the buses, which added “a performance art aspect,” he said; and the “Mojave Exodus” journeyed out on April 24, 1983. Fearing that he might repeat himself after two desert outings — the 1984 event included the imposing German industrial band Einstürzende Neubauten and the terrifying Bay Area machine artists Survival Research Labs — Swezey sought out the complete opposite: He booked Meat Puppets and Minutemen to play on a whaling boat. With the sound system tied to the guard rails, they cruised the shadowy San Pedro and Long Beach harbors after dark. “The barrier between participant and performer blurred,” Swezey said. “We were all part of this bigger thing.” The Jamboree returned to the desert the next year, and Thurston Moore, writing by email, described the mood as “one of complete joy and wonder at being together in a place that might as well have been another planet.” He said the most radical attribute of Desolation Center was that “it asked no permission,” and he called the show “one of the great moments” in the history of Sonic Youth. Swezey’s film illustrates the eclecticism of his early ’80s Southern California scene: the trilling art punks Suburban Lawns, the guitar-less Screamers, the savage performance art of Johanna Went. He interviews Desolation Center musicians including Moore and the Einstürzende Neubauten vocalist Blixa Bargeld, as well as enthusiastic concertgoers (one identified as “sorceress,” another, “failed visionary”). Crucially, Swezey illuminates the necessity of taking the counterculture further underground, as punk continued to clash with the L.A.P.D. under its chief, Daryl Gates. “The L.A.P.D. freaked out about punk rock,” the Germs drummer Don Bolles says in one scene, “and they were gonna squash that stuff.” The film shows the authorities turning up at a Ramones show in riot gear, inciting what the attendee Linda Kite calls “tactical violence on children.” Punk shows were effectively outlawed; punks hid to keep going. This anti-authoritarian impulse thrilled the Burning Man co-founder John Law in 1990, who had heard of Desolation Center’s myth. “It really stuck in my mind,” he said in an interview. “I thought it would be great to do something crazy in the desert.” Law was inspired by Swezey to book early Burning Man locations at the intersection of three separate counties, where, he said, “the evil cops couldn’t get at you.” Free as the desert’s sprawl can be, it was unkind to the glam punks Redd Kross, who got lost for hours in a cramped beater car when they played the Jamboree. “We thought we were going to die,” said the bassist Stephen McDonald, who was 16 at the time of the gig. “I wasn’t much on navigation. Now I am obsessed with navigation.” After their Jamboree, Meat Puppets did not linger: “It started to sink in: ‘Oh, we shouldn’t be here,’” Kirkwood said. Swezey eventually paid $400 in trespassing fees to the federal government, then ceased organizing shows to helm the bookshop and publisher AMOK, and work in television. “Desolation Center” is his first film as a director. “Maybe it’s a good thing, watching a movie about people making something out of nothing in a nowhere place,” the Minutemen bassist Mike Watt said in an interview. He began to recite something of an impromptu beat poem: “No cookie cutter, no sleepwalk, no rubber stamp, no cruise control. You gotta feel the bumps in the road.” Swezey took those ideas to heart. “D.I.Y. is now a shorthand for a lot of things,” he said. “But the idea that you can have a wacky idea and get a bunch of people to go along with it, and make it happen even with very limited resources — that was life-affirming.” "
5cb34b5349f0eacbf1f83ef2,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/14/theater/charlie-rosen-broadway.html,"In a recording studio in Williamsburg, Brooklyn last month, where wood paneling on the walls and ceiling gave off the faint scent of pine, Charlie Rosen stood in front of 17 fellow musicians, smiling. Chiefly known for his work on Broadway, Mr. Rosen bopped along to the music, baton comfortably in hand, while the ensemble played the score of a Nintendo racecar game. With a TV on mute providing cues, he and his 8-Bit Big Band were recording the music from Mario Kart 64, blown way out with 36 instruments, including saxophones, trumpets, trombones, 11 violins, three cellos and a harp. “You got everything we need for that section?” he asked his engineer. “Great. Let’s move on to Level 3.” At 28, Mr. Rosen is an orchestrator, composer and arranger with his hands in many musical cookie jars. He is the music supervisor and orchestrator for Broadway’s “Be More Chill,” a show for which he also plays guitar in the pit. He has one big band devoted to video game songs and another devoted to theater music, which will perform at Feinstein’s/54 Below on Monday. Mr. Rosen also produces commercial soundtracks for the skin care company Olay out of his tiny home office in Harlem, where he stashes 52 instruments in a 9-foot-by-10-foot room that overlooks a quiet side street. There’s a melodica, a flugelbone, a zither and a theremin, which makes the ooo-oo-ooo sound from old sci-fi movies and is played by waving your hands around in the air. If you count what he calls his “toys” — like harmonicas, tambourines and a kalimba — Mr. Rosen has 70 instruments at home. He can play them all. “That’s insane,” he said after counting. “I’m insane.” This collection represents more than a nifty party trick. Indeed, while he considers himself primarily a bass player, his facility with so many instruments is part of what makes him such a valuable orchestrator. “It’s kind of like cooking,” he added. “The more spices you’re familiar with, the more you can combine them to create new flavors in places you might not expect.” Once a year, he estimates, he’ll be working on piece of music and think, “You know what this needs? A bass melodica.” Mr. Rosen exists as a sort of bridge between genres and generations, embracing Broadway standards, pop songs and the music of Tetris. And all of it funnels into his work. Marc Shaiman, a Tony-winning theater and Oscar-nominated film composer, described Mr. Rosen as a big talent, but without the eccentricities that sometimes come along for the ride. “It’s the kind of talent where I almost want to hate him,” Mr. Shaiman said. “But I can’t.” Jennifer Ashley Tepper, a producer on “Be More Chill” and the creative and programming director of Feinstein’s/54 Below, described him as a hub for young Broadway musicians, since, between his bands and the shows for which he hires, he employs so many of them. “He’s an unbelievably calm and steadying source,” Ms. Tepper said. “When you find out that a big press person is coming, or that something has fallen apart and we can’t put it back together, he’s the first person to be like, ‘O.K., let’s come up with a plan.’” Mr. Rosen, an easy-to-smile bundle of bearded energy, has lived in the same six-bedroom Harlem apartment since he was 22, with a rotating cast of roommates. His girlfriend, Danielle Gimbal, does the copy work for his music and is a frequent presence in his home and at recording sessions. Raised in Los Angeles, Mr. Rosen is the son of a classical bassoonist (his mother, who also plays flute, clarinet, piccolo and sax) and an organist (his father, who also plays guitar, banjo and accordion). A full sized Wurlitzer pipe organ, the kind from silent-movie houses, sat in his childhood home. [What’s new onstage and off: Sign up for our Theater Update newsletter] When he was 3, his parents noticed he could tell if a note played on the piano was white or black — he had perfect pitch. So he started on the piano, with his mother as his first teacher. He didn’t set out to work on Broadway. But as a 15-year-old jazz student at a performing arts high school, he auditioned to play in the pit for a regional production of the musical “13” — and off he went. He attended Berklee College of Music in Boston for four semesters, on and off between Broadway shows. He gravitated to courses he felt would help him professionally, like music production, arranging and Afro-Caribbean percussion. His main gigs now are playing guitar for “Be More Chill” — his instrument, dressed for the occasion, wears a brown hair bow on its headstock — and co-orchestrating the production of “Moulin Rouge!” scheduled to open on Broadway in July. (On the first day of performances for “Be More Chill,” he was told by his union’s new leadership that contract rules prohibited him, as the show’s orchestrator, from playing in the band, but he was put back in while the contract is being renegotiated.) Thanks to Mr. Rosen, “Be More Chill” features a theremin, which does its electronic ooo-oo-ooo thing when a mind-controlling super computer dies. There is also a flugelbone, which he described as his “orchestrating secret weapon”: It’s a horn that can be managed by a trumpet player but can sound sort of like a French horn or a trombone, which allows one musician to produce a variety of timbres for a small orchestra. Joe Iconis, who wrote the music and lyrics for “Be More Chill,” said Mr. Rosen’s ability to have so many instruments in his head, but also so many different kinds of music, both old and new, can give his work an air of “magic.” “His breadth of knowledge of music of all types is just intimidating,” Mr. Iconis said. “As much as he knows the synth sound that was used on the latest Ariana Grande record, he knows the model of trombone used in orchestration for ‘How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying.’” Mr. Rosen has lots of plans — he’d like to write music for video games, score a film, be commissioned by a major symphony orchestra to write a piece — but no particular endgame in mind, he said. He just wants to keep going. “You don’t get to be Charlie without being insanely ambitious,” said Jason Robert Brown, who was the composer and lyricist for “13” and has worked with Mr. Rosen on several concerts and shows since. “But I think it’s really an ambition to have as much music in his life and in his head and in his mouth as he possibly can. He just loves making music.” "

LIZ COOPER & THE STAMPEDE at Rough Trade (Feb. 27, 9 p.m.). This lilting Nashville rock trio gives new meaning to the label “easy listening” with their tempered, dreamy psychedelia. Gentle grooves and softly arpeggiated guitars take the place of sprawling, climactic jams, yet their songwriting is taut enough that the audience is never in danger of being lulled to sleep. The band has made refining their live show a priority, touring their songs for three years — including as support for Bermuda Triangle, the side project of the Alabama Shakes frontwoman Brittany Howard — before heading into the studio. Their 2018 debut, “Window Flowers,” is summery and bright, well suited to mitigating New York’s winter chill.718-388-4111, roughtradenyc.com THE DREAM at the Bowery Ballroom (Feb. 26, 8 p.m.). Praising this producer, singer and songwriter for fidelity to his artistic vision might seem odd. After all, he is responsible for some of the biggest pop hits of the past 15 years, including Rihanna’s “Umbrella” and Beyoncé’s “Single Ladies.” In his work as a solo artist, though, the Dream remains steadfast in his commitment to achingly slow, explicitly bedroom-ready R&B jams. Combining his high, often-AutoTuned voice with layers of synths and understated beats, he has made himself into a new model of R&B maestro. 212-260-4700, boweryballroom.com JULIA HOLTER at Warsaw (Feb. 22, 9 p.m.). To call Holter a singer-songwriter feels reductive, given the wide-ranging abstract soundscapes she creates with a nearly endless array of instruments and electronic tools. In her compositions, this California native finds common ground between the baroque and the futuristic, the ancient (her latest album, “Aviary,” includes a musical interpretation of a poem by Sappho) and the modern (another track was inspired by Alice Coltrane’s “Universal Consciousness”). The one thing listeners won’t find in Holter’s music is compromise: It’s about as unusual and boundary pushing as anything labeled pop music can get, and all the more exciting for it. 212-777-6800, warsawconcerts.com JOHN MELLENCAMP at the Beacon Theater (Feb. 25-27, 8 p.m.). This legendary rock singer and songwriter is best known for his ability to capture the heartland — as he describes in his biggest hit, “Jack & Diane” — in accessible, catchy songs. But since his 1980s heyday, Mellencamp has shed most of the trappings of commercial rock (including his myriad stage names) in favor of more straightforward blues arrangements courtesy of the super-producer T Bone Burnett. For his latest album, 2018’s “Other People’s Stuff,” Mellencamp produces and performs, revisiting a number of covers he had previously recorded in the rootsy style that is now his signature.212-465-6000, beacontheatre.com SON LITTLE at BRIC House Ballroom (Feb. 28, 8 p.m.). The folksy blues put forth by this Philadelphia-based singer-songwriter, who has also written songs for Mavis Staples and collaborated with the Roots, can be intimate, acoustic and mostly unadorned, or up-tempo and groovy, as it is on his most recent album “New Magic.” A deep understanding of classic American roots music ties his records together, lending them old-school credibility even as the occasional unorthodox production choice gives his work a contemporary feel. The Canadian singer-songwriter Melissa Laveaux and the folk singer Christopher Paul Stelling open. 718-683-5600, bricartsmedia.org SON LUX at the Appel Room (Feb. 28, 8:30 p.m.). The art music composer Ryan Lott, the experimental drummer and percussionist Ian Chang and the jazz-schooled guitarist Rafiq Bhatia have forged their talents to create airy, unconventional pop under the name Son Lux. Incredibly active as soloists, these artists channel their more esoteric skills into this project, which attracts alternative rock and electronic music audiences as well as aficionados of contemporary composition. In 2018, the trio released their fifth album, “Brighter Wounds,” which puts seemingly incongruous sounds — like screeching, dissonant strings and bluesy guitar riffs — adjacent to one another for a compelling, unpredictable result.212-721-6500, lincolncenter.orgNATALIE WEINER BRITTANY ANJOU at Le Poisson Rouge (Feb. 25, 8 p.m.). This pianist just released “Enamigo Reciprokataj,” a debut album with a double meaning: Translated from Esperanto, its title can mean “Reciprocal Love” or “Mutual Breakdown.” It makes sense that Anjou would speak in double-entendre, in a language that’s at once universal and abstruse. The album is full of broadly sourced melodies that are bright and lyrical and quick, and work by their own clever logic. (She has studied jazz in New York, Western classical in Prague, and gyil music in Ghana; she’s currently an artist in residence at Kuwait’s Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad Cultural Center opera house.) Anjou celebrates the release of “Enamigo Reciprokataj” with Greg Chudzik on bass and Shirazette Tinnin on drums. The bassist Ari Folman-Cohen will participate as a special guest.212-505-3474, lpr.com BRENT BIRCKHEAD at Nublu 151 (Feb. 22, 8 p.m.). When he’s not on the road with Lauryn Hill’s band, this alto saxophonist is often found in the basement of Smalls, partaking of late-night jam sessions with other young jazz improvisers. Struck with bluesy warmth and the relentless swing of Cannonball Adderley, Birckhead’s playing has lately established him as one of the most riveting young improvisers in New York. On his impressive debut album, “Birckhead,” his R&B sojourns and his straight-ahead jazz background come to bear, resulting in a sound that skates the divide between svelte swagger and cutting passion. The record finds the young bandleader meditating on romance, personal growth and the travails of his native Baltimore; he will celebrate its release at Nublu with Corey Wallace on trombone, Marc Cary on piano, Jon Michel on bass and Curtis Nowosad on drums.nublu.net PETER EVANS WITH MAZZ SWIFT AND RON STABINSKY at National Sawdust (Feb. 27, 7 p.m.). An unassailable young virtuoso on trumpet, Evans uses extended technique to create some of the most darkly inscrutable music around. At National Sawdust as part of John Zorn’s monthly Commissioning Series, Evans presents two sets of original music: a solo trumpet work, and a series of compositions for violin and piano, performed by Swift and Stabinsky.646-779-8455, nationalsawdust.org LOUIS HAYES at the Iridium (Feb. 22, 8 p.m.). This 81-year-old drummer plays straight-ahead jazz with a big, broad swing feel, and a built-in sense of the Afro-Latin underpinnings of jazz rhythm. His mix of nuanced syncopation and raw power helped define some quintessential hard-bop groups of the 1960s, led by figures such as Cannonball Adderley and Oscar Peterson. His most recent album as a leader is “Serenade for Horace,” from 2017, a tribute to the pianist Horace Silver. He appears here with Vincent Herring on alto saxophone, David Hazeltine on piano and Dezron Douglas on bass.212-582-2121, theiridium.com IRREVERSIBLE ENTANGLEMENTS, AMINA CLAUDINE MYERS AND NICOLE MITCHELL at Merkin Hall (Feb. 28, 7:30 p.m.). This concert brings together some of the most deeply rooted and wildly inventive storytellers in improvised music. A pianist and vocalist, Myers, 76, was an early member of Chicago’s Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians; she writes and performs music with hard-bound connections to gospel and blues, and an expansive approach to improvising. Mitchell, a flutist, became the association’s first female chair 10 years ago; her music often deals in grand themes of science fiction and heroism. The group Irreversible Entanglements is a scalding, free-improvising quintet featuring the young performance poet Camae Ayewa (known as Moor Mother in her solo work), who draws connections across epochs of African and American history, making sense of trauma and gathering power to take action today. At this Ecstatic Music Festival show, these three acts will perform together for the first time.212-501-3330, kaufmanmusiccenter.org ARUAN ORTIZ AND DON BYRON at Mezzrow (Feb. 27, 8 and 9:30 p.m.). Two ecumenical improvisers with a mix of jazz vocabulary and classical precision, Ortiz, a Cuban-born pianist, and Byron, an American clarinetist, released a powerful album of duets last year, “Random Dances and (A)tonalities.” It included takes on pieces by Duke Ellington, Johann Sebastian Bach and Geri Allen, as well as a few twisty, centrifugal original tunes. At Mezzrow, an intimate basement club, they will play repertoire from that album.646-476-4346, mezzrow.com KAMASI WASHINGTON at the Apollo Theater (Feb. 23, 8 p.m.). Over the past four years, Washington has made greater inroads into the mainstream than any jazz musician of his generation. He’s done it by threading together opposing traditions from his native Los Angeles, each with its own surprising resonance today: grooving, dance-inflected jazz-funk from the 1970s and ’80s, and the looser, more expressionistic music of avant-garde artists such as Horace Tapscott and Bobby Bradford. At the Apollo, leading a 10-piece iteration of his band, the Next Step, Washington will play selections from his hit albums, “The Epic” (2015) and “Heaven and Earth” (2018).212-531-5305, apollotheater.orgGIOVANNI RUSSONELLO REMEMBERING JONAS: A TRIBUTE TO JONAS MEKAS at City Winery (Feb. 21, 8 p.m.). If you desire another opportunity to honor Mekas’s life, Patti Smith, John Zorn, Lee Renaldo, Richard Barone, David Amram and Glenn Mercer are getting together to give you a musical one. Along with the film critic Amy Taubin and other special guests, these musicians are gathering tonight to pay homage to the pioneering filmmaker through song and spoken word. Proceeds will benefit Anthology Film Archives, Mekas’s dream home for avant-garde cinema that he made real with the help of Jerome Hill, P. Adams Sitney, Peter Kubelka and Stan Brakhage in 1970. 212-608-0555, citywinery.comDANIELLE DOWLING "

PAT GREEN at Terminal 5 (March 2, 7 p.m.). Escape to the Lone Star state at this show, which features four acts whose sound belongs to the Texas-specific country subgenre known as red dirt. Green, who had a string of radio hits in the mid-2000s, is the elder statesman of this lineup. He’ll be joined by the Eli Young Band, who are currently on the country charts with their upbeat single “Love Ain’t,” as well as by Aaron Watson and Kyle Park — two artists who are stalwarts on the rodeo circuit.

Gen Z might only know this pioneering Los Angeles-based rapper as an approachable blockbuster star or, most recently, one of the moguls behind the BIG3 basketball league. But this N.W.A. alum still has a rich catalog of songs that were once considered subversive but are now classic. Both in N.W.A. and as a soloist, Ice Cube helped revolutionize rap with his cleareyed lyrics about police brutality, white supremacy and gang life. His unflinching political observations continue on his 2018 release “Everythangs Corrupt,” which includes a song called “Arrest the President.” 212-582-6600, terminal5nyc.com INNOV GNAWA at National Sawdust (March 2, 7:30 p.m.). This collective of Moroccan expatriates makes gnawa, or ritual trance music. It bears some of the same stylistic traits as American blues: call-and-response singing and a stringed instrument (in the case of gnawa, a sintir) that is used to establish harmony. The complicated, endlessly cycling rhythms, though, are distinct to the genre and create a soothing, meditative ambience. This performance is billed not as a concert, but as an “immersive gnawa ritual.” 646-779-8455, nationalsawdust.org [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] LOVE ROCKS NYC at the Beacon Theater (March 7, 8 p.m.).

This year’s edition will star Robert Plant, Sheryl Crow, Buddy Guy, Grace Potter, Keb’ Mo’, Taj Mahal, Lukas Nelson, Doyle Bramhall II, Bernie Williams, Ivan Neville, Ann and Nancy Wilson, and more, while Whoopi Goldberg and Martin Short host. Even the house band will be filled with music’s A-listers, including Paul Shaffer, the former musical director of “Late Show With David Letterman,” and the prolific drummer Steve Gadd. 212-465-6000, beacontheatre.com THE NEW COLOSSUS FESTIVAL at various locations (March 7-10). For 35 years, the CMJ Music Marathon was New York City’s very own pleasantly overwhelming indie music festival, where up-and-coming artists took over performance spaces every October in the interest of getting heard by myriad journalists and record label reps trolling for talent. But it ended in 2016, and a new festival aims to fill the void it left behind while also catching international artists en route to South by Southwest in Austin, Tex. In its first year as a multiday event, at six different clubs across the Lower East Side, the event will feature over 100 acts, including the Canadian D.I.Y. act Ellis, the Brooklyn-based punk band Thick and the Norwegian alt-pop group Das Body. newcolossusfestival.com KODIE SHANE at S.O.B.’s (March 6, 8 p.m.). At a moment when there are more commercially successful women in rap than there have been at any point since the early 2000s — when, in fact, one of the genre’s biggest and buzziest artists, Cardi B, is a woman — it looks even more foolish than usual to define M.C.s like Chicago’s Kodie Shane by their gender. The 20-year-old rapper, who is based in Atlanta, first drew recognition as a member of Lil Yachty’s Sailing Team collective and favors similarly melodic, AutoTuned verses over trap beats. In place of Yachty’s whimsy, though, on songs like “Sing to Her,” Shane tends toward the undeniably sultry. 212-243-4940, sobs.com SUZANNE VEGA at Café Carlyle (March 5-9, 8:45 p.m.; through March 16). This New York-based singer-songwriter has been composing and performing folk-inspired acoustic tunes since she was a Barnard student in the early 1980s. The venerable cabaret Café Carlyle might be considerably more upscale than Tom’s Restaurant — the Upper West Side student haunt that inspired Vega’s enduring and influential single “Tom’s Diner” — but both offer a glimpse of a bygone New York. A product of the bohemian Greenwich Village folk scene, which has all but disappeared, Vega herself presents an evening of time travel to a completely different period in the city’s history. 800-405-2027, cafecarlylenewyork.com NATALIE WEINER AMBROSE AKINMUSIRE at the Village Vanguard (March 5-10, 8:30 and 10:30 p.m.). A young trumpeter at the top of his game, Akinmusire is coming off the release of last year’s “Origami Harvest,” his stellar fifth album, featuring long-form compositions for voice, string quartet and jazz combo. In the coming week he returns to the Vanguard — a familiar stomping ground — with his quintet, which features Walter Smith III on tenor saxophone, Sullivan Fortner on piano, Harish Raghavan on bass and Justin Brown on drums. Expect original music with a smoky, drifting aesthetic, and group interplay that overflows the formal boundaries of most small-group jazz.212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com KURT ELLING at the Rose Theater (March 1-2, 8 p.m.). An esteemed jazz crooner whose vocal power is matched by his cool sensitivity to each song, Elling presents the premiere of “The Big Blind,” a drama in the format of an old radio musical. Written by Elling and the composer Phil Galdston, it tells of a young jazz singer in midcentury Chicago who’s trying to catch his big break. The show’s cast includes the vocalist Dee Dee Bridgewater (a National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master), the stage actor Ben Vereen, the drummer Ulysses Owens Jr.’s New Century Jazz Orchestra and a Foley artist providing live sound effects.212-721-6500, jazz.org IMPROV NIGHTS at Happylucky No. 1 (March 1-2, 8 p.m.). John Zorn continues to expand the footprint of the Stone, his avant-garde presenting shop, which left behind its spartan digs in Alphabet City last year and moved to the New School’s Glass Box Theater. Now Zorn is planting a flag in central Brooklyn, too: This weekend his new series debuts at Happylucky No. 1, a gallery and event space in Crown Heights. The Stone will be programming concerts there each weekend going forward. (Bookings have already been made through the end of 2019.) Things are kicking off in classic Stone fashion: two nights of round-robin improvisations with some of New York’s leading creative musicians (the cellist Okkyung Lee, the guitarist Mary Halvorson, the percussionist Cyro Baptista and more than a dozen others) performing in randomly thrown-together configurations.www.happyluckyno1.com JULIAN LAGE TRIO at Le Poisson Rouge (March 5, 8:30 p.m.). Lage, a 31-year-old guitar virtuoso, just released a winning new album, “Love Hurts.” It might be the closest thing he’s released to a straight-ahead jazz record. But with the bassist Jorge Roeder and the drummer Dave King — two left-field improvisers a generation ahead of him — at his side, a freewheeling, rock-tinged vibe finds its way in through the seams. Ever the adaptive player, Lage leans into the influences of Pat Martino and John Scofield here, playing his distorted electric guitar in snaky, spiraling lines. The trio’s repertoire ranges from Ornette Coleman to Roy Orbison to some of Lage’s own tunes.212-505-3474, lpr.com ADAM O’FARRILL’S BIRD BLOWN OUT OF LATITUDE AND AARON BURNETT AND THE BIG MACHINE at National Sawdust (March 5, 7 p.m.). A blazing young trumpet talent, O’Farrill will unveil a new nine-piece ensemble that plays original music with a political bent: The tunes he writes for Bird Blown Out of Latitude are inspired by the traumas caused by displacement and forced migration. The tenor saxophonist Burnett is, like O’Farrill, an arresting improviser with an idiosyncratic, confrontational approach to composition. Here he will present material from his recently released album, “Anomaly,” with his combo, the Big Machine.646-779-8455, nationalsawdust.org LINDA MAY HAN OH QUINTET at the Miller Theater (March 2, 8 p.m.). As part of a continuing jazz series at the Miller, Oh, a young bassist, will lead a quintet, showcasing her sturdy, propulsive original compositions, likely drawing from her fine 2017 album, “Walk Against Wind.” Her band at the Miller features the alto saxophonist Greg Ward, the guitarist Matthew Stevens, the pianist Fabian Almazan and the drummer Allan Mednard.212-854-7799, millertheatre.com ALFREDO RODRIGUEZ AND PEDRITO MARTINEZ at Jazz Standard (Feb. 28-March 3, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). Rodriguez, a pianist, and Martinez, a percussionist and vocalist, are masters of Afro-Cuban rhythm who both hail from Havana, though they learned their craft in different settings: Rodriguez at clubs and solares — the housing units where much of Cuba’s African musical inheritance is passed down — and Martinez at various conservatories in the city. On “Duologue,” their new, Quincy Jones-produced album, the pair find plenty of generative energy in the space between their styles. They appear at the Standard in an unadorned duo.212-576-2232, jazzstandard.com GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO "

Directed by Zack Winokur, with text by Claudia Rankine and choreography by Michael Schumacher, the programs are set on the steps of the museum’s Great Hall and feature the International Contemporary Ensemble.212-535-7710, metmuseum.org CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER at the Rose Studio (Jan. 17, 6:30 and 9 p.m.). New music from a series that has shaken off a previously crusty image, with the Escher String Quartet and the pianist Gilles Vonsattel on hand for Per Norgard’s String Quartet No. 10, William Bolcom’s Suite for Violin and Cello, Ed Bennett’s “For Marcel Dzama,” and “All Roads” by Anthony Cheung.212-875-5788, chambermusicsociety.org SABINE DEVIEILHE at Weill Recital Hall (Jan. 17, 7:30 p.m.).

If you can find a ticket, snap it up. 212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org EKMELES at the Crypt of the Church of the Intercession (Jan. 17, 7:30 p.m.). “Madrigals and Animals,” the title of this concert from a consistently enlightening vocal ensemble, includes three United States premieres. Amid Karola Obermüller’s “mass:distance:time,” Claus-Steffen Mahnkopf’s “void – un delitto italiano” and Carola Bauckholt’s “Instinkt,” note in particular the first American performance of Salvatore Sciarrino’s “12 Madrigali.”ekmeles.com NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC at David Geffen Hall (Jan. 16, 7:30 p.m.; through Jan. 22). Jaap Van Zweden is back on the Philharmonic’s podium this week, and the main event is Rachmaninoff’s Symphony No. 2, a real test of whether the conductor’s usually hard-driven style can work in predominantly lyrical works. Also on the bill is Beethoven’s Piano Concerto No. 2, with Yefim Bronfman at the keyboard.212-875-5656, nyphil.org ORPHEUS CHAMBER ORCHESTRA at Carnegie Hall (Jan. 12, 7 p.m.). On a program perhaps most notable for the appearance of the sensitive pianist Javier Perianes in Mozart’s Piano Concerto No. 27, there’s also Mozart’s Symphony No. 33, an arrangement of Dvorak’s Bagatelles by Dennis Russell Davies and James Matheson’s “Still Life.”212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org ‘PELLÉAS ET MÉLISANDE’ at the Metropolitan Opera (Jan. 15, 7:30 p.m.; through Jan. 31). Jonathan Miller’s production of Debussy’s seductive, allusive opera returns, but unfortunately for only five shows. The Met’s music director, Yannick Nézet-Séguin, conducts all but one of them (Derrick Inouye leads the performance on Jan. 31), with a cast that includes Isabel Leonard as Mélisande, Paul Appleby as Pelléas, Kyle Ketelsen as Golaud, Marie-Nicole Lemieux as Geneviève and Ferruccio Furlanetto as Arkel.212-362-6000, metopera.org For an overview of January and February’s cultural events, click here.

5ca4f79849f0eacbf1f80a6f,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/03/arts/music/khalid-free-spirit-review.html,"With his 2017 debut, “American Teen,” Khalid (whose last name is Robinson) arrived as a teenager from El Paso, speaking for fellow teens, with a peer group of “young dumb broke high school kids” — a little proud, a little humble and mostly just dazedly matter-of-fact. With his long-breathed croon floating over unassuming low-fi production, he sang about circumscribed but smartphone-connected lives, misfiring romances and looming life choices. The immediacy of his melodies, the Everyteen sensibility of his lyrics and the direct yearning in his voice quickly found a wide audience. More than a billion streams, five Grammy nominations (though no wins) and a 2018 EP (“Suncity”) later, Khalid’s second full-length album, “Free Spirit,” grapples with a more singular, more isolated experience: coming to terms with fame, wealth, broader horizons and lingering insecurity. “Is this heaven or Armageddon?” he wonders in “Free Spirit.” He has moved from “we” to “I.” The music cushions his unease. It’s a generous album — 17 songs — that rolls along smoothly for nearly an hour, one leisurely midtempo groove after another, while Khalid’s voice conveys far more longing than agitation. He has upper-echelon producers now (among them John Hill, Digi, Charlie Handsome and Hit-Boy), and he’s separating himself from the twitchy, narrow-band approach of the SoundCloud rap crowd. He’s also learning from R&B’s more distant past. On the new album, Khalid embraces a fuller sound that often harks back to the 1980s and 1990s, with pillowy synthesizers, tickling guitars and multiple layers of his own vocal harmonies. In “Self,” Khalid strives to balance self-doubt — “The man that I’ve been running from is inside of me” — and self-preservation; the track, produced by Hit-Boy, lurches forward on a boom-bap beat and surrounds Khalid with glimmering keyboards and echoey vocals. In “Twenty One” — his current age — Khalid woos someone while he confesses his own turmoil: “I’m in pain/But I’m to blame/To end this fight/I have to change.” Yet there are handclaps, pop-rock guitars and layered vocals to bolster him and make sure he gets through. Success hasn’t made Khalid sleazy or arrogant. He doesn’t take partners for granted; he also understands the pop potential of respectful flirting. “Talk,” produced and co-written by the English duo Disclosure, is a male analogue of Janet Jackson’s “Let’s Wait Awhile,” telling an eager partner that slowing things down a little will bring them closer. “Can’t we just talk/figure out where we’re going,” Khalid requests, ever so politely, as syncopated synthesizers tick and blip around him. “Better,” which includes production by the Norwegian duo Stargate, celebrates the sensual bliss of a secret affair: “Just hold me in the dark/No one’s gotta know what we do,” he urges, amid floating piano chords and a swirl of his own naturalistic and sampled vocals. “Nothing feels better than this,” he exults. But Khalid can’t stay cocooned in romance. For much of the album, he’s out on his own, coping with internal anxieties and external pressures. On “American Teen” he had high school classmates who shared his fun and frustrations; on “Free Spirit,” they’ve been replaced by business associates with their own motives. “Bad Luck” glides along on gently ticking drums and a lacework of guitars, distantly suggesting Marvin Gaye’s “Sexual Healing,” yet it’s anything but reassuring. All Khalid sees around him is shallowness and duplicity: “No one really means it when they’re wishing you well/I got no one to call, no one/and people only love you when they’re needing your wealth,” he sings in a sweet, sad falsetto. And in “Hundred,” he marches through countless obligations and glances at the dubious “friends” who surround him: “Everybody wants a favor, everybody needs me/But I’m too busy trying to fight away all of my demons.” He doesn’t conquer those demons on “Free Spirit”; nor does he succumb to them. Instead, he suspends them in melody and rhythm, recognizing them and staring them down. He doesn’t pretend to be a hero or an antihero — just a young man alone, trying to get through life with some honest grace. "

EL GRAN COMBO AND LA SONORA PONCEÑA at Radio City Music Hall (Feb. 16, 8 p.m.). That two of the world’s most enduring and renowned salsa bands are booked at a theater with permanent seats is a bit of a head scratcher, but few performance spaces are large enough to accommodate the legions of fans both El Gran Combo and La Sonora Ponceña have accrued during their decades of performance. Both bands hail from Puerto Rico; the former was founded in 1962 by Rafael Ithier, who still leads it today, while the latter was established in 1954 — eight years after its current leader, Enrique Lucca Jr., was born. Expect plenty of dancing in the aisles. 212-465-6225, radiocity.com INTERPOL at Madison Square Garden (Feb. 16, 8 p.m.). This show is a homecoming for these indie stalwarts, who met at N.Y.U. and started making dark, stripped-down rock music in the late 1990s. Fifteen years after their breakthrough album “Antics” and on the heels of their 2018 release “Marauder,” Interpol is back at the Garden with a remarkable opening lineup that provides a good snapshot of alternative rock music today. You’ll want to get to the arena early to catch Snail Mail, the name under which the buzzy singer-songwriter Lindsey Jordan performs, and the breezy indie favorites Car Seat Headrest. 212-465-6741, msg.com METRIC AND ZOÉ at Kings Theater (Feb. 18, 7 p.m.). The brash, synth-driven, dance-inspired rock of Toronto’s Metric has remained relatively constant over the 16 years since the band’s first studio album, “Old World Underground, Where Are You Now?” — the zeitgeist, though, has shifted dramatically. When they came onto the scene, Metric was surrounded by like-minded alternative rockers such as TV on the Radio and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. But even as Metric’s music veers from the trend, they appear indefatigable; 2018’s “Art of Doubt” is a testament to their artistic vitality. The Mexican rock band Zoé, who have shown similar endurance over their nearly two decades at the forefront of their genre, co-headline this Brooklyn show. 718-856-5464, kingstheatre.com BOB MOULD BAND at Brooklyn Steel (Feb. 21, 8 p.m.). As the frontman for the bands Hüsker Dü and Sugar, this singer and guitarist found his niche with cathartic yet approachable rock jams. Hüsker Dü, who were active through most of the 1980s, have attained considerable retroactive renown for the way their blend of punk and alternative rock anticipated grunge. Their niche acclaim stands in stark contrast with Sugar, Mould’s band in the early 1990s, which had a brighter sound and hits on Billboard’s alternative charts. His latest release, “Sunshine Rock,” is almost like a blend of these two styles, combining the fierceness of Hüsker Dü with the optimism of Sugar. 888-929-7849, bowerypresents.com PANDA BEAR at Pioneer Works (Feb. 14-15, 7 p.m.). Animal Collective’s co-founder Noah Lennox has released six solo albums under this zoological alias, stretching out the band’s signature experimental, reverb-heavy dance music to include even more unexpected sounds and forms. Lennox’s most recent album, “Buoys,” eschews some of those ornate layers of synths and chaotic postproduction effects that have made his work so psychedelic and instead embraces straightforward songs that put his own, relatively unobscured voice front and center. Where his last album, “Panda Bear Meets the Grim Reaper,” had a harder edge, “Buoys” features gentle, acoustic songs that still have some unconventional filigree. 718-596-3001, pioneerworks.org [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] THE ’70S SOUL JAM VALENTINE’S CONCERT at the Beacon Theater (Feb. 16, 3 and 8 p.m.). It’s hard to think of a genre more explicitly associated with romance than the R&B and soul of the 1970s, with the lush arrangements and seductively slow tempos. Fittingly, some of the artists behind the era’s date-night-appropriate hits will gather for two Valentine’s Day-themed shows on the Upper West Side. Featured artists include the Philadelphia-based soul groups the Stylistics (“You Are Everything”), the Delfonics (“La-La Means I Love You”) and Blue Magic (“Sideshow”); the funk-inflected band Bloodstone (“Natural High”); and the quiet storm pioneers the Manhattans (“Kiss and Say Goodbye”). 212-465-6085, beacontheatre.com VINCE STAPLES at the Hammerstein Ballroom (Feb. 21, 8 p.m.). At 25 years old, this rapper from Long Beach, Calif., has made three critically acclaimed albums that flirt with rap’s avant-garde while retaining mainstream credibility. His music and his public persona — the sardonic Twitter star who wears his gang affiliation (Crips) and his Sprite endorsement on his sleeve with equal aplomb — suggest that this praise has not skewed his lucidity regarding the streets he grew up on and still uses as source material. His latest release, “FM!,” is a concise 22 minutes of songs that are as fun to listen to as they are thought-provoking. 212-279-7740, mc34.comNATALIE WEINER ETHNIC HERITAGE ENSEMBLE at Nublu 151 (Feb. 21, 8 p.m.). A master percussionist and eminence of Chicago’s creative music scene, Kahil El’Zabar channels a deep sense of history into his music, coming away with something timeless and universal and enchanted. For over 40 years, he has led the Ethnic Heritage Ensemble, usually as a trio featuring a rotating cast of horn players and flutists. But he recently expanded it into a quartet, with Alex Harding on baritone saxophone, Corey Wilkes on trumpet and Ian Maksin on cello. At Nublu the band celebrates the release of “Be Heard,” which will be out in March on the audiophile Spiritmuse Records.nublu.net MORGAN GUERIN QUINTET at the Jazz Gallery (Feb. 15-16, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). Though still in his early 20s, Guerin has already started to accrue a reputation as a jaw-dropping musical polymath. On Friday, he will play drums and bass in a quintet performing new, original music; on Saturday, he will again perform his own tunes with a five-piece band, but this time he will be on a saxophone, an electronic wind instrument and a synthesizer. If the music is anything like his two releases thus far (“The Saga” and “The Saga II”), it will be a broadly sourced form of contemporary electric fusion, centered on luminous, morphing textures and elegantly lyrical songwriting.646-494-3625, jazzgallery.nyc KIRK KNUFFKE TRIO at Zinc Bar (Feb. 20, 7:30 and 9 p.m.). A cornetist, Knuffke has a strong sense of his instrument’s history and expressive range, but his playing seems always tinged with a playful optimism. He has been one of the most compelling sidemen on the New York scene for at least a decade now, and more recently he’s been quietly releasing a series of fascinating albums of his own. The most recent, “Witness,” found Knuffke teaming up with the operatic baritone Steven Herring, plus two fellow jazz improvisers. It was unlike any other album in recent memory — and at times utterly transporting. Here Knuffke appears in a trio featuring the bass guitarist Stomu Takeishi and the drummer Bill Goodwin.212-477-9462, zincjazz.com JOE LOVANO, DAVE LIEBMAN AND GREG OSBY at Birdland (Feb. 19-23, 8:30 and 11 p.m.).

For the eighth year in a row, Reeves will headline Jazz at Lincoln Center’s main stage during Valentine’s Day weekend. She became a National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master last year, adding a punctuation mark to a career already known to be one of the most distinguished in jazz. Her voice has the power and clarity of Sarah Vaughan’s, and her repertoire only continues to expand: Her most recent album, “Beautiful Life,” from 2014, which won a Grammy, included riveting, personalized renditions of tunes by Fleetwood Mac, Bob Marley and Esperanza Spalding, as well as some Reeves originals.212-721-6500, jazz.org DAYNA STEPHENS QUARTET at the Village Vanguard (Feb. 19-24, 8:30 and 10:30 p.m.). A tenor saxophonist of svelte articulation and beaming tone, Stephens plays contemporary jazz with an emphasis on emotive clarity. His improvisations hold your attention thanks to careful, smart pacing, and Stephens’s willingness to sprinkle moments of simple beauty into his counterintuitive flights.

5ca751b949f0eacbf1f81266,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/05/arts/music/avicii-tim-bergling-new-music.html,"STOCKHOLM — For the last six months, the music producer Carl Falk has been venturing into his dark and cloistered recording studio in central Stockholm to collaborate with a ghost. “I was trying to produce through someone else’s eyes and ears — someone who’s not here,” he said with vexed intensity, while sitting at his control board. “It was really hard not to criticize yourself the whole time. Would he like this? What would he have done?” The “he” Falk referred to — Tim Bergling, a.k.a. Avicii, the genre-redefining dance-pop songwriter and producer of global hits like “Levels” and “Wake Me Up” — died last April 20 at the age of 28 during a vacation in Muscat, Oman. A statement from his family at the time stated, “He could not go on,” and while they still decline to go into the details of his death, they are publicly acknowledging the death was a suicide. The family, still very much grieving, is also breaking its nearly yearlong silence with two announcements: the arrival of newly completed Avicii music and the formation of a charitable organization called the Tim Bergling Foundation that will support groups involved with mental health and suicide prevention. A full album, titled simply “Tim,” is due out in June, and its first track, “SOS,” arrives on April 10. “Tim,” which counts Falk among its core production and writing team, is not a posthumous collection of musical leftovers. Instead, it concentrates on songs the artist was far into writing and producing during the last three months of his life, songs which, his friends say, he very much wanted released. Together, the sounds and sentiments they offer represent a cohesive and striking leap ahead for a musician already known as one of the most impactful innovators in electronic pop of the last decade. “This was a different Tim,” said Falk. “A Tim that wanted to say something.” To illuminate the origins of Avicii’s final songs, and to speak more candidly about his suicide, his father sat for his first formal interview since his son’s death. Avicii’s oldest friends spoke, too, as did his most trusted songwriting and production partners in the studios where they have just completed work on the project. All 12 who spoke were in agreement about one thing above all: Not only did they not see Avicii’s death coming, they insisted that in the months before it happened, he was in the best spirits they had seen him in for well over a year. “He had so many plans,” said Lucas Von Bahder, a close friend since middle school. “There were things he wanted to do, places he was going to go.” Albin Nedler, a collaborator who was staying in Avicii’s Los Angeles home when he left on his trip, recalled his saying he was “ in a really good place.” Another creative partner, Vincent Pontare, communicated with Avicii when he was on the plane to Oman. “He was super excited,” he said. “We talked about doing the album after this.” Their testimony stands in dramatic contrast to the image of the star presented by the documentary “Avicii: True Stories,” which debuted on Netflix in Sweden directly after his death and in the United States this past December. The film, which friends say had the musician’s enthusiastic approval, portrayed an artist who seemed to be having a slow-motion nervous breakdown brought on by the relentless pressures of success and a brutal touring schedule. “My life is all about stress,” he says at one point in the film. “It will kill me.” The movie also chronicled Avicii’s struggles with alcohol, which led to an 11-day hospital stay in New York in 2012 for pancreatitis; in 2014, his gall bladder and appendix were removed. Afterward, doctors gave him pills for his pain, which he later said were grossly overprescribed. With an unflinching honesty that his friends considered one of his finest traits, Avicii spoke in the film about his social anxiety, lifelong shyness and profound discomfort with fame. “He worked way too much and looked too thin,” Pontare said about that period. “I said to myself, ‘What happened with him?’” Though the fast-rising star was at the peak of his career then, playing before hundreds of thousands of fans at gigs commanding $250,000 a night, the pressure, and milieu, of the hard-partying world of electronic dance music encouraged his most destructive habits. “It’s very easy to become too attached to partying,” he told Rolling Stone of that period. “You become lonely and get anxieties. It becomes toxic.” Worse, Von Bahder said, “the more famous he got, the more amplified his social anxiety got.” By the end of 2016, Avicii made a bold choice. He quit his highly lucrative touring career to concentrate solely on his greatest love: making music in the studio. Friends and associates say he quickly began to heal. In his adopted home of Los Angeles, he hired a personal trainer, started to meditate and began a writing renaissance. “He was looking super good,” noted Pontare. “We said, ‘the fire is back in him.’” At the same time, the lyrics he was writing in this fertile period had a dark side. They referred repeatedly to “fading away,” being “low down” and “broken.” They also angrily dismissed “the party life” — ironically, the very scene for which Avicii created one of recent pop’s most rousing soundtracks. For the new single, “SOS,” he wrote lines that Aloe Blacc, the vocalist on “Wake Me Up,” sings with special urgency: “Can you hear me, S.O.S./help me put my mind to rest.” None of the people who heard those lyrics at the time found special meaning in them. To confuse matters, darkness had been an element in Avicii’s music from the opening song on his debut album, “True.” “Wake Me Up,” a No. 1 smash in nine countries and a Top 5 hit in America, finds its narrator experiencing the precise inverse of the redemptive refrain from “Amazing Grace” — believing he’s found, only to discover that he is, in fact, lost. “Tim always mixed the dark and the light,” said Per Sundin, an executive at Universal Music, Nordic, who signed a deal with Avicii when the musician was still recording under the name Tim Berg. Hearing the new lyrics now, however, “You go, ‘Oh, is this a metaphor?’ You can interpret the songs in different ways.”  AVICII’S EARLIEST SONGS invited little such interpretation. As a teenager, he began his career by making simple beats on his own. But he developed quickly as a songwriter and, by 2010, created the fully melodic pop/dance gem “Seek Bromance,” a Top 15 hit in Britain. Things really ignited, however, after he took what some felt was a Dylan-goes-electric-style risk at the key electronic music festival Ultra in 2013, where he debuted “Wake Me Up,” which injected elements of folk and country into E.D.M., aided by live musicians. “First, it was shock, then people started booing,” said Johnny Tennander, Avicii’s publisher at Sony/ATV. The young crowd was more taken aback when Avicii brought out a co-songwriter, Mac Davis, who had written hits for Elvis Presley. “On the internet, the comments were ‘rest in peace, Avicii’s career,’” Sundin of Universal Music said. Later, the company tried to recover, and seed interest, by issuing a prerelease SoundCloud mix of the album, one bold enough to also include a song like “Hey Brother,” sung by the bluegrass star Dan Tyminski, and another penned by the avant-gardist Antony Hegarty (now Anohni). At that point, “People said, ‘hold up, this is something new,’” Tennander recalled. “He’s writing music history.” “True” hit No. 5 on the Billboard 200; its 2015 follow-up, “Stories,” reached No. 17. “Tim,” which will be Avicii’s third album, advances his legacy of exploration by embracing psychedelia, Arabian music, sounds of the Caribbean and more. The lyrics, too, show significant growth. “The album felt coherent and personal,” said Tennander. While the new music presents many new angles, the executives overseeing it insisted that they eschew the more commercial route of recruiting superstar guest stars to, instead, use only longtime Avicii collaborators, including Kristoffer Fogelmark and Nedler, Salem Al Fakir and Pontare. Even the top name involved, Chris Martin of Coldplay — who sang a new song that leaked last year, “Heaven” — had sung and helped write a 2015 Avicii track, “True Believer.” The second mandate for the record was to keep as close to the demos the artist left as possible. One track planned for the album got pulled at the last minute because, Sundin said, “it had developed too far from Tim’s vision.” The producers say most songs were 75 to 80 percent done by the time of Avicii’s death. To fill in the rest, they relied on detailed notes he left on his phone and computer, some of which were written in his final days. It fell to Christopher Thordson, from the artist’s management team, to search all his devices for information. “He wrote very specific things about the music,” Thordson said. Conversations about what, if anything, they’d do with that information, and with the music, began among the executives mere days after the star’s death. They received an encouraging response from Avicii’s father, Klas Bergling, who controls the estate. “It should be released,” he said in our interview. “No question about it.”  BERGLING, 73, who ran a successful office supply business before retiring, and his wife, Anki Liden, a well-known actress in Sweden, live in the same apartment they moved to when their musical son was 7. (He stayed there with them, and his three siblings, until his late teens.) Dotting their tastefully designed home are pictures of their youngest son, mostly childhood scenes at the beach. In the kitchen there’s a handsome portrait of a serious-looking Avicii that was used at his memorial gathering; his mother has tempered the intensity of the photo by placing in front of it a snapshot of him smiling widely while playing music with Nile Rodgers. Standing in the kitchen, his mother indicated the shirt, pants and watch she was wearing. “Tim, Tim, Tim,” she said, pointing to each in succession. “They were his. He’s with me.” In the living room, Bergling sat under a giant painting of Stockholm created by his father, who had designed sets for the city’s opera, including one production directed by Ingmar Bergman. He spoke slowly and intently, staring down at the floor for long periods, meeting a reporter’s eye only when he finished speaking. He described his son as very shy growing up, a deep thinker who felt comfortable socially only with his closest friends. They spent countless hours in this apartment playing video games and watching the “The Lord of the Rings” film series and “Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me.” Music came to him later, as a midteen, after his blues-loving, guitar-playing father gave him a guitar of his own. “Tim advanced quickly from my quality,” Bergling said with a smile. His skill at computer games fed into a passion for creating sounds on music programs. After a few years of honing his style, he adopted the stage name Avicii, from a Buddhist term for a realm of hell. “It sounded tough,” Bergling said. “That’s super for a teenager.” As his son’s career progressed, and then exploded, Bergling noticed in Avicii an increasing stage fright, though he loved that his music was being received so resoundingly. Bergling feels the documentary portrait of his son as troubled captured much of the truth from that period, but he believes the timing of the film’s wider release, so close to Avicii’s death, left people unaware of the happier, final phase of his life, after he got off the road. Which leads to a difficult question: Why, 16 months into a brighter phase of his life, did Avicii end it? Bergling said flatly that he does not know. “There is no letter,” he said. He likened his son’s death to “an accident on the motor road” with “several cars.” “Nothing points in the direction that he was planning it.” He would not talk about the method of his son’s death. “It’s not even a year since it happened,” he said. “The family is very traumatized. We want peace.” To help achieve it, he and his wife take “Tim timeouts” from dwelling on their grief. “It sounds a bit military, but you have to be military to handle this,” he said. “We are very vulnerable.” He said it helps, as well, to speak the word “suicide,” something he could not do before. “I use the word as often as I remember to use it,” he said. “I have to get used to the word.” The next day, three of Avicii’s closest friends gathered to offer their own memories. They visited the middle school where they all met, pointing out where they used to sneak cigarettes and alcohol. They talked, too, about the computer games that obsessed them. “We were nerds,” Von Bahder said. “We went into music to interest girls. It didn’t work.” Strolling the neighborhood, the friends advanced to Ciao Ciao Grande, a favorite spot for pizzas over the years. Directly across the street from their table lies the musician’s final resting place. “He didn’t have far to go,” Von Bahder joked. It’s on the grounds of Hedvig Eleonora Church, where the name Tim Bergling appears on a plain plaque not much bigger than a playing card, one of 48 such demarcations on a grid hung on a wall. The star’s exact burial spot isn’t indicated, to stress modesty and to maintain privacy. “It’s very Tim,” Frederik Boberg, another friend, said. The friends didn’t linger long. In that same vein, they have chosen not to speculate much on the motivations behind his death. And while they’ve heard the new lyrics, they’re loath to look too closely at them for clues. Falk, on the other hand, remains haunted by them. “Now, when I listen, I hear a lonely person with a lot of big emotions that he didn’t have enough people to talk to about,” he said. “I feel this music was his way of getting some of that out. That makes this a really important record. Whatever Tim wanted to say is here.” "

JONATHAN BISS at Carnegie Hall (Jan. 24, 8 p.m.). Most pianists play a good amount of Beethoven, but few have taken on the composer with such relish as Biss, whose engagement has included developing a remarkably popular online course, recording the sonatas steadily over time and writing a book on the whole experience. Replacing Leif Ove Andsnes, who withdrew on short notice because of an elbow injury, Biss plays three sonatas: No. 6 in F, No. 18 in E flat and No. 29 in B flat, the titanic “Hammerklavier.”212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org CANTATA PROFANA at St. Peter’s Episcopal Church in Chelsea (Jan. 18-19, 8 p.m.). Alternating between the new and the old, on instruments modern and period in turn, this formidable ensemble presents “Visions of Silence.” Darting between the late 20th century and the early Baroque, they perform Alvin Lucier’s “Music for Piano With Amplified Sonorous Vessels,” Tarquinio Merula’s “Canzonetta spirituale sopra alla nanna,” Galina Ustvolskaya’s Symphony No. 5, Alessandro Piccinini’s “Toccata cromatica” and Salvatore Sciarrino’s “Infinito Nero” — a 20th-century setting for the words of a 17th-century mystic’s visions. Alice Teyssier is the soprano.917-699-8298, cantataprofana.com SEONG-JIN CHO at Carnegie Hall (Jan. 22, 8 p.m.). This uncommonly sensitive and effective pianist placed himself in a distinguished lineage when he triumphed in the Chopin Competition four years ago; among its previous winners are names like Martha Argerich, Maurizio Pollini and Krystian Zimerman. So perhaps it’s no surprise that tickets are limited for this recital, which includes Schubert’s “Wanderer” Fantasy, Mussorgsky’s “Pictures at an Exhibition” and selections from Debussy’s “Préludes” and “Images.” Try for a return regardless.212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org ‘IOLANTA’ AND ‘BLUEBEARD’S CASTLE’ at the Metropolitan Opera (Jan. 24, 8 p.m.; through Feb. 14). Marius Trelinski’s dark, fascinating juxtaposition of these one-act operas by Tchaikovsky and Bartok is one of the most bracing examples of directorial entrepreneurship to have reached the Met’s stage in recent years, and here it makes its first return since its debut in 2015. The cast is excellent: Sonya Yoncheva takes on the title role in “Iolanta,” with Matthew Polenzani as Vaudémont; in the Bartok, Gerald Finley is Bluebeard and Angela Denoke is Judith. Henrik Nanasi conducts.212-362-6000, metopera.org NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC at David Geffen Hall (Jan. 24, 7:30 p.m.; through Jan. 26). So much for Jaap Van Zweden’s supposed reticence regarding new music. Here the conductor gives the premiere of Julia Wolfe’s “Fire in My Mouth,” a reflection on the Triangle shirtwaist factory fire of 1911 and the death of 146 garment workers, most of them immigrants, in Manhattan. (An earlier politically engaged piece by Wolfe, “Anthracite Fields,” won the Pulitzer Prize in 2015.) The Philharmonic is joined by the Young People’s Chorus of New York City and the Crossing, an outstanding chamber choir. The projections and video are by Jeff Sugg, and the whole thing is directed by Anne Kauffman. Before that, Van Zweden leads the “Elegy” from Steven Stucky’s “August 4, 1964,” a piece he debuted with the Dallas Symphony, and Aaron Copland’s Clarinet Concerto. Anthony McGill is the soloist.212-875-5656, nyphil.org For an overview of January and February’s cultural events, click here. "
5c79030849f0eacbf105ad49,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/01/arts/music/american-composers-leon-botstein.html,"The composer Vivian Fine wrote acclaimed dance scores for Martha Graham and José Limón; brash, skillfully constructed orchestral pieces; and a raft of unusual chamber works. And if you’ve never heard of her, you’re not alone. Fine, who died in 2000, is among a sizable group of American composers from the middle of the 20th century who remain inexplicably overlooked today. Consider this: Though Fine taught for years at the Juilliard School and New York University, the New York Philharmonic has never performed her music. What explains this neglect? It might be collateral damage from a period when American composers squared off in opposing stylistic camps. On one side were those whose complex modernist languages involved various atonal and serial methods. On the other were self-described “postmodern” composers, who experimented with minimalism and found common ground with rock, jazz and ethnic music. As the polemics raged on, a large number of composers — including Fine, Walter Piston, Vincent Persichetti, Roy Harris, Harold Shapero and others — occupied a kind of neo-Classical middle ground. They continued using essentially tonal languages and tried to reinvigorate classical forms with fresh harmonic and rhythmic techniques. But they were perceived, especially by serialists based in universities who claimed the intellectual high ground, as dated and irrelevant. Many of these composers, though, brought well-honed skills, artistic integrity and a touch of American feistiness to their music. Conductors like Leonard Slatkin, Gerard Schwarz, Marin Alsop and others have tried to bring attention to them, to little avail. Last month Leon Botstein, who has tirelessly worked to bring to light worthy scores by neglected composers, led his American Symphony Orchestra at Carnegie Hall in the New York premiere of Fine’s Concertante for Piano and Orchestra (1944), with the accomplished pianist Charlie Albright as soloist, part of a program devoted to overlooked mid-20th-century American works. I knew some of Fine’s works, but not this bracing 17-minute piece in two movements. Though in her early years, Fine composed in a dissonance-saturated language of hard-edged contours and jagged counterpoint, she mellowed as she matured. This piece, an outlier, adopts a deliberately neo-Classical, almost neo-Baroque idiom and abounds in contrasts: Lacy, lyrical passages for piano often lead to stretches of tangled, industrious counterpoint; warm, rich string sonorities segue into flinty, brassy harmonies. The restless, spirited second movement is intoxicating. I especially love the moody first movement, especially a pensive, near-atonal episode about six minutes in. For more than 30 years, Piston was a respected music professor at Harvard. He literally wrote the book on harmony, a textbook still in use today. Yet his music came to be perceived, unfairly, as well made but a little, well, professorial. This great 25-minute viola concerto is just one of many Piston scores that should enter the repertory. During a meditative opening episode, the viola wanders lyrically atop clear-textured modal harmonies, until the music presses the opening melodic motif into service as a building block for the animated main section, rich with intricate interplay between soloist and orchestra. Amid brass fanfares, the finale takes off like some frenetic rondo, though metric dislocations and out-of-nowhere restrained passages keep you off guard. The slow middle movement is the most beguiling, a neo-Romantic Adagio with an intensely soulful viola theme cushioned by soft, wistful strings. This concerto could fill the slot on orchestra programs that typically goes to Mozart or Beethoven. Piston’s piece occupies a 1950s American version of the same neighborhood. In 1948, Aaron Copland wrote of his younger colleague  Shapero that “few musicians of our time put their pieces together with greater security,” adding that Shapero’s technical adroitness serves “a wonderfully spontaneous musical gift.” No work exemplifies this more than his 45-minute Symphony for Classical Orchestra. Leonard Bernstein conducted the premiere in 1948 with the Boston Symphony Orchestra. In 1953, he also led a recording, made on a single, hectic day while he was suffering from a fever. Though a little shaky, the recorded performance is exhilarating. Beethoven’s Seventh, slyly quoted at one point, was a model for Shapero’s piece, which opens with an elusive Adagio, all flickering chords and sustained sonorities, that shifts into a bustling, densely contrapuntal Allegro. A tenderly lyrical yet quizzical slow movement leads to a misbehaving scherzo, and then a herculean finale. André Previn had a triumph with the piece at the Los Angeles Philharmonic in the late 1980s and later recorded it. Though Mr. Botstein led a performance in 2016, this demanding piece mostly languishes today. American orchestras planning yet another run-through of Beethoven’s Seventh might instead take a crack as Shapero’s masterpiece. Dello Joio, born in New York, probably thought the future of this piece was assured when it was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Music in 1957. Alas, it’s all but disappeared. I last heard it performed by the Boston University Symphony Orchestra in the late 1970s. The string writing somehow remains shimmering and transparent even when sonorities turn thick and textures gnarly. The interplay between darkly contemplative music, as in the piercing “To everything there is a season” opening movement, and quixotic episodes, like the spirited “…and a time to dance and to laugh…,” is so deftly handled you hang on every shift. Of late, there has been a welcome renewal of interest in the Boston-born Irving Fine (no relation to Vivian). A splendid 2015 recording by the Boston Modern Orchestra Project drew fresh attention to his works. The album opens with his first completed orchestra score, the ebullient and impish Toccata Concertante (1947), a piece that could become a surefire concert opener for orchestras. His later, skittish, tartly modernist scores skillfully combine neo-Classical structures with a vigorous but free use of 12-tone techniques, as in the final movement of his 1962 Symphony, generally considered Fine’s major statement. He led a performance of the symphony at Tanglewood in 1962 just days before his death at 47. Yes, I know: Barber is hardly neglected. His Adagio for Strings is world-famous. But why is his darkly neo-Romantic and teeming Piano Concerto almost never performed these days? At its 1962 premiere by the Boston Symphony, with John Browning as soloist, which helped inaugurate what was then called Philharmonic Hall at Lincoln Center, the piece “made a decided hit with the audience,” Harold C. Schonberg of The New York Times reported, adding that it may be that Barber “has supplied a repertory piece.” Listen, and you’ll hear why. It ends with a demonic finale, full of pummeling chords and frenetic energy. Though Thomson completed this piece in 1928, it did not have its official premiere until 1945, when he conducted it with the New York Philharmonic. The piece can seem a dizzying assemblage built from distinctive musical chunks: evocations of old-time hymn-singing; a kind of spare, modal melodic writing that Thomson called his “Missouri plainchant” style; fractured fanfares and down-home-marches; faux-serious bursts of counterpoint. The musical language can be unabashedly brash and dissonant one moment, defiantly diatonic the next. Yet in a good performance it comes across as an inspired, if iconoclastic, entity, and somehow exuberantly “American” — whatever that means. No surprise: Mr. Botstein led the last performance I know of in New York, which was recorded live. May he keep up the fight for neglected 20th-century Americans. "

SUSANA BACA at Sony Hall (Feb. 12, 8 p.m.). This 74-year-old Peruvian singer-songwriter started her career as an ethnomusicologist, specifically focusing on Afro-Peruvian culture. But when David Byrne featured her recording “Maria Lando” on his 1995 compilation “Soul of Black Peru,” she was thrust upon the international stage. Since, she has recorded six albums for his Luaka Bop label and won two Latin Grammys. Baca’s repertoire includes both traditional Peruvian songs and her own originals, but the sound is consistent thanks to her ensemble’s elegant acoustic instrumentation and her superlative, powerful voice. 212-997-5123, sonyhall.com ANITA BAKER at Radio City Music Hall (Feb. 13-14, 8 p.m.). At 61, this R&B legend concluded what was billed as her farewell tour in 2018 with a star-studded finale in September that included appearances by Stevie Wonder, Lalah Hathaway and Kelly Rowland. Thankfully for fans, she’s back with this two-night run at Radio City. The “Giving You the Best That I Got” singer’s roster of hits may have helped define the quiet storm era, which started in the 1970s, but at recent live shows, she has sounded as vital and captivating as ever. 212-465-6000, radiocity.com TALIB KWELI at the BRIC House Ballroom (Feb. 14, 8 p.m.). A Brooklyn native, this rapper gives an interesting spin to Valentine’s Day concerts: His is a love letter to his home borough. Brooklyn — specifically Park Slope, where Kweli grew up, and Fort Greene, where this concert will take place — has changed dramatically since he first rose to prominence in the late 1990s as half of Black Star, which he formed with the M.C. Yasiin Bey (then known as Mos Def), a fellow Brooklynite. Kweli’s message, though, has remained the same: He’s still using his technical mastery to push for social and political reform in Brooklyn and beyond. 718-683-5600, bricartsmedia.org [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] LIFE AND DEATH X SÓNAR at the Avant Gardner (Feb. 8, 10 p.m.). The influential electronic music label Life and Death is partnering with the Spanish festival Sónar to curate a night of D.J.s from around the world at this multiroom Brooklyn club. The lineup includes Life and Death’s co-founder, D.J. Tennis (a.k.a. Manfredi Romano), who specializes in techno; the Los Angeles-based producer Daedelus, who makes experimental electronic music; the London-based house D.J. Call Super; and the Israeli D.J. Mor Elian, whose recent work skews toward electro and ambient music. 347-987-3146, avant-gardner.com SARAH SHOOK & THE DISARMERS at the Knitting Factory (Feb. 14, 8 p.m.). With a rare combination of deft, classic country sounds and plain-spoken storytelling, Shook bucks both Nashville’s mainstream and the overly self-aware Americana scene. The twist comes from Shook’s unconventionally compelling voice, which is low, steady and a little nasal, recalling Appalachian yodeling but with a grungy edge. Plentiful slide guitar and a reliance on barn-dance-ready shuffle rhythms ground the songs in tradition, and the execution is sharp enough that the band’s old-school approach is convincing, a believable transformation of country’s vintage melancholy. 347-529-6696, knittingfactory.com SHARON VAN ETTEN at the Beacon Theater (Feb. 9, 8 p.m.). Van Etten’s new album, “Remind Me Tomorrow,” is receiving rave reviews, thanks in part to the New Jersey-bred singer-songwriter’s fairly dramatic stylistic shift. On her most recent releases, her confessional, poetic songs are bolstered by a slew of different electronic effects and synths instead of basic rock instrumentation. “I found that I was more drawn to the darkness and the driven synths and the syncopated beats,” she told The New York Times last month. The elaborate production, though, does little to obscure her music’s potent vulnerability.212-465-6000, beacontheatre.comNATALIE WEINER CLAUDIA ACUÑA at the Birdland Theater (through Feb. 9, 7 and 9:45 p.m.). Last week Acuña released “Turning Pages,” her first album in a decade and her first to consist of mostly original tunes. It finds the Chilean-born vocalist luxuriating in the breadth of her powers, whether covering Abbey Lincoln or unveiling her own compositions; she’s equal parts taut rhythm, flowing largess (think Cassandra Wilson in the 1990s) and sky-seeking mountain folk. Acuña performs songs from that album here with her band, featuring Juancho Herrera on guitar, Pablo Vergara on keyboard, Carlos Henderson on bass and Yayo Serka on drums.212-581-3080, birdlandjazz.com ITAMAR BOROCHOV at Nublu 151 (Feb. 13, 9 p.m.). An Israeli-born trumpeter, Borochov plays contemporary jazz that’s easy to enjoy. His melodies are direct and often plangent, his harmonies and rhythms sturdy and repetitious. His latest album, “Blue Nights,” draws together influences from the Middle East and North Africa with jazz-academy thinking. He performs here, using his signature quarter-tone trumpet (a custom instrument that allows him to play more fluidly in Middle Eastern modes), with Rob Clearfield on keyboard, Sam Weber on bass and Jay Sawyer on drums. The North African folk band Innov Gnawa, which was featured on one track on “Blue Nights,” will appear as special guests.nublu.net DEE DEE BRIDGEWATER at 92nd Street Y (Feb. 14, 7:30 p.m.). A recently minted National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master, Bridgewater is one of jazz’s most beloved straight-ahead veterans of the 1970s and ’80s, with a style that’s rooted in theater; she carries forth the storytelling legacies of Dinah Washington and Nancy Wilson. Her most recent album, “Memphis,” is a homage to the soul music of the city where she was born, but at this Valentine’s Day concert — joined by her typical backing trio of the pianist Carmen Staaf, the bassist Tabari Lake and the drummer Tyson Jackson — expect a more standard serving of romantic jazz fare.212-415-5500, 92y.org RUDRESH MAHANTHAPPA’S INDO-PAK COALITION at the Miller Theater (Feb. 9, 8 p.m.). Mahanthappa, an alto saxophonist, has been working with his Indo-Pak Coalition for long enough now that the group is starting to subtly outgrow the initial mission statement. They are no longer simply jazz improvisers combining musical traditions from across the Indian subcontinent. The trio — which also includes the guitarist Rez Abbasi and the drummer and tabla player Dan Weiss — has the restless, unboxable rapport of musicians broadly exploring musical sounds and strategies, with Indian classical as its launchpad.212-854-7799, millertheatre.com THUNDERCAT at the Blue Note (Feb. 12-14, 8 and 10:30 p.m.; through Feb. 17). Thundercat, a six-string-electric-bass wunderkind and merry prankster, might be the most hopelessly enjoyable artist currently making music in jazz’s crossover territory. He will do a six-night run in the coming week, welcoming a range of unannounced special guests throughout. Expect wry, hilarious non sequiturs muttered in between songs — like “Them Changes” and “Show You the Way” — that will be full of elastic funk grooves and blistering bass solos. Thundercat, whose birth name is Stephen Bruner, has been improving his vocal chops recently; his singing still has an unpretentious, conversational allure, but now there’s more body and breath behind it.212-475-8592, bluenote.net WING WALKER ORCHESTRA AND BRIAN KROCK’S LIDDLE at Threes Brewing Gowanus (Feb. 12, 8 p.m.). Led by the young multi-reedist Drew Williams, the Wing Walker Orchestra is about to release a remarkable debut album, “Hazel.” The music stays tightly woven, even as Williams switches up the grooves and harmonic palettes constantly; there’s almost always a sharp, biting cadence coming from some part of the band (though not necessarily the rhythm section). The group shares this bill with Liddle, a combo fronted by the alto saxophonist Brian Krock, playing music that draws in equal measure from Charlie Parker, Anthony Braxton and Battles — putting checkered rock rhythms underneath pelting, hard-edge melodies. 718-522-2110, threesbrewing.comGIOVANNI RUSSONELLO "
5c8938b049f0eacbf105cddb,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/13/arts/music/review-beatrice-rana-piano-carnegie-hall.html,"Chopin’s études for piano — 24 works, in two volumes — are study pieces written to develop specific aspects of technique. If you can play them comfortably, you can probably play anything written for the piano. He tried to make these études imaginative, as well, and the best performances convey their musical riches. In that regard, Beatrice Rana set a new standard for me in her New York recital debut on Tuesday at Zankel Hall. Playing the 12 études of Book Two (Op. 25), she didn’t just surmount the technical challenges; she made the pieces sound as poetic and colorful as anything Chopin ever wrote. Though Ms. Rana is just 26, this debut was still overdue. She has appeared for years at major halls and with leading orchestras in Europe, and has made acclaimed recordings on the Warner Classics label. In June, she will appear in Carnegie’s main hall as the soloist with the Philadelphia Orchestra in Prokofiev’s Third Piano Concerto, one of her signature works. From the opening moments of the first étude, in A flat, Ms. Rana had the audience rapt. The piece explores rippling arpeggio chords in both hands, through which a soft-spoken melodic line is heard, traced by the top note in the right hand. Ms. Rana made these awkward figurations come across delicately; the melodic line had the grace of the bel canto opera arias Chopin adored. Ms. Rana boldly used rubato, the stretching of the line to lend it breadth and expressivity. This can easily be overdone and result in affected, distorted music-making. I tend to prefer Chopin played with a little less rubato than Ms. Rana opted for. But her phrasing was so sensitive to the shape of the line and shifts of harmony that she won me over, as she did with her use of the sustaining pedal to create milky textures. Her playing was refined and soft-spoken in its brilliance throughout. But in the Étude in A minor (“Winter Wind”), Ms. Rana showed her demonic side. As a stern theme is played in the left hand, the right hand has descending and ascending cascades of tangled passagework. Ms. Rana’s fearless playing was an exhilarating rush of speed and color. After intermission she turned to Ravel’s piercingly poetic and very difficult “Miroirs” suite, playing with lushness one moment and striking crispness and clarity the next. She ended with Guido Agosti’s 1928 arrangement of the final three sections from Stravinsky’s “The Firebird.” The Infernal Dance sounded nearly unplayable. But Ms. Rana proved that it could indeed be conquered. "

5c8181bc49f0eacbf105bec0,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/07/arts/music/migrations-the-making-of-america-immigration.html,"What do migrants bring with them? On a one-way trip to an unknown new life, perhaps they might pack money, documents, clothes, some small keepsakes. Invisibly and intangibly, they also carry cultural memories: the lullabies their parents sang, the dances they tried at a wedding, the best way to cook a chicken. On new territory, those memories become a link to home and also, with any luck, something to share with the neighbors. It’s the American story, repeated with countless variations for each new arrival; it’s also a hot-button subject in politics worldwide. And it’s the theme for “Migrations: The Making of America,” a citywide festival that gets into gear this weekend, with Carnegie Hall at its center along with more than 75 partner organizations around the city, including the New-York Historical Society, the Irish Arts Center, Harlem Stage, the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research, El Museo del Barrio and the Vietnam Heritage Center. The festival encompasses dance workshops, panel discussions, and walking tours of Harlem along with concerts large and small. “So many different cultures and so many different ethnicities want to tell their story,” said Clive Gillinson, the executive and artistic director of Carnegie Hall. “It tells you something about the potency of the subject.” Carnegie’s own programs focus on three historical migrations to and within the United States: the Irish and Scottish influx in the 18th and 19th centuries; Jews arriving from Russia and Eastern Europe from the late 19th century until the 1924 National Origins Act set quotas on immigration; and the Great Migration of 6 million African-Americans from the South to northern industrial cities. British Isles immigrants brought a repertoire that seeded Appalachian and country music. The Jewish contingent brought essential songwriters to Tin Pan Alley and Broadway. And the Great Migration disseminated blues, jazz, gospel and the other glories of African-American music. When you consider that “some of the most sublime inspirational art you could ever imagine” came out of appalling situations, Mr. Gillinson said, “I think it tells you a lot about what human beings are able to do in transmuting some of the most painful and hardest things in life into something that can actually uplift everyone.” The far-reaching jazz pianist Jason Moran and the opera-trained mezzo-soprano Alicia Hall Moran, his wife, along with guests from jazz, rock, gospel and classical music, address the Great Migration in a Carnegie Hall concert on March 30 titled “Two Wings.” Its foundation, the Morans said in a phone interview, is the book “The Warmth of Other Suns” by Isabel Wilkerson, who will appear. Songs on the program like the spiritual “Two Wings” and the blues “Route 66,” buoyant as they seem, are nonetheless about escape. “The root is sheer terror,” Jason Moran said. “It’s people having to retreat, people having to hide, people having to gather what few belongings they have and do some real improvisation and go to some other city — only to get to that city and discover some other trials later on.” Jewish heritage and its American evolution will have a flagship concert on April 15. “From Shtetl to Stage: A Celebration of Yiddish Music and Culture,” produced by the author Seth Rogovoy, gathers classical musicians (the violinist Gil Shaham and the pianist Evgeny Kissin), klezmer musicians (the clarinetist David Krakauer and the trumpeter Frank London, the show’s musical director), singers and actors to explore the Yiddish theater and its extensive influence. At Zankel Hall, the klezmer clarinetist and mandolinist Andy Statman will lead his trio on March 14, and Michael Feinstein will perform “The Great American Jewish Songbook: Kern, Berlin, Arlen, Rodgers and More” on March 27. The Scots-Irish facet of the festival begins March 9 with a dedicated segment of “Live From Here,” the American Public Media radio show hosted by the eclectic mandolinist and songwriter Chris Thile. “I was a bizarre choice to host this one, seeing as I’m a Southern California boy with no detectable Scotch-Irish heritage to speak of,” Mr. Thile said by phone. (Most of his ancestry is German.) “But in another way, it makes a lot of sense, because it’s about how much influence those migrations have had on American culture and American life.” He added, “Music and the artistic benefits of an ethnically diverse society are undeniable. This country would be nothing without all of the various peoples who are here. What would we have, musically speaking, had we just kept this place all to our initial selves? To say nothing of the fact that it wasn’t ours to begin with.” On April 6 at Zankel, the festival will present the Gloaming, a quintet of Irish and American musicians who merge deeply traditional Irish fiddling and singing with daring, often luminously introspective harmonies and arrangements. To Martin Hayes, a fiddler from County Clare who founded the group, the Gloaming continues a century-long dialogue between Irish music and its American diaspora, restoring some of the subtleties that were discouraged by the limitations of early recordings and the guitar-strumming enthusiasm of the 1960s folk revival. “There is a thread of unacknowledged, deeper emotional expression that got ironed out of the music in some ways,” Mr. Hayes said. In the Gloaming’s music, “Lots of things can happen, but the only rule is that they actually amplify and develop the innate feeling that happens inside the melodic structure.” Meanwhile, the melting pot continues to simmer. The Migrations festival has embraced a series now in its fifth year at the Flushing Town Hall arts center: Global Mashups, which presents double bills of musicians from disparate traditions for an audience that comes to dance. Dance steps are taught before the performance, and after each group plays its own set, they jam together — an accelerated version of American music’s cross-pollination. “By the end of the night, you’re not a stranger any more,” said Ellen Kodadek, the executive and artistic director of Flushing Town Hall. This year’s lineup begins March 9 with the category-defying Hazmat Modine — a blues-rooted group that can swerve into New Orleans brass-band jazz, ska or klezmer — and Falu, a singer born in Mumbai who will be performing music from vintage Bollywood films and from Holi, a Hindu spring festival of renewal and forgiveness. Falu represents the 11th generation of a family of Hindustani classical musicians; she immigrated to the United States 20 years ago, and studied Western songwriting at Berklee College of Music. Her Indian-rooted children’s album, “Falu’s Bazaar,” was a nominee at the most recent Grammy Awards. “My purpose in making ‘Falu’s Bazaar’ was to keep the tradition living,” she said. “To give everybody who has immigrated, who has a different culture to latch onto, who has some story to tell, to give validation that your song matters, your story matters.” She has no qualms about the cross-cultural jam with Hazmat Modine. “Music is the most unifying power,” she said. “We’re going to bring people together.” "
5c4726b73a125f5075c05a89,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/22/movies/the-5-browns-digging-through-the-darkness-review.html,"In this documentary about siblings in a classical music ensemble, one of the girls, then in her early teens, describes herself as “optimistic and happy.” The all-Americanness of the three sisters and two brothers who came to be known as the 5 Browns manifested itself in a variety of ways. Born in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and raised in Utah, they were avatars of well-scrubbed cheer and hard work. Home-schooled, each one practiced piano at all hours. Their professional performances were both novel and impractical, playing five-piano arrangements of canonical classical music. Doing the sort of thing you don’t expect to see done at all, let alone done well, is also, arguably, very all-American. “The 5 Browns,” directed by Ben Niles and expanding on a short he made two years ago, is subtitled “Digging Through The Darkness.” The Brown sisters — Desirae, Deondra and Melody — were sexually abused by their father, Keith, from girlhood into their teens. The idea of the siblings performing together as a unit really came about only after a 2000 New York Times article about how all the children were attending Juilliard simultaneously. After the act got underway, Keith Brown became the business manager and put his children on a punishing schedule, keeping up the abuse for much of the time. Once the sisters revealed what was going on to one another, and to their brothers, Gregory and Ryan, there had to be a reckoning. And so there was, one that led to further trouble, and one inarguably just resolution: Keith Brown is serving a prison sentence. This story is in a sense confounding. I can’t imagine the bitterness of having to deal with one’s vocation and artistic calling being inextricably linked to a monstrous, criminal upbringing. And yet the movie is framed by scenes of the now adult Browns making a new record. For as much as they suffered, music was able to keep them sane, and united. The director and his editor, Amanda Larson, construct the movie in a fairly conventional way, but leave a single string dangling, which they pull tight to devastating emotional effect near the end. The five Browns are likable, admirable individuals; two of the sisters started the Foundation for Surviving Abuse, an advocacy group, and we see them at work with eloquence and compassion. Their trauma and their subsequent resolve, as depicted here, are also, finally, all-American. "
5c2f3cbc3a125f5075c02d2b,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/arts/music/matt-marks-little-death-prototype-festival.html,"In May, the musician Matt Marks died suddenly, of heart failure, after a performance with the ensemble Alarm Will Sound. It was a blow to the tight-knit world of contemporary music, in which the 38-year-old Mr. Marks was a prominent presence as a composer, vocalist and French horn player. Along with his prolific compositional output, he helped found Alarm Will Sound, as well as the New Music Gathering conference, and was a provocatively humorous mainstay on social media. [Read the New York Times obituary for Mr. Marks.] This community rallied to memorialize him. Alarm Will Sound started the Matt Marks Impact Fund to develop new works. Several of his close friends completed his score for a theatrical piece, “Words on the Street,” which had its debut in October. And on Tuesday at Roulette in Brooklyn, the Prototype: Opera/Theater/Now festival — which presented Mr. Marks’s opera “Mata Hari” in 2017 and runs from Jan. 5 through 13 this year — will revive his breakthrough 2010 work “The Little Death: Vol. 1.” Mr. Marks’s fiancée, the composer Mary Kouyoumdjian, has become the de facto steward of his musical legacy. “I don’t want him or his music to be forgotten,” she said in a recent interview. They had been close artistic collaborators, sharing drafts and producing each other’s recording sessions. “He was such a strong advocate for my own music and getting it out there,” she added, “that this is the smallest way for me to return the favor.” Much of Mr. Marks’s music draws together a permissive polystylism with a comedic irreverence toward the ritual trappings of classical music. In a 2016 recording he posted on SoundCloud, he dramatically — and hilariously — recited the pianist Khatia Buniatishvili’s hagiographic website biography atop the majestic theme from “Jurassic Park.” But his death has also brought into stark relief the intense intimacy that is the basis of several of his works, which were conceived during — and are partly about — personal relationships, and which now have a new emotional rawness. This is particularly apparent in the upcoming production of “The Little Death,” which Mr. Marks originally created in close collaboration with the soprano Mellissa Hughes while they were dating, and which has not been performed since they broke up in 2012. “I viscerally got sick,” Ms. Hughes recalled in an interview about being asked to revive the work at Prototype. “I couldn’t think about doing it, and it just felt wrong.” In 2006, as young New York-based classical music freelance artists, Mr. Marks and Ms. Hughes met on a bizarre gig: a PBS crossover special being filmed in Miami, in which their live performance was replaced by canned audio. They reconnected on Myspace, where Mr. Marks had posted some simple songs he had written. As they began dating, Mr. Marks’s compositions became more serious, and he increasingly wrote specifically for Ms. Hughes’s voice, culminating in “The Little Death.” Starring Mr. Marks and Ms. Hughes and billed as a “post-Christian nihilist pop opera,” it presented a love story of religious and sexual awakenings reinforced by Mr. Marks’s intricately wrought, omnivorous score: One exuberant duet combines electropop and the shape-note hymn “Wondrous Love.” A series of grandiosely cheeky performances in various spaces in New York, and a recording released on New Amsterdam Records in 2010, were heralded for embodying an emergent genre-crossing scene widely known as “indie classical” or “alt-classical.” Mr. Marks and Ms. Hughes worked on Vol. 2, but the project ended with their relationship. “I haven’t even sung through any of it or even really hummed through it since 2012,” Ms. Hughes said. “When you create something like that with somebody, it becomes a part of you, and so when you’re no longer with that person, it’s hard to revisit.” Electronic samples on the album, and passages in Mr. Marks’s libretto, memorialize inside jokes and moments in their real-life romance. “When I hear these things, it’s hard to remember,” Ms. Hughes said. “It’s like an audio graveyard.” “But it’s also beautiful,” she added. “It was a time in both of our lives that we were so creative, and we were young and poor and nobody knew us, and so we didn’t care. We wrote what we wrote.” That sincerity was a through line in Mr. Marks’s music, and motivated his exhaustive engagement with musical genres that might be looked down on by other composers. “One of the things that I respect about Christian music and Christian pop music is that they’re willing to get sentimental,” he told The Brooklyn Rail in 2010. “I think you can actually mess with people’s heads way more by going the sentimental route, playing with their heartstrings.” Since his death, moments on the “Little Death” album that might have once sounded arch — hokey chord progressions, campy melodic hooks — can unexpectedly arouse tears. And at the core of Mr. Marks’s compositional voice was his actual voice: a shape-shifting but always identifiable timbre that traversed a range as broad as his musical influences, whether the guttural bellows of his bonkers cover of the novelty song “Donde Esta Santa Claus,” or the sickly sweet falsetto deployed to embody a Karen Carpenter-obsessed, disaffected teenager in “A Song for Wade (This is not that song).” With his death, that irreplaceable component of much of his music is gone. “So many of the pieces that he wrote for himself to sing, it would not work without him,” said the composer Ted Hearne. Mr. Hearne sang in a “praise choir” assembled to accompany an early run of “The Little Death,” and will take on Mr. Marks’s part for the Prototype revival. Since the piece lacks a fully notated score, Mr. Hearne is learning the music primarily by listening closely to the album. “I have to be able to perform it with as much confidence and moxie and guts as he would,” he said. He helped persuade Ms. Hughes to sing, telling her, she recalled, “If you don’t do it, the piece dies with Matt.” “The Little Death” was Ms. Kouyoumdjian’s first introduction to Mr. Marks’s music. She was so captivated by a 2010 performance that, as she was leaving the concert, she walked into a glass door and broke her nose. She and Mr. Marks met a couple years later to discuss a potential collaboration with her ensemble, Hotel Elefant, and began dating. (That project was recorded before Mr. Marks’s death, and will be part of a future release of his music on New Amsterdam.) Mr. Marks was a longtime resident of Brooklyn, and he and Ms. Kouyoumdjian would often visit unfamiliar parts of the borough. One such excursion involved a bus trip — during which they shared a pair of headphones to listen to Mariah Carey — to the serene Salt Marsh Nature Center in Marine Park. Not long afterward, Mr. Marks began a new project, the pop monodrama “Headphone Splitter,” which takes a lightly fictionalized account of their date as its point of departure: The characters Matt and Baby cozily split headphones on the B41 to go bird-watching on a lazy Saturday, and witness a brutal ax murder. “Having this sixth sense of twisting everything sweet into something really dark, he thought, ‘Oh, this would be the perfect beginning for this murder mystery,’” Ms. Kouyoumdjian said. With the director Nick Leavens, “Headphone Splitter” was to be developed into a series of music videos driven by Mr. Marks’s singing, although he only recorded the first three episodes. In Chapter 1, atop swirlingly catchy electronics, Mr. Marks narrates the bus adventure with his characteristically zany swagger — “Baby, go on, pull out your headphone splitter. Sit close, we’ll listen to the soundtrack of ‘Glitter’” — followed by the sudden homicide. “It has so many elements of things Matt that loved so much,” Ms. Kouyoumdjian said: Brooklyn, low-budget horror films, macabre humor. “The music that he was writing more recently goes back to the music he was writing for ‘The Little Death,’” Ms. Kouyoumdjian added. “Projects like ‘Headphone Splitter’ that really celebrated him as a composer-performer, and were projects that he could do on his own. He could write his own text, which was something he loved; he could direct the idea and the vision of the project; and he could just sit at his computer and write and produce.” She is planning to release the two other episodes Mr. Marks completed, and may finish some of the rest of the series herself, although a crowdfunding campaign to support the project did not meet its goal. While Ms. Kouyoumdjian has been active as a composer — she has collaborated with the Kronos Quartet and is preparing a commission for the vocal ensemble Roomful of Teeth — she has lately focused more on tending Mr. Marks’s body of work. “It’s a lot easier for me to put energy toward his projects happening, at this point, than for my own,” she said. “Composition is really tricky. It really requires a lot of emotional vulnerability, and I think that that’s a space that’s difficult to be in for long periods of time after you lose somebody.” “Helping Matt’s music be a little more public,” she added, “is my way of still doing creative work, but in a way that feels right to me, right now.” "

And they’ll be right. Music today, at least most of it, is fundamentally different from what it was in the days of yore — the 1970s and 80s.  Last year, the industry celebrated a sales milestone. The Recording Industry Association of America certified that the Eagles’ “Their Greatest Hits (1971-1975),” was the best-selling album of all time, with sales of 38 million. (The formula took account of vinyl, CD and streaming purchases. Purists will have to put aside the fact that a greatest hits collection is not really an LP album as most of us know it.) It was a full-circle moment — the album, released almost exactly 43 years ago, was the first to be awarded platinum status (sales of one million), an evocative reminder that songs were once commodities so valuable that millions of people would even buy them in repackaged form. It was also a taken as a quiet victory for people who believe that music today is too loud. By “too loud,” I don’t mean you can’t crank the Eagles, if that’s your thing. I’m talking about loudness as a measure of sound within a particular recording. Our ears perceive loudness in an environment by reflexively noting the dynamic range — the difference between the softest and loudest sounds (in this case, the environment is the recording itself, not the room you are playing it in). A blaring television commercial may make us turn down the volume of our sets, but its sonic peaks are no higher than the regular programming preceding it. The commercial just hits those peaks more often. A radio station playing classical music may be broadcasting a signal with the same maximum strength as one playing hip-hop, but the classical station broadcast will hit that peak perhaps once every few minutes, while the hip-hop station’s signal may peak several times per second. A loud environment in this sense is one with a limited dynamic range — highs that peak very high, and lows that aren’t much lower. For decades, musicians and engineers have employed dynamic range compression to make recordings sound fuller. Compression boosts the quieter parts and tamps down louder ones to create a narrower range. Historically, compression was usually applied during the mastering stage, the final steps through which a finished recording becomes a commercial release. In the predigital era, compression required a mastering engineer whose job is to create the physical master for the manufacturing process, to employ restraint and finesse. With digital audio, a few mouse clicks can compress the dynamic range with brute force. The result is music that sounds more aurally aggressive — like the television commercial. During the 1990s, as digital technology infiltrated the recording process, some mastering engineers wielded compression like a cudgel, competing to produce the loudest recordings. This recording industry “loudness war” was driven by linked aesthetic and economic imperatives. A louder record grabs your attention — and will often be perceived, at least at first, to have better sound quality than a less compressed album — and musicians didn’t want their product to sound weak by comparison. Maximum loudness, it was thought, was a prerequisite for commercial success. The war became so heated that by the latter part of the decade some mastering engineers took it a step further. They not only compressed dynamic range to within an inch of its life, they also made the loudest parts exceed the maximum possible peak. At these moments, the sound wave “clips,” becoming dense and distorted. As with compression, clipping can be done artistically — it may even aid and abet a certain dissonance that fits the music. But in the ’90s, it became yet another weapon in the loudness arms race, which was not one of artistic quality, but of profit. By the end of the decade, mastering engineers who had abstained from the war were losing clients. Recording engineers and producers often discovered their carefully rendered recordings were being squashed in the mastering stage. Over time, with listeners increasingly consuming music through earbuds and cheap computer speakers, engineers and producers found themselves working in a denuded sonic landscape, many of them longing for the rich and diverse audio ecosystems of old. While some extra-loud recordings seemed to benefit from this compression gamble (Dr. Dre’s 1992 “The Chronic” and Oasis’ 1995 “(What’s the Story) Morning Glory?” are oft-cited examples of loudness abetting a commercial powerhouse), there were other releases that were so obviously overloaded — like Red Hot Chili Peppers’ “Californication” (1999), Rush’s “Vapor Trails” (2002) and Metallica’s “Death Magnetic” (2008) — that the bands’ fans complained in droves. There was a potential downside to all this loudness. Many audio pros maintain that excessive loudness creates aural fatigue. We may not consciously notice it, they argue, but it makes us less likely to listen to music for extended periods. Although this is a difficult claim to prove, it is undeniable that decreased dynamic range has limited the sonic palette of recordings. When compact discs were introduced in the 1980s, one selling point was that they were capable of a greater dynamic range than vinyl records — yet the average pop recording today has a smaller dynamic range than records made during the analog era. Several years ago, Chris Johnson, an audio software developer, tested a theory, espoused by some anti-loudness activists, that the hyper-compression roiling the industry was partly to blame for shortened careers. Using a list of all-time best-selling recordings, he rearranged them by “commercial importance,” assigning each a score derived by multiplying an album’s number of platinum certifications (how many millions sold) by the number of years it had been on the market. These were records that were not merely popular — they also displayed longevity. He then used software to analyze the sound waves of each album. His findings revealed they had a common trait: these albums, even across genres, had extraordinary dynamic range. The most commercially important albums, he wrote, featured lots of “high contrast” moments, when “the transient attacks of instruments” — very brief outbursts of high energy — were allowed to stand out against “the background space where the instruments are placed.” This was especially true for vocals and percussion (one of the more intriguing similarities, from Michael Jackson’s “Thriller” to Pink Floyd’s “The Wall,” involved what Mr. Johnson called the “hit record drum sound”). Loudness has its place, but most of us like our music to have breathing room, so that our eardrums are constantly tickled by little sonic explosions. In a tight, compressed space, music can get asphyxiated. Topping Mr. Johnson’s commercially important list, just ahead of Led Zeppelin’s untitled fourth album, was the Eagles’ “Their Greatest Hits (1971-1975).” “It’s gratifying, but unsurprising,” Mr. Johnson wrote, “to discover that the single most commercially important album in R.I.A.A. history contains some of the most striking dynamic contrasts pop music’s ever seen.” The war never really ended, but it has evolved. Streaming services like Spotify now “normalize” the music’s output, so that we aren’t always adjusting our volume settings. This should lessen the incentive for mastering engineers to abuse compression. But according to Bob Ludwig, one of the industry’s pre-eminent mastering engineers (and a winner of Grammys for Best Engineered Album for artists like Alabama Shakes, Beck and Daft Punk), this hasn’t stopped mixing engineers from ladling on the loudness, reducing the dynamic range of the music even as the streaming normalization defeats their purpose. “The loudness war is worse than ever,” he recently told me. “It is a super-discouraging situation.” If we consider the Grammy nominees in this year’s Best Record category as a representative cross section of today’s music, it is clear (as the sampling below shows) that aggressive compression is still the norm. But as in every era of music, there are exceptions. “Shallow” by Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper displays a wider dynamic range than its competitors, a throwback — not just in theme, but also production value.  Every now and then, it seems, they do make music like they used to.  Greg Milner is the author of “Perfecting Sound Forever: An Aural History of Recorded Music” and “Pinpoint: How GPS is Changing Technology, Culture, and Our Minds.” "

ANI CORDERO at the David Rubenstein Atrium at Lincoln Center (Jan. 31, 7:30 p.m.). The New York-based singer and instrumentalist uses music to tap into her Puerto Rican heritage, performing traditional music from the island, as well as from around Latin America (she’s worked with the Brazilian ensemble Os Mutantes, among others). Specifically, on her debut solo release in 2014, “Recordar,” Cordero paid tribute to Latin American music’s history of protest songs, offering her rendition of compositions by artists like Mexico’s Chavela Vargas and Chile’s Violeta Parra. This concert is free, and the Puerto Rican pop singer JOATA will open. 212-721-6500, lincolncenter.org RYAN HURD at Bowery Ballroom (Jan. 25, 8 p.m.). Like many artists working to break through in Nashville, Hurd has an impressive roster of songs that he’s co-written for country stars: Darius Rucker, Dierks Bentley, Florida Georgia Line and Tim McGraw. While writing “Last Turn Home” for McGraw, Hurd met his wife, Maren Morris; now he’s guest-starring in her music videos. The songs he writes for himself are charmingly romantic, painting pictures of understated, easy affection. On “Love in a Bar” (which, naturally, is about Morris) he sings about falling hard for someone while sharing a few beers; his latest single, “To a T,” is an ode to a cozy night in. Both show his flair for believable love songs that aren’t cloyingly sweet. 212-260-4700, boweryballroom.com LES SAVY FAV at Junction (Jan. 25, 8 p.m.) and Elsewhere (Jan. 26, 7 p.m.). On Friday and Saturday, this art-punk quintet will perform their first local shows in more than two years. The band members have been experimenting with noise, pop and punk music for over two decades, but at this point — nearly nine years after their last new album, and with two members locked into a regular gig on “Late Night With Seth Meyers” — Les Savy Fav’s raucous, unpredictable live shows remain their calling card. Their gig at Junction in Long Beach, N.Y., is a benefit for Tommy Brull Foundation, an organization dedicated to helping people with special needs on Long Island; the band’s set at Elsewhere is sold out, but tickets are available through resellers. 516-889-1680, junction11561.comelsewherebrooklyn.com KACEY MUSGRAVES at the Beacon Theater (Jan. 25-26, 8 p.m.). A young country singer selling out two nights at one of New York City’s biggest theaters is newsworthy in and of itself; the fact that said country singer, Musgraves, is a woman working at a moment when country radio seems to be hostile to female artists only adds to the significance of this success. Long a critical darling, Musgraves took a pop-oriented swing with her mellow, sweet 2018 release, “Golden Hour,” and with its Grammy nomination for album of the year, she appears to have hit a home run. Tickets for both shows are available on the resale market. 212-465-6000, beacontheatre.com WU-TANG CLAN at Terminal 5 (Jan. 26-27, 8 p.m.). As part of the extended 25th anniversary celebration for their seminal 1993 debut, “Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers),” this Staten Island-bred rap group is performing two rare New York shows. Many of Wu-Tang’s nine founding members, including GZA, RZA, Method Man, Ghostface Killah and Raekwon, have found substantial success outside the group; “36 Chambers,” though, still holds importance. RZA recently told Complex of the release that “each of our lyrics are potent and become more substantiated as time goes on.” Both shows are sold out, but tickets are available through resellers. 212-582-6600, terminal5nyc.com [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] YOUNG DOLPH at Gramercy Theater (Jan. 31, 7 p.m.). Succeeding in rap without first rising through the ranks in one of its hubs — New York, Chicago, Atlanta or Los Angeles — is challenging. Yet Young Dolph’s commitment to representing his hometown, Memphis, remains steadfast. He’s also stayed independent, another unlikely choice for an M.C. who trades in catchy trap beats and streetwise lyrics just slightly more hard edged than the current trends on commercial rap radio. Fresh off his biggest solo success to date with the single “Major,” though, Dolph is starting to reap some rewards. The show is sold out, but tickets are available on the resale market.212-614-6932, thegramercytheatre.comNATALIE WEINER BRAXTON COOK at Baby’s All Right (Jan. 25, 8 p.m.). A gifted young alto saxophonist and vocalist, Cook is both a graduate of Juilliard’s notoriously traditionalist jazz program and a veteran of Christian Scott aTunde Adjuah’s genre-bending ensembles. In his increasingly acclaimed solo projects, Cook builds a contemporary, jazz-pop identity that draws from 1970s fusion, ’80s R&B and contemporary Los Angeles hip-hop. Through it all, he finds a way to let his bebop-rooted saxophone improvisations shine. At this concert, featuring a guest appearance from the trumpeter Theo Croker, he will draw material from “No Doubt,” an album he released late last year.babysallright.com ANTONIO HART QUINTET at Smoke (Jan. 25-26, 7, 9 and 10:30 p.m.). Hart, a stellar alto saxophonist who burst onto the New York scene alongside Roy Hargrove in the early 1990s as part of the Young Lions generation, has always worn his debt to Cannonball Adderley on his cuffs. Here he presents a tribute to Adderley, an iconic hard-bop saxophonist, in a quintet that features Freddie Hendrix on trumpet, Caili O’Doherty on piano, Alex Ayala on bass and Cory Cox on drums.212-864-6662, smokejazz.com VIJAY IYER at Jazz Standard (through Jan. 27, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). Iyer’s sextet has been one of the hottest commodities in jazz since the release of its debut, “Far From Over,” in 2017. A version of that band will play on Friday and Saturday, presenting Iyer’s beaming, rhythmically interleaved original music. Then on Sunday, Iyer will perform with a newer group that features some of his colleagues and students at Harvard University, where he teaches. (He’s also a MacArthur fellow.) That band is called the Ritual Ensemble, and it features Ganavya Doraiswamy on vocals, Yosvany Terry on saxophones and Rajna Swaminathan on mridangam, an Indian percussion instrument.212-576-2232, jazzstandard.com AVA MENDOZA ET AL. at H0L0 (Jan. 31, 7 p.m.). A conclave of young avant-garde improvisers will descend on this darkened basement in Ridgewood, Queens, for a night of free playing. It’s hard to know where things will go; if you go, steel yourself for a wide variety of musical textures and temperaments, most of them liberated from standard time and harmony. The performers include the thrashing, post-metal guitarist Ava Mendoza; the pensive tenor saxophonist Ingrid Laubrock; and the bassist Brandon Lopez, who uses his instrument in a variety of nontraditional ways.h0l0.nyc ‘THE MUSIC OF ANTHONY BRAXTON’ at Roulette (Jan. 25, 8 p.m.). One of the premier — and most prolific — living American composers, Braxton continues to release reams of new music, typically drawing on improvisation and built around his own complex musical systems. On Friday his 12-disc collection titled “GTM (Syntax) 2017,” featuring his Tri-Centric Vocal Ensemble, comes out. Here an 11-person version of that group performs in celebration of the record’s release. Afterward, the electronic musician Carl Testa and the pianist Cory Smythe will play music from a different part of Braxton’s repertoire, using a compositional system of his called Echo Echo Mirror House Music. 917-267-0368, roulette.org WADADA LEO SMITH at the Appel Room (Jan. 26, 7 and 9:30 p.m.). Every recording Smith releases feels apt to be called a “landmark.” It’s the awe-inspiring, wide-screen breadth of his trumpet sound, the slowly accruing power of his compositions, and his way of making even small ensembles sound spacious — and ancient. “America’s National Parks,” his widely acclaimed 2016 release celebrating the natural wonders of North America, stands out in particular for its tumultuous melodic beauty and the bristling, mutating forms of its compositions. At Jazz at Lincoln Center, Smith presents the New York City debut of this work, joined by the personnel from the album: the pianist Anthony Davis, the cellist Ashley Walters, the bassist John Lindberg and the drummer Pheeroan akLaff.212-721-6500, jazz.orgGIOVANNI RUSSONELLO "

AMEN DUNES at Warsaw (Feb. 1, 9 p.m.). To rehash bluesy rock in a way that’s genuinely compelling is a serious challenge, but Damon McMahon, frontman of Amen Dunes, has found his own way down that oft-trodden path. Especially on the band’s latest album, “Freedom,” there’s a refreshing restraint to their work, stripping away most of rock’s maximalism in favor of gentle, reverb-laden riffs that spotlight McMahon’s distinctive, ever-so-slightly wavering voice. The result is pleasant, mild chaos with enough familiar sounds to be an easy listen. The electronic artist Arthur opens. 212-777-6800, mercuryeastpresents.com/warsawconcerts TONI BRAXTON at Kings Theater (Feb. 7, 8 p.m.). This R&B titan takes over the cavernous theater in Flatbush, Brooklyn, for a show that has long been sold out (though tickets are available via resellers). Braxton specializes in dramatic, emotional epics, songs that are practically operatic in scope; her most enduring hit is “Un-Break My Heart,” a sweeping power ballad. Most remarkable, though, is that Braxton’s style has remained constant in spite of shifting R&B trends. Her 2018 album “Sex & Cigarettes,” a collection of cathartic, unrelenting songs about infidelity, earned three Grammy nominations. The trio SWV, responsible for chart toppers such as “Weak” and “Right Here,” will also perform. 718-856-5464, kingstheatre.com ESTELLE at Baby’s All Right (Feb. 6, 8 p.m.). This British singer’s 2008 major-label debut is best known for its smash hit “American Boy,” which features Kanye West as her raffish suitor. The release had another minor hit, though: “Come Over,” a pop-reggae song featuring Sean Paul. Estelle, whose father is from Grenada, revisited reggae and dancehall on her most recent record, 2018’s “Lover’s Rock” — a tribute to the buoyant, romantic British reggae subgenre that goes by the same name. The album, released on the legendary reggae label VP Records, features heavy hitters including Chronixx, Tarrus Riley and Konshens. 718-599-5800, babysallright.com SHAMIR at Brooklyn Bazaar (Feb. 2, 8 p.m.). Pinning a genre to this singer-songwriter from Las Vegas is challenging. His 2015 debut, “Ratchet,” is eclectic synth-pop with 1980s flair; his latest, last year’s “Resolution,” is stripped-down indie rock that includes songs like “I Can’t Breathe,” which focuses on police killings, and “The Things You Loved,” which has a folksy twang. There are constants, though: Shamir’s instantly identifiable voice — high and sweet with an acidic edge — and his songwriting. Even as his sound becomes more rough-hewed, his songs remain taut and compelling.bkbazaar.com TIBET HOUSE US BENEFIT CONCERT at Carnegie Hall (Feb. 7, 7:30 p.m.). For the 32nd year in a row, Tibet House US, an organization devoted to preserving Tibetan culture and protecting its refugees, will host an all-star musical benefit. This year’s edition, curated by Philip Glass, a longtime participant, includes Laurie Anderson, Jon Batiste, Debbie Harry, Jason Isbell, Angelique Kidjo, Nathaniel Rateliff, New Order’s Bernard Sumner and the Tibetan artist Tenzin Choegyal. Stephen Colbert will be on hand for comic relief. And surprise one-off collaborations are likely; last year, Patti Smith and Angel Olsen covered the Velvet Underground’s “I Found a Reason.” 212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org TRIBALISTAS at the Hammerstein Ballroom (Feb. 5, 8 p.m.). The singers Arnaldo Antunes, Marisa Monte and Carlinhos Brown were already stars in Brazil before joining forces to record their 2002 album, “Tribalistas.” A collection of lilting songs in the tradition of what’s known as “musica popular brasileira” — a post-bossa-nova movement dedicated to integrating international sounds into Brazilian music — the album boosted the supergroup to international success, selling over three million copies globally. It took 15 years for the trio to release a follow-up, also simply called “Tribalistas”; now, they’re performing in New York for the first time as a group.800-745-3000, mc34.com [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] YOLA at Rockwood Music Hall, Stage 2 (Feb. 6, 7 p.m.). Country-soul seems overdue for some mainstream attention, thanks to the parallel success of old-school singers like Leon Bridges and Charles Bradley, and outlaw-era-inspired country stars like Chris Stapleton and Miranda Lambert. Yola, whose Southern soul sound belies her upbringing in southwest England, is as good a candidate as any to spark such a renaissance. Her rich alto fits in seamlessly alongside the slide guitars, jangling piano and lush arrangements on her upcoming debut, “Walk Through Fire,” produced by the Black Keys’ Dan Auerbach.212-477-4155, rockwoodmusichall.comNATALIE WEINER J. D. ALLEN QUARTET at Smoke (Feb. 1-2, 7, 9 and 10:30 p.m.). One of today’s premier tenor saxophonists, Allen spent the last decade working with a steady trio, developing a sturdy but flexible sound based around minor melodies and bristling postbop rhythms. But he recently assembled a new trio featuring a couple of younger musicians, the bassist Ian Kenselaar and the drummer Nic Cacioppo. The early returns are good: An appearance at Winter Jazzfest, where the new trio was joined by the tenor saxophone luminary David Murray, showed how ably the young players have adapted to Allen’s personal style. This weekend the group performs with another of Allen’s frequent collaborators: the crisply expressive guitarist Liberty Ellman.212-864-6662, smokejazz.com JIMMY COBB at Jazz Standard (Jan. 31-Feb. 3, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). Cobb, a drummer and National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master, will probably be remembered as the drummer whose crackling ride cymbal adorned Miles Davis’s 1959 classic, “Kind of Blue.” But his career is much bigger than that one date: He accompanied Sarah Vaughan and John Coltrane and Freddie Hubbard, playing on countless record dates and remaining in the top tier of New York jazz for over 60 years. Cobb turned 90 in January, and he celebrates this weekend in a quartet featuring Peter Bernstein on guitar, Tadataka Unno on piano and John Webber on bass.212-576-2232, jazzstandard.com PEDRO GIRAUDO TANGO QUARTET AND SOFIA TOSELLO at Joe’s Pub (Feb. 1, 9:30 p.m.). Giraudo is an Argentine bassist and composer who reinforces his love for tango with a mastery of Western classical and jazz vocabulary. He sometimes performs with a full orchestra, but he’s just as dazzling with his quartet — the group that appears on his 2018 album, “Vigor Tanguero,” which won a Latin Grammy for best tango album. Also on the bill is Sofia Tosello, a vocalist whose last album, “Lluvia Fue” (“Chamber Tango”), presents its own distinctive take on the tango tradition, mixing old songs and new.212-967-7555, publictheater.org MARÍA GRAND QUARTET AND JOEL ROSS GOOD VIBES at Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola (Feb. 5, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). Grand, a tenor saxophonist, and Ross, a vibraphonist, are two of the most-buzzed-about young players on the New York jazz scene — each with their own sleek, sanguine take on mainstream jazz. They’re also frequent collaborators, and at Dizzy’s on Tuesday they will split the bill, with Grand’s quartet (the vocalist Fay Victor, the bassist Kanoa Mendenhall and the drummer Savannah Harris) starting things off, and Ross’s group (Mendenhall on bass, Immanuel Wilkins on alto saxophone, Jeremy Corren on piano and Jeremy Dutton on drums) playing the second set. Tickets for each performance are sold separately.212-258-9595, jazz.org/dizzys HYPNOTIC BRASS ENSEMBLE at the Blue Note (Jan. 31-Feb. 3, 8 and 10:30 p.m.). The brass-band tradition is naturally associated with New Orleans, but Hypnotic proudly espouses its Chicago roots. With less marching-band thunder and more hip-hop swagger than, say, New Orleans’s Dirty Dozen Brass Band, this eight-piece ensemble mixes the influence of hip-hop, soul and gospel into a coolly grooving sound. And Chicago’s deep legacy as a cradle of experimental, Afrocentric jazz is never far away: All but one of Hypnotic’s members is a son of Kelan Philip Cohran, a patriarch of Chicago’s creative black music scene, who died in 2017.212-475-8592, bluenote.net EIVIND OPSVIK OVERSEAS AND SNARK HORSE at Nublu 151 (Feb. 6, 9 p.m.). A Norwegian-born bassist with a big, dark tone and precision chops, Opsvik writes music with an irreverent intensity, adhering to no single style and showing little interest in the mannered formality of so much progressive jazz. Much of his latest album, the fifth installment of his “Overseas” series, boasts the rugged conviction of rock music and the tangled melodic momentum of a fugue. At Nublu 151, he shares the bill with Snark Horse, an all-star group of improvisers playing short, nervous melodies that they repeat and deconstruct. Snark Horse appears here in quartet form with Matt Mitchell on piano, Ava Mendoza on guitar, Matt Nelson on tenor saxophone and Kate Gentile on drums.nublu.netGIOVANNI RUSSONELLO "
5c5024293a125f5075c06d72,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/29/well/mind/fighting-the-stigma-of-mental-illness-through-music.html,"When Ronald Braunstein conducts an orchestra, there’s no sign of his bipolar disorder. He’s confident and happy. Music isn’t his only medicine, but its healing power is potent. Scientific research has shown that music helps fight depression, lower blood pressure and reduce pain. The National Institutes of Health has a partnership with the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts called Sound Health: Music and the Mind, to expand on the links between music and mental health. It explores how listening to, performing or creating music involves brain circuitry that can be harnessed to improve health and well-being. Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said: “We’re bringing neuroscientists together with musicians to speak each other’s language. Mental health conditions are among those areas we’d like to see studied.” Mr. Braunstein, 63, has experienced the benefits of music for his own mental health and set out to bring them to others by founding orchestras in which the performers are all people affected by mental illness. Upon graduating from the Juilliard School in his early 20s, he entered a summer program at the Salzburg Mozarteum in Austria, and in 1979 became the first American to win the prestigious Karajan International Conducting Competition in Berlin.  His career took off. He worked with orchestras in Europe, Israel, Australia and Tokyo. At the time, he didn’t have a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. But looking back, he can see that his disorder contributed to his success, and his talent masked the condition. “The unbelievable mania I experienced helped me win the Karajan,” he said. “I learned repertoire fast. I studied through the night and wouldn’t sleep. I didn’t eat because if I did, it would take away my edge.” “My bipolar disorder was just under the line of being under control,” he said. “It wasn’t easily detected. Most people thought I was weird.” He always sensed something was askew. When he was 15, his father took him to a doctor who diagnosed “bad nerves” and prescribed Valium. As his career progressed, things started to unravel, and his behavior grew increasingly erratic. He was given a diagnosis of bipolar disorder at age 35. His manager dropped him as a client, and he was fired from a conducting job in Vermont. It was there he met Caroline Whiddon, who had been the chairwoman of the Youth Orchestra Division of the League of American Orchestras. She had been given a diagnosis of depression and anxiety disorder more than 20 years earlier, and had played French horn professionally, which she described as “a notorious instrument that’s known for breaking people.”   Mr. Braunstein reached out to her about creating an orchestra that welcomed musicians with mental illnesses and family members and friends who support them.  “I never thought I’d go back to playing French horn again,” she said. “Ronald gave me back the gift of music.” Mr. Braunstein called his new venture the Me2/Orchestra, because when he told other musicians about his mental health diagnosis, they’d often respond, “Me too.” Since the term #MeToo is now associated with sexual assault cases, people sometimes ask if the orchestra is connected to that cause. “It gives us an opportunity to explain that we were founded in 2011,” in Burlington, Vt., “before the Me Too movement began,” Ms. Whiddon said. In 2014, a second orchestra, Me2/Boston, was created. In between, in 2013, Mr. Braunstein and Ms. Whiddon got married. Each orchestra performs between six and eight times a year. Each has about 50 musicians, both amateur and professional, ranging in age from 13 to over 80, and they rehearse once a week. New affiliate ensembles in Portland, Ore., and Atlanta follow similar schedules. Mr. Braunstein gives free private lessons to those who want to polish their skills. Me2/Orchestra is a nonprofit, and the musicians are all volunteers. Ms. Whiddon raises money through an annual letter-writing campaign to cover expenses, with support from more than 100 donors. “When we perform at a hospital, center for the homeless or correctional facility,” Ms. Whiddon said, “the cost of that performance is covered by corporate sponsorships, grants or donations from individuals, so the performance is free to those who attend.” Participating in Me2/Boston allowed Nancy-Lee Mauger, age 55, to pick up the French horn again. The note on the rehearsal door — “This is a stigma-free zone” — made her feel welcome. Ms. Mauger had played French horn until her mental illness made it impossible to perform. She has diagnoses of dissociative identity disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. “In 2009, I was playing a Christmas Eve gig,” she said. “It was at the same church, with the same quintet, choir and music that I had played every Christmas Eve for 15 years. This particular night felt different. I had trouble focusing my eyes. At one point, I could not read music or play my horn.” It lasted about two minutes, and she thought she was having a stroke. In fact, it was her mental illness. “I learned that little parts of me would come out and try to play my horn during gigs,” she said. “The problem was that they didn’t know how to play. This became such an obvious problem that I quit.” Now, after four years of intensive therapy, she is able to play again. At each performance, a few musicians briefly talk about their mental illnesses and take questions from the audience. “Instead of thinking people with mental illnesses are lazy or dangerous, they see what we’re capable of,” Mr. Braunstein said. “It has a positive effect on all of us.” Jessica Stuart, now 34, stopped playing violin in her mid-20s when she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. “Joining the Me2/Orchestra in Boston in 2014 was the first time I had played in years,” she said. “I cannot count the ways the orchestra helps me. It has allowed me to overcome the shame I felt about living with mental illness. I no longer feel I have to hide an important part of my life from the rest of the world.” Jessie Bodell, a 26-year-old flute player who has borderline personality disorder, said he finds rehearsals fun, relaxed and democratic. He noted that unlike most orchestras, Me2 doesn’t have first, second or third positions. “There isn’t an underlying, tense, competitive feeling here,” he said. “We’ve seen when you sing or play an instrument, it doesn’t just activate one part of your brain,” said Dr. Collins of the National Institutes of Health. “A whole constellation of brain areas becomes active. Our response to music is separate from other interventions such as asking people to recall memories or listen to another language.” Partnering with Dr. Collins on Sound Health is Renée Fleming, the renowned soprano and artistic adviser to the Kennedy Center. “The first goal is to move music therapy forward as a discipline,” she said. “The second is to educate the public and enlighten people about the power of music to heal.” So far the initiative is investigating how music could help Parkinson’s patients walk with a steady gait, help stroke survivors regain the ability to speak, and give cancer patients relief from chronic pain. “The payoff,” Dr. Collins said, is to “improve mental health. We know music shares brain areas with movement, memory, motivation and reward. These things are hugely important to mental health, and researchers are trying to use this same concept of an alternate pathway to address new categories of mental disorders.” "
5c3e3bc63a125f5075c048eb,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/15/arts/music/jeremy-geffen-carnegie-hall-cal-performances-berkeley.html,"How do you get from Carnegie Hall? You get an offer to run one of the most vibrant performing arts organizations on the West Coast. Jeremy Geffen, who has been an important tastemaker in New York during his dozen years on the artistic planning team at Carnegie Hall, is leaving to become the executive and artistic director of Cal Performances, the arts producer and presenter at the University of California, Berkeley. “What appeals to me about Cal Performances is that it’s the intersection of many strands of music, dance and drama, with the intellectual curiosity of one of the world’s top university environments,” Mr. Geffen, 44, said in a telephone interview about his new post, which was announced on Tuesday afternoon. He will start in Berkeley on April 1. The West Coast is increasingly the center of American musical experimentation, with the Los Angeles Philharmonic the most adventurous symphonic ensemble in the country and the San Francisco Symphony having recently named the composer and conductor Esa-Pekka Salonen its next music director. Cal Performances has long been an important music presenter; this season’s lineup includes the cellist Yo-Yo Ma; Daniel Barenboim conducting the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra; and the mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato. But it also features dance companies, including the Mark Morris Dance Group and Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater; theater troupes from around the world; and the creation of new work. One of its most ambitious offerings this season will be “Dreamers,” an oratorio it commissioned about the lives of young, undocumented immigrants by the composer Jimmy López and the playwright Nilo Cruz. Mr. Salonen will conduct the Philharmonia Orchestra and the soprano Ana María Martínez in the premiere on March 17. [Read about how the election of Donald Trump changed the tone of the piece.] Mr. Geffen has taken a leading role in Carnegie’s artistic planning, including its annual citywide festivals in recent years, and its fostering of new work, including its 125 Commissions Project in celebration of the hall’s 125th anniversary. He said that he looked forward to collaborations at Cal Performances that would tap the expertise and energy of the Berkeley campus. “If there is any type of experience that has been meaningful to me, it’s identifying either uncelebrated or unknown talents — whether that’s compositional or performing — and giving them a platform,” he said. “Because almost every time, they have knocked the ball out of the park.” Clive Gillinson, Carnegie Hall’s executive and artistic director, said Mr. Geffen would be missed for his deep knowledge and prodigious memory. “There comes a time in everybody’s life when they want more responsibilities, broader responsibilities, and to run an institution themselves,” he said in a telephone interview. In Berkeley, Mr. Geffen succeeds Matías Tarnopolsky, who left last summer to lead the Philadelphia Orchestra. It will be a return to the West Coast for Mr. Geffen, who was born in South Africa and raised in Orange County, Calif., where he first developed his interest in music. “I would not have been in music at all had not been for being in the public school system, and we had an instrumental music program at my junior high school and high school and that’s where I got my training,” he said, adding, “I want to share those experiences, I want to share those opportunities.” "
5c94966149f0eacbf105e701,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/22/arts/music/band-name-reunions.html,"The singer Ian Hunter recently announced a reunion tour of Mott the Hoople, the British band that recorded some memorable hits in the early 1970s. But, Hunter tacitly acknowledged, it wasn’t quite a reunion. Of Hunter’s four bandmates from Mott’s defining 1972 album, “All the Young Dudes,” two are dead and one is incapacitated from a stroke. Multiple deaths are rarely the end of great rock bands. So Hunter will tour with the guitarist and keyboard player who joined Mott for its anticlimactic 1974 swan song, “The Hoople.” Displaying a level of honesty rarely embraced by those trying to sell concert tickets, he called this band not Mott the Hoople, but Mott the Hoople ’74. It’s possible that Hunter could have picked some musicians from a Craigslist ad and legally presented the group as Mott the Hoople. (He declined an interview request.) Increasingly, calculated misrepresentations are part of an older band’s repertoire. Once a band name turns into a brand name, there’s a strong incentive to continue on, even with a lineup that makes fans ask, “Who are these guys?” As rock approaches its eighth decade, partially intact bands are more the rule than the exception. If you’re a purist who wants to see only bands with their full original lineups, you’d better love U2. Kiss is on a farewell tour featuring half of its original lineup, Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley. (The other half, Peter Criss and Ace Frehley, are alive). Ditto for the Who, touring this spring with Roger Daltrey and Pete Townshend. (The other half, John Entwistle and Keith Moon, are dead.) Yes and Journey march on, as did Boston for a while, despite not having their original singers. Styx tours without Dennis DeYoung, who wrote and sang its biggest hits. Lynyrd Skynyrd, currently on its own farewell tour, is down to one original member, as is Eagles. Foreigner tours with only one founding member, the guitarist and songwriter Mick Jones, and when Jones became ill a few years ago, the band continued without even him. This fractious dynamic isn’t limited to classic-rock bands: The punk groups Dead Kennedys and the Undertones have long toured without their original singers. Bikini Kill’s shows this spring won’t feature the band’s first guitarist, Billy Karren. Recent tours by Pixies, Smashing Pumpkins and the Replacements, who each lacked one or more key band members, prompted social-media arguments about whether fans were seeing the “real” band. “IF IT’S ME and your granny on bongos, it’s the Fall,” the singer Mark E. Smith, who peremptorily hired and fired dozens of members of the Fall, once said. But only a few musicians can carry off such lordly “l’état, c’est moi” proclamations. Mick Jones might be on that short list. Over the years, Foreigner has shed every main member of its early lineups until only Jones was left. But, argued Phil Carson, the band’s manager, “There’s only been one original member, ever. Mick handpicked everyone. We’ve had five or six keyboard players, almost countless drummers. If Mick Jones says it’s Foreigner, it’s Foreigner.” In August 2011, the group was playing a show at Jones Beach on Long Island when Jones felt too ill to continue. He was diagnosed with cardiovascular problems, but tour dates had been booked, so Foreigner continued on without the one man who’s synonymous with it. Jones still sometimes misses shows, depending on his health. Last year, when he was forced to skip a show at a 10,000-seat arena in Tel Aviv, a fan told The Jerusalem Post he felt the night was “tainted with con.” (Foreigner is huge in Israel. Who knew?) But Carson says fans enjoy Foreigner just as much whether Jones is onstage or in his slippers at home: “I’d say 90 percent of people at the shows have no clue who was in Foreigner.” For each fan, there’s an invisible emotional calculus involved in deciding whether a band is or isn’t still “real.” That accounting can seem arbitrary to others. I loved seeing the Replacements in 2014 with only two of its four original members, yet I would not see Pixies, who are touring through mid-April, because they’re missing the bassist Kim Deal, one of its original quartet. If it’s weird to care that much about a bassist, well, being a rock fan is often weird. Brian Koppelman, a former record executive and current pop-culture maven who co-created the Showtime series “Billions,” saw Van Halen play in 2006 without its longtime bassist Michael Anthony, and felt it wasn’t “the real Van Halen.” And despite the magnetism of Robin Zander, he refuses to see Cheap Trick now that the drummer Bun E. Carlos isn’t in the band. “His playing and attitude, the way he held a cigarette, that’s Cheap Trick to me,” he said. “I want to know that we don’t have to die. When I’m with my favorite bands, I can forget mortality for a minute. But I can’t if they’ve been affected by time and the vagaries of the world.” Koppelman believes there’s a “purely romantic ideal” to loving a band, especially one whose set list can summon feelings from days you often can’t remember. He and I are not the only reunion truthers prone to dramatic feelings about bass players. Briony Edwards, the editor of the music site Louder, loved Smashing Pumpkins when she was “an angsty teenager,” and she especially cherished the bassist, D’arcy Wretzky. Last year, Smashing Pumpkins reunited for a tour that purportedly celebrated its legacy, but Wretzky wasn’t in the band. “People say D’arcy wasn’t important, she didn’t write songs,” Edwards said, “but my enjoyment of their music is based on the relationship I had with them when I was a teenager.” Edwards saw the D’arcy-devoid Pumpkins at London’s Wembley Arena, and felt cheated: “As a fan, you come preloaded with ridiculous opinions you’re willing to die for.” Rock music constantly asks the question, “What’s real and make believe?” Strict constructionists like Koppelman, Edwards and I may scoff at some incomplete band reunions, but for less skeptical fans, including apparently many people who adore Foreigner, there’s a simpler, ontological litmus test. If you have as grand an emotional experience seeing Journey without Steve Perry as you would with him, how is your experience not real? Because if Journey won’t perform with Perry, your choice isn’t Fake Journey or Real Journey, it’s Semi-Journey or No Journey at All. WHILE FANS MIGHT feel joy at seeing a band that’s missing a key member, there are few happy feelings for the spurned exes. DeYoung, for instance, has not gone to see Styx play with a lineup that doesn’t include him. “I saw them plenty in the first 20 years,” he wisecracked. When Styx began to perform in 1999 without DeYoung, who was ill with a virus that left him sensitive to bright lights, he was one of four partners in the band who jointly owned the name. He sued, claiming misuse of the Styx trademark, and his ex-bandmates countersued. “We came to a settlement,” DeYoung said. “I can’t divulge the details, but I won’t have to sit on a street corner and sell cookies.” He is currently on tour with a show billed as Dennis DeYoung and the Music of Styx, and Styx still tours with Lawrence Gowan, a keyboardist who sings DeYoung’s hits in an imitative tenor. “I’m not in the band I helped make famous,” DeYoung said with a mix of frustration and resignation. “I wish I was in Styx, but I’m powerless.” Disputes over the rights to a band’s name are thorny because they combine elements of trademark law and contract law, said Loren Chodosh, an entertainment attorney whose clients have included Nada Surf and TV on the Radio. Band names typically qualify as trademarks, and trademarks can be assigned by contract. “A band agreement, in a lot of ways, is like a prenup,” Chodosh said. “It’s about what will happen if things go wrong and somebody leaves, which nobody wants to talk about. Bands don’t start to hate each other until they’re successful.” Most bands, Chodosh said, never establish contractually how the band trademark is owned. In the absence of a contract, she added, “Trademark law prevails. And because trademark law is not uncomplicated, it’s difficult to say who owns that trademark.” Before there was an internet where fans could find up-to-date information, bands engaged in outright chicanery. When the Velvet Underground played England in 1971 with the drummer Maureen Tucker as the only original member, a Melody Maker reviewer deemed it “a travesty, a masquerade.” Then Tucker quit, and the group continued. One of the faux Velvet Underground’s tours of England was arranged by Clifford Davis, the manager of Fleetwood Mac, who in 1974 fabricated an all-time deceit. The band had canceled tour dates after the drummer Mick Fleetwood discovered his wife was in love with one of his bandmates, but Davis was unwilling to return the advances promoters had paid, so he cobbled together a sham band while claiming that he owned the name. “He can put four dogs barking on a leash and call it Fleetwood Mac,” the singer Bob Welch quipped in Rolling Stone. Band ownership isn’t about what’s right or fair, but about what’s legal. In 1954, Clyde McPhatter of the Drifters sold his half-share of the vocal group to its manager, George Treadwell, who signed new members to personal services contracts, then hired and fired them at his whim. After he died, the trademark passed on to his wife, and then their daughter, as though it were an ancestral quilt. Chuck Negron, a founding member of Three Dog Night who sang several of its biggest hits, including “Joy to the World,” said that bandmates had him sign a contract — which stipulated that any member fired from the group would have no further right to use the name — while he was a heroin addict. Negron was later fired for missing shows. His attempt to bill himself as “Chuck Negron, formerly of Three Dog Night” led to a legal battle that the two parties resolved by agreeing that he could use the “formerly” designation, provided that in all print advertisements, the words Three Dog Night were no larger than half the size of the words Chuck Negron. After his former bandmate Cory Wells died in 2015, Negron listened to a current version of Three Dog Night and felt it was “a rip off. Not to say the people in the band aren’t good, but they just aren’t the same ilk.” Though bitter, he’s also proud that the music is still meaningful to people. “There are people who just want to hear that music and relive that time of their lives, and don’t care if two cats and an elephant are singing it.” IF YOU’RE ONE of those people who can enjoy a band even if most of the founding members are gone, consider two cases of groups with zero original musicians. The drummer Bobby Colomby co-founded the New York jazz-rock group Blood, Sweat & Tears, which grew to eight by the time of its 1968 debut. Band members left and were replaced, and by 1974, Colomby was the only original member in the group. “We had an agreement: Last man standing owns it,” he said. While Colomby took a less itinerant job, as an executive at CBS Records, he leased the Blood, Sweat & Tears name to David Clayton-Thomas, who sang the group’s signature hits, including “Spinning Wheel,” but was not an original member. After a 20-year lease, Clayton-Thomas formed a new band in 2004, so Colomby hired musicians to tour as his salaried employees. “As far as I’m concerned, as long as I’m the guy behind it, it’s still the original band,” he said, adding that if his 1960s bandmates still played in the group, “you’d see guys with walkers onstage.” Blood, Sweat & Tears still play 55 to 65 shows a year, according to its manager, Larry Dorr. In a phone interview with Dorr and Colomby, neither could name all current members of the band. But Colomby likens it to a franchise: “When you go to a Yankees game, what do you see? There’s no Babe Ruth, no Mickey Mantle. But you’re going to see the pinstripes, a tradition, a style.” Blood, Sweat & Tears, he insists, isn’t a group of specific people, “it’s a musical concept.” Soft rock bands are not exempt from legal feuds. Wayne Nelson, a bassist who joined the Little River Band in time for the successful group’s sixth album in 1981, said with a laugh, “We fought as much as a metal band, but it was all passive-aggressive.” Nelson was a paid employee first, and then was made a partner via LRB Proprietary Ltd., the group’s unit trust. When singer Glenn Shorrock left, he was paid $85,000 to turn over his shares, Nelson said. Eventually, the name was owned by the guitarist Stephen Housden, who had joined for the group’s seventh album, and stopped touring in 2006. Now, Nelson effectively licenses the trademark from Housden, who earns tour income without ever leaving his home. Shorrock and two other founding members tried to perform as the Original Little River Band, but Housden forced them to change the name. Since then, the band’s ex-members have called the current lineup “a tribute band” and “a joke.” No musician grows up dreaming of fighting in court and parrying insults, but, Nelson concluded, “That’s the life of a band in these times.” "

Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra, based in San Francisco and one of the country’s most respected period-instrument ensembles, will be passing its harpsichord, too. The orchestra announced on Thursday that its next music director would be the conductor (and harpsichordist) Richard Egarr, who will succeed the conductor (and harpsichordist) Nicholas McGegan, stepping down from the post in 2020, after 35 years. Mr. Egarr is currently the music director of the Academy of Ancient Music in Britain, where he took over from its founder, Christopher Hogwood, in 2006. He will step down from that post — where his tenure included performing Purcell’s “Dido and Aeneas” in Libya — in 2021. Mr. Egarr said in a telephone interview that he looks forward to leading the Philharmonia Baroque, which he has conducted three times since 2012 — and which he said that, for all its differences, also bore some resemblances to the Academy of Ancient Music. “What is similar is there is a very free spirit,” said Mr. Egarr, 55, who was born in Lincoln, England, and who now lives in Amsterdam with his family. He will begin in the 2020-21 season as music director designate, and officially assume the title the following season. Mr. Egarr said that he looked forward to exploring a wide array of repertoire — including early-17th-century works by composers including Monteverdi; Bach’s passions and B-minor Mass, which he said he would like to perform with the Philharmonia Chorale; and some Romantic pieces, such as Schumann’s Requiem, a rarity he recently led. “It has had terrible press ever since it was written,” he said, “but it’s actually a little masterpiece.” "
5c40c4c43a125f5075c04f51,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/obituaries/bonnie-guitar-dead.html,"Bonnie Guitar, who had hit records as a country singer and guitarist, but whose biggest achievement may have been her work as a businesswoman in the male-dominated music industry, died on Jan. 12 in Soap Lake, Wash. She was 95. Howard Reitzes, a longtime friend, confirmed her death, at a rehabilitation hospital. Ms. Guitar was best known for her recording of “Dark Moon,” a Top 20 country single on the Dot label that crossed over to the pop Top 10 in 1957. The record, a haunting nocturne sung in a clear-toned alto, was, along with Patsy Cline’s “Walkin’ After Midnight” — which reached the pop Top 40 the same year — one of the earliest records by a female country singer to cross over to the pop chart. “Dark Moon,” which also made the pop Top 10 in a subsequent version by Gale Storm, earned Ms. Guitar an invitation to appear on “The Ed Sullivan Show” in June 1957. Later that year she performed “Mister Fire Eyes,” her successful follow-up to “Dark Moon,” on the TV show “American Bandstand.” But the achievement for which Ms. Guitar never really received her due, perhaps because she decided to remain in her native Washington instead of resettling in a major recording center like Los Angeles or Nashville, was her trailblazing work as a studio maven and entrepreneur. Over seven decades she did everything from engineer recordings to scout talent and run a record label. In the late 1950s, returning to Seattle after a brief tenure as a session guitarist for the producer Fabor Robison in Los Angeles, she established Dolphin Records with two local businessmen, Bob Reisdorf and Lou Lavinthal. Under her creative direction, Dolphin — which soon changed its name to Dolton — signed the Fleetwoods, a doo-wop-inspired trio of teenagers from Olympia, Wash., whose gauzy pop recordings “Come Softly to Me” and “Mr. Blue” both topped the pop chart in 1959. Ms. Guitar was credited only as the arranger on the trio’s big hits (Mr. Reisdorf, a refrigerator salesman, was listed as producer), but her role was more than such billing might suggest. “Because they had so much air in their voices, I had to do a lot of different fooling with microphones to get enough sound on the tape to saturate the tape,” Ms. Guitar said of her work with the Fleetwoods in an interview with No Depression magazine in 2006. “I knew that the sound would be interesting to people, because they were so used to the full sound. I wanted it to come out, but I wanted it to be intimate. And I knew also not to use a regular guitar sound. I put nylon strings on my guitar, and I played just little, tinkling notes behind them.” Dolton’s other landmark release under Ms. Guitar’s supervision was “Walk — Don’t Run,” a No. 2 pop hit in 1960 for the instrumental combo the Ventures, which came to be regarded as a surf-rock classic. Ms. Guitar had a minor pop hit as a performer for Dolton with a song she wrote, “Candy Apple Red.” On an album she recorded in 1959 for RCA, which went unreleased at the time but was eventually issued by Bear Family Records in 2013 under the title “Intimate Session — the Velvet Lounge,” she sang in the pop-torch mode of Peggy Lee and Julie London. Backing her on the sessions were her fellow guitarists Billy Strange and Tommy Tedesco and other future members of the famed Los Angeles studio entourage known as the Wrecking Crew. Ms. Guitar and her business partners sold the Dolton label to Liberty Records in 1963. She returned to Dot, as a recording artist, producer and talent scout, two years later. Bonnie Guitar was born Bonnie Buckingham on March 25, 1923, in Seattle. Her parents, Doris and John, raised her and her five siblings on a farm outside Auburn, Wash., some 10 miles east of the Puget Sound. Ms. Guitar’s brothers gave her their flat-top Gibson guitar when she was 13. Soon after that, she started entering local talent contests and performing in a musical revue that appeared throughout the region. She also began using the stage name Bonnie Guitar. In the early 1940s she met and started taking music lessons from the guitar teacher and inventor Paul Tutmarc. They married in 1944 and had a daughter, Paula, before parting ways in 1955. Ms. Guitar released a series of country hits for Dot in the 1960s, including three that reached the country Top 10: “A Woman in Love,” “I’m Living in Two Worlds” and “I Believe in Love.” She was named female vocalist of the year by the Academy of Country Music in 1966. In 1969 Ms. Guitar married Mario DePiano. The couple raised cattle and quarter horses together on an 80-acre ranch in Sumner, Wash., about 30 miles from Seattle. Ms. Guitar had all but retired from music business at that point, releasing only the occasional record, until her husband died in 1983. After that she started performing again, most notably as a regular at the Notaras Lodge near her home in Soap Lake. She is survived by a granddaughter, a great-granddaughter and a great-great-grandson. Her daughter died in 2013. Fewer than 5 percent of producers and engineers working in the music industry today are women, according to Women’s Audio Mission, a nonprofit organization that equips women for careers in creative technology. The number was doubtless a fraction of that when Ms. Guitar was staking her claim to a place at the controls of a recording studio. “I worked in the mixing with the engineer, but I worked as an assistant there,” she recalled to No Depression, referring to her apprenticeship with the producer Fabor Robison in Los Angeles in the 1950s. “I’d keep the records, do the cataloging and things. So I learned to operate the equipment.” “Fabor was difficult to work with,” she added, “but I didn’t care. My whole intent was to learn to produce and learn the studio.” "

BROTHERS OSBORNE at Terminal 5 (Jan. 23, 8 p.m.). For those who appreciate their country music with a healthy dose of roadhouse-ready rock, this Maryland-based duo have released a series of up-tempo, guitar-heavy singles that have earned them both critical acclaim (including five Grammy nods) and a considerable following. Their rough-around-the-edges sound — relative to the slick Nashville aesthetic that’s currently in vogue — has endeared them to those country fans alienated by the genre’s radio-driven conformity. The show is sold out, but tickets are available through the resale market. 212-582-6600, terminal5nyc.com CAM’RON at S.O.B.’s (Jan. 19, 8 p.m.). This Harlem-based M.C. will bring his collection of irresistible, party-starting tracks to this intimate club in SoHo. As a member of the Diplomats, best known for their earthshaking self-titled anthem, Cam’ron helped shape the sound of uptown rap in the late 1990s. Soon after, his solo efforts translated into two massive crossover hits: the indelible “Oh Boy” and “Hey Ma.” Since then, he has remained beloved among rap aficionados for his bombastic, club-ready tracks, but he has enough memorable songs and collaborations to appeal to those newer to the genre. 212-243-4940, sobs.com ANTHONY HAMILTON at Kings Theater (Jan. 19, 8 p.m.). This R&B singer retains the aura of a different time — his rich, smooth voice and defiantly traditional instrumentation have long set him apart from many peers in the genre. His breakthrough in the early 2000s, for example, was fueled by an appearance on the bluesy, rustic Nappy Roots hit “Po’ Folks.” He has continued to draw on everything from classic gospel, with his 2016 single “Amen,” to barbershop harmonies, releasing a series of viral covers of rap hits with his quartet, the Hamiltones. 718-856-5464, kingstheatre.com KING PRINCESS at Warsaw (Jan. 23, 7 p.m.) and Irving Plaza (Jan. 24, 7 p.m.). “I hate it when dudes try to chase me,” sings Mikaela Straus at the opening of her hit single “1950,” which she released under her stage name, King Princess — and somehow that’s not even the song’s most memorable line. Catchy, romantic pop confections are quickly becoming the 20-year-old singer-songwriter’s specialty, despite the fact that she has yet to put out a full-length album. What she has created so far, though, stretches the boundaries of pop norms with titles like “Pussy Is God” and stories about women falling in and out of love with one another. Both shows are sold out, but tickets are available through resellers. 212-777-6800, mercuryeastpresents.com LARAAJI at the Park Church Co-op (Jan. 24, 7 p.m.). Though this septuagenarian’s big break came with the release of his Brian Eno-produced album “Ambient 3: Day of Radiance” in 1980, in recent years he’s garnered a number of new fans thanks in part to a series of reissues from the trendy electronic label Leaving Records. Laraaji makes serene New Age music on an array of instruments including the zither, the hammered dulcimer and the piano. This meditative set will, fittingly, take place in a Brooklyn church. Rachika S, a local ambient electronic composer, opens. eventbrite.com  THIS IS HIP HOP at the Apollo Theater (Jan. 18, 8 p.m.). Hip-hop, with its generally spare instrumentation, has long been a good fit for festival-style concerts that squeeze in a number of acts. The legendary lyricist Rakim and a slew of local rap groups active from the 1980s to the early 2000s — the Lox, E.P.M.D., Black Moon and Brand Nubian — will be sharing the turntables and microphones at this old-school affair. For New York rap fans, it’s a head-nodding trip down memory lane; for those new to the genre, it’s a vital history lesson. 212-531-5305, apollotheater.orgNATALIE WEINER AARON BURNETT AND THE BIG MACHINE at the Cell (Jan. 19, 9 p.m.). Boisterous and urgent, the tenor saxophonist Burnett sounds like he could be living on the jazz avant-garde of the 1970s, or surviving a cyborg apocalypse three decades in the future. His new album with the Big Machine is “Anomaly,” full of original compositions with a weird, seductive darkness — from ballads to scorching, unsettled postbop. Burnett celebrates the disc’s release with an iteration of the Big Machine that includes Joel Ross on vibraphone, Carlos Homs on piano, Nick Jozwiak on bass and Dan Nadeau on drums. 646-861-2253, thecelltheatre.org GEORGE COLEMAN QUINTET at Jazz Standard (though Jan. 20, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). Particularly well known for his stint in Miles Davis’s band during the 1960s, this tenor saxophonist uses a lissome, slippery tone to craft melodies of scattered beauty. Now 83, Coleman appears this weekend in a band of straight-ahead jazz stalwarts: Harold Mabern on piano, Yotam Silberstein on guitar, Gerald Cannon on bass and George Coleman Jr. on drums. 212-576-2232, jazzstandard.com KEYON HARROLD at the Blue Note (Jan. 21-23, 8 and 10:30 p.m.). Harrold is technically gifted enough to have recorded the Miles Davis trumpet parts heard on the soundtrack to the 2016 film “Miles Ahead.” He’s also a ruggedly modern thinker, whose own most recent album draws inspiration from radio hip-hop, classic quiet storm, cinematic scores and contemporary jazz. He has long performed in the backing bands for figures like Maxwell, Jay-Z and Rihanna, but these days he is focusing more squarely on his own bandleading career. A native of Ferguson, Mo., Harrold here will perform a program titled “Jazz for Reflection, Protest, Justice and Unity.” 212-475-8592, bluenote.net  INGRID JENSEN QUINTET at the Birdland Theater (Jan. 23-26, 7 and 9:45 p.m.). A trumpeter who’s as versatile as she is vigorous, Jensen released a standout album last year with the tenor saxophonist Steve Treseler. Titled “Invisible Sounds,” it pays tribute to Kenny Wheeler, an influential trumpeter and composer who died in 2014. Jensen and Treseler reinterpret nine of Wheeler’s compositions, which tend to be lyrical and songlike, whether moving at a quick clip or drifting as slowly as cloud cover. Though Jensen is the nominal bandleader for the gigs on Wednesday and Jan. 24, Treseler will also be there; they’ll be joined by Christine Tobin on vocals, Gary Versace on piano, Martin Wind on bass and Jon Wikan on drums. On Jan. 25 and 26, Jensen will revisit the material from her 2003 disc, “Project O,” with the pianist Gary Versace, the bassist Richie Goods and the drummer Jon Wikan. (The tenor saxophonist Joel Frahm will sit in on Jan. 25 only.)212-581-3080, birdlandjazz.com KASSA OVERALL WITH JASON MORAN at the Jazz Gallery (Jan. 18, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). In December, Overall — a drummer, producer and sometime rapper — launched a monthly residency at the Gallery called “Time Capsule.” He is welcoming a different high-profile pianist each month and will record every performance. The resulting tapes will form a capstone product, a hybrid recording that blends chopped-up elements from different performances. (There’s a visual element, too: Overall is collaborating with the artist Nate Lewis, who will create a work to accompany the record.) For this month’s show, Overall welcomes the eminent pianist Jason Moran. 646-494-3625, jazzgallery.nyc MATANA ROBERTS, HALEY FOHR AND SUZANNE LANGILLE at Issue Project Room (Jan. 19, 7 p.m.). In the first show of Issue’s 2019 season, Roberts, an alto saxophonist and multimedia artist, will perform a new work from her continuing series “I Call America,” using video, text and improvised music to address the intersection of societal concerns and personal frustrations. In a separate set, Haley Fohr — best known for her experimental folk outfit Circuit des Yeux — will perform a solo vocal work titled “Wordless Music.” And Suzanne Langille, another singer, will lead a quartet in an exploration of the overlap between vocal and instrumental expression. 718-330-0313, issueprojectroom.orgGIOVANNI RUSSONELLO For an overview of January and February’s cultural events, click here.

MARC COHN at City Winery (Jan. 6, 7:30 p.m.). For those who prefer their rock on the softer side and with a healthy dose of blues, singer-songwriter Marc Cowhn — best known for his hit “Walking In Memphis” — is headlining a near-ideal evening of music. Also performing are John Oates and his Good Road Band, who recently released “Arkansas,” a rootsy album designed in part as a tribute to legendary bluesman Mississippi John Hurt, and then Cohn will get vocal support from legendary harmonists the Blind Boys of Alabama. 212-608-0555, citywinery.com MDOU MOCTAR at Baby’s All Right (Jan. 4, 8 p.m.). The robust rock tradition among the Tuareg people — a Berber group with origins around the southern Sahara — has long been represented internationally by artists like Bombino and Tinariwen. Moctar, a singer-songwriter, offers a subtler, more intimate variation on their desert blues with his most recent album “Sousoume Tamachek.” Translated from the Tuareg dialect in which he sings, the title of the soothing, stripped-down release fittingly translates to something like “calm down.” He’s responsible for every note on the album, layering electric and acoustic guitar, percussion, and singing with mesmerizing results. 718-599-5800, babysallright.com NEW POWER GENERATION at Sony Hall (Jan. 4, 7:30 p.m.). Prince’s backing band for over 20 years, the New Power Generation reunited shortly after his death in 2016. While the Revolution, who are also currently touring, were the primary support for Prince’s 1980s output, the New Power Generation — whose long tenure belied a much less consistent personnel — played behind his 1990s and 2000s compositions and performances. Their setlists span the singer’s career, though, for fans new and old who want to hear Prince’s music in as close to its original form as is still possible live.212-997-5123, sonyhall.com NONAME at Brooklyn Steel (Jan. 5-6, 8 p.m.). Upon first listen, the Chicago rapper’s music sounds laid-back and understated. “I make lullaby rap music,” she explained recently on Twitter, a description as concise and apt as most of her rapid-fire yet still conversational verses. But even though her volume rarely goes above piano, Noname has attitude and depth to spare as she raps over asymmetrical grooves that have a live, unprocessed sound. On her recent full-length debut “Room 25,” there are lines salacious enough to garner their own headlines alongside philosophical manifestos, as on “No Name”: “’Cause when we walk into heaven, nobody’s name’s gonna exist/Just boundless movement for joy, nakedness radiance.” Both shows are sold out, but tickets are available via the secondary market.888-929-7849, bowerypresents.com/brooklyn-steel OZOMATLI at Sony Hall (Jan. 5, 7:30 p.m.). The Los Angeles band’s goal has long been to capture that they see as a melange of genres: cumbia, salsa, rock, hip-hop, reggae and funk. This past year was the 20th anniversary of their self-titled debut album, which earned them a spot opening for Santana on the 1999 “Supernatural” tour. Since, they’ve been among the most reliable purveyors of Latin rock, often foregrounding issues around immigration, social justice and worker’s rights (the band’s members first met while trying to unionize a community center). 212-997-5123, sonyhall.com CL SMOOTH at S.O.B.’s (Jan. 10, 8 p.m.). When the rapper released his best-known single “They Reminisce Over You (T.R.O.Y.)” alongside producer Pete Rock, he was just 23. Over two decades later, the song’s carefully crafted bars and jazz-sampling beat remain etched in hip-hop history, giving its titular reminiscence new meaning. In a recent interview, CL Smooth reflected on how the music has evolved since the duo’s heyday during what’s often called hip-hop’s golden age. “I wouldn’t change anything.”212-243-4940, sobs.com NATALIE WEINER GLOBALFEST at the Copacabana (Jan. 6, 7 p.m.). As always, the 16th annual Globalfest features a broad range of acts from across the world. Highlights this year include the Calcutta-based Pandit Debashish Bhattacharya, who plays Indian ragas on the slide guitar, in a style descended of the sitar; the Cuban mambo revivalists of Orquesta Akokán; and Gato Preto, an electronic duo exploring music from across the African diaspora. All told, the evening boasts performances from a dozen bands across three stages at the Copacabana, one of Manhattan’s most storied nightclubs. globalfest.org CRAIG HARRIS at Nublu 151 (Jan. 6, 7 p.m.). Harris, a trombonist, is celebrating the release of “Brown Butterfly,” an ambitious album paying homage to the legacy of Muhammad Ali. The suite laces gnarled horn arrangements and spoken tributes to Ali over protean rhythms, drawing on influences as varied as Count Basie’s big band and the drum-and-bass of 1990s London; the music emulates the rugged grace and mercurial power of Ali in the ring. Harris’s band includes Kahlil Kwame Bell on percussion, Calvin Jones on bass, Adam Klipple on piano, Tony Lewis on drums and Jay Rodriguez on saxophone. nublu.net CHRISTIAN SANDS at Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola (Jan. 5-6, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). A 29-year-old pianist and bandleader of increasing renown, Sands is aligned with jazz’s straight-ahead mainstream, but he’s got an unbounded inquisitive instinct. He sounds like he listens to Oscar Peterson, Jason Moran and Eddie Palmieri in about equal doses. He performs this Saturday with a quartet including the guitarist Caio Afiune, the bassist Yasushi Nakamura and the drummer David Rosenthal; that group will likely draw heavily from Sands’s most recent album, “Facing Dragons.” On Sunday, he returns with a trio featuring the bassist Luques Curtis and the drummer Terreon Gully. The latter show is a tribute to Erroll Garner; Sands serves as the creative ambassador for the Erroll Garner Jazz Project, a group dedicated to furthering the canonical pianist’s legacy. 212-258-9595, jazz.org/dizzys JEN SHYU AND JADE TONGUE at the Jazz Gallery (Jan. 9, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). A vocalist, poet and movement artist, Shyu is equally devoted to open-ended abstraction and absorptive storytelling. Here she presents “In Healing/Zero Grasses,” a new project with her longstanding group, Jade Tongue, that features a characteristically radical admixture of song, spoken poetry and outré improvisation, all aimed at healing humanity’s relationship with the natural environment. Jade Tongue includes Ambrose Akinmusire on trumpet, Mat Maneri on viola, Thomas Morgan on bass and Dan Weiss on drums. 646-494-3625, jazzgallery.nyc BEN WENDEL HIGH HEART AND KENDRICK SCOTT ORACLE at ShapeShifter Lab (Jan. 6, 7 p.m.). Wendel and Scott are two of the most admired composer-bandleaders among today’s young music students and devotees of jazz’s modern mainstream. Here Wendel, a saxophonist, will present the debut of High Heart, a new acoustic-electric ensemble with the vocalist Michael Mayo, the keyboardists Shai Maestro and Gerald Clayton, the bassist Joe Sanders and the drummer Nate Wood. Scott, a drummer, will perform with Oracle, a vessel for his shimmering, gently propulsive compositions; in its current iteration, the group includes Sanders on bass, John Ellis on saxophone, Taylor Eigsti on piano and Mike Moreno on guitar. shapeshifterlab.com WINTER JAZZFEST (Jan. 4-12). Now in its 15th year, the Winter Jazzfest has never had a more bountiful lineup of contemporary jazz talent. Its beloved weekend marathon — featuring simultaneous shows at venues across Lower Manhattan — will now stretch across two weekends: a “Half Marathon” will set the pace this Saturday, with a fuller, two-night marathon taking place a week later, on Jan. 11-12. In the week between, one-off concerts will be held nearly every night at a variety of venues. Highlights include Sunday’s New York debut of the pianist Arturo O’Farrill’s “Fandango at the Wall,” a suite he first performed at the United States-Mexican border this past spring, with a multinational federation of musicians; and a concert on Thursday with the saxophone luminaries Pharoah Sanders and Gary Bartz performing together. Both of those shows, and many others at the festival, will take place at Le Poisson Rouge. winterjazzfest.comGIOVANNI RUSSONELLO "
5c5af6773a125f5075c084d9,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/06/arts/music/grammy-awards-preview.html,"Year after year, I have dutifully watched the Grammy Awards. And the next morning, year after year, I have wondered why. I’ll be watching on Sunday, when the Grammys air on CBS, but with thoroughly limited expectations. The Grammy show strives each year to keep up with what just happened in music and to ameliorate its past errors. But after a while, blundering along just isn’t funny anymore. Awards shows are thankless at best; there are invariably complaints about omissions and honest disagreements over winners. Meanwhile, the demands of network television are by no means aligned with the dozens of Grammy Awards that recognize music’s less commercial genres along with the grunt work of making recordings. (The vast majority of the 84 Grammys are handed out in a live-streamed ceremony before the prime-time television spectacle, which only squeezes in about a dozen awards between live performances.) This year, the Recording Academy is atoning for an unforced error by its outgoing president, Neil Portnow, who ends his term in July. In 2018, he responded to a question about the lack of women receiving televised awards on the show, in line with harsh statistics about the Grammys’ historical lack of recognition for women, by saying that women need to “step up” — apparently oblivious to systemic barriers for women’s careers, not to mention overt harassment. (He later said he regretted his choice of words.) Sunday’s reparations include having the impeccable Alicia Keys as host and a performance by Diana Ross — who turns 75 on March 26 and who, in Grammy annals, was given a lifetime achievement award in 2012 after exactly zero wins either with the Supremes or in her solo career. Women also dominate the lineup of the show’s other announced performers and are well represented among the nominees for major awards. However, several of those are collaborations with men, like the Bradley Cooper-Lady Gaga duet “Shallow,” Maren Morris’s lead vocal on “The Middle” with Zedd and Grey, and Cardi B with Bad Bunny and J Balvin in “I Like It.” The top categories — record (for the artist, producers and engineers), song (for songwriters) and album of the year, along with best new artist — have also been expanded from five nominees to eight, an easy way for the Grammys to claim more diversity. Selections like those should make the statistics look more equitable in, perhaps, a few decades. Music is the most nimble of mass-audience art forms. Now it can be recorded alone on a computer and released immediately online, and it evolves fast, constantly pulling in ideas from the cultural margins, whether that’s beats from Caribbean sound systems or murky, disconsolate SoundCloud rap. The Grammys’ mandate is to sift through the welter of music released every year, rewarding merit and recognizing innovation (though not, strictly speaking, from the past year, but from the preceding Oct. 1 to Sept. 30, which can make some nominations seem ancient). The Recording Academy, the organization behind the Grammys, was modeled after the Oscars’ Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences: tabulating votes from industry pros, both artists and technicians, presumably to add up to informed choices. But history has not been kind to the Grammys’ winners for album of the year. In 1967, Frank Sinatra’s “A Man and His Music” beat the Beatles’ “Revolver.” In 1985, Lionel Richie’s “Can’t Slow Down” was chosen over Prince’s “Purple Rain,” Bruce Springsteen’s “Born in the U.S.A.,” Tina Turner’s “Private Dancer” and Cyndi Lauper’s “She’s So Unusual.” And last year, Bruno Mars won the top prize over more adventurous albums by Kendrick Lamar, Lorde, Jay-Z and Childish Gambino. Recording Academy voters have been reliably stodgy and ballad-loving, at best befuddled and at worst wrongheaded. It often seems that the Tin Pan Alley holdouts whose Grammy votes regularly pushed back against rock — as late as 1995, when Tony Bennett’s “MTV Unplugged” was album of the year (leading to ridicule and the creation of a “traditional pop” category) — have been replaced by rock holdouts who are still suspicious of hip-hop. The Grammys have recognized undeniable blockbusters by black performers, like Michael Jackson’s “Thriller” and Lauryn Hill’s “The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill.” But they have snubbed paradigm-shifters like Beyoncé’s “Lemonade” (which lost album of the year in 2017 to a more conventional pop megahit, Adele’s “25”). In 2014, Macklemore & Ryan Lewis won best new artist and best rap album over the clearly superior Kendrick Lamar. (Besieged by criticism, the Grammys repented; Lamar has gotten multiple awards and nominations since then, including this year for the “Black Panther” soundtrack album, and he was the show’s incendiary live opening performer in 2018.) The 61-year history of the Grammys is tied to the idea of network TV as a monoculture, and the show once presented a rare chance for millions of people to share a live musical performance. Assured of an audience, the Grammys of yesteryear often presented classical music and jazz — non-popular genres — that have disappeared from more current, metrics-driven iterations of the awards. The show is flashier now, and more determined to offer end-to-end pop-star power. But in the era of on-demand music video and proliferating cable channels, the Grammys have lost any clear role as America’s TV musical centerpiece. And if the initial idea of a prime-time network Grammy show was that multiple generations could share the full spectrum of music, it hasn’t worked out that way. Instead, the Grammys come off as the older generation scolding the young, the entrenched trying to rein in the newcomers. I have long had a rule of thumb that the album that includes the oldest songs wins: Norah Jones’s debut album, Herbie Hancock’s “River: The Joni Letters,” Natalie Cole’s “Unforgettable … With Love,” Eric Clapton’s “Unplugged,” the “O Brother, Where Art Thou?” soundtrack. (This year, Cardi B could benefit from the oldest-song effect; “I Like It” is built on a 1967 Pete Rodriguez boogaloo, “I Like It Like That.”) In recent years, the show has touted unique collaborations, “Grammy Moments,” that try to suggest musical and historical continuity between eras; this year promises Post Malone with the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Too often, though, Grammy Moments have meant fading elders performing alongside up-and-comers who learned their “influences” on the TelePrompTer. The Grammys still have some redeeming features. In the non-prime-time, non-pop categories, a Grammy win can help sustain a career. The broadcast provides glimpses of music history in its lifetime-achievement tributes — its version of community service. And even in an era when musicians play on television from morning shows into late nights, Grammy slots hold a little drama; ask Adele, who was sabotaged by tech ineptitude in 2016. Music-business strategists have long understood that a memorable prime-time performance pays off while award snubs are soon forgotten, and this year’s Grammys should be a bonanza for H.E.R., a slow-burn R&B singer who’s an unexpected contender for top prizes and who will be performing. So yes, I’ll be watching. I’ll even click onto the preshow awards, which will be punctuated by an international lineup of live music including Fatoumata Diawara and Natalia Lafourcade. Just don’t talk to me the morning after. "
5c51bbf63a125f5075c071bf,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/30/arts/music/grammy-awards-music-video.html,"Another year, another persistent worry that the Grammy Awards will once again fail to recognize boundary-pushing black performers. The nominations  are led by Kendrick Lamar, Drake and a crop of female artists — a promising shift after years of complaints about a lack of diversity at the music industry’s big night. However, nominations don’t necessarily turn into wins: Two years ago, Beyoncé was snubbed in the major categories; in 2018, Jay-Z received the most nominations of any artist and walked away empty-handed. But at this year’s ceremony, which will take place Feb. 10, there is one category in which the Recording Academy has nominated a surprisingly sophisticated set of performers, all of whom are black: best music video. (In addition to the artist, this Grammy is awarded to the video’s director and producer.) In the Grammy context, the music video category — No. 83 out of 84 on the official list — is generally an afterthought. It was instituted in 1984, the same year MTV inaugurated its Video Music Awards, just as the medium was becoming central to star-making. At this moment — when artists are as likely to develop their audiences on YouTube as on any audio-only platform, and in which expertise in self-presentation and self-promotion is mandatory — the category feels essential. The nominations recognize clips that shaped conversation as much as the songs they illustrate. Some of these videos are wholesale pieces of art in which the visuals and music are fundamentally inseparable; sometimes the importance of the video itself trumps that of the song. Childish Gambino’s “This Is America” and Joyner Lucas’s “I’m Not Racist” present competing narratives about the state of black life in this country. “Apes**t,” by Jay-Z and Beyoncé (recording as the Carters), is a lush fantasia about dismantling old power hierarchies. Janelle Monáe’s “Pynk” is a wild, psychedelic tour of female amorousness. And Tierra Whack’s “Mumbo Jumbo” serves a strong dose of surrealism. Of these nominees, “This Is America” was the most influential and revelatory last year, a stark, violent, ecstatic and darkly comic statement of intent from Childish Gambino, the musical alter ego of the actor Donald Glover. It was also the first music project from Glover that embodied the tension and savvy of his work in other mediums, particularly the television show “Atlanta.” In the video, Glover saunters, slides, shimmies and bolts his way through a warehouse. His body movements careen from the sensual to the frustrated — he is a performer, a pleaser, but one at war with those impulses, torn between delivering joy and extinguishing it. Sometimes he’s nailing dances from the Instagram Explore page or the video-sharing app Triller, but then he brakes hard, finds a gun and kills fellow performers offering less fraught forms of musical healing. “This is America/Don’t catch you slippin’ up,” he raps, setting terms for negotiating a white society that leaves barely any margin for black error. At the end of the video, as Young Thug sings, “You just a black man in this world/You just a bar code,” Glover runs directly at the camera — first in darkness, only the whites of his eyes and teeth visible. Then he emerges into the light, frantic, no longer in control. This burst of dystopian pessimism has a dim contrast in “I’m Not Racist,” which is almost grotesquely earnest and naïvely optimistic. It, too, takes place in a warehouse, where an aggrieved, bearded MAGA-hat-wearing white man faces off against a skeptical black man. The 30-year-old Massachusetts rapper Lucas (who is black) performs both verses, first from the perspective of the white conservative (with an abundance of racial epithets), and later, from that of the black man who can’t bear to listen anymore. As music, it is onerous agitpop — an egregious case of bothsidesism. As video, it’s unintentionally comic, mawkish passing for sober. Throughout the clip, the tension grows; the white man stands up and hovers over his counterpart, pointing and yelling. Eventually, the black man stands up, flips the table, knocks the MAGA hat off his sparring partner’s head. It seems like there will be resolution, that the guy who insists he’s not racist will finally come to the realization that he is. But then the men face each other and hug, a hilarious conclusion that pretends problems can be solved by simply airing grievances, not addressing them. It feels antiquated and childishly hopeful, as if it had been released in a less tumultuous time — like, say, the early 2010s. Both of these videos are premised on the anxiety that’s born of systemic misunderstanding, confrontation and racism. For a recalibration of that dynamic, there is “Apes**t,” the audacious Jay-Z and Beyoncé video filmed in the Louvre, which proposes that black beauty and creativity belong in museums, too, and that no exclusively white space should remain that way. It is a lavish affair, aesthetically and conceptually, energized by the fact that, on a basic level, the art on the Louvre walls is static, but the performers in the space are not. When a passel of dancers, lying prone atop the Daru staircase, begins to convulse and come to life, it feels like watching birth. Throughout the clip, Beyoncé and Jay-Z hold the screen with intensity and confidence, as natural in this hallowed space as in their home(s). In this, the later stage of their respective careers, engagement with high art has emerged as a crucial signifier, one beyond music, or fashion or other more conventional displays of material wealth. While “Apes**t” doesn’t feel as fully formed or thoughtfully executed as Beyoncé’s “Formation,” which won in this category in 2017, its near-casualness is a loud statement. All three of these videos are designed as provocations of a sort, thinkpiece-bait event releases designed to cut through online clutter. Put out a song on streaming services, and it might be swallowed whole by the ocean. In this crowded climate, creating a vivid video is a survival strategy, especially with no tastemaker outlet (à la MTV) directly promoting/privileging the format. That is how the most effective music videos function today: as time-stopping conversation pieces. But this category also recognizes artists who understand how crucial video is to image formation, and who build it into their output from the earliest stages of their careers. Monáe’s “Pynk” is excerpted from a short film called “Dirty Computer” that accompanied her 2018 album of the same name. Since her early days, Monáe has excelled at character development, and her music functions best as part of an audiovisual whole. “Pynk” is a frothy, playful celebration of sexual openness, straightforward in narrative but inventive in presentation. It was part of a broader story she told last year, in art and in public life, about coming out as queer. The 23-year-old rapper Tierra Whack is a natural visual eccentric and fantastical inheritor of Monáe, as well as of Missy Elliott, Busta Rhymes, the director Chris Cunningham and others. Her excellent 2018 debut album, “Whack World,” was 15 minutes long, one minute per song, and released as one long video full of Whack inhabiting various oddball characters. Strangely, she’s nominated here for “Mumbo Jumbo,” a single that predated that album. Where “Whack World” feels like an extended art project, “Mumbo Jumbo” scans as a micro horror film. Whack is in a dentist’s chair, singing through a mouth retractor. At the end of her surgery, her smile has been exaggerated into an overblown grin. She walks out onto the street, which is as decrepit as Glover’s warehouse, and is surrounded by suffering people saddled with the same false grin — almost an echo of the hollow-eyed sunken place victims in “Get Out.” The song is fine, sort of an extended melodic mumble. But for Whack, perhaps more than any of her fellow nominees, the video is the story. Inventive videos have won in this category before: Janet and Michael Jackson’s “Scream” in 1996, Missy Elliott’s “Lose Control” in 2006, and “Formation.” But more frequently it has gone to the just-fine-enough (or just-expensive-enough) video for an otherwise very popular song, or to an artist so famous (say, the Beatles, in 1997) that Grammy voters tick their box reflexively. But moving forward, this category should be seen as an opportunity to embrace a whole new breed of musician, one who reflects what has long been true but rarely acknowledged at the Grammys: that the job of a recording artist has changed, and that those now making the most vivid impact are as careful about how they look as how they sound.

BIG FREEDIA at Brooklyn Bowl (Jan. 11-12, 11:59 p.m.). The latest EP, “3rd Ward Bounce,” from New Orleans’s best-known bounce ambassador surges with a high-energy vibe, which concertgoers can expect to be in full force at these shows. And the late hour should enhance the performances, loosening the audience’s inhibitions and encouraging people from all backgrounds to twerk to the irresistible rap-dance blend. Bounce has had a notable influence on a number of recent pop hits, including Drake’s “Nice for What” and Beyoncé’s “Formation,” both of which feature Freedia.718-963-3369, brooklynbowl.com KATE BOLLINGER at Trans-Pecos (Jan. 12, 8 p.m.). This singer-songwriter from Charlottesville, who hasn’t yet graduated from the University of Virginia, makes delicate, R&B-tinged pop; her most recent song, “Tests,” sounds like a lullaby, but nearly imperceptible electronic percussion gives it some unexpected flair. She is joined on the bill by two other similarly minded artists, each abstractly confessional with guitars in tow: Caroline Schuck is a local who sings compellingly about  identity crises; Grace Ludmila veers more toward dream pop. The bill’s gritty foil to these three performers is the experimental banjo player Gouox. thetranspecos.com DJ LOGIC at Brooklyn Bowl (Jan. 17, 8 p.m.). Growing up in the Bronx, this turntablist was surrounded by rap’s earliest experiments with jazz via sampling. His music, though, puts the two genres in conversation in a far different way: He uses his turntable as an instrument, going far beyond the flourishes meant to add streetwise flair. Instead, he improvises through spinning, scratching and sampling with bands that span jazz, funk and R&B. On Thursday, he’ll be joined by guests such as the jazz bassist Christian McBride and Living Colour’s Vernon Reid, who has long been his mentor.718-963-3369, brooklynbowl.com LADY MOON & THE ECLIPSE at National Sawdust (Jan. 11, 8 p.m.). There’s a lunar eclipse happening on Jan. 20, so the Brooklyn R&B collective named after that astronomical event is going on tour — a ritual they’ve developed over the past few years. The group specializes in neosoul with a cross-genre bent that manifests through Afrobeat, gospel and funk. The result is charmingly retro, with rich harmonies and an emphasis on live instrumentation. Harsh Armadillo, a funk band from New Hampshire, and the Nigeria-born saxophonist and D.J. Eli Fola open.646-779-8455, nationalsawdust.org MUNYA at Elsewhere (Jan. 16, 8 p.m.). Making nostalgic French pop that isn’t overwhelmingly cloying is a feat in itself, but the Montreal singer-songwriter Josie Boivin, who records under the name Munya, has even more to offer. Her breathy soprano, layers of synths and a band that can go from understated groove to maximalist jam in the space of a chorus merge to create songs that are engaging, even as they create an easy ambience. “I don’t justify/Everything comes and goes,” she sings on “Some More,” lyrics that are reassuringly laissez-faire.elsewherebrooklyn.com SLICK RICK at Brooklyn Bowl (Jan. 11, 8:30 p.m.). The hip-hop legend is hosting what’s billed as his “9th annual” birthday celebration — which means he’s turning 54 on Monday. And his debut, “The Great Adventures of Slick Rick,” reached an important milestone in November: its 30th anniversary. The album includes “Children’s Story,” familiar to most through Montell Jordan’s “This Is How We Do It” and the lyric “Once upon a time, not long ago,” a catchphrase in mainstream hip-hop. Much of his music has had a similarly long tail: Even those who’ve never listened to it will likely hear something familiar.718-963-3369, brooklynbowl.comNATALIE WEINER DARCY JAMES ARGUE’S SECRET SOCIETY at the Jazz Gallery (Jan. 11-12, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). Maybe you’ve heard: New York’s big-band scene is quietly roaring again (not that it ever went completely silent). If you’re trying to find the action, the Gallery is a good place to start, and to understand where a lot of today’s young composer-bandleaders draw their inspiration, Darcy James Argue’s long-running Secret Society ensemble is a good bet. This weekend the sophisticated, space-rock-tinged, 18-piece band will perform works from across its three-disc catalog, as well as some unrecorded numbers. (On Thursday, the Gallery will also host its 12th Jazz Composers’ Showcase, organized by Miho Hazama, with a house big band playing compositions by three young composers.)646-494-3625, jazzgallery.nyc EMMET COHEN TRIO WITH RON CARTER at the Village Vanguard (Jan. 15-20, 8:30 and 10:30 p.m.). Cohen is a young piano virtuoso with a delicate touch and an assured, swaggering swing feel; he has endeared himself to some of the most imposing figures in straight-ahead jazz, and plays in bands led by the bassist Christian McBride and the drummer Herlin Riley. But there may be no living jazz musician with more cachet than Ron Carter, the 81-year-old bassist and National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master — and technically Cohen counts him as a side musician. On the album that Cohen, Carter and the drummer Evan Sherman released in 2018, Carter’s slippery bass and Cohen’s debonair flow are all sorts of simpatico.212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com THEO CROKER at Ginny’s Supper Club (Jan. 11-12, 7 and 9 p.m.). A young trumpeter who’s equal parts insouciance and fleet command, Croker recently unveiled a new ensemble: the Big Brother Big Band. That group will cram onto the stage at Ginny’s on Friday, giving uptown listeners their first glimpse at Big Brother’s soul-and-hip-hop-infused take on the large-ensemble tradition. On Saturday, Croker returns to Ginny’s with a smaller group.212-421-3821, ginnyssupperclub.com ORRIN EVANS QUINTET at Smoke (Jan. 11-13, 7, 9 and 10:30 p.m.). Evans, a daring Philadelphia pianist, is as deeply rooted in bebop tradition as he is versatile and incursive. His Captain Black Big Band (which used to hold down a weekly residency at Smoke) released one of last year’s best large-ensemble records, but he’s equally enthralling as a leader of small groups. Here Evans, 43, presents a quintet featuring powerful players from across generations with the upstarts Josh Lawrence on trumpet and Caleb Curtis on alto saxophone, plus the bassist Ben Wolfe and the drummer Ralph Peterson, both respected veterans in their mid-50s.212-864-6662, smokejazz.com JAZZ AT LINCOLN CENTER ORCHESTRA AND NATIONAL SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA OF ROMANIA at the Rose Theater (Jan. 11-12, 8 p.m.). Wynton Marsalis is Jazz at Lincoln Center’s artistic director and the lead composer for its large ensemble. The New York Philharmonic commissioned him to write a piece it could perform in collaboration with Marsalis’s Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra, and he came up with “The Jungle (Symphony No. 4),” an ode to the urban frenzy of New York City, which premiered in 2016. (It is apparently not a reference to Upton Sinclair’s working-class novel of the same name, which is set in Chicago.) Here the Jazz at Lincoln Center ensemble will perform the work with the visiting National Symphony Orchestra of Romania.212-721-6500, jazz.org JUSTICE IS COMPASSION at Nublu 151 (Jan. 16-21, 7:30 p.m.). Arts for Art, the organization behind the annual Vision Festival and presenters of and advocates for free jazz, is back this year with a souped-up version of this wintertime festival. Started in January 2016, it has become an annual Trump-era tradition for a group committed to strengthening the ties that bind radical music and social justice. This year, the festival has been wisely pared down to six days, and has moved into the nicely outfitted room at Nublu 151, a step up from the small gallery space it formerly used. Things kick off Wednesday night with a trio featuring the bassist Michael Bisio, the trumpeter Kirk Knuffke and the cellist Fred Lonberg-Holm and a quartet including the trumpeter Jaimie Branch and the alto saxophonist Darius Jones. Each subsequent night appears promising; a full schedule is at artsforart.org.nublu.net GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO For an overview of January and February’s cultural events, click here. "
5c609f3e3a125f5075c08fb5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/10/arts/music/grammy-awards.html,"• Our critics and writers weigh in on the best and worst moments of the 61st annual Grammy awards. • At a ceremony dominated by female performers and presenters, Kacey Musgraves won album of the year for “Golden Hour,” as well as three other awards. Cardi B became the first woman to win best rap album as a solo artist for “Invasion of Privacy.” • See the full list of winners and the red carpet looks. • Childish Gambino’s “This Is America” won four awards and Lady Gaga’s “Shallow,” from the movie “A Star Is Born,” won two. • This year’s ceremony was perhaps as notable for who didn’t show up — Kendrick Lamar, Childish Gambino, Ariana Grande — as who did. LOS ANGELES — Women took center stage at the 61st annual Grammy Awards on Sunday night, with bold performances and wins in many top categories, a year after the awards came under withering criticism for its track record in gender representation. The controversies of last year, when just one woman won a solo award during the telecast — and the outgoing head of the Recording Academy, the organization behind the awards, remarked that women in music should “step up” to advance their careers — were never far from the surface of the show. Dua Lipa, a 23-year-old British singer who has established herself as a hitmaker, alluded to that when accepting the award for best new artist, saying she was honored to be recognized among so many other female artists. “I guess this year we really stepped up,” Lipa said. Backstage, she told reporters that the message of greater gender equity was immediately clear to her when the nominations were announced in December. [Read about Michelle Obama joining Alicia Keys onstage.] The award for album of the year went to Kacey Musgraves for “Golden Hour,” a collection that stretched the boundaries of country and drew deep respect from critics. She also took home three other prizes in the country field. “Women have a really necessary perspective — to life, to music,” Musgraves told reporters backstage. “It’s really nice to see that getting a chance to be included.” Many of the awards won by men highlighted the Grammys’ fraught history with hip-hop. Both the record and song of the year prizes — the latter awarded for songwriting — were won by Childish Gambino’s “This Is America,” a thumping, confrontational song about racial injustice. It was the first hip-hop song to win either award. But Donald Glover, the actor and musician who performs as Childish Gambino, was absent. He, along with Kendrick Lamar and Drake, the two most powerful and influential young rappers in music, were offered performance spots on the show but turned them down, reflecting the alienation from the Grammys that has taken hold among much of the upper ranks of hip-hop. Drake was there to accept the award for best rap song, for “God’s Plan” from his blockbuster album “Scorpion.” Before his speech was cut off, he alluded to the gulf between the Grammy establishment and hip-hop culture. “This is a business where sometimes it’s up to a bunch of people that might not understand what a mixed-race kid from Canada has to say or a fly Spanish girl from New York, or a brother from Houston,” he said. “But the point is, you’ve already won if you have people who are singing your songs word for word, you don’t need this right here,” he added, holding up the Grammy. Brandi Carlile, an earnest female singer-songwriter in an Americana style, was the dark horse of the show, getting six nominations — more than any other woman — including in the top categories of album, record and song of the year. She gave a powerful, arena-filling performance of her song “The Joke,” and ended up winning three awards, though none in the top categories. She took best American roots performance and song for “The Joke,” and Americana album for “By the Way, I Forgive You.” They were the first Grammys of her career. Lamar and Drake, the two most-nominated artists — with eight and seven nods, respectively — each won only one. Lamar’s “King’s Dead,” from the “Black Panther” soundtrack, tied for best rap performance with Anderson .Paak’s “Bubblin.” Childish Gambino’s “This Is America” won a total of four awards, including rap/sung performance and best music video. The ceremony began with the 21-year-old singer Camila Cabello performing her song “Havana” on a neon-colored city street scene, joined by a white-suited Ricky Martin, J Balvin and Young Thug. But the first moment of major star power came a few minutes later, when Alicia Keys, the host, introduced “my sisters”: Lady Gaga, Jada Pinkett Smith, Michelle Obama and Jennifer Lopez. Each spoke about the inspiring power of music throughout their lives. Obama, drawing a thunderous welcome from the crowd at the Staples Center, was nearly drowned out as she delivered her lines. “From the Motown records I wore out on the South Side,” she said, “to the ‘who run the world’ songs that fueled me through this last decade, music has always helped me tell my story.” One superstar woman after another performed solo routines, as if they were fleshing out different views of diva-hood. Janelle Monáe performed “Make Me Feel” with bits of inspiration from Prince and Michael Jackson, but focused on female sexuality, surrounded by female dancers in tight rubber outfits. [Messages of inspiration and hope prevailed during the show.] With Cooper absent, Lady Gaga took both parts of “Shallow” herself. Dressed in a black sequined suit and high platform heels, she thrashed on the stage like a 1970s arena rocker, as pyrotechnics announced the song’s climax. Jennifer Lopez led a Motown tribute performed as a Vegas-style revue. She was joined by Smokey Robinson and Ne-Yo, with a medley of about 10 songs jammed into six minutes and featuring gymnastic, bottom-shaking, somersaulting dancing. Cardi B won the first Grammy of her career, best rap album for “Invasion of Privacy.” Holding the hand of her husband, the rapper Offset, she joked about struggling for composure — “Maybe I should start smoking weed!” — before talking about the long nights she worked to finish her album and shoot videos while pregnant. She is the first female solo artist to win in the category. Earlier, she performed “Money” dressed in purple and black like a supervillain, while dancers around her moved and spread their legs in synchronous motion like a bawdy Busby Berkeley sequence. In the audience, Offset stuck out his tongue suggestively. [Never miss a pop music story: Sign up for our weekly newsletter, Louder.] H.E.R., the stage name for the 21-year-old singer and songwriter Gabriella Wilson, led a slow-build version of her ballad “Hard Place.” She won two awards, for R&B performance (in the song “Best Part”) and best R&B album, for her self-titled release “H.E.R.” But when accepting R&B album, she seemed almost baffled that it was eligible. “It’s not even an album,” she said. “It’s an E.P.” Lady Gaga won the first award of the telecast, best pop duo/group performance, for “Shallow,” her duet with Bradley Cooper from their movie “A Star Is Born.” Tearful, she said she wished Cooper were with her — he was in London for the Baftas, the British film awards — and addressed a theme in the film, in which Cooper plays a singer struggling with addiction. “I’m so proud to be part of a movie that addresses mental health issues,” she said. “A lot of artists deal with that and we’ve got to take care of each other.” Diana Ross, appearing in a wide, lacy red gown, celebrated her 75th birthday with two hits from her solo career, “The Best Years of My Life” and “Reach Out and Touch (Somebody’s Hand).” Winding up her performance, she ordered those in the crowd to wave their hands, saying: “Together we have no limits. You can learn, dream, unlock new doors. All is possible.” She ended with, “Happy birthday to me!” Dolly Parton had the most cross-generational appeal, singing a five-song medley with Katy Perry, Kacey Musgraves, Miley Cyrus and Maren Morris that had Smokey Robinson and the K-pop group BTS all dancing and singing along in the crowd. It ended with a nostalgic singalong on “9 to 5” that seemed to pull in the whole arena. Shortly thereafter, Musgraves won her third Grammy of the night — best country album for “Golden Hour” — and gushingly doled out thanks to her manager, the Grammys and her fans. “I never dreamed that this record would be met with such love, such warmth, such positivity,” Musgraves said. [Here’s the full list of Grammys winners.] All but nine of the Grammys’ 84 awards were given out in a nontelevised ceremony that was attended by few of the night’s big stars. Carlile led the preshow portion with her three wins in the American roots category. “Americana music is the island of the misfit toys; I am such a misfit,” Carlile said, accepting the second award. “It is the music that has shaped my life and made me who I am, and even given me my family.” Lady Gaga and Musgraves each had two early wins. Lady Gaga’s “Joanne (Where Do You Think You’re Goin’?),” a piano version of a song first released more than two years ago, took best pop solo performance, and “Shallow” took best song written for visual media. Musgraves won best country solo performance for “Butterflies” and her “Space Cowboy” took best country song. The score for “Black Panther” also won an award for its composer, Ludwig Göransson. [Here’s a look at the Grammys red carpet.] The preshow awards may be invisible to most of the general public, but they can set important benchmarks in the industry, and have the power to reshape careers among artists in genres far beyond pop radio. One barrier was broken with the award for best engineered album, nonclassical, which went to Beck’s “Colors.” Among its winners was Emily Lazar, a studio veteran who became the first woman to win as mastering engineer in that category. “I am so grateful to be one of the people,” she said, “that young women see and they can say: ‘I can see it. I can be it. That’s a cool career, I want to go do that.’” Claudia Brant, a seasoned songwriter for Latin artists who won best Latin pop album for “Sincera,” noted that for all the Grammys’ power, it is the daily studio work that matters the most. “Of course it’s going to change my career, because it’s the biggest recognition I’ve ever gotten,” Brant said. “But tomorrow I’ll have a session in the studio with another artist that’s looking for good songs.” The Grammys missed a chance for another milestone in the producer of the year category. The award went to Pharrell Williams. Had it gone to Linda Perry, she would have been the first woman to take home that award. [Here’s the full list of Grammys winners.] "
5c646f493a125f5075c098a0,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/13/arts/music/ariana-grande-thank-u-next-review.html,"No current pop star is more adept at stoking and channeling swells of online fan curiosity than Ariana Grande. In the past year, she navigated a tumultuous relationship with the comedian Pete Davidson; the death of an ex-boyfriend, the rapper Mac Miller; a public row with the Grammys; and more. In the process, she has become a master of the Easter egg, the clapback, the strategic tweet-and-delete. In the middle of a storm, Grande is cool and collected, hands firmly on the wheel. This comes through in her use of social media, and also in her music and videos. “Sweetener,” an optimistic love-song album released last August, was hot on the heels of her high-octane short-duration romance with Davidson. And the singles leading up to her new album, “Thank U, Next,” aggressively fed the gossip machine, ensuring that just as Grande’s music was reaching its peak popularity, she was also the subject of continuous meta-musical conversation. It is savvy gamesmanship, and an appropriately modern approach to pop superstardom in the age of social media and streaming. And yet that flirtation with tabloid ubiquity is the least interesting aspect of “Thank U, Next,” Grande’s fifth album, which has some hiccups but is still her most musically flexible and au courant release to date. [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] A pure vocal talent who early in her career excelled with songs that gave her singing generous room to breathe, Grande hasn’t always been in close dialogue with the rest of pop music. That has changed now. “Thank U, Next” was reportedly made in around two weeks, and it shows, but in the right ways — there is less deadening polish on the vocal production, and Grande demonstrates a new comfort toying with style and approach. That’s clearest on the album standout, “Bloodline,” which communicates a cruel sentiment — “don’t want you in my bloodline” — with disarming casualness. Produced by the pop hitmaker Max Martin, “Bloodline” has rocksteady breeze, electro sternness and some of Grande’s most in-the-pocket singing. “Thank U, Next” can be split between the songs produced by Martin, both alone and with his regular collaborator Ilya Salmanzadeh, and the rest. The Martin songs are crisp, as always: “Bad Idea” has the urgency and cool of late 1980s pop. “Break Up With Your Girlfriend, I’m Bored” — which includes a riff on ‘N Sync’s most snide anthem, “It Makes Me Ill” — is so bulbous and tart that it sounds jolly. (The other Martin contribution, “Ghostin,” is the album’s only real dud.) It’s in the other songs, however, that Grande takes her most intriguing leaps, largely because of the new fluidity she brings to her singing. As the pop music landscape has shifted to take in the dominance of streaming, it was inevitable that R&B, and also older-fashioned pop, would find their way toward hip-hop. And not in a platitudinous, quick-handshake-while-pinching-your-nose way, but a serious integration — the rhythmic and attitudinal choices that have long been central to hip-hop are becoming essential to artists far outside the genre. And so it has gone for Grande, who has learned to contort her huge voice into the clipped cadences that have defined the hip-hop mainstream over the last couple of years. On “7 Rings,” she’s so convincing with her flow that there was wild disagreement online as to which rapper she was ripping off. (2 Chainz, most likely, but maybe Soulja Boy.) “Fake Smile” takes a different approach to the same idea, opening with the same melancholy soul sample used in the Wu-Tang Clan’s “Tearz”; its rough-hewed urgency is threaded throughout the rest of the song. There are other curious musical choices, as well — the jubilation and saccharine taste of the hook of “NASA” recalls K-pop. And Grande hasn’t totally disconnected from the clarity and spaciousness of her early music, heard here on the pristine “Make Up,” which sounds naïve from a distance but roars with mature desire. That these varying choices all sound comfortable together is the real sign of progress on this album. Its mild disorganization isn’t dissimilar to the direction Rihanna was moving on “Anti.” That was the first moment in which she truly stepped out into uncharted territory, showing off unexpected strengths that had long been hidden. “Thank U, Next” proves that Grande, too, has many other places to roam.

5c93b33b49f0eacbf105e4b8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/21/arts/music/etienne-charles-carnival.html,"EAST LANSING, Mich. — The trumpeter Etienne Charles stood in a Michigan State University classroom on a recent Tuesday evening — about 2,000 miles north and 50 degrees Fahrenheit south of his native Trinidad — and spoke to the undergrad big band that he directs here. The horns were having trouble nailing the inflections on “Chega De Saudade,” the bossa nova standard, so Mr. Charles sang the lines out loud, vocalizing a kind of hand-drum pattern. Then he told the horns to play back their parts, this time with the syncopation sharpened up. “Right now we’re a little too far on the straight side,” he said. Emphatic rhythm has always been the engine oil of a jazz big band, but Mr. Charles has original ways of addressing that history, inherited from his own homeland traditions. His earliest instructors taught primarily by ear, and built from the rhythm up. “Whatever songs we were singing in the choir — whether it was a Caribbean folk song, a chorale, a hymn — we would always learn the lyrics first and then say the lyrics in rhythm. And then after that they would teach us the notes,” he said over lunch at a restaurant near campus earlier that day. “We were always rhythmically on, as a result.” Mr. Charles, 35, has been uniting Trinidadian methods with jazz ideas since he moved to the United States in 2002. He’s found that if you let them, they combine organically. Along the way, Mr. Charles has developed a magnetic sound on trumpet — clear and mellifluous, with a deep sense of economy; redolent of both Roy Hargrove and Chocolate Armenteros — and he’s becoming a composer to be reckoned with. Last year he became the newest member of the SFJAZZ Collective, contemporary jazz’s premier all-star band. On Friday he will release “Carnival: The Sound of a People, Vol. 1,” his most invigorating record yet. It grew out of trips home during Trinidad’s spring Carnival — an annual festival of parades and performances, with deep but still-vital roots in West African tradition. Its dances and songs peer back across centuries, into the years of black indentured servitude, slavery and, ultimately, freedom on the other side of the Atlantic. In making “Carnival,” Mr. Charles brought a recording device along while he immersed himself in the festivities, then wrote a suite of original music. Unlike so much contemporary jazz that’s informed by global traditions, the album retains the atmosphere of restive jubilation that defines the actual event of Carnival. Mr. Charles’s band, featuring some of New York’s ace musicians, sometimes plays the pieces alone. Elsewhere, it accompanies field recordings of Carnival performers that Mr. Charles captured. For the drummer Obed Calvaire, who appears on “Carnival” and also plays in the SFJAZZ Collective, this presented a fruitful challenge. “What was special for me was to try to come up with a groove that fit inside their way of phrasing without interrupting,” he said. He found himself marveling at “some of the ways those percussionists phrase.” Mr. Charles’s recent albums have all been studiously arranged and passionately played, but at times they feel dangerously tidy — as if his rigorous approach has sanded off the tension and weight of the original tradition he’s addressing. On “Carnival,” he gets past that. He’s drawn the rhythms from the source, and left off the varnish. “People ask me how I think about the difference between jazz and Caribbean music, but jazz is Caribbean music,” Mr. Charles said. “When I started writing the music for ‘Culture Shock,’ I thought that there was a difference, and that there was actual integration or fusion going on,” he said, referring to his debut record from 2006. “By the time I got to ‘Creole Soul’” — from 2013 — “I had realized that the diaspora is just one.” “Carnival” opens with a gargle of voices, a honked car horn, the clattering of biscuit pans. You’re hearing the performance group 2001 Jab Molassie playing on the street in Trinidad; they’re soon joined by a jazz septet playing an elastic and almost inebriated melody, folding its energy directly into the pan percussion. In footage captured for a future documentary film, you can see 2001 Jab Molassie’s members, some wearing devil’s horns, covered in blue paint and dancing fiercely in the street. They’re invoking the spirit of Jab Molassie, a mythical slave who was burned to death in a vat of molasses, and whose revenge-seeking spirit is called upon by the pan drumming. On the next two tracks, “Dame Lorraine” and “Moko Jumbie,” the jazz group plays alone, exhibiting a lyrical swagger and tight comportment on pieces inspired by Carnival’s masquerading tradition. Throughout the album, Mr. Charles puts a lot of power in the hands of his percussionists — whether it’s Mr. Calvaire on drum kit or the bamboo and iron percussionists that play on the five-track “Black Echo” suite. He subtly revisits the island’s historical developments along the way: Black Trinidadians took up bamboo percussion for a time in the 19th century after the British banned iron instruments, which are believed to have sacred powers. Mr. Charles was born in Trinidad in 1983, and his musical talent showed early. He entered into calypso competitions at Carnival before he was a teenager, making up songs in the old tradition, usually built around social or political commentary. “For calypsos, you want to have something that’s socially apropos,” he said. “You learn not just how to sing a calypso, but how to study and analyze events.” He added: “What I didn’t know then was, it was teaching me how to write.” He moved to Tallahassee in 2002 to study at Florida State University, where he was mentored by the pianist Marcus Roberts. He hadn’t played much American jazz before enrolling, but he arrived bursting with talent and a professorial, inquisitive instinct. He was a good fit for the music. Somewhere along the line he discovered a 2000 album by the Puerto Rican-born tenor saxophonist David Sánchez, “Melaza,” on which Mr. Sánchez unlooses homeland strategies and rhythms in a heady, contemporary-jazz context. “That record changed my life,” Mr. Charles said. He moved to New York in 2006 (he still remembers the date: August 25) to attend Juilliard’s small, rigorous grad program, and after receiving his degree he spent about a year kicking around the city’s jazz scene. But he was hired to teach at Michigan State soon after, and moved to a colder climate than he had ever thought he could tolerate. In the decade he’s spent on the faculty, he has delved increasingly into research, partly thanks to the scores and field recordings available at Michigan State’s music library. In 2015 he was awarded a Guggenheim fellowship, allowing him to take a few months off from teaching and return to Trinidad to research and write “Carnival.” That was the most time he had spent back there since moving in 2002, but throughout his career he has maintained a connection to the island. He thinks of Trinidad less as a place from which to extract ideas, and more as a homeland that he can, in turn, help enrich. A few years ago he noticed that live brass bands, which had been a central component at Carnival, were on the wane, so he got one together and started leading it in the processions every year. (When we spoke, he had only recently returned from this year’s celebration.) And on any trip home, Mr. Charles said, he tries to teach workshops at schools, prisons and youth-correctional facilities. Based on his experiences there, he’s hoping to establish some way of helping incarcerated musicians find jobs upon their release — perhaps by encouraging hotels to hire more live musicians. “Real, good music needs to get to the people,” he said. “A lot of what’s funneled through the media doesn’t teach people about their power or their freedom. It’s time for that to change.” "
5c61bbe43a125f5075c091df,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/11/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-tourism-music-festival.html,"AL ULA, Saudi Arabia — The new Italian-designed concert hall in the middle of the desert shimmered in the sunset light, its walls of mirror reflecting the golden sandstone hills and cliffs. Inside, a symphony orchestra from China rehearsed a Western classical piece, preparing for a concert featuring the Chinese pianist Lang Lang. The serene and lilting notes floated through the empty hall. The concert was part of a series with performances by Andrea Bocelli, Yanni and Majida El Roumi taking place this winter in Saudi Arabia. From the western desert, Saudi Arabia appears to be a different country than the one that has been under constant criticism from American politicians and other international officials since last October, when Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the 33-year-old de facto ruler, was first accused of ordering the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a Virginia resident and Washington Post columnist. The C.I.A. has since concluded that the Crown Prince was responsible for Mr. Khashoggi’s killing, and its strongest evidence includes intercepted conversations. The Saudi government denies he was involved. Prince Mohammed has also come under international criticism for imprisoning human rights activists and detaining hundreds of people in a hotel, as well as for waging a war in Yemen that has fueled what the United Nations calls the world’s worst man-made humanitarian crisis. But at the same time, officials under his rule are trying to build up Saudi Arabia’s tourism and culture industries by promoting events like the music festival. In past years, an event like this would not have taken place in a remote region of the conservative kingdom. The strategy is in line with Prince Mohammed’s efforts to loosen restrictions on entertainment and expressions of popular culture. In developing a tourism industry, officials are focusing on the ancient caravan town of Al Ula in the Hejaz, a western region that has been a crossroads for traders between Mediterranean empires and ports along the Gulf of Aden. “We call this the place of the future,” said Maher Mazan, a manager at Shaden Resort, a new hotel built among rock canyons outside town, where rooms typically go for $440 per night. “If you come back in one year, it’ll be different.” The area’s rich history and archaeological sites have long captivated King Salman, the crown prince’s father. In 2017, the king established the Royal Commission for Al Ula, with the goal of preserving the striking rock archaeology, despite its pre-Islamic origins, and drawing more tourists. The commission also began looking at holding a concert series. The centerpiece of the area is Mada’in Saleh, or Al Hijr, a collection of more than 100 towering tombs carved into hillsides that take on the glow of burnished gold at sunset. This was the southern reach of the realm of the Nabateans, who carved Petra, the famous sandstone city in Jordan. The tombs date back two millenniums, and many Saudis believe them to be cursed, the abode of jinn. Nearby is a preserved station of the defunct Hejaz Railway, an Ottoman-era line built by German and Turkish engineers. By 1908, it ran 800 miles from Damascus to Medina. One afternoon, a guide led a group of foreign visitors by car first to the train station, then to the Nabatean tombs. A guide, Mohammed al-Anzi, said the region had been dominated in ancient times by four different civilizations. Some people had migrated here from Greece, he said, pointing to a carved eagle above a doorway. “Later, the Romans destroyed the Nabateans,” he said. “Civilizations come, civilizations go. This is life, since the beginning of life.” Among the tourists was a Chinese-British couple who gaped at the structures and took photographs and video to post to a Chinese travel website. Walking into one tomb, they asked about three burial niches. Mr. al-Anzi said the custom then was to wrap the dead in animal skins and adorn them with jewelry. Driving out of the area, the tourists noticed abandoned mud-walled homes. “The people were asked to move after this was designated Saudi Arabia’s first World Heritage Site,” Mr. al-Anzi said, referring to a label given by a United Nations agency. The timeless and austere wonders of Mada’in Saleh contrast with the luxury trappings of the music festival, Winter at Tantora. As of early February, at least 30,000 people total had attended the festival’s weekend events, officials said. The festival began Dec. 20 and ends Feb. 23, after being extended two weeks. Hussein Ibish, a scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington, said the entertainment piece of Prince Mohammed’s vision “is very large, and constitutes the revolutionary reintroduction of ‘fun’ to a society in which public entertainments have been basically eliminated for decades.” But because this plan involves exchanges with the West, that creates a conundrum, Mr. Ibish said. “While you are unleashing socially liberalizing and economically modernizing forces that call on, and appeal to, the West — and which must appeal to the West — you’re trying to contain that with a political crackdown that is completely unacceptable and alienating to most Western audiences,” he said. Winter weekends at Al Ula revolve around the concerts, held on Fridays. There are sometimes other notable events, like hot-air balloon rides. The Winter at Tantora website advertises a range of packages for each weekend. All are expensive. For the weekend of the Yanni concert, the prices ranged from $1,400 for a day-trip package (round-trip flight from Jeddah or Riyadh, the capital, included) to $6,000 for a “diamond” weekend package — prohibitive costs for many Saudis. Pop-up restaurants with outdoor seating open among the canyons on weekends. There is a version of Salt, a popular burger restaurant in Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, and Nozomi, a Saudi-run sushi-and-burger restaurant. The visitors sometimes meet local residents of Al Ula in a weekend tourist market, next to the mud homes of the ancient quarter. The festival “has allowed the people of Al Ula to proudly show their home to the world,” said Abdullah al-Khelawi, the royal commission’s head of economic development. He added that the festival provided seasonal work to 1,000 locals. The headquarters of the royal commission, which runs the festival, are in Riyadh, where 100 full-time employees work. “This can start a tourism industry,” said a local driver, Saleh al-Bilawi, 25, who had recently studied criminal justice at an American university. “They employ a lot of drivers just for the winter festival alone.” Mr. al-Bilawi and his colleagues are aware the work is only temporary. Another driver, Faisal, also a university graduate, said he was paid $36 per day and worked only on weekends, but was grateful for the job. The royal commission and the French government have agreed to send 300 to 1,000 local residents to France for training, mostly in the hospitality industry. In September, the first 68 students arrived at Campus France, a French agency, 32 of them women. On Jan. 31, tourists began flying in for the concert by Mr. Bocelli, who was to perform the next night. Most appeared to be wealthy Saudis, although there were some foreign residents of the country, too. The few coming from outside had managed to get tourist visas with the royal commission’s help; Saudi Arabia generally does not give out such visas. A good number of the visitors appeared to be guests of the commission, which was paying their way. An Italian couple sitting in a restaurant at a farm said they had come to Saudi Arabia at the urging of their friend, the Italian ambassador in Riyadh. “We want to see the country before it is affected by the Western world and looks the same as everywhere else,” said Cinzia Chiari, dressed in black robes. “I hope the Saudis realize their treasure and beauty is in its distinct heritage.” "
5c753a1549f0eacbf105a33a,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/26/arts/dance/les-arts-florissants-rameau-maitre-a-danser-bam.html,"“A week ago I was dancing a bourrée,” the conductor William Christie said over the phone from Paris, where his baroque ensemble, Les Arts Florissants, is based. “A group of us sang a little song around the fire, and we all danced.” This impromptu dance erupted at the inauguration of a 17th-century fireplace in a house in the Loire that’s part of a complex where the Fondation Les Arts Florissants now resides. But it could almost describe a moment in the program his ensemble is bringing to the Brooklyn Academy of Music this week under the title “Rameau, Maître à Danser.” These works, too, were written to celebrate happy events — in one case, the birth of a king — and involved singing and dancing, in equal measure. The French court loved to dance, a passion that can be traced to Louis XIV, an avid dancer and a supporter of the creation of the Royal Academy of Dance, where the basic positions and movements of ballet were first codified. “Everyone danced in France,” the Baroque dance specialist Catherine Turocy said in a phone interview from her home in Dallas. “The singers danced, the dancers sang, and everyone played instruments. In that sense it was more like today’s musical theater.” All the 17th- and 18th-century French opera forms included dance, from the solemn tragédie lyrique to the lighter opera-ballets, the loose genre to which the works of “Rameau, Maître à Danser” belong. “Daphnis et Eglé” and “La Naissance d’Osiris” were composed for the court of Louis XV, to be performed at the palace of Fontainebleau, where the royal family (and much of the aristocracy) retired each fall in to enjoy the hunt. The two operas were performed in successive seasons — 1753 and 1754 — and seldom since, which is why Mr. Christie decided to revive them in 2014, on the 250th anniversary of the composer’s death. (The Brooklyn Academy’s production is the show’s American premiere.) Each about 45 minutes long, neither of the two works would have taxed the attention of the aristocratic audience with complicated plots or deep subjects. “The plots are essentially nonexistent,” Mr. Christie said. “It’s just exquisitely beautiful music, tender and melancholy, and fabulous for dancing.” There is just a whisper of a plot or, more accurately, a dramatic situation. In “Daphnis et Églé” (1753), a shepherd and a shepherdess approach the Temple of Friendship, only to be turned away, because, as Cupid points out to them, they are actually in love. In “Osiris,” shepherds and shepherdesses (notice a theme) await the birth of the god Osiris. (The piece, called a “ballet allégorique,” was meant to echo the birth of the future Louis XVI.) “It was my idea to make the two works into one story,” the director, Sophie Daneman explained from London, where she lives. “I thought, gosh, they’re very similar: They’re both incredibly pastoral, and in that sense, very human.” While the musical values of the Arts Florissants ensemble are faithful to what is known of the historical style, the dancing, like the staging, is more fluid. “There are elements and suggestions of period style,” Mr. Christie said, “but this has nothing to do with pure period staging.” Ms. Daneman noted that Mr. Christie “doesn’t have a strong philosophy on whether something should be ‘authentic.’ He’s more interested in authenticity of spirit.” In this spirit, the dances are not meant to replicate Baroque styles, though they do make reference to their vocabulary of small jumps, elegant footwork and decorative wrists. Originally choreographed by Françoise Denieau, who died in 2015, the dances are being restaged for this run by her assistant, Gilles Poirier. “For the most part,” Mr. Poirier said from Paris, Ms. Denieau “wanted to use a slightly later style of dance, closer to Noverre,” the ballet master who taught Marie Antoinette and the 19th-century Danish choreographer August Bournonville. (Bournonville enthusiasts will immediately spot the buoyant style.) She even included a moment that is closer to something like contemporary dance, using expansive and stylized gestures that Noverre could not have imagined. “Françoise wanted that part to be in a style that was more undefined,” Mr. Poirier said, “neither classical nor contemporary” as a way to evoke timelessness. In Ms. Daneman’s reimagined staging, the dancers and singers occupy the same world, taking turns at the center of the action. There are times when the dancers and singers interact, communicating through shared glances or touch. Mr. Christie conducts the ensemble of period instruments from the back of the stage, close to the singers and dancers. At one point, a musician becomes part of the action: A French bagpipe player slowly traverses the stage, surrounded by the entire cast. This leads into the final number, a contredanse, the French version of English country dancing. The dancers and singers form concentric circles, executing simple steps, weaving in and out. As in Mr. Christie’s celebratory bourrée by the fireside, everybody dances. Everybody sings. "
5c33ce4b3a125f5075c033be,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/07/arts/globalfest-world-music-copacabana.html,"They showed up in Mardi Gras headdresses, fedoras and tutus paired with combat boots. They drummed on darbukas, djembes and congas. And many of the performers at Sunday’s GlobalFest also brought grievances with them along with their costumes and instruments: against occupation, the erasure of indigenous voices, walls. GlobalFest, which took over the Copacabana nightclub near Times Square for the first time this year, is an annual showcase of music from all corners of the earth. This year 12 acts performed overlapping sets on three stages in what proved a joyful and often raucous celebration of diversity and culture’s uncanny knack for slipping through borders and stretching out roots underneath walls. As such, the festival is an inherent act of defiance against any attempt to cement hierarchies. At the same time, it complicates the notion of identity politics by demonstrating the composite nature of style. While the musicians’ art was always fueled by tradition, their distinct sounds were almost invariably shaped by the clash — or serendipitous kiss — of difference. Sometimes it was the fusion of geographically far-flung styles that yielded new musical alloys. Indian ragas took on a flirtatious shimmer in the hands of Debashish Bhattacharya, who infused them with strains of Flamenco and Hawaiian music and performed them on a new breed of Indian slide guitar of his own devising. The result was a heady mix of languid Polynesian sounds caffeinated by the rhythmic fireworks of the tabla of Subhasis Bhattacharya, Debashish’s brother. The members of 47Soul are drawn from the Palestinian diaspora, but the group’s musical roots reach even wider, encompassing Middle Eastern dabke drumming, fuzzy synth beats and reggae to eminently danceable effect. Politics are never far from the surface in lyrics that speak of dispossession and in the label — “Shamstep” — the band has given its music, which voices dreams of Arab unity across the Levant. In fact, new labels were often needed to capture new hybrids: “Southern Gothic.” “Freak cabaret.” “Afropsychedelic.” “Afrofuturist global bass” is how the members of Gato Preto describe their combustible blend of rap, funk and Senegalese drumming. The band is fronted by the explosively charismatic Gata Misteriosa, from Mozambique, who teamed up with the Ghanaian-German producer Lee Bass and Moussa Diallo, an incandescent djembe master from Senegal. Their set had a steamy carnival energy, with the relentless drive of the machine-made pulse amplified by heart-quickening flurries of live drumming. Pulses were also set racing by BCUC, a South African group that brings punk-rock energy and hypnotic rhythms to social activism, and by the Orquesta Akokán, a Cuban-American big band uniting dazzling talent and midcentury polish in simmering mambos. A very different spell was cast by Amythyst Kiah — a self-described “Southern Gothic” singer of “alt-country blues” — who gave a standout performance in the evening’s only solo act. Her razor-sharp guitar picking alone guarantees her a place among blues masters, but it’s her deep-hued voice that can change on a dime from brushed steel to melted toffee that commands attention. In performance she comes across as both uncompromising and generous. She introduced a song, the traditional “Darling Cora,” by pointing out its shared roots in English and West African folk. When she sang it, accompanying herself on banjo, the instrument’s dry warmth seemed to carry echoes of the African stringed kora. Jeremy Dutcher, a Canadian who is a member of a Wolastoq community in New Brunswick, showed that artistic dialogue can be just as fruitful when conducted, not across cultures, but between generations. Mr. Dutcher, who won the coveted Polaris Music Prize last year, draws on wax cylinder recordings from the early 1900s of songs in Wolastoqiyik — a language that is now in danger of extinction. His lyrical compositions layer the ghostly frayed voices of his ancestors with jazzy arpeggios on the piano, keening cellos lines and arching phrases sung in his own voice, which is powered by classical training and colored here and there by the tremor and guttural catch of traditional chant. Classical strains also filtered into the elegant set by Magos Herrera, a Mexican vocalist with a feline, smoky voice, who teamed with the string quartet Brooklyn Rider and the percussionist Mathias Kunzli for her new album “Dreamers.” Her songs are drawn from across Latin America, united by delight in melody and storytelling, supported by the string quartet as it seamlessly morphs from rhythm section to silver-screen swooning. And classical instruments appeared — and were sometimes abused — in what was perhaps the most extraordinary show of the evening. Dakh Daughters is born out of Kiev’s theater scene and features seven women who bring equal parts musical and theatrical chops to performances that are witty, subversive and brash. Dressed in tutus and combat boots with their faces painted white, the Daughters stalked the stage like conquerors taking possession of an alien territory. Texts (in Ukrainian, English and French) were delivered in shouts, hisses and yelps, with the voices sometimes coming together in exquisitely vocalized folk harmonies. Individually, the voices belonged to wildly disparate worlds including heavy metal, punk, and the glassy plangency of Balkan folk singing. They handled instruments like found objects: a violin propped against a hip, a cello tilted at a rakish angle. The bassist mostly drew sound from her instrument by spanking it; the drummer stomped the foot pedal of her bass drum as if it were vermin. A signature song of the Daughters is “Rozy/Donbass,” referring to a region contested by Russia, once known to Ukrainians for its rose gardens. It begins with a mournful setting of lines by Shakespeare delivered almost mechanically, with shouts of “Donbass” flung out with raw aggression. Eventually the music takes on a ritualistic whirl until it screeches to a halt with just the word “rozy” — roses — intoned as if by zombies. The song, like the Daughters’ performance, is darkly seductive and alienating at once — a powerful expression of the tensions endured by women in conflict zones, and a reminder that identity often means fighting on multiple battle lines.

Port Illustrated. 340 pp. Scribner. $28. Like a lot of paradigm-shifting inventions, the solid-body electric guitar seems inevitable in hindsight. Someone was bound to realize that a steel string could be hugely amplified by a magnetic pickup and an external speaker, blasting an electronic signal. Someone was bound to come up with a design that felt familiar and comfortable to a working musician. And someone would certainly figure out how to manufacture the instrument as an affordable mass-market commodity. But the actual advent of the solid-body electric guitar, sometime in the 1940s, was a tangled tale of tinkerers, craftsmen, musicians and businessmen who hardly realized what they had unleashed. In “The Birth of Loud,” Ian S. Port, a critic and guitarist who was the music editor for The San Francisco Weekly, has sorted out the facts of the electric guitar’s much-mythologized genesis and cultural conquest. He turns them into a hot-rod joy ride through mid-20th-century American history. With appropriately flashy prose, he dismantles some misconceptions and credits some nearly forgotten but key figures. He also summons, exuberantly and perceptively, the look, sound and sometimes smell of pivotal scenes and songs. Port frames his scrupulously sourced narrative with two thoroughly disparate characters who converged on the same idea and have archetypal guitars bearing their names: Les Paul and Leo Fender. “Their personalities and worlds were as far apart as any in music could be: One’s arena was primarily the stage, the other’s, the workbench,” Port writes. Clarence Leo Fender was a perpetually rumpled, unassuming, self-taught radio repairman, an intuitive engineer and non-musician who decided to build guitars and amplifiers. “His enjoyment of the instrument,” Port writes, “stemmed from the precise pattern of harmonics produced by its strings. Where others heard music, Leo Fender heard physics.” Lester Polsfuss, a.k.a. Les Paul, was a world-class guitarist and self-promoting showman who was also a technological visionary, fascinated by electronics and studio production. “Les Paul wrestled with the knowledge that even being a virtuoso on the guitar would not bring the fame he craved,” Port writes. “Les now began to see his guitar playing as one element in a larger project: a whole new sound that would combine his brilliant musicianship, the pure electric guitar tone he wanted, and radical new recording techniques he envisioned.” The electric guitar was no single individual’s invention. Amplified guitars had appeared in the early 1930s, when companies including Gibson and Rickenbacker put pickups inside acoustic guitars to play them through amplifiers. Yet beyond a certain volume, amplified sound waves bouncing around inside a traditional guitar’s hollow body would create screaming feedback. But that problem had been solved by a different instrument: the Hawaiian or steel guitar, distilled down to just strings, a neck and pickups heard through an amplifier. They were played horizontally, as a lap steel guitar, or built into a tabletop with pitch-shifting pedals as country music’s pedal steel guitar. Concentrating on Fender and Paul, Port mentions but doesn’t explore the groundbreaking solid-body lap steel guitar sold by Rickenbacker in the early 1930s or other short-lived, solid-body six-string guitar progenitors. In the mid-1940s, Fender turned his radio repair shop into the Fender Electric Instrument Company, manufacturing steel guitars and amplifiers. Both he and Paul had been thinking about a solid-body electric guitar. Les Paul built one for himself in 1940 out of a 4-by-4 plank and an existing guitar neck. He called it “the Log,” performed with it (adding the sides of a guitar body) and brought it to the Gibson company in the early 1940s as a potential product. “After Les left,” Port writes, “the managers chortled among themselves about that crazy guitar player who wanted Gibson to build a broomstick with pickups on it.” In 1943 Fender and a collaborator put pickups on a solid oak plank and shaped it like a narrow little guitar. They built only one rough model, but for years they rented it out steadily to local musicians who loved the amplified sound. It was, Port writes, “a misfit stepchild of a guitar that extended creative expression past what any other standard model allowed.” Neither Fender nor Paul got past his prototype until the 1950s. While Fender struggled to keep his existing factory in business, Paul was thriving as a musician, backing Bing Crosby and others. Paul had turned his Hollywood garage into a home studio: a magnet for musicians and a place to experiment with recording technique. At Les Paul’s studio, Fender, Paul, and a designer and meticulous custom-instrument craftsman named Paul Bigsby brainstormed a solid-body guitar, consulting with musicians. One was the country music star Merle Travis, a Bigsby client. Travis dared the designer to build him a thin, solid-body electric, sketching it in detail. Bigsby built it in 1948. Fender studied it, but knew it was too luxurious. He came up with something simpler, eliminating fine woodworking and its sculptural glued-on neck; his neck was bolted on and easily replaceable, for a guitar that could be manufactured, affordable and practical. “This was the leap from classical design to modernism; from the age of walnut to the age of celluloid; from the America of brick-and-iron cities to the America of stucco-and-glass suburbs,” Port writes. Fender unveiled a solid-body six-string in 1950 and was backlogged with orders by 1951. That was the year Paul’s pop career skyrocketed. In a duo with his wife, the singer and guitarist Mary Ford, Paul used his multitrack studio to create giddy, futuristic, chart-topping versions of standards like “How High the Moon.” The venerable Gibson company had quietly been developing its own solid-body guitar, with a more elegant shape, advanced pickups and smoother sound than the twangy Fender Telecaster. Although Paul didn’t design it — a myth Gibson cultivated — he tweaked it slightly and lent his mad-scientist credibility to the Les Paul Model, Gibson’s first solid-body electric guitar. Meanwhile, Fender came up with the Stratocaster, a curvy, seductive shape contoured to a player’s body. The competition was on, joined by other companies. Leo Fender had another far-reaching idea, introduced in 1952: an electric bass guitar that was far more portable, louder and crisper than a classic bass fiddle. And as rock ’n’ roll took over popular music, he met the demand for bigger, louder amps — including one that deafened him in one ear while he was repairing it for the surf-rock guitarist Dick Dale — and for effects, like reverb, that separated the electric guitar even further from its acoustic ancestors. Musicians took it from there. Electric guitars increasingly defined rock ’n’ roll, driving out pianos and horn sections. Guitarists cranked up and dirtied up the clean, warm sounds that Fender and Paul had tried to engineer; Jimi Hendrix embraced feedback with a vengeance. (His 1969 Woodstock Festival rendition of “The Star-Spangled Banner” gets its own, climactic chapter of Port’s book.) The synergy of guitars, amplifiers and effects spawned new idioms, while manufacturers’ profits rose and fell with hit makers’ equipment choices. The latter part of “The Birth of Loud” juxtaposes breakthroughs by musicians — Muddy Waters, Eric Clapton, Hendrix, the electric bass players Carol Kaye and James Jamerson — with the up-and-down individual and corporate fortunes of Fender and Paul. Fender sold his company in the mid-1960s, but kept tinkering with other companies. Paul saw his pop style eclipsed by rock ’n’ roll and his namesake Gibson model discontinued, only to have his guitar resuscitated by British blues-rockers and his playing eventually cherished by jazz fans. In the digital era, guitars no longer rule popular music. Port recognizes that Paul left another, perhaps larger legacy: He was “the first player to claim the studio as an instrument, a move so common today that we often forget to remark on it. Les aimed to control not only the music that went onto the canvas of recorded sound, but everything about the canvas itself: the framing, the immaculateness of the background, the depth and layering of the sounds, and where it hung on the viewer’s wall.” But “The Birth of Loud” rightfully celebrates an earlier time, when wood, steel, copper wire, microphones and loudspeakers could redefine reality. Tracing material choices that echoed through generations, the book captures the quirks of human inventiveness and the power of sound. "
5c78116e49f0eacbf105aae2,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/28/obituaries/andre-previn-dead.html,"André Previn, who blurred the boundaries between jazz, pop and classical music — and between composing, conducting and performing — in an extraordinarily eclectic, award-filled career, died on Thursday at his home in Manhattan. He was 89. His death was confirmed by his manager, Linda Petrikova. Mr. Previn wrote or arranged the music for dozens of movies and received four Academy Awards, and was nominated for three Oscars in one year alone — 1961, for the scores for “Elmer Gantry” and “Bells Are Ringing” and the song “Faraway Part of Town” from the comedy “Pepe.” Audiences knew him as well as a jazz pianist who appeared with Ella Fitzgerald, among others, and as a composer who turned out musicals, orchestral works, chamber music, operas and concertos, including several for his fifth wife, the violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter. He was also the music director or principal conductor of a half-dozen orchestras. [Listen to the full range of Mr. Previn’s multifaceted career.] Critics described Mr. Previn as a “wunderkind in a turtleneck” and the “Mickey Mouse maestro” when he was in his 20s and 30s. He was often compared to Leonard Bernstein, a similarly versatile conductor, composer and pianist. Time magazine’s headline when Mr. Previn became the principal conductor of the London Symphony in 1968 was “Almost Like Bernstein.” Newsweek summarized his appointment as music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic in 1985 as “Bernstein West.” And like Bernstein, Mr. Previn was no stranger to a life of glamour and media attention, particularly when the actress Mia Farrow left Frank Sinatra, her husband, and married Mr. Previn after an affair that had become grist for the gossip columns. “See you in the Morning beloved Friend,” Ms. Farrow, who was divorced from Mr. Previn in 1979, tweeted on Thursday. “May you rest in glorious symphonies.” Mr. Previn himself considered Bernstein an idol. “Bernstein has made it possible not to specialize in one area of music,” he said. “You no longer have to do just Broadway shows, or movies, or conduct — you can do any or all of them.” And Mr. Previn did. In the 1960s, he appeared in sold-out classical and jazz concerts. Sometimes he combined genres, playing a concerto before intermission and jazz with a trio after. Dizzy Gillespie marveled at his performances. “He has the flow, you know, which a lot of guys don’t have and won’t ever get,” he said. Mr. Previn made recordings with Benny Carter and Mahalia Jackson and an album of jazz arrangements of songs from “My Fair Lady” with the drummer Shelly Manne and the bass player Leroy Vinnegar. (Mr. Previn was later the conductor and music supervisor for the film version of “My Fair Lady.”) He also made two albums with Dinah Shore and recorded a collection of Christmas carols with Julie Andrews and George Gershwin’s “Rhapsody in Blue” with Andre Kostelanetz. But the classical world was never comfortable with his work in jazz, and the jazz historian Ted Gioia said Mr. Previn had been “something of a popularizer of jazz rather than a serious practitioner.” Mr. Previn disdained all the labels. “I never considered myself a jazz musician,” he said in 1986, “but a musician who occasionally played jazz.” He was born Andreas Ludwig Priwin on April 6, 1929, in Berlin. After his parents realized he had perfect pitch — his father had been an amateur pianist in Berlin — André entered the Berlin Conservatory when he was 6. His father, Jacob, a Polish-born lawyer who was Jewish, moved the family to Paris in 1938 to escape the Nazis. While in Paris, Mr. Previn later recalled, he had some lessons with Marcel Dupré before the family left for Los Angeles about a year later. There, he studied with the composer and conductor Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco, the violinist and composer Joseph Achron and the composer Ernst Toch. He soon recorded all the four-hand piano music of Mozart with the composer Lukas Foss, who was not quite seven years older than Mr. Previn. Mr. Previn became an American citizen in 1943, and in 1950 he was drafted into the Army and served with the Sixth Army Band. He also studied conducting in San Francisco with Pierre Monteux, whom he later followed at the London Symphony. A relative worked in the music department at Universal Studios, and Mr. Previn wrote music for movies even before he went into the Army. As a senior in high school, he was called in to help with “Holiday in Mexico,” a 1946 MGM musical starring Walter Pidgeon. (A young Fidel Castro was an extra.) The script called for the concert pianist Jose Iturbi to play some jazz, but he was uncomfortable improvising and wanted a score to read. Mr. Previn went to a jam session, listened and wrote out a piano part for Mr. Iturbi to play when the cameras rolled. MGM took notice and hired Mr. Previn to compose and conduct the music for “The Sun Comes Up,” starring Lassie and the once-illustrious actress Jeanette MacDonald, who was allergic to dogs. “Go figure that billing,” he once said. Years after its premiere in 1949, he gave the movie a thumbs-down. “Like all Lassie pictures,” he said, “there was hardly any dialogue, but a lot of barking. I thought it was easy, but I have since put myself through the wringer of watching it on a television rerun, and it’s the most inept score you ever heard.” But front-office executives realized that Mr. Previn could handle the deadlines that went with studio work, and they put him on what he called “an endless stream of cheap, fast movies.” Not all his assignments fit that description. He collected Oscars for scoring “Gigi” (1959), “Porgy and Bess” (1960), “Irma La Douce” (1964) and “My Fair Lady” (1965). He did not write classic songs like “Summertime” and “I Could Have Danced All Night”; rather, he arranged and orchestrated them, creating the soundtrack versions. Like Bernstein, Mr. Previn also tried Broadway. With Alan Jay Lerner, he wrote “Coco,” a musical about the designer Coco Chanel that starred Katharine Hepburn and ran for 329 performances in 1969 and 1970. He also wrote the music for “The Good Companions,” a musical with lyrics by Johnny Mercer that ran for 252 performances in London in 1974. Also like Bernstein, Mr. Previn was a crowd-pleaser as a conductor. Five years after his surprise appointment in London, the British magazine New Statesman complained that he had given the orchestra “a strong American accent: the big-screen sound, rich, loud and brilliant.” But it said his programs on the BBC — which prefigured by a few years the American public-television series “Previn and the Pittsburgh,” broadcast when he was the music director of the Pittsburgh Symphony — had “clearly widened his box-office appeal.” “Whereas Boulez looks boring and Boult looks bored,” the magazine said, referring to the prominent conductors Pierre Boulez and Adrian Boult, “Previn always seems to be enjoying himself.” He remained principal conductor of the London Symphony until 1979; he was also the principal conductor of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra from 1985 to 1988. In the United States, he held the Pittsburgh job from 1976 to 1984 right before taking over in Los Angeles. Mr. Previn resigned the Los Angeles post in 1989, complaining that the orchestra’s managing director, Ernest Fleischmann, had maneuvered to bring in Esa-Pekka Salonen as his successor. “It has become obvious to me that there is no room for a music director,” Mr. Previn said when he quit. Mr. Salonen was named music director-designate a few months later. As he approached 70, Mr. Previn turned to opera, writing “A Streetcar Named Desire” to a libretto by Philip Littell based on the Tennessee Williams play. Renée Fleming sang the role of Blanche DuBois in the premiere with the San Francisco Opera in 1998, with Mr. Previn on the podium. Bernard Holland, reviewing the performance for The New York Times, wrote that “it sings very well.” “There are angry clashes of harmony and key,” he added, “many Straussian gestures, sweet-as-honey popular melody and the kinds of corporate noodling and mumbling among the strings native to a Ligeti or a Penderecki.” A recording with the San Francisco cast won the Grand Prix du Disque. Mr. Previn also won 10 competitive Grammys from 1958 to 2004, divided evenly between classical and nonclassical categories, and a lifetime achievement Grammy in 2010. The second of his two operas was “Brief Encounter” (2007), with a libretto by John Caird based on Noël Coward’s screenplay for the 1945 David Lean film by that name. Toward the end of his life, Mr. Previn seemed surprised at the interest in his compositions. ”I wrote a string quartet that I very diffidently mentioned to the Emerson Quartet,” he told the critic David Patrick Stearns in 2017. “And they said, ‘Where is it?’ I’m not used to that.” In 2017, Ms. Fleming gave several performances of a song cycle he wrote, “Lyrical Yeats.” “These brief songs display Mr. Previn’s keen ear for the telling detail, for musical gestures that set a mood or conjure an image,” Corinna da Fonseca-Wollheim wrote in The Times when Ms. Fleming sang them in a solo recital at Carnegie Hall. In 2018, Ms. Mutter played “The Fifth Season,” for violin and piano, which she and Carnegie Hall had commissioned. She described it as “rather lighthearted.” This year, Tanglewood had planned events to celebrate Mr. Previn’s 90th birthday, including a performance of the violin concerto “Anne-Sophie” with Ms. Mutter and, with Ms. Fleming and the Emerson quartet, the premiere of “Penelope,” by Mr. Previn and the playwright Tom Stoppard. Tanglewood said the events would now be framed as a celebration of his life and work, although it was not immediately clear if Mr. Previn had finished “Penelope.” Mr. Previn wrote several books, including “Orchestra” (1979), a depiction of the lives of orchestral musicians, and a memoir of his movie experiences, “No Minor Chords: My Days in Hollywood” (1991). Mr. Previn’s first wife, Betty Bennett, was a singer he had seen in San Francisco jazz clubs. They had two daughters, Claudia and Alicia, also known as Lovely (who became a violinist in the Irish band In Tua Nua), and divorced in 1958. His second marriage was to Dory Langan, an MGM lyricist, who, after they separated, recorded several albums as a singer-songwriter under the name Dory Previn, many of them reflections on their breakup and its aftermath. Dory Previn died in 2012. Their divorce in 1970 was prompted by the well-publicized affair between Mr. Previn and Ms. Farrow, who had been a friend of Ms. Previn’s. Ms. Farrow divorced Sinatra in 1968 and married Mr. Previn in 1970. They had three children, Matthew and Sascha, who were twins, and Fletcher. They also adopted three daughters: Summer Song, known as Daisy; Soon-Yi, who married Woody Allen in 1997; and Lark, who died in 2008. Mr. Previn’s fourth wife was Heather Hales Sneddon. They had a son, Lukas, and a daugher, Li-An, and divorced in 2002. He and Ms. Mutter married in 2002 and divorced in 2006 but continued to perform together. “You know how people say that their marriage didn’t work?” he said in 2017. “With us, the divorce didn’t work. We call each other every day regardless of where we are. Maybe she’s in China and I’m in Cincinnati, but we find each other. It’s like being very best friends who have a romantic history.” Complete information on his survivors was not immediately available. Mr. Previn seemed puzzled that critics continued to mention his Hollywood past long after he had been focusing on classical music. “I haven’t done anything else since the mid-’60s,” he told The Times in 1991. “I think there’s a statute of limitations here. “When I go to Tanglewood to teach, the kids don’t know I ever did anything else,” he continued. “Sometimes they see a movie on the late, late show, and they say, ‘Who is that?’ And then I have to confess that the man who manufactured harp glissandos for Esther Williams to dive to was actually me.” "
5c94a47349f0eacbf105e71e,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/22/arts/music/ivo-van-hove-brooklyn-academy-music-janacek-diary.html,"PARIS — A woman enters a studio apartment, makes herself some coffee and presses play on a tape recorder. “Sit at the piano,” a male voice on the tape says. A man stands in front of the projected image of a naked woman, her body imprinted on his white shirt. A couple embraces passionately on the floor as dappled light filters across their bodies. A man sits alone on a narrow bed. “I will be waiting for you,” he says, as the lights dim. These are some of the poetic, surprising images from Ivo van Hove’s staging of Leos Janacek’s song cycle “Diary of One Who Disappeared,” which will come to the Brooklyn Academy of Music April 4-6. Angular, lyrical and passionate, “Diary” — written for tenor, mezzo-soprano, a small chorus of three women, and piano — is rarely performed in concert, and it’s even more rarely staged. But it is pure drama. Based on an anonymous series of poems published in a Czech newspaper and completed in 1920, it tells the story of a young man who falls wildly in love with a Gypsy girl, abandoning his village and family to follow her. It’s an unusual project for Mr. van Hove, the Belgian director who has become one of the most important voices on the international theater scene. He has directed more than a dozen operas as well as classic and contemporary plays; adapted films for the stage; and soon will tackle a signature American musical, with his revival of “West Side Story” scheduled to come to Broadway next year. [Three of our critics debate Mr. van Hove’s work.] But a song cycle? “I haven’t done anything quite like this before,” he said in an interview at the Comédie-Française in Paris, where he was rehearsing a new production, “Electre/Oreste.” “You have to invent more,” he added. “An opera composer is thinking about staging, but with this you have to create a theatrical world. It’s bringing alive something that was just going to stand there and sing.” Mr. van Hove and his longtime partner, the designer Jan Versweyveld, drew from Janacek’s own history for the production. The story of “Diary” parallels the composer’s obsession with Kamila Stosslova, a married woman 35 years his junior, who inspired some of his most important works. “The black Gypsy girl in my ‘Diary of One Who Disappeared’ — that was you,” Janacek wrote in one of his more than 700 letters to Stosslova. “That’s why there’s so much emotional fire in the work. So much fire that if we both caught on, we’d be turned into ashes.” Mr. van Hove said: “I always adore when an author writes something that is a matter of life and death, which this is, I think, to Janacek. Some of my work, like ‘Electre/Oreste’ or ‘Boris Goudonov,’ is very political. But this one is about why we are here on earth, what is this life of ours?” Pulling out a few sheets of paper covered in neatly written notes, Mr. van Hove said that he always began a project by writing down his initial thoughts. “It’s important to remember why you want to do it,” he said. “This piece is really human. It’s not about gods and dramatic events; it’s about things that everyone has experienced. Everyone has been in love with someone who hasn’t been in love with him or her, or has experienced platonic love.” He added that he had long been a fan of Janacek’s music; his Flemish Opera production of “The Makropulos Case” in 2002 was one of his first forays into opera. He suggested “Diary” to the Muziektheater Transparant, a small, innovative opera company based in Antwerp, Belgium, with which he has long collaborated; he wanted to bring out Janacek’s ability “to write dialogue that became music, to turn language into notes. Even when they are singing, they are talking.” He and Mr. Versweyveld began to read Janacek’s diaries, and his letters to Stosslova. (The relationship remained almost entirely platonic, and most of her letters were destroyed by Janacek, at her request.) “I think Janacek saw his feelings reflected in the poems,” said Mr. van Hove. “It’s a kind of self-portrait. We started to see a framework to let this short song cycle shine.” Since the mezzo-soprano part is slight, he decided to give the Gypsy girl, Zefka, more of a voice. He asked the Belgian composer Annelies Van Parys to add more music for the character, which she based on Romany folk songs. “It’s full of colors, very personal and sensitive,” said Marie Hamard, who will sing the role in Brooklyn. “Annelies gives a true thickness and density to the feminine voice.” Mr. van Hove also incorporated extracts from Janacek’s diaries that are read by an actor (Wim van der Grijn) who is dressed to resemble an older version of the cycle’s tenor protagonist (Andrew Dickinson), emphasizing the similarities between composer and character. Working with the dramaturg Krystian Lada, Mr. van Hove and Mr. Versweyveld decided to make this main character a photographer, and the stage space, in part, a darkroom. “It’s an atelier, a world of imagination, in which the pictures that have been taken bring back the past that is sometimes forgotten,” Mr. van Hove said. Mr. Versweyveld said the challenge was to create an intimate space in which the character looks back on his life and love, but also to evoke the woods, trees and natural light that he is recalling. The solution was an apartment in which the character lives and works, permeated by golden, mottled light when the memories of glimpsing and meeting Zefka are evoked. “I like to design things that are functional,” Mr. Versweyveld said, adding that the mid-20th-century-modern set was inspired by the interiors of the photographer protagonist’s home in the Antonioni film “Blow Up.” Similarly, he added, “the light may be striking or beautiful, but it always serves a purpose. When it comes through the walls like light in a forest, it is opening up the space in the most dramatic moment in the show.” (Unlike in many van Hove productions, there is no video element.) Mr. van Hove said that his preparation for directing an opera or vocal score begins with finding a good recording, and working with a dramaturg who knows the music intimately. “I really study; it takes me three times as long for an opera as for a theater production,” he said, adding that while he doesn’t read music, he has learned to understand a score in terms of “where the opportunities are for a director.” “If you are not deeply interested in music,” he said, “stay away from it as a director, because there has always been a director there before you: the composer.” There are also practical issues to take into account. “You have to be sure,” he said, “that everything is absolutely constructed for singers, much more than with actors, because they have to take care of what they are singing, respond to others on stage, and also be able to see the conductor.” “It’s really music theater,” said Mr. van Hove, who added that the show’s genre — a combination of spoken word, music and visual elements — greatly interested him. His adaptation of Thomas Mann’s “Death in Venice,” incorporating music by Weber, Schoenberg and Nico Muhly, will have its premiere on April 4 with the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam. “What can it give us? What can it bring?” he added. “I would like to think about this in the next years.” "
5c3f94e83a125f5075c04c5e,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/16/arts/music/review-pelleas-et-melisande-met-opera.html,"Yannick Nézet-Séguin, the new music director of the Metropolitan Opera, may not have many appearances with the company this season. But conducting the opening of  Debussy’s “Pelléas et Mélisande” on Tuesday night, he seemed fully in charge. The 43-year-old conductor captured the hushed eeriness of the work’s first few measures, in which the orchestra suggests the somber, mysterious mood that pervades the entire opera. But that’s not all. What also came through immediately was that, still fresh in his new role at the Met, Mr. Nézet-Séguin has arrived with bold interpretive ideas and the determination to carry them out. He took a daringly slow tempo in this opening passage, a solemn, low theme in chords that hints at modal plainchant. The restrained sound of the strings was deep and dark, yet resonant and slightly tremulous. The theme that immediately follows — a nervous, oscillating two-note motif — was all the more ominous for his subdued, weighty rendering. [Why it matters that the Met’s music director is openly gay] Throughout this long work, Mr. Nézet-Séguin conveyed the subliminal intensity that courses through even the most seemingly languid and diaphanous passages. The fraught eruptions had shattering impact. During whole stretches, the orchestra enshrouds the vocal lines with sonorities that give lift and clarity to the sung words, while tapping into the psychological undertow of the emotions. All this came through in the performances Mr. Nézet-Séguin drew from the inspired orchestra and admirable cast. In a revealing interview with The New York Times published this week, Mr. Nézet-Séguin said that the “basic presence of the orchestral sound” at the Met is not exactly what he imagines it could be. With his elegant, vibrant performances of Verdi’s “La Traviata” in December, he worked to bring out what he called a richer, more resonant and bass-oriented sound. Though his comments were a little vague, what he is describing generally characterized this “Pelléas.” He emphasized the Wagnerian elements that seeped into Debussy’s score, especially with the orchestra’s deep-set, warm sound — which did seem different from the lighter textures favored by his predecessor, James Levine. (Mr. Levine  was fired last year over allegations of sexual misconduct, which he has denied.) Yet, the weightiness was balanced by French-styled radiance in the opera’s many iridescent passages. This “Pelléas” is the first revival in nearly a decade of Jonathan Miller’s 1995 production, which metaphorically sets the story of an ill-fated family in a Gothic 19th-century castle where outdoor forests and chalky inner sanctums seem to merge. The sense of doom that runs through this opera, with a libretto Debussy adapted from Maeterlinck’s Symbolist play, came through in the opening scene between Prince Golaud, a grandson of King Arkel of Allemonde, and Mélisande, the frightened, secretive young woman Golaud encounters weeping by a fountain in the forest. The bass-baritone Kyle Ketelsen commanded the stage as Golaud, his voice robust and strong, yet grave. A lonely widower, Golaud is at once drawn to and protective of Mélisande. He knows not to press her immediately with questions about where she has come from, who has harmed her, and how. The mezzo-soprano Isabel Leonard brought a melting sound to Mélisande while suggesting the character’s fears and volatility. Yet, she intriguingly tapped into this fragile young woman’s willfulness. After all, it takes control to maintain secrets (and to downright lie) as Mélisande does. You understand why she almost passively, as we soon learn, marries Golaud. What other course is there? In a way, what does it matter? The tenor Paul Appleby brought youthful impulsiveness and sweetness to Pelléas, Golaud’s impressionable younger half brother, who falls uncontrollably in love with Mélisande. But on Tuesday, he seemed vocally underpowered, especially in his lower register. The role has been sung both by light baritones and tenors. Mr. Appleby’s voice had more presence when the music took him into his bright, upper range. The veteran bass Ferruccio Furlanetto, singing with earthy sound and aching sadness, was magnificent as the old, nearly-blind Arkel, who seems to accept that all people, even the members of his sullen family, are guided by fates we can only guess at. The plush-voiced contralto Marie-Nicole Lemieux had a notable Met debut in the small but crucial role of Geneviève, the wistful mother to both Golaud and Pelléas. A. Jesse Schopflocher, an impressive treble, made an endearing Yniold, Golaud’s young son, who is baffled by the adults and turns fearful when his father is seized with violent jealousy of his wife. Alas, there are only four remaining performances, with Mr. Nézet-Séguin conducting just three. It will take time for him to fill out his schedule at the Met. But it’s worth the wait. "
5c497e963a125f5075c06087,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/24/arts/music/kodak-black-r-kelly-dying-to-live.html,"A couple of years ago, songs made by the rapper Kodak Black as a young teenager began to recirculate online. The most striking was “Ambition,” a precociously skeptical and wounded song. “I’m 14 and already thinking ’bout death,” he rapped. “Damn, I was raised by the dead end.” For the rest of his teenage years, Kodak continued on this path, returning time and again to themes of hopeless circumstances, existential frailty, perseverance blended with nihilism. They ground all of his albums and mixtapes, right up through “Dying to Live,” his second studio album, which was released last month and debuted at the top of the Billboard album chart. But Kodak’s success comes under a lingering cloud, one familiar to any observer of hip-hop in the past few years. The 21-year-old Florida rapper is scheduled to stand trial this spring on charges of criminal sexual conduct, stemming from a 2016 incident in South Carolina in which he is accused of sexually assaulting a young woman at a hotel following a concert. According to the Florence County Sheriff’s Office incident report, he bit the victim and told her “that he could not help himself.” She reported the attack to her school resource officer. A condition of the consent order setting Kodak’s bond is that he cannot discuss the case publicly, nor can anyone representing the defense or the prosecution, according to Beattie Ashmore, one of his lawyers. Of the many rappers who in recent years have experienced explosive popularity while facing horrific criminal allegations, none is as contemplative or introspective an artist as Kodak Black. 6ix9ine is a taunter. XXXTentacion wrestled with pain, but rarely with ethics. Neither arrived at a place in which morality was a recurrent theme of his work. Over two major label albums and several mixtapes, Kodak has proved himself to be an acute observer of both his own internal conflicts and the external circumstances that helped set him on his path. If any artist in this situation is well-suited to directly tackle the complexities of these sorts of issues in his art — and in public life — it’s him. But he hasn’t risen to the occasion. “Dying to Live” — Kodak’s first major musical statement since being released from jail in August for weapons and drug charges and probation violation — is a very strong album, and in places, you hear the Kodak who might have something of substance to say. On “Transgression,” he proposes a turn to penitence: “I did everything the streets told me was cool to do/Now I’d rather prove it to myself before I prove to you/I hate I fell in love with thuggin’, I give my mama anxiety.” On “Needing Something,” he tightens his slurry wheeze into an anguished singing voice: “All this pain make me sing songs/Ain’t no love in the sewer that I came from.” Elsewhere on the album, like on “Testimony” and “If I’m Lyin, I’m Flyin,” he sounds regretful, rapping with a heavy head about God trying to set him on a better path. But given what’s happening in his public life, what isn’t there is almost louder: any sort of understanding of what it’s like to victimize someone, or be a victim. There is no shortage of opportunities to speak about these issues in public settings, however, and Kodak’s recent promotional tour around the release of “Dying to Live,” which took him mostly to radio stations, provided several chances for him to be engaged by interviewers. That’s what happened on the Hot 97 morning show “Ebro in the Morning.” The host Ebro Darden began the conversation by mentioning Kodak’s various criminal cases, but then pivoted away from them into an interview that had all the comfort of a trip to the principal’s office. In one moment of a generally unrevealing interview, Kodak was comfortable enough to display reflection: “I don’t really believe in karma, but I feel like the world, it don’t favor us, so I gotta, like, stop, like, living and thugging so hard, so the world can soften up around me.” A moment later, he added, “A good tree ain’t gonna produce no bad fruit.” This was the Kodak that appears in his music: self-aware, and concerned with consequences. It was the perfect moment for Darden to introduce a challenging line of questioning, but instead, the conversation retreated to the banal. Only at the conclusion did Darden return to the subject, while never directly asking Kodak a question. “We take sexual assault here serious,” Darden said sternly, then followed with an invitation to return and discuss it at a later date. Kodak looked disoriented. Moreover, he appeared surprised that the allegation would be even alluded to in an interview, as if no one around him had suggested it might. He brusquely walked out. In other interviews from that week, the allegations did not come up. Kodak’s talk with the Breakfast Club, on the Hot 97 rival station Power 105, was much more jovial, including banter about safe sex and child support. On the podcast “A Waste of Time With ItsTheReal” — which opened with a direct statement that Kodak wouldn’t be asked about the allegations — Kodak again revealed striking insight into navigating the gap between perception and reality: “Sometimes they make you feel like criminalized and all that stuff. Sometimes they make you feel like you worthless and stuff, so when I see people really like shouting, and trying to take pictures, screaming, I be like, damn, me? Like for real? I’m from the projects. Like, me?” Missed opportunities, all of them. Part of this has to do with the norms of the day — power has tilted heavily in celebrities’ favor when it comes to press: Media outlets routinely make ethical sacrifices to secure big names. Kodak communicates with his fans via Instagram, and generally, that is enough for him; being asked uncomfortable questions is something he hasn’t learned how to manage. It’s a circumstance that allows young artists to experience great success with little friction, and possibly, to remain successful while holding skepticism and inquiry at arm’s length, or pretending it doesn’t exist altogether. That wasn’t always the case, however. It was especially pointed listening to the Kodak Black album and observing its rollout in the wake of the recent Lifetime documentary series “Surviving R. Kelly,” which details allegations that have long trailed the 52-year-old R&B singer: that he targets underage women for sexual relationships, deploys emotional and physical abuse against his partners and leverages his power and stature to silence his victims. The scope of Kelly’s alleged transgressions is vast, and spans decades. Kodak Black is accused of one sexual assault. But the R. Kelly series underscored the changing ways in which performers hide, both in their public life and their art. “Surviving R. Kelly” reminds us how throughout Kelly’s ascent and troubled run, the media kept the allegations in the public conversation. There is footage from three televised interviews with Kelly: In 2002, after a sex tape that appears to show him urinating on an underage girl leaks; in 2008, after he is acquitted of child pornography charges; in 2012, pegged to the release of his autobiography. The interviews are awkward, and Kelly is deflecting in each of them. Nevertheless, Kelly faced public questioning, in a time in which television — and media in general — held more sway over an artist’s public image. Kelly’s reply when asked directly if he is attracted to teenage girls — “When you say ‘teenage,’ how old are we talking?” — remains indelible, much as Kodak’s blunt dismissal of Darden and abrupt departure, captured on video and spread widely online, will. But perhaps the more meaningful lesson to be extracted from “Surviving R. Kelly” has to do with Kelly’s strategic use of music as a character witness. Kelly deployed the godly alongside the carnal, the romantic alongside the lustful; during eras in which he was being vilified, he often used music — “I Believe I Can Fly,” “Step in the Name of Love” — as a means of cleansing his image in real time. And then there is Kodak, haunted by his demons and gifted at sharing. But his capacity for reflection is a similar distraction — a glimmer of maturity that holds out hope, but is only a glimmer. To be vulnerable and also cloistered, mature and also naïve — it is possible for both things to be true at the same time. "

Claim to Fame: Mr. Tierney is a self-taught photographer and videographer who has toured with Niall Horan (a former member of One Direction) and Hailee Steinfeld, and has photographed top music acts including Drake, the Weeknd, Demi Lovato, Kendrick Lamar and the 1975.  In January, Mr. Tierney was nominated for an iHeartRadio Music Award for tour photography. “I just try to understand people,” he said. “Every time I shoot somebody new, I take a different approach. You have to work out how to show their personality in a visual way.” Big Break: At 15, Mr. Tierney started a YouTube channel on which he interviewed and showcased live sessions with emerging Irish musicians and others. “I always had a good ear for picking who the next big artists were going to be,” he said.  To book talent, he would cold-email managers whose artists were touring in Dublin. Macklemore and Ryan Lewis, then an unknown hip-hop act from Seattle, were among the first to say yes. When their 2012 hit, “Thrift Shop,” made them famous, it was easier for Mr. Tierney to book other artists, like James Bay, who recorded a video for “Let It Go” on the channel. Latest Project: Mr. Tierney spent much of last year traveling in Europe and America for Mr. Horan’s “Flicker” tour. During the summer, he photographed Ms. Steinfeld’s shows. Though touring may seem glamorous from afar, there’s little time for sightseeing.  “When you wake up, you’re on tour, and you’re working until you go to bed that night,” he said. “Technically I’ve been to Sweden, but I haven’t seen anywhere except the inside of the venue.” Next Thing: Next month, Mr. Tierney will join Hozier, an Irish crooner best known for the song “Take Me to Church,” on his American tour. “His show is very rock- and blues-based, which is quite different from the pop tours I did with Hailee and Niall,” Mr. Tierney said. “I saw him play six years ago in Dublin to a small audience, so to see his journey has been amazing.” After the tour, Mr. Tierney plans to move to Los Angeles. On the Pulse: Though he no longer produces live sessions for YouTube, Mr. Tierney still has an eye for breakout talent. This year, he hopes to hear more of Dermot Kennedy, who mixes hip-hop production with traditional Irish songwriting, and Rosalía, a modern flamenco artist from Catalonia, Spain, who has been nominated for six Latin Grammys.  “She has such a unique creative vision and aesthetic that is very much her own,” he said. “I don’t think there’s anybody else who’s doing what she’s doing.” "

Nederlander announced Tuesday that he is producing a new musical featuring the song catalog of Ms. Spears — one of the best-selling pop artists of all time — that explores an alternative arc for some classic fairy tale princesses. The show, a musical comedy called “Once Upon a One More Time,” is scheduled to have a production this fall in Chicago and then seek to transfer to Broadway. Unlike many jukebox musicals, this show will not be about Ms. Spears’s life (which has not been a fairy tale), but instead will offer a revisionist look at some legendary characters. In the show, a fortnightly book club whose members include Snow White, Cinderella, Rapunzel and Sleeping Beauty, is working its way through a collection of the Grimms’ fairy tales — the only book they have. But when the women wish for new reading material, a fairy godmother brings them Ms. Friedan’s feminist classic, “The Feminine Mystique,” and their lives are altered in unexpected ways. “Cinderella is having an existential crisis, and she has a posse of famous princesses, and her stepmother is the main antagonist, and there’s also Prince Charming and a dwarf we’ve never met — the eighth dwarf — and a narrator who is unhappy his system is being dismantled before his eyes,” said the bookwriter, Jon Hartmere, who wrote the screenplay for “The Upside” and was one of the writers of “Bare,” a musical about gay Christian teenagers. “These women have been in this hermetically sealed world, and then they start to get deeper into modern ideas — second and third-wave feminism — and also explore how stories are passed down to us, and where we get our norms from. But it’s also superfun and funny.” The director will be Kristin Hanggi (“Rock of Ages”) and the choreographers Keone & Mari Madrid (Justin Bieber’s “Love Yourself”; “World of Dance”). The project has already had several readings — one of them attended by Ms. Spears — and will have a developmental workshop next month, Mr. Hartmere said. He said the score currently includes 23 songs from Ms. Spears’s catalog, including most of her big hits, as well as “a couple of deep album cuts.” The show is scheduled to start previews Oct. 29, to open Nov. 13, and to run until Dec. 1 at the James M. Nederlander Theater in Chicago. Those are the same dates, and the same theater, that had been set aside for “Don’t Stop ’Til You Get Enough,” a Michael Jackson jukebox musical that canceled its Chicago plans on the eve of an HBO documentary detailing abuse allegations against the pop star. That show’s producers say they are still hoping to come to Broadway. "
5c70a8ac3a125f5075c0b1f7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/22/obituaries/jackie-shane-dead.html,"Jackie Shane, a black transgender soul singer who packed nightclubs in 1960s Toronto before she stepped out of the spotlight for decades, only to re-emerge with a Grammy-nominated record in her 70s, has died. She was 78. Her death was confirmed by Douglas Mcgowan, her producer and friend. He said her body was found at her home in Nashville on Thursday. He said he did not know when she had died or the cause. Almost five decades passed between Ms. Shane’s 1960s career in Canada and her 2018 Grammy nomination for best historical album, for “Any Other Way.” The record introduced her to a new generation of fans, and today her face is part of a towering mural in downtown Toronto. “I do believe that it’s like destiny,” Ms. Shane told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation this month. “I really feel that I have made a place for myself with wonderful people. What I have said, what I have done, they say it makes their lives better.” Jackie Shane was born in Nashville on May 15, 1940, and grew up as a black transgender child in the Jim Crow South. But she made her name after she moved to Toronto around 1959, becoming a force in its music scene and packing its nightclubs. She scored the No. 2 spot on the Canadian singles chart in 1963 with her silky cover of William Bell’s “Any Other Way.” The song is about putting on a brave face for the friend of an ex-girlfriend, but Ms. Shane gave it a subversive twist when she sang, “Tell her that I’m happy, tell her that I’m gay.” Ms. Shane said she identified as female from the age of 13, but throughout her 1960s career she was publicly referred to as a man. Speaking to The New York Times in 2017, she said she sometimes described herself to peers as gay. “I was just being me,” she said. “I never tried to explain myself to anyone — they never explained themselves to me.” As a child, she said, her unabashed femininity and unwavering self-confidence turned heads. In 2017, she told The Times about a grade school bully who unwisely threw a stone at her. The rock hit her, and the bully’s fate was sealed. “He wanted to torment me and I would never allow that,” Ms. Shane said. She picked up a jump rope and whipped the boy with it. When a teacher tried to separate them, she hit the teacher, too. Ms. Shane told the CBC  this month that she had moved to Canada after witnessing a group of white men attacking a black man one night in Nashville. “One cannot choose where one is born,’’ she said, “but you can choose your home.” In Canada, Ms. Shane mingled with music royalty, sharing a stage with Etta James, Jackie Wilson and the Impressions and other stars. But in 1971 she abruptly left it all behind. In the following decades she became a cult heroine and a legend online, where fans speculated about where she had gone. The answer, it turned out, was Los Angeles. She told The Times in 2017 that she had left Toronto to be with her mother, Jessie Shane, who was living alone after the death of Ms. Shane’s stepfather in 1963. Ms. Shane may have been a star in Canada, but it didn’t feel right to her, she said, that her mother was living by herself so far away. So she went to live with her in Los Angeles, and they later moved back to Nashville, where her mother died in 1997. Mr. Mcgowan said on Thursday that Ms. Shane had no immediate survivors. After her mother died, Ms. Shane lived an intensely private life. She watched old movies and network dramas, ordered takeout and ventured outside only every once in a while. When she did, she wore a hat and dark glasses lest she be recognized. Ms. Shane watched history march on from the comfort of relative anonymity. In her interview with The Times, she shared her thoughts on the legalization of same-sex marriage (“We’ve had to fight for everything that should have already been on the table”) and shook her head at the state of pop music (“I’m going to have to school these people again”). One thing Ms. Shane did not do during her decade of Canadian stardom was record a studio album. That changed in 2017, when the Chicago-based label Numero Group released her anthology, which was later nominated for a Grammy Award. Ms. Shane shared her life philosophy with the CBC this month. “Most people are planted in someone else’s soil, which means they’re a carbon copy,” she said. “I say to them: ‘Uproot yourself. Get into your own soil. You may be surprised who you really are.’ ” "

The show’s host, Reba McEntire — her record 16th time in the job — wasted no time in addressing one of the evening’s touchy subjects: the lack of women nominees in some top categories. Noting recent snow in Las Vegas, where the awards were held in a live, performance-heavy broadcast, McEntire said, “It was so cold it froze us women out of entertainer of the year.” Kacey Musgraves, the winner of four Grammy Awards this year, including album of the year for “Golden Hour,” was absent from the all-male list of nominees in the show’s top category. The honor went to Keith Urban, whose wife, the actress Nicole Kidman, appeared genuinely shocked at his win. But Musgraves took home the awards for both album of the year and female artist of the year. “I’m so thankful for the chance to share my political perspective,” Musgraves said in accepting the female artist of the year prize, dedicating the award to women who felt pressure to silence themselves. “This award goes out to any woman, or girl — or anybody, really — that is maybe being told that her perspective or her style is too different to work,” Musgraves said. “Just stay at it. It’ll work out.” [Watch how Kacey Musgraves turned country music psychedelic.] And women ruled the MGM Grand Garden Arena stage as Chrissy Metz, of hit NBC show “This Is Us,” made her live TV performance debut, alongside the country stars Lauren Alaina, Mickey Guyton and Maddie & Tae, for a stirring rendition of “I’m Standing With You.” Jason Aldean and Florida Georgia Line opened the show with a rousing performance of “Can’t Hide Red,” but some on social media took offense to Tyler Hubbard’s American flag suit. Dan + Shay scored three straight early wins, for song of the year and single of the year for “Tequila,” as well as duo of the year. Male artist of the year went to Thomas Rhett. The star-laden three-hour show marked an upbeat return to celebrating country music after last year’s awards assumed a somber note following the October 2017 mass shooting, also in Las Vegas, that killed 58 people at a country music festival. Aldean, who was performing at that festival when the gunfire broke out, received the ACM artist of the decade award. Other country stars performing included Blake Shelton, Luke Bryan, Chris Stapleton, Urban, Brooks & Dunn, Miranda Lambert, McEntire and George Strait. "

He was 77. His daughter Angela Birdsong said on Tuesday that the cause was not certain, but that Mr. Birdsong had suffered several strokes in the past and had congestive heart failure. Mr. Birdsong released a handful of solo albums, among them “What It Is” (1972), “Super Natural” (1973) and “Edwin Birdsong” (1979), but they achieved only limited success, and he turned to working as a sought-after session musician and producer for better-known acts. In the late 1980s, however, sample-hungry producers rediscovered Mr. Birdsong’s work, notably the songs “Rapper Dapper Snapper” and “Cola Bottle Baby.” The percussion and bass line of “Rapper Dapper Snapper” were an important part of “Me, Myself and I,” the breakout hit on De La Soul’s debut album, “3 Feet High and Rising” (1989). The song was also sampled on the Gang Starr song “Skills” in 2003. “Cola Bottle Baby,” an energetic tribute to women of a certain shape, became the basis of a very different kind of dance music when the French electronic duo Daft Punk used it for the hit “Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger” on their second album, “Discovery” (2001). Kanye West repurposed “Cola” yet again when he sampled Daft Punk’s single to make an even bigger hit, “Stronger,” on his third album, “Graduation” (2007). In an interview with the online audio program Jazz Under the Bridge in 2016, Mr. Birdsong said he felt “blessed” to see his creations reinvented, adding, “God gives the music to all of the musicians around the world.” Edwin Lee Birdsong was born on Aug. 22, 1941, in Shreveport, La., to Sidney and Josephine (Page) Birdsong. His father was a Baptist minister, and Edwin grew up playing the piano in church. The family moved to Los Angeles when Edwin was young, and he graduated from high school there in 1959 before serving in the Army. For a time he was stationed in Germany, where he played piano in bars. After returning to the states, he studied music at the Manhattan School of Music and the Juilliard School without graduating from either. Mr. Birdsong worked with Stevie Wonder and was a frequent collaborator with Roy Ayers, the jazz, funk and soul vibraphone player. One of his collaborations with Mr. Ayers, “Running Away,” was sampled by A Tribe Called Quest on “Description of a Fool,” the last song on their first album, the hip-hop classic “People’s Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm” (1990). Mr. Birdsong’s three marriages ended in divorce. He lived in Victorville, Calif. In addition to his daughter Angela, he is survived by five other daughters, Linda Owens and Robin, Tia, Shebibah and Candice Birdsong; three sons, Sterling, Singh and Anthony; three sisters, Linda Ticer, Elzater Williams and Lemonia Golden; a brother, Sheldon; eight grandchildren; and six great-grandchildren.

Following an article published by The New York Times on Wednesday about Adams’s treatment of women, from a teenage fan to his ex-wife, Mandy Moore, F.B.I. agents in the bureau’s New York office took the first steps to open a criminal investigation. They are responding to an accusation that Adams exchanged sexually explicit images with the teenager, who said her communication with the singer began when she was 14 and ended when she was 16. They never met in person, and through a lawyer, Adams has denied ever engaging in sexual conversations with someone he knew was underage. [Read our report: Ryan Adams dangled success. Women say they paid a price.] Adams, a prolific Grammy-nominated rock and alternative country singer, had previously announced plans to release three albums this year via Blue Note Records and his own Pax-Am label. On Thursday, the first of those new albums, “Big Colors,” which had been scheduled for April 19, was put on hold indefinitely, according to music retailers. Bull Moose, a record store chain in Maine and New Hampshire, posted on Twitter a message it had received from a supplier stating the album “has been canceled effectively immediately.” A representative for the store confirmed it had been alerted by a sales representative for Universal Music Group that the album was canceled. Capitol Music Group, a division of Universal Music, which was scheduled to distribute Adams’s new albums, declined to comment. SRCVinyl, another seller, said it was offering refunds for customers who had already purchased “Big Colors,” and a pre-order page on the Pax-Am website was also removed. Two musical equipment companies that worked with the singer also suspended their relationships with him on Thursday. In a statement, Benson Amps said it was “saddened and surprised by the recent allegations” against Adams and would no longer move forward with the development of a Ryan Adams signature model. JHS Pedals, a guitar effects company, said it would cease all collaboration with Adams and discontinue his signature pedal, adding that it would rebrand its current inventory “with a portion of the sale going towards the fight against sexual abuse and misconduct.” [F.B.I. opens inquiry into Ryan Adams’s explicit communications with underage fan.] Adams was also accused in The Times’s article of a pattern of emotional abuse and manipulation, in which he offered career assistance and credibility to young female musicians, only to sometimes turn harassing and retaliatory. Adams denied the characterizations of his behavior as abusive or manipulative and challenged the accuracy of the reporting, though he apologized on Twitter “to anyone I have ever hurt, however unintentionally.” In January, Adams, who has released 16 studio albums and a much-discussed cover version of Taylor Swift’s “1989,” announced a deluge of new music in a nontraditional way: via political reporters. Using well-known staff members from The Washington Post, CBS, NBC and Politico, Adams spread information about his three new albums, including “Big Colors” and a follow-up titled “Wednesdays.” He had also announced 10 European tour dates beginning March 30 in Dublin. As of Friday, tickets were still available for purchase. “Big Colors” was produced by Don Was, the president of Blue Note Records, and was scheduled to feature John Mayer, Bob Mould and Benmont Tench of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. Guest musicians slated for “Wednesdays,” which was not given a release date, included Emmylou Harris and Jason Isbell, who wrote on Twitter this week that he believed the women speaking out against Adams. Other former collaborators have also come forward. The musician and model Karen Elson, who toured with Adams in 2017, said in a post on Instagram that she “also had a traumatizing experience with Ryan Adams.” But she added, “I’m not quite brave enough yet to speak about my specifics.” Asked about the allegations against Adams, the singer-songwriter Liz Phair, with whom Adams said he was working on a double album in 2017, posted on Twitter: “My experience was nowhere near as personally involving, but yes the record ended and the similarities are upsetting.” "
5c2dab2f3a125f5075c02a1b,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/03/world/australia/twisted-sister-clive-palmer.html,"SYDNEY, Australia — It’s the same thrashing guitar and rock music, but the words are different from the lyrics of Twisted Sister’s hit song, and the band is not impressed. The rock band from New Jersey has told an Australian politician to stop using its song “We’re Not Gonna Take It” in his advertising campaign. Clive Palmer, a conservative politician and mining magnate, rolled out a national marketing campaign for his center-right United Australia Party over the holiday period. Ads from the campaign use the music from “We’re Not Gonna Take It,” changing the words to “Australia ain’t gonna cop it.” The ads criticize spending and delays related to the National Broadband Network, an infrastructure project intended to improve the country’s internet speeds. Dee Snider, the lead singer of Twisted Sister, responded on Twitter this week to questions from users who were incensed by the ad’s “butchering” of the song. He said the band was considering legal action. One of the band’s guitarists, Jay Jay French, also said on Twitter that the band had not been informed that its music would be used for political purposes. Mr. Palmer responded by suggesting that the band members were motivated by poor ticket sales. Mr. Snider is scheduled to perform in Sydney and Melbourne this month. “Old rocker who can not sell enough tickets to their last gig need publicity,” Mr. Palmer wrote in a text message to Australia’s ABC News on Wednesday. He, too, threatened to sue. “I wrote the words personally that appear on our promotion and hold the copyright for those words,” The Sydney Morning Herald quoted Mr. Palmer as saying. If members of the band “attempt to use my lyrics in any of their songs, I’ll not hesitate to take legal proceedings against them,” he said. “As foreigners, they should stay out of Australian domestic politics and stay where they are. Aussies are not going to cop it at all!” This is not the first time Twisted Sister has clashed with politicians about the song, which, when it was released in 1984, struck a chord with its themes of rebellion and freedom of choice. Paul D. Ryan, the outgoing speaker of the United States House of Representatives, used it during his vice-presidential run with former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts in 2012. Mr. Snider’s statement at the time denouncing Mr. Ryan’s use of the song included the comment: “There is almost nothing on which I agree with Paul Ryan, except perhaps the use of the P90X,” referring to Mr. Ryan’s workout program. Mr. Snider did, however, allow Donald Trump to use the song in his presidential campaign. Mr. Snider told Newsweek that Mr. Trump was a friend and had asked him for permission, which he gave because Mr. Trump’s “rebelling” was in the song’s spirit. (Mr. Snider has since said that he was “not a fan of Trump’s style,” though he said the president was “not being given a chance.”) Mr. Snider harkened back to the rebellion theme in further Twitter posts regarding Mr. Palmer’s advertisement. “‘We’re Not Gonna Take It’ is a song about EVERYONE’S right to free choice,” he said. Mr. Palmer and his party “are NOT pro choice,” Mr. Snider wrote. “So THIS AIN’T HIS SONG!” "

Rogers became a phenomenon while riding a wave beyond her control. Her first full-length album, “Heard It in a Past Life,” debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard album chart this week, and it is largely the product of her trying to outrun the expectations that came on the heels of that clip. Her music has roots in folk, but is very familiar with contemporary electronic pop — a modern hybrid that places her squarely near pop’s aesthetic center even as she tries to maintain an outsider’s perspective. There are a few parallels between Rogers, still in the early stages of her career, and Sharon Van Etten, whose fifth studio album, “Remind Me Tomorrow,” marks a shift away from the cold, aching folk of her early releases into something more contemporary without losing its emotional intelligence.  Also on this week’s episode: a tribute to James Ingram. This week’s guests: Joe Coscarelli, The New York Times’s pop music reporter Lindsay Zoladz, a staff writer at the Ringer "

The allegations contained in the film are specific, and devastating. Both Robson and Safechuck say that after meeting Jackson as children in professional contexts, he took advantage of his stature to groom them for abuse, and continued to molest them for years. (The Michael Jackson estate has denied the claims, and is seeking $100 million in damages from HBO.) The film has had deep reverberations. Oprah Winfrey came out in support of the accusers, interviewing them for a television special. And the conversation around the film has placed Jackson in the cross hairs of several ongoing conversations about how culture made by people accused of heinous crimes will be dealt with in the future. The film is likely to have an impact on the value of his estate, and the way any future Jackson projects unfold. At the same time, Michael Jackson superfans have been pushing back against the film, suggesting it amounts to little more than rumor.

The show paid mere lip service to the successes of women and nonwhite performers, and were boring to boot. So the bar for this year’s ceremony, which took place Sunday at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, was low, and the remit was clear: do everything the opposite of how it has been done. To some degree, the 61st annual Grammy Awards delivered. Though there were ample tributes to the music of decades past, and some awkwardly cut-short speeches (see: Drake, Dua Lipa), there were also performances from worthy young singers (Camila Cabello, H.E.R.), rising hip-hop stars (Cardi B, Travis Scott) and the next generation of Americana royalty (Kacey Musgraves, Brandi Carlile). That most of the show’s most impressive moments came from women was a rebuke to all the recent years in which the Grammys seemed content to sideline impressive female talent.

5c2fc4553a125f5075c02e66,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/obituaries/christine-mcguire-dead.html,"Christine McGuire, the eldest of the singing McGuire Sisters, who struck gold on the pop charts in the 1950s with “Sincerely,” “Sugartime” and other close-harmony hits that won young American hearts not quite ready for rock ′n’ roll, died on Dec. 28 at her home in Las Vegas. She was 92. Ms. McGuire’s family confirmed her death in a statement released on Friday. No cause was given. With their identical dresses and hairdos, synchronized movements and sweetly innocent voices, the McGuire Sisters — Christine, Dorothy and Phyllis — were the musical embodiment of popular culture in their day, singing for audiences who watched “Your Hit Parade” on television and listened to Perry Como, Patti Page and the lingering postwar strains of the big band era. After appearing on “Arthur Godfrey’s Talent Scouts” in 1952, the McGuire Sisters soared to national fame. They were regulars on Mr. Godfrey’s morning shows for six years and remained one of the nation’s most popular vocal groups into the 1960s, singing on television, in nightclubs and on records that sold millions, even as teenage rebellion, Elvis Presley and rock ′n’ roll transformed the music world. The fashion-conscious Christine chose the sisters’ matching wardrobes, Dorothy kept track of finances, and Phyllis did most of the talking for the trio. Their million-selling records included two No. 1 hits, “Sincerely” in 1955 and “Sugartime” in 1958. Like other white performers of their generation, they recorded what critics called blander (but often better-selling) covers of rhythm-and-blues hits by black artists. In 1965, Phyllis McGuire’s idealized image was shattered by a grand jury appearance that exposed her longtime affair with a Chicago mobster, Sam Giancana. By then, the sisters’ popularity had begun to fade, and in 1968 the trio broke up, Christine and Dorothy to raise families and Phyllis to perform solo. But they made a successful comeback in 1985, and went on to perform for almost two decades at casinos and clubs in Las Vegas, Atlantic City and elsewhere, capitalizing on the nostalgia of fans who aged with them. Their last gig was a 2004 PBS special, “Magic Moments: The Best of ’50s Pop.” Ruby Christine McGuire was born in Middletown, Ohio, on July 30, 1926, to Asa and Lillie (Fultz) McGuire. Her father was a steelworker and her mother a minister of the First Church of God in Miamisburg, Ohio. Christine, who rarely used her original first name, took piano lessons for eight years. She and her sisters began singing for weddings and other services at their mother’s church in 1935. They later sang at hospitals and military bases. Discovered on local television, they went to New York City and climbed to fame on Mr. Godfrey’s popular TV shows. They had their first Top 10 record, “Good Night, Sweetheart, Goodnight,” in 1954. Christine McGuire was married five times. Her marriage to Harold Ashcraft in 1942 ended in divorce in 1950. They had two sons, Harold and Asa. In 1952 she married John Teeter. They were divorced in 1962. Her 1967 marriage to Robert H. Spain, a financier, also ended in divorce. In 1993 she married George Rosenfeld, a restaurateur, who died in 1996. In 2002 she married David Mudd, a Long Island vintner, who died in 2011. Asa Ashcraft died at 68 in 2015. Dorothy McGuire died in 2012. Ms. McGuire is survived by her son, Harold Ashcraft; her sister, Phyllis; and many grandchildren and great-grandchildren. One grandchild, Cpl. Evan Asa Ashcraft, was killed in the Iraq war in 2003 when an Army vehicle he was in was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade near the northern city of Mosul. The McGuire Sisters performed for Presidents Richard M. Nixon, Gerald R. Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush and for Queen Elizabeth II. They entered the National Broadcasting Hall of Fame in 1994, the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2001 and the Hit Parade Hall of Fame in 2009. "

For its 34th annual induction ceremony on Friday night, at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, the hall opened the pantheon to Janet Jackson, Stevie Nicks, Radiohead, Def Leppard, the Cure, Roxy Music and the Zombies — a crop of respected acts that have each had a palpable impact on pop culture, and who arrived at the institution with a notable lack of controversy or internecine squabbles. But it was the women who left the strongest impression this year, and who made the most powerful statements at the microphone. Nicks, the first woman to be inducted twice — she was already in as a member of Fleetwood Mac — kicked off the ceremony with a rundown of her solo hits like “Stand Back” and “Edge of Seventeen,” and was joined by Don Henley for “Leather and Lace” and by Harry Styles for “Stop Dragging My Heart Around,” taking on Tom Petty’s vocals while strumming a Telecaster. True to her style persona, Nicks’s black-and-gold shawl flowed behind her, as her right hand clutched a microphone with a lacy glove. “What I am doing is opening up the door for other women to go, like, ‘Hey man, I can do it,” Nicks proclaimed in her speech. Before she came to the microphone, Styles — wearing a sky-blue double-breasted velvet suit — called her “the magical Gypsy godmother who occupies the in-between.” Jackson — introduced by the singer and actress Janelle Monáe as “the legendary queen of black girl magic” — did not perform. But she drew roars from throughout the arena as she described staking her own path apart from the dynasty of her famous brothers. “As the youngest in the family, I was determined to make it on my own,” Jackson said. “I wanted to stand on my own two feet. But never in a million years did I expect to follow in their footsteps. Tonight, your baby sister has made it in.” While Jackson spoke at length about her family, she didn’t mention one of the hottest topics of the past few months — “Leaving Neverland,” an HBO documentary about two men who say Michael Jackson sexually abused them as children; she never said Michael’s name. [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] And the boys? Def Leppard thanked their parents. Robert Smith of the Cure cut short his own speech to get to its performance. Bryan Ferry was apologetic for using his time at the microphone to name so many, many names, from fellow musicians to mastering engineers. “Quite a long list of bass players, I’m afraid,” Ferry said. And Radiohead was only partly present. Its leaders, the singer Thom Yorke and the guitarist Jonny Greenwood, have barely disguised their disinterest at the institution of the Rock Hall — “I don’t care,” Greenwood once said when Rolling Stone asked him about getting in — and so the five-man group was represented only by one of its guitarists, Ed O’Brien, and its drummer, Philip Selway. “We may not be the greatest musicians around, and we’re certainly not the most media friendly of bands,” Selway said. “But we have become very adept at being Radiohead, and when that connects with people it feels amazing.” In performance, Def Leppard played bad-boy pop-metal anthems like “Hysteria” and “Pour Some Sugar on Me” like a well-oiled machine, matching the musical strength of the band’s 1980s heyday, but without the strutting and stage leaps of its old videos. (But Phil Collen, the guitarist, looked like a toned street fighter as he played shirtless and with thick chains around his neck.) The Cure, representing the post-punk and 1980s indie-rock era, kept the crowd in rapt attention with a playlist that spanned hits like “Lovesong” and “Boys Don’t Cry,” as well as oddities like the song “A Forest” that are just as important to the group’s identity. In his speech introducing the band, Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails called the Cure his gateway to alternative and underground music in the ’80s, and marveled that Smith had used his “singular vision to create the rarest of things: a completely self-contained world with its own rules.” The night ended with a jam session featuring members of Def Leppard, the Zombies, Brian May of Queen (who inducted Def Leppard), Susanna Hoffs of the Bangles (who inducted the Zombies) and Ian Hunter of Mott the Hoople (who appeared to just be in the arena) singing along to that band’s 1972 hit “All the Young Dudes,” written by David Bowie. Highlights from the ceremony will be broadcast by HBO on April 27. In past years, the Rock Hall induction ceremony has often been marked by complaints and rants from artists; three years ago, Steve Miller called the induction process “unpleasant” and said he felt disrespected. This year the artists maintained a polite decorum, even when explaining their ambivalence about the institution. Speaking to reporters backstage, Smith said he was “not quite sure about the whole thing” and that his band had, in a way, “been subsumed into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.” But at the same time, Smith said, “there are so many people who have done this that I admire so hugely, who have inspired me so much, that it would be really, really wrong of me to be anything other than delighted.” The sharpest criticism was also the most encouraging, addressing the Rock Hall’s poor record of including women. According to one count, of the 888 people who have been inducted over the hall’s history, just 69 of them, or less than 8 percent, have been women. Wrapping up her speech, Jackson gave the hall a nudge. “Rock & Roll Hall of Fame,” she said, “2020 — please induct more women.” "
5c59ddec3a125f5075c08220,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/05/arts/music/charles-busch-native-new-yorker-cabaret.html,"Perched on a stool on the stage of Feinstein’s/54 Below, Charles Busch eased into the first bars of Diana Ross’s torchy 1973 hit “Touch Me in the Morning,” his voice soft and husky, his delivery relaxed but rueful. Busch became freshly enamored of the ballad after catching a YouTube audio clip of Peggy Lee singing it to a London audience as “this morose, tragic self-indictment,” he said admiringly. But when Busch performs it in his new show “Native New Yorker,” which opens Wednesday at the cabaret club, he won’t necessarily channel Lee or Ross — at least, not in the way he might have in the past. As an actor and writer, Busch is among the most prolific and influential drag artists of his generation, giving us memorable women (and men) in solo performance, and in plays and films such as “Vampire Lesbians of Sodom,” “Psycho Beach Party,” “Die Mommie Die” and “The Divine Sister.” Busch crafted genre parodies that transcended camp in their fantastical elements and their abiding affection for the classic films and grandes dames who inspired him. But in cabaret, a form Busch has dipped into at various points with his musical director Tom Judson, he began to question his approach. “I started doing it in drag because that’s how people know me,” said Busch, also known by Broadway audiences for writing the Tony-nominated hit “The Tale of the Allergist’s Wife.” “But I don’t have a drag persona like, say, RuPaul. I’d come here to 54 Below and they’d say, ‘Charles Busch!’ — and I’d come out looking like Arlene Dahl, then tell true stories about my life.” Starting about a year and a half ago, he thought, “Cabaret is about being real, and I’ve got to see what it’s like stripping off the veil.” The progression was part of a process that started six or seven years back, and coincided with “this terrible period of dissatisfaction and brutal self-assessment,” Busch said. “I’m normally a very resilient person, but I was in a bad mood for about a year and a half, feeling disappointed in my creative life.” In response, Busch “called in the Marines” — and rang a therapist he hadn’t seen in years. Later, “I took the radical move of actually taking some singing lessons. And you know, they work. I’d always approached songs as monologues, where it’s about the lyrics, and the melodies are Tom’s job,” he said. “I’ve had to learn that the composer also has something to offer, that the melody is also useful as a form of emotional expression.” In his last cabaret show, “My Kinda ’60s,” Busch looked back on his childhood and adolescence, paying homage to the aunt who raised him after his mother died. “Native New Yorker” features music from the following decade, “an interesting and sexy period for me, going from college to figuring out how I’ll somehow earn a living in theater and be true to who I am,” he said. The songs are culled from pop, film and Broadway, veering from Stephen Sondheim (“Pretty Woman,” “In Buddy’s Eyes”) to Henry Mancini (“Whistling Away the Dark”) to Rupert Holmes (“Widescreen”) and Jim Croce (“I Got a Name”). To develop his non-drag sartorial style, Busch, who describes himself as a “pretty conservative” dresser offstage, went back to his East Village roots and booked a show at the club Pangea in 2017. “I just wore a black shirt and black pants, and it felt great. Then I thought, am I so lacking in imagination in this gender-fluid age that I’m either in full drag or dressed as a waiter? So I had this young costume designer, Jimmy Johansmeyer, make me this man’s suit, a green paisley thing with rhinestone buttons. I would say it’s the place where Bruno Mars meets Judy at the Palace. There’s a place, you know?” Busch credits his longtime friend Julie Halston, a collaborator and muse in his earlier work, with helping him enter this next phase. “As people get older, there’s a lot more to deal with, and I think Charles has gotten more open to the idea that life is very big,” Halston said. Busch has also seen his impact on younger boundary-pushing artists, such as the Pulitzer Prize finalist Taylor Mac, whose own Broadway debut as a playwright, “Gary: A Sequel to Titus Andronicus,” is set to begin previews in April. “I guess I’ve given a boost to people, like Charles Ludlam did for me,” Busch said, noting that he was greatly moved when Jim Parsons cited Busch as a key influence in a Playbill article about last year’s revival of “The Boys in the Band.” But Busch added, “I think where drag is going right now is more outrageous, more in your face. For my generation, the word ‘drag queen’ was a slur on our professionalism. It’s so totally different today; younger performers — Jinkx Monsoon, Bianca Del Rio, Peppermint — honor that word, and have personae they can stay true to, and I think that’s fabulous.” And Busch has no plans to abandon drag in his primary vehicle for it, theater. Next January, Primary Stages will present his latest play, “The Confession of Lily Dare,” in which he’ll portray — as he did last year, in a staging at Theater for the New City — the titular heroine as she evolves, over decades, from a convent girl to a cabaret chanteuse to the madam of a string of brothels. “I wanted to see if we could have outrageous fun with these old movie conventions — the gauzy 1930s mother-love dramas — and get a sophisticated, ironic 2018 audience to be genuinely emotionally affected. And we really did it.” In “Native New Yorker,” Busch will again nod to the real “embattled woman” who stuck with him through the decade of struggle and adventure traced in the show, which ends with the 1985 Off Broadway opening of “Vampire Lesbians.” For “I Got a Name,” he took the unusual step of revising a lyric: “I sing, ‘And I carry it with me for my aunt to see,’” Busch said, then paused because he was getting choked up. “I was very fortunate to have someone who was always on my side,” he said. “I’ve been fortunate in every way.” "
5c3b1a383a125f5075c04240,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/13/arts/music/mute-r-kelly.html,"He has been accused of having sex with minors. At 27, he married a 15-year-old girl. Some women say he runs an emotionally abusive sex cult. But in more than two decades of persistent allegations, the R&B star at the center of them, R. Kelly, has never been convicted of a crime, and in no meaningful way has his career suffered. The #MuteRKelly campaign to punish him legally and commercially hopes to change that, receiving new life in recent days after a widely watched Lifetime documentary, “Surviving R. Kelly,” devoted six episodes to his history with women. Prosecutors in Chicago and Atlanta have started looking into Kelly’s conduct. “He uses his talent to prey on women, to abuse us,” Asante McGee, who appeared in the documentary, said in an interview. McGee said Kelly prohibited her from looking other men in the eye and required that she ask permission to leave her bedroom or go to the bathroom. “A regular person on the street couldn’t have gotten away with what he’s gotten away with.” [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] The documentary has had some early effect. Some radio stations have stopped playing his music, and a concert appearance in Illinois was canceled. But there are significant challenges to bringing a criminal case against Kelly, and various reasons his record label might decide to keep him on, even as calls for a reckoning grow louder. Among the longstanding allegations against Robert Kelly is that he has had sexual relationships with minors. Kelly, 52, has settled lawsuits dating back to the 1990s alleging he had sex with underage girls. More than 20 years ago, Vibe magazine questioned the validity of a marriage certificate showing that Kelly had married the singer Aaliyah when she was 18. She was actually 15, and the marriage was annulled. (Aaliyah died in a plane crash in 2001.) On ABC’s “Good Morning America” on Friday, Kelly’s lawyer, Steven Greenberg, threatened to sue Lifetime for defamation and said Kelly denied ever having a sexual relationship with someone under the age of consent. He said Kelly did not know that Aaliyah was 15 when they married. On Tuesday, Kimberly M. Foxx, the state’s attorney for Cook County, Ill., publicly asked any potential victims and witnesses to come forward, and prosecutors in Fulton County, Ga., where Kelly also has lived, have begun gathering information. Even so, any case could be difficult to try. It routinely takes people many years to come forward, by which time memories have faded and records have vanished. “These cases are hard because, typically, the crime occurs behind closed doors,” said Marci Hamilton, the founder of Child U.S.A., which proposes policies to address the sexual abuse of children. Kelly’s courtroom history might also, in a sense, raise the bar to put him on trial. In 2008, he was acquitted of child pornography charges despite a 27-minute video that prosecutors said showed him having sex with and urinating on a 13-year-old girl. But the girl in the video never testified, and Kelly’s lawyers successfully argued that her identity could not be proven. That experience could make prosecutors wary. “Sometimes there is a reluctance to go back,” said Paul Mones, a lawyer who represents victims who were abused as children. The more recent allegations against Kelly, many previously outlined by the music journalist Jim DeRogatis on BuzzFeed News, revolve around what has been described as a sex cult. Kelly is said to have exhibited almost total control over women who lived or traveled with him, dictating their movements, when they could eat and when they could go to the bathroom. Kelly’s lawyer told CBS that the women who lived with him were attracted to a “rock ’n’ roll life” and did so voluntarily. “They were perfectly consensual relationships,” Greenberg said. “Whatever occurred, I’m not someone who should be judging, nor should any of us be judging, someone’s personal relationships, what goes on in their bedrooms.” He called those who appeared on the documentary “a bunch of disgruntled people who are looking for their 15 minutes of TMZ fame.” Kelly’s accusers say he brainwashes the women into submission, but cases that involve psychological control can be exceptionally difficult to prove, lawyers say. Alan W. Scheflin, a professor emeritus at Santa Clara University School of Law, recalled a case in which someone was found to have been falsely imprisoned because their clothing was taken away and they would have had to flee naked. But he said that duress is usually considered to be something physical, like being locked in a basement. “It’s so horrible and so frustrating because there aren’t remedies focused specifically on this issue,” he said. Prosecutors can try to argue that a person is being illegally restrained when they have been threatened with harm if they leave. Federal prosecutors in New York have brought charges against the leaders of a group called Nxivm, alleging that they forced women into sexual slavery by demanding they turn over compromising material, such as sexually explicit photographs of themselves, as “collateral” that would be used against them if they left or spoke out publicly. (The leaders have also been charged with other crimes, including financial ones.) In an email, a lawyer for the group’s founder, Keith Raniere, said the government’s charges of sex trafficking and forced labor were “baseless and unprecedented.” In “Surviving R. Kelly,” a person identified as a former employee of Kelly’s said he would make women write false statements to incriminate themselves or their parents, saying they stole from him, for example. The former employee described those statements, and sex tapes Kelly recorded of the women, as a form of insurance to stop them from speaking out. Even if that were considered criminal, bringing a case is difficult without cooperating victims. The parents of one woman believed to be living with Kelly, Joycelyn Savage, say she is being held against her will, according to their lawyer, Gerald A. Griggs. But in a video interview published by TMZ in July, Savage said she was not Kelly’s captive and was “in a happy place with my life.” The Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office has said it has received calls about Kelly since Foxx made her public plea. Police officers went to Kelly’s home at Trump Tower in Chicago on Friday after receiving a tip that two women were being held there against their will. A spokeswoman for the department said two women were found who said they were there voluntarily. It is unclear what other reports the authorities have received. As public reaction to the documentary has grown, some radio stations have pledged to stop playing his music. According to Mediabase, which tracks terrestrial radio stations, plays of Kelly’s music have dropped, from more than 220 “spins” per day in recent months to less than 100 a few days after the documentary aired. And a concert Kelly was supposed to host in Springfield, Ill., in April had its application denied by the state because of security concerns spurred by anti-Kelly protests, The Chicago Tribune reported. Much attention has focused on Kelly’s record company, RCA, a division of Sony Music Entertainment. On Friday, the advocacy group UltraViolet flew a banner over RCA’s offices in Culver City, Calif., calling on the label to cancel its contract with the star. “It is long past time for RCA to dump R. Kelly and take a stand against abuse,” the group said in a statement. But neither RCA nor Sony has commented on the documentary, nor on the calls to end their relationship with Kelly. According to music industry lawyers and executives, the question of whether RCA will part ways with Kelly is less about if it has the right to cancel his contract than about if it wants to — and what it would cost the label. Dropping a well-known artist is not a decision any record company takes lightly, these executives said. And however much the company’s reputation may suffer now from keeping Kelly on its roster, RCA’s executives may be weighing the risks of being accused of censorship, or of jettisoning its contractual obligations. “The risks for RCA/Sony are glaringly obvious — subjecting themselves to public pressure, being viewed as condoning bad behavior, lacking sensitivity, and choosing money over integrity,” said Jeff Rabhan, the chairman of the Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music at New York University. But, Rabhan added: “Societal outrage is best demonstrated by simply not purchasing his music or tickets to his concerts. It would be ill-advised for RCA/Sony to make business decisions solely based upon a groundswell of current publicity and outrage surrounding the allegations.” Several executives pointed to the industry furor last year after Spotify instituted a vaguely articulated “hateful conduct” policy that appeared to largely affect black artists, including Kelly. The policy — which removed some artists’ work from official Spotify playlists — was canceled three weeks after it was announced. Then there is the question of Kelly’s many fans. By the end of Lifetime’s first broadcast of “Surviving R. Kelly,” daily streams of his songs in the United States more than doubled, according to Nielsen, from 1.9 million the day before the series began to 4.3 million on its last day. Kelly’s most recent RCA album was “12 Nights of Christmas” in 2016. Although his contract with RCA is private, and may in some ways still be governed by the deal he signed in 1991 with the Jive label, which is now owned by Sony, industry lawyers said the power imbalance of most artist contracts likely gives RCA many ways to cancel the deal. The label may be able to decline an option to extend Kelly’s most recent deal, and many contracts give the label a right to pay the artist a fee rather than release new material, known as “pay or play.” “You can always drop an artist,” said Elliot Groffman, a music lawyer in New York. “The only issue is what obligations you have to that artist if you drop them.” Although morals clauses are rare in record deals, several lawyers said, the severity of the accusations against Kelly, and the fact that prosecutors are looking into them, may let RCA argue that its association with Kelly has become damaging to the company, and give it a way out. Kelly could always accuse RCA of breaching its contract through “bad faith” — intentionally failing to fulfill its obligations — but that is unlikely, said Laurie L. Soriano, a music lawyer in Los Angeles. “I think no one would consider this a matter of bad faith,” Soriano said, “given the situation we are talking about.” "

5c9941f149f0eacbf105ef73,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/25/arts/music/big-ears-festival-best-music.html,"KNOXVILLE, Tenn. — The Big Ears Festival started 10 years ago, disappeared, returned, reorganized as a nonprofit and has quietly grown year by year, filling theaters, clubs and galleries in downtown Knoxville. About 18,000 people attended this year’s festival from March 21-24. Rejecting musical genre classifications and spurning descriptions like “avant-garde” or “experimental,” Big Ears has never spelled out its aesthetic guidelines, and by now it doesn’t have to. It draws an audience that’s curious and ready to listen intently. The Big Ears lineup this year encompassed rock (Spiritualized, Mercury Rev), jazz (the Art Ensemble of Chicago, Bill Frisell, Mary Halvorson, Tim Berne), contemporary classical music (Bryce Dessner, Anna Thorvaldsdottir), string-band music (Punch Brothers, Bela Fleck), free improvisation (Evan Parker, Susie Ibarra), a folk opera (Rachel Grimes’s “The Way Forth”), a ballet (“Lucy Negro Redux”), silent films with live scores and a midnight-to-noon drone marathon that changed performers every half-hour. It featured multiple concerts of music by the pioneering Minimalist composers Alvin Lucier and Harold Budd; it celebrated the unconventional vocal techniques of the singers Joan La Barbara and Meredith Monk. It honored the 50th anniversary of the jazz-and-beyond label ECM Records and it gathered luminaries from Chicago’s “Great Black Music” collective, the Association for the Advancement of Creative Music. Instead of sales metrics or star power, Big Ears contemplates the perceptual properties of music: shades of dissonance and consonance, the particular qualities of a drone, the ever-changing applications of subtlety and brute force. There was music to soothe, music to jolt, music to ponder and music to dance to. Here are 15 of the most intriguing performers and performances. The English musician Shabaka Hutchings brought two of his groups to Big Ears, both of them built around his fat-toned, indefatigable tenor saxophone with beats derived from dance music and — his far-from-secret resource — carnival rhythms (he has Barbadian roots). He allows himself an extended solo now and then, but most of the time he pumps out short, hard riffs, all sinew and drive. Sons of Kemet is a four-piece band: just Hutchings, two drummers, and a tuba player who occupies the entire low register. It was muscular enough, but a late-night club set by The Comet Is Coming — Hutchings, a drummer, and a keyboardist who cranked up distorted rave bass lines — was so forceful it set off a mosh pit. The Canadian composer Kara-Lis Coverdale has released diverse albums of electronic music; she has also worked since her teens as a church organist. She used the pipe organ at the Church Street United Methodist Church for an eerie 47-minute piece that started with one of the very highest notes of the organ, alone: a keening whistle from somewhere far out of reach. Much of the piece stayed in those distant realms, sustaining tones beyond the power of human breath and letting tentative melodies hang in midair. She barely touched upon the earthy heft available in the organ’s lower register; this was an elevated, disembodied contemplation, patiently celestial. When punk had barely dawned, This Heat was already post-punk. From its start in 1976, This Heat was a contrarian band, dispensing corrosive noise, intricate math-rock patterns and cryptic, often politically charged lyrics. Two of its founders, Charles Bullen (on guitar) and Charles Hayward (on drums), revived the band’s repertoire in 2016 with This Is Not This Heat. Its Big Ears set was utterly precise in its cantankerousness, from the electronic screeching that ushered the band onstage to songs that blared and stopped cold, droned steadily or crashed and flailed, and set the Declaration of Independence to Arab-tinged reggae (in “Independence”); the songs’ bristling cynicism defies obsolescence. Big Ears, the group announced, would be its next-to-last show. Strictly speaking, Artifacts Trio — Nicole Mitchell on flute, Tomeka Reid on cello and Mike Reed on drums — started as a cover band. In 2015, the 50th anniversary of the Association for the Advancement of Creative Music, the trio revived compositions from the multitude of albums the association’s members have released: some swinging, some introspective, some textural. The lean, straightforward trio format and the tricky but frisky repertoire made an ideal showcase for Mitchell’s prodigious, playful virtuosity and Reid’s double duties of propulsion and melodic counterpoint. Playing solo classical guitar in ways that blur easy classifications of folk or jazz, Ralph Towner makes it seem as if his music were inventing itself on the spot. Phrases of melody appear in fluctuating tempos, as if they just occurred to him, soon followed by knotty chords that instantly recast the tune; swinging rhythms arise, take over for a while, then melt away. Each detail arrives as a discovery, though it’s clear that Towner has deep structure behind his spontaneity. He unveiled some brand-new pieces, and he cheerfully noted his recovery from triple-bypass surgery by playing a standard: “My Foolish Heart.” The methodical turns exhilarating in the music of Nik Bärtsch and his quartet, Ronin. Bärtsch starts with patterns — often a terse little riff in an odd meter — that get stacked up in countless ways, ricocheting from keyboard to bass clarinet to drums to electric bass, getting subdivided or having multiple instruments suddenly pile on. The repetition comes from Minimalism, the rhythmic flair from jazz and the unabashed impact from rock as all the parts click into place. Since the 1960s, Richard Thompson has been writing songs that face the bleak realities of mortality and hard luck. Backed by a string orchestra, he performed “K.I.A.: Killed in Action,” a set of songs about World War I based on letters and diaries from the era. It was somber, detailed and unflinching, with the strings as full participants. When Thompson sang “Gas,” about soldiers confronting poison gas for the first time, sustained strings switched to brittle pizzicato, conveying the sudden feeling of being unable to breathe. Lonnie Holley, a widely collected sculptor and painter from Alabama, started recording music in 2006 and released his first album in 2012, when he was 62. His voice is a bluesy, otherworldly moan with a hint of Sam Cooke and an occasional growl; his songs are verbal and musical improvisations, ruminating on the state of the world and the state of his soul. The Messthetics backed him on Friday afternoon with leisurely vamps topped by echoey keyboard and guitar as he sang about a fallen angel and about trying to reach the doorknob to heaven. His family once hoped Holley would be a preacher; between songs, he warned about a digital landscape where the “playground of foolishness” soon leads to the “quicksand field of stupidity.” All dressed in white, Meredith Monk and her four-woman ensemble of singers, dancers and musicians performed “Cellular Songs,” a collection of pieces that contemplates both biological cells and musical ones: the little cyclical figures that Monk assembles into compositions. With wordless syllables and occasional lyrics, and vocal styles suggesting a world of allusions, the songs hinted at games and rituals, with hints of comedy, and a group embrace at the end became an affirmation of solidarity. For decades, the Art Ensemble of Chicago was a close-knit quintet, until the deaths of some founding members. But at Big Ears, the Art Ensemble — still including its founder Roscoe Mitchell on alto saxophone and its longtime drummer, Famoudou Don Moye — appeared with more than a dozen musicians, including strings, brass, theremin, a singer (Rodolfo Cordova-Lebron) and a poet (Moor Mother). Its set was just as sprawling, touching on improvisational orchestral squall, dissonant chamber-jazz, a kind of parlor song and a musical jungle full of birdcalls. Its best moments were its most focused ones: swinging vamps propelled by Moye’s drumming, pointedly political poetry declaimed by Moor Mother — her “We Are on the Edge” is the title of an Art Ensemble album due April 26 — and a perpetual-motion tour-de-force by Mitchell, using circular breathing for a stretch of nonstop piping and squealing and scurrying that insisted, without a word, that after 50 years the Art Ensemble isn’t finished. Harold Budd’s compositions are often sparse and meditative, contemplating a handful of notes reverberating into silence. In a concert featuring new pieces, a small ensemble of instruments including harp, orchestral chimes, keyboard and cymbal shared momentary clusters of notes or fleeting motifs, like bits of crystal briefly catching the light. How would Josiah Wise, who records as serpentwithfeet, turn his studio-constructed, intricately overdubbed, often mournful and tormented songs into live performances? Two ways: with impassioned live vocals over prerecorded tracks and in solo piano versions. The canned music barely impeded the emotional power of his more drum-driven songs, and when he was at the piano, the songs shaded in and out of droll, spoken-sung monologues. As he courted singalongs, self-questioning turned into self-acceptance. A composer who has been working with electronics and samples since the 1970s, Carl Stone delivered a disorienting barrage from his laptop: bristling, relentlessly repetitive, stereo-hopping, rhythmic but dance-defying tracks that were so densely layered they seemed to raise the atmospheric pressure in the club. The new-music string quartet Brooklyn Rider has been collaborating for a decade with Kayhan Kalhor, who was born in Iran and plays the classical Persian spike fiddle called the kamancheh. They’ve learned from each other, with Brooklyn Rider picking up Persian inflections and bowing techniques and Kalhor adapting a traditional solo style to move in and out of the string ensemble. Their shared pieces orchestrated the kamancheh’s bite, and its echoes of ancient melodies, with harmonies and arrangements that extend and stoke the drama. No one can say Nils Frahm didn’t have enough equipment. He had two nests of multiple keyboards onstage for a solo show, and he used them all strategically: starting with toy-piano sounds and escalating through track upon track of keyboards and electronics, little melodies and blipping rhythm loops, showily adding each layer. When he settled down to a piano, the music drooped into new-age territory, but his hyperactive one-man-band act kept things popping. "
5cb0b3d249f0eacbf1f83649,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/12/arts/music/american-composers-orchestra-review.html,"In 2015, Khaled Jarrar, a Palestinian artist and filmmaker living in Ramallah, read an ad in a local newspaper. It was an appeal for assistance placed by a refugee from the war in Syria who was stuck with her family in Istanbul — including the writer’s elderly mother, who was a refugee for the second time, having been forced to leave Nazareth for Syria during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. Moved by the story, Mr. Jarrar spent 31 days traveling with the family to Germany, living as a refugee and filming the journey. This experience inspired “Where We Lost Our Shadows,” a multimedia work for orchestra, video and three soloists that Mr. Jarrar created with the composer Du Yun. The American Composers Orchestra, which commissioned it with Carnegie Hall, played the premiere on Thursday at Zankel Hall. Ms. Du and Mr. Jarrar decided to broaden the work’s focus to encompass timeless themes of human migration, exodus and refugee flights. Ms. Du, who won the Pulitzer Prize in Music for her 2016 opera “Angel’s Bone,” an allegory of human trafficking, turned to the heritage of ragas, a structure for melodic improvisation that itself migrated over centuries throughout Arab, Central Asian and Indo-Pakistani regions. Working with the Pakistani vocalist Ali Sethi, she chose ragas dealing with themes of water, rain and thunder; these raga-inspired passages were sung by Mr. Sethi on Thursday with both rawness and plaintive delicacy. These elements are integrated into a score that shifts and heaves, qualities captured in the restless performance led by George Manahan. There are stretches of misty orchestral sonorities in which fidgety figurations get batted around over dense harmonies. Shayna Dunkelman, a dynamic percussionist, drove episodes of the piece with pummeling drum bursts one moment, tingling effects the next. The vocalist Helga Davis brought radiance to Ms. Du’s tender, high-pitched setting of the Palestinian poet Ghassan Zaqtan’s “Pillow.” In the accompanying film, we see images of a family traveling at nighttime on stony paths; women in hijab emerging from shelter underground; and endearing short scenes of children trying to be hopeful as they talk of heading to Germany or Sweden. But overall the footage is murky, atmospheric, even abstract — which actually enhances its power. The program opened with an intensely focused performance of Morton Feldman’s “Turfan Fragments” (1980), inspired by knotted carpets discovered on an archaeological expedition in East Turkestan. They struck Feldman as a metaphor for his music, which tends to unfold in subdued bits and chunks — wheezing sonorities, pungent cluster chords, repetitive figures — that only suggest a larger structure. Mr. Manahan also led a vibrant account of Gloria Coates’s Symphony No. 1, “Music for Open Strings” (1974), a work that uses some unusual tunings and the notes of a Chinese scale in a compact four movements. The music abounds in swaying riffs, bare melodic ideas, dramatic glissandos and stretches of perky, twanging energy. "
5ca7278449f0eacbf1f811d6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/05/arts/music/george-walker-sinfonia-visions-seattle-symphony.html,"SEATTLE — Last fall, the Smithsonian’s National Portrait Gallery began to display, among its recent acquisitions, a photograph of the composer George Walker. It shows him close up, his right index finger and thumb bearing down on a pencil with the precision of a surgeon, at work on the manuscript score of his Sinfonia No. 5. The image of Dr. Walker, who died last summer at the age of 96, was captured by the photographer and filmmaker Frank Schramm, a close friend. They had known each other since Mr. Schramm heard a broadcast of Dr. Walker’s Sinfonia No. 3 in 2004 and, he said, “immediately gravitated to his work.” Living within a couple of miles of Dr. Walker in New Jersey, Mr. Schramm would pay regular visits to his house in Montclair — helping out with errands and at the same time using his camera to document his life and work, right up to the end. “George was 81 when I met him, so there was already a sense of time running out,” Mr. Schramm said. “But he was so focused. We would listen to and discuss music. It became like an unsolicited master class for me.” Just two months before his death, Dr. Walker had been keenly anticipating the opportunity to experience Sinfonia No. 5, “Visions,” in a concert hall, Mr. Schramm recalled. He was looking forward to the first live performance, which will be given by the Seattle Symphony Orchestra on April 11. (A studio recording, made in 2017, is available on Albany Records.) The piece, which was completed in 2016, in part conveys Mr. Walker’s response to the 2015 shooting at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C. “He looked back and saw the other work he had done and thought this could be the last one,” said Gregory Walker, the older of Dr. Walker’s two sons. “And he felt an urgency about getting it out there.” “Visions” crowns a long career in which Dr. Walker produced more than 90 compositions, including intimate pieces for solo piano (his primary instrument), and large-scale orchestral and choral works. It was the last score he completed; at the time of his death, he had embarked on a piece commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Amid impassioned debates about the canon and its exclusion of historically marginalized voices, his remarkably individual and intricately crafted musical voice is long overdue for discovery. “George was very proficient,” Mr. Schramm said. “His house became his think-tank, with his work at the center. He knew what he had.” But it was frustrating, he added, for Dr. Walker to repeatedly face difficulty in getting orchestras to program his work. A longtime passionate advocate has been Peter Kermani, a former chairman of what is now the League of American Orchestras and the founder of Albany Records. In the mid-1980s, when he first encountered Dr. Walker’s music, he was attracted to “the lack of sweetness and treacle that a lot of American works had.” “Right from the beginning, that was a distinguishing feature of George’s music,” Mr. Kermani added. “I think he was breaking new ground. I felt he should be given every opportunity on the planet to get his music performed and heard.” The Seattle Symphony’s performance may signal the beginning of a fresh wave of interest. In 2016, Mr. Schramm recalled, Dr. Walker was encouraged by a meeting with the conductor Simon Rattle, who expressed interest in performing his music in Europe. Dr. Walker’s early “Lyric for Strings” became his first piece to be programmed at the BBC Proms when the Chineke! Orchestra performed it shortly after his death last year. During the past two decades, Mr. Kermani has released a multivolume series of Dr. Walker’s orchestral works on the Albany label, along with albums documenting the composer’s earlier career as a concert pianist. He introduced Dr. Walker to the English-born conductor and pianist Ian Hobson, a specialist in mid-20th-century American orchestral music who had made numerous recordings with the Sinfonia Varsovia of Poland. Mr. Hobson described Dr. Walker as “a composer of great integrity: uncompromising in the best sense of the word, who doesn’t pander to anything.” While still trying to place “Visions” with an orchestra, Dr. Walker arranged to have it recorded by Mr. Hobson and the Varsovia Symphony — the final installment of Mr. Hobson’s cycle of his Sinfonias, each of which is a compact, single-movement composition. (“Visions,” with a duration of about 18 minutes, is the longest of them.) “Visions” Mr. Hobson said, is “complex and built of small cells of harmonic patterns and melodic groupings,” adding that “sometimes the detail is knotty and gnarly — and deliberately so — and sometimes unexpected beauties emerge from his extremely sensitive ear for color.” Dr. Walker’s son Gregory — a teacher at the University of Colorado, Boulder, and a former concertmaster of the Boulder Philharmonic Orchestra — said that the piece, which includes spoken text, is striking for the new ground it breaks in orchestral writing. “He wasn’t worried about whether it would be comprehensible immediately,” Gregory Walker said. “It’s an idealistic vision of what this combination of music and text and imagery could achieve.” George Walker was born in 1922, into an arts-loving family in Washington. His father, an immigrant from Jamaica, ran a medical practice from their home and organized his own research groups with colleagues. (At the time, the American Medical Association didn’t grant membership to black doctors.) His mother, a singer, encouraged his precocious talent for music with piano lessons — and did the same for his younger sister, Frances Walker-Slocum, who became the first black woman granted tenure at Oberlin College. Dr. Walker started attending Oberlin at 14, focusing on piano and organ before beginning graduate studies at the Curtis Institute of Music. He envisioned a career as a concert pianist and made his debut in 1945 at Town Hall in New York, as the first black instrumental soloist there. A few weeks later, he achieved the same milestone with the Philadelphia Orchestra as the soloist in Rachmaninoff’s Third Piano Concerto. Despite critical acclaim, Dr. Walker was able to secure only a fraction of the number of engagements that came readily to his white peers. He turned instead to an academic career, while at the same time channeling his creative drive into composition. To improve his keyboard skills at Curtis, he undertook composition studies. (The title of his memoir, “Reminiscences of an American Composer and Pianist,” reflects how fundamental both identities remained for him.) Dr. Walker studied with the storied mentor Rosario Scalero, who also taught Samuel Barber, and spent a period in Paris with Nadia Boulanger. She encouraged him, and with a new focus on composition, he cultivated a distinctively laconic style purged of excess and meticulously designed from meaningful gestures. In 1996, Dr. Walker won the Pulitzer Prize for “Lilacs,” a commission from the Boston Symphony Orchestra that set portions of Walt Whitman’s Lincoln elegy “When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom’d.” But the recognition that came with that and other honors did not erase his experience of struggling to get his music heard by the public. Responding to The New York Times about the Pulitzer news, Dr. Walker revealed the boldly self-reliant attitude he had used to cope with the constant institutional roadblock of racism: “I strongly felt if I continued to press for what I hoped to achieve, I would achieve it.” Being the first black composer to win the music Pulitzer became something of a double-edged sword. Invariably, like a Homeric epithet, it has become the phrase regularly used to introduce him as a composer. “He has been advertised as this African-American statesman who is supposed to be representing all the potential that has been neglected in the black community,” Gregory Walker said, “yet doesn’t follow the trends or fit cleanly into any category of contemporary music.” George Walker’s guiding philosophy, his son added, was that everyone is an individual, and his music was “proof of how individual things can be.” “He saw himself as an extension of great artists of the past, using their compositional techniques, idioms, instruments and aesthetics — and his love of Beethoven and Romantic-era composers,” Gregory Walker said. “He transformed all of that into something that was himself.” Not a programmatic composer by inclination, George Walker began work on “Visions” before the Charleston massacre occurred. But, when he learned what had happened, he became determined to introduce a layer that pays tribute to the victims. Brief, elliptical texts he wrote are assigned to five solo speakers; even though they are not sung parts, the score specifies their approximate ranges (a soprano, a tenor, two baritones and a bass). Along with these textual elements, the music includes several brief — and, in typical fashion, rather hidden — quotations from famous songs like “Drink to Me Only With Thine Eyes” and “I Dream of Jeannie,” as well as the hymn “Rock of Ages” and the spiritual “Swing Low, Sweet Chariot”). The texts are elusive, acquiring disquieting ambiguity when juxtaposed with a video that Mr. Schramm created at Dr. Walker’s request. The video, which begins about midway through “Visions,” contains images of ocean scenes filmed on the Atlantic Coast along with close-ups of photographs documenting the slave trade in Charleston. “It emphasizes the mystery that this was the same ocean that brought the slaves over,” Mr. Schramm said, “and of the past, present and future of the water, which is very dark.” During what turned out to be Dr. Walker’s final year, Elena Dubinets, the vice president of artistic planning and creative projects at the Seattle Symphony, came across interviews in which he had discussed “Visions.” When arrangements for the premiere elsewhere fell through, she expressed interest in having it in Seattle. She found a place for the piece on a program with Dvorak’s “New World” Symphony, conducted by the orchestra’s new music director, Thomas Dausgaard. “We wanted to juxtapose two very different views on our country,” Ms. Dubinets said, “a romanticized European perspective on the American culture combining different worlds into a new one that suited Euro-American colonizers, and an internal perspective coming from an African-American composer terrified by the shocking massacre in Charleston more than 120 years later.” "
5cb4a2f149f0eacbf1f84366,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/15/arts/music/jack-quartet-elliott-carter-review.html,"It feels a little cruel to be reporting how good the JACK Quartet’s concert on Sunday afternoon was. After all, it won’t be repeated any time soon, at least not in New York. And few people saw it; the Morgan Library & Museum’s Gilder Lehrman Hall was far from full. But JACK’s performance, a head-spinning marathon of Elliott Carter’s five string quartets, two and a half hours of notoriously thorny music, was one of the most eye-opening and exhilarating concerts I’ve heard all season. The fearless JACK players — Christopher Otto and Austin Wulliman, violins; John Pickford Richards, viola; and Jay Campbell, cello — will continue to offer Carter à la carte. And, in an email, they said a recording of the full set is on the way. But rarely are these works presented together, live. (Die-hard fans on Sunday reminisced about hearing the Pacifica Quartet do all five; that was over a decade ago.) The marathon approach isn’t simply a flex of endurance and technique, though JACK was virtually infallible on both counts. It’s also a window into how Carter’s attitude about the nature of quartets evolved through his lifetime. And what a lifetime: The year he was born, 1908, Mahler’s Seventh Symphony had its premiere; the year he died, 2012, brought Caroline Shaw’s “Partita.” Theodore Roosevelt was his first president; Barack Obama, his last. He finished his final work just months before his death, at 103. The string quartets date from 1950 to ’95. On Sunday, JACK didn’t present them in chronological order — which doesn’t really matter. If Carter’s output has a through line of progress, it’s a fuzzy one. He was more interested in novelty; he once said that every piece he wrote was “a kind of crisis in my life.” Each of his quartets is a singular interrogation of the form. The Fifth (1995) is where the Morgan program began. This deeply human piece — made all the more so by JACK’s interpretation, which teased out the expressiveness that critics have sometimes said Carter’s music lacks — is like a love letter to the art of chamber music. With hazy harmonics, crunchy rolled chords and metallic plucks, the series of short movements and interludes conjures rehearsal conversations in which someone offers an idea or a demonstration of how a passage should be played, and the rest respond. The final measure, a violinist’s harmonious double stop, suggests eventual agreement. Next was the Pulitzer Prize-winning Quartet No. 2 (1959), in which each player is given an individual strand of melodies, harmonic intervals and rhythms that develops throughout the 22-minute work. Imagine “Twitter: The Quartet,” with each voice brazenly independent, stubbornly struggling to be heard above the fray. It’s impressive that the JACK musicians, with conflicting characters to portray, remained so tightly together; it’s miraculous that they did so while barely signaling to one another with eye contact or gestures. (Then again, this is an ensemble that specializes in performing Georg Friedrich Haas’s music in total darkness.) I’m surprised the Second Quartet wasn’t immediately followed by the Fourth (1986), which feels like a sequel — but a utopian one, in which the players decide on a compromise between individuality and the common good. At 45 minutes, Carter’s rhapsodic Quartet No. 1 (1950-51) is the longest of the bunch, a cri de coeur of a composer breaking free from what he, in his writings, described as “my professional and social responsibility to write interesting, direct, easily understood music.” But, for all its intellectual rigor, this work has heart hiding under the surface. And humor, as when vibrato-rich sostenuto in the violins is interrupted by a belching low note from the cello. The Third Quartet (1971), which also won the Pulitzer, calls for dividing the ensemble into two duos, facing one another. On one side were Mr. Otto and Mr. Campbell, with a rubato attitude as they navigated the progress of four distinct musical characters; on the other, Mr. Wulliman and Mr. Richards, their rhythm more regular, offering six contrasting characters. It’s a lot to take in for an audience. Just imagine what it’s like for the players. These Carter works are brutal tests of an ensemble’s skill and stamina. On Sunday, the JACK passed. Times five. "
5c9fcf6349f0eacbf19fb3e5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/30/arts/music/rolling-stones-mick-jagger.html,"The Rolling Stones said on Saturday that Mick Jagger required medical treatment for an unspecified health problem and that the band would postpone its spring tour in the United States and Canada. Jagger’s doctors advised him not to go on the remaining 17 shows of the tour but expected him to make a “complete recovery,” according to a statement from the band. Jagger, 75, apologized to fans. “I really hate letting you down like this,” he said in a tweet. “I’m devastated for having to postpone the tour but I will be working very hard to be back on stage as soon as I can.” The band, which got its start more than five decades ago, performed the first two legs of its “No Filter” tour in Europe during fall 2017 and spring 2018. The final leg of the tour was scheduled to take the band through American cities including Miami, Houston, Denver and Chicago, as well as a venue north of Toronto. The Stones were scheduled to play at New Orleans Jazz Festival in May. The statement from the band suggested that the shows would be rescheduled and recommended that fans hold on to their tickets. Jagger is not the first 1960s-era music icon to show signs of slowing down in old age. In February, the rock guitarist Peter Frampton announced that he had a degenerative muscle disease that could slow his fingers and his ability to move around; he said he would be staging a farewell tour. And last year, two major figures in the ’60s folk revival, Paul Simon and Joan Baez, played farewell concerts. John Covach, a professor of music at the University of Rochester who has taught a course on the band, said that because the Stones remain a rock institution, they had been able to tour as much as they wanted in recent years and still pack stadiums and arenas. But these demanding and exhausting international tours can take a toll. “Who can tour around the country when they’re 70 or 75 years old?” he said on Saturday. He said that for avid fans of the Stones or other landmark ’60s bands, many of whom are baby boomers, news of farewell tours and rock stars dying of natural causes can remind them of their own mortality. “It forces a lot of fans to come to terms with the fact that this music from their youth, the people who produced it, are passing from the scene,” he said.

Its collapse was witnessed in real time on social media, providing a source of seemingly endless schadenfreude. But there was more to the story.

5c80318349f0eacbf105bb20,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/06/arts/music/review-bryce-dessner-robert-mapplethorpe-triptych.html,"LOS ANGELES — Robert Mapplethorpe’s photographs are pristine and painful, witty and wicked, forbidding and seductive. The mild-mannered Bryce Dessner is not the first composer I would have thought of to set them to music. Mr. Dessner — whose hourlong meditation on Mapplethorpe, “Triptych (Eyes of One on Another),” had its premiere at Walt Disney Concert Hall here on Tuesday before touring worldwide — achieved fame as a member of the rock band the National, and has sought a parallel career in the concert hall. Mellow and unobtrusive, with a heavy debt to Minimalism and its rock-infused progeny, his music is at its best when he’s his own softly suggestive electric guitar soloist. And on a small scale — a bright, vivid set of “Murder Ballades” (2013); the gentle percussion solo “Tromp Miniature” (2014) — his work can be charming. Longer pieces, though conscientiously constructed, tend to go prettily nowhere. (The New York Philharmonic will play “Wires” in November.) Mr. Dessner was a teenager in Cincinnati in 1990 when a Mapplethorpe exhibition that traveled there, “The Perfect Moment,” became caught up in a classic culture-war conflagration over censorship and government support for the arts. The city’s Contemporary Arts Center and its director faced obscenity charges; they were acquitted in a trial viewed as a victory for free speech. “The Perfect Moment” drew from three Mapplethorpe portfolios: “X” (images of gay S&M activity), “Y” (flower studies) and “Z” (nude portraits of black men). This tripartite structure in turn suggested a form for “Triptych,” which very loosely moves from a mythologizing overture (“it was said he had face of a god / yet some saw a demon with rope shoes”) to reflections on the obscenity trial and issues of race in his work. The elliptical libretto, by Korde Arrington Tuttle, draws on texts by the poet Essex Hemphill, who argued that Mapplethorpe continued a long tradition of objectifying black bodies, and by Patti Smith, whose book “Just Kids” is a memoir of her friendship with the artist. The language is stylized and extravagantly poetic, matching the photographs’ explicit sexual content while meeting their cool elegance with punk Romanticism (“worship the almighty / target practice / tells me to flex / tighten my torso”). These texts, while occasionally overwrought, do evoke the brew of objectification, glorification, aggression, submission, risk and reward in Mapplethorpe’s photographs, particularly those of black men. The words are not always easy on the artist; they draw an uncomfortable parallel between different meanings of “shooting” someone, and, in one section constructed as a dialogue, suggest Mapplethorpe exploited his models. It’s heady, ambitious stuff. But Mr. Dessner, perhaps treading cautiously as a white composer in a potential racial minefield, keeps the music — performed by 10 vocalists and 10 instrumentalists — resolutely lukewarm. He mines the vocal ensemble Roomful of Teeth for close harmonies, undergirding their singing with a wan wash of strings, the barest touch of propulsion. (The Los Angeles Philharmonic’s New Music Group was conducted by Sara Jobin.) The tenor Isaiah Robinson, a featured soloist, made soulful wails; his voice was richer, the emotion in it both plainer and more complex, than that of mezzo-soprano Alicia Hall Moran, his female counterpart. There was little sense of this blandly brooding, affectlessly luminous score shifting as the libretto did, leaving the words — only a handful of which were audible, with murky amplification partly to blame — adrift. The music can’t match the words’ nuanced portrayal of Mapplethorpe’s vision and personality, reducing the work’s impact to dreary sanctification. (I could have done without the facile queer utopianism of the finale: “Every time we kiss / we confirm the new world coming.”) A slideshow of Mapplethorpe’s images was projected on a screen above the ensemble during the performance, and a young black actor moved slowly around the stage. These are perhaps suggestions of the fuller production of “Triptych” (directed by Kaneza Schaal, who replaced the originally announced Daniel Fish) that will have its premiere on March 15 in Ann Arbor, Mich., and travel to the Brooklyn Academy of Music in June. A fleshed-out production may well enliven the piece. But if the music isn’t propelling the drama, visuals will ultimately always be window dressing. I know critics aren’t supposed to review performances that existed only in our imaginations. But on the drive home from Disney Hall, my mind kept wandering to what the composer Georg Friedrich Haas might have done with this material. Known for plunging his players and audiences alike into long, disconcerting stretches of total darkness, Mr. Haas is gifted at sonic evocations of control, oppression and extremity; his work shares the classicism of Mapplethorpe’s work, and its brutality. These indelible photographs deserve better music than Mr. Dessner’s thin, earnest worship. "

This simple act of courtesy is the mission of Phil the Hall, the New York Philharmonic’s new initiative to reach out to a wide array of dedicated New Yorkers, including emergency medical workers, public service professionals and volunteers, and welcome them to special programs offering $5 tickets and general-admission seating. The Philharmonic contacted some 30 organizations, including Coalition for the Homeless, El Centro del Inmigrante, the Bowery Mission, New Women New Yorkers, God’s Love We Deliver and Queens Public Library. So David Geffen Hall was packed for the first concert on Thursday. The New York City Fire Department alone requested more than 1,000 tickets for the combined four performances. In her opening remarks, Deborah Borda, the Philharmonic’s president, welcomed everyone “to our house.” Yet, “from now on,” she said, hopefully, “you feel that this is your house, too.” For the Dutch-born Jaap van Zweden, in his first season as the Philharmonic’s music director, Phil the Hall offers a chance to introduce himself. The program he led, which lasted 75 minutes without intermission, combined works that showed the diversity of classical music, like Steven Stucky’s somberly beautiful “Elegy” from the 2008 oratorio “August 4, 1964,” and a few greatest hits, like the insistent first movement of Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony and Wagner’s exhilarating “Ride of the Valkyries,” performed here to the hilt. The orchestra chose an ideal host for the occasion, Nia Imani Franklin, a former Miss New York and the current Miss America. A trained soprano, Ms. Franklin also has a master’s degree in musical composition and is using her platform to advocate for arts education. [Check out our Culture Calendar here.] It was a great idea to include premieres of shorts works by two participants in the Philharmonic’s Very Young Composers program: Paloma Dineli Chesky and Mack Scocca-Ho, who are both 11 years old. Ms. Chesky’s “Rising,” an inspirational song, was written during a period of family difficulties, she told the audience. The music is meant to show that no matter the challenge, you can rise above it. She sang the soaring melody as the orchestra backed her with swaying strings and glistening percussion. Mr. Scocca-Ho’s “Ociantrose” is named for the capital of a made-up country where unity and order come from the people and are not imposed from above, he said in introducing the work. The music is brassy and industrious, with Baroque-like strands of crisscrossing lines, though the busyness gets interrupted by rhythmic disruptions. Mr. van Zweden led lively accounts of Bernstein’s Overture to “Candide” and Copland’s “Hoe-Down,” from “Rodeo.” The orchestra was joined by the Westminster Symphonic Choir for an ardent performance of Copland’s “The Promise of Living” from the opera “The Tender Land” and also the final work, Beethoven’s “Ode to Joy,” a very truncated version of the finale from the Ninth Symphony. Before conducting the ode, Mr. van Zweden said that Beethoven’s symphony is about “bringing the community together,” which is “what we did with you tonight.” "

The singer is the daughter of Bobby McFerrin, the jazz vocalist, and the granddaughter of Robert McFerrin, Sr., the first black man to sing at the Metropolitan Opera. Ms. McFerrin, 27, a graduate of Berklee College of Music, is currently working on a non-a cappella record with her brother, musician/producer Taylor McFerrin. She is also finishing up a residency at C’Mon Everybody in Brooklyn; her final performance there will be Jan. 30. Ms. McFerrin lives in Bedford-Stuyvesant with her boyfriend and manager, Ned Levy. On Sundays, they try not to stray far from their kitchen. WRITE IT DOWN Usually Sundays are a late start. I don’t get up until 10:30 or 11, depending on how long I was out the night before. The first thing I do is write in my journal. Lots of times I’ll write about my dreams, or what I want to do that day, or how the day before went. EGGS EITHER WAY If I make breakfast, I’m going to make something like potatoes and poached eggs and avocado. But sometimes I like to go out, to this spot called Brown Butter in the neighborhood. They have a breakfast sandwich on a biscuit there that’s really, really good. I think it’s eggs and avocado. Sometimes I’ll get bacon on it but not all the time. DEPENDING ON MOOD If I’m feeling like I want to be around people, I might go to a museum, maybe hit up the Whitney or the Brooklyn Museum. I don’t do that enough. Most of the time I’ll come home and work on some music or try to go through my schedule and see what needs to be done for the week. Museums can be crowded on Sundays, and I try to avoid crowds. STUDIO MODE If I’m going to work on music, I’m just playing the piano and singing. I have an upright Baldwin that was actually my oldest brother Taylor’s, but he couldn’t keep it in his apartment because he has too much stuff. If I’m not at the piano there’s some YouTube videos I can check out to help me on the piano. I’ll look at those. And I might check into some historical things on the internet if I’m writing music. I also just got some new software that I need to learn — Ableton Push 2. CATCH OF THE DAY Sometimes I’ll enter the madness that’s Whole Foods on Gowanus. But not always. Ned and I both really like cooking, so one place we usually try to go on Sundays is our fishmonger friend’s place in Bed-Stuy. It’s called Shipwreck Seafood Boutique. The guy who owns it, Joey Lugo, sells everything — salmon, halibut, grouper, tuna, the whole kit and caboodle. KEEPING MAMA HAPPY I have another brother who lives in the building, in the basement apartment. His name is Jevon and here’s a little factoid: He’s just finishing up in “Hamilton,” as the understudy for Hamilton and all the other dudes who aren’t Burr. Jevon has a dog named Mama and sometimes if he needs us to we’ll walk her for him. Mama is a pit bull. She’s very sweet. THE EATINGS Ned and I make dinner together. We split up the cooking duties pretty evenly, like we figure stuff out before we start. Who does what depends on if somebody has a particular vision about what they want to cook, maybe from a cookbook. We have a nice collection of them. When I went to college my mom made me this binder of recipes that she really loves. My whole family is really big on eating. We call ourselves “the Eatings.” ENTERTAINMENT Like most folks these days we’ll throw something on our projector while we’re eating. We just finished up “Narcos: Mexico” on Netflix so we’re moving on to something else entertaining, I’m not sure what yet. We try to watch informative things, sometimes a documentary that we can talk about afterward. UNWIND Sometimes we’ll have a show or something to go to on Sunday night. If not we’re usually just chilling after dinner, going over stuff that needs to get done for the next day. It’s the wind-down situation. PAGES Then we generally read before we go to bed. Right now I’m reading “Barracoon” by Zora Neale Hurston and also some books about how to accomplish what I’m trying to accomplish as an independent musician. Ned gave me “Made to Stick,” which I need to get through. It’s about marketing stuff. Bedtime really varies. We try to be in bed by midnight.

5c87f35a49f0eacbf105cac2,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/12/arts/music/maren-morris-girl-review.html,"In 2016, Maren Morris broke all the country music rules. Her major label debut album, “Hero,” was a vivid indictment of country’s dull masculinist norms — it had wit, creativity, punch and ambition. And as you might expect with all things Nashville, it made Morris … moderately successful. Country music has been clogged with dullish gentlemen for the last few years, and while Morris recorded some of the genre’s most promising music, some good it did her. She had a handful of hits — the cheeky “Rich,” the desperate “I Could Use a Love Song,” the howling “My Church” — that tartly underscored just how ideologically robust the rest of the genre wasn’t. It took sidestepping country altogether for Morris to get something like her due. “The Middle,” her 2018 chunky electro-pop stomper with Zedd and Grey, became the biggest Maren Morris hit — No. 5 on the Hot 100, and Grammy nominated — but also the one least specific to her talents. [See how Zedd, Maren Morris and a 23-year-old songwriter turned a few chords into “The Middle.”] Perhaps the vagueness that oozes throughout her scattershot new album, “Girl,” is attributable to that success. The best songs on “Hero” were disarmingly detailed, and sometimes funny. “Girl,” however, tips away from those strengths in favor of self-help bromides broad enough to exclude no one. Time and again on “Girl,” Morris seeks out wide-open territory. Many songs aim for the universal, the big tent: “The Feels” and “Make Out With Me” are lighthearted looking-for-love fun; “Great Ones” favors abstract image over detail (“You’re the perfect storm/So let it pour down on me”); “Good Woman” and “Shade” feel distant. Even “Flavor,” which is oriented around female empowerment, veers toward the bland: “Yeah I’m a lady, I make my dough/Won’t play the victim, Don’t fit that mold.” “The Middle” revealed that Morris’s voice had a natural home beyond country music, but to be fair, so did her debut album, which showed how versatile her vocal approach is — capable of delivering aspirational pop, novel country and also impressive shades of R&B. Her voice is thin, but it’s not brittle; it cuts through a variety of production styles easily. Many of her most forceful vocal performances on “Girl” are far from country music, like the up-tempo soul number “RSVP,” which with a few tweaks could easily make sense for, say, Monica or SZA. One of the finest moments is “The Bones,” which nods to the Chainsmokers and Daya hit “Don’t Let Me Down,” and features some of this album’s sturdiest songwriting. When Morris does lean in to country music’s past, it’s to lightly echo Dolly Parton’s chipper anthem “9 to 5” on “All My Favorite People,” which features Brothers Osborne singing with an arched eyebrow, as if performing a “Hee Haw” sketch. It’s a disruptive way to pay homage. “All My Favorite People” is one of the more detailed songs on this album, and also the one that most echoes the themes of the 2016 Morris: a nod to weed smoking, an assertion that “we love who we love.” But Kacey Musgraves — a Morris contemporary and peer in jolting country music’s center with the occasional drug reference — is now a Grammy album of the year winner, and even Luke Bryan is slipping notes of tolerance into his songs. These gestures now feel less urgent. What seemed audacious just a few years ago is now pro forma. So in the way “Hero” demonstrated how comfortable Morris was coloring outside country music’s lines, “Girl” instead indicates how well Morris might fill in pre-existing boundaries. One of the downsides of moving the goal posts is that they move for you as well. "
5c64698d3a125f5075c09891,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/13/books/review/walk-this-way-geoff-edgers.html,"WALK THIS WAY Run-DMC, Aerosmith, and the Song That Changed American Music Forever By Geoff Edgers In 2017 Nielsen Music reported that hip-hop and R & B had officially surpassed rock as America’s most-consumed genre. The news elicited international headlines, but for many of us it elicited a yawn. Who didn’t know by then that hip-hop was not just — to cite the rapper Nas, the comedian Katt Williams and countless pundits of the past decade — “as American as apple pie,” but one of America’s greatest exports: a music, culture and ethos that lives and breathes from California to Cape Town, New York to New Delhi? It wasn’t always so, of course. Such is the premise of Geoff Edgers’ “Walk This Way: Run-DMC, Aerosmith, and the Song That Changed American Music Forever,” which argues that before the July 4, 1986, release of the hit in his title — one of the first rap songs played on mainstream radio, the genre’s first in the Billboard Top 10 — almighty hip-hop was merely “a small underground community of independent labels and scrappy promoters.” As Edgers, the national arts reporter for The Washington Post, tells it, the crossover rap-rock tune “made it safe to be black and mainstream,” “proved that hip-hop, dismissed by many as a fad, had legs” and became “so many things to so many different people, from bar mitzvah boys in Westchester County to Ice-T.” It accomplished that, essentially, by being “hip-hop’s Trojan horse, the music camouflaged enough to give timid programmers permission to play”; this fomented a movement like the Harlem Renaissance and San Francisco’s Summer of Love, one that “crossed geographical, economic and, most important, racial lines.” All of this is well-trod territory. There has been no dearth of ink spilled about Run-DMC, Aerosmith or hip-hop’s rise to cultural domination. So in a book that is occasionally hyperbolic yet fastidiously thorough — sometimes too thorough: “Walk This Way” grew from a long-form article and often feels better suited as one, unless you’re enthralled by the nitty-gritty of industry insider-ness — Edgers carves out a niche by creating in narrative fashion the very mash-up he’s documenting, merging two racial and spatial histories just as Run-DMC and Aerosmith’s hit fused disparate sounds and scenes. On the one hand, there’s the sex, drugs and rock ’n’ roll story of Bronx-raised Steven Tallarico, joining forces with Joe Perry in ’70s-era Boston to become Steven Tyler of Aerosmith. Edgers pegs the two as polar opposites: While “Perry has his personality knob set on permanent mumble,” Tyler “blasts into a conversation. He makes up words and phrases and draws on entire waiting rooms of personalities. He dances across decades, cities and relationships.” They made an electrifying onstage duo — until they fell victim to the clichés of rock stardom, battling addiction and going from filling stadiums to grasping at straws for a hit. Meanwhile, over in early-’80s New York — Hollis, Queens, to be exact: far from the white college bars of Boston but still “an urban oasis compared to the burned-out brick buildings of the Bronx” — Joseph Simmons (Run) and Darryl McDaniels (DMC) joined forces with Jason Mizell, a.k.a. Jam Master Jay, to garner fame as Run-DMC. Hip-hop was still, as the music mogul Lyor Cohen says, “a powerful little secret running through America,” but it was bubbling to the surface — Blondie’s 1981 hit “Rapture” name-checked the hip-hop pioneer Fab 5 Freddy and featured him in its video; a popular trio of white kids called the Beastie Boys endearingly wedded hip-hop mettle with adolescent impishness; and Run-DMC released the first rap album to go gold — before falling prey to internal battles incited by the myriad hustles of an underground industry. Into this mix — “a pair of pale-faced rockers itching for a fix, a trio of black kids still trying to figure out why they were there” — enters the producer Rick Rubin: hip-hop’s unlikely poster child. The Long Island-raised Rubin was a proud suburbanite blithe about street cred; “his drug of choice,” Edgers writes, “was the General Tso’s chicken that flowed into his dorm room” at N.Y.U. Thinking of hip-hop as black punk rock, Rubin partnered with Russell Simmons (Run’s brother) to form the iconic label Def Jam. The mission was to capture the genre’s live-show energy on record, and also to transform a hit rock song released by Aerosmith in 1975 into a strange-bedfellows crossover duet. Edgers gives us the hyper-amusing blow-by-blow of just how this duet came alive, from the back-and-forth of lyrical expletives in the studio — Run called Tyler’s lyrics “hillbilly gibberish” — to the recording of a music video that is both harbinger and metaphor for the song’s legacy: Here were the two groups literally breaking down the wall between them so they could rock out — rap out? — together. And the rest is hip-hop history. Or is it? After “Walk This Way,” Aerosmith’s ninth studio album sold five million copies and returned them to stadium-show status. Rubin was crowned “King of Rap” on the cover of The Village Voice. Run-DMC, however, found themselves embroiled in more in-house battles and lawsuits, and though their legacy as hip-hop godfathers is well enshrined, their 1988 “Tougher Than Leather” album was not the commercial smash that Aerosmith’s release was. There is an elephant in the room here, one that Edgers signals toward but ought to face squarely. What does it say about American culture that for an African-American art form to receive its due it had to not just seek white validation but cloak itself in the trappings of whiteness? How is it that the biggest immediate winners in the story were not the black rappers but the white rockers and the white producer? These are rhetorical questions; anyone mildly familiar with American cultural history knows the dynamics at play here. When Edgers casually compares “Walk This Way” to the “historic” moment when “Elvis thrust his pelvis on ‘The Milton Berle Show’ 30 years earlier,” there’s that elephant again: Is anyone more representative of the long legacy of white appropriation of black art forms than Elvis? In rock ’n’ roll it was a shameless, easy process: white artists covering songs by black artists, then earning the money and credit. But wait, you say. In hip-hop it has not been so shameless and easy. Scores of black originators in the genre then and now continue to earn their due. And anyway, hip-hop is not simply “black” but creole: Latinos were vital to its inception; broadly speaking, hip-hop culture was, as Fab 5 Freddy says to Edgers, akin to American pop culture itself: “a collaborative effort between blacks, Jews and Italians, particularly in New York.” This is true. But it is also why hip-hop narratives, like the “Walk This Way” saga, continue to hold so much appeal, almost as America’s national fable: They reinforce the myth of the American dream. The myth that an empire of wealth can grow from dorm rooms (but never mind the price tag on those dorm rooms and thus the color and class of most people inhabiting them). The myth that America is a melting pot of hybrid peoples coming together to produce beautiful cultures (but never mind that such a process has been governed by racist, capitalist-driven power dynamics that continue to benefit some more than others). There is something anachronistic, especially in a Black Lives Matter era, about recounting hip-hop history without more than a nod to these realities. Edgers tells the story with incredulity — behold how one song changed American music! — but in the context of American history the ending is actually an inevitability: If it hadn’t been hip-hop it would have been something else, because as Ralph Ellison pointed out in his famed Time magazine essay “What America Would Be Like Without Blacks,” American culture is African-American culture and vice versa. How this process has played out and for whose benefit, how its reality has been negated by whole swaths of America — including a current president who omits hip-hop from his inauguration because it’s not right for the “typically and traditionally American event” — these are the issues demanding the attention of hip-hop historians of the here and now.

5c9e6c8e49f0eacbf106a260,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/29/arts/music/bach-st-matthew-passion-review.html,"The director Peter Sellars believes that Bach wrote his “St. Matthew Passion” not as a concert work or theater piece but as a “transformative ritual reaching across time and space.” That’s the way he presented it in a revelatory performance with Simon Rattle and the Berlin Philharmonic at the Park Avenue Armory in 2014. The orchestra and chorus, each divided into two groups, as Bach stipulated, here became like combating forces in a searing story of faith and doubt, trust and betrayal, community and mob chaos. Of course, the “St. Matthew Passion,” which tells of Christ’s last days on earth, is a church piece, a sacred oratorio. But how would Bach have presented it at the church where he worked in Leipzig? An affecting answer was suggested on Thursday at St. Peter’s Episcopal Church in Chelsea when Tenet Vocal Artists and the early-music ensemble the Sebastians, who have a string of remarkable collaborations to their credit, performed this masterpiece. It’s likely, many scholars believe, that under Bach the choruses would have been performed with one singer per part. These singers would have also shared the solo arias and even taken the crucial roles of the Evangelist and Jesus. In its intimacy and directness, this beautifully small-scale performance by Tenet and the Sebastians was just as shattering as the Berlin Philharmonic’s near-operatic approach. In the somber, steady opening piece, the choristers of one group beseech the daughters of Zion to join the lament. “Behold!” they sing. “Whom?, the others ask. The “Bridegroom!” the first group explains. Here, the music was performed by just eight singers, four in each chorus, standing in front of the pews, one group to the left, the other to the right. In other performances of the passion, you can be swept along by the choral majesty of Bach’s music. In this one, you heard the individual lines — and the individual qualities of the voices — with striking clarity. So, the desperate pleas and the confused responses came through like personal utterances. It was almost uncomfortable to watch as these singers took small roles one moment then sang an aria the next, as when the strong bass Sumner Thompson transformed from Judas, betraying Jesus with a kiss, into a penitent singing a sublime aria asking to have his Jesus back. The other bass, Charles Wesley Evans, brought tenderness to an aria affirming that it will be easier to take on the cross in his life because Jesus had first done so. Yet, before long, Mr. Evans became Peter, the frightened disciple who denied Jesus three times. The radiant-voiced Jolle Greenleaf, the artistic director of Tenet, shared soprano arias with the elegant Laura Heimes. The countertenor Doug Dodson and the mezzo-soprano Virginia Warnken Kelsey shared the alto arias. Jason McStoots and Gene Stenger were the impressive tenors. Tyler Duncan’s naturally burly baritone made him an almost fearsome Jesus. So it was wrenching when this Jesus showed poignant vulnerability in accepting his fate. As the Evangelist, the tenor Aaron Sheehan balanced grace and urgency in relating this oft-told story. The Sebastians ensemble (Jeffrey Grossman, music director) gave a performance of uncommon naturalness and transparency. Mr. Grossman, much as Bach would have, played the organ continuo part while offering just occasional cues. "
5caf8a8249f0eacbf1f82ff8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/arts/music/lil-nas-x-old-town-road-country-rap.html,"Over the last few weeks, “Old Town Road” — a strutting and lightheartedly comedic country-rap tune by the previously unknown 20-year-old rapper Lil Nas X — has lived an improbable number of lives. It began as a Hail Mary pass by a college dropout hoping music might save him from having to go back to school. But in the way that the internet can rapidly make and remake something, morphing meaning in real time, Lil Nas X’s track became something different almost every few days on its path from SoundCloud obscurity to pop ubiquity: a savvy troll, a manipulator of streaming algorithms, a meme theme, a battering ram to genre barriers, a trigger of music-biz discord, a David suffering at the hands of Goliath, a sociocultural rallying point, and eventually, a site of cross-cultural kumbaya. [Listen to a history of country-rap in 29 songs.] And now, it’s likely to be one of the most emblematic songs of the year: On April 8, “Old Town Road” became the No. 1 song in the country, capping a startling ascent that demonstrates what can happen when viral engineering meets lightning-rod controversy meets the pop uncanny. For its first 25 seconds, “Old Town Road” could be any other rural lament, a lonely howl delivered over a plucked ukulele. It’s only when the trap drums kick in and the vocals change from singing to quasi-ironic rapping that the song’s true intentions come to the fore. It’s a genre-hybrid exercise — a hip-hop song with country-themed subject matter, partly rapped and partly sung in an exaggerated honky-tonk accent — and also a comedy sketch. The way Lil Nas X overaccentuates his vowels and makes them wobble is a caricature of stoic drawl, and when he raps “cowboy hat from Gucci, Wrangler on my booty,” it’s both confident boast and funny fantasy. It’s also a neat distillation of how genre is currently lived in American pop music: fluidly, with styles and ideas up for grabs by creators and easily slipped on and off by listeners, with varying degrees of sincerity. Pop, more than ever, is an identity playground. [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] But the particular alchemy of “Old Town Road” also taps something deeper: more than two decades of dialogue between country music and hip-hop, genres that have been slowly but consistently finding common heritage, swapping structural elements and taking comfort in each other’s sounds. But the industry’s gatekeepers are less interested in this mutability. For decades, Nashville has essentially framed and marketed the rural experience as white — despite and in defiance of the deep black roots of country music. So when an artist like Lil Nas X — who is black, and raps, and is from Atlanta, with no ties to the country music business — lays claim to rural aesthetics, even in a way that’s partly tongue in cheek, it causes real disruption. In late March, “Old Town Road” appeared on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart before it was removed for being deemed insufficiently country, causing a furor. But resistance led to embrace: a remix of the song featuring Billy Ray Cyrus, which in turn has been played by some country radio stations, which helped the song land on Billboard’s Country Airplay chart. “Old Town Road” — the original or the remix — is by no means the first country-rap crossover. There have been collaborations across genre lines, like Nelly and Tim McGraw’s “Over and Over”; songs in which country singers rap, like Jason Aldean’s “Dirt Road Anthem” and Blake Shelton’s “Boys ’Round Here”; and performances that are fully genre flexible, like Sam Hunt’s “Take Your Time.” And hip-hop has flirted with country signifiers on and off since the 1980s, whether it was the fringe-outfitted rapper Cowboy from the Furious Five, or Kool Moe Dee’s — and later, Will Smith’s — excursion to the “Wild Wild West.” By the 1990s, Southern rap was flourishing, providing a platform for ideas, accents and sounds that weren’t part of hip-hop from the coasts. Crooked Lettaz from Mississippi, 8Ball & MJG from Tennessee, UGK from Texas and many more emphasized drawling flows and production that leaned toward Southern soul and sometimes blues. Around the turn of the century, a pair of young white rappers, Bubba Sparxxx and Colt Ford, were beginning to work with Shannon Houchins, a producer in the Atlanta rap innovator Jermaine Dupri’s camp. Houchins would go on to produce most of “Dark Days, Bright Nights,” Sparxxx’s independent debut album, which got him signed to the major label Interscope and partnered with the producer Timbaland, who steered country-rap to its first big breakthrough moment: Sparxxx’s single “Ugly,” a hip-hop and pop hit with a video that included a pig sty and a tractor race, and went to No. 15 on the Billboard Hot 100. Sparxxx’s follow-up album, “Deliverance,” was a stunning and elegant cross-genre statement radically unlike anything that had preceded it. It made less of a broad impact, but in the wake of Sparxxx’s innovations came a wave of artists who effectively identified as country rappers focused on rural storytelling and signifiers — growing up far from cities, partying at mud bogs and so on. The seeds were also planted for what was to be Nashville’s first extended flirtation with hip-hop. Kid Rock, an early white rapper, remade himself as a country-rock rapper-singer. Tim McGraw partnered with Nelly on “Over and Over,” a road ballad that went to No. 3 on the Hot 100 in 2004. Kenny Rogers collaborated with both Wyclef Jean and Coolio. Even Willie Nelson appeared on a hip-hop song. And in Nashville, the MuzikMafia emerged, a polyglot group of performers that included the singing duo Big & Rich and the rapper Cowboy Troy, who collaborated on several songs, including the single “I Play Chicken With the Train,” which in 2005 became the first country-rap song to land on the Billboard Country Songs chart. These were outliers, or novelties — brief successes that Nashville tolerated but didn’t wholeheartedly embrace. But at around the same time, Houchins teamed up with Ford to form Average Joes Entertainment, a record label devoted to the intersection of country and rap centered on white rural experiences, with a growing stable of burly gool-ol’-boy rappers — “hick-hop,” it was occasionally called — operating largely outside the country music mainstream, though Ford regularly collaborated with the genre’s stars. [A godfather of country-rap on his 2000s hits and Lil Nas X.] By the early 2010s, Nashville was in search of raw energy. The music became more rural, rougher at the edges and more willing to flaunt a range of influences. These younger singers — Jason Aldean, Luke Bryan — often made it plain that hip-hop was as much of their musical heritage as country or Southern rock. That lineage was cemented when, in 2010, Aldean covered “Dirt Road Anthem,” a song originally recorded by Ford and Brantley Gilbert; his version went to No 1. on the country chart and No. 7 on the Hot 100. It opened the floodgates — Blake Shelton rapped a little, Bryan danced to hip-hop songs onstage, the duo Florida Georgia Line built a career on importing just the faintest hint of hip-hop percussion and slang. Their song “Cruise” became one of the biggest hits of 2013, bolstered by a remix featuring, who else, Nelly. That there’s a splash of hip-hop coursing through country (its male performers, at least) is now fundamentally accepted, but always with the country performer — and the country music business — in control of just how much. Nothing, though, is immune from the force and urgency of the meme economy, and Lil Nas X has demonstrated himself to be a master of how to pachinko his way from the margins to the mainstream. “Old Town Road” began on SoundCloud, where he tagged it as country to avoid competing with the hip-hop heavyweights that dominate the platform. Once it began to get noticed, he pushed it heavily on TikTok, the short-performance-clip app, where it was the soundtrack to thousands of videos. The track also arrived at a fortuitous moment — on the heels of a trickle of Western aesthetics into the high-style universe over the last couple of years, and also following the success of stylistically diverse country performers like Kacey Musgraves, who have demonstrated that a country musician can be a beacon of cool far outside the genre’s walls. Even Kanye West recently took to the countryside, unveiling his last album at a Wyoming cowboy ranch. In another moment, the aesthetic choices of “Old Town Road” might have been perceived as pure kitsch, but now they are kitsch with a side of tastemaker. And though the removal of the song from the country chart reflected an initial resentment, the mood soon switched. Some country singers said they found “Old Town Road” to be country, or country enough. They didn’t want to be on the wrong side of cool. Billy Ray Cyrus, who joined the song’s remix, is not a country insider at the peak of his powers, but he’s still a performer with a great deal of resonance within Nashville thanks to his 1992 pop-country crossover smash “Achy Breaky Heart.” Cyrus’s “Old Town Road” verse is pure glitz, a blend of hip-hop braggadocio and country-boy-in-the-big-city awe: “Spent a lot of money on my brand-new guitar/Baby’s got a habit, diamond rings and Fendi sports bras/Ridin’ down Rodeo in my Maserati sports car.” The performance is effortless, showing a version of country music that’s cosmopolitan, flexible and self-aware. Whether Cyrus’s co-sign will be enough for the industry side of Nashville to embrace “Old Town Road” remains to be seen. That’s because, when it comes to charts and common practices, country isn’t a genre or a set of sounds as much as it is an oligarchy, the product of a limited number of record labels; a media environment that relies heavily on radio (with programmers who can lack imagination, as female country performers have long known); and a profound bottleneck in terms of new talent and new ideas. (To be fair, country is not alone in this: In 2012, the K-pop novelty star Psy went to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Rap Songs chart with “Gangnam Style,” which was — and remains — one of the biggest viral YouTube songs in history, but was by no means a rap song in the American context.) Nashville’s initial resistance suggests some unfortunate things about country as a genre: that it might not be able to make fun of itself; that it might look askance at outsiders, especially black performers; that it understands itself only through the lens of protecting its central ideology, and not as an omnivorous sound in dialogue with the rest of pop, and the rest of America. Country music is preoccupied with borders, and it treats each new incursion as an opportunity for identity crisis. It’s a wild contrast with contemporary hip-hop, which understands itself as music that borrows widely, and experiments with glee. But perhaps the greatest indictment of how the country music leadership handled “Old Town Road” comes from a cursory listen to some other songs on the chart. Take “Look What God Gave Her,” the new single by Thomas Rhett, perhaps the ur-country gentleman of the last few years. It’s a soft soul song with a faint disco undertow, nothing country about it beyond the perceived affiliation of the performer. Elsewhere there are soft-rock ballads and R&B songs, none of them subject to anything like the skepticism that has greeted Lil Nas X, whose reference points might in fact be more classically country (even if refracted through a kitsch lens). Which means that the Lil Nas X controversy boils down to a conversation about who is entitled to lay public claim to Southern tropes that country music believes it has monopolized (but in truth, has been less and less reliant on in recent years). That it’s happening at a moment featuring more black country music performers than any in recent memory — Darius Rucker, Kane Brown, Jimmie Allen, Mickey Guyton and many more — is especially discouraging. On its own terms, “Old Town Road” has been a wild success. And when it comes the music business’s terms, well, that’s being reverse engineered. Following the Cyrus remix, Lil Nas X teased another with Young Thug. In truth, “Old Town Road” isn’t quite fully country or hip-hop, at least not in the ways those genres taxonomize themselves. It’s something far more slippery, slithering between the two spaces and arriving at pop novelty. This is where songs that have been disowned by their ostensible homes but provide uncomplicated pleasure often land — embraced widely even as they’re kept at arms length locally. But it is too potent to remain that way. It certainly won’t be long before some country singers incorporate it into their live sets. Country stations are beginning to play the song, which serves as a kind of proxy for acceptance. And indeed, Billboard recently announced that it might revisit its decision to include “Old Town Road” on its main country chart — after all, country is as country allows itself to be. "
5caa2bc949f0eacbf1f81736,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/07/arts/music/budapest-orchestra-review.html,"The aesthetic commitment being offered was never in doubt. By programming two full nights of Bartok at Carnegie Hall, the touring Budapest Festival Orchestra and its music director, Ivan Fischer, were signaling their passion for a Hungarian modernist whose works they have memorably recorded. The question was whether some of Bartok’s celebrated touchstones — the Concerto for Orchestra, the “Miraculous Mandarin” suite and a concert performance of the one-act opera “Bluebeard’s Castle” — would stand noticeably apart from the comparative rarities on each bill. On Friday, that sometimes seemed to be the case, to the rarities’ advantage. The “Mandarin” had its requisite, slashing severity, though occasionally a bit too much (as when the heroically riffing trombones ran riot over the other sections). By the end of the concert, there was an ideal sense of balance, during the Concerto for Orchestra. Here the strings were allowed more space to delight in complex blends of textures, made of strands both sinewy and silken. Yet what stood out most was an informational (though not didactic) tour through several of the composer’s works for student singers and orchestral players. In brief remarks from the stage, Mr. Fischer observed that Bartok was a dedicated educator. So, too, was Mr. Fischer. By allowing Cantemus Choir — a girls’ ensemble from the Zoltan Kodaly Primary School — significant time on the Carnegie stage, the conductor helped emphasize Bartok’s ability to merge charming, youthful motifs with the occasional dollop of more complex harmony. (This was particularly true of the selections with orchestral accompaniment.) Mr. Fischer cracked a joke about his cohorts pretending to be a “student orchestra,” though there was nothing apprentice about their engagement. Nor any sense that the players’ talents were being wasted on this thoughtfully constructed music. Saturday’s concert had a similarly instructive angle, this time focused on Bartok’s appetite for folk music. In that night’s commentary, Mr. Fischer described the composer’s ethnomusicological practice of recording authentic performances of local songs, then invited a trio from the orchestra to the front of the stage. The bassist, violist and violinist first played a series of traditional Romanian dances “as Bartok may have heard them” (in Mr. Fischer’s formulation). When one of the jubilant traditional melodies was taken up by the full orchestra, signaling the beginning of Bartok’s “Romanian Folk Dances,” the crowd cut short its enthusiastic applause for the trio to pay attention to the brief but potent Bartokian adaptation for orchestra. (A similar spell was cast, later on, when the same trio accompanied the contemporary Hungarian vocalist Marta Sebestyen, in a series of pieces that preceded the orchestra’s tour through Bartok’s “Hungarian Peasant Songs.”) The “Bluebeard’s Castle” that followed might have felt anticlimactic, after those revels. But the performance was, for me, the highlight of the weekend. This take breathed fresh life into a work that, in recent years, has perhaps been familiar to New York audiences through Mariusz Trelinski’s Metropolitan Opera production. In its high-tech yet one-note grimness, the Met’s presentation can feel like a slog. This concert performance was more dramatically varied — with the mezzo-soprano Ildiko Komlosi’s Judith seeming possessed of some persuasive (if fatally misguided) romantic hopes. And the orchestral playing was as exciting here as at any point during Budapest’s Carnegie stand. Mr. Fischer steered toward each new horror with an ingenuity capable of conjuring all the narrative’s gothic scenery — no strobing, blood-red light shows necessary. "
5ca3a89e49f0eacbf1f803bf,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/02/arts/music/kings-college-choir-review.html,"The roster of the Choir of King’s College, Cambridge, inevitably keeps changing as the boys who fill it enter adolescence and move on. But for 37 years, the organist and conductor Stephen Cleobury has provided stability as its director of music, leading the ensemble that perhaps best represents the great English choral tradition. On Monday Mr. Cleobury, who will retire from his post this summer, led the choir in a magnificent concert at St. Thomas Church Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, his last performance in America at the head of a storied ensemble that dates to 1441. Over the years he has brought the group regularly to St. Thomas, and the church was packed for this farewell. The boys of King’s College arrived, though, as the choir’s traditions have been questioned. Last December, Lesley Garrett, a British soprano, wrote an article calling the boys-only lineup an anachronism that was unfair to girls. The idea that boy treble voices have special purity is “just nonsense,” Ms. Garrett wrote. [Read more about the debate over boy choirs.] Her broadside sparked an international debate over the singing opportunities presented to girls and the aesthetics of the choral tradition. Do boys sing with a distinctively ethereal sound? It was hard not to conclude so listening to the remarkable King’s College Choir on Monday. And though the focused, shimmering sound of the choir’s collected voices — which includes older boys singing alto, tenor and bass parts — was splendid, the treble voices were especially wondrous. In works like Monteverdi’s “Cantate Domino” and Tallis’s “Videte Miraculum,” the trebles penetrated the choral textures even during passages when the basses and tenors were singing with youthful fervor. The sound these youngest boys make comes across as utterly natural yet somehow transient, a haunting falsetto. Yet the quality of this choir may result not just from the innate character of boys’ voices but also from the approach to vocal training and music-making the ensemble has preserved. That British approach has sometimes been criticized as too polite and reserved. But on this night, Mr. Cleobury coaxed singing of great vigor, color and character from the choristers. I was impressed by the attention to text. In William Byrd’s “Laudibus in Sanctis,” a setting of Psalm 150, when the Latin words call for praising the greatness of God in anthems and song, the choristers made every word crisp and clear and sent the phrase soaring. The choir sounded equally confident in 20th-century pieces by Britten (the dramatic antiphon “Praised Be the God of Love”) and Vaughan Williams (the mysterious “Valiant-for-Truth,” a setting of a text from “Pilgrim’s Progress”). St. Thomas Church maintains its own renowned Choir of Men and Boys. And its director of music, Daniel Hyde, will be Mr. Cleobury’s successor in Cambridge. Mr. Hyde once worked under Mr. Cleobury as an organ scholar at King’s College. So the tradition continues, even as the debate goes on. "
5c892d5b49f0eacbf105cd92,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/13/arts/music/review-anne-sophie-mutter-andre-previn-carnegie.html,"Ghosts were always going to be part of the star violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter’s recital at Carnegie Hall this week. The advertised program featured Mozart, as well as the spirit of that composer as it flickers through later French music. And the concert was also to include Sebastian Currier’s new “Ghost Trio,” which riffs on themes of influence and musical forebears. But when Ms. Mutter and her longtime chamber music partner, the pianist Lambert Orkis, took to the stage at Carnegie Hall on Tuesday, the specter most strongly felt was that of André Previn, the conductor, composer and musical polymath. Ms. Mutter and Mr. Previn were once married, and remained close friends and artistic collaborators until his death on Feb. 28. And so, at the end of an evening of brilliant and often uncannily delicate music-making, Ms. Mutter played two Previn works as encores. She dedicated them to him — “wherever he is now,” she said with a spiraling gesture taking in the air around and above her. [Hear the many facets of Mr. Previn, a musical polymath.] Ms. Mutter has built her career on a rich, glossy tone and glamorous stage presence. She is one of the few violinists who can pull off solo recitals in Carnegie’s big hall. On this occasion, she used her magnetism to draw listeners into a world of sounds that included pallid, watery tones a mere whisper away from silence. Most surprising, perhaps, she used these spectral colors in the opening work, Mozart’s Violin Sonata in E minor (K. 304), where the opening theme took on brittle weariness. In the second movement, she rendered one ostensibly sunny theme with such spidery lightness that the consolation it offered came across as a mere mirage. In Debussy’s Violin Sonata, such disembodied sounds are written into the score by a composer who plays on fluctuations of heat and density. In this elegant and sensuous music, Ms. Mutter showed off her trademark rich tone and flamboyant expressiveness. A second Mozart sonata, in B flat (K. 454), became a vehicle for spirited and flirtatious playing, as did the debonair and witty Violin Sonata of Poulenc. Both works trick the listener with wait-for-it endings. After more than 25 years playing together, Ms. Mutter and Mr. Orkis have their comic timing down pat. Humor, alienation and hallucinatory echoes of past music come together in Mr. Currier’s “Ghost Trio.” In nine succinct movements, with titles like “Remote,” “Mysterious” and “Forceful,” this work weaves glancing — and distorted — references to piano trios by Beethoven, Mendelssohn and others into his own intricate, emotionally focused language. In duet with Ms. Mutter, Mr. Orkis’s playing is unfailingly attentive. Here his technical brilliance came to the forefront while Daniel Müller-Schott’s buttery cello added depth and contour. Mr. Müller-Schott also joined for the first encore, a movement from Mr. Previn’s Piano Trio No. 1, which had its premiere (with Ms. Mutter and, on piano, Mr. Previn himself) 10 years ago at Carnegie. The movement, “Spirited,” maintains a sybaritic optimism even through emotional U-turns. A touching rendition of “Song” from “Tango Song and Dance” (1997) followed. Written for Ms. Mutter, she played this effusively melodic music with a sweet, sometimes tremulous tone that felt unaffected and personal. "
5c815b7849f0eacbf105be26,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/07/arts/music/review-roscoe-mitchell-park-avenue-armory.html,"On Wednesday at the Park Avenue Armory, toward the end of a solo on sopranino saxophone that had lasted more than 10 minutes, Roscoe Mitchell made it seem as though the intimate dimensions of the Armory’s  Veterans Room were in the process of being jackhammered. After the solo’s gradual introductory section — full of rough-textured honks and droning harmonics — Mr. Mitchell started dispensing a stream of lightning-quick traditional notes, each one full of robust authority. And then, thanks to some gales of circular breathing, he managed to thread one of those earlier, overblown harmonics atop the ongoing, bebop-influenced flurry. This time the droning pitch was pealing, and ecstatically clear. The room shook with the swelling overtones of amplified, electroacoustic music. But Mr. Mitchell’s funhouse was a fully acoustic one. Then, switching back to his rougher extended-technique pitches, he once again sneaked in that liquid legato line of traditional notes, this time in a raspier style. The cumulative impact of this solo tour de force involved two different ways of looking at his polyphonic capability. The piece, “Sustain and Run,” was the highlight of Mr. Mitchell’s presence as an instrumentalist on Wednesday. But it wasn’t the apex of the two concerts of his music that were presented at the Armory as part of the Artists Studio series organized by the pianist and composer Jason Moran. In the evening’s first set, Joseph Kubera brought intensity and warmth to the toccata-style central movement of Mr. Mitchell’s piano piece “8/8/88.” In the second concert, a collection of players drawn from the Wavefield Ensemble showed off a lovely group blend when navigating the sympathetically swirling melodic motifs in “Cutouts for Woodwind Quintet.” Mr. Mitchell was heard in a larger chamber ensemble that closed the second concert, as well as in the Trio Space, a new version of a past group with the baritone Thomas Buckner. (The band now also includes the multi-instrumentalist Scott Robinson.) It was possible throughout these performances to hear the wide vistas of near-silent poise, in between peaks of intensity, that characterized Mr. Mitchell’s more widely heard work with the Art Ensemble of Chicago, the pathbreaking group he co-founded 50 years ago. This year Mr. Mitchell and another longtime Art Ensemble member, Famoudou Don Moye, will lead a new lineup of the group at the Big Ears Festival in Knoxville, Tenn., and will release a double album on Pi Recordings. Later this month, Mr. Mitchell will also release a new set of his orchestral music, on the Wide Hive label. Aspects of that record — “Littlefield Concert Hall Mills College” — were similarly reflected in the sets Mr. Mitchell presented on Wednesday. On the recording and at the Armory, it’s clear that Mr. Mitchell’s presence as a soloist is not required for performances of his music to sound idiomatic, and that his past work is continuously open to radical revision. At the second show on Wednesday, his stridently strutting 1970s “Nonaah” was played in a more lyrical later arrangement for piano, oboe and flute. And on the “Littlefield” recording, a 25-piece orchestra plays newer versions of pieces that the Wide Hive label has already released, like “Frenzy House.” The journey of “Frenzy House” to its current state also works as a useful summary of Mr. Mitchell’s versatility. The piece began as a riotous improvisation by Mr. Mitchell, the pianist Craig Taborn and the percussionist Kikanju Baku. But after that improvisation was transcribed and rearranged for its first orchestral recording, its composer was not yet finished exploring it. In its latest version, there is some fresh opening thematic material that adds a surprising, if characteristically tart, quality of Americana. Unlike on prior recordings of “Frenzy House,” Mr. Mitchell doesn’t play on this new recording — but in all its unpredictable mergers of style, it sounds completely of a piece with his back catalog. “The thing I like about this process,” Mr. Mitchell said in an email this week, “is that it’s ongoing.” "
5cab82f249f0eacbf1f81a42,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/08/arts/music/pollini-pohjonen-carnegie-review.html,"In October 2004, two days after the master pianist Maurizio Pollini gave a recital at Carnegie Hall, Juho Pohjonen, a 23-year-old from Finland, made his American debut upstairs at Carnegie’s Weill Recital Hall. At the time, the two were far apart in their careers: one an eminence, playing Chopin and Debussy with his characteristic cool brilliance and probing musicianship, the other a boyish newcomer. Yet back then Mr. Pohjonen already had formidable technique and an exploratory streak. After winning accounts of works by Mozart, Schumann, Scriabin and Bartok, he ended that recital with fearless performances of two stunningly difficult pieces by Esa-Pekka Salonen: “Yta II” and “Dichotomie,” a wildly exuberant 17-minute piece that begins like some fractured avant-garde version of Stravinsky’s “Petrushka.” Fifteen years later, the two pianists happened to return to New York two days apart. On Friday, Mr. Pohjonen gave an hourlong recital for an audience of about 100 in the intimate Buttenwieser Hall at the 92nd Street Y, again ending with Mr. Salonen’s “Dichotomie.” And on Sunday, Mr. Pollini returned to a packed Carnegie Hall for a splendid recital of works by Brahms, Schumann and Chopin. These seemingly different pianists had more in common than you might assume: An eager musician of around 40 can also be a master of his craft; a towering artist, at 77, can still be an adventurer. Mr. Pollini certainly took risks in the days when he championed thorny modernist works by Boulez and Nono. In recitals at Carnegie, he would play selections from Stockhausen’s monumental “Klavierstücke” series alongside Beethoven’s “Hammerklavier” Sonata and “Diabelli” Variations to make the point that both composers were visionaries pushing toward new realms of the piano. In recent years Mr. Pollini, who has grappled with periods of illness, has been hewing mostly to standard repertory, as he did on Sunday. Still, his searching performance of Schumann’s seldom-heard Sonata No. 3 in F minor suggested why this work has the subtitle “Concerto Without Orchestra.” The first movement begins with a dark, majestic theme that immediately breaks into swirling turbulence. But Mr. Pollini sensitively drew out the plaintive melodic lines that penetrate the tangles of passagework and counterpoint. He managed to reconcile Schumann’s extremes, especially in the teeming finale, in which the music’s fixation on dotted-note rhythms seems at cross purposes with its dancing energy. Since that long-ago debut at Weill, Mr. Pohjonen has won a following in New York for his regular performances with the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center. On Friday, he gave an elegant account of Rameau’s Suite No. 2 in G, and conveyed the episodic fervor of Scriabin’s single-movement Sonata No. 8. He again conquered Mr. Salonen’s “Dichotomie.” The second part of the piece unfolds in passages of oscillating chords and pummeling repeated figures, until the music bursts into a long episode of sweeping glissandos, through which thematic lines and pungent chords must break through. As he did 15 years ago to ease the execution (and protect the fingers of his right hand), Mr. Pohjonen managed to quickly slip on a thin glove to dispatch the glissandos, then deftly slipped it off — a neat trick. But, more than in 2004, he had the piece sounding alluring, with watery runs and milky colors amid bouts of pummeling chords. It no longer seemed nearly impossible. You might say he played it like a master. "
5c81164c49f0eacbf105bd3a,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/07/arts/music/esa-pekka-salonen-interview.html,"Last year, the composer and conductor Esa-Pekka Salonen took part in a discussion about the future of classical music at New York University. He found it interesting, he said in a recent interview, but also exasperating. “The gentleman doing the introduction was actually from the philosophy department,” said Mr. Salonen, who conducts the Philharmonia Orchestra of London at Lincoln Center on Sunday and Monday. “Painting the customary doom-and-gloom picture, with less money, audiences aging.” “It’s actually dangerous to equate the health of some institutions with the health of the art form,” Mr. Salonen, 60, added. Music is doing fine, he said — “it’s just that some institutions are having trouble. Those are completely different things.” Mr. Salonen — who seemed for a time happy to float in that just-fine realm of pure music, writing his own works and conducting selectively — is now diving back into those troubled institutions. The San Francisco Symphony recently made the surprise announcement that in 2020, when Michael Tilson Thomas steps aside after 25 years as its music director, Mr. Salonen will be his replacement. [Read about Mr. Salonen’s new position in San Francisco.] Since the late 1960s, when the fiery young Pierre Boulez said that the only solution to the entrenched conservatism of classical music was to blow up the opera houses and destroy all the art of the past, there have been calls for systemic change. Yet Boulez mellowed over time, and became a revered figure at leading opera houses and orchestras, working within the system to improve it rather than exploding it. And Mr. Salonen, who came to attention as a flinty Finnish modernist composer, has taken a similar course. Yes, he wants to shake things up, but from the inside. In taking on another orchestra directorship, a decade after leaving a landmark tenure at the Los Angeles Philharmonic, he hopes to find the sweet spot between gutting the system and maintaining what works. “The infrastructure of what we call classical music is going to evolve into something else,” Mr. Salonen said, though “we don’t quite know what it is.” But there is no reason to panic, he emphasized. “Obviously, it’s in no one’s interest to blow up the existing structure and start all over. It would be counterproductive.” Mr. Salonen will arrive in San Francisco with something of a head start: Mr. Thomas has fostered a climate of experimentation. And Mr. Salonen certainly proved himself a model of fresh thinking during his 17-year tenure as music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic. He has more recently refreshed the Philharmonia Orchestra as its principal conductor — including, in recent years, explorations of digital technology and virtual reality projects. [Read our review of Mr. Salonen’s most recent concert in San Francisco.] He comes at his new position, moreover, as a working composer. He suggested that, by “doing something as strange as writing new art music, you send out a very optimistic signal that I actually believe in this. And I believe in the longevity of the art form, and also believe there is a lot to be said still. When we talk about the masters, the underlying message is that the best has happened already. I don’t think so.” A symphony orchestra, Mr. Salonen said, is too often described as a mechanism with pieces people have put together. To him, an orchestra is an “organism” that “kind of grows.” Better ways to present it and integrate it into the community must be found. But, he made clear, “I don’t want to mess with the physiology of the orchestra.” So what is he willing to mess with? The weekly subscription-series programming format — “the grid,” as Mr. Salonen called it — increasingly seems an impediment to artistic vitality. “We are presented with a grid,” he explained, “and then you kind of fill it with content, and the content can be interesting, good and imaginative, but it still has to fit into the grid.” Most people today, especially younger listeners, don’t like to commit themselves months in advance, let alone to a series of concerts. Mr. Salonen envisions breaking up the season into blocks, maybe three or four, each with a thematic hook. With the culture increasingly diverse and fragmented, Mr. Salonen said, the “mainstream idea has all but disappeared.” Symphony orchestras and opera companies must accept that there is no musical mainstream, either, so institutions should try to reach “as many people as possible by catering to different tastes,” he said. That means not just unusual ventures of the kind he oversaw in Los Angeles — the Minimalist Jukebox series; festivals of film music; “The Tristan Project,” a performance of Wagner’s opera that employed as backdrops videos by Bill Viola — but also now and then a concert or mini festival devoted to Brahms or Sibelius, for those who want an immersion in a single composer. Who will help him conceive these programming blocks? Though he doesn’t know yet what to call them, Mr. Salonen has recruited a roster of mostly younger, visionary artists to advise him and create their own programs — a kind of “brain trust,” he said. This diverse creative team includes: the pianist and film composer Nicholas Britell; the soprano Julia Bullock; the flutist, educator and champion of new music Claire Chase; the violinist Pekka Kuusisto; the composer and guitarist Bryce Dessner; the composer Nico Muhly; the jazz bassist and vocalist Esperanza Spalding; and the artificial intelligence entrepreneur Carol Reiley. The “grid” will have to be loosened to allow these artists creative leeway, Mr. Salonen said. He says he’ll make it happen. Mr. Salonen has more problems with the promotion of classical music than with its substance. The message he said is often conveyed — “come and hear an immortal masterpiece performed by Maestro So-and-So and a great symphony orchestra” — is actually off-putting. “Lots of concert halls look like shrines or temples, like a Parthenon,” he added. “You climb up to make yourself worthy” and “walk out a better person.” “The good thing,” he said, “is that the actual material we are dealing with on a daily basis is fantastic” — some of “the best things humankind has ever produced.” He remains convinced that the ideal way to engage new listeners and give meaningful performances of those masterpieces is to present them alongside comparably ambitious modern and contemporary works. Mr. Salonen said that classical music is bungling what could be a selling point of orchestras. A Beyoncé concert might have a band of 20 on stage and 20,000 people in the audience, he said. That ratio is very different from what people get at the symphony, with roughly 100 players and 2,000 people. As a result, an orchestral concert becomes an event of “human energy, human expression — and people react strongly to that.” Despite his fascination with digital music resources and virtual reality, Mr. Salonen fretted that “90 percent of social media is about nothing.” “In my opinion,” he said, “when politicians say the reason for the fragmentation of culture is immigration, it’s absolutely not true.” The reason, he insisted, “is the media, which is usually not in the hands of immigrants. I think a lot of social media is trying to create some kind of belonging, some type of cultural connection.” A concert can provide that belonging. A program of symphonic music in a grand hall as an antidote to isolation bred by social media? Mr. Salonen — an explorer and, in the best sense, a traditionalist — makes a persuasive case. There’s a certain moment when you go off line and someone curates a space, with a piece, and the power of the ritual,” he said. “You have this moment, along with many others, but still a finite experience. It happens in real time, but it will never happen again, and you were there. You can let yourself go. And I think that’s actually a real liberation. We are going to need that more than ever before.” "
5c79a30c49f0eacbf105af15,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/01/arts/music/andre-previn-dead.html,"André Previn may well have been the last of the great 20th-century American musical eclectics, the artists who, in the heady post-World War II cultural moment, could — and did — have it all. Mr. Previn, who died on Thursday at 89, made a mark on Broadway and in Hollywood, on the classical concert stage and in the jazz club, in pop songs and violin concertos. [Read the Times obituary for Mr. Previn.] He did more than dabble: In all those many modes, he was always plausible, and often inspired. And he did more than merely perform. Like Leonard Bernstein, who Mr. Previn idolized and in some ways echoed, he was a great popularizer, a figure who gave the sense that it was possible to know about, and even love, everything — grand and intimate, high art and low. Figures like him are uniquely difficult to get your head — and ears — around. So writers for The New York Times have chosen a small sampling of the myriad angles of Mr. Previn and his dazzling career. When a young Mr. Previn conducted symphony orchestras, he was known to show the verve and boyish enthusiasm of a pop star. It balanced out the other way: Performing lighter fare on TV, he carried himself with a rarefied swagger. Witness it in this 1961 clip, as he performs syrupy arrangements from recent films he’s scored, including an easygoing “Bess, You Is My Woman Now” from “Porgy and Bess.” Mr. Previn cultivated a rakish, rebellious public image, but his most widely heard music sounded like the status quo. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO Mr. Previn may not have been a jazz innovator, but he was an alert and agile player. He turned “My Fair Lady” into a jazz recording, and brought out the swing in Doris Day. Even Dizzy Gillespie was a fan. “He has the flow, you know, which a lot of guys don’t have and won’t ever get,” Gillespie said. ZACHARY WOOLFE I discovered Mr. Previn’s easy-listening albums of the 1960s via that genre’s revival in the 1990s. His soundtrack for “Valley of the Dolls” remains a high-water mark — especially the theme, which he wrote with his second wife and regular collaborator, Dory Previn. The languid melody and arrangements wrap the aching lyrics in shimmery chiffon: This is the wistful sound of the other 1960s, when you realized dreams were not all they were cracked up to be. ELISABETH VINCENTELLI I once heard Mr. Previn talk self-deprecatingly about “working in a plantation called MGM Studios writing reams of music, which were kinds of encyclopedias of bad taste,” before he made the leap to the concert hall as a conductor and composer. So there is something charming about watching him conduct the London Symphony Orchestra in music a great composer originally wrote for film: Prokofiev’s “Lieutenant Kijé” Suite. Here Mr. Previn summons all the color and drive that has long made him one of my go-to conductors for recordings of Prokofiev’s ballets — especially “Romeo and Juliet” and my personal favorite, “Cinderella.” MICHAEL COOPER Some more Russian music, for which Mr. Previn had a special affinity: the finale of Shostakovich’s Symphony No. 5, in which he keeps the Chicago Symphony on a thrillingly tight leash that nevertheless allows for wondrous lyrical expansion. ZACHARY WOOLFE The end of the marriage between Mr. Previn and the violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter didn’t halt what had become a rich creative collaboration and close friendship. In a statement after his death, Ms. Mutter said that one of the first pieces he wrote for her, a violin concerto from 2001, was “an engagement present,” and the lush, sensitive orchestral writing lovingly shows off her rich tone, an elegant setting for a precious diamond. ZACHARY WOOLFE I’ll never forget hearing Mr. Previn in his jazz pianist mode, accompanying Renée Fleming in a recital at Alice Tully Hall in 2000. He backed her in songs by Arlen, Ellington and Van Heusen, and his playing was inventive, stylish and supremely musical. They also performed a remarkable song, “The Giraffes Go to Hamburg,” Mr. Previn’s setting of a rueful passage from an Isak Dinesen memoir about two captured giraffes on a cargo steamer bound for Hamburg. The song, which imaginatively adds a solo flute to the mix of voice and piano, is really an 11-minute dramatic monologue, rendered with harmonically tart, shifting and effectively understated music. ANTHONY TOMMASINI I can’t say I thought much of Mr. Previn’s operatic adaptation of “A Streetcar Named Desire” when it was new, in the late 1990s. But when I saw a semi-staged production in 2014 — starring Fleming, its original Blanche — it struck me as sensitive, articulate and sophisticated. “I Want Magic,” Blanche’s sumptuous dream of an aria, lent the title to Ms. Fleming’s memorable (if uneven) album of American opera arias.

5c93fb8349f0eacbf105e5a1,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/21/arts/music/review-boston-symphony-orchestra-carnegie-hall.html,"Many composers also perform on an instrument and conduct. But, in two recent concerts at Carnegie Hall, Thomas Adès took this to another level, demonstrating yet again his extraordinary skill as an all-around musician. Last week at Carnegie’s Zankel Hall, he more than held his own as a pianist alongside the virtuoso Kirill Gerstein in a demanding program of works for two pianos. And on Wednesday, on Carnegie’s main stage, Mr. Adès led the Boston Symphony Orchestra in the New York premiere of his new Concerto for Piano and Orchestra — written for Mr. Gerstein, who exhilaratingly dispatched this joyous and audacious piece’s formidable solo part. [Read our review of the concerto’s premiere in Boston.] To end that program, the second of two Boston Symphony concerts at Carnegie this week, Mr. Adès conducted Tchaikovsky’s Fourth Symphony. It makes sense that a composer leading this staple would bring heightened insights into how the music goes, and how the details add up to the whole. Composers wrestle with these issues in their own scores all the time. Mr. Adès brought so much more. He drew colorful and lucid playing from the orchestra, even when taking risks and driving climaxes to extremes; the players seemed willing to go along for the trip. In its day, Tchaikovsky’s symphony was a cutting-edge, contemporary work. And that’s how Mr. Adès made it sound on Wednesday night. The brass fanfare (the “fate” motif) that opens the first movement was lean, mean and loud. Yet the mood changed entirely during the sighing, restless main theme, played with yearning. There was nothing smooth, sleek or familiar about this interpretation. During episodes of development, Mr. Adès emphasized the tangled complexity of crisscrossing lines. During the slow movement, which has a wistful theme like a Russian folk song, Mr. Adès drew rich, deep tones from the strings. Yet he also teased out intricacies you seldom notice in other performances of this symphony, even if this meant the overall arc of the music lost some continuity. The scherzo, with its pizzicato strings, was crisp and playful, made intriguing by a hint of obsession. Mr. Adès and the players went all out during the frenetic finale. And why not? Perhaps I was primed to detect fresh wildness in the Tchaikovsky; I had just heard Mr. Adès’s concerto right before. Knowing that Mr. Gerstein also plays jazz piano, Mr. Adès plays to that style in this work. From the start of the bustling first movement, with a theme that seems to nod to the jerky rhythms and rising melody of “I Got Rhythm,” there are echoes of Gershwin, the jazz-inspired Ravel and more. This breathless, 20-minute concerto, structured in three essentially traditional movements (fast, slow, fast), comes across as zesty and accessible. But don’t be fooled. Just below the surface, the music sizzles with modernist harmonies, fractured phrases, gaggles of counterpoint and lyrical strands that keep breaking into skittish bits. The finale is a riotous, clattering, assaultive romp. I can’t wait to hear it again. [Read more about how the concerto was written.] The Boston Symphony’s concert on Tuesday was led by the orchestra’s music director, Andris Nelsons. It was an all-Richard Strauss program highlighted by the star soprano Renée Fleming singing a concert version of the closing scene from his final opera, “Capriccio,” which she triumphed in at the Metropolitan Opera in 2011. This scene’s radiant, gorgeous soliloquy — in which Countess Madeleine mulls which suitor, a poet or a composer, to favor, and in the process debates whether poetry or music is the greater art — was made to order for Ms. Fleming’s plush, lyrical voice. She sounded wonderful. Then she paid tribute to André Previn, who died recently, by singing a deeply expressive account of final aria from the opera he wrote for her, “A Streetcar Named Desire.” Mr. Nelsons also led a pulsing, dramatic account of “Also Sprach Zarathustra,” though I found some of the playing rough and jittery. During this performance, as on other occasions, Mr. Nelsons seemed to be physically uncomfortable, sometimes propping himself up by placing his left hand on the rail around the conductor’s podium. But that doesn’t mean the orchestra isn’t thriving under his leadership. The Boston Symphony recently picked up yet another Grammy Award for its series of Shostakovich recordings. And the latest installment — featuring the composer’s Sixth and Seventh Symphonies — was just released. "
5c8a929849f0eacbf105d158,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/14/arts/music/new-york-philharmonic-mozart-requiem-review.html,"If you want to see how an orchestra can give a fresh polish to dusty old Mozart, head to Lincoln Center. There you’ll find a surprisingly novel Mozart program — played by the New York Philharmonic on Wednesday night under Manfred Honeck and continuing through Tuesday — that, like a fugue, tells a story of the composer’s final year while mapping a journey of death and transcendence. Unlike Schubert, whose later works have an autumnal mood colored by sickness and melancholy, Mozart didn’t begin the year 1791 knowing that, months after his 35th birthday, he would fall ill and die soon after, on Dec. 5. So you would be hard-pressed to find a sense of farewell in his music from that time. In fact, for most of the year Mozart was as stylistically nimble and prolific as ever. He presented the premieres of not one, but two operas, “La Clemenza di Tito” and “Die Zauberflöte.” And, in what would be his final public appearance as a pianist, he gave the first performance of his Piano Concerto No. 27 in B flat, which the Philharmonic opened its program with on Wednesday, featuring Richard Goode. This gently dignified piece, with childlike simplicity and few extremes, all but dares its soloist to achieve majesty at a whisper, to only suggest virtuosity. Mr. Goode, an elder statesman of Mozart’s music, was calmly authoritative, gliding through quick runs and playing with restrained lyricism. Even his galloping rhythms had an unpretentious lightness, more like a pony than a Clydesdale. He didn’t perform an encore, which only heightened the contrast between the rosy concerto, a triumph of early 1791, and what followed after intermission: the Requiem, left unfinished at Mozart’s death. Mr. Honeck, who as the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra’s music director has repeatedly found original ways to present the Requiem there, opted this week for a programmatic medley: “Masonic Funeral Music,” the Requiem and “Ave Verum Corpus,” played without pause for a loose narrative about, as one of the texts says, “a foretaste of heaven in death’s agony.” “Masonic Funeral Music” is the program’s exception, the one work not from 1791. (It was written in 1785.) But listen closely and you’ll hear eerie similarities with the Requiem. Like that piece, its orchestration calls for basset horns and leans heavily on the lower strings, setting a richly somber tone that conjures an organ-like timbre. Mozart never meant for it to be an overture for the Requiem, but on Wednesday the juxtaposition was seamless. And this move — adding a prologue to the Requiem, with an epilogue on the way — was hardly as unusual as Mr. Honeck’s presentation of the Requiem itself. After Mozart’s death, the work was completed by his pupil Franz Xaver Süssmayr, whose edition was long the standard for orchestras around the world. The problem often is that it’s all too easy to tell where Mozart’s sophistication ends and Süssmayr’s well-intended inferiority begins. Mr. Honeck’s solution is to cut the final sections and present the Requiem as Mozart left it — almost. His version begins with the seven completed sections, followed by the Lacrimosa and Offertorium composed by Mozart but finished by Süssmayr. Then it ends with the Lacrimosa — though now as only Mozart’s fragment, the last eight measures of music he ever wrote. Further complicating things, Mr. Honeck, according to the Philharmonic, also has his own changes to the Süssmayr orchestrations. I may be overstating this Requiem’s complexity. In the concert hall, it was natural and succinct, never losing steam as the work often does. And the Westminster Symphonic Choir was stirring in the choral passages, with stabbing staccatos in the Dies Irae and glorious radiance in the Rex Tremendae. The four soloists each had distinctive qualities — standouts were the tenor Ben Bliss, who brought the dramatic textures you might hear in his Mozart over at the Metropolitan Opera, and Megan Mikailovna Samarin, making her Philharmonic debut with a penetrating mezzo-soprano — yet they blended with impressive grace. Mr. Honeck could have let the concert evaporate into mysterious quiet with the Lacrimosa; but, by ending with “Ave Verum Corpus,” the famously spiritual conductor seemed to be making a statement. If the Requiem is a plea for eternal rest, then this brief work, played on Wednesday with a soft glow, promises that and more: serene transcendence. "
5c86b05d49f0eacbf105c7a7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/11/arts/music/carnegie-hall-vienna-philharmonic.html,"Say the phrase “classical music” and many will imagine a renowned symphony orchestra playing masterpieces of the distant past at Carnegie Hall. Last week, you could live that fantasy again and again at Carnegie, probably the most famous concert space in the world. The Vienna Philharmonic played towering works by Mozart, Beethoven, Brahms and Mahler over four programs. The Philadelphia Orchestra played Schubert’s Ninth Symphony. But music is about more than big symphonies, and it’s about more than the past. I went to nine concerts over seven days at Carnegie, a dizzying musical marathon, and it was a concentrated reminder that what is special about this art form is its variety — its intimacy and its grandeur, its capacity to draw inspiration from the past yet speak to the present. How to foster new music, support emerging composers and connect classical music — that inadequate term — to today, while also maintaining the legacy of major ensembles performing the great works of the past? And how to preserve that legacy? Faithfully honor historical performance styles? Jolt timeless scores with new approaches? Last week was just a random one at the hall, but it showed how Carnegie manages to engage all sides of these debates — the vast sprawl of the classical field in the 21st century — better than almost anywhere else. The hall’s three spaces make this range of repertory and experience possible. Sleek and modern Zankel Hall, down in the basement, hosted the premiere of a powerful multimedia piece dealing with racial profiling and a prison system that inordinately targets young African-American men. Zankel was small enough for the Chiaroscuro Quartet’s period instruments and mellow gut strings to be heard in a lean, dusky-toned account of Schubert’s “Death and the Maiden.” Snug, politely classic-looking Weill Recital Hall practically vibrated from the hip French harpsichordist Jean Rondeau’s concert, a walk on the wilder side of Bach and Scarlatti, while the master pianist Andras Schiff played Janacek and Schumann in the main auditorium. A single piano on that huge stage remains one of the most dramatic images in music. The tension between innovation and tradition was on display during the Vienna Philharmonic’s first program, on March 2, when Adam Fischer led a robust, majestic account of Beethoven’s “Eroica” Symphony. As always, you could bask in this magnificent orchestra’s resplendent sound — the warmth and body of the strings, the reedy tang of the woodwinds, the dark richness of the brass. Even during intense passages, the transparency of the playing was marvelous. Yet, for all its splendors, there was a slightly self-important quality to the performance that kept me a little distant, as if the orchestra was claiming ownership of a work from the glory days of Viennese classicism and showing an American audience how it’s played at home. That the Vienna Philharmonic, so beholden to tradition, can discover Beethoven anew was triumphantly proved a few nights later, when the pianist Igor Levit was the soloist in the Third Piano Concerto, with Michael Tilson Thomas conducting. In Mr. Levit’s hands, a probing performance can seem excitingly dangerous. A telling example was the extended development section of the first movement. This episode, lasting a few minutes, is marked to be played softly. At first, the movement’s stern main theme is recalled by the piano — but mysteriously, quietly, in octaves. Then, supported by the orchestra, the piano elongates the theme and takes exploratory excursions into genial-sounding passages of spiraling triples. But there was nothing genial about Mr. Levit’s approach. He played the whole episode not just softly, but as if whispered. Crucial notes were given just enough extra nudge to make them startling. The music-making was ruminative yet purposeful, unsettling yet assured. The next evening, Mr. Thomas led Mahler’s 85-minute Ninth Symphony, a work given its premiere in 1912 by, yes, the Vienna Philharmonic. As a musician who revels in the stylistic melting pot that is American musical culture, Mr. Thomas embraced the deliberate mix of the sublime and the banal, the hints of church chorales and country dances that run though Mahler’s symphonies, especially the Rondo-Burleske movement of this one. Yet he also conveyed the elaborate structure of the score. Here was a performance that drew upon the orchestra’s great heritage while pushing it to take risks. On Thursday, alas, I had to leave Mr. Rondeau’s recital early to make it to Mr. Schiff’s concert downstairs. Mr. Rondeau, with his long hair, scraggly beard and rumpled shirt, exuded wild-eyed charisma and channeled it into his performance. Dispatching Baroque passagework with impeccable clarity, even at breakneck tempos, he brought improvisational flair to his playing — he also plays jazz — especially an impetuous account of Bach’s Fantasia in C minor. It was a different mood in the main auditorium, where Mr. Schiff, wearing a three-piece suit, looked every bit the distinguished master as he bowed to the audience. Once he began Janacek’s episodic suite “On the Overgrown Path,” he played with searching insight, rhapsodic freedom and uncompromising musical integrity. And talk about bringing freshness to familiar repertory: The immensely gifted pianist Jan Lisiecki practically kick-started Mendelssohn’s youthful Piano Concerto in G minor into action on Friday with the Philadelphia Orchestra, led by Yannick Nézet-Séguin. But it was the raw, cry from the soul new work, “The Just and the Blind,” that has stayed with me from my marathon. Part of Carnegie’s 125 Commissions Project, begun in honor of the hall’s 125th birthday in 2016, it’s a 60-minute piece by the spoken-word poet Marc Bamuthi Joseph, with music by Daniel Bernard Roumain. Though it includes a dancer (Drew Dollaz), a vocalist (Somi) and projected animations and videos, the work is driven by Mr. Joseph’s stinging, brilliant words and is structured as a series of vignettes. Mr. Joseph voices the thoughts of a black father who admits to being afraid when, at night, he walks past young black men who look the same age as his son. Every day, he tells his son, the boy’s main mission in life is “to come home to me.” Stretches of Mr. Roumain’s score, which he mostly plays on piano and violin, are alternately jazzy and modernist. A rhythmically frenetic section will segue into a breezily cool passage. But Mr. Roumain knows when to pull the music back so Mr. Joseph’s searing words can do their work. Is this classical music? Perhaps not by traditional definitions. But it speaks to where Carnegie has come that it fit in at the hall just as well as the Vienna Philharmonic. "
5c74323049f0eacbf105a101,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/25/arts/music/review-matthew-polenzani-janacek.html,"A young farmer meets a girl with black eyes as deep as the sea, and can’t stop thinking of her. Noticing the young woman nearby as he plows a field, he worries his oxen will see how rattled he is. They make love. She becomes pregnant. Though he’s anguished over leaving his family and home, he bows to fate and goes off with her. This could be the stark plot of an opera by Janacek, who was drawn to tales of peasants sundered by desire. It’s also the narrative thread of that composer’s pathbreaking, emotionally raw song cycle “The Diary of One Who Disappeared.” The tenor Matthew Polenzani devoted the second half of a remarkable recital on Sunday at Zankel Hall to a fervently sung performance of the 35-minute work, accompanied by the pianist Julius Drake. Completed in 1920, “Diary” is seldom heard, though the Brooklyn Academy of Music will present Ivo van Hove’s production of the work in April. The score is an unusual hybrid of a song cycle (settings of 22 poems by Josef Kalda) and a quasi-opera for two characters: Jan, the smitten young man, and Zefka, the willful Romany girl (a mezzo-soprano who appears during an episode that could be an operatic seduction scene). Three female singers relate turns in the drama, like a Greek chorus. As in his powerful operas, Janacek is fixated in this cycle on setting the words to music that reflects the contours, sounds and rhythms of the Czech language. Still, for all their naturalism, the vocal lines also achieve agitated, plaintive lyricism. The piano sometimes steps back to provide bare harmonic support. Mostly, though, the instrument engages the vocal lines, shifting from moments of folkloric melody to passages of disorienting sonorities, or to stretches that become obsessed with a strange repeated riff. Mr. Polenzani brought baffled tenderness to the opening songs, in which Jan is distressed by his longing. But he sang with piercing intensity and terror during the cycle’s tumultuous episodes, when Jan becomes unhinged. The mezzo-soprano Jennifer Johnson Cano, fresh from her performance on Friday as Meg Page in Verdi’s “Falstaff” at the Metropolitan Opera, brought rich sound and coolly seductive allure to the songs in which Zefka appears. Kathleen O’Mara, Marie Engle and Megan Esther Grey, performing from an upper balcony near the stage, sang the music of the mysterious chorus. Mr. Drake played commandingly, including a piano solo depicting the consummation of this impulsive love — fitful music of hurtling chords and steely harmonies. To offer a quite different take on Romany life, Ms. Cano also performed Brahms’s appealing “Zigeunerlieder,” evocations of what was widely thought to be “Gypsy” music — though all Brahms knew of the style were the fluffy approximations played at the time in Viennese cafes. In the first half, Mr. Polenzani offered sensitive, deeply focused performances of six Schubert songs, followed by a nuanced yet forthright account of Beethoven’s song cycle “An die Ferne Geliebte.” While none of the music was written more recently than a hundred years ago, this program felt like a subtle model of artistic adventurousness.

5c79785b49f0eacbf105aea4,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/01/arts/music/review-new-york-philharmonic-herbert-blomstedt.html,"If you didn’t know that the esteemed conductor Herbert Blomstedt was 91, you never would have guessed it from observing him in action with the New York Philharmonic on Thursday at David Geffen Hall. Still trim and agile, with thick white hair and plenty of stamina, he led vibrant accounts of works by Grieg and Dvorak, moving steadily and cuing the players with elegant, unfussy gestures. Naturalness in music-making is a hard quality to define. But there is no better way to describe the glowing, unforced performances Mr. Blomstedt drew from the Philharmonic. In a way, it was risky to begin with Grieg’s “Peer Gynt” Suite No. 1. How do you rescue this beloved staple from predictability? Actually, conductors may be avoiding it for that very reason: This was the first Philharmonic performance of the suite in almost 16 years. Mr. Blomstedt’s rendering abounded in freshness and character. In “Morning,” the first piece, he shaped the lapping melody in the strings, which gently dips and rises, with lovely flow and directness. By acutely voicing the sonorities in the subdued yet tragic “Ase’s Death,” Mr. Blomstedt made a case for Grieg as an inspired harmonist. “Anitra’s Dance” sparkled and teased. “In the Hall of the Mountain King” — music known to anyone who watched cartoons on television as a child — was all the more ominous for the hulking, eerily restrained and heavy-footed way it began here, building inexorably to brassy terror. Another Grieg staple, the Piano Concerto in A minor, was offered next, with the pianist Jean-Yves Thibaudet conveying the music’s rhapsodic sweep and bold contrasts as soloist. There was plenty of Mr. Thibaudet’s trademark refinement in his playing of lacy, ruminative, lyrical passages. He dispatched bursts of arpeggios and spiraling figures with virtuosic élan. Yet I especially liked the way he tore into vehement episodes: He tossed off bursts of double octaves with steely fortissimo sound, and brought earthy rawness to the driving left-hand chords and crunchy theme that opens the finale, which sounded like a dark Norwegian dance. Mr. Blomstedt ended with a spirited account of Dvorak’s hearty Eighth Symphony. It can be hard to make the episodic final movement hang together, but he found common ground between sections in which the stately theme is played with Brahmsian majesty and sudden outbursts when that music is turned into a rowdy Bohemian dance. This performance captured the musical variety while making the movement seem structurally integrated. The players enthusiastically applauded Mr. Blomstedt, along with the audience. He is not on the Philharmonic’s guest conductor roster for next season, alas. That he’ll be busy elsewhere seems a pretty good bet. "
5c91405d49f0eacbf105de9a,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/19/business/media/ariana-grande-7-rings-rodgers-hammerstein.html,"This week, Ariana Grande’s “7 Rings” hit No. 1 on Billboard’s singles chart for the sixth time, the latest victory for a song that broke records when it was released in January and has since been streamed more than a billion times around the world. But when it comes to royalties for “7 Rings,” the biggest winner may be two songwriters who died decades ago: Rodgers and Hammerstein. Ms. Grande’s song is an extended reinterpretation of “My Favorite Things” from “The Sound of Music,” with Ms. Grande changing the original’s lyrics about innocent joys — “raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens” — to an anthem of empowerment through conspicuous consumption. “Breakfast at Tiffany’s and bottles of bubbles,” she sings, over a bass-heavy beat. “Buy myself all of my favorite things.” The song is credited to a total of 10 writers. But two of them — Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II — control 90 percent of the songwriting royalties, a remarkable split that reflects the value of evergreen song catalogs, and of the negotiating leverage their owners have when pop stars come seeking permission. In an especially speedy turnaround, the deal for “7 Rings” was decided a few weeks before the song’s release in January, when representatives for Ms. Grande and her label, Republic, brought the completed song to Concord, the music company that has owned the Rodgers and Hammerstein catalog since 2017. Concord requested 90 percent of Ms. Grande’s song, and her representatives accepted without further negotiation. Ms. Grande’s song “wouldn’t exist in its current form were it not for ‘My Favorite Things,’” Jake Wisely, Concord’s chief publishing executive, said in an interview. The deal means that Concord stands to make millions of dollars from the song, while Ms. Grande and her seven co-writers will each get just a fraction of what Concord makes. (The songwriting royalties are separate from the earnings Ms. Grande will make as the recording artist. Through her label, she declined to comment.) Theodore S. Chapin, the executive who has managed Rodgers and Hammerstein’s copyrights for decades, said he was initially taken aback by Ms. Grande’s song. But he quickly saw its value as a reinterpretation, and as a way of keeping the original’s legacy alive among Ms. Grande’s young fans. He also thought that Mary Rodgers, Richard Rodgers’s composer daughter, who died in 2014, “would have thought this is pretty kick-ass.” Although it has long had a conservative reputation for protecting its copyrights, the Rodgers and Hammerstein Organization has a distinct history of making commercial deals. Rodgers, who died in 1979, even approved a Clairol ad that changed a famous lyric from “South Pacific”: “I’m gonna wash that gray right outa my hair.” “The fact that Rodgers had agreed to that in his lifetime,” Mr. Chapin said, “gave all of us a little license to feel that we should keep an open mind on these kinds of things.” Yet the license for “7 Rings” is especially favorable to Rodgers and Hammerstein. When Gwen Stefani used some of the yodeling “Lonely Goatherd” (also from “The Sound of Music”) for a 2006 song, “Wind It Up,” Rodgers and Hammerstein received only 50 percent of the royalties. The difference between the two deals could reflect Concord’s greater negotiating power. Or, according to Lisa Alter, a lawyer who specializes in music copyright, it could just be that “My Favorite Things” is a more precious property. “It probably implies that more of the song is being used, or how iconic the original song is,” said Ms. Alter, who was not involved with the “7 Rings” deal. And what might Rodgers and Hammerstein themselves have thought of Ms. Grande’s song? Todd S. Purdum, the author of “Something Wonderful: Rodgers and Hammerstein’s Broadway Revolution,” said the masters of musical theater enjoyed being in the thick of popular culture. But most important, he said, they were never ashamed of commercial success. “They would love the ka-ching of it,” Mr. Purdum said. "
5c6d176f3a125f5075c0a8b6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/20/arts/music/chaka-khan-hello-happiness.html,"It’s been 12 years since Chaka Khan released a studio album, but “I wasn’t sitting, twiddling my thumbs,” the singer known as the Queen of Funk said recently. She was touring and stealthily recording two albums. The first, “Hello Happiness,” out this month, is full of upbeat, powerful tracks that wouldn’t be out of place on a “Soul Train” line. For this record, Khan teamed with the singer-songwriter Sarah Ruba Taylor and the producer Switch (M.I.A., Santigold), and served as a co-producer, co-writer and percussionist (she played timbales on the single “Like Sugar”). Khan writes quickly, in the studio, sometimes from poems she jots down on whatever is handy. “I think with every track, what the song is about is already there before you put the words down,” she said. For this album, “no deep thoughts were necessary. It was a lot of fun.” In a phone interview from Chicago, her hometown, where she was shooting a TV show and visiting with family, the enduring voice behind hits like “I’m Every Woman” explained why she wanted to make a danceable record now. “I’m a happier person these days,” she said. “My entire life has been challenging and troublesome — and great, you dig? I may go in and out, like everybody else. I’m going through a nice slot right here. I’m achieving some things that I wanted to for a long time.” At 65, Khan — who used to play basketball with her longtime friend Prince (“I’m not trying to run around the court,” she said, but “I can shoot”) — talked about her recent rehab stint, taking ownership over her career and why she has no plans to retire. “I can still play basketball right now,” she said, “and I can still drop it like it’s hot onstage.” These are edited excerpts from the conversation. Why did you wait so long to release these songs? I wanted to release them in a good way, and remain a free artist, not tied down to some large label for 100 years. [Khan said she hasn’t had a label deal for at least a decade.] It was like working for somebody, having a job — no artistic freedom and no say-so with anything. Whereas what I’m doing is very different. I don’t see it as a job. It’s a calling. Did you have an awakening when you realized, this is not fair, I should get more of a stake in this? Prince and I sort of came to that conclusion at the same time. We did a CD together, called “Come 2 My House.” We were both with the same label, I just didn’t put “slave” on my face. You’re known as one of the premier vocal arrangers. Are there artists continuing in your footsteps, or is it a skill that’s dying out? I don’t know what other people are really doing, as far as that’s concerned. I think there’s a lot of shenanigans going on with vocals these days, actually, but the gift that I got, it’s just natural. I don’t really look the gift horse in the mouth — I just go and do what has to be done, you dig? I give it as little thought as possible. I don’t even really listen to music. Really? Not even jazz or classical at home? No. If I have friends over for dinner or drinks, whatever, then I’ll play some music. If I’m being driven in my assistant’s car, she’s got a great catalog we listen to in the car, and that’s it. Or if I find a club where a good jazz band is playing, I may go. That’s very rare. This is what I do for a living. When I want to relax, I prefer passive entertainment, like looking at the telly. I like “Forensic Files,” and some horror. Animal channel. In 2016, you announced that you were entering rehab, prompted by Prince’s death. Was your issue with pain pills longstanding? On and off. I had a knee replacement thing going on, aggravated by flying and walking a lot, and working. I went to a pain management clinic and I was seeing a professional. I stopped self-medicating. I’m good. Your career has spanned so many eras, do you miss things from any period in particular? Working in the ’80s with [the producer] Arif Mardin, in New York, really made my life happen. I really miss him. And he challenged me vocally and musically, and I miss that kind of interaction. The music I did in the ’80s I think was my best music. Working with Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie, Chick Corea — all the greats that I grew up listening to. Was Davis abrasive or charming when you worked with him? Very charming. I don’t know how he was with other people, but he was sweet to me. [We’d] go out to dinner, go see a lot of jazz, go to his house, listen to music, with he and Cicely [Tyson, his wife at the time]. Do you still get the same electric charge out of performing that you did early on? No, the charge is different, it’s changed throughout the years. But I still am nervous before I go onstage — that’s something that has not changed. You could call it lightweight stage fright. I’m anxious, any day I have to work, and I can’t eat. I don’t really feel comfortable onstage until at least the third song. And how do you feel when you get offstage? If it’s a really good show, I don’t remember what I did. I have to ask my colleagues. Anytime I do a particularly good show, I get lost, I go somewhere else. You grew up in a musical household; was being a performer something that you considered from a young age? I didn’t realize it at a young age, but it was my calling even at that time. We all sang around the house, when we cleaned up on Saturdays, listening to Frank Sinatra, Sarah Vaughan. And I thought everybody’s family did that; I thought everybody could sing. I only realized that I had something that people really liked during a talent show, when people threw money on the stage after I sang. I thought, “Oh, O.K., remember that.” I was maybe 14. Your contemporaries, like Anita Baker, are staging farewell tours. Do you see your career arcing that way? I couldn’t even begin to think that. This is my life, this is why I’m here on this planet. How could I retire? This is who I am. What is the next album you have coming? I’m working on a Joni Mitchell project right now, who’s a great friend. I have her blessing. I’m doing my favorite songs of Joni’s. Not her hits — the songs that have kept me alive on tour. When I’m on the bus, I always put on Joni Mitchell. She would revive me, in a big way — the music, the things she said, the philosopher in her. She’s my favorite writer, singer-songwriter. I don’t even remember when I first met her; it’s been a while. What shape does your friendship take now? We mostly visit each other. We’ve been going out a lot lately, since she’s been better [Mitchell had serious health issues for years; in 2015, she suffered a brain aneurysm]. She’s making great strides. I’ve been going to her house a lot lately. We live like five minutes from each other. She comes to my house, I go to her house, we play music, we drink wine, we talk, we have a good time. We go out sometimes, to see a band, to dinner — lots of dinners. What was the last band you saw? I don’t remember. Some guys that were playing in an Italian restaurant. When you’re in that setting, do they call you up onstage? Do you go? Most of the time, I do, if I like the band. But they always call me up — that’s another reason I don’t go out much. [Laughs] I noticed in a lot of your recent appearances, including Aretha Franklin’s funeral, and on your album cover, you’re holding a giant fan. Explain, please. I sell fans. I’m opening my store soon online, I’ll be selling them, as well as some bags, and a hair-care line, some makeup stuff. At my age, I’m into creating passive income. When I don’t want to go on a tour, I don’t have to go on a tour, so I can make money while I sleep, or while I watch TV. But I always loved fans. I’ve been using them forever, since I started going to Japan in the early ’70s. A lot of people imagine that an artist like you would basically be rolling in it. And what I’m hearing is that you feel like were subjected to deals that cheated you out of royalties. And now you have to restructure. Absolutely, the story of my life, yes. This is my work, it’s all I have, and I should own it. I now know my worth, O.K. — I really do. And that’s how I’m going to live out the rest of my life, period. I’m not going to sell myself cheap or short. I’m not good old Chaka Khan anymore, you can’t call on me when somebody else said they can’t do the gig — “Ask Chaka, she’ll do it.” I used to be like that, but I’m not doing that anymore. And when you want to hire me, you better have some money. That’s it. "
5c4223b03a125f5075c052f8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/18/arts/music/r-kelly-rca-sony.html,"For years, R. Kelly had seemed untouchable. Acquitted on charges of child pornography, accused of misconduct with underage girls, Mr. Kelly long remained embraced by the music industry. He toured widely, appearing at Grammy parties and making records with stars like Lady Gaga and Jay-Z. But on Friday, Mr. Kelly — once one of the biggest and most influential stars in pop music — was dropped by his record company, RCA, in the music industry’s highest-profile casualty of the #MeToo era. RCA’s agreement to part ways with Robert Kelly, confirmed by a person briefed on the move who declined to be identified because the deal was confidential, came after weeks of protests. A recent television documentary, “Surviving R. Kelly,” drew wide attention for its visceral testimonials by women who said that as underage girls they had been lured into sexual relationships with Mr. Kelly, and abused by him mentally and physically. Yet as pressure had mounted on RCA — including from other artists on its roster — the company remained silent. The news of Mr. Kelly’s departure was first reported by Billboard, and RCA, a unit of Sony Music Entertainment, made no formal announcement; by Friday afternoon, Mr. Kelly had simply been scrubbed from the label’s website. Activists who had been calling for Mr. Kelly’s dismissal cheered the decision, while still criticizing RCA for its slow pace, and they pushed the entertainment industry to punish Mr. Kelly further. “After years of profiting from R. Kelly, despite their knowledge of his sexual abuse of black girls, Sony’s RCA is finally acting,” Arisha Hatch of the group Color of Change said in a statement. Time’s Up called on streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music to remove his music. “All allies in the fight against sexual violence,” the group wrote on Twitter, “must take a stand on this toxic issue.” Accusations of misconduct by Mr. Kelly, 52, date to the mid-1990s, when it was revealed that, at 27, he secretly married his 15-year-old protégée, Aaliyah; their marriage certificate falsely listed her age as 18. The union was quickly annulled. Aaliyah died in a plane crash in 2001. Lurid reports of misconduct followed, many of them in The Chicago Sun-Times, including accounts from women who said that Mr. Kelly had sex with them when they were as young as 15. In 2002, Mr. Kelly was charged with multiple counts of child pornography over a videotape that prosecutors alleged showed him having sex with a 14-year-old girl. But he was acquitted of all charges in 2008, after the young woman said to be on the tape would not testify. Mr. Kelly has denied abusing or mistreating any women. Don Russell, who identified himself as the “top adviser” to Mr. Kelly, said on Friday that other labels were interested in signing Mr. Kelly, though he declined to identify them. Mr. Kelly, he said, is eager to move on. “Once this thing pivots with the negative press, the defamation of character and the false allegations,” Mr. Russell said, “we will look at repositioning this to allow him to get some of the content he has out there.” Even as accusations mounted against Mr. Kelly, he continued to have a high-profile career, writing and producing hits and earning an uneasy respect from many music critics who saw him as an innovator and a rare talent. According to the Recording Industry Association of America, Mr. Kelly has sold at least 32 million albums in the United States alone. But the public opinion began to turn against him again in 2017, after an investigation published by BuzzFeed News said that he had been holding women against their will in an abusive “cult.” In that report, former members of Mr. Kelly’s inner circle said that he was holding at least six women in a form of captivity, “dictating what they eat, how they dress, when they bathe, when they sleep and how they engage in sexual encounters that he records.” Online outrage over that reporting led to a social media campaign, #MuteRKelly. “Surviving R. Kelly,” broadcast in six parts this month by Lifetime, reinvigorated that campaign, leading to protests outside the corporate offices of RCA and Sony in New York and Culver City, Calif. Prosecutors in Chicago and Atlanta, where Mr. Kelly has lived, have asked women to come forward, but Mr. Kelly has not been charged with a crime. Celebrities like Lady Gaga, Celine Dion and Chance the Rapper, who collaborated with Mr. Kelly in the past, distanced themselves with contrite statements; Lady Gaga removed a 2013 track, “Do What U Want,” from online music services. Asante McGee, a fan who became part of Mr. Kelly’s entourage, said that during her time with him, he forbade her from looking other men in the eye and made her ask permission to go to the bathroom. Ms. McGee said in an interview on Friday that she felt vindicated knowing Kelly was finally facing consequences. “I am relieved,” Ms. McGee said. “His time is coming to an end.” For the women in the documentary and their families, the release of “Surviving R. Kelly” also brought fears of retaliation. On Friday, a man who has been part of Kelly’s management team, Henry James Mason, turned himself in to the authorities in Georgia, after being wanted on a warrant for terroristic threats and acts against Timothy Savage, whose daughter Joycelyn is believed to be living with Kelly. Mr. Mason denied the accusations. Mr. Savage and his wife, Jonjelyn, appeared in the documentary saying that they had not had contact with their daughter in years. Last year, TMZ published a video in which Joycelyn Savage said she was happy living with Mr. Kelly and was there of her own volition. Last week, Mr. Kelly’s lawyer, Steven Greenberg, called the relationships “perfectly consensual” and said that Mr. Kelly never knowingly had sex with anyone underage. Terms of Mr. Kelly’s exit deal — including what, if anything, RCA paid him to terminate the contract — were not disclosed. He had been signed to Jive Records — now owned by Sony — in 1991 and had most recently renewed his RCA contract a few years ago, according to two people with knowledge of that deal. According to the person briefed on Mr. Kelly’s exit talks, RCA had been discussing the move for months with his legal team, well before the release of the Lifetime documentary but after the #MuteRKelly movement had gained momentum. Yet what will become of Mr. Kelly’s career is unclear. His music remains available on streaming services, and his valuable back catalog — with hits like “I Believe I Can Fly” and “Ignition (Remix)” — will remain the property of RCA. Mr. Kelly was also quietly dropped last year by the Universal Music Publishing Group, yet that company still controls the songwriting rights for his past songs. Mr. Kelly will most likely earn royalties off his past hits for years. For many in the industry, the question of censorship weighs heavily over any decision to remove music from circulation — particularly in the streaming era, when deletion of an album means it has been all but erased. Spotify faced criticism over these issues last year when it instituted a poorly defined “hateful conduct” policy that seemed to largely affect black artists, including Mr. Kelly; their tracks were removed from Spotify’s official playlists but remained available for fans to listen to. After an industry uproar, the policy was rescinded within three weeks. Mr. Kelly’s star has faded in recent years; his last album for RCA, “12 Nights of Christmas,” released in 2016, reached only No. 177 on the Billboard chart. And his most recent songs have been released on the streaming platform SoundCloud, without the involvement of RCA. Those kinds of outlets, which are often used by up-and-coming artists, may now present an avenue for Kelly to release music in the future. “Like it or not, R Kelly still has fans and defenders,” said Bill Werde, the director of Syracuse University’s Bandier Program on the music industry. “There are people who love his music so much, they are willing to ignore or rationalize the awful realities brought to life in the documentary,” he added. “And the modern music business means he still has plenty of ways to reach those people.” "
5c9e188249f0eacbf105fbf0,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/29/arts/music/beth-gibbons-portishead-polish-gorecki-3-symphony.html,"WARSAW — Beth Gibbons, the lead singer of the British band Portishead, released her first record in over a decade on Friday. But it’s not what you would expect from the singer whose wracked, yearning voice helped make Portishead a staple of every cool and heartbroken student’s dorm room in the 1990s. After the pioneering trip-hop of the band’s debut album, “Dummy,” and industrial beats of its last, “Third,” Gibbons’s newest release is a recording of the Polish composer Henryk Gorecki’s Symphony No. 3, known as the “Symphony of Sorrowful Songs.” Gorecki’s symphony, as its name suggests, is a doleful piece: The lyrics for one movement are taken from a message an 18-year-old scrawled on the walls of a prison during World War II. (“No mother, do not weep,” it begins.) That somehow didn’t stop it from being a surprise hit in the 1990s, with one recording selling over a million copies. That might sound like safe ground for Gibbons, a singer who specializes in tragedy. But it was apparently anything but. For a start, the symphony’s vocal part is written for a classical soprano; Gibbons’s voice doesn’t go that high. And all the lyrics are in Polish, a language Gibbons doesn’t speak. A news release for the recording said there were months of preparation for the 2014 concert where the recording was made. But how hard was it really for her to do this? The singer never gives interviews, and declined a request for one for this article. But some of the people who worked on the performance make it sound as if she had no problems at all. “A good singer can sing even in Chinese or Japanese,” the composer Krzysztof Penderecki, who conducted the performance, said in an interview in Warsaw last month. “It’s about emotional understanding. Beth, she did a very good job. She sounds really Polish.” Filip Berkowicz, a concert promoter who came up with the idea for the performance, agreed that Gibbons had few problems. “I knew she was well prepared, but I was very tense as she appeared on stage,” he said in an email. “But when she began to sing, tears ran down my cheeks.” There is only one way you can really realize what Gibbons put herself through: by trying to learn Gorecki’s Symphony No. 3 for yourself. So last month I tried to do just that, and had a lesson with Anna Marchwinska, the head of the music staff at Poland’s National Opera. She is also one of two women who trained Gibbons for the concert. “Polish is really hard to sing in, even for Poles,” said Marchwinska, before the lesson in her office at Warsaw’s opera house. “We have too many consonants.” She then wrote “Szczęście,” the Polish word for happiness on a pad. “See!” she said. “How do you sing that?” Marchwinska has coached singers in languages ranging from German to Hungarian, she said. Her method is to break each word down into syllables, and get the singer to repeat them, over and over, until they get it right and become used to the feel of the word in the mouth. If they can’t say it properly, she uses analogies to help them understand how something should sound or how to shape their lips. “Sex always works well,” she said. Once the first syllable is right, it’s onto the next, then the next, until a singer knows enough words to sing a line. “It can be very tedious,” Marchwinska said. “This is your first note,” Marchwinska then said, pointing to the score for Gorecki’s piece. “It’s an easy one,” she added. She then made the sound “sy,” the first part of “synku” (the Polish word for son). “She,” I replied. “Sy,” Marchwinska said. “She,” I said back. Marchwinska made a face that suggested she was not impressed. Gibbons and Marchwinska worked together over several weekends in 2014, when the singer traveled to the pop star’s home near Bristol, England. They held three sessions a day, each lasting about an hour, or until Gibbons’s children got in the way, Marchwinska said. “I enjoyed it,” she said, “ but I thought it was very difficult for her. She was frustrated a lot of the time. She wanted to quit a lot of the time, as she didn’t feel she could give justice to the music emotionally.” Emotion is the last thing any singer can actually add to music, Marchwinska said: Pronunciation comes first, then singing, then understanding. “It’s only then you can have the emotional interpretation,” she said. “It’s actually quite a complicated process, when I think about it.” I asked Marchwinska to teach me the symphony’s hardest vocal part and she jumped straight to a line that read, “Ej, cwierkejcie mu tam, wy ptosecki boze” (“Oh, sing for him, God’s little songbirds”). She read it out. I laughed: It sounded impossible to say, let alone sing. “When she heard it, Beth had the same reaction,” Marchwinska said. The first word turned out to be easy — it sounds like “ay” — but then we got to the next. Marchwinska said the first syllable: “Chfier,” it sounded like. I repeated it. Marchwinska told me to try again, and roll the “r.” She then told me to try saying it in a Scottish accent, to help get my tongue in the right place. After several more attempts, she gave up. “You can’t even roll your ‘r′s?” she said. “Beth could do that!” Even some opera singers struggle with new languages, Marchwinska said. In April, the Polish National Opera will perform “Billy Budd,” by Benjamin Britten, and a few members of the largely Polish cast were finding the English a challenge, she added. (A British vocal coach has been hired for the production.) But for most singers, used to French, German and Italian, another language is not a problem. Smartphones have helped, Marchwinska added, as singers can record lessons. (Gibbons recorded all hers.) Google Translate is also a godsend. Reading music, however, is a whole different skill. Gibbons couldn’t read a score properly when she started learning the piece, Marchwinska said. She had to draw Gibbons a simple one, with words and numbers rather than hundreds of notes. The symphony, for example, begins with a 12-minute passage for the orchestra; a piano note is then heard three times before the soprano enters. Marchwinska said she wrote the word “piano” in a space to represent the final piano note, and numbers to show that Gibbons should count to three, then sing. Given all this, it was no surprise to learn that Gibbons was nervous on the night of the performance and even asked Marchwinska what she should wear, Marchwinska said. (She decided against Marchwinska’s suggestion of a gown, and went for a simple black top and pants.) And what did Marchwinska think of the actual performance? “It was good,” she said. “It was so unusual.” When classical singers perform the symphony, it can sound similar each time, she said. “This,” she added, “was different.” "

5c9e5f2e49f0eacbf105fcd4,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/29/arts/music/tyshawn-sorey-review.html,"Tyshawn Sorey, the composer and multi-instrumentalist, identified one goal of his artistic practice while onstage Thursday night at the Miller Theater at Columbia University. Specifically, he said, he has been working toward a “model of music that perpetuates itself.” That might sound like a conceptual-art statement. But the more you explore the wide-ranging impulses and examples that spur him on, the more it seems concrete. Famously uninterested in genre labels, as well as supposedly hard-and-fast distinctions between improvisation and composition, Mr. Sorey has established momentum in different lanes that are often thought of as mutually exclusive. His long-running trio can be heard in intimate jazz clubs like the Village Vanguard. Meantime, an imaginative, dramatic piece inspired by Josephine Baker (written for the soprano Julia Bullock) can hold down and electrify vaster environs, like the grand staircase of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Miller Theater sits somewhere in between, in terms of both its programming and its size. And so it made sense for Mr. Sorey’s concert Thursday — the latest in the Composer Portraits series — to present a range of hues from his creative spectra. The concert’s first hour was tight and focused. When playing the concert’s opening work, “In Memoriam Muhal Richard Abrams,” the violinist Jennifer Curtis and the keyboardist Cory Smythe (heard here on celesta) gave a sense of Mr. Sorey’s artistry when working with meditative sparseness. In this mode, the composer’s changes can come slowly — as with the steady movement from a parched, dry violin tone to something more conventionally lovely — yet their culmination often ends up feeling voluptuous. That result is from the variety of effects being presented, as well as the time lavished on each one. Mr. Sorey tends to reward a listener’s patience, over the course of a set, thanks to starkly contrasting energies. In “Ornations,” the flutist Claire Chase and the clarinetist Joshua Rubin presented the hyperkinetic side of the composer’s style. At some points solo riffs were passed back and forth between the players like friendly provocations. Even better were the urgent passages during which both players seemed taxed to their individual limits, while still needing to listen closely to one another to create a well-blended sense of chaos. The final opus in this opening set was the New York premiere of “Everything Changes, Nothing Changes,” played by the JACK Quartet. Aptly titled, it seemed both static and constantly in motion. In recalling the more delicate textures heard at the concert’s opening, this piece for string quartet also brought a sense of closure to the first hour. The music after intermission (and after an onstage Q. and A. between Mr. Sorey and Ms. Chase) was dominated by the world premiere of “Autoschediasms,” a work for creative chamber orchestra. Premised on his personal approach to “spontaneous composition,” Mr. Sorey described the work as being created by all the musicians onstage and himself. (He conducted the players and provided instructional prompts via a small dry-erase board.) The lengthy piece was not without interest. There were too many fascinating artists for that to be the case. But for me, this performance did not consistently channel the purposeful quality of Mr. Sorey’s other efforts. When Mr. Sorey and Ms. Chase reunited to close the concert with “Bertha’s Lair,” it was another reminder of the high bar that he sets for himself and his collaborators. Though I’d heard (and enjoyed) this flute-and-percussion piece quite recently, at the Kitchen, it was exciting to encounter it again — given that both performers are invested in the concept of improvisational openness. This time it featured some more guttural exhalations from Ms. Chase. And her brooding work on contrabass flute wound up serving as a setup for one booming, climactic pulse from Mr. Sorey, working in this moment as drummer and dramatist both. "
5cb1e2bc49f0eacbf1f83bc8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/13/arts/music/coachella-guava-island-donald-glover.html,"“Guava Island,” a new 55-minute film starring Donald Glover and Rihanna, was released as a limited-time free stream on Amazon overnight Saturday, during Glover’s headlining set as Childish Gambino at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. The mysterious project, which has been teased for months, features Glover as Deni, a singer hoping to bring the mystical island of Guava together with a music festival, while Rihanna plays his girlfriend, Kofi, and provides voice-over during a fairy-tale-like animated introduction about the fictional location and its valuable blue silk. Nonso Anozie (“Game of Thrones”) and Letitia Wright (“Black Panther”) also appear. With a plot involving exploited workers, the struggles of musicians and a society divided between red and blue, the film incorporates themes present in much of Glover’s recent work, from the hit FX series ""Atlanta"" to his viral, Grammy-winning song and video for “This Is America,” which is interpolated in “Guava Island.” [Read the NYT review of “Guava Island.”] The film was written by Glover’s brother Stephen and directed by his longtime collaborator Hiro Murai, who was also behind the camera for much of “Atlanta” and “This Is America.” Following its premiere on the grounds of Coachella on Thursday, and the Childish Gambino show on Friday night, “Guava Island” was made available for anyone to watch on Amazon for 18 hours starting Saturday at 12:01 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time; it will then be available exclusively to Amazon Prime subscribers. Shot in Cuba and inspired by the Brazilian crime epic “City of God” and Prince’s “Purple Rain,” “Guava Island” does not ultimately feature much new music from Childish Gambino — or any singing from Rihanna. The movie opens with a breezy unreleased number from Glover (“If the world ends/I think I wanna die with you”) and has elements of another song with the lyrics, “Maybe the sky will fall down on tomorrow/but one thing’s for certain baby/we’re running out of time.” It also incorporates alternate versions of recent Childish Gambino singles like “Summertime Magic” and “Feels Like Summer,” along with “Saturday,” which Glover debuted on “Saturday Night Live” last year (“God, this 9 to 5 just keep on killing me,” he sings). In one scene set in a factory, another character tells Deni that he hopes to save enough money to make it to America. “It’s different there,” the man says. “I heard people are their own bosses.” Deni responds: “This is America. Guava’s no different than any other country,” adding, “America is a concept. Anywhere where in order to make yourself rich, you have to make someone else richer is America.” He then leads a choreographed dance to the song that mirrors some of the music video. At Coachella on Friday night, Glover — who has thrown his own festival, Pharos — did not make a show of plugging “Guava Island,” though he did incorporate tropical imagery and sounds into his set. For one unreleased song, he cleared a section in the crowd to scream over a cacophonous burst of complex drum rhythms, bathed in almost-apocalyptic red lights. He also performed the still-unreleased track “Human Sacrifice,” which debuted in a Google ad during the Grammy Awards in February. Glover was overcome by emotion onstage while discussing the deaths of his father and the rappers Mac Miller and Nipsey Hussle. “What I’m starting to realize is all we really have is memories at the end of the day,” he told the crowd. “All we are really is like, data — you pass it on to your kids, you pass it on to your friends, your family.” “While we’re here,” Glover added, “feel something and pass it on.” "
5c5480473a125f5075c0796d,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/01/arts/music/layale-chaker-inner-rhyme.html,"As a young violinist growing up in Beirut, Layale Chaker moved between two musical worlds. At the city’s conservatory, she studied Mozart and Ravel with teachers imported from Eastern Europe. She knew there were young people studying Arabic violin in the same school, but the programs were segregated. On her walk home, she was engulfed by the sounds of Lebanese music filtering out of car radios and stores. “From the beginning you chose your path, Western or Arab,” Ms. Chaker, 28, said recently at her apartment in Brooklyn. “I never questioned it.” But questions arose later, as she traveled down the Western classical path, studying in Paris, London and at the prestigious Lucerne Festival Academy, and touring with the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra and Daniel Barenboim. “She was a particularly curious musician,” Mr. Barenboim said in an interview about Ms. Chaker, who would keep a full-orchestra study score at her feet during rehearsals. “That’s why I had this special affection for her.” But, she said, “I always felt like I was leaving a piece of myself behind.” In her final years in Beirut, Ms. Chaker had found an Iraqi violin teacher, Mohammed Abbas Hashim, who pushed her to improvise her own cadenzas to Mozart concertos and jam on traditional Arabic maqam scales as, she recalled, “a way to relax and let off some steam.” She sought out other masters of Arabic and Ottoman court music. In January, Ms. Chaker released “Inner Rhyme,” a haunting yet quietly rigorous album that integrates the disparate parts of her identity as a composer, performer and improviser who tiptoes along cultural fault lines. A recent performance at the Stone in Manhattan showed off the hallmarks of this music, built on the maqam scales of Arabic music, with jazzy flights of improvisation and fleeting echoes of early Baroque ornamentation. The pianist and composer Vijay Iyer witnessed the genesis of “Inner Rhyme” at a workshop he ran in Banff, Alberta. “We rigorously explored the microtones she worked with and tried to square them with a piano,” he said in a phone interview. “It created something that, to my ear, was unprecedented. It was like nothing I’d ever heard on this planet. It was coming out of traditions, but stepping into a real experimental sensibility.” Mr. Iyer introduced Ms. Chaker to some of the stylistically polyglot musicians who joined her in this project. The ensemble’s name, Sarafand, is that of a Palestinian village that became a ghost town after the founding of the state of Israel. Loss and exile are central themes, even if they are distilled into purely instrumental music. Ms. Chaker’s point of departure is poems written by Syrian, Iraqi and Palestinian writers whose political messages are sublimated in metaphors. She took their poetic meters and turned them into the rhythmic skeleton of her music. “On the Trunk of an Olive Tree” is inspired by verses by the Palestinian poet and former Israeli Knesset member Tawfik Ziad, which imagines him carving his history into bark. The violin line sits low in the instrument’s register, evoking a whisper, soft as a flute. Often there seems to be more breath than voice in these wordless poems, though other times Ms. Chaker draws full-bellied sounds, or sketches out silvery arpeggios while the bass or cello take center stage. Her other compositions include works for traditional classical forces, like a ruminative violin concerto and a restless string trio, both inflected with maqam modes. In these pieces she draws on her experience as an orchestral musician in Mr. Barenboim’s West-Eastern Divan. “Anything he said to anyone in the room I wrote down,” she said. “The Divan was really my school for orchestration. It’s interesting to have this experience from the seat in an orchestra — from the birth of sound.” Ms. Chaker said she hopes to counteract stereotypes of Arabic music as traditional and monolithic. “When you say ‘French music’ you think of the avant-garde,” she said. “You’re saying Messiaen or Debussy. It’s not the same with Arabic music. And I would like this to change. Because if a tradition is to survive, it has to come out of its box. To witness a contemporary life and a future, it has to be questioned.” "
5c76e81249f0eacbf105a7e5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/27/arts/music/adia-victoria-silences.html,"Adia Victoria, a 32-year-old songwriter who grew up in rural South Carolina and is based in Nashville, likes to call herself a “modern blues woman.” In her music, the blues is a baseline and a frame of mind, not a genre boundary; it pushes her to take risks. “I want to make the blues dangerous again,” she said in an interview a few days ago, sharing the back seat of a car-service van crawling through rush-hour traffic to visit Eastern Parkway in Brooklyn, where she lived in the early 2000s. Over a black outfit she wore a sleek, vivid red overcoat, a $5 find at Goodwill. “The blues isn’t just a sound,” she said. “I think that’s something that white people have really gone and goofed on, thinking that they’ve pegged down the blues and they can package it. When you do that, then some wily black woman is going to come and subvert you every single time, and here I am. The blues needs to move.” There’s nothing antiquarian or purist about Victoria’s new second album, “Silences.” She produced it with Aaron Dessner, from the majestically pensive indie-rock band the National, and its tracks deploy orchestral arrangements and synthesizers along with bluesy shuffles and a soul horn section. In a show last Friday at Rough Trade NYC in Brooklyn, Victoria’s set included songs from both the foundational Delta bluesman Robert Johnson and the English trip-hop band Portishead. “She’s a very strong conceptual artist and thinker,” Dessner said by telephone from Hudson, N.Y., where he has his studio. “It was less about song forms and melody and harmony and some of the things you usually think about when producing, and more about the story.” Victoria has always been ambitious. On “Silences,” she sings about fear, love, death, salvation, the devil, artistic compromise, a woman’s self-determination, the allure of the city and solitude as a refuge. Her reference points are literary as well as musical. The title of her 2016 debut album, “Beyond the Bloodhounds,” came from an 1861 memoir, “Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl,” by Harriet Jacobs. “Silences” shares its title with a book by Tillie Olsen about women whose creativity was stifled by domestic burdens. In Nashville, she is collaborating with two poets, Caroline Randall Williams and Ciona Rouse, on a book and spoken-word project imagining a blues woman named Rosie. “She’s channeling the ancestors through a very intentionally and carefully crafted filter,” Williams said by phone from Nashville. “She is so rigorous about surrounding herself with art that shakes her and moves her and has an emotional and cultural context, whether she is sitting and reading new wave French poetry or practicing relentlessly — make-up-free and exhausted at the crack of dawn — Mississippi John Hurt scales. All of that is her weaving the mesh of her filter. She’s thinking about what work the blues is meant to do.” Victoria’s music is simultaneously rooted and restless, reflecting a peripatetic life. Adia Victoria Paul — her full name — was raised in a strictly religious Seventh-day Adventist family that imbued her with biblical teachings and thoughts of mortality. She dropped out of high school and started to embark on impulsive journeys. Because she loved the movie “Amélie,” she bought a plane ticket to visit Paris on the day George W. Bush was re-elected in 2004. Back in the United States, she decided to move to Brooklyn because she loved songs by the Strokes. In 2008 she moved to Atlanta, where she started playing guitar and delving into the blues while she made a good living as a cable-service telemarketer. “I learned how to talk to people for the first time,” she said. “That was like my charm school.” She relocated to Nashville, where generations of her family are settled, and briefly enrolled in college. She also started performing at open-mic nights and put together a band. After a gig in 2013, a noted producer, Roger Moutenot, invited her to work in his studio. “I was like, O.K., and the next week I dropped out of college,” she recalled. “That’s how I operate.” In 2014, she released a bluesy single: “Stuck in the South,” a song weighted with personal and regional history. “Don’t know nothin’ bout Southern belles/But I can tell you somethin’ about Southern hell,” she sang. It was a striking statement that she wrote after Trayvon Martin, the unarmed Florida teenager shot in 2012, was killed. “The days following that, I was so sick with grief and rage, and his death changed something for me,” she said. “It made me realize that I wasn’t safe. That kids that come from ‘good wholesome middle-class backgrounds’ aren’t safe. Like you are still a threat, and you’re still in danger and the South will eat you. That’s terrifying, to be young and to grow up in a black body in the South and have to reckon with that.” But the song is first-person, not finger-pointing or preachy. “I’m just witnessing,” she said. “I’m a voice in the void. I don’t want to proselytize to people. That’s not what I’m here for. Because that’s not what the blues did to me. The blues wasn’t, like, ‘Lift yourself up, young Negro.’ The blues meets you where you’re at.” She added: “I don’t believe that there’s any apolitical music. When people say things like, your music is political — all music, all art is political. You’re taking a stance, you’re making an observation about the way the world works or you think it should work. You’re doing that to sway public opinion.” Victoria completed her debut album gradually; it took three years. The record revealed a voice that could be girlish or grizzled, teasing or wrathful. “When I sing, I don’t know what that voice is,” she said. “My sister says I sound like an old lady singing in an attic. I studied videos of Victoria Spivey performing on YouTube and I love the way that she sings with her eyes. But I think that the voice is just this young woman inside of me that’s just this creepy little woman with huge eyes who’s watching the world. And it’s her chance to speak through me.” Atlantic Records released “Beyond the Bloodhounds” in 2016 and Victoria toured internationally, to the point of exhaustion. “I came home and I had no inner life left,” she said. “I had given it all away. I bottomed out in Nashville. I think that it was probably one of the darkest times of my life.” But she had an idea about a sound she wanted. When she talked with Dessner in 2017 about producing her second album, she said, “‘I wonder what it would sound like if Billie Holiday got lost in a Radiohead song?’ And he was, just, ‘We’re going to find out.’” She said she’s inspired by how Radiohead uses sonic techniques to tell a story. The goal was to blend those elements into the blues. “Nothing was out of bounds.” The songs on “Silences” stay mercurial, alluding to old styles only to have them melt down and mutate into something stranger. “There was a heavy focus in Adia’s mind on improvisation and allowing space for weird experiments and futuristic alchemy to happen,” Dessner said. “She tends to have a real subversive approach. She’s not really seeking for something to be perfect or beautiful. She’s focused on an aesthetic goal that’s more transgressive and forward-thinking. I was encouraged to pursue ugly tones and more jagged things at times.” In the studio, Victoria put up pictures of women who had inspired her: Holiday, Nina Simone, Fiona Apple, the Ethiopian pianist Emahoy Tsegué-Maryam Guèbrou. She also kept with her a book by the Surrealist poet Joyce Mansour. “She’ll start a line in a certain way, and by the end of the line she’s taking you in a completely different, unexpected direction,” she said. “I wanted to bring that into my music. I never want you to know how I’m going to finish a phrase. I always want to remain aloof, dangerous, unsettling, disorienting.” She smiled. “In a groovy way.” "
5c9ccde649f0eacbf105f878,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/28/arts/music/billie-eilish-debut-album.html,"LOS ANGELES — Even before she turned 17 in December, the singer Billie Eilish had accomplished nearly all of the modern prerequisites for pop stardom and then some: Her homemade songs, written only with her older brother, had been streamed more than a billion times on digital platforms; she’d played increasingly large sold-out concerts to delirious fans (and their patient parents); appeared with Ellen DeGeneres and Jimmy Fallon; and collected some 15 million followers on Instagram. Among those legions, many had already started to adopt the musician’s striking visual aesthetic: performatively dead eyes (bored, at best), hair dyed in shades of electric blue and pale purple, an all-baggy anti-silhouette — a collective middle finger to the strictures of teen-pop sex appeal. While still drawing befuddled stares from those outside of her demographic, Eilish’s mere presence has been known to get a certain subset of teenager hyperventilating — and spending hundreds of dollars on merchandise Eilish designed herself. What the musician didn’t have along the way — and, to her credit, didn’t need — was the lightning strike of a memeable moment or a megahit, the most surefire ways to get noticed (and, potentially, soon forgotten) in today’s avalanche of content. In fact, only now, three years after the music industry caught a whiff of Eilish’s extremely fresh blood, was she even getting around to releasing her debut album. [“When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?” redefines teen-pop stardom. Read the NYT review.] “When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?,” out Friday via Darkroom/Interscope, marks the latest apex in Eilish’s fairy tale career, and it’s likely to cement her growing reputation as a 21st century music business unicorn who embodies all the creative and commercial promise of online youth culture. It might also make her a household name. To speak to her business team and label bosses is to hear the phrase “the biggest artist in the world” repeatedly, and in earnest, as a near-term goal. Dave Grohl, whose daughters are obsessed with Eilish, could only compare her to his old band: “The same thing is happening with her that happened with Nirvana in 1991,” he told a music business conference recently, holding up Eilish’s tough-to-categorize music as proof that “rock ’n’ roll is not even close to being dead.” The hip-hop producer Timbaland called this year, and next, hers for the taking. “I do not see a ceiling,” said Brandon Goodman, one of Eilish’s managers. No pressure. “I can’t even tell you how anxious I’ve been to get this album out,” Eilish said in her parents’ tiny kitchen earlier this month. Self-possessed but entirely a teenager, with one ASAP Rocky shoe propped on the table and gothic rings on every finger, Eilish talks like an Instagram caption come to life — everything is “fire” or “trash,” bro, and she is always “deadass.” Her look is Hot Topic by way of hypebeast; in photos, a smile is rare, though searing eye contact from her ice-blue alien saucers is common. Ahead of her album, Eilish was taking stock of her atypical adolescence, and acknowledging the fact that for all of the attention she’d garnered thus far, her ride into the mainstream was about to kick into a new gear. “For a minute, I could go somewhere nobody knew who I was — maybe at Costco or something,” she said. “I would go places and try to convince myself I wasn’t faaamous or whatever.” But the last bits of her anonymity have been fading; the day prior, she’d been recognized four times while walking two blocks home, forcing her to come to terms with a fast-approaching reality. “There’s no other choice for me,” she said. “I literally have to.” What Eilish and her cadre of surrounding adults hope will differentiate her from decades-worth of precocious, fast-burning teen stars before her is twofold: autonomy and familial support. [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] Building on the paths cut not just by Lorde, Lana Del Rey and Halsey, but Brockhampton, Odd Future and the Weeknd, Eilish is an artist-as-creative director, building her own layered universe for fans to obsess over through a unified flow of music, videos, social media and staging. Musically, she combines most of the internet-first ideas of this century — EDM drops, sad-girl bedroom confessions, SoundCloud rap abandon — into an edgy, genre-agnostic (but playlist-friendly) fusion that sounds like pop and streams like hip-hop. (Instead of one runaway single, Eilish has eight different songs with more than 140 million plays on Spotify.) She insists on near-complete control. “I could easily just be like, you know what, you’re going to pick out my clothes, someone else will come up with my video treatments, someone else will direct them and I won’t have anything to do with them,” Eilish said. “Someone else write my music, someone else produce it, and I won’t say anything about it. Someone else run my Instagram.” “Everything could be easier if I wanted it to,” she continued. “But I’m not that kind of person and I’m not that kind of artist. And I’d rather die than be that kind of artist.” Billie Eilish is also, in many ways, a family business. The songs are written and produced by Eilish and her 21-year-old brother, Finneas, who often opens for her and plays as her backing band. The pair record almost exclusively in their comfortably cluttered childhood bedrooms, never far from their parents, Maggie Baird and Patrick O’Connell, long-toiling actors who pieced together bit parts, regional theater and voice-over work. These days, Baird tours as Eilish’s assistant, but is really more like her chief of staff, all mom and part manager (but without the commission). O’Connell, who also did handiwork and carpentry, is now part of the tour crew, and has gone from driving the van in the leaner days to lighting director. Yet somehow, the cloud of stage-parent oppression seems absent, which isn’t to say that this Partridge Family for the Instagram age wasn’t partially by design. The children were home-schooled, O’Connell said, in part because Finneas was born the same year as the smash hit “MMMBop” by Hanson, a trio of brothers. “I was completely swept away by these kids,” O’Connell recalled. “They were religious Oklahoma home-schooled, but nonetheless. Clearly what had happened was they’d been allowed to pursue the things that they were interested in.” Though not much of a musician herself, Baird eventually taught both children in a beginner’s songwriting class, using touchstones like the Beatles, and the kids were generally encouraged to follow their passions; college was never the goal. (They were also raised vegetarian and slept in a four-person family bed until Finneas was about 10; more recently, the parents took the living room of their two-bedroom, one-bath nest.) Eilish was initially drawn to dance, horseback riding and singing in the Los Angeles Children’s Chorus. But she was primarily a D.I.Y. aesthete, building costumes and crafts from scratch and rallying friends for her elaborate projects. “I was unbelievably bossy,” Eilish said. (Her lifelong friend Zoe Donahoe chimed in from nearby: “She just knew what she wanted.”) Finneas committed to music first, but when he enlisted a 13-year-old Eilish to sing “Ocean Eyes,” a song he’d written for his band, the family’s lives were forever altered. The siblings uploaded the track to SoundCloud for Eilish’s dance teacher to choreograph to, but it took off, fueled by unofficial remixes and algorithm magic, drumming up industry intrigue. By the summer of 2016, Eilish had signed to Darkroom, a marketing company-turned-boutique label run by 28-year-old Justin Lubliner, in partnership with Interscope Records. John Janick, the chief executive of Interscope, recalled of Eilish: “Her sense of style, how she thinks, the way she talks — everything about her was just different. She had such a strong point of view, especially for being 14 years old.” Lubliner envisioned her as “a new breed of pop star,” and was unconcerned with competition from more traditional singers like Selena Gomez and Camila Cabello. Instead of pushing “Ocean Eyes,” which goes down easy as vaguely R&B indie-pop, to Top 40 radio, Eilish’s team vowed to move slower and more deliberately. “We didn’t want it to be about a song,” said Goodman, who with Danny Rukasin manages Eilish and Finneas. “We never wanted anything to be bigger than Billie the artist.” The label released a nine-track EP, “Don’t Smile at Me,” the next summer, in addition to a steady stream of one-off songs, and watched as each grew exponentially. Although rappers frequently break online, leaving radio to catch up (or not), the holistic, streaming-first path was largely unprecedented for an aspiring pop heavyweight at the time. “For the past two years, people have been like, ‘Whoa, this came out of nowhere overnight!’” said Goodman. Along the way, Eilish has developed into a much stranger, more unique artist than initially promised. Though her voice is pure, her lyrical themes are angsty and bleak — serial killers, domination, monsters under the bed — and on her new album, she favors wobbly beats, jarring turns and creepy sound effects, which flow seamlessly with her visual aesthetic on social media and in her videos. Veering sharply into abject, “American Horror Story” aesthetics, Eilish has bled jet-black liquid from her eye sockets, let a tarantula crawl across her face, and been manhandled and stabbed with needles by disembodied hands, invoking shock artists like Nine Inch Nails and Marilyn Manson more than Taylor Swift or Katy Perry. Crucially, Eilish has also absorbed an at times cartoonish, outlaw essence from the world of rap — without actually trying to rap. Eilish cites Tyler, the Creator, Childish Gambino and the influencer Bloody Osiris as her guiding lights of self-presentation, and her music incorporates now-ubiquitous elements of trap production without feeling forced. “Everyone needs to give hip-hop credit — everyone in the world right now,” Eilish said. “Whatever you’re doing, you’ve been influenced by hip-hop.” Still, she’s a well-adjusted teenager and her core audience remains young women, offering them an original vantage on the rebellions du jour. “Xanny,” a standout from Eilish’s new album, takes on the SoundCloud generation’s dependency of choice — benzos and opioids — with concern and scorn: “I don’t need a xanny to feel better,” she sings. “Don’t give me a xanny now or ever.” She was matter-of-fact about already being a role model. “I completely recognize the responsibility, and I do think about it,” Eilish said. “But it’s not going to change the way that I am.” So far, she has largely managed to avoid the trapdoors of internet controversy that often accompany viral notoriety — something Eilish said she has had nightmares about. But with the increasing heat of fame comes more micro-scrutiny, as Eilish got a taste of recently with the release of the song “Wish You Were Gay.” (Lyrics: “To give your lack of interest an explanation/don’t say I’m not your type/just say that I’m not your preferred sexual orientation.”) “I really tried hard, dude,” she said, responding to the small-scale backlash. “I thought it was so clear that it wasn’t meant as an insult. But I understand it’s a sensitive word for people.” She bristled more at mention of her friendship with the young rapper XXXTentacion, who was murdered last year but previously drew condemnation for allegations of domestic abuse. In the kitchen at home, her mother called, half-jokingly, for Eilish’s publicist in the other room. “I want to be able to mourn, I don’t want to be shamed for it,” said Eilish, who performed a tribute song following XXXTentacion’s death. “I don’t think I deserve getting hate for loving someone that passed.” No one chimed in to coach her. Flanked at all times by her family, Eilish felt sturdy, if a bit jaded, in anticipation of the ways her life would continue to change in the coming months — harder questions, greater expectations, less privacy. Earlier, her brother had described the surreality of Eilish’s rise as “an autonomous thing, and it’s moving forward really fast, and we’re all on it.” Her father chimed in: “It’s a train, or a river, or a vortex, and we’re all flying down.” Finneas added: “But traveling it safely feels much easier than trying to bail out.” Eilish agreed, and said she was working on being in the moment while also keeping perspective, motivated especially by the promise of larger and larger concerts, which have become near-religious experiences for her fans. She flicked nervously at a lighter, singeing a cactus on the table in front of her. “I’m realizing the place I’m in right now is kind of my time, though — my moment,” she said. “These are the good old days.” "
5c9bb20049f0eacbf105f59d,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/27/arts/music/marie-ulven-girl-in-red.html,"OSLO — One evening in December, Marie Ulven was riding a tram through Oslo, remarking on just how unremarkable she hoped her music might someday be. “We need queer art to make it normal,” she said. “We need protagonists who are just, like, living their best life and gay — that’s just part of their character.” For the last couple of years, Ulven, 20, has made spiky, emotionally tactile indie-pop songs about the panting urgency of new love, and the sharp pain of when it’s unachievable, under the name girl in red. In short order, she’s emerged as one of the most astute and exciting singer-songwriters working in the world of guitar music, with a laserlike melodic instinct that verges on the primal and lyrics that capture the sweat of real life. “Some people are just like ‘How did you dare to do this?’” Ulven said of the fact that she’s singing about women. “And it’s like, I’m just out here being a [expletive] normal human being, falling in love and writing a song about it, just like that other straight girl writing a song about love.” In the last year, girl in red’s music has bubbled up from sporadic uploads on SoundCloud and Bandcamp into a growing phenomenon; Ulven has more than a million monthly listeners on Spotify despite having only 10 songs posted there. She’s opened for the bedroom electro-pop singer Clairo in Europe and is currently on her first American tour, warming up crowds for Conan Gray, a 20-year-old esoteric pop singer who has over a million subscribers on YouTube and is signed to Republic, a division of Universal. (They play this week in New York, at Bowery Ballroom on Wednesday and Music Hall of Williamsburg on Thursday.) On May 14, she’ll return as a headliner for a sold-out show at Baby’s All Right. In part, she said, that rapid success has been aided by a more welcoming pop music climate for gay artists, a radical shift in recent years that has seen the ascent of mainstream stars like Sam Smith, longtime gay performers like Tegan and Sara, and rising artists like Troye Sivan, Hayley Kiyoko and King Princess, among many others. (“#20gayteen is real,” Ulven said, referring to Kiyoko’s term for last year’s cultural moment.) But also, Ulven’s songs are sinisterly effective, with echoes of the D.I.Y. punk of the last few years, crisp Scandinavian pop and dry early 1990s shoegaze. “I Wanna Be Your Girlfriend” pulses with desperation: “I don’t wanna be your friend, I wanna kiss your lips/I wanna kiss you ’til I lose my breath.” “Girls” and “Watch You Sleep” are ethereally sweet, and “Say Anything” posits her as a romantic antihero: “You’ll be the good girl/I’ll be the guy to change your mind.” Growing up about 50 miles south of Oslo, in Horten, where her father was a police officer and her mother worked in technology, Ulven, who’s naturally boisterous and exuberant, “suppressed my feelings for a really long time,” she said. “I used to have dreams about girls, wake up and be super guilty.” Moreover, she didn’t see herself reflected in the art of the time: “I didn’t have a me back then.” “The dream scenario is that you don’t have to come out and that coming out, that’s just an outdated word,” she said. “The fact that we still say that we have to come out of something means that we can’t live as something from Day 1, just like a straight person.” Last summer, she relocated from Horten to Oslo, moving in with her sister in a fourth-floor walk-up in the artsy Grunerlokka district and attending Westerdals, a college where she studied music production and songwriting. But her career soon outpaced her schoolwork. In December, she’d just completed her first semester (with a paper on the era-defining Swedish songwriter and producer Max Martin) and was spending a day perusing thrift stores — “I don’t know why but I always like grandpa stuff” — and upgrading her personal technology. At the cellphone store, she was recognized by the salesman, who’d seen her perform on Norwegian television when she won Urort, a national juried music competition. (Though when Ulven first made music, it was in Norwegian, she now sings in English.) Throughout 2018 and the early part of this year, Ulven released a handful of songs on her own, without a label. She eventually gathered the best of them on an EP, “Chapter 1,” and she expects to do something similar, a “Chapter 2,” this year before committing to a full-length album. “Let’s see what girl in red is,” she said. “Let’s see what we have here.” Indeed, the project is evolving in real time. Her earliest songs were punchy and urgent, but some more recent ones, like “Watch You Sleep,” have an elegiac, dreamlike quality. She produces her own songs, and films and edits her own videos, and recently bought herself both a cello and an OP-1 synthesizer/sampler, which she’s planning on teaching herself to play. At times, her songs change midway — she arrived at the melody for “Girls” while working on a different song, about an accident her father suffered a few years ago: “Someone I love died today/When he came back home he was not the same.” But a bright melody kept forcing its way to the front, and Ulven grabbed it and remade it as a proud anthem for loudly claiming who you love. It’s that directness that has earned her particularly fervent fans, many of whom are looking to Ulven for guidance and understanding. The night before the interview, she’d spent an hour or so on Instagram Live, eating guacamole and talking with several fans: “I appreciate you appreciating me appreciating you guys!” Their reactions ranged from ecstatic cool to speechless awe. Ulven is in several group chats with her fans, with names like “Girls in Red” and “Your Children” — she pops in frequently, encouraging them but also answering silly questions. “I can’t help everyone come out — I’m not some gay sensei who can help everyone out,” she said. “But, to an extent, I feel like some of them are my responsibility.” Being direct about her feelings in her songs has been crucial for her but also sets an example that Ulven herself didn’t have when she was younger. “Even though I can’t be there for everyone as, like, a shrink,” she said, “the music can be.” "
5c69bde43a125f5075c0a2cc,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/17/arts/music/review-concertgebouw-daniel-harding.html,"One way to test a relationship is to travel together. There’s nothing like a change of environment and the odd sudden surprise for revealing the structural flaws in a partnership, or knitting it closer together. When the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra and the conductor Daniel Harding took the stage at Carnegie Hall on Thursday and Friday the maestro and the musicians, touring together, may been wondering: Is this working for me? The Concertgebouw is one of the great orchestras in the world, and used to being wooed by stars. (As if to make the point, Friday’s program included Strauss’s “Ein Heldenleben,” which the composer dedicated to the players of this Dutch orchestra in 1898.) Since its chief conductor, Daniele Gatti, was fired last summer over allegations of sexual impropriety (he denied the accusations), the orchestra has been searching for a new leader.  When it tapped Mr. Harding, 43, an English conductor now mostly butterflying from one prestigious guest gig to another, to lead its American tour, many wondered if this was a first step toward something more lasting. Last week’s performances showed that while the partnership is still far from symbiotic, it can, at its best, make thrilling music. The jitters were mostly felt during Thursday’s program, which included Schumann’s “Manfred” overture, Mozart’s Symphony No. 40 and Brahms’s Fourth. On Friday things came together gloriously in Beethoven’s “Emperor” Concerto with the pianist Pierre-Laurent Aimard, “Heldenleben,” and a new work by Guillaume Connesson. With its well-worn staples, Thursday’s program looked safe on paper. But the orchestra injected it with a dose of unpredictability by inviting members of the National Youth Orchestra of the United States of America to join its ranks. This is part of an initiative the orchestra has developed at home and in European Union’ countries to give young musicians the experience of playing alongside first-rate professionals. It was a lovely gesture to extend on tour, even if it introduced the occasional unevenness into the Schumann. The shakiness of the Mozart was harder to explain. The pops of dynamic contrast in the first movement came across as shrill rather than exuberant and the long arc of the andante’s melody seemed pieced together out of Lego blocks with the seams all too visible. But Mr. Harding led an exciting reading of Brahms’s Symphony No. 4. The opening movement grows out of small motifs, in a way that can sound labored. Mr. Harding’s opening gesture was so expansive that the first sigh in the strings appeared to complete, or perhaps answer, a thought. This was the opening to a burnished performance built on long narrative arcs and juicy color. Brahms’s music proved a perfect vehicle for this orchestra with its plush strings, warm and rounded brass sound and, especially, its impressive horn section. The concluding passacaglia brilliantly tied together the moments of archaic severity and private expression, with a memorable flute solo of deep, increasingly desperate, sadness. “Eirene” is a 10-minute orchestral meditation on the Greek goddess of peace by Connesson, a stylistically omnivorous composer with a knack for scintillating textures. With its impressionistic opening giving way to sweeping melodies, the work has an appealing throwback glamour with touches of Mahlerian Weltschmerz and just a hint of jazzy swing. It was a peaceful opening to a concert centered around celebrations of the heroic, including — in Strauss’s tone poem — a saber-rattling depiction of battle that the Concertgebouw players delivered with ferocious energy. But Mr. Harding and Mr. Aimard, the splendid soloist in the Beethoven concerto, also showed that a certain amount of restraint can lend deeper dignity to valor. Their tempo in the first movement of the Emperor Concerto was sufficiently held back to lend the music a processional majesty. Dynamics were carefully balanced, with a glassy delicacy to the music-box passages and an almost tropical richness to the jubilant fanfares. There was more dazzle to come in the Strauss, and plenty of moments in which individual players and sections took the spotlight. One of the orchestra’s concertmasters, Liviu Prunaru, showed off a magnificently full-bodied sound in his solos. Mr. Harding conducted elegantly, with intelligence and purpose. Even so, I couldn’t help noticing that the musicians’ eyes were often elsewhere. String players often glance at each other, or keep their eyes focused on the concertmaster’s bow. Part of what makes this orchestra play so well is that its members approach the music like chamber musicians. which means that much of the time they don’t look at the conductor at all. "

The annual experimental-music festival announced on Monday that it will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the trailblazing label ECM Records with 20 separate performances across its four days. This is set to be the largest single convocation of ECM-related artists in the United States. Like the rest of Big Ears, these shows will take place March 21-24 at a variety of venues throughout downtown Knoxville, Tenn. Since 1969, ECM has been devoted to publishing music at the crossroads of contemporary Western classical, jazz and experimental music. This puts it roughly in line with the programmatic mission of Big Ears. ECM’s founder and director, Manfred Eicher, will be on hand at the festival, although he has not yet announced plans to participate in any official events. ECM-affiliated performers at the festival will include the drummer Jack DeJohnette; the violist Kim Kashkashian; the pianists Vijay Iyer and Craig Taborn, performing in duet; and the Art Ensemble of Chicago, a group that has lived at the cusp of experimental improvised music since before ECM was founded.

5c706a113a125f5075c0b17e,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/22/obituaries/fred-foster-dead.html,"NASHVILLE — Fred Foster, the record producer and song publisher who championed the emerging careers of Roy Orbison, Kris Kristofferson and Dolly Parton, died here on Feb. 20. He was 87. His publicist, Martha Moore, said the cause was complications of a stroke. Mr. Foster’s most enduring early success came as the producer of Roy Orbison’s No. 1 singles “Running Scared” and “Oh, Pretty Woman” in the early 1960s. Along with the likes of “Crying” and “Only the Lonely (Know How I Feel),” all of Mr. Orbison’s hits from this period were issued by Monument Records, the label Mr. Foster established in Washington in 1958 (it took its name from the Washington Monument) and moved to Nashville two years later. Before Mr. Foster became involved with his career, Mr. Orbison had released only two minor singles on Sun Records, neither one a big hit. Mr. Foster also provided a boost to the fortunes of the 19-year-old Ms. Parton, whom he signed to Monument in 1965. She recorded her first two Top 40 country hits, “Dumb Blonde” and “Something Fishy,” for the label before going on to become a star on “The Porter Wagoner Show” on television and with RCA Records. “You saw things in me that nobody else did,” Ms. Parton said, referring to Mr. Foster’s willingness to take a chance on her, at the 2016 ceremony at which he was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. “Sometimes you just know — sometimes,” Mr. Foster explained, alluding to his instincts about Ms. Parton in a comment published by the Hall of Fame. “And that makes up for all the times you had to guess.” Maybe even more prescient than his patronage of Mr. Orbison and Ms. Parton was Mr. Foster’s signing of Kris Kristofferson to a songwriting contract with Combine Music, his fledgling publishing company, and later — despite Mr. Kristofferson’s commercially questionable singing voice — to Monument as a recording artist. Mr. Kristofferson’s 1973 single “Why Me” was his only recording for the label to reach the pop Top 40, but “Me and Bobby McGee,” on which he and Mr. Foster share the writing credit, became a posthumous No.1 pop hit for Janis Joplin in 1971. Combine also published Mr. Kristofferson’s “Sunday Morning Coming Down” and “Help Me Make It Through the Night,” a pair of mystical, existential ballads that became enduring crossover hits, “Sunday Morning” for Johnny Cash and “Help Me” for Sammi Smith. They were subsequently recorded by scores of others. Tony Joe White’s compositions “Polk Salad Annie,” a Top 10 hit for him, and “Rainy Night in Georgia,” a Top 10 hit for the soul singer Brook Benton, were also Combine titles, as was the Elvis Presley hit “Burning Love,” written by Dennis Linde. Fred Luther Foster, the youngest of eight children, was born on July 26, 1931, on a farm in Rutherford County, N.C. His father, Vance Hampton Foster, raised cotton and sorghum and played the harmonica. His mother, Clara Marcella (Weaste) Foster, was a homemaker. Enthralled by music at a young age, Mr. Foster moved to Washington when he was 18 to pursue a career in the record business. He worked in various capacities there, including as the supervisor of the country singer Jimmy Dean’s first recording session, which yielded the Top 10 country single “Bumming Around.” Mr. Foster worked as a talent scout for Mercury Records. He later recalled that he had urged his superiors there to bid aggressively for the talents of Elvis Presley, then largely unknown. But his effort was to no avail: Presley signed a contract with RCA instead. In 1963, Mr. Foster established Sound Stage 7, an R&B-oriented subsidiary of Monument. The soul singer Joe Simon’s 1969 recording of “The Chokin’ Kind” for the label became a million-selling pop and R&B hit. Monument also released several influential instrumental recordings in the 1960s, including the saxophonist Boots Randolph’s “Yakety Sax,” a Top 40 pop hit in 1963. Another recorded version of the song served as the opening theme for the long-running British comedy series “The Benny Hill Show.” Mr. Foster is survived by his son, Vance; his daughters, Micki Koenig, Leah Alderman, Brit Rothstein and Kristen Foster; and four grandchildren. Mr. Foster sold Monument and Combine in the 1980s but continued to work as a producer, most notably on “Last of the Breed,” a 2007 album that teamed Willie Nelson, Merle Haggard and Ray Price. The project earned Mr. Price and Mr. Nelson a Grammy Award for best country collaboration with vocals for their performance of the Hank Williams staple “Lost Highway.” In 2016, the Recording Academy presented Mr. Foster with a Trustees Award for lifetime achievement. “I tried to do something time would not be critical of,” Mr. Foster said that year in an interview with The Tennessean, reflecting on his contributions to the music industry. “It’s like Orbison said to me one time, ‘What’s the most important thing we’re going to do?’ I said, ‘We’re going to eliminate every gimmick you come up with. They don’t endure.’ ” "
5c800d2a49f0eacbf105ba93,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/06/arts/music/john-adams-thomas-ades-piano.html,"After 250 years or so, the piano concerto has some life in it yet. This week alone, two piano concertos by two eminent composers, Thomas Adès and John Adams, will have their premieres on the same evening. They follow close on the heels of another, by the Pulitzer Prize-winner Caroline Shaw, presented by the Seattle Symphony earlier this year. On the East Coast, Mr. Adès will conduct the Boston Symphony Orchestra in his unambiguously titled Concerto for Piano and Orchestra, featuring Kirill Gerstein. On the other side of the country, the Los Angeles Philharmonic, under Gustavo Dudamel, will play Mr. Adams’s “Must the Devil Have All the Good Tunes?” with Yuja Wang. (No need to despair if you’re not in Boston or Los Angeles: Mr. Adès’s work travels to Carnegie Hall on March 20, and “Must the Devil” comes to Lincoln Center this fall, with a long list of future performances planned around the world through at least 2020.) In their own postmodern ways, these concertos acknowledge the genre’s long and wide-ranging history, while also searching for what else it is capable of. Here are previews of both. If this piece has a predecessor, it’s Mr. Adès’s “In Seven Days” (2008), a work that moves fluidly between concerto and tone poem. Mr. Gerstein was performing it with the Boston Symphony in 2012 when he gathered the courage to ask the composer to write something for him. “I remember saying that I knew I had to stand in line for a while,” Mr. Gerstein said. “And Tom charmingly said, ‘Does it have to be a solo piece?’” (Mr. Gerstein later learned from Mr. Adès’s publisher that he had “skipped the line,” by a lot.) Mr. Adès, 48, wanted to write, he recalled, “a proper piano concerto.” And in Mr. Gerstein he found a muse to explore the form’s tradition and the idea of virtuosity itself. The two met in the mid-2000s while performing Stravinsky’s “Les Noces,” and have since become friends with the kind of mutual admiration that leads to new music: Mr. Adès arranged a Berceuse from his opera “The Exterminating Angel” for Mr. Gerstein, who gave its premiere last month in Vienna. They’ve also embarked on a two-piano recital tour that will stop at Zankel Hall in New York on March 13. Mr. Adès’s nod to tradition begins with the title of the piece — unadorned and unpoetic. And, like nearly every concerto throughout history, it is in three movements, opening with the statement of a theme from both the piano and the orchestra. But there is always a twist with Mr. Adès. He revels in homage and quotation — just listen to his delightful Belle Époque pastiche score for the film “Colette” — and here he finds ways to adhere to convention while at the same time breaking free with surprising melodies and dizzying demands on the pianist. “I’ve really asked this piece what it wanted to do,” Mr. Adès said. “What it wanted to do was speak along traditional lines, the way a tree is a traditional form: It will always have a trunk. But I suppose part of me feels that the most freshness can be found in revisiting the tradition.” While preparing for the premiere, Mr. Gerstein — who with this week’s performances is reuniting with the Boston Symphony after recording Busoni’s colossal Piano Concerto in C with the orchestra — has often checked in with Mr. Adès, sending cellphone videos and asking interpretive questions in text messages. “I feel like I don’t have any anxiety,” Mr. Adès said. “Kirill seems to absorb it, and it speaks through him. It’s nice not to have any worry.” “I can’t play the piano,” Mr. Adams, 72, confessed in an interview. “I have never even taken a piano lesson.” That hasn’t stopped him from writing some of the most spellbinding contemporary music for the instrument, like “Phrygian Gates” or the joyous and sweeping “Grand Pianola Music”; or the duet “Hallelujah Junction,” which was inspired by the name of a truck stop and was a case, he has often said, of a title looking for a piece. His new concerto has a similar origin story. While working on his oratorio “The Gospel According to the Other Mary,” he said, he came across an old New Yorker article that included a phrase begging to be a title: “Must the Devil Have All the Good Tunes?” Mr. Adams hoped the quote came from Chuck Berry, but found out later it was Martin Luther’s. The words also suggested, Mr. Adams said, the Totentanz, or danse macabre. You can hear a similarity between Liszt’s “Totentanz” and “Must the Devil”: Both pieces begin with a low and lumbering piano part over the orchestra. But whereas Liszt opens with a Dies Irae melody, Mr. Adams aims for something funky and distinctly American. (The orchestration calls for a honky-tonk piano and a bass guitar.) What follows is a concerto that more or less adheres to fast-slow-fast convention but within a sui generis, single-movement form (as opposed to three, like the Adès) — similar to the way Mr. Adams has written symphony-length works without identifying them as such, like “Harmonielehre” and “Naïve and Sentimental Music.” “We live in a time when there are no templates,” he said. “Mozart was a genius but he didn’t have to find a new template for each piece. Each of us, when we write a new piece now, whether it’s a 22-year-old composer or someone my age, we have to decide its form.” The piano part, though it will be played by other soloists including Jeremy Denk and Vikingur Olafsson in the future, was written specifically for Ms. Wang — a superstar who delivers blurry-handed dazzle in showy standards but nuanced readings in more quietly demanding works, like Robert Schumann’s Piano Concerto in A minor. “She’s in there a lot,” Mr. Adams said of “Must the Devil.” He recalled being impressed by a video of Ms. Wang playing Prokofiev with the conductor Claudio Abbado, but found “real depth” in a recording of Rachmaninoff’s Études-Tableaux. “I thought: There’s something there besides the flash.” "

This star pianist has built her reputation on breathtaking mastery of the standard repertory, like the chamber works she played last Wednesday with the violinist Leonidas Kavakos at Carnegie Hall. Or Robert Schumann’s Piano Concerto, which she’ll do with the Boston Symphony Orchestra later this week. But in between those two dates, she stopped by Carnegie’s Zankel Hall on Monday for something entirely different: a comedy show. One with music, of course. And, as always, she was radiant in Rachmaninoff and Lutoslawski. But there was — more. She rapped! She sang and danced through a “West Side Story” medley! She did one-legged, upside-down yoga on a piano bench! And along the way, she never lost an ounce of virtuosity. As part of Ms. Wang’s season-long Perspectives series at Carnegie, she was appearing with the musical comedy duo Igudesman & Joo — Aleksey Igudesman, violin, and Hyung-ki Joo, piano — in a program called “The Clone,” an evening-length version of a sketch they posted on YouTube in 2017. Their approach to performance taps into a joy and curiosity often left behind in music school, which is where Mr. Igudesman and Mr. Joo met as youngsters in Britain. What student hasn’t gone off book for the sake of a joke, to parody someone else’s mannerisms or change the key of a well-known piece for comedic effect? The more skilled you are, the better the results. There is no skill lacking in Igudesman & Joo’s act: They have training fit for the concerto circuit, though, in the tradition of P.D.Q. Bach, they have never surrendered the fun of exploiting the comedy in classical music. An entire bit at Zankel consisted of transposing Mozart’s “Rondo alla Turca” from A minor to A major. There’s a bit of subtle music theory education there, but the punch line was in the unexpected change of character brought on by the different key. They then went even further, adding B flats for a tinge of klezmer. Later, they seamlessly blended Gloria Gaynor’s “I Will Survive” with Mozart, early opera and hip-hop. In “The Clone,” however, those moments of playfulness and discovery were buried in jokes that quickly became uncomfortable, even offensive. The sketch’s conceit is a demonstration of all the capabilities of a hypothetical Yuja Wang clone. (Or robot? It’s never really clear.) She arrives in a large box that they say “smells of sweet and sour chicken.” The duo goes on to mock the Chinese language, and when the clone malfunctions, they laugh it off with a shrug: “Made in China!” Even more difficult to take was the implication that these two men had mail-ordered a woman who obeys their every command and casually accepts their frequent remarks about her sexuality. At one point, Mr. Joo turned to the audience and said, “God, she’s so hot.” Among the cheapest jokes was “How do you turn her on?” followed by “I can think of a couple of ways.” And in the opening, when Mr. Joo came out onstage dressed as her, he said, “I know I’m not Yuja Wang, but some girlfriends do call me Huge-a Wang.” It’s a shame. Because when the evening hewed more closely to truly musical comedy, it showed just how funny virtuosity — especially that of the multitalented Ms. Wang — can be. "
5c66f5133a125f5075c09f39,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/15/arts/music/aaron-diehl-gershwin-los-angeles-philharmonic.html,"At the Juilliard School, the pianist Aaron Diehl studied both classical and jazz traditions. And in the years since, he’s chosen to follow each of those paths — and sometimes both, simultaneously. Mr. Diehl has played with Cécile McLorin Salvant and Wynton Marsalis. His own recordings as a bandleader have revealed him to be not only a stylish improviser, but also a composer worth watching. In recent years, he has revived the practice of interpreting Gershwin’s concert music through an improvisatory filter. His imaginative yet idiomatic turn in the Concerto in F with the New York Philharmonic at their opening-night gala in 2016 contained the hardest-swinging note I’ve ever heard inside David Geffen Hall. (It was an interpolated low D that Mr. Diehl tossed off with casually elegant force toward the end of the first movement.) This weekend, Mr. Diehl plays “Rhapsody in Blue” (on Saturday) and the less familiar “Second Rhapsody” (on Sunday) with the Los Angeles Philharmonic as part of the brief but potent series “William Grant Still and the Harlem Renaissance.” “The challenge is creating this balance between the improvisation and the written score,” Mr. Diehl said of his approach to “Rhapsody in Blue.” Gershwin, in a way, is the exception this weekend: The rest of the Philharmonic’s programming puts the spotlight on black composers. William Grant Still’s symphonies serve as anchors of the programs, the First on Saturday and the Fourth on Sunday. Symphonic arrangements of works by Duke Ellington also appear all weekend, and a new piece — Adolphus Hailstork’s “Still Holding On” — will have its premiere on Sunday. (It’s one of the 50-plus commissions the orchestra has made as part of its centennial season.) An earlier orchestral miniature by Mr. Hailstork, “Celebration,” was captured in the 1970s for Columbia Records’s Black Composers Series, a set which was recently remastered and reissued. That recording was the conductor Thomas Wilkins’s introduction to Mr. Hailstork’s music. “I’ve always found him to be a great craftsman,” said Mr. Wilkins, who will be conducting the Los Angeles concerts. “You hear his upbringing in his music; you hear his culture in his music. But it’s not on the sleeve.” “It’s quite tonal,” he added, “but it’s not without chromaticism. And some of the time, because he’s sort of hinting at a blues lick or a jazz gesture, we find notes that are bent or twisted. Or a jazz harmony all of a sudden.” (Two other pieces by Mr. Hailstork will be performed by the Harlem Chamber Players on Feb. 28 at the New York Public Library’s Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture.) Mr. Wilkins said that he and the Philharmonic wanted to acknowledge Still’s earlier and better-known First Symphony — subtitled “The Afro-American Symphony” — but also push audiences toward less familiar parts of the composer’s body of work. “He’s unapologetic about being a black person,” said Mr. Wilkins. “In the last movement of the First Symphony, he begins with this plaintive song in the entire orchestra, that eventually finds its way to the cello section only — which I think is the instrument which sounds most like the human voice. There is this ‘Lord have mercy’ kind of sound in that music. And then, of course, the allegro takes over. It’s ‘we have no choice but to go forward.’ That’s what that music does.” In the Fourth Symphony, Mr. Wilkins identifies “that same longing, that same aspirational sound world. But this symphony ends not allegro, but profoundly — it’s like a pronouncement at the end. It’s grand, and the gestures are large and bold. And not lickety-split fast. It is its own kind of affirmation: ‘Yes, this is who I am.’” Asked what else they could imagine programming, were the Philharmonic’s short festival to be longer, Mr. Wilkins named William Dawson’s “Negro Folk Symphony” and “more Hailstork.” Mr. Diehl said he would be eager to tease out unexpected connections between different centuries: “I would have Scarlatti on, maybe, the top half of the set. And then end with, like, Roscoe Mitchell. I just feel like good music is good music. Duke Ellington always said that.” "
5cacb50949f0eacbf1f81d89,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/09/arts/music/lil-nas-x-old-town-road.html,"A wealth of internet memes plus a viral controversy over race and the sanctity of country music have led to a distinctly 21st century No. 1 song: Lil Nas X’s “Old Town Road,” a sticky genre hybrid that has been the talk of social networks and the music industry alike for weeks. The track, which clocks in at only one minute and 53 seconds, dethroned “7 Rings” by Ariana Grande for the top spot on the industry-standard Hot 100 singles chart, Billboard announced on Monday night. The chart is determined by weighing a combination of digital streams, radio airplay and digital sales data in the United States. “Old Town Road” depended largely on streaming, totaling nearly 47 million plays — over 10 million more than its closest competitor — in the last week of chart eligibility, which ended Friday. The song was also downloaded 22,000 times and received an increase in radio play as it became a cause célèbre this month. Buzz began to grow when “Old Town Road,” which the Atlanta rapper Lil Nas X described as country-trap, arrived on three charts simultaneously: the Hot 100, Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot Country Songs. With silly lyrics delivered in an exaggerated drawl (“cowboy hat from Gucci/Wrangler on my booty”), the track had become an online sensation through memes on social apps like TikTok, where young people made short country-themed videos set to the song. But Billboard soon removed “Old Town Road” from the country chart, calling its initial inclusion a mistake because the song “does not embrace enough elements of today’s country music.” (The song’s beat samples an instrumental number by Nine Inch Nails, which includes a plucked banjo melody.) Many critics of the decision questioned whether race was a factor, and noted modern country’s frequent use of rapping and digital drum sounds from hip-hop. In a savvy chess move, Lil Nas X, who signed to Columbia Records amid the song’s rise, released a remix on Friday featuring the veteran country singer Billy Ray Cyrus, who argued for it to be embraced by the Nashville establishment. Billboard addressed its handling of the song in a statement on Friday, saying that the company would “continue to monitor how it is marketed and how fans respond.” It added: “Our initial decision to remove ‘Old Town Road’ from the Hot Country Songs chart could be revisited as these factors evolve.” (Because of its release date, numbers for the remix will be counted toward the position of “Old Town Road” on next week’s Billboard charts. On Tuesday, the rapper Young Thug also teased a remix.) For Lil Nas X, who turned 20 on Tuesday, the strange trip to No. 1 was well worth it. Regardless of any negativity, he posted on Twitter, “i’m going down in history.” "
5cae2ec449f0eacbf1f8268c,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/10/arts/music/bruce-hornsby-absolute-zero-review.html,"One way for a songwriter to invigorate a long career is to keep breaking routines, to change up methods and parameters and solve different puzzles with every album. It’s a modus operandi that has carried Bruce Hornsby from radio hits in the 1980s through bluegrass, jazz, a stint in the Grateful Dead and, lately, collaborations with a younger-generation fan, Justin Vernon of Bon Iver. “Absolute Zero,” his 21st album, is one more daring, rewarding turn in his catalog: 10 knotty, thoughtful yet rambunctious songs that juggle scientific concepts, history and human relationships. “Absolute Zero” makes a 180-degree pendulum swing from Hornsby’s 2016 album, “Rehab Reunion.” On that record, Hornsby set aside the piano for songs built around the dulcimer, with basic folky harmonies and string-band-centered arrangements. “Absolute Zero,” in contrast, doubles down on piano virtuosity and musical intricacies: odd meters, polytonality, bustling counterpoint. In the new songs, Hornsby addresses a complex, distressing world with complex music, offering not an escape but a cleareyed recognition of 21st-century pressures and longings. In 2019, “Absolute Zero” is decisively untrendy. Its songs are dense, literate, hand-played and largely acoustic (though a collaboration with Vernon, a forlorn lover’s plaint titled “Cast-Off,” does slip in some electronics). Rather than build productions with synthetic sounds, for half of the album Hornsby brought in yMusic, the contemporary chamber sextet that has also worked lately with Paul Simon, and its violinist and arranger Rob Moose; other songs use string orchestras. Hornsby then juxtaposed the disembodied classical ensembles with sinewy little studio bands that can kick and swing in any meter. One of the puzzles Hornsby seems to have set for himself is seeing just how many pointillistic motifs he can set in motion without getting in the way of his voice. Ambition and exuberance merge in songs like “The Blinding Light of Dreams,” with pensive lyrics flung into complicated motion. “The Blinding Light of Dreams” reflects on the history of racism in the South, racing along on an insistent 13-note piano pattern and dodging dissonant interjections from yMusic. And “Voyager One” is a kind of multidimensional hoedown, with piano and yMusic meshing in overlapping riffs while Hornsby sings about space exploration and wonders if humanity will destroy itself before Voyager makes contact with other life-forms. “Let’s break out of our orbits, fix the world we all neglect/We share this little planet, our neighbors need respect,” he sings. Hornsby draws on science terms to get personal. In the title song of “Absolute Zero,” he imagines being cryogenically preserved for a century, awaiting “Another chance, maybe better next time”; sparse piano and sustained woodwinds suspend his voice as the drummer Jack DeJohnette pinpoints time still passing. In “Fractals,” Hornsby maps the infinitely replicating, mathematically generated chaos of fractals onto a romance: “Our love is a fractal/Curves and shapes irregular,” he sings. But first comes a brittle, two-handed, stop-start piano part that doesn’t quite establish a key or a beat. While he sings, percussion pecks at offbeats before settling into 4/4, while piano and pizzicato strings continue to pelt him with syncopation. Amid all the musical antics, Hornsby doesn’t lose perspective. The grain of his voice and his folky sense of melody still hold together all of the songs’ odd machinations. And midway through the album, he touches down on the kind of cozy, empathetic song that established him in the 1980s and continue to dot his albums. “Never in This House,” written with Chip DeMatteo, yearns for a stable family home where “all our problems disappear.” The piano is rich and hymnlike, the chamber ensemble is a supportive mini-orchestra; the music fulfills what the refrain — never in this house” — will not. It’s a brief point of repose on an album that thrives on its own restlessness. "
5c2bc8fb3a125f5075c0277c,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/01/arts/aldo-parisot-dead.html,"Aldo Parisot, a renowned cellist who toured the world as a soloist and settled into a career as an eminent teacher that included a 60-year tenure at the Yale School of Music, died on Saturday at his home in Guilford, Conn. He was 100. His death was announced by his son, Dean Parisot, a film director and producer in Los Angeles. The cellist had retired from Yale only last June. During the busiest stage of his solo career Mr. Parisot performed with the major orchestras of Berlin, London, Paris and Munich, and with conductors including Leopold Stokowski, Pierre Monteux and Leonard Bernstein, winning plaudits for his warm, focused sound; prodigious technique; and a temperament that balanced passion and elegance. For a 1955 New York Philharmonic appearance under the conductor Walter Hendl, he gave the premiere of Heitor Villa-Lobos’s Cello Concerto No. 2, one of many works Mr. Parisot would commission during his career to expand the cello repertory. But by his 30s he had started teaching. He held positions at the Peabody Conservatory (now part of Johns Hopkins University), Mannes College of Music and elsewhere before joining the faculty at Yale in 1958. Many Parisot students have gone on to solo careers and to prominent positions in ensembles, orchestras and conservatories. They include Roman Jablonski, Ole Akahoshi and Shauna Rolston. Carter Brey, the principal cellist of the New York Philharmonic, who studied with Mr. Parisot at Yale in the late 1970s, shared his memories in an email. Mr. Parisot’s teaching style “was not based on the transmission of a grand, overarching view of music,” Mr. Brey wrote. “Neither was it greatly concerned with historical detail. It was practical, reactive and prescriptive.” Being part of his class was like attending “the highest-level finishing school imaginable,” Mr. Brey wrote, “none of us sounding like anyone else, and above all none of us sounding like him.” Aldo Simões Parisot was born on Sept. 30, 1918, in Natal, Brazil. His mother was a church organist. His father, an engineer, died when Aldo was 4. His stepfather, Thomazzo Babini, a fine cellist, was his first and only significant cello teacher. “Everything I know and teach today comes from him,” Mr. Parisot said of his stepfather in 2001. At 18 he became the principal cellist of the orchestra in Rio de Janeiro. Still, he was restless for a solo career. The attaché to the American Embassy, impressed by Mr. Parisot, helped arrange for him to study at the Curtis Institute of Music with his idol, the great cellist Emanuel Feuermann. But Feuermann died in 1942 three months before Mr. Parisot was to start lessons. (He would later acquire a Stradivarius cello that had belonged to Feuermann.) In 1946, Mr. Parisot became a scholarship student at the Yale School of Music, but with a stipulation that he would take no cello lessons: He already felt confident of his technique and approach. Instead he studied chamber music and, with the composer Paul Hindemith, music theory. In 1948 he joined the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra but left after two years. A 1950 recital at Town Hall in New York drew wide praise and led to international tours and recordings. He had a major success in 1966 at Tanglewood when he gave the premiere of Donald Martino’s “Parisonatina al’dodecafonia,” a formidable work for solo cello written for him. Reviewing the performance, The New York Times critic Harold C. Schonberg, who in general resisted thorny modern music employing 12-tone techniques, was enthusiastic about Martino’s “whizbang virtuoso piece in the modern idiom,” as he called it. Probably as “difficult a work as ever has been written for the cello,” Mr. Schonberg wrote, the piece “throws at the performer everything in the book and a few things that aren’t.” But, he added, in an “extraordinary performance,” Mr. Parisot “accomplished everything with an easy, almost bored expression,” and “his tone and intonation never betrayed him.” Besides the lure of teaching, Mr. Parisot curtailed his solo career to spend more time with his family. He is survived by his wife of 52 years, Elizabeth (Sawyer) Parisot, a pianist and professor at the Yale School of Music; his three sons from a previous marriage to Ellen (Lewis) Parisot, Dean, Robert and Ricardo; a half brother, Italo Babini, a cellist; and six grandchildren. Another student, the cellist Ralph Kirshbaum, wrote in a 2009 New York Times appreciation that Mr. Parisot’s “directness and impulsive statements, uncensored by political correctness,” sometimes “ruffled feathers.” But his teacher radiated warmth, charm and impish humor, Mr. Kirshbaum wrote. The article quotes the famous cellist and pedagogue Janos Starker describing Mr. Parisot as “the best cello teacher I have met in my life.” In 1983, Mr. Parisot founded Yale Cellos, an ensemble of 20 or so cellists who play everything from arrangements of Bach to contemporary scores. Though the group’s overall sound is deep and rich, Mr. Parisot, as conductor, drew remarkable clarity and nuance from the ensemble, which toured and recorded, including a Delos CD “Bach Bachianas” that earned a 1988 Grammy nomination. Long ago Mr. Parisot started proclaiming that he was 60 years old and would remain 60 until he died. “The secret to staying young,” he was quoted as saying in the 2009 Times article, “is to surround yourself with the younger generation. It is boring to talk to the elderly about their blood pressure and cholesterol levels.” "
5c80210b49f0eacbf105bae8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/06/arts/music/nakhane-you-will-not-die.html,"LONDON — To command stages and mesmerize crowds, musicians often have to be larger than life: a bigger head, a heavier foot. But Nakhane slipped quietly into a grand London hotel late one Sunday last month, soft-stepping even in combat boots, taking up little space in a corner armchair with a feline kind of grace. Nakhane, 31, who was born Nakhane Mavuso and has used Nakhane Touré as an artist name, had shrugged off the opportunity to show off his East End neighborhood, his home since moving from South Africa in 2018. “My life has always been internal,” he said. “Journalists say, ‘Take us to your favorite places,’ and I never had them. I don’t go anywhere except to the coffee shop around the corner.” Nakhane’s music, on the other hand, stretches up and out. His voice — grand, sweeping, choir-trained and soul-stirred — is a trumpet blast. And his new album, “You Will Not Die,” released last year in Europe and Africa and in the United States last month, is an LP of aching contradictions, at once sensual and spiritual, wrestling with faith, love, lust and country. Nakhane’s music has an orchestral grandeur and a quicksilver soul. Raised by an aunt who sang opera, he grew up to a score of Handel, Mozart and Bach, to which his aunt eventually added Marvin Gaye and the O’Jays. But the glamorous spirit of David Bowie hovers over the record, too, and when Nakhane began working with the producer Ben Christophers (Bat for Lashes), the singer told him, “Let’s take the second side of ‘Low’ and write songs with it, but as if it was in the streets of South Africa.” For the moment, though, he has given up South Africa for a life abroad. In his home country, Nakhane, who is queer, has been threatened with both death and damnation. He wrote “You Will Not Die” after leaving his church, for which he had evangelized an anti-gay theology. He ultimately left the country after starring in “The Wound,” a film that set a gay love plot against the backdrop of the traditional initiation ritual for Xhosa boys. The film was a hit on the festival circuit and was South Africa’s submission to the Academy Awards. But it also drew fury for revealing intimate details of the Ulwaluko, the circumcision ceremony he underwent as a young man, and for showing that gayness, far from being a foreign infection as some South Africans prefer to believe, exists among the Xhosa, too. “I still can’t go home to Port Elizabeth,” he said of the city on the Eastern Cape where he grew up. “I know my people. We are very passionate people.” South Africa is relatively permissive on L.G.B.T.Q. issues, but the churches he and his family attended were rigidly doctrinaire. So despite coming out at 17 to his friends and 19 to his family, Nakhane renounced being gay after a chance meeting with a pastor’s son at the record shop where he worked. He threw himself into the church, attending bible studies, singing in the church band and preaching the possibility of conversion. Eventually, buckling under the strain of denying himself — coupled with a growing awareness of the colonialist implications of the church’s teachings, and a racist dynamic he could no longer ignore — he left. “I’m not angry at it anymore,” Nakhane said of his life then. He has removed those he knew in the church from his life, he said, but has less venom for them than the press would wish, he added. “They did love me,” he said. “This is all they knew.” What he knew was the destiny he believed in for himself. “You are going to be one of the most important South African artists to come out of this country,” he recalled telling himself while still a student in Johannesburg. “You don’t know when. You don’t know how. But it’s going to happen. And the work starts now.” The work started with “Brave Confusion,” a folksy 2013 album released in South Africa that performed better critically than commercially. But it was the collapse of all that he knew — his exit from the church after six years, a period of financial hardship and quasi-homelessness — that led to the emotional breakthroughs he explores on “You Will Not Die.” Even for someone who had grown up thinking of songwriting as a form of divine inspiration (“It seemed like such a priestly job. You’ve been chosen to write a song”), being chosen is not an uncomplicated blessing, and Nakhane is not romantic about the alchemy of turning experience in art. His work, as he described it, is taking the “shrapnel” of inspiration and forming it into something. “Songs are dangerous,” he said. “Art is dangerous. And painful. You do it because you have to.” For all its pain and longing, “You Will Not Die” is not bleak: It tracks a long arc toward joy. “Interloper” is dark but up-tempo — self-affirmation to a propulsive beat. “Never live in fear again, no, never again,” is the chorus of “New Brighton,” a single recorded with Anohni, whose music has sonic parallels with Nakhane’s own. The two never met, Anohni said in an email, and completed the track separately. But she called it “exuberant and so heartbreaking,” and Nakhane’s music “very beautiful and soulful and smoldering.” His fearlessness is drawing admirers. Madonna called him one of her favorite artists, and the filmmaker John Cameron Mitchell cast him in his new project, a musical radio-play-by-podcast called “Anthem: Homunculus,” which will debut in late April. “To me, he is some kind of love child of James Baldwin, David Bowie and Grace Jones,” Mitchell said. “He’s the most exciting new renaissance artist I’ve seen this century.” For now, Nakhane is adjusting to his own new horizons: living in London with a boyfriend, touring his music, beginning to write more. (He is at work on what may turn into his second novel.) He is back on good terms with his family, and spiritual, if no longer religious, about the unique privilege of being Nakhane. “Someone like me could never have existed in any other era than now,” he said. “The fact that I have an album being released internationally, being an out, political, queer black person who speaks his mind and makes good music? My existence is miraculous.” "
5c7c12ad49f0eacbf105b1f4,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/03/arts/music/review-tclaire-chases-project.html,"It would be understandable for an artist to appear merely dutiful, at some point, during a 23-year creative project requiring annual check-ins. So how does the flutist Claire Chase sound, circa the sixth edition of “Density 2036,” her long-term initiative to commission and premiere a new raft of repertoire for her instrument? On the evidence of her concert Friday night at the Kitchen, she is not feeling bogged down yet. Nor does she seem likely to court ennui in the immediate future. That’s partly the result of some good taste in programming, as this year’s set included imaginative works from marquee composers like Olga Neuwirth and Pamela Z. Ms. Neuwirth’s “Magic Flu-idity,” for flute and typewriter, was a distillation of a flute concerto (which Ms. Chase has played with the Swedish Chamber Orchestra). But this reduction did not feel like an afterthought. The frequently hard-riffing interplay between the flutist and typist — at the Kitchen, it was percussionist Nathan Davis — proved lively across each of the work’s three sections. The suppleness of the typewriter’s clicks, as heard in the hall, served as a reminder of the work of the sound designer Levy Lorenzo, whose subtly effective approach to amplification helped the evening cohere. A balance of pretaped elements and live acoustic playing was crucial in Ms. Z’s “Louder, Warmer, Denser,” a work that samples and loops Ms. Chase’s own voice. By splicing some of the flutist’s conversational asides and spontaneous laughter alongside some more planned-sounding recitations, the composer managed to highlight the songful quality that animates this artist’s speech in casual settings. The live part for various flutes — including bass and contrabass varieties — occasionally imitated those prefashioned motifs, while at other junctures it seemed to trigger new twists in the work’s progression. “Roots of Interior,” by Phyllis Chen, was another composition that interacted with Ms. Chase as something other than just a flutist. In the program note the composer cited as an inspiration the act of listening to two heartbeats “beating in counterpoint,” during pregnancy. The most involving part of the piece for Ms. Chase involved the flutist soaring over some shifting yet complementary heartbeat patterns. A finale that involved the player partnering with herself — made possible by a digital stethoscope attached to her — was a theatrical and touching idea, though for me it was not as sonically arresting as the rest of the composition. By contrast, Sarah Hennies’s “Reservoir 2: Intrusion” initially seemed to sideline Ms. Chase, the better to focus on the composer’s instructions for eight vocalists from the Constellation Chor. In the early minutes, it seemed as if all the flutist would be asked to do was drone a solitary note — softly — as the singers drifted across the stage (and across a wider variety of hummed tones). The flute’s stasis was not permanent. And while it was hard to pinpoint the exact moment at which Ms. Chase’s part began to move, by the end, the effect of a slow but steady descent was keenly felt — as was the gradual deepening of a connection between Ms. Chase and the other performers, thanks to some mirroring of pulses and exhalation effects. The composition also worked as something of a breather, on this program, in advance of a comparatively stormy piece by Tyshawn Sorey, who joined Ms. Chase as a percussionist for a performance of “Bertha’s Lair.” (The work was originally heard in an earlier edition of “Density 2036,” and was revised ahead of this performance.) Performing well alongside Mr. Sorey — one of the most masterful player-composers of this era, in any idiom — requires a deep repository of strategies. Ms. Chase brought a substantial warehouse of tools to this meeting, venturing some whispery timbres while the percussionist was gently manipulating a small gong. At other points, Ms. Chase projected a rounded warmth during longer, tricky lines that collided with passages of greater percussive tumult. Toward the end of the performance, I had the feeling that I would happily listen to this duo configuration for a full set. The evening concluded with a performance of Edgard Varèse’s “Density 21.5,” the 20th-century classic that has motivated Ms. Chase’s 21st-century pursuit of new repertoire. That brief work’s stark cries of heraldry served as a moving, climactic end to a show that was paced to entertain. In progressing without breaks for applause over 75 minutes, this concert’s movement from one piece to the next was, at times, too smooth. Brief tape-music compositions by Bahar Royaee and Mr. Lorenzo (who also contributed an LED artwork titled “Light Flute” to the staging) were presented casually — essentially serving as interstitial music, while Ms. Chase darted between platforms inside the Kitchen’s space. Though as far as downsides go, this occasional sense of being too charged-up is the right kind of problem for an organizer to have during a multidecade initiative as demanding as this one. "
5c7ecea049f0eacbf105b79f,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/05/arts/music/yo-yo-ma-wu-man-new-york-philharmonic.html,"“A Happy Excursion,” a double concerto that has its American premiere on Wednesday with the New York Philharmonic, takes its title from an ancient Taoist text. But it could just as easily describe the joyous performance of its soloists, Yo-Yo Ma and Wu Man. They were at the top of their fields when they met in the 1990s: Mr. Ma, a superstar cellist; Ms. Wu, the world’s leading pipa player and a tireless ambassador for that lutelike Chinese instrument. Living in the same small Boston suburb, they became quick friends and colleagues; they’ve played together at the White House and with Mr. Ma’s Silkroad Ensemble. [How Yo-Yo Ma wants Bach to save the world.] Among their collaborators has been Zhao Lin, who wrote “A Happy Excursion” and, in the spirit of Silkroad, has already blended traditionally Eastern and Western instruments in another double concerto: “Duo” (2013), for cello and sheng, a Chinese reed instrument. His latest concerto — a lush and cinematic work in three movements — pairs the cello and the pipa, which dates back more than 2,000 years. (Compare that with the relatively young cello, created around the 16th century.) In an interview this week, Mr. Ma and Ms. Wu discussed the piece’s meaning, and what their instruments sound like together. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation. How would you describe the character of this concerto?  YO-YO MA Zhao Lin comes from a very literary and artistic family. He has a sense of old and new, and really knows poetic traditions. In the second movement, Wu Man plays this theme — it’s a melody that goes back to around the year 700 A.D. But he picked that and said, “I’m going to actually do something with this movement that shows something from that era,” the Tang dynasty. WU MAN In the Tang dynasty, music is very different from modern Chinese music. MA Zhao Lin also comes from Xi’an, which around the Tang dynasty had easily a population of over a million people. They had mosques, Buddhist temples and Christian churches. It was really open; they called it one of the golden ages. It was such a rich and open and multicultural society. So there is a kind of beauty to that movement, going back to this golden period. The title, “A Happy Excursion,” is a little misleading. What do you mean? WU In Chinese, everyone understands it. A better translation is that you’re more a kind of scholar. It’s the ideal life. With imagination, you can go everywhere you want to go. MA You can go everywhere. And he takes us through time travel. The first movement is all about the beginning of things, different forces that come together and become China. We have that second movement, the golden period. And then we have the last movement, the present. It’s in seven — it’s a very contemporary rhythmic sound — but it has elements of the golden period in it. So the question is, how are we, in our present moment, going to evolve ourselves? [Plan ahead with The New York Times’s Culture Calendar.] The timbres of your two instruments are so different. Does that pose a challenge?  WU I still remember the first time we played together. In the first rehearsal, I felt really bad and awkward because I didn’t know how I could play with the cello. They do sound different. We changed how we produce sound on the instrument. [Speaking to Mr. Ma] You changed your bowing. But over 20 years we kind of got used to it, so the combination of pipa and cello is not strange to us anymore. The pipa has a history as a court and solo instrument. But they can be produced for a bigger hall now, with steel strings instead of silk. We also use amplification. MA Can I say something about Wu Man? Whether it’s science, journalism or anything, you want people to take the profession further, setting the tone for what’s desirable and what can advance. Today, the pipa and Wu Man are kind of synonymous, and the instrument is normal. But it’s because in 29 years she’s gone from something that’s exotic to absolutely accepted. She plays in cafes, stadiums, concert halls, museums. She’s commissioned everybody: Lou Harrison, Philip Glass, Zhao Lin. The repertory was very small, but she has expanded it by several hundred thousand percent. What does it mean that this piece — and this instrument — is represented onstage with the New York Philharmonic?  MA What I love about New York is that it’s a world city. Depending on whom you ask, either that’s a terrible thing or it’s the most normal thing. You look at the New York Phil, and look at the number of Asians — what we need, actually, is much more African-American and Latin-American representation, because those are our two largest minorities. I don’t think either Wu Man or I feel odd being what we are. It feels normal to us. I’m not proud; I’m just glad. WU It’s music. Enjoy it. "
5c5a18fa3a125f5075c082bf,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/05/arts/music/new-york-philharmonic-2019-20-season.html,"Freshman year can excite with newness, but it’s as sophomores that people tend to come into their own. Jaap van Zweden’s reign as music director of the New York Philharmonic came into clearer view on Tuesday, when the orchestra announced its 2019-20 season, its second under his baton. There will be nods to the past, as in an exploration of Mahler’s time leading the Philharmonic in the final years of his life. There will be lots of new music, too, with Mr. van Zweden giving premieres by Philip Glass, Tania León, Nico Muhly, Sarah Kirkland Snider, Nina C. Young and Ellen Reid. And there will be experiments — as when he conducts Renée Fleming in Björk songs. To mark the centennial of the 19th Amendment, which barred states from denying voting rights based on gender, the Philharmonic has commissioned new works by 19 female composers, eight of which will be performed next season. Besides celebrating what Deborah Borda, the orchestra’s president and chief executive officer, called a “tectonic shift in American culture,” the project sends a statement to the classical music field at a moment when female composers still struggle to be heard. The pianist Daniil Trifonov will be the orchestra’s artist in residence. Visiting conductors will include Susanna Malkki, Esa-Pekka Salonen, Gustavo Dudamel, Simone Young, Franz Welser-Möst and Valery Gergiev. And the Philharmonic’s popular film series will offer screenings of “Close Encounters of the Third Kind,” “Psycho,” “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone,” “Singin’ in the Rain” and “Mary Poppins,” with the orchestra playing the scores live. With so much on tap, what do our critics and writers want to hear? With a little sleight of hand, Mr. van Zweden has moved the requisite start-of-season gala into early October; it’s a Beethoven program with the superstar pianist Lang Lang. But for his first subscription concerts he has chosen a somewhat bolder program: a new work by Mr. Glass; Barber’s “Knoxville: Summer of 1915,” with Broadway’s own Kelli O’Hara; and selections from Prokofiev’s “Romeo and Juliet.” ANTHONY TOMMASINI Splashily staged opera productions were among Alan Gilbert’s boldest innovations during his time at the Philharmonic’s helm. Mindful, perhaps, of their success, Mr. van Zweden will lead a staged double bill of two darkly brilliant early-20th-century works, directed by the Swedish stage designer Bengt Gomer using video, lighting and shadow actors. The formidable soprano Nina Stemme takes on Judith in “Bluebeard’s Castle” alongside the baritone Johannes Martin Kränzle; Katarina Karneus sings “Erwartung.” CORINNA da FONSECA-WOLLHEIM The first time I heard “Su” — Unsuk Chin’s 2009 concerto for sheng, a Chinese mouth organ — I nearly jumped out of my chair. I was using iPhone earbuds, but Ms. Chin’s imaginative exploration of timbre still packed a memorable punch. I’ve loved the work since that first encounter; it was my pick for our “5 Minutes That Will Make You Love Classical Music” feature last year. I’ll now have my first chance to hear it live, led by Ms. Malkki, with Wu Wei as soloist. SETH COLTER WALLS This fascinating program offers a hint of what might have been had Mr. Salonen, who is heading to the San Francisco Symphony, become the Philharmonic’s music director instead. Between rare performances of Schoenberg’s glittering orchestral transcriptions of two works by Bach, Mr. Salonen conducts a pair of his own scores: “Castor” (in its New York premiere) and “Pollux.” The program ends with Hindemith’s great “Mathis der Maler” Symphony. ANTHONY TOMMASINI Mr. Trifonov has justly rocketed to New York omnipresence, and has become a fixture at the Philharmonic, including a memorable traversal of Rachmaninoff’s concertos in 2015. This year he’ll play a relative rarity: Scriabin’s Piano Concerto, a Romantic but unassuming work that will benefit from Mr. Trifonov’s subtle delicacy. (Mr. van Zweden conducts.) His residency with the orchestra will also include a Mozart classic (the Piano Concerto No. 25); a solo recital of Bach and arrangements of Bach; and the New York premiere of his Piano Quintet. ZACHARY WOOLFE It’s not often that the Philharmonic devotes five performances to a single program. But it is handing over significant real estate to a star: Mr. Dudamel, who will lead Ives’s “The Unanswered Question,” Dvorak’s “New World” Symphony and a premiere by Esteban Benzecry. Two days after that run ends, Mr. Dudamel will be back for a program of Schubert’s Fourth Symphony and Mahler’s “Das Lied von der Erde.” JOSHUA BARONE Play Elgar and I’ll be there, but this whole program has a welcome, unforced focus to it, compared to much else in the Philharmonic’s sprawling season. Call it a Commonwealth affair, with Elgar’s “Enigma Variations” and the “Four Sea Interludes” from Britten’s “Peter Grimes” framing the American premiere of the Australian composer Brett Dean’s Cello Concerto. Alban Gerhardt is the soloist; the conductor, Simone Young, was born and started her career in Sydney. DAVID ALLEN Joan La Barbara is the kind of gifted, veteran New York composer the Philharmonic has often declined to notice. She’s experimentally minded, certainly, but her works contain plenty of more traditional operatic melody, too. All of which makes a commission from her — set to appear as part of the contemporary chamber music series “Sound On” alongside new works by Nicole Lizée and Paola Prestini — a potential highlight of the season. SETH COLTER WALLS Mr. Welser-Möst has not been on the Philharmonic’s podium since 2000, two years before he took charge of the Cleveland Orchestra. New York is on its third new music director since then, but he’s still going strong in Ohio, and returns with the kind of sophisticated, new-old program Cleveland audiences will recognize: Jörg Widmann’s suite of music from his 2012 opera “Babylon” — the Philharmonic’s answer to Carnegie Hall’s focus on Mr. Widmann next season — and Strauss’s “Symphonia Domestica.” ZACHARY WOOLFE It’s a work that should play to Mr. van Zweden’s strengths: Mahler’s Symphony No. 2 (“Resurrection”), a monumental exploration of mortality with moments of ferocity, tenderness, and, hopefully, transcendence. The lineup, featuring the soprano Joélle Harvey and the mezzo-soprano Sasha Cooke, is promising. And it will be nice to get to hear the immense work for its own sake rather than for a grand occasion: an orchestra’s return from a strike or the commemoration of a disaster. MICHAEL COOPER The Berlin installment of “Hotspots” — a short festival exploring musical creation in that city, Reykjavik and New York — is exciting for including the first time the Philharmonic will play the orchestral music of Olga Neuwirth. (She’s Austrian, but, then again, the Reykjavik program features a new work by Nico Muhly, a New Yorker.) Conducting Ms. Neuwirth’s premiere will be John Adams, on a program with his “City Noir” and a suite from Prokofiev’s “The Love for Three Oranges.” JOSHUA BARONE More Adams rounds out the season at David Geffen Hall: his luminous choral symphony “Harmonium,” with texts by Donne and Dickinson. The Philharmonic has done it just once before, and it’s unmissable. It concludes a program that also features Ms. Snider’s premiere and Shostakovich’s sprightly Concerto for Piano (Yuja Wang, in some luxury casting), Trumpet (the orchestra’s principal, Christopher Martin) and Strings.

But this season, the initiatives created to fill the gap — two series, “Nightcap” and “Sound On” — have proven roughly as consistent in quality as Contact! was. On Sunday at the Appel Room, at Jazz at Lincoln Center, the Philharmonic fielded a “Sound On” program that was one of its most entertaining new-music shows of the past couple of years. Called “Threads,” it was related — at least a little — to last week’s premiere of “Fire in my mouth,” a new oratorio by Julia Wolfe inspired by the 1911 Triangle shirtwaist factory fire. Sunday’s concert was organized around composers who have spent some time in America. Close enough (if you’re generous). [Read our review of the premiere of “Fire in my mouth.”] Stronger than any connection to Ms. Wolfe’s work was the level of the music selected by the host and curator of “Sound On,” the violist Nadia Sirota. Among the highlights was “At the Kansas City Chinese New Year Concert,” a compact but theatrically astute string quartet by Chen Yi, who has long taught at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. The first movement has an inviting, celebratory air. The second uses long-held tones and vibrato effects to evoke, according to Ms. Chen’s program note, hand-pulled noodle making. The concert put some Philharmonic players in intriguing spotlights. The pianist Eric Huebner was arresting, whether teasing out the Dowland-derived melody of Thomas Adès’s solo “Darknesse Visible,” or pulsing away with the machine-like rhythms of “Bulb,” a piano trio by Donnacha Dennehy. Another string quartet — “Chambers,” by Marcos Balter — was, for me, the standout. Mr. Balter’s music tends to be both rigorous in construction and playful in overall effect. In his program note, he wrote of his interest in creating an aural illusion of forces larger than those on stage. He achieved this in the delirium of the third movement, which seemed to draw from the static opening movement and the more staggered patterns of the second — while adding something newly mystical. I wondered what he might do with the full forces of the Philharmonic at his disposal. The repertory at the orchestra’s main stage concert on Wednesday evening at David Geffen Hall was rather less contemporary. Which is not to say that inspiration was absent. Half the program was every bit as rousing as the “Sound On” event. The pianist Emanuel Ax’s turn in Stravinsky’s Capriccio for Piano and Orchestra had elegant energy running through it, as did Jaap van Zweden’s approach to Mozart’s Symphony No. 41 (“Jupiter”). In Stravinsky’s succession of instrumental color pairings, Mr. Ax had a knack for blending with the Philharmonic players while still punching his sound through. The composer’s love for then-new jazz textures was evident, and appropriately jaunty. But crucially, the performance wasn’t jokey. This was caprice with just the right amount of edge. In the “Jupiter” Symphony, Mr. van Zweden found smart ways to assert his personality without losing the overall shape of the piece — as when he allowed bass-heavy orchestral balances to bloom (ever so briefly) during the inner movements. Less gripping were the performances that opened the concert. Mr. Ax clearly delights in Haydn. But a sense of discovery was absent during this version of the Piano Concerto No. 11 in D. And while Mozart’s first symphony, written when he was 8, makes for an obvious complement to the “Jupiter,” his final symphony, programming the early work can also seem like a frittering away of the orchestra’s time on stage, merely for the benefit of a cute idea.

John Adams is set to conduct the Los Angeles Philharmonic in the premiere of Philip Glass’s Symphony No. 12, “Lodger,” at Walt Disney Concert Hall on Thursday. The work is inspired by Bowie’s 1979 collaboration with Brian Eno and the producer Tony Visconti, the final album in what’s usually called their Berlin trilogy, which also includes “Low” and “Heroes,” both from 1977. Mr. Glass’s First Symphony, back in 1992, was based on “Low”; his Fourth (1996), on “Heroes.” “I put off the third for a long time — 20 years — before I realized that I owed them something,” Mr. Glass said in a recent telephone interview. Mr. Adams was also on the conference call — he in Berkeley, Calif., Mr. Glass in New York — to discuss the symphony, Bowie and whether Mr. Glass’s music is hard to conduct. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation. How did this symphony come about? PHILIP GLASS It’s part of a commitment I had made to David Bowie and Brian Eno to take three of their records and turn them into symphonies. In “Lodger,” to me the most interesting thing was the lyrics, the poems. In the earlier ones, the musical idea was quite challenging and worthwhile to work on, but when I got to “Lodger,” I didn’t find that interest in the musical part of it; the interest was in the text. After hedging a little bit, I thought I might as well make a song symphony. Mahler, of course, was the great one at that. I used seven of the texts; I didn’t use all 10. That would have pushed me over an hour, and I didn’t want to go there. I don’t know, John, if you’re aware of this, but this was written — the words were written — when David was living in Berlin. JOHN ADAMS Yeah, you mentioned that to me. GLASS And Brian was there, and Iggy Pop was there; those were his companions. They were there trying to make a movie out of “The Idiot” by Dostoyevsky. None of them spoke Russian, or German, even. But on the other hand, these were three really interesting people in our music world and music life, and made big statements — icons, all of them. ADAMS A really great text is just so generative; it produces the best music. If I have a concern about some operas these days, it’s that the texts are just not good enough. It doesn’t have to be someone with a deep literary background; it can be a David Bowie or Brian Eno. The great thing about American music is the total bleed-through of, if you want to call it that, high or low, popular versus art. I think both Philip and I share this. We have very loose filters in terms of classification. When did you first hear each other’s music? ADAMS The thing I remember most vividly is a tour of the ensemble doing excerpts from “Einstein on the Beach,” which I heard in San Francisco sometime in the 1970s. Then I actually conducted quite a bit of his music — a little piece, “Facades,” and then I think we did the very first performance of parts of “Akhnaten” in L.A. on a Phil program, 50 minutes’ worth. I did the Ninth Symphony, again with L.A., and then this. I came of age during what we now call the bad old days, when the world said you had a choice between European modernism and its American version, or Cagean aesthetics. Hearing Philip’s music and Steve [Reich’s] music was this wonderful, new possibility of a language that embraced both tonality and sort of living with a pulse, new, original and fresh. GLASS I was very much taken with hearing John’s work — of course, “Nixon in China,” we talked about a number of times. It’s not enough to create a style of music or identity of your own; what you really want to be is in the company of other people. It’s more meaningful to be part of a large group of people sharing ideas. He was the first time I met someone who wasn’t part of my immediate generation but had the interest and talent. How many operas do you have now? Five or six? ADAMS [Laughing] Not as many as you do! [Depending on how you count, Mr. Glass has composed nearly 30.] Is Philip’s music tough to conduct? ADAMS It continues to be a slow absorption of Philip’s orchestral music into the regular repertoire; I’m surprised that more conductors haven’t taken it on. He has a couple of symphonies, like the Eighth, where there are some real challenges rhythmically. But it’s not hard to conduct on a technical level. I think the challenge is creating a sound, and with some orchestras it’s simply getting them into the right frame of mind. Something like the Ninth Symphony, which is nearly an hour long, it demands a kind of Zen-like concentration by the players, the way some Bruckner symphonies do. It’s not like doing “The Rite of Spring,” where there’s a thrill every 10 seconds. You have a steady build and a long line. What does it pair best with? ADAMS I don’t think there’s a great challenge there. You could put anything with it. I see programs that have put a piece of Philip’s together with a Baroque piece; that makes sense in certain ways. I’ve put his smaller pieces on programs with my own music, but sometimes with Steve or Terry [Riley]: obvious harmonious conjunctions. This program we’re doing at the L.A. Phil, I’m doing with an old piece of mine, “Grand Pianola Music.” GLASS I’m delighted to be able to hear it again. I haven’t heard it in a long time. Philip, does it annoy you that these symphonies are still not done more widely? GLASS Quite the opposite: I’m astonished at the size of audiences I’m getting now. I never thought that this music would be accepted in the way it’s being accepted. I had my first performance with the New York Philharmonic when I was 80 years old. I mean, come on! I think it’s partly that I’ve been helped by a younger generation that has very broad ideas and taste, and I don’t seem nearly as strange as I used to be. I’ve become — not mainstream, that seems a little too far — but still I can tell from the Ascap [the music licensing agency] reports that the music is being used. ADAMS A central thing about Philip’s music is it is utterly original, it is immediately identifiable as his, and that is an extraordinary thing, and it’s actually a very rare thing. It’s such an astonishing thing that Philip did, which was to take very, very simple materials and a simple mode of expression, and create something that was original. And it just caught on in an immensely popular way. It’s an honor to be a part of it. GLASS I have to publicly apologize for getting you the score so late. ADAMS [Laughing] It’s O.K.; we all do it. "
5c44bc753a125f5075c05659,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/20/arts/music/review-esa-pekka-salonen-san-francisco.html,"SAN FRANCISCO — After leading his first concert as the San Francisco Symphony’s next music director here on Friday, Esa-Pekka Salonen said he had some advice for young conductors. His feet wrapped in impossibly glossy black leather as he spoke in a talkback interview on stage, he almost audibly winced: “Don’t conduct a concert in new shoes.” Even a veteran like Mr. Salonen, 60, couldn’t resist dressing up for the first day of school. The announcement last month that he would be this ensemble’s next conductor has been the talk of the music world, both because Mr. Salonen is one of the field’s only universally admired figures and because no one thought that he was in the market for a new job. Indeed, leaving in 2009 after 17 years as music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, he kept wriggling out when orchestras approached him, saying he wanted time to compose. I and many others hoped he would succeed Alan Gilbert at the New York Philharmonic a couple of years ago; it didn’t pan out. What did, and do, we see in him? Both a steward of music’s traditions and an explorer of the future. A vibrant interpreter of the music of others and a creator of his own. An artist who can star more than plausibly in an Apple commercial without seeming a sellout — one who’s thoughtful, even analytical, without ever seeming to try too hard. Almost no one else in classical music so completely satisfies our polarized demands for old and new, innovation and tradition, head and heart. As Mr. Salonen prepared to leave Los Angeles, Alex Ross wrote in The New Yorker that he’d become “a fixed point of cerebral cool in a city of spectacle and flux.” But if his persona has a certain wry distance to it, there is heat in his presence on the podium, and in his effect on orchestras. His connection to the San Francisco Symphony seemed close, confident and charged on Friday, just his fourth time leading the ensemble. (Classical marriages can be shotgun.) If his feet were bothering him, there was no betraying it in the music-making. That he was able to come here for a visit so soon after the announcement last month was happenstance. This weekend of concerts at Davies Symphony Hall was supposed to be conducted by Mirga Grazinyte-Tyla, who has canceled a spread of dates this season (including her debut with the New York Philharmonic) after giving birth in August. Mr. Salonen, who happened to be free, kept the second half of her program — Sibelius’s “Four Legends from the Kalevala” — and preceded it with Anna Thorvaldsdottir’s “Metacosmos” and Strauss’s “Also Sprach Zarathustra.” The message was clear: No soloist; no concerto (Ms. Grazinyte-Tyla was to have conducted the pianist Gabriela Montero in Tchaikovsky’s First); just the orchestra and its next leader. The results had polish and energy. Michael Tilson Thomas, stepping down as music director here after 25 years, has built an ensemble that plays with clean, versatile shine. (It can feel, in its agreeably open versatility, not so far from the Los Angeles Philharmonic.) The San Francisco string sound, in particular, is glistening yet full-bodied, never hysterical but with a lovely glitter to the tone. Russ deLuna played the crucial English horn solo in Sibelius’s “Swan of Tuonela” movement with self-effacing eloquence. Indeed, solos throughout the concert were alert yet unshowy, always with a sense that the big picture was more important than stealing a star moment. Mr. Salonen conducted the premiere of “Metacosmos” in April with the New York Philharmonic, and it makes a clever companion to “Also Sprach Zarathustra.” Both begin with the same low growl — though, as Ms. Thorvaldsdottir’s orchestra begins to rouse itself into a Strauss-style fanfare, it dolefully falls apart. This cycle of expansion and collapse defines the piece; lush, even cinematic gestures are pulled at by sickly downward moans. This was a powerful, logical “Zarathustra,” lithe and bombast-avoidant in a thrillingly controlled opening and airy in the lilting passages later on. Mr. Salonen’s Sibelius was lean and fevered. This isn’t an orchestra that does spectacular soft atmosphere, but moments like the stillness of the second movement, “Lemminkäinen in Tuonela,” when the barest shiver of violins is frosted by the barest shiver of rat-a-tat drum, were finely controlled. It was a performance not of effects or jarring contrasts, but of sustained force and focus. The classical field is now waiting to see what Mr. Salonen will do in his career’s full maturity. He has announced a benevolent little think-tank army of artists who will be helping him, including Nico Muhly, Esperanza Spalding and Julia Bullock, and their plans will germinate through next year, as the orchestra turns to celebrating Mr. Thomas’s final season. There is room for a refresh here. Mr. Thomas gained a reputation for fostering overlooked 20th-century American works, but on the calendar in Friday’s playbill, listing the orchestra’s programs through March 9, there’s a whole lot of Beethoven, Schumann, Mendelssohn and Mozart, as there is throughout the country. Mr. Salonen’s innovations shouldn’t stop at concert programming. My hope is that he manages, as no one really has, to do even more with the American orchestra than smart repertory selections and commissions — that he makes it a clearinghouse of cultural and intellectual activities that extends beyond just music. As the loud reception for him on Friday shows, he has the audience behind him on this new adventure. "
5c82b4d349f0eacbf105c1b3,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/arts/music/piano-concertos-thomas-ades-john-adams.html,"The attention of classical music in America on Thursday was divided between the opposite coasts. By coincidence, new piano concertos by two of the most important composers of our time had their premieres: Thomas Adès’s in Boston and John Adams’s in Los Angeles. [Read more about the dueling premieres.] There is a deep and rich tradition in the meeting between a solo pianist and a symphony orchestra. The results can be thunderous battle, delicate sympathy, genial play — sometimes all in the same piece. Mr. Adès, 48, and Mr. Adams, 72 — both with strongly individual voices, both keenly aware of what’s come before — are ideally suited to take on this looming history, and to contribute to it. David Allen, on the East Coast, and Zachary Woolfe, in the West, heard the results. BOSTON — Mr. Adès has written a piano concerto before, but not a Piano Concerto. Aside from a brief “Concerto Conciso” (1997) for piano and chamber ensemble, his main foray in the genre to this point has been “In Seven Days” (2008), a depiction of the Creation in seven movements, with optional video installation. His new and quite wonderful Concerto for Piano and Orchestra, which Kirill Gerstein played on Thursday with the composer leading the Boston Symphony Orchestra, is different. As Mr. Adès has put it, it’s a “proper piano concerto,” along the lines of Mozart or Bartok. It has no title. It has whistle-worthy themes. It has three movements, fast-slow-fast, marked only by their tempos. It has an opening in sonata form, with a first subject, a second subject, a development section, a recapitulation and a cadenza. It has a poignant, melodic second movement. It has a slithering, cascading finale, with a coda that ends with a cadential sequence Beethoven might have been proud of. It’s refreshingly, even radically, normal. Surely it can’t be so? Even if his style is relatively approachable, Thomas Adès still is Thomas Adès, the once-iconoclastic composer of mischievous, sardonic works like “Powder Her Face” (1995), “Totentanz” (2013) and “The Exterminating Angel” (2016). So you might expect me to point to some ironies I heard running as caustic undercurrents, tugging the whole thing down. Perhaps Mr. Adès is actually dismantling the concerto from within? Perhaps he’s offering a blistering, subversive take on what a frankly modern piano concerto can be, as he did more than 20 years ago for the symphony with “Asyla” (1997)? If he is, I didn’t hear it. Instead, Mr. Adès’s 20-minute work comes off as an affectionate, joyous, remarkably uncomplicated tribute to tradition. The writing is labyrinthine, to be sure, but this is a composer so sure of his abilities and influences that there is no sense in this concerto of history as a burden or as something to be thrown off. It is, rather, something to be approached as an equal. And while plenty of composers talk about how they have thought about the tradition when they write a new concerto, few have placed themselves in it with such breathtaking ease as Mr. Adès does here. As ever, the craft is astounding, the orchestration ceaselessly brilliant. The voice is wholly his own — dissonant, offbeat, whiplash, wry — even as it whispers to musics past. Something of the angular, unnerving opening theme bears an uncanny resemblance to the upward, four-note motif that George Gershwin used for the words “I got rhythm.” Something about the slow movement, which pulls at the heart with an open directness that’s unusual in this composer’s music, can be traced to the atmosphere of Beethoven’s Fourth Concerto, its powerful brass and wind chorale answered with placid wonder by the piano, at least at first. There’s a funny wink to hyper-Romantic excess when a glockenspiel tinkles above the fray at the end of the finale. The way a phrase will end, a mood shift, brings Rachmaninoff fluttering into mind. The technical demands are Lisztian and worse. Not that anything seems to daunt  Mr. Gerstein, the pianist who asked for the new work while rehearsing “In Seven Days” in Boston seven years ago. He dispatched this concerto with his customary virtuosity and commitment, but for all his double-octave flash, it was his tender voicing of the cluster chords that halo the melody of the slow movement that lingers in the ears. He played as if the concerto had been a friend for years. These two artists have struck quite the partnership; they play piano duos at Zankel Hall on March 13 and bring the new concerto to Carnegie on March 20. Also on the bill then will be the same pieces performed here in Boston: Liszt’s “Mephisto Waltz No. 1,” given a raunchy if not quite fluent reading, and a loud, bombastic, thrillingly crude take on Tchaikovsky’s Symphony No. 4. Be there. DAVID ALLEN LOS ANGELES — After Yuja Wang had finished playing the premiere of Mr. Adams’s concerto at Walt Disney Concert Hall here, and the applause wouldn’t stop, she returned to the stage for an encore. She played a piece by — who else? — John Adams. Dating back to 1977, “China Gates” is one of his earliest works, a short solo that’s a calm, steady precipitation of eighth notes: sometimes a smiling sunshower, sometimes a melancholy drizzle. Coming right after the new concerto, “Must the Devil Have All the Good Tunes?,” it gave a moving summary of how far Mr. Adams has come over 40 years, in musical complexity and emotional nuance. And also how much his preoccupations of those long-ago days — tension between rhythmic regularity and tremors of instability; simultaneous propulsion and reflection — still interest him today. Given its premiere by Gustavo Dudamel and the Los Angeles Philharmonic, which will tour it widely, “Must the Devil” is an uneasy experience: restless — indeed, relentless — but uncertain, pensive even when it’s peppy. Written during a period in which Mr. Adams also made a new opera, “Girls of the Golden West,” about the dark side of the California Gold Rush, the concerto comes across as a companion work. Another gloomy, even bitter, study in Americana, its most distinctive bit of orchestration is a part for honky-tonk piano (ideally a detuned upright, but on Thursday conjured electronically, and far too weakly) that evokes the saloons — and, implicitly, the chauvinistic illusions — of Hollywood westerns, while coming across as a devilish shadow of the “real” solo piano. In three parts, played as a single movement of not quite half an hour, “Must the Devil” begins in a sudden surge and chugs along industriously but with stumbles — a machine that fails to find its groove. The music builds in intricacy but remains oddly reticent, with unsettling snaps and buzzes (“gritty, funky, but in strict tempo,” Mr. Adams indicates for this first section) from the double basses and an electric bass, located on opposite sides of the orchestra. Relaxing into the second part with a lulling motif for bassoon and strings — you might think of Ravel — “Must the Devil” troubles the piano’s serenity with a sustained low tremble in the basses, and a disturbing plunk of honky-tonk. There’s early Adams (and the process Minimalism that preceded him) in the melodic thread forming in repeated fits and starts, trying to emerge and complete itself. In passages, the soloist seems to be trying out a kind of rag, but while the rhythm has a gentle, low-slung swing, the piano never finds its footing. The orchestra gently eggs the soloist on into the third section, inaugurated with frosty Adamsian fragments of trumpet fanfare. But there’s little sense of the triumph — or, at least, the reveling in extravagance and difficulty — of earlier finales by this composer. I found this conclusion much like the rest of the piece: anxious, fascinating, sad. The ending comes all at once: The hubbub suddenly drops away, leaving a single toll of a bell. Has someone died? Something? A culture? A country? Ms. Wang was an unfailing, cool to the touch, detailed soloist. Each note, even in a fast run, was precisely considered: a slippery smooth note followed by a diamond-hard one. The almost ominously immaculate quality of her playing was well suited to Mr. Adams’s dark fantasia, which offers virtuosity while staying — intentionally, I think — wary of its, and any, thrills. (There’s tellingly no cadenza to speak of.) After intermission, Mr. Dudamel’s interpretation of Mahler’s First Symphony recalled aspects of “Must the Devil”: the off-kilter quality and troubled lyricism of the first movement, the ruefully swirling third. But, in its straightforward — even bland — healthy-mindedness, this Mahler more than anything acted as a kind of peace offering after Mr. Adams’s beautifully disconcerting concerto. ZACHARY WOOLFE "
5c87eeb349f0eacbf105cab3,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/12/arts/music/review-esa-pekka-salonen-philharmonia-orchestra.html,"The Philharmonia Orchestra of London paid a visit to New York on Sunday and Monday with the conductor Esa-Pekka Salonen, and all I want to talk about is its sound. But if I had to name the standout moment that’s stayed with me from their two concerts at David Geffen Hall, it would be a brief pause that was filled to bursting with tension. It happened twice, actually, in the finale of a glittering performance on Sunday afternoon of Bruckner’s Symphony No. 7, where the composer writes in a short silence before a fortissimo onslaught. Both times, the hall filled with a mighty unison inhalation, a collective gulp of oxygen and nerve as powerful as that of an Olympic swimmer coming up for air in the butterfly. [See Mr. Salonen’s thoughts on the modern orchestra.] With good orchestras, you can sense the mental energy of 90-odd players bundled into one force. What I actually heard in those brief rests in the Bruckner were probably only the brass players reloading for the next big blow — but that breath was so dramatic as to seem to truly unify this massive ensemble. The Philharmonia under Mr. Salonen is a wondrous creature to behold. Painfully good, from the perspective of New Yorkers who had hoped that he would take over the leadership of the New York Philharmonic from Alan Gilbert. Their disappointment was softened only by reports that Mr. Salonen simply wasn’t in the market, wanting more time to compose. Then came the news in December that he is to become the next music director of the San Francisco Symphony. Mr. Salonen has worked with the Philharmonia Orchestra for over three decades. In that time, he has helped shape a sound that is stunningly muscular, smooth and cohesive. Those fortissimo salvos in the Bruckner had power but also a high-gloss polish — especially across the brass section, where individual colors were alloyed together, with just the gleaming trumpets sailing on top. These players know how to form impromptu combinations when the music requires it, as when the cellos and horns made a hybrid of oaky mellowness in the first movement of the Bruckner. Mr. Salonen’s obsessive attention to sound also found expression in two unusual placements: the one designed for greater blend, the other for disruption. In the Bruckner, the orchestra’s tuba player repositioned himself between movements. He joined the horns and Wagner tubas in the Adagio — their joint sound taking on a gnomish melancholy — before returning to his regular spot next to the trombones for the heavy lifting in the fortissimos of the final two movements. In Monday’s performance of Stravinsky’s “The Firebird,” a single trumpeter took up position in a balcony of the auditorium, startling listeners with notes of anarchic exuberance. Both Bruckner’s symphony and “The Firebird” require a careful marshaling of forces so that the climactic moments late in the game really soar. The composers’ approaches couldn’t be more different: In his sprawling, methodical works, Bruckner seeks the sublime within the strict confines of protocol. Stravinsky breaks rules; he questions and quarrels, and yet finds a consensus that tips into transcendence. Mr. Salonen found the balance between discipline and freedom in both works. That same balance informs Mr. Salonen’s own charismatic Cello Concerto, which here had an eloquent soloist in Truls Mork. Ever in pursuit of unusual sound constellations, Mr. Salonen shapes the final movement as a riveting contest of will between the solo cello and a percussionist stationed at a set of bongos and congas at the front of the orchestra. Besides the visual appeal — a blur of hands on skin and bow on string — the unlikely pairing makes you hear the rhythmic capability of the cello and the vocal quality of the drums. The concerto’s first two movements are a fascinating study in density and translucence, with sounds morphing from silvery and wan to red-blooded and impassioned. Orchestral textures that start off as a hollow whistle gather force like a storm that buffets the solo cello. The conclusion, after the kinetic fireworks of cello and drums have burned themselves out, sends slivers of electronically processed cello harmonics ricocheting around the auditorium like the distant keening of gulls.

5c76bff849f0eacbf105a75e,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/27/arts/music/review-carnegie-hall-jason-hardink.html,"Most pianists begin a recital with a piece that allows them to warm up a little, and gives the audience a chance to settle in. Not Jason Hardink. He began his concert on Tuesday at Weill Recital Hall with Jason Eckardt’s “Echoes’ White Veil,” a dizzying, manic 12-minute work of almost stupefying difficulty. There is just a hint of hesitancy at the start, with percussively repeated notes and sputtered trills. Then the music takes off — and how, with frenzied runs in each hand crisscrossing like strands of unhinged counterpoint, bursts of pummeling cluster chords leaping the length of the keyboard, and more. Some passages hint of avant-garde jazz, like an audacious Cecil Taylor improvisation, but with flintier modernist madness. This 1996 piece has become a calling card for Mr. Hardink, who played Mr. Eckardt’s score not just with command, but with abandon and remarkable clarity. Mr. Hardink’s daunting selections reflected, he wrote in a program note, his interest in large-scale works from all eras that “lie at the limit of feasibility.” Last year he ran the Wasatch Front 100 Mile Endurance Test in Utah, and this recital was a pianistic endurance test. There was a bit of relief when, after the Eckardt, he shifted the mood to play Book Two of Debussy’s “Images.” I wanted a little more nuance and milky sonorities in “Cloches à Travers les Feuilles.” But he brought welcome lucidity and rhythmic crispness to the music, especially the splashing murmurs and darting runs of “Poissons d’Or.” With Xenaxis’s “Evryali” (1973), Mr. Hardink was back in testing-the-limits mode with a work that explores extremes of expression. There are constant shifts from obsessively repeated notes and chords, to wildly skittish bursts, to rhythmic episodes that almost — but never quite — slip into a marching groove. Yet somehow the piece comes across as a complete entity, as least as played here with such bright sound and stamina. Liszt was a pioneer in pushing the bounds of what’s possible at the piano, especially in his Transcendental Études. Mr. Hardink played four of these. Other pianists have made these fiercely virtuosic pieces sound more rhapsodic and poetic. But Mr. Hardink dispatched them deftly. He ended with crystalline accounts of four pieces from Messiaen’s monumental cycle “Vingt Regards sur l’Enfant-Jésus.” Mr. Hardink’s capacity for tenderness and grace came through in the ruminative, harmonically tart passages of these cosmic pieces. But, no surprise, he was at his best in the vehement dance “Regard de l’Esprit de Joie,” in which he captured spiritual ecstasy as, to quote Messiaen’s description, “a drunkenness, in the most extravagant sense.” Even Mr. Hardink may have his limits: He played no encores. But what could follow such a program? "
5c6da7843a125f5075c0aa5d,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/20/arts/music/gary-clark-jr-this-land-review.html,"Gary Clark Jr. was born in the wrong era. In the 1960s or ’70s, he could easily have forged a career as a first-rank guitar hero: a Texan blues-rocker who can step on any stage and bring the place down with a searing guitar solo. Prospects are different in the 21st century. The idea of a guitar hero was thoroughly undermined by punk and then pushed aside by increasingly computerized pop, dance music and hip-hop. For decades, vintage-style blues and the flesh-on-strings virtuosity it requires have been shunted toward nostalgia, preservationism and the die-hard realms of Americana. In 2019, Clark is an exceedingly rare figure, a bluesman who has a major-label recording contract and a worldwide audience, one he has built by tearing up stage after stage, show after show. While his songwriting has lagged behind his performing, he’s well aware of his strengths; he has alternated studio albums with live ones. [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] On “This Land,” his third major-label studio album, his songwriting has caught up with his playing. It has something to do with experience; now 35, Clark has been performing since his teens. It has something to do with the power of contrariness: that is, Clark’s determination to deliver the raw, analog, spontaneous opposite of crisply quantized digital content. And it has a lot to do with America in 2019, where division, frustration and seething anger can use an outlet with the historical resonance and emotional depth of the blues. The title song of “This Land,” which also opens the album, has the singer settling in on his new 50-acre ranch “in the middle of Trump country,” facing hostile, racist neighbors who want him to “go back where you came from.” He snarls right back: “I’m America’s son. This is where I come from.” The music isn’t typical blues. It’s a reggae vamp pumped up to rock volume, with blues licks spiraling between the vocal lines. Clark claims what he has earned: righteous, defensive and stand-your-ground belligerent. The sound of the album conjures the impact of Clark’s live band. It’s dense, sweaty, overdriven, bristling and unkempt, full of live-wire loose ends. It’s also, in most songs, a studio illusion. Clark produced the album along with Jacob Sciba, his engineer turned co-producer. And the credits of most songs reveal that Clark not only sings and plays guitar, as he does onstage, but also supplies keyboards and programming, abetted by a drummer and a bassist. His songwriting dips into funk, R&B, reggae, metal, arena-rock and hip-hop, and he often embeds song samples and drum-machine sounds in his mixes. Clark hasn’t tried to dwell in any purist blues past. He doesn’t hide his musical models. He harks back to foot-stomping country blues in “The Governor,” a sardonic take on the justice system, and in the lovelorn “Dirty Dishes Blues,” proving his command of blues essentials. He forges direct links from the Ramones to Chuck Berry to the Rolling Stones in “Gotta Get Into Something,” a burst of insomniac adrenaline. His falsetto vocals in “Feed the Babies” and “Pearl Cadillac” echo Curtis Mayfield and Prince, as he sings about parental responsibility and about his own gratitude to his mother. “I Got My Eyes on You” emerges from a roiling caldron of organ and guitar, like early Santana, to pledge unswerving love. And “Feelin’ like a Million,” which follows its opening lines — “Friday night and I just got paid/I’m out looking for some trouble” — toward an ill-advised fling, turbocharges a reggae beat with stabs of distorted guitar and flickers of trap high-hats. Yet each stylistic choice draws on the spirit of the blues: its strength and tribulation, its defiance and self-questioning, its cantankerousness and pain. “Don’t Wait Til Tomorrow” is a remorseful R&B ballad: a denial of infidelity that leads to a confession and a plea to stay together that comes to realize it’s too late. Latin percussion and a string arrangement pull it back toward the 1970s; power chords reinforce its desperate chorus, and Clark plays only a brief, unflashy guitar solo, a futile appeal. The track is at once classic and contemporary; it’s laced with a pitched-up sample of the words “Baby please!” That sample, however, comes from the Mississippi bluesman Elmore James. It’s one more way Clark insists that the past has everything to do with the present. "
5c51d1103a125f5075c07206,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/30/arts/music/carnegie-hall-beethoven.html,"What do you get the composer who has everything? More everything. Beethoven hardly lacks for exposure, but to mark the 250th anniversary of his birth, in 1770, Carnegie Hall announced on Wednesday that it would go all in, and devote roughly a fifth of its 2019-20 season to his music. All his piano sonatas. All his string quartets. Lots of his chamber music. And not one but two cycles of all nine symphonies: one performed on period instruments, with John Eliot Gardiner conducting the Orchestre Révolutionnaire et Romantique, and another on modern instruments, with Yannick Nézet-Séguin and the Philadelphia Orchestra. “We all feel this is really the pivotal figure in the history of Western classical music,” Clive Gillinson, Carnegie’s executive and artistic director, said in an interview. “Everything he touched, he changed and transformed.” Mr. Nézet-Séguin, who became music director of the Metropolitan Opera this season, will be the subject of a Perspectives series that will give New Yorkers a chance to hear him conduct all three of his ensembles: the Philadelphians, the Met Orchestra and the Orchestre Métropolitain of Montreal. The mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato, the singer-songwriter Angélique Kidjo and Mr. Gardiner will also have Perspectives series, and Jörg Widmann will hold the Richard and Barbara Debs Composer’s Chair. There’s a lot to chew on in the season, which will open Oct. 3 with Franz Welser-Möst conducting the Cleveland Orchestra, and will end June 21 with Daniel Barenboim and the Vienna Philharmonic. So here is a tip sheet, with critics and writers for The New York Times highlighting some of the concerts that intrigue them next season. MUNICH PHILHARMONIC (OCT. 25-26) AND BAVARIAN RADIO SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (NOV. 8-9) ORCHESTRE MÉTROPOLITAIN (NOV. 22) AND ORCHESTRE SYMPHONIQUE DE MONTRÉAL (MARCH 24) The season brings a couple of battle-of-the-bands moments. Most halls would be happy to import a single orchestra from Munich or Montreal, but Carnegie is bringing a pair from each city. So New York audiences will be able to contrast performances of Valery Gergiev conducting the Munich Philharmonic with those of Mariss Jansons leading its neighboring Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra. And they will be able to compare the Orchestre Symphonique de Montréal, under the baton of Kent Nagano, with that city’s lesser-known ensemble, the Orchestre Métropolitain. MICHAEL COOPER AMERICAN COMPOSERS ORCHESTRA, NOV. 13 This ensemble’s reliably excellent taste results in a program that features new orchestrations of Ives songs by Hilary Purrington and Hannah Lash, as well as the premiere of a guitar concerto by Ms. Purrington. Her recent “A Clarion Call” is packed with haunted harmonies and riotous humor that Ives might well have admired. SETH COLTER WALLS IRISH CHAMBER ORCHESTRA, NOV. 19 Unique synergies often develop when an orchestra is led by a composer-performer. In his collaboration with the Irish Chamber Orchestra, Jörg Widmann, as conductor and solo clarinetist, serves up a meticulously balanced program with compositions that showcase his debt to Bach (“Versuch über die Fuge”) and rock (“180 beats per minute”) alongside works by Mendelssohn, Weber and Mozart’s own Bach-flavored Adagio and Fugue in C minor. CORINNA da FONSECA-WOLLHEIM CONRAD TAO, NOV. 20 KIRILL GERSTEIN, FEB. 20 IGOR LEVIT, MAY 5 A great way to refresh repertory staples is to perform them alongside new and recent works. The brilliant young pianist and composer Conrad Tao offers a particularly bold example of this approach in his solo recital at Weill Recital Hall, which fascinatingly juxtaposes the old (Bach, Rachmaninoff, Schumann) and the new (David Lang, Julia Wolfe, Jason Eckardt). At Zankel Hall, the formidable Kirill Gerstein will play unusual works by Liszt, Brahms and Gyorgy Kurtag steeped in Hungarian dances and folk song, as well as pieces by Haydn, Busoni, Bartok (the flinty, seldom-heard Piano Sonata), Thomas Adès and, to end, Schubert’s exuberant “Wanderer” Fantasy. Igor Levit will join Carnegie’s Beethoven salute in Stern Auditorium with Sonatas No. 9, 10 and 11, and the still-astounding “Hammerklavier.” ANTHONY TOMMASINI SO PERCUSSION, DEC. 7 The program for this virtuosic and often mind-opening quartet, “A Century of Percussion,” is something of a greatest hits concert. They will revisit pieces like David Lang’s “the so-called laws of nature,” Steve Reich’s “Music for Pieces of Wood” and John Cage’s “Third Construction.” But the evening will also include the local premiere of a new work by Julia Wolfe. JOSHUA BARONE ORCHESTRE RÉVOLUTIONNAIRE ET ROMANTIQUE, FEB. 19-24 There is hardly a shortage of recordings of Beethoven’s symphonies, but the one I inevitably turn to is John Eliot Gardiner’s vigorous, colorful, altogether vital cycle with this period-instrument ensemble. After a pair of crack Berlioz performances at Carnegie this past fall, this team is surely ready to put the old Ludwig van through his paces. ZACHARY WOOLFE THE CROSSING, MARCH 25 Such is their radiant sound and the vibrancy of the repertory they’ve cultivated, it’s gotten to the point I’d hear anything this Philadelphia vocal ensemble sings. At Carnegie they’ll join the cellist Maya Beiser, whose charismatic cross-genre experiments have seductive savvy, in the New York premiere of Michael Gordon’s “Travel Guide to Nicaragua.” ZACHARY WOOLFE BOSTON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA, APRIL 15 After presenting Act II of Wagner’s “Tristan und Isolde” at Carnegie last spring, the Bostonians will be back, under the baton of Andris Nelsons, for Act III. These two concerts are a test drive for the tenor Jonas Kaufmann, who has been gradually rolling out his Tristan. (Other cast members include Emily Magee as Isolde and Günther Groissböck as King Marke.) JOSHUA BARONE QUATUOR ÉBÈNE, APRIL 17-MAY 2 Even outside of anniversary years, cycles of the Beethoven string quartets mushroom all over the concert landscape. But this French ensemble, known for its passionate and rigorous playing, is sure to bring something special to its six-concert survey in the spring. Do stick around for the encores, which these players use to shoot off in unexpected directions with improvised takes on folk music, jazz or the Beatles. CORINNA da FONSECA-WOLLHEIM TIMO ANDRES, APRIL 29 Aaron Copland’s mid-20th-century Piano Sonata is the oldest work you’ll find in this solo recital, which features a wide range of pieces by contemporary composers like John Adams, Donnacha Dennehy and Frederic Rzewski — and, of course, Mr. Andres himself. Later in the evening is a premiere from the young composer Gabriella Smith. JOSHUA BARONE MAURIZIO POLLINI, MAY 17 There’s enough Beethoven this season to last a lifetime, but it’s a lifetime of Beethoven that Mr. Pollini, 78 years young, will bring to this performance of the final three piano sonatas. There’s no artist I’d rather hear play this music. DAVID ALLEN VIENNA PHILHARMONIC, JUNE 19-21 Poor Mahler, with just six performances of his symphonies next season at Carnegie. I wouldn’t want to miss Michael Tilson Thomas conducting the Sixth in his farewell performance at the hall before stepping down as music director of the San Francisco Symphony (March 18), but Daniel Barenboim has a peculiar, productive way with these scores that makes these concerts more promising than the norm. He leads the Fifth, Seventh and Ninth. DAVID ALLEN "

5ca6d32249f0eacbf1f810c6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/05/arts/music/sugar-hill-brooklyn-eddie-freeman.html,"In early March, the techno and house-music collective Sublimate posted a listing for its latest all-night event, featuring D.J.s from Detroit and London at an unnamed “historic Bed-Stuy locale.” To some Brooklyn night-life devotees, however, the cryptic venue was obvious: Sugar Hill Restaurant & Supper Club. In the past year alone, Sugar Hill, in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn, has hosted two tapings of Boiler Room — a streaming platform that broadcasts D.J. sets around the world — as well as underground parties about every other week, many of which go until sunrise. And although the club’s owner, Eddie Freeman, who opened it in 1979, couldn’t recall the word “techno” and wished event producers wouldn’t keep the lights so low, he has always shared their love of night life. Freeman, born outside of Kinston, N.C., said that he left for New York in 1957 on a Trailways bus with $40 and a box of chicken. The son of sharecroppers, he left behind a segregated rural community. White-owned businesses occupied one side of Kinston’s Main Street. Across the road, black-owned restaurants, grocery stores and nightclubs thrived in a section called Sugar Hill. “Down at Sugar Hill was where everybody hung out,” Freeman said. Settling in Bedford-Stuyvesant, he found work, first at factories and driving gypsy cabs, then at the post office with a burglar-alarm business on the side. Using his retirement savings, he purchased a building on DeKalb Avenue and opened a discothèque. Nostalgic for the clubs back home, he named it Sugar Hill. Now 78, Freeman shares the day-to-day responsibilities of the nightclub with his two children, Aaron and Akesha, who inherited his enthusiasm for the space. For Aaron, only 14 on opening night, the club felt like a second home. Sugar Hill “was his dream,” Aaron said of his father, “and just to see it finally coming to fruition, me being the son, I felt like it was my dream as well.” Aaron recalled bringing guests’ coats up to their family apartment in an adjacent building in the club’s early days. “We didn’t even have a coat rack back then,” he said. “I ran upstairs to my dad’s second-floor bedroom.” [Don’t miss an event: Read The Times’s Culture Calendar.] At first, the D.J.s played “nothing but disco,” according to Eddie Freeman. But over the years, Sugar Hill diversified its offerings, featuring R&B stars like Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes and the house-music pioneer Colonel Abrams. On the weekends, Aaron, then studying at Farmingdale State College, came home to run Sugar Hill while his father worked night shifts at the post office. But by the mid-80s, the club grew lucrative enough for Freeman to leave that job to manage Sugar Hill full time. As it grew, including the addition of a restaurant in 1994, Sugar Hill garnered a reputation as a community gathering place and served as a meeting point for national political figures, including Jesse Jackson and Hillary Clinton. Civic involvement was important to Freeman from the outset. “He wanted to be in the meetings,” Akesha said. “He wanted to be a part of the fabric of the community.” And Freeman and his children are intent on keeping Sugar Hill a family affair. At one point, Freeman said, he was offered $15 million to sell the property, which he turned down: “What would I do with $15 million?” A vacation, perhaps? “I don’t need to travel,” Freeman said. “I’m living in the greatest city in the world.” Now in its 40th year, Sugar Hill has remained an institution in Bedford-Stuyvesant, even as the neighborhood undergoes rapid gentrification. “When we first opened, it was the ’hood,” Aaron put it bluntly. “If you saw a white person in the neighborhood, you would be shocked.” The influx of new residents has brought an unmistakable change to the club’s clientele. “Now, you see a line around the corner, and it’s like 700 white people standing outside waiting to get into Sugar Hill,” Aaron said. Eddie has a sense of humor about these new crowds — throngs of young transplants that pack the club on weekends to dance until the early morning hours. “On certain nights we rent it out to the hipsters,” he said. (Glancing at my wire-rimmed glasses, he added, “I guess you know what hipsters are.”) “I wouldn’t necessarily say that it’s inaccurate,” Zack Kerns said. Kerns, a co-founder of the annual electronic music “mini-festival” Fourth World, hosted an 18-hour party at Sugar Hill last summer after another space fell through at the last minute. For Richard Gamble, Kerns’s business partner, the club was emblematic of their New York-centric gathering. “It’s a testament to have been in New York for that long doing what they do,” he said. “I felt like it was the best face we could possibly put forward for our community to have it there.” Akesha agreed that for some younger partygoers, the attraction to Sugar Hill is in its history: “They like a story. They call it ‘original Brooklyn.’” Tajh Morris, who regularly hosts Sublimate events at Sugar Hill, views the club’s history through a more personal lens. “I kind of grew up in a similar environment,” he said. “My family owns a jazz club in Harlem from about the same time.” His family’s venue, the Cotton Club (no relation to the famed Prohibition-era nightclub), also has undergone programming shifts since its opening in 1977, at one point adding hip-hop to its jazz-heavy lineup to meet the changes in pop culture. But for the Sublimate co-founder Matthew Sagotsky, hosting the party at Sugar Hill is as much a legal necessity as a cultural choice. “Brooklyn has seen an incredible shrinking of alternative spaces to club,” he said. Five years ago, “everyone was doing underground warehouse parties. And those warehouse parties were not legal. Sugar Hill is a legal event space, and it is above board, but you still get to, as an event producer, come in and provide all the elements of a D.I.Y. party, which is what I find really special.” Morris agreed: “A lot of our parties that are at actual warehouses or lofts or things like that, maybe there’s not adequate plumbing or the whole thing isn’t up to code.” At Sugar Hill, he said, “everything’s good.” At Sublimate’s party on a recent Friday night, just hours after a funeral reception had been held in the same space, Sugar Hill’s backyard was filled with young people wearing fitted beanies and puffing on Juul e-cigarettes — hipsters, by Freeman’s definition. Though Freeman was absent from the affair (“too much fog,” he said), the spirit of Sugar Hill was palpable on the crowded dance floor. In between sparse techno tracks, the D.J. played a remix of Kleeer’s “Keeep Your Body Workin’,” a disco hit that peaked on the charts in 1979, when Sugar Hill first opened its doors. For Freeman, one thing has remained consistent throughout all of the renovations and changes in clientele: “The music makes you want to dance.” "
5cb0abd149f0eacbf1f83628,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/12/arts/music/new-york-philharmonic-mahler-review.html,"Mahler’s Sixth Symphony is difficult for conductors even on their best days. So you can imagine the pressure on Simone Young, who, after not appearing with the New York Philharmonic since 1998, stepped in on short notice to replace the orchestra’s injured music director, Jaap van Zweden, on Thursday evening at David Geffen Hall. (The maestro will be fine but was ordered to rest after burning his shoulder with an ice pack last week.) Thursday’s imperfect but respectable concert, which featured only the 90-minute symphony, would have been opportunity to hear how Mr. van Zweden, still at the start of his directorship, is shaping the Philharmonic’s Mahler sound, typically a specialty of this orchestra. Instead, the evening ended up being a preview of Ms. Young’s scheduled return next season, when she will lead a program of Britten, Elgar and her Australian compatriot Brett Dean. Mahler, however, might be the better composer to hear Ms. Young conduct, given what she is known for in her long-established career at opera houses and concert halls abroad. She is leading Wagner at the Bavarian State Opera next month, with Strauss coming soon after in Zurich. Her discography includes a lot of Bruckner and, yes, Mahler. It may be that Ms. Young’s opera work informed her approach to the Sixth Symphony, which on Thursday was worthy of its onetime subtitle, “Tragic.” Dealing in shocking extremes — sometimes within a measure or even within a single beat — she exploited the work’s dramatic threads: the opening’s journey from a minor-key march to a major-key victory, followed by inner movements both demented and pastoral and, in the 30-minute finale, a struggle that ends in defeat. Is this a symphony with a narrative program, per se? Not explicitly, unlike Mahler’s earlier ones. But the Sixth is so fraught with historical and interpretive inconsistency that a persuasive conductor could make a case either way. Conductors must also come to the symphony ready to take a stance on the problems that have surrounded it since its premiere in 1906, many created by Mahler’s wife, Alma, whose apocryphal tales set serious scholarship back decades. Is that second theme in the opening movement really a portrait of Alma? Is the hero of the finale Mahler himself, felled by three fateful hammer blows? (Or is it two?) Of the inner movements, which comes first, the Scherzo or the Andante? Does it even matter? It did matter on Thursday. Kind of. The Philharmonic opted for the Scherzo first, which in the context of Ms. Young’s interpretation made the joyous ending of the first movement all the more pathetic by plunging immediately back into a minor key. Saving the Andante for later, however, did leave the symphony sagging after about 45 minutes. This section seemed the least rehearsed, with a wobbly start and an unusually cold distance that never warmed. It may improve by Saturday’s concert, along with sound imbalances in the brasses and, in the balcony, cowbells that were more distractingly present than pleasantly distant. The Philharmonic players did regroup for a calamitous finale; each strike of the hammer was a heart-stopping jolt. When the third blow lands — and yes, there were three on Thursday — the symphony takes a woeful turn. You could read this as a hero’s tragedy, or as a metaphor for Mahler’s life. But don’t for a moment see it as representative of Ms. Young’s conducting, which, against the odds, was valiant to the end. "

Messages of inspiration and hope prevailed at a colorful and uplifting Grammy Awards on Sunday, defying expectations that the event would be drab. The stars also all but steered clear of any political messages. The host, Alicia Keys, set the positive tone by telling personal stories and speaking often of peace and love. And she lead the event with an all-star moment of female solidarity, which included a surprise appearance by Michelle Obama, who said that music “has always helped me tell my story,” and “allows us to hear one another, to invite each other in.” [Here’s the full list of Grammys winners.] Obama wasn’t the only unexpected attendee with a message of empowerment. Drake, one of the most nominated artists this year, with seven nods and one win, showed up to accept the award for best rap song for his smash “God’s Plan.” Drake, who has skipped the Grammys in recent years and turned down an offer to perform at this year’s show, used his time on stage to speak to other artists and to children who aspire to music fame. His message: That awards like the Grammys are not a measure of success in the music industry. “We’re playing in an opinion-based sport, not a factual-based sport,” he said, explaining that music is a business where powerful people who don’t necessarily understand artists’ experiences are often making the decisions. “The point is you’ve already won if you have people who are singing your songs word for word, if you’re a hero in your hometown, if — look, look — if there’s people who have regular jobs who are coming out in the rain, in the snow, spending their hard-earned money to buy tickets to come to your shows, you don’t need this right here, I promise you that, you already won,” he said, holding up his Grammy. Not long after, Diana Ross, in a flowing red gown, celebrated her upcoming 75th birthday with two hits from her solo career: “The Best Years of My Life” and “Reach Out and Touch (Somebody’s Hand).” She punctuated her performance by speaking to the crowd. “So much love in this room,” she said. “Together we have no limits. There’s only success ahead and you can lead the way. Learn, dream, unlock new doors. All is possible.” Earlier in the night, Lady Gaga accepted an award for “Shallow” from “A Star Is Born” and said she was proud to be part of a movie that addresses mental health issues. “A lot of artists deal with that, and we’ve got to take care of each other,” she said, adding, “So if you see somebody that hurting, don’t look away.” And Dua Lipa, winner for best new artist, clapped back at Neil Portnow, the chief executive of the Recording Academy, who said last year that women in music should “step up” to advance their careers. “I guess this year we really stepped up,” Lipa said, accepting her award, referring to the strong showing by women this year. “For anyone that hasn’t realized how special they are to have a different story, a different background, a name that honors their roots because they just want to be normal, whatever the hell that means,” she went on, adding, “never let that get in the way of you and your dreams, because you deserve it.” "
5c7d550249f0eacbf105b421,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/04/arts/music/morrissey-broadway-residency.html,"Morrissey, the celebrated British singer who once fronted the Smiths, is coming to Broadway. He will play a seven-night engagement at the Lunt-Fontanne Theater from May 2-11, becoming the latest high-profile musician to take the Broadway stage since Bruce Springsteen last year. According to a news release on Monday, the shows will serve as a career retrospective for Morrissey, and will come weeks before the release of a new record, “California Son,” an album of covers. Broadway stages have become increasingly friendly to pop music, particularly jukebox musicals featuring songs with already built-in popularity. Cher, Donna Summer, the Go-Go’s and Jimmy Buffett are just some recent examples of artists whose music has been featured recently on Broadway. “Ain’t Too Proud: The Life and Times of the Temptations” will officially open later this month. “Springsteen on Broadway,” a show mixing songs and storytelling, earned an honorary Tony Award and was filmed for a Netflix special. Tickets for the Morrissey shows will go on sale Friday, and many fans will have two hopes: that they will be able to get seats, and that the performances actually happen. The singer has had a penchant for canceling shows on short notice; in late 2017, the music site Consequence of Sound counted more than 120 that he had scrapped or postponed since 2012. (In one particularly infamous example, Morrissey canceled a 2017 performance in Paso Robles, Calif., because it was too cold.) Last year, Morrissey, 59 — whose real name is Steven Patrick Morrissey — postponed European tour dates following inflammatory comments he made in an interview posted on his own website. Multiple quotes from the interview were thought too Islamophobic, including: “Halal slaughter requires certification that can only be given by supporters of ISIS,” and “This is the Mayor of London! And he cannot talk properly!” referring to Sadiq Khan, the city’s first Muslim mayor. Morrissey’s team said at the time that the tour was canceled for “logistical reasons,” but anti-racism protests were being planned to coincide with the singer’s shows in Manchester, where he is from. He has expressed support for right-wing figures in Britain such as Tommy Robinson, the founder of the English Defense League. "
5c7fe0cf49f0eacbf105ba0f,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/06/arts/music/karen-o-danger-mouse-lux-prima.html,"Every great partnership has to begin somewhere. For Karen O and Danger Mouse, it was a drunk dial in 2008. At least, that’s how half of this duo featuring the queen of the aughts rock revival and the versatile Grammy-winning producer remembers it. Karen O drew a blank when Danger Mouse (born Brian Burton) brought it up late last month at Electric Lady Studios in Greenwich Village, where they worked on their new album, “Lux Prima.” “I got this phone call, and you were like, it’s Karen O. I was like, what?” Burton said. His flummoxed collaborator at the other end of the couch slowly recalled what had happened: After years of saying they wanted to work together but only meeting briefly, Karen O had seized the moment. “I get excited about things after a couple of drinks — then I’m like, yeah, I’m going to call him now!” she said. “That’s so me, too,” she added and let out the Karen O cackle, a high, sharp peal of laughter. Sipping tea in an upstairs studio at the storied recording complex, both musicians were in Clark Kent mode, Zen and studious. (To be fair, this is Burton’s forever mode.) Since 2001, Karen O — short for her last name, Orzolek — has been best known as the frontwoman for the trio Yeah Yeah Yeahs, a stage-devouring, beer-spraying punk who can swing a microphone around her head while nailing every note with an ecstatic grin on her face. Burton was a cross-genre producer searching for his niche when “The Grey Album” — his unauthorized mash-up of Jay-Z’s “The Black Album” and the Beatles record known as the White Album — became a cause célèbre (and almost ended his career before it started) in 2004. He went on to form Gnarls Barkley with CeeLo Green; work with Gorillaz, Beck, the Black Keys and U2; and collaborate with James Mercer of the Shins in a group called Broken Bells. [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] They’ve both recently entered their 40s: not old enough to be old, but old enough to question what’s coming next. It’s something that was on their minds as they began their journey into “Lux Prima,” an album of sprawling, soulful, cinematic psych rock filled with astral bass lines, gauzy strings and Karen O-isms like “You’re not coming for me/I’m coming for you.” “I’m on a vision quest of sorts: What does it mean to be a woman artist in her 40s? And how can I lay it down so that’s like, something [expletive] awesome,” Karen O said a few days later at a tony Lower East Side hotel that sprouted up two blocks from the tiny Mercury Lounge, where Yeah Yeah Yeahs played their first show, opening for the White Stripes. “It’s not a paved road, it’s not a well-beaten path,” she added. It’s “find your way through that wilderness and write us a postcard.”  THOUGH THEY MET AROUND 2005, had that fateful phone call in 2008 and ran into each other again in 2012, the Karen O and Danger Mouse project didn’t get moving until 2016, a year after Karen O gave birth to her son, Django. Yeah Yeah Yeahs had last put out an album in 2013 — “Mosquito,” which concluded their contract with Interscope — and the singer followed up with an indie release called “Crush Songs,” a quiet series of meditations on romance she’d written alone in her New York apartment around 2007. She was relishing her newfound freedom. “On the one hand,” she said, “Yeah Yeah Yeahs have had the great fortune of the label not meddling in our process. But there’s expectations for singles and the trajectory that you have to hit.” She added, “Until I was out of that deal, I didn’t realize the subtle psychic weight that I’d been carrying for like a decade.” Nick Zinner, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs guitarist who did a little playing on “Lux Prima,” said the pressures of the band were “something that you can spend a lot of energy trying to not think about,” and he knew this kind of independence was something Karen O “was yearning for.” Karen O compared working with Burton to when she wrote her “psycho opera,” a decidedly noncommercial art project called “Stop the Virgens,” in 2005 (it was staged in Brooklyn and Sydney, Australia, in 2011 and 2012): There were no expectations from the outside and no limits. Before they got started, Burton played her Michael Kiwanuka’s “Cold Little Heart,” the beautiful, shape-shifting 10-minute song that kicks off the London artist’s 2016 album, “Love & Hate,” which he produced, and it struck a nerve. “That’s what made me want to make music when I first heard Pink Floyd in college,” said Burton, who easily switches between his roles as a producer and a musician. “I had always thought music was entertainment, and I didn’t want to be an entertainer, I wanted to be an artist.” He referenced his days in Athens, Ga., when he became immersed in the ’90s psych-rock scene anchored by the Elephant 6 Recording Company. “I was like, people make 15-minute songs? You’re taking yourself out of competition or pop or any of that stuff, you’re just making something. That’s what I want to do.” Karen O chimed in: “That’s what I want to do. After all these years.” So the first thing they did was make a 12-minute song, the lush, groovy “Lux Prima” (it later got a haircut to nine minutes), following Burton’s process: Come in with nothing and make something. They worked five-hour, two-week shifts in Burton’s Los Angeles studio so Karen O could stick to Django’s schedule. (While she defines downtown cool for a generation of New Yorkers, Karen O now lives in L.A., where she doesn’t have to schlep a stroller up subway steps. And Burton, a longtime L.A. resident, has relocated to New York.) Because the “Lux Prima” material was the first original music Karen O had written since giving birth, “I was really wondering what would be streaming out of me after that experience,” she said. “I felt more deeply connected to the cycles of life and like, consciousness. And I had a deep sense of love that was different.” Zinner said he saw his longtime collaborator wrestling with a new set of concerns. “Whatever Karen does, she’s working through something that’s happening with her,” he said, adding there was a “different element” in the mix this time. “Definitely being a mom. And being a woman in the age of Trump.” Burton was struck by Karen O’s process — she writes lyrics in the studio, which they both called torturous. But Karen O likes it because it helps her find an arc for the full album. And the primacy of the album was critical. “There were only a couple of times we were like, ‘Should there be a single in this?’” Karen O said. “There’s plenty of hooks and melodies in the record, but as far as like a single in 2019, what does that sound like, especially in alternative music?” Burton quickly added, “Don’t even try.” The nine tracks on “Lux Prima” unspool grandly, from the ominous lullaby “Ministry” to the stomping girl-group squall of “Woman” to the compact psych-funk groove of “Leopard’s Tongue.” The duo will present the album as a “multisensory art installation” in April at the Marciano Art Foundation in Los Angeles. The event, overseen by the creative director Barnaby Clay (Karen O’s husband), will use lighting, projections and other stimuli to creative an immersive experience — the antidote to the kind of glance-listening that dominates pop’s current era of distraction. Holding people’s attention isn’t easy in 2019. Danger Mouse later shared the advice he gives the young artists on his label, 30th Century Records: “Just have faith that if you’re doing the stuff you want to do, it will be heard at some point.” Dan Auerbach, the Black Keys singer and guitarist, admires Burton’s ability to pull the best from his collaborators. Burton, who has worked on four albums with the band, was the first outside producer the duo let into their world. “I think we just liked how drum-heavy his stuff was, kind of dusty and funky and always so rhythmic,” Auerbach added. “He just has a sixth sense with melody.” Despite having worked with some of the most successful artists in music, including Adele and Red Hot Chili Peppers, Burton’s guiding ethos remains heart over trends. “Usually when I work with somebody I tell them, ‘This is probably going to be your least-selling record, and if we make a couple of accidents that work out, it could be your best-selling record,’” he said. “‘But it’s probably not going to be anywhere in between.’” James Mercer, the Shins leader who teamed with Burton in Broken Bells, said his band was listening to “The Grey Album” backstage in Copenhagen the night Burton showed up unannounced to meet them. “That’s the type of person he is, he’s that brave and gregarious,” Mercer said. “He’s very good at being open to new ideas, so he definitely has stuff he learned from working with U2 and the Chili Peppers.” Mercer wasn’t surprised when Burton joined forces with Karen O, saying they’d listened to Yeah Yeah Yeahs together in the past: “He’s a fan of female singers, and she’s kind of the best.” Burton’s admiration for Karen O is obvious. “She has a voice I believe,” he said. “My whole thing was making sure that one of the coolest chicks in the world likes what we’re doing.”  KAREN O HAS BEEN KNOWN as a rock ’n’ roll badass for so many years that many of the nuances of her personality and art have been blasted away. For starters, she has a deep appreciation for soul music, particularly from the 1960s. As a kid, she would listen to her father’s collection of anthologies on repeat, “And I think they really imprinted songwriting into my brain,” she said. In early August, Karen O randomly pulled out a compilation featuring Aretha Franklin that she’d leaned on during her 20s, and wrote on Instagram that the Queen of Soul “broke the mold.” Ten days later, Franklin was dead. “That was a bit weird,” Karen O said at the hotel, her tight bob of hair hugging her face. Thoughts about the irreplaceable artists of her youth and the idea of legacy started to gnaw at her as she approached 40 last year. What happens when “even the biggest people in the arts just eventually fade away?” she wondered, and what would she herself leave behind? “She is a rock musician who’s idling in a genre that is currently completely undervalued,” the singer Shirley Manson of Garbage, a friend of Karen O’s, said in a phone interview. “People laugh at us, the rockers. Karen and I have spoken about this. We’re like, ‘We’re the [expletive] rockers, and we love it, because there’s no one else in our pool. We’re still swimming around like sharks.’” Manson turned her attention to the music industry, which she called “a really staunch patriarchal system” that devalues women as they get older. “You have to walk through the valley of death yourself and figure out who you will be. Karen’s going to have to find out for herself what Karen O will be, and she’ll figure it out fine.” Karen O tends to look to the left when she’s talking, and her gaze remained fixed as she described that midlife crisis. “I felt those cliché things,” she said. “Like, wow, maybe I’m not going to get around to doing all those things I wanted to do. I’ve just been wildly ambitious and idealistic and actually quite optimistic about making stuff.” Suddenly she was struck by how hard it felt to create, and how fleeting and impermanent everything can seem. She said she turned to a friend who was a punk rocker in the late ’70s and early ’80s for advice, “And she said to me: ‘Yeah, ashes to ashes, man, isn’t it great? Once you realize that, you’re free.’ And I was like, wow. I can’t process that quite yet, but once I do, that’s going to be [expletive] good times.” "

The actor and musician, who performs as Childish Gambino, will also release “Guava Island,” a long-rumored movie that Glover and Rihanna filmed over four weeks in Cuba. [Read about our first look at the project.] Directed by Hiro Murai, a frequent collaborator with Glover on the series “Atlanta” and the Grammy-winning video for “This Is America,” “Guava Island” will debut at Coachella on Thursday in a specially constructed theater, according to a news release. It will be available to stream for free on Amazon for 18 hours, from 3 a.m. to 9 p.m. Eastern on Saturday, and will then remain available for Prime Video members. It will also stream on Twitch at 8 p.m. on Saturday and will continue to be shown at Coachella throughout the festival, the release said. “Guava Island” also stars Nonso Anozie (“Game of Thrones”) and Letitia Wright (Shuri in “Black Panther”) and was written by Glover’s brother, Stephen. The secretive project has been the subject of speculation since last summer, when a photo of Glover and Rihanna was posted online. Other than another image posted by Glover and Amazon’s short trailer, little is known about the movie’s contents; a report in Vanity Fair described it as “an hourlong, music-driven film” inspired by the 2003 movie “City of God,” set in Brazil, and by Prince’s “Purple Rain.” “I’m really humbled having the opportunity to present something this timely and timeless,” Glover said in the release. Murai called the shoot a “crazy fever dream of a production” over “four incredible weeks spent in Cuba,” the release said. "

Eilish, 17, has spent the last few years establishing herself as the negation of what a female teen-pop star used to be. She doesn’t play innocent, or ingratiating, or flirtatious, or perky, or cute. Instead, she’s sullen, depressive, death-haunted, sly, analytical and confrontational, all without raising her voice. [Billie Eilish is not your typical 17-year-old pop star. Get used to her.] On singles and EPs, like her 2017 EP “Don’t Smile at Me,” Eilish’s songs have treated love as a power struggle, an absurd game, and a destructive obsession, racking up more than a billion streams from listeners who apparently share her sentiments. On her Instagram page, which has more than 15 million followers, she is brusquely anti-fashion, swaddling herself in shapeless, oversized, boldly colored clothes and making silly or ghoulish faces. “I do what I want when I’m wanting to/My soul so cynical,” she notes in “Bad Guy.” But that’s just her starting point. While Eilish’s previous releases have featured her flinty, defensive side, her debut album also admits to sorrows and vulnerabilities. In some ways the album arrives as a continuation, not an introduction. Like her previous releases, it’s the work of a very small, decidedly innovative family team. Eilish writes and records her songs with her older brother, Finneas O’Connell, working largely at home. The sound they have built for her is sparse with instrumentation and large with implication. A typical track uses just a handful of parts, nearly all of them electronic: a bass line, a beat, only enough keyboard notes to sketch a harmony. Eilish sings barely above a whisper, a signal of intimacy. But at any moment, the tracks are likely to flaunt their artificiality: adding samples or sound effects, distorting her voice, suddenly deploying a big bass drop. “Wish You Were Gay” — a guy is ignoring her, and she wishes he was indifferent to her gender rather than her in particular — starts with just acoustic-guitar chords and her voice, tokens of pop sincerity. But the mix also includes a tittering audience and applause at the end, insisting that the song is archly theatrical. In Eilish’s digital-native universe, it’s impossible to pretend that anything is unobserved or unmediated; everything is self-conscious. While albums in the streaming era aren’t always made to be heard as a whole, “When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?” traces a clear arc: from bravado to melancholy. Early in the album are songs like “You Should See Me in a Crown” — an ominously assured, sustained and then slamming claim to power — and the mocking, music-hall flavored “All the Good Girls Go to Hell,” as well as “Xanny,” a ballad that disdains the trendy overuse of the anti-anxiety drug Xanax. But with a stretch of songs near the end of the album, Eilish turns to thoughts of grief, suicide and loneliness. “Bury a Friend,” with a pulsing, nervous undercurrent and sampled screams, veers between mourning, lashing out and self-destructive thoughts. “Ilomilo” has a briskly plinking, near-ska beat, but it worries over a suicidal friend: “I might break/If you’re gonna die not by mistake.” In “Listen Before I Go,” a glacial piano ballad with looming reverberations, the narrator herself is suicidal; “Sorry, can’t save me,” she warns, and sirens at the end suggest the worst. It’s followed by the whispery “I Love You,” a hovering, hesitant confession: “I don’t want to, but I love you.” Eilish began her career establishing what kind of pop star she doesn’t intend to be. With her debut album, she’s even tougher: tough enough to show some heart. "

But he is not among the guest conductors recently announced for next season, which is unfortunate: He led an exceptionally urgent and insightful account of Schumann’s Second Symphony. He may want to focus his attention on the thriving Seattle Symphony where, this fall, he steps up from principal guest conductor to music director, succeeding Ludovic Morlot. But I hope we’ll hear more of him in New York. He has a penchant for challenging players, partly though bold interpretive ideas, but also with his idiosyncratic conducting style. With his lanky frame and sweeping arm gestures, Mr. Dausgaard often seemed almost to hover over the players. And there were places in the Schumann symphony, especially at the start of a section, in which the Philharmonic players were not quite in sync. Sometimes the flow of a passage took time to settle in. Yet I was engrossed throughout. Mr. Dausgaard, who avoids going for big statements, conveyed the work’s subtle dramatic character and brought out striking details. This symphony can sometimes seem at odds with itself, with stretches in which Schumann tries to channel his wild imagination into majestic Beethovenian symphonic forms. A fantastical episode is run through with rigorous contrapuntal passages. But Mr. Dausgaard balanced all these elements. The restrained opening of the first movement came across like a hybrid of a Bach chorale prelude — complete with a walking Baroque bass line — and a stirring Romantic fanfare. When, after a transitional passage played here with enticing ambiguity, the main Allegro section took off, the playing had both rhythmic spark and sly impetuosity. The Scherzo zipped along with crisply dispatched passagework in the violins. Yet the performance also captured the slightly manic animation that drives the music. The expansive, glowing slow movement had lyrical grandeur without grandiosity. The restless finale came across like a spiraling and slightly dangerous dance. Mr. Dausgaard opened the concert with a dark, mysterious account of Nielsen’s “Helios” Overture. And the program included the  pianist Stephen Hough as soloist in a vibrant performance of Beethoven’s Third Piano Concerto. Mr. Hough’s playing was lucid, rich with colors and full of surprises. Some of those surprise turns seemed to catch Mr. Dausgaard off guard; Mr. Hough is not so easy to follow himself. But this just lent the performance a wonderful immediacy. "
5cadf74049f0eacbf1f82559,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/10/arts/music/tayla-parx-ariana-grande-thank-u-next.html,"For 15 weeks since the fall, the top spot on the Billboard singles chart has been occupied by one of two Ariana Grande mega-smashes — “Thank U, Next” and “7 Rings” — that drip with the mettle and coquettish swagger of a pop diva, while borrowing from hip-hop beats and cadences. That winsome formula, though particularly compelling from Grande, can be traced back through recent pop history on a global scale: There are elements of the sound in a K-pop track by the girl group Red Velvet from 2015; a JoJo kiss-off from 2016; a Fifth Harmony single from 2017; and a Grammy-nominated Christina Aguilera number from last year. Even “High Hopes,” the sugary comeback hit from the pop-punk survivors Panic! at the Disco, which peaked at No. 4 in January, shares some of that DNA in its ecstatic vocal runs and melodic precision. The common link comes via the songwriter Taylor Parks, an ebullient 25-year-old former child actress with a brightly dyed bob and an air of benevolent mischief, who was credited on each. Known in the industry as a top-liner, Parks, who performs as Tayla Parx, contributes melodic and lyrical ideas to some of the biggest artists in the world, and those aspiring to be. For the last few years, she has done so quietly, cutting a meticulous yet low-key warpath through popular music on a personal quest to land a No. 1 single on every genre chart — a lofty goal that’s no longer far-fetched. “I only have a few more to go,” Parx said recently, while putting the finishing touches on her own debut album. “I need a country, I need a gospel, and I need a hip-hop.” She tackled Latin pop back in 2016, before its crossover explosion, and Nashville was already in her sights, she teased, after recent interest from Kacey Musgraves and Keith Urban. They are not the only ones to take notice. Parx was credited as a co-writer on half of Grande’s blockbuster “Thank U, Next” album, which rebooted the pop singer’s sound and public narrative. For Parx, the release worked as a springboard from workaday writer to A-list studio presence and, ideally, viable solo artist — an elusive final hurdle for many young female songwriters, from Ester Dean and Jessie J to Julia Michaels and Starrah. “Most songwriters fail to become an artist the same size they were a songwriter,” acknowledged Richie Kipp, one of Parx’s managers. “But I’ve never seen anyone wired like Tayla.” A Texas-born protégée of the actress and choreographer Debbie Allen, Parx moved with her family — a mother who worked in software and a father in mortgage underwriting — to Los Angeles to pursue show business. She played Little Inez Stubbs in the 2007 film adaptation of “Hairspray” before landing a few small television parts, including on Nickelodeon shows where she first crossed paths with Grande. Though they kept in touch intermittently on AOL Instant Messenger — and Parx helped write the title track for Grande’s second album, “My Everything,” in 2014 — the women did not really reconnect in person until the making of “Thank U, Next” late last year. In the meantime, Parx had clocked studio time with Babyface, contributed to a Mariah Carey divorce anthem while still a teenager and become a voice actor on “The Sims” and “The Walking Dead” video games. (Parx’s song “Me vs. Us” has a Simlish version, sung entirely in the fictional language.) Now, with Grande in her corner and on her résumé, Parx is trying to balance studio sessions for hit-seeking artists like Sam Smith, Haim and Dua Lipa with signing artists and producers of her own, going on acting auditions, working on a screenplay for an animated film, conceiving a clothing brand and promoting her Atlantic Records release, “We Need to Talk.” The new album, like Parx’s best hits, is playful and conversational, blending pop, R&B and traces of rap with plenty of Grande-esque high notes. “It’s been nuts,” Parx said. “I really had to jump through all the hoops of fire. First of all, being black, and then being a woman, and then being a young black woman. But we got through all of them.” (A recent study by the University of Southern California Annenberg Inclusion Initiative found that of the 633 songs to chart from 2012 through 2018, just 12.3 percent included female songwriters.) In addition to her contagious pluck and facility across genres, Parx credited her listening skills and discretion as crucial to endearing her to major artists. “There are a lot of things in my vault from the biggest stars in the world,” she said. “I would never betray them or take advantage of that trust.” Her acting background helps, too. “When I write these songs after having conversations with artists,” she said, “I’m embodying that and becoming them in that moment.” Aguilera compared Parx to a little sister, one who introduced her to “Black Mirror” and Instagram stories, while also gamely battling Aguilera’s children with Nerf guns. “She just has this natural personable quality that makes you feel at ease,” Aguilera said. “You want to be in a room with her.” As a former child performer herself, Aguilera said she was thrilled with the recognition now heading Parx’s way after her work with Grande. “I can hear Tayla in those songs, for sure,” Aguilera said, praising Parx’s ability to collaborate with “another young artist and really take them to that next place in their career, where you’re like: ‘Oh, wait, who is this again? Ariana Grande!?’” Parx was brought into the “Thank U, Next” sessions in October by her longtime friends and collaborators Victoria Monét, another top-liner, and the producer Tommy Brown, or TB Hits, who had both worked on Grande’s four previous albums. Grande had just released a full-length, “Sweetener,” that August, but with the death of her ex-boyfriend, the rapper Mac Miller, and the flame out of her high-profile romance with Pete Davidson of “Saturday Night Live,” she had plenty more material to work through. “We were kind of there through the breakup and the makeup and the breakup again,” Parx said, “which is why records like ‘NASA’ and ‘Make Up’ came.” The group wrote about nine songs in a week, six of which ended up making the “Thank U, Next” album. But none were as crucial as the title track, which existed in multiple versions, including the internet-melting one where Grande addressed her exes by name. “They all felt like the one until we got to ‘Thank U, Next,’ and then we were like, ‘This is the one one!’” Parx said. Brown recalled Parx as an advocate for specificity. “She was a big supporter of using the names,” he said, citing her tendency to speak her mind. “All big stars need people who are honest with them,” Brown added. “Too many times these people are lied to or just agreed with. Tayla’s not going to that.” Parx noted that she, Monét and Grande were not only collaborators but also peers and friends. “For me to connect to a young female is a completely different perspective than when you have a Max Martin talking to a young female,” she said, referring to the longtime pop hitmaker. As for the criticism that Grande received about appropriating black music and style, Parx brushed it off, noting that many critics failed to recognize the pop star’s black collaborators. “She’s actually supporting the black producers and writers that she works with more than some of the black artists that I’ve worked with,” Parx said. “I think the free exchange is important for the evolution of music,” she added. “If we didn’t take from each other, genre-wise, everything would sound the same. As long as the proper credit is given, that’s the most important thing.” Parx’s technical skills, like a knack for arranging and producing vocals, also help set her apart. “I might find a breath or a word that I like — it’s like surgery,” she said of the process, which can include coaching singers toward certain emotional registers and chopping up different takes into fine-tuned final versions. As she spoke, Parx was using one ear to track the progress of her own vocals on a song that needed to be finished for her album. In the editing process, a line that should have been “teach me” had morphed into “tease me.” “It sounds like I have a lisp,” she told her audio engineer, barely missing a beat in conversation. Seeming genuinely sated by all of the success coming her way, Parx was typically buoyant about the possibility that “We Need to Talk” may not be her own commercial breakthrough, but merely another baby step in an atypical career. “That would be very ungrateful of me to look at the records that I’ve broken, the career that I’ve had from 9 until now, and measure my success against someone else’s,” she said, flashing her disarmingly confident grin. “There’s a lot of things that the biggest artists in the world haven’t done that I’ve done.” "
5cb0ffb249f0eacbf1f838dc,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/12/arts/music/coachella-live-stream.html,"Merely headlining Coachella? You’re doing it wrong. These days, the festival’s biggest past and present stars are hacking it. From new films by Donald Glover and Beyoncé to a one-morning-only Easter performance by Kanye West, this year’s fest in Indio, Calif., comes with a shadow billing of bonus, semi-sanctioned content aimed far beyond the main stage.  The extracurricular activity signifies the evolution of one of the country’s largest music festivals from a mostly self-contained arbiter of status — able to confer cultural relevance in a font size on its lineup posters — into something more like an all-purpose tool for today’s globally minded performers, accustomed in the digital age to serving many audiences at once and on their own terms. For fans, more off-platform programming at Coachella means it’s easier than ever to avoid FOMO without coughing up a half-grand and trekking to the desert. Here’s a short guide. The rapper Childish Gambino, alias of the entertainer Donald Glover, is unveiling a new movie and has a headlining set this weekend. A mysterious trailer for the film, called “Guava Island,” had its premiere at Glover’s PHAROS festival in November, crediting the co-stars Rihanna, Letitia Wright, Nonso Anozie and the director Hiro Murai (“Atlanta,” “This Is America”), and sending internet sleuths into overdrive. The secrets of “Guava Island” were revealed Thursday night at an early screening on the Coachella campgrounds, and it debuted during Childish Gambino’s set. The movie is neither a visual album à la “Lemonade,” as some fans predicted, nor a traditional feature, but something in between. Kyle Buchanan of The New York Times attended the screening and described it as “a music-driven fable” set in Cuba that pairs refurbished Gambino hits, including “This Is America” and “Summertime Magic,” with a slight plot concerning love, music and capitalism.  The film will be available to stream free on Amazon for 18 hours, from 3 a.m. to 9 p.m. Eastern on Saturday and will remain available for Prime Video members. Saturday, April 13, 3 a.m. Eastern All year, Kanye West has been hosting a roving, informal, invite-only Sunday morning concert series — Sunday Service — featuring a gospel choir and sanctified renditions of his songs and others.  Guests have reportedly included Katy Perry and David Letterman, but the Coachella crowd (and viewers watching on the live stream) will get to hear the gospel on the second Sunday of the festival, which falls on Easter this year.  In January, Billboard reported that West had originally been set to headline both weekends of the festival, but he pulled out at the last minute because of a dispute over his desire to perform in a custom dome. It’s unsurprising, then, that he’s chosen an equally nontraditional venue for the Sunday Service show — a hill (or “mountain,” as West called it in an announcement video) on land usually reserved for campgrounds. Sunday, April 21, Time T.B.A. (West has said 9 a.m. Pacific.) One of the most disruptive Coachella performances in recent memory took place last year, when Beyoncé — the first African-American woman to headline the festival — transformed her set into a robust, kinetic survey of the collegiate traditions and musical lineage of black America. That show is the subject of “Homecoming,” a new, behind-the-scenes documentary debuting on Netflix the Wednesday between the two weekends of this year’s festival.  The original performance was the most-watched Coachella live stream ever, with more than 458,000 concurrent viewers. Now, the artist will deliver a remixed, 360-degree view of the experience to Netflix’s millions of subscribers. Wednesday, April 17  For the first time, Coachella will live stream its second weekend on YouTube in addition to Weekend 1.

But could it really help spur the recent revival of French Baroque music, and fuel the renewed interest in the viola da gamba, an instrument that had been rare since the 18th century? It may sound improbable, but the 1991 Alain Corneau film “Tous les Matins du Monde,” starring Gérard Depardieu and featuring a soundtrack by the Catalan viol master Jordi Savall, did just that — in ways that continue to resonate more than a quarter of a century later. “Young people were fascinated by the film,” recalled Mr. Savall, who is touring the movie’s music with Le Concert des Nations and will perform it on Thursday night at Carnegie Hall’s Zankel Hall. (The concert will be broadcast by WQXR.) “The movie reached people who would never go to a concert, especially a concert of Baroque music.” The film was a phenomenon, racking up awards and drawing audiences around the globe. Its Louis XIV-era soundtrack scaled the charts in France, where it outsold all but Michael Jackson. And on the weekend of the film’s United States release, the album, featuring music by the Baroque composers Lully, Sainte-Colombe and Marais, sold more copies than Madonna’s “Erotica” at some New York stores, prompting one newspaper to ask: “Better than sex?” It hit just as the French Baroque revival was beginning to flourish, thanks in large part to the pathbreaking productions of the conductor William Christie and the ensemble Les Arts Florissants, who were bringing long-neglected French masters back into vogue. But by reaching viewers beyond the concert hall, the film turned new audiences on to the poignant beauty of the viola da gamba, a fretted, bowed instrument played between the legs that had been popular during the Renaissance and Baroque eras. For many players, makers and teachers of the viol, the success of “Tous les Matins du Monde” and its soundtrack was startling. And for some, it was life-changing. Loren Ludwig was 15 and trying to figure out how to play the Bach cello suites on his electric guitar when he first heard the plaintive, mellow sound of the viol on a cassette of the movie’s soundtrack. “It was like nothing I’d heard before,” Mr. Ludwig recalled. He soon began taking viol lessons, went on to study the instrument at the Oberlin Conservatory of Music. Now he plays with ensembles, including LeStrange Viols and ACRONYM. Along the way, he said, he had discovered that many of his viol-playing colleagues had also had formative experiences with the soundtrack. “It’s a little bit of a joke among viol players in my generation,” he said. To say the film inspired a craze would be an overstatement; it was not “The Lego Movie,” a blockbuster selling an already-popular product. But it did have an impact that continues to be felt, said Charlie Ogle, who was already making viols when the film came out. “I thought, ‘I’m going to sell a million instruments!’” he recalled in a telephone interview. “And then nothing, zippo. But maybe six months, a year later, somebody asked about an instrument, and told me that the movie had put them on to it. And then the next year, a couple. And since then, it’s been a significant, steady background influence.” Viol players sometimes roll their eyes at the artistic liberties the film takes with the history of Marais and Sainte-Colombe, and Mr. Depardieu’s less-than-convincing miming of playing the instrument. But they recall new students signing up for their classes, new audiences showing up to their concerts, and the simple excitement of seeing their world celebrated. “I was 35 and fairly early in my career, and I cheered when Marais led the orchestra, pounding on the floor with a staff,” said Lisa Terry, the president of the Viola da Gamba Society of America, which has more than a thousand members. Even established musicians found it beneficial. Mr. Christie, who is bringing Les Arts Florissants to the Brooklyn Academy of Music in early March for “Rameau, Maître à Danser,” a pairing of two of Rameau’s pastoral opera-ballets, said that the film had reached audiences beyond the regular concert-going public. “Back in those days, I think for a musician who wanted to specialize in something like that, you needed all the help you could get,” Mr. Christie said in a telephone interview, adding that he had missed the film’s premiere because of an illness and never ended up seeing it, despite his longstanding admiration for Mr. Savall. Mr. Savall recalled that, while recording the soundtrack, Mr. Corneau — the film’s director, who died in 2010 — would urge him to play the pieces not as he would in a concert, but as if he were Marin Marais during emotionally charged moments in the composer’s life. “I was playing, for the first time, as an actor,” Mr. Savall said. “It was for me a lesson: For this I have said, many times, Alain Corneau was my last teacher.” Asked why he thought the viol music struck such a nerve, Mr. Savall quoted the composer Couperin, who said that he preferred music that touched him to music that surprised him. “We have today so many superficial things,” Mr. Savall said. “I think in life we need to be touched. Sometimes it’s also nice to be surprised. But the essential thing is to be touched.” "

Each year the library admits a new batch recordings into the registry, which functions as a kind of hall of fame of American recorded sound. The 2018 class also includes the album “Superfly” by Curtis Mayfield, a funk classic; Jay-Z’s hip-hop masterpiece “The Blueprint”; and the earliest known recordings of Yiddish songs, captured at the start of the 20th century.

5c4e117b3a125f5075c0695b,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/27/arts/music/juilliard-focus-festival-review.html,"Think of the great patrons of music, and some resonant names come to mind: Nikolaus, Prince Esterhazy, for instance, who for three decades employed Joseph Haydn; or Cardinal Pietro Ottoboni, who funded Italian baroque luminaries. But cast around for their successors — the most important commissioners of living composers — and you encounter a string of initials: BBC, WDR, SWR. The fertile generosity of these public broadcasters (the latter two are Westdeutscher Rundfunk and Südwestrundfunk, regional radio entities with headquarters in Cologne and Stuttgart) is the subject of this year’s Focus Festival at the Juilliard School. It opened on Friday with a stimulating concert by the New Juilliard Ensemble in the Peter Jay Sharp Theater in Manhattan. Under the banner “On the Air! A Salute to 75 Years of International Radio Commissioning,” the festival presents five more programs, through Feb. 1, that reveal how much of a lifeline noncommercial radio has become to composers since the end of World War II. The conductor Joel Sachs, who designed the festival and led Friday’s concert, said in a phone interview that a British composer had told him bluntly: “We’d all starve without the BBC.” While the festival draws attention to the wealth of opportunities created by international broadcasters, it also points a finger at the glaring absence of similar initiatives in the United States. “The problem with commercial radio is that it doesn’t want to do anything as esoteric as classical music,” Mr. Sachs said, “let alone commission contemporary music.” Mr. Sachs said that in his research he had learned of a handful of new works commissioned by isolated American broadcasters, including stations in Minnesota and Cincinnati. But these numbers paled next to the statistics he gathered of radio commissions from Europe and Canada in the postwar era. The BBC supplied a list, possibly incomplete, of nearly 1,600 compositions. Radio France listed 2,300 titles. German regional broadcasters were each responsible for hundreds of works. Canadian composers have benefited from the robust support of the CBC, which commissioned some 1,200 pieces. These broadcasters are cultural powerhouses, and not just on the airwaves. Most have their own ensembles, including symphony orchestras and choirs, and run festivals like the Witten Days for New Chamber Music, organized by the WDR, or the Donaueschingen Festival, a storied engine of avant-garde music that is now under the auspices of the SWR. Each summer the BBC Proms whip up public enthusiasm and draw huge crowds with televised concerts that include new commissions. Some countries make a point of targeting their commissioning largess toward their own composers. One example is Finnish Radio, which sees fostering new Finnish music as part of its mission. That’s how a Modernist gem like Jouni Kaipainen’s “Trois Morceaux de l’Aube” came into being. It received a superb performance on Friday by the cellist Sasha Scolnik-Brower and the pianist Michalis Boliakis. A radio commission gave life to this darkly ruminative work, shot through with flashes of rhythmic exuberance, in 1981, when the composer was 25. In Germany, where the postwar occupying powers designed a decentralized broadcasting landscape free of government control, the mission is broader. In a phone interview, Harry Vogt, who has headed the new music program at the WDR for decades, said he sees it as his responsibility “to produce things, far from commercial considerations, that wouldn’t come into being on their own.” The balancing act there lies in staying accountable to the public through programs — “you don’t want to do things that interest nobody,” he said — while granting composers the creative freedom to develop their art away from the pressures of the market. Mr. Vogt said his commissions also extend beyond the concert hall to sound installations in public and industrial spaces in order to reach new listeners. “There is always an educational component, too,” he said, “though you try to avoid it reeking of pedagogy.” Friday’s concert proved that, in casting the net wide, the patronage of the broadcasters reels in works of varying quality. I was underwhelmed by Colin Matthews’s “A Voice to Wake,” with its vocal line that felt somehow both sibylline and mechanical. The Korean-German composer Younghi Pagh-Paan’s “U-MUL (The Well),” commissioned by WDR, relied a little too heavily on watery sound painting. On the other hand, listeners are indebted to Radio France for Akira Nishimura’s beguiling “Corps d’Arc-en-Ciel,” with its brilliant play on density and light. And, in this context, it was instructive to hear Salvatore Sciarrino’s “Archeologia del Telefono,” an instrumental work infused with his trademark fragility, in which brittle sounds hover on the edge of imperceptibility, carrying subtle charges of humor. In concert, Sciarrino’s music fascinates in part because of the odd techniques used to draw sounds from the instrument. I couldn’t help but wonder how a radio listener would interpret the dry flutter produced by a violinist bowing what looked like a Post-it note tacked to her instrument. The esoteric sound world of such works requires an even more intense concentration on the part of the radio listener who, unlike the audience in the room, is literally all ears. "

Using an internet-first approach, Eilish has amassed a powerful teen following by adhering only to her most specific, and often strangest, musical whims, earning more than a billion total song streams already, before the release of her debut album last Friday. Her songs mix elements of electronic pop and hip-hop with an alternative bent, and are written and recorded solely with her older brother Finneas, 21, usually in the small bedrooms of their parents’ Los Angeles home. But “Bury a Friend,” one of Eilish’s darkest and most successful songs to date, came together from more disparate sources, including a rare visit to a proper studio and a dentist’s chair, where Eilish captured the horrendous whirring of a drill that was later added to the track. Despite its horror-movie sound effects, odd structure and nightmare lyrics, “Bury a Friend” peaked this year at No. 14 on the Billboard Hot 100, and its grisly video has been viewed more than 100 million times. The song is also currently rising at alt-rock radio, as Eilish ascends to further mainstream heights with her first full-length, “When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?,” which is dominating streaming services and expected to hit No. 1 on next week’s album chart. In the video above, featuring a cameo from the siblings’ mother, Maggie, see how Eilish and her brother are reinventing teen-pop stardom with tracks like “Bury a Friend.” “Diary of a Song” pulls back the curtain on how pop music is made today, using archival material — voice memos, demo versions, text messages, emails, interviews and more — to tell the story behind the track.

5c40cbce3a125f5075c04f6a,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/arts/music/review-new-york-philharmonic-jaap-van-zweden.html,"The subscription-series format long commonplace at American orchestras, with a weekly offering of standard repertory, is looking a little, well, standard. Take the program Jaap van Zweden led with the New York Philharmonic at David Geffen Hall on Wednesday. There was no particular musical connection or thematic thread linking the two staples performed: Beethoven’s Second Piano Concerto and Rachmaninoff’s Second Symphony. Yet, on its own terms, this was an exceptional concert. The brilliant pianist Yefim Bronfman was the soloist in a pristine, elegant account of Beethoven’s youthful concerto. And for Philharmonic regulars trying to glean what special qualities Mr. van Zweden may be bringing to the orchestra in his inaugural season as its music director, the compelling performance he led of Rachmaninoff’s rhapsodic symphony revealed new dimensions of his artistry. I get impatient with the hourlong piece, which for all its lyrical richness can seem long-winded. During whole stretches, this plushly orchestrated symphony strikes me as a Rachmaninoff piano concerto that’s missing the solo part. When the orchestra goes through endless manipulations of some theme, I find myself wanting a pianist to break in and take charge with a cascade of steely chords. In trying to bring freshness to standard repertory works, Mr. van Zweden has a tendency to overdo things. With his insightful account of this symphony, though, he did almost the opposite. He brought out inner details, revealing the rhetoric of the piece — that is, the way phrases are written like sentences, grouped into paragraphs, even when the music seems on the surface to run on with overextended elaborations of themes. Rachmaninoff was in his mid-30s when he wrote the Second Symphony, first performed in 1908, and still felt bruised by the hostile reaction to his First a decade earlier. The slow Largo section that opens the piece unfolded like the introduction to an essay, with themes almost presented for consideration. The orchestral sound is rich and thick, with passages played over dark, sustained bass tones. Yet the performance had remarkable lucidity and breadth, which continued as the Largo segued into the restless, expansive Allegro main section of the first movement. Mr. van Zweden drew crisp, snappy playing from the orchestra in the exuberant, scherzo-like second movement. The intriguing way he began the slow movement made it seem like it starts in the middle of some long melodic line. His approach set up the Adagio’s true theme, a wistful, elegiac melody for solo clarinet, played gorgeously by Anthony McGill, the Philharmonic’s principal clarinet. The account of the finale captured all its headlong energy, music at once festive and frenzied. Mr. Bronfman has made news in recent years at the Philharmonic in the premieres of daunting concertos written for him by Esa-Pekka Salonen and Magnus Lindberg. There was plenty of sparkling passagework in his playing of Beethoven’s ebullient Second Concerto. But he seemed intent on highlighting the music’s reflective passages and poetic flights, especially in his dreamy account of the slow movement. It was a pleasure to hear such a lithe and refined account of Beethoven’s bracing concerto. Why it made sense to pair it with the Rachmaninoff symphony, though, I cannot say. "

Romeo Santos’s “Utopia” is a luscious new album of collaborations with bachata stars of various generations (though notably, none who emerged after Santos became a solo phenomenon). But while there are standout performances from Raulin Rodriguez and Monchy & Alexandra, among others, the most anticipated song is “Inmortal,” on which Santos reunites with his bandmates in Aventura, the foursome that modernized bachata in the 2000s and hasn’t released new music in eight years. “Inmortal” is lithe and lovely — the group’s taut dynamic is still rooted in the formidable pair of Lenny Santos on guitar and Max Santos on bass. (Henry Santos dips in and out on background vocals.) Romeo sings like a matador — commanding but also sly, weaving in and out of the forefront at will. Like the rest of this album, “Inmortal” argues that even as the music Aventura spawned mutates ever faster, there is still comfort in how it used to be. JON CARAMANICA Gil Scott-Heron, the visionary poet and musician who died in 2011, would have turned 70 this week. In commemoration, the Archives — a reggae band based in Scott-Heron’s onetime home of Washington, D.C. — has released the first single from a forthcoming album devoted to his repertoire. This version of “Home Is Where the Hatred Is,” a testimonial of bleak addiction, trades in the edgy anxiety of Scott-Heron’s scurrying original for a sedate, dub-reggae flow. But Puma Ptah, a vocalist hailing from the U.S. Virgin Islands, holds onto the lyric’s core sense of pathos and frustration. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO It’s more important that this exists than that it’s great. That said, it’s almost great. Conor Oberst takes the Jackson Maine part and aggressively deflates it — he turns the searching lyrics morose, and you sense he wants to yank the cadence down into the mud but doesn’t let himself. Perhaps that’s because Phoebe Bridgers is on deck, and she’s in ferocious form. If Oberst is stubbing the song out, she’s lifting it over her head in triumph. CARAMANICA Blissed-out but not blissful synth-pop from the Australian singer Hatchie, “Stay With Me” is viscous and shimmering, but also so lush it verges on the suffocating. Maybe that’s by design: “It’s no better now you’re gone/I feel nothing, I feel numb,” she sings, wallowing in ache as the dreamy music takes up all the air in the room. CARAMANICA “Titanic Rising,” the album released on Friday by Weyes Blood — the songwriter Natalie Mering — takes refuge from present-day dread in vintage sounds, reaching back to the late 1960s and the early 1970s. “Everyday,” a song about longing and fear of loneliness, moves from Beatles-style piano bounce and bass countermelodies to a chorus full of exultant vocal harmonies recalling the Mamas and the Papas. An orchestral buildup sounds supportive but then falls apart, leaving her unfulfilled once again. The video, directed by Mering, becomes a horror movie. JON PARELES “When the last tree has fallen and the rivers are poison/You cannot eat money,” the Norwegian songwriter Aurora warns in “The Seed,” an environmental anthem that seesaws between hopeful and baleful. She summons an orchestra and a multitracked choir to juxtapose the growth of a seed — “Feed me sunlight/feed me air” — with the forces arrayed against it. The outcome isn’t guaranteed. PARELES Composure on the surface, passion and turbulence flaring within: That’s what happens in the songs on Ioanna Gika’s new album “Thalassa,” released on Friday. In “Out of Focus,” stately electric-piano chords pace a sustained but odd-angled melody: “All I was, was wanting you,” she confesses as it begins. But nervous, double-time drums and electronics are already creeping in, soon to swell with voices and instruments, as she realizes this romance is crumbling: “Holding on to history/love, the absentee.” The melody stays clear and aloft; the hope plummets. PARELES “The Who Sell Out” was a 1967 concept album, an imaginary pirate-radio broadcast that placed new Who songs between the band’s own mock commercials. Now it’s a just throwaway reference — “Im’a sell out like the Who” — for Barrington DeVaughn Hendricks, the rapper and utterly unpredictable producer who records as Jpegmafia. His casual boasts are by far the most commonplace part of this track, a glimmering assemblage of looping keyboards, comic interruptions and plaintive melodic fragments of song from the electronic-pop singer Eyas: “I’ll dream again, or will I?,” she muses, in promising non sequiturs. PARELES In just two and a half minutes, “Tirata Tiratata” demonstrates the depth of Anat Fort’s talents as a pianist, and the synergetic range of her trio (Gary Wang on bass and Roland Schneider on drums), which is celebrating its 20th year together. Fort skids around the keyboard in quick, truncated lines, using jagged chords in the left hand to slice up her momentum even as the group’s energy continues to rise. With the trio tumbling toward a release, Fort remains governed by a deep sense of poise and a luminous touch. RUSSONELLO The 12-minute title track of Christian Fennesz’s new album, “Agora,” his first solo release in five years, conjures elemental forces in limitless space: vast washes of sound that materialize slowly out of nowhere and transform themselves from noise to tone and back again, perceptible sometimes as chords and sometimes as abstract sound. They work on their own time frame, hinting at something that dwarfs mere human scale. PARELES "
5c8fe0ca49f0eacbf105db36,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/18/arts/music/review-dreamers-oratorio-jimmy-lopez-nilo-cruz-berkeley.html,"BERKELEY, Calif. — The history of oratorios is populated with great heroes of religion and myth. Bach, Handel and John Adams have written about Jesus. Stravinsky took inspiration from Sophocles; Honegger, from Joan of Arc. Rarely will you find an oratorio about fast-shifting current events. But in “Dreamers,” an ambitious yet bloated new work that had its premiere here at Zellerbach Hall at the University of California, Berkeley, on Sunday, the composer Jimmy López and the librettist Nilo Cruz tell the stories of undocumented immigrants by elevating their experiences to the mythic realm of oratorios past. That was their solution to the problem of writing about the hundreds of thousands of young immigrants, known as “Dreamers,” protected by the Obama-era program Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. This is an ever-changing subject, caught in legislative and judicial limbo: a policy mandated in one president’s term and threatened in the next. To avoid getting caught in breaking news, Mr. López and Mr. Cruz’s 45-minute work — presented by Cal Performances and featuring the soprano Ana María Martínez and the UC Berkeley Chamber Chorus and Volti with the excellent Philharmonia Orchestra of London under Esa-Pekka Salonen — broadens the scope. The creators attempt to look beyond headlines to timeless themes of migration and optimism, beginning in the distant past and ending far beyond our moment of crisis and uncertainty. And what better place than Berkeley? The Bay Area enclave bills itself as the first so-called sanctuary city in the United States; the university touts the support it provides through its Undocumented Students Program. Including Mr. Salonen was serendipitous, since it was announced last fall that he would be the next music director of the San Francisco Symphony. Mr. López is a local composer with a doctorate from Berkeley, and immigrated to the United States from Peru. Mr. Cruz, a Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright and Mr. López’s collaborator on the 2015 opera “Bel Canto,” arrived in this country as a refugee from Cuba. You can’t help but be impressed by the scale and aspiration of “Dreamers.” Which is why I found myself wincing every time Mr. López’s music undercut its own potential. He is clearly a master of writing for orchestra, of exploiting its individual sections and instruments — even the sum of its parts — for maximal effect. But his artistry doesn’t quite match his skill. The music thrills more than it intrigues; it prefers to make blunt declarations, not thoroughly persuasive arguments. Mr. Cruz’s words, however, are poetic and poignant, reminiscent of Alice Goodman’s librettos for the John Adams operas “Nixon in China” and “The Death of Klinghoffer,” which occupy a dreamy realm between historical fact and ethereal enigma. Although Mr. Cruz took his inspiration from conversations with undocumented students at Berkeley, he describes immigration as if were a story as old as time itself: “It came with the yearn / of a leaf, three clouds, / and a woman who dreamt / she was walking / towards the edge / of the world. / And the right / to migrate / was granted.” If only the score matched this poetry. The text often gets the treatment of an action-movie soundtrack — frenetic and epic, rarely softer than fortissimo, occasionally taking a turn for the obvious and gimmicky. At one point, Ms. Martínez is made to sing the line “Who has stopped them,” then shout angrily at the audience: “FROM BEING CHILDREN?” But Ms. Martínez, who had a star turn in “Madama Butterfly” at the Metropolitan Opera in 2016, often rose above the quality of the music, with a sound that penetrated the orchestra and chorus without losing an ounce of its heart. Mr. Salonen and the Philharmonia musicians, too, lifted the score, bringing to this oratorio the same energy and enthusiasm they had in a virtually flawless performance of Schoenberg and Bruckner the evening before, and in Stravinsky’s “Firebird” on the second half of Sunday’s concert. And they did sometimes have rich material to work with. The opening section comes to life slowly: at first with Ms. Martínez alone, then accompanying her with a cosmic glow as she almost ritualistically describes a time “before the divide of lands.” As she later contemplates the children swept up in the border crisis, the orchestra is tense, dissonant and unsettling. Mr. López is most creative — and restrained — in the fourth section, “A Dreamer Who Studied Linguistics,” which begins with an eerie buzz that grows like a swarm and, as it reaches a chaotic climax, cuts to silence for an aria about what it’s like to live in silence “with the secret / that I am landless.” Although the vocal line here is lyrical and direct, stormy orchestral interludes suggest inner turmoil. These moments, though, are short-lived. That passage about children is made unfortunately comical by Ms. Martínez’s shouting, later echoed by the choir to drive home loaded words like “killed” and “harm.” The mention of silence in “A Dreamer Who Studied Linguistics” is followed by singers whispering the word “silence.” (We got it.) In future performances, such as one planned for the Houston Symphony, some heavy-handedness could stand to be pruned. Even with those trims, it would still be possible to get swept up in the oratorio’s glorious finale, an ultimately hopeful vision of a world where migration continues — again and again, forever, in a time beyond “lies,” “deceit” and “walls.” "
5c38e1973a125f5075c03f83,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/11/arts/music/new-york-philharmonic-jaarvi-hrusa.html,"The pianist Gerald Moore, one of the great accompanists of the 20th century, called his memoir “Am I Too Loud?” It’s a question members of the New York Philharmonic should ask themselves on a regular basis. Gentlemen of the brass section: I’m talking to you. Conductors might want to pull up a chair, too. The Philharmonic’s sound has taken on a hard edge, disrupting some of music’s most glorious moments. Tutti eruptions that felt crude rather than grand blighted the orchestra’s two most recent programs at David Geffen Hall. On Jan. 3, Paavo Jarvi led Dvorak’s Cello Concerto, a Sibelius tone poem and Ravel’s Suite No. 2 from “Daphnis et Chloé.” This weekend’s program, which opened on Thursday under the direction of Jakub Hrusa, included Prokofiev’s Piano Concerto No. 3 and Rimsky-Korsakov’s “Scheherazade.” In both programs there was much to like, even to be thrilled by. The strings can be a marvel of cohesion and warmth. Individual solos — of the flutist Robert Langevin in the Ravel, or the concertmaster Frank Huang in “Scheherazade” — are exquisitely nuanced. But dynamic peaks tend to ring out harshly aggressive, with a sound that’s big without being full. Put delicately, fortissimos are not this orchestra’s forte. In the Dvorak concerto, the cellist Gautier Capuçon battled valiantly to assert himself against an ensemble that seemed intent on belittling him. His tone sounded tight and strained at first, but over the course of the first movement began to glow; his playing became eloquently assured. This is heroic music that builds pathos and excitement from the contrast of solo cello and large orchestra playing, yes, fortissimo. But while that Italian term translates as “loudest,” brawn should be matched by character. Dvorak marks these moments “grandioso.” They should be an exhilarating amplification of the cello-protagonist. Here, the ensemble obliterated him. In the hard-driving “Danse Générale” that concludes Ravel’s suite, there were more sledgehammer moments in which volume swallowed up color and complexity. (A shame, since the light-dappled opening “Daybreak” movement held glimpses of the Philharmonic’s playing at its most beguiling.) And in the start of the Rimsky-Korsakov on Thursday — this movement marked “maestoso,” or majestically — the huge brass statements burst out with saber-rattling strength but little majesty. The most satisfying part of that evening was the Prokofiev concerto with the ebullient pianist Simon Trpceski, who gave a performance that encompassed cartoonish humor and hushed lyricism. Mr. Hrusa is a charismatic conductor with a particular knack, evident in “Scheherazade,” for minutely shaping a string melody so that an entire section appears to play with the same effortless freedom as a soloist. Mr. Hrusa also managed to husband the dynamic forces in the Rimsky-Korsakov so that the most voluminous louds came near the end. But there, once again, the sound lacked the necessary roundness and texture to support the decibel burn. As the orchestra adapts to its new music director, Jaap van Zweden, who returns to the podium next week, its sound will surely evolve. The ability of a group of musicians to produce earth-shattering loudness with purely acoustic means is one of the joys of classical music, and a selling point in an age in which volume is cheap and controlled by a dial. It’s worth getting these fortissimos right. "

5c9abcd649f0eacbf105f356,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/26/arts/music/james-levine-met-defamation-claims.html,"A judge on Tuesday dismissed all but one of the defamation claims that the conductor James Levine made in a lawsuit he filed against the Metropolitan Opera last year after it had fired him amid allegations of sexual misconduct. The ruling came just over a year after the Met fired Mr. Levine, who had been its music director for four decades and who had recently assumed an emeritus position — making him the biggest classical music star to lose his job during the national reckoning over sexual misconduct. Mr. Levine, who has denied any wrongdoing, sued the Met for breach of contract and defamation; the Met countersued him, accusing Mr. Levine of decades of misconduct and saying that he had violated his duties to the company and harmed the institution. After Justice Andrea Masley of the New York State Supreme Court issued a ruling Tuesday dismissing most of Mr. Levine’s defamation claims, but allowing one to proceed, lawyers representing both Mr. Levine and the Met said that they were pleased. One of the dismissed claims centered on statements that Peter Gelb, the Met’s general manager, made after The New York Times and New York Post published articles in 2017 in which several men accused Mr. Levine of abusing them as teenagers or young men. Mr. Gelb told The Times then that the Met was awaiting the outcome of an investigation it had commissioned, and made reference to “a tragedy for anyone whose life has been affected.” He later wrote to the Met’s supporters, calling the period “a sad moment in the company’s history and a tragedy for anyone whose life may have been affected.” Mr. Levine’s lawsuit claimed those statements were defamatory. Justice Masley disagreed, writing: “The reasonable interpretation of those statements by an average reader in the whole context is that, true or false, defendants were sympathetic to anyone negatively affected or harmed in connection with the accusations; that is, the situation was ‘trag[ic]’ whether the accusers were harmed by alleged conduct or Levine and the Met, Levine’s longtime employer, were harmed by false accusations in the press.” She also dismissed the claims that two other statements were defamatory on the grounds that they were made by the Met’s lawyer in response to Mr. Levine’s lawsuit. One centered on the statement by the lawyer, Bettina B. Plevan, that the Met had conducted “an in-depth investigation” of Mr. Levine “that uncovered credible and corroborated evidence of sexual misconduct during his time at the Met, as well as earlier.” The other was her statement that the Met had made Mr. Levine music director emeritus “when it became obvious that Levine was no longer physically capable of carrying out his duties as music director.” (The company had announced the change in his position in 2016, when Mr. Levine was 72 and having complications related to his Parkinson’s disease.) But Justice Masley found that Mr. Levine could proceed with his claim that a March 12 statement the Met made was defamatory, since it preceded the lawsuit. That statement said that the Met had “uncovered credible evidence that Mr. Levine engaged in sexually abusive and harassing conduct.” Mr. Levine’s lawyer, Edward J.M. Little, a partner at Hughes Hubbard & Reed, said he was pleased the judge had kept what he called “Maestro Levine’s strongest defamation claim.” “The Met didn’t just fire him,” Mr. Little said in a statement. “As we have alleged, it defamed him on the way out after his 50 years of brilliant artistic genius that contributed greatly to what the Met became.” The Met’s lawyer, Ms. Plevan, a partner at Proskauer Rose, said in a statement, “The Metropolitan Opera is pleased that the court dismissed virtually all of the defamation claims filed by James Levine against the Met, including the only claim against Peter Gelb.” The rest of Mr. Levine’s suit is proceeding; there is a conference scheduled for next month.

5c6e91bb3a125f5075c0ac68,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/arts/music/webster-hall-reopening.html,"When the doors open in April at the renovated Webster Hall — the East Village club, once known as the Ritz, that was renowned for its mix of rock shows and raucous dance parties — music fans will find a revamped entryway and lounge, new bathrooms and upgraded acoustics. But the most important change may simply be the arrival of an elevator. Webster Hall, housed in an 1886 building, part of which has been declared a landmark, is a rabbit warren of staircases and anterooms that surround a grand ballroom. But without an elevator, handicapped patrons had to be carried inside and loading equipment was a daily ordeal. “On a regular tour, whatever city they were in, they’d have two or four loaders,” said Jim Glancy of the concert promotion company the Bowery Presents, which is one of the new owners. “At Webster Hall, the minimum would be 12 people.” The new elevator is one of a number of subtle changes meant to bring the club, just off Union Square, up to contemporary standards, reintroducing it to fans and to an industry that has been hungry for a room of its size — the ballroom holds 1,400 people — in a central part of Manhattan. “This room has been needed — we felt its absence,” said Marty Diamond of Paradigm Talent Agency, who booked the club in its 1980s iteration as the Ritz. After an opening night in late April, to be announced, the initial lineup will include Patti Smith on May 1; the D.J. TroyBoi on May 3; Sharon Van Etten on May 4; Broken Social Scene on May 16 and 17; and MGMT from May 22 to 24. Webster Hall, long an independently owned space, was bought two years ago by BSE Global, the parent company of Barclays Center, and the Bowery Presents, which is partly owned by the concert giant AEG, for a price estimated at about $35 million. When the club shut down in August 2017 for renovations, there was an outcry from fans who worried that Webster Hall’s history as a dance mecca and a center of gay night life in New York would be lost. The new owners say they are committed to preserving that tradition, but are still deciding how. “It was a very democratic club that was all about variety, and we intend to bring that variety back when we reopen,” said Keith Sheldon, BSE Global’s executive vice president of programming. On a recent tour of the space, construction was still in full swing, with saws buzzing and workmen lugging armloads of wood. But the changes to the club’s design were clear. Three doors were added to its entrance on East 11th Street — a concession by the Landmarks Preservation Commission — to get people in and out more quickly. On the first floor, the Marlin Room, a former venue-within-a-venue, has been turned into a sleek lounge. Upstairs in the ballroom, acoustic treatments have been added to the walls and ceiling, and some remnants of the dance-party past have been removed, like a monstrous lighting rig that John Moore, one of the Bowery Presents principals, likened to Battlestar Galactica. “It would come down, it would move around; it was very ’80s,” Mr. Moore said, adding that it would be replaced with a more conventional mirror ball. But much of the idiosyncratic grandeur of the room was untouched, like its scalloped balconies, Art Deco wall designs and, above the stage, an old canvas painting of falling balloons. “The vision has always been to maintain the soul, the grit, the history of the venue,” said Brett Yormark, the chief executive of BSE Global. “For fans, they are going to feel like they’re coming home again.” The preserved details are reminders of the remarkable history of Webster Hall, which started as a community social club but, by Prohibition, became known for wild parties. In 1953, it was bought by RCA, which used it as a recording studio for Harry Belafonte, Perry Como and classical giants like Sviatoslav Richter. When the Ritz opened in 1980, it became a center for new wave music, hosting the American debuts of bands like U2 and Depeche Mode. In 1989, the Ritz moved to the former Studio 54 space on West 54th Street, and in 1992, under the new ownership of the Ballinger family, Webster Hall reopened as a club under its own name. When the new partners bought the club, Jay Marciano, the chairman of AEG Presents, the company’s music division, said he expected renovations to cost $10 million. In an interview this week, he laughed at that estimate. “I won’t give a specific number, but it was a multiple of that,” Mr. Marciano said. “Nothing gets done cheaply in New York City.” "

The first original song Sky Ferreira has released since 2013 veers sharply away from the armor-clad pop that filled her first album. But in a way, it’s a segue from that record’s ominous (and atypical) title song, “Night Time, My Time,” by way of the latter-day “Twin Peaks”; she produced the song with the music supervisor for “Twin Peaks,” Dean Hurley. A full minute of a dirgelike string-section instrumental — keening and quivering above, pulsating below — opens “Downhill Lullaby” before Ferreira comes in, singing a chantlike verse in a low, ragged voice: “You leave me open when you hit me/No one can hear you, then you hurt me.” She announced back in 2015 that her next album would be called “Masochism”; this makes clear why. JON PARELES From 1969-72, Joseph Jefferson led a Philadelphia funk band called the Nat Turner Rebellion, which released a few singles — including “Tribute to a Slave” in 1969 — and left an album’s worth of unreleased music in the vaults of Sigma Sound Studios. The first full Nat Turner Rebellion album, “Laugh to Keep from Crying,” has now been compiled by independent archivists and music-business students at Drexel University, which received thousands of tapes from Sigma Sound as a donation. “Tribute to a Slave,” a greeting across eras to the rebel slave Nat Turner, is vintage socially conscious, tambourine-shaking funk. Amid wah-wah guitars and assertive horns, it proclaims, “We ain’t slaves no more.” PARELES Cage the Elephant and Beck made a Twenty One Pilots song. (A good thing!) CARYN GANZ Recently, Lil Uzi Vert announced online that his career was on hold, if not over. What appeared to be a disagreement with his label seemed to be imperiling the release of any new music, including the long-awaited album “Eternal Atake.” In the last couple of days, however, there’s been some movement amid the uncertainty. “Free Uzi” — which his label said was not an official release — made its way to SoundCloud and YouTube, and displayed Uzi at his frenetic best: rapping about a woman “back on my team/ ’cause my neck wet like a squeegee”; alluding to issues with his finances; and confessing to watching “The Big Bang Theory.” JON CARAMANICA Rosalía’s first release since last year’s vivid and clever nu-flamenco album “El Mal Querer” is “Con Altura,” a sweetly melodic reggaeton number featuring a tart and restrained guest verse from J Balvin. The song is impressive, and the video, by Director X, is a riot of colorful outfits, flexible dance, and the confidence that comes with knowing every step you’ve chosen is the right one. CARAMANICA “Hustle” couldn’t bang any more bluntly; it’s three minutes of tightly packed pop escalation. “Don’t hustle me,” Pink berates a guy who “took my love/mistook it for weakness.” Then she restates the line with a blunter word that radio stations and this newspaper won’t use. The swinging beat harks back to rockabilly, and so does Pink’s belted-with-a-grin vocal, but the production expects a minuscule 21st-century attention span, springing a new sound — handclaps, backup voices, gunshots, bell tones, synthetic horns — every four bars if not sooner. It’s as meticulous as it is brash. PARELES Kelly Clarkson and Pink have been working in parallel for almost two decades. In 2017, when both artists had new albums (“Meaning of Life” and “Beautiful Trauma”) they teamed for a cover of R.E.M.’s “Everybody Hurts” at the American Music Awards. Now they’ve collaborated — along with Marshmello and Ed Sheeran’s “Shape of You” team of Johnny McDaid and Steve Mac — on a classic empowerment anthem either of them could have sung. It’s from the forthcoming animated movie “UglyDolls,” in which Clarkson plays a plush toy seeking self-acceptance. Perhaps in the future this duo of powerhouse vocalists and electric live performers will seek a co-headlining arena tour. GANZ As the influence of Nigerian highlife and American funk stretched across West Africa in the 1970s, different cultural traditions found their own ways in. In Benin, Sir Victor Uwaifo became known for rendering the ekassa — a rhythm and dance associated with the coronation of a new king — as a modern sound. On “IIziegbe (Ikassa No. 70),” horns and voices call back to him from across a bed of buoyant bass drum, played on every off-beat. This is one of 12 recently dug-up tracks, all from different artists, released Friday in the latest installment of Strut Records’ “Nigeria 70” series. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO “Put your makeup on, girl, stand up straight/Your face will take you farther than your brain”: The mother figure that haunts “Pretty Shiny Things,” the harrowing and beautiful new single from the country singer Kassi Ashton, is vicious and unapologetic. Ashton paints her with the savage acuity of Miranda Lambert and the lonely sorrow of Julie Roberts, which is to say she’s painful to listen to, but hard to ignore. CARAMANICA Bluesy, fingerpicked electric guitar, and not much else, accompanies Pink Sweats in “I Know,” from the new EP “Vol. 2.” It’s a love song with a streak of desperation — “There must a reason that you’re stealing my soul” — and with a high, mournful vocal, Pink Sweats resigns himself to obsession. PARELES This year’s carnival season in Colombia has ended, but two top Colombian bands extend the party with this collaboration that pools their strengths: deep dancehall-like growls from Systema Solar and the tart lead vocals of Liliana Saumet from Bomba Estéreo, entwined guitars that hint at both cumbia and Congolese pop, busily arpeggiating synthesizers and deep-dive bass lines, even some traditionalist Afro-Colombian drumming. “There will always be Carnival,” the song insists, working to make it true. PARELES Secret Machines, one of the best trios of the aughts, released a live album this week that was recorded in 2006 at the Garage in London. “Nowhere Again” is from the group’s thundering, ominous 2004 debut, “Now Here Is Nowhere,” but the band played it a bit poppier at this show shortly before the release of its second LP, “Ten Silver Drops.” A year later, the guitarist Benjamin Curtis left the band to focus on another project, School of Seven Bells. He died from lymphoma in 2013 and documents of his time in Secret Machines with his brother, the keyboardist and singer Brandon, and the drummer Josh Garza are very valuable. GANZ A tenacious 5/4 pulse propels “Crow’s Perch” through a slew of post-punk transformations in just four minutes: from muffled bass line through sparse, almost jazzy ballad, through brittle patterns and strangulated one-syllable vocal lines, through a briefly restrained spoken-word passage on the way to a crashing, shouting, dissonant peak. It’s math-rock confronting a world of chaos. PARELES Betty Carter was jazz’s quintessential modernist: She liked to tease and stretch a classic melody until it was almost misshapen, testing her elastic instinct against the structure of a piece. In this live recording, captured at Lincoln Center in 1992 during the heady final years of her career, Carter sings “If I Should Lose You” in duet with the young pianist Geri Allen. The accompanist treats the song with her own sense of passionate restraint, collapsing its harmonies at the center, as if to represent the song’s fraught, nearly fatalist romanticism. A record of the concert has just been released on CD by Blue Engine Records, Jazz at Lincoln Center’s in-house label. RUSSONELLO "
5c991d7649f0eacbf105ef1b,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/25/arts/music/juice-wrld-ariana-grande-billboard.html,"Juice WRLD, the 20-year-old singing rapper of the moment, is spending a second straight week atop the Billboard 200 chart with his new album, “Death Race for Love,” thanks to a slow period for major music releases. No new albums reached the Top 150 this week, leaving the streaming success of “Death Race” (Grade A/Interscope) in the No. 1 spot with a total of 74,000 units by the industry’s math, combining streams and sales. In Juice WRLD’s case, just 3,800 album sales were lifted by 106 million song streams, according to Nielsen, outpacing the runner-up, Ariana Grande’s “Thank U, Next” (Republic). In its sixth week on the chart, Grande’s second album in six months added another 78 million streams and 6,400 in sales, for a total of 66,000 units. The rest of the Top 5 has been hanging around for some time. Though it had the highest sales total of the week (about 16,000), the soundtrack to “A Star Is Born” (Interscope) held steady at No. 3 with 40,000 units in its 24th go-round on the Billboard chart. A Boogie Wit da Hoodie’s “Hoodie SZN” was carried to the No. 4 spot by 50 million streams in its 13th week, while the Queen soundtrack to the biopic “Bohemian Rhapsody” is No. 5 in its 22nd week.

5c44f58a3a125f5075c056a4,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/20/arts/music/review-cantata-profana.html,"Imagine a Renaissance-era nun, a mystic in the throes of dying, uttering her visions and predictions in sporadic, rapid-fire bursts while novices stand guard trying to understand and write down her words. This is believed to be what happened to Saint Maria Maddalena de’ Pazzi, who died in Florence in 1607. The Italian modernist composer Salvatore Sciarrino suggests what the extraordinary ritual must have been like in his hushed, twitchy and radically spare-textured “Infinito Nero: Estasi di un Atto” for soprano and eight instruments, composed in 1998. The excellent and adventurous young musicians of Cantata Profana gave a rare and quietly riveting performance of Mr. Sciarrino’s strange piece on Friday at St. Peter’s Church in Chelsea. Since 2013, Cantata Profana has been presenting shows, as they call them, which are often semi-staged and typically juxtapose very old and very new music. The players placed Mr. Sciarrino’s piece at the end of an 80-minute meditative show they titled “Visions of Silence.” To set the mood, the pianist Daniel Schlosberg played Alvin Lucier’s Music for Piano and Amplified Sonorous Vessels (1990), a piece in which intermittent, mostly soft, minimal piano sounds (single struck tones or intervals, wandering chords, fleeting squiggles of notes) are electronically refracted, prolonged or processed. This led to a Tarquinio Merula canzonetta for soprano and lute. In this short 1636 duo, the Virgin Mary (soprano Alice Teyssier) holds the baby Jesus in her arms, trying to get the restless infant to sleep, though she is overcome with premonitions of the suffering that awaits him. The lute (played by the fine Arash Noori) is curiously fixated on two notes, though these recurring pitches are often decorated with filigree. Next came the Russian composer Galina Ustvolskaya’s radically unconventional Symphony No. 5, “Amen” (1989), lasting just 15 minutes and scored for a curious ensemble: violin, oboe, trumpet, tuba, big wooden box and a speaker (Gleb Kanasevich), who says the Lord’s Prayer in Russian. The music is at once grave and grumpy, utterly serious and almost comic, swinging along in a foursquare meter like some slow march with a steady tread, each thematic note encrusted in a dour harmonic block. Then Mr. Noori returned to play Alessandro Piccinini’s “Toccata Cromatica” for solo lute (1623), a work in which lyrical strands spin out into soft-spoken swirling passagework. Ms. Teyssier was the compelling soloist, singing Maria Maddalena, in the Sciarrino piece, which over 30 taut minutes tries to evoke the scene of the mystic nun issuing her clipped bursts of words. The instrumentalists become her eight attentive novices, sitting for long stretches doing nothing, or just breathing in anticipation (the sounds of, say, a flutist playing a short tone then audibly inhaling), or sometimes muttering some jittery, quiet mini-phrase. Then Ms. Teyssier’s Maria would sing a frenzied burst of pent-up notes, and the instruments would scurry, trying to scribble down her words. Jacob Ashworth, Cantata Profana’s artistic director, conducted a suspenseful account of this radically episodic and spacey score. The audience in pews sat in almost complete darkness; the players were illuminated by theatrical lighting, so you had to give yourself over to this contemplative program, even when you could not read the translations of texts, even if you lost track of what piece was being played. A large and appreciative audience seemed ready to do so on a chilly Friday in a Chelsea sanctuary. "

Let us know at theplaylist@nytimes.com and sign up for our Louder newsletter, a once-a-week blast of our pop music coverage. The fuzztone is cranked way up on “Lo/Hi,” the first Black Keys song since 2014. It’s the kind of garage-boogie stomp that the band never left behind. Singing about desperate loneliness and 180-degree mood swings, the Black Keys reach back to a late-1960s combination of primordial three-chord simplicity (hinting at Norman Greenbaum’s “Spirit in the Sky”) and overdubs galore. Between the group handclaps, a gang of guitars and the whooping, wailing backup vocals, it’s a far cry from the early Black Keys’ two-man-band austerity — but with the old wallop intact. JON PARELES A folky waltz tells the story of an adolescent romance, deploying details with a concision akin to Paul Simon: “Morrissey apologists, amateur psychologists, serial monogamists, we went to different colleges.” There’s no happy ending, and Phoebe Bridgers’s production surrounds the acoustic guitars with distant, shadowy strings that hint at the song’s higher stakes. PARELES Lauren Mayberry, frontwoman of the Scottish band Chvrches, has a voice that’s tart, serrated and soaring — it cleanly pierces through everything around it. That makes it a sleek, albeit unexpected, complement to the production of Marshmello, whose music is restlessly and relentlessly dopey. On “Here With Me,” Mayberry is a beacon of reason, singing with ramrod posture while the song wiggles and wobbles behind her. JON CARAMANICA “And I haven’t lost my mind thinking about you/And I haven’t lost my breath shouting all the things we’re about to do,” sings Helado Negro — Roberto Carlos Lange — in “Pais Nublado” (“Clouded Nation”), a subdued bossa nova with an electronic penumbra from his new album “This Is How You Smile.” His songs are often bilingual in English and Spanish and built on electronic underpinnings, though “This Is How You Smile” welcomes acoustic guitar as well. The album muses on desire, Latinx identity, change and rhythm, hinting at places where history and politics have intimate repercussions. PARELES The drummer and composer Kendrick Scott will release an album next month titled “A Wall Becomes a Bridge,” featuring his long-running quintet Oracle (plus the turntablist Jahi Sundance on about half the tracks). Scott invests seriously in the ancient ideal of music as a healing force, and the notion that through focus and attunement, he might create sounds that resonate with our particular moment. He’s one of more consistent bandleaders in instrumental music today, with original music that feels consequential and distinguished in spite of its adherence to an airtight, contemporary-jazz aesthetic. With Joe Sanders on bass, Mike Moreno on guitar, Taylor Eigsti on Fender Rhodes and John Ellis on soprano saxophone, Oracle douses your ear in textures that are thick but aerodynamic, and on “‘>>>>>>>>>>>Mocean” Ellis’s liquid melody cuts against Scott’s constant patter, feeding the band two different kinds of fuel. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO Why wouldn’t the guitar on “Who Shot Cupid?” rest somewhere between flamenco, new age and early emo? Juice WRLD has become one of the most promising figures in hip-hop by almost completely dismantling the genre’s usual structures. That’s plain throughout his new album “Death Race for Love,” but the thickly layered moaning vocals on this song — “All the drugs I did, they weren’t worth it/now I'm worthless/I hope my new lady thinks I'm perfect” — show just how far Juice WRLD is able to bend hip-hop, turning it into something soft, interior and elegiac. CARAMANICA An album of newly unearthed recordings by the Texan songwriter Townes Van Zandt (1944-1997) rightfully makes “Sky Blue,” a previously unknown song, its title track. It’s a terse, low-fi, solo, fingerpicked glimpse of chronic despair: “No good reason to be livin’/Been lookin’ high and low,” he sings. PARELES In his decade-long country music career, Justin Moore has been rabble-rousing and retrograde, a stern guy and a goof. Finally, he’s found a song that captures both sides of his duality. “Jesus and Jack Daniels” is delivered with a smear of Randy Travis stoicism — mom parents via the good book, and dad via the bottle: “When we messed up she’d fill us up/with the scripture and a Baptist hymn/and she’d pray we’d be a little more like her and a whole lot less like him.” CARAMANICA The music is an elegantly melancholy bolero. But the words to “Temes” (“You Fear”) are a challenge, defying a machismo that pretends to be romantic but is actually about maintaining power, sometimes violently. “If my freedom is your dispossession/and my body is the recipient of your whim/If my shadow is behind your figure/Why do you fear me?” iLe (Ileana Mercedes Cabra Joglar) sings. And in the desolate video clip, she pulls herself together after a sexual assault. PARELES Backed by Soundwalk Collective, Patti Smith recites dire words by Antonin Artaud about how “A mortal folly comes over the world.” Her tone is steadfast, as if partaking in a ritual; she sings like a stoic lullaby when she reaches the lines, “Here where the mother eats her sons/Power eats Power: Short of war, no stability.” Around her, Sound Collective constructs a pyre of creaky, echoey fiddle lines and drumbeats that build to an apocalyptic rumble. PARELES Like many of Carla Bley’s melodies, the tune to “Ida Lupino” is a simple, songlike thread, snaking through a set of chord changes that gradually tweak the pressure around it, thickening the air and then letting things go slack again. On this version, by the young jazz combo Lioness, Amanda Monaco daubs at single notes on her guitar, painting little shapes around the alto saxophonist Alexa Tarantino’s dewy, unhurried treatment of the melody. Underneath, the drummer Allison Miller keeps a steady beat going, hardly deviating from her cool, eighth-note pattern, even when sparks momentarily start to fly. RUSSONELLO "

Let us know at theplaylist@nytimes.com and sign up for our Louder newsletter, a once-a-week blast of our pop music coverage. The music struts while the lyrics bristle in “King James,” from Anderson .Paak’s album due in April, “Ventura.” The springy bass line and jazzy chords reach back to the analog exuberance of 1970s Stevie Wonder, and like Wonder, Anderson .Paak fuses an optimistic sound with a spirit of determined resistance, alluding to a jumping over wall, Colin Kaepernick and deep-seated racial hostility. As party whistles blow, an exuberant chorus joins him to sing, “O.K. now, just don’t stay down/Let’s go shake down until we get what we need.” JON PARELES A conceptual tour-de-force that lands with the force of a dance track, Holly Herndon’s “Eternal” is as propulsive as it is disorienting. She built it with other human singers and with artificial-intelligence software that manipulated her own vocals all over the place. A choir of women’s voices, harmonizing and ricocheting in counterpoint that could be Balkan or extraterrestrial, heaves above a booming drumbeat and bursts of synthesizer, landing hard together and then veering apart, with barely intelligible lyrics that clear for phrases like “too much to be contained.” The video shows Herndon crowned in motion-capture sensors and other women’s faces flickering in and out of focus, as software struggles to digitize and contain the complexities of flesh. PARELES Sean Paul, from Jamaica, and J Balvin, from Colombia, are both masters of the crossover-building strategic alliance. “Contra la Pared” (“Against the Wall”) is a canny, skeletal, all-hook production (by Tainy) that puts Paul squarely on Balvin’s turf. It tops a lean reggaeton beat with flute sounds from Colombia’s Andean traditions, as the two men take turns — with Balvin’s smooth croon and Paul’s rough declamation — exulting in how irresistible he is to a certain woman. Paul switches between English and Spanish; he’s got an eye on changing pop demographics. PARELES Angelique Kidjo’s next album, due April 19, will be “Celia,” a tribute to the Afro-Cuban singer Celia Cruz, and she’s not shying away from any challenges. “Quimbara” was one of Cruz’s signature songs in the 1970s, with high-speed, tongue-twisting lyrics. Backed by Michelle Ndegeocello on bass, the Afrobeat pioneer Tony Allen on drums, Dominic James on guitars and the Gangbe Brass Band, Kidjo reconnects the salsa original to West Africa, layering the song with a tumbling six-beat rhythm, a brass-band undertow and a tangle of scurrying guitar lines while she belts with enough grit to rival Cruz herself. PARELES RuthAnne Cunningham, an Irish singer and songwriter credited on hits from JoJo, Britney Spears and Westlife, uses vintage soul materials for “Love Again.” She tops the sturdy gospel chords from “People Get Ready” (and countless other songs) with a familiar pop premise: that her love can rescue a man from his heartbroken misery. There’s an aching, unpredictable rawness in her voice that makes the classic plea work one more time. PARELES Dwight Trible’s big, open baritone might sound to you like a wake-up call, or an entire universe yawning. (You won’t be yawning yourself.) He sings spiritual jazz with a light redolence of Andy Bey, and a heap of gospel’s influence. By now he’s considered an elder on the Los Angeles jazz scene, and in addition to running one of the city’s most influential community venues he has figured prominently into both of Kamasi Washington’s most recent albums; he’s also a member of in Pharoah Sanders’ band. Trible’s 2017 solo album, “Inspirations,” was unjustly overlooked — hopefully the same won’t be true of “Mothership,” out Friday. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO Kindly sentiments — “I never want to see you cry/I only want to see you shine” — arrive amid frantic rhythms in “Frens” by Obongjayar, a Nigerian singer and songwriter based in England whose voice puts a hoarse urgency atop a gentle core. Rooted in Afrobeat, the track pulls drums, bells, guitars, horns and more into a feverish affirmation that ends too soon. PARELES Charli XCX’s 2014 album “Sucker” was a fistful of sassy, punky pop. And while the British singer and songwriter has been steadily moving away from that sound in her own work, there’s still a spot for it in her heart — and on her Vroom Vroom Recordings label imprint. Enter Nasty Cherry, a four-piece band whose first track, “Win,” was co-written by Charli and produced by Justin Raisen, who contributed to “Sucker” as well as Sky Ferreira’s like-minded 2013 LP “Night Time, My Time.” The vibe is ’90s angst rock welded to a Sia-esque chorus, and it is indeed a winner. CARYN GANZ A chronicle of multiple romances and/or obsessions, from childhood crush to high-school infatuation to post-breakup rationalizations, “Never (Let You Go)” is two or three songs in five minutes by Deanté Hitchcock, an Atlanta rapper who sometimes slips into singing. Behind him, a slinky trap track segues into an even slower vamp that carries breathlessly accelerating but crafty rhymes: “Can’t waste my time thinkin’ ’bout all the time wasted.” His lyrics conclude, “I learned to let you go,” followed by an instrumental coda on solo piano, a quiet elegy to all the tumult. PARELES Frankie Cosmos is releasing two tracks each week from her digital album “Haunted Items,” beginning with “Dancing” and “Tunnel.” They are miniatures, less than two minutes each, and decidedly bare-bones: just her voice, elementary piano parts and an occasional overdubbed harmony vocal. Obliquely and then with startling directness, both songs consider a broken relationship: “I cry more times a day/than you did in five years,” she suddenly reveals in “Dancing.” PARELES A “duet” for a hologram world: Here’s an exhumed recording of Nat King Cole, who would have been 100 this week, with Gregory Porter’s voice dubbed in. The track begins with the two trading lines over a simple, two-beat rhythm — nice enough — but when Porter tries to weave new harmonies and ad-libs into Cole’s solo part, it all comes undone. RUSSONELLO Vijay Iyer and Craig Taborn represent two different kinds of musical progressives. Both are pianists associated with the avant-garde, but Taborn, whose playing is more ephemeral, is a spectral figure, rarely spotted around the scene unless he’s playing a gig. Iyer seems constantly in the world, leading new bands and curating concert series, snapping up awards, teaching at Harvard and Banff. Each pianist, in his own way, has become about as respected as one can get in jazz. On a new disc, “The Transitory Poems,” they balance each other’s styles, Iyer playing the naturalist and the system-builder to Taborn’s fleeting, fugitive poet. On “Clear Monolith,” a sparse and jittery start gives way to a halting dance before a blues feeling steals in and pulls the two players together. By about the 5:30 mark, they’re playing more notes but sounding more serene. Then it all drops down again, and a new cycle begins. RUSSONELLO "
5c3a4da03a125f5075c04192,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/11/arts/anthony-braxton-composer.html,"Anthony Braxton retired from academia in 2013, but at 73, he is far from idle. That much is clear when I recently walked into his apartment in Connecticut, a couple of dozen miles away from Wesleyan University, where he taught for more than two decades. After shaking my hand and taking my coat, this composer and saxophonist — a MacArthur “genius” grant winner, an N.E.A. Jazz Master and an eminence in improvisation and contemporary composition — showed me into a small but comfortable study, stacked with reams of large-format score pages. This was “Trillium L,” the next opera in his long-gestating cycle of works for the stage. Each act of a “Trillium” opera tells a different story, while using the same cast of singers, who rotate roles. Playing with stock genres — including elements of gangster noir, futuristic dystopia and cutthroat boardroom intrigue — has given Mr. Braxton the chance to explore ideas regarding cultural progress (or lack thereof). But gonzo, satirical humor often leavens the fundamental seriousness, in both sound and word. A previous four-act opera in the series, “Trillium J,” made a memorable impression when it was performed at Roulette, in Brooklyn, in 2014. (It is available in a variety of audio and video formats.) Since then, Mr. Braxton has completed “Trillium X,” which his Tri-Centric Foundation, devoted to supporting his work, hopes to record soon. He has spent much of the last four years on “Trillium L,” writing the libretto and coming up with rhythms for the singers and “guide tones” — essentially a floor of drone pitches — that will undergird the orchestral writing. The meat of the orchestration will come soon, now that those basic parameters have been set. “The first story is about Ashton Downs,” he said, turning over the initial pages of the score. “My new hero.” Having glanced at the lengthy libretto, I mentioned that this character seems like a striking addition to the Braxton operatic canon: a secret agent gifted in karate. “He’s gonna beat the spit out of James Bond, in the future,” Mr. Braxton joked, using a saltier word. “That’s when I’ll make my money.” “By the way,” he added, “this is a five-day opera.” He smiled knowingly when I mentioned that “Sonntag aus Licht” — the final opera by one of his heroes, Karlheinz Stockhausen — occasionally takes two days to perform. (There may be an aspect of cheerful one-upmanship going on here.) Mr. Braxton admitted that he did not know whether “Trillium L” would ever be performed. But he is determined to finish it, and soon. Other ambitious projects are closer to being realized. Later this month, Mr. Braxton’s label is releasing a 12-album set of his “Syntactical Ghost Trance Music.” Given the title “GTM (Syntax) 2017,” the set offers a revelatory new perspective on a series of works that once occupied him. Originally inspired by classes Mr. Braxton took on Native American ritual music, his early “Ghost Trance Music” pieces — like Composition No. 181, from 1995 — featured purposely wandering, seemingly unending single-line melodies that unfurled with a pulsing, meditative quality. “I discovered there’s a trance music coming from every direction, and every ethnic group,” he said. “And I found myself feeling that not only did I love this music, but it was relevant for me. I had come to a point where ‘intellectual interesting’ was not what I was looking for.” In later “Ghost Trance” pieces, rat-a-tat subdivisions of select beats started to interfere with this even-keel patterning. (Mr. Braxton described this as “pulses with abruption.”) By the time of Composition No. 340, in the mid-2000s, these abruptions had multiplied. Graphic notation elements, including some vivid, color-coded schemes, became nearly as prominent as the melody. Along with some of Mr. Braxton’s other conceptual strategies — like “secondary material” at the end of a composition that could be inserted throughout a performance — he increasingly emphasized the possibility of miasmatic swirl. Yet even at its most raucous, the “Ghost Trance” catalog radiates joy and good humor. In the new box set, 12 vocalists tackle “Ghost Trance” styles from a decade-long compositional span — giving a relatively fleet tour of their variety. (The ensemble will perform at Roulette on Jan. 25.) “For me the ‘Syntactical Ghost Trance’ compositions give insight into the expansion of the system, moving from sonics into signals into ritual,” Mr. Braxton said. “It involves people suddenly coming together in communities. The art of the relationship. How to deal with each other.” Several of the singers are veterans of past “Trillium” performances, and it shows. When realizing some of the more extreme qualities of Mr. Braxton’s writing — like the hailstorm of sci-fi-style syllables that make up the “syntax” of these particular “Ghost Trance” pieces — the ensemble’s nimbleness and warmth suggest a highly caffeinated updating of Gregorian chant. And the vocalists’ collective understanding of Mr. Braxton’s flexible performance instructions makes the set an exciting document not only of “Ghost Trance Music,” but of his processes in general. As in his widely celebrated, jazz-inspired quartet music from the 1980s, Mr. Braxton is keen to have different compositions layered atop one another. “One of the areas that interests me is taking stable logics and changing it into mutable logics,” he said. “Taking mutable logics and changing it into stable logics. Improvisation becomes composition. Composition becomes improvisation.” During a new performance of Composition No. 220, the vocal troupe responds to this invitation by inserting the bebop-like melody from Composition No. 85, from 1978. Not long after, that vintage melody slips underneath new Composition No. 220 motifs. As a result, music from different decades intermingles amiably — and gives a sense of the vast interpretive possibilities that subsequent generations of artists might yet bring to Mr. Braxton’s catalog. The rush of invention here captures an idea from his “system notes” for “Ghost Trance Music”: “past, present and future as one unit.” As he drove us to a nearby Ruby Tuesday for dinner, Mr. Braxton emphasized that the Tri-Centric Foundation is not devoted only to his work. He mentioned a recent orchestral recording by the saxophonist Ingrid Laubrock, a frequent collaborator of his, and noted with pride that an earlier performance of some of that material was presented by the Tri-Centric Orchestra. Close associates of Mr. Braxton run the foundation and administer his label, New Braxton House. You can’t find the label on any streaming service. But the entirety of his self-released material has recently appeared on the Bandcamp platform, where impulse buyers can pick among individual projects, or acquire the whole digital catalog at a 25-percent discount. That price naturally changes every time Mr. Braxton adds an 11-plus-hour recording to the mix. But at present, you can acquire more than 100 hours of his work for around $700. (That includes solo-saxophone sets, electroacoustic music, orchestral recordings and several 4-act “Trillium” operas — as well as nearly a dozen hours of Mr. Braxton’s ecstatic 1990s dive into the music of Charlie Parker.) The Tri-Centric team is currently looking for additional donors — and album purchasers — to help with the cost of making more of Mr. Braxton’s scores and writings available. A raft of performances is being prepared to honor his 75th birthday, in 2020. And Tri-Centric also has ambitions to produce more recordings of various projects, including the “Trillium” operas. Mr. Braxton wants it all to go on, even after his writing ends. “I have real hope that New Braxton House can somehow fight for its life,” he said. But he quickly added: “I am not ready to retire. And so I’ve got some cards up my sleeve.” Keeping his eyes on the road ahead of him, he said, “This dog is not finished.” "

Some of the programs, announced this week, will be familiar to Korngold fans — including a semi-staged production of his most popular opera, “Die Tote Stadt,” and excerpts from his Oscar-winning score for “The Adventures of Robin Hood.” Others concerts will feature rarer fare. There will be a performance of Korngold’s Concerto in C sharp for piano, left hand, which he wrote in 1923 for the pianist Paul Wittgenstein, who lost an arm in World War I. And Bard will present the American premiere of Korngold’s 1927 opera “The Miracle of Heliane” (“Das Wunder der Heliane”) in production by Christian Räth, with Leon Botstein, Bard’s president, conducting the American Symphony Orchestra (which he also leads) and the tenor Daniel Brenna. The full Bard performance series, Bard SummerScape, will run from June 29 through Aug. 18 at the college’s campus in Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., culminating during its final two weekends with “Korngold and His World,” the 30th season of the Bard Music Festival. In addition to its Korngold programs, Bard will present Michael Gordon’s B-movie-theme opera “Acquanetta”; and “Grace and Mercy,” by the choreographer Ronald K. Brown, with live music by Meshell Ndegeocello. "

I dare you. The two musicians — he’s a superstar cellist, she’s our leading pipa player — seem at first like an odd couple. Mr. Ma plays with brazen emotionality; you get the impression he couldn’t pull off a poker face if he tried. Ms. Wu, calm and unshowy, casts a quiet spell as she gracefully plucks the strings of her lutelike instrument. But they exude amiability, with jolly glances frequently thrown back and forth, and unexpected compatibility. The cello and pipa have vastly different sounds and histories. Yet together, in the hands of Mr. Ma and Ms. Wu, they are as intimately harmonious as a cafe singer and guitarist. At David Geffen Hall through Saturday, they’re playing Zhao Lin’s double concerto “A Happy Excursion,” which had its American premiere on Wednesday with the New York Philharmonic under the direction of Long Yu. (And how refreshing to hear a work by a Chinese composer outside the Philharmonic’s annual Lunar New Year concert.) Mr. Lin’s crowd-pleasing concerto begins with a blossoming soundscape that gives way to increasing bustle and, eventually, a lushly cinematic swell that reaches its climax with brass fanfare and crashing cymbals. The soloists evoke characters: Ms. Wu’s pipa on a merry walk, matched by Mr. Ma’s bouncing, buoyant down-bow strokes. The second movement retreats from the excitement with a misty opening, like quiet daybreak. Over spare orchestration, the pipa plays a slow and simple melody inspired by a 1,200-year-old Chinese tune. But in the finale, we return to the commotion of the first movement, now less stable and more unpredictable, the way a busy city’s streets can change suddenly from block to block. All too predicable, however, is the majestic ending — but it’s easy to forgive Mr. Lin’s heavy hand while swept up in the filmic grandeur and sparkling cheer of Mr. Ma and Ms. Wu. “A Happy Excursion” had a fitting companion in Tchaikovsky’s emotive “Pathétique” Symphony. The Philharmonic musicians can probably play this overprogrammed piece in their sleep; in the past, it has occasionally felt as if they were doing just that. But under Mr. Yu’s baton, they summoned surprising extremes, leavened occasionally with the brisk lightness of a Tchaikovsky ballet. Like Mahler’s Ninth Symphony, which the Vienna Philharmonic was playing on Wednesday evening at Carnegie Hall, the “Pathétique” has an unusual form of four movements in slow-fast-fast-slow progression. Mr. Yu seemed to approach it as program music, finding a long arc in the work’s adagio bookends. So much so that he hampered applause — which New York audiences typically delight in — between the third and fourth movements. He was aiming for a startling juxtaposition, of a rapid plunge from the deceptive bliss of the scherzo to the profound despair of the Adagio Lamentoso. This was a slow finale with high stakes, darkly commanding attention to the very end of a concert that had begun, two hours before, so joyously. "
5c40987c3a125f5075c04ec9,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/arts/music/maggie-rogers-heard-it-in-a-past-life.html,"LOS ANGELES — A few Tuesdays ago, the 24-year-old singer-songwriter Maggie Rogers’s single “Light On” displaced Mumford & Sons’ “Guiding Light” at the top of the first Billboard adult alternative songs chart of 2019 — one of the publication’s niche charts, but something she could get jazzed about all the same, if she let herself. “My parents are really excited,” she said hours after the news broke, huddled beneath a heat lamp on the back patio of a restaurant on Silver Lake Boulevard. “But they don’t know what it means either. They were like, ‘Are you excited? We don’t know if we’re supposed to be excited.’” Rogers wasn’t quite sure either. She started out as a banjo-slinging folkie, but broke through with songs like “Alaska” and “On + Off,” whose sonic textures reflected her growing interest in electronic dance music and mainstream pop. Perhaps appropriately, she has both a folkie’s suspicion of airplay charts and No. 1 hits as markers of artistic success and a pop star’s understanding of self-promotion as a job requirement. After some internal debate about whether to note the news on social media at all, she posted a tweet that included a string of exclamation points but began with the word “WHAAAAATTT” — celebratory, yet noncommittal. [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] In photographs, Rogers brings to mind a millennial version of Sissy Spacek circa “Badlands” crossed with Lana Del Rey; what the pictures don’t capture is the articulate intensity she exhibits in conversation, especially when she talks about re-establishing control over her career after an unexpected brush with viral fame — a moment that led to labels knocking down her door, but one she ultimately found quite destabilizing. Her third album and first on a major label, “Heard It in a Past Life,” is due on Friday. Rogers grew up in rural Easton, Md. Her father is a now-retired Ford dealer; her mother, a former nurse who introduced Rogers to Erykah Badu and Alanis Morissette, now works as an end-of-life doula. Rogers was writing songs by age 13; at 17, she produced and self-released her debut album, “The Echo,” which channeled the pastoral spirit of early Bon Iver and Sufjan Stevens. The demos for that record helped her secure admission to the Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music at New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts. In New York, she played in multiple bands and “overdosed on live music”; during a semester abroad, she visited clubs in Paris and Berlin and fell in love with house and techno. During this time, she also found herself unable to write songs, even as graduation loomed and her music-production classes demanded it. “All my teachers were really frustrated with me,” she said. She began seriously considering a career in music journalism as a fallback; she interned at Spin and Elle and worked as an editorial assistant to the writer Lizzy Goodman, transcribing hundreds of hours of interviews with the leading lights of the early 2000s New York indie-rock boom for Goodman’s oral history “Meet Me in the Bathroom.” Then in March 2016, during the second semester of Rogers’s senior year, Pharrell Williams — an artist-in-residence at N.Y.U. at the time — visited her music-production class to critique student work. Rogers brought a demo of “Alaska,” on which her supple soprano bobs and weaves over a sparse shuffle beat that brings to mind Williams’s own work with producing partner Chad Hugo as the Neptunes. In a video that subsequently blew up online Rogers plays her demo for Williams, whose face contorts in surprise and delight while he listens. “I’ve never heard anyone like you before,” he tells her afterward. “That’s a drug for me.” Coming from Williams — a category-killing industry icon who’s worked with Migos and Ed Sheeran, indelibly stamping his imprint on 2000s pop as well as hip-hop — this was a career-making endorsement. But it wasn’t one Rogers had sought out, and she says now that she was unprepared for the attention that came with it. “As a producer, as a songwriter, I’ve spent a lot of time either in my bedroom or in studios, alone,” she says. “Suddenly I was in the public eye in this way that I had absolutely no control over. It was really scary.” She compared processing that video with a more recent broadcast moment: her early November appearance previewing her new album on “Saturday Night Live,” which was met with a mixed response. “This thing happens when you’re like grossly overstimulated, your memory changes,” she said. “It’s the same reason why I haven’t watched any of my S.N.L. performances. It’s just, like, I want to keep that for me. And I realized from the Pharrell stuff when you watch it back it changes your memory. And I want to really protect the way I’m remembering things.” “Heard It in a Past Life” is a collection of buoyant electronic pop songs, but the lyrics are unmistakably the work of an introvert struggling to recalibrate. “Oh, I couldn’t stop it,” she sings on “Light On.” “Tried to slow it all down/Crying in the bathroom, had to figure it out/With everyone around me saying ‘You must be so happy now.’” The first line of the opening song, “Give a Little,” is “If I was who I was before”; the last track is a triumphant ballad called “Back in My Body.” Rogers is not coy about the work’s autobiographical component; she describes the album as an attempt to process everything she’s experienced since 2016 and take back control of the narrative around her career. “Part of success is having a good story, and as a journalist I totally understand,” she said. “But it meant that my many, many years of focus and hard work got kind of prepackaged into a Cinderella story. I’m super grateful that it happened, but it left me feeling like I never got to be a full human in the experience.” After the Pharrell video caught fire, Rogers quickly found herself the focus of an old-fashioned record-company bidding war; one prospective label wooed her with her a first edition of Virginia Woolf’s “To the Lighthouse.” Rogers took a hard-nosed approach to this courtship process. Many of the executives hoping to sign her were industry veterans who had been mentioned or interviewed in Goodman’s book; before meeting them, Rogers cross-referenced their names in her database of transcripts. “I would show up with ammo,” she said. “Really minute stories from their lives, like where they were on 9/11, or that time they tried to sign the Killers in 2007. And during these interviews, inevitably, when I was the only woman in the room and these men started talking over me, I would pull out these stories and people would look at me like they’d seen a ghost.” Rogers eventually signed to Capitol and an EP, “Now That the Light Is Fading,” appeared in 2017. But she did insist on taking a bit more time with a full-length album — a decision that challenged, but didn’t discourage, her new label home. “Ultimately we trusted her, because nobody knows her better than herself,” said Michelle Jubelirer, the chief operating officer of Capitol Music Group. “It became very clear early on that there was a lot more to her than a viral moment — that she was an artist with a real soul, and something to say, and a modern pop star with a strong female point of view.” Rogers found promoting the EP psychologically draining. She’d studied branding and marketing at N.Y.U., but branding and marketing herself was a different challenge. Even when interviewers complimented “Alaska” by telling her “I love that song Pharrell made for you,” Rogers felt obligated to be polite. She remembers feeling like she’d allowed a “cocktail party version of myself” to take over. “I became pleasant,” she said, which was not the goal. “The only thing I wanted to do in my music is be human, and communicate all the aspects of that, which often means being vulnerable. Those are the kinds of artists I’ve looked up to and the kinds of artists I’ve worked really hard to be like. Being pleasant is great, but it’s not the whole picture.” “The Pharrell video cut my body and soul in half,” she added. (Her tone suggested that this experience had been painful, but also on some level fascinating.) “I felt such an intense sense of displacement, and I’m only now to a place where I can like breathe normally again and start to relax and remember who I was before this.” "
5c5dd2da3a125f5075c08c5d,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/08/arts/music/new-york-philharmonic-tan-dun-brahms-review.html,"Of all the things that inspire music, one of the most paradoxically productive is death. Whether the sounds it brings forth are meant to console, to offer catharsis, or to build a bridge to the soul of the departed, common to all is a refusal to accept that definitive silence. Funerary music was at the heart of two very different programs at the New York Philharmonic this week. A glittering Lunar New Year gala on Wednesday, conducted by Kahchun Wong, included the American premiere of a violin concerto by Tan Dun called “Fire Ritual.” On Thursday, the orchestra’s music director, Jaap van Zweden, led a burnished reading of Brahms’s “A German Requiem.” Vastly unalike, both works are full of luminous color and reflect complex attitudes toward death. Brahms wrote his “German Requiem” during a period in which he suffered the loss of his mother, and not long after the death of his friend Robert Schumann. Comfort, sadness and faith in an afterlife free of suffering are interwoven in this sprawling work for chorus, soloists and orchestra. The opening chorus can’t quite seem to settle on a key or mood, and in the march of the second movement, the pulse is shared between the stern timpani and gentle harp. In the choir, too, the stentorian seriousness of the men singing a line from Peter, “For all flesh is as grass,” is answered by the women in a more pliable, folk-song-like style. If this music were a funerary wreath, it would be woven from meadow flowers rather than stiff chrysanthemums. [Culture Calendar: NYC’s most anticipated cultural events]  On Thursday, Mr. van Zweden was attentive to these nuances, drawing subtle and flexible playing from the orchestra. In the fugal passages, where the specter of Bach flickers through, he showed a patient eye for the overarching structure. In the excellent Concert Chorale of New York, meticulously prepared by James Bagwell, the men especially impressed with ringing, muscular fortes. The baritone Matthias Goerne brought mystery and intensity to his solos, while the soprano Ying Fang sang “Ihr habt nun Traurigkeit” (“You now have sadness”) with gleaming, youthful sound. When the choir first answered her, with lines evoking a mother’s consolation, its tone was so hushed that it sounded like a memory. Much of Mr. Tan’s “Fire Ritual” is designed to bring forth things that are hidden. In a program note, he explained that this work is inspired by ancient Chinese rituals that pit two groups of musicians against each other. The solo violin — here played with fierce dramatic commitment by Bomsori Kim — takes on a shamanistic role. With this work, the composer was “trying to find those dead people and souls to wake them up with special sounds and gestures and colors.” If conflicting emotions are interwoven in the Brahms, Mr. Tan isolates them and pits them in stark opposition. Tender, ornate violin solos alternate with brash orchestral outbursts full of clanging percussion and conciliatory passages. Some players are positioned in the auditorium, so that certain sounds — like an eerily realistic evocation of bird song — envelop the audience. The score includes unusual touches: musicians hum and hiss, the conductor intones a text, string players create wind by rhythmically fluttering a page of their music. Mr. Tan’s concerto was a potentially risky piece to program. With just one performance, it also represented a substantial investment of time and resources on the part of the musicians, who donated their services to benefit the Philharmonic at the Lunar New Year gala. Crowd-pleasing pieces like Li Huanzhi’s jaunty “Spring Festival Overture,” Stravinsky’s “Firebird” Suite and a barn-burning rendition of Mozart’s Queen of the Night aria from “The Magic Flute,” with the Korean soprano So Young Park, worked their reliable magic on an enthusiastic audience.

5c75966949f0eacbf105a474,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/26/arts/music/daniel-barenboim-conductor-bullying-berlin.html,"Daniel Barenboim, one of the world’s most celebrated conductors, is known for doing what he wants. He founded an orchestra (the West-Eastern Divan, a youth ensemble of musicians from around the Middle East), a conservatory (the Barenboim-Said Akademie) and a concert hall (the Pierre Boulez Saal). In 2001, he broke a longstanding informal ban in Israel and conducted a piece by Richard Wagner, an anti-Semite beloved of the Nazis. He makes the kind of political statements most musicians avoid. Mr. Barenboim, 76, has long been considered untouchable in Berlin, where he is music director of the Staatsoper — the city’s premier opera house — and principal conductor for life of its orchestra, the Staatskapelle. He is close to city politicians and has used his influence to ensure the opera company receives a healthy annual subsidy of 50.4 million euros ($57.4 million) from Berlin’s government. But cracks have begun to emerge in the conductor’s image as Mr. Barenboim has been accused of bullying and humiliating members of the Staatskapelle. The accusations have been reported widely in German media, and there have been calls for politicians to intervene. A spokesman for Klaus Lederer, Berlin’s highest-ranking official for culture, whose department provides most of the Staatsoper’s funding, said Mr. Lederer has asked the opera company to appoint a third party to look into the matter. “A piece of art might not always be democratic, but a public institution can’t be allowed to transform into a royal court,” said a recent article in the newspaper Der Tagesspiegel. The New York Times has communicated with seven former or current members of the Staatskapelle. All highlighted examples of Mr. Barenboim’s behavior that they said was bullying and went beyond what was normal for a conductor. Mr. Barenboim dismissed the accusations. “I was born in Argentina, so there’s a bit of Latin blood in my body, and I get upset now and then,” he told RBB, a German broadcaster. In an email exchange with The Times, he denied bullying anyone. “Bullying and humiliating someone,” he wrote, “implies the intention of wanting to cause someone hurt, of taking pleasure in it, even. This is not in my character.” Highhanded behavior was common in conductors of the last century, with maestros like Arturo Toscanini and Georg Solti known as harsh taskmasters. (One of Mr. Solti’s nicknames was “The Screaming Skull,” because of his bald head and temper.) But the debate around Mr. Barenboim raises the issue of whether such behavior is still possible. “The issue is not personal, but a question of how orchestras are run in the 21st century,” Martin Reinhardt, a trombonist in the Copenhagen Philharmonic who played in the Staatskapelle and has openly criticized Mr. Barenboim’s behavior, said in a statement. Willi Hilgers, a former timpanist with the Staatskapelle, said in a series of Facebook messages that Mr. Barenboim repeatedly humiliated him in front of colleagues by singling out his playing. As a result, he said, he had suffered “high blood pressure, depression, the feeling that you can no longer play your instrument, sleepless nights, my family had to suffer as well, no performance without beta blockers and antidepressants.” Mr. Barenboim said that the accusations were part of a campaign to stop him from continuing as music director of the Staatsoper. “The fact these allegations have surfaced now, just as I am in negotiations about renewing my contract beyond 2022,” he wrote in the email exchange, “makes me wonder: If people were indeed hurt, as they claim to have been, why speak about it now, at this precise moment?” “I know that in certain tense moments I have used a harsh tone that I regretted,” he added, but that was all. “I am not a shy lamb — but I am not a bully, either.” In a statement, the Staatskapelle’s orchestral board said it had achieved “great artistic successes through mutual trust and close cooperation” with Mr. Barenboim. “This confidence remains untouched,” the statement added. The accusations against Mr. Barenboim first appeared on Feb. 6 in VAN, an online classical music magazine, which interviewed over a dozen current and former employees of the Staatsoper, quoting them anonymously. The article described a leader “who can be inspiring and generous, but also authoritarian, mercurial and frightening.” Mr. Hilgers, 56, said in a Facebook message that his problems with Mr. Barenboim started during the Staatsoper’s 2001-02 season, at a performance of Wagner’s “Götterdämmerung.” During the first intermission, Mr. Hilgers said, he told Mr. Barenboim he had a migraine, warning the conductor in case he lost concentration during the rest of the opera. During the next act, Mr. Barenboim would bang out the rhythm of the timpani’s solos with one hand and a foot, as if instructing a child, Mr. Hilgers said, adding that he felt humiliated. “Afterward, his attacks piled up against me,” Mr. Hilgers said. Mr. Barenboim said in an email, “The timpanist you mention had a beautiful sound and made beautiful colors,” but he had “rhythmic weaknesses, which is very problematic.” Mr. Barenboim added that the pair had “some disagreements,” but that is normal when musicians are trying to get the best results. Leo Siberski, 49, is now the music director of the Plauen-Zwickau Theater in Germany, and played trumpet in the Staatskapelle under Mr. Barenboim from 1992 to 2003. He said he witnessed outbursts from Mr. Barenboim directed at musicians, and started experiencing them himself after asking for a sabbatical in 1996. Mr. Barenboim refused the request, Mr. Siberski said. “He soon found a situation where he could humiliate me, also to make an example of me,” Mr. Siberski said. This behavior largely involved singling Mr. Siberski out, and making him repeat passages in front of the orchestra. Mr. Barenboim said he didn’t remember any request for a sabbatical. He added it was “fair practice to ask musicians in a world-class orchestra to play their lines alone.” Mr. Siberski said he eventually quit as the orchestra’s principal trumpet to “get out of the firing line.” Now a conductor himself, he said he has adopted a different approach with the musicians he works with. “If a responsible artistic director wants to lead his ensemble to new levels of quality, this will always cause some pain,” he said. “But there is a huge abyss between pain like sore muscles, and deep mental wounds caused from attacking your very dignity.” Mr. Barenboim acknowledged that the world is changing. “That is generally a good thing,” he said. But, he added, “an orchestra cannot function if every tempo, every dynamic is put up for a democratic vote. Somebody has to lead, take decisions and be ultimately responsible.” "

But before conducting it on Monday at National Sawdust in Brooklyn, Mr. Ruo asked audience members to take up a pen and paper. “Write down what comes to mind when you think of a wall,” he said. “Any wall.” Earlier in the day, President Trump, who has brought the federal government to a partial shutdown in an effort to obtain funding for a wall along the southern border of the United States, had announced he would speak from the Oval Office to make his case for this wall as a national imperative. “The Sonic Great Wall” became a way for its audience to grapple with the concept of barriers and borders. In the piece, Mr. Ruo — whose expansion of his opera “An American Soldier” was one of my favorite musical events of 2018 — attempts to break down walls between musicians and audiences. The Great Wall of China, he said on Monday, was erected as a barrier against China’s enemies. But its watchtowers also became a series of signaling stations; the Great Wall was a kind of ancient telegraph system. The 30-minute work, presented as part of National Sawdust’s annual Ferus Festival of new work, began with Mr. Ruo leading the audience in a period of meditation — everyone standing, eyes closed, and humming. The cluster of hummed sounds became richly trembling and resonant. The main body of the piece began when players started blowing sustained drones on long tubes; thwacking drums; and playing delicate, tinkling riffs on gongs, among other sounds. As the music gained in density and variety, the larger elements of the piece were driven by a steady, rumbling 4/4 meter played on percussion. Mr. Ruo’s style, well suited to theatrical works, vividly blends Chinese melodic elements and skittish dance riffs with tartly modernist contemporary sounds and pointillist bursts. (Those qualities also came through in his alternately pensive and fraught Chamber Concerto No. 2, “The Lost Garden,” which opened the program.) Audience members were seated in five “paths,” as they were called, each with two facing rows of seats. Everyone had been asked earlier to jot down thoughts about a wall, choosing one key word to write in bold letters, and then to exchange papers with each other. At certain points during the piece, a musician from the ensemble of 14 would walk down one of the paths. Those seated, as asked, whispered the written-down words as the musician approached and then spoke the word clearly when he or she was in earshot. Depending on what the musician heard, he or she then varied the music played in response, choosing from various composed phrases or, it sometimes seemed, improvising. So each performance of “The Sonic Great Wall” will be somewhat different. Embracing the participatory aspects of the piece, the audience members leaned forward to whisper and speak words to the attentive performers as they walked past. The message seemed to be that, by working together, performers and listeners could together create a situation in which the wall between them was merely sonic — and easily permeated. As it turned out, President Trump’s fixation on a border wall nearly ended this performance before it began. Players from Asko/Schönberg, the ensemble that gave the premiere of the piece in Amsterdam in 2016, had trouble getting travel visas processed because of the government shutdown. Players from the Dream Unfinished Ensemble leapt in to perform the program. In the end, through the efforts of diplomats in the Netherlands, four Asko/Schönberg players did make the trip. (Two others could not obtain visas in time.) This international collaboration represented the symbolic breaking down of yet another wall. "

This year’s honorees include the songwriter and performer Migguel Anggelo; the vocalist and composer Trevor Bachman; the comedian, playwright and performance artist Becca Blackwell; the saxophonist Yacine Boulares; and the singer-songwriter Treya Lam. Now in its fifth year, the Working Group functions as a residency for standout artists who have previously played at Joe’s Pub, a small performance space tucked inside the Public Theater in Lower Manhattan. All five artists receive a $4,000 stipend, but because their work ranges widely, additional services vary for each honoree. They include access to rehearsal space, assistance with video production and consultations with industry experts. “Joe’s Pub Working Group was created to help make the business of being an artist in New York a little easier,” Alex Knowlton, the director of Joe’s Pub, said in an email. “We’re interested in the working life of an artist and have seen so many common needs among the huge spectrum of performers here.” “For the last 20 years, we’ve watched communities naturally occur amongst musicians, performers, designers, writers and more, and made it our mission to make space for all voices, collaborations and connections,” he added. Anggelo, who was born in Venezuela, creates multilingual works that combine music, dance and poetry. Bachman often uses field research and interviews to create musicals and performances that reflect the life experiences of people across the country.  Blackwell’s work as a storyteller and actor confronts issues related to the transgender experience. Boulares is a French-Tunisian improviser and composer who combines influences from American jazz and across the globe. And Lam is a classically trained musician fusing elements of chamber music, country and pop. "

A couple of months ago, the 22-year-old musician who records as Rat Boy rented a huge empty warehouse a short walk to a lovely little stream and a slightly longer walk to a small black sign leaning against a decayed wall that reads FARM TOILET. Here, slowly, he, his father, and brother have been building out the raw space into a place — inspired by the Beastie Boys’ old G-Son Studios in Los Angeles — where he can work, and also play. A few days before Christmas, it was mostly empty save for a roughly fashioned studio. On one wall was a Public Enemy “Fear of a Black Planet” poster. On a shelf was an autographed vinyl copy of the Beastie Boys’ “Hello Nasty.” On the center table, an old issue of the Beasties’ publication Grand Royal and some obscure graffiti magazines. Up against the wall, a small-scale screen printing rig and several of Cardy’s ghoulishly realistic illustrations. Sitting on a pallet under a blanket was an Amek Einstein console, the same kind that the Dust Brothers used to work on, that Cardy bought for about 6,000 pounds on the internet from Peru. It’s the most money he’s ever spent on anything, he said, but he still wasn’t sure it worked. This month Cardy will release the second Rat Boy album, “Internationally Unknown,” a high-energy collision of punk convulsion and hip-hop storytelling full of raucously fun, sharp-tongued songs about slackerdom, resistance and disorderly joy. It’s shaped by late 1970s punk with flickers of dub, nods to 1990s hip-hop (and also the early 2000s English rapper the Streets), and embraces the musical exuberance of 2000s pop-punk. Which is to say, it is an extremely of-the-moment amalgam, refusing to draw distinctions between genres. It’s also part of a long continuum of British punk that looks for kinship in black music and part of a wider re-engagement with the 1990s as source material. [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] The 1990s are the leading touchstone for Cardy, who has studied the era with loving devotion and built a specific, refined aesthetic from it: “It’s a bunch of people that are around my age making something for themselves. I love the way stuff looks — making their own magazines, the music, being motivated to put stuff out,” he said, slumped in a chair wearing a Supreme bottle cap T-shirt, his hair pink and scraggly. “They did everything right, but did they know they were doing it right?” “I kind of see Jordan as the nexus of what was happening in the ’90s when punk and hip-hop were blowing up,” said Brett Gurewitz, the founder and chief executive of Epitaph Records, which is releasing “Internationally Unknown” via its Hellcat imprint. “Rat Boy is the embodiment of that time.” Similarly, Cardy, too, has been figuring things out by trial and error. For a young person gravitating toward art and music, Chelmsford — he grew up in this city of around 100,000, and hasn’t lived elsewhere — was an unremarkable place to be. Mostly, Cardy hung out with friends at the city’s lone skate park. When he became curious about music, YouTube was his university. “I used to watch thousands of videos,” he said. Cardy’s natural artistic curiosity was buttressed by a creeping sense of outsiderness. “When I was in school when I was a kid, I did feel like there were not, like, people that were into the same stuff,” he said. “Everyone was into what was happening around here, and I’m just liking [expletive] that happened 20 years ago.” He became increasingly inspired after seeing the early success of King Krule, the London singer and songwriter who, in the early 2010s, when he was still a teenager, broke through with a fascinating punk-jazz hybrid: “It really motivated me to see someone like that doing it at that age.” When Cardy finally began posting his self-produced songs to SoundCloud, he began emailing the links as widely as he could. One of the first people in the music business he met was Drew McConnell, who plays bass in the British band Babyshambles (which is fronted by Pete Doherty) and was introduced to Cardy’s music by an intern at his publishing company. Before long, McConnell was setting up management and label meetings for Cardy, who was sleeping on his sofa. [Here are 10 more artists to watch in 2019.] “He had obviously listened to a lot of records,” McConnell said. “The way he would sing would remind me of Elvis Costello, or Robert Smith from the Cure. But at the same time he’s a huge hip-hop fan.” Cardy signed to Parlophone — home to Babyshambles and also Coldplay — and began working on his first album, “Scum,” a loose and exciting collection of songs that range from punk to dub to hip-hop. (An early version of one of them was sampled on Kendrick Lamar’s “Lust,” from his 2017 album “DAMN.”) “That’s what I thought a first record is, I thought like it’s all over the place,” Cardy said. “It was just guessing.” On the album’s deluxe version, the songs are interwoven with skits, in part because Cardy felt like the songs themselves didn’t tell a consistent story. “When the record was done it was kind of like, ‘You need to have a single’ at the end,” he said. And while he obliged, “I released two songs as singles that are [expletive] in my opinion, trying to write a pop song.” McConnell joked that a mainstream record label signing Cardy was like the government capturing a disruptive hacker “and being like, ‘you work for us now.’” For his second album, Cardy knew he wanted to tell a more consistent story, and was introduced to Tim Armstrong, of the California street-punk legends Operation Ivy and Rancid and the punk-hip-hop hybrid pioneers Transplants, and also Gurewitz’s partner in Hellcat. When they first spoke on the phone, the first thing they agreed on was tempo: 170 bpm, fast enough for punk mayhem but also, at half time, a comfortable in-the-pocket pace for rapping. Cardy went to Los Angeles and spent six weeks working with Armstrong at the Boat, once the studio of the Dust Brothers. (John King of the Dust Brothers also worked on the new album.) They recorded live takes, then chopped up and sampled the results. The guitars are hard-charging and dirty, and the rapping and singing is delivered with a blend of sneer and ennui: On “I Wanna Skate,” he’s yelling in the most casual manner, “You want it now? I wanna wait!/You want a Benz? I wanna skate!” In person, Cardy is gentle and soft-edged. But on both his first and second records, his attitude is consistent: a permanently extended middle finger to authority, and a robust sense of working class agitation. His best songwriting is in a narrative style that he learned listening to hip-hop: Slick Rick’s “Children’s Story,” Prince Paul’s “A Prince Among Thieves,” Too Short. AFTER TALKING FOR a while in his new studio, Cardy hopped in a van driven by his guitar tech, Tuck. (Chelmsford is a small enough city that it was Tuck who sold 12-year-old Cardy his first guitar.) They headed over to Cardy’s family’s house, where the yard overflowed with half-finished projects belonging to his dad, Brett, who does fabrication work on automobiles and other vehicles. It was Brett who introduced a 6-year-old Cardy to the first Transplants album. And it was Brett’s example of making something from nothing that Cardy identifies as the germ of his own D.I.Y. instincts. Until he was around 18, Cardy assumed he’d become a graphic designer, or maybe a tattoo artist. Some of his earliest art — inspired by the cars his father worked on, and the ones they raced on weekends — was in the style of Ed Roth, the hot rod artist. When he was young, art and music were always commingled; he’d have Myspace pages for bands with song art but no songs. He still does all the artwork for his projects — “I always thought you do everything yourself,” he said — films wild CKY-style videos with his friends, and also has a budding streetwear line, Scum. His father wasn’t home, so Cardy arranged to meet him at the local garage where he was working for the day. On the way, he pointed out a lone Rat Boy graffiti tag on the back of a road sign near a roundabout. A few minutes later he found his father jawing away with a couple of car-customizer friends. Brett is salty, profane, thick-skinned — a bruiser to Cardy’s anxious artist. But Brett also supports Cardy’s flights of creative fancy. The Burberry tartan-painted car from Cardy’s early music videos was done by Brett (and part of it is in Cardy’s warehouse, along with some other vehicles Brett chopped-and-remixed). Their conversation was amiable, a little punchy. Cardy recalled how Brett never pushed him to pursue things he didn’t feel strongly about, like schoolwork: “It’s always been, like, do what you want to do.” They spoke about Cardy’s music and the unlikeliness of his performance intensity, joked about living in close quarters and celebrated hating authority. Recalling when Cardy was first learning to race cars, Brett explained his hands-off parenting philosophy, which felt like the foundation for all of Cardy’s subsequent life choices. “Just let him crash,” Brett said. “He ain’t going to do it twice.” "
5c489c373a125f5075c05e41,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/23/arts/music/alice-merton-mint-review.html,"Alice Merton closes her debut album, “Mint,” with “Why So Serious,” a song full of questions like “When did we get like this?” It’s a wish for a more carefree, less calculating spirit, sung by her overdubbed, call-and-response posse of female voices over a bouncing bass line. And it’s the counterbalance, in some small part, to an album that takes everything extremely seriously, from career ambitions and lovers’ quarrels to the placement of every hook. Merton has a hearty, natural voice that stays plush while echoing the power of singers like Adele and Florence Welch. It’s a voice made for larger-than-life declarations; the first lines she sings on “Mint,” in “Learn to Live,” are “They’ve got fire/Well, I’ve got lightning bolts.” In more than one song, she sings about her fears and inhibitions, even as her voice leaves no question that she will conquer them. [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] Merton, 25, was born in Germany, grew up mostly in Canada and moved back to Germany in her teens, and she has also lived in England and the United States. Now based in Berlin, she has had a dozen addresses in 24 years. She propelled her pop career in Germany with a single released in 2016, the partly autobiographical “No Roots,” a song about constant relocation that speaks, perhaps, to listeners whose connections are digital, not terrestrial. “I’ve got memories and travel like Gypsies in the night,” she exults over a 4/4 thump, a stop-start bass line and clanky rhythm-guitar chops hinting at 1980s hits by INXS. “I’ve got no roo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-oots,” Merton sings, with the kind of nonsense-syllable hook she also brings to other choruses on the album. “No Roots” reached No. 2 in Germany and was a hit elsewhere in Europe, leading to an EP and singles released over the past two years. Recorded with Merton’s songwriting collaborator and producer, Nicolas Rebscher, “Mint” gathers most of the singles alongside newer songs, and every one sets out to be a tour de force. Each verse layers on another instrument, a countermelody, an electronic effect, dabs of backup vocals. Then the choruses land squarely in place, promising forthrightness and honesty. Merton insists on her fidelity in “Funny Business,” warns that she’s going to lose her temper in “Lash Out,” demands explanations from a lover in “Speak Your Mind” and gives up on a no-show partner in “I Don’t Hold a Grudge.” Although Merton was born in the ’90s, most of her music’s reference points are from the MTV 1980s: not just INXS but Michael Jackson, Eurythmics, Heart, Duran Duran and late Queen, along with touches of house-music piano. (The non-1980s exception is the album’s dud, “Honeymoon Heartbreak,” an attempt at Lana Del Rey angst that borrows its best melodic phrase from Green Day’s “Boulevard of Broken Dreams.”) The songs on “Mint” are designed to leap out from a playlist, with Merton’s immediately appealing voice, the sounds of physical instruments and the craftsmanship that Merton and Rebscher bring to each segment of a song. But listening to the album as a whole, there are diminishing returns from the certainty that a new gimmick is coming every eight bars. Pop songs live by their hooks; it’s no wonder that Merton’s debut album piles them on, eager to please. But for the follow-up, suspense and spontaneity — even if it’s an illusion — would go a long way. "

Let us know at theplaylist@nytimes.com and sign up for our Louder newsletter, a once-a-week blast of our pop music coverage. Tame Impala — Kevin Parker playing everything he can in the studio — aligns multiple eras, but mostly the 1970s, in “Patience,” his first single since 2015. “Has it really been that long?” he sings. Pounding major-seventh piano chords like Todd Rundgren, using conga drums to punch up and punctuate synthesizer arpeggios, and hinting at Michael Jackson in his melodies, he comes to the realization that he’s “growing up in stages/living life in phases.” It’s an honest part of a long-term evolution. JON PARELES Lizzo continues to stake out turf as one of this year’s most versatile pop breakouts — a sturdy singer, a limber rapper and always rich with lighthearted thirst. On “Tempo,” she goes bump for bump with Missy Elliott on an electro-hip-hop thumper teeming with arched-eyebrow come-ons. It’s pure, infectious joy. JON CARAMANICA Cowbells clink, the wah-wah guitar cackles, synthesizer lines wriggle and horns punch terse little riffs in the latest single from Ibibio Sound Machine, a London band whose lead singer, Eno Williams, is from Nigeria; the band releases its album “Doko Mien” on Friday. “Wanna Come Down” is a snappy funk track that owes more to Prince than to Nigeria’s own Afrobeat or juju. Williams splits her lyrics between English and the African language Ibibio but the video clip, alas, offers no subtitles. PARELES It makes some sense that the Last Poets — who, in the late 1960s, did more to augur the rise of hip-hop than any band of their generation — would find relevance today by looking back. This group was always guided by ancient practices, and the last few years have demonstrated that America’s troubled racial history remains close at hand. On “For the Millions,” from an album due in May, the bassist Jamaaladeen Tacuma offers a buoyant accompaniment that recalls the poets’ 1972 record, “Chastisment.” And Abiodun Oyewole reaches further back, rapping a remembrance of black lives lost over the years, and a call to continue the fight. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO Justin Vernon of Bon Iver has been citing Bruce Hornsby as an influence since the beginning of his career, and over the last few years, the two performers have been inching toward each other. This jagged but soothing collaboration was recorded at Vernon’s Eau Claire studio. Vernon’s singing is characteristically pastel, while Hornsby’s has a heavy, urgent grounding. Their hymnal give and take owes something to folk and roots music, and something to jazz, and it’s surprising, given how different their vocal approaches are, just how much their words appear to be hugging each other, balms in an emotional storm. CARAMANICA Nature abhors a vacuum, so with Ed Sheeran largely missing in action, the Australian singer Dean Lewis has stepped into the void. Last year, Lewis’s single “Be Alright” was a savvy slice of mournful folk-pop. He’s just released his debut album, “A Place We Knew,” which includes “Stay Awake,” an impressively dynamic number about the hope of love that nods to both Sheeran’s crisp melodies and his irrepressible urge toward rhythm. CARAMANICA A breezy cross-generational Mexican-American love song featuring two of the most prominent and long-running Chicano rappers — MC Magic, from Phoenix, and Lil Rob, from San Diego — and Cuco, the rising indie soul-pop singer from South Los Angeles. “Search” moves slowly and with warmth, in the manner of the slow-jam oldies played for decades on Los Angeles radio by Art Laboe, whom MC Magic name-checks here. Like those molasses-thick grooves, this song is almost guilelessly sweet: In the video, the two young protagonists don’t even so much as kiss. CARAMANICA The Doobie Brothers of nü-trap play tug-of-war with unexpected sweetness over light piano and lighter drums. Nav, as ever, is a font of melancholy and mistrust, and Young Thug … well, Young Thug remains a master of free-associative madness, concluding with a flirtatious riff that begins, “You look just like my rich auntie” and goes on to express sentiments that, for most, would be verboten, but which in his signature wail sound like vivid confession. CARAMANICA Burrow into “Hungry Ghost,” the new album by the guitar-bass-drums trio Typical Sisters, and you might start to notice what isn’t there. This is improvisation-driven music, right at the corner of jazz and post-rock, but there are none of the showy, full-band misdirections that have become so typical of jazz today. And while the album’s title refers to Chinese Buddhism, these aren’t slow, numinous, incantatory sounds, either. Instead, what you get is happily in the middle and something increasingly rare today: group exploration with little flexing or hurry, electric guitar melodies that sound like open promises — a reminder that it’s O.K. to listen with no expectation of a payoff.

5c3f770b3a125f5075c04c03,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/16/arts/music/james-blake-assume-form-review.html,"Love is a murky, uncertain, only sporadically blissful thing on James Blake’s fourth album, “Assume Form.” But sometimes it manages to break through his chronic melancholy. He needs the changeup, because echoes of his own past are his toughest competition. Since the release of his self-titled debut album in 2011, Blake’s style has made a thoroughly improbable conquest of pop’s commercial mainstream, seeping into hip-hop, R&B and rock. Beyoncé, Frank Ocean, Kanye West, Kendrick Lamar and Anderson .Paak chose him as a collaborator, and streaming blockbusters like Post Malone, Future and Juice WRLD have clearly learned from his vocabulary of oozy, slow-motion chords, electronically wobbled vocals and transitions that crumble and lurch into new configurations. Before his debut album, Blake had made a reputation as a club D.J. playing and producing fractured, aggressively disorienting British dubstep tracks. But “James Blake” turned his music radically inward. He constructed ballads around sparse keyboard chords and his sustained, doleful, androgynous voice, hovering in imaginary space and punctuated by tense silences. He was, he told The Guardian in 2016, “copying dubstep rhythms but using gospel-tinged, classically tinged keyboard playing.” But he was doing more than that. For all his debts to British dubstep and to the moody desolation of hip-hop auteurs like RZA (who was a guest on Blake’s 2013 album, “Overgrown”), Blake had found a way to create a charged stillness, a forsaken fortress of solitude. His music suited an era of disembodied digital interactions, at once instantaneous and physically distant. With “Assume Form,” Blake wants to get closer. His previous albums were suffused with loneliness; this one, tentatively and almost incredulously, ponders intimacy. In the album’s title song, Blake sings about choosing to become embodied: “I’ll leave the ether/I will assume form,” he croons. “I will be touchable by her/I will be reachable.” The track fluctuates gorgeously, juxtaposing loops of piano that are soothing and vaguely ominous, and only settling into a beat about halfway through, like a ghost gradually solidifying. [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] The album is full of gratitude and affectionate apologies. “Into the Red” marvels at a woman’s financial generosity, over a track that dwindles from a string-ensemble arrangement to tiny, plinking tones. “Can’t Believe the Way We Flow,” built on a rapturous sample from the R&B vocal group the Manhattans and produced with Oneohtrix Point Never, revels in sensuality that makes the singer “waive my fear of self.” In “Power On,” he lists his delusions of separateness and self-sufficiency — “I thought you were second place to every song” — only to return to a refrain: “I was wrong.” Blake rarely lets his music feel too secure. He still makes pitches waver and rhythms dissolve; he switches texture with sudden, surreal edits. In two songs, he collaborates with the producer Metro Boomin and guest vocalists: Travis Scott in “Mile High” and Moses Sumney in “Tell Them.” But he calmly destabilizes Metro Boomin’s trap rhythms, entangling them with flute sounds in “Mile High” and fitfully swapping them for flamenco handclaps in “Tell Them.” Well aware of how widely imitated he is, Blake offers some other surprises; if it were in a different musical guise, the borderline stalker-ish “I’ll Come Too” could almost be a Tin Pan Alley ballad. Like the rest of Blake’s albums, “Assume Form” opens into haunted, rewarding depths. All that’s missing is one luminous, fully focused pop chorus, like “Retrograde” on Blake’s 2013 “Overgrown” or “My Willing Heart” on his 2016 “The Colour in Anything.” This album comes closest in “Barefoot in the Park,” a duet with the Spanish singer Rosalía that, despite its minor key and somber descending chords, celebrates togetherness and how “You start rubbing off on me.” Perhaps Blake couldn’t bring himself to write something as clichéd as a hit-seeking pop love song.

5c420db03a125f5075c052a6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/18/arts/music/sabine-devieilhe-review-carnegie-hall.html,"For a coloratura soprano, the Fire Aria from Ravel’s “L’Enfant et les Sortilèges” — high runs and Queen of the Night histrionics — is a perfect showcase for technical wizardry and spunk. So it made sense for Sabine Devieilhe, a rising star in her native France who has won acclaim at the leading opera houses of Europe, to include it in her debut at Carnegie Hall’s Weill Recital Hall on Thursday. But Ms. Devieilhe’s impetuous and sparkling rendition of that showpiece was only the encore — an afterthought, really — for an evening of delicate, nuanced French art songs. It says something about the confidence of this 33-year-old artist that she felt no need to offer a grab bag highlighting her strengths. The program she assembled, songs by Debussy and his circle, was refined and cohesive. And it still held plenty of opportunities to show off her nimble singing and radiant tone. Ms. Devieilhe also had a superb partner in the pianist Mathieu Pordoy, whose artistry helped to make this an evening of first-rate chamber music. His finely contoured playing, especially in numbers by Debussy, stood out for its clarity and light pedal use. He revealed details in music that other pianists tend to dissolve in a reverberant haze. Clarity was also the defining quality of Ms. Devieilhe’s performance, both in her lucid, evenly weighted tone and in her meticulous attention to language. Her program drew heavily on settings of quietly enigmatic texts, whether by Symbolist poets like Paul Verlaine or Sanskrit miniatures filtered through the lenses of Western translators. Ms. Devieilhe embraced the emotional ambiguity of such works using tone color to bring out glints of surreal humor — as in Ravel’s “Sur l’herbe” — or draw a moody veil over an entire song, as in Albert Roussel’s “Le jardin mouillé.” (That song was one of two about rain: While Roussel rendered the irregular patter of drops rolling off leaves, Debussy’s “Il pleure dans mon coeur” captured the regular drum of precipitation on city streets and the rushing of water in gutters.) In Poulenc’s “Fêtes galantes,” with its affectionate portrait of a busy street scene, Ms. Devieilhe found a gossipy, conversational tone close to that of a chanson singer. Debussy’s “Chevaux de bois,” about a carousel on a rural fairground, also drew forth chatty and bright singing. But the most arresting moment, and a taste of Ms. Devieilhe’s virtuosity, came without words or accompaniment. In 1912, the composer Maurice Delage, a student of Ravel’s, traveled through India. While there, he wrote “Four Hindu Poems,” which elegantly reflect that country’s music. “Lahore” is based on a text by Heinrich Heine that imagines a snow-covered fir dreaming of a palm tree “grieving” in the heat. After the poem’s last line, the piano falls silent, and the soprano continues wordlessly in a trancelike sequence of arabesque lines, some sung through closed lips. Ms. Devieilhe conjured an array of colors beginning with a nasal sound that turned into a warm hum before opening into cool brilliance. It was a stunning display of vocal control and proof — in the midst of an all-French recital — of Ms. Devieilhe’s polyglot artistry. "

Khalid, who was nominated for five Grammys last year, including best new artist, reached No. 1 on Billboard’s album chart for the first time with his second album, “Free Spirit” (Right Hand Music Group/RCA). It sold 85,000 copies as a full album in the United States — helped by a bundling deal that included it with the cost of concert tickets — but also performed well on streaming services, with 147 million streams last week, according to Nielsen. That added up to the equivalent of 202,000 album sales. Eilish, the 17-year-old singer and songwriter who made a splash on last week’s chart, was bumped to No. 2 with “When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?,” and Nipsey Hussle’s year-old “Victory Lap,” which re-entered the chart last week after the rapper was killed at age 33, fell one spot to No. 3. Also this week, Ariana Grande’s “Thank U, Next” is in fourth place, Juice WRLD’s “Death Race for Love” holds at No. 5, and Sara Bareilles’s “Amidst the Chaos” opens at No. 6. Lil Nas X’s song “Old Town Road” holds at No. 1 on Billboard’s Hot 100 pop singles chart, with record-setting streaming numbers. The track, which now includes Billy Ray Cyrus in a remix version, was streamed 142 million times in the United States last week, according to Nielsen. That easily beat the 116 million streams Drake had for “In My Feelings” last July, and it is also nearly four times as many as the No. 2 song on this week’s chart, “Sunflower” by Post Malone and Swae Lee, which had 36.5 million. But “Old Town Road” is still not on Billboard’s Hot Country Songs list, after being removed last month for being insufficiently country. One big reason: The song is largely being ignored by mainstream country radio stations, although it is on many country-themed playlists on streaming services. "
5c65ebe03a125f5075c09cc6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/arts/music/fbi-ryan-adams.html,"The F.B.I. is looking into whether the singer-songwriter Ryan Adams, 44, committed a crime by engaging in sexually explicit communications with an underage fan, according to a law enforcement official with knowledge of the matter. As reported by The New York Times on Wednesday, Adams and a young woman, who said her online communications with the singer began when she was 14 and continued until she was 16, exchanged text messages and conducted video calls that sometimes included nudity. The two never met in person. Adams, through his lawyer, Andrew B. Brettler, has denied that he “ever engaged in inappropriate online sexual communications with someone he knew was underage.” On Thursday, Brettler said that he had not been contacted by law enforcement. He declined to comment further. [Read our report: Ryan Adams dangled success. Women say they paid a price.] In response to The Times’s article, F.B.I. agents in the bureau’s New York office on Thursday took the first steps to open a criminal investigation, according to the official, who declined to be identified because the person was not authorized to discuss it publicly. The agents, from the Crimes Against Children Squad, will seek to interview the woman, the official said, and try to obtain the text messages and any other evidence she may have in her possession. If they find her account credible, they will take other investigative steps, which could include subpoenaing both her cellphone records and those of Adams from their service providers, the official said. Federal law bars the sexual exploitation of children under 18, defining a violator as anyone who “persuades, induces, entices or coerces any minor to engage in” a visual depiction of sexually explicit conduct. Several legal experts said that decisions on whether to prosecute such cases could hinge on whether the adult reasonably believed the minor was of legal age, taking into account context from their conversations. While the inquiry was in its earliest stages, the official said that generally in such cases, agents seek to interview a victim’s friends and family members to determine whether they made contemporaneous statements about the contact. [Ryan Adams’s album release has been canceled amid an F.B.I. inquiry.] A lawyer for the woman, now 20, declined to comment as her family deliberated how to proceed. The Times identified the woman by her middle name, Ava, because she was a minor during these interactions. An F.B.I. spokeswoman, Amy J. Thoreson, declined to comment Thursday when asked about the matter. The Times reviewed extensive communication between Adams and Ava, including direct messages on Twitter that began when she was 14, and more than 3,000 text messages spanning a nine-month period when Ava was 15 and 16. The text messages from late 2014, when Ava was 16, included explicit photographs of her. She said the pair also conducted video calls on Skype, where Adams exposed himself during phone sex. The Times has reviewed screenshots of these interactions. Throughout their communication, Adams asked Ava, a successful bass player since she was 12, repeatedly about her age. “Do me a paranoid favor,” he wrote in November 2014, when he was 40 and she was 16. “Show me you are 18.” He invoked others accused of targeting girls, including R. Kelly. Sometimes, in response to Adams’s prodding, Ava said she was older than she was. More than once Adams asked to see her identification, although she never provided any in the messages reviewed by The Times, and their sexual conversations continued. Brettler said that Adams did not recall these conversations and added that while the singer has corresponded with fans and aspiring musicians online, Adams “does not recall having online communications with anyone related to anything outside of music.” Brettler also provided photos of Ava, in which he said her appearance suggested “that she was in her 20s.” After the publication of the article, Adams posted on Twitter on Wednesday to apologize to “anyone I have ever hurt, however unintentionally,” though he continued to dispute the accuracy of The Times’s reporting. “I would never have inappropriate interactions with someone I thought was underage,” he wrote. “Period.” Ava and other women interviewed by The Times said that Adams often dangled potential career opportunities as he pursued female artists in sexual scenarios. “Music was a point of control for him,” said Adams’s ex-wife, the singer and actress Mandy Moore. Adams, a Grammy-nominated rock singer famous for his contributions to the genre known as alternative country, has released 16 studio albums and announced plans to release three more this year via Blue Note and his own Pax-Am Records. Capitol Music Group, which oversees those labels, declined to comment. The allegations that Adams manipulated and harassed women in the music industry sent ripples through the business. “We’re all fed up,” the singer Vanessa Carlton wrote on Twitter. Bethany Cosentino, the singer of Best Coast, said that the same story “could literally be written about so many dudes in music.” And Tamara Lindeman of the Canadian band the Weather Station added: “Having to perpetually question if a potential collaborator is interested in you musically or personally is an enormous and unspoken barrier for women in music.” Jason Isbell, a country singer who is scheduled to appear on one of Adams’s upcoming albums, wrote on Twitter that he had been unaware of Adams’s alleged behavior. Asked if he believed the women’s accounts, Isbell responded: “Yep.” "
5c645cba3a125f5075c0985b,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/13/arts/music/daniel-harding-concertgebouw-carnegie-hall.html,"Thirty years ago, the conductor Simon Rattle received a letter. It was from a teacher at Chetham’s School of Music in Manchester, England, telling Mr. Rattle about an extraordinarily talented teenage maestro there named Daniel Harding. “Chetham’s is set up for extremely gifted instrumentalists,” Mr. Rattle said in an interview. “And they had no idea what to do about a young conductor.” So Mr. Rattle, then the hotshot 30-something leader of the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, took Mr. Harding under his wing. Mr. Harding eventually became an assistant in Birmingham and even lodged with the Rattles, who would feed him ham sandwiches, which were more or less all he ate at the time. “He doesn’t look very old now, but at age 16 or 17 he really looked 11,” Mr. Rattle said, describing Mr. Harding’s first time in front of the ensemble, rehearsing Hans Werner Henze’s daunting Seventh Symphony. “I think the orchestra thought I was playing an April Fools’ game on them. And when this 11-year-old look-alike conducted the whole movement flawlessly, including wordlessly correcting some mistakes, the orchestra was completely flabbergasted.” The decades since have been, in many ways, good to Mr. Harding, now 43, who will lead the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam at Carnegie Hall on Thursday and Friday. He is principal conductor of the respected Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra and has served stints as principal guest of the London Symphony Orchestra and principal conductor of the Orchestre de Paris, from which he departed last year with a letter of notably graceful candor. Mr. Harding is a regular on the podiums of Europe’s leading orchestras, including in Vienna and Berlin. He took over the Concertgebouw’s American tour after the firing of its chief conductor, Daniele Gatti, amid sexual misconduct accusations; the prestigious assignment placed him in the midst of the much-watched competition to replace Mr. Gatti. “It’s a big badge of approval that they’re having him do this tour,” said Alan Gilbert, a friend who, until 2017, led the New York Philharmonic, adding, “He’s a brilliant musician, and really, really knows what he’s doing, in an enormous range of repertoire.” But America has proved a tougher nut to crack. “I haven’t found in the U.S. — I haven’t found my place, so to speak,” Mr. Harding said in a phone interview. When he was starting his career early in the 2000s, he did a circuit of major ensembles here: Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, Atlanta. The results were mixed, to say the least. While some concerts were solid, there were frustrations between him and the musicians — mutual incomprehension, some stormy scenes. “I came and did the rounds when I was a really young conductor,” said Mr. Harding. “And my experiences in Europe were quite protected. I knew people quite well. I think I just wasn’t ready for how some of the big U.S. orchestras worked, and how they would relate to me.” “I look back on some of the great orchestras here,” he added. “For example, Chicago. I can see exactly why that didn’t quite click.” He described the problem by recalling the composer and conductor André Previn, who watched Mr. Harding rehearse Strauss at Tanglewood one summer. “I have no idea what you’re doing,” Mr. Previn told Mr. Harding. “Why are you talking so much?” Especially when Mr. Harding was younger — and looked younger still — this flood of explanation and analysis came across as the cockiness of an immature know-it-all. “I love to talk,” he said. “I love to share with an orchestra why I want something to be a certain way. Does a conductor play an orchestra like a piano, manipulating without saying a word? For me, I was taught that’s almost disrespectful. So I come and just talk, talk, talk, and that’s just not how it works here.” Mr. Harding, for his part, believes he has matured in recent years. “I think that I’ve been learning — these are things that take a lifetime to learn — how to enjoy what’s different about each situation,” he said. “Instead of ‘I wish this were like this.’” A few years ago, wanting to work on technique and communication, he hired Mark Stringer, a onetime protégé of Leonard Bernstein, as a coach. And he has been dipping his toe back in the United States, though the jury is still out. He made his debut with the San Francisco Symphony last year in a program of Beethoven and Strauss; it got so-so notices. “Harding seemed to have something specific and urgent to say about each individual measure,” Joshua Kosman wrote in his review in the San Francisco Chronicle, “which made for a lot of trees and not much forest.” Mr. Harding was supposed to return to San Francisco later this month but canceled on Feb. 8, citing an injury. He is scheduled to return to the New York Philharmonic next season, for the first time since 2011. Deborah Borda, who presented Mr. Harding at the Los Angeles Philharmonic (where he canceled, citing an injury, in October) and is now president and chief executive in New York, said: “Young conductors, when they make these lightning rounds of the major orchestras — New York, Boston, Chicago, Philly, L.A. — it’s almost unfair, to put that much pressure on them at that time. And sometimes what you need is a little break — not to learn repertoire, but to practice. And then they come back.” Decades after making him ham sandwiches, Mr. Rattle is still in Mr. Harding’s corner. “These last five years have been, I think, a complete other thing to Daniel,” he said, adding: “I’ve seen a quantum leap in what he can do. He was always full of music, but he can now really make it work. With any of the greatest orchestras in the world.” "

Let us know at theplaylist@nytimes.com and sign up for our Louder newsletter, a once-a-week blast of our pop music coverage. Long before the English-speaking pop mainstream took real notice, BTS were already global pop stars. The successes the K-pop outfit have had in this country happened largely without worrying about how it might or might not fit in. On its new release, “Map of the Soul: Persona,” it showcases its highest-profile collaborations to date in a way that preserves its core strengths. The shimmering “Boy With Luv” features Halsey — but more importantly, it features Halsey singing in Korean, exactly the sort of bilingual exchange that’s all too rare. And “Make It Right” is in part written by Ed Sheeran. It has some of his signature soft-soul gestures, but BTS renders them with complexity. The least comfortable collaborations are the ones in which the balance of power is wildly uneven, where one party badly needs something from the other. But all you hear on these songs is mutual respect. JON CARAMANICA The first new song in two years from Steve Lacy — who plays in the space-soul outfit the Internet and has collaborated with Blood Orange, Vampire Weekend and others — is a narcotically mellow inversion of casually strutting 1970s R&B. On the one hand, it’s about yearning, with Lacy’s vocals aquatically damp; but on the other, Lacy is far too at ease — far too chill — to really break a sweat. CARAMANICA “So Good” is elegantly rendered, built-by-hand disco from Omar Apollo, one of several strong songs from his impressive new EP, “Friends.” For the last two years, he’s been releasing songs that were sharp but felt tentative, as if he was worried about overstepping boundaries. But on “Friends,” he moves toward the upbeat and joyful, and sounds more free than ever. CARAMANICA Lead singers with Sounds of Blackness — Ann Nesby, Big Jim Wright and Lauren Evans — spill over one another with overlapping gospel praise in “Til I Found You,” the first single from a new collection by the producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis with various collaborators. The track is built on an easygoing beat and rippling guitar lines, but the singers turn it into an urgent competition to extol the comforts of faith. JON PARELES “I can make your dreams come true/if you let me listen in on you,” Yeasayer’s Anand Wilder sings, as if he’s Alexa or Siri or some present or near-future authoritarian state. That’s the sweet chorus; the verses are far more paranoid, with no more comfort to offer than, “Don’t look so guilty, you’ve got nothing to hide.” In a lilt with an electronic pulse — glancing back at the Cars — Yeasayer pinpoints where the promise of convenience meets the threat of constant surveillance. PARELES This exuberant romp about the upsides of getting rich quick is effective and fun, but it’s more intriguing for the performers it brings together, a union of singer-rappers of North African heritage: Geko, born in Manchester, England, is of Libyan and Algerian descent; Ay Em, from London, of Egyptian and Moroccan heritage; and French Montana, who grew up in the Bronx but was born in Morocco. Each has a particular take on the blurry line between rapping and melody. To be fair, French Montana mostly phones in his mumbles, but Geko and Ay Em make for a winning tag team. Geko, a strong rapper, sings with a light touch, and Ay Em provides aural and spiritual ballast: “I just did my prayer, then you know it’s back to business.” CARAMANICA In Courtney Barnett’s latest two-chord stomp — well, three in the chorus — she’s even blunter than usual about self-doubt and alienation: “I feel stupid, I feel useless, I feel insane,” she begins. But as she finds a defensive posture — “We’re gonna tell everyone it’s O.K.,” she sings with a laugh — the band cranks up, organ and tambourine pile on and voices join her for a rowdy singalong. She may be insecure and alienated, but she’s far from alone. PARELES With tolling chimes, a growly high-drama vocal, a minor-mode melody, a verse about death and an arena-scale drumbeat, “God’s Country” verges on goth metal, with only a little bit of slide guitar and devout lyrics to qualify it as country. It’s Blake Shelton’s latest paean to rural life, a song about hard-working, churchgoing farmers that’s not cozy and nostalgic, but grimly fatalistic. PARELES The guitarist Bill Frisell and the bassist Thomas Morgan released their first duets album two years ago, a collection of performances that smoldered like warm coals and bespoke an easygoing, simpatico new partnership. Now they’re back with “Epistrophy,” an entire album of covers. It closes with this rendition of “In the Wee Small Hours of the Morning,” honoring the old Sinatra ballad’s melancholy theme but still animated by Frisell’s ebullient warmth. And all the while there is Morgan’s virtuoso flexibility; he’s as responsive as he is grounded and firm. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO With Abrams, a veteran bassist affiliated with Chicago’s broad-minded experimental jazz community, it makes less sense to speak of tracks than to talk about stories. Each of the four lengthy performances on his new album with Natural Information Society unfolds slowly and consequentially, with a sense of abstract narrative. On the nearly 24-minute “In Memory’s Prism,” Abrams keeps the underlying bass line — played on the guembri, and indebted to North African music — almost unchanged while the harmony and instrumentation slowly shift above. (At various times, there’s harmonium and trumpet and autoharp and bass clarinet in there, to name a few.) It all has the implacable momentum of migration, or the feeling of a big new idea just coming into being. At the very least, it will put your mind in a place of peaceful wandering; by the end, you’re likely to wind up deep in your own imagination, remembering or inventing a story of your own. RUSSONELLO If this track is any indication, Josephine Wiggs’s solo album due May 17, “We Fall,” is a far cry from her stint as a founder and bassist in the Breeders. “Time Does Not Bring Relief” is a droney, Minimalist instrumental built on echoing piano figures, a major chord with a recurring dissonance, quiet glitchy sounds and fleeting appearances from string-section lines and a drumbeat. It’s meditative, while it hints at unresolved tensions. PARELES "

Those numbers gave Eilish the second-largest sales week of the year so far, behind only Ariana Grande, whose “Thank U, Next” debuted with 360,000 units in February. Eilish’s album succeeded across formats: Its streaming total was the third-highest ever for a female artist (behind Grande and Cardi B), while the LP also sold 15,000 copies on vinyl, Billboard reported, the best sales week in that format this year. [Watch how Billie Eilish is redefining teen-pop stardom.] At No. 2 on the Billboard 200 chart is Nipsey Hussle, the Los Angeles rapper who was shot and killed on March 31. Interest in his music surged amid the outpouring of grief in the wake of his death, leading “Victory Lap,” his major-label debut from last year, to its biggest week yet. “Victory Lap” (Atlantic) debuted at No. 4 in March 2018, but surpassed those totals following his slaying, with 62 million streams and 17,000 in sales for a total of 66,000 units. Grande’s “Thank U, Next” (Republic) is No. 3 in its eighth week on the chart, owing largely to another 63 million streams, while George Strait’s “Honky Tonk Time Machine” is No. 4, with 44,000 in sales and 7 million streams. “Death Race for Love,” by the emo rapper Juice WRLD, is No. 5.

But this week, he added another, somewhat grander, title to the list: Eurovision winner. Well, sort of. White, 43, was added to the list of composers of Netta Barzilai’s “Toy,” an infectious pop anthem about female empowerment, accompanied by a chicken dance, that won the 2018 Eurovision Song Contest for Israel. “Toy” was widely praised for bringing a fresh direction to the contest. The Guardian said it “reignited Girl Power for the #MeToo generation.” But some pointed out that its chorus had a certain resemblance to the White Stripes’ “Seven Nation Army,” whose main riff is widely used in sports chants. “Let’s hope Jack White doesn’t hear this song before the Eurovision Song Contest” Ben Shalev, the music critic for the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, wrote last March. “He may sue.” In June, weeks after the contest in Lisbon, Universal Music Group wrote to Doron Medalie and Stav Beger, the writers credited for “Toy,” asking them about the resemblance. KAN, the Israeli state radio broadcaster, revealed that an agreement had now been reached, and White had been added to the song’s credits, according to Haaretz. White did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday. Amnon Szpektor, who was head of media for Israel’s entry in 2018, said the agreement included a confidentiality clause, and so neither Medalie nor Beger could comment. Netta was also unavailable, he said. “That’s a hole she would not want to fall in,” he added. This year’s Eurovision is scheduled to be held in Tel Aviv in May, and there are already calls for a boycott from some supporters of Palestinians, especially members backers of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, known as B.D.S.

5c799e0d49f0eacbf105af05,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/01/arts/music/carnegie-hall-migrations-festival.html,"The idea that the diaspora experience is central to America’s narrative is famously expressed in Emma Lazarus’s sonnet at the Statue of Liberty, with its celebrated line, “Give me your tired, your poor/Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.” Our immigration ethos, and an exploration of immigrants’ contributions to American arts and culture, are at the heart of Carnegie Hall’s Migrations: The Making of America festival, which is set to begin on March 9 and run through May 19, and will include concerts at the hall, as well as programming at 80 partner institutions around New York. (Each organization produces its own events.) [Check out our Culture Calendar here.] The goal, according to Clive Gillinson, Carnegie Hall’s executive and artistic director, is to examine the indelible link between the mass movement of people over the past century and American history. “We are inviting audiences to look more closely at how the migrations of people to and within this country, and the evolution of art forms that they have developed here, have been powerful influences on the creation and development of American culture,” he said in a statement. Carnegie Hall will amplify the musical legacies of three migrations: the arrival of Eastern European and Russian Jews between 1881 and 1924; the Irish and Scottish migrations of the 18th and 19th centuries; and the Great Migration of African-Americans from the rural South to the big cities of the Northeast, Midwest and West between 1917 and the 1970s. Three headlining shows will represent musical culture, with traditional Scots, Irish and American folk music; Yiddish musical theater; and jazz and blues. [Read about Jacob Lawrence’s famous paintings of the Great Migration.]  Six additional musical soirees (two per motif) will offer contemporary takes on the music — like new-fashioned renditions of Irish and Celtic sounds and klezmer rhythms infused with soulful bluegrass — highlighting how immigrants’ artistry often straddles cultures in America’s melting pot. Cultural events presented by partners will be broader in scope. Such interdisciplinary events, from the Museum of the City of New York, El Museo del Barrio and American Irish Historical Society, examine issues surrounding identity, cultural diffusion and what it means to be an American. More than 100 exhibitions, panels, dance performances, concerts and culinary events are planned. For many institutions, the festival provides a welcome platform to draw attention to the distinct experiences of their communities. The YIVO Institute for Jewish Research, for example, has delved into its extensive archives and has organized an exhibition of prescient cartoons published in Der Groyser Kundes, the Lower East Side’s premier Yiddish satirical weekly paper in the early 1920s. The exhibition, “The Door Slams Shut: Jews and Immigration in the Face of American Reaction,” focuses on New York’s idiosyncratic history in welcoming migrants. “Because our collection has such a large number of documents and artifacts relating to immigration, it just seemed like a perfect fit to explore these complex dynamics,” Eddy Portnoy, YIVO’s director of exhibitions, said in a phone interview. The China Institute, a nearly 100-year-old nonprofit organization, will host an immigration-related panel with the award-winning playwright David Henry Hwang (M. Butterfly) and the musician Du Yun on March 13. More information is at carnegiehall.org/migrations.  "
5c869c2e49f0eacbf105c738,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/11/arts/music/chicago-symphony-orchestra-strike.html,"A new round of labor upheaval hit the classical music world on Sunday night, when the musicians of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, one of the finest ensembles in the nation, went on strike in an effort to preserve their defined-benefit pension plan. The players — who are among the best-paid in the field, earning a minimum annual salary of $159,000 last season, and often more — began walking a picket line outside Orchestra Hall on Monday morning. In recent years, ticket sales have covered an ever-smaller portion of the cost of putting on classical performances. That has put pressure on orchestras to raise more money from donors — but also to try to cut expenses, leading to tensions with their unions. This fall, the Lyric Opera of Chicago’s orchestra went on a brief strike and wound up agreeing to a contract guaranteeing fewer weeks of work. Two seasons ago, the Philadelphia Orchestra, the Pittsburgh Symphony and the Fort Worth Symphony found themselves on strike simultaneously. There are several areas of dispute in the negotiations in Chicago, which have gone on for 11 months without an agreement, but the pension is the main sticking point. The orchestra’s management and board have warned that the growing expense of the current pension plan, which guarantees a set benefit for life after retirement, is unsustainable. They said in a statement that the orchestra contributed $3.8 million into the musicians’ pension fund this year — up from $803,000 just two years ago because of new federal requirements — and that those annual contributions were projected to continue rising sharply. Management’s proposal has called for switching the musicians into a defined-contribution plan, similar to a 401(k), in which the orchestra would put a set amount of money into individual retirement accounts for the players, who could invest it as they chose. Cynthia Yeh, a percussionist on the players’ negotiating committee, said in a statement that the defined-benefit plan “has been the hallmark of the orchestra’s benefits package (and those of other leading orchestras) for over 50 years.” She said the board’s proposal “strips the membership of that guaranteed benefit and shifts the investment risk to the individual member.” Helen Zell, the chairwoman of the orchestra’s board, said in a statement that “it would be irresponsible for the board to continue to authorize a pension program that jeopardizes the orchestra’s future.” While many other industries have shifted to cheaper defined-contribution plans in recent decades, defined-benefit plans remain the norm at the nation’s largest orchestras — and players around the country have made preserving them a priority. But many are underfunded. The American Federation of Musicians and Employers’ Pension Fund, a large multiemployer plan covering thousands of musicians, is currently considered “in critical status,” and if its condition worsens, it could trigger a rare move to cut the benefit payments for those already retired. Last week, as the deadline the Chicago players set for an agreement neared, the orchestra’s eminent music director, Riccardo Muti, wrote a letter supporting the musicians to Ms. Zell and Jeff Alexander, the orchestra’s president. “As music director and a musician of this orchestra, I am with the musicians,” Mr. Muti wrote, urging the management to “remember that theirs is not a job but a mission” and speaking of the performers’ need for “tranquillity and serenity.” Mr. Muti is scheduled to lead the orchestra in a program of Rossini, Vivaldi, Beethoven and Wagner on Thursday.

5c7fcdb549f0eacbf105b9d3,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/06/arts/music/solange-when-i-get-home-review.html,"Solange’s breakthrough 2016 album, “A Seat at the Table,” was a sweet-voiced, multilayered manifesto: the sound of one black woman finding her path forward and confronting the ways systemic racism and sexism affect personal struggles. Its successor, “When I Get Home,” is something different: a reverie, a meditation, a therapeutic retreat, a musicians’ playground. “With ‘A Seat at the Table,’ I had so much to say,” Solange said in an interview streamed from Houston on Sunday night. “And with this album, I have so much to feel.” For Solange, 32, “When I Get Home” is one more step away from ordinary pop expectations. Even before “A Seat at the Table,” she spiked her more conventional R&B albums with songs insisting she was different. Now she has nearly let go of the pop structures that undergirded “A Seat at the Table” and kept its songs catchy. “When I Get Home” is built for gentle, repeated immersion, not instant gratification. Its tracks prize mantras over hooks, and wander in structure and tempo, taking improvisational tangents. Although the album is punctuated by spoken-word interludes — bits of poetry, self-help, comedy and tribute — it is designed to flow as a whole, gradually infusing a room like incense or the smells of home cooking. The opening song, “Things I Imagined,” makes clear that Solange is offering floaters, not bangers. She sings, “I saw things I imagined” more than a dozen times, repeating the line or parts of it while continuously toying with the music: different melodies, different speeds, different chords, everything in a dreamlike flux. A labyrinthine transition leads to the optimistic, vaguely spiritual refrain that will also close the album: “Takin’ on the light.” The production, like nearly the entire album, uses layers of keyboards with improvisational tendrils and puffy, quavery, analog-sounding tones that hark back to 1970s Stevie Wonder, particularly “Journey Through the Secret Life of Plants.” And Solange’s voice is sure-footed and playful, confident that the music will follow her every whim. On nearly all of the full-length songs, Solange is credited as the sole composer and lyricist. She has a long list of guests — among them Playboi Carti, Gucci Mane, Earl Sweatshirt, The-Dream, Dev Hynes, Sampha, Scarface and Panda Bear from Animal Collective — but outside a few prominent guest raps, Solange and her musicians slip the collaborators into the background. This is her space, her sanctuary. As its title suggests, “When I Get Home” contemplates returning home and making a refuge there, reconnecting with memories and everyday surroundings that were once taken for granted. The black solidarity that was Solange’s strongest message on “A Seat at the Table” is still there in “Stay Flo” and in “Almeda,” where she praises “Black skin, black braids, black waves, black days” and insists, “These are black-owned things” over rattlesnake drum-machine accents. But most of the album has her musing on more private, domestic matters and looking inward. The home she invokes is the Third Ward in Houston, where Solange grew up. She returned there to work on this album following a period of upheaval. After a tour that was a model of abstract, starkly choreographed precision, Solange had severe health problems. As 2017 ended, she canceled a New Year’s Eve show because she was coping with an autonomic nerve disorder. Some tracks on “When I Get Home” are named after Houston streets, and Solange’s lyrics (as they were in “Scales” on “A Seat at the Table”) are dotted with references to the city’s idiosyncratic status symbols like grills (extravagantly jeweled dental caps) and “slab” (slow, low and bangin’) cars with reflective “candy paint.” Solange — echoing the artistic playbook of her sister, Beyoncé — paired the release of “When I Get Home” with an online film, which she directed and unveiled as an Apple Music exclusive. It’s a slightly abridged version of the entire album, accompanying non-narrative scenes of, among other things, black cowboys doing rodeo feats, a circular white arena holding group rituals in the desert, and dancers claiming Houston’s urban spaces. At the beginning and end of the film, Solange, in a glittering dress, dances alongside a mysteriously hooded Holy Ghost, revealed at the end as a black man. “The film is an exploration of origin, asking the question how much of ourselves do we bring with us versus leave behind in our evolution,” Solange said in a statement. The film visualizes “Sound of Rain” as a computer-animated extravaganza: a stadium full of dancers that turns into a garden, a burning man, people riding flying machines. The song is one of the album’s closest approaches to pop-R&B, with an ingenious beat, terse melodies and abundant countermelodies; the lyrics are cryptic and sunken into the mix, but at the end Solange reveals, “Sound of rain/helps me let go of the pain.” Another near-pop song is “Jerrod,” a promise of intimacy — “Give you all the depths of my wanting” — that Solange coos with the airy tenacity of Janet Jackson. For much of the album, Solange dissolves verse-chorus-verse into meditations and vamps. Keyboards supply rich chords that offer plenty of places to alight harmoniously; the beat is often an implied pulse that can and does leave behind 4/4 convention. In the chromatic haze, Solange ponders questions and considers life lessons in a few ambiguous words. In “Beltway,” she sings “don’t, don’t, don’t,” pauses, and continues, “you love me”; it’s impossible to tell where the couple stand. In “Dreams,” she recalls growing up with dreams and advises patience: “Dreams, they come a long way — not today.” She teeters on the verge of a relationship in “Time (is)” — “I was getting to feel/All the way” Solange sings — before its six-beat meter changes to five beats and Solange and Sampha each repeatedly sing an enigmatic line: “You’ve got to know.” And with hovering piano chords and hissing cymbal, “Down With the Clique” hints at the anticipation of Herbie Hancock’s “Maiden Voyage” as Solange reminisces, “We were rollin’ up the street/Chasing the divine.” In the interlude “Can I Hold the Mic,” Solange explains, rhapsodically: “I can’t be a singular expression of myself. There’s too many parts, too many spaces, too many manifestations, too many lines, too many curves, too many troubles, too many journeys, too many mountains, too many rivers, so many …” A keyboard follows each syllable of that speech, soon joined by chords to harmonize. The lilt of her voice alone could have carried these few seconds of content, but she and her musicians made the effort to match the rhythm and find its song. Because Houston is not her only home on this album; music is. "
5c881f6449f0eacbf105cb55,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/12/arts/music/hal-blaine-drummer-songs.html,"Hal Blaine, who died on Monday at 90, was the greatest and most prolific session drummer during the turbulent Sixties crescendo from pop to psychedelia, keeping the nation’s heartbeat through dozens of No. 1 hits during the Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon administrations. His résumé included ambitious art-rock totems, easy listening schmaltz, TV theme songs, incendiary folk-rock, Phil Spector’s “wall of sound” and Steely Dan’s smooth softscapes. His beats backed a hall of fame of mid-20th century icons, including Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley, the Beach Boys, the Supremes, Simon and Garfunkel, Sam Cooke, Barbra Streisand, Herb Alpert, John Denver and Leonard Cohen. But his most legendary beat is the primordial thump-thump-thump-crack heartbeat in the first four seconds of the Ronettes’ “Be My Baby.” Here’s just a fraction of what Blaine tapped into musical history. The first Phil Spector production that Blaine — the drummer for the producer’s Wrecking Crew session band — drove to No. 1. In the final 30 seconds, you can hear Blaine exploding outward from his steady pulse into a frenzy. “Phil Spector, God bless him, used to let me just go nuts on records,” Blaine told Modern Drummer. “I would go totally bananas on the endings of those songs. Phil has always said that he was going to take all the fades and put them together and put out some records of that.” Blaine wagered the creation of one of the most iconic opening drum beats of all time was “unintentional.” “Be My Baby” was possibly intended to have snare beats breaking up the pulse on 2 and 4 instead of just the big wallop at the end. In any event, its influence can be felt in the many songs that used similar beats in its wake: Billy Joel’s “Say Goodbye to Hollywood,” the Boys’ “Brickfield Nights,” the Jesus and Mary Chain’s “Just Like Honey,” Poison’s “Cry Tough” and Bat for Lashes’ “What’s a Girl to Do” among them. Blaine would eventually be known for his steady backbeats, but he can be heard playing wild fills all over this soul classic. “That was another one with that same drum lick every eight or 16 bars, whatever it was,” Blaine told NPR. “And all these drum licks kind of became the standard for rock ’n’ roll. You know, all the drummers that I’ve spoken with through the years have told me that they grew up listening to the records that I played on, and that’s how they learned.” Naturally, the Who’s Keith Moon was a fan, as was the Rush drummer Neil Peart. “When I was growing up, I played along to the radio,” Peart said in 2011, “so I played along to Simon and Garfunkel, the Beach Boys, the Association and the Byrds, and I was really playing along to Hal Blaine.”  The producer Terry Melcher wasn’t sold on the instrumental prowess of the Byrds so it was the Wrecking Crew session team that anchored the song most responsible for the advent of “folk rock.” Blaine’s brushes on the snare are nuanced and dynamic, but the real iconic element of “A Taste of Honey” is his four-on-the-floor bass drum. This was another happy accident. Blaine said the band was coming in “like a train wreck,” so he provided a pulse. It became the most memorable part of the song. The Beach Boy Mike Love wrote of his bandmate Brian Wilson: “When we’d go to Brian’s house, he would play [“Be My Baby”] over and over again, comparing it to Einstein’s theory of relativity.” Inspired by Spector’s wall of sound techniques, Wilson created “Good Vibrations,” a single that was epochal for its orchestral ambitions, studio-as-instrument techniques and early embrace of electronic music via the whining Electro-Theremin. Who better to anchor it to pop than one of Spector’s drummers of choice? “My particular sound for Brian,” Blaine wrote in his autobiography, “was basically the Phil Spector sound with a few minor changes. … Afterwards, I would overdub percussion effects. I was invited to experiment, and I don’t ever remember Brian telling me not to play anything.” Though this chamber-pop song is mostly forgotten, it still knocked the Monkees’ “Last Train to Clarksville” out of the No. 1 spot in late 1966. Blaine’s high-hat work here — opening, striking, then closing for a pssssshp — has been credited by Drum magazine as integral for moving the sizzling sound from jazz to rock. It has since became a bedrock element of dance music. Blaine plays drums on four of Simon and Garfunkel’s five studio albums, providing the tasteful accompaniment on No. 1 singles “Mrs. Robinson” and “Bridge Over Troubled Water.” But check out the apocalyptic Top 20 hit “A Hazy Shade of Winter,” first released in 1966 before appearing on the 1968 album “Bookends,” for a missing link between Motown and punk rock. Blaine’s work with Nancy Sinatra would yield bigger hits — most notably “These Boots Are Made for Walkin’” and the duet with her father “Somethin’ Stupid,” both No. 1 hits. But this papa-was-a-rolling-stone single allowed the consummate sideman to stretch his legs (and arms) with monstrous tom-tom fills. Blaine brought a massive drum kit to accompany Sinatra for her performance on 1971 TV special “Movin’ With Nancy on Stage.” “I did a solo on the show, which was the first time anyone ever saw that set, so everybody just went crazy,” Blaine told Modern Drummer. “I gave it all to Ludwig. I expected them to call it the Hal Blaine super set or something. But they called it the Octoplus, and it was one of their biggest sellers.” Looped to play three times, Blaine’s funky opening beat (and Jim Gordon’s percussion) on this Monkees classic was the first thing you heard on the first volume of Ultimate Breaks and Beats, the record series that served as an essential D.J. and producer tool in the 1980s. Twenty years after it was recorded, Blaine would end up the unwitting participant in hip-hop records like Run-D.M.C.’s “Mary Mary” (1988), De La Soul’s “Change in Speak” (1989) and Big Daddy Kane’s “Pimpin’ Ain’t Easy.” A song at the crossroads of psychedelia, soul, pop and Broadway, Blaine moves from a deconstructed “Be My Baby,” to locomotive rock to groovy funk. Proving himself ever versatile, Blaine’s last era of chart success and prolific session work was during the late Seventies and early Eighties explosion of pop-country artists like Shelly West (“Jose Cuervo”), John Denver (“I’m Sorry,” “Thank God I’m a Country Boy”) and era-appropriate works by Emmylou Harris and Johnny Cash. On Tanya Tucker’s “Lizzie and the Rainman” — a No. 1 country hit and a Top 40 pop crossover — Tucker says “beat the drum” in the middle of each chorus and Blaine plays a bonkers descending drum fill that pans across the speakers. It sounds like it was pulled from a Rush record instead of something that broke the Adult Contemporary chart. "
5c97d50849f0eacbf105ec89,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/24/arts/music/review-leon-botstein-american-symphony-orchestra-carnegie-hall.html,"“Julietta,” a 1930s opera by the Czech composer Bohuslav Martinu, has long been a rarity outside the composer’s homeland. One problem may be the surreal story. The residents of an isolated coastal town have no memories of anything before the present moment. Whenever strangers show up, which isn’t often, they are forced to tell the townspeople their stories; appropriating someone else’s memories is at least better than having none. But, of course, those stories are soon forgotten. Then Michel, a bookseller from Paris, arrives in search of a girl he’d heard singing three years earlier. Her voice has haunted him since. The work was an auspicious success at its 1938 premiere in Prague. But, beyond its convoluted plot, the score, for all its harmonic lushness and myriad colorings, has been deemed frustratingly episodic and stylistically eclectic. Leon Botstein, the conductor and tireless champion of overlooked works, considers “Julietta” an operatic masterpiece that at least deserves a place in the repertory. On Friday at Carnegie Hall, he  made his case by leading a winning cast and the American Symphony Orchestra in a vibrant concert performance. Martinu (1890-1959) is best known today for his orchestral works. But during his career, which took him to Paris between the two world wars and, in 1941, to the United States, he was absorbed by opera, including experimental works incorporating film. He adapted a Czech libretto for “Julietta” from a French play (subtitled “The Key of Dreams”) by Georges Neveux, who pronounced the opera superior to his play. Given the popularity of television dramas and films steeped in phantasmagoria and creepiness, “Julietta” could fit our cultural moment. The opera’s engrossing mix of bleak humor and Kafkaesque confusion starts in the opening scene, when Michel (the tenor Aaron Blake) encounters a young boy who accuses him of making things up. The stranger’s arrival soon has residents abuzz during a bustling scene at a market. A police chief, impressed with Michel’s memory, declares him the new town captain. Before long, though, the chief forgets this pronouncement, as well as his own position. Martinu’s musical language is a hybrid. There are nods to the Czech heritage of Dvorak and Smetana. During hazy, atmospheric passages you hear echoes of Debussy. Scenes alive with pulsing frenzy recall the Stravinsky of “Petrushka” and “Les Noces.” Martinu’s vocal writing follows the cadences of the Czech words, even during romantic scenes that seem ripe for soaring melody. In the town, Michel finds the girl he’s been searching for, Julietta (the soprano Sara Jakubiak). When she first sees him, she thinks her beloved, having sailed away, has finally returned. But they have never really been together, Michel tries to explain. Julietta’s fraught vocal lines here almost take off into stretches of radiant lyricism buffeted by plush orchestral sonorities. Yet, like her memory, the melodies are short-lived. The opera comes to a climax in Act II when Julietta, looking at postcards from a memory vendor, imagines the sojourns she and Michel have shared. This just provokes Michel to wrenching despair and, finally, fury. The orchestra does the heavy lifting in advancing the drama, including during many stretches of spoken dialogue, accompanied by a few solo instruments or a florid piano, or, at times, skittish symphonic bursts. Act III shifts to a Central Bureau of Dreams, where an official explains to Michel that he has just been dreaming. So it’s all a dream? I found this revelation too pat. And it comes fairly late in a long score (nearly three hours of music) that sometimes feels inflated Mr. Blake — an endearing and sweet-sounding Michel, sung with youthful fervor and stamina — led an excellent cast. Ms. Jakubiak brought a rich, earthy, expressive voice and disarming vulnerability to Julietta. The robust tenor David Cangelosi doubled as the police chief and the clerk. Other versatile cast members also sang multiple smaller roles, including Alfred Walker as the memory vendor and a mysterious man in a helmet; Rebecca Jo Loeb as the young boy and a bellhop; and Tichina Vaughn as an ominous palm reader who tells of the past rather than predicting the future. I hope these dedicated singers get a chance to perform their roles again. Mr. Botstein has done his part by bringing a worthy and original opera to attention. "

Grande’s fourth career No. 1 album comes during a prolific, artistically redefining period for the singer, whose last release, “Sweetener,” debuted atop the chart in late August with 231,000 units sold. Since then, Grande has used the fuel of her tabloid moments for music, earning her first No. 1 single on the Billboard Hot 100 (“Thank U, Next”) and then another with “7 Rings” last month. This week, the singer is attempting to top the Hot 100 for a third time with the song “Break Up With Your Girlfriend, I’m Bored.” Grande’s craftily dedicated fans even instituted a #Boycott7Rings campaign in the hopes of getting listeners to give more streams and sales to its follow-up. According to Billboard, the 307 million on-demand streams for songs from “Thank U, Next” mark the highest-ever one-week total for a pop album; of the Top 20 largest streaming weeks, “Thank U, Next” is No. 9 and the only non-hip-hop album on the list. Also on this week’s chart, No. 2 and No. 3 are both movie soundtracks: “A Star Is Born,” featuring Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper, is in second place ahead of the Academy Awards on Sunday, while “Bohemian Rhapsody” is right behind it. Last week’s No. 1, A Boogie Wit da Hoodie’s “Hoodie SZN” is No. 4 and Post Malone’s “Beerbongs & Bentleys” is No. 5. The album of the year winner at last week’s Grammy Awards — Kacey Musgraves’s “Golden Hour” — re-entered the chart entirely, landing at No. 9 with 35,000 units, including 20,000 in album sales. "
5c51e5ad3a125f5075c07251,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/30/arts/music/cherry-glazerr-stuffed-and-ready-review.html,"Clementine Creevy, the songwriter, singer and guitarist who leads Cherry Glazerr, has unabashedly grown up in public, claiming allegiances and postures on the way to finding herself. On the band’s third album, that means having far more quandaries than answers but making the struggles mean something. As a teenager, Creevy was a proud representative of a do-it-yourself Los Angeles rock scene, which had somehow preserved the scrappy idealism of the punk era from decades before she was born. Now, 22 years old and three albums into a career that has also included television exposure (with a recurring role leading the band Glitterish on “Transparent”) and modeling (for the designer Emma Mulholland), she sounds less guarded and more direct than ever, owning up to confusion and insecurity even as her guitar riffs counterattack. On Cherry Glazerr’s “Apocalipstick,” in 2017, she juggled misgivings alongside bravado, sass and bohemian solidarity in songs like “Trash People” and “Told You I’d Be With the Guys.” But with the band’s new “Stuffed & Ready,” she is decidedly on her own. “I don’t wanna try to pretend like I know what’s happening,” she sings in “Stupid Fish,” one of the album’s grungy manifestoes, then adds, “Maybe I’m mad ‘cause I see myself in you.” [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] Creevy was 15 when she uploaded home-recorded songs to SoundCloud in 2012, under the name Clembutt. They caught the attention of the independent label Burger, which initially released them on the cassette “Papa Cremp” in 2013. The band remade some of those first songs for Cherry Glazerr’s official debut album, “Haxel Princess” in 2014, followed by the more professionally produced “Apocalipstick” and now “Stuffed & Ready.” The band lineup has changed around her with each album; there’s no question who’s in charge. While Creevy’s music has stayed grounded in 1980s and 1990s alternative rock — bands like the Breeders, Siouxsie and the Banshees and the Cure — she has expanded her sounds and dynamics with each album. Live, Cherry Glazerr is a guitar-bass-drums trio, but in the studio, the band uses layers of guitars and occasional dollops of synthesizer to make each song evolve from within: fragile or eerie at one moment, ironclad the next. Creevy’s voice is high and thin but determined, and bolstered by the studio; her melodies take unexpected, angular leaps, while her guitar parts underline her solitude or blast it away. Throughout the album, the songs negotiate intimacy and independence, responsibility and personal needs. In “Daddi,” she grapples with her own reflex of deferring to a man. The verses are high, hesitant, whispery lines — “Where should I go Daddi/What should I say” — but a drum stomp and a blaring guitar take over for the chorus: “Don’t hold my hand, don’t be my man.” She worries about her cultural role in “That’s Not My Real Life,” a barreling punk rocker: “The suits, they don’t want me to go/They just want me to bear it all for all the women.” At the album’s midpoint, she slows down to ballad speed and guiltily craves time for herself in “Self Explained” and “Isolation.” But by the end, she’s back in the fray. In “Distressor,” she moves from home and seclusion — hollow, circular guitar-picking patterns — to the powerful mask of performing onstage: “I just wanna drown in my own noise,” she sings, with a drumbeat looming under her voice and, soon, a titanic, heaving guitar riff. At the end, she’s shouting: “So I can just be!” "
5c3761363a125f5075c03bd3,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/10/arts/music/artists-to-watch-2019.html,"The dream of the ’90s is alive in Rat Boy’s punk rock. Here are 10 more artists our pop music critics will be keeping an eye on in 2019. [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] When she’s gently strumming an acoustic guitar and singing about love in her reedy, tremulous mezzo-soprano, the 21-year-old Jade Bird might seem to fit a soothing, long-established singer-songwriter mold on “Love Has All Been Done Before.” But that’s only until she gets riled. Then her rock band kicks in, her voice gets rough and her words turn pointed and pitiless. And when full fury takes over, she starts spitting lines at rap speed. She’s no pushover. Her debut album is due April 19. JON PARELES This Los Angeles rapper has a quixotic, charismatic flow, spilling words past the end of lines with a pinched, tart voice that recalls the earliest Los Angeles gangster rap. On the recent mixtape “Famous Cryp,” he’s vibrant but protean, still figuring out the boundaries of his skill. But songs like “DM,” “Bleed It” and “Thotiana” are terse, bawdy and infectious. JON CARAMANICA Nicola Cruz is an electronic musician, producer and D.J. from Ecuador who has already made a reputation on the international club circuit. Instead of putting electronic sounds in the foreground, he builds tracks from loops and improvisations that are likely to come from ancient instruments, particularly Andean ones like wood flutes, percussion and small guitars — though he might also try a sitar. The artificial pieces he constructs sound oddly natural. His second album, “Siku” — named after an Andean panpipe — comes out Jan. 25. PARELES Billie Eilish’s debut album is likely to appear this year, and while she’s only 17, she is no unknown. Since her initial SoundCloud postings in 2015, her online releases have drawn hundreds of millions of Spotify streams and have made her a tour headliner. The songs she writes with her brother and producer, Finneas O’Connell, are usually hushed ballads that glance back at Lana Del Rey and Lorde. Her voice is whispery and sweetly tearful with a steely undercurrent, and it stakes out a particular persona: passionate and vulnerable but also vindictive and treacherous. Onstage, she gets thousands of voices singing along. PARELES In current country, Fleetwood Mac and the Eagles loom as large as Hank Williams and Loretta Lynn once did. Lauren Jenkins writes and sings about disappointment, disillusion, drinking and holding on despite it all with a Stevie Nicks rasp in her voice. Her debut album, “No Saint,” is set for March 15, and it surrounds her most bitter tidings with gleaming guitars and bright harmonies. PARELES LeeBrian, a young Puerto Rican rapper, is the first artist signed to the label of Sky, the producer responsible for hits by J Balvin (and others). LeeBrian is a nimble, flexible vocalist — sometimes agitated, sometimes preternaturally relaxed, and often toggling between both, like on the whimsical “Goku Sin El Ki.” CARAMANICA Lil Tjay is an exuberant, sweet-voiced singer-rapper from the Bronx with an easy instinct for melody. What helps him stand out from the current overstuffed class of artists with similar aesthetic approaches is his comfort moving between both light and dark subject matter, as on the hit “Brothers” and “Long Time.” CARAMANICA Over the past few years, this Texas native has found success in Nashville as a songwriter for Brett Eldredge among others. But listening to her recent debut album, the soothing and lovely “Borrowed Heart” — some of which was written with Lori McKenna — that work for others sounds superfluous. She’s got a sturdy, rich voice, and a way of bending a song toward sadness, where she sounds right at home. CARAMANICA The South African songwriter Nakhane Touré is also a novelist and actor whose works deal with a fraught upbringing: He broke away from conservative Christian “conversion therapy” to prize his identity as a gay man. The songs on his album “You Will Not Die” — released in Europe last year and due Feb. 22 in the United States — delve into both trauma and redemption. They ponder faith, pleasure, exile and belonging; they traverse hymns, neo-soul, South African pop and electronic dance music, and Nakhane’s voice crests in a vibrant, androgynous falsetto. Tenacity carries him toward joy. PARELES Of all the members of the YBN hip-hop collective, none shows more promise than YBN Cordae, a North Carolina rapper who specializes in thoughtful, emotionally eloquent and lyrically complex music. On songs like “Kung Fu,” he’s impressively dexterous, and of all the rappers who’ve taken swipes at J. Cole recently, only he handed any blows. CARAMANICA "
5c6ac96a3a125f5075c0a44e,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/18/arts/music/kacey-musgraves-grammys.html,"If you ask Kacey Musgraves — the country singer-songwriter who won four Grammy Awards last Sunday, including album of the year — how her week has been, you’ll get a pretty good idea of her default manner. “Mehhh,” she said playfully over the phone Friday evening, after a few days of letting it all sink in. “I’ve had better.” Her tongue-in-cheek deflection spoke to the shock that a progressive, psychedelic-drug-using Nashville misfit from Texas could have beaten Cardi B, Drake and Kendrick Lamar for what remains the highest annual honor in music. [See how Kacey Musgraves made the “Golden Hour” song “Slow Burn.”] “Golden Hour,” Musgraves’s third major label album, was critically beloved, but had barely been embraced by country radio — still the genre’s mainstream driver — and was far from a smash. Ahead of the Grammys, the album had totaled about 310,000 in sales, compared to many millions for the favorites in the top categories. Still, in addition to her first album of the year, Musgraves won Grammys for best country album, best country solo performance (“Butterflies”) and best country song (“Space Cowboy”), bringing her career total to six. In Musgraves’s first interview since her Cinderella moment, the singer reflected on this year’s Grammys, her place in the Nashville scene and what’s to come. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. Congratulations on a big night. How have you been celebrating? Lots of R & R time. Definitely happy moments with the team, but also celebrating with food. Enjoying having some burgers — note the plural nature. My husband and I had some down time together — spa time, which is a way that I like to take a break. But I’m already back to a week of shows. And how did you celebrate that night — did you go hard or just crash at the hotel?  I went really hard at Fatburger. I’m not like, hugely into an after-party scene, usually. I kind of like celebrating on my own terms. But we did stop by. And then afterward, not only did I have a fried chicken sandwich doused in buffalo sauce, but I also had a cheeseburger with jalapeños on it, and I ate both, 100 percent, and fries. I sat there and ate it in the restaurant in my Valentino dress. I went straight from shaking Mick Jagger’s hand to having a fried chicken sandwich in my hand. What do you remember about the moment your name was called for that final award? Disbelief, in general. But weirdly, a sense of calmness. Leading up to an award like that, you have a little hope, I think, that maybe you’ll win. But I was fine with not winning because it was just such a crazy compliment to be nominated alongside such giant albums. Huge albums that garnered lots of attention, lots of sales, lots of radio play. So you can hope that you may have a small chance, but I definitely was nowhere near banking on anything. It was a really beautiful moment, and I was somehow able to find the words to get out what I wanted to say. I don’t think it’s something that you can process until way later. Who’s the funniest person who has contacted you to say congratulations? Any heroes, exes or elementary-school enemies? Definitely some randoms. Nothing too crazy. No exes, for sure. [Laughs] Six Grammys now — where are you going to put them all? Well, I’m a little limited on shelf space at the house — we have a small house! I was thinking maybe I’ll give one to my grandma. One for my parents to keep. Maybe one in the car — on the hood of the car, so everyone knows. Any standout Grammy moments from behind the scenes? If you could’ve seen us quick-changing into my Dolly Parton outfit and giant hair in a matter of seven minutes, that would’ve been something to see. If I would’ve just walked away from that night having just performed with Dolly, that would’ve felt like the win of a lifetime for myself, because she is the ultimate, as far as I’m concerned. Obviously the Grammys got some flak last year about its representation of women, and this year was an attempt at a makeup. How do you think the show did? I think the Grammys definitely made up for last year’s lack of female representation, but the credit also has to go to the women who are the ones making the art. You never want to think that there’s a crazy influx — a 180 from last year — because of [tokenism]. It would be a shame to feel that way. But in this case there were a lot of really beautiful pieces of work released. So I’m not going to think about it that much. You haven’t always been embraced by the Nashville establishment. Were you surprised that you cleaned up in the country categories? Country music itself and the Nashville community have always shown me great support and love from the beginning. When I first moved to town, about 11 years ago, I got a giant education from the Nashville songwriting community. I made a ton of friends, I worked really hard for years there before I was even an artist myself. So I feel really connected to that community, and I feel like they do have my back. That’s a whole different side of Nashville. The other side of it is country radio, which has its own problem with women. Do you expect them to look at you differently now? It’s been really amazing to see “Rainbow” have such a positive response on all genres of radio after the awards. Like I’ve said from day one, this album and none of my albums are created specifically for that end-goal, but if it ends up there, I’m more than grateful. Can we expect a new album in 2019? My goal, in general, is just to be able to stay somewhat inspired by something, and to be able to tap into some kind of creative vein. So I will go poke around and see if I can catch some kind of creative wind, songwise, at some point soon. There are a couple songs that I really like. I have no idea where that’s going to go, but that’s the fun of it — exploring until you can find something to start packing into the next snowball. "
5c4b5a853a125f5075c065de,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/25/arts/music/review-new-york-philharmonic-julia-wolfe.html,"The composer Julia Wolfe’s new multimedia oratorio concerns the 1911 Triangle shirtwaist factory fire. It was a prescient choice of subject. The fire — which took the lives of 146 garment workers, most of them young immigrant women — led to changes in workplace conditions and stirred debate over contentious issues of gender, labor and immigrants’ rights. But how much progress has been made over the past century? That question hovered over the New York Philharmonic’s premiere of Ms. Wolfe’s ambitious, heartfelt, often compelling “Fire in my mouth” on Thursday, a month into a partial government shutdown driven by bitterness over immigration policy. Ms. Wolfe took risks in writing this work, conducted by the Philharmonic’s music director, Jaap van Zweden, and directed by Anne Kauffman. (It anchors “Threads of Our City,” a series in Mr. van Zweden’s first season as music director exploring immigration.) How does a composer depict such a horrific story without melodrama? How to underscore the powerful old film footage and photos that this production projected over the orchestra — women dressed in ruffled shirts walking into factories; workers sitting at tables with sewing machines; the rubble of the decimated factory building — without the music coming across as mere soundtrack? The big things are right in this tautly structured 60-minute piece in four parts: “Immigration,” “Factory,” “Protest” and “Fire.” In an affecting touch, the chorus is made up of 146 women and girls, members of the excellent chamber choir the Crossing (Donald Nally, director) and the impressive Young People’s Chorus of New York City (Francisco J. Núñez, director). Ms. Wolfe’s choice of choral texts, mostly drawn from oral histories and speeches, shows great sensitivity. In “Immigration” she sets the words of a survivor recalling her trip to America: “five of us girls” taking “a big beautiful boat” that “took about 10 days,” everyone looking “to God knows what kind of future.” There is both heady optimism and a sense of dread in Ms. Wolfe’s music here, whole stretches of which render the words in thick, blocky chords, over an orchestra grounded by droning tones yet run through with fidgety inner details. Often a single word is turned into a battering ram: “10, 10, 10,” or “days, days, days.” Longer choral lines unfold in overlapping phrases, which blend words and choral textures into a haunting muddle. “Factory” begins with percussion evoking the clattering sounds of sewing machines. Most of the workers were Eastern European Jews and southern Italians. So Ms. Wolfe inventively juxtaposes a plaintive Yiddish folk song with a lively Italian tarantella-like piece. The way these songs are embedded in Ms. Wolfe’s agitated, heaving orchestra, they seem like alternative coping mechanisms for the oppressed. There are stretches in which the music of “Fire in my mouth” assumes its place in the multimedia whole a little too well. I liked it most when Ms. Wolfe went for something musically visceral or extreme, as in the climactic episode of “Protest.” The women’s choir sings relentless phrases espousing the determination of these immigrants to “talk like,” “look like” and “sing like” Americans. Then the girls’ choir, entering the hall from the aisles, sang a stark passage from a speech by Clara Lemlich, an activist leading a strike. Here, the choral refrains and orchestra layers built into piercing harmonies, like clusters out of Ives or Varèse, yet driven by Ms. Wolfe’s Minimalism-influenced rhythms. In one of the most gripping moments, the choristers raised actual scissors (specially chosen by Ms. Wolfe) above their heads in an eerie gesture that also added metallic slicing sounds to the musical textures. During the harrowing climax of “Fire” the music turned raw, brassy and blazing, with fractured rhythms, choral plaints that border on screeching, and chanted repetitions: “Burn like, burn like, burn.” Mr. van Zweden led a commanding account of a score that requires close coordination between disparate forces, and which ends with an elegiac final chorus in which the names of all 146 victims are tenderly sung to create a fabric of music and memory. Another elegy, an instrumental movement from Steven Stucky’s oratorio “August 4, 1964,” about Lyndon B. Johnson, opened the program. Then the Philharmonic’s principal clarinetist, Anthony McGill, was a superb soloist in Copland’s Clarinet Concerto, a piece that begins with a winding, wistful melody that segues into a feisty second movement: in this context, another, brighter side of urban life.

The Tom Petty archives keep yielding more, like this previously unreleased song about media posturing that rings true in 2019. Tersely and unhurriedly, he rejects posing for magazines or video — and by extension, if he were still alive, social media — to insist, “It was all that rang true/I did it for real and I did it for you.” The arrangement, even though it’s with a full band, is clearly preliminary. If Petty, who died in 2017, had finished it for an album, it would have had more gleam and filigree. But the emotion is irrevocable. JON PARELES Alicia Keys has recorded indelible women’s empowerment songs like “Girl on Fire” and “Superwoman.” But she also understands that changes in gender roles are complicated and constantly in flux — particularly for the mother of two sons. “Raise a Man,” whose co-writers include Terius Nash (The-Dream), is deliberately blurred in every way. It shuns crisp hooks for rippling, improvisational vocal lines; it loops through unresolved chords played by a cloudy string section. It’s a confession of love as vulnerability and connection: “Is it O.K. that I’m not independent?” she sings, “Is it O.K. that I show weakness?” But it’s also clear that she expects equal openness and respect from her partner: “I want what’s coming to me: perfection, protection.” PARELES Pomp and camp, all rolled into one barnstormer. The title track from Lizzo’s forthcoming album is ecstatic, comedic, bawdy and tragic, toggling between powerful blues-soul singing and jubilant, swinging rapping to convey emotion that’s serious and also so unexpected it can’t help but be sort of a laugh, too. JON CARAMANICA “Please Me” begins with all of the R&B from 1990 to 1993 compressed into a rock-hard diamond — signature Bruno Mars nostalgia. Then Cardi B arrives, fresh off her best rap album Grammy win, with her customary saucy salaciousness. Mars grooves and flirts, and Cardi barks demands; even though they had success last year with their first collaboration, the remix of Mars’s “Finesse,” they’re an unlikely pair. Mars is about precision, and Cardi expands to fill the space she’s given, and then some. On this song, the mood is a tug-of-war: breathe fast, then relax, then breathe fast again, then relax. And then it’s done. CARAMANICA Post-punk thrust, math-rock patterns and splintered lyrics mirror the daily dystopian media barrage in “On the Luna,” from “Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost — Part 1,” due March 8, the first of two Foals albums promised this year. Guitar and synthesizer parts overlap in dizzying stereo counterpoint as the 9/4 meter keeps things off-balance; Yannis Philippakis casts himself as a baby boomer singing about childhood memories and present-day regrets. “We had it all and we didn’t stop to think about it,” he realizes. PARELES Les Claypool, from Primus, and Sean Lennon reclaim Beatles (and Monty Python) psychedelia to set out the biography of Jack Parsons, a rocket-science luminary (at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory) who was also a devotee of Aleister Crowley’s Ordo Templi Orientis and its “sex magick” rituals. “Better be careful boys,” Lennon sings. “You just might set the world on fire.” The keyboard tones echo “Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds,” while the extended vocal-harmony coda (singing Crowley’s precepts “Do what thou wilt” and “Love is the law”) hints at “I Want You (She’s So Heavy).” And the video, paying homage to Terry Gilliam’s animations, makes clear just how phallic rockets are. PARELES Nubiyan Twist, a 12-piece band of young Londoners, sources its inspiration widely, from the Caribbean to the Bronx to Central Africa. The group’s guest on “Addis to London” is Mulatu Astatke, the pioneering Ethiopian vibraphonist, another eclectic thinker, who has studied music around the world, and was never content to espouse the traditional sounds or popular music of his homeland. At the start of this track he’s heard explaining the West African roots of the rhythm the band’s about to play. But the sounds of his native country are in there, too, particularly in the tilted minor mode of the harmonies. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO Mortality looms patiently over the folk-rock of “Time Is the Killer.” Rain Phoenix, the sister of the actors Joaquin and River Phoenix, sounds artlessly natural as she sings “Everybody’s lying when we say we’re not afraid,” over a modestly strummed acoustic guitar and a brushed-drums, reverb-laden folk-rock band. Michael Stipe’s occasional backup vocals arrive with fatherly sympathy. The tranquillity is stoic, far from oblivious. PARELES Most likely, you’ll go into a Sons of Kemet show looking forward to Shabaka Hutchings’s tenor saxophone, and you’ll leave buzzing about Theon Cross’s tuba. More than Hutchings, more than its double drummers, it is Cross’s thick, molten playing that pumps life into the upstart British jazz group. Now he is releasing his own album, “Fyah,” full of slamming, dancehall-influenced club tracks, driven by the fireworks between Cross and the drummer Moses Boyd. One piece that sticks out is the chiller “Ciya” — with Cross creating a seductive loop underneath as the alto saxophonist Nubya Garcia and the trombonist Nathaniel Cross, the bandleader’s brother, whisper a gentle sough of a melody. RUSSONELLO Working toward self-forgiveness after a divorce, “Moral of the Story” seesaws between fragility and pomp: from Ashe’s quavery high voice and parlor-song piano tinkling to a hefty, lurching beat and a massed chorus. “People fall in love with the wrong people sometimes,” she tells her mother and her lawyer in the verses. Behind the brave face, there’s still some regret. PARELES The new Avril Lavigne song “Dumb Blonde” — full of blunt horns, hard-slap percussion and lyrics sung in a voice that sounds computer generated — is so chaotic, cluttered and unnatural that when Nicki Minaj arrives two minutes in, she’s a calming force. That said, Minaj’s verse is tepid and tossed-off — perhaps as a reaction to the mayhem that precedes it, or perhaps because she knows well enough when a song will fade into the ether, and no one will remember anyway. CARAMANICA No. Just: no. PARELES Wadada Leo Smith rarely plays the trumpet on “Rosa Parks: Pure Love. An Oratorio of Seven Songs,” a 72-minute suite he composed for an ensemble that’s really many groups in one: three vocalists, four stringed instruments, four trumpets (including Smith), and a duo featuring drums and electronics. On “Rosa Parks: Mercy, Music for Double Quartet,” the strings and brass come together, stretching paper-thin but steely melodies across a lot of open space. Smith states in the press materials that the oratorio is dedicated to a woman “of exceptional courage and wisdom, who made the right move of resistance at the right time.” In that sentence you can almost hear Smith’s music: His slow, deliberate horn playing often sounds like a practice of resistance, and he always knows the right time to act. RUSSONELLO It’s easy for Matthew Shipp’s pelting, centrifugal piano improvisations — full of hard dashes, often in contradictory directions — to feel strident and strong. It’s a bigger feat when he plays toward an emotional middle-range, and on “Flying Saucer” (from a new album, “Signature”) he achieves it, staying around the center of the keyboard, sounding impatient but unruffled. It’s a joy to follow his ardent, two-handed flow, unfolding like a well-told surrealist narrative, and his joyful interactions with the bassist Michael Bisio and the drummer Newman Taylor Baker.

5c5c90823a125f5075c088d3,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/07/arts/music/grammy-awards-diversity.html,"The Grammy Awards are supposed to be music’s biggest party. But in recent years the show has also become a piñata for critics, activists and even major artists over a host of issues like race and gender — and, oh yes, music. The 61st annual show, to be hosted by Alicia Keys and broadcast live by CBS on Sunday night, should be no different. After a bruising time last year, when the show came under fire after just one woman won a solo award on the air — and the chief executive of the Recording Academy, Neil Portnow, commented that women in music should “step up” to advance their careers — the Grammys made a series of changes in their membership and nominations process that were meant to address their underlying problems. But in many ways the Grammys still walk a tightrope. And as the show tries to stay culturally relevant, while also balancing the demands of race and gender representation, it may be impossible to please everybody at once. “That moment kind of shed a light on an issue that needed attention, and that is a lack of diversity in the industry,” Portnow said in an interview this week. “And if the light that was shed becomes a catalyst for change, then you can feel that it had a reason and a value.” To viewers, one of the clearest changes will be that eight, instead of five, acts will now compete in the four major categories: album, record and song of the year, and best new artist. That change satisfied many critics by adding more women to the mix, but it also has made the contests harder to handicap. For album of the year, Drake and Kendrick Lamar, two deities of contemporary hip-hop, are up against Post Malone, who has topped the charts with a mellow style between rapping and singing; the boisterous rap of Cardi B; the adventurous R&B of Janelle Monáe and H.E.R.; and two singer-songwriters in the country and folk spheres, Kacey Musgraves and Brandi Carlile. If Carlile prevails, she would be the award’s first openly gay winner. But as an artist with minimal sales, would her victory make the Grammys seem out of touch with the masses? Will a rapper win, or will they cancel one another out on the ballot? There is also a chance that the award could go to Drake or Lamar only to have the winner not show up. That has become a growing risk for the Grammys as the show has alienated more and more hip-hop and R&B stars — like Drake, Kanye West, Jay-Z and Frank Ocean — by failing to give them the most prestigious prizes. “The fact of the matter is, we continue to have a problem in the hip-hop world,” said Ken Ehrlich, the longtime producer of the show. “When they don’t take home the big prize, the regard of the academy, and what the Grammys represent, continues to be less meaningful to the hip-hop community, which is sad.” Ehrlich said that this year he offered performance slots on the show to Drake, Lamar and Childish Gambino — whose song “This Is America” is up for four awards, including record and song of the year — but they all declined. Representatives of those three artists declined to comment on whether they would attend the show. More bad news for the Grammys arrived on Thursday afternoon, when Ariana Grande confirmed reports that she had pulled out after clashing with producers — apparently Ehrlich himself — over which song to perform. “I’ve kept my mouth shut but now you’re lying about me,” Grande wrote on Twitter, responding to an Associated Press interview in which Erhlich said that she “felt it was too late for her to pull something together.” “I can pull together a performance over night and you know that, Ken,” she wrote. “It was when my creativity & self expression was stifled by you, that i decided not to attend. I hope the show is exactly what you want it to be and more.” Last year was another flash point in the troubled history of the Grammys and hip-hop, as Jay-Z, the most nominated artist, with eight nods — including album, record and song of the year — went home empty-handed, and Lamar, while winning all five awards in the rap field, lost out on album of the year, to Bruno Mars. Three months later, Lamar won the Pulitzer Prize for music. “For the Pulitzers to get it right and the Grammys to get it wrong says a lot,” said Troy Carter, an artist manager and former Spotify executive. Portnow said he believed the Grammys had made good-faith efforts to reach out to artists, but the tensions have shown no signs of letting up. “We would hope that all nominees attend the show and be there as their own achievements are celebrated,” Portnow said, “because that’s really what it’s about.” But while race has been a growing problem for years, the Grammys’ most urgent issue is over gender. Last year, a report by the University of Southern California, released days before the show, found dismal numbers about the representation of women in the music industry and at the Grammys. Lorde, the only woman nominated for album of the year in 2018, was not offered a solo performance slot. After the show, Portnow’s “step up” comment drew an immediate outcry, with some women music executives calling for his resignation. (Portnow said at the time that his words had been taken out of context, and later announced that would leave his position at the expiration of his contract in July.) In response, the Recording Academy appointed a task force, led by Tina Tchen, a former chief of staff to Michelle Obama, to “identify the various barriers and unconscious biases faced by underrepresented communities” at the academy and in the wider industry. Working with the task force, the academy has tried to make its voting pool more diverse, inviting 900 new people, from a variety of backgrounds, to be members; of those, 22 percent accepted in time to vote this year, according to Laura Segura Mueller, the academy’s vice president of membership and industry relations. Last week the task force challenged the music industry to hire more women producers and engineers, two jobs that are overwhelmingly male. Even with these steps, this year’s nominations show just how much work is left to achieve real gender parity. On the eight songs up for record of the year, a total of 48 producers and engineers were credited, and only two were female. One of them is Lady Gaga, as a producer of “Shallow,” her song with Bradley Cooper from “A Star Is Born,” which is a strong contender for both record and song of the year. Lady Gaga is scheduled to perform, but that night Cooper will be at the Baftas, the British film awards. (Taylor Swift, who is up for just one award, pop vocal album, is also in London, filming an adaptation of “Cats,” and is not expected to attend the show.) And this week U.S.C. released an updated version of its report, showing that the numbers for women working in music have not improved. Looking at Billboard’s year-end Hot 100 list for the last seven years — a total of 633 songs, after removing duplicates — the report found that of 1,455 artists credited on those songs, only 17.1 percent were women. In another finding, only three of those 633 songs were credited solely to female songwriters. “This report really solidifies what we saw last year,” said Stacy L. Smith, the founder of U.S.C.’s Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, and the leader of the study, “and confirms that females are still facing an inclusion crisis in prominent positions in the music space.” Portnow said he viewed last year’s criticism as an opportunity to address important issues, and for the academy to take a leadership role in the industry. Not everyone will be happy, he said, but that’s O.K. “The underlying factors of what makes people happy or unhappy changes from year to year,” he said. “It might be something musical, or it might be something sociological, which is what we’re seeing more of in today’s climate. But that’s appropriate, because that’s the time in history we are living in.” "
5c6079b13a125f5075c08f84,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/10/arts/music/review-trifonov-recital.html,"By this point, it’s no surprise that Daniil Trifonov, one of the most awesome pianists of our time, can sell out Carnegie Hall. Still, that the hall was packed for the unusual recital program he played on Saturday was a testimony to the trust his admirers place in him. At 27, he is also an adventurer intent on exploring overlooked realms of the repertory. On Saturday it was thrilling to go along on his journey. (A video of the recital is available for viewing on medici.tv, which carried the performance live.) During the first half, lasting some 70 minutes with minimal breaks between pieces, Mr. Trifonov focused mostly on neglected — you might say orphaned — works by Beethoven and Schumann. He began with Beethoven’s “Andante Favori,” a lilting, lyrical yet elusive piece, and the original slow movement of Beethoven’s mighty “Waldstein” Sonata. The composer was persuaded by a colleague to publish this nine-minute andante separately. (For the “Waldstein,” he substituted a short, stark Adagio that serves almost as a transition between two monumental outer movements.) The “Andante Favori,” a rarity in concert, unfolds like a rondo. A beguiling theme keeps returning in more elaborate statements, with dramatic detours into contrasting sections, all qualities that Mr. Trifonov brought out in a subtle, nuanced and delicately articulate performance. Without a break, he then played Beethoven’s Sonata No. 18 in E-flat, a joyous, sometimes prankish piece that you don’t hear too often. Mr. Trifonov’s performance was so impetuous and slyly charming that the sonata came across with striking freshness: It could have been a four-movement improvisation. Then he turned to Schumann’s “Bunte Blätter” (Colored Leaves), a real curiosity. The 14 motley pieces of this publication, composed over 13 years, are mostly short, fantastical and quirky. One, titled “Albumblätter II,” is an onrushing frenzy of spiraling runs. “Novellette” is like some eerily relentless march. Yet there is no overall structure to Schumann’s compilation. This was the first time I’d heard them performed complete. While lavishing colorful, dazzling and imaginative playing on each piece, Mr. Trifonov managed to make “Bunte Blätter” seem like a 30-minute, brashly episodic yet dramatically urgent entity. Then he segued right into Schumann’s “Presto Passionato,” a near-crazed, six-minute whirlwind that the composer had written as the original finale to his Sonata in G minor. Clara Schumann talked him into writing a more understandable, less extreme final movement, which he did. This rejected, hellbent presto has mostly languished ever since. Mr. Trifonov dispatched the score’s tangles of passagework and breathless flights in a performance that balanced fearless command and wildness. I hope someday to hear him play that Schumann sonata with this original finale. After intermission he played a single 30-minute piece: Prokofiev’s Sonata No. 8 in B-flat. This program may have officially lacked a new or recent work, though Mr. Trifonov, also a composer, has hardly shirked contemporary music, especially during his Perspectives series last season at Carnegie. Yet, by giving Prokofiev’s Eighth such a prominent place on this program, in such a powerful, searching performance, he made the sonata seem audaciously modern. I especially loved the slightly dangerous quality he drew from the slow movement, which here sounded deceptively beguiling. He tore through the manic concluding movement, his playing exhilarating one moment, terrifying the next. Though this recital was a workout, Mr. Trifonov had enough stamina for encores: two of Prokofiev’s raw, pummeling “Sarcasms,” and a beautiful account of an arrangement of the slow movement from Chopin’s Cello Sonata.

Let us know at theplaylist@nytimes.com and sign up for our Louder newsletter, a once-a-week blast of our pop music coverage. There’s an insistent, syncopated pulse — but no drumbeat — behind “Jerrod,” an invitation to a timid lover from Solange’s new album, “When I Get Home.” She offers openness, intimacy and sharing: “Give you all the things that I want,” she promises, her voice nestling amid chromatic chords that refuse to resolve; her vocal phrases ride directly atop the bass line, then pull away. Nothing feels solid until the song segues into the next track, “Binz,” and the drums arrive. JON PARELES Like the birds returning from down south and the trees finding new color, the first Drake verse of 2019 heralds the coming of spring and, with it, the hope of new options on the horizon. Not the forced choices of cold-weather confinement, but the chance to seek out what you really want. On the original “Girls Need Love,” Summer Walker sang about her cravings with lethargic swing. On this remix, Drake arrives, the recent 10-year anniversary of his genre-reframing mixtape “So Far Gone” on his mind and on his tongue, to try to make amends on behalf of the less sensitive sex. “Arched back, deep stroke, white wine, weed smoke/that’s my best combination” he starts the flirt rapping, then downshifts into cooing. And this is the real spring awakening: a performance reminiscent of when his rejection of the boundaries between tender and tough was still raw. JON CARAMANICA A blur can be more tantalizing than something fully legible. Jackie Mendoza’s “Seahorse,” from an album due April 26, melts the edges of her vocals with echoes, reverb and stereo panning, while keyboards and guitars float in and drift around her. There’s a pop song near the surface, but it stays just out of reach. PARELES Angst wrapped in mockery surrounded by pop-history allusions with deniable lyrics bonded to endearing melodies — yes, Weezer has released a new album called “Weezer” with a parenthetical color (The Black Album). “High as a Kite” treats its cliché title seriously: “Miles above it’s so serene/I’m letting go of all the troubles that I’ve seen,” Rivers Cuomo sings, putting a yearning tone in his voice. The track summons the orchestral stateliness of late-1960s Beatles and Beach Boys alongside bird calls and distorted lead guitar, flaunting craft and keeping its attitude guarded. PARELES Justin Faulkner has a thrashing, teeming style on the drums — he attacks them — yet he exudes a reassurance that basically all the best drummers have. In striking that balance, he’s like Art Blakey and Elvin Jones. It might have something to do with the fact that Faulkner has effectively been taking a seminar in the music’s lineage for the past 10 years as the youngest member of the pre-eminent saxophonist Branford Marsalis’s quartet (he’s still only 27). On “The Secret Between the Shadow and the Soul,” the group’s third album featuring Faulkner, he shows he’s gone from being the most startling thing about this quartet to the best thing about it. RUSSONELLO Four banjo-wielding songwriters — Rhiannon Giddens, Amythyst Kiah, Leyla McCalla and Allison Russell — reckon with the history of slavery, particularly women’s slavery, on the album “Songs of Our Native Daughters,” drawing on slave chronicles and minstrel songs as well as contemporary perspectives. In “Moon Meets the Sun,” they harmonize in a song of tenacity, cultural survival and willed optimism: “Ah, you put the shackles on our feet but we’re dancing,” Giddens sings. “Ah, you steal our very tongue but we’re dancing.” PARELES This is going to sound meaner than intended but: think Wilson Phillips meets the Chainsmokers. CARYN GANZ “Footsteps,” the song that opens Kehlani’s new mixtape “While We Wait,” holds the lingering afterthoughts of a breakup, with apologies, justifications and regrets from both sides. The underlying beat is slow enough to make room for fitful, asymmetrical vocal lines, while backup vocals arrive to multiply the second guesses. “When I walked away I left footsteps in the mud so you could follow me,” Kehlani and Musiq Soulchild sing at the end, even as their melodies diverge like separate paths. PARELES The latest high-concept album from the electronic duo Matmos, arriving March 15, is “Plastic Anniversary,” which derives all of its sounds from plastic: tapped, plucked, rubbed, scraped, flexed, blown through like horns. “Breaking Bread” is constructed from samples of breaking and broken LPs by the group Bread. It goes for the comic, with a steady syncopated bounce, Caribbean-tinged riffs and an artificial zoo-full of squeaks, chirps, scrapes and plunks. Another track from the album, “Thermoplastic Riot Shield” — played on a clear shield emblazoned “Police” — is far more ominous. PARELES In May the first album from L7 in 20 years, the first album from Sebadoh in six years and the first album from Bad Religion in six years will all be released. All three bands started putting out music in the late 1980s, hit creative peaks in the 1990s and were never beholden to the record industry. Good news: Everyone remembers how to sound like themselves. GANZ “The Creator Has a Master Plan” is spiritual jazz’s signature piece, a glistening two-chord chant that’s like a warm aloe cleanse. Its own creator, the nonpareil tenor saxophonist Pharoah Sanders, has been performing “Master Plan” for the past 50 years. When Joey DeFrancesco decided to venture into spiritual-jazz terrain on his new album, “In the Key of the Universe,” the virtuoso organist was wise enough to enlist Sanders. All of this album is good, but most of it keeps contact with DeFrancesco’s bop comfort zone. Not “Master Plan.” It becomes the album’s highlight, almost inevitably. RUSSONELLO Jason Palmer’s “Rhyme and Reason” is the first release from Giant Step Arts, a nonprofit dedicated to giving underappreciated but visionary jazz musicians the support they need to make quality live albums. Palmer is a perfect first subject for this: He’s a thrifty improviser with a vast dynamic range and an ambitious composer, but he’s hardly known. On “Herbs in a Glass,” the album’s opener, he propels his band mates (the tenor saxophonist Mark Turner, the bassist Matt Brewer and the drummer Kendrick Scott) through a squirrelly nine-beat rhythm; the odd, open-ended meter ends up pushing his intense melody into the plain air, giving it a billowy freedom. RUSSONELLO Sitting at the Jazz Gallery recently as Anna Webber led a septet through the tunes from her latest album, “Clockwise,” I wrote down a lot. Here’s a little of it: splitting and scraping her tones … descended from hocketing and Western choral music and the World Saxophone Quartet and Battle Trance … Teutonic syncopation. Webber is a composer, saxophonist, flutist and more, with big ears and a bustling career underway. “Clockwise” is her first release for Pi Recordings, and a convincing one. It’ll certainly speed your mind up. RUSSONELLO "
5c61b4fb3a125f5075c091cd,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/11/arts/music/a-boogie-21-savage-billboard-chart.html,"It was a very quiet sales week in the music industry ahead of the Grammy Awards on Sunday night. With no major releases, and no debuts making it to the Top 15, the Bronx rapper A Boogie Wit da Hoodie’s “Hoodie SZN” (Highbridge/Atlantic) returned to No. 1 for its third nonconsecutive week atop the Billboard chart. Driven by steady streams, the album moved a total of 47,000 equivalent units, according to Nielsen Music, combining 68 million digital on-demand song plays and just 398 in traditional sales — a record low in sales for a No. 1 album, beating its own bottom-water mark of 823 from last month. (Neither of the album’s trips to No. 1 in January came during its debut week on the Billboard 200, a rarity on today’s charts.) “I Am > I Was,” the former chart-topper by the Atlanta rapper 21 Savage, climbed back to No. 2 from No. 8, following his arrest on Super Bowl Sunday by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. 21 Savage, whose album added another 40,000 units — with just 839 in sales — in its seventh week out, remains in ICE custody and is facing potential deportation proceedings because the government says he is in the United States illegally. Future’s “The Wizrd,” another recent No. 1, fell one spot to No. 3 this week, with 51 million streams and 1,600 in sales for a total of 40,000 units, while Travis Scott’s “Astroworld” is No. 4 in its 27th week on the chart. The soundtrack for “A Star Is Born,” another chart fixture in recent months, is No. 5 with 38,000 units as the film and album continue their path through awards season. Business should pick up next week: Ariana Grande, who has had two No. 1 hit songs so far this year, released “Thank U, Next,” her second album in six months last Friday, and is poised for another blockbuster debut. And then there’s the Grammys stimulus, which could lead to sales bumps for Sunday night’s stars, like Kacey Musgraves, Brandi Carlile, H.E.R. and Cardi B. Musgraves won album of the year for “Golden Hour,” which peaked at No. 4 last April. "
5c618c753a125f5075c0915e,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/11/arts/music/grammys-moments-best-worst.html,"The 61st annual Grammy Awards on Sunday worked to right the wrongs of the past few years’ ceremonies, where the leading narrative was tension over a lack of diversity and poor representation for the most influential young artists in music. Big stars still stayed home — and one of the biggest got cut off mid-speech — but the show corralled a former first lady and delivered many messages of inspirational uplift. Here are the highlights and lowlights as we saw them: Of all the major-category nominees at this year’s Grammys, none were more surprising than Brandi Carlile, the 37-year-old folk-rock — or rockin’ folk — singer and songwriter who earned six nods, including album of the year. But when she appeared on the Grammys stage, things became clear. Her performance of “The Joke,” a defiant anthem about tolerance, was genuinely startling (and vastly superior to the album version). Carlile’s vocals were robust, ragged, full of sneer and hope. On a night curiously light on impressive singing, it was an uncomplicated, genuine, cleansing thrill. JON CARAMANICA [Hear our pop music team break down the Grammy highs and lows.] Drake, who pointedly did not perform on Sunday night, claimed just his fourth Grammy in 42 tries — best rap song for “God’s Plan” — and he deigned to show up to accept it, taking the winner’s podium for the first time. (His previous awards were not televised, and he’s even clowned the show for giving “Hotline Bling” the best rap song trophy in 2017 “maybe because I’ve rapped in the past or because I’m black,” he said.) This time, he pulled a Fiona Apple and told the world it didn’t matter: “We play in an opinion-based sport, not a factual-based sport,” he said, seemingly legitimately nervous. “This is a business where sometimes it’s up to a bunch of people that might not understand, you know, what a mixed-race kid from Canada has to say, or a fly Spanish girl from New York, or anybody else, or a brother from Houston.” It was part motivational speech, part rebuke of gatekeepers, and all Drake, the most famous guidance counselor in the universe. “The point is, you’ve already won if you have people who are singing your songs word for word, if you’re a hero in your hometown,” he added. “You don’t need this right here, I promise you.” But when he gathered his breath to finish the sentiment, the show cut to commercial. Drake was not seen at the Grammys again, and given how hard it was to get him there in the first place, he might not be for a while. JOE COSCARELLI [Want to be heard during the Grammys? Maybe stay home, our critic writes.] If the tensions at last year’s ceremony left the Grammys in knots, Alicia Keys was a CBD oil rubdown: a soothing, self-assured earth mother prepared to “Kumbaya” the show into a place of solidarity and affection. “Do you feel that love in the building?” she announced at the top of the ceremony. “This is love, this is life, this is living, this is light, and all because of music.” She brought out Lady Gaga, Jada Pinkett Smith, Michelle Obama and Jennifer Lopez to speak about music as a vessel for empowerment and empathy. She twirled in a variety of outfits. She joked around with John Mayer and harmonized with Smokey Robinson. She had already logged oodles more screen time than any host in recent memory when she perched on a stool between two grand pianos and played one with each hand in a demonstration of technical badassery, then took a tour through songs she wished she had written (Roberta Flack’s “Killing Me Softly,” Juice WRLD’s “Lucid Dreams,” Kings of Leon’s “Use Somebody”), wrapping on her own Jay-Z collaboration “Empire State of Mind” like a humblebrag come to life. But she still ended the show on a note of grander uplift: “Let’s keep listening and loving each other.” CARYN GANZ [At a ceremony dominated by female performers and presenters, women took center stage.] Flanked by younger admirers for a patchwork tribute, Dolly Parton easily held her own, with her voice still twangy, feathery and persuasive. The start was shaky: Kacey Musgraves too tentative and Katy Perry too vehement before Parton righted the tone of “Here You Come Again.” Miley Cyrus made an admiring rival in “Jolene,” and Cyrus shared three-part a cappella harmony with Parton and Maren Morris in “After the Gold Rush,” a Neil Young song Parton has recorded with Linda Ronstadt and Emmylou Harris. Little Big Town gave Parton an arena-country buildup in the story-song “Red Shoes,” from the 2018 “Dumplin’” soundtrack, before the female-solidarity finale, “9 to 5,” in which Parton made sure to praise her recent songwriting collaborator and producer, Linda Perry, who was leading the band. Parton was all smiles, and all gumption. JON PARELES For a show that has traditionally shunted aside Latin music (leaving it to the Latin Grammys, a separate event altogether) — and has yet to really acknowledge the rising urbano wave — Camila Cabello’s opening number covered a lot of ground. Sure, it was centered around “Havana,” a No. 1 pop hit, but Cabello’s Cuba-via-Miami roots shone through, and she also managed to ground a performance that featured both Young Thug and Ricky Martin. (Guess which one was wearing diamond-encrusted boots.) J Balvin, the pop-reggaeton star from Colombia, popped up for an interlude of his hit “Mi Gente” — and held up a newspaper that read “Build bridges not walls” — while the Cuban-American jazz trumpeter Arturo Sandoval made himself heard throughout. For a show that’s traditionally a ballad-loving affair, the energy was welcome, as was diversity that didn’t just feel like lip service. COSCARELLI [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] Childish Gambino’s “This Is America,” the first-ever hip-hop song to be honored with a Grammy for song and record of the year, is fittingly self-conscious: rapped in clipped, referential phrases, with melodic sections and a smattering of uncredited ad-libs by some of the genre’s true recent innovators (Young Thug, 21 Savage, Quavo, BlocBoy JB). That none of them — including the song’s lead artist and writer, Donald Glover — bothered to show up and accept the trophy for the songwriters was also apt for a show that has long struggled with its handling of hip-hop, dating back to the first-ever rap award in 1989, when a number of the nominees boycotted. (Kendrick Lamar and Drake, the most nominated artists of the night, also declined to perform; the “This Is America” producer Ludwig Goransson accepted the second award.) But the first no-show led to an awkward dead-air moment as the presenters, Alicia Keys and John Mayer, shuffled around the stage, trying to figure out what to do next. One of Childish Gambino’s managers tweeted a shrug emoji. But what really underlined the sharp elbow of a nonappearance was that Glover did appear as part of the Grammys telecast, after all — starring in a cellphone commercial that aired more than once. COSCARELLI “Welcome to the Grammys,” Cardi B proclaimed one hour and 28 minutes into the Grammys, luxuriating atop a jewel-encrusted piano that would make Liberace blink. She started her performance of “Money” in a dramatic cape like a sexy vampire leopard, and ended it sporting a ring of feathers like the baddest peacock on the block. Her set of plush banquets evoked vintage glitz, but 20 dancers doing floor work, four more waving large fans and a flamboyant pianist — Chloe Flower — couldn’t steal attention from the main attraction. When she returned to the stage to accept the award for best rap album, she had switched modes: from swagger to heart. “I can’t breathe,” she said, struggling for a brief moment to organize her thoughts. An entire arena was ready to offer up their lungs. GANZ [See the full winners list.] During the 19-second fingerpicked introduction to the power ballad “Shallow,” Lady Gaga executed two full body hair flips, one side kick and seven exaggerated stabbing motions with her left arm, each punctuating plucks of Mark Ronson’s acoustic guitar. As she sang the verses to the song, the standout from “A Star Is Born,” she acted out seemingly the entire arc of rock stardom: drinking, doing cocaine and torturing a microphone stand. Lady Gaga is one of our most gloriously talented pop stars, and one of the most nerve-racking, because you never know when her tango with good taste will dip into disaster. In her attempt to make this performance of “Shallow” the most everything, she ended up with less. GANZ The first song on Kacey Musgraves’s album of the year winner, “Golden Hour,” is “Slow Burn,” a slightly psychedelic country ballad about how chill she can be — in love, in her career and just in general. Critically respected but largely ignored by the Nashville establishment, Musgraves spent most of Grammys night edging her way, patiently, into the spotlight. Her first appearance, to perform her song “Rainbow,” betrayed some nerves. As part of the Dolly Parton tribute, Musgraves’s hair had gotten bigger but she was still muscled over by a vocally pushy Katy Perry on “Here You Come Again.” By the time she took center stage to accept the show’s final award, though, having won best country album and then beaten out pop stars like Drake, Cardi B and Kendrick Lamar for the top all-genre prize, the Grammys had come to her, and Musgraves delivered a simple, effective moment of gratitude that showed just how easy she is to root for. In a room used to having the air sucked out of it by all sorts of try-hards and egomaniacs, Musgraves just let it breathe. COSCARELLI H.E.R., the shades-wearing singer, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist who won the Grammy for best R&B album, summoned echoes of Prince and “Purple Rain” with reverberating chords from her electric guitar as she sang “Hard Place.” Singers and a string section gathered onstage as the song moved into a gospel-charged crescendo and H.E.R. let loose more expansive, ever more soulful melismas. She wasn’t done until she had flaunted some wailing lead guitar and then eased the song back down, with poised dynamics at every moment — the kind of real-time musicianship the Grammys still hope to reward. PARELES Let’s say up front that Jennifer Lopez is a genuinely versatile talent — a spectacular dancer, an underrated actress, a person who sings. There are numerous ways she could have enlivened any number of parts of the Grammys this year, or any other year. Fronting a Motown tribute, however — yeah, how about no? Lopez did not appear to be singing live at any point during her six-minute-plus performance, to the chagrin of many online, and perhaps also to any of the dozens of R&B singers who could have handled these songs with verve and power. While the dance routines were strong, turning the music of Motown — which featured some of the most vital, urgent vocals in pop music history — into a Busby Berkeley routine was a swing and a miss. CARAMANICA It is nigh impossible to pay full tribute to Aretha Franklin, who had one of the most forceful, nuanced and outrageous voices of the last century. So Yolanda Adams, Andra Day and Fantasia didn’t go over the top on their version of “(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman.” The performance was taut — just three sharp vocalists delivering impassioned singing, paying homage to an icon while silently accepting there are shoes that can never fully be filled. CARAMANICA Miley Cyrus has never won a Grammy. She was not up for one this year. She’s only been nominated once ever. And yet! Cyrus came to play on Sunday, joining Shawn Mendes to make an unnecessary (sleeveless) duet a true power ballad, and then appearing again for a tribute to her godmother, Dolly Parton. Cyrus was loose, but focused; impactful, but not scenery-chewing, and, knowing her nonstop-ness, she probably wanted more. She could’ve torn up that cage with Travis Scott! She could’ve kept “Shallow” earthbound! She could’ve hosted! Bless her. COSCARELLI Some Grammy performances have little to do with music in itself. The recording business owes a lot to Diana Ross, who had dozens of No. 1 hits, turns 75 in March and is still touring this year. What she never got, with the Supremes or solo, was a competitive Grammy award; the Recording Academy came up with a Lifetime Achievement award in 2012. So when she arrived onstage in a regal, gauzy red gown, after being introduced by her grandson, her presence was enough. She got through the retrospective gratitude of “The Best Years of My Life” (despite an ill-advised upward key change) and an arm-waving singalong of “Reach Out and Touch (Somebody’s Hand),” as she strolled through the audience. “Learn, dream, unlock new doors,” she exhorted. “All is possible.” The standing ovation was a cumulative appreciation. PARELES Between a 2014 Super Bowl appearance with Bruno Mars and this Grammy Awards duet with Post Malone, Red Hot Chili Peppers have made themselves symbolic elder statesmen of excess. Excess was the thematic link for a three-part Grammy medley: Post Malone’s acoustic-guitar-strumming ballad “Stay” (recalling a lovers’ quarrel while he was “too drunk to talk”) followed by his singsong, self-censored boasts of overindulgence in “Rockstar” and then the Chili Peppers’ 2016 song “Dark Necessities,” which hints at addiction and self-destructive impulses. Post Malone’s self-satisfied self-pity coupled with the Chili Peppers’ we-can-still-do-this athleticism — the singer Anthony Kiedis ended up shirtless — all played like unintentional parody. Post Malone also made no mention of his collaborator on “Rockstar”: 21 Savage, currently detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. PARELES Janelle Monáe has extensive ideas about cybernetic control vs. sensual abandon; she also has old-school showbiz razzle-dazzle. She combined them all to perform “Make Me Feel,” a song that harks back to the Minneapolis funk of Prince and prime Janet Jackson. Flanked by dancers who were costumed as shiny automatons, she swaggered through the song with robotic twitches, hip-pumping carnality and even some moonwalking, adding a snippet of her gynocentric song “Pynk” and the admonition, “Let the vagina have a monologue!” She earned the mic drop that ended the song. PARELES The Grammys, structurally, still look like they could be filmed in the 1970s. The camera setups are fairly flat, and the performances are tightly controlled. So credit Travis Scott for taking a much-needed wrecking ball to the format. He began his performance with a coolly tempered “Stop Trying to Be God,” backed by James Blake duetting with Philip Bailey (of Earth, Wind and Fire). But then the scene switched: Scott reappeared inside a tall cage rapping “No Bystanders,” and was swarmed by dozens of ecstatic revelers, some of whom began scaling the cage walls. Eventually Scott climbed up, hopped over the top and landed on the outstretched arms of his faithful. For a show that likes to pretend music moves in one direction — from the stage outward — this was a welcome reminder that it can also go up, down, around, and explode in plain sight. CARAMANICA "
5c2e4da63a125f5075c02b59,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/03/arts/music/sharon-van-etten-remind-me-tomorrow-interview.html,"On a late November morning, the laid-back version of Sharon Van Etten serving coffee from a thermos at a quiet kitchen table was both a miracle and an illusion. Toys piled in a corner and a rocking chair from her own childhood revealed the momentary absence of a toddler, but little else betrayed the mix of chaos and ambition swirling just below the surface of Van Etten’s picturesque Brooklyn life. In a few hours, she would fly to Los Angeles to film a quick scene for the second season of “The OA,” the Netflix show that became her first professional acting job in 2016. On the way, she would use the quiet hours away from her young son to study for the final exams that loomed as she continued to pursue an undergraduate degree in psychology. There was also a new script that needed reading and an experimental film score in the works, but those were just the side gigs. At the same time, Van Etten, 37, was in the midst of returning to her day job as a singer-songwriter, plotting a music video shoot, getting ready for a tour set to begin in February and awaiting the imminent delivery of the finished vinyl for her fifth studio LP, out Jan. 18 via Jagjaguwar. Though typically understated, the album’s title, “Remind Me Tomorrow,” nods at Van Etten’s current juggling act — a tongue-in-cheek mantra for a multitasking mother who also happens to run the small business that is an independent band. [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] “Crazy, crazy, crazy,” Van Etten said, taking in the scope of her hectic but life-affirming last three years, which, ironically enough, began when she tried to press pause on her music career. “I can’t even believe we’ve done what we’ve done.” It’s Van Etten’s now-frequent use of we and our in conversation that best mark her transition from a solitary, searching singer, known for her languid, almost gothic breakup songs, to something fuller and less fragile — someone to be counted on, someone in charge of things. Together with her romantic partner, Zeke Hutchins, who was once her drummer and now works as her manager, Van Etten has undertaken what the couple characterizes as various adventures — acting, school, scoring, parenthood — each of which adds to her ongoing project: becoming a more well-rounded, more empathetic artist. “So much of creative work today is all about like, the solitary genius and sudden rise,” said Zal Batmanglij, who directed Van Etten in “The OA,” the Netflix sci-fi series. “But it’s the people who actually do the work, day in and day out, that are special. They’re after something deeper, their work gets better — things that aren’t necessarily super-fashionable right now. They last the test of time. That’s everyone’s reaction to Sharon.” “Remind Me Tomorrow” represents the singer’s journal on the path to getting whole. Nearly a decade on from her spare 2009 debut, “Because I Was in Love” — powerfully sad funeral dirges for the ghosts of toxic relationships — the new album embraces optimism, even when it sounds like end times. Written initially as love songs to Hutchins, the tracks only intensified as Van Etten finished the lyrics after giving birth, often working with headphones while staring at her napping son, who turns 2 in the spring. “It’s about my love and my fear and about me wanting to be better, but doubting myself a little bit,” said Van Etten, who has an easy, disarming manner that quickly brings people close. “It’s my job to be strong and positive so that he feels safe and protected, even given the state of the world.” (Van Etten, who was pregnant during the election of President Trump, recalled “trying not to cry because I didn’t want the baby to absorb my emotions.”) As she has expanded her artistic endeavors and emotional registers, Van Etten also found a fresh musical palette. While her early, softly strummed guitar songs were often gorgeous despite their brokenness, “Remind Me Tomorrow,” an album of hope, intimacy and perseverance, has jagged edges and a brooding swagger, built around droning synths and a propulsive rhythm section of studio musicians. “I just wanted to do something different,” she said. “And the band setup bored me so much: ‘This is where the bass comes in, this is where the drums kick in …’” She continued: “I love the slow build — that’s what I do. But I found that I was more drawn to the darkness and the driven synths and the syncopated beats.” Much of Van Etten’s recent evolution can be traced back to Nick Cave. She cited the Australian rock singer’s drone-heavy “Skeleton Tree,” from 2016, along with avant-garde and electronic acts like Suicide and Portishead, while seeking her new sound. But Cave had a less direct impact, as well: It was on tour opening for him in 2013 that she and Hutchins became something more than collaborators. “When we realized we fell in love, we were like, O.K., we have to go home and figure out our lives and then make this record and we’ll come back to this and see how we feel,” she said, referring to “Are We There,” her previous release, from 2014. “It was the most adult thing. And the most torturous thing we could’ve done to ourselves.” On that same tour with Cave, Van Etten was noticed by a casting director who would later swoop in to disrupt her life further. Following many months on the road in support of “Are We There,” Van Etten began feeling detached from her music and exhausted by the constant grind of performing heartbreak professionally. But inspired by her immediately intimate rapport with often-wounded fans after shows, she decided to take a moment away from music to finish her bachelor’s degree with the hope of becoming a licensed mental health counselor. As she and Hutchins settled into their new relationship, Van Etten enrolled at Brooklyn College, alive with the possibility of a new life chapter. Two weeks into her first semester, she got a call asking her to audition for “The OA.” “I almost didn’t take it,” Van Etten recalled. “I was doing this big dramatic pause with my band to go back to school and now I’m going to act? I’m such a phony!” She’d been in “West Side Story” in high school in New Jersey, where she grew up the middle child of five. But distant dreams of Broadway aside, Hollywood was never a goal. To Hutchins, however, the show sounded like an adventure. In the script, the role of Rachel, one of four damaged captives kept in glass cages by a mysterious scientist, called for “the voice of an angel.” Brit Marling, who stars in “The OA” and created the show with Batmanglij, recalled being floored by a video of Van Etten’s audition, in which she delivered a dramatic monologue and then sang a cappella, opting for “I Wish I Knew,” the opening song from her first album. “When you watched her do the monologue what you felt is that she was not acting — and that’s the highest compliment you can pay an actor,” Marling said. “She’s an incredible artist and thinker and feels everything viscerally. It comes out in her music and in how she acts. There’s just no phoniness. It’s all real.” Batmanglij added of Van Etten: “She could tap into something — these deep reservoirs of empathy. She can make herself vulnerable.” She took the role, agreeing to defer her college enrollment. But the detours just kept coming. In addition to eventually getting pregnant and performing on an episode of David Lynch’s “Twin Peaks” revival, Van Etten signed on to compose the score for the filmmaker Katherine Dieckmann’s “Strange Weather,” working out of a practice space that she shared with the actor and musician Michael Cera. It was there, Van Etten was comforted to discover, that she could not help but write songs. “It’s still an outlet for me,” she said. “It’s my therapy.” Van Etten found herself gravitating to Cera’s Roland Jupiter 4 synthesizer, and writing more on keys when not working on the film. By 2017, she had a folder of more than 40 demos, including what she described as a whole country album and another of only piano ballads. But the batch that became “Remind Me Tomorrow” was the most experimental, with sonic references that were “the sort of things you don’t think of when you think of Sharon Van Etten,” said the producer John Congleton, who would go on to oversee the recording sessions in Los Angeles. “She seemed particularly excited that I was going for it,” said Congleton, who likened the new songs to abstract tone poems. “I wasn’t trying to make it Americana, or normalize it,” he added. “I wasn’t trying to wrangle her — I was embracing the wildness.” That allowed a churning track like “Jupiter 4” — with plain-spoken romantic lyrics like “I’ve been waiting, waiting, waiting/my whole life for someone like you” — to come with a musical layer of dread, the kind that encapsulates how terrifying it is to fall in love and put down roots. (Van Etten’s composition was also recorded as “Jupiter,” an ’80s-ish pop jam, by the singer Donna Missal.) Other love songs on the album, like “Comeback Kid” and “Seventeen,” feel aimed at Van Etten’s younger self. While much of her songwriting output has been viewed through the lens of her earliest public origin story — an abusive relationship with a man who tried to stamp out her creative impulses — Van Etten’s new work is less about picking at tender scabs than the faded scars that served as a road map to now. “I think reflection is important,” she said, “but taking those experiences and moving forward is how I’ve gotten to be here.” She added: “It’s because of everything I’ve gone through that I’m a stronger person and was open and ready enough to accept the right kind of love into my life.” On the almost-Springsteen-esque “Seventeen,” she sings: Down beneath the ashes and stone,Sure of what I’ve lived and have known.I see you so uncomfortably alone. Wish I could show you how much you’ve grown. A few days after our first meeting, Van Etten was facing that nostalgia head-on as she scouted locations from her past for the track’s upcoming music video shoot. There were long-closed clubs on the Lower East Side, where she played some of her first shows, along with her early New York apartments sourced on Craigslist and too close to the rattling subway. Van Etten laughed about seeing her “hazy past in daylight,” but the stroll through memories was also something of a goodbye, as she and Hutchins had agreed that a move to Los Angeles in the new year was probably best for raising a child. “I’ve worked so hard to live here and now I can’t afford it,” she said. “The New York story.” But it wasn’t a tragedy. Van Etten said she was open to more acting following her forthcoming appearance in the second season of “The OA,” and has been working on writing comedy, including a personal project about a mother’s relationship with her babysitters. She even recently tried stand-up. And though she would most likely not have time to return to school until 2020, Van Etten added that she’s sticking to her plan to become a therapist by the age of 50. “By then,” she said, “I’ll want to settle down.” "
5c370e743a125f5075c03b04,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/10/arts/music/baby-shark-billboard.html,"We preemptively apologize for getting it stuck in your head. But “Baby Shark,” a song as infectious as anthrax to which the caretakers of young children likely need no introduction, entered the Billboard Hot 100 chart at No. 32 this week, placing Pinkfong, a South Korean educational brand, alongside the world’s top musical artists. For the uninitiated, click if you dare. “Baby Shark,” which Pinkfong says it based on a “traditional singalong chant,” has been viewed more than 2.1 billion times on YouTube, making it among the 30 most-viewed videos ever. It was streamed 20.8 million times just in the past week, Billboard said, with 73 percent of those streams coming from video. Its rise onto the charts comes long after SmartStudy, a Seoul-based company that has produced thousands of children’s videos under the Pinkfong brand, first posted it on YouTube in November 2015. The company remixed it, adding a new beat and melody, in the now-popular version posted in June 2016. It has now been adapted into more than 100 versions in 11 languages, the company said. The song was helped along by attention from K-pop acts in Korea and spread throughout Southeast Asia before eventually finding its way to the United States in 2018, when a social media challenge invited people to post videos of themselves dancing to the song. Participants included Ellen DeGeneres and James Corden, while Kylie Jenner and Cardi B made references. It first appeared on Billboard’s Kid Digital Song Sales chart in July, followed by the Streaming Songs chart in November. It also made it to the U.K. Top 40, which is not produced by Billboard, in September. Making a Top 40 list is far from easy. Jimi Hendrix made it to Billboard’s just once. Wu-Tang Clan never made it. But today’s charts are different, and often include an eclectic mix of music. Billboard has made a series of changes to its rankings for an era in which viral hits on social media can capture more attention than sustained radio airplay, and consumers download more music than they buy in record shops. In 2012, Billboard began counting digital sales and online streams in its singles chart, immediately lifting “Gangnam Style,” the YouTube hit by the South Korean rapper Psy, to the top of the new Rap Songs chart. In 2014, Billboard and Nielsen SoundScan, the agency that supplies Billboard’s data, added streams and downloads to its album chart formula. Billboard and Nielsen tweaked the formula in July, making streams from paid services like Spotify and Apple Music worth about three times as much as those from “free” users, including YouTube viewers. Bin Jeong, the chief executive of Pinkfong USA, said in an emailed statement that the digital content company is responding to the success of “Baby Shark” by creating toys, DVDs and other consumer products, including books and diapers. The company, which has about 200 employees in offices in South Korea, the United States and China, is also working on TV shorts and a movie, he said. “We are not planning to settle for Baby Shark hitting the music charts and getting YouTube views, but we are developing Pinkfong and Baby Shark into an entertainment brand that will be enjoyed by generations to come,” she said.

5c3d9ee23a125f5075c04708,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/15/arts/music/yannick-nezet-seguin-met-opera-gay.html,"It wasn’t love at first sight when Yannick Nézet-Séguin, the new music director of the Metropolitan Opera, and his partner, Pierre Tourville, met as students at the Montreal Conservatory almost 25 years ago. “I felt I needed to emancipate, to get out of my parents’ place, as one does at 20,” Mr. Nézet-Séguin said recently at Julius’, the West Village gay bar. “And so we were just roommates.” “You and your best friend,” he said, turning to Mr. Tourville, “she and you were looking, and I said, ‘I’m going to be your roommate.’” Mr. Tourville, a violist, was dating, he admitted with a laugh, “many people at the same time.” Mr. Nézet-Séguin was in a four-year relationship — with a woman. But did Mr. Tourville seriously think Mr. Nézet-Séguin was straight? “Not for very long,” Mr. Tourville deadpanned. “It became pretty clear. Quickly.” It’s not unusual to share meet-cute stories over cheap cocktails at Julius’, one of the oldest and coziest gay bars in the city. But it was an extraordinary conversation to be having with the music director of the nation’s largest performing arts institution. While culture — particularly high culture — is indelibly associated with gay tastemakers, audiences and creators, it’s a sign of how outmoded our conception of authority is that remarkably few major performing arts leaders have been openly gay. In classical music and opera, even New York, the city that gave rise to the modern gay rights movement with the Stonewall riots 50 years ago this June, has been dominated since then by two conductors: Leonard Bernstein and James Levine, who both kept sexual relationships with men hidden. So chatting casually about coming out, bullying and Celine Dion with Mr. Nézet-Séguin and Mr. Tourville was a sign that a new generation is coming to power, one for which sexual orientation is far less fraught. And it adds to the sense that Mr. Nézet-Séguin, 43, who is conducting Debussy’s “Pelléas et Mélisande” at the Met through Jan. 31, represents a milestone, and not just for opera. Despite gay pioneers like Michael Tilson Thomas (at the San Francisco Symphony) and Marin Alsop (in Baltimore), conducting remains an overwhelmingly straight (and male, and white) profession. As throughout society — business, politics, sports — music has struggled to produce and promote leaders outside of the traditional mold. It doesn’t help that the field is by its nature past-loving and has major centers in countries like Italy and Russia, where reactionary values still reign. “Orchestras and opera companies are microcosms of our society and our world, and this is a representation of it,” said Deborah Borda, the president and chief executive of the New York Philharmonic, and the partner of Coralie Toevs, the Met’s development chief. “If you think about Western society, the epitome of leadership — and people go around teaching courses on this — is a conductor. And the model is Toscanini: a man who stands on the podium, has total authority and simply tells people what to do. He is grand, and white, and fully patriarchal.” Mr. Levine, Mr. Nézet-Séguin’s predecessor at the Met, was fired last year after a company investigation found evidence of sexual misconduct. He has denied the accusations, but no one disputes that he has always been fiercely guarded about his personal life. The contrast with Mr. Nézet-Séguin — who has been openly gay for his entire professional career and nonchalant enough about it to post a smiling partners’ beach selfie on Instagram — is impossible to miss. “The fact that he’s so comfortable with who he is is part of what makes him a powerful, effective artistic leader,” Peter Gelb, the Met’s general manager, said in an interview. “Because he is proud of who he is, and that’s very important.” While he hasn’t wanted to make what he called “a big fuss” about his relationship, Mr. Nézet-Séguin sees himself and Mr. Tourville as symbolic of a widening conception of what a conductor can be. “It’s becoming more important for me,” he said, “to just realize that both of us, we can be examples, in a way, to inspire young musicians who fear that this is going to be a problem in their profession and career advancement. And I want to embrace that role more and more.” “Just by being, and by living our life,” he added, “this is hopefully something that breaks the preconceived ideas.” The two men both grew up in Quebec, Mr. Nézet-Séguin in Montreal and Mr. Tourville in Trois-Rivières. Even if it was perhaps unusual to declare, at 10, that he wanted to be a conductor, Mr. Nézet-Séguin said he was spared teasing. But Mr. Tourville was bullied so badly that he changed high schools in his second year. Sexual orientation, Mr. Tourville said, isn’t “clear at that age, but they feel you’re different. It was more about: I played music, I was good at school. I was different, more sensitive.” Mr. Nézet-Séguin recalled the transition from long-term heterosexual relationship to openly dating his male roommate in the mid-1990s as reasonably smooth. “There was no crisis with it,” he said, waiting a beat: “I mean, there was some surprise.” When they announced to both pairs of parents that they were a couple, the news was well received, though Mr. Nézet-Séguin allowed that “I can’t say it was necessarily only easy.” Mr. Tourville interjected that perhaps it wasn’t “the happiest moment of their life.” But, Mr. Nézet-Séguin added, “in both cases it didn’t affect the connection.” (His mother still handles his website and his schedule in Canada; his father manages the finances.) In those early years, Mr. Tourville was the breadwinner, with checks coming in as a freelance violist, while Mr. Nézet-Séguin toiled as a piano accompanist. They fondly recalled a $20 all-you-can-eat pasta deal on Tuesday nights at a local restaurant. “We had these dinners where we said: Oh, one day we’re going to go to Vienna, one day we’re going to go to Paris,” Mr. Nézet-Séguin said. “That was part of the dream.” They started a Baroque music ensemble, corralling players and pasting together scores in all-night marathons. Mr. Nézet-Séguin began to build his conducting career in Canada. In 2000, he became music director of the Orchestre Métropolitain in Montreal — and, in 2003, Mr. Tourville’s boss there. (Yes, it’s a bit awkward and stressful for your partner to try out for a viola seat in the orchestra you conduct, even if the audition is blind. “Of course, as soon as he did one note I recognized it,” Mr. Nézet-Séguin said.) Both of them still have their positions with the orchestra, and the arrangement has proved an ideal one: The ensemble is part-time, allowing Mr. Tourville to travel with Mr. Nézet-Séguin. “It’s kind of a package deal, I guess,” Mr. Tourville said. “When Yannick is there, most of the time I’m there, too.” They have been pleasantly surprised at having Mr. Tourville mentioned in the public ceremonies that introduced Mr. Nézet-Séguin as music director of the Rotterdam Philharmonic (a position he held through last year) and the Philadelphia Orchestra (where his contract has been extended until 2026). Mr. Tourville was an important factor in Mr. Nézet-Séguin’s decision to concentrate on Philadelphia, New York and Montreal, and to curtail his work in Europe for the time being. “There’s a lot of difference between, door to door, three and a half hours and no jet lag, compared to, like, 10 hours and you arrive and can’t do anything for three days,” Mr. Tourville said. “It was becoming a little crazy.” With much of their furniture from Rotterdam — including a Zaha Hadid “moon” sofa — en route to their rental apartment near Lincoln Center, things will be a lot less crazy in the coming years. “I think we’re more and more jealous of our very private time,” Mr. Tourville said. “And we like to have just cozy nights at home with a good meal, a cooked meal, and watching HGTV. That’s the ideal night.” Mr. Tourville referred with a laugh to the trope of “conductor wives,” who imperiously attend even rehearsals. He sticks to performances. “I think I know him well enough,” he said of Mr. Nézet-Séguin, “to know when he’s trying something or being unnatural, musically.” And is Mr. Tourville right when he intervenes? Mr. Nézet-Séguin smiled: “Always.” So Mr. Tourville will be an important adviser as Mr. Nézet-Séguin turns the page on the Levine era, not just symbolically but also musically. “The basic presence of the orchestral sound is not exactly what I imagine it can be,” Mr. Nézet-Séguin said, in his most detailed public comments yet about his intentions for the Met’s orchestra. “I think it’s a little too dry and lifeless in piano, and I think that in forte it’s just maybe unbalanced internally.” For the company’s recent new production of “La Traviata,” he said, he worked with the ensemble on “a much richer sound, resonant, pizzicato, bass-oriented. Cellos and basses: I’m a lot about what they need to do. Not because they’re not good, but because for years they’ve been asked to be as short and light as possible.” “That was the conception of sound of my predecessor,” he added. “I just have a totally different idea, and we miss very often the fundamental of the harmony. Whenever it’s a little bit longer and richer and with more vibrato, it changes completely the aural spectrum.” A wholly different kind of aural spectrum — and a spectacle that was queer even by opera standards — was on display in October, when Mr. Nézet-Séguin was featured on the Canadian national television show “En Direct de l’Univers,” a kind of “This Is Your Life” told through the people and music you love. His nieces and nephews were on, as were his parents and trainer. Rufus Wainwright sang a few songs. But the climax was a duet: the Jacques Brel number “Quand On N’a Que L’Amour” (“When Love Is All You Have”), with Mr. Tourville joined remotely by none other than Celine Dion. Mr. Nézet-Séguin cried — mostly, he said, “because I was watching Pierre sing a duet with his idol.” The couple is not married, but for a gay union, there could hardly have been a more sacred ceremony. “It made an impact,” Mr. Nézet-Séguin said. “We did not realize that, and yet it made an impact. Hey, two guys sang their love, with Celine blessing it.” "
5c33a3ac3a125f5075c03368,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/07/arts/music/prototype-festival-448-psychosis-prism-thistree.html,"Opera is an art form of affliction. It’s a genre that has long made a specialty of giving trauma stature and structure. But even by that standard, the marquee productions of this year’s Prototype, the festival of new music-theater that sprawls throughout the city and runs through Sunday, are extreme. There are scenes in “Prism,” “ThisTree” and especially “4.48 Psychosis” of almost cataclysmic suffering, the kind of pain that lingers without reason or resolution. “4.48” is an adaptation of the final work by Sarah Kane, the British playwright who died in 1999. A fragmented, incantatory immersion in clinical depression, filled with descriptions of psychotropic drugs, sets of numbers, angry rants and stark wordplay, the script specifies neither characters nor precise plot, nor even the number of performers. Seen on the page, the words scattered amid expanses of white, it can seem more like modernist poetry than theater. It is, in other words, as easily made into a score as into anything. In his opera, which had its premiere with the Royal Opera in London in 2016, the composer Philip Venables has found in Kane’s material a landscape of iciness and sensitivity, in which speaking and singing flow into one another with uncanny ease. Six women — one a loosely defined protagonist, the others her echoes and tormentors — chant and babble in shifting configurations, sometimes glassy and sometimes full-cry. Faint drones of organ (produced by synthesizer) rise to Grand Guignol surges, helped along by accordion. Heavily amplified, almost cartoonish stomping, heavy on low brass, gives way to coolly rending lyricism, like a Baroque lament by John Dowland, thinly frosted by violins playing in their highest register. The score, played here by the ensemble Contemporaneous under William Cole’s direction, ingeniously translates some fraught conversations between a doctor and patient into a percussion duet. Syllables are rhythmically tapped out as the words appear, projected on the set, while waiting-room Muzak plays — softly, infuriatingly — in the background. A hammer harshly clinking against a pipe, with a bell providing the question mark, is answered by despairing deep thwacks of fists on a drum: Mr. Venables gives us wit, hostility and poignancy, all at once. Ted Huffman’s clean yet passionate, intimate production adds, intentionally or not, a newly bitter element. The main performer, Gweneth-Ann Rand, is black, and the other five women are white, giving their relentless persecution of her yet another facet of horror. All in all, this “4.48” avoids neither the text’s moments of pitch-black humor nor its passages of luminous air; it doesn’t prettify Kane, nor does it make her brutality unendurable. Elegantly ferocious, it is this unclassifiable play as music. “Prism” (the creators make the title lowercase and place spaces between its letters) is also an attempt to depict the brutality of interior life. Its first act poses an intriguing mystery: What is this strange scene? A mother and her daughter, dressed in white, are locked in an immaculately clean room — outside of which some strange force, referred to as Blue, threatens. The daughter seems to have a progressive wasting illness that has left her with barely any use of her legs. Together they repeat lines of seeming nonsense — Roxie Perkins’s libretto is full of the ominously capitalized words of dystopian fiction — and follow eerily precise rules as they try to cure the daughter’s illness. Ellen Reid’s score is accessible in the best way, disconcertingly sweet without being syrupy, with occasional whispers of choral voices so soft they’re almost more odor than sound. The truly prismatic Choir of Trinity Wall Street is astonishing here; Trinity’s new-music ensemble, Novus NY, plays beautifully under Julian Wachner. It’s a haunting beginning, but the next acts answer its questions too literally. Jumping back in time, we learn that the daughter, Bibi (Anna Schubert), was raped after being left alone at a dance club by her mother, Lumee (Rebecca Jo Loeb), the aftermath of which is rendered as painful pricks of sound and the barest noise of voices breathing. In a violent reaction of remorse and PTSD, they retreat together into a messy rat hole — the reality of the pristine idyll we saw at the start — in a grimly ineffectual attempt at healing. The question: Can Bibi escape the regressive world her mother has invented to protect her? James Darrah’s staging is striking, with the locked room a frightening terrarium and the club a sea of low-hanging disco balls. But visual elegance can’t take away from the fact that that thumping club scene and the rushed-feeling finale come off as letdowns after Ms. Reid and Ms. Perkins’s spookily suggestive opening. Leah Coloff’s “ThisTree” is mellower than “Prism” and “4.48 Psychosis,” but still unstinting. A cellist, composer and vocalist, Ms. Coloff leads a six-woman band in what is, at heart, a cabaret show: a series of memoir monologues alternating with folky, bluesy numbers sung in her sometimes feathery, sometimes husky, sometimes warbly voice. She intertwines her family’s pioneer past and the parentage secrets it kept with an account of her struggles with infertility. This is forbidding stuff, but Ms. Coloff’s touch is light, her presence warm. She’s not sentimental — and idiosyncratic touches, like a giant red bonnet, an enormous hand-stitched denim cape and tough-to-pin-down lyrics, keep things helpfully weird — but she isn’t unemotional. She is, simply, honest. These aren’t the only productions in this year’s Prototype, presented by Beth Morrison Projects and the arts center HERE. “Pancho Villa From a Safe Distance,” composed by Graham Reynolds and with a libretto by the collective Lagartijas Tiradas al Sol, is a cozy, bilingual, semistaged oratorio for two singers (including the soaringly sweet tenor Paul Sanchez) and a rollicking roadhouse band. Reflections on the famous revolutionary’s life and death — and, pointedly, on the gringos who watched the war in which he took part from the safe distance of the title — are interspersed with quietly riveting footage of interviews with a Mexican teenager who claims to have heard voices urging him to immerse himself in Villa’s story. Written and directed by Michael Joseph McQuilken, “The Infinite Hotel,” a shotgun marriage of “A Star Is Born” and a ghost story, is an ambitiously busy show that fills the Irondale Center in Brooklyn with cameras and screens. (You may think of Ivo van Hove’s signature style of self-reflexive multimedia explosion.) Some of the audience watches from above, with the sound mix coming through headphones. Some participate as extras — directed in real time — in the filming of the production, which results in a unique feature-length creation from each performance. Often sounding uncannily like Lady Gaga, Leah Siegel sings with earthy rock authority as a subway singer-songwriter turned arena sensation. But all the technical bells and whistles, while smoothly produced, ultimately feel less like integral elements than a distraction from stock characters and a thin, overlong plot. “The Infinite Hotel” ends with the mawkish spectacle of a dead father holding his daughter. “4.48 Psychosis” closes with apocalypse — and inevitably, for all of us who see it now, with thoughts of Kane’s actual suicide. “ThisTree” concludes with moving modesty: the simple recognition that this is how things are. And does Bibi escape at the end of “Prism”? In a culture so single-mindedly focused on personal empowerment and victory over victimization, how could she not? But this rings false. Opera doesn’t need its heroines merely to suffer. But it needs their victories to feel genuine rather than tacked on. "
5c5876873a125f5075c07f0f,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/04/arts/music/backstreet-boys-dna-billboard-chart.html,"The last time the Backstreet Boys had a No. 1 album, in fall 2000, CD sales were at their commercial peak and iTunes did not exist; even “American Idol” was still two years away. Since then, of course, the music business has been transformed. CDs are now a mere niche, and positions on Billboard’s weekly album chart are largely determined by billions of clicks on streaming services, each worth just a fraction of a penny. But this week, the Backstreet Boys — its five members now well into their 30s and 40s — benefited from the music industry’s last-ditch strategy to move CDs: concert-ticket sales bundles. Following in the footsteps of Ariana Grande, Travis Scott, Bon Jovi and the Dave Matthews Band, the Backstreet Boys offered fans copies of their latest album, “DNA” (K-BAHN/RCA), with tickets to their summer tour. That deal helped sell 227,000 copies of “DNA” in the United States last week, according to Nielsen. Back in 2000 that amount would have barely made a dent; the Backstreet Boys’ “Black & Blue” sold 1.6 million copies in its first week on sale that November. But in the chart’s new math, sales of complete albums now carry far greater weight than any single click. So even though “DNA” had just 6.6 million streams, the album sales put it far ahead of any other release this week, with 234,000 total “equivalent” album sales — a measurement that factors in complete album sales as well as streams and downloads of individual tracks. By comparison, the latest album by the rapper Future, “The Wizrd,” had a healthy 69 million streams in its second week out, yet only 3,000 sales as a full album, yielding an equivalent number of just 56,000. “The Wizrd,” last week’s chart-topper, fell to No. 2. Also this week, A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie’s “Hoodie SZN” holds at No. 3, Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper’s “A Star Is Born” soundtrack is No. 4, and Weezer’s latest untitled album — this one known as the “teal” album, with covers like Toto’s “Africa” and TLC’s “No Scrubs” — is No. 5.

5c35f05a3a125f5075c03867,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/09/arts/music/woodstock-50th-anniversary-festival.html,"WOODSTOCK, N.Y. — When the first Woodstock music festival was held in 1969, bringing around 400,000 people to a muddy field in Bethel, N.Y., it focused the world’s attention on pop music’s power to shape the culture. Half a century later, in a music market already jammed with big-ticket festivals, could another Woodstock muster the same impact? Michael Lang, one of the producers of the original event, is betting that it can. From Aug. 16 to 18 — almost exactly 50 years after the first Woodstock — he will present an official anniversary festival, Woodstock 50, in Watkins Glen, N.Y., with ambitions to not only attract a huge multigenerational audience but to rally those fans around a message of social activism. Mr. Lang, who at 74 still has some of the cherubic look seen in the 1970 documentary “Woodstock” — though his curls are threaded with gray — said in an interview at the festival office in Woodstock that he is still booking the acts for the new show; he is hoping for a mixture of legacy bands, current pop and rap stars and, possibly, some news-making combinations. But his vision for Woodstock’s 50th, he said, is clear: a large-scale camping weekend combining music with a program of films, speakers and partnerships with organizations like Head count, which registers young voters.  “Coachella’s got its thing, as does Bonnaroo and Lollapalooza,” Mr. Lang said. “But I think they’re all missing an opportunity to make a difference in the world. They’re all perfect places for social engagement and for fostering ideas, and I think that’s lost.” “We want this to be more than just coming to a concert,” he added. “And hopefully a lot of the bands will become part of this effort to get people to stand up and make themselves heard, to get and out vote. And if they don’t have a candidate that represents their feelings, to find one — or to run themselves.” Yet activism plays a significant part in a number of festivals. Environmental sustainability is central to Bonnaroo, for example, and this year Jay-Z’s Made in America Festival, in Philadelphia, has “Cause Village,” with some 56 charitable and activist organizations represented.  Woodstock 50 will be held in the fields surrounding the Watkins Glen International racetrack, where the Summer Jam in 1973 drew an estimated 600,000 people for the Grateful Dead, the Allman Brothers and the Band; more recently, it has been the site of two festivals by Phish.  For Woodstock, three main stages will be supplemented by three smaller “neighborhoods,” as Mr. Lang described them, with their own food and programming.  Tickets? Mr. Lang and his team are still working on that. But they envision selling a maximum of around 100,000 three-day passes, with most attendees camping on site. As with its other anniversary years, Woodstock’s 50th will be widely celebrated and exploited in the media, with books, albums and a PBS documentary among the projects planned. But unlike the last Woodstock anniversary concerts, in 1994 and 1999, which Mr. Lang presented along with partners, the event now faces severe competition from large-scale festivals around the country.  Coachella, Lollapalooza and Bonnaroo, the three biggest, are now highly developed brand names, with the drawing power to sell out well in advance; tickets for Coachella’s two weekends, for example, sold out in a matter of hours last week. There is even a competing Woodstock: the Bethel Woods Music and Culture Festival, over the same anniversary weekend — which will also feature “TED-style talks” — will be held on the same grounds as the original, around 60 miles from the town of Woodstock. (The Watkins Glen site is further afield, about 30 miles west of Ithaca.) For many concertgoers, another issue is whether the Woodstock name itself was damaged by the 1999 festival, which was marred by fires, rioting and reports of sexual assault.  “It’s not tainted,” Mr. Lang said. “’99 was more like an MTV event than a Woodstock event, really. I take some responsibility for that. It was also kind of an angry time in music.” And then there is the corporate consolidation of the concert business, which has grown especially intense over the last few years as two companies, Live Nation and AEG, compete to book major tours. Live Nation is a partner in the Bethel Woods event. “The industry has completely changed since 1999,” said John Scher, the veteran concert promoter who was a partner with Mr. Lang on Woodstock ’94 and ’99. “The entrepreneurial spirit of 1969 doesn’t exist anymore.” Mr. Lang declined to discuss the budget for Woodstock 50, but festivals of its size typically spend tens of millions on talent alone. “We paid $135,000 for all of our talent in 1969,” Mr. Lang said. “Times have changed.” The festival is being financed by the Dentsu Aegis Network, a unit of the Japanese advertising giant Dentsu; agencies within the Dentsu Aegis Network will be involved in marketing and selling sponsorships.  One advantage for Woodstock 50 is that it is “official.” Mr. Lang remains a partner in Woodstock Ventures, the company that controls the trademark rights, and licenses it for various products. The one Mr. Lang has been closest to is Woodstock Cannabis.  “Cannabis has always been in our DNA,” Mr. Lang said with a smile; his first commercial venture, in 1966, was a head shop in the Coconut Grove neighborhood of Miami. Of the other young men on the team that created Woodstock — Joel Rosenman, John Roberts and Artie Kornfeld — Rosenman is a partner in Woodstock Ventures, along with the family of Roberts, who died in 2001. Kornfeld will return as a consultant and “spiritual adviser,” Mr. Lang said.  Merchandise sales — particularly featuring the original Woodstock bird-and-guitar logo — provide one proxy for gauging the continuing appeal of the Woodstock brand. Dell Furano, the chief executive of Epic Rights, who has handled official Woodstock merchandise for 15 years, said that he is expecting over $100 million in retail sales of Woodstock licensed products in 2019 — four or five times that of non-anniversary years. “There’s every type of tie-dye. Children’s products. Dog products. Speakers, wine, cannabis,” Mr. Furano said in an interview. “The appeal is multigenerational.” In 1969, the mud, the tie-dye and the idealism were all catalysts in creating what the original festival had promised: three days of peace and music. Mr. Lang said that the divisiveness of the current political climate called for that once again. “It just seems like it’s a perfect time,” he said, “for a Woodstock kind of reminder.” "
5c9b2ddc49f0eacbf105f409,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/27/lens/tintype-portraits-musicians-appalachia.html,"Lisa Elmaleh traded her Brooklyn apartment in 2012 for a wood cabin with no running water — but a “quite lovely” outhouse — on the outskirts of Paw Paw, West Virginia. Urban anonymity was soon replaced by small-town intimacy as she pursued her project of photographing traditional string musicians in Appalachia using, appropriately enough, traditional photographic processes. She had decided to move there the very day she had done tintypes of Sam Herrmann and her husband, Joe, a couple dedicated to keeping old-time music alive. Paw Paw may not have Brooklyn’s hipster cachet, but it also “has everything that Brooklyn doesn’t” she added. “What I gained by moving here is this community of people who live more deliberately and close to the land,” Ms. Elmaleh explained. “In Brooklyn I barely knew any of my neighbors. Here there’s more of a sense of belonging and being there for your neighbor when they need help.” Neighbors let her build a darkroom in their house in exchange for helping with chores on the farm. When she was interviewed by phone recently, she had just finished moving dirt, spreading manure and helping with spring planting. There are no riches or social media fame to be gained by playing old-time Appalachian music, just the pleasure of gathering with friends and playing tunes with the knowledge that you are maintaining a centuries-old tradition. Ms. Elmaleh plays guitar and accompanies her friends and neighbors when they gather for an evening of music. “As a guitarist you’re kind of the backup, so my favorite part of playing tunes is watching and listening to the other musicians around me” she said. “It’s very intimate.” Ms. Elmaleh’s community of musicians now stretches well beyond her new hometown of fewer than 1,000 residents. It includes people, throughout the Appalachians, who she has photographed. She uses a difficult to master wet-plate tintype process developed in the mid-1850s. The nature of this technique connects her work to both the history of photography and the history of traditional Appalachian music, she said. “Each 8x10 tintype plate is hand coated, exposed in an antiquated large format camera, and developed on-site in a small darkroom in the back of my truck,” Ms. Elmaleh said. “The intimacy of the moment which the tintype creates, a multiple-second exposure, a moment of silence, shared between the musician and myself, is conveyed in each image.” The tintype process results in an image that is reversed. So a right handed musician would look like they were left handed. She has converted a 1996 Toyota Tacoma into a mobile darkroom that now has more than 300,000 miles on it (and often doubles as a bedroom while she is on the road). She usually spends a day or more with her subjects on their own land, she said, in order to portray “a deep connection to the musician and their surroundings.” Ms. Elmaleh, who was raised in Miami, survives by teaching 19th century photographic processes and the occasional freelance assignment. It is a lifestyle she describes as “feast or famine.” But most of the time she is at home in Paw Paw, trying to live a considered life, much like her old-time musician friends. “They are Americans who are carrying on a tradition that does not have a whole lot of vanity to it,” she said, “a music of a rural place, that speaks of a time when things were simpler.” Follow @nytimesphoto and @JamesEstrin on Twitter.

5ca7446c49f0eacbf1f8123a,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/05/arts/music/kurt-cobain-nirvana-death.html,"Twenty-five years ago, on April 5, 1994, Kurt Cobain died at the age of 27, a victim of suicide. He left behind the epochal rock music he made as the singer and guitarist for Nirvana, piles of journals and artwork, and a final note that didn’t clear up the contradictions of his short life. Which was probably how he wanted it: The previous year, he had painted on the wall of his rented Seattle home, in large red block letters, “None of You Will Ever Know My Intentions.” Many Nirvana biographies rehash the basics of Cobain’s story or peddle conspiracy theories that he was murdered, but there are also plenty of ways to go deeper. Here’s what to read, listen to, watch and explore: ‘Journals’ (Riverhead) With nearly 300 pages of photo replicas of Cobain’s personal journals and letters (and doodles, sketches and song lists), this 2002 book is funny, painful and shockingly intimate: a guided tour of the singer’s own churning psyche. “Its hard to decipher the difference between a sincere entertainer and an honest swindler,” Cobain wrote. Here’s what The New York Times’s Neil Strauss wrote when the book came out. ‘Come as You Are’ (Three Rivers) This deeply reported 1993 biography by Michael Azerrad, first published while Cobain was alive, was the original bible for Nirvana fans. Its strongest passages evoke the life of young Cobain in Aberdeen, Wash., a child of divorce who would sometimes spend the weekend killing time at a local logging company where his father worked: “He would get into his dad’s van and listen to Queen’s ‘News of the World’ over and over again on the eight-track. Sometimes he’d listen so long that he’d drain the battery and they’d have to find someone to jump-start the engine.” ‘Heavier Than Heaven’ (Hachette) Charles R. Cross, formerly the editor of the Seattle music paper The Rocket, covered the Nirvana story from early on — and conducted over 400 interviews for this thorough, definitive 2001 biography. Cobain’s widow, the musician Courtney Love, granted Cross extensive interviews and access to Cobain’s archives, including arcana such as a visual assignment he completed during his final stay in rehab: “For ‘surrender,’ he drew a man with a bright light emanating from him. For ‘depressed,’ he showed an umbrella surrounded by ties.” Read The New York Times review. ‘Takeoff: The Oral History of Nirvana’s Crossover Moment’ (Cuepoint) When Nirvana’s “Nevermind” hit No. 1 soon after its 1991 release, it shocked the band members and their grunge cohort, who had assumed that at best, the group would be underground heroes. Its multiplatinum success also opened the doors for many Nirvana-bes. This oral history by Nick Soulsby tells that story from the viewpoint of Nirvana’s college-rock peers, such as Gary Floyd of opening act Sister Double Happiness remembering Nirvana’s “road manager telling everyone backstage one night the CD had hit 1 million sales that day. They seemed almost embarrassed.” ‘The Dark Side of Kurt Cobain’ (The Advocate) Cobain loudly and frequently declared himself as an ally of gay people (and women, and people of color), so it was fitting that he gave one of his best interviews in this 1993 cover story with The Advocate, telling Kevin Allman, “I’ve always been a really sickly, feminine person anyhow, so I thought I was gay for a while because I didn’t find any of the girls in my high school attractive at all.” ‘Kurt Cobain, The Rolling Stone Interview: Success Doesn’t Suck’ (Rolling Stone) In Cobain’s last major interview, he informed David Fricke that he had wanted to call Nirvana’s “In Utero” album “I Hate Myself and I Want to Die,” “but I knew the majority of the people wouldn’t understand.” He insisted that the suicidal sentiment was only a joke: “I’m a much happier guy than a lot of people think I am.” ‘Never More’ (The Village Voice) After Cobain’s death, Ann Powers filed a raw dispatch from Seattle, reporting how the tragedy affected his friends and the neighbors who had never met him. “The kids I found who did mourn Cobain, hovering behind police lines at the house where he’d died or building shrines from candles and Raisin Bran boxes at the Sunday night vigil organized by three local radio stations, seemed to think of him more as a lost friend than as a candidate for that dreaded assignment, role model.” ‘Nirvana — The Moon, New Haven 1991’ On Sept. 26, 1991, just two days after the release of “Nevermind,” Nirvana played a great, sweaty show at a tiny club in New Haven — and miraculously, it was captured on this remarkably high-quality amateur video. The set featured just a few songs from the unfamiliar “Nevermind,” leaning heavily on the band’s 1989 debut, “Bleach.” Cobain, the bassist Krist Novoselic, and the drummer Dave Grohl all performed with joy and abandon, looking more at home in a filthy black room with a low ceiling than they ever did in arenas. ‘Live at Reading’ In the summer of 1992, when Nirvana played this storied U.K. festival, the band was divided by arguments over royalties and reports of Cobain’s heroin habit. Responding to the mood, Cobain came onstage in a wheelchair, wearing a hospital gown and a blond wig, and began the set with an out-of-tune cover of Bette Midler’s “The Rose.” At the end of the show, the group systematically destroyed its equipment. In between, almost as an afterthought, it delivered an hour and a half of full-blast rock. ‘Drain You’ When Jimmy McDonough, the author of the 2002 book “Shakey: Neil Young’s Biography,” wanted to show Young a live Nirvana performance after Cobain died, this 1993 clip from an MTV “Live and Loud” concert was the one he chose. “When you see the way he was,” an impressed Young said, “there’s no way he could ever get through the other end of it. Because there was no control to the burn. That’s why it was so intense. He was not holding back at all.” ‘Nirvana — Munich, Germany’ Nirvana’s last concert, on March 1, 1994, at a cavernous airport terminal that had been converted into a club, was an ordeal for a burned-out Cobain: He wanted to end the band, he wanted to divorce Love, he wanted to score drugs at the Munich train station. But the show (rendered here with just the first 10 minutes of video but a full 80 minutes of audio) was one final scream of pain, ending with “Heart-Shaped Box.” “Hey, wait, I got a new complaint,” Cobain sang, never meaning it more. ‘Kurt Cobain — Different Vocals’ This video collects live moments when Cobain dramatically altered his usual performances of familiar songs for various punk-rock reasons such as needing to shout over out-of-tune instruments (on “Come as You Are”) or just wanting to mess with a TV countdown show that was forcing him to mime playing his guitar (on “Smells Like Teen Spirit”). ‘MTV Unplugged in New York’ Playing acoustically for 44 minutes, Nirvana paid tribute to influences ranging from David Bowie to the Meat Puppets, and showed the delicate beauty behind its distorted guitars. And with the final song, a cover of Leadbelly’s “Where Did You Sleep Last Night,” Cobain gave one of his greatest vocal performances; it felt powerful enough to bring the curtain down on all of human existence. ‘Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck’ (Amazon) Cobain’s daughter, Frances Bean Cobain, served as executive producer on this authorized documentary feature directed by Brett Morgen. Mike Hale wrote in his Times review in 2015, “Mr. Morgen was given access to Cobain’s archives — ‘art, music, journals, Super 8 films and audio montages’ — and his exhilarating, exhausting, two-hour-plus film, both an artful mosaic and a hammering barrage, reflects years of rummaging through that trove.” ‘One of Kurt Cobain’s Final Interviews’ In this 26-minute WatchMojo interview from 1993, filmed with the Seattle waterfront as a backdrop, Cobain was bearded and scabby, smoking one cigarette after another. He was also relaxed and thoughtful, laughing at questions about his rock-star status that on a different day would have made him bristle. He explained, “Either I’ve accepted it or I’ve gone beyond insane.” ‘8 Fragments for Kurt Cobain’ The poet Jim Carroll, famous for the autobiographical book “The Basketball Diaries” and the autobiographical song “People Who Died,” wrote and performed this poem after Cobain’s death, trying to make sense of the senseless. It begins, “Genius is not a generous thing/In return it charges more interest than any amount of royalties can cover/And it resents fame/With bitter vengeance.” ‘About a Boy’ (Penguin) The death of Cobain haunts Nick Hornby’s second novel, shattering some of its characters and binding some of them together. The 12-year-old Marcus tries to make sense of the news he sees plastered all over the front pages of the evening papers: “He wondered if his mum was O.K., even though he knew there was no connection between his mum and Kurt Cobain because his mum was a real person and Kurt Cobain wasn’t; and then he felt confused, because the newspaper headline had turned Kurt Cobain into a real person somehow.” ‘Skip to the End’ (Insight) This evocative 2018 science-fiction graphic novel by the writer Jeremy Holt and the artist Alex Diotto tells the story of a grunge band called Samsara (clearly inspired by Nirvana) and a guitar that functions as a time-travel device. The metaphor works not only because of the urge Nirvana fans have to create an alternate timeline where Cobain survived, but because recorded music is itself a time-travel device, teleporting people both to the moment when it was made and the moment when it first touched a listener’s soul. ‘Last Days’ (Streaming Services) The filmmaker Gus Van Sant was a kindred spirit to Cobain: an independent artist from the Pacific Northwest who somehow wandered into the cultural mainstream. So it seemed natural in 2005 when he made a movie about (a thinly fictionalized version of) Cobain, played by Michael Pitt. In her Times review, Manohla Dargis called the movie a “mesmerizing dream” and said “Mr. Van Sant’s refusal to root around in Cobain’s consciousness, to try to explain why and how he created, suffered and died, is a radical gesture, both in aesthetic and in moral terms.” In 1991, Karen Schoemer was supposed to interview Cobain; he didn’t show up, so she wrote about “Nevermind” instead. Novoselic provided a few quotes: “We just want to play,” he said, “and put out what we consider good records.” A few months later, Simon Reynolds dissected some of the album’s songs: “‘Smells Like Teen Spirit’ could be this generation’s version of the Sex Pistols’ 1976 single, ‘Anarchy in the U.K.,’ if it weren’t for the bitter irony that pervades its title.” In 1992, Schoemer mused on Nirvana’s set on “Saturday Night Live,” a performance that she said “showed an astounding lack of musicianship” while later acknowledging that the band had released “quite simply, one of the best alternative rock albums produced by an American band in recent years.” Also in 1992, The Times was fooled by a former Sub Pop receptionist when a reporter called to talk about grunge culture. The resulting glossary of terms she provided — “harsh realm,” “lamestain” and “swingin’ on the flippity-flop” — did enter the pop-culture lexicon, but not the way The Times had planned. The receptionist, Megan Jasper, is now the label’s chief executive. A year later, Jon Pareles interviewed Nirvana on the cusp of releasing “In Utero,” as Cobain complained about “Nevermind” sounding too “clean.” “Ugh,” he said. “I’ll never do that again. It already paid off, so why try to duplicate that? And just trying to sell that many records again, there’s no point in it.” Pareles also reviewed Nirvana at the Roseland Ballroom, the band’s first New York show in two years. When Cobain died, Timothy Egan wrote our obituary and Pareles wrote an appraisal that discussed how “Nirvana was the band that brought punk-rock kicking and screaming into the mass market.” Neil Strauss later wrote about the songs written about Cobain: “Perhaps the most touching song about Cobain was written by a 10-year-old friend of his, Simon Fair Timony. Titled ‘I Love You Anyway,’ it is performed with the former Nirvana members Dave Grohl and Krist Novoselic joining Timony’s band, the Stinky Puffs.” In 2004, Thurston Moore wrote a first-person piece about his relationship with Cobain and Nirvana’s rise.

5c6700323a125f5075c09f61,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/15/arts/music/yuja-wang-igudesman-joo-carnegie-hall.html,"A crude joke by the Korean-British pianist Hyung-ki Joo set the tone for the evening: “I know I’m not Yuja Wang, but some girlfriends do call me Huge-a Wang.” Mr. Joo and his comedy partner, the Russian-German violinist Aleksey Igudesman, were performing with Ms. Wang, the superstar pianist, on Monday as part of her Perspectives series at Carnegie Hall. Igudesman & Joo, as they call their duo, are trained (and skilled) musicians who imbue classical music with laugh-out-loud humor. But their concert with Ms. Wang was riddled with jokes about her sexual appeal and Chinese heritage that ranged from unpleasant (“God, she’s so hot”) to offensive. (“It smells of sweet and sour chicken,” Mr. Igudesman said of a box with Ms. Wang inside.) In my review, I described some of the jokes and said they were a shame, especially considering that much of the evening was delightful: Ms. Wang was as impressive as ever, and Igudesman & Joo’s music-based comedy was virtuosic. But this performance has come at a fraught moment in culture, in which an increased desire to confront stereotypes is meeting an increased sensitivity about racial characterizations. The Museum of Modern Art is reconsidering the inclusivity of its collection; New York City Ballet has toned down Chinese caricature in “George Balanchine’s The Nutcracker”; the Metropolitan Opera removed blackface from “Otello.” Igudesman & Joo and Ms. Wang responded to interview requests with statements saying that the show’s jokes were intentional, and meant to satirize issues of race and sex in the music industry. “In our view, the best way to tackle tricky subjects is to undermine them by pointing them out with humor,” Igudesman & Joo said through a representative. “Our goal is not to offend but to show the offenses for what they are.” They added that “it was Yuja Wang herself who encouraged us and pushed for this approach.” Ms. Wang, in a separate statement, said, “The amount of vile, sexist, anonymous (or sometimes not, when it’s in print) comments publicly directed at me and so many others — especially aimed at women and minorities — is astonishing.” So, she added, “I have decided to take control of my own narrative, and have some fun while doing it.” To an audience member, this is all understandable, if difficult to accept given how lewd the concert became. The three artists tended to perform in a stereotypical manner without clearly or thoroughly mocking the stereotypes. I kept wondering how the spectacle was playing for the children in the audience, many of whom were Asian-American. The adults, at least, it seemed to polarize. On Twitter, one person posted: “What I saw last night was an audience being pandered to at a cruise ship level, and barely that.” In the comments on my review, someone said, “Some of the jokes were stupid, for sure, but not offensive.” Another wrote, of me, “Doesn’t he mean that HE became uncomfortable?” True — but I’ve heard jokes like these before, and they hurt. Half of my family is Hispanic, and positive representation of people like them is hard to come by in popular culture. Caricature is common; villainy, even more so. Clive Gillinson, Carnegie Hall’s executive and artistic director, was in the audience and said in a statement, “When Carnegie Hall partners with artists, we always seek to provide them with a platform on which they can express themselves, offering opportunities for them to present programs that reflect their own personal artistic viewpoints, and, in this case, also their sense of fun.” The prominent violinist Jennifer Koh wasn’t there, but she is a keen observer of issues of race in the classical field. In an interview, she said that, based on what she had heard about the Carnegie event, she was reminded of a concept addressed by the scholar Grace Wang. “Oftentimes, we’ll hear things like ‘German sounds’ and ‘French verbs’ and ‘Russian passion.’ Those are positive,” Ms. Koh said. “But ‘Chinese pianist’ — a lot of people have very negative connotations. And then there is this idea that Asians are robots. They have technique, but they don’t have soul.” Indeed, the title of Ms. Wang’s program with Igudesman & Joo was “The Clone,” taken from the duo’s 2017 YouTube sketch. But the show at Carnegie was less about satirizing this stereotype, and more about demonstrating it: The sketch’s conceit is a showcase of all the capabilities of a hypothetical Yuja Wang clone. (Or robot? It’s never really clear.) The clone-robot shows off her technical capabilities while Igudesman & Joo talk about her as if she were a high-tech sex toy. The concept, whatever its good intentions, tempts comparisons with the history of African-American performers in blackface, acting out stereotypes of themselves for predominantly white audiences. It also risks feeding the common perception of Asian-Americans as perpetual foreigners, Ms. Koh said, and as not having the musical depth of Caucasian Westerners — and therefore not having the full entitlement to interpret the Western canon. “These kinds of statements are not dissimilar to the Charlottesville marches — ‘blood and soil,’” she said, referring to the Nazi slogan appropriated by white nationalists at a 2017 rally in Virginia. “These are not unrelated issues.” Ms. Koh has tried in some small way to address problems with Asian-American representation in classical music. With the composer Jean-Baptiste Barrière, she is currently at work on “The 38th Parallel,” a multimedia piece in part about displacement, immigration and her family’s history as refugees of the Korean War. (It will have its premiere next year in California.) I attended a workshop performance at the New School in January; in its current form, the work is meditative yet direct, informative without being didactic. And it fits what Ms. Koh described as her dream of seeing Asian-Americans represented through “actual stories that are real and don’t have this foreign gaze.” This isn’t to say Ms. Wang has to use her Perspectives series for a program about moving to the United States from China. But she is a celebrity in classical music, and Igudesman & Joo have tens of millions of views on their YouTube channel. Think of what they could do — and what they haven’t done — with such a high profile. "
5c6492ba3a125f5075c09914,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/13/arts/music/ryan-adams-women-sex.html,"For nearly two decades, Ryan Adams, one of the most prolific singer-songwriters of his generation, has been heralded as a mercurial creative genius and a respected industry tastemaker. Equal parts punk-rock folk hero and romantic troubadour, Adams, 44, has 16 albums and seven Grammy nominations to his name. He has overseen music by Willie Nelson, written a Tim McGraw hit and recorded with John Mayer. He has also taken a special interest in the trajectory of female artists, especially younger ones, championing them onstage, across social media and in the studio, where his stamp of approval can jump-start careers. [The F.B.I. has opened an inquiry into Ryan Adams’s explicit communications with an underage fan.] Some now say that Adams’s rock-star patronage masked a darker reality. In interviews, seven women and more than a dozen associates described a pattern of manipulative behavior in which Adams dangled career opportunities while simultaneously pursuing female artists for sex. In some cases, they said, he would turn domineering and vengeful, jerking away his offers of support when spurned, and subjecting women to emotional and verbal abuse, and harassment in texts and on social media. The accounts have been corroborated by family members or friends who were present at the time, as well as by correspondence from Adams reviewed by The New York Times. From a teenager living in a small town to his ex-wife, the singer and actress Mandy Moore, these artists said Adams exploited and then stifled their ambitions. “Music was a point of control for him,” Moore said. When Adams began corresponding online with a fan, Ava, in 2013, she was a 14-year-old bass player already forging a career. But their correspondence about music turned into graphic texting. Eventually, Ava said, they conducted video calls on Skype, where Adams exposed himself during phone sex. The Times has reviewed extensive communication between the two, including 3,217 text messages they exchanged over a nine-month period when Ava was 15 and 16. (The Times is identifying Ava, now 20, by her middle name because she was a minor during their online relationship. They never met in person.) In the texts, Adams questioned Ava repeatedly about her age, and sometimes she said she was older than she was. Though he did not seem convinced, their sexual conversations continued. “i would get in trouble if someone knew we talked like this,” Adams wrote to her in November 2014. [Ryan Adams’s album release has been canceled amid an F.B.I. inquiry.] Andrew B. Brettler, Adams’s lawyer, said that the singer did not recall these exchanges. “Mr. Adams unequivocally denies that he ever engaged in inappropriate online sexual communications with someone he knew was underage,” Brettler said. Through Brettler, Adams said that he did not have the power to make or break careers and categorically denied the “extremely serious and outlandish accusations” in The Times’s reporting. Adams recalled the interactions with the women differently, his lawyer said, referring to some of the allegations as “grousing by disgruntled individuals” who blamed Adams for personal or professional disappointments and were now out to harm him. After this article was published online, Adams posted a series of tweets in which he apologized “to anyone I have ever hurt, however unintentionally.” But he also continued to dispute the accuracy of the reporting. With the album “Heartbreaker” and beloved songs like “New York, New York,” Adams became a solo star in the early 2000s, even as he struggled with well-publicized addiction and mental health issues. He later gained mainstream attention with a cover of Taylor Swift’s “1989” album, released through his own Pax-Am label. Adams was an early adopter in communicating directly with listeners, responding to fans and critics on Myspace and then Twitter and Instagram. He also used social media to scout and meet artists. It was on Twitter that he found Ava, who excitedly messaged him to say hello after she followed him and he followed her back. “I was really alone,” Ava said in an interview, “and he was really friendly and cool.” She had been a gifted bassist since the age of 9. By 12, she was road-tripping with her family to Manhattan for gigs with established musicians. At home, however, Ava was isolated, home-schooled because of bullying. At 13, her father died. Adams represented the creative future she dreamed of. The star floated big ideas about her career prospects in their earliest messages, eventually suggesting that she and another teenager start a band that he could produce. Their conversations were on and off, but a constant theme was Adams fretting about Ava’s age — and asking to keep their exchanges secret — while also indulging in sexual scenarios. “I never see pics of you anymore,” Adams wrote in November 2014, when he had just turned 40 and Ava was newly 16. “You were blowing my mind.” He had pet names for her body parts. Days later, Adams expressed anxiety: “If people knew they would say I was like R Kelley lol,” he wrote. Yet within 10 minutes, the conversation again turned explicit. “I just want you to touch your nipple,” he texted, before again asking about her age. “And tell me that your mom is not gonna kill me if she finds out we even text.” In response to Adams’s repeated pleas that she tell him she was 18 — “You have to convince me,” he wrote — Ava at times said she was. Sometimes he asked to see identification — “in the hottest way that has ever been done Lol.” She never showed him any ID. Adams, through his lawyer, said that while he “has communications online with various fans and aspiring musicians,” he “does not recall having online communications with anyone related to anything outside of music.” The lawyer added that “if, in fact, this woman was underage, Mr. Adams was unaware.” He pointed to her performances in clubs and provided photos of Ava from that time, saying she looked “approximately 20.” Laws regarding explicit digital communication with a minor vary from state to state and are separate from age of consent laws, which encompass physical contact. In Ohio, where Ava lived, it is a felony to solicit, exchange or possess any material that shows a person under 18 engaging in sexual activity. New York, where Adams was during some of these exchanges, has similar laws regarding children younger than 17, and federal statutes use 18 as the age of adulthood. Several legal experts said that prosecuting such cases could involve disputes over jurisdiction and whether the adult reasonably believed the minor was of legal age, taking into account context from their conversations. Ava said that as her communication with Adams went on, she grew uneasy about their unequal dynamic. Once, she said, the two agreed to video chat, but when they connected on Skype, Adams was already naked. “It was just sexual power,” Ava said. As their relationship waned, Adams returned to the possibility of recording together. But for Ava, the idea that she would be objectified or have to sleep with people to get ahead “just totally put me off to the whole idea” of being a musician, she said. She never played another gig. The music world, in which a culture of late nights and boundary-pushing behavior has been normalized, hasn’t been as roiled by the #MeToo movement as other sectors of media and entertainment. But many in the business say that harassment and inequitable treatment of women is pervasive and that the “sex, drugs and rock ’n’ roll” ethos has shielded men from being held to account. In an industry where musicians are often the most trusted gatekeepers, Adams was more than just a singer. His Pax-Am label was connected to Capitol Music Group, a major conglomerate, and an opening slot on one of his sold-out tours could introduce an emerging artist to fans and business partners. For more than a decade, until last year, Adams was managed by John Silva, who has worked with Nirvana, Beck and St. Vincent. (Silva and Capitol, which is scheduled to release three albums by Adams this year, declined requests for comment.) Other women in music said they, too, were subjected to Adams’s intense flattery and a bait and switch in which professional opportunities would be commingled with sexual come-ons. The musician Phoebe Bridgers was 20 when Adams invited her to the Pax-Am studio one night in fall 2014. “There was a mythology around him,” she said. “It seemed like he had the power to propel people forward.” Adams had her perform a song and said he was blown away, comparing her to Bob Dylan, Bridgers recalled. Adams gave her a pricey vintage guitar, she said, and told her to return to record with him the next day. Beguiled by Adams’s energy and enthusiasm, Bridgers brought her best songs. Adams proposed putting them out as a 7-inch vinyl single on his label, setting her on a professional path. But as they discussed the record, Adams started sending Bridgers flirty texts, she said, and a whirlwind romance commenced. Bridgers said the singer began discussing marriage less than a week into their relationship, and insisted that she open for him on his European tour in a few weeks — “a golden pillar of success,” she recalled. Adams told Bridgers’s mother that it was a “once-in-a-lifetime opportunity” to have someone like him looking out for her. Yet in the weeks that followed, Adams’s attention turned obsessive and emotionally abusive, Bridgers said. He began barraging her with texts, insisting that she prove her whereabouts, or leave social situations to have phone sex, and threatening suicide if she didn’t reply immediately. When she broke off the relationship, Bridgers said, Adams became evasive about releasing the music they had recorded together and rescinded the offer to open his upcoming concerts. When three songs by Bridgers were eventually released by Pax-Am in April 2015, bringing her serious industry attention, the media gave Adams credit for her nascent career. Through his lawyer, Adams contested how Bridgers described their relationship, calling it “a brief, consensual fling,” though he did not recall any flirty texts. He never told Bridgers he would withhold her songs, he said. Bridgers said that after their breakup, Adams continued to tease opportunities while pursuing her. He offered her a few dates opening for him on tour in 2017, and after much discussion with her manager about Adams’s behavior, Bridgers said she accepted because it was a big opportunity before the release of her debut album. “Then, the first day, he asked me to bring him something in his hotel room,” she said. “I came upstairs and he was completely nude.” (Adams, through his lawyer, denied this incident.) Two additional female singer-songwriters, who declined to be identified for fear of retribution, described a similar pattern of behavior from Adams: raving about their work and offering tour spots amid aggressive romantic pursuit, followed by harassing messages and threats of professional retaliation when the relationships did not progress as he wanted. Another artist, Courtney Jaye, who was then 35 and not signed to a label, got a direct message from Adams on Twitter in 2013 with immediate offers to collaborate. “You are a psychedelic Ronstadt hybrid,” he gushed. “Come let’s make some music.” They exchanged messages about what her next album should sound like, and Adams offered to produce it, she said. But when they got together days later to work on ideas, Adams began remarking on Jaye’s appearance and moving in on her — “Hurricane Ryan,” as she described him. She said she tried to deflect his attention, and failed; having been victimized before, Jaye added, “I just shut myself off.” They wound up in bed, but didn’t have sex. Jaye felt shaken by how smoothly Adams had taken advantage of her, she said, and that night expressed her dismay to him over the phone. Adams maintained that he still wanted to collaborate, and though the pair continued to correspond for a time, they never recorded anything. Adams’s lawyer said that the singer and Jaye “never had a writing session where they ended up in bed,” and denied that the call afterward took place. Jaye said: “Something changed in me that year. It made me just not want to make music.” Even for an artist like Moore, now a star of the hit series “This Is Us,” Adams could wield his influence in damaging ways. When they met in 2007, she was 23, he a decade older. Professionally, Moore was at a turning point: She was exiting her teen-pop years, and his reputation as a sensitive, authentic voice provided the artistic credibility she craved. In 2010, Adams offered to work on her next album; when she parted ways with her music manager, Adams discouraged her from working with other producers or managers, she said, effectively leaving him in charge of her music career. They wrote songs together regularly that Adams promised to record, but never did. He booked them time at his studio, only to replace her with other female artists, she said. And he lashed out in ways that Moore came to consider psychologically abusive. Adams lorded his artistic accomplishments over her, she said. “He would always tell me, ‘You’re not a real musician, because you don’t play an instrument.’” Through his lawyer, Adams called Moore’s characterization of their time together “completely inconsistent with his view of the relationship,” adding that he was supportive of her “well-deserved professional success.” The lawyer said Adams had been happy to help her career and had not prevented her from working with others. She released her sixth LP, completed before their marriage, shortly after they wed in 2009, and has released no albums since. “His controlling behavior essentially did block my ability to make new connections in the industry during a very pivotal and potentially lucrative time — my entire mid-to-late 20s,” she said. Their divorce was finalized in 2016. Megan Butterworth, Adams’s ex-fiancée, also described him as a controlling and emotionally abusive partner, who later targeted her with digital harassment. During their relationship, he isolated her socially and professionally, she said, trying to dictate who she saw or worked with. And he could turn rageful, smashing things and physically intimidating her, she said, though he never hit her. When she left him in 2018, Butterworth said, he inundated her with hundreds of text messages, phone calls and emails, oscillating between emotional pleas and vitriol, and also threatened suicide and lawsuits. The Times has reviewed dozens of these messages. (Adams, through his lawyer, disputed Butterworth’s account of his behavior as controlling, abusive, or physically intimidating.) Adams also posted images of Butterworth to his Instagram account, tagging her friends and even a family member: “Get it while it’s hot folks,” one read. “[Butterworth] IS SINGLE.” Only recently did the women discover that their experiences overlapped. And in the last few months, Moore and several others who said they were scarred by their relationships with Adams have found one another, creating a support system. “What you experience with him — the treatment, the destructive, manic sort of back and forth behavior — feels so exclusive,” Moore said. “You feel like there’s no way other people have been treated like this.” Realizing they were not alone, the women chose to speak out about their experiences in the hopes of protecting others and moving forward, they said. “I want to make music,” Moore said. “I’m not going to let Ryan stop me.” "
5c4b46e13a125f5075c0659f,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/25/arts/music/verdi-papers-italy.html,"ROME — While working on “Otello” and “Falstaff,” his final two operas, the composer Giuseppe Verdi tucked dozens of pages of musical drafts and sketches into folders, scribbling on their covers: “Burn these papers.” Fortunately, his heirs never carried out those orders. But for years, scholars have complained that for all the access they had to them, those pages might as well have been lost. Locked in a trunk kept at the composer’s  home in Sant’Agata, in northern Italy, only select specialists were allowed to peruse them, mostly at the discretion of Verdi’s heirs. Academics grumbled that requests to study the papers went unanswered. “It was intolerable that scholars couldn’t easily get their hands on the material,” said Sandro Cappelletto, the editor of Studi Verdiani, the journal of the National Institute of Verdi Studies. “We had access to Rossini’s papers, Bellini’s papers. Why should 5,000 of Verdi’s papers remain unread?” For Verdi aficionados, the trunk — made in Chicago by Marshall Field & Company at the end of the 19th century — became a sort of Holy Grail. Rumors about its contents have been the stuff of legend. But on Tuesday, two years after the trunk was transferred by Italy’s Ministry of Culture from the Verdi villa to the state archive in the nearby city of Parma, at least some of those speculations will be laid to rest. Its contents are finally being made public. Locked inside the trunk were drafts and sketches for 12 operas written over nearly half a century, from “Luisa Miller” to “Falstaff,” as well as for works like the Requiem and “Four Sacred Pieces.” They have been cataloged and digitized and will be made accessible to scholars. Alessandra Carlotta Pellegrini, a musicologist who examined the contents, described the experience as getting a firsthand look into “the workshop of the composer.” The trunk contained more than 5,400 pages, around 600 of which are blank: a cornucopia of musical musings, stage directions, afterthoughts and reconsiderations, offering a glimpse into Verdi’s creative process at work “from the very first compositional gesture, where ideas are still fragmentary,” said Ms. Pellegrini, who became involved with the project when she was scientific director of the Verdi Institute. There are hundreds of pages related to “Aida,” “Otello” and “Falstaff,” for example — works whose “genesis has never been completely examined,” Ms. Pellegrini said. The sketches are central to understanding Verdi’s compositional process, she added. Various versions of Iago’s famous “Credo” suggest that it was pondered “arduously,” she said, while “Falstaff” fans will be intrigued by drafts Verdi discarded, like the first version of the opera’s fugue finale. One page, she said, included the scribblings of “an aged Verdi inscribing a passage from the Gospel.” Beyond music, she added, “there’s a life that emerges” from the papers, a lens into the composer’s humanity. They also reflect the passage of time. In the sketches for “Luisa Miller,” which premiered in 1849, Verdi’s handwriting is the “very ordered” writing of a young man, Ms. Pellegrini said, but it becomes “much looser” in the sketches for “Falstaff,” which had its premiere 44 years later. Many of the pages, she added, are difficult to read: “They’re mostly working drafts and sketches,” not intended for posterity. The varying quality of the paper — including porous, less valuable paper that Verdi probably used for initial drafts and more expensive sheets on which he jotted fuller musical sketches — could assist scholars in establishing a timeline of Verdi’s thoughts. “It’s an incredibly important” cache of documents, Mr. Cappelletto, the Studi Verdiani editor, said, which will be “essential for future critical editions.” Verdi’s heirs, the Carrara Verdi family, are less enthusiastic about the trunk’s notoriety, and even less so about the removal from the villa by the culture ministry of another cache of documents — around 24,000, including letters and sundry papers — after experts determined that the family was not preserving them correctly. Those papers are now being held in sealed boxes at the state archive in Parma. The Verdi villa was never widely open, but scholars complained that under the family’s stewardship, it was far too difficult to access documents — despite the fact that Verdi’s papers were declared of public interest in 2008, and as such had to be made available to the public. The culture ministry took the trunk from the villa in January 2017, partly in response to the complaints. There is no substitute for original documents, said Fabrizio Della Seta, a professor of music at the University of Pavia in Cremona, who oversaw the critical edition of “La Traviata” 20 years ago. Access is “indispensable,” he said, and “must be guaranteed.” Angiolo Carrara Verdi, one of the composer’s heirs and the Villa Verdi’s current caretaker, declined to be interviewed. Officials at the culture ministry who oversaw the transfer of the papers, as well as ministry officials at local archives, also declined to comment. Francesco Izzo, the general editor of the critical edition of Verdi’s works, noted that despite the myth surrounding the trunk, its contents hadn’t been a complete mystery. A number of musicologists and scholars have studied individual folders, and, in 2015, Classic Voice, an Italian music magazine that campaigned for access to the documents, published a summary of the contents. “We already had a fairly clear sense of the contents of this trunk,” said Mr. Izzo. But, he added, “we can now build and improve our knowledge even further.” "

Offset’s marital troubles with Cardi B sent him to the celebrity doghouse, but he’s lately re-emerged in search of a public rebrand — devoted husband, committed father and newly introspective rapper. The title track of his solo album, “Father of 4,” is a plea for understanding directed toward his young children. He lists them off, explains how he’s done them wrong, then promises to do better. CARAMANICA The Haitian band Lakou Mizik, which was formed after Haiti’s catastrophic 2010 earthquake, has remade the New Orleans standard “Iko Iko,” a pop hit (for the Dixie Cups and others) based on half-understood Mardi Gras Indian chants that may have Haitian roots. Lakou Mizik added lyrics in Haitian Kreyol proclaiming the Haiti-New Orleans connection; the 79rs Gang, a Mardi Gras Indian alliance, sings the New Orleans chants. Hooting horns from Haiti’s rara carnival tradition mix with the Preservation Hall Jazz Band; there’s percussion from all sides and an earth-moving bass. Mardi Gras is March 5; the cultural cross-pollination, and the party, continue. PARELES The Oscars are Sunday, which means you only have a few days to absorb all the covers of “Shallow” from “A Star Is Born,” including this sharp late entry from Jimmie Allen and Abby Anderson, young country singers with R&B inclinations, who harness the song’s raw power and shellac it with a layer of controlled cool. CARAMANICA The music in “The Barrel” is folky and straightforward, circling through four chords fingerpicked on an acoustic guitar behind Aldous Harding’s demure voice. The words are the conundrum: cryptic, imagistic and distinctly wary of some undefined commitment: “Looks like a date is set/Show the ferret to the egg/I’m not getting led along.” And the video clip, with some surprises near the end, gives nothing away. PARELES On her new album, “Intuition: Songs from the Minds of Women,” the vocalist Alicia Olatuja chose a wide range of songs written by female artists — from Joni Mitchell to Angela Bofill to Imogen Heap — and set about making a new imprint on each. Her album-closing rendition of “This Woman’s Work,” by Kate Bush, features nothing but Olatuja’s luminous, classically trained voice overdubbed a handful of times, wound together in an airy, a cappella arrangement. Bush’s version was an intimate mash-up of ’80s pop and folk song and musical theater; Olatuja has found a way to honor what made it so distinctive, while creating a whole new sound. RUSSONELLO Michael Rother, the guitarist from the 1970s Krautrock trailblazers Neu! (and briefly before that, Kraftwerk), has collected a boxed set of his solo work, including previously unreleased tracks like this one from the score for the 2015 film “The Robbers.” It unfolds methodically, with an octave-bouncing line somewhere between bass riff and mantric melody; three-and-a-half minutes in, some clanking, chattering electronics arrive to give it precisely the lift it needs. PARELES The hypnosis continues. Gunna remains the most clever and intuitive rapper of the post-Young Thug generation, and on “Baby Birkin” — a standout from his new “Drip or Drown 2” — he circles again and again to a rhyme scheme that bleeds across the conventional bar structure, making the final syllable of each phrase into a de facto leadoff rhyme. The result is you never quite know if you’re coming or going, if the end is in front of you or just behind. It’s intoxicating. CARAMANICA Norah Jones has been collaborating widely lately, flexing genre boundaries; this track will be on an album collecting those experiments. “Just a Little Bit” leans toward jazz and Minimalism, with the meticulous Brian Blade on drums carrying a syncopated pulse as Jones sustains a drone on organ and ornaments it sporadically on piano. Her voice is approachable as always, but what she is singing is more confrontational. “I’m not the one you can refuse/I’m not your plaything, I’m not your muse.” Rightfully: This is not a time to take women for granted. PARELES One of the great disappointments of the tail end of the SoundCloud rap boom is how thoroughly its anarchic instincts have been all but wrung out of it. Sometimes, when you hear Lil Pump rap, he sounds like … a regular rapper. Which is fine, of course, if less fun. “Harverd Dropout” is his first full-length album, and while it features successful collaborations with Kanye West, Lil Uzi Vert, YG, 2 Chainz, Quavo and others, it’s most impressive when an awareness of the rest of the world is filtered out. Take “Vroom Vroom Vroom,” an agglomeration of interjections, sound effects, bass throbs and more, slapped atop each other chaotically. It’s exuberant fun, a return to the moment when what Lil Pump and others proposed was a new idea, a radical notion, an essential urge. CARAMANICA Contemplating the optimism of space travel and discord on Earth, Bruce Hornsby delivers a swinging, Minimalistic chamber-pop hoedown, an Aaron Copland-tinged romp with yMusic’s horns and strings ricocheting all around Hornsby’s percussive piano clusters. It’s genial and upbeat, but far from complacent. PARELES The tenor saxophonist Chris Potter, the drummer Eric Harland and the keyboardist James Francies lock into a big-boned, contemporary-jazz groove about a minute into “Hold It,” and you start to hear voices crowding the room. It’s almost all Potter, overdubbed on top of himself, before the dubs drop out and he launches into one of his characteristically herculean solos. This track is from “Circuits,” a new album announcing a fresh band, but one that harkens to the electrified, funk-fusion group Underground, which Potter led about a decade ago. Nowadays, jaw-dropping technical displays are the norm for Potter, but this band can still get something new out of him. RUSSONELLO This full-length song from Tierra Whack keeps things minimal, as she sings and raps over a two-bar, two-chord loop, plus or minus a drumbeat. In an assortment of voices, none of them all that perturbed, she severs her ties to a guy who’s selfish, stingy, dishonest, unfaithful and distracting her from her career. “I don’t wanna work it out,” she informs him, “so cancel our gym membership.” PARELES Here's the thought process behind a breakup, telescoped into five minutes by the three sisters in Teen. It's exposed at the start — a piano, a beat, a voice — with lyrics like “I don’t know why I still pretend that you could still be, maybe, my man.” Then, as details emerge about past conflicts and current letdowns, synthesizers join the chords and the sisters add harmonies to conclude, “I can’t pretend any more.” It's heartsick and triumphal at the same time. PARELES On his new album, “Preminger Plays Preminger,” the tenor saxophonist Noah Preminger honors his great-uncle, the director Otto Preminger, whose noir films were often known for their use of poignant, haunting music. (Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn famously scored “Anatomy of a Murder.”) With help from a stellar, acoustic-jazz quartet, Noah covers pieces from the old movies’ soundtracks, as well as some original compositions inspired by them. “For the Man with the Golden Arm” — an outtake left off the album, which was released on Friday to Newvelle Records subscribers — falls into the latter category; the saxophonist channels the circumspection and the longing of the 1955 film’s original soundtrack into a watery, wandering melody. Preminger overdubs multiple tenor saxophone parts, which paddle around each other and rest gently on Jason Moran’s rippling piano accompaniment. RUSSONELLO "

Let us know at theplaylist@nytimes.com and sign up for our Louder newsletter, a once-a-week blast of our pop music coverage. A couple of months ago, Ariana Grande explained her new strategic philosophy to Billboard: “My dream has always been to be — obviously not a rapper, but, like, to put out music in the way that a rapper does.” Which is to say not on a traditional tightly-controlled pop star rollout, but in the drip-drip-drip fashion of the streaming era, in which artists bombard listeners with music in rapid succession, barely leaving room to reflect. And yet the period leading up to the release of “Thank U, Next,” Grande’s fifth album, which was released on Friday, hasn’t been quite that radical. There were singles, and videos, and now an album — nothing to fear here. The latest single is “Break Up With Your Girlfriend, I’m Bored,” a satisfying thumper with an astral-trap beat and Grande deciding that, in fact, she’d like to be the other kind of rapper as well. Not to say that she’s purely rapping on this song, but rather that rapping as an act has melted so thoroughly that the chasm between what it currently is and what Grande is doing here isn’t very vast. So much so that when she belts out a few lines near the song’s end it sounds like someone else altogether has arrived. (Grande spends the whole video stalking a couple made up of a handsome young man and a Grande doppelgänger. She keeps urging them to split, up until she inserts herself between them, and then she chooses … herself.) JON CARAMANICA “We don’t touch anymore/But we talk all the time so it’s fine,” sings Amber Bain, who records her solo, intricately produced pop as the Japanese House. She’s assessing the later stages of a romance: “Somebody tell me what I want/‘cause I keep on changing my mind.” She surrounds herself with synthesizers and vocal harmonies that can reflect the dizzying swirl of remembered infatuation or the steady trudge of everyday partnership; when the song ends, she still hasn’t figured things out. PARELES A path to solace is indirect and uncertain in “Noise,” the first release from the Brooklyn-rooted songwriter Zsela (whose father is Marc Anthony Thompson, a.k.a Chocolate Genius). Her voice is sumptuous and her phrasing is curvaceous and conversational in “Noise,” a hushed ballad that moves with the rhythm of breathing, not machines. Its backdrop subtly shifts from the sparsity of a lone electric piano to subdued orchestral instruments, and its chords start out unresolved and move in and out of hymnlike uplift, as she ponders the breakups of others and her own: “Cannot count the ways you used to love me,” she muses. “But I can count the ways you used to try.” JON PARELES How sensitive can a guy be? This sensitive. “Can’t we just talk/figure out where we’re going?,” Khalid pleads. There’s a tryst, with “flowers in the room,” but also a reckoning; whatever happens will have to be consensual. The loop has hi-hat sounds and syncopated synthesizers — from Disclosure — as Khalid hops between tenor and falsetto. The result of this negotiation isn’t guaranteed. PARELES Cool-kid pop made by the kids hiding out under the bleachers, “Homework” is a soothing, crypto-melancholy anthem about reflecting on young love. Kim Petras has a warmly synthetic voice, and lil aaron raps in a reassuring tone — together, they’re a sweet, effective pair, delivering teen-flick coming-of-age sparkle with little flickers of gone-too-far darkness. CARAMANICA This ghostly whisper of a waltz is from “Quiet Signs,” the new album by Jessica Pratt. Like the rest of the album, the backup is minimal — acoustic guitar picking, a few notes from a piano — and the production’s low-fi hiss makes Pratt’s soprano even wispier. She sings about singing in “Crossing,” with words dissolving into wordless syllables, turning into an elusive lullaby. PARELES The trumpeter Christian Scott aTunde Adjuah’s pieces often feel like something more than songs, or at least outside of them. They’re like a film composed only of long and powerful shots: The music starts intense and grows more so — comfortable at a steadfast medium tempo, not needing a lot of harmonic movement to swell and push onward. On “Ancestral Recall,” the title track from Scott’s forthcoming album, the focus is squarely on the drums and percussion, which maintain a rabbling, six-beat groove adorned by little more than a ghostly synthesizer and Scott’s scorching trumpet. Then there’s the poet Saul Williams, uttering lines that unpack the tune’s title: “Earth as my hard drive, sky as my witness/There’s no such thing as small spirits, ancestral minorities/Take breath through nature’s hidden forces.” GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO Bassekou Kouyate, from Mali, plays the ngoni, a West African lute that’s a likely ancestor of the banjo, and he leads Ngoni Ba, featuring ngonis of various sizes down to a bass ngoni. “Miri” (“Dream”), the title track of his new album, is an instrumental reverie based, the liner notes say, on worries about Mali’s Islamist insurgency and about climate change. Its fingerpicked vamp carries insistent minor-key melodies and a little bit of ngoni shredding. PARELES A New Orleans jazz band — clarinet, trombone, her own banjo — backs Leyla McCalla in the title song of her new album. The wryly old-fashioned slow-drag setting belies the hardheaded economic realism of “The Capitalist Blues,” a theme statement for an album full of songs about trying to get by in a ruthlessly market-based world. “I am swimming in an ocean of sharks,” McCalla sings, graceful but resigned. PARELES More cheerily melodic tragedy from the Savannah, Ga., rapper Quando Rondo, who is signed to the imprint of the Baton Rouge realist YoungBoy Never Broke Again. In its production, “Gun Powder” has some of the lighthearted toughness of the early T.I./Young Jeezy era, but the real amusement is in how Quando Rondo almost smirk-shrugs his way through some very bitter words: “Send a text to all the opps like, yeah, we want all the smoke/We up by 6, they down by 2, they need to go fix the scope.” CARAMANICA Miho Hazama, a Japanese-born, classically trained composer, is starting to make waves in New York. On Friday she released “Dancer in Nowhere,” her latest album with m_unit, an ensemble combining typical elements of a jazz big band with strings, vibraphone and French horn. The title track starts with the violins in a tentative, prickly dance, before the tenor saxophonist Jason Rigby alights, playing a repetitive melody — unresolved but deeply satisfying — over a bed of strings and horns. A heavier, more percussive section barrels in, with a melody derived from the original line. The song ends back on that soaring first passage, the band playing faster now and Rigby improvising into the beyond. RUSSONELLO With the slow, misty grace of a requiem, “Memories of Nanzenji” finds the keyboardist and crossover-jazz guru Mark de Clive-Lowe reflecting on a visit to the historic temple and gardens in Kyoto, Japan. Featuring a quintet that includes the whirling alto saxophone of Josh Johnson, this tune appears on “Heritage,” a new album out on Friday. It was largely recorded during a run of shows at the Blue Whale in Los Angeles, then de Clive-Lowe augmented the recordings in the studio, adding layers of synthesizer and more. RUSSONELLO I’m old enough to remember when 5 Seconds of Summer was a punk band! I’m old enough to remember when the Chainsmokers were … well, not quite good, but not this bad! If you are less old than I am, here is a song to order Sweetgreen to. CARAMANICA "
5c3e12403a125f5075c0485a,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/15/arts/music/alicia-keys-grammy-awards-host.html,"The singer Alicia Keys will host the 61st annual Grammy Awards on Feb. 10, she announced on Tuesday in a nearly 10-minute celebratory video that emphasized the show as female-driven a year after the Grammys faced controversy over gender diversity. Keys succeeds the late-night host James Corden, who presided over the Grammys for the last two years and took over from LL Cool J, who hosted for five years beginning in 2012. Previous hosts include Queen Latifah, Rosie O’Donnell, Ellen DeGeneres and Garry Shandling. The Grammys host is traditionally onscreen for about 15 minutes of a nearly four-hour show. From 2006 to 2011, there was no host. A 15-time Grammy winner who has frequently performed on the show, Keys has also acted in films like “The Secret Life of Bees” and the show “Empire.” Though not known as a comedian, she represents a straightforward choice at a time when the Academy Awards has battled weeks of bad press over the selection and subsequent withdrawal of Kevin Hart because of his past homophobic comments. [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] Keys, the first woman to host the Grammys in more than a decade, also joins a class of nominees in the major categories that leans more heavily toward female artists than in recent years. At the 2018 show, after only one woman won a prominent award in the televised portion, Neil Portnow, the head of the Recording Academy, ignited a backlash when he said that women in the industry should “step up” to advance their careers. Portnow will step down from the Academy, the organization behind the Grammys, in July, making the February show, which is scheduled to air on CBS, his last. In Keys’s announcement video, which is positioned as a series of candid clips seemingly shot on a cellphone, an unidentified voice tells her about the job offer, noting, “It’s going to be such an exciting show this year because of all the female artists and performers.” Drake and Kendrick Lamar lead the field of nominees, but are followed by acts like Brandi Carlile, Janelle Monáe, Cardi B, H.E.R. and Kacey Musgraves, all of whom will compete for album of the year. The Recording Academy has yet to announce any performers for the show. In the behind-the-scenes footage, Keys goes on to share news of her hosting duties with her mother, her husband (the producer Swizz Beatz), and her children, one of whom responds, “What’s the Grammys?” "

Let us know at theplaylist@nytimes.com and sign up for our Louder newsletter, a once-a-week blast of our pop music coverage. Maren Morris gets the cursing out of the way right at the top of “Girl,” the first single from her second album, due this year. It’s a reminder she’s a country singer, but not really. “Girl,” which Morris wrote with her “The Middle” collaborator Sarah Aarons, as well as Greg Kurstin, has a bit of Billie Eilish, a little Lana Del Rey, maybe some Alannah Myles. And yet thanks to some meaty guitar, it has a slow-country stubbornness. Morris’s ambivalence extends right to the vocal mix, which obscures her, and the arc of the melody, which gets thickened but never builds or finds resolution. JON CARAMANICA There’s no avoiding it: Dolores O’Riordan’s death a year ago (she died from drowning in a London hotel bathtub after heavy drinking) haunts “All Over Now,” the first song from an album — “In the End,” due April 26 — that the Cranberries completed from demo recordings by O’Riordan and Noel Hogan. In the first verse she sings, “Do you remember, remember the night/at a hotel in London.” It turns out to be a song about seeing a woman trying to pretend she’s not a domestic-violence victim yet not getting involved. Guitars buzz in minor chords over a choppy beat, while O’Riordan’s voice — the demo included vocal harmonies — holds stoic regret. Her death multiplies the sadness of the chorus: “It’s all over now.” JON PARELES Tamaryn, a songwriter originally from New Zealand, has long placed her voice amid washes of reverb-laden guitar, mingling impulses from 1960s girl groups and 1990s shoegaze. “Fits of Rage” snaps her reveries into focus; the guitars still echo, but her voice leaps out from them, demanding accountability from someone who seems about to shrug her off. Her voice grows furious as she declares, “You can’t deny I was so close to you.” Sometimes anger is clarifying. PARELES Here’s a thoroughly convincing period piece: a Phil Spector girl-group beat, three chords and lots of reverb behind Lily & Madeleine singing in unison about passion overriding reason: “I try to keep myself together but I’m losing it anyway.” PARELES Glen Hansard, the Irish songwriter from the Frames, the Swell Season and “Once,” reduces his voice to a depressive, scratchy monotone in the ominous, low-self-esteem love song “I’ll Be You, Be Me,” from an album arriving in April. A ticking snare drum and a skulking bass accompany lines like “My lover is all good things/and I’m the fool whose spell she’s under.” By the end of the song he’s engulfed in a tsunami of strings, choir and feedback, but still too glum to raise his voice. PARELES An adorable video for a pro forma duet from two of Latin music’s rising stars who’ve been playing are-they-or-aren’t-they for months. The song is sweet, a little evanescent. Committed-to-video memories are forever, though. CARAMANICA Dawn (Richard, from Danity Kane) promises a weekend-long sexual marathon in “Sauce,” invoking Rihanna, La Perla and the Kentucky Derby over a slow, undulating trap beat. For nearly the entire track, her lead vocal stays on just two low notes; it couldn’t be more single-minded. But around it, voices and instruments materialize like stray fantasies, and a sweetly unexpected a cappella coda anticipates satisfaction. PARELES In which post-Young Thug fever-pitch syllable squeals finally come full circle and arrive at saccharine-sweet pure-pop accessibility. YNW Melly is one of the most impressive young melodists working — see “Murder on My Mind” — and even though there’s not much material to work with in the verses here, the chorus is bright, effusive and sneakily rich. Kanye is a low-impact accent piece here, singing part of the hook and adding bonus whimsy to the video. CARAMANICA Elena Alexandra Apostoleanu, the Romanian singer who records as Inna, pivots toward pop’s center. A decade ago she was singing in English over house-music beats and EDM synthesizers. But more recently, her high, smiley voice has been heard alongside Latin pop hitmakers like J Balvin, Pitbull and Daddy Yankee, in English and Spanish. In “Sin Ti,” a song about a sudden infatuation, she whispers insistent endearments in a catchy, extremely canny production by David Ciente that hops all over the Latin map: dembow verses and flamenco-tinged acoustic guitar in the chorus, with bits of sampled vocals and fleeting string-section phrases winking in and out of earshot. In a small world, she’s up-to-the-minute. PARELES Echoing the keyboard chords of Bruce Springsteen’s “My Hometown,” the Killers’ “Land of the Free” is a compendium of issues — mass incarceration, immigration, racism, gun control — heading into a gospelly chorus. The video clip, centered on news footage, is by Spike Lee; the Killers’ willingness to face a social-media backlash is as significant as the song. JON PARELES Snarky Puppy might be today’s most popular band whose audience wouldn’t be fazed by a nearly 10-minute-long lead single with no words. “Xavi” is the first thing we’re hearing from “Immigrance,” a forthcoming album from this large ensemble of virtuoso music nerds and studio hotshots. Crunchy guitar slices out a truncated phrase in conversation with an insistent snare drum, and flutes and trumpets drape a humid cloud cover overhead. The tune’s head-nodding six-beat rhythm is based around an antique chaabi groove, which Snarky’s bassist and leader, Michael League, learned from Gnawa musicians while performing in Morocco last year. It accords with “Immigrance’s” overall bent, which considers the role of migration and exchange in shaping our world. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO The alto saxophonist Greg Ward’s new album, “Stomping Off From Greenwood,” has the rusted, resonant sound of so much beat-driven jazz coming from Chicago natives today (Jeff Parker, Makaya McCraven, Marquis Hill). But its instrumentation — alto sax, two guitars, bass, drums — calls to mind another standout album from last year, Logan Richardson’s “Blues People.” Like Richardson on his album, Ward bobs gracefully through a coolly plotted improvisation on “The Contender” as his rhythm section handles a stop-and-start polyrhythm, creating friction and expectation and the illusion of an incline for Ward to climb. RUSSONELLO "

Just want the music? Listen to the Playlist on Spotify here (or find our profile: nytimes). Like what you hear? Let us know at theplaylist@nytimes.com and sign up for our Louder newsletter, a once-a-week blast of our pop music coverage. After a six-year gap, Vampire Weekend has re-emerged with a song that wraps misgivings in three-chord elation: first with folksy acoustic-guitar picking, then with gospel-rock piano and congas, later with jammy hints of the Grateful Dead. It all feels jovial until Ezra Koenig’s words register a not-so-oblique dread: “Anybody with a worried mind could never forgive the sight/Of wicked snakes inside a place you thought was dignified/I don’t wanna live like this, but I don’t wanna die.” Meanwhile, anyone seeking meditative sanctuary can click on “120 Minutes of Harmony Hall Guitar” — the opening acoustic guitars simply looping away, adding a modest drone for the second hour. JON PARELES The lyrics are cryptic, and so is the video, with images of armed men, surveillance screens, captive women and lessons in violence. But there’s no mistaking the urgency of Sam Fender’s desperate vocal, the rising refrain “He will play God” and the syncopated, reverberating guitar note that persists throughout the song, keeping things tense. PARELES Fresh from boygenius, her collaboration with Julien Baker and Lucy Dacus, Phoebe Bridgers has teamed up with Conor Oberst (Bright Eyes) as Better Oblivion Community Center, suddenly releasing a full album. It’s folk rock all the way, harking back to the Byrds, Bob Dylan and Ian and Sylvia, with shared lead vocals, intertwined acoustic and electric guitars and, often, a tambourine shaking along. Electric guitars surge and spill over in “Dylan Thomas,” as Bridgers and Oberst sing about power, entertainment and the elusiveness of truth. PARELES For this movie theme, Dua Lipa honors the plot of “Alita: Battle Angel,” a film based on a post-apocalyptic manga about a human brain resurrected as a cyborg warrior: “This is not a swan song,” she sings, “It’s a new life.” But she also ties it in to the female self-assertion of the rest of her catalog: “I won’t stay quiet,” she sings, her voice swelling, “ ’Cause staying silent’s the same as dying.” Backup chants sound like remnants of past civilizations; the beat is mechanized, cybernetic. The song puts human aspiration in electronic armor. PARELES Yes, that Snow. “Con Calma” underscores the endless cycles of borrowing that nourish pop music, messy and unlikely as they may be. In 1992, “Informer,” by the white, Canadian dancehall performer Snow, spent seven weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100. This was an outlier for many reasons, some less obvious than others — Snow had cut his musical teeth in Toronto’s Jamaican community. Over the years, “Informer” has remained, despite occasional mockery, the rare durable, credible example of a song by a white reggae performer. Now, in 2019, reggaeton titan Daddy Yankee, well into the neutralized-pop portion of his career, has built atop it a new song, which is enthusiastic and lighthearted, squeezing something just a little bit too tepid out of something which, in its day, had been the little-bit-too-tepid thing. JON CARAMANICA Agonized and serrated, the new song from Call Me Karizma revives mid-to-late-2000s Warped Tour electro-punk, blends it with emo instincts as refracted through SoundCloud rap, adds in heaping gobs of Marilyn Manson, and tops it off with, hiding in plain sight, a flicker of Yung Joc’s “It’s Goin’ Down.” CARAMANICA “Ecstasy” is an anti-manifesto from Sneaks, the singer, songwriter and producer Eva Moolchan. “I don’t wanna explain,” she whisper-sings, almost as if she’s humming to herself. But meanwhile she’s assembling blips, plinks, a buzzing bass riff, hovering electronic tones and casually intersecting vocal lines into a teasingly enticing track: she’s doing, not telling. PARELES Florence and the Machine almost — but not entirely — separate two threads of her music with a yin-yang pair of new songs. “Moderation” goes for a hand-clapping, room-shaking Motown-flavored rock-soul stomp — think Martha and the Vandellas — as Florence Welch scoffs at the whole notion of moderation in love. “Haunted House” turns inward instead. It starts and ends something like a parlor song, a piano waltz sung by Welch at her most decorous. But when the chorus arrives and she confesses “I’m not free yet,” she doesn’t hold back the buildup; moderation is, indeed, a struggle. PARELES As a collaborator and on her own, Julia Michaels has typecast herself as the queen of neurosis, and she’s true to that brand throughout her latest EP, “Inner Monologue Part 1.” In “Happy,” she sings, “Sometimes I think I kill relationships for art,” and adds, “I pay my bills with it.” A reggae-ish beat heaves and slams below her and a backup chorus joins her in her misery, but at the end, as she quietly moans “I just want to be happy,” there are crickets in the mix. PARELES A tsk-tsk masquerading as a chest puff, J. Cole’s “Middle Child” is the beginning of what he’s suggested is a coming onslaught of new music this year. The themes, however, are familiar: Cole’s love-em-but-needle-em relationship with younger rappers is present in full force. But unlike most elders, he’s also willing to paint himself as a student — hence, middle child. Which is why even though this song echoes mid-2010s Drake triumphalism (and also mentions Drake, for good measure), Cole cuts the arrogance with commitment to granular, almost mundane narrative. All tell, no show. CARAMANICA The saxophonist, flutist and bass clarinetist Eric Dolphy led just five studio sessions in his brief lifetime, yet he’s seen as one of jazz history’s great possibility-expanders — an improviser who squirreled away his masterful abilities under layers of evocative idiosyncrasy, packing his notes with more breath than they could fit, letting them bloom and quiver well beyond their natural pitch. Dolphy’s second-to-last recording session took place in New York in July 1963, with a midsize band, across two days, less than a year before his death at 36. It resulted in a pair of well-reputed albums, “Conversations” and “Iron Man,” but many assumed the complete session recordings were lost. The flutist James Newton — who had held onto a trove of tapes and papers that Dolphy left behind — recently turned them over to Resonance Records, which released 18 of the finest tracks from those 1963 dates on “Musical Prophet: The Expanded 1963 New York Studio Sessions.” Half were previously unissued, including this alternate take of “Jitterbug Waltz,” a Fats Waller classic with a frisky, twirling melody that’s oddly befitting of Dolphy. And mark the trumpeter: It’s the future jazz eminence Woody Shaw, age 18, sounding phenomenal in one of his first professional recording dates. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO Last year’s most awe-inspiring jazz release was “Emanon,” Wayne Shorter’s three-disc masterstroke, much of which he recorded live with his quartet joined by the London Chamber Orchestra. But unless you shelled out for the full boxed set, you probably haven’t heard it yet. Now the digital wait is over — on Friday, Blue Note released the album on streaming platforms. On “Prometheus Unbound,” we hear how skillfully Shorter marshals a string section; he uses the orchestra not only to add strength and harmonic layers, but also to give his wide, intervallic leaps a new dynamic momentum. RUSSONELLO Hearing “Trio Tapestry,” the first album from this all-star group, it’s hard not to think back on Joe Lovano’s work in the Paul Motian Trio, another bass-free combo whose history was entwined with ECM Records. Like Motian’s, the new trio’s music drifts slowly into the space around it, gently filling a room with worried air. But the biggest difference between the bands is in the tumbling, unsettled piano of Marilyn Crispell and the warmer, more diatonic guitar of Bill Frisell (the third member of Motian’s trio). On “Rare Beauty,” Lovano’s trio treats his sharp modal melody with a sense of unfettered freedom, moving loosely in and out of step with each other. RUSSONELLO Que Vola brings together three Afro-Cuban percussionists — all members of the Osain del Monte Orchestra — and seven French jazz musicians. The lead single from the group’s self-titled debut is “Calle Luz,” a quick, pattering original that reshapes a rumba rhythm around its jagged, four-horn arrangement. The West African roots of rumba come through in various ways here; amid all the rhythmic and harmonic complexity, you might even hear echoes of Fela Kuti’s Africa ’70 band in the sound of the Rhodes, bass and drums. RUSSONELLO Sage Fisher, who records as Dolphin Midwives, uses loops of harp and electronic sounds, and sometimes (though not on this track) her voice, to construct tracks that evolve from ambient Minimalism to something considerably more volatile. “Junglespell” starts out pretty and vaguely Asian, with rippling, overlapping harp motifs. But halfway through, an electronic vortex takes shape, in rhythm-disrupting clusters and miniature alarm bells; a pretty coda can’t soothe everything. PARELES "

The tribute makes Elliott the third rapper to ever be honored by the organization, following Jay-Z’s induction in 2017 and Jermaine Dupri’s last year. The list of this year’s inductees was announced on Saturday’s episode of “CBS This Morning,” and featured an appearance by the Hall of Fame chairman and musician Nile Rodgers, who called Elliott “one of my favorite writers of all time.” Not only is Elliott, a Grammy Award-winning artist, responsible for monumental hits from the early 2000s like “Get Ur Freak On” and “Work It,” but she’s also the only female rapper to have six studio albums certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. Over the course of her three-decade career, she’s written for some of the music industry’s most talented female artists, including Beyoncé (“Signs”), Whitney Houston (“In My Business”), Aaliyah (“If Your Girl Only Knew”), Mary J.

5c6f1e1a3a125f5075c0ae32,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/arts/music/boston-symphony-elizabeth-rowe-settlement.html,"Elizabeth Rowe, the principal flutist of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, has settled her pay discrimination lawsuit against the ensemble, bringing to an end a case that sparked international conversation about gender bias in classical music. In her suit, filed last July, Ms. Rowe claimed that her compensation was only about 75 percent that of her closest comparable colleague, the orchestra’s principal oboist, who is a man. It was one of the first complaints filed under a new law in Massachusetts that requires equal pay for “comparable work.” Ms. Rowe, who joined the orchestra in 2004, had sought more than $200,000 in unpaid wages. The amount of the settlement, which was reached on Feb. 14, was not disclosed. In a joint statement both parties said they were “satisfied with the result,” which included a pledge that the orchestra would “continue to collaborate with musicians, staff and other leaders in the field to accelerate the process of achieving gender parity.” The statement also paid tribute to Doriot Anthony Dwyer, a former principal flutist for the orchestra and “trailblazer” who joined the Boston Symphony in 1952, the same year that it became the first American orchestra, according to the statement, to use blind auditions, in which players are hidden behind a screen. Ms. Dwyer, now 96, was one of the first woman to hold a principal chair in a major orchestra — “a suitable achievement for a musician who traces her genealogy (and middle name) back to the suffragist Susan B. Anthony,” The New York Times wrote in 1982. Ms. Rowe and the orchestra pledged to build on the spirit behind practices like blind auditions, which have helped markedly increase the percentage of women in orchestras. “In the same spirit of improvement and innovation it demonstrated more than six decades ago, the orchestra will continue to collaborate with musicians, staff, and other leaders in the field to accelerate the process of achieving gender parity,” the statement said. “The B.S.O. and Elizabeth Rowe look forward to continuing their shared commitment to artistic excellence at the highest level.” "
5c4f33d03a125f5075c06b74,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/28/arts/music/future-the-wizrd-billboard-chart.html,"The rapper Future scored his sixth No. 1 album in less than four years, matching Elton John’s early 1970s chart run and bringing an apparent end to the music industry’s post-holidays sales doldrums. Future’s new album, “The Wizrd” (Freebandz/Epic) — its full title is “Future Hndrxx Presents: The Wizrd” — opened with the equivalent of 126,000 sales in the United States, which includes 144 million streams and 15,000 copies sold as a full album, according to Nielsen. Since Future’s album “DS2” in July 2015, all six albums he has released — including “Evol,” “Future,” “Hndrxx” and “What a Time to Be Alive,” with Drake — have gone to No. 1.

5c46d2743a125f5075c059a9,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/22/arts/music/tour-laundry-hans-juergen-topf.html,"BERLIN — One afternoon in November, Hans-Jürgen Topf walked through the backstage area of the Mercedes-Benz Arena, where dozens of crew members were unloading the equipment for the final stop of U2’s “Experience + Innocence” tour. After enthusiastically greeting and hugging several of the workers, Topf, 62, came to a sweltering room filled with humming washing machines and dryers. “This is my life,” he said. “The artists live their life, and I live my laundry life.” The world’s top specialist for tour laundry, Topf has traveled with many of the world’s biggest music acts, including Madonna, Pink and Beyoncé. As tours have become bigger and more professionalized, their logistics have become increasingly daunting. The U2 tour, which lasted about seven months and spanned two continents, included roughly 150 people, all of whom needed food, housing and clean clothes. That’s where “der Topf,” as he likes to call himself, comes in. His company, Rock ’n’ Roll Laundry, provides equipment and laundry staff for touring productions. Although Topf didn’t join the U2 tour because of a back injury, he was in Berlin to pick up machines he had rented to the crew. (He mostly stays within Germany these days, because of his back, but previous tours have taken him as far as South America and Australia.) “My reputation precedes me,” Topf said, adding that, in the music world, “nobody tackled the subject of laundry, nobody wanted to learn it, until I developed a system for it.” “He is a pioneer,” Jake Berry, the tour’s production director, said by phone. Twenty years ago, Berry said, most tour laundry had to be done quickly during tour stops at a local laundromat. He said the clothes would come back wet, or, “you’d find a girl’s thong in there.” In the early 2000s, Berry said, a “little man” — Topf — began appearing outside German venues with a van, offering to pick up, wash and return the production’s clothes. Berry said that the items were returned “pristine and folded.” Soon after that, he invited Topf to join him on tour. “It’s very hard to find someone who is passionate about laundry,” Berry added. “He is passionate.” [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] A few weeks after the U2 concert, Topf, who has a gray beard and wears metal-rimmed glasses, was in the basement at the Max-Schmeling-Halle, another venue in Berlin, helping his son Achim, 31, do laundry for Die Fantastischen Vier, a popular German rap act. The biggest challenge of doing tour laundry, Topf explained, was the volume, which can vary unpredictably, and the need to work without fixed facilities. He often had to work outside or wherever he could find running water, he said, including, at one point, in empty holding cells intended for disorderly fans in a South African stadium. “I know every disabled bathroom in every German football stadium,” he said. When he is on tour, Topf begins almost every day by washing the performers’ clothes, which usually have to be air-dried with a small fan. The most soiled garments he ever handled, he said, were coveralls worn by the metal band Slipknot that had been sprayed with beer, cream and fake blood, and left in garbage bags for three days. The most common stains on performers’ clothes, he said, were sweat and aluminum dust from truck ramps carried onstage by equipment-case wheels. The dust gets on the clothes when performers throw themselves on their knees or roll around onstage. The best solution, he said, was for crew members to put down mats: “It’s better for the pants.” Washing artists’ clothing involves high stakes. Topf recalled one incident, in which Joe Cocker grew furious after a discolored line appeared in pants that Topf had washed. “I haven’t forgotten that my whole life,” he said. He also once shrank a golden pair of pants that belonged to David Hasselhoff, and a mistake by a dry cleaner Topf had hired once ruined a $3,000 vest belonging to Janet Jackson, he said. But he is quick to point out that mishaps are rare: “Der Topf is mega-reliable.” When on tour, he often spends three to four hours every afternoon ironing the performers’ clothing, his least favorite part of the job, while simultaneously washing the crew’s garments. On some tours, he spends up to 20 hours a day doing laundry, he said. After a show, the machines go into specially built rolling cases, so they can be loaded onto trucks and brought to the next location. Topf pointed out that the touring business has become much more professional and business-oriented since he began. He used to find drugs in the clothes all the time, he said, adding, “These days, I’m more likely to find an herbal tea bag.” Joe Pomponio, a stage manager for numerous festivals in Europe who has worked frequently with Topf, said by phone that, for many acts that have spent years on the road, comforts like professionally done laundry have become vital. He added that he did not know anybody who offered services comparable to Topf’s, and that Rock ’n’ Roll Laundry was a fixture on the European festival circuit. “Der Topf is everywhere,” he said. Topf was born in 1956 to a family of East German refugees. In the communist G.D.R., his father worked as a smuggler, secreting people across the Iron Curtain in potato shipments. After he was caught by the East German secret police, Topf’s father escaped with his wife to Ludwigshafen, then in West Germany, where they founded a laundry. Topf is still based there. One evening in 1982, while making a delivery for his parents’ business, Topf noticed Ted Nugent’s tour bus, seemingly lost. After giving the driver directions, he was given free tickets to the concert, and later that evening, offered to clean the band’s clothes. When Nugent’s manager encouraged him to continue his services, he began standing outside concert venues “like a groupie” and offering same-day laundry services to visiting music acts, including Elton John and Blue Öyster Cult. He eventually bought a small truck, loaded in two washers and two dryers, and drove alongside touring bands. At night, he would sleep on top of his machines, doing laundry during the day for the Bee Gees, among others. Today, Topf’s business makes much of its income by renting out machines to touring productions, and it recently partnered with a businessman who has started an American version of Rock ’n’ Roll Laundry. Topf also runs a laundry business in Ludwigshafen catering to businesses and restaurants. The laundry in Ludwigshafen, he said, features an extensive collection of photographs of his favorite customers, including Phil Collins and Harry Belafonte. Topf said that Belafonte had signed his photo, “Thanks for taking the rocks out of my pants.” “I have no idea what that means,” Topf said, “but that’s the kind of thing you keep.” "

The store she walked into one morning this fall, Steinlauf & Stoller, is one of New York’s garment district survivors. It’s a family business that has supplied the sewing industry since 1947 with pins and needles, buttons and snaps, threads and ribbons, and tools of the trade. Including Ms. Wolfe’s object that day: scissors. “The big thing is the sound,” she explained to the store’s manager, Sid Schwarzenberger. “I’m not really looking for how they cut.” Ms. Wolfe was in the market for scissors to be wielded by the women of the chorus in her new oratorio, “Fire in my mouth.” The work, which will be given its premiere on Thursday by the New York Philharmonic, explores the Triangle shirtwaist factory fire of 1911, which killed 146 garment workers, mostly immigrant women, including many who were trapped by locked exit doors. Their deaths helped change the way New York and the nation thought about safety, the labor movement and the struggle for women’s equality. Ms. Wolfe’s previous oratorio about labor in America, “Anthracite Fields,” about the hardships faced by Pennsylvania coal miners, won a Pulitzer Prize in 2015. She is known for her evocative orchestrations and varied sound palettes, and in parts of “Fire in my mouth” she wanted to suggest factories.  She wrote string parts that recall sewing machines, and at several points in the score she included the sound of scissors opening and closing. She imagined the effect as more of a slow, resonant “swoosh” than a staccato, castanet-like “snip.” But she had to find the right ones for the job. So she set out one morning in October on a scissor listening tour — starting out in the garment district, making a stop at a theatrical wardrobe supply store, and trying out the scissors at a West Village hair salon for good measure. She ended at a tailor’s shop in SoHo, just a short walk from the site of the Triangle fire: a building that still stands a block east of Washington Square Park and is now, like so much of the Village, part of New York University. Along the way, she got an education. At Steinlauf & Stoller, Mr. Schwarzenberger showed her pocket scissors, thread snips, embroidery scissors, bent trimmers, pattern notchers and pinking shears. At one point he handed her a small pair, which would be easy for the chorus to hold. But they were nearly silent. “I was going to make a bad joke,” Ms. Wolfe said, hesitating before deciding to go for it anyway: “This doesn’t cut it.” She soon fell in love with the sound of a heavy pair of 12-inch shears made by Wiss — a company, Mr. Schwarzenberger explained, that had once made its scissors in Newark but has since moved production overseas. “This is so big you could use two hands,” Ms. Wolfe said. These days, Mr. Schwarzenberger said, many garment factories use machines or lasers to cut cloth. “Like John Henry and that steam engine,” Ms. Wolfe mused, invoking the subject of another of her labor-related pieces, “Steel Hammer,” a musical retelling of the legend of John Henry pitting his superhuman strength against a machine. Her next stop was Manhattan Wardrobe Supply, a large store on the eighth floor of a building on West 29th Street that caters to New York’s theater and film industries. Ms. Wolfe tried out some Fiskars shears (“Eliminates Fabric Fray,” the package promised) and some Gingher dressmaker shears (whose package touted “smooth, mistake-free cutting”). Neither was quite as resonant as the Wiss. Then it was off to the hairdresser’s: the chic Seagull salon on West Fourth Street. Jenna Huber, an assistant stylist, showed Ms. Wolfe a large assortment of barber scissors. But even after the dance music was turned down, they were hard to make out. “You hear it when your hair’s getting cut,” Ms. Wolfe said, “but I guess it’s close to your ears.” Her last stop was King Garment Care, on the Avenue of the Americas just below Houston Street, a family-owned shop with a dry cleaner and 16 full-time tailors who add elbow patches and working buttons to the sleeves of sport coats; give off-the-rack suits a fitted, bespoke feel; hem and distress jeans; and make wedding dresses ready for the big day. Hearing that Ms. Wolfe was interested in sound, Victoria Aviles, the owner, ran some of her sewing machines: one that does the purl stitch, and another that she had just bought because its chain stitch is needed for work on jeans.  Like many generations of New Yorkers in the garment industry, Ms. Aviles came to the United States as an immigrant — in her case, from Colombia. She said that the idea of using scissors as an instrument made her think of “The Typewriter,” a lighthearted Leroy Anderson orchestral piece that uses the clicks, clacks and bells of a typewriter as percussion. Ms. Wolfe said she didn’t know it. “You never heard it?” Ms. Aviles said. “Oh my god, we have to educate this woman!” As Ms. Wolfe watched the shop’s tailors work, she finally heard another pair of scissors she liked. She checked the manufacturer. “These are Wiss!” she exclaimed. So last week, when three dozen singers from the Crossing, a Grammy-winning chamber choir dedicated to new music, gathered in the Presbyterian Church of Chestnut Hill in Philadelphia to rehearse the piece, it was heavy Wiss scissors that were placed on their music stands. (“Sid gave me a deal,” Ms. Wolfe said.) The conductor, Donald Nally, urged the singers to handle the scissors with care as they took them out of their sheaths and held them aloft, observing that the spectacle looked like “Sweeney Todd.” The group tested the sound the scissors made when they were opened with one hand, then two hands. Finally, everyone was satisfied. “The swoosh is good,” Ms. Wolfe said. The scissor-wielding women of the Crossing will be joined in performance by a large chorus of girls from the Young People’s Chorus of New York City, who will begin with excerpts from a 1909 speech the garment worker and activist Clara Lemlich delivered urging exploited garment workers to strike and from an oral history: I want to say a few words. I am a working girl. One who is striking against intolerable conditions. We laid down our scissors shook the threads off our clothes and calmly left the place that stood between us and starvation. “Fire in my mouth” will be sung by 146 women and girls — the same number of people who died in the fire. And the girls will serve as a reminder that the disaster’s victims were as young as 14. "
5c2fc6a13a125f5075c02e6d,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/arts/music/britney-spears-cancels-vegas-residency.html,"The veteran pop singer Britney Spears announced “an indefinite work hiatus” on Friday, canceling her new Las Vegas residency, “Britney: Domination,” that was set to run at the Park MGM resort beginning in February. “I don’t even know where to start with this, because this is so tough for me to say,” Spears, 37, wrote on social media. “I will not be performing my new show Domination.” She cited the health of her father, Jamie Spears, who she said “almost died” two months ago. Representatives for Spears said her father’s colon spontaneously ruptured, causing him to spend 28 days in the hospital. “We’re all so grateful that he came out of it alive, but he still has a long road ahead of him,” the singer wrote. “We have a very special relationship and I want to be with my family at this time just like they have always been there for me.” Jamie Spears has played an outsize role in his daughter’s music and merchandising career since 2008, after she suffered an infamous and prolonged public breakdown. Since then, her father and a lawyer, Andrew Wallet, have overseen Spears’s life and finances via a court-approved conservatorship, known sometimes as a guardianship, designed for people who cannot take care of themselves — typically the old, the infirm and the mentally disabled. (Though much of Spears’s arrangement is kept private in a Los Angeles probate court because of her fame, filings have cited an undisclosed mental illness and substance abuse as the reasons for the decade-long conservatorship.) Spears, one of the best-selling artists of all time, last released an album, “Glory,” in 2016. Though she has also toured and appeared on television since the conservatorship took effect, Spears’s primary project in recent years has been a tightly controlled, greatest hits Las Vegas residency. Beginning in 2013, “Britney: Piece of Me” ran for four years at the Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino, grossing a reported $138 million across nearly 250 shows. Traditionally the domain of performers in the twilight of their careers, Vegas residencies have become a more common revenue source for pop acts since the success of shows by Spears and Celine Dion, with similar productions in recent years from Jennifer Lopez, Gwen Stefani and the Backstreet Boys. Lady Gaga’s “Enigma” residency will run at the Park MGM throughout this year. Representatives for Spears said “Domination” was “on hold until further notice,” but added that Jamie Spears was expected to make a full recovery. In October, Wallet, the lawyer and co-conservator, cited the expected success of the new Vegas show as he requested his fee for overseeing Spears’s business be raised to $426,000 a year. He said in court filings that the singer’s estate, which had been “nearly out of funds,” had raised its worth to at least $20 million since 2014, because of the singer’s “increased well being and her capacity to be engaged.” He added, “The next several years promise to be very lucrative.” "

Just want the music? Listen to the Playlist on Spotify here (or find our profile: nytimes). Like what you hear? Let us know at theplaylist@nytimes.com and sign up for our Louder newsletter, a once-a-week blast of our pop music coverage. Quiet, nightmarish and nursery-rhyme catchy, Billie Eilish’s “Bury a Friend” is matter-of-fact about mourning’s connection to death wish: “Bury a friend/I want to end me.” The video, her creepiest yet, is not for the needle-phobic; the song on its own is unflappably ominous. Its beat is a muffled but brisk electronic shuffle; her voice, moving in and out of electronic effects, is detached and crisply rhythmic, as she wonders, “Why aren’t you scared of me/Why do you care for me?” Another line from the song supplies the title of the debut album she just announced: “When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?” JON PARELES YBN Cordae is one of the most promising young technicians in hip-hop. It’s little surprise, then, that his song celebrating women from various parts of the country (and the world) — his own version of Ludacris’s “Area Codes” — is lighthearted and a little crude, but also lyrically clever, just sharp enough to make the bawdiest moments go down easy. JON CARAMANICA Perky turns menacing — and “fashionista” becomes a three-syllable word — in “Fashionista” by the Japanese group Chai; its first album was “Pink” in 2017, and this is from its coming one, “Punk.” Sing-chanting over a strutting bass line — like the Spice Girls, but switching between English and Japanese — Chai’s voices rattle off thoughts on applying makeup to “get it all sexy” before declaring, in a cloud of backup vocals, “We are fashionista!” By the end of the song, dissonant guitar chords have surfaced, the beat is crashing and ricocheting around, and that cloud of voices has turned into a typhoon: a party out of bounds, or a consumer revolt? PARELES Here’s a track that thumps, blips and hisses its way toward the limbic system, while a filtered voice urges, “Get loose to the rhythm of the drum.” Paradoxically, amid all those programmed beats and swoops, I don’t hear an actual drum. PARELES A hard smack of good cheer from the Lil Peep archives, which still hold a bounty of collaborations with his good friend, the D.I.Y. sing-rap innovator iLoveMakonnen. Much like iLoveMakonnen’s underappreciated 2017 single “Love,” “I’ve Been Waiting” has some 1950s guilelessness at its core, blended with 1980s pop optimism. What’s striking here is how intuitive a melodist iLoveMakonnen is — Lil Peep smear-sings the chorus, while iLoveMakonnen sounds jubilant even though the sentiment leans dark. Patrick Stump of Fall Out Boy, the guest of honor, finds a welcome home for his tight yelps — he sounds anxious, as always, but also happy to be here. CARAMANICA The South African rapper Yugen Blakrok, who made a quick appearance on the “Black Panther” soundtrack album, has a full album out today, “Anima Mysterium.” In “Picture Box,” she confronts media distortion and “horrific daily news” that’s “spewing words without content/spoken out of context,” and she summons mystical remedies. Her voice is low and insistent, in a thick, trudging, orchestral track that faces burdens with tenacity. PARELES “Despacito” taught Luis Fonsi to breathe. For almost two decades, he’d been among the more powerful vocalists in Latin pop, but he rarely allowed himself to find a pocket, a groove, and reside there peacefully. So what’s notable about “Vida,” his new album, is how he leans back from his vocal authority and finds ways to dole it out carefully, like on the lilting guitar caresser (with extremely light EDM flickers) “Poco A Poco.” “Vida” is, shockingly, Fonsi’s first album following the globe-smashing success of “Despacito,” released two years ago. Both versions are here — the original, and the remix with Justin Bieber — and, it should be said, they still go hard. CARAMANICA Allison Miller was aboard the New York subway while she wrote most of the tunes on “Glitter Wolf,” her fifth album with Boom Tic Boom, something that shows through in the music. These pieces have the sturdy, thwacking power of so much of Miller’s drumming — which is equally informed by punk and jazz — and the jostling momentum of an M.T.A. car on the move. Miller writes melodies with purpose, and many of the tunes on the LP seem destined to stick with you, perhaps none more than “Daughter and Sun.” It starts off as a romp, its swinging melody nodding to Ornette Coleman in one moment, and Middle Eastern maqam in the next. The sextet slowly dissolves until all we’ve got left is Miller alone. She picks up the pieces, playing a drum solo that coheres into a powerful rumble, and sends us back to that joyful melody. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO White Denim, a long-running band from Austin, loves the impact of garage rock, the melodies of pop and the musical and verbal intricacies of prog rock. “NY Money” is nearly seven minutes of perpetual motion, semi-sequiturs and two-chord (the intro has three) Minimalist obsessiveness. It hurtles through thoughts of drugs, death, self-renewal, disappearance, a gaptoothed waitress and high finance without ever losing its limber momentum. PARELES Paul Webb, who was the bassist in the 1980s band Talk Talk, first recorded as Rustin Man in 2002, on a duo album with Beth Gibbons of Portishead. The sequel, 17 years later, is the Rustin Man album “Drift Code,” and it’s a throwback to the post-psychedelic British prog rock of the late 1960s and early 1970s — particularly Soft Machine and its bemused, melancholy singer, Robert Wyatt. “Judgment Train” is a bluesy, jammy, wah-wah-loving railroad ride toward an unknowable afterlife. PARELES Two sound-worlds meet on this track from “An Attempt to Lift the Veil,” a duet album by Jim Jarmusch, on electric guitar, and Jozef van Wissem, on lute. One is a loud, constantly evolving yet somehow meditative feedback drone; the other is a handful of laconic, minor-key motifs on lute. One is clangorous, amorphous, psychedelic, the other consonant, neatly contained and semiclassical. Somehow, they harmonize. PARELES "
5c793a1649f0eacbf105add2,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/01/arts/music/ryan-adams-tour-canceled.html,"Ryan Adams’s planned tour of Britain and Ireland, due to start March 30 in Dublin, has been canceled, two weeks after allegations of sexual misconduct against the singer-songwriter emerged. On Friday, SJM Concerts, the tour’s promoter, issued a statement saying the tour had been canceled and that full refunds would be issued to ticket holders by Monday. On Feb. 13, The New York Times reported allegations that Mr. Adams had repeatedly manipulated and harassed women in the music industry, offering to jump-start their careers only to pursue them sexually and in some cases retaliate if they spurned him. [Read The New York Times report here.] The F.B.I. began an investigation into one of the allegations: that Mr. Adams exchanged sexually explicit images with an underage teenager. Mr. Adams has denied the characterizations of his behavior as abusive or manipulative and challenged the accuracy of The Times’ reporting, though he apologized on Twitter “to anyone I have ever hurt, however unintentionally.” Mr. Adams has also denied he has ever engaged in sexual communications with someone he knew was underage. The allegations led to a rapid response in the United States: Mr. Adams’s next album, “Big Colors,” was put on hold indefinitely. Two musical equipment companies that worked with the singer also suspended their relationships with Mr. Adams. Several musicians who had worked with him spoke out in support of the women who made the accusations. But uncertainty had remained over Mr. Adams’s tour of Britain and Ireland despite fans calling for refunds online and in the British media. One fan who paid more than $200 to attend “Ryan’s pinball lair experience” at a concert, a form of V.I.P. package, told The Guardian that she had felt “physically sick” after reading the allegations in The Times. “I don’t want to support such a person,” she added. Despite the pressure, SJM Concerts did not respond to media requests about the tour until Friday. Earlier this week, it appeared that the tour would go on. On Tuesday, a spokesman for London’s Royal Albert Hall, which was to host two concerts, said in an email that SJM Concerts had advised them the concerts were happening. "

A new Mark Morris dance, “Sport,” set to Satie’s “Sports et divertissements,” will be given its world premiere. And a musical, theatrical adaptation of the Langston Hughes poem “The Black Clown” by the bass-baritone Davóne Tines and the composer Michael Schachter, will get its New York premiere. Those are among the highlights of this summer’s Mostly Mozart Festival, which will run from July 10 through Aug. 10 at Lincoln Center, and which is continuing to adapt and broaden its mandate since Lincoln Center stopped presenting its namesake summer festival last year. This summer’s festival, in addition to presenting classical concerts by the Mostly Mozart Festival Orchestra conducted by its music director, Louis Langrée, and more modern fare performed by International Contemporary Ensemble, will be centered around five large-scale, staged productions. [Check out our Culture Calendar here.] “The Magic Flute” has been seen by more than 300,000 people around the world since its premiere at the Komische Oper Berlin in 2012, in a staging by Suzanne Andrade and Barrie Kosky featuring animation by Paul Barritt. It will be conducted in New York by Mr. Langrée and will run at the David H. Koch Theater from July 17-20. It will be the New York debut for Mr. Kosky, an Australian-born impresario who has injected new life into the Komische Oper as its artistic director and has directed Wagner’s “Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg” at the Bayreuth Festival, and who is staging Offenbach’s “Orphée aux Enfers” this summer in Salzburg. Three of the summer’s big-ticket items involve dance. The Mark Morris Dance Group will open the festival with “Sport,” its new Satie work, which will be paired with “Empire Garden,” set to Ives, and “V,” set to Schumann. “Blak Whyte Gray,” by the London-based hip-hop dance company Boy Blue, which was well-received last fall at the White Light Festival, will return. And “Under Siege,” a mixture of dance and martial arts by the Chinese choreographer Yang Liping, will get its United States premiere. “The Black Clown,” an adaptation of Hughes’s painful dramatic monologue of racism and oppression, earned strong reviews when it had its premiere last fall at the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Mass. It will run from July 24-27 at the Gerald W. Lynch Theater at John Jay College. This summer’s concert lineup will feature soloists including the violinists Joshua Bell, Vilde Frang and Pekka Kuusisto and the pianists Martin Helmchen, Pierre Laurent-Aimard and Steven Osborne.

5c6d72033a125f5075c0a9bc,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/20/arts/music/marc-martel-queen-freddie-mercury-bohemian-rhapsody.html,"There are three things Marc Martel says he won’t do to impersonate Freddie Mercury. He won’t wear Mercury’s trademark yellow jacket. He won’t go onstage wielding Mercury’s favored half microphone stand. And he won’t grow a full mustache. Here’s the one thing Martel needs to do: open his mouth. Through genetics and musical aptitude, the 42-year-old singer is a vocal doppelgänger for the Queen frontman. That’s a gift that has led Martel, formerly the leader of a Christian band in Canada, to a lucrative second career in recent years — and a prominent but invisible role in “Bohemian Rhapsody,” the hit biopic nominated for five Academy Awards at the Oscars on Sunday. It’s not the life Martel planned, but it’s landed him on “American Idol” and in front of crowds of thousands worldwide. “I keep realizing how weird a situation I’m in,” Martel said in a phone interview. “I’m trying to keep a good head about it.” Rami Malek embodies Mercury onscreen, but as he told The New York Times last year, “No one wants to hear me sing.” During the performance sequences in “Bohemian Rhapsody,” the movie sometimes employs Mercury’s actual vocals from the Queen archives, but that wasn’t always practical — some scenes demanded a stunt vocal-cord performer. [Relive one of Freddie Mercury’s great moments: when Queen took “Bohemian Rhapsody” to Live Aid.] The film’s creators have conceded that the sung vocals in the movie are largely by Mercury and Martel, although they haven’t broken down the specifics of who contributed what; doing so might distract from Malek’s performance. Martel, who received a fleeting “additional vocals” billing, acknowledged that he worked on the movie, but citing his nondisclosure agreement, would not go into detail. That leaves him with a ghostly status much like that of Marni Nixon, who provided the singing voices both of Maria in the movie of “West Side Story” (for Natalie Wood) and Eliza in the movie of “My Fair Lady” (for Audrey Hepburn), without credit. Even though Martel doesn’t get the awards-show glamour that Malek is enjoying, he’s proud of his contributions to “Bohemian Rhapsody.” The first time he saw it wasn’t at a red-carpet event: He caught it in Cool Springs, Tenn., with his wife and manager, wearing “our comfy clothes.” He had wanted to enjoy the movie as a spectator, but “I couldn’t help waiting for the next scene where I was going to hear my own voice,” he said. So the Martels bought out a movie theater showing, invited 80 of their closest friends and treated it like a party. Martel grew up in Montreal listening to pop (George Michael was a favorite) and Christian music (his parents worked at a church as pastor and choir director). All he knew of Queen was the scene in the 1992 comedy “Wayne’s World” where the characters rock out to “Bohemian Rhapsody” in an AMC Pacer. He started a Christian rock band called Downhere with some friends in college; in 2001, they signed a record deal and moved to Nashville. He believes that the first person to tell him he sounded like Freddie Mercury was the Downhere bassist Glenn Lavender. It was a compliment, given how Mercury was one of the great singers in rock history, possessing a pellucid tone, a three-octave range and an operatic quality that could make even paeans to bicycle riding sound emotional. But Martel didn’t initially take it as praise. “That’s cool — I sound unoriginal,” he recalled thinking. But he checked out Queen’s greatest hits, hoping to learn something from Mercury (who died in 1991 of AIDS-related pneumonia): “I never thought it would amount to anything more than a fun karaoke trick.” In 2011, however, with Downhere having run its course after seven studio albums, Martel heard that the Queen drummer Roger Taylor was putting together an authorized tribute band called the Queen Extravaganza and won a spot on vocals with an audition video of “Somebody to Love” that went viral. Martel sounds close enough to Mercury that he can itemize the subtle differences: “I’m not British, so I don’t usually sing with an accent. I don’t have extra teeth like he did, so my Ss come out normally — his were very piercing,” he said. “But even if I don’t try to sing like Freddie Mercury, people still hear him in my voice, no matter what I do. I have this weird unique thing where I can sound like him, so why wouldn’t I?” Martel now steadily tours with his own Ultimate Queen Celebration and also does shows with the Black Jacket Symphony and Symphonic Queen. He said the Queen catalog has made him a better singer and inspired him to take better care of his voice — while he felt comfortable backing off a high note in one of his own songs when necessary, he doesn’t like to disappoint Queen fans who expect to hear a song the way they know it from the radio. Last year he released an album of Queen covers, “Thunderbolt & Lightning,” and his YouTube covers of Queen classics have become popular enough that he finds himself recognized in public — especially outside the United States, which was never the band’s biggest market. Martel, who has concerts booked in 14 countries this year, from Ukraine to New Zealand, notes that American crowds generally don’t know the arm movements and clapping that traditionally accompany “Radio Ga Ga,” while international audiences will do it unprompted. Although Queen has been a part of his life for nearly a decade, Martel is still figuring out “what being a tribute artist means,” he said. “For some reason, there’s a stigma around it.” A little defensively, he cited Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley and classical musicians as interpreters of other people’s work. Martel records an annual Christmas EP and still writes songs, but he doesn’t currently have an outlet for them; he dreams of a day when he can throw just one original into a set of Queen covers. He recalled a recent conversation with his manager, who told him, “I’d like you to consider your songwriting the way I view my golf game — I love playing golf, but it’s not what’s paying the bills right now.” That was hard for Martel to hear, but he ultimately accepted its wisdom. “The next five years, there’s going to be a lot of Queen,” he said, and chuckled. “But at the same time, I’m going to work on my golf game.” "

The same could be said of music. In uncertain times, it is often musicians who are quickest and best able to express our underlying anxieties, and their work is stronger for it. Accordingly, we asked four artists, Stephen Malkmus, Kelsey Lu, Bonnie “Prince” Billy and Meg Baird to write and record original songs that meditate on the theme of America in 2024. Each artist took this prompt in a different direction. From the distorted techno of Malkmus’s track “Airplane Air,” which he envisages as something that might, in the future, be played “on pirate radio in a police state,” to the mournful psych-rock strains of Baird’s song “1,000 Goodbyes x 100 Hellos,” in which she asks, in her words, “whether we can trade our collective environmental, social and economic anxieties for action,” listen to the four tracks below.

There’s an amazing little wooden tiger in the American Folk Art Museum’s teaching collection. Made around 1980 in Oaxaca by Manuel Jimenez, the piece is at once so simply shaped and so brightly painted that it comes across less as a depiction of any specific animal than as a vivid realization of the very idea of tigerness.  Starting Jan. 16, you’ll be able to visit it, along with a spotted pig, a yellow fox and a green dog, in the lobby of the Citigroup Building in Long Island City as part of “A Kingdom in Pieces,” where they’ll be keeping company with contemporary animal-focused paintings by artists associated with the nearby Fountain House Gallery. WILL HEINRICH January 17 and 18; bowerypresents.com. There’s a comforting nostalgia to much of the music by Japanese Breakfast, the solo project of the singer-songwriter Michelle Zauner. Her polished sophomore album, “Soft Sounds From Another Planet,” is a lush, sweet take on ’90s shoegaze and dream pop, with hazy layers of reverb-heavy guitar and synths that give her music an organic-sounding richness. But her retro aesthetic sounds fresh, in part thanks to its sharp songwriting and focus on contemporary anxieties. The soothing vibe belies the familiar existential dread in the poetic lyrics. “All of our celebrities keep dying/While the cruel men continue to win,” Zauner sings in “Till Death,” a song she has said is about love. The music, which can be heard live during Zauner’s two-night run at Brooklyn Steel, rewards those who pay close attention. Even her artist name is a way to distinguish who’s a true fan and who’s just along for the ride: She’s Korean-American, not Japanese, and has made her relationship with her identity an important part of her work. As she told Teen Vogue last year, “I think that right now there are a lot of young kids that are pushing marginalized voices to the front, and I think I feel kind of a part of that.” NATALIE WEINER Through Jan. 20, labtheater.org. There are new works, and then there are scripts so fresh from the playwright’s fingertips that they reach the stage with no time for rehearsal. That’s what happened last year at Labyrinth Theater Company’s Barn Series, a festival of new-play readings, the night that the Pulitzer Prize winner Stephen Adly Guirgis presented some fragments of a work in progress. In the minutes before the reading, from his adaptation of the movie “Dog Day Afternoon,” Guirgis stood onstage with a dozen actors, quietly explaining to each of them who they were playing and the circumstances of their scenes. The resulting performance was exhilarating — huge energy packed into the tiny studio space at the Cherry Lane Theater in Greenwich Village, where the free festival is back this week. Elizabeth Canavan’s “Ladies in Waiting,” Brett C. Leonard‘s “Papo” and Mariana Carreño King’s “The Red Gene” are among the plays in this year’s series, which wraps up Jan. 20 with three Guirgis works. One of the plays will get a full Labyrinth production this summer. LAURA COLLINS-HUGHES Through Jan. 20; joyce.org. In the winter, live dance warms you up. The Joyce Theater provides some necessary heat with its Cuba Festival 2019, which features two returning groups. Malpaso Dance Company (through Jan. 13) presents works by Ohad Naharin, Merce Cunningham and up-and-coming Cuban choreographers, while Compañía Irene Rodríguez (Jan. 18-20) offers “Mas Que Flamenco,” a program of short pieces.  Wedged in between is the United States debut of the intriguingly named contemporary company Los Hijos del Director, or The Children of the Director (Jan. 15-16). In “The Last Resource,” choreographed by George Céspedes, who formed the troupe in Havana in 2013, dancers explore the obstacles that Cubans face. Alienation, uncertainty, change — it’s starting to sound all too familiar, in or out of Cuba. But this work, with music ranging from heavy metal and electronica to pieces by Cuban singer-songwriters, promises to be anything but. GIA KOURLAS Jan. 13 and 20; pbs.org. Charles and Diana. William and Kate. Harry and Meghan. But without Victoria and Albert, that phenomenon forever after known as the royal wedding might not exist. In “Victoria & Albert: The Wedding,” airing on Sundays, Jan. 13 and 20, on PBS (check local listings), the British historian Lucy Worsley breathlessly details the first cousins’ path to the altar: the conspiracy to marry them from their births and their fizzled introduction on her 17th birthday (he was plump and had dreadful diarrhea; she liked her gift of a parrot more). Then came their second meeting, when Albert, by then a frog transformed, ignited in the young queen a sensation of “pure, beautiful, gobsmacking love,” as one expert puts it. Get that girl her fan. Worsley then reimagines their 1840 nuptials, devised as the P.R. coup of the century — the better to herald the modern constitutional monarchy — down to Victoria’s white wedding dress, which popularized the color for brides, and a breakfast feast resplendent with skinned hares, taxidermied pigeons (adorning pigeon pies) and a 300-pound fruitcake. The pomp and passion continues as Season 3 of “Victoria,” also starting Jan. 13, finds revolution sweeping across Europe — and the plucky monarch (Jenna Coleman) confronting a crisis that could end her reign. KATHRYN SHATTUCK Jan. 16; filmforum.com. Chela (Ana Brun) and Chiquita (Margarita Irún), the descendants of wealthy families in Asunción, Paraguay, have been partners for 30 years. But in the first frames of “The Heiresses” — opening Jan. 16 at the Film Forum and coming to theaters in other major cities — strangers rifle through their once-opulent apartment as the couple sell off cherished belongings now that their money has run out. So, apparently, has their luck: Chiquita has been accused of fraud and sent to prison, leaving Chela mired in loneliness and encroaching poverty. When a gossipy older neighbor (María Martins) asks Chela for a lift to her card game, she reluctantly begins a sort of taxi service, finding an unfamiliar freedom behind the wheel of her vintage Mercedes. Then Angy (Ana Ivanova) — younger, brash, sexy — climbs into the passenger seat. And something in Chela stirs. Brun, in a fine debut, won the Silver Bear for best actress at the 2018 Berlin Film Festival. And the director Marcelo Martinessi, who says he was inspired by the romance between Paraguay’s petite bourgeoisie and authoritarian regimes, captured the Alfred Bauer Prize for a feature “that opens new perspectives.” KATHRYN SHATTUCK Jan. 16-17; metmuseum.org. The soprano Julia Bullock is in the midst of a hotly anticipated and now widely celebrated five-event residency at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where she has already performed traditional slave songs, settings of poetry by Langston Hughes, a new version of John Adams’s oratorio “El Niño,” and a bevy of other contemporary works.  On Wednesday and Thursday at the Met, she will inhabit the part of Josephine Baker in composer Tyshawn Sorey’s “Perle Noire: Meditations for Joséphine.” Described by The New York Times upon its 2016 debut as “one of the most important works of art yet to emerge from the era of Black Lives Matter,” the work melancholically reimagines songs by this complex icon, with texts by the poet Claudia Rankine. It has continued to evolve in performances by Bullock and the International Contemporary Ensemble, and remains powerfully relevant. As Sorey told The Times, “The lyrical content is timeless, and I wanted to create something musically to reflect what we’re experiencing now.” WILLIAM ROBIN "
5cace78849f0eacbf1f8204e,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/09/arts/music/ben-monder-david-torn.html,"Can a jazz guitarist touch the void? What role can darkness play in improvised music, which has historically been built on a spirit of earnest collaboration and bright, restorative energy? The guitarists Ben Monder and David Torn have been building their musical legacies for over three decades, and both approach those questions in their work. But listen to their latest albums — Mr. Torn’s pummeling, acid-drenched “Sun of Goldfinger,” which came out last month; Mr. Monder’s moody and entrancing double CD, “Day After Day,” due out Friday — and you’ll find two very different ways of answering. Mr. Monder uses only a modest rack of pedals, and his music is elegantly determined and precise. Mr. Torn’s goes the other way: multidirectional, constantly adding conflict to already precarious situations. If Mr. Monder’s music stares into the void, Mr. Torn’s seems as if it’s just been released from it, and is now fleeing in search of safer ground. It’s no coincidence that David Bowie hired both of them, at different stages in his late career, to collaborate: Mr. Torn on his post-9/11 album, “Heathen,” among others; Mr. Monder on “Blackstar,” Bowie’s bleak final masterpiece. Young guitarists seeking fresh approaches and a new hybridity between their instruments and gear are increasingly treating jazz, metal and electronic music as interrelated systems. Mr. Monder’s and Mr. Torn’s separate careers over the past three decades have set the table for Rafiq Bhatia, Anthony Pirog and Ava Mendoza, to name a few. And their work continues to be at least as creatively vital as their younger counterparts’. Since the early 1990s, Mr. Monder, 56, has established a shadowy but unmistakable sound: He plays chords in a low-lit, humming tone or a blurred, finger-plucking wash; usually he wedges one or two misfit notes in the middle of his harmonies, making them sound conflicted. And he has a decisive, slow-handed way of soloing, though you wouldn’t necessarily know it from most of his albums. On records, he usually composes lengthy pieces full of intricate harmonic weaves, with hardly any room for improvisation — a testament to his early infatuations with jazz-rock fusion and classical music. “Day After Day,” however, is different. It’s Mr. Monder’s first collection of covers, and Disc 1 is his first extended foray into solo-guitar recording. The second CD finds him in a trio, playing relatively straightforward renditions of popular songs by Bob Dylan, Burt Bacharach and Fleetwood Mac — and, yes, soloing. On his other albums, he’s so distinctive that it can be hard to pin down any individual big influences. On this album, the importance of the fusion guitarist Ralph Towner and Jim Hall, the master of harmonically rich, 20th-century jazz guitar, becomes clear. Mr. Monder played in two of the most important large ensembles of the 1990s — the Maria Schneider Orchestra and Guillermo Klein y Los Guachos — and developed symbiotic partnerships with figures such as Paul Motian, the fabled drummer, and Theo Bleckmann, a virtuoso vocalist. Last year, he served as the linchpin on Dan Weiss’s well-received project “Starebaby,” an explicit marriage of jazz and metal. Mr. Monder has a print of a small, phosphorescent De Chirico painting on the wall in his practice room at home in south Brooklyn. “There are paintings that seem to convey what I’m trying to sound like,” he said on a recent Saturday morning, considering the image’s metaphysical qualities. His tall frame was coiled up on his stool, and his demeanor was warm but reticent; he ended most statements with a self-effacing joke. He described a recurring dream that he said the painting always reminds him of. “I’m in a room, which is flooded with light, and I’m practicing, and I’m able to play just, anything,” he said. “It’s super inspiring, and I always wake up and I’m like, ‘Where did that go?’” If Mr. Monder’s fantasy is about finding an unobstructed path from idea to execution, Mr. Torn’s is almost the opposite: He likes to surround himself with as much clutter and complication as possible, and figure a way out. In addition to his formidable fleet of pedals and electronics, the 65-year-old musician has built three signal-interrupter buttons into the body of his electric guitar, so that at any moment he can snap himself out of an improvisation’s flow by triggering silence, or a screeching tone, or a sample of something being played by another musician onstage. “I want these things to be random enough that I’m surprised by them,” he said breezily in a recent interview. On “Sun of Goldfinger,” he is joined by the alto saxophonist Tim Berne (a longtime collaborator) and the drummer Ches Smith for two 20-minute-long improvisations. A third, equally long track, “Spartan, Before It Hit,” also features the pianist Craig Taborn and a string quartet, playing a long composition full of saxophone melodies that are sometimes doleful and sometimes strident. Different instruments echo and add friction to each other, and then midway through the performance, the written piece ends and a squall of atonal playing erupts. Eventually it flattens out into near-silence, leading to a long denouement. The album feels like an extension of Mr. Torn’s other recent releases, “Prezens,” with a quartet, and “Only Sky,” his first solo-guitar recording. Both albums were almost entirely improvised then edited afterward. Movement and narrative become secondary to the feeling of being ensconced in sound; your ear is caught in a battle between gravity and weightlessness. Mr. Torn, like Mr. Monder, grew up outside New York City and was inspired by the pyrotechnics of classic rock and fusion. And he too found his way toward a ruminative, personal style. Mr. Torn’s father was a sound engineer who designed stereos, and David grew up thinking not just about music but about sound, as an element with its own dimensions and layers. He had a formative experience at 16, watching Jimi Hendrix play at the Woodstock festival, his guitar soaked in distortion. “That made me rethink everything,” Mr. Torn said. Mr. Torn’s music has always tilted toward the atmospheric, and in the 1990s he started creating film soundtracks. He played on the scores to “The Big Lebowski,” “Traffic” and “A Knight’s Tale,” among others, before starting to compose entire soundtracks himself in the 2000s. It was during this period that he suffered a life-changing brain injury, and lost the ability to hear in one ear. It was a great hardship, but Mr. Torn treated it as just another part of life’s ongoing improvisation. “Life is a continuum in most ways, so an interrupter can be a part of the continuum,” he said, explaining that he had to relearn how to listen to music. “I think my great love of distortion became very fine-tuned.” Performing last month at the Big Ears Festival in Knoxville, Tenn., he played a solo set one day, and with the “Sun of Goldfinger” trio the next. In Mr. Torn’s playing there were elements of Hendrix’s snaky, blues-based improvisations, and elsewhere, the thickness and wide-open empty power of doom metal. Whether he was evading darkness or running straight into it, this music had levels of history built in, and a mind of its own. "
5c2fb3e83a125f5075c02e35,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/arts/music/cornelia-street-cafe-closes.html,"Suzanne Vega sat backstage at the Cornelia Street Café on New Year’s Day, remembering when she had first stepped into it almost four decades ago. She was 20, an undiscovered talent, and it was a Monday night. She had come to try out material on the young troubadours and folk-revival survivors who attended the weekly Songwriters Exchange there. The cafe had sprung up in 1977 on a little side street in Greenwich Village, where foot traffic overtakes the asphalt in summer, and the arched doorways give the block a European feel. The club quickly became an heir apparent to the Village’s old coffeehouses, which were peopled by poets and folk songsters in the 1950s and ’60s. But Vega didn’t remember it as a nostalgic place. “We felt ourselves to be modern and of the moment,” she said. If you wanted to perform at the Songwriters Exchange, it had to be your own music. “It had to be current stuff,” she added. These have been constants at the club over nearly 42 years: an aura of inheritance and an ethic of freewheeling invention. But its history is coming to an end. As she spoke, Vega had just finished playing as part of the space’s farewell show, in which dozens of musicians, comedians, actors and poets took turns giving their final performances. The tiny basement can hold about 80, but that night it was packed well beyond capacity. After that marathon concert, which ran from 3 p.m. into the wee hours, one of the Village’s most creatively eclectic spots closed its doors for the last time. The cafe’s owner, the writer Robin Hirsch, who started it along with two other artists, is shutting down reluctantly in the face of soaring real estate costs. The restaurant upstairs has continued to thrive, and he has had no trouble booking more than 700 shows a year in the basement. But the monthly rent, $33,000, is now 77 times what it was when the cafe began, he said, and he cannot make ends meet. Cornelia Street Café’s demise is more than the disappearance of a gleaming old dot on New York’s cultural map. The cafe picked up on the coffeehouses’ legacy, certainly, but it expanded beyond that, particularly after a reading in the mid-1980s by Eugene J. McCarthy, the former Democratic senator from Minnesota, a lion of the political left and, as cafegoers found out, a sometime poet. That event led Hirsch to clear out the basement and move the performance space downstairs. Since then, the basement has been home to Off Off Broadway shows (Eve Ensler read “The Vagina Monologues” there for the first time in the mid-1990s), stand-up comedy, burlesque and a dizzying range of music. It was one of an increasingly rare breed of spaces that welcomed performers of many stripes, united only by an affinity for the offbeat. Arturo O’Farrill, the devilishly innovative pianist and leader of the Afro-Latin Jazz Orchestra, performed with his musician sons at the farewell show. Reflecting on the importance of the club — where he held a weekly residency in the mid-2000s — he mentioned its openness to improvisers of all sorts.  “There’s a conduit for fringy jazz, and there’s a conduit for conservo-jazz,” he said. “There’s almost no conduit for people who straddle both worlds, which I’ve always found really problematic.” Asked what other locations might fill the void, he threw out a few names in the other boroughs (Bar Lunático and iBeam in Brooklyn, Terraza 7 in Queens), but acknowledged that none were small clubs dedicated to close listening and communion, in the way of Cornelia Street Café. A few weeks before, Cornelia Street had hosted Aaron Burnett and the Big Machine, a band playing sharply cut postbop with a loose, insurgent energy. It was celebrating the release of a new album, “Anomaly.” In the audience, Esperanza Spalding chatted animatedly between songs with the pianist Michele Rosewoman. Last Sunday was the club’s last bona fide jazz set. A crowd that included music journalists, indie-label executives and poets had lined up outside the door to hear the Tom Rainey Trio. Rainey’s trio — with Mary Halvorson on guitar and Ingrid Laubrock on tenor saxophone — had made the cafe its creative home over the past decade, performing there intermittently and honing a rapport that has so far resulted in three impressive albums. Like many of the cafe’s regular bands, it has a sound that’s hard to pin down, adhering to a tuneful but open-form style of its own. Over the course of an hour on Sunday, Halvorson’s paint-splattered distortion and Laubrock’s spare melodies — sometimes coolly linear, sometimes sharply splintered — felt constantly lifted by Rainey’s rambling, buoyant drums. Throughout the narrow basement, where cellphone signals don’t reach and the soft glow of colored Christmas lights filled the room, the audience leaned in close to hear every last note. "
5cb066b549f0eacbf1f8349d,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/12/movies/guava-island-movie.html,"When Donald Glover and the director Hiro Murai collaborate on a new project, expectations are naturally sky high. After all, Murai has directed many of the key episodes of Glover’s Emmy-winning series, “Atlanta,” as well as the music video for “This Is America,” the Grammy-winning song Glover recorded as his musical alter ego, Childish Gambino. But with their first feature-length effort, “Guava Island,” you had the sense that Glover and Murai were trying to play down those expectations. The film, which comes in at a brisk 54 minutes, was shot in Cuba last year and kept under wraps until this week. That isn’t easy to do when your star is so famous and his love interest is played by Rihanna. [“Guava Island” was released after Donald Glover’s Coachella set as Childish Gambino.] And though any film festival in the world would have coveted Murai’s first feature, “Guava Island” instead debuted Thursday night at the Coachella campgrounds in California, where Glover will headline the site’s music festival as Childish Gambino. Shortly after his set concludes on Friday night, the film is to begin streaming on Amazon, starting Saturday at 12:01 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time. So what is this mystery project about? “Guava Island” is a music-driven fable that follows Deni (Glover), a happy-go-lucky singer who believes that music has the power to unite the squabbling citizens of his tiny island. He promises his girlfriend, Kofi (Rihanna), that he can write a song as beautiful as she is, though Kofi is skeptical. “No song is that beautiful,” she boasts. (Letitia Wright, a.k.a. Shuri in “Black Panther,” also appears, but she doesn’t have many lines.) The plot is slight: A shady island tycoon named Red (Nonso Anozie) tries to prevent Deni from putting on a music festival, reasoning that if people go see the young man perform that night, they’re liable to skip work at Red’s sweatshops the next day. And though Rihanna doesn’t have much to do as Glover’s girlfriend, the two at least share a spiky chemistry: Glover is eager to please, while Rihanna remains ever hard to impress. [Read the NYT review of “Guava Island.”] But the main attraction here is something that had been kept secret until Thursday night’s screening: Glover uses “Guava Island” to restage and remix some of his biggest recent songs. “America is a concept,” Deni tells his fellow workers before leading them in a rendition of “This Is America” that finds new context for many of the video’s familiar, unsettling dance moves. Other musical sequences are set to Childish Gambino songs like “Saturday” and “Summertime Magic,” which is repurposed as a beachside serenade for Rihanna. (Alas, she is a mere spectator instead of Glover’s duet partner.) Glover has said that “Guava Island” was inspired by films as disparate as “Purple Rain” and “City of God,” though it also shares a restless creative ambition with recent visual albums from Janelle Monáe and Beyoncé. Monáe will perform just before Glover on the Coachella stage Friday night, while Beyoncé dominated the festival last year with a career-spanning performance captured for her coming Netflix documentary “Homecoming.” For top-tier artists looking to make a grand statement, there remains no place like Coachella. But as “Guava Island” shows, sometimes you can say just as much about your intentions by springing a sly surprise on the way. "

The award, which comes with $50,000 and the opportunity to headline a starry celebratory gala at Carnegie Hall on Oct. 27, is among the most sought-after prizes for young American opera singers. Many of its past recipients have gone on to stardom. Ms. Oropesa, 35, is one of the few opera singers who have been featured in both Opera News and Runner’s World, which reported on her 2015 feat of running the Pittsburgh Marathon the morning after starring in a production of Donizetti’s “La Fille du Régiment.” The article noted that “her standing-ovation-to-marathon-time was just over 13 hours.” She has had recent successes in both famous bel canto roles and Meyerbeer rarities. When she sang the role of Marguerite de Valois in Meyerbeer’s “Les Huguenots” at the Opéra National de Paris last fall, Zachary Woolfe wrote in The New York Times that Ms. Oropesa “sounded lucid and silky, radiating good intentions.” Listen for yourself: Born in New Orleans to parents from Cuba, Ms. Oropesa played the flute as a child and studied vocal performance at Louisiana State University. She trained in the Metropolitan Opera’s young artists program and sang her first big role there, Susanna in Mozart’s “Le Nozze di Figaro,” when she was just 22. She has appeared at the Met more than 100 times and will return next season to star in Massenet’s “Manon” and Verdi’s “La Traviata.” Previous winners of the Tucker Award include Renée Fleming, Lawrence Brownlee, Christine Goerke, Joyce DiDonato, Michael Fabiano and Jamie Barton.

But there were literal brass instruments, bells up and held high, at the official opening of the Shed on Friday night. The first public performance — inside the cavernous McCourt space at the new arts center, one of the most ambitious and high-profile additions to New York City’s cultural landscape in years — began with a marching band exuberantly parading through the audience. It was the start of Soundtrack of America, a five-concert series paying homage to the history of African-American music, conceived by the filmmaker and artist Steve McQueen. He and Quincy Jones watched from the sidelines as the instrumentalists made their joyous entrance. Nearby was Alex Poots, the Shed’s artistic director and chief executive, pacing on the periphery. He was witnessing not only the inauguration of an institution more than a decade (and $475 million) in the making, but also of the programming he has been developing since he joined in 2014. [Read more about the Shed’s development.] For the Shed’s first weekend, he had commissioned “Soundtrack for America,” as well as the interdisciplinary “Reich Richter Pärt,” new work by the artist Trisha Donnelly and the play “Norma Jeane Baker of Troy,” starring Ben Whishaw and Renée Fleming. On Wednesday evening, the Shed had opened its doors to mostly donors and industry insiders for a preview party. Mr. Poots and Elizabeth Diller — the architect whose firm, Diller Scofidio + Renfro, designed the building in collaboration with the Rockwell Group — were tapped on the shoulders by a near-constant stream of luminaries offering congratulations. It was a long day for Ms. Diller, who arrived at the building around 8 a.m. and stayed at the party until 10:30 p.m. (To unwind, she said, she and her husband, Ricardo Scofidio, went out for ramen. She was back at her office by 9 a.m.) There was a preview of “Reich Richter Pärt”; afterward, Steve Reich said in an interview that he was happy to finally hear his score with a large crowd, and not in the acoustics of an empty room. He was there again for the piece’s first public performances on Saturday. [Our guide to navigating the Shed and Hudson Yards.] By the weekend, the building was operational, though not fully finished. One crucial escalator wasn’t completely installed; another was in and out of service. A bartender for Cedric’s, the Shed’s not-yet-open restaurant by Danny Meyer’s Union Square Hospitality Group, apologetically handed out free bottles of water and said that it would probably be up and running by late April. But that didn’t stop thousands of visitors from passing through. “Reich Richter Pärt” drew a solemnly attentive audience. “Norma Jeane Baker of Troy” had a full house for its premiere. (A review of that is coming this week.) Part of Trisha Donnelly’s show was treated as an observation gallery; one man asked a Shed employee where the exhibition was, not knowing he was standing in the middle of it. What did our critics think of the opening weekend? Here are their reviews. JOSHUA BARONE Critic’s Pick Through April 14 in the McCourt.  Thundering syncopation and a parade through the audience opened the first part of Soundtrack of America, a five-concert survey of African-American music. The McCourt was configured as a club, with a plywood stage, a dance floor, a D.J. and a seated aerie. Jon Batiste was leading the Howard University “Showtime” Marching Band, the Brooklyn United drumline and his own 369th Experience brass band. Their set commemorated James Reese Europe, a pioneer in bringing African-American music to concert halls — including Carnegie Hall in 1912 — and recordings. During World War I, he served in the segregated 369th Infantry Regiment, known as the Harlem Hellfighters, and directed its regimental band, which introduced ragtime across Europe. Mr. Batiste’s 369th Experience musicians wore military khakis. The roar of massed drums turned into W.C. Handy’s “Memphis Blues,” a Hellfighters favorite. Mr. Batiste paired ragtime tunes with his own “Golden Crown,” rooted in the Mardi Gras Indian music of his hometown, New Orleans. He declared, “We summoning the ancestors tonight!” That’s the mission of Soundtrack of America, conceived by Steve McQueen as a joyful history lesson and advised by Quincy Jones and others. Dedicated to continuity and cultural memory, each concert features five musicians performing songs that inspired them, alongside their own music. Friday’s lineup included performers and songwriters (PJ Morton, Victory, Rapsody and Sheléa) backed by the keyboardist Greg Phillinganes leading a supremely adaptable band. They chose more recent, more familiar musical ancestors — less history, more hits — and were willing to risk having their songs compared with the pantheon. Mr. Morton, a keyboardist in Maroon 5, invoked both the two-fisted New Orleans piano tradition and Stevie Wonder, putting gospel flourishes into the Fats Domino hit “Blueberry Hill” and barreling through Mr. Wonder’s “Higher Ground” on the way to his own ballad, “First Began,” full of Wonder-like chord changes and vocal turns. With her burnished, supple alto, Victory started “Feeling Good,” a Nina Simone showpiece, as a bluesy reflection, then shifted it toward the Caribbean lilt of her own songs calling for self-acceptance. Rapsody, a rapper from North Carolina, emphasized women’s power and self-determination. She declaimed her rhymes with decisive, leaping inflections, linking her material to Nina Simone, Queen Latifah, Lauryn Hill, Roberta Flack and (joined by Victory singing “Strange Fruit”) Billie Holiday. Sheléa juxtaposed her elegantly retro jazz ballad “Love Fell on Me” with crowd-pleasing homages to Sarah Vaughan, Whitney Houston and Aretha Franklin. Mr. Phillinganes and the band added their renditions of songs by Ray Charles, James Brown and Thelonious Monk. On the way out, concertgoers received a poster-size family tree tracing 400 years of interconnected African-American music. For all the major figures that its opening night touched on, Soundtrack of America has plenty of pantheon left. JON PARELES Through June 2 in the Level 2 Gallery. A few minutes after the audience has entered the first of two gallery spaces that make up “Reich Richter Pärt,” chanting begins. It turns out the singers, dressed in street clothes, have been embedded among us — a tired trick of contemporary performance. Members of the Choir of Trinity Wall Street sing, and repeat three times, “Drei Hirtenkinder aus Fátima,” a spirited piece in Arvo Pärt’s neo-Medieval style. When this collaboration between Pärt and the artist Gerhard Richter was new, in England in 2015, “Drei Hirtenkinder” was heard among Richter’s somber “Double Gray” diptychs and “Birkenau,” a series of abstractions concealing photographs of concentration-camp prisoners. Perhaps a little heavy for the Shed’s opening festivities?  Now, amid the cheerful commerce of Hudson Yards, the only history being reflected upon is that of the artists’ collaboration itself. “The History of ‘Reich Richter Pärt,’” the program screams in inch-high capital letters, endowing with epochal import a 50-minute interplay among three octogenarian cultural celebrities. No more concentration camps. The art, lit with reverential spots, is tall columns of wallpaper and a few rectangles of tapestry. The space is perhaps meant to evoke a cathedral: A text claims these Richters “emulate stained glass.” The adjacent room is wrapped in more wallpaper: panoramic pieces printed with the final stage of Richter’s “Patterns,” a 2012 book project that halved and mirrored an earlier abstract painting, over and over, into ever-thinner strips that eventually resolve into long, horizontal bands of color. A film, by Mr. Richter and Corinna Belz, depicts the “Patterns” process, then its reversal, to the live accompaniment of a new score by Steve Reich, played on Saturday by Ensemble Signal, that also undergoes a symmetrical process-based transformation. (The International Contemporary Ensemble will fill in for some performances in the eight-week, four-times-daily run; the Brooklyn Youth Chorus similarly shares the workload for the Pärt.) A two-note motif builds to complex, rhythmically agile brightness, then gradually recedes back into blur as we watch Richter’s bands seem to rush by at light speed, fervently oscillating, at the finale. The music has tender energy, and an undercurrent of melancholy. Its droning tones sometimes seem to be pulling apart — like taffy, or like Richter’s stretching spaghetti stripes of color. The film, by contrast, feels merely self-fascinated. But two masters have been brought together, furthering the reputation of each; in the collaboration-consumed, eminence-obsessed ethos of high-end art-making these days, that’s all that matters. ZACHARY WOOLFE Through May 30 in the Level 4 Gallery.  In choosing the American artist Trisha Donnelly for the Shed’s first solo exhibition, the curators here opted for a tactician and a troublemaker — one whose terse, enigmatic maneuvers stand far from the sparkle and retail of Hudson Yards.  Ms. Donnelly’s page in the Shed’s brochure for its first season is blank. Her show, alone among the inaugural offerings, is not signposted beside the half-finished escalators. And she has bridled against the building’s architecture, forcing spectators through the side entrance of the new gallery into a half-lit space that some will confuse for the back of house.  You wanted an artist who’d push the boundaries of the new institution? Be careful what you ask for. Inscrutability, provisionality, self-effacement: These are the contrivances of Ms. Donnelly, whose untitled exhibition is the only project here that puts the Shed itself in question. In the dim gallery you will see segments of two massive tree trunks, a redwood and a pine, lying like cadavers on simple dollies. Water puddles beneath them (these trees, though blasted, are still alive), and their amputated branches have been dressed with white plastic foam bundles that appear like tourniquets. Dozens of smaller branches, many also bandaged, balance in a corner. A sound system positioned on a dolly as its own sculpture roars a single aria on loop: the Habanera from “Carmen,” sung by Leontyne Price and rattling the speakers. The blaring Bizet, extolling love as “the child of the bohemian,” and the bandaged trees, recalling mutilated soldiers, suggest joys and pains that have no place in Hudson Yards. Yet how these elements inform one another, as easy opposites of nature and culture or of life and death, is less important than whether they together can conjure an atmosphere of whispers, diversions, mistakes, vanishings. When the art world was smaller, Ms. Donnelly’s evanescent, undocumented interventions — most famously, a 2002 performance in which she rode into a gallery on horseback, proclaimed a military surrender, then galloped back out — had the thrill of a runaway rumor. Today, when every exhibition is Instagrammed and hashtagged, that effect has become almost impossible to realize, which Ms. Donnelly has surely acknowledged by leaving a narrow gap in the wall built to block the windows. At the hour I visited, the light passing through it cast a faint camera-obscura gleam of the soon-to-open Equinox Hotel. This artist’s resistance to marketing, and her scrupulous refusal to kludge up her art with paratext, come as salutary aberrations amid all the Hudson Yards hype. But Ms. Donnelly seems to have already accepted that the cultural world we have built over the train tracks may not have space for art like hers. JASON FARAGO "
5c532ed93a125f5075c0756f,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/arts/music/michael-jackson-leaving-neverland-accusations.html,"Michael Jackson was quite possibly the most famous entertainer of the 20th century. When he died in June 2009, it seemed like the long-boiling national conversation around the multiple allegations of child molestation against him died, too; the focus instead shifted to his planned This Is It comeback concerts, his unreleased songs and a musical legacy that includes hundred of millions of albums sold. But on Jan. 25, the Sundance Film Festival debuted the four-hour documentary “Leaving Neverland,” which details accusations of abuse, almost instantly reopening the discussion on one of the most notorious scandals in music history. (The film airs in two parts on HBO March 3 and 4.) If you didn’t know why Jackson is leading the news cycle nearly 10 years after his death, here’s a brief explainer. [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] “Leaving Neverland” is a two-part mini-series focusing on the allegations of two men who say Michael Jackson abused them as children. It’s directed by the British documentarian Dan Reed, who directed the 2016 HBO doc “Three Days of Terror: The Charlie Hebdo Attacks.” Wade Robson, a choreographer who has worked with Britney Spears, and James Safechuck, a computer programmer who appeared in commercials as a child actor, said they met Jackson when they were 7 and 10, and assert that he molested them for years. Robson and Safechuck (who appeared alongside Jackson in a memorable 1987 Pepsi commercial) detail allegations like mutual masturbation, oral and anal sexual acts, alcohol, lavish gifts and pornography. Robson, who says Jackson nicknamed him “Little One,” describes what he says was the singer’s methods to keep him from speaking out. Safechuck talks about a secret “wedding” he had with Jackson, and the ring he still has in his possession, saying Jackson gave him jewelry in exchange for sexual favors. Both men supported Jackson during a 2005 trial for molestation and denied he had abused them. However Robson and Safechuck both sued Jackson’s estate after the star’s death. Robson said Jackson molested him for seven years, and Safechuck said he and Jackson engaged in sexual acts “hundreds” of times. Both cases were dismissed and are under appeal.. At the Sundance screening, Rolling Stone reported, “By the end of the screening, the crowd looked completely shellshocked,” adding, “It was hard not to feel like a bombshell had been dropped.” The Guardian reported that, “After the film ended, an ashen-faced crowd rose to their feet to applaud Wade and James, who arrived on stage, both visibly moved by the response.” [See a timeline of the accusations Michael Jackson faced.] The family released a statement that called the documentary a “public lynching.” “We are furious that the media, who without a shred of proof or single piece of physical evidence, chose to believe the word of two admitted liars over the word of hundreds of families and friends around the world who spent time with Michael, many at Neverland, and experienced his legendary kindness and global generosity,” the statement reads. “The creators of this film were not interested in the truth. They never interviewed a single solitary soul who knew Michael except the two perjurers and their families.” Jermaine Jackson, Michael’s older brother and former bandmate in the Jackson 5, appeared on “Good Morning Britain” and called the allegations “nonsense” while defending Jackson’s practice of sleeping in bed with children. “Those were slumber parties. And what they didn’t tell you was there were little girls there, even with their parents, their uncles. And they were sitting down, watching movies,” Jermaine Jackson said. Yes. In 1993, the family of a 13-year-old boy filed a $30 million lawsuit saying Jackson sexually abused their son, including allegations of kissing, fondling and oral sex. The suit was settled out of court in 1994 for around $23 million. A cancer survivor who appeared by Jackson’s side in the Martin Bashir television documentary “Living With Michael Jackson” was 14 when authorities formally charged Jackson with molesting him. During the 14-week criminal trial in 2005, the boy’s younger brother said that Jackson showed them pornography, masturbated in front of them, served them alcohol and molested his brother on two occasions. Jackson was found not guilty. “Don’t Stop ’Til You Get Enough,” a musical based on the years leading up to Jackson’s 1992 Dangerous tour, was expected to start in late October in Chicago with an aim to hit Broadway in 2020; in February, the planned Chicago tryout was canceled due to what the producers called “scheduling difficulties” caused by a labor dispute. The show is produced by the Michael Jackson Estate and Columbia Live Stage, and features a book written by the two-time Pulitzer winner Lynn Nottage. "
5cb0f75949f0eacbf1f8388a,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/12/obituaries/sam-pilafian-dead.html,"Sam Pilafian, a virtuoso tuba player who performed an eclectic mix of classical, jazz, pop and rock music and brought unflagging exuberance to teaching young tubists, died on April 5 at his home in Tempe, Ariz. He was 69. His wife, Diann (Jezurski) Pilafian, said the cause was colon cancer. As a busy soloist, a founding member of the influential Empire Brass quintet and a partner to the acoustic guitarist Frank Vignola in the jazz group Travelin’ Light, Mr. Pilafian expanded the musical possibilities of his lumbering instrument. “He’s easily the best tuba player I’ve ever played with,” the trumpeter Charles Lewis, another original member of Empire Brass, said by telephone. “He could do everything — play all kinds of music — and he could light up a room.” Mr. Pilafian, a natural entertainer, was once nicknamed the Evel Knievel of the Tuba for daringly playing “The Clarinet Polka” while standing on his head. He also tried teaching the tuba to Fred Rogers on an episode of “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood” in 1985. “You have to blow through buzzing lips,” Mr. Pilafian told Mr. Rogers. After creating a sound, Mr. Rogers said, “Your lips tickle.” Mr. Pilafian tickled his lips during more than 40 years of diverse collaborations. He played with the singers Bernadette Peters and Barbara Cook; the Duke Ellington and Lionel Hampton orchestras; the ensemble on the Philip Glass album “Koyaanisqatsi” (1982); the New York Philharmonic and the Boston Symphony Orchestra, as a substitute or soloist; and Pink Floyd, on the 1979 album “The Wall.” “I did a lot of studio work back then,” Mr. Pilafian told The St. Louis Post-Dispatch in 1990, discussing his work on “The Wall.” “I had always studied jazz, so when I got to New York, I just ended up doing a lot of rock ’n’ roll.” Recalling his work with the trumpeter Lew Soloff and the trombonist James Pugh, he added, “When they combined our sound, they sweetened it so my tuba actually sounds more like a French horn on the album.” But Mr. Pilafian is best known for his work with Empire Brass, whose repertoire includes Renaissance and Baroque music, transcriptions of classical works, show tunes, Christmas songs and pieces composed for the quintet. It has released more than two dozen recordings. Empire Brass embraces the classic brass quintet configuration — a pair of trumpets, French horn, trombone and tuba — and has long been known for its virtuosity and showmanship. “You have not often heard an ensemble that played with more gusto than this one,” the New York Times music critic Donal Henahan wrote of an Empire recital in 1977. “Individual notes were hit in the center and chords were blended with the transparency that comes from exact corporate intonation. Phrases, even at dashing tempos, were lyrical and supple. Balances were perfectly achieved without any obtrusive effort.” Mr. Vignola recalled being a guest artist at a recording session with Empire Brass in the early 1990s when the producer asked him to make a jazz record with Mr. Pilafian. “Travelin’ Light,” the first of several albums they made, helped start them off as a touring duo. “Who would have thought, a jazz tuba and an acoustic guitar?” Mr. Vignola said in a telephone interview from Sweden, where he was performing. “We were an odd couple, but our act went over. Sam was a great entertainer and, like Louis Armstrong, broke all the rules.” James Samuel Pilafian was born on Oct. 25, 1949, in Miami. His father, James, was a lawyer, and his mother, Rosa (Boyajian) Pilafian, known as Shocky, was a paralegal in her husband’s firm and managed their commercial properties. Sam played the accordion as a youngster. But he switched instruments at 11 on the advice of a veteran tubist, who told him that if he played tuba he would always have friends. He was a quick study and within a few years had joined the musicians union and was playing in hotel orchestras that backed headliners like Frank Sinatra and Liza Minnelli, and in a six-piece Dixieland band that performed at racetracks and other places around Miami. While attending what is now the Frost School of Music at the University of Miami, where he earned a bachelor’s degree, he had a summer fellowship at the Tanglewood Music Center for advanced music training in Lenox, Mass. His tuba playing impressed Leonard Bernstein, who was an adviser there, and who enlisted him in the orchestra for the premiere of his theatrical work “Mass” at the opening of the Kennedy Center in Washington in 1971. Tanglewood was also the birthplace of Empire Brass. Michael Tilson Thomas, the music director of the San Francisco Symphony, was then a conducting student at Tanglewood. He told Bernstein that the five brass instrumentalists “should begin playing together because we sound alike, although we had never met,” Mr. Pilafian told The Post-Dispatch. “So we did,” he added, “and we became a rehearsal band, getting together just to rehearse.” He remained with the group for 22 years, leaving in 1993. Mr. Pilafian, whose tuba mentors included Arnold Jacobs, the longtime former principal tubist of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, was also a teacher for many years. He held positions at Boston University, Berklee College of Music, the Tanglewood Institute, Arizona State University and the Frost School. He and a fellow tubist, Patrick Sheridan, developed a series of exercises adapted from martial arts and yoga to help singers and wind and brass players breathe more effectively. “My teaching philosophy has always been predicated on catching students doing something right,” he told the magazine The Brass Herald  in 2013. The tubist Andrew Hitz recalled being a shy 14-year-old at Tanglewood in the summer of 1990 when Mr. Pilafian eased his fears. “I could play as well as anybody, but I was scared and in tears,” Mr. Hitz said by telephone. “But Sam was able with me, and countless others, to insulate us from criticism and make us feel you were safe, while challenging the hell out of you. The gift he gave me is that I never again questioned whether I belonged with any musicians.” In addition to his wife, Mr. Pilafian is survived by his sons, Alexander Sarkis Pilafian and Zev Levin-Pilafian, and his sisters, Marni Pilafian and Nerisa Gay Pilafian. When Mr. Pilafian was in college, he was determined to do whatever was necessary to elevate his musicianship. So he tried an experiment with a friend, Mike Gerber, a blind pianist, he told NDSU Magazine in 2017, when he was a visiting artist at North Dakota State University. Fascinated by Mr. Gerber’s heightened sense of hearing, Mr. Pilafian bandaged his own eyes. He was disoriented that first day but felt that his hearing had noticeably improved after three days. On Day 4, he concluded that his listening had grown dramatically acute, and he could play back whatever Mr. Gerber played on the piano. “Nothing was the same after that,” he said. "
5c351f133a125f5075c036b7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/08/t-magazine/steve-gunn-sachiko-kanenobu.html,"The American musician Steve Gunn first heard of Sachiko Kanenobu a few years ago, when, at the advice of friends, he listened to her debut album “Misora,” recorded in Tokyo in 1972. Gunn, 41, is best known for his neo-folk guitar playing (and as a former member of Kurt Vile’s backing band, the Violators) and has more recently moved into producing albums for like-minded artists. He was instantly taken with Kanenobu’s lush guitar playing and multilayered psychedelic melodies, joining the singer-songwriter’s small but devoted fan base. Born in Osaka in 1948, Kanenobu started to garner attention in her late teens within her country’s burgeoning folk scene. But the year of her album’s release — and before her fame took hold — she quietly moved to New York City with Paul Williams, the music journalist and founder of Crawdaddy magazine, to start a family. Now based in California, she makes music on and off, both solo and with groups, returning periodically to Japan to perform. In 2017, Gunn rediscovered Kanenobu by chance when he heard an interview with her on WFMU radio in New York City, where he’s based; ultimately, a mutual friend connected the two musicians and a creative relationship flourished by text message. Next month, Kanenobu will perform songs from “Misora” for the first time in the States, opening a handful of Gunn’s tour dates tied to the release of his upcoming album, “The Unseen in Between.” Written in the wake of his father’s passing, the songs are sweeping, with intricate finger picking and rich instrumentation, the lyrics meditative and intimate. Gunn also pushed for the reissue of “Misora,” which is slated for next year.  Ahead of all of this, the pair sat down at the kitchen table in Kanenobu’s home in Northern California to discuss their origins, the writing process and their varied inspirations. Steve Gunn: Sachiko, you just came back from Japan. Sachiko Kanenobu: Yes, it was a very special performance. I performed my “Misora” album in Japan, and I’ve never played that album before in public — and it’s 46 years after it was released. I went back to do this concert. It sold out the same month it was announced. I thought, “Wow there are going to be lots of gray-haired people,” but there were so many young people. I was shocked. To me, it’s like I rose from death, like they are seeing a ghost or something. [Laughs] I’m so excited to perform from that album with you — it’s one of my dreams. You really inspired me to play my guitar again. Each time before I play now, I put on your YouTube videos. Your music is just so calm. I’m 70 years old now, and I need that calm energy. Gunn: I do, too, it’s a big part of my music. Kanenobu: You also have a kind of psychedelic quality. That’s what really got me, because I grew up with that type of music, like the Beatles and such. I’ve been in California since 1976, and I lived in New York before that. I got there in 1972. Gunn: You were so steeped in music because of your relationship with Paul Williams. Kanenobu: Paul brought Bruce Springsteen to come see us in New York — it was very early on. He sang two songs for us with an acoustic guitar, that’s an amazing memory. Also, I met Bob Dylan — much later, though, when I was living in California. It was at a ball field in San Francisco, around 1980. Gunn: Had he known Paul? Kanenobu: Yes — and it was a very special concert because Bob Dylan was like a born-again Christian. He had these wonderful backup singers. However, the audience didn’t like it. It was terrible. They booed him. Paul and I went to see him at the end and we talked. I said, “Why do people do that?” And Bob Dylan said, “Change your style and they don’t like it.” Gunn: When I had met you in Sonoma last year and we were kind of becoming friends — and I started talking to you about this label, Light in the Attic, which is going to reissue “Misora” — I told my record-nerd friends that we hung out. And they were like, “Wait, what?” No one really believed me. I don’t think a lot of people knew that you were living in California or in the States. Kanenobu: In 1972, when I first moved to New York, I wasn’t making music because I had two babies, you know. I was mostly taking care of the kids. But Paul played music all the time and I was getting into that. Gunn: When did you start writing music again? Kanenobu: Really when I met Philip K. Dick. He changed my life and got me to play music again. Paul took me to meet Phil when he was living in Sonoma with his girlfriend. He asked, “Are you still writing songs?” I said, “No, I’m very busy, you know?” And he said, “You shouldn’t stop writing, you have a gift.” He made my eyes all jumbly. I was so touched, and felt so deeply. He really illuminated my heart and soul. T: Is it true he started producing one of your records before he died? Kanenobu: He did. He did one single record, “Fork in the Road / Tokyo Song.” At one point, Paul and I drove all the way to see Phil in Santa Ana, where he lived and brought him an older record of mine — he had this big fancy player — but when we tried to put it on, it didn’t work. Phil was really angry. He said, “I’m going to throw this whole system out the window,” and he really started picking it up, but we stopped him. Later, we played him the album and he loved it.  I wrote some new English songs after Phil had told me I should, instead of in Japanese. He started talking about making an album together — he would produce it and he’d be in the studio this time. That was 1982, around February. I was so excited, and then he died in March. It was so sad, the darkest time in my life. He was like my muse. He always called me and encouraged me and read me short stories and made me laugh. I am actually writing a book about the whole thing.  Steve, what was it like working on your new album? Gunn: Well, my producer, James Elkington, is someone that I’ve been playing music with for a bunch of years now, he and I became fast friends. I met him on the road. He’s from England and lived in London in the ’80s, so he’s kind of steeped in this English punk tradition, but he also knows a lot about the folk traditions from England. I’m a pretty idiosyncratic player, and I’ve got my own kind of self-taught style. I think if I was thrown into certain situations people might not really understand where I’m coming from. Jim really understood, he knew exactly what I wanted to do with the album, which was basically record it like the albums that I admire from the ’60s and ’70s, where you kind of hear the band playing live. I wanted this sort of live spontaneity to it. We also had the bassist Tony Garnier — he plays with Bob Dylan — and Daniel Schlett, the owner of the studio. We’re all sort of Dylan fanatics. Kanenobu: Steve, what inspires you? Gunn: I studied art history in college, and when I ended up moving to New York, I worked at a lot of art galleries and was kind of an art handler — I ended up moving a ton of artists’ works and in the process became educated in a lot of minimal artists from the ’60s. Some of them were very interested in music and also were musicians themselves. And a lot of their philosophies correlated with some of the things that I was exploring. Kanenobu: When I was in high school, I used to listen to this album by Donovan, and I actually tried to imitate him. [Laughs] Gunn: Do you remember what album? Kanenobu: The first one, I think. I tried copying it, but it was so difficult, and so I just created my songs out of attempting to play like that. In Japan around 1967, it was all folk and pop music — Peter, Paul and Mary, Pete Seeger, bands like that. Later, I got into the Okinawa scale, which is a unique scale, and not very Japanese in style. And then Takashi Nishioka from the band Five Red Balloons said, “Why don’t you come over and listen to this record? Don’t you feel like it’s kind of what you’re doing?” And it was Joni Mitchell. Then I got influenced by Bob Dylan, of course — I love his words. I started reading his song book and it was kind of like my bible. I also got into the group Pentangle. Gunn: Another favorite of mine. Kanenobu: I got into the guitar, more than the singing. I’m still not a great singer. Gunn: For me, I didn’t sing until later. At first, I was practicing guitar and learning different things and improvising. I got really into playing long-form meditative-style pieces. Also classical Indian music was influential to me. I was trying to figure out how to use that influence and I knew that people in the ’60s used that style, particularly a guitar player named Sandy Bull. When I heard his piece called “Blend,” I kind of emulated that for a number of years and was playing with different kinds of open tunings. T: Are you currently working on new music? Kanenobu: Yes, I’m working on new songs and it’s so exciting because, you know, I thought, “Wow, I’m dead.” Gunn: When “Misora” came out, did you play any shows, or did it just come out and you had already moved on from that? Kanenobu: I’d been playing for a few years before that came out. It’s interesting with that album because everyone said, “Oh, it’s a woman.” You know, back then, there were no women singing with an acoustic guitar. I remember in particular a performance I did in Germany in the late ’80s with my band Culture Shock. I can’t describe it, it was really amazing — everybody was one. I said “I love you” and everyone in the room said back, “I love you.” [Laughs] To me, when you play, it’s very important to give people goodness. Gunn: What’s also interesting for me, with your story, is all of the connections you’ve made throughout your life and how music particularly played a role in it. You can link these experiences because you picked up a guitar when you were a teenager. Kanenobu: If you’re curious and love something, when you get into it and express yourself, that’s what life is about. This interview has been edited and condensed. "

This week, the number is 823 — along with 83 million streams, that is. Those are the numbers for “Hoodie SZN” (Highbridge/Atlantic), by the New York rapper A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie, the latest and most extreme example of the disparity that now exists in the music industry between the still-rapid growth of streaming and the cratering business of old-fashioned album sales. Billboard and Nielsen credit “Hoodie SZN” with the equivalent of 58,000 sales in the United States last week, a number that incorporates streams and downloads of individual tracks, as well as sales of the full album. But the vast majority of that composite number is from streaming — so much so that the sales number represents a new low on the chart. The 823 copies of “Hoodie SZN” that were sold last week — all as downloads, since that title has not been released on any physical formats — is the least number of copies that any album has sold in the week it went to No. 1. It tops a record set just the week before by 21 Savage’s “I Am > I Was,” which sold 3,481 copies and had 84 million streams. These numbers reflect a business that has become so dominated by streaming that CD sales are all but disappearing, except with a handful of superstars like Taylor Swift and Adele, or when they are bundled with concert tickets. The Recording Industry Association of America reported that for the first half of 2018 (the most recent figures it has published), streaming represented 75 percent of all retail sales revenue in the United States, while physical formats were just 10 percent. During those six months, only 18.6 million CDs were sold in the United States, a decline of 47 percent from the first half of 2017. Before Billboard began to incorporate streaming numbers in its album chart, in 2014, the lowest sales number for a No. 1 album was 40,478, set by Amos Lee’s “Mission Bell” in February 2011. The rest of this week’s Top 10 is, for the most part, just slightly reshuffled from the week before. 21 Savage’s “I Am > I Was” fell to No. 2, the “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse” soundtrack is No. 3, Meek Mill’s “Championships” is No. 4, and Post Malone’s “Beerbongs & Bentleys” is in fifth place. After the Queen biopic “Bohemian Rhapsody” won best drama at the Golden Globes, Queen’s “Platinum Collection” rose 127 spots to No. 10. "
5c65d6353a125f5075c09c6e,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/arts/children-and-the-arts-conversation.html,"On a recent evening, three arts writers spoke about the joys and terrors of introducing their children to the profusion of New York City culture. Corinna da Fonseca-Wollheim is a classical music critic with three children, ages 15, 13 and 9; Daniel McDermon is a fine arts writer with three children, 7, 6 and 3; and Alexis Soloski is a theater critic with two children, 5 and 2. In a lively chat with no meltdowns — though occasional breaks for tooth brushing and bedtime kisses — they discussed choral music, Broadway babies and the dangers of taking a toddler to the Brooklyn Museum. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. ALEXIS SOLOSKI When we bravely leave the tablets behind and take the kids out into the cultural world, what do we do to make this a happier and less stressful experience? CORINNA da FONSECA-WOLLHEIM A really good question to ask yourself as you begin to take children to cultural events: Is it for education or entertainment? Is it to share something that’s precious to you with them? I think much of the stress that comes with these situations arises out of the fact that our egos have a big fat stake in how they turn out. DANIEL McDERMON I have wrestled a lot with the education vs. entertainment problem, in part because I keep insisting to myself (and my kids) that they are capable of appreciating things that just require more patience than they have. Like Buster Keaton movies. SOLOSKI I want them to love what I love, though I’ve gradually — and I hope not too grudgingly — acknowledged that they have their own tastes and desires. Which is how the 5-year-old and I ended up at “Frozen.” FONSECA-WOLLHEIM That’s also how I ended up more of an expert on the use of musical genres in the “Backyardigans” as opposed to them being well-versed in Mozart. A big difference to my own childhood is streaming. Like it or not, we live in an age in which it is easy to consume only what you already know and like. McDERMON It is also easier than ever for them to serve themselves with what they like, which means my YouTube recommendations are a disaster. McDERMON Our greatest successes owe a lot to some preliminary conversations, doing some reading together, and — maybe most important — snacks. I got my oldest, then 4, pretty excited to see “Picasso: Sculpture” at MoMA, and he liked it enough that I brought him back with the younger two so he could “share” it with them. FONSECA-WOLLHEIM My kids loved that Picasso show, too, and the current Andy Warhol retrospective at the Whitney Museum of American Art was a hit with all three. Perhaps the biggest difference between visual art and a live performance of music or theater is that you can take no shortcuts. I actually don’t make it my special mission to get my children to love classical music — any live event is a wonderful antidote to that insulating power of the screens. But since I am here to talk about classical music and kids, it’s worth saying up front: The music requires the communal silence of an attentive audience. And, unfortunately, that silence wants to be so total that a parent’s favorite tools — snacks and coloring books — won’t cut it. I once took my then 7-year-old daughter to a matinee of religious choral music — contemporary music inspired by the wounds of Christ. O.K., I couldn’t find a babysitter, and I was reviewing! She sat there dutifully clutching her coloring book, but the scratch-scratch of her pens was too loud. And it was dark. She ended up sitting in the lobby of the Kaufman Center for the rest of the concert. SOLOSKI I’ve had the occasional misfire, too. The first time I took my daughter to the Big Apple Circus, she became so fixated on the possibility of a pony ride that nothing — not tightrope walking, not clowns, not my frantic shushing — could distract her. McDERMON Like a lot of new parents, I tried too hard, too early, with my first kid. He loved long walks in the stroller, so I thought, why not walk him through the Brooklyn Museum? We made it about five minutes into a Mickalene Thomas show before he started fussing, then whining, then full-out wailing as I rushed out. SOLOSKI I take my kids to the theater pretty often, maybe every month or two, sometimes when I’m working and sometimes for what I will tentatively call fun. I try to find things I think all of us will like, but I don’t always guess right. And I don’t mind indulging them, cost permitting.  McDERMON My aim is twofold. I want them to be regulars in the city’s great cultural institutions, so they’ll feel at home, not intimidated. And then there are the sort of cultural totems that I feel obliged to share with them, like that Picasso show, or Giacometti at the Guggenheim, where a part of me is hoping to implant a kind of “aha” moment that they might be able to recall years from now. One plan that touches on both aims is that every winter for the last few years I have wondered whether I could finally inaugurate a holiday tradition of “The Nutcracker” or the Met’s kid-friendly version of “The Magic Flute.” And every year I think, maybe next year. I find Film Forum intimidating enough. FONSECA-WOLLHEIM First of all, adults may think of opera as an advanced form of classical music — that strange style of singing! The length! The plots! — but it has one huge advantage over instrumental concerts when it comes to kids: visual interest. The Met’s family-oriented productions around Christmas are excellent places to start. They are shortened, and in English, and the house will be full of kids. My own three liked “The Magic Flute” well enough when I first took them, and laughed in all the right places. But what really stuck with me from that performance was the sound of a young girl, somewhere above us, sobbing inconsolably at a quiet moment deep into the Masonic part of the opera where the character Pamina is heartbroken. Children get emotions. I’ll give you one more anecdote. I took my son, then 10 or 11, to see a double bill of short operas at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. There was Mark Morris’s witty take on Purcell’s “Dido and Aeneas,” which I knew contained a really great witch, and then this incredibly austere and esoteric Noh-inspired opera by Britten, “Curlew River.” It was that opera that left him spellbound, at the edge of his seat. You never know what they’ll respond to. McDERMON That kind of deep response is what I am hoping for when we try something that may be a bit beyond their reach. I spent at least 10 minutes with my son in front of Jackson Pollock’s “Autumn Rhythm (Number 30),” trying in a hushed, -nonobnoxious voice to talk him through the depths and dimension of it. It wasn’t enough to persuade him it was great, but I like to claim a minor victory in that we spent that much time looking. FONSECA-WOLLHEIM I try to impress upon them the need to keep questions until afterward, to clap when others are clapping, and to even be mindful of the noise of turning pages or unwrapping sweets. But I’ve come up with a kind of “rule-of-four” to maintain my own sanity. Certain actions — snuggling up to a parent, say, or even a muffled cough or a whisper — may distract the attention of the four audience members immediately surrounding you. But they don’t even register a few rows behind. Also, I should say that organizations like the New York Philharmonic put on wonderful concerts targeted at kids that don’t require these acrobatics. I’m talking more about how to prepare older kids for the mainstream concert situation. McDERMON We do talk about the rules of cultural spaces, though I try not to incite rebellion by shouting “no touching.” But the biggest factor for me has been taking just one kid at a time, so the two of us can have an ongoing conversation about what we see. SOLOSKI I’ve definitely whisper-shouted “No touching!” At the theater, I can be a bit of an etiquette monster. I try to comfort myself with the thought that the whole concept of a quiet and dutiful audience is a bourgeois 19th-century invention. But I don’t want it to be my kid having the meltdown. Still, I wish more shows understood that kids are kids, and they may not be thrilled to sit quietly for an hour and change, especially the littler ones. Most children are haptic learners, so I find the shows that have allowed them to move around and to join in the experience engage them best.  FONSECA-WOLLHEIM Summer festivals are the best for families. Anything outdoors — whether it’s the Naumburg Bandshell in Central Park or Tanglewood in Lenox, Mass. — allows kids to experience classical music while literally being able to turn cartwheels. If you want to expose your kids to the funkier varieties of contemporary music — wonderfully amplified, often — the Bang on a Can Marathon is a great place to start. And I recently discovered a sweet chamber music series at SubCulture, called GatherNYC, that runs one-hour shows on Sunday mornings complete with breakfast pastries and coffee. There were some very young children there who really took to it. McDERMON The Bang on a Can Marathon was my son’s first concert. (Though we only lasted for one performer.) And I agree that being outdoors is a huge help. Storm King Art Center in New Windsor, N.Y., or the Socrates Sculpture Park in Long Island City, Queens, can be fantastic with kids, and I think the scale of outdoor or public sculpture helps them recognize the way that art stands apart from the everyday.  SOLOSKI I’m really in love with the New Victory Theater’s model, which has art projects and activities for children before and after. And the shows are short! In recent years a lot of places have upped their game and are finding really innovative ways to delight children without boring parents: Lincoln Center Kids, BAM Kids, the French Institute: Alliance Française.  FONSECA-WOLLHEIM Lincoln Center offers free short performances by top artists in the Rubenstein Atrium (on the first Saturday of each month), which can be a great first taste. The outdoor events in Central Park are free. And recently I dipped into a lovely tradition that has been going on at St. Paul’s Chapel downtown for years: a half-hour program of choral Vespers by candlelight with the stellar Choir of Trinity Wall Street on Sunday evening. Everyone gets to hold a candle, which can be surprisingly hypnotic for a kid! McDERMON The best value in the fine art world is New York’s galleries, which are full of world-class work and completely free, if you exclude the cost of the occasional unwelcoming glance. With a kid who has any interest and a modicum of self-control, I think touring Chelsea or uptown gallery districts is a blast. But dragging a toddler or a group of kids is a bad idea. SOLOSKI Most Broadway shows now have lotteries and once a year, they offer a deal where a child can attend for free if an adult buys a full-price ticket. The next one is Feb. 26. And a lot of theaters will offer discounts to groups or offers for school groups, provided your children’s teachers are amenable. FONSECA-WOLLHEIM I think the single best piece of advice I can give is to do as Daniel suggested and bring only one child at a time. My most stressful memories revolve around efforts to bring kids of very different ages — and their interpersonal dynamics — into the same cultural space. My second piece of advice — harking back to our beginning — is to exercise patience and take our own ego out of it. None of my three children grew to love classical music the way I did, and I’m sometimes sad about that, just as I regret not passing on to them fluency in my mother tongue, German. But time works its own magic. My 15-year-old sat rapt through a Philharmonic concert and “Adriana Lecouvreur” at the Met Opera over the holidays just because a friend from camp who was into classical music was visiting. And my son is now clamoring for piano lessons and YouTubing Chopin preludes because of a Japanese anime movie. So peers and, yes, Netflix, can sometimes succeed where you (think you) fail. McDERMON New York is rich with magical spaces, and the rooms and buildings themselves can be enchanting. The grand sculpture galleries inside the Metropolitan Museum of Art overflow with monumental works, and that overwhelming feeling has really seized my kids’ attention when we visit. In a place like that, they get to choose what’s interesting to them, and we can spend time together discussing it. SOLOSKI I’d look for works and spaces that give children a chance to contribute to the experience, and that meet children where they are, without talking up or down to them. And snacks. I can’t overemphasize snacks. FONSECA-WOLLHEIM That’s why my kids will tell you that their favorite venue to be dragged to is (Le) Poisson Rouge, which has a photo booth and a menu including tater tots and warm chocolate chip cookies. They also love how naughty it feels to go to a “nightclub” — even if it’s Bach on the program. We’ve compiled a guide with over 25 events that will help you navigate the city’s cultural landscape over the next few weeks, including the New York International Children’s Film Festival, Very Young People’s Concerts at the New York Philharmonic and the permanent exhibition “Ocean Wonders: Sharks!” at the New York Aquarium. (There’s also the weekly kids listings.) "
5c61a8b73a125f5075c091ab,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/11/arts/music/grammy-awards-review.html,"Ariana Grande didn’t attend the Grammys, but that didn’t stop her from being at the center of the conversation about — and around — the ceremony. On Friday she released an album, “Thank U, Next,” and a hot-button video for a new single, “Break Up With Your Girlfriend, I’m Bored.” And throughout Sunday, she found several ways — some earnest, some petty — to stay at the forefront of online discussion. When she won best pop vocal album, for “Sweetener,” she wrote on Twitter, “I try not to put too much weight into these things,” conceding, “this is wild and beautiful.” She appeared in a psychedelically disorienting commercial for Apple’s Memoji, with an animated Grande head performing “7 Rings.” When Cardi B won best rap album, Grande fired off a couple of frustrated tweets; her ex-boyfriend, Mac Miller, who died last year, was a nominee. (She later apologized and deleted all of the tweets.) And she posted several photos of herself in the custom Zac Posen dress she was going to wear during the ceremony. [Who soared and who flopped? See the best and worst of the Grammys.] This wasn’t the Grammy experience Grande was planning to have. Up until a couple of days ago, she was slated to perform on the broadcast, a plan that imploded in spectacular fashion. After the longtime show producer Ken Ehrlich said in an interview that Grande was no longer performing because she “felt it was too late for her to pull something together,” Grande replied with barbs. “I’ve kept my mouth shut but now you’re lying about me,” Grande wrote on Twitter. “I can pull together a performance over night and you know that, Ken. It was when my creativity & self-expression was stifled by you, that I decided not to attend.” And so on the night of the Grammys, all of the noise Grande generated was heard everywhere but the actual broadcast, making her one of several artists who made loud splashes without ever setting foot in the Staples Center. This year’s ceremony was perhaps as notable for who didn’t show up — Kendrick Lamar, Childish Gambino (who won four awards, including record and song of the year for “This Is America”), Taylor Swift — as who did. And also for how it treated several of its biggest winners, including Drake, cutting off their speeches abruptly. (This, on a broadcast on which only nine awards were handed out over more than three and a half hours.) [Hear our pop music team break down the Grammy highs and lows.] So perhaps the best place to communicate an unfettered message during the Grammys is anywhere but the actual ceremony. The show still conceives of itself as a linear television experience, when in fact the consumption of it — and especially the stars it relies upon — is wild, woolly and omnidirectional. Consider 21 Savage, nominated for two awards for his role on Post Malone’s “Rockstar” but unable to attend because of his detention by Immigration and Customs Enforcement last week. When Post Malone performed, he didn’t mention his collaborator, which spurred a fierce backlash online. (Eventually, a photo of him wearing a 21 Savage T-shirt underneath his outfit was circulated.) Kei Henderson, one of 21 Savage’s managers, wrote on Twitter that she and others “attempted to solidify recognition for Savage during the performance of ‘Rockstar,’ it just didn’t work out that way.” The only person to mention 21 Savage during the broadcast was Ludwig Göransson, the Childish Gambino collaborator. The lack of other acknowledgment was glaring. Some stars used the Grammys window to advertise their other endeavors. Childish Gambino appeared in a vivid ad for Google’s Playmoji in which he danced alongside an avatar of himself. Travis Scott had one of the most energetic performances of the show, but also released a new sneaker during the ceremony. Taylor Swift, who was nominated once this year, posted a photo on Instagram from the Baftas, in London. (Last year, the video for “The Middle” — the Zedd, Maren Morris and Grey collaboration — debuted during the Grammys as part of a Target advertising campaign; this year, it was nominated for record and song of the year. The side road works.) While plenty of stars sought a way around the Grammy telecast pipeline, others used it to its fullest potential. Cardi B, who often appears to be the only performer in any field who still experiences genuine shock and gratitude, delivered an emotional speech after winning best rap album. Brandi Carlile’s performance of “The Joke” was outlandishly good, and Alicia Keys’s hosting had several slyly intriguing moments. Following a brutally boring Grammys last year that also deeply marginalized women, it was refreshing that most of this year’s high points came from female artists. More often, though, when the Grammys had an opportunity to celebrate one of pop’s most prominent stars, it dropped the ball. Speeches from almost all the most relevant winners — Kacey Musgraves, Cardi B, Dua Lipa — were cut short. In no case was this more egregious than with Drake, by far the most popular artist to win a Grammy this year. Drake was offered a performance slot, but turned it down (as did Lamar and Childish Gambino). So when he popped up onstage after he was announced as the winner of best rap song, it was a true surprise. [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] While his appearance was magnanimous — especially after his prior critiques of the Grammys — his speech was anything but. He took a swipe at his prior best rap song Grammy win for “Hotline Bling,” which is not (really) a rap song. He drew attention to the fact that those who vote for the Grammys might not be the best equipped to “understand, you know, what a mixed-race kid from Canada has to say, or a fly Spanish girl from New York, or anybody else, or a brother from Houston,” acknowledging Cardi B and Travis Scott. And then, the real humdinger. “Look, if there’s people who have regular jobs who are coming out in the rain, in the snow, spending their hard-earned money to buy tickets to come to your shows, you don’t need this right here, I promise you. You already won.” “But,” Drake continued. The Grammys, however, did not continue with him. The camera pulled back to a wide shot, and then the show quickly cut to commercial. (A representative for the show later said that producers mistook Drake’s pause for the end of his remarks.) The Grammys made room for plenty of time-absorbers: Alicia Keys karaoke; umpteen tributes; a long montage dedicated to the Recording Academy’s beleaguered outgoing leader, Neil Portnow. But it is the show’s stubborn curse that it’s willing to cut off the most popular and meaningful artist in pop at the knees in order to preserve its sense of self-importance — a preposterous and careless choice. It is that same hubris that allows Ariana Grande to watch the Grammys from the couch rather than be on the stage, and that ensures the Grammys will continue to be a site of protest, of dissent, and dullness for years to come, pending changes in leadership and attitude. After the ceremony, Drake posted a photo of the victory envelope bearing his name, and added the caption “Too raw for TV.” Now more than ever, that’s a fine way to be. "
5c89321c49f0eacbf105cdb0,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/13/arts/music/french-british-hip-hop-afrobeats-afrotrap.html,"LONDON — Britain can be an insular place. A parlor game here involves trying to list as many famous Belgians as possible, on the basis that few people know any. An equivalent exercise with French rappers would be even tougher. France is one of the world’s largest rap music markets, but its neighbor on the other side of the English Channel pays little attention. The lack of interest is reciprocated. French rap is full of borrowed English words: The F-bomb is often detonated in lyrics, especially in “le rap hard-core.” But the prevailing influence is American; British rappers struggle to command attention. Stormzy, probably Britain’s highest-profile M.C., topped the British charts when he released his debut album in 2017. In France, he did not even make the top 200. Can the differences between these opposing citadels of European rap be bridged? The answer lies not just in Britain and France, but also in Europe’s former colonies in Africa. West and Central Africa contain numerous English- and French-speaking nations that reflect the presence of Britain, France and Belgium as colonial powers until the 1960s. Imported styles of pop music from sub-Saharan Africa have been adopted and transformed by British and French musicians who have roots there. Omo Frenchie is a London-based rapper who toggles between English and French in his songs. “Rapping in French is a lot harder,” he said in a telephone interview. “It’s the language and the pronunciation. In French, they’ll go the long way around saying even simple things. But the good thing is that when you do find a nice line, it sounds amazing.” Frenchie, who would not give his real name or age, is actually a trilingual performer. He also uses Lingala, one of the languages of the Democratic Republic of Congo, a country that emerged from Belgian colonial rule in 1960. Frenchie was born there but moved to London with his family as a baby. The first time he used French and Lingala in a song was in 2013. The occasion was a guest appearance on a track by the musician Afro B, another Londoner with a Francophone African background. After it came out, Frenchie noticed a surge of interest on Twitter, with people asking: Who’s this guy that’s speaking French? “From then on, I knew that that was my niche,” Frenchie said. He is not alone. Yxng Bane (pronounced Young Bane) is an up-and-coming rapper from London with a clutch of British chart hits under his belt. Like Frenchie, he has Congolese ancestry. The 22-year-old, real name Larry Kiala, grew up speaking English and French at home, before later learning Lingala. Last year, he teamed up with a French rapper called Franglish for the song “Makasi,” which was recorded in Paris. His linkup with Franglish — a hybrid name to strike fear in the hearts of the Académie Française, the zealous gatekeepers of the French language — was forged through their shared African heritage. The French rapper also has a Congolese family background (“makasi” is the Lingala word for “strong”). Their collaboration illustrates the growing influence of African music on British and French rap. The shift is partly driven by demographic change. The proportion of Britons from a black African background doubled between 2001 and 2011, when the last national census took place. (France does not record the ethnicity of its citizens.) The strong influence of African music on British rap derives from the popularity of Afrobeats, a blend of West African, Caribbean and American urban music, which originated in the 2000s in Nigeria and Ghana, former British colonies. It crossed over into British urban music in the early 2010s. The first Afrobeats hit in Britain’s top 10 came in 2012 with D’Banj’s “Oliver Twist.” (The song’s video featured Kanye West, who signed D’Banj to his record label.) Since then, numerous variants have sprung up, a dizzying profusion of subgenres with names like Afroswing and Afrobashment. The proliferation is partly a fad. “I feel like if you’re going to put the word Afro in it, there has to be that African element,” Omo Frenchie said. “A lot of it is watered down,” he added. “It deserves a little bit more.” But the overall hybrid style, moving easily between Chicago drill, Drake’s sing-rapping, Caribbean dance hall and West African urban pop, is more than a trend. It has taken root in the mainstream as a newly dominant mode of urban music in Britain. Its geographically profuse sound is epitomized by a rising star of British rap, Octavian, who was born in France to African parents before moving to London as a child. The equivalent genre across the Channel is Afrotrap. It was pioneered by MHD, a musician from Paris who is one of the best-known rappers in France. He created Afrotrap in 2015 when he posted a video of himself on social media freestyling a rap over a song by the Nigerian Afrobeats band P-Square. Last year, he became the first French rapper to play the Coachella festival in California. But MHD’s career hangs in the balance. In January, he was arrested on charges relating to a man’s violent death in Paris. MHD denies any involvement. Nonetheless, the genre that he created has become embedded in French hip-hop. The rapper Niska drew on Afrotrap in his album “Commando,” the No. 3 most-streamed album in France in 2017. In an email exchange before his arrest in December, MHD, 24, whose real name is Mohamed Sylla, said that his ambition was “to export my music to an international audience.” “In France, this kind of mixture was new,” he said, referring to Afrotrap. He felt an affinity, he added, with his British peers: “The English have this ability to mix things up and fuse genres. They are lucky to have a public that is hyper-open to these blended sounds.” Afrotrap draws on Coupé-Décalé, a dance music style from the Ivory Coast. It is harder and faster than the British Afrobeats and its offshoots. “The African music sound in France is different,” Frenchie said. “No one in the U.K. has jumped on a beat like that. It’s predominantly an African sequence.” But there are areas of overlap as well as divergence. MHD has bolstered his profile in English-speaking markets by collaborating with Afrobeats singers such as the Nigerian star Wizkid. Last year, he played shows in London. Niska followed in his footsteps in February. Traffic across the English Channel is building in volume. “I feel like there’s a big wave with the Afrotrap music coming from France,” Yxng Bane said. “I feel that it’s getting highly recognized.” And his own efforts at an Anglo-French rapprochement in rap will continue, he added. “Just keep your eyes open,” Yxng Bane said. “Got some more Francophone for them. It’s coming, it’s coming.” "
5cb112eb49f0eacbf1f83976,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/12/obituaries/james-winn-dead.html,"James A. Winn, whose scholarly writings on Queen Anne, John Dryden and other subjects showed the influence of his side interest as a professional-caliber flutist, died on March 21 at his home in Brattleboro, Vt. He was 71. His son, Philip, said the cause was pancreatic cancer. Professor Winn, who taught most recently at Boston University, was interested in a wide range of topics. His book subjects also included Alexander Pope’s letters and the poetry of war. He wrote essays on Bach and on the Beatles. In all of that work, he sought to expand the often narrow scope of academic inquiry. His 2014 biography, “Queen Anne: Patroness of Arts,” for instance, examined that British monarch’s often discounted reign (1702-1714) through the lens of the cultural offerings of the period. “James was always from the beginning interested in interdisciplinary things,” Robert Freeman, former director of the Eastman School of Music, who advised Professor Winn when he was a student at Princeton, said in a telephone interview. “He believed that the academic world tends to isolate itself into a bunch of silos.” Professor Winn himself was certainly not a silo-dweller; when he wasn’t teaching English or writing about the Restoration, he was performing with orchestras or small ensembles, or working on a recording. “He could easily have been the principal flutist of a major orchestra,” Dr. Freeman, a longtime friend, said, “but I don’t think that interested him.” What did interest him was applying the perspective he had as a musician to his scholarship, which he did most particularly in a 1998 book, “The Pale of Words.” There he argued for research and teaching that took into account more than just the written word. “Much of what humanists study originates in performance, and all good teaching ought to be alert to the living excitement of arts and ideas,” he wrote. His best-known book, “John Dryden and His World,” had come out 11 years earlier. Pat Rogers,  in The New York Times Book Review, called it “the most important biography of Dryden ever written.” In the book, Professor Winn lamented that Dryden, the poet, critic and playwright of the Restoration period, was underappreciated, something he thought could be remedied by “removing the prejudices and simplifications about his culture that keep our ears from hearing his mighty music.” Dr. Rogers thought the book succeeded in doing just that. “He challenges us to rethink our stereotyped notions of a Puritanism that is hostile to art, or of a monolithic ‘Restoration culture’ that is all rakes, prostitutes and Pepysian encounters in the playhouse,” the review said. James Anderson Winn was born on July 31, 1947, in Charlotte, N.C. His father, Albert, was a Presbyterian minister and theologian, and his mother, Grace Walker Winn, was an educator. Albert Winn’s ministry and teaching posts took him to several Southern cities during James’s childhood. Music was part of the household. “When my great-uncle Dwight died,” Professor Winn wrote in an unpublished memoir, “my parents received a small bequest, which they used to buy a piano rather than a television, a great decision for all.” James sang and played ukulele from a young age. He started playing flute in the sixth grade, choosing the instrument, his son said, because Albert Winn still had the flute he had played in high school, making it the most affordable option. In 1960 the family moved to Louisville, Ky., and Professor Winn was able to study the flute with Francis Fuge, the principal flutist of the Louisville Symphony. He graduated from Atherton High School in Louisville in 1964. Years later, in a 1988 interview with The Times — when Professor Winn, then teaching at the University of Michigan, had just published the Dryden biography — he commented on how being raised in the South, with its rich history, had influenced him. “We grew up with a very large sense of the past,” he said. “What I found attractive about the age of Dryden and Pope at the time I fell in love with it was that it seemed to me old and fine, elegant and polished, complex in ways that I didn’t then understand — and don’t now.” Professor Winn attended Princeton, where Dr. Freeman, then a junior faculty member there, encouraged him to continue studying music even as he pursued an English degree. He performed with the university orchestra and even sang with the Footnotes, an a cappella group of which he was also music director. He received a bachelor’s degree in 1968, then spent two years in the Army, playing flute in the Continental Army Band. He received a Ph.D. from Yale in 1974, writing his dissertation on Pope’s letters, a subject he turned into his first book, “A Window in the Bosom,” in 1977. Professor Winn taught at Yale from 1974 to 1983, then went to the University of Michigan, where he was founding director of its Institute for the Humanities. Professor Winn’s father, who was active in the civil rights movement, published a book in 1993 called “Ain’t Gonna Study War No More: Biblical Ambiguity and the Abolition of War,” and in 2008 Professor Winn took up a related area in “The Poetry of War.” “Like the ocean, great fires, and destructive storms,” he wrote in that book, “war is attractive to poets as an instance of the sublime, an experience bringing together awe, terror, power, and reverence on a grand scale.” His biography of Queen Anne, his most recent book, had an unusual appendage: He tracked down 28 pieces of music from her time, arranged with some of his musician acquaintances to record them and set up a website where readers of the book, using a password, could hear them. Professor Winn’s marriage to Kathe Fox ended in divorce in 1994. In addition to his son, he is survived by another child from that marriage, Ellen Winn; by his wife, Lucy Chapman, whom he married in 2009; and by four grandchildren. Professor Winn joined the Boston University faculty in 1998, taking emeritus status in 2017. He was director of the university’s Center for the Humanities from 2008 to 2016. He performed and recorded with other members of the faculty, including the pianist David Kopp. In his final months, he was editing a recording by the two of them of Bach, Schubert and Fauré. In a blog he had been keeping on CaringBridge.org, he told friends and family members on Feb. 25 that the CDs were ready. On that same blog last June, he wrote of attending his 50th college reunion at Princeton. “I got together with those classmates who were in my a cappella group, the Footnotes,” he wrote, “rehearsed them as rigorously as I could, and directed a small and satisfying arch-sing with six members of the class of 1968 and two guests from adjacent classes. Small spaces have pitches, and we sang in an arch that resonates to B-flat. The sound when we reached a cadence in that key was wonderful.” "
5ca78c2b49f0eacbf1f81370,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/05/business/media/lil-nas-x-billy-ray-cyrus-billboard.html,"Booming beats. A twanging banjo. Is this country music? When Lil Nas X, a young black hip-hop artist from Atlanta, created the surprise hit “Old Town Road,” he did not imagine that it would end up at the center of a debate on race, the Nashville establishment and musical genres. The track marries a beat familiar to hip-hop fans with acoustic sounds and lyrics filled with cowboy imagery. Lil Nas X had no record deal when he made it, and the song bubbled up on the internet before it made three different Billboard charts: the Hot 100, Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot Country Songs. Once it was a success, Billboard removed it from its country chart. On Friday, in what seemed to be a dare to Billboard and Nashville, Lil Nas X released a new version of the song that included the 1990s country star Billy Ray Cyrus as a featured vocalist. Was it country enough for them now? When Billboard banished “Old Town Road” from the country chart, it issued a statement to Rolling Stone claiming the song “does not embrace enough elements of today’s country music to chart in its current version.” With Mr. Cyrus along for the ride, it is possible that country radio stations who ignored it will start playing it. [Listen: Lil Nas X and the long history of country-rap.] Billboard’s decision to drop the song from Hot Country Songs prompted a debate about race and country music itself. White Nashville artists, like Florida Georgia Line and Sam Hunt, have used hip-hop-influenced beats and production techniques for years. Do those performers have more leeway than Lil Nas X? Shane Morris, a former record label executive in Nashville, thinks so. “They said there were compositional problems,” Mr. Morris said of Billboard’s chartmakers, “because they didn’t know how to justify it any other way without sounding completely racist.” Charles Hughes, the director of the Lynne & Henry Turley Memphis Center at Rhodes College, called Billboard’s decision “a bad move,” saying it perpetuated a longstanding racial tension in black music. “Black artists have been influential in country a long, long way back,” Mr. Hughes said, “but country has rewarded white artists that have taken advantage of those influences, without giving black artists the same opportunities.” The rejection of “Old Town Road” by the country establishment, in Mr. Hughes’s view, echoed a time when country radio stations ignored Ray Charles’s groundbreaking 1962 album, “Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music.” Lil Nas X, whose real name is Montero Hill, said he wrote “Old Town Road” last fall, after staying with his sister while avoiding his parents as a college dropout. When his sister finally sent him on his way, he imagined his future. “I felt like a loner cowboy,” he said. “I wanted to take my horse to the Old Town Road and run away. The horse is like a car. The Old Town Road, it’s like a path to success. In the first verse, I pack up, ready to go.” He posted the song online in December along with an observation: “country music is evolving.” It soon became a sensation on TikTok, an app that allows users to make and share short music videos. Young people made video shorts of themselves dressing up in cowboy gear, using the song as a soundtrack. By March, Lil Nas X had nailed down the deal with Columbia. In an interview on Friday, he sidestepped questions about being dropped from the country chart. “I’m still in Billboard — this is amazing,” he said. This week, the song climbed 17 spots, to No. 15, on Billboard’s Hot 100, which measures the popularity of pop songs. The blending of country music and black American forms is certainly nothing new. The white guitarist Jimmie Rodgers, whom many consider the father of country music, built the genre on a foundation of the blues in the 1920s. Ray Charles’s innovations in the early 1960s paved the way for the Nashville success of another black artist, Charley Pride. More recently, Darius Rucker, of the rock band Hootie and the Blowfish, had a No. 1 country hit with “Don’t Think I Don’t Think About It.” Last year, Jimmie Allen, a black performer from Delaware, made Billboard’s country top 10 with his debut single, “Best Shot.” Another African-American singer, Kane Brown, had two No. 1 hits on Billboard’s country chart, one in 2017 and one in 2018. In a statement, Billboard said that its chart decisions were determined by factors including the promotion of a song and its reception at radio and on streaming services, and that it could revisit its decision about “Old Town Road.” So far, the song has gotten little support from country stations. Last week, it was played five times on country stations, according to Nielsen; this week, it was played 62 times by 31 stations. The remixed version of “Old Town Road,” with vocals from Mr. Cyrus, the singer of the 1992 hit “Achy Breaky Heart,” came together two weeks ago, Lil Nas X said. The finishing touches were added on Thursday night, hours before it was released and went viral all over again. The rapper’s collaboration with Mr. Cyrus, the father of the singer Miley Cyrus, may seem unlikely, but Lil Nas X said he had been a fan for years. In December, two days after the song’s initial release, he posted a message on Twitter asking for Mr. Cyrus to join him on the track: “twitter please help me get billy ray cyrus on this.” While the addition of Mr. Cyrus may help the song’s chances on country stations and country charts, the new version makes no substantial change to its core. Mr. Cyrus defended the country bona fides of the original version of “Old Town Road” on Wednesday, adding to the pressure on Billboard and the Nashville establishment by casting Lil Nas X in the role of a beloved country music archetype — the outlaw. “When I got thrown off the charts,” Mr. Cyrus wrote on Twitter, “Waylon Jennings said to me ‘Take this as a compliment’ means you’re doing something great! Only Outlaws are outlawed. Welcome to the club!” "
5c6d3a283a125f5075c0a924,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/20/world/asia/k-pop-identical-korea.html,"HONG KONG — Doe-eyed with delicate features. A sharp jawline and willowy figure. Fair skin so clear it almost glows. With many South Korean pop idols fitting that description in their sleekly produced music videos, their mass appeal has many of the country’s young people wanting to look just like them. But in an effort to tone down their influence in a beauty-obsessed country where plastic surgery is rampant, South Korea’s government is trying to limit the stars’ presence on television, saying they look too much alike. “Are all the singers on television music programs twins?” the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family wrote about the stars of K-pop, as their music is known, in broadcast guidelines released this month, according to The Korea Times. “They seriously look identical,” it said, adding that many pop idol groups’ musical styles were “just as limited as their appearances.” The guidelines drew such criticism from fans that on Tuesday the ministry apologized for “causing unnecessary confusion,” and said that some of the recommendations would be removed or reviewed, the news agency Agence France-Presse reported. Some compared the guidelines to the censorship imposed during the country’s military dictatorship during the latter half of the 20th century. An online petition, calling for the ministry to be dissolved, read, “The ministry has dared to point out female idols for being too pretty, wearing the same clothes and being skinny,” according to the newspaper Korea Joongang Daily. Ha Tae-kyung, a politician from an opposition party, compared the guidelines — which the gender ministry said applied to both female and male performers — to restrictions on hair and skirt lengths during the dictatorship. “There are no objective standards to people’s looks,” he wrote in a Facebook post on Saturday. It wasn’t the first time Mr. Ha had defended influential K-pop band members. Last year, he called for them to be exempt from the county’s military draft, since top classical musicians are given exemptions. The guidelines were intended to make television a more benevolent experience. Ministry officials said on Monday that viewers worried that television shows “exacerbate inequalities and gender stereotypes, rather than fixing it,” the Korea Joongang Daily reported. In the guidelines, officials suggested that shows avoid featuring performers “whose appearances are exceedingly similar” in the same program. One in three South Korean women have undergone cosmetic surgery between the ages of 19 and 29, a  Gallup Korea poll has found — a trend that mirrors the narrow beauty standards epitomized by K-pop stars. Some South Koreans have openly celebrated having cosmetic surgery, documenting their physical transformations as a rite of passage. In a pair of videos called “Getting Pretty Before” and “Getting Pretty After,” members of the K-pop group SixBomb giddily went for manicures between appointments at a plastic surgeon, where their faces were prodded and poked. “Getting Pretty After” showed them wearing pink bodysuits in an operating room, prancing out afterward with altered faces.

Jagger, 75, confirmed the news in a tweet, thanking fans and hospital employees. While Curtis declined to comment further, NBC News reported that Jagger had received “transcatheter aortic valve replacement” in New York. The band had announced last Saturday that the 17 remaining shows of its “No Filter” tour would be postponed on advice from Jagger’s doctors. Fans were told to hold on to their tickets, which would be valid for the rescheduled dates. “I really hate letting you down like this,” Jagger said on Twitter that day. The Rolling Stones, which formed in 1962, had already completed the first two legs of the tour in Europe in 2017 and 2018. The final leg, originally scheduled to kick off on April 20, would have taken the band to cities in the United States and Canada. The band was first introduced to the American public 55 years ago on the variety show “The Red Skelton Hour.” "

How he’s filling at least part of that downtime? Video games. A fan of the Red Dead Redemption series, he was nudged into contributing an original song to Red Dead Redemption 2. “Unshaken” is lonely cowboy-western soul, produced by Daniel Lanois — an incantation for those with bleary eyes and unswerving defiance. JON CARAMANICA A chorus of “oohs” and “ahs” in jazzy chords, circling without resolution, accompanies the Chicago rapper Noname as she calmly zooms down her latest stream of consciousness. Syncopating her rhymes rapidly and precisely over the tricky beat, Noname touches on her success without a record label, African-American representation on TV, mass incarceration, Christmas and all the direct messages she has ignored, among other things. “I sell pain for profit, not propaganda,” she declares. Her producer, Phoelix, also shows up as a singer with an enigmatic, equally unresolved chorus. JON PARELES A fine mist of guitar-pop, “Promise” — the new solo single from Jimin, of the K-pop juggernaut BTS — runs in the opposite direction of the familiar BTS maximalism. Here he sounds tender and sweet, and the song never moves quicker than a saunter. In the broader BTS oeuvre, it’s something of an afterthought, casual and unobtrusive. But that hardly matters: It broke the SoundCloud record for most plays in a song’s first 24 hours. CARAMANICA Post Malone’s farewell to 2018 is far more exuberant than anything he released last year. “Wow.” is boastful but not melancholy — “I got a lot of toys/720S bumpin’ Fall Out Boy” — and he’s largely rapping, with only a flimsy skin of melody. After a year in which his album “Beerbongs & Bentleys” helped set the framework for pop’s full-molt evolution, this is a chipper cherry on top, unconcerned with formal innovation and blithely cheerful. CARAMANICA A lurching beat, somewhere in the vicinity of reggae, and a psychedelic-orchestral blur of instruments accompany the high, singsong vocals of Neshma Friend, who records as Micropixie. “How could we ever win the game of life/When all we ever knew was pain and strife/Every day,” she muses. She admits to the hopes that a holiday can raise, then ambles off her own way. PARELES This quartet from New York writes songs spiked with humorous asides, ska guitar and riot grrrl attitude (so it doesn’t sound anything like T. Rex, or the Marc Bolan tribute act from England that shares its name). The group started when its members were still in high school and its second album, “Prehysteria,” delivers more scrawny indie rock with an extra helping of eye roll. Over the Sleater-Kinney-ish backdrop of “Maddy’s Got a Boyfriend,” Lyris Faron nurses a wounded heart: “She leaves me crying in the sand/she said she never liked my band.” CARYN GANZ “I love you baby but my lips are turning blue,” Ursula Rose raps, deadpan, shattering the male self-pity and metronomic electro-pop that Bear Hands concocted for the rest of this track. She’s centered; the guys are a mess. PARELES It has been six years between albums for the Danish songwriter and classical composer Nanna Oland Fabricius, who made her debut album as Oh Land in 2008. “Human Error” merges her early dance-pop electronics with skeletal piano and unfurling orchestral arrangements as she sings about the difference between calculated planning and real life: “No missing digits, no real mistakes/Just human errors make human hearts break,” she realizes. PARELES Steph Richards composes in ways that standard notation could never document. To make “Brooklyn Machine,” she yanked out one of her trumpet’s valves — some air escapes where it ought to be, making the muffled, sometimes warping sound you hear in your right speaker. The tinnier tone coming from the left emerges when Richards covers the valve and air passes through the horn’s bell, like usual. The bell, in turn, is covered with a mute, helping her create the fuzzy mumble at the beginning of the track. “Brooklyn Machine” appears on “Take the Neon Lights,” her forthcoming album, but the performance in the video above — featuring abstracted urban scenes animated by Andrea Yasco — is a separate take, just under a minute and a half of haunting trumpet surgery and jostling play with her piano-bass-drums quartet. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO Paul McCartney, that Paul McCartney, uses Auto-Tune — yes, Auto-Tune — to sing about lost, lifelong love. “It was a time we were all full of hope/Saw the future burning bright,” he sings. “Do you remember?” Now it’s the future. And all you can remember is when the Beatles wouldn’t use anyone else’s sounds, and when an unprocessed voice was enough. PARELES "
5ca1060449f0eacbf1f7afee,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/31/business/media/plagiarism-music-songwriters.html,"It’s not easy to be a songwriter in the pop world these days. Listeners rarely see your name. For anything but a giant hit, royalties from streaming are infinitesimal — and big tech companies seem to want to keep it that way. And then there’s the shadow of “Blurred Lines.” Four years after the copyright trial over that No. 1 song — in which Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams, its primary writers, were ordered to pay more than $5 million for copying Marvin Gaye’s disco-era hit “Got to Give It Up” — the case still looms over the music industry and individual songwriters, who were left to wonder when homage bleeds into plagiarism. Intellectual property lawyers and music executives interviewed for this article said the case had fueled a rise in copyright claims. In September, Ed Sheeran will go to court to defend “Thinking Out Loud,” a Grammy-winning song that has been accused of mimicking another Gaye classic, “Let’s Get It On.” Two years ago, Mr. Sheeran settled another suit by giving up part of his ownership in the Top 10 hit “Photograph,” which was accused of having similarities to “Amazing,” a song by the British singer-songwriter Matt Cardle. The aftereffects of the “Blurred Lines” decision — which was upheld on appeal last year — have been felt most acutely by rank-and-file songwriters, who work in obscurity even as their creations propel others to stardom. The ramifications for them have been inescapable, affecting royalty splits, legal and insurance costs, and even how songs are composed. The songwriter Evan Bogart, who has written for Beyoncé, Rihanna and Madonna, described second-guessing himself in the studio, worried that a melody or lyric might cross a line he can no longer locate. “I shouldn’t be thinking about legal precedent when I am trying to write a chorus,” Mr. Bogart said. Most accusations of plagiarism never go before a judge. Instead, they are settled quietly — and often protected with confidentiality agreements — with the results evident only in the fine print of writing credits. Take “Friends,” a hit last year by the D.J. and producer Marshmello and the singer Anne-Marie. When the song first appeared on the charts, in February 2018, it was credited to three people: Marshmello, Anne-Marie and Nat Dunn, an Australian-born singer and songwriter. By June, after it had climbed to No. 11 on the Billboard chart, and versions of it had racked up more than 640 million YouTube streams, five additional names were listed among the song’s creators. Between the song’s release date and its international success, the three people originally credited as the writers of “Friends” were accused of ripping off a little-heard 2017 song called “Obvious” by the London-based producer Eden Prince, featuring the singer Cassie. The songwriters of “Obvious” included Mr. Prince, three members of a British music collective called the Six and another singer, Jasmine Thompson. They claimed that one line in “Friends” (“Haven’t I made it obvious, haven’t I made it clear?”) infringed on a similar line in “Obvious” (“Did I make it obvious, did I make it clear?”). Ms. Dunn, one of the writers of “Friends,” said in an interview that she believed the claim was “ridiculous,” but that her advisers had instructed her not to fight it and potentially end up in court, where the outcome would be unpredictable. “Everyone was like, ‘Let’s just clear it up and make it go away,’” she recalled. “I reluctantly settled.” Ms. Dunn declined to divulge any details about the settlement terms. Marshmello and Anne-Marie declined to comment, and representatives of the writers of “Obvious” did not respond to inquiries. Copyright disputes are nothing new in music. In the United States, they go back at least as far as a lawsuit over the illicit publication of the sheet music of W. J. Wetmore’s “The Cot Beneath the Hill” in 1844. Occasionally, an outlying case will force industrywide adjustment. In 1976, for example, songwriters had to reckon with the idea of unintended infringement after George Harrison was found to have “subconsciously” based his first solo hit, “My Sweet Lord,” on a girl-group classic, the Chiffons’ “He’s So Fine.” After the decision, Mr. Harrison wrote in his memoir, he felt a “paranoia about songwriting that had started to build up in me.” The “Blurred Lines” case, many lawyers and executives say, has become the latest watershed, putting the commonly understood rules of songwriting up for debate. As songwriters often remark, there are only so many notes in the scale, and influence is essential to the art. Harvey Mason Jr., a songwriter and producer, said the “Blurred Lines” case “unnerved a lot of people writing songs, because a lot of what inspires creative people is the work that has been done before.” It changed the game for the lawyers, too. Edwin F. McPherson, a litigator who did not agree with the “Blurred Lines” decision, said the case had changed the calculus about which copyright cases prevail. “In a normal world, I would say there is a very slim chance,” Mr. McPherson said. “But now I have to add a caveat every time I advise a client: But ‘Blurred Lines.’” At the “Blurred Lines” trial, an eight-person jury heard detailed and esoteric testimony by expert witnesses from both sides about what, if anything, Mr. Thicke and Mr. Williams had copied from “Got to Give It Up.” The Gaye estate contended that specific musical passages had been lifted. Lawyers for Mr. Thicke and Mr. Williams countered that they had simply created a genre piece with a similar groove and feel, the kind of thing that musicians — and copyright lawyers — had long considered fair game. In a dissenting opinion published when the case was upheld last year, Judge Jacqueline H. Nguyen of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit argued that the verdict allowed the Gaye estate “to accomplish what no one has done before: copyright a musical style.” Mr. Thicke was also a fickle witness. He had given interviews citing “Got to Give It Up” as inspiration for his song, only to deny it in depositions, saying he had been intoxicated when talking with music journalists. “I doubt if any more artists will tell Rolling Stone where they got their inspiration,” Tor Erik Hermansen, part of the songwriting and production duo Stargate, said in an interview. Although the case did not result in any changes to copyright law, it has had a palpable effect. More songwriters are arming themselves with expensive insurance policies. And musicologists — academically trained experts who sometimes consult in copyright cases — are in greater demand. “The phone rings more,” said Joe Bennett, a vice president at the Berklee College of Music who also works as an expert witness for hire. But, he added, “a huge number of the inquiries I get are spurious.” Songwriters now face heightened scrutiny of their work while it is still in progress, as record companies and music publishers sometimes vet new songs for echoes of past works. “I’ve had a couple experiences where I was writing something and a lawyer and musicologist said, ‘It sounds like this old song, it’s a very active estate, they’re going to come after you,’” said Mr. Mason, who has worked with stars like Whitney Houston and Kelly Clarkson. “I changed a few notes.” Any settlement can have significant consequences for writers. Just a sliver of streaming revenue is earmarked for songwriting royalties, and most pop songs these days involve small gangs of writers; adding more names to the credits dilutes individual earnings. Ross Golan, a songwriter who hosts the podcast “And the Writer Is ...,” complained that when it comes to negotiations over royalty changes, writers can be left out altogether. When “Talk About You,” a song he wrote with the pop singer Mika and another writer, was released in early 2015, Mr. Golan said, he was surprised to learn that his share of the royalties had been reduced, and that five new names had been added to the credits — all without his knowledge. Mr. Golan said he was furious, but the only action he could take was largely symbolic: refusing to grant permission for a few licensing deals down the line. “I would rather shelve my asset than have someone else sell my integrity,” he said. But Mika acknowledged that the deal was necessary. In a Facebook post at the time, he said that it was “immediately obvious” that “Talk About You” bore a resemblance to two older songs — “Sarà Perché Ti Amo,” a 1981 European hit by the Italian pop group Ricchi e Poveri, and “I Only Want to Be With You,” a widely covered 1963 earworm by Dusty Springfield — and that it was his choice to share credit with the writers of those songs. “Some music comes from no where, some is inspired by other songs and others totally reference them,” Mika wrote. “In that case its always good to be crystal clear before a record even comes out.” Mr. Golan said that what bothered him was less the existence of a deal than the fact that he had no say in it. “If there are/were similarities, they were beyond unintentional,” Mr. Golan wrote in an email. “We’d never heard those songs.” Christine Lepera, a longtime litigator, said there had been no substantial change in the number of music copyright claims that have reached the courts since “Blurred Lines.” But she added that the music industry’s worries over the decision had created a “self-fulfilling prophecy.” “There’s no question in my mind that there has been a chilling effect,” Ms. Lepera said. “People have thrown a lot of weight behind this — more weight than it deserves. Defendants may be more inclined not to put up a fight.” And for songwriters, the impact is still often felt when thoughts about the courtroom intrude in the studio. “I’m not going to stop writing songs,” said Busbee, who has written hits for Keith Urban and Lady Antebellum. “But it puts a massive damper on the process, if you’re concerned that you will be sued.” "

Those expecting a ho-hum Grammys night were surely jolted awake on Sunday when, just minutes into the show, Michelle Obama walked onto the stage hand-in-hand with Lady Gaga, Jada Pinkett Smith and Jennifer Lopez. They were joined by the host Alicia Keys. In the surprise appearance, which doubled as a moment of female solidarity the Grammys needed, Obama spoke to the crowd as it erupted in applause and cheers. “All right, all right, we got a show to do,” Obama, who wore a loose-fitting shimmering silver jumpsuit, said playfully when the audience wouldn’t settle down. [Here’s the full list of Grammys winners.] “From the Motown records I wore out on the South Side to the ‘who run the world’ songs that fueled me through this last decade, music has always helped me tell my story, and I know that’s true for everybody here,” she continued, referring to the Chicago neighborhood where she was raised. “Whether we like country or rap or rock, music helps us share ourselves, our dignity and sorrows, our hopes and joys. It allows us to hear one another, to invite each other in. Music shows us that all of it matters — every story within every voice, every note within every song. Is that right ladies?” she said as many in the crowd remained standing. The moment could not have come at a better time for the show. Last year, the event, which has struggled to stay relevant, came under fire for a statement made by Neil Portnow, the chief executive of the Recording Academy. Women in music should “step up” to advance their careers, he had said. The academy has since changed its membership and nominations process in efforts to address underlying problems of inequality. On Sunday night, the women onstage with Obama spoke about how music gave them a space to explore who they are. “They said I was weird, that my look, my choices, my sound, that it wouldn’t work,” Lady Gaga said. “But music told me not to listen to them. Music took my ears, took my hands, my voice and my soul, and it led me to all of you and to my Little Monsters who I love so much.” Next, Pinkett Smith spoke. “We express our pain, power, progress through music — whether we’re creating it, or just appreciating it,” she said. “But here’s what I know: Every voice we hear deserves to be honored and respected.” Lopez closed out the segment. “Back in the Bronx, music gave me a reason to dance, from hip-hop to freestyle, pop, soul and salsa,” she said. “It kept me moving from the block to the big stages and even bigger screens. It reminds me where I come from, but it also reminds me of all the places I can go. Music remains the one place we can all feel truly free.” [See all the looks from the Grammys red carpet.] "
5c69cf843a125f5075c0a2e8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/17/obituaries/u-tin-dead.html,"U Tin, a slide guitarist who became a global ambassador for Burmese music while working as a plumber under a military dictatorship, died on Feb. 5 in Yangon, Myanmar. He was 87. His daughter Daw Win Win Toe said the cause was complications of diabetes. Mr. Tin was one of several prominent Myanmar musicians who incorporated Western instruments into a diverse canon that spanned folk tunes, classical Burmese music linked to ancient royal courts, and songs from the country’s 1950s-era cinematic golden age. In addition to guitar, he played banjo, mandolin and Burmese harp. Mr. Tin moved to Yangon in 1947, a year before the country, then known as Burma, gained independence from Britain. He found work as a plumber and began studying music. After a military coup in 1962 plunged Myanmar into decades of isolation and extreme poverty, Mr. Tin kept his day job and mostly steered clear of the regime’s state-sponsored traditional music and dance troupes. But he kept playing music, and his reputation as a brilliant slide guitarist grew, thanks partly to people outside Myanmar who invited him to perform around the globe. U Tin was born in the southwestern town of Kyaik Lat on July 8, 1931, to U Ba Aye and Daw Than Yi, both farmers. When World War II broke out, many residents of nearby Yangon, then known as Rangoon, fled to the surrounding countryside as the city came under attack by Japanese bombers. Some of them turned up in Mr. Tin’s town, and they happened to be musicians. “I got the chance to learn from them,” he said years later. Mr. Tin’s main instrument was a steel resonator guitar, similar to one played in American blues and country music by performers like Jerry Douglas and Son House. He played it sitting down, with the fretboard lying over his lap. It is unclear precisely how these guitars, which have roots in Hawaiian music, made it to Myanmar. One influence appears to have been Tau Moe, a Samoan guitarist who had been educated in Hawaii and performed in Yangon in the late 1920s, said Kit Young, a Washington-based scholar of Burmese music and a founder of Gitameit Music Institute, a nonprofit community center and music school in Yangon. But Mr. Tin was not much interested in the American style. Instead, he tuned his guitar to a Burmese scale and played within the rich musical terrain he already knew. Traditional Burmese music, from the country’s Bamar ethnic majority, features gongs, drums, harps, oboes and bamboo xylophones, among other instruments. It typically has syncopated, staggered phrasing and a tonal system unfamiliar to most Western listeners. Over the years, Mr. Tin studied with some of Myanmar’s finest musicians, including the guitarists Weiza Ba Saw Gyi and U Sein Maung and the singer and harpist Daw Saw Mya Aye Kyi, who had herself learned from court musicians for King Thibaw, the country’s last king. He also played with several musicians who had made their name in Yangon’s post-independence cultural heyday. A video from 1961 shows him playing with the Burmese singer U Aunt Gyi (and two Americans) on the lawn of the American ambassador’s residence. “We called him the living music dictionary,” said U Ne Myo Aung, the director of Gitameit Music Institute. In addition to his daughter Daw Win Win Toe, Mr. Tin is survived by his wife, Daw Cho Cho; two other daughters, Daw Win Win Nwe and Daw Myint Myint Nwe; and six grandchildren. His three sons died before him. Mr. Tin won a number of national prizes and played on the Burma Broadcasting Service. But there was never much money in that, and he kept working as a plumber at the Yangon City Development Committee until he was 60. Ms. Young said that Mr. Tin did not “kowtow” to the military junta that ruled the country for decades, and that the regime would not have wanted to send him abroad because the slide guitar was not a traditional Burmese instrument. But in the twilight of his career, Mr. Tin was often invited privately to perform abroad as an ambassador of that very tradition. He performed in Japan, Thailand, Germany, the Philippines and elsewhere. Ms. Young said his performances often received rapturous receptions, including a 2003 concert at the Asia Society in New York City. “Everybody went bananas,” she said. In his later years, Mr. Tin also worked at Gitameit Music Institute. He saw his mission as to somehow keep the old songs he knew alive. But the younger generation was not interested, he told a reporter in 2010, around the time that a half-century of repressive military rule was beginning to ease. “If the music is lost,” he said, “Myanmar will lose a piece of its soul.” "

The police investigated him in 1993. Another accusation led to a trial in 2005 that became a pop culture spectacle, complete with crowds of supporters waiting outside the courthouse. Jackson was acquitted and died four years later while preparing for a string of concert dates he hoped would revive his career. A new documentary, “Leaving Neverland,” has rekindled interest in the accusations. The film had its debut at the Sundance Film Festival and airs on HBO March 3 and 4. [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] In August 1993, when Jackson was still a major star on the pop charts and touring to support his album “Dangerous,” the Los Angeles Police Department began investigating claims that Jackson had molested a 13-year-old boy. Executing search warrants for a condominium in Los Angeles and Jackson’s Neverland Ranch in Santa Barbara County, Calif., the police seized videotapes but found no incriminating evidence. On Sept. 14, while Jackson was on tour in Moscow, the boy’s parents sued the star, saying that Jackson had “repeatedly committed sexual battery” on their son. Among the accusations were that Jackson had performed oral sex on the boy and masturbated him. Anthony Pellicano, a private investigator working for Jackson, called the suit part of an extortion attempt. “A demand for $20 million was made and presented,” he said. “It was flatly and consistently refused.” (Years later, Pellicano, known as a top Hollywood “fixer,” was accused of making death threats against journalists, and in 2008 was sentenced to 15 years in prison for illegal wiretapping.) As the case drew headlines, the Jackson camp introduced the news media to children who gave interviews supporting the star. One, a 10-year-old boy named Wade Robson, told CNN about harmless “slumber parties” in Jackson’s bedroom. As prosecutors continued to pursue a criminal case, another boy, James Safechuck, who had appeared with Jackson in a Pepsi commercial, gave sworn testimony on Jackson’s behalf. On Dec. 20, 1993, Jackson was strip-searched by police at Neverland, and photographs were taken of his genitals to compare to a description given by the boy. Two days later, Jackson spoke on live television, denying the accusations and excoriating the news media. “I am not guilty of these allegations,” Jackson said. “But if I am guilty of anything, it is of giving all that I have to give to help children all over the world.” In January 1994, Jackson settled the case for $23 million, with $5 million going to the family’s lawyers. Prosecutors dropped the criminal case after the boy declined to cooperate. [Michael Jackson cast a spell. “Leaving Neverland” breaks it, our critic writes.] In February 2003, with Jackson’s music career in decline, the documentary “Living With Michael Jackson,” based on interviews by the journalist Martin Bashir, was broadcast in Britain and the United States. In it, Jackson openly discussed sharing his bedroom with a young cancer survivor, and called people who object to such behavior “ignorant.” The documentary sparked a criminal investigation, and in December, Jackson was charged with child molesting, serving alcohol to a minor, conspiracy and kidnapping. He faced up to 20 years in prison. Jackson’s trial began on Feb. 28, 2005. Throughout, the global news media paid close attention to Jackson’s erratic behavior, like arriving in floral pajamas. The boy from the documentary, who was 14 at the time of the trial, testified that Jackson had masturbated him. His brother said he had witnessed the abuse, and that Jackson had showed them both pornography and served them wine, calling it “Jesus juice.” A former housekeeper, Blanca Francia, said she had seen Jackson taking a shower with Wade Robson, the young man who had spoken to the media in support of Jackson in 1993. Jackson’s lawyers portrayed the boy at the center of the case and his family as practiced grifters, and several witnesses who had been close with Jackson as children — like the actor Macaulay Culkin, then 24 years old — took the stand to deny any abuse. Robson, by this point a choreographer for stars like Britney Spears, testified that he had spent the night at Neverland more than 20 times but that Jackson had never molested him or taken a shower with him. Safechuck, who had defended Jackson earlier, did not testify. Jackson was found not guilty of all charges on June 13, 2005; outside the courthouse, a fan released 10 white doves, one for each count that was acquitted. Jackson died four years later, at age 50, on the eve of a comeback attempt. [Will “Leaving Neverland” imperil the thriving Michael Jackson estate?] In 2013, four years after Jackson’s death, Robson sued the star’s estate, saying that Jackson had molested him for seven years, beginning when he was age 7. In an interview on the “Today” show, he said that “brainwashing” by Jackson had led him to testify on the star’s behalf. Lawyers for Jackson’s estate blasted Robson’s credibility, saying that in the past he had repeatedly denied abuse. Robson’s case was later thrown out by a judge for being filed too late. Safechuck filed his own suit in 2014, saying that Jackson had abused him “hundreds” of times from 1988 to 1992, beginning when a 10-year-old Safechuck — and his mother — accompanied Jackson on his “Bad” concert tour. According to his complaint, Jackson kissed Safechuck’s genitals and gave him jewelry as rewards for performing sexual acts. His case was also dismissed. Both men’s suits are under appeal. On Jan. 25, “Leaving Neverland,” a two-part, four-hour film by Dan Reed, with Robson and Safechuck describing accusations of abuse in great detail, opened at the Sundance Film Festival. Before the screening, the festival director told the audience that health care providers were available to help anyone disturbed by the film. The Jackson estate condemned the film as “yet another lurid production in an outrageous and pathetic attempt to exploit and cash in on Michael Jackson.” In a statement, the Jackson family called it “a public lynching” and added: “We are furious that the media, who without a shred of proof or single piece of physical evidence, chose to believe the word of two admitted liars over the word of hundreds of families and friends around the world who spent time with Michael, many at Neverland, and experienced his legendary kindness and global generosity.” The estate also filed a petition in Los Angeles Superior Court for arbitration against HBO, saying that with “Leaving Neverland” the channel was in breach of a nondisparagement clause in a 1992 contract for a Jackson concert film. The estate said it was seeking damages that “could exceed $100 million.” "
5c89607e49f0eacbf105ce3f,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/13/obituaries/michael-gielen-dead.html,"Michael Gielen, a probing conductor who championed contemporary music and daring opera productions, died on Friday at his home near Mondsee, Austria, east of Salzburg. He was 91. His death was confirmed by the German broadcaster SWR. Mr. Gielen was active mostly in Europe, and one of his most important posts was as general music director of the Frankfurt Opera, a job he held for a decade starting in 1977. There he gave the German premieres of works by Luigi Nono and Alban Berg, revived overlooked works by Ferruccio Busoni and Franz Schreker, and invited the most ambitious directors to stage standard repertory. Working with the dramaturge Klaus Zehelein, Mr. Gielen collaborated with Jürgen Flimm, Harry Kupfer, Hans Neuenfels (including for a pivotal “Aida” in 1980) and Ruth Berghaus, who produced Wagner’s “Ring” in notably symbolic fashion. In 1987, John Rockwell of The New York Times called the Frankfurt house “the most prominent exponent in the world of radical operatic stage direction and design.” Mr. Gielen was music director of the Cincinnati Symphony from 1980 to 1986, and his radical programming there alienated many. The next year he found a more congenial home back in Germany as chief conductor of the SWR Symphony Orchestra Baden-Baden, which became the SWR Symphony Orchestra Baden-Baden and Freiburg in 1996. That orchestra, backed by the resources of German state radio, gave him the freedom to promote the newest of music, especially at the Donaueschinger Musiktage, a festival in southern Germany for contemporary composers. He remained the orchestra’s permanent guest conductor after stepping down in 1999, and later protested its merger with a sister ensemble in Stuttgart. His SWR orchestra recordings included a particularly lucid Mahler cycle, the symphonies of Beethoven and Brahms, and pieces by Bruckner, Stravinsky and the composers of the Second Viennese School. All prized detail and restraint over overt emotionality. The conductor Daniel Barenboim, who knew Mr. Gielen for almost 70 years and appointed him principal guest conductor of the Staatskapelle Berlin in 1999, said in a telephone interview that Mr. Gielen had always been “in search of what he considered the musical truth, for the solutions that were given to him by the score — and not by outside ideas.” Mr. Gielen, who won the prestigious Ernst von Siemens Music Prize in 2010, viewed music as a disciplined intellectual pursuit that, more than providing comfort or entertainment, should shed light on the conflicts of the age, both in the world at large and in humanity’s inner life. He particularly argued for confronting the horrors of the mid-20th century, represented by Auschwitz and Hiroshima. “If musical life does not convey this central experience of our time, which is the ‘Age of Anxiety,’ ” he said, “then it is not a cultural life, but a cultural lie.” Mr. Gielen conveyed his views through programming. A typical ploy was to preface Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony with Schoenberg’s reflection on the Holocaust, “A Survivor From Warsaw.” He even inserted the piece between the symphony’s heavenly slow movement and its paean to human brotherhood, the “Ode to Joy.” In a program note for the Cincinnati Symphony, Mr. Gielen wrote, “The greatness of the Ninth, its beauty, the shattering horror of the fanfare that begins its finale, these can fully reach us today only when we confront the other side of man.” Michael Andreas Gielen was born on July 20, 1927, in Dresden. His mother, Rose Steuermann, was an actress and soprano noted for her account of Schoenberg’s “Pierrot Lunaire;” his father, Josef Gielen, was a director at the city’s state theater, entrusted by Richard Strauss with the premieres of “Arabella” and “Die Schweigsame Frau.” Though their mother was Jewish, Michael and his older sister, Carola, were baptized as Catholics in 1935, but the Nazis hounded them all the same. They followed their father first to Berlin, then to Vienna, and finally to Buenos Aires, in 1940. In Argentina, Mr. Gielen was brought up among an exiled musical elite. He studied piano and composition under Erwin Leuchter, who had been Anton Webern’s assistant, and heard the operatic repertoire under the baton of Fritz Busch. After he withdrew from the University of Buenos Aires in 1946 and became a coach at the Teatro Colón, Mr. Gielen rehearsed “Tristan und Isolde” with the soprano Kirsten Flagstad and the conductor Erich Kleiber in 1948. When Wilhelm Furtwängler led Bach’s “St. Matthew Passion in 1950, Mr. Gielen played the recitatives. Again following his father, Mr. Gielen returned to Europe in 1950, and to the Vienna State Opera, where he assisted Clemens Krauss, Dmitri Mitropoulos and Karl Böhm. He continued to compose, and his Variations for String Quartet (1949) were performed in Darmstadt, the home of postwar experimentalism. But podium opportunities proved more alluring, and Mr. Gielen became a staff conductor at the opera, leading everything from Mozart to Honegger. As the music director of the Royal Swedish Opera from 1960 to 1965, Mr. Gielen oversaw a radical production of Stravinsky’s “The Rake’s Progress,” with Ingmar Bergman directing. As a guest conductor Mr. Gielen had a string of successes in famously challenging new music, overseeing the premieres in 1965 alone of Gyorgy Ligeti’s Requiem in Stockholm, Aribert Reimann’s “Traumspiel” in Kiel and, in Cologne, Bernd Alois Zimmermann’s “Die Soldaten,” a major but neglected work of the last century. He was at the helm of the Belgian National Orchestra from 1969 to 1973 and the Netherlands Opera from 1973 to 1975. Survivors include his wife, Helga Gielen, a soprano he married in 1957; their two children, Claudia and Lucas; and several grandchildren. Among Mr. Gielen’s compositions was “Pflicht und Neigung” (1988), which he recorded together with works by Schoenberg, Berg, Webern and Eduard Steuermann, his uncle, as a tribute to those 20th-century figures. The title translates to “Duty and Inclination.” “In order to make musical life meaningful, profoundly meaningful,” he told The Times in 1982, “one needs this kind of music as part of the program. I cannot live with the conscience of the truth being there waiting to be said and not being said.” "
5c2ff71c3a125f5075c02eda,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/arts/music/surviving-r-kelly.html,"For more than two decades, the R&B singer Robert Kelly, who performs as R. Kelly, has faced accusations of sexual misconduct and abuse. This week, a six-part documentary on Lifetime is taking an expansive look at the allegations against Mr. Kelly, a chart-topping artist whose history has invited extra scrutiny in recent years. The series, “Surviving R. Kelly,” includes testimony from several women who accuse the singer of abuse, as well as commentary from Mr. Kelly’s critics, including the founder of the #MeToo movement, Tarana Burke, and the singer John Legend. The six episodes, each an hour long, cover the long history of allegations against Mr. Kelly. They feature women who described being controlled or abused by him, often when they were teenagers, as well as associates and relatives of the singer. Mr. Kelly has continuously denied the allegations against him. The documentary has become the subject of widespread attention and fierce debate on social media, with many expressing gratitude to the women who continue to tell their stories. “I wish that he would experience a kind of social death, and that people who still vociferously declare him innocent — or their favorite artist, or worthy of having his work separated from who he is — that they are denied that,” said dream hampton, an executive producer of the documentary. The six parts of the series were scheduled over three days of broadcast, from Thursday through Saturday. The third and fourth episodes focused on Mr. Kelly’s 2008 child pornography trial and the sex tape at its center. The fifth and sixth episodes examine more recent allegations and follow parents who were trying to free their daughters from Mr. Kelly’s influence, Ms. hampton said. While some fans of Mr. Kelly still defend him, many critics say that he has escaped the consequences of his actions for far too long. “No one cared because we were black girls,” the writer Mikki Kendall said in the documentary. [Here is a timeline of the accusations against Mr. Kelly.] Ms. hampton agreed that race was an integral part of this story. She added that black boys and girls in the United States were often perceived as older than they are, and mentioned Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old boy who was shot and killed by a police officer in Cleveland in 2014. “We know black boys are perceived to be older than they are by police, and we absolutely do an equivalent thing to black girls,” Ms. hampton said in an interview Friday. “We perceive them to be more sexual at an early age. We perceive them to be older. And that is rooted — there is no other way to say it, and it’s not hyperbole to say — it’s absolutely rooted in this country’s history of slavery, which has gone on longer than it hasn’t.” Mr. Kelly was still featured as an artist on the RCA website on Saturday. The label did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and a representative for Sony Music, which oversees RCA Records, declined to comment. Mr. Kelly’s management also declined to comment. His team has previously said it would “vigorously resist this attempted public lynching of a black man who has made extraordinary contributions to our culture.” Mr. Kelly is not currently facing criminal charges. In 1994, when Mr. Kelly was 27, he married Aaliyah Haughton, who was 15 but was listed as 18 on a wedding certificate, according to Vibe Magazine. The marriage was annulled in 1995. Ms. Haughton, who was a popular singer in her own right, died in a plane crash in 2001. Mr. Kelly was accused of having sex with a teenager in a lawsuit in 1996, and again in 2001. Both lawsuits were settled, but the music critic Jim DeRogatis, who reported on them, continued to investigate the accusations against Mr. Kelly. [Here is a New York Times Popcast interview with Mr. DeRogatis.] In the documentary, people who knew R. Kelly claim that during the 1990s and 2000s, associates of the famous singer knew that he liked to prey on underage girls. In 2002, a video that appeared to show Mr. Kelly having sex with a teenage girl and urinating in her mouth was sent to Mr. DeRogatis at The Chicago Sun-Times, which reported that the footage was being investigated by the Chicago police. Later that year, Mr. Kelly was indicted by a grand jury in Chicago for child pornography. He pleaded not guilty, and for more than five years his case did not make it to trial. During that time he released albums including “Chocolate Factory,” which contained the chart-topping song “Ignition (Remix).” Arguments in the 2008 trial centered on whether the man shown in the video was indeed Mr. Kelly, and whether the girl’s identity or her age could be verified. The jury decided that the girl, who did not testify, could not be identified, and Mr. Kelly was found not guilty. In the documentary, one juror was asked about the women who had said, during the trial, that they also were victimized by Mr. Kelly when they were young. “I just didn’t believe them, the women,” the juror answered. “I know it sounds ridiculous. The way they dress, the way they act — I didn’t like them.” For years after the trial, Mr. Kelly continued to perform. In 2017, an article by Mr. DeRogatis in BuzzFeed News reported on allegations that the singer was controlling several young women by taking away their phones and limiting contact with their families. That same year, a campaign of protests, in person and on social media under the hashtag #MuteRKelly, began to pick up steam. In 2018, Spotify announced that it would remove Mr. Kelly from its official playlists, though his music would remain on the streaming platform. A screening of the Lifetime documentary in Manhattan last month was called off after anonymous threats were called in to the venue, CNN reported. The documentary’s producers include Ms. hampton, Tamra Simmons, Brie Miranda Bryant, Joel Karsberg and Jesse Daniels, according to Lifetime. Some of the people featured in the documentary, including Mr. Legend and the columnist Jamilah Lemieux, have pointed people to organizations like A Long Walk Home, a Chicago-based nonprofit working to end violence against girls and women; and Girls for Gender Equity, a nonprofit that has created a guide for viewers of the documentary, including those who are survivors of sexual assault.

Its very few lyrics counsel isolation and detachment for fear of provoking that “ill wind.” They’re set to one of Radiohead’s morose bossa novas, at first akin to “Knives Out”: a nest of minor-key counterpoint on guitar and bass. But then more layers arrive, fluty sounds and buzzy ones, swallowing the song before prettily fading out. What seemed like a sanctuary was a trap. JON PARELES More seemingly left field but in fact totally harmonious cross-genre collaborations in 2019, please. The young country star Kane Brown brings adds an earthy sincerity to Khalid’s soothing delivery of angst on this remix of “Saturday Nights,” and Juice WRLD drizzles his melodically sweet melancholy on Halsey’s impressively stern scold “Without Me.” JON CARAMANICA Adia Victoria, a songwriter from South Carolina who’s now based in Nashville, offers a terse taxonomy of breakups in “Different Kind of Love,” from her second album due next month. “Some of them I knew it best to hesitate/Some I’ve never seen again,” she notes. The setting seems retro at first: a hypnotic rockabilly shuffle with a hefty backbeat and plenty of reverb on the guitar, soon to be punched up by a saxophone section. But it’s not back-to-basics: extra guitars and other, more elusive sounds thicken the mix, as Victoria gets around to a classic, nonnegotiable demand: “Tell me, who do you love?” PARELES The pop-punk trio Pottymouth, three women who have been working together since their teens, confronts aging with a galloping punk-rock beat in — really, this is not a high number — “22.” Abby Weems sings, “Oh, 22 — I still do what I used to do.” And why not? Their speed and passion haven’t faded. PARELES Two Washington, D.C. trios that aren’t afraid to think and rock at the same time are returning this spring: Ex Hex’s “It’s Real” is due March 22 and Priests’ “The Seduction of Kansas” will be released on April 5. Priests’ title track is like a semiotics class set to an arty dance beat: the singer Katie Alice Greer flings around signifiers of American culture — Superman, Dorothy, Applebee’s — before repeating a vow that teeters between genuine and controlling: “It’s true, I’m the one that loves you.” Ex Hex, led by Helium and Wild Flag’s Mary Timony, start off with a surfy bop that glances back to the Ramones’ interpretation of girl-group pop. Their lips aren’t sealed. CARYN GANZ A stark stunner from Lana Del Rey, narrating as someone who’s “24/7 Sylvia Plath/Writing in blood on your walls/‘Cause the ink in my pen don’t look good in my pad.” The arrangement is minimal piano, haunting as an empty, dark cave. And Del Rey spins into deliciously morbid, almost absurdist lyrics: “Hello, it’s the most famous woman you know on the iPad/Calling from beyond the grave, I just wanna say, ‘Hi, Dad.’” CARAMANICA A random rebound hookup: That’s the premise of “Dancing with a Stranger.” It isn’t much of a duet; it’s more like a pair of solos telling parallel stories. “Look what you made me do/I’m with somebody new,” Sam Smith and Normani sing together, while they head off to separate trysts. PARELES The Weeknd is back to his louche ways on “Lost in the Fire,” the second single from “Hyperion,” the forthcoming album by the gloomy French electro-house producer Gesaffelstein. The mood is overcast 1980s Miami, and the singing blends empathy with eroticism. No one is better than the Weeknd at underscoring the trauma common to both. CARAMANICA The Texas bluesman Gary Clark Jr. announces that he’s “paranoid and pissed-off” as he charges into the title song of his coming album, “This Land,” declaring that he’s bought himself 50 acres “right in the middle of Trump country” and is braced for racist neighbors: “I see you looking out your window/Can’t wait to call the police on me.” All the tones are confrontational and raw: a distorted bass line, Clark’s not-always-in-tune lead guitar, his gruff voice, an underlying blues-meets-reggae riff. The video imagery invokes slavery, lynchings, Confederate flags and cross-burning bonfires. “I’m America’s son,” he taunts. “This is where I come from.” PARELES Here is the #MeToo movement in action, simultaneously methodical and melodic. The midtempo folk-rock behind Stella Donnelly’s voice doesn’t telegraph her fury, but she’s reading a self-defense manual and preparing to execute painful moves against someone — married, prosperous, powerful — who is acting inappropriately. “Are you scared of me old man,” she sings, “or are you scared of what I’ll do?” PARELES Kassa Overall’s new album — the irreverently titled “Go Get Ice Cream and Listen to Jazz” — attests to the diverse musical identity of this drummer, producer and rapper. It’s one of the few genuine-sounding, full-scope amalgams of contemporary hip-hop and jazz to surface in recent years. On “Who’s on the Playlist,” as the pianist Sullivan Fortner traces the chords to Miles Davis and Bill Evans’s “Blue in Green,” Overall, 36, daubs his snare drum with brushes, then adds a splatter of electronic percussion. He starts the track with a mumbly, ironic Master P quote before cracking a window into his heart on a verse that grows tensile and urgent before stopping up short. Judi Jackson, a young British jazz singer, shows that the interdisciplinary spirit is contagious — or at least, generational: She sings in an Erykah Badu purr for most of the song, then rattles off a cold rap verse. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO “Human,” an electronic instrumental by the Swedish composer Tomas Nordmark, has a meditative, nearly ambient foundation: sustained, consonant tones like distant horns. But the foreground is jittery, full of unpredictable, glassy tones that briefly hover, then disappear. Mood: inscrutable. PARELES "
5cad171949f0eacbf1f821b7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/09/movies/amazing-grace-aretha-franklin-sydney-pollack.html,"Late in 1971, some unlikely news spread among the Southern California Community Choir in Los Angeles. Aretha Franklin was coming to town to record a live gospel album in January, and 25 of its members would be backing her up. The group was led by one of the most famous gospel figures of the era, the Rev. James Cleveland, but its singers were local churchgoing Angelenos. Mary Hall, an alto, was 22. “The reverend just said, ‘You be at rehearsal, and you be at rehearsal,’” she said in an interview last month. “I couldn’t believe I was getting ready to sing with the Queen of Soul. It’s still one of the greatest moments in my life.” That moment — an electrifying two-night session before live audiences at the New Temple Missionary Baptist Church in Watts — resulted in Franklin’s “Amazing Grace,” the best-selling gospel record in history, featuring now-canonical arrangements of gospel standards like “How I Got Over” and “What a Friend We Have in Jesus.” Less known until recently was that the performances were also filmed: a collaboration as ambitious and as bungled as only Hollywood could manage, buried for decades by red tape and a monster technical error. But with last weekend’s wide theatrical release of “Amazing Grace,” fans can finally immerse themselves in the full cinematic experience. [Read our review, in which Wesley Morris calls “Amazing Grace” “one of the great music films.”] The project sprouted at the confluence of several cultural currents at the beginning of the 1970s. Edwin Hawkins’s R&B crossover hit “Oh Happy Day” had helped bring gospel into mainstream in 1969. And by 1971, Franklin, who had grown up as a touring gospel singer, was one of the biggest stars in pop music, with a list of hit singles including “Respect,” “Think” and “Chain of Fools.” If anyone could capitalize on that moment, it was Franklin, then 29. Having signed a few years earlier with Atlantic Records, she teamed with one of the label’s star producers, Jerry Wexler, who had helped catapult the careers of artists like Ray Charles and Wilson Pickett. The plan was to make a double album. “Jerry was smart enough to understand that it would be a statement as to her imprimatur as an artist,” said the producer Alan Elliott, who worked for years to resurrect the film. “And he empowered her by making her his co-producer.” Plans for a concert film were also underway: Documentaries like “Monterey Pop,” by D.A. Pennebaker (1968), and “Woodstock,” by Michael Wadleigh (1970), had become cultural phenomena. Executives at Warner Bros., which had purchased Atlantic in 1967, hoped an “Amazing Grace” documentary might help do for gospel what Woodstock had done for pop, Elliott said. To film it, Warner hired the director Sydney Pollack, a rising star still riding the success of his 1969 movie “They Shoot Horses, Don’t They?” Pollack was between projects and had campaigned with executives for the job. Joe Boyd, who had been hired by Warner to pair Atlantic artists with Warner film projects, had already been tasked with putting together a 16 mm film crew. He shared his misgivings with executives about using Pollack. “Shooting a concert film is a very different kettle of fish from shooting a drama,” Boyd said in an interview, relating what he told Warner. “And it’s a very different skill.” But Pollack’s star power won out. Boyd took his cue. “I kind of stood back and let it happen,” he said. [Read more about why the film lay buried for nearly a half-century.] Franklin and her team busied themselves with the music. Rehearsals started a month in advance at Cornerstone Institutional Baptist Church, in Los Angeles, where James Cleveland, a childhood mentor of Franklin’s, ran the show. Franklin was to provide a rhythm section, flown in from New York, many of whom had been members of King Curtis’s band, including the drummer Bernard Purdie, the bassist Chuck Rainey and the guitarist Cornell Dupree. Cleveland was to provide his choir and accompany Franklin on piano. He hired a charismatic 27-year-old named Alexander Hamilton to direct the choir. Hamilton said that Cleveland had hired him in part for his “steel trap” memory. “I would ask Aretha what she was definitely trying to get in the song — certain licks that she wanted to do,” he said. “She would say where she wanted the licks, and when, and I would make sure that it happened.” The resulting performance was transporting, Pollack’s footage a visceral, unmediated document of a music freighted with suffering and bursting with joy. Sweat and tears stream down Franklin’s face. Cleveland sobs. Old women bolt from their seats, convulsing in the aisles. As word of Franklin’s presence spread, the modestly sized audience of Night 1 swelled past capacity inside the sweltering church on Night 2, spilling into the aisles. The Rev. C.L. Franklin, her father, hurried to Los Angeles for a front-row seat — and to deliver a lengthy speech. The renowned gospel singer Clara Ward sat next to him in a sequin dress. Mick Jagger and Charlie Watts of the Rolling Stones, who shared a label with Aretha Franklin and were in town working on “Exile on Main Street,” also stopped by, inching their way toward the front as the session progressed. But just as Boyd feared, Pollack and his crew made a critical error. They failed to use clapperboards, according to multiple people involved in the production, which meant the footage couldn’t be synchronized with the sound. Pollack hired Hamilton to lip-read the footage in attempts to match it. But not even Hamilton could sync more than a small percentage. The team gave up after about six weeks, Hamilton said. “They hadn’t prepared for it to be what it turned out to be,” he said. The session had simply become too chaotic. “The place became electric.” Elliott, who had worked as a music producer under Wexler, first learned about the footage from him in 1990 and had never forgotten about it. In search of a new project, Elliott acquired the assets from Warner Bros. Films in 2008, with Pollack’s blessing. Pollack, who died that same year, never saw the film completed. With advances in digital technology, Elliott was soon able to synchronize the footage. But there was another roadblock: Franklin herself. Publicly, she said she loved the film. But she sued multiple times to prevent its being seen. Rainey, the bassist, who said that he talked to Franklin twice a year by phone until she died last year, said she told him that she didn’t like the film at all. He thought her resistance derived from a feeling that the film wound up being more about style and celebrity than about the music or the worship — or even about Franklin. “The film, to me, is all about James Cleveland, her father, Clara Ward,” he added. “It was like she was wallpaper.” As the legal complications persisted, Elliott appealed to Franklin’s niece Sabrina Owens, the executor of Franklin’s estate, in search of support inside Franklin’s family. Owens was enthusiastic. After Franklin’s death, a path was cleared, and the film received a limited release in late 2018. “The moment I saw the film for the first time three years ago, I knew others needed to see it,” Owens said. Hall, the choir singer, had always thought so. “This shows how we sang in our churches,” she said. “And for young people that never got to hear Aretha and see Aretha — to know the quality of how masterful she was in her gift, and to know how she loved God — it’s very important for people to see that.” "

The country had only been in the conflict for 19 months, but it had already adjusted to the rhythms and strictures of a society on a total-war footing. When it ended so abruptly, the result was a sudden permissiveness in the culture, a weakening of social rules and an opening for new ideas, creating a fertile atmosphere for America’s new, unruly musical child: jazz.  What was jazz? It had no real definition; it referred to many things. The year 1919 is usually not considered an important marker on the jazz timeline, but that year subtle yet compelling forces took hold that would turn this invasive novelty into something with far more clarity and promise as an art form. It was the year jazz came into its own. Feb. 17, 1919, was a cold, overcast New York day that threatened snow. Tens of thousands of people had come to the streets of Manhattan for a victory parade. At the corner of Fifth Ave. 60th Street, a crowd packed the sidewalks and clustered onto a grandstand, vying for a glimpse of the returning heroes parading northward.  Along the route marched the 369th Infantry, a highly decorated all-black regiment that had just returned from a year in France. The Germans, whom they flushed from their trenches, called them “blutdürstige schwarze Männer,” or “bloodthirsty black men” — or more respectfully, “Hellfighters.” The French government gave the unit the Croix de Guerre for its bravery. On cue, the cheering crowd fell into an abrupt hush, as line upon line of soldiers appeared, proceeding in immaculate precision. “For a moment there was almost complete silence, as the throngs of men and women gazed upon the dark-skinned warriors who had beaten the best regiments of veterans the enemy could send them,” wrote The New York Tribune.  Nearly all accounts of the parade singled out the 369th’s band, under the direction of Lt. James Reese Europe, an immensely successful and well-known African-American musician. The press consistently referred to them as a “jazz band,” whose “jazz music” had become the sensation of France. Even Gen. Henri Gouraud, a staid and dignified French commander, was enthralled, and made his headquarters wherever the band was stationed. Lieutenant Europe was already known as the “Jazz King.” Such praise marked the first time anything associated with jazz had received such glowing approval. In 1919, jazz, or “jass,” as some still called it, was a peculiar word with musical and sexual connotations. It could be noun, verb or adjective, indicating pep, liveliness and noise. Jazz was the new counterculture dance music replacing ragtime — but more dangerous, disorderly and discordant, consisting of random, wrong-sounding musical obstreperousness and percussive turmoil. The music had been considered a scourge on polite society, particularly by whites, even if many of them had no idea what the word meant. Now, thousands — both white and black — cheered Europe’s “jazz” band. They kept the “jazz music” under wraps at first. Marching along, Europe kept his men reined in, playing dignified military music, matching the solemnity and discipline of the moment. But as they passed 60th Street, where the crowd became more and more densely populated with African-Americans, the band let loose with “That Moaning Trombone” and other syncopated numbers. Verve and enthusiasm stood in bold relief.  James Reese Europe was born in 1881 in Mobile, Ala., and raised in Washington, D.C., where he studied violin, piano and composition. In 1903, he relocated to New York, seeking work as a musical director and composer. There he associated with the black musical cognoscenti of Manhattan, including Bert Williams, J. Rosamond Johnson and Bob Cole. He became New York society’s favorite band leader, charming the likes of the Vanderbilts, and was musical director for Vernon and Irene Castle, a popular pair of white dancers. Along the way he mentored a string of future musical stars, like Noble Sissle and Eubie Blake. Although historians often associate Europe with ragtime and jazz, his focus was on neither. He wanted to create music that he believed reflected the artistic temperament and souls of African-Americans, whatever style it took, and to use it to promote the validity and viability of Negro musicians. In 1910 he formed the Clef Club, a union for New York’s black musicians, along with the enormous Clef Club Symphony Orchestra, which emphasized instruments that he felt were commonly used by black musicians: banjo, mandolin, bandora and harp guitar. In interviews, Europe avoided the word “ragtime,” simply calling it “Negro music.” The orchestra performed lavish concerts — several at Carnegie Hall — featuring works by black composers like Will Marion Cook, William H. Tyers and Europe himself. It played marches, concert pieces, tangos and waltzes, with a sprinkling of ragtime. Europe’s reputation as a purveyor of ragtime and “proto jazz” is based on recordings made in 1913 and 1914. Of these, “Castle House Rag,” a Europe composition, captures our imagination today, offering a rare glimpse into black dance music, partly read and partly played by ear. Exciting and edgy, it has hints of “Shortenin’ Bread” and what might be described as “country ragtime.”  Few who heard Europe’s music were acquainted with the dance music then brewing in New Orleans, which some regarded as “ragtime played by ear.” Because it went largely unrecorded during the 1910s, it would be years before the rest of the country could hear the rhythmic drive and hot quality of its pioneers, like King Oliver, Freddie Keppard and Jelly Roll Morton. One exception was the Original Dixieland Jazz Band, who made a recording in 1917 that was listened to from California to New York. Many musicians tried to copy their seemingly discordant approach, and failed. Most couldn’t hear, beneath that mélange, the band’s harmonic and rhythmic order, spontaneous sounding counterpoint and interlocking parts. Musicians copied the effects — the musical veneer. Capturing musical essence was a far more complex task than aping the obvious. And yet 1919 was the year when that began to change. In March, the Original Dixieland Jazz Band sailed for England, to tour British theaters. While there, they rerecorded a number of their old hits, along with two waltzes, unlikely choices for a New Orleans jazz band. Still, those recordings, “Alice Blue Gown” and “I’m Forever Blowing Bubbles,” have the propulsion and lilt that characterized New Orleans. More and more people, far outside New Orleans, were suddenly hearing, and enjoying, jazz. As they did, New York bands began to get the swing of the music. In March 1919, a group from Coney Island called the Original Memphis Five emerged with a streamlined version of the Original Dixieland Jazz Band’s style. They made hundreds of recordings between 1921 and 1929.  Nineteen-nineteen was also the year that a young cornetist named Louis Armstrong, who had been electrifying patrons of New Orleans saloons and honky-tonks with his distinctive sound, began to set his sights beyond his hometown. Armstrong possessed a rare gift for fusing disparate types of music that moved him — he had command over the passion of blues, excitement of ragtime, and the poignancy of operatic and classical melodies. His was the unnamed music of New Orleans: organic, confident and sincere. Playing on Mississippi riverboats, his horn was heard for the first time outside of New Orleans. Inevitably, young musicians like the trombonist Jack Teagarden and the cornetist Bix Beiderbecke heard Armstrong; within a few years, both of these young men would emerge as jazz originals in their own right. Armstrong had received much of his early experience working in the band led by trombonist Edward Ory, known as Kid. Ory's contribution to early jazz was in creating one of the most fundamental voices of the jazz band: a style known as “tailgate trombone,” which became the model for most that followed. Ory left New Orleans in August 1919 for California. He soon settled in Oakland, leading a fine jazz band at the Creole Café. In the summer of 1922, Ory’s band would become the first black New Orleans jazz band to make recordings. Armstrong’s mentor, Joe Oliver, moved to Chicago in 1917. By 1919 he was one of the busiest musicians in town, giving Chicago a taste of the Crescent City’s hot music. In 1922 he sent for Armstrong to join his Creole Jazz Band as the second cornetist. The 1923 King Oliver recordings would spread New Orleans music — some called it “jazz” — throughout the land.  On the very day of the 369th’s parade, 2,900 miles to the west, a struggling dance orchestra leader named Paul Whiteman was recovering from a nervous breakdown. A violinist formerly with the San Francisco Symphony, Whiteman had become fascinated with the sensuous, unpolished sounds he heard from musicians in Barbary Coast saloons. He attempted to notate this strange music, orchestrate it and normalize it. Hiring the best “jazzers” in town, Whiteman formed a dance band to play at the Fairmont Hotel. Taxed by overworked and worry, he collapsed, and soon left music, and San Francisco, behind. But he didn’t stay gone. Whiteman moved east, in 1920, and drew national attention when he signed a contract with the Victor Talking Machine Company. Striving to “make a lady” of jazz led to his fabulous 1924 concert “An Experiment in Modern Music,” which premiered Gershwin’s “Rhapsody in Blue.” Whiteman became known as the “King of Jazz,” a moniker which — while he never took it literally — served him well. He went on to hire Frank Trumbauer, Beiderbecke and others, a dream team of young jazz musicians. By the mid-1920s, jazz was firmly in place as the reigning American popular music style. All that was in the future as Europe and the 369th wrapped up their parade through Manhattan. Soon afterward they were mustered out of the service. For most, there was no question what they would do next: Reforming the band as civilians, they set out to tour the East Coast and Midwest. According to a review of their show in Philadelphia, The Evening Bulletin wrote: “Many ragtime, jazz time and popular air tunes were played with a swing, a swerve and a tempo that lifted the soul as well as the feet of the listener and carried him away to the Land of Shuffling Feet.” Though they were praised for their jazz, Europe and his band ranged widely. He typically programmed light classical overtures, specialties like “Evolution of Dixie,” some ragtime, and medleys of syncopated hits under the rubric “A Potpourri of Jazz.” A recording of a medley they often played on the road, “Plantation Echoes,” contains not a speck of jazz, or ragtime, by anyone’s definition. But the crowds demanded jazz, and Europe gave it to them — not only on the stage, but in interviews, where he tried to explain this new form. As he told The Newark Evening Ledger, “Lots of people think jazz is easy. It’s as hard as anything. The French bandmasters thought we had trick instruments. They’d ask to examine our instruments and then cry in surprise ‘Meme que les autres’ — ‘The same as the others.’ You see we get those special effects with a roll of the tongue and blowing the instrument about twice as hard as usual.” Europe’s comments reflected commonly held beliefs about jazz: It was about effects, such as distorting the embouchure to produce fluttering effects. Europe was a master tactician, and provided good copy. The band’s recording of “Memphis Blues” illustrates their approach to jazz. The final minute displays many of the effects Europe described: crying clarinets, flutter-tongued cornets, trombone glissandos and a “shave and a haircut” ending. There is one exception: a surprise solo “break” by a trombonist who tosses off an insouciant, swinging phrase. That break, only two measures long, speaks volumes: a rarity on such an early recording, signifying the exciting nature of jazz as it was still maturing. On May 9, 1919, the band arrived in Boston, to perform at Mechanic’s Hall. Europe, suffering from a cold and exhaustion, courageously pushed himself through the concert’s first half. During intermission, an altercation erupted when a disgruntled musician entered Europe’s dressing room and attacked him with a penknife. The injury, which seemed at first superficial, was anything but. Europe died a few hours later.   In a flash, James Reese Europe was gone, the band broke up, and postwar excitement and acceptance for jazz were temporarily forgotten. Nevertheless, Europe’s final testament had a lasting legacy. During that final tour, a wide range of Americans had begun to realize that jazz was something of which they could be proud. Photos from the parade, with jazz-playing musicians surrounded by returning soldiers, made it clear that this was a homegrown, even patriotic, art form. The old notion about “jazzing” suddenly seemed quaint. “Jazz” had become a noun. Europe’s dream, to see African-Americans accepted as serious and respected performers, lived on through his two closest associates, Noble Sissle and Eubie Blake. Their 1921 Broadway hit “Shuffle Along” was in a sense, a tribute to their mentor and friend. Looking at 1919 from both sides of a timeline clarifies how pivotal this year was for jazz. On one side there was the diligent, focused work of James Reese Europe, which brought dignity to both African-American musicians and jazz. On the other, Paul Whiteman continued his work legitimizing jazz in the public’s mind. In the middle were the pioneers of the art: Louis Armstrong, his mentors and disciples. Encompassing a span of a decade in a single year, 1919 was the fulcrum of momentous musical activity when jazz — in many forms and many definitions — was nurtured, whether by Europe, Whiteman or the growing number of jazz musicians who understood it.

5cafbd0149f0eacbf1f831dc,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/obituaries/earl-thomas-conley-dead.html,"NASHVILLE — Earl Thomas Conley, one of the most popular and prolific country singers of the 1980s, died here on Wednesday. He was 77. Carole Scates, his partner for more than 20 years, said the cause was cerebral atrophy. Mr. Conley had 24 Top 10 country singles in the ’80s, several of which he wrote or co-wrote, including 18 that reached No. 1. Only two artists that decade topped the country charts more times than he did: the vocal group Alabama, which had 27 No. 1 singles, and the singer Ronnie Milsap, who had 23. All but one of Mr. Conley’s No. 1 hits were recorded for RCA, starting with “Somewhere Between Right and Wrong” in 1982. Many of Mr. Conley’s songs, among them “Holding Her and Loving You” and “Don’t Make It Easy for Me,” both No. 1 hits, plumbed the complexity of romantic relationships. Abounding with sincerity, his rich, smoky baritone was well suited to his material, which appealed primarily to adult audiences, much like the vintage country and soul music of the 1960s and ’70s. Mr. Conley’s affinity for soul music was evident on many of his recordings, maybe nowhere as much as on “Too Many Times,” a 1986 duet with Anita Pointer of the Grammy Award-winning Pointer Sisters. That record reached No. 2 on the country chart and earned Mr. Conley an invitation, rare for a country artist, to perform the song with Ms. Pointer on the R&B-themed television show “Soul Train.” “There was such soul in everything he did,” Joe Galante, who was chief executive of RCA Nashville from 1982 to 1990, said in an interview with The Daily Tennessean. “You always talk about finding something unique,” Mr. Galante continued. “His voice certainly was that.” Mr. Conley placed an average of two singles a year on the country charts in the 1980s, on his way to becoming an inspiration to future country hitmakers like Randy Travis and Blake Shelton. By the early ’90s, with the rise of new stars like Garth Brooks and Shania Twain, sales of Mr. Conley’s records had dropped, and he received less and less airplay, prompting him to take an extended break from touring and recording. He resurfaced again in 1998, and, though he never achieved the kind of success he had in the ’80s, he was active into this decade. Earl Thomas Conley, the third of eight children, was born on Oct. 17, 1941, in Portsmouth, Ohio, a small town across the Ohio River from Kentucky, to Ruth (Davis) and Arthur Conley. When his father lost his job with the railroad, Earl, then 14, moved in with one of his older sisters. He was offered a scholarship to attend art school but opted instead to join the Army, where he first began writing songs and singing in public. After his discharge, Mr. Conley worked for the railroad and in steel mills while traveling to and from Ohio and Nashville to write songs with the producer Dick Heard. Their song “Smokey Mountain Memories” became a Top 40 country hit for the honky-tonk singer Mel Street in 1975. The next year Conway Twitty had a No. 1 country hit with Mr. Conley’s “This Time I’ve Hurt Her More Than She Loves Me.” In 1981, after an unproductive stint recording for Warner Bros. Records, Mr. Conley had his first No. 1 hit, a song he wrote called “Fire & Smoke,” released on the independent Sunbird label. In addition to Ms. Scates, Mr. Conley is survived by his brothers, Fred and Steve; his sisters, Ronda Hodges and Becky Miller; a son, Ty, and a daughter, Amy Edmisten, from his marriage to Sandra Smith, which ended in divorce; two younger daughters, Kat Scates and Erinn Scates; and five grandchildren. A versatile stylist, Mr. Conley was as much at home with the Appalachian music of his childhood as with rock- and soul-inflected arrangements. He recorded tradition-steeped duets with Emmylou Harris (“We Believe in Happy Endings”) and Keith Whitley (“Brotherly Love”). “My stuff started with bluegrass music,” Mr. Conley once explained in an interview. “That’s what inspired me, the people that came out of those hills in West Virginia and Kentucky. And, of course, Hank Williams Sr. down in Alabama. “I was born in ’41, and I was raised up on that early stuff,” he went on. “Coming out of those mountains, there’s a different soul and a different feeling and a whole different deal than what it would be like to come from the city.” "
5ca6431549f0eacbf1f80f0d,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/04/arts/design/whitney-museum-nam-june-paik.html,"Many of the works in “Programmed: Rules, Codes and Choreographies in Art, 1965-2018,” an exhibition at the Whitney Museum, require an electrical outlet. The presentation — drawn mostly from the museum’s collection — involves much in the way of video projections, lights, television sets, voice-overs, soundtracks, computers, computer programs and, in the most recent efforts, touch screens. Yet regardless of whether power sources are needed, all the artworks use algorithms. That is, they are executed according to plans, instructions, numerical systems, or, as the show’s subtitle indicates, rules, codes and choreographies. The analog examples tend to be foundational works of Minimal and Conceptual Art: Donald Judd’s 1965 aluminum relief based on the Fibonacci numerical sequence; a Sol LeWitt wall drawing from 1976 executed to written directions applicable to walls of any dimension; and Joseph Kosuth’s string of five words in green neon that reads “Five Words in Green Neon” (1965). Then there is the show’s most plugged work in several senses: Nam June Paik’s 1989 “Fin de Siècle II,” a monumental video wall of dizzying complexity formed by 207 television monitors of varying sizes arranged in adjoining grids. They emit a disorienting, enrapturing flood of images and music taken from broadcast television and video art and programmed to repeat relentlessly, mutate wildly and change abruptly, although a driving, danceable beat is constant. All kinds of culture, high and low, pass before our eyes and into our ears. David Bowie pirouettes in a white suit with Louise Lecavalier, a former soloist with the acrobatic Canadian dance troupe La La La Human Steps, while singing “Look Back in Anger.” Merce Cunningham, in a red leotard, dances a solo and is shadowed by his own outline, in black. An image of a nude woman is put through numerous paces, multiplied different ways, in different colors, sometimes looking like an early Warhol painting, and is accompanied by an ecstatic blast of Philip Glass’s music. We see the head of Joseph Beuys performing in his signature hat, growling into a mike. His face appears on the central grid of monitors and then goes big, one massive image spread across them all. Especially complex are the machinations of a series of robot-like animated heads, both wireframe and solid blue with red lips. They start small, expand and then zoom in for grids of eyes or mouths. Metallic-looking piano keyboards, musical notes and a vast recording-studio control console twist and churn.  These animations are all from Paik’s most extensively used visual and aural source: Kraftwerk’s 1986 music video for “Musique Non Stop,” a pioneering early example of computer-generated animation by Rebecca Allen. (Her name appears in part of the piece, as does that of Paul Garrin, who, as Paik’s assistant, was responsible for the variations on the female nude.) “Musique Non Stop” also supplies the main soundtrack; its mechanized sound and distorted voices, like its animation, are of a piece with Kraftwerk’s robot aesthetic.  The grids of smaller monitors around the edges exude layered images and motifs. (Stars reminiscent of the American flag are frequent.) These spin in and out of view, their abstract patterns evoke pulsating electronic quilts. “Fin de Siècle II” is the lodestar, the magnetic center of “Programmed.” Visitors return to it repeatedly, often with cameras poised, sometimes just staring in disbelief. It seems unbelievable that Paik’s masterpiece is 30 years old. He made it for the Whitney’s 1989 exhibition “Image World: Art and Media Culture” — which like this one, looked to art’s unfolding future. It was given to the museum in 1993, but has never again been on view; the label calls it “partially restored,” indicating a difficult rehabilitation. The thrill of seeing “Fin de Siècle II” again is part of the thrill of the whole show, which ends with several recent digital works commissioned by the museum. In this way, “Programmed” offers an optimistic snapshot of the Whitney’s mission today, especially its determination to acquire, and foster new, experimental work, while giving older works in its collection fresh relevance.

5c72bb7e3a125f5075c0b46e,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/24/arts/music/peter-frampton-tour-illness.html,"The rock guitarist Peter Frampton said on Saturday that he was planning to issue a double album this summer, his first release in three years. He hinted at another mysterious project in the works. And he said he was going to go on tour for about 50 dates across the country. Yet Saturday’s most significant news was what Frampton, the British star best known for “Frampton Comes Alive!,” one of history’s best-selling live rock albums, revealed as the sobering motivation for his musical frenzy. In two interviews released on Saturday, one with CBS News and one with Rolling Stone, Frampton, 68, said he had a degenerative muscle disease called inclusion body myositis, also known as I.B.M. The disease causes muscles to weaken over time but generally does not affect life expectancy. His condition will not affect his singing voice, Frampton said, but it could slow his fingers and his ability to move around. “In a year’s time, I might not be able to play,” Frampton told Rolling Stone, adding, “I want to record as much as I can in the shortest space of time.” A publicist for Frampton said he could not be reached Saturday evening. Frampton became the lead singer and guitarist for the Herd at 16, and two years later co-founded Humble Pie. His popularity in the United States skyrocketed after the 1976 release of “Frampton Comes Alive!,” a double album that has sold more than 17 million copies. It features songs like “Baby, I Love Your Way” and “Show Me the Way.” Frampton did not always receive the critics’ praise, but he has played on albums by George Harrison and David Bowie, and in the 1970s he helped popularize the talk box, a device that creates the effect of a “talking” musical instrument. The Musicians Hall of Fame, which inducted Frampton in 2014, has called him “one of the most celebrated artists and guitarists in rock history.” Frampton recounted to Rolling Stone a series of warning signs regarding his health: He noticed tightness in his ankles about eight years ago, and there were times his legs felt weak; four years ago, he fell while trying to kick a beach ball off a concert stage; shortly after, he tripped over a guitar cord onstage; and he could not easily put things in overhead compartments on airplanes. Frampton told Rolling Stone that for four years, his children and his band knew about his diagnosis, but that he did not tell anybody else. He said that there was no traditional medicine to treat inclusion body myositis, but that he was exercising every day and hoped to participate in future drug trials. He said he thought the time was right to reveal his condition to the public because his talents may soon ebb, hence the new album and the announcement of the tour, which he is calling the “Peter Frampton Finale — The Farewell Tour.” He said that he may tour in Europe in the spring of 2020, but that this summer’s tour will most likely be his last. Frampton declined to elaborate much on his double album, and said he probably would not play “Frampton Comes Alive!” straight through on the coming tour. Frampton told Rolling Stone that $1 from every ticket sale on the coming tour would go toward a fund he had started with Johns Hopkins University to research myositis. “Maybe a huge door is closing in my life, but then there’s lots of other doors that open,” he said. He told CBS that the condition had already affected his fingers but that he could still play guitar well. “If I’m going to do a farewell tour, I want to play good,” Frampton said. “I want to rock it. I know that this tour, I will be able to do everything I did last year and the year before. That’s the most important thing to me. I want to go out screaming as opposed to, ‘He can’t play anymore.’” "
5c9ded1349f0eacbf105fb86,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/29/opinion/janet-jackson.html,"America, and the music world at large, has spent a significant portion of the past month grappling with the implications of “Leaving Neverland,” the haunting HBO documentary that revisits highly credible pedophilia allegations against Michael Jackson. But on Friday, good news will emerge about a member of the Jackson family that runs the risk of being overlooked.  Mr. Jackson’s younger sister, Janet Jackson, who has been one of the world’s brightest and most influential pop stars in her own right, will finally be inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame — 15 years after the “Nipplegate” fiasco at the Super Bowl halftime show that threatened her career, and 30 years after the release of her groundbreaking album “Rhythm Nation 1814.” Unlike most of her contemporaries in a comparable stratum, Ms. Jackson has found her entry into music’s most recognizable house of prestige elusive until now. She has been eligible since 2007, and there has been no shortage of whispers or indignant blogging, insisting she has been left out of the hall’s induction classes until now by the same entertainment industry forces that marginalized her after the infamous “wardrobe malfunction.”  In February 2004 — when phones weren’t smart, Twitter didn’t exist, The Facebook was days away from birth, LeBron James was still a teenager and Donald Trump was still a Democrat with a reality show — Janet Jackson had a nightmare unfold, in the space of a second, as she headlined the MTV-produced halftime show of Super Bowl XXXVIII. Before a crowd of over 71,000 and 90 million more watching on TV, Ms. Jackson performed a medley of her hits across three decades. She was then joined for a finale by a bearded yet still baby-faced Justin Timberlake to perform “Rock Your Body,” a catchy, dance-inducing number from his solo debut. The song, which threw the crowd into a happy frenzy, briefly became a duet. Then, in a cinematic shock — as the duo spun apart for what was meant as a final “costume reveal” in the choreography — Mr. Timberlake ripped off a portion of Ms. Jackson’s top, exposing her right breast on live television, just after he’d delivered the song’s last line: “Bet I’ll have you naked by the end of this song.” By the time heads quit spinning, “wardrobe malfunction” had been coined, and what was meant to be a crowning moment for Ms. Jackson was reduced to a meme. They both said it was an accident. But conspiracy theories abounded, and still do.  Parent groups, major advertisers (their parent companies) and the White House all condemned the incident. CBS was handed a fine by the Federal Communications Commission for indecency, which was ultimately voided. And Mr. Timberlake — who, accidentally or not, did the ripping — largely avoided public rebuke. Ms. Jackson, absent from the Grammys that year under unclear circumstances, after being scheduled to appear, experienced a newfangled, online-enabled public taunting analogous only to that faced by Monica Lewinsky at the millennium’s turn. She lost countless endorsement and touring opportunities. (She’ll have her highest-profile return to the limelight when she begins a residency in Las Vegas in May.) But, of course, the five-time Grammy Award winner is being honored because her cultural influence and career, while dotted with distress, has been anything but tragic, taken as a whole. The youngest child in the Jackson family, she had seen her brothers already gain fame as the Jackson 5 before she was a teenager. The 1986 album “Control,” produced by the icons Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, would be her own, noncoincidentally titled breakthrough. She had fired her notoriously domineering father as her manager, and her quest for independence powered the project’s vocal energy, which was matched by bombastic synths and carefree drum-heavy beats.  “Nasty,” a defiant, feminine power anthem protesting unwanted male attention and disrespect, featured a video subtly ahead of its time in its messaging about consent. (The snare drums drop, pointedly, after she shouts at a grabby pursuer, “Stop!”) “Control” topped the charts and established Ms. Jackson as a pioneer of genre-bending New Jack Swing and the modern music video: self-referential quirks and extended dance breakdowns paired with film-like production and narrative. The visual companions to lasting singles like the exasperated yet ebullient “What Have You Done for Me Lately” and the dance number “Pleasure Principle” (legendary back flip and all) helped break MTV’s gendered color line. Where “Control” focused on self-actualization, “Rhythm Nation 1814” (1989) aimed to address the world and her country, with its simmering social divides, and offer a salve. “Join forces in protest to social injustice/A generation full of courage, come forth with me,” she declared over the up-tempo, industrial grind of the title track. The progressivism embedded in the album managed to be simultaneously cool and civic-minded at a time when such a feat was considered nearly impossible for a pop star. Not only did all seven singles from “Rhythm Nation 1814” land in the top five of the Billboard 100, it had No. 1 hits in three separate years — with different songs topping the chart from 1989 through 1991. A long-form video medley of the album, shot in black and white, won a Grammy. Ms. Jackson’s global popularity and the indescribable coolness of her perch in American popular culture at the time is hard to capture in hindsight, or to compare with our digitally Balkanized era. She continued to flourish with her fifth album, 1993’s “Janet.,” embracing her femininity and sexuality with more confident ease than in any of her previous work. Writing about the album on its 25th anniversary for Rolling Stone, Brittany Spanos noted how “Janet.” inspired artists like Beyoncé, Rihanna, SZA and Janelle Monáe, all of whom openly testify to how her example helped them incorporate “power, intimacy and assertiveness” into their own work.  For many women of color growing up in the ’80s and ’90s, Ms. Jackson was the first “triple threat” superstar who looked like them to reach, or fully “cross over,” to the mainstream. It was “Janet” whom they danced to in front of their mirrors and imitated in dress, not Michael. As she entered her 30s and her career steadied to a cruise of experiments and radio hits, Michael Jackson’s had become increasingly weighed down by his questionable relations with children. Mr. Jackson was first accused of molestation in 1993. The case was settled for over $20 million in 1994 and the charges were ultimately dropped after the boy refused to cooperate with the investigation. Janet Jackson was resolute in support of her brother during the episode and after it. Footage from a documentary released in 2016 shows her denouncing the 1993 allegations. “Now, if this really went on, do you think a father would accept money?” she asks the interviewer. “Do you think that would make everything O.K.? It doesn’t make any sense.” Ms. Jackson hasn’t spoken up since “Leaving Neverland” aired. Her nephew Taj Jackson told CBS News’s Gayle King that she feared addressing the film would just “put more energy” into the matter, but he insisted that she, too, believed Michael was innocent. However, her radio silence now, after a previous vociferous defense, seems at best a convenient tactic of avoidance by the family’s second-most-famous member and at worst a tacit acknowledgment that she was most likely wrong all along. Still, whereas Mr. Jackson’s career never quite recovered from a scandal of his own making, Janet Jackson’s career was derailed by a bizarre moment over which she had little agency. (In an extra, queasy layer of coincidence, “Rock Your Body,” the song playing during the Super Bowl nudity flash, is a tune that Mr. Jackson had reportedly turned down for his 2001 album, according to Billboard’s Jason Lipshutz.) The public rebuke she received wasn’t all organic. A 2018 HuffPost report revealed that the CBS chairman Les Moonves, who was ousted last year as evidence of his own sexual misconduct mounted, was determined to ruin Ms. Jackson’s career because of the Super Bowl incident. Convinced it was a stunt and enraged with Ms. Jackson, according to the report, he demanded that Viacom radio stations, as well as VH1 and MTV, which she helped integrate in prior decades, stop playing her music. Ms. Jackson and Mr. Timberlake both offered apologies. But Ms. Jackson, a black woman, was almost exclusively shamed.  For uncertain reasons, despite initial plans, she wasn’t at the Grammys. He was still welcome to attend and won two awards. His career flourished, even as it waxed and waned (see his return to the halftime show of the Super Bowl last year). Hers was arguably suffocated — and at a time before millions of fans could crowdsource their cultural capital for backlash. There was no Black Twitter — with its mix of influential literati, activists and humorists — to have Janet Jackson’s back. The moment lasted just nine-sixteenths of a second but carried centuries of subtext, something Mr. Timberlake himself pointed out after time passed. “I probably got 10 percent of the blame,” he admitted. “I think America's probably harsher on women, and I think America is, you know, unfairly harsh on ethnic people.” “Nipplegate” is, in some ways, textbook proof that “intersectionality” — the term coined by Kimberlé Crenshaw, the same year “Rhythm Nation” was released, to describe the overlapping forms of discrimination — is not an abstract “ism” but a reality that can negatively manifest itself in culture-altering ways. When Madonna kissed Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards, there were guffaws and temporary scoldings. But she was once again celebrated as a provocateur, then shortly afterward inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2008 — by Mr. Timberlake, no less. Ms. Jackson, who became eligible for the hall in 2007 didn’t receive a nomination until 2016. Although Janet Jackson’s legacy certainly doesn’t need the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame’s validation, its lack of recognition was threatening to become a glaring omission. Now, at long last, the oversight will be corrected — and Ms. Jackson can take her bow.

5c92753e49f0eacbf105e1b8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/20/arts/music/christian-scott-atunde-adjuah-ancestral-recall-review.html,"Back in the 2000s, before social media’s impact had played out, when it wasn’t yet obligatory for artists to turn their work into a political statement, the trumpeter Christian Scott aTunde Adjuah was already using music to envision change. He rarely used vocals, but Mr. Scott wrote directly from his experiences growing up in the Upper Ninth Ward of New Orleans, and from his investigations into the history of race in America. His music combined musical legacies and pushed well beyond the standard approaches to contemporary jazz; on songs like “K.K.P.D.” and “Dred Scott,” he was projecting something like a new vision for American society. So “Ancestral Recall,” Mr. Scott’s bold new album, is only one link in a long chain of ambitious, broad-minded work. And while it may not be his most immediately affecting album (that remains “Yesterday You Said Tomorrow,” from 2010), it offers the kind of slow-burning immersion that most of his recent records have only gestured at. His main goal when making “Ancestral Recall” was to remind listeners that musical traditions centered on rhythm (African and Native American traditions in particular) have as much nuance and complexity as those built primarily around harmony (read: European). Across the album, Mr. Scott lets rhythms from West Africa and the Caribbean and New Orleans — from the pre-Columbian era, the 19th century and today — lace in and out of one another. At key moments, the poet Saul Williams interjects with lines of imagistic poetry, wandering from speech to rap to song in a style similar to that of Yasiin Bey (formerly Mos Def). On the title track, he intones: Up from the water I was drowned.The bullet exits the body.The organs seal themselves.The planes appear out of fire.The people are praying right there where we left them. While he is saying this, Mr. Scott surrounds him in beaming trumpet lines — declarative though unresolved — as if heralding the arrival of a new regime. There have been two major stages of Mr. Scott’s career — among the most high profile in jazz today. From 2007 to ’12, he released three studio records that wriggled smartly away from genre concerns. Thanks in part to their drummers, Marcus Gilmore and Jamire Williams — each of whom had his own way of reconstituting the influence of Tony Williams — the songs on “Anthem,” “Yesterday You Said Tomorrow” and “Christian aTunde Adjuah” tumbled into your ear with the writhing, essential force of a feeling, or a mass of people on the move. Since 2015 he has placed a new emphasis on patterned, polyrhythmic drumming, using a tightened-up approach and more explicitly melding the sounds of modern hip-hop with ancient, diasporic rhythms. His output of the past five-plus years have been defined by Mr. Scott’s interplay with the flute of Elena Pinderhughes and the latticework drumming of Corey Fonville — both of whom first joined the band on 2015’s “Stretch Music” (a highlight), and who appear on “Ancestral Recall” — as much as by its conceptual aspirations. The new album unifies the winning elements of Mr. Scott’s past work: the historical syncretism, the tensile band energy, the powerful physicality. The first track, “Her Arrival,” begins with a group of percussionists playing hand drums and a babble of voices rising up. It sounds like a street scene, and it’s an early indication that this will be music of embodiment. You can nearly walk around inside it. Midway through the album, on the graceful “Overcomer,” a slapping drumbeat disappears early in the track and a pastel silence takes over; then a mist of harmonizing voices comes in, with a cajón, an Afro-South American percussion instrument, being pounded below. When Mr. Scott takes a solo, his trumpet starts at a whisper and grows more distorted. Soon he’s alternating between spinning thick twirls of blues, à la Louis Armstrong, and pelting spears like Hugh Masekela. Mr. Scott is not a collegiate-sounding trumpet player, and he plays with as much deference to New Orleanian and continental African traditions as to bebop. As a result, he plays fewer notes than most jazz trumpeters today, and his projection is more immediately majestic. He is following a path of his own, and so far, it’s still breaking new ground. "
5c40cd383a125f5075c04f79,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/arts/music/julia-bullock-josephine-baker-met-museum-review.html,"In the 1935 film “Princesse Tam-Tam,” Josephine Baker’s title character is at a chic club when she forgets herself — and her lessons in acting white — at the sound of an African drum. As Baker enters into ecstatic communion with a feverish conga beat, the image cuts back and forth between the black drummer and the floppy-limbed, convulsing black dancer. At the Metropolitan Museum of Art on Wednesday, the soprano Julia Bullock, the museum’s artist in residence, presented “Perle Noire: Meditations for Joséphine,” a tribute to the first black international superstar and a defining figure of the Jazz Age. Here, too, the diva shared center stage with an array of drums. But Ms. Bullock and her creative partner, the percussionist-composer Tyshawn Sorey, offered a very different image from the exoticized object of European fantasies in “Princesse Tam-Tam.” Their darkly captivating show offered a haunting investigation into the psychological shadows and public constructions that shaped the career of a woman who was “no more primal than Princess Grace,” as Ms. Bullock says in the piece, but for whom the most direct route to entertainment royalty and a chateau in the Périgord meant donning a banana skirt. Ms. Bullock, who like Baker was born in St. Louis, wrote in the program notes that she, too, has sometimes felt the expectation to embrace exotic roles. She became fascinated with Baker’s story, which led from the black vaudeville circuit in Jim Crow America to stardom in Paris, a World War II role in the French Resistance and, back in the United States, public advocacy for the civil rights movement. In this work, which has been revised after previous versions unveiled at festivals in 2016, Ms. Bullock probes the cruelties and constraints that molded Baker and continue to afflict black artists. The Met’s grand staircase is the stage for this new production, directed by Zack Winokur, Ms. Bullock’s colleague in the American Modern Opera Company. The setting is as architecturally imposing as it is quietly symbolic: a steep climb, designed to awe. At its top, the canon of Western art — including, as Ms. Bullock points out, Tiepolo’s “The Triumph of Marius,” a painting celebrating the enslavement of an African king. But those representations faded into the darkness with the spotlight on Ms. Bullock and Mr. Sorey, seated at his keyboard and drums halfway up the steps. Musicians from the International Contemporary Ensemble were stationed at the bottom, almost blending with the audience. Mr. Sorey is a master of fashioning chameleonic soundscapes that fluidly adopt shifting moods, colors and styles. His approach to the songs made famous by Baker is one of deconstruction and recomposition. Most numbers are slowed down and set to harmonies that morph from quiet lyricism to frayed dissonances, with Mr. Sorey’s subtle percussion work adding a nervous sheen. When Baker sang it in 1933, “Si J’étais Blanche” (“If I Were White”) was jaunty, teasing and sly. Here it became eerie and bitter, with splintering flutter-tongued notes from the wind instruments over an ominous rumble offsetting Ms. Bullock’s inky, deep voice. The poet Claudia Rankine created powerful spoken monologues that intersperse musical numbers, drawing on Baker’s own words. These sketch a portrait far removed from the droll, pliable sex object, touching on traumatic memories of racial violence and their lingering effects on Baker’s relationships. (She married four times, beginning in 1919 when she was 13.) “All of me was already owned,” Ms. Bullock said in one monologue. This was followed by “C’est Lui,” a song that listeners in 1934 might have taken for little more than a coquettish confession by a girl irredeemably attracted to bad boys. Here, the wail of a saxophone cut through the space like a siren while Ms. Bullock’s voice turned chilly and hard. But there were also times when Mr. Sorey created luscious, finely crafted songs that held echoes of Messiaen or Poulenc and made the most of Ms. Bullock’s richly textured voice. In a tribute to Baker, an icon of the Charleston, some dance is expected. But when Ms. Bullock broke into movement — flashing almost-bare breasts and quoting some of the angular gestures made famous by Baker — she did so to the accompaniment of total silence, with only the sound of her increasingly labored breath amplified in space. Where Baker’s dancing communicated liberation and joy, Ms. Bullock’s felt caged and desperate. “I ran,” she had said earlier, in a monologue on Baker’s escape from Jim Crow America, “though everyone called it dancing.” "
5c7f60de49f0eacbf105b8d6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/06/world/asia/michael-jackson-radio-stations.html,"WELLINGTON, New Zealand — As the release of a new documentary detailing abuse accusations against the singer Michael Jackson has prompted debate about his legacy, the public response to its contents is also leading radio stations across the globe to stop playing his music. A radio network in Quebec pulled Jackson’s music from its nearly two dozen stations, according to The Canadian Press. In Britain, Variety reported that the BBC was forced to deny imposing such a ban after it was reported that the singer’s music had been “quietly dropped” from one of its stations. And the backlash has led to an almost complete removal of the singer’s music from the airwaves in New Zealand, after the two largest radio networks — which own most of the country’s commercial stations — said Wednesday that they would no longer play Jackson’s songs. In the New Zealand and Canadian cases, radio networks cited a change in public opinion about Jackson that was tied to the documentary “Leaving Neverland,” a two-part mini-series focusing on the accusations of two men who say Jackson abused them as children, as the reason for the ban. The program is scheduled for broadcast in New Zealand on Sunday and Monday. Leon Wratt, the content director of MediaWorks, one of the New Zealand radio companies, said audiences had indicated that they no longer wanted to hear Jackson’s music. “We aren’t deciding whether Michael Jackson is guilty of pedophilia or not,” he said in an interview on one of MediaWorks’ stations, Magic. “We’re just merely trying to make sure that our radio stations are going to play the music that people want to hear.” Mr. Wratt added that the accusations against Jackson had been public for years — the singer was cleared of child molesting charges after a trial in 2005. But viewers have reacted with shock to the new documentary. And its subjects, Wade Robson and James Safechuck, who detail disturbing accusations from their childhoods against Jackson, have received both plaudits and abuse for their part in it. Dean Buchanan, a spokesman for NZME, the other New Zealand radio network to pull Jackson’s music, said by email that the singer’s work was not being played “right now” on its stations. The country’s national public broadcaster, Radio New Zealand — which is primarily a talk station — also said that Jackson’s music currently did not feature in its air play, although a spokesman, John Barr, said that was not the result of a particular editorial decision. A Canadian media company, Cogeco, that told The Canadian Press it had banned Jackson’s music on its 23 stations in Quebec — including three major Montreal stations — cited the public response to “Leaving Neverland” as the reason. Neither NZME nor MediaWorks responded to questions about how long the ban would last, what date it began, or whether the networks planned to pull the songs of other musicians accused of wrongdoing, such as R. Kelly, who has been accused of, and denies, decades of serial misconduct. Mr. Wratt, the MediaWorks spokesman, said Jackson’s music would still be available on streaming services and in record stores for anyone who wanted to hear it. “The difference with radio, of course, is that if we play it you don’t have a choice,” he said. This is not the first time radio stations and streaming services have wrestled with whether to remove the music of artists accused of misconduct: Spotify last May instituted a policy of ceasing to promote or recommend R. Kelly’s music because of the accusations against him, though it rescinded the policy a month later after uproar from some in the music industry. Jackson’s estate in February canceled the Chicago run of a new jukebox musical about the singer three weeks after the Sundance premiere of “Leaving Neverland,” and two weeks before its HBO broadcast. The producers of the musical, “Don’t Stop ’Til You Get Enough,” cited scheduling difficulties caused by a labor dispute as the reason. The estate is seeking $100 million in damages from HBO over the “Leaving Neverland” documentary, which Howard Weitzman, the estate’s lawyer, branded “a disgrace.” "
5ca3831d49f0eacbf1f802ca,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/02/theater/death-in-venice-ivo-van-hove-nico-muhly.html,"AMSTERDAM — At an Amsterdam rehearsal studio one recent afternoon, Thomas Mann, the German author who died in 1955, was speaking with the main character of his novella, “Death in Venice.” “I have to get out of here,” said Gustav von Aschenbach, collapsing into a chair with his head in his hands. “That’s a good idea,” said Mann, hovering nearby. But Mann did not let him leave. Instead, he forced his character to stay in Venice, tormented by his obsession with a 14-year-old Polish boy, and to die there. In this new musical production of “Death in Venice,” created by the internationally renowned Belgian director Ivo van Hove, the author is present. Mann doesn’t only converse with his protagonist, but also with his own wife, Katia, who watches from the sidelines as her husband also becomes increasingly distracted by the sight of the beautiful boy. It is what you might call a meta-rendering of “Death in Venice”: A story from Thomas Mann’s real life — how he created a fictional alter ego with submerged homoerotic urges — is the framing device that sets the stage adaptation into dramatic motion. [Read about Ivo van Hove’s staging of a rarely heard “Diary.”] Premiering April 4, the production is a collaboration between the Internationaal Theater Amsterdam (formerly known as the Toneelgroep Amsterdam), which Mr. van Hove leads, and the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra. They have commissioned music by the American composer Nico Muhly, which will be interspersed between works by Richard Strauss, Anton Webern and Arnold Schoenberg, and conducted by David Robertson. The production will tour Europe from next year, with performances in London, Paris and Zagreb. “We see Mann at home writing this novel, creating von Aschenbach, sending him to Venice, and having him meet a boy,” explained Mr. van Hove, in a rehearsal break. “It’s to make clear that this wasn’t just a story to Thomas Mann: It was something that he lived through.” Ramsey Nasr, who adapted the novella for the stage and plays Aschenbach, said in an email exchange that the idea of incorporating the real-life story of Thomas and Katia Mann into the drama was a way to explore how artists create fictions from their own lives. Katia described in her 1974 memoir, “Unwritten Memories,” how “Death in Venice” was based on a trip the two took to the city in 1911, when they stayed at the Grand Hôtel des Bains on the Lido, and encountered many figures whom Mann used as models for his characters. The boy who became Mann’s muse was later identified as Wladyslaw Moes, the 10-year-old son of an aristocratic Polish family, in the 2001 book “The Real Tadzio,” by the Scottish journalist Gilbert Adair. When Mr. Nasr learned about this background to the novel, he said, “It made me wonder: How was it for her to be there and witness it all?” This gave him “all the ingredients for a drama encapsulating the story,” he added. Katia, who outlived her husband by 25 years, was almost 90 when she finally revealed publicly how she had dealt with that chapter of their life together. “She didn’t talk about it for her whole life, really,” said Mr. van Hove. “She accepted that he had this in him but he turned it into novels and he turned it into poetry and into art.” “Death in Venice” is one of the most celebrated works of German literature, and it has been adapted as an acclaimed film by Luchino Visconti, in 1971, and as Benjamin Britten’s final opera, which premiered in 1973. Mr. Muhly, a composer who has worked with Philip Glass and Björk, has written new music for the production. In an interview, he said this “Death in Venice” was neither an opera nor a music theater piece, but rather “a play with a lot of room for music.” The difficulty of adapting the novella for the stage is that the drama of the story largely takes place in Aschenbach’s mind. Visconti reimagined Aschenbach as a composer and conductor (played by Dirk Bogarde) and used music by Mahler on the soundtrack to reflect Aschenbach’s anguish. In Britten’s opera, Aschenbach retains his identity as a writer, who sings his interior monologue, while Tadzio has a nonspeaking role, typically performed by a dancer. Mr. Muhly said he knew Britten’s opera “incredibly well,” and that it was a key reference point for his own opera “Two Boys,” which was performed at the Metropolitan Opera in New York in 2013. But, he said, he had to “not think about that at all. Instead, I was thinking about the text, I was thinking about the adaptation, and what Ivo’s team has done to frame this text and to tell the story in different way.” Mr. van Hove has created three productions this season that concern what he called “abusive forbidden relationships”: a stage adaptation of Hanya Yanagihara’s novel “A Little Life,” which tells a story of a victim of pedophilia, and “The Wood,” a play adapted from a novel by Jeroen Brouwers, which portrays physical and sexual abuse in a Roman Catholic monastery and boarding school. “It’s very current, with what’s coming out about the Catholic church and, coincidentally, this whole Michael Jackson thing,” he said, referring to the new documentary “Leaving Neverland,” about child-abuse allegations against the pop musician. “It’s really something that people are talking about more and more. Thomas Mann wrote about the subject of desire. You cannot call it abuse; it’s in someone’s mind, but it’s really a fantasy desire.” Mr. Robertson, who will lead the Concertgebouw for the production’s Amsterdam run, cautioned against thinking of “Death in Venice” as primarily about homoerotic or pedophilic urges. The production was asking bigger questions, he added: “Where does creativity come from? Where does love stem from, and what happens when love and creativity are blended together?” Mr. Robertson said he thought the project was a wholly new take on Mann’s story. “This doesn’t replace the novella, the film or the opera,” he said. “It augments this fantastic creation that Thomas Mann has made.” "
5c4b5f723a125f5075c065e5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/25/opinion/letters/nashville-music-zoning.html,"To the Editor: Re “The Day the Music Died,” by Margaret Renkl (Op-Ed, nytimes.com, Jan. 21): While it’s true that the death of one neighborhood bar in a growing city isn’t a tragedy, when it comes on the heels of 43 other music-related businesses demolished over the last five years, the public should be concerned. Especially considering that during that same time, only one threatened historic building — RCA Studio A — was saved. As Ms. Renkl eloquently describes, Nashville is in danger of destroying its own history. Instead of providing exemptions to Music Row’s zoning — which ultimately encourages demolitions of small-scale, music-related buildings — the city should adopt incentives to support the music industry on Music Row. Although large companies are routinely awarded incentives to locate or operate in Nashville, no such benefits exist for small music businesses. Creating these incentives, including a state tax credit for historic rehabilitation, would help save the past and future of Music Row. Otherwise, no number of mournful laments by the many talented troubadours in Music City will make up for the permanent loss of the city’s cultural heritage. David J.

5c62997c3a125f5075c0936f,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/12/magazine/letter-of-recommendation-ronnie-james-dio.html,"There’s a unique kind of depression that comes from being broke during winter in Spokane, Wash., where I spent the better part of my 20s and 30s. It’s a place with decommissioned smokestacks on its skyline, where freight trains rumble on raised trellises in a constant metallic purr and where, for me, life felt like sitting at the back of a fishtailing bus that was trying to make its way up an icy hill. My husband, Joe, and I went through 13 apartments and houses in 10 years — each one an attempt to dig out from under a mountain of student-loan debt and medical bills, accrued as we desperately searched for the reason Joe was sick all the time. Once, we left a broken-down car at a mechanic for nine months; our other one was repossessed. We stopped reading the mail for a year, schlepping it instead from house to house, unopened, in a heavy garbage bag. We were college-educated, fully employed people who had been served slices of the American dream on paper birthday-party plates in quiet suburban homes, yet we felt as if America was pushing us away. We found our true home in bars where hipsters and junkies and old homeless guys sat shoulder to shoulder choking down thin beers, plugging quarters into jukeboxes, queuing up thick, heavy-metal songs the rest of the world had already forgotten about. I was always a fan of loud music, but it wasn’t until then that I started to feel pulled toward Ronnie James Dio. Ronald James Padavona was raised in a place not unlike Spokane: Cortland, N.Y. He grew up Catholic, took an early interest in opera, formed his first bands young and rose through the ranks of the 1960s rock scene. He was one of the pioneers of heavy metal, forging his music in the unique fires of lapsed faith and a skepticism of those who seek power. Throughout 50 years of making heavy music — in Elf, Rainbow, Black Sabbath and Heaven & Hell — Dio sang again and again and again about trying to find a home. In Rainbow’s “Stargazer,” Dio tells the story of a wizard who tempts commoners with empty promises, persuading them to enslave themselves to build him a tower from which he will fly. The people realize too late that they’ve fallen victim to a predator: “We build a tower of stone/With our flesh and bone/Just to see him fly/But we don’t know why.” Dio is the aching voice of an embittered, betrayed public — a siren urging them to rise, stand up, take their lives back: “I see a rainbow rising/Look there, on the horizon.” My love for Dio’s music came in a slow drip. During the period in which I regularly came home from work to find red heating-shut-off notices dangling from the doorknob of our rental house, I progressed further into his catalog, taken by all the stories he tells in his music. When he died in the spring of 2010, I thought of all us castaways for whom he must have been singing. The more I listened, the more I felt as if Dio, all along, was talking to people like me and Joe in his songs. There are precise songs for precise moments: Black Sabbath’s “Supernaut” for Friday nights, Metallica’s “Creeping Death” for morning traffic, Judas Priest’s “Painkiller” before a salary negotiation. But Dio’s music was often about finding victory inside yourself, of recognizing the craven intentions of the powerful and fighting back. When he held the microphone, his voice exploded out of him, a smelling-salts blast under the noses of anyone on the verge of giving up. Recently, though, Dio’s music became clearer for me, and it happened around the time I realized that I was remiss in expecting a society set up on the twin values of spending and earning to find a place for a person like me. I was on my way to have lunch with a Pulitzer Prize winner with 23 cents in my bank account and a desperate hope my “emergencies only” credit card wouldn’t be declined. I was on the freeway when, out of the blue, there was Dio: Black Sabbath’s “Heaven and Hell” crashing through a bright afternoon: They say that life’s a carouselSpinning fast, you’ve got to ride it wellThe world is full of kings and queensWho blind your eyes and steal your dreamsIt’s heaven and hell, oh wellAnd they’ll tell you black is really whiteThe moon is just the sun at nightAnd when you walk in golden hallsYou get to keep the gold that fallsIt’s heaven and hell, oh, no. Fool, fool For once, I was broke and I was laughing. How could I listen to a song so many times and only now really hear it? All along, Dio was saying what a fool’s game it is to measure your value on the standards of a society that was never meant for you. Gold is never free, and to get it, you’ve got to bow before a master. “God and the devil are inherent in each of us, and it’s our choice to make,” Dio said in one interview, late in life. “The optimum way to go is to do the good thing.” I think he wanted to leave this as his legacy: a reminder that home is a place inside your own mind. There will always be new wizards to follow, new rings to kiss. But there, too, will always be rejects and castaways. And there’s victory in the realization that there will always be more of us than there are of them. That in our anger, together we are all home. "
5c5795f33a125f5075c07d67,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/03/arts/music/super-bowl-halftime-show.html,"Maroon 5 — a quasi-soul, quasi-rock, utterly funkless band — was the main attraction at the Super Bowl halftime show at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, likely the third or eighth or maybe 14th choice for a headliner. In a year in which the Super Bowl halftime show has become a referendum on political mindfulness, in which the N.F.L. has become a staging ground for conversations about racial justice in America, Maroon 5 was a cynically apt choice. It is neutral, inoffensive, sleek without promising too much. For nearly two decades, it has been wildly popular without leaving much of a musical mark, as easy to forget as mild weather. And the band did no better during its 13 and a half minutes onstage, in a performance that was dynamically flat, mushy at the edges, worthy of something much worse than derision: a shrug. It was an inessential performance from a band that might have lost some moral authority if it had any moral authority to lose. Perhaps for the N.F.L., which probably sought to make the halftime performance as anodyne as possible, this was a victory. But what saddles Maroon 5 as a band — its propensity to pretend lithe things are thumping, its commitment to thinning out the soul and rock of the 1970s and 1980s until they’re so brittle they might snap — doomed this performance, which blithely skated through a half-dozen of the band’s hits. [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] And in a year in which the political valence of the halftime show mattered more than ever, the band’s stubborn resistance was glaring. The N.F.L. canceled the traditional news conference for performers this year, looking to avoid a fiasco. But the frontman Adam Levine did do an interview with “Entertainment Tonight” in which he suggested that the choice to perform at the halftime show triggers in some an “insatiable urge to hate a little bit.” “No one thought about it more than I did,” he added, not very reassuringly. “I’m not in the right profession if I can’t handle a little bit of controversy.” Efforts to blunt Maroon 5’s dullness, and its political aversion, were being made for weeks before the formal announcement that it would be the headliner. In December, Variety reported that the band had approached a half-dozen black artists to appear as part of the performance. But the decision of whether to perform was now oriented around the protests of Colin Kaepernick and other N.F.L. players, who in 2016 began taking a knee during the national anthem (or otherwise not standing at attention) as a means of drawing attention to the systemic oppression of black people in this country. The halftime show — one of the biggest stages in pop, and also an unpaid performance on behalf of the N.F.L. — became radioactive. Perform, and be perceived as a shill for the league. (Kaepernick is pursuing a grievance against the N.F.L., accusing team owners of colluding to keep him from playing in the league.) Ultimately, Maroon 5 — a band that hasn’t had a Top 20 hit without a black or Latina guest performer in four years — was joined by Travis Scott, hip-hop’s most energetic performer, but not one much troubled by political concerns. (Last month, Scott announced he would, in partnership with the N.F.L., donate $500,000 to a nonprofit organization, Dream Corps.) Also added to the performance was Big Boi — one half of Outkast, and an Atlanta rap elder — which felt like an attempt at moral cover. Online petitions requested all of the performers take a knee in support of Kaepernick and his goals. No one did. For what it’s worth, the toxicity of being associated with the Super Bowl didn’t appear to extend beyond the halftime performance. Chance the Rapper performed in a Doritos commercial (with the Backstreet Boys); 2 Chainz was entertaining in an ad for Expensify; Cardi B and Lil Jon tag-teamed in a Pepsi ad. Both of the pregame performances were by black artists: a taut, controlled reading of “America the Beautiful” by Chloe x Halle and an impressive, if Disney-saccharine, national anthem from Gladys Knight, who before the game criticized Kaepernick for making the anthem a site of protest. In this context, Maroon 5 was a dead band walking: a base coat destined to be painted over. Three years ago, Beyoncé effectively hijacked Coldplay’s performance for one of the most rousing and politically savvy halftime performances ever. But nothing even remotely on that scale happened here. Scott and Big Boi were ushered on and offstage quickly, boxes that had been checked off. Scott bark-rapped his way through “Sicko Mode,” and at the end of his moment, fell backward onto the crowd, as close to his mayhem-filled live shows as circumstances allowed. Big Boi emerged in a Cadillac wearing a fur coat — the most exciting moment of the whole show — and did a casual pass at Outkast’s “The Way You Move,” with Sleepy Brown. When Levine joined them for a synchronized two-step, it took him a second or two to catch the groove. "
5ca67ad649f0eacbf1f80ff8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/04/arts/music/nipsey-hussle-shooting-death.html,"Though far from a struggling musician, Nipsey Hussle, the Los Angeles rapper who was shot and killed on Sunday, was not living the luxury fantasy of hip-hop superstardom. He often traveled without security. He did not anchor his image to brick-size piles of money and fleets of foreign cars, opting rather for a few thick gold chains with a flannel or a hoodie. Instead of multi-million-dollar brand deals, high fashion collaborations and appearances on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show,” Hussle partnered with a developer to buy a local strip mall and helped with the opening of a co-working space and a Fatburger. “Nipsey’s there kissing babies, taking selfies,” recalled Mark Webster, who worked with Hussle on branding for the burger joint. Most casual listeners are familiar with hip-hop’s 1 percent — Jay-Z, Drake, Cardi B. But Hussle represented a less visible, less glamorous, but increasingly ascendant hip-hop archetype: the regional legend, a member of rap’s middle class who can do well without ever reaching mainstream mega-fame. With the rise of streaming and the 24/7 personalized reality show of social media, it’s a boom time for this in-between tier of artists. Even outside hip-hop strongholds like New York, Atlanta, Chicago and Los Angeles, rappers from cities like Charlotte, N.C.; Baton Rouge, La.; and Pompano Beach, Fla., have been able to develop and sustain national fan bases. Many like Hussle earn a healthy living, if not ultra-wealth, without broad radio play or platinum plaques. And in the tradition of the pre-internet hometown heroes that came before them, many stay close to home for a combination of financial and personal reasons. But that same accessibility and dedication to their communities can also make them reachable targets, a harsh reality that has resonated in the hip-hop world this week. The police said Hussle, 33, was killed in front of his South Los Angeles clothing store by someone he knew, likely because of a neighborhood dispute. On Thursday, prosecutors charged Eric R. Holder Jr., 29, with Hussle’s murder. “Everything about Nipsey was Crenshaw and Slauson,” the Game, a friend and Los Angeles rapper who collaborated with Hussle, said in an interview. “Those are the two streets that ended up taking his life.” Hussle, whose given name was Ermias Asghedom, has been mourned by major artists, athletes, actors and politicians who remembered his entrepreneurship and philanthropy. But the biggest outpouring of grief was in Crenshaw, where the rapper was still “just a regular dude from L.A.,” the Game said. Najee Ali, an activist in South Los Angeles who knew Hussle, said: “He walked in the community every day. People could walk up and touch him.” A product of the CD mixtape era, Hussle, a classic West Coast stylist reminiscent of ’90s gangster rap, would pass out his music by hand or sell it from the trunk of his car before things went truly digital. But as hip-hop transitioned to free music online and eventually to YouTube and streaming services, regional artists of Hussle’s caliber suddenly had access to broader audiences for little cost. At Spotify and Apple Music, hip-hop revealed itself to be the most in-demand genre, and niche rappers like Hussle found greater opportunities. For artists like Hussle — or his southern peers Kevin Gates, Yo Gotti and Young Dolph, among countless others — concerts might take place in nightclubs instead of stadiums, and without sophisticated celebrity infrastructure, they try to capitalize on viral moments and guerrilla marketing. Nearly 15 years into his career, Hussle appeared to be on the cusp of crossover stardom. He had a GQ spread, and with management from Jay-Z’s Roc Nation, he released his first official studio album, “Victory Lap,” on Atlantic Records, a major label, last year. It was a modest success, debuting at No. 4 on the Billboard chart and earning a Grammy nomination, though his numbers still paled in comparison to rap stars like Drake or J. Cole, who regularly top 100 million Spotify plays on a track. Hussle, who never had a breakout hit, was earning about a tenth of that, though his reputation was outpacing his commercial impact. But rather than use his success as a one-way ticket to the gated communities of Calabasas, he rarely strayed from the blocks where he came up as a member of the Rollin’ 60s Crips gang. Wack 100, a prominent rap manager and a self-described Piru Blood from Los Angeles, noted that despite Hussle’s background, his killing did not conjure the East Coast vs. West Coast war of 1990s gangster rap, which saw the shooting deaths of the Notorious B.I.G. and Tupac Shakur. “It wasn’t an outsider that came over here and did that” to Hussle, he said. Bloods and Crips frequently work together in music, and violence in hip-hop rarely stems from those affiliations these days, Wack said. He credited that to the formation more than a decade ago of a council of elders — regional gang leaders who were involved in rap and wanted to prevent bloodshed that could undermine big business, while also uniting communities. “We knew we made mistakes and we were part of the problem of laying the foundation of the negativity,” he said. Hussle had reinvested his earnings back into Crenshaw, maintaining street-level ties even as his star grew. And like many in his situation, Hussle’s comfort in the neighborhood that treated him like a king resulted in a casual presence. When he was shot on Sunday afternoon in front of his Marathon Clothing store, Hussle was with only two friends, and taking photos with fans. “Sometimes keeping it real is too much,” Wack said. “When you’re that accessible, that common, then it becomes easy to get to you and easy to plot on you.” For other rappers who looked to Hussle’s career as a blueprint, his killing has resulted in increased paranoia and anxiety. Mozzy, a Sacramento rapper who frequently wrestles with the consequences of his gang ties in music and interviews, said that Hussle “was supposed to be untouchable,” and represented the aspirational “big dog” in his lane “as far as being a gangster rapper and trying to transition into being a mogul and a role model.” “I ain’t going to lie, I’m kind of shaking right now,” Mozzy said, having recently had a “mini-altercation” in his own neighborhood. He cited the fatalistic advice of the Louisiana rap veteran Boosie: “Most rappers die in their own city,” and added: “Every day you’re taking one of the biggest risks of your life by being a rapper and living in your community, or continuing to pull up there. But you take that risk out of a love for the people.” Charlamagne Tha God, the author and rap radio host for Power 105 in New York, said that Hussle’s death would “absolutely affect the way people move through their hood” in the future. “It makes you constantly question yourself and say, ‘Should I give back and go back, or should I give back and not go back?’ And how much going back is too much?” Charlamagne said. The Game, a native of Compton who remains a presence there, described the constant nagging feeling that the place with the most love for you could also be the place with the most festering hate. He said that less than 24 hours before Hussle was shot, the two spoke about “how to move, and dip in and dip out” of the neighborhood to stay safe. “I know, I know,” he recalled Hussle telling him, “I just gotta get this right for my people.” "
5c508c703a125f5075c06eb7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/29/obituaries/oliver-mtukudzi-dead.html,"Oliver Mtukudzi, whose singing and guitar playing harnessed influences from across Southern Africa to create the most popular musical style in Zimbabwe, died on Jan. 23 in Harare, the nation’s capital. He was 66. The cause was heart failure related to diabetes, said Damon Forbes, a record executive and promoter who had worked with Mr. Mtukudzi for more than 20 years. Starting in the late 1970s, Mr. Mtukudzi (pronounced muh-too-KOOD-zie) recorded numerous albums — 67, by his count — and became a hero throughout Africa. The Zimbabwean music journalist Alex T. Magaisa wrote that Mr. Mtukudzi was “arguably Zimbabwe’s finest ambassador.” Though an official figure was not available, conservative estimates suggest that Mr. Mtukudzi sold millions of albums over the past 40 years. He sang anthems of social lament and timeless wisdom, typically in Shona, Zimbabwe’s predominant language, but also in English and Ndebele. His music pulled from traditional Shona rhythms and sounds while incorporating influences from South Africa’s more cosmopolitan, jazz-inflected mbaqanga tradition, as well as African-American dance music. What resulted — a kind of soundtrack to Zimbabwean life in the late 20th century — became known as its own idiom, called “Tuku music,” after Mr. Mtukudzi’s nickname. “I looked for a sound the guitar couldn’t make, in a guitar‚” he told the South African publication TshisaLIVE in an interview shortly before his death, remembering his early years. “Professional guitarists at the time used to laugh at me. I used to look for a mbira on the guitar strings,” he said, referring to a traditional Shona thumb piano. In the 1970s, as a member of the band Wagon Wheels, he played alongside the singer Thomas Mapfumo, who would become the only other Zimbabwean musician with a reputation to rival his. Mr. Mapfumo left the country in the 1990s and became well known in the West. Mr. Mtukudzi stayed, and cemented his status as the country’s most renowned musician. His popularity in Zimbabwe reflects the fact that in a country bitterly divided by political allegiances, he positioned himself as a unifier. While Mr. Mapfumo took a strong political stance in his music — pioneering a genre known as chimurenga (“revolutionary struggle music” in Shona) before the fall of white minority rule, then vigorously criticizing Robert Mugabe, who ruled the country from 1980 to 2017 — Mr. Mtukudzi generally avoided taking a political side. He sang at events for the ruling ZANU-PF party, as well as the wedding and funeral of the opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai. But his songs boldly told the stories of his communities, and he made no effort to avoid social issues. Perhaps his biggest hit was “Todii,” a cautionary song about the perils of H.I.V. from the 1997 album “Tuku Music.” Powered by a melancholy chorus of background singers and the gravelly lament of Mr. Mtukudzi’s lead vocal, it warned listeners of the virus that by then had infected a quarter of Zimbabwe’s population. Another popular song, “Neria,” from 1993, told of a woman thrown into poverty by a law that kept her from inheriting her husband’s property. Written as part of Mr. Mtukudzi’s soundtrack for a feature film, it so impressed the filmmakers that they changed the name of the movie to “Neria.” Nine years later, the same filmmakers made “Shanda,” a documentary about Mr. Mtukudzi that documented him as he toured Zimbabwe. Many of his songs urged government leaders as well as everyday people to focus on the well-being of Zimbabwe’s children. And Mr. Mtukudzi did throw the occasional veiled political swipe. In 2001 he released “Wasakara,” whose title translates to “You are worn out,” a song widely seen as a plea for Mr. Mugabe to step down. “He was a nation builder,” Paul Mangwana, a senior Zimbabwean government official, told The Associated Press. “Where it was necessary to criticize he would, and where it was necessary to praise he would.” Mr. Mtukudzi sought to strengthen his community through deeds as well as music. For the last 15 years, he ran the Pakare Paye Arts Center, an arts complex he founded in 2003 in Norton, a town 25 miles west of Harare. With a recording studio, classrooms and performance spaces, it aims to offer young people a creative and social outlet that would help combat unemployment and listlessness. In 2011 he was named a Unicef regional good-will ambassador for Eastern and Southern Africa. A year before, he had written a song, “Deaf Hear,” in observation of Unicef’s Day of the African Child. President Emmerson Mnangagwa of Zimbabwe acknowledged Mr. Mtukudzi’s death in a statement on Twitter. “Oliver Mtukudzi,” he wrote, “your voice has given us comfort during difficult times, and will remain with us for posterity.” Oliver Dairai Mtukudzi was born on Sept. 22, 1952, in Highfield, a dense, impoverished neighborhood of Harare. (The city was officially known as Salisbury at the time; what would eventually become Zimbabwe was then the British colony of Southern Rhodesia.) His parents had met after singing in a choir group, and they encouraged his blossoming musical interests. His father died just as Oliver was entering adulthood, and to support his family he took a job at a bookstore. But he filled every idle moment practicing on the guitar that a musician had given him after noticing his preternatural ability. He joined Wagon Wheels in 1977. Though it was a short-lived band, it nonetheless raised his and Mr. Mapfumo’s profiles. The next year, during the final days of the Zimbabwean revolution, he released “Ndipeiwo Zano,” his debut album with his own band, the Black Spirits. The title track testified to the experiences and determination of a dispossessed people. Throughout his career, Mr. Mtukudzi kept his family and his work entwined. His brother, Robert, was his keyboard player until he died in 1992. His daughters often sang background vocals and helped him compose. His initial plan in Norton was for his son, Samson, also a successful musician, to run the Pakare Paye center, but Samson died in a car accident in 2010. Mr. Mtukudzi’s survivors include his wife, Daisy; his daughters, Sandra Mtukudzi, Samantha Mtukudzi and Selmor Manatsa; and three sisters. An earlier marriage, to Melody Mtukudzi, ended in divorce. Starting in the 1990s, Mr. Mtukudzi increasingly performed across the globe: at sports stadiums in Africa, at Western festivals like Coachella and Womad, and at the Hollywood Bowl. Bonnie Raitt covered a Mtukudzi composition, “Help Me Lord,” and helped introduce him to Western audiences. He remained active until months before his death, even as he was plagued by complications of diabetes. In October he played for a crowd of more than 20,000 in Bloemfontein, South Africa. Speaking to TshisaLIVE, he defined his approach to music in intimate terms. “According to my mother‚ she believed that I will never come up with a song that surpasses my birth cry. From that‚ I’ve been making music to compare to that first cry,” he said. “What my birth cry meant to my mother — that is the kind of music I make.” "
5c8a5ec049f0eacbf105d0cc,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/14/arts/music/blueface-thotiana-interview.html,"ENGLEWOOD, Colo. — For Blueface, everything is still new, and a little surprising. A couple of weeks ago, he was paid $20,000 to perform two songs at the opening of a boutique. When he asks women in the crowd at concerts to lift up their shirts, they oblige. Recently, seated in first class on a flight, he ran his phone camera over the sea of other people in cushioned seats, smiled and implored his viewers to “say hello to all my Caucasian friends.” When the 22-year-old rapper born Johnathan Porter posts these happenings on his Instagram story, he often gives the camera a little flat-affect eyebrow-raise, a Jim Halpert out in the hip-hop wilds. The unlikely and wild moments are arriving ever more quickly these days, now that Blueface has catapulted from local Los Angeles rap notoriety to national ubiquity thanks to his single “Thotiana,” which recently reached No. 9 on the Billboard Hot 100. The slow-tempo bacchanal full of nearly whispered boasts was originally released last summer, but has recently exploded: first as a viral sensation with accompanying dances, and lately via a couple of remixes — one, with YG, to bolster its street authority, and a second, with Cardi B, to ease its path into pop ubiquity. By December, when Blueface signed a distribution deal for his first mixtape, “Famous Cryp,” with Entertainment One Records, it was already notching between 5 and 7 million streams a week, according to Nielsen Music. Alan Grunblatt, the label’s president of urban music, said “Thotiana” was poised to be the most successful song he’s worked on since Bone Thugs-n-Harmony’s No. 1, double-platinum “Crossroads.” “Getting to this point probably took about 25 percent music,” Blueface said, verging on unimpressed, at his Denver hotel on a quiet afternoon in between shows in Colorado Springs and Englewood late last month. The rest, he noted laconically: “Marketing, promotion, being yourself.” Unlike most rappers, he openly describes Blueface as a character. “Blueface is probably 10 times Johnathan,” he said. “Every rapper, I don’t give a [expletive] what they tell you, they got two different personalities — they not like that when they at home.” In a genre that’s long been burdened with the expectations of authenticity bumping up against the dictates of entertainment, such candor is refreshing, and utterly reasonable. As rising-star origin stories go, this is rather unromantic, but telling of the times. Blueface is, perhaps above all, a first-rate character actor of the meme era, right down to the tattoo of Benjamin Franklin that creeps from his right ear all the way to the middle of his cheek. If you watch closely, you can see Blueface leaning into the theater of it all. He’s honed a few signature moves that he breaks out at every show: moistening the tips of his pointer finger and pinkie in his mouth, then smoothing out his eyebrows; grabbing a mop and putting it to work during “Bleed It”; pouring water over himself somewhere in between “Freak Bitch” and “Thotiana.” And then there’s the dance — the comically sexual bust down, in which he yanks at the waistband of his pants while studiously gyrating. Always, the look on his face is part rough-edged heartthrob, part can-you-believe-this? What makes Blueface’s ascendance even more intriguing is that his flow is deeply unorthodox. On the skeletal but urgent “Famous Cryp,” his arrangement of words often bears only a passing relationship to the beats he’s rapping over. His syllables can be arrhythmic, and the conclusions of his lines fall over the end, like Wile E. Coyote zooming past the edge of a cliff, legs still pumping. At times, he suggests the embryonic Los Angeles gangster rap of the late 1980s, or even vocal eccentrics like E-40 and Suga Free. But his approach feels novel and raw, not hyperstylized. Debates about rap’s generational crisis — agonizing over younger rappers less concerned with the work of rhyme than their elders — have by now become frequent and tiresome, but Blueface’s music has spawned the unusual circumstance of people actually debating about art, rather than presentation. (“In Defense of Blueface” read one Pitchfork headline.) A YEAR AGO, Blueface had just a few songs up on SoundCloud; now, he’s at the dawn of his mainstream ascendance, meaning that to some, he’s a cause for excitement, and to others, a cause for concern. In Colorado Springs, during a jovial set for a couple hundred enthusiasts, he did the mop thing, the eyebrow thing, the bust down. Some women lifted up their tops, and he filmed them. At the end of the night, he noticed two small children by the foot of the stage, and brought them up. How old were they? Nine and 11, they replied. A mischievous look came over his face and he asked if they’d ever seen a woman’s breast before. They didn’t quite know what to make of the question, and fortunately, no one gave them a quick lesson. The next night, Blueface and his entourage pulled up to the back door of the Gothic Theater in Englewood and were greeted by an agitated security guard, a couple of concerned-looking venue representatives and a baby-faced local police officer. The security guard said he’d received reports of trouble in Colorado Springs, something about underage women exposing their breasts onstage (which had not happened). Blueface was mostly quiet while his bombastic manager, Wack 100, protested, “Was you there to see that?” The game of chicken outside the venue lasted around five minutes; each side threatened to derail the night’s show before eventually relenting. Blueface remained quiet and nonconfrontational, more accommodationist than rabble-rouser. The show went off without a hitch. Blueface has a sleepy, easy charm, and moves with the carriage of the athletic star he was just a few years ago. If it was the early 1990s, he’d already have been cast in a Hughes Brothers or John Singleton film. (For now, how about a three-episode arc on “Ballers”?) When he was a child, his mother, who’d moved to Los Angeles from Ohio to pursue acting, took him around for commercial auditions. “It was fun when I got picked and I was in the commercial and it was like, ‘oh, look at the commercial!’” he said. “But I didn’t enjoy it as a kid.” He stopped auditioning once he began taking football more seriously. He attended several high schools, constantly changing in pursuit of a better sports program. William Coan coached Blueface during his 2014 senior year at Arleta High School, during which the team went 8-4, averaging 40 points a game. Blueface was the starting quarterback, and talented — “Not only could he throw the ball, he could run the ball as well,” Coan said — and also easy to coach: After the team worked out in the weight room, Blueface would blast the gratingly saccharine “Clean Up,” from the Barney children’s series, from his phone. Getting groomed for the spotlight on the field has been a help in music. “You the center of attention,” Blueface said. “Keep your poise, pressure make diamonds.” Blueface moved to North Carolina to give college football a try, and his mother left California as well. When he returned after a short stint that went nowhere, her absence ended up being a boon. “I think if she was in Cali when I was doing my thing, it wouldn’t have worked,” he said. “I would have been in her nest, and she wouldn’t have necessarily agreed with half the [expletive] I was doing. It made Blueface be able to be Blueface 100 percent.” Blueface was his street name — he is a member of the School Yard Crips gang, which dominated the neighborhood he grew up in before it was his rap name. When he returned from college, he became a stay-at-home dad, caring for his son, Jevaughn, while Jevaughn’s mother, Jaidyn, would go off to work. He thought he might become a barber, and ran an Instagram account called the Fade Room, showing off haircuts and fights. But after a chance outing to a studio, he decided to pursue rapping, making a list of steps for music-business success, only some of which had to do with music. “I didn’t know what kind of sound I wanted to make. I didn’t have no influences,” he said. “I just heard my voice in the microphone and was like, damn, I like that.” He posted a handful of songs to SoundCloud, each with a different style. The one that stuck was “Deadlocs,” a casual, boastful talker with a spooky beat from an old friend, Scum Beatz. He set goals for daily play counts, and for when he would shoot a video. Then he started creating viral moments — taking informal polls on Instagram about which high school’s students were following him the most, then driving to that school and performing an impromptu concert atop his car. Rather than goof off to gain followers, he wanted to be sure his face was connected to his song: “Putting it from your ears to your eyes.” IN TODAY’S HIP-HOP ecosystem, distribution and starmaking systems are well-oiled; the fans are there before the artist ever shows up. Memes get disseminated quickly (and mostly discarded quickly too). Snippets of songs are used as soundtracks for selfie or dance videos. The music — the musician — is often merely an accent. That makes social media a necessary evil and a savage tease for upstart musicians of this generation: You have to cultivate a viral-friendly image, but not let it swallow your art. “People be famous for everything other than music and that’s what they really trying to do,” Blueface said. “But they don’t know once you get famous for being this funny guy, nobody’s going to take you serious as a musician.” Still, if it’s virality the kids want, then virality Blueface will give them. Last year, when he wasn’t yet able to Crip walk (a footwork-heavy dance pioneered by Crips), he was mocked online. So he taught himself, filming his progress. However he doesn’t always identify when the winds aren’t going his way, like when he faced backlash for recently referring to a transgender woman as “it.” He shrugged off questions about the matter. As for his living-meme Ben Franklin tattoo, he insists he was sober when he got it, not long after he’d decided to become a rapper, but long before fans had really taken to him. “The people that went with me was like, ‘Nah, don’t do that. Do not do that.’” Blueface said. But he was determined: “This is going to be the never-forget-it,” he told them. No turning back. Eventually, Blueface collected several songs he’d posted on his SoundCloud on “Famous Cryp,” which he initially released independently and has gone as high as No. 29 on the Billboard album chart. He is also signed to Cash Money West, and his new music, including the singles “Bleed It” and “Studio,” will be released via Republic, a division of the Universal Music conglomerate. “I’ve got two labels going full throttle with two singles,” Wack 100 said. Add to that guest appearances on songs by G-Eazy, Tyga and others, creating, he said, “so much traffic.” The suffusion is likely to continue through the spring; Blueface has recorded songs with Drake, the Game, French Montana, Lil Pump, E-40 and others. “‘Thotiana’ has become, like, a worldly song. It’s like ‘Teach Me How to Dougie,’ ‘Chicken Noodle Soup,’” Wack 100 said, referring to transcendent hip-hop one-hit wonders of a decade ago. “What happens is those songs will get so big and the artist will get caught up in the moment of making all the money off that song that then when it drowns out, you come with a song after the fact and because it’s not as big as that, people won’t deal with you. So I’m forced to feed them something different.” In recent months, as Blueface’s career has been thriving, there have been legal setbacks. He was arrested in February on charges of gun possession and last November on charges of assault with a deadly weapon (after he was reportedly the victim of a robbery). Blueface has pleaded not guilty in both cases. In the meanwhile, Johnathan is trying to squeeze all the rewards out of being Blueface. He bought a house in a gated community. When he last saw his mother, he gave her $10,000 in cash. Jaidyn joined him in Colorado — the two have been on and off since high school, and slowly, he’s trying to induct her into his new life. “To understand that you are literally two different people inside of one body, she’s just starting to get it,” he said. “You with Johnathan — you don’t want to be with Blueface.” This month, he’ll be on tour opening for Lil Baby. And this summer, he hopes to release a proper full-length album. But you can almost sense the creeping fatigue. Being Blueface is, right now, almost constant work. “I just want to get paid to lay down, wake up when I want to wake up, go to sleep when I want to go to sleep, and my money just be there,” he said, unapologetically. “I just want to make the most doing the least.” "

Here, Joan Jett, the front woman of Joan Jett & the Blackhearts, discusses a piece of Americana she received from a longtime friend. “Bad Reputation,” a documentary about Jett’s life, is available to stream now. I have a declaration from Abraham Lincoln hanging in my hallway. It authorizes one guy, William T. Otto, to perform the duties of the office of the Secretary of the Interior. Abraham Lincoln wrote it, and he had very neat handwriting. It’s a museum piece, an actual piece of history. My family lived in Maryland from the time I was 8 to when I was 13 years old, so I spent a lot of time going to museums in D.C. I got to see a lot of early American history, a lot of Lincoln history. My friend Paul O’Neill knew I loved history, and he gave me this Abe Lincoln letter when we were performing together in Cleveland for New Year’s Eve in 2016. Paul was like my brother. He was the lead singer of the Trans-Siberian Orchestra, but we first met when he started out as a tour manager at the beginning of the Blackhearts. He helped do whatever we needed to do when we were on the road and struggling. Once we weren’t struggling anymore, he left to make his own music. My partner, Kenny Laguna, and I sort of gave him seed money to start his own music projects and what became TSO. We were very connected. He had something to do with my success, and I had something to do with his, and this gift was his way of saying thank you. He would get me crazy, over-the-top gifts like this or like a $10,000 guitar. He was always trying to show that he recognized that Kenny and I had something to do with him having success, and he just wanted to give back. Plus, he was just a loving guy. Paul passed away in April 2017. The last time he was on stage was that New Year’s Eve when we were together, so this piece carries extra weight. This interview has been edited and condensed. "
5c6d53813a125f5075c0a96b,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/20/arts/music/breunion-boys-brexit-band.html,"LIVERPOOL, England — On a recent Saturday, the Breunion Boys — a Dutch boy band set up in response to Britain’s planned departure from the European Union — stood in a dressing room in the basement of Liverpool University doing final warm-ups for their first show in Britain. The five members stared into one another’s eyes and kicked their legs in time to orders from Flavia Faas, the band’s songwriter and dance coach. They tried not to laugh as the exercises got quicker and quicker, so much so it was silly. “This is what we came here for!” Faas shouted as the group finished. A few moments later, they took the stage at the “Rock for Europe” event. The audience in the student union hall was only about 60 people, and decades older than the crowd at a typical boy band gig. Most stood or sat at the back, looking tired after listening to hours of pro-European Union speeches. “We don’t bite,” said Joshua Alagbe, 24, one of the band’s members, encouraging people forward. “We just want to show the real love between Britain and Europe.” The group then launched into a cover of the Backstreet Boys’ “I Want It That Way.” “Ain’t nothing but a heartbreak,” they sang. “Ain’t nothing but a mistake.” In the audience, David Murtagh, 69, a part-time roadside assistance coordinator, made a face to show it wasn’t his kind of music. “But I do like their shirts,” he said later. The Breunion Boys may sound like a stunt, but the group has grabbed more attention than most activists in the bitter debate around Brexit, as Britain’s departure from the European Union is known, including in British media outlets that support the withdrawal. Since posting the clip for their debut song, “Britain Come Back,” online in December, they have appeared on daytime television and in tabloid newspapers. The video for the song has also appeared on several comedy TV shows, especially a part when Seyed Hosseini, 22, raps “look at what you leave behind” while showing his abs. (John Oliver showed it on HBO’s “Last Week Tonight” then called the band “a pretty solid argument for leaving the E.U. on any terms necessary.”) The Liverpool show was billed as the first of a British tour, although the only other stop scheduled so far is in London on March 29, the date Britain is scheduled to leave the bloc. The woman behind the group, Julia Veldman, 30, an animator from the Netherlands, said in an interview that she genuinely believed the Breunion Boys could have an impact. “I’m very sincere,” she said. “People have tried a lot of facts and arguments and they haven’t moved the debate one inch. So we can but try with emotion.” “We know this is funny,” she added. “But that’s the strength of it. There’s no light or air anywhere in the Brexit debate. Now people talk about us, and then we can say how we feel. We’re a bit like a Trojan horse.” Veldman was living in New York when she heard the result of the 2016’s Brexit referendum. “That was literally the first time I realized there were people who didn’t like the European Union, which is stupid of course,” she said. She started crying when she heard the news, she said, adding, “We’ve had peace and opportunity in Europe for so long, and I don’t want to lose that.” The idea of using a boy band to deliver her message came quickly, Veldman said. There is nothing more British than a boy band, she added, mentioning groups like Take That and One Direction. “Being vulnerable and asking someone to reconsider can be pathetic,” she said. “But when it’s young boys who can dance and sing and are hot, it’s different.” Finding guys who could do that as well as discuss the intricacies of Brexit was difficult, Veldman added. Her search lasted a year. “There’s many people with political views,” she said. “They don’t all have sex appeal.” Before the show in Liverpool, the group talked about sometimes feeling like a real boy band. They have several hard-core fans, they said, including a group of schoolgirls that regularly sends them drawings. But they also get the online abuse — including death threats and accusations they are funded by Russia or George Soros, the financier who is often villainized by many on the far right. (“I wish,” Veldman said, laughing.) But all the members insisted they are doing this because they care about Brexit. Pablo Ramos, 25, the band’s best dancer and a hotel receptionist in Amsterdam, said he had been able to move to the Netherlands from Spain only because European Union citizens have the right to live and work in any member country. “Why make a limit, a border between us?” he said. The Breunion Boys have only two original songs. (The second, “The Real Deal,” features lyrics like, “Oh, the treaties we have together / No one’s going to treat you better.”) But more songs will emerge as Brexit unfolds, Veldman said. She wants the band to sing about the potential return of a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, but is concerned about getting the right tone. At the Liverpool show, it was clear that even if the Breunion Boys cannot change the course of Brexit, their efforts were entertaining people. Within two songs, more than half the audience had moved near the stage. Most were swaying — and laughing — along. Between numbers, the band asked the audience how they felt about Brexit. A student, who said he was originally from Germany, looked as if he were about to cry when he said he feared having to leave Britain. The boys jumped down from the stage and hugged him; the audience sighed. But the biggest cheer came a few minutes later, as the group finished “Britain Come Back.” It came just after Hosseini lifted his top and pointed to his abs. "
5c4f57333a125f5075c06bc9,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/28/theater/michel-legrand-composer-appraisal.html,"I still hear Michel Legrand’s voice in my head: “Melissa! Hurry! Come!” It was morning at the Music Box Theater, an early rehearsal during the first previews of his 2002 Broadway musical “Amour.” It was 10:01 a.m., and we were all moving slowly, nursing coffee cups in the palms of our hands. We had performed the show the night before and were still easing into the day. Michel, the three-time Oscar-winning film composer who died on Saturday at 86, didn’t want to waste a minute. He pulled on my arm, speaking fast in heavily accented English, insisting that we must find a piano. As we scurried to the theater’s downstairs lobby, he told me he had written a new song for my character, Isabelle, and it would go into the show that evening. We flew down the gilded stairs, and I sat at his side at the piano. What I remember most was the change in Michel’s body language as he shared his new music. Once at the piano, he slowed down and became absorbed. He would rush you as if to an American ice cream parlor on a crowded summer afternoon — and then offer you a slowly simmered French meal. I sat as he played, and marveled quietly when his hands turned the melody unexpectedly, a new minor key, a delicious twist that only he could have invented. Of course the song, “Other People’s Stories,” with lyrics by Jeremy Sams, was beautiful, perhaps the best remembered in the show. And it was in “Amour” by 7 p.m. that night, typed hurriedly by a stage manager and taped into a magazine prop so I could literally read it as I sang in front of a thousand people. This mix of wild energy and plaintive emotion governed Michel’s extravagantly well-lived life. Music was urgent to him. Well, almost everything was urgent to him — try hailing a New York taxi with him, oh!, the impatience — and then at the piano, he was transformed, calm. It’s almost impossible to believe what a day with Michel could be like. Once, while we were recording in Paris, he suddenly asked if my husband, Patrick, and I would like to fly with him to Spain for a quick vacation. We shrugged and agreed. Only after we got to the airport did we realize that he really meant “fly with him” — he was the pilot of his own tiny plane, and flew us out through a rainstorm over the Pyrenees. Landing for a picnic lunch, we had hardly caught our breath when he happily explained that he was due that night in Andorra for a concert with the pianist Chucho Valdes, and we had been drafted as his drivers. There we were in the front seat of a small French car, navigating our way across the terrifying corkscrew mountain roads, while Michel practiced piano in the back seat on a specially constructed wooden keyboard. (“Can you please go straighter!” he demanded of my poor husband.) The concert, when it happened, was a hurricane force of free music, with dueling pianists scatting on Michel’s classic “Watch What Happens,” stretching it to 15 ecstatic minutes. Two years after “Amour,” he and I decided to make an album together, an ambitious symphonic recording eventually called “Legrand Affair.” He came to Manhattan, and we spent a few days rehearsing his songs. Once we settled on a sensibility for the album, Michel went wild. One day in my apartment, he called the lyricists Alan and Marilyn Bergman on the telephone: “I need a new verse for Melissa! For ‘You Must Believe In Spring!’ Now, now! It’s too short! Too short!” Mere hours later, a fax came through from the Bergmans, with a new verse, adapted to that post-9/11 moment. That was what Michel’s energy could produce in others. Michel could listen, too, as well as ask. He loved that I saw his “The Windmills of Your Mind” as a poem about insomnia, and concentrated on orchestrating my interpretation. His career was full of positive and empowering relationships with women, from Agnès Varda to Barbra Streisand to me, and, most obviously, with Marilyn Bergman. Those relationships were never like that of an artist feeding a mannequin or “muse.” “Music is feeling, then, not sound,” wrote Wallace Stevens. And Michel was a uniquely feeling musician. His sensibility worked superbly in film, especially in the enchanting “The Umbrellas of Cherbourg,” which offered an unending spool of emotion. But even in the television cartoon series “Futurama,” when his “I Will Wait for You” from that film appears, it brings a true sense of loss and longing to a silly story about dog cloning. The last song Michel sent my way was called “Hurry Home,” written for a small Jerry Lewis movie released in 2016, “Max Rose.” It was one more beautiful melancholy Legrand melody, and listening to it now, it feels like a tribute to him. Unlike our orchestral album, it was stripped down, recorded with just piano and guitar. We were thrilled by the many positive responses. “Ah, Melissa, a happy avalanche!” was how he described it. A perfect phrase from Michel — but also for Michel, a happy human avalanche himself. "
5c74207a49f0eacbf105a0c9,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/25/obituaries/mac-wiseman-dead.html,"Mac Wiseman, the bluegrass balladeer and guitar player known as “the Voice With a Heart,” whose hallmark was crossing musical genre lines, died on Sunday in Nashville. He was 93. The cause was kidney failure, his companion and caregiver, Janie Boyd, said. Mr. Wiseman first made his mark in the 1940s playing with bluegrass legends, first as a founding member of Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs’s Foggy Mountain Boys, and then with Bill Monroe’s Blue Grass Boys. As a sometime lead singer with Monroe’s group, Mr. Wiseman was featured on classics like “Can’t You Hear Me Callin’ ” and “Travelin’ This Lonesome Road.” He appeared as a headlining act on the bluegrass circuit in the 1950s and ’60s. But his musical instincts were always too wide-ranging to rest comfortably within the sometimes hermetic confines of bluegrass. “Not to sound too critical, but the ‘bluegrass’ classification was the worst damned thing ever happened to me,” Mr. Wiseman said, talking about his first decade as a solo artist, in an interview with the roots music magazine No Depression in 2006. “Up until then I was getting as much airplay as Marty Robbins or Ray Price.” Mr. Wiseman’s biggest hits as a solo artist were “The Ballad of Davy Crockett” in 1955 and “Jimmy Brown, the Newsboy” in 1959, both of which reached the Top 10 of the country chart. His other early successes included interpretations of songs like “Love Letters in the Sand,” which had been a No. 1 pop hit for Pat Boone, and “I Wonder How the Old Folks Are at Home,” a parlor favorite recorded by the Carter Family. Mr. Wiseman’s signature song, “ ’Tis Sweet to Be Remembered,” was written in 1902, and his version owed as much to vintage pop and swing music as it did to country or bluegrass. “ ’Tis sweet to be remembered, on a bright or a gloomy day / ’Tis sweet to be remembered, by a dear one far away,” he crooned in a limpid tenor in the song’s waltzing chorus. The record, his first release as a solo artist, was typical of the earnest, reverberating delivery that would sustain him in a seven-decade solo career, in which he released more than 60 albums. Not merely a gifted singer, Mr. Wiseman was also a successful music producer and entrepreneur. He was the founding secretary of the board of the Country Music Foundation in 1958. Before that he spent four years as the creative director of the West Coast office of Dot Records. He also managed the WWVA Jamboree, a weekly barn dance and radio broadcast in Wheeling, W.Va., from 1966 to 1970. Despite feeling hemmed in by the bluegrass label, Mr. Wiseman was elected to the International Bluegrass Music Association’s Hall of Fame in 1993 and was for decades regarded as one of the idiom’s elder statesmen. Robert Shelton of The New York Times, reviewing an appearance by Mr. Wiseman at Carnegie Hall in 1962, wrote that he “used the penetrating, driving idiom of the bluegrass vocal leader in a most winning fashion.” Sharing the bill that evening were Mother Maybelle Carter, Johnny Cash and other popular country and bluegrass entertainers. Malcolm Bell Wiseman was born on May 23, 1925, in Crimora, Va., in the foothills of the Shenandoah Mountains. His parents, Howard Bell Wiseman, a miller, and Myra Ruth (Humphreys) Wiseman, oversaw a musical household; Mac first performed in public as an adolescent. Afflicted with polio at a young age, he went on to win a scholarship from the National Foundation for Polio to study piano, music theory and radio broadcasting at a conservatory in Dayton, Va., in the northwest part of the state. In 1946, after a brief stint as a singer and disc jockey in nearby Harrisonburg, Va., the young Mr. Wiseman moved to Knoxville, Tenn., to work as a harmony vocalist and upright bass player for the country singer Molly O’Day. He appeared both on her popular radio show and on the recordings she made for Columbia that year. In 1947 he began performing on WCYB in Bristol, Va., where he met Lester Flatt. A friendship ensued, and Mr. Wiseman joined the first edition of Flatt & Scruggs’s Foggy Mountain Boys in 1948, with Flatt on guitar and Scruggs on banjo. After that apprenticeship and his subsequent time in Bill Monroe’s band, he formed his own group, the Country Boys, who headlined the Old Dominion Barn Dance in Richmond, Va., from 1953 to 1956. He reunited with Flatt to record three albums for RCA Records in the early 1970s. Mr. Wiseman recorded for Capitol, MGM and a number of other labels after leaving Dot in 1963, creating versions of songs as varied as the New Orleans rhythm-and-blues standard “I Hear You Knockin’ ” and Fleetwood Mac’s “Never Going Back Again.” He performed in venues of all stripes, from college campuses and bluegrass band shells to the Hollywood Bowl. Mr. Wiseman hosted an annual bluegrass festival in Renfro Valley, Ky., from 1970 to 1983. He received a National Heritage Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts in 2008. Survivors include two sons, Scott and Randy; three daughters, Maxine Wiseman, Chris Haynes and Linda Parr; a brother, Kenny; a sister, Virginia Davis; three grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren. Mr. Wiseman was a harbinger of a crossover sensibility in bluegrass, as later heard in the repertoires of artists like the Dillards and Alison Krauss. He recorded with everyone from the big-band leader Woody Herman to the folk iconoclast John Prine. Emotional resonance, rather than the constraints of a particular genre, was his guiding principle when selecting collaborators and material. “I liked all kinds of music,” Mr. Wiseman said in 2006, reflecting on his years growing up in the music-steeped Shenandoah Valley. “I liked Bing Crosby and Montana Slim, and the reason that I mention those two is that they both had network radio shows, two 15-minute programs in the morning, back to back out of New York, when I was 8, 9 years old — and it just struck me that I liked one as well as the other.” "
5c7ce96e49f0eacbf105b315,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/04/arts/music/michael-jackson-leaving-neverland-fans.html,"Beyoncé has the BeyHive and Nicki Minaj the Barbz, fan groups who swarm online against anyone who disparages their idols. The Deadheads may have provided a blueprint, though these days they are more likely to bicker among themselves. But in the age of the 21st-century superfan, perhaps no group is more emphatic, organized and passionate online than the devotees of Michael Jackson, the King of Pop whose legacy includes decades of innuendo and court cases regarding what he did or did not do with young boys. Across blogs, message boards, podcasts, YouTube videos and especially social media feeds, where a Jackson avatar broadcasts one’s allegiance, they circulate exhaustive evidence that they view as exonerating for the singer, while shouting down news outlets they consider inaccurate and biased. Brewing for weeks, their fight kicked into a new gear on Sunday, with the airing of the first half of “Leaving Neverland,” an HBO documentary about two men who say Jackson repeatedly sexually abused them as children. Ads for MJInnocent.com on buses in London and digital billboards in the United States are proclaiming: “Facts Don’t Lie. People Do.” Under the Twitter hashtag #MJFam, dozens of fan accounts have encouraged counterprogramming to the film, instructing followers to stream Jackson’s music instead of watching. And on Sunday night, fans deluged the #LeavingNeverland hashtag with thousands of tweets, dominating discussion of what they called a “mockumentary” and attacking the two men at its center. [Michael Jackson cast a spell. “Leaving Neverland” breaks it, our critic writes.] Dan Reed, the director of “Leaving Neverland,” which concludes on Monday, said that his company had received “dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens” of emails from Jackson fans — “a deluge of hatred” beginning within 20 minutes of the film’s announcement in January. He and the two men in the film, Wade Robson and James Safechuck, said that some fans had taken it even further, with threats of violence. “One can only compare them to religious fanatics, really,” Reed said. “They’re the Islamic State of fandom.” Jackson’s supporters don’t see it that way. Since accusations in 1993 by a boy and his family ended with a $23 million settlement, the fandom’s party line has been that any allegations amounted to extortion plots by hangers-on hellbent on tarnishing Jackson and exploiting his naïveté. A specific strain of the Jackson faithful has pored over the granular details of his life and cases, including the 2005 trial in which he was acquitted of charges he molested another boy, in hopes of proving his innocence. Those fans — including the young and old, from Queensland, Australia to Moscow to Huntsville, Ala. — view “Leaving Neverland” as a manipulative, one-sided hit piece that rehashes old allegations from inconsistent sources. The film has also turned what was for years a niche obsession for many Jackson fans into a mainstream battle. “If you’ve been a fan for a long time, you’ve seen this over and over again,” said Casey Rain, 30, a musician and YouTuber living in Birmingham, England. He called “Leaving Neverland” a “sick attempt at hijacking the Me-Too moment.” Many Jackson fans resort to indiscriminate, anonymous hate mail targeting journalists and Jackson’s accusers. Others like Rain show their devotion in deeper ways, painstakingly constructing videos and epic polemics that weave together court papers and obscure interviews, then sharing and resharing their work across multiple platforms. “There’s nothing about Michael that the fan community doesn’t know,” said Rain, whose blog post about “Leaving Neverland” became a go-to text even before the documentary aired. “I really don’t think that we lack objectivity on him.” (Rain and others who had not yet seen the film said their information came from a few Jackson fans who attended the Sundance premiere and took “very, very detailed notes.”) Susanne Baur and Elena Ovchinnikova, who co-author the blog Vindicating Michael, said they prefer not to be called Jackson fans at all because fan “has a too negative connotation of adoration and worship,” Baur, 60, wrote in an email from southern Germany. Instead they identify as researchers and activists who view Jackson as a civil rights case. In a post about “Leaving Neverland” that totaled more than 10,000 words, Ovchinnikova, who is 65 and based in Moscow, parsed the changing stories of the two men in the film and concluded that they are liars. “The reaction of the M.J. community is absolutely adequate,” Ovchinnikova said via email. “It is the reaction of knowledgeable people who have to talk to ignoramuses.” Linda-Raven Woods, a 56-year-old from Huntsville, called herself a former “die-hard metalhead” whose lingering questions about Jackson’s guilt after his death had led her to fansites. Wowed by the depth of their research, Woods realized, “This is why they defend him so passionately,” she said. She is now an administrator of @MJJLegion, a Twitter account with more than 80,000 followers that has been busy coaching fans on how to counteract the documentary. Some of these supporters acknowledge that the elaborate lengths of their writing and reasoning invites comparisons to conspiracy theorists, or as Damien Shields put it, a “ranting mob.” But Shields, the author of a book on Jackson’s music and a fan for more than two decades, said it is all a matter of perspective: “We also view the media as a ranting mob in some circumstances.” He said that the fans’ support comes from a place of love and passion, comparing those on social media to the Britney Spears fan Chris Crocker, who cried “Leave Britney alone!” in an infamous viral video. “That’s Michael Jackson fans on Twitter times a million,” Shields said. In the cases of Robson and Safechuck, fans note that both had previously testified that Jackson never abused them, and that they later unsuccessfully sued the singer’s estate. (Their claims are now under appeal.) Both men said that it took them years to accept that they were abused and that they had felt pressured to testify on Jackson’s behalf. Reed, the director, said the film was, by design, “about how Wade changed his mind and confronted the truth about what happened to him” — a “radical reassessment of what it all meant.” In an interview, Robson said that he understood the way many still cling to Jackson’s “very particular angelic persona.” He added, “That was so palatable for so many people, including myself.” Robson and Safechuck said they, too, had faced an onslaught since coming forward, with Robson describing “thousands of extremely volatile and nasty emails or social media comments.” They cited the intensity of Jackson’s defenders a possible reason more people don’t come forward. “It’s an extremely terrifying thing to do,” Robson said. As the film’s television premiere approached, some fans struggled with keeping up the fight for Jackson’s reputation as they also girded themselves for the increased scrutiny. While some said they would boycott the film because it does not include outside context or interviews with defenders, others said they would stomach it for the good of the community. “I need to know what we’re up against,” said Woods of @MJJLegion. Shields said he couldn’t help but feel a sense of dread about the coming months: “This literally could be the end of Michael Jackson if — big if — someone in a position of repute doesn’t decide to tell the other side of the story,” he said. In the meantime, it was “almost like therapy” for fans to do their part to push back on the claims. “Even if their part doesn’t actually make any impact,” he said, “at least they tried their best.” "
5cb0cdc849f0eacbf1f83716,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/12/arts/music/met-opera-ring-tomasz-konieczny.html,"It can be difficult to tell the good guys from the bad in “Der Ring des Nibelungen,” Wagner’s four-opera saga of greed and mistakes. It’s even more difficult in the Metropolitan Opera’s current revival of the “Ring,” in which the typically villainous Alberich — the dwarfish Nibelung of the title — is portrayed with nobility and nuance by Tomasz Konieczny, in a stunning company debut. In “Das Rheingold,” the first of the “Ring” operas, Mr. Konieczny stood out among the large cast not only for his unusually rich characterization, but also for his voice: a sonorous bass, filling the Met with ease and delivered with crystalline articulation. His character returns on Saturday in “Siegfried.” Peter Gelb, the Met’s general manager, said in an interview that he was “bowled over” by Mr. Konieczny’s performance — so much so that Mr. Gelb immediately invited him to star in Wagner’s “Der Fliegende Holländer” when the opera is revived in a future season after a new production has its premiere next March. The Met could feasibly cast Mr. Konieczny in almost any Wagner opera; he has sung in all the composer’s major works except “Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg.” Last summer, he was especially chilling as Telramund in “Lohengrin” at the Bayreuth Festival; he is scheduled to return there in July. “Wagner is really my life,” Mr. Konieczny said in his dressing room recently after a rehearsal of “Siegfried.” “And I’m still learning. His music is work for life.” Mr. Konieczny, 47, grew up in Poland wanting to be a director; he was a child impresario, putting on humble shows with friends. But he ended up studying acting, appearing in some films but preferring theater. On the side, Mr. Konieczny started taking singing lessons and eventually moved to Dresden, Germany, to attend its Hochschule für Musik. After some success there and in Leipzig, he decided to commit to opera full time. Then came Mr. Konieczny’s first Wagner assignment: the “Ring.” It was in Ireland, he recalled, and he sang the giant Fasolt and Gunther, a human. The conductor was a Russian man who didn’t understand German, but everything came together after three-a-day rehearsals for three weeks. “I was in love with Wagner, definitively,” Mr. Konieczny said. “I saw what the text was capable of, how you could tell if a character was lying if what he said didn’t match the music. And every time I hear or sing it now, I can still see a new story.” He has since graduated to higher-profile “Ring” roles, including Alberich and Wotan in nearly equal measure. He has developed close relationships with conductors including Adam Fischer, Franz Welser-Möst and Christian Thielemann, who, after working with Mr. Konieczny in Dresden, invited him to make his Bayreuth debut in last summer’s “Lohengrin.” During the interview in his dressing room, still in costume and switching back and forth between English and German, he explained what went into his performance as Alberich. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation. How did you arrive at your Alberich? The most important thing for me as an actor is to see his perspective, and the possibility to change. It’s very difficult to sing parts like Telramund, because there’s not much possibility to change between the beginning and the end. But Alberich, he is completely different at the beginning. He is ambitious; he would like to have another woman, but not from his race. Wotan wants more, too — more than other gods. Both of them want more than they can have. I’m also very ambitious, so I can understand. Alberich is not a bad guy. But in “Das Rheingold,” there is a situation that makes it impossible to be good. The Rhinemaidens make fun of him, laugh at him. He only wants better love, but he ends up taking the gold because of revenge, because he is pushed to the end of his emotional possibilities. His decision to choose power is a reaction, because he is made crazy. Then how does he change again?  When he loses the ring. You have the possibility to make Alberich only the bad guy. Or you can play him as sympathetic, someone who only wants to survive the situation when he is caught. I think it is most important to make people feel with Alberich at this moment. He is suffering. You have to be careful not to make Alberich stupid. It’s never written that he’s a dolt. He is emotional; you know that this picture of Wotan catching him is so strong, he cannot ever forget it. He’s thinking of it still in “Siegfried.” Who, do you think, is the villain: Wotan or Alberich? Wotan. He is incredibly sympathetic, but he is like a mafioso. Alberich never lies. But Wotan is always lying, always manipulating. But of powerful people in the world today, who is not lying? Which role do you prefer to sing? Wotan is more interesting, and much easier to sing. Alberich is the way to contemporary music, and it’s not always good for the voice. The only big Wagner opera left for you is “Meistersinger.” Will you make your debut as Hans Sachs anytime soon? At the moment we have a really good Hans Sachs, Michael Volle [who is singing Wotan in the Met’s “Ring”]. Three times I’ve had proposals for “Meistersinger,” and I would like it very much. It’s a really fantastic part; he’s like Wotan, though never a bad guy. But I have time. "
5c5b1d913a125f5075c08550,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/06/arts/music/piano-jeremy-denk-behzod-abduraimov-leon-fleisher.html,"Over just five days in New York, three distinctive pianists at three different stages of their careers offered exceptional performances. The first half of Jeremy Denk’s fascinating recital at Carnegie Hall on Friday was devoted to themes and variations, beginning with Beethoven’s cheeky Variations on “Rule Britannia,” and ending with his astounding “Eroica” Variations,” a warm-up for the “Eroica” Symphony. The intricate manipulations Beethoven gives his themes in the symphony’s finale are nothing compared to the gnarly gyrations of the piano variations, which Mr. Denk, 48, dispatched with a winning combination of pluck and intensity. Between the two, he performed John Adams’s swirling, murky “I Still Play” Variations and Mendelssohn’s darkly brilliant and, at times, vehement “Variations Sérieuses,” written in homage to Beethoven. Schumann’s Fantasy in C, which Mr. Denk played after intermission, also nods to Beethoven by quoting a theme from the song cycle “An die ferne Geliebte” in the wistful final episode of the fantasy’s teeming first movement. This 30-minute fantasy in three movements is one of Schumann’s most ingeniously structured scores, yet Mr. Denk kept you engrossed every moment by fantastical, dreamy, and, in the rousing march movement, giddily energetic flights. This was one of the finest performances I’ve heard of an elusive and challenging piece. As an encore, Mr. Denk, who revels in mood-shifting pairings, played Donald Lambert’s 1941 take on the “Pilgrim’s Chorus” from Wagner’s “Tannhäuser,” which turns this solemn anthem into something close to boogie-woogie. Schumann dedicated the Fantasy in C to Liszt. Years later, Liszt returned the favor by dedicating his daunting Sonata in B minor to Schumann. On Saturday, the 28-year-old Uzbek pianist Behzod Abduraimov gave a stunning performance of the sonata at the 92nd Street Y. With prodigious technique and rhapsodic flair, Mr. Abduraimov dispatched the work’s challenges, including burst upon burst of arm-blurring octaves, with eerie command. I was even more impressed by how he conveyed the structure of this single-movement yet boldly episodic piece. He began with an elegant account of Liszt’s remarkable piano transcription of the “Liebestod” from Wagner’s “Tristan und Isolde.” There were danger signs from Mr. Abduraimov, however, in his account of Prokofiev’s 10 Pieces from “Romeo and Juliet.” Though Mr. Abduraimov sometimes played with captivating delicacy and milky colorings, he could not resist going for broke during the percussive, heaving episodes of these pieces. His sound was too often steely and harsh. Finally, on Tuesday at Zankel Hall, Leon Fleisher, who turned 90 in July, had a belated birthday celebration. A revered pianist and teacher, Mr. Fleisher has inspired several generations of younger musicians. He has also been a role model in the way he coped with infirmity. In the mid-1960s, hailed as one of the leading pianists of his generation, he suffered a debilitating injury to his right hand, apparently because of over-intense practicing. In time, he channeled his energy into conducting, teaching and performing left-hand piano repertory. In the 1990s, after a range of treatments, he emerged again as a two-hand pianist, though never quite fully. There have been shortcomings to his right hand’s functioning in recent years, but his playing has always been profoundly musical, as with his performance on Tuesday of Egon Petri’s arrangement of Bach’s “Sheep May Safely Graze.” Mr. Fleisher played this lovely piece with lilting sway and tenderness and brought out inner voices beautifully. He excelled in Leon Kirchner’s “L.H.” for left hand, written for him — a piece of impetuous energy and tangy, atonal harmonies. Two devoted Fleisher students also took part. Jonathan Biss gave a fervent and insightful account of Beethoven’s Sonata in E (Op. 109), marred by a couple of rough passages, and a glistening performance of Kirchner’s restless “Interlude II.” And Yefim Bronfman joined the Dover String Quartet in the dramatic first movement of Brahms’s Piano Quintet in F minor. The evening ended with fitting intimacy. Mr. Fleisher played Mozart’s soft-spoken Piano Concerto No. 12 in A (K. 414), in a version for piano and string quartet (the Dover players again) and bass (Rachel Calin). If his right-hand passagework did not always sparkle, it hardly mattered, for all the genial warmth and integrity of his playing. "
5c425a0b3a125f5075c0538e,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/18/arts/music/gladys-knight-kaepernick-super-bowl.html,"The soul singer Gladys Knight, who will be singing the national anthem at this year’s Super Bowl in Atlanta, seemed to criticize Colin Kaepernick in a statement published by Variety on Friday. Kaepernick is the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback whose refusal to stand during “The Star-Spangled Banner” — and decision to kneel instead — to protest police brutality has made him a divisive figure nationwide, earning him praise from civil rights groups, but scorn from many conservatives, including President Trump. “I understand that Mr. Kaepernick is protesting two things, and they are police violence and injustice,” Knight wrote to Variety. “It is unfortunate that our national anthem has been dragged into this debate when the distinctive senses of the national anthem and fighting for justice should each stand alone.” The statement continued: “I am here today and on Sunday, Feb. 3, to give the anthem back its voice, to stand for that historic choice of words, the way it unites us when we hear it and to free it from the same prejudices and struggles I have fought long and hard for all my life.” This is the latest twist at the intersection of politics, sports and music that has surrounded this year’s Super Bowl. Kaepernick is still in the middle of an ongoing arbitration case regarding a grievance he filed against the N.F.L. He has accused the league’s owners of colluding to keep him out of the league after not being signed last season. His protests during the anthems became a cultural flash point, even though he wasn’t in the league. Other N.F.L. players began kneeling to support Kaepernick, as did celebrities off the field. Last fall, Nike made Kaepernick the face of a prominent advertising campaign. This year’s Super Bowl became particularly fraught because of the halftime show. Some high-profile artists, including the rapper Cardi B, said they would not be willing to perform, in a show of solidarity with Kaepernick. Last year, Jay-Z rapped in one of his songs: “I said no to the Super Bowl, you need me, I don’t need you.” Earlier this week, the N.F.L. announced the halftime acts would be Maroon 5 and the rappers Travis Scott and Big Boi. Scott’s decision to participate, in particular, received backlash, including from prominent African-Americans like Al Sharpton. Variety reported that Kaepernick and Scott spoke before the announcement and described the conversation as “cordial and respectful.” But on Wednesday, several posts critical of Scott appeared on Kaepernick’s Twitter account. Perhaps anticipating the criticism, Scott announced on Sunday, in conjunction with the halftime billing, that he and the league were teaming up on a $500,000 donation to Dream Corps, a social justice group. Representatives for Kaepernick and Knight declined to comment. "
5cb210ba49f0eacbf1f83c5a,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/13/movies/guava-island-review-donald-glover.html,"Even as details were finally released earlier this week about “Guava Island,” the secret project that Donald Glover debuted at Coachella in advance of its Amazon Prime premiere Saturday, there was some confusion as to what exactly it would be. It’s not a “visual album,” in the style of Beyoncé’s “Lemonade” or Janelle Monáe’s “Dirty Computer,” nor is it a feature-length jukebox narrative, à la “Purple Rain.” (It runs just shy of an hour.) But if we learned anything from Glover and the director Hiro Murai’s previous collaborations on the FX series “Atlanta,” it’s that they don’t mind if their work is difficult to classify — if anything, they seem to revel in it. Dubbed a “tropical thriller” by Amazon, “Guava Island” has the formal ingenuity and freewheeling tonality of “Atlanta,” but Glover and Murai are playing in a very different key here. If anything, it’s an expansion, musically and stylistically, of “This Is America,” the much-seen and much-discussed Murai-directed music video for Glover’s musical alter ego, Childish Gambino. (The song is remixed and restaged here.) But the overall approach is lighter and poppier, appropriate to the tropical setting. Glover’s co-star, Rihanna, narrates the opening sequence, an animated history of the island framed as a folk legend and bedtime story, with a dash of fairy tale: she explains how young Deni (Glover) would come to her window every night to sing to her, as if she were some kind of Caribbean Rapunzel. Now a struggling musician, Deni dreams of writing a song that will unite his people, though they seem a fairly close-knit community already — it’s the kind of place where everyone bids him a cheerful good morning as he hustles to the first of his many jobs, singing jingles on the radio. But it’s not all a fairy tale; the ruthless Red Cargo (Nonso Anozie, from “Game of Thrones”) rules the island with an iron fist, and machine gun-slinging men patrol his factory floors. The plot of “Guava Island” is as thin as the Judy Garland-Mickey Rooney musicals of its distant heritage: Deni has planned a secret all-night music festival (not unlike, say, a secret musical film), but its attendees would consequently not work on Sunday, which is deeply unacceptable to Red Cargo. He offers Deni $10,000 to cancel the event, explaining, “I’m in charge of the people of this island. I have to do what’s best for everyone.” No prizes for guessing whether the show goes on, though the consequences of that decision carry more weight than usual. Thus, it’s one of those stories where the musical numbers are “realistic” (kinda, sorta) because the protagonist is a musician, and Murai takes thankful pains to work the songs into the fabric of the narrative. Yet there’s not as much music as one might expect, considering the pedigrees of its stars. Aside from Deni’s radio songs, there are only a handful of musical numbers, most of them reworking existing Gambino tracks. (Rihanna, even more surprisingly, doesn’t sing at all.) But there’s real juice to those sequences, which include a lovely, beachside rendering of “Summertime Magic” and a concert performance of “Saturday” that manages to stage the kind of joy that’s spontaneously captured in the best concert documentaries, like “Wattstax” and “Dave Chappelle’s Block Party.” Onstage, Deni frames his event as “a celebration of life — I want everyone here to feel as free as you possibly can tonight,” and above all else, “Guava Island” is a paean to the pleasures of taking it easy. “We live in paradise,” Deni fumes, “but none of us have time or means to actually live here!” Glover has pinpointed “Purple Rain” and “City of God” as the film’s key influences, but it’s also filled with echoes of the 1973 Jimmy Cliff vehicle “The Harder They Come,” another story of an island musician’s brushes with the criminal underworld. The casually gorgeous, sun-soaked photography apes that film’s grainy, 16-millimeter aesthetic (the cinematographer is Christian Sprenger, who also shoots “Atlanta”), and delivers a timeless, throwback quality; if not set in the past, the picture is rooted in a world that’s stuck there, where no one has a smartphone and everyone still listens to the radio. The film’s primary shared attribute with “Atlanta” is its cockeyed, eccentric worldview, a matter-of-fact acceptance of everyday absurdity. (When Deni is kidnapped and taken to see Red Cargo, he’s sternly told to make a nametag.) That approach proves adaptable to the thriller elements, particularly considering Glover’s gift for reactive comedy — he can get a laugh with something as simple as a shifted gaze or even a dumbfounded deadpan. Rihanna, rather depressingly, has little more to do than to be “the girl”: inspire Deni with her beauty, worry about his safety, and (the oldest and moldiest of tropes) try to decide when and how to tell him she’s pregnant. It’s a dispiriting waste of such a fiery, complicated performer. But she and Glover have movie-star chemistry and charisma to burn, and Murai knows to lean into the glorious, off-the-cuff moment when she succumbs to her love’s pleas and dances, ever so briefly, alongside him. Letitia Wright, so frisky and engaging in “Black Panther,” likewise doesn’t get much to do, but the chillingly affable Anozie makes the most of his minimal screen time. “Guava Island” was made in Cuba, and a remote, location shoot with a chummy, insular crew could have resulted in an Adam Sandler-style throwaway, merely an excuse for a paid vacation in a sunny locale. But in this light, playful effort, the offhanded breeziness is a feature, not a bug. The script is by Glover’s brother Stephen, also of “Atlanta,” but the story is credited to both men and three more “Atlanta” writers. And that tracks; it feels very much like a movie a bunch of friends thought up late one night, perhaps while sharing a blunt, as a party was winding down. This is meant as a compliment. "
5c74445e49f0eacbf105a132,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/25/obituaries/dominick-argento-dead.html,"Dominick Argento, a Pulitzer Prize-winning composer who wrote dramatically and stylistically eclectic operas in a mostly conservative idiom that was embraced by audiences but not always by critics, died on Wednesday at his home in Minneapolis. He was 91. His death was announced by his publisher Boosey & Hawkes. Mr. Argento won acclaim for orchestra works, chamber pieces and incidental music for plays, but he was best known for his 12 operas, several of which have entered the repertory. His success came during decades when many composers found it challenging to reconcile contemporary musical languages with the dramatic imperatives of opera. Mr. Argento had no timidity on that account. He said he was driven by a simple credo: “My interest is people,” Mr. Argento told Minnesota Public Radio in 2002. “I am committed to working with characters, feelings, and emotions.” Still, he took chances and sometimes employed unconventional approaches in getting at the core of a story. “When I set down to work on an opera,” he said in a 1979 interview with The New York Times, “the style, form and structure arise out of the subject matter.” For “Postcard From Morocco” (1971), probably his most popular work, an absurdist saga in which a disparate group of people appear to be stranded at a railway station waiting for a train, Mr. Argento’s model was Mozart’s “The Magic Flute” — that “wonderful hodgepodge of styles,” as he described it. For “Morocco” he composed a shifting score that matched the surrealist, multileveled nature of the story (with a libretto by John Donahue), mixing ragtime, blues, American musical comedy, pastiche and even elements of more “serious,” as he put, contemporary compositional techniques. The impulse behind a starkly different opera, “The Voyage of Edgar Allan Poe” (1976), was Verdi’s “Don Carlo,” Mr. Argento said. “I was looking for an equivalent dark, rich subject with similar deep personalities and complex character relationships,” he said. With a libretto by Charles M. Nolte, the opera presents Poe on a nightmarish journey of self-discovery in his feverish final days. Mr. Argento shrugged off a criticism that he heard regularly: that his music was conservative. He could counter by pointing to the consistent praise he earned for the technical skill and inventiveness of his music. But he was not interested in innovation for its own sake. He worked best by sticking to his instincts. “Perhaps this makes me a traditionalist,” he said in the 1979 interview. “Actually, I’m not sure that the advance in opera today has to be made through a more complex — avant-garde, if you will — musical language. We’ve tried that.” In 1958, on three days’ notice, Mr. Argento went to Minneapolis to accept a job at the University of Minnesota music department. Never intending to stay, he lived out of a suitcase for three years. But the move proved auspicious when it dawned on him, as he explained in the 2002 radio interview, that by residing in the Twin Cities he could do exactly what he wanted, without the distractions of the politics of the New York contemporary musical world. He taught at the university for 40 years, forming close associations with the Minnesota Opera, the Minnesota Orchestra, the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra and other institutions in the region. Dominick Argento was born to Sicilian immigrant parents on Oct. 27, 1927, in York, Pa. As a child he took piano lessons and taught himself music theory from library books. He served two years (1945-47) as a cryptographer in the United States Army in East Africa, then earned his bachelor’s and master’s degrees in music from Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore. In 1954 he married Carolyn Bailey, a student at the conservatory and a fine singer. She would become his informal adviser and muse. She died in 2006. No immediate family members survive. Mr. Argento earned a doctorate in composition from the Eastman School of Music in Rochester in 1957. The next year, having been awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship, he spent a fruitful period in Florence, Italy. He was fully settled in Minnesota when the Guthrie Theater opened in Minneapolis in 1963. Mr. Argento had productive discussions about opera and theater with Tyrone Guthrie, the founder, and wrote music for several plays. The Guthrie was the site of the 1964 premiere of “The Masque of Angels,” Mr. Argento’s breakthrough opera, commissioned by the Walker Art Center in the same city through Minnesota Center Opera (which grew into the Minnesota Opera.) Center Opera also presented the 1971 premiere of “Postcard From Morocco,” which brought Mr. Argento international attention. In 1975, his song cycle “From the Diary of Virginia Woolf,” written for the British mezzo-soprano Janet Baker, earned Mr. Argento the Pulitzer Prize for music. Andrew Porter, The New Yorker’s music critic, reviewing a performance by Ms. Baker and the pianist Martin Isepp at Carnegie Hall in New York the next year, described it as “a beautiful, moving, and masterly work.” Not every Argento opera met with initial success, even among admirers. “Miss Havisham’s Fire,” first performed by the New York City Opera in 1979 and loosely based on Dickens’s “Great Expectations,” mingles past and present in a drama framed as an inquest into Miss Havisham’s death by fire. The Times critic Harold C. Schonberg wrote that though the concept was interesting, it was hard to “work up much interest” in Mr. Argento’s “conservative” and “featureless” music. In the late 1990s Mr. Argento produced a streamlined version, which has been performed with success. He kept composing into his late 80s, until hearing problems set in. In 2004 he won a Grammy Award for best contemporary classical composition for “Casa Guidi,” recorded by the mezzo-soprano Frederica von Stade and the Minnesota Orchestra. Mr. Argento fashioned a text from letters that the poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning wrote after moving to Florence with her husband and fellow poet, Robert Browning. Mr. Argento published “Catalogue Raisonné as Memoir: A Composer’s Life” in 2004. Each chapter is based on one of his compositions, which he likened to children that a parent molds and guides. But eventually each child “develops its own ideas” and “becomes its own master,” he wrote, adding: “My compositions, like children, have surprised me that way.” "
5cab5f5e49f0eacbf1f819bd,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/08/arts/music/beyonce-homecoming-netflix.html,"A year after one of the most critically lauded festival performances in recent pop history, Beychella is coming to Netflix. “Homecoming,” teased by the streaming service as “a film by Beyoncé,” will be available on April 17, according to a trailer released Monday, which shows concert footage and backstage preparations from the singer’s headlining performance at Coachella last year. The documentary will provide an “intimate, in-depth look” at the concert, revealing “the emotional road from creative concept to cultural movement,” Netflix said. The nearly two-hour show at the Empire Polo Club in California featured dozens of musicians backing Beyoncé in the style of historically black college marching bands and traced “a lineage of Southern black musical traditions from New Orleans second line marches to Houston’s chopped-and-screwed hip-hop,” said the critic Jon Caramanica in The New York Times. “There’s not likely to be a more meaningful, absorbing, forceful and radical performance by an American musician this year, or any year soon,” he wrote. “It was rich with history, potently political and visually grand. By turns uproarious, rowdy, and lush. A gobsmacking marvel of choreography and musical direction.” [Read the full review of Beyoncé’s Coachella set.] Beyoncé had been scheduled to headline the festival in 2017, but pushed her performance back a year after becoming pregnant with twins. “Thank you for allowing me to be the first black woman to headline Coachella,” she told the crowd at her comeback show. The trailer for “Homecoming” features clips from rehearsals and Beyoncé’s workout routine, in addition to moments with her children and husband, the rapper Jay-Z, who made a cameo appearance at Coachella. Using a 2013 interview with the poet and activist Maya Angelou, not long before her death the next year, a voice-over on the trailer says, “What I really wanted to do is be a representative of my race — of the human race.” “I have a chance to show how kind we can be, how intelligent and generous we can be,” Angelou continues. “I have a chance to teach and to love and to laugh. And I know that when I finish doing what I’m sent here to do, I will be called home.” "
5c59da343a125f5075c08211,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/05/obituaries/izzy-young-dead.html,"Izzy Young, whose Greenwich Village shop, the Folklore Center, was the beating heart of the midcentury folk music revival — and who in 1961 presented the first New York concert by a young Bob Dylan — died on Monday at his home in Stockholm. He was 90. His death was confirmed by his daughter, Philomène Grandin. Anyone wanting to capture the essence of the times could do far worse than head to the Folklore Center, at 110 Macdougal Street, between Bleecker and West Third Streets. Established in 1957, it was nominally a music store, selling records, books, instruments, sheet music and fan magazines, most sprung from sweat and mimeograph machines, like Sing Out!, Caravan and Gardyloo. In actual practice, the center was also equal parts hiring hall; Schwab’s Pharmacy, where young hopefuls awaited discovery; matchbox recital space for organized performances and impromptu jam sessions; nerve center for gossip on a par with any small-town barbershop; and forum for continuing, crackling debate on the all-consuming subject of folk music, which thanks in no small part to Mr. Young was enjoying wide, renewed attention. “I began hanging out at the Folklore Center, the citadel of Americana folk music,” Mr. Dylan wrote in his memoir “Chronicles: Volume One” (2004), recalling his arrival in New York in 1961. “The small store was up a flight of stairs and the place had an antique grace. It was like an ancient chapel, like a shoebox sized institute.” Crackling loudest above the din was Mr. Young, who, with his horn-rimmed glasses, prodigious vocal capacity and bottomless cornucopia of opinion, was the platonic, genially abrasive New York nebbish from Central Casting. “His voice was like a bulldozer and always seemed too loud for the little room,” Mr. Dylan wrote. “Izzy was always a little rattled over something or other. He was sloppily good-natured. In reality a romantic. To him, folk music glittered like a mound of gold. It did for me, too.” Until he closed the shop in 1973 to move to Stockholm and start a similar center, Mr. Young reigned supreme as a handicapper (“The first few times I met Dylan, I wasn’t that impressed,” he said. “But as he began writing those great songs, I realized he was really something”); an impresario (he organized hundreds of concerts throughout the city, including Mr. Dylan’s first formal appearance, at the Carnegie Hall complex, as well as performances by the New Lost City Ramblers, Dave Van Ronk, Jean Ritchie and Phil Ochs); and an evangelist who almost single-handedly put the “Folk” in Folk City, the storied Village nightclub. He was also a writer, with a regular column in Sing Out!; a broadcaster, with a folk music show on WBAI in New York; an agitator (in 1961, he helped organize successful public protests after the city banned folk music from Washington Square Park); a ferocious keeper of the castle (“He was even known to throw people out of his store,” Dick Weissman, a former member of the folk group the Journeymen, wrote, “simply because they irritated him”); and an equally ferocious defender of the faith. (Mr. Young repudiated Mr. Dylan after he began wielding an electric guitar in the mid-’60s.) If, at the end of the day, the Folklore Center was a less-than-successful capitalist enterprise — who, after all, goes into folk music to get rich? — it scarcely mattered. Joni Mitchell was discovered there. Peter found Mary there, after seeing her photo on a wall. (Paul joined them soon afterward.) Mr. Van Ronk, then the more established musician, met the newly arrived Mr. Dylan there and invited him to take the stage at the nearby Gaslight Cafe. Mr. Young, in short, was the original folknik — quite literally, for it was he who had coined the term, in the late 1950s, as attested by the Oxford English Dictionary. Israel Goodman Young was born on March 26, 1928, on the Lower East Side of Manhattan and reared in the Bronx. His parents, Philip and Pola, were Jewish immigrants from Poland. As a youth, Izzy spent most of his time, he later said, “trying to avoid committing myself to anything.” Then, while a student at the Bronx High School of Science, he was smitten by folk dancing, becoming a member of the American Square Dance Group. The company, founded in New York by the folklorist and teacher Margot Mayo, revived traditional dances of many kinds. The dances led him to folk music, and he was soon collecting books on the subject. He attended Brooklyn College but did not finish. In the mid-1950s, after working for several years at Borough Park Shomer Shabbos, the bakery his father had established in Brooklyn, Mr. Young became a dealer in rare folk-music books. His private clients included Harry Belafonte and Burl Ives. He opened the Folklore Center in April 1957, and it quickly became a mecca for pleasurable activity of all kinds. “Drugs weren’t allowed,” Mr. Young told the newspaper The Weekend Australian in 2013. “But every time you opened the toilet door a big cloud of purple smoke would waft out.” In the early 1960s, Mr. Young persuaded a Village restaurateur, Mike Porco, to emphasize folk musicians at his establishment, Gerdes. They proved such a success that the restaurant’s name was changed to Gerdes Folk City and eventually simply to Folk City. Over the years, Folk City featured the likes of Mr. Dylan, Joan Baez, Judy Collins, Tom Paxton and Muddy Waters. It closed in 1987. In 1961, Mr. Young helped spearhead a protest known in the press as the Beatnik Riot. That year, the New York City Parks Department, under pressure from conservative groups and real estate interests, banned folk musicians from Washington Square Park. The park, in the heart of the Village, had been a traditional gathering and performing place for musicians since the 1940s. With the Rev. Howard R. Moody, the minister of the nearby Judson Memorial Church, Mr. Young formed the Right to Sing Committee. On April 9, 1961, as scores of New York City police officers looked on, the committee staged a protest in the park, with hundreds of musicians marching and singing. “I have everybody singing ‘The Star Spangled Banner,’ ” Mr. Young told NPR in 2011. “I said, ‘They can’t hit us on the head while we’re doing that.’ ” The committee held more demonstrations in the weeks that followed but could not stop the State Supreme Court from upholding the city’s ban later that spring. In July, however, an appellate court lifted the ban, and the park was once more awash in folk music. The Folklore Center moved to Sixth Avenue in 1965. Eight years later, after being transfixed by traditional Swedish fiddle music, Mr. Young closed the store and relocated to Stockholm, where he opened the Folklore Centrum. There, as in New York, he led a threadbare existence. In 2014, Mr. Young put up for auction at Christie’s the manuscripts of two obscure early songs by Mr. Dylan: “Talking Folklore Center,” about the old Macdougal Street establishment, and “Go Away You Bomb,” about nuclear disarmament. Both failed to meet their reserve price and were not sold. The Folklore Centrum remained open and active for more than four decades; Mr. Young was presenting concerts there as late as the spring of 2018. But that November the center announced that it would be closing at the end of the month “due to Izzy’s age.” The announcement said that Mr. Young’s daughter, Ms. Grandin, a Swedish actress, had “spent the last few months cataloging and packing up Izzy’s vast folklore library” and hoped to sell it “as one collection to any interested parties.” “It’s sad to close the place,” Ms. Grandin said at the time, “but it has been a beautiful ride and it’s so nice to see all the love and music that Izzy is still surrounded with.” In addition to Ms. Grandin, Mr. Young is survived by a son, Thilo Egenberger, and three grandchildren. Mr. Young was the subject of a documentary, “Izzy Young: Talking Folklore Center” (1989), directed by Jim Downing. His Sing Out! columns and other articles were anthologized in “The Conscience of the Folk Revival: The Writings of Israel ‘Izzy’ Young” (2013), edited by Scott Barretta. Perhaps Mr. Young’s most memorable achievement came in presenting Mr. Dylan’s first New York concert, at Carnegie Chapter Hall — a space of about 200 seats above what is now Weill Recital Hall, on West 57th Street — on Nov. 4, 1961. The program included Woody Guthrie’s “1913 Massacre” and Roy Acuff’s “Freight Train Blues.” Though the concert is now considered a landmark, Mr. Young, who charged $2 a ticket, lost money. “There were only 53 people there,” he told an interviewer in 2004. “Now 3,000 people remember it well.” "
5c76b45e49f0eacbf105a73d,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/27/opinion/grateful-dead-dark-star-anniversary.html,"It was a slow winter day, and I had just left the Anthology Film Archives in New York after a screening of “Andy Warhol’s Frankenstein.” It had seemed like a long afternoon, what with the beheadings and the orgies and whatnot. Curiously, Baron von Frankenstein insisted on calling his creature’s nose its “nasum.” Also, he observed that “in order to know death, you have to” — let’s paraphrase here — “know life in the gallbladder.”  I stood there on Second Avenue, more than a little discombobulated. And then, from an open window, I heard Jerry Garcia singing, like the voice of an old friend. “Dry your eyes on the wind,” he sang. Garcia’s mother took him to see “Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein” when he was 6 years old, he once said in an interview. “My father had just died the previous year. That was my first sense that there are things in this world that are really weird, and there are people who are concerned with them. I think that sounds like fun.” It was fun. And it was 50 years ago today — Feb. 27, 1969 — that Garcia and the Grateful Dead stood onstage at the Fillmore West and recorded the live version of “Dark Star,” a song that is still about as fun, and as weird, as American rock ’n’ roll can be. Lou Reed, the heart of Andy Warhol’s house band, the Velvet Underground, didn’t have much patience for the Dead. “All those people are the most untalented bores that ever lived,” he said of the San Francisco scene. “It’s a joke.” But the Velvets and the Dead had a lot in common, and by this I mean more than the fact that they were both originally called The Warlocks. Both liked to stretch tunes out into long improvisations; both had band members (John Cale and Phil Lesh, respectively) with roots in avant-garde music. Cale described the Velvets’ music this way: “It was an attempt to control the unconscious with the hypnotic.” Who else does that sound like? [For a track list of Jennifer Finney Boylan’s favorite performances of the Grateful Dead’s “Dark Star,” scroll to the bottom.] “Dark Star,” the Dead’s most hypnotic tune, began with the band rehearsing at the Rio Nido in Sonoma County in the summer of 1967. Listening to the music from the next room, the poet Robert Hunter wrote down its first verse: “Dark star crashes, pouring its light into ashes. Reason tatters, the forces tear loose from the axis. Searchlight casting for faults in the clouds of delusion.” And then, the Prufrockian chorus: “Shall we go? You and I while we can, through the transitive nightfall of diamonds.” After the lyric, in most performances, the song turns catty-wompus. There is ambient warping and woofing. There is electronic weeping. Sometimes this part of the tune gives way to something else — jazz riffs, dance music, cowboy songs, the ballad “St. Stephen.” You never know what you’ll get. It’s that uncertainty that I’ve always loved best in the composition, its sense of infinite possibility. Of the nearly 250 times the band played the song live, no two versions are the same. But it’s more than the tune that keeps changing. Usually, the thing that has changed between each listening is me. I heard it as a young hippie thing sitting in a friend’s bedroom in Merion, Pa. I heard it the night my daughter was born, in Maine. I listened to it this summer as my wife and I, celebrating 30 years of marriage, hiked the Cinque Terre in Italy. There are versions of it in which the audience is clapping along, like it’s a dance tune. There are versions of it that sound a lot like a half-hour of musique concrete, or as my mother described it, “like someone left the vacuum cleaner on.” Some nights the band did only the first verse, and things devolved from there. This happened during the very last performance of the song, in fact — on March 30, 1994, in Atlanta. Now and again I imagine a world in which Jerry Garcia is alive once more, and the band comes together, to finish what they started that night, and we are all young again. But Jerry Garcia is gone, of course, as is Andy Warhol, as is Lou Reed, and the world in which they created art has been largely eclipsed by commerce. At the gift shop of the Warhol show at the Whitney right now you can buy a set of Warhol-themed skateboards for $1,750. But we still have “Dark Star,” in all its beautiful, terrifying weirdness. Bob Dylan once described folk music this way: “It’s the only music where it isn’t simple. It’s weird, full of legend, myth, Bible and ghosts, chaos, watermelons, clocks, everything. “ If you haven’t listened to the tune for a long time — or if you’ve never heard it — the 50th anniversary today is a good excuse. There are a lot of strange things to uncover in “Dark Star”; ghosts and chaos and watermelons and clocks may be the least of them. As Warhol’s Frankenstein observed, there are a lot of ways to know life. Music is one of them. Turn and face the strange. It’s fun. Twelve Classic Performances of “Dark Star” by the Grateful Dead Before checking out these 12 performances, it’s worth reading Robert Hunter’s lyrics here; this version includes the final coda, never performed live. He composed the first verse lying on his bed, listening to the band in a rehearsal space nearby.  “I don’t have any idea what the ‘transitive nightfall of diamonds’ means,” he wrote. “It sounded good at the time. It brings up something you can see.” The chorus echoes T.S. Eliot’s “Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock.”  Several weeks later, Garcia requested a second verse. As he wrote it in Golden Gate Park, a stranger passed by. “In case anything ever comes of it,” Hunter told him, “this is called ‘Dark Star.’” I asked David Lemieux, the band’s official archivist, how he would describe the significance of the song within the band’s catalog. “It’s a song with endless possibilities,” he said, “and in true Dead fashion, they explored every possibility the ‘Dark Star’ musical landscape allowed. Although there are consensus ‘best versions,’ every single performance is worth exploring.” Here are 12 classic performances, starting with the best known version, performed 50 years ago today. The next three versions were selected by Mr. Lemieux, the rest by me. 1. Fillmore West, San Francisco, Feb. 27, 1969. From the 1969 “Live Dead” album. On the original vinyl, “Dark Star” jammed into “St. Stephen,” and “The Eleven” and “Turn On Your Lovelight.” The live version of the song that began this sequence, “Mountains of the Moon,” was not released until the full four-night run of the Fillmore shows was made available in 2005. Running time: 23:17. 2. Fillmore East, New York City, Feb. 13, 1970. Mr. Lemieux: “This was the first version of ‘Dark Star’ I heard after ‘Live/Dead,’ the highlight of the first box of cassettes I received in 1984. Its melodic upbeat coda is in stark contrast to the primal, psychedelic, orchestrated chaos of 2/27/69 and shows where the Dead were heading. In the age of the Grateful Dead’s foray into Americana, ‘Dark Star’ from 2/13/70 demonstrated that they were still able to pull off improvised, psychedelic/melodic bliss.” Running time: 29:42. 3. Veneta, Ore., Aug. 27, 1972. “On a hot, sunny day near Eugene, Ore., playing in a field to their tribe, the Dead played a ‘Dark Star’ that is about as dynamic as they ever got with this song in this era,” Mr. Lemieux said. “From the smoothness of the opening section of the song to the meltdown, drum-and-bass duet, and its rising-from-the-ashes triumphant return to light, this ‘Dark Star’ is one of the most deep and joyous journeys the Dead ever took.” Running time: 31:40. 4. The Spectrum, Philadelphia, Penn., Sept. 21, 1972. “Similar in structure to 4/8/72, this ‘Dark Star’ has it all, from the psychedelic depths of its earlier incarnations to the jazz-inflected introspective moments, to an ending that is all bouncing and smiles,” Mr. Lemieux said. “It’s versions like this that make me think the band must have even surprised themselves. This is not composed music, but rather improvisation that is as structured as though they’d played this closing a hundred times.” Running time: 37:08. 5. The Family Dog at the Great Highway, San Francisco, Calif., Nov. 2, 1969. Nine months after the “Live Dead” version, the song has become quieter and more reflective. Organist Tom Constanten, known as T.C., is particularly inventive this night; note how he takes the song in a curious direction at about 6:45. Running time: 30:16 6. Fillmore East, New York City, Sept. 19, 1970. This recording begins mournfully. It was the day after the death of Jimi Hendrix. Mid-song, however, things change. Running time: 25:23. 7. Capitol Theatre, Port Chester, N.Y., Feb. 18, 1971. The Dead played a number of legendary shows at this venue; this one jams into the song “Wharf Rat” before evolving again into something later simply described as the “Beautiful Jam.” Running time: 21:42. 8. Wembley Empire Pool, London, April 8, 1972. The band’s spring 1972 tour of Europe was a triumph. This version of the song features the delicate piano of the keyboardist Keith Godchaux. Running time 32:09. 9. Miami Arena, Miami, Oct. 26, 1989. Brent Mydland joined the band as keyboardist in 1979 and gave the Dead a jolt of new energy. This “Dark Star” captures that version of the band, and of the song. Running time: 26:40. 10. Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum, Oakland, Calif., Oct. 31, 1991. The band performed on Halloween, in the wake of the death of their friend, the concert promoter Bill Graham. On that occasion, they were joined onstage by the author Ken Kesey, who was himself in mourning over the loss of his son. Midway into the tune, Kesey reads the e e cummings poem “Buffalo Bill’s Defunct.” Running time: 11:06. 11. The Omni, Atlanta, March 30, 1994. The last performance. Garcia sings only the first of the two verses, leaving the song forever unfinished. The weariness in his voice is heartbreaking. Garcia would die of a heart attack 17 months later, on Aug. 9, 1995. Running time: 10:29. 12. No compendium of “Dark Star”s is complete without a version of the original “single” of the song, from 1968. Garcia considered this short version a flop. It’s historically interesting for the banjo riff at the very end, along with the only recording of the lyricist Robert Hunter’s voice on a Grateful Dead record, performing what he called a “word salad” in the final seconds.

5c668e133a125f5075c09e0e,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/15/nyregion/saturdays-in-the-bronx-with-bach.html,"Sean Arias, 7, casually dressed in sweats and sneakers, climbed atop the piano bench, sat down on an aging textbook — a makeshift booster seat — and rested his feet on a copy of The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz. His instructor, Santiago Lomelin, a doctoral student at Rutgers University, led him through a series of warm-ups before flipping open a book to a short Bach piece. “Let’s learn a new song,” Mr. Lomelin said. Sean edged forward with finicky excitement, peering at the notes. He paused for a moment, processing — then leaned back in his seat and began to play, exploring the music with an impressive dexterity. “This program — thank God,” whispered Sean’s mother, Vanessa Peña, who was seated behind him in the practice room. “It’s been a true blessing. I’ve seen my son blossom.” Step into the Bronx Community College’s Guggenheim Hall at 8:45 on Saturday morning and you’ll find the sleepy weekend routine of the average American university: empty hallways, unlit classrooms, the hiss of a radiator. Fifteen minutes later, though, the place transforms — brimming with children (some as young as 4) and a handful of adults, each of them here for one-on-one classical instruction with some of New York’s most promising musicians. It’s a recurring scramble for classical music in a city perpetually starved for space. Since 1991, the Bronx Conservatory of Music, a nonprofit arts organization, has provided low-cost education in classical music to a constituency that has been historically underexposed to the tradition. And at a time when music classes are being cut from public schools everywhere, it has become an unlikely success story: a weekly pop-up school that trains students, more than 80 percent of whom are black or Hispanic, in a musical tradition long characterized by a lack of racial diversity. In the last four years, the school, led by a team of talented and ambitious young instructors, has seen its enrollment more than triple — there are around 170 students now, up from 50. But that success may ultimately jeopardize the school. The surge in students has led to increased anxiety about its relationship with Bronx Community College, which has allowed the school to operate out of its music department on Saturdays free of charge. “We’re really at capacity now in this location,” said Douglas W. Meyer, the conservatory’s music director and treasurer. He described the program’s arrangement with the college for the last three decades as an essential part of its operating model. “We’re able to provide competitive compensation to our teachers and the lowest possible tuition rates to our students because we are the recipient of the largess of the college, for which we are eternally grateful,” he said. “The good news is, we don’t have to maintain permanent facilities,” Mr. Meyer explained. “The flip side is that we’re here at the pleasure of the college.”  Changes to the arrangement, he said, could easily pose an existential threat; a rise in costs to offset rental payments, for example, could push the price of lessons beyond the reach of many students. A lack of permanent facilities also means that students must find a place to practice during the week. Students studying violin, cello and guitar can borrow an instrument from the school. (Many were donated to the school by WQXR, the city’s classical music radio station, following one of its instrument drives.)  But for students of piano, far and away the most popular instrument at the school, finding a piano to use can be a challenge.  “The dream,” said Philip Kwoka, the school’s executive director, “is to raise enough money for a permanent space where kids can come all throughout the week to practice.” Since space is already limited, the school has had to add dozens of families every year to its wait-list. “Our goal is eventually to be in a position where we can give everyone who’s interested an opportunity to study here.” It’s exactly the deal that draws in many of the families. The Bronx Conservatory charges $23 for a 30-minute lesson and $46 for an hour, and those prices include supplemental group-based instruction in rhythm, percussion and music theory. (Elsewhere in New York City, private music lessons can easily top $100 per hour.)  The teachers at the conservatory are mostly young graduates or postgraduates from schools in and around New York: Juilliard, Mannes, the Manhattan School of Music. Most balance teaching schedules with their own performance demands. “This school makes classical musical accessible to us,” said Frayma Rodriguez, who attended Bronx Community College and whose son, Jeremy, 11, studies guitar at the conservatory. “It’s here in the community, and it’s not too expensive.” Martha Forte, whose son, Antonio, 8, studies violin, travels from Yonkers each Saturday for his lessons. “The Yonkers public schools, they’ve slowly cut arts programs to bare bones,” she said. “It’s a 20-minute drive to get here, but it’s so much more affordable.” Ms. Forte is especially impressed with the commitment of the instructors, she said, adding that Antonio’s teacher, Katherine Dennis, will often FaceTime with the family during the week to help Antonio address various musical issues. Despite its relatively small size, the Bronx Conservatory has had ripple effects in the broader community. Janell Alvarez, 16, has attended the conservatory since she was 7, first as a student of piano and later of voice. When changes at her local church, St. Helena’s in Parkchester, left one of its Masses without an organist, Janell trained to fill in for the role. She now performs at the 5 p.m. service every Sunday. The school has been similarly transformative for Joaquin Estrella, a 10-year-old piano student. One of the school’s more advanced pianists, Joaquin won a full scholarship through the Bronx Conservatory last year to attend a summer camp at the Luzerne Music Center, an immersive musical program in New York’s Adirondack Mountains. “That was a very special experience for me,” said Joaquin, who wants to be a professional musician. “It gave me a chance to fit in.” His father, Jorge, stressed the importance of having found a suitable arts program that’s situated in the Bronx, where the family lives. “There’s a lot of cultural richness here, but the borough is really drained of resources,” Mr. Estrella said. “And if we want the Bronx to thrive, then we have to make a commitment to change, and to stay here, and to support programs like this.” That support is sometimes hard to come by. Fund-raising is now one of the organization’s biggest focuses, according to Mr. Kwoka, who is eager to find a way to welcome all the students currently on the wait-list and to provide more scholarships. But there are always smaller concerns, too: filing tax forms, registering students, rearranging teaching schedules to accommodate absences. And at the end of each Saturday, Mr. Kwoka has to pack away his computer, tidy the classrooms and box up the printer. By then, Guggenheim Hall has transformed back into a college campus. There is little to suggest that dozens of kids have spent their Saturday here playing classical music — aside, perhaps, from a set of music stands that might seem curiously low to the college students who use them during the week.

5c8518bf49f0eacbf105c4b8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/10/movies/don-shirley-david-hajdu-green-book.html,"Like Mahershala Ali as he accepted the best supporting actor Oscar for his portrayal of the pianist Donald Shirley in the best picture winner “Green Book,” I always, or almost always, called him Dr. Shirley. He instructed me to do so within a few minutes of our first conversation, in December 1992, and I honored his wishes in the dozen or so long and unruly talks we had over nearly 10 years. Though I can’t speak directly to the accuracy of “Green Book” — I wasn’t part of the events depicted in the film — I came to know Dr. Shirley well in the 1990s, and the man I knew was considerably different from the character Ali portrayed with meticulous elegance. Cerebral but disarmingly earthy, mercurial, self-protective, and intolerant of imperfections in all things, particularly music, he was as complex and uncategorizable as his sui generis music. I approached him at the suggestion of the arranger and composer Luther Henderson, for insight into their mutual friend Billy Strayhorn, whom I was researching for my 1996 biography of Strayhorn, “Lush Life.” Henderson phoned him at the end of one of our interviews, while the tape recorder was still running, and said, “F.B.!” Henderson laughed, looked my way and winked. “I have a boy here who’s writing a book about Swee’ Pea,” he said. “Give him the real story, and try to behave yourself.” Henderson laughed some more, chatted awhile, hung up, and told me Dr. Shirley said I should write a proper letter of introduction and mail it to him care of Carnegie Hall. I asked Henderson what he meant by “F.B.” He said those were initials for his nickname for Shirley, “Funky Butt,” and recommended I use a less informal term of address. When Dr. Shirley received my letter he phoned me, correcting me for addressing him in the correspondence as “Mr. Shirley.” His first name, he added for the record, was Donald. He “despised” the familiar Don, he said, because he considered it “vulgar.” I replied that I understood and promised not to ask what “F.B.” stood for. After a pause, he barked, “Fine,” and invited me to his home that evening. As “Green Book” shows, Dr. Shirley had been living for decades in one of the magisterial studios above Carnegie Hall. He greeted me in casual finery: billowing, satiny pants and beaded slippers, with an intricate carved medallion dangling over a white turtleneck. He had a plate of cheese and crackers, and a bottle of sparkling apple juice set up on a small table. I soaked in the faded opulence of the space, a gallery of art objects and knickknacks collected over a lifetime of world travel, lit solely by early evening light pouring through windows overlooking West 57th Street. In the center of the room, there was a nine-foot Steinway concert grand piano, and alongside it, an industrial humidifier for the preservation of the instrument. I requested permission to record our conversation, and Dr. Shirley held up an index finger to mime “Hold on a minute.” Before he would agree to speak on the record, he needed to evaluate my competence as a musician, he said, instructing me take a seat on the piano bench and play something of my choice for him. While I can read music, with effort, and play almost serviceable rock-band piano, I don’t consider myself worthy of polishing a Steinway concert grand. I tried to explain that I thought of scholarship, rather than musicianship, as the discipline relevant to my purpose with him, and demurred with feigned gratitude for the opportunity. Immovable on the matter, Dr. Shirley clapped his hands twice quickly, as if to signal the start of an imperial amusement. I took a seat at the piano and plunked my way through a semblance of “One for My Baby (and One More for the Road),” the only standard I could think of that’s close enough to a 12-bar blues for me to fake. “Wellll ...” Dr. Shirley said. “You don’t know what the hell you’re doing. I can’t imagine what we could possibly talk about.” I asked if he could apply his obvious expertise to the subject of my research, Billy Strayhorn, and his collaborator and sponsor, Duke Ellington, and we were set for the evening. I had to wrap things up mid-conversation because I had brought only two 90-minute tapes. Dr. Shirley could expound with deep authority and even deeper passions on the subject of music — or, I soon learned, on the subjects of human psychology, American society, politics, cuisine, fine art, folk art, commercial art ... whatever struck him as suitable for exposition at the moment. The second time we met in his studio, he cut me off after about an hour and said: “All you want to talk about is Billy Strayhorn. Is that the only thing you care about?” Clearly well read and gifted with extraordinary capacities for recall and synthetic analysis, he had a seemingly inexhaustible body of knowledge at ready disposal and fierce opinions about everything. “The intellectual curiosity of creative people is something always present,” he told me. “It’s not something you go out one night and come home with, like the damn clap.” Erudite and salty in roughly equal measures, he once broke down the musical structure of Rachmaninoff’s “Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini” in eloquent detail, adding that “it was employed in the score of ‘The Red Shoes,’ but nobody hears it because they’re too busy staring at the girl’s legs.” After about a year, I ran out of things to ask him about Strayhorn and Ellington, but we continued to get together in his studio for conversation and cheese and crackers. He did nearly all the talking, though his talk shifted easily into ranting, often screaming, sometimes in objection to things I did or said. He loathed the magazine I was working for, Entertainment Weekly, while I researched my book, though he never once read it — on principle, he said — and conflated it with the puffy TV series “Entertainment Tonight.” For the first several years of our friendship — and I did come to see it as a friendship, because there was no longer business in it — I served as president of the Duke Ellington Society, a hybrid study group and fan club, and Dr. Shirley found the idea of the organization offensive. “It’s idol worship,” he said. “It’s uncivilized. You need to resign immediately!” (I did not.) I saw his fiery temper as an outgrowth of his stalwart sense of right and wrong. To me, it seemed of a piece with the exquisite sensitivity of his musicianship. One afternoon in September 1993, I interviewed the choreographer Talley Beatty, who had collaborated with Strayhorn and Ellington, and he asked me if I had talked to Donald Shirley. Indeed, I told him, I saw him fairly regularly. Beatty suggested we go together to Dr. Shirley’s studio that evening, because he wanted to hear him play Scriabin. A few hours later, I was sitting with Beatty as Dr. Shirley played the Scriabin Prelude No. 15 in D flat (from Op. 11), for us. At the conclusion, Beatty and I were both so shaken by the beauty of the music that we were on the brink of tears. Dr. Shirley looked at us and said: “Get yourselves together. This isn’t a damn wake!” For all his freewheeling pontificating, there were a few subjects Dr. Shirley refused to discuss. He would never tell me where he earned his Ph.D., but would say only that he had three advanced degrees from various institutions. There were aspects of his private life, as well, that he discussed with me strictly on the condition that I would not quote him on these matters by name. Not long after my biography of Strayhorn was published, the film rights were optioned, and the columnist Liz Smith published an item noting that Denzel Washington would make an excellent Ellington. The next time I visited Dr. Shirley, I told him the news and asked him how he would feel about being portrayed on screen. “Damn foolishness,” he said. “I want nothing to do with it!” "

5c76a64e49f0eacbf105a710,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/27/arts/music/21-savage-arrest-ice.html,"ALPHARETTA, Ga. — At the beginning of the year, 21 Savage was at his commercial apex. His second album, “I Am > I Was,” spent two weeks atop the Billboard album chart. “Rockstar,” his collaboration with Post Malone, was nominated for two Grammys, and he was set to perform at the ceremony. But now he has a new, perhaps even higher-profile public role: To his supporters, he’s a possible martyr of conscience, under fire for his choice to express his political views in his music. A week before the Grammys, 21 Savage was arrested in Atlanta and put into removal proceedings by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which said he was an “unlawfully present United Kingdom national” and charged him with overstaying his visa. A week and a half later, he was released on $100,000 bond. 21 Savage — birth name She’yaa bin Abraham-Joseph — was, unknown to most, born in London in 1992, and an undocumented immigrant in the United States. That alone makes him vulnerable to removal by the immigration authorities. But in an interview earlier this month, two of his attorneys — Dina LaPolt, his general counsel, and Charles Kuck, his immigration attorney — proposed that there might have been political motivations at play. Three days before 21 Savage’s arrest on Feb. 3, LaPolt was already putting an action plan in motion. “We had heard that they were looking at him,” she said. In late January, 21 Savage performed a new version of his single “A Lot” on “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,” with lyrics that touched on the issue of children being separated from their parents at the United States border, a controversial Trump administration tactic to discourage illegal immigration. “There was scuttlebutt after the Jimmy Fallon show” coming from “some very high levels in Washington,” LaPolt added. What she heard suggested that 21 Savage had ruffled feathers. And so on the Thursday before the Super Bowl, LaPolt dispatched another attorney from her firm, Danielle Price, to Georgia to accompany 21 Savage back to California, a more immigrant-friendly state with a newly passed sanctuary law. He declined to go until after completing his contractual commitments — a pair of concerts at events surrounding the game — that weekend. While his case winds its way through the immigration system, 21 Savage’s team has been actively underscoring the political dimension to his plight and marshaling public support. A #Free21Savage coalition of a couple of dozen activist organizations is drawing attention to his situation, and two members of Congress — Hank Johnson and Zoe Lofgren — spoke publicly on his behalf while he was still in detention. Lofgren, from California and chairwoman of the House Judiciary Immigration and Citizenship Subcommittee, released a statement opening the door for 21 Savage to appear as a witness before her subcommittee and floating the idea that he had been arrested as a result of publicly questioning United States immigration policy. “Was his arrest in response to his Constitutionally protected speech?” the statement said. “It looks like that.” Bryan D. Cox, ICE’s Southern Region Communications Director, said in an email, “We’re not able to give any additional comment on this case.” Now that 21 Savage has been released on bond, his case moves to a different docket, for those who aren’t detained. The wait for his next hearing could be more than a year. “Time is our friend,” Kuck said. “We want to make sure we can maximize the politics and the process.” When 21 Savage was in detention, he “tried to refrain from talking to my mama and my kids — I ain’t want them to hear me through the phone,” the rapper said. He did want to speak with his lawyers, however. “I don’t like hopes and none of that,” he said he had told them. “Keep it real.” Between them, there is an easy rapport. In his music, 21 Savage rarely raps above a whisper, and in person, he was contained and disarmingly calm, speaking forcefully without ever raising his voice. On the day after his release, he was wearing all black, from his Balenciaga jacket to his Prada shoes, and his demeanor was studious. By contrast, his lawyers were sharp-tongued and defiant. While they barked on his behalf, he maintained imperturbable cool. For now, anyway, they will do much of the speaking. After interviews the day after his release with The New York Times and “Good Morning America,” 21 Savage has gone almost completely silent.  HIP-HOP MYTHOLOGIES are built on regional specificities. More than any other genre in American pop, rap music understands itself as the product of place. 21 Savage’s Atlanta is and has been the center of the genre’s innovation for more than a decade now — the most vital creative hotbed of the most vital American music. So the knowledge that he initially came from elsewhere served as a useful reminder that this American music, like so many American musics before it, wouldn’t sound the same without immigrants. A quick reminder: Almost all of hip-hop’s founder generation — Kool Herc, Grandmaster Flash, Doug E. Fresh — was born in the Caribbean. The island influence continues through today: Last year, Nicki Minaj wrote on Instagram about coming to the United States as an undocumented immigrant from Trinidad and Tobago when she was 5. Hip-hop has also faced immigration crises before. Slick Rick, one of the most innovative rappers of the late 1980s and early 1990s, was born in England. In 1991, he pleaded guilty to two counts of attempted murder (and other charges) in connection with the 1990 shooting of his former bodyguard. In 2001, he was arrested after performing on a cruise ship that left American waters and put into deportation proceedings, beginning a tug-of-war over his residency until 2008, when he was pardoned by David A. Paterson, then the governor of New York. In 2016, Slick Rick was granted United States citizenship. In 2009, Shyne — a protégé of Sean Combs — was deported to Belize, where he was born, not long after completing his sentence for attempted murder, assault and reckless endangerment related to the infamous 1999 shooting at Club New York (which also involved Combs and his girlfriend at the time, Jennifer Lopez). Slick Rick was, at times, a cause célèbre, but largely among the genre’s elders. Shyne became, in essence, collateral damage of late-90s rap excess. But both cases unfolded in far less dramatic moments of the immigration debate. By rapping about the child separation policy, 21 Savage inserted himself directly into a noxious political climate. And while many rappers, from YG to Eminem to Jay-Z, have spoken openly of their contempt for President Trump and his policies, none had as much to lose. Early in his career, 21 Savage did not immediately appear as a likely candidate for a political agitator. On his earliest mixtapes, he emerged as a coldhearted menace, dulled to the world’s pain. His lyrics were bleak, his attitude bleaker. Over the last couple of years, as he has become increasingly popular, he’s been steadily remaking his public image — a product, he said, of being exposed to more of the world. “I think financial freedom made me grow as a person,” he said, speaking about his desire to help others. “I did it as soon as I had the resources and the time. ‘Cause when you first start making money, it’s like you still figuring yourself out.” “But then it’s like, O.K., we a machine now,” he added. “Now we can get everybody else right.” It was this impulse, LaPolt said, that resonated with her when she was first in discussions to represent 21 Savage last year. “I realized how much he did for the community,” she said, citing his back-to-school drives and interest in spreading financial literacy to underserved populations. “I said to the rest of the team, ‘This needs to be at the forefront of the storytelling.’” LaPolt is a prominent music industry attorney who was one of the primary engines of the Music Modernization Act, the copyright legislation that was signed into law in October and which, among other things, updates how royalties are paid in the streaming age. When 21 Savage was arrested, she put her Washington connections to work. Johnson, a Congressman from Georgia who had attended a back-to-school drive organized by 21 Savage, wrote a letter of support. Lofgren’s statement came soon after. On the Sunday of the Grammys ceremony, which 21 Savage ended up watching on a television in his detention-center cell, Kuck called ICE’s toll-free number for detainee information and learned that, unexpectedly, a hearing had been scheduled for Tuesday morning.  NOW THAT 21 SAVAGE has been released from detention, the push to secure his status continues. His legal team has applied for cancellation of removal, which is available to individuals who have been in the United States for more than 10 years, have American citizen family members who rely on them, are of good moral character and have no disqualifying criminal convictions. In interviews early in his career, 21 Savage spoke frankly about his life before music. “I done sold cocaine, sold crack cocaine,” he told The Fader in 2016. “I never sold, like, a whole brick. I done took bricks.” In 2014 he was arrested, and later convicted, on drug charges. Last year, through a first-offender program, the conviction was removed from public record, though that still had “monstrous immigration consequences,” Kuck said. Subsequently, LaPolt hired the Atlanta-area attorney Abbi S. Taylor, who secured the vacating of the plea and the dismissal of the charges. The file is now sealed. A search for 21 Savage on the Georgia Felon Search website turns up nothing. In an hour-plus interview, 21 Savage declined to speak only about the particulars of his prior interactions with law enforcement. When ICE arrested 21 Savage, it stated that he had been convicted of an “aggravated felony” in addition to overstaying his visa. At the hearing where he was granted bond, it formally withdrew that charge. “Not only does he not have a conviction, but there are no pending charges, there never will be any charges from that, and that case is sealed,” Kuck said, “so it simply never happened.” But the specter of that case highlights a potential continuing concern: that 21 Savage’s public persona — his art, his social media, his prior public statements — could be leveraged against him. (Public image, and especially lyrical content, have often been used in legal proceedings involving hip-hop artists, as seen recently in the case of 6ix9ine.) Kuck said that such topics were raised in the first hearing, though, “it didn’t come up in a way that we believe hurt our case.” “I’m very optimistic,” Kuck added. “I am convinced that we will ultimately obtain permanent residence for him.” Asked if the uncertainty he still faces causes him anxiety, 21 Savage was blunt: “Hell yeah.” That he could be used as a political cudgel isn’t lost on anyone, including 21 Savage himself. “He goes, ‘Well, I don’t want Trump to come at me,’ and I go, ‘You’re the last person he’s going to come after,’” LaPolt said. “Who in their right mind is going to come after him and not have a complete backlash?” But for someone who for most of his life has lived with the permanent uncertainty of the undocumented, he was at his most exultant and confident speaking about not having to fight alone. “It’s like putting bulletproof glass in front of a bulletproof vest,” 21 Savage said. “I’m going to stand up already, this vest already going to stop any bullet you throw, and y’all going to come help and put some glass in front of it too? This can’t be stopped. We a tank now. We was already the army — now we coming in tanks.” "
5c7d2ce049f0eacbf105b3b4,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/04/obituaries/keith-flint-dead.html,"LONDON — Keith Flint, a high-octane founding member of the British dance act the Prodigy, who sang lead vocals on the hits “Firestarter” and “Breathe,” was found dead on Monday in Essex, England. He was 49. His death was announced on the band’s Instagram account. In a post on Monday, Liam Howlett, the band’s main musician, said Flint had killed himself. “I can’t believe I’m saying this but our brother Keith took his own life over the weekend,” Mr. Howlett wrote, adding that he was angry, confused and heartbroken by the news. The Prodigy was scheduled to tour the United States in May, with one show set for Terminal 5 in Manhattan. It has not been announced whether the shows will go ahead. The Prodigy came to prominence in 1997 with “The Fat of the Land,” the group’s third studio album, which went to No. 1 in Britain and the United States and made underground British dance music a hit across the Atlantic. Mr. Flint, with his distinctive double mohawk and endless energy, was one of the main factors behind the band’s appeal, along with the band’s other singer, Maxim Reality (Keith Palmer). Mr. Flint and Maxim Reality were “folk devils” and “emissaries from techno’s psychic underworld,” Ann Powers, a New York Times pop music critic, wrote in 1998 in a review of the band’s live show. Mr. Flint explained his look and onstage antics in a 2009 interview with The Guardian. After wearing his hair in a mohawk at school, he was “chucked out and sent to a special school,” he said. “They had to hypnotize me to settle me down — I just had so much energy.” Being onstage was a release for him, he added. “It gets my mental energy out,” he said. “That’s why I’m really honest onstage. I’m not there for the beauty of my voice or to be the best dancer. I go out to express myself and stir up the audience.” Keith Charles Flint was born on Sept. 17, 1969, in Redbridge, in East London, and grew up in Braintree, a suburb in Essex. He had an unhappy childhood, and his parents split up when he was young. He told The Times of London that he stopped talking to his father entirely in later life. Mr. Flint was bright but had dyslexia. That led to problems at school, and he left at age 15. He then went to work as a roofer, according to the BBC. In 1989, Mr. Flint met Mr. Howlett at a rave and asked the D.J. for a mixtape. Mr. Howlett gave him one featuring some of his own tracks, writing the word “Prodigy” (the name of a synthesizer made by Moog) on the cover. Mr. Flint loved the music and suggested that he and a friend, Leeroy Thornhill, dance onstage as Mr. Howlett played. The band found immediate success in Britain with its debut single, “Charly,” a dance track from 1991 based on a sample from a 1970s public information film about child safety: “Charley says always tell your mummy before you go off somewhere.” Mr. Flint, who had long hair at the time, danced manically throughout the song's video. The band’s popularity grew as the British government tried to clamp down on the country’s rave scene. The Prodigy’s second album, “Music for the Jilted Generation,” with its frenetic beats and defiant lyrics, caught the mood of rebellion as young people continued to stage outdoor parties despite a 1994 law banning them. But the band’s popularity peaked only after Mr. Flint started singing. “Firestarter,” the first single from the Prodigy’s third album, “The Fat of the Land,” marked a change in direction, mixing rave music with rock guitars. “I’m a firestarter, twisted firestarter,” Mr. Flint sneered, playing the role of cartoon villain. “I’m the trouble starter, punking instigator.” Mr. Flint sang on many other Prodigy releases (the band’s seventh album, “No Tourists,” was released last year), although none found as much success as “Firestarter” and “Breathe.” “Baby’s Got a Temper,” a 2002 single, featured Mr. Flint singing in praise of Rohypnol, a drug associated with date rape. It was widely criticized and caused Mr. Howlett to rethink the band’s direction. Mr. Flint was dropped from singing on the band’s next album in favor of guest singers, although he continued to perform at live concerts and returned for “Invaders Must Die” in 2009. Mr. Flint’s life sometimes involved problems with depression and prescription drugs. In 2009, he told The Times of London that he had once been suicidal. His high-energy onstage antics were reflected in other interests, too. Mr. Flint was a lover of motorbikes and owned a successful motorcycle racing team. He also ran a pub in Essex for several years. In 2015, he told The Guardian that the bar had an open fireplace, and that every time he went to light it, somebody would make a “Firestarter” joke. “I’m like, ‘That’s very funny, you owe me a pound,’ ” he recalled saying. He gave all the money collected to charity, he said. Mr. Flint’s death prompted many tributes online, including from dance music stars and fans of the band. “He did what all music stars are meant to do,” Kathy Burke, a British comedian and actress, wrote on Twitter. “He frightened your mums and dads.” "

Age: 29 Hometown: Born in Tripoli, Libya, Gashi and his family lived in 24 countries before settling in Brooklyn when he was 11. Now lives: He splits his time between a spacious loft in Beverly Hills, Calif., and a new house in the Kensington area of Brooklyn that he bought for his parents in 2017. Claim to fame: Gashi is a rising rapper and singer who has collaborated with DJ Snake, French Montana and other big industry names. His eclectic style (he sometimes wears a patterned scarf tied on his head) and self-aware lyrics (his song “YouTube Comments” tackles cyberbullying) stem from his worldly upbringing.  “It’s very rare for a kid like me — a refugee — to say things like, ‘I live in L.A.,’ ‘I moved my parents into a bigger home,’ ‘I got my father a car,’” he said. “It doesn’t feel real. I’m afraid if I blink I will miss this moment.” Big break: As a young boy in Munich, Gashi made money for his family by performing Michael Jackson moves on the streets. He hasn’t stopped grooving since. In 2016, a video of him dancing to his breakout single “Disrespectful,” filmed by his mother, blew up online, spurring millions of streams on SoundCloud and a deal with Roc Nation.  During a meeting with RCA Records soon after, he wowed a conference room full of executives with an energetic impromptu performance. They signed him on the spot. “All my life, I can never stand in one place when I’m listening to music,” he said. Latest project: His public persona defies neat labels. In January, he recorded a cover of “Hurt” by Nine Inch Nails at Spotify’s New York Studios. The following month, he made his TV debut on “the Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,” performing his single “My Year,” with G-Eazy and a blizzard of confetti.  “The thing that shocked me was how small the studio was,” Gashi said. “Everything on TV looks super-huge, but in reality it’s like a small elementary school auditorium.” Next thing: His debut album with RCA Records drops this year. “The album is basically about a rapper who is stuck in a time machine and is forced to make ’80s music,” he said. “I am the trap Phil Collins.” His mask: Before his record deal, Gashi made ends meet by helping out his father, who worked as a janitor at his family’s apartment building in Brooklyn. “People would bully me and be like, ‘How can he be a rapper if he’s a garbageman?” he said. “So, my mother said to me, ‘Why don’t you wear a ski mask so they don’t see you?’”  He is now rarely seen without a neon-orange balaclava mask rolled into a tight skull cap. “I wear my ski mask before a performance to get into my zone,” he said.

Last year, Juice WRLD reached the Top 5 twice: first with “Goodbye & Good Riddance,” which went to No. 4, and then with “Wrld on Drugs,” a mixtape released with the rapper Future, which peaked at No. 2. The song “Lucid Dreams,” from “Goodbye,” made Juice WRLD a star of so-called emo rap, and drew particular interest for using a piece of Sting’s 1993 track “Shape of My Heart.” (Sting later remarked that the royalties he earns from “Lucid Dreams” will “put my grandkids through college.”) Also this week, Maren Morris’s new album “Girl” opened at No. 4. Ariana Grande’s “Thank U, Next” holds at No. 2, and Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper’s soundtrack to “A Star Is Born” remains in third place. Queen’s “Bohemian Rhapsody” is No. 5.

5c8f04e649f0eacbf105d964,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/17/obituaries/dick-dale-dead.html,"Dick Dale, who was known as the King of the Surf Guitar and recorded the hit song “Misirlou,” which was revived on the “Pulp Fiction” film soundtrack, died on Saturday in Loma Linda, Calif. He was 81. His death, at Loma Linda University Medical Center, was confirmed by Joseph Gieniec, a longtime friend, who said Mr. Dale had been in treatment for heart and kidney failure. Mr. Dale was a surfer, sound pioneer and guitarist whose unusual, percussive playing style and thick, thunderous music earned him the nickname the Father of Heavy Metal. He influenced the Beach Boys, the Cure, Eddie Van Halen and Jimi Hendrix, among others. Sam Bolle, a bassist who played with Mr. Dale’s namesake band, Dick Dale, for about 15 years, described him as an “aggressive and ferocious” musician who played like one of the lions Mr. Dale raised at his home. “I played a gig with him about a month ago,” Mr. Bolle said. “He was still slaughtering people with volume.” Mr. Dale was born Richard Monsour in Boston on May 4, 1937, to Sophia (Danksewicz) Monsour, known as Fern, and James Monsour. After learning how to play the ukulele, Mr. Dale developed a musical signature influenced by the traditions of his father, who was Lebanese, and his mother, who was from Eastern Europe, and by the flamboyant big-band drummer Gene Krupa. After the family moved to Southern California in around 1955, Mr. Dale’s father quit his job at an aerospace and defense company to manage his son’s career. Mr. Monsour booked him in talent shows and movies, including a cameo as an Elvis Presley impersonator in the Marilyn Monroe movie “Let’s Make Love.” But Mr. Dale became known for defining the sound of surf guitar as a musical expression of the elemental surge of the ocean, with its savage waves, its volatile crosscurrents and its tidal undertow. He played melodies that crisscrossed the beat with the determination of a surfer riding through choppy waves, forging a triumphant path above deep turbulence. “Surf music is a heavy machine-gun staccato picking style to represent the power of Mother Nature, of our earth, of our ocean,” he told The New York Times in 1994. His almost constant tremolo created friction so intense that it melted his guitar picks and strings as he played. “The staccato is so fast it heat-treats the strings,” he said. “They turn purple and black and they snap. And when I play, you’ll see a flurry of plastic — it just falls down like snow. I used to think it was dandruff. But I grind so hard that the guitar picks just melt down.” His quest for a sonic impact to match what he had felt while surfing also led to innovations that would change the technology of electric guitars and amplification. Leo Fender, one of the electric guitar’s trailblazers, worked with Mr. Dale to create a guitar sturdy enough to withstand his style — Mr. Dale called it the Beast — and an 85-watt amplifier that could crank up loud enough to fill a dance hall. “Leo and I went to Lansing Speaker,” Mr. Dale said in 1994, “and we said, ‘We need a speaker that will not burn, will not flex, will not twist, will not break.’ ” In the fast-changing 1960s, instrumental surf rock reigned briefly on the charts, and the Beach Boys used it as one foundation of their pop songs. Mr. Dale’s brash playing also found fans in Jimi Hendrix and many other guitarists, and, decades later among a generation of indie-rockers, who prized his untamed sound. Chris Darrow, a multi-instrumentalist who has been in the music industry for more than 50 years, first saw Mr. Dale perform at the Rendezvous Ballroom in Newport Beach, Calif., in the early 1960s. “The intensity and volume of the performances were such that the wooden building seemed to lift off the ground when he played,” Mr. Darrow said in an interview with the music journalist Harvey Kubernik. “Until the Beatles came along, there was nothing that drove the audiences as wild like Dick Dale and the Del-Tones. He was boss.” “The only real surf guitarist for me is Dick Dale,” he added. “All the rest are imitators.” In 1963, Mr. Dale’s music was catapulted onto a national stage when he performed “Misirlou,” an adaptation of a traditional Arabic song, on “The Ed Sullivan Show.” The song re-entered the mainstream in 1994 as the opening anthem for Quentin Tarantino’s blockbuster film “Pulp Fiction.” The drummer Dusty Watson, who performed with Mr. Dale for more than a decade, said that Mr. Dale had been sick for a while but that “he’s such a bull,” he thought he would “power through it.” “He’s an incredible loss for music,” he said. Mr. Dale’s survivors include his wife and manager, Lana Dale; his son, Jimmy; and his sister, Shirley Rudolph. His marriage to Jill Blackwill ended in divorce. For years, Mr. Dale struggled with health issues, including bouts with rectal cancer and renal failure. But he performed through the illnesses. “Don’t worry about yesterday and don’t worry about tomorrow,” Mr. Dale told California Rocker, an online music publication, in 2015. “Don’t worry about yesterday because it’s used. It’s either good or it leaves you feeling bad. And don’t waste time or energy worrying about tomorrow. “I could have a stroke and be dead. That’s why they call it the present. It’s a present.” "
5c630a6b3a125f5075c094dc,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/12/movies/the-lego-movie-2-catchy-song.html,"That song got stuck inside my head. Before a recent screening of “The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part,” a promotion for the film was playing on a loop with a snippet from its “Catchy Song.” As the chorus repeated over and over that “this song’s gonna get stuck inside your head,” I found that very thing happening on a level so maddening I had to put my headphones in and play something else, anything else, to drown it out. Mission accomplished for the comedian, actor and musician Jon Lajoie, who was asked to write a movie song that would elicit mixed feelings: “maybe 49 percent annoying and 51 percent fun to listen to,” he said. Think Black Eyed Peas’ “I Gotta Feeling” meets Owl City and Carly Rae Jepsen’s “Good Time.” Lajoie gained popularity through comedy videos he posted on YouTube, like rap parodies, fake commercials and even a song called “The Best Song.” He had a recurring role on the FX series “The League” and now records more serious folk rock under the name Wolfie’s Just Fine. “Catchy Song” has an airy sheen thanks to production by the D.J. Dillon Francis and vocals from T-Pain and That Girl Lay Lay. In a phone interview, Lajoie talked about the difficulty of following up the first “Lego Movie” hit song, “Everything Is Awesome,” what it takes to make an earworm and why he doesn’t feel bad for parents who have to listen to it over and over again. How did you end up writing “Catchy Song?” I’d wanted to do this kind of thing for a long time. But the opportunity to write music for an animated movie is few and far between, and it usually goes to Broadway people. I didn’t know whether I’d be good at all. But I wanted to at least try. The filmmakers liked my stuff enough to let me take a crack at it. What was your objective with it? At first we were going more in the direction of a song that is supposed to drive you insane, something that sort of feels creepy and brainwashy. And so I thought about it for a while and then, one day I was showering and I start screaming, “This song’s gonna get stuck inside yo! This song’s gonna get stuck inside yo!” So I wrote an annoying version of that. But eventually the movie’s story changed and it needed to be a somewhat enjoyable song. Was it daunting to think about how to follow up “Everything Is Awesome”? Yes, there’s no way to make a more annoyingly catchy song than “Everything Is Awesome.” So we thought, let’s look at the audience and acknowledge that we know this in an impossible task, and let’s lean into the meta-ness and take it one step further. We wouldn’t necessarily have to write a catchier song, we would just say that the song is super-catchy. Did you try additional ideas before settling on this? Yes, we had a song called “All Is Amazing.” We actually recorded a version of it but never used it. It was almost the exact same thing as “Everything Is Awesome” except every lyric was tweaked just a tad and every melody tweaked just a tad. In the end, we found that it was funny in the room, but after putting it all together it wasn’t that funny. And then there was this other idea where the song would be called, “It’s Hard to Follow Up a Hit Song.” So you can see the territory we were playing around in. What music were you listening to when thinking about this? I listened to a lot of Katy Perry, Taylor Swift and Ariana Grande. Also a lot of K-pop. There’s something very specifically bubblegum there with just a teaspoon of creepy. The producer Max Martin’s theories on writing a catchy song are very eloquent. They boil down to this: find a catchy melody, keep the same amount of syllables every verse and every chorus, hit the melody at the same rhythm every time, and hammer it into the audience’s brain by repeating it over and over. I definitely took that advice. Did it take a while to get what you wanted? We’d produced so many different versions of this song and were struggling to find the right sound. I knew Dillon Francis through a friend, so we sat down with him and he took our descriptions of what we were looking for. When we heard his demo, everyone just breathed a sigh of relief. And on top of that, throw in T-Pain on that chorus, who was incredible. I had written maybe 20 different verses for that song. Then we found That Girl Lay Lay. She came in and freestyled her verses. We sat there in shock and I just threw out all the verses I worked on for a year. So this song would not be what it is without them. Do you have a technique for getting rid of an earworm? Just go listen to any Beatles song. They’re the perfect example of a band doing what pop music is supposed to do but doing it in a great way that is sustainable. Do you feel bad for parents whose kids may want to hear this on repeat? I would feel bad if I wasn’t the person who has heard and heard and heard this song for a year. There’s no way anyone’s ever going to listen to this song more than me. "
5cb355df49f0eacbf1f83f13,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/14/arts/music/siegfried-met-opera-review.html,"Pity the opera directors who decide to stage Wagner’s “Ring” — for in doing so they have to figure out what to do with “Siegfried.” The third installment of Wagner’s epic, which returned to the Metropolitan Opera in Robert Lepage’s tech-happy production on Saturday, has tripped up even the smartest of “Ring” directors. Blame the source material: a title role both tedious and impractically difficult; a repetitive libretto sitting somewhere between coming-of-age adventure and dark comedy; a singing dragon. Mr. Lepage’s staging doesn’t do much to help the problems baked into “Siegfried,” a weak spot of the “Ring” that lacks the breakneck pace of “Das Rheingold,” the heart-rending humanity of “Die Walküre” or the textbook-perfect tragedy of “Götterdämmerung.” What it does help, however, is the problem of the 45-ton machine so central to his production as its primary set piece. Instead of relying on the unreliable behemoth to be as kinetic as in the earlier “Ring” operas, Mr. Lepage here treats the machine as more of a canvas for Pedro Pires’s impressive projections. Three-dimensional, interactive videos create the illusion of leaves rustling beneath Siegfried’s feet, of a pond’s surface being truly reflective. Is the novelty of video enough to carry more than four hours of music? It does add clarity — if a bit unimaginatively — to Wagner’s score, not unlike, as the art critic Roberta Smith once wrote in The New York Times, seat-back titles, “enriching meaning and making it more accessible.” But it is still, in the end, one superficial form of stage magic superimposed on another. Block out the projections for a moment, and you’ll see just how little Mr. Lepage actually engages the opera and its ideas. Where some directors might aim to comment on the material, he seems content to merely illustrate. When characters aren’t forging swords or fighting dragons, they are bafflingly static. Not for the first time in his “Ring,” stage exits are made with an awkwardly quiet walk to the wings. But good singers can lift a subpar staging. In this “Siegfried,” they transcend it. Stefan Vinke is making his Met debut in the titular heldentenor role, armed with insouciant high notes and a bright smile. His heroism occasionally veers into howling, and the strain in his voice doesn’t always befit a boyish naïf who knows no fear. (He shares the run with Andreas Schager, who is capable of breezing through the role’s most challenging passages with the shocking ease of Siegfried wrangling a bear.) But Mr. Vinke is a pleasure to watch; he leans into the opera’s comedy — and his character’s ignorance, which often comes off as idiocy. As the scheming Mime, who takes in the orphaned Siegfried in the hope of using the boy’s strength to gain the ring, Gerhard Siegel infused his tenor with venom. Mime’s brother, Alberich, who in “Das Rheingold” commits the original sin of the “Ring,” only returns in “Siegfried” for brief moments in Act II. But those scenes were among the most memorable on Saturday. That’s because Alberich is sung by Tomasz Konieczny, who is also making his Met debut and continues to stand out even among extraordinary colleagues. His resonant bass ricochets off the planks of the machine as he imbues Alberich with dignified authority. His confrontation with Wotan — presented in “Siegfried” as the Wanderer, dressed like a Gandalf of the Wild West and performed by Michael Volle — is a high point of the opera. Or, rather, low: They are both booming basses, equally mighty in a way that illustrates, with only music, how alike these antipodal characters may be. If women seem absent, it’s because there are so few: the whistle-high Erin Morley as the Woodbird; the solemn Karen Cargill as Erda; and, of course, the fiery soprano Christine Goerke as Brünnhilde. It’s remarkable that anyone in this cast was singing so well in a matinee that began at 11:30 a.m. But Ms. Goerke also had to feign sleep onstage for nearly 20 minutes before letting out a resounding “Heil dir, Sonne!” that penetrated through swelling fortes in the orchestra, crisp and controlled under the baton of Philippe Jordan. Ms. Goerke’s vigor only grew in a crescendo toward all-out majesty in the final scene, a courtship with Mr. Vinke that ended with their leaping into love and matching high C’s. For this climax of old-fashioned operatic thrills, they weren’t even standing on the machine — as if they existed outside Mr. Lepage’s production entirely. "
5c5480fb3a125f5075c0796e,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/01/arts/music/super-bowl-atlanta-rap-concert.html,"ATLANTA — “Welcome to Atlanta, out-of-towners!” the hip-hop carnival barker Lil Jon screamed to a full arena on Thursday night, as he baptized the Super Bowl weekend crowd with a torrent of regional hits. It was the halftime show that never could be — a charmingly slapdash, nearly five-hour profane parade of local heroes and of-the-moment aspirants that represented a specific place and point of view too hot for an audience north of 100 million. Though the annual mid-game concert, which lasts fewer than 15 minutes, is rarely tied to the Super Bowl’s location, this year’s choice of a headliner — the anodyne pop band Maroon 5 — has proved controversial on two fronts: First, for its lack of fealty to the host city’s constantly regenerating pool of black musical talent, and also because of reports that more au courant stars turned down the N.F.L. in solidarity with Colin Kaepernick. (The late addition of the rappers Travis Scott and Big Boi, of the Atlanta duo Outkast, did little to quell the consternation and head-scratching given the three acts’ obvious incongruity.) [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] Still, Atlanta has shown itself to be more than willing to make the most of the festivities. On Thursday, at the first night of the Super Bowl Music Fest at the State Farm Arena downtown, the city’s hip-hop royalty came together for a reverse-chronological survey of Atlanta music this century, from Lil Baby, 21 Savage and Migos to Ludacris, Jeezy and T.I. (The Music Fest concerts were scheduled to continue with more Super Bowl-esque lineups on Friday, with Post Malone and Aerosmith, and Saturday, featuring Bruno Mars and Cardi B.) Though the event was temporally and nominally linked to the N.F.L. — and came with a bevy of corporate sponsorships — football felt like an afterthought, and the crowd booed when periodic commercials for the league interrupted the music. Instead, the concert felt like the celebration of Atlanta that was unlikely to happen on Sunday. And it was part of a constellation of local events, many overseen by the Atlanta Super Bowl LIII Host Committee, that sought to highlight the city’s rich cultural past and present, including six nights of free, genre-spanning concerts at Centennial Olympic Park. (There were no shortage of unofficial parties, after-parties and after-after parties, as well, with many local artists packing multiple appearances into each night.) “I’m not going to say anything bad about Maroon 5 — I love Maroon 5,” said Maya Neguse, a 20-year-old student, as the concert began. “It’s just that they’re not lit enough for the Super Bowl.” Indeed, the arena was ready to move, responding with special enthusiasm to dance crazes that originated locally (“Swag Surfin,” “Crank That (Soulja Boy),” “Laffy Taffy”) and regional references. “If you went to Freaknik make some noise,” said Big Tigger, the night’s occasional M.C., at one point, referring to the storied black college spring break gathering. “If your mama went to Freaknik make some noise,” he added to much louder cheers, revealing the plethora of what he called “’90s babies” in the audience. The night’s performances also served as a genealogical chart for the local scene. Shorter sets from the current princes of Atlanta, like 21 Savage, Lil Yachty and Lil Baby, gave way to a fuller performance by their relative elders in Migos, who welcomed to the stage everyone’s godfather, Gucci Mane. (The most notable absences of the night were from the in-between micro-generation: Future and Young Thug.) Then came the foundational contingent — the artists who might actually be able to hold down a Super Bowl stage if Southern hip-hop could crystallize into classic rap, à la classic rock. Lil Jon, who went from crunk pioneer to EDM conqueror and is now 48, played both rapper and D.J., delivering his well-worn chants — “Get Low,” “Neva Eva (Get On My Level)” — and those of his contemporaries in Crime Mob, Ying Yang Twins and YoungBloodZ. Ludacris, the headliner, also stuck to greatest hits and demonstrations of local unity, beginning with the anthemic “Welcome to Atlanta” and a brief cameo by Jermaine Dupri. After running through the most recognizable parts of his catalog with a full band — the first of the night — Ludacris welcomed the concert’s only female performer, Ciara, who did her best to supply feminine energy with some two dozen backup dancers. From there, as the clock passed 1 a.m., Ludacris was joined by Jeezy (formerly Young Jeezy) and, eventually, T.I., for a brief foray into their proto-trap music. The three men, seemingly mellowed by age and success, stood shoulder to shoulder performing the 2005 song “Bang,” which warns outsiders to mind local Atlanta customs. “When you come this city, just know,” T.I. said as the track ended. “It’s us.” "

Generally, the music. And the comedy. Which may be why most of the best musicals of the last decade — “Fun Home,” “Hamilton,” “The Band’s Visit” — have been serious indeed. The art of being funny on the beat is mostly a lost one. But David Yazbek, the songwriter behind the musical comedies “Dirty Rotten Scoundrels” and “The Full Monty,” maintains the magic. Even his score for “The Band’s Visit,” mostly drenched in melancholy, has moments of lyrical hilarity. Let’s just say “marrow” and “pharaoh” never thought of rhyming until he insisted. That’s the top reason (among several) I have high hopes for the stage version of “Tootsie,” arriving at the Marquis Theater on March 29. Based on the 1982 movie about an actor whose stalled career revives only when he pretends to be a woman, it offers both the size and sentiment a musical comedy, in any era, needs for liftoff.

Its title is “Oklahoma!,” and, yes, that’s the same Rodgers and Hammerstein show about farmers, cowhands and frontier love that was first seen in New York in 1943. But the director Daniel Fish’s revitalizing interpretation, scheduled to open at the Circle in the Square Theater on April 7, asks theatergoers to look at a deeply familiar classic through the eyes of the 21st century. The songs, dialogue and characters remain almost entirely the same. But as it demonstrated during its sold-out run at St. Ann’s Warehouse in Brooklyn last year, Mr. Fish’s version finds provocative depths of darkness amid the prairie sunshine. BEN BRANTLEY ‘INK’ The British actor Bertie Carvel, who wore a dress for his Tony-nominated role as the terrifying schoolmistress Miss Trunchbull in the musical “Matilda” six years ago, is switching to neatly tailored trousers for his return to Broadway. But don’t expect him to be any less intimidating. In James Graham’s “Ink,” which opens in April at the Samuel J. Friedman Theater, Mr. Carvel will be portraying one Rupert Murdoch. And in this London hit about the tabloidization of British journalism, directed by Rupert Goold, any similarities between Mr. Carvel’s character and a certain Australian-born media mogul are definitely not coincidental. BEN BRANTLEY ‘WHAT THE CONSTITUTION MEANS TO ME’ Heidi Schreck’s play about invisible women and the 14th Amendment was electrifyingly topical when it ran Off Broadway last year, amid the national outcry over the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh. Sadly or fortuitously, “What the Constitution Means to Me” is even more urgent as it moves to Broadway, where performances begin on March 14. Its take on abortion as a protected liberty (and a personal turning point) comes smack up against now-Justice Kavanaugh, who signaled, in one of his first opinions, a willingness to reverse Roe v. Wade. But the play is deeper than its timeliness suggests. Though it uses the idea of debate as a touchstone — and ends, deliciously, with a live one — it’s really about how we come to question our most bedrock assumptions about the world. If that makes seeing it almost a civic duty, duty has rarely been so pleasurable. JESSE GREEN ‘THE LEHMAN TRILOGY’ Three Bavarian-born brothers who first set foot on American soil more than 150 years ago are returning to New York next month, accompanied by a centuries-spanning brood of their descendants. Their names are Henry, Emanuel and Mayer, and they — and their seemingly countless kin — will be reincarnated at the Park Avenue Armory in Stefano Massini’s “The Lehman Trilogy,” an epic tale of financial rise and ruin, directed by Sam Mendes. This three-hours-plus production features what is surely the largest cast of characters of any play in town. Yet they are embodied by a mere three, seemingly inexhaustible actors with the power to multiply themselves like amoebas: Simon Russell Beale, Ben Miles and Adam Godley. Though the story they tell — which begins and ends with the world-rocking bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008 — is one of entropy, the play in which they appear promises to be a resounding testament to the regenerative powers of theater. As befits a sprawling, globe-girdling story of historic transformation, “The Lehman Brothers” has an intricate, multinational pedigree. Mr. Massini’s chronicle of a dynasty begun by emigrants to the United States began life as an Italian radio play before making its stage debut in Paris (in French) in 2013. Its Italian premiere was at the fabled Piccolo Teatro in Milan two years later, when it ran a whopping five hours. Ben Power’s English-language adaptation opened at the National Theater in London last summer, overseen by Mr. Mendes, the very busy stage and film director whose gripping production of Jez Butterworth’s “The Ferryman” is a current hit on Broadway. Mr. Power pared Mr. Massini’s trilogy to a sleek and unexpectedly lyrical three hours (not counting two intermissions) to be performed almost entirely by three actors on an elegant but nearly empty rotating set (by the ever-inventive Es Devlin). Otherwise, empty is hardly a word to be applied to this interpretation, as I can attest from seeing it at the National last July. Mr. Beale, Mr. Miles and Mr. Godley fill the stage to repletion, as they assume the varied forms of the dynasty-founding Henry, Emanuel and Mayer — and all subsequent generations of Lehmans. And their friends, lovers, spouses, customers, rivals, ad infinitum, with a variety that continually astonishes. Unlike investors who lost their fortunes on Wall Street a decade ago, no one who leaves this encounter with the brothers Lehman is likely to walk away feeling poor. BEN BRANTLEY ‘MARYS SEACOLE’ Born in 1805 to a free Jamaican mother and a Scottish father, Mary Seacole grew up to become an international businesswoman and freelance nurse, crossing paths with soldiers, royalty and Florence Nightingale. That would be more than enough material for a straight-ahead bio-drama — but not, it seems, for the always surprising and formally ingenious Jackie Sibblies Drury, whose “Fairview” was one of last year’s best plays. In the deliberately plural “Marys Seacole,” playing through March 24 at LCT3’s Claire Tow Theater, everyone in the six-woman cast is a Mary — or a Merry, a Miriam, a Mamie or the like. The indispensable Quincy Tyler Bernstine appears as the historical Mrs. Seacole in this production directed by Lileana Blain-Cruz. The others, whose characters cross continents and time, help raise a central question of nursing even now: Who takes care of the people who take care of others? JESSE GREEN ‘WHITE NOISE’ No American playwright has contributed more to the churning and ever-evolving conversation about race in these United (and divided) States than Suzan-Lori Parks. This prodigiously imaginative writer, who won a Pulitzer Prize for “Topdog/Underdog,” has addressed the toxic legacy of slavery in a rich assortment of theatrical forms and languages, from the surrealism of her early “The America Play” to the Homeric chronicle “Father Comes Home From the Wars.” Now Ms. Parks is focusing her gaze on interracial friendships in the 21st century with the resonantly titled “White Noise,” which begins previews next month at her longtime home, the Public Theater. Oskar Eustis, the Public’s artistic director, oversees a four-member cast, led by Daveed Diggs (the original Marquis de Lafayette in “Hamilton”) as an African-American man forced to reconsider the depth and danger of the gap between black and white. BEN BRANTLEY ‘MRS. MURRAY’S MENAGERIE’ I’m not sure anyone could have imagined a duller setting for a play than a high school faculty meeting, yet in “Miles for Mary,” the theatrical collective called the Mad Ones turned the banality of the break room into a hilarious and ultimately galvanizing Off Broadway hit. As if to top themselves, the Mad Ones return this spring with “Mrs. Murray’s Menagerie,” set in (a) the 1970s; at (b) a focus group; for (c) a children’s television show. That is all we know, and all we need to know. Except that the Ars Nova production, which begins performances on March 26 at the Greenwich House Theater, features a cast of expertly light-touch farceurs under the direction of Lila Neugebauer, who made “Miles for Mary” so moving behind the laughs. If this is banality, let’s have more! JESSE GREEN THE ‘RING’ The Metropolitan Opera’s high-tech, low-energy production of Wagner’s four-opera “Ring,” which returns for three cycles this spring, has been notable mostly for its snafus. At its first performance — “Das Rheingold,” back in 2010 — the set’s massive array of seesaws malfunctioned near the end, spoiling the gods’ climactic ascent across a rainbow bridge. Another time, the Microsoft Windows logo flashed across the stage instead of the sophisticated projections that distinguish the cycle’s many locales. One performance of “Die Walküre” that was being broadcast live to cinemas worldwide was delayed nearly an hour because the “Machine,” as it became known, wouldn’t cooperate. And that’s not counting the loud creaks and whirs that accompanied its every move. But while the Met claims that the costly Machine — conceived by the production’s director, Robert Lepage — has been tamed, the technical troubles always struck me as distractions from the real problem. All of Mr. Lepage’s spending and innovation resulted in a cycle that was dull, and out of touch with Wagner’s intricately drawn characters and plot. The singers seemed genuinely undirected, lost in front of the set’s imposing mass; the production team was scrambling to make the effects work, but it appeared that relatively little attention had been given to the acting. There were no discernible relationships charted onstage, no drama, no attempt to transmit — let alone interpret for our time — complex themes of power, sacrifice and societal collapse. Indeed, though the set design meant that some singers spent long stretches in a kind of trough, the effects, while wonky, may have been the best part. At the beginning of “Das Rheingold,” bathed in blue light, the 20 enormous planks levitated in silence. Wagner’s long, low E flat began. Then, like the music, the machine began undulating — first slowly, then faster. It truly was the river Rhine. The opening storm of “Die Walküre” similarly came to life: We were in a sky full of dark, rushing clouds; then in the middle of a forest during a snowstorm; then inside a hut glowing with firelight. It was sweeping and evocative. A production crowded with visual stimulation, in which the singers seemed to be left to their own devices? This “Ring” reminded me, more than it probably intended to, of the Met’s hyper-realistic Franco Zeffirelli spectacles of the 1980s. Like Mr. Lepage, Mr. Zeffirelli creates grand spaces in which stick figures are moved around. The shows ignite when you have compelling performers and sink when you don’t. This revival — which Peter Gelb, the Met’s general manger, is mounting after many thought the Machine, last seen in 2013, would be mothballed for good — does indeed have some compelling casting. Christine Goerke, as Brünnhilde, promises more vocal confidence than Deborah Voigt had when the production was new; Greer Grimsley and Michael Volle will each make a capable, articulate Wotan; Philippe Jordan returns to the Met for the first time since 2007 to conduct. Things may well go more smoothly this time around. But will this yet be a Wagner we can believe in? ZACHARY WOOLFE ‘PRISONER OF THE STATE’ “How he mocked me,” a villainous official laments, explaining why he locked away the political prisoner he now wants killed. That chilling line rings out in “prisoner of the state,” the new David Lang opera that reimagines Beethoven’s only opera, “Fidelio”; the New York Philharmonic will give its premiere on June 6.Beethoven’s theme feels as resonant as ever in a country grappling with questions about mass incarceration; immigrants separated from their children at the border; whether the president is answerable to the law; and how inmates were quietly kept without heat or light for days in a federal jail in the middle of New York City. The opera, directed by Elkhanah Pulitzer, will serve as the finale of Jaap van Zweden’s first season as the Philharmonic’s music director, and he will conduct a cast that includes the moving bass-baritone Eric Owens. MICHAEL COOPER ECSTATIC MUSIC FESTIVAL Among its other skills, the Bang on a Can organization  is smart about fund-raising. By soliciting fans to help them commission new works, the collective ensures a reliably expanding repertory for its in-house chamber ensemble, the Bang on a Can All-Stars. The latest batch of these “People’s Commissioning Fund” pieces comes to the Ecstatic Music Festival at Merkin Concert Hall on March 6. Fresh music by Nicole Lizée and Pulitzer Prize-winner Henry Threadgill will share a bill with vintage works by Annie Gosfield and Glenn Branca, who died last year. The evening’s theme is music for dancing, which Mr. Threadgill has previously explored with his Society Situation Dance Band. If you can’t make it to the concert, you can tune in for a live webcast, on newsounds.org. SETH COLTER WALLS MITSUKO UCHIDA It’s easy to forget that the piano is a percussion instrument when it’s played by Mitsuko Uchida. She animates it with both symphonic might and enchanting lyricism — a perfect fit for the vast emotional range and singing melodies of Schubert. Ms. Uchida recorded one of the finest cycles of Schubert’ssonatas, and she has been revisiting portions, the late works, in a survey at Carnegie Hall. That comes to an end this spring, with two recitals on April 30 and May 4. Endings are very much part of both programs. They are almost stages of grief: The Sonata No. 20 in A (D. 959) contains an abruptly tumultuous passage, like a petulant tantrum, then the heart-rending Sonata No. 21 in B flat (D. 960) offers bittersweet acceptance. JOSHUA BARONE THE SHED The Shed has a modest name and enormous ambitions. Opening April 5, it’s the cultural component of the gigantic Hudson Yards development on the West Side of Manhattan: an eight-story structure that includes galleries; rehearsal space; a theater that can adapt to seated or standing-room events; and a shell that can enclose an adjacent plaza into a performance space. Its mandate is to commission and present world premieres of new and innovative works, and its artistic director and chief executive, Alex Poots, arrives after a decade as the artistic director of the Manchester International Festival in Britain and, in recent years, of the Park Avenue Armory in New York City. The Shed’s first full-scale offering celebrates the heritage and scope of African-American music. Over five nights from April 5-14, “Soundtrack of America” sets out to explore a “family tree” of American music, from spirituals to hip-hop, with a lineup of 25 young performers to bring out continuities and breakthroughs. “Soundtrack of America” arrives with unquestioned credentials. The series is conceived and directed by the filmmaker and video artist Steve McQueen, whose “12 Years a Slave” won the Oscar for best picture in 2014. His brain trust includes the illustrious producer Quincy Jones; the crate-digging hip-producer No I.D. (a.k.a. Dion Wilson); and the keyboardist Greg Phillinganes, who was Michael Jackson’s musical director and has worked with Stevie Wonder, Eric Clapton and Bruno Mars. The performers announced so far — five each night — include 2019 Grammy winners like Fantastic Negrito and PJ Morton; the genre-meshing New Orleans band Tank and the Bangas; Judith Hill, who sang backup for Prince and Michael Jackson, among many others; the rapper and singer Smino; the eerily idiosyncratic, falsetto-loving songwriters Moses Sumney and serpentwithfeet; and Jon Batiste, who leads the band Stay Human on “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.” The African-American musical family tree gives them a boundless source of potential material. The Shed has also announced another major musical production, May 6-June 1: a premiere from Björk, who introduced her “Biophilia” in 2011 at the Manchester International Festival. Björk describes it as “my most elaborate stage concert yet, where the acoustic and digital will shake hands”; her backup includes a seven-woman Icelandic flute ensemble. The title, promisingly, is “Cornucopia.” JON PARELES ROBYN A Robyn show is a bit different from other pop concerts. It isn’t an over-the-top spectacle of rotating set pieces and wardrobe changes, or a showcase of vocal acrobatics and choreographed backup dancers. It is sweaty and straight-up — pop church and pop group therapy, a place for fans of the Swedish singer and songwriter, who first hit the United States in the late 1990s, to experience Robyn’s transcendent, deeply addictive music beside her. From February to April, including a stop at Madison Square Garden in New York on March 8, she’s touring to support “Honey,” her first full album in eight years, which came after a half-decade of psychoanalysis and a series of personal challenges. Her loyal listeners have been anxiously waiting to share their euphoria and pain. CARYN GANZ MASSIVE ATTACK In 1998, the British trip-hop trio Massive Attack unleashed its third album, “Mezzanine,” a brooding, sensual, chilly, paranoid record of sputtering grooves and gauzy atmospherics that wound its way into popular culture everywhere, from “The Matrix” to the TV show “House.” The band has released two more albums in the 21 years since, but the gravitational pull of “Mezzanine” remains potent, and the group — now a duo consisting of Robert del Naja (known as 3D) and Grant Marshall (Daddy G) — is playing a series of shows marking its (belated) 20th anniversary. The brief tour, which hits Boston on March 14 and wraps in San Diego on April 2, promises to be an enveloping, dynamic visual extravaganza. CARYN GANZ BIG EARS FESTIVAL The Big Ears Festival in Knoxville, Tenn., has become a point of pilgrimage for all sorts of experimental listeners: Indie classical, avant-garde jazz, ambient electronic music and post-rock are all well accounted for here. The festival will celebrate its 10th anniversary, March 21-24, overtaking nearly a dozen spaces across the city’s downtown. All are within walking distance of each other, but each is comfortable and acoustically sound enough that you’ll forget what you’re missing a few doors down. This year’s acts range from the virtuoso vocalist Theo Bleckmann (paying tribute to Kate Bush) to the radical improvisers in the Art Ensemble of Chicago to the psychedelic, soulful explorations of the rock band Spiritualized. Big Ears 2019 doubles as a 50th-anniversary celebration of ECM Records; the influential label will present 20 performances throughout the festival, featuring artists from across its eclectic roster. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO MERCE CUNNINGHAM Merce Cunningham, that marvel of a choreographer, understood that dancing meant different things to different people. In the book “Merce Cunningham: Fifty Years,” he is quoted as saying: “What to some is splendid entertainment, to others is merely tedium and fidgets; what to some seems barren, to others is the very essence of the heroic.” His entire career was a heroic act of vision and persistence. One of the most revered and revolutionary choreographers of the 20th century, Cunningham was a rule breaker who collaborated deeply with many artists, including his life partner, the composer John Cage. Their experiments involved allowing music and dance to exist separately, as well as introducing the concept of chance as a creative device. In 2019, the year of his centennial, Cunningham — who died at 90 in 2009 — is being celebrated all over the world with performances, workshops, talks, screenings and more. “The ideas are still very much alive and relevant and exciting and creative,” Ken Tabachnick, the executive director of the Merce Cunningham Trust, said. “Every time I see something again, I’m just amazed at how relevant it is. It could have been made yesterday.” That is one of the important points that Mr. Tabachnick and Trevor Carlson — a trustee and the producer of the Trust’s celebration of the centennial — hope to impart with the multi-tentacled celebration. Events continue all year and are updated on the Trust’s website, but one highlight is just around the corner: “Night of 100 Solos: A Centennial Event,” on April 16, Cunningham’s birthday. Three cities — London (at the Barbican), New York (at the Brooklyn Academy of Music) and Los Angeles (at the Center for the Art of Performance at U.C.L.A.) — will stage Events, the name that Cunningham gave to performances that featured fragments of works from his repertory. (Events date to 1964.) “We’re looking to continue Merce’s tradition of doing things that hadn’t been done before,” Mr. Carlson said. “We wanted to make the largest Event ever made.” In the spirit of the new, none of the performers — including the New York City Ballet principal Sara Mearns, the Martha Graham dancer PeiJu Chien-Pott and the choreographers Kyle Abraham and Vicky Shick — are former Cunningham dancers. Those dancers are involved, however, in staging the solos. (Cunningham’s company, according to his wishes, disbanded after his death and a legacy tour.) “We wanted to signal that the Cunningham legacy has a future for people who never experienced Cunningham,” Mr. Tabachnick said. “So you’ll see ballet dancers, you’ll see dancers who are not classically or rigorously trained, you’ll see younger dancers and older dancers. And that is to show the diversity and breadth of the possibilities for the legacy.” Events are piling up, and include a Cunningham celebration at the Joyce Theater (April 17-21) featuring Compagnie CNDC-Angers/Robert Swinston, Ballet West and the Washington Ballet. Amid the excitement, Mr. Carlson has a problem. It’s a good one. “It’s wild, but I’m afraid we might have to expand the amount of time of the centennial in order to include everyone who wants to be included,” he said. “I think we’re going to see ourselves extending to what would have been Merce’s 101st birthday.” GIA KOURLAS DANCE THEATER OF HARLEM Dance Theater of Harlem has never been just another ballet troupe. It was created, in 1969, as a hopeful reaction to hope-crushing circumstances. The assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was among the spurs to action, but the principal problem in need of addressing was longstanding and continuing: the dearth of opportunities for ballet dancers who were not white. “You can’t do this,” these dancers were told by the world in many ways. Dance Theater of Harlem told them they could, and then proved it to the world. The survival of this institution for 50 years deserves a big celebration. With the death of its trailblazing founding director, Arthur Mitchell, in September, the anniversary festivities have also become memorials. In recent decades the company has valiantly struggled with diminished funds, and its New York season at City Center (April 10, 12-13) isn’t as grand as one might wish. Such signatures pieces as “Agon,” “Firebird” and “Creole Giselle” return only in excerpts. But it’s appropriate that one of Mr. Mitchell’s works (“Tones”) is being revived, and Robert Garland, the troupe’s underrecognized resident choreographer, is presenting a premiere. However these turn out, the occasion is major. BRIAN SEIBERT PAM TANOWITZ When Emma Portner, known for her video dances, withdrew from a New York City Ballet commission, the company turned to Pam Tanowitz. The circumstances are hardly ideal, but here’s a one-word reaction: Finally. Ms. Tanowitz, whose new ballet will be unveiled at the company’s spring gala on May 2, has been making dances since 1992. Celebrated for her ability to mix classical and contemporary vocabulary within a framework of formal structures, she will expand a piece set to Bartok’s String Quartet No. 5 that she created during a choreographic workshop at American Ballet Theater in 2017. It’s not the prolific Ms. Tanowitz’s only new dance this season: In April, she presents a work at the Martha Graham Dance Company; another commission, from Paul Taylor American Modern Dance, will have its premiere at the Orchestra of St. Luke’s Bach Festival in June, the same month she presents a new work for her company and the City Ballet dancers Sara Mearns and Taylor Stanley at the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council’s River to River Festival. And on March 22, she will land in Cleveland to stage a site-specific work at Pilgrim Congregational Church for her company along with local dancers. “Recital #1 (five small dances for Cleveland)” is an experiment: She’s looking at ways to reimagine her repertory. GIA KOURLAS LIGIA LEWIS Every so often, New Yorkers catch a glimpse of the choreographer Ligia Lewis, who spends much of her time in Berlin. Her brief visits, which in recent years have been high points of the American Realness festival, are not to be missed. Capping the refusal-themed “No Series” at Performance Space New York, Ms. Lewis will present “minor matter” and “Water Will (in Melody),” two parts of a triptych that began in 2014 with the spare and piercing “Sorrow Swag.” Each work in the trilogy corresponds to a color, teasing out its associations: blue, red and white. (“Sorrow Swag” featured a lone male performer enveloped in blue light.) First seen in New York at Abrons Arts Center, where three indefatigable dancers (Ms. Lewis included) seemed almost to topple the theater walls, “minor matter” (red) returns May 21-22. Exploring the space between love and rage — and the relationship between blackness and the black-box theater — it stages a kind of tangled collective struggle, in which the people onstage could be conspiring with or against one another, maybe both at once. The final part, “Water Will (in Melody),” May 28-29, flirts with melodrama and catastrophe, which sounds like a fitting end. SIOBHAN BURKE "
5c830aaf49f0eacbf105c292,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/obituaries/peter-hurford-dead.html,"Peter Hurford, a British organist, composer and choir director known for his incisive, buoyant recordings of Bach, died on March 3 in St. Albans, England, just north of London. He was 88. His death was announced by the St. Albans International Organ Festival, which he founded in 1963. Mr. Hurford made his name internationally by recording Bach’s complete organ works for Decca in the late 1970s and early ’80s. When the record industry was booming, such an encyclopedic endeavor was almost the norm for organists of stature. Many managed it once; a few, like Helmut Walcha, achieved it twice; Marie-Claire Alain somehow did it three times. But while other organists might have had a loftier vision for this music, none played it on record with quite the commitment to authenticity and the all-around good sense of Mr. Hurford. His playing was “characterized by brisk tempi, a strong sense of rhythm and highly articulated musical lines,” Thomas Trotter, the organist of the city of Birmingham and St. Margaret’s Church, Westminster Abbey, wrote in an email. “At the time it was a breath of fresh air, and a revelation to hear the music of Bach dance.” The New York Times music critic John Rockwell wrote in 1983, when the Bach cycle was completed, that while “Mr. Hurford is not the flashiest or most eccentric of players,” his Bach was “deeply, eminently satisfying.” Simplicity and clarity defined Mr. Hurford’s approach to the organ. And although he often played grander Romantic works, he saw the century or so between the birth of Buxtehude in 1637 and the death of Bach in 1750 as the pinnacle of his instrument. For a chapter on Bach in “Making Music on the Organ,” a handbook he published in 1988, Mr. Hurford took a verse from Keats that reflected his effective, straightforward approach: “Beauty is truth, truth beauty, — that is all/Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Peter John Hurford was born on Nov. 22, 1930, in Minehead, Somerset, England, the son of Hubert Hurford, a lawyer, and Gladys (James) Hurford. He trained under the composer and organist Harold Darke and became an organ scholar at Jesus College, Cambridge, where he studied music and law. After military service and further study with the French organist André Marchal, who inculcated in him a love of the Baroque, Mr. Hurford became organist at Holy Trinity Church, in Leamington Spa in central England. In 1958 he became organist and master of the music at St. Albans Cathedral, just north of London. Firmly rooted in the tradition of English church music, and a composer of organ and choral pieces himself, Mr. Hurford remained at St. Albans until 1978 and oversaw the installation of a new organ there by the English builder Harrison & Harrison. Andrew Davis, the music director of the Lyric Opera of Chicago and a boyhood student of Mr. Hurford’s, recalled his “incomparable music-making, boyish charm and infectious enthusiasm,” especially during the construction of the organ in St. Albans. “He was, every week, like a kid with a new toy,” Mr. Davis said in an email. “One day I remember ascending to the organ loft to find him grinning from ear to ear. ‘Go and stand by the Positive,’ he said, ‘the Crumhorn has arrived!’ ” Mr. Davis recounted, referring to a section of pipes and its new addition. “He played a chord on the new stop and almost blew my head off.” In addition to the Bach project, which Mr. Hurford reprised by performing the works for BBC radio, he made solo recordings for Decca of composers including César Franck, Felix Mendelssohn and Paul Hindemith. He also recorded Handel’s Organ Concertos with Joshua Rifkin and Saint-Saëns and Poulenc with Charles Dutoit. In the early 1980s Mr. Hurford was visiting artist in residence at the Sydney Opera House, where he oversaw the completion of the organ in its concert hall. He served as president of the Royal College of Organists from 1980 to 1982 and was made an officer of Order of the British Empire in 1984. In 1955 he married Patricia Matthews, who died in 2017. His survivors include a daughter, Heather; two sons, Michael and Richard; and nine grandchildren. Mr. Hurford performed the works of Bach in a series of 15 concerts at the Edinburgh Festival in 1997. In an interview, he was asked what made Bach’s music so powerful. “It’s his simultaneous mastery of technique and ability to convey what is deepest in his spirit in the music that he writes,” he replied. “The challenge is one of expressing this on an instrument which is arguably the most difficult to make music on — the organ.” "
5c9cb79e49f0eacbf105f82a,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/28/arts/music/wagner-ring-cycle-metropolitan-opera.html,"True to form, an autocratic executive wrapping up a real estate deal is trying to wiggle out of paying contractors. The project, a gleaming, fortified executive residence and business headquarters, is a veritable castle in the sky. His idea was to get all his subordinates — including his aggrieved wife, obsequious family members and a dirty trickster — under one roof so he can better control them as he continues enhancing his dominion and power. Sound familiar? Not so fast. It’s actually the gist of Wagner’s “Ring” cycle, which the Metropolitan Opera is presenting — in a retooled revival of Robert Lepage’s intensely-debated production of the four-opera epic — through May 11. Since the first complete “Ring” production inaugurated the Bayreuth Festival in Germany in 1876, Wagner’s saga has been milked for its perceived politics. Early audiences saw echoes of revolutionary currents that had swept 19th-century Europe. The work was soon seized upon to support various ideological agendas: a Marxist narrative of class struggle; an allegory of environmental degradation at the hands of rapacious industrialists; a multigenerational drama about a dysfunctional royal family. The “Ring” has also been viewed as a cautionary tale of a power-hungry ruler — or mogul — who goes too far. Modern stagings that present Wagner’s flawed hero, the god Wotan, as if he were the chief executive of the Valhalla Corporation have become almost commonplace. In this divisive moment in American politics, the “Ring” may feel newly relevant, epitomized by Michael Cohen, the former lawyer for President Trump, pointing to himself during recent congressional hearings, warning of what can happen when you are dazzled by power. For one, the “Ring” depicts a world that functions through a codified system of checks and balances and agreed-upon norms. Wotan, though the head god and patriarch, is not all-powerful. He must contend with a sort of cabinet of sub-gods with their own areas of authority. But he has stacked his regime with cronies and has brazenly flouted the standards and protocols meant to rein in executive overreach. It’s a crucial plot element, and not simply a costume accouterment, that Wotan carries with him at all times a staff that has the runes (the codes of his realm, like the articles of a constitution) carved into the wood — a symbol, and perhaps the source, of his power. Of course, this imperious ruler cites a particular rune when it serves him and simply ignores those that prove inconvenient. Another strand of the myth that may leap out today concerns the way the personal becomes the political in the life of a ruler like Wotan. The “Ring” has been interpreted as an allegory about the relationship between power and love, and the difficulty of obtaining both in one’s life. That’s the way I see it. It’s crucial that the secret to the magic gold the three Rhinemaidens keep safe in the depths of the river involves a choice, in effect, between power and love: Anyone who renounces love and takes the gold can fashion a ring from it and become master of the universe. Wotan craves both power and love, a tension that plays out poignantly in his relationship with Fricka, his exasperated (and childless) wife. But it’s Alberich the dwarf who acts first. There are eerie resonances, too, in how Wotan and Alberich, opposing characters, become obsessed with the ring. Alberich literally stumbles upon the magic gold when he makes advances at the Rhinemaidens, who find him laughably hideous. Rebuffed and humiliated, he steals the gold in an I’ll-show-you-all act of vengeance. But Wotan, who has heard of the gold and its power, was content to leave it be, until the moment when we meet him in “Das Rheingold.” Now he needs to pay his contractors. And beyond that, once he learns what Alberich has done, Wotan feels threatened. He must get his hands on that ring, on that power — whatever the cost to his governing legitimacy and personal life. You may also find one other theme uncomfortably familiar: heads of state near and far granting governing authority to family members. Having made a hash of things and violated the very codes he had sworn to uphold, Wotan must somehow make corrections. Knowing that his own hands are tied, he fathers children hoping that one of his descendants (perhaps the hero who has been prophesied) might take over his domain and, exercising free will, right his wrongs, while still maintaining power. But it doesn’t look good. His narcissistic greed and power grabs have caused havoc in the world. The ring (now in possession of the giant Fafner) is cursed; the natural order has been disrupted; the only hope of averting the inevitable global calamity (which brings to mind climate change) is for the ring to be returned to the river. Since Wotan also craves knowledge — knowledge is power, after all — he pursues Erda, the all-knowing earth goddess, who comes to warn him about what will ensue if he keeps on his heedless and destructive path. They end up having nine daughters together, and he raises the girls as Valkyrie warriors to do his bidding. But only Brünnhilde, his favorite, seems to know his mind. “Who am I if not your will?” she asks in an intimate moment when Wotan seems troubled. What follows is the rare confessional scene among numerous tales of fearsome, all-powerful fathers, when Wotan tells Brünnhilde the woeful story of how he has broken the covenants and mismanaged his life. This aspect of the “Ring” always reminds me of the scene in “The Godfather” in which the ailing Vito Corleone confides in Michael, his trusted son. “I never wanted this for you,” Vito says. He had hoped that, after lawlessly building an empire, by this point he would have given the family business a legitimate veneer and groomed an heir who could prevail within the establishment. Senator Corleone? Governor Corleone? “We’ll get there, Pop,” Michael replies. By the end of the “Ring” cycle, the immutable forces have won out, just as Erda foretold. The game is up and Wotan must face the inevitable. We learn that he has piled branches from the world tree around his crumbling castle, where he glumly awaits the end. Sure enough, as if doing her father’s bidding, Brünnhilde, who has been through hell, sparks a self-immolating fire that consumes the castle and its godly inhabitants. The cautionary moral seems clear: If you blaze a path to power, the flames may well consume you. The river floods the ashes and reclaims the ring. For better or worse, humans will have to go forward without the gods. The governing codes of conduct that were shattered will be restored. Or will they? That very question is roiling Washington as the “Ring” plays out at the Met. "
5c7043073a125f5075c0b101,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/22/arts/music/pretty-yende-la-fille-du-regiment-met-opera.html,"It is a brief, charming moment — and subtle enough that some audience members may miss it. But it speaks loudly as a symbol: the distinctive clicks of Zulu, the African language, echoing from the stage of the Metropolitan Opera. It comes during Donizetti’s comedy “La Fille du Régiment.” Pretty Yende, the bel canto soprano singing the title role — Marie, an orphan raised by an army regiment — ad-libs a brief spoken monologue as her character gives vent to overwhelming, conflicting emotions of love and frustration as she deals with laundry and peels potatoes. In this production, by the director Laurent Pelly, the moment has always been an opportunity for singers to depart from the French libretto in a rush of words and sounds, flights of verbiage that leave subtitles in the dust. When Ms. Yende, 33, made the part her own in the current revival, she decided to incorporate Zulu, which she grew up speaking in South Africa. As the broader field of classical music lags in diversity — and as opera companies have sometimes struggled to preserve what is great about works like “Aida,” “Otello,” “Madama Butterfly” and “Turandot” while jettisoning their outdated, often offensive portrayals of non-European cultures — it sends a powerful message. Ms. Yende, an international star who is on the cover of this month’s Opera News, spoke about how she came up with her Zulu moment for “Fille,” which will be broadcast live in cinemas worldwide on March 2. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation. Could tell me a little bit about how this came about? It started in one of the rehearsals, when I was doing the debut in Seville, Spain — instinctively, because it’s not scripted. I couldn’t find the vocabulary for what I truly wanted to say, that emotional part of Marie. And so I just started speaking Zulu. The whole room, they were like, “We weren’t expecting that!” I wasn’t expecting it, either, but somehow, emotionally, I went that route. I didn’t want to plan it, because it’s one part in the show where she doesn’t know what she’s saying. She’s in so many emotional states. She’s in love, and she’s afraid, and she wants everything. And so when I started doing it in Zulu, the director was then like: “That’s interesting. It actually works. Do you want to keep it?” I was like, “Sure!” What are you saying? It happens just after the man you love visits you at the regiment and is dragged off. Well it’s different every night. The rough translation is: “Oh, my goodness, I really wanted to kiss him more, but what can I do? I have to work, now he’s gone! O.K., fine, I have to do what I need to do. This doesn’t have to be here, it has to be here! So that I can work properly. And then, of course, what can one do? It’s the military: left, right, left, right!” But one thing that you probably heard was the clicks when I say “ingqondo,” which is “mind.” What does it feel like to be able to speak Zulu at the Met? It feels so wonderful because I never thought of having this kind of possibility to be able to literally have a piece of my true self onstage. We embody these characters, and we go through their emotional journeys. And we are somewhat restricted to their texts, and the music of course, and sometimes the production as well. But somehow this production has allowed me this incredible privilege to actually show literally that a part of me is in the music, too. Saying that this is Pretty, and she’s playing Marie. And these two human beings are meeting together to express a common human emotional state. Because I, too, when I am crushing on a boy, don’t have words sometimes. That happens; it’s a human experience, which is truly wonderful. When you were studying in Cape Town, were there Zulu operas that you sang?  No, unfortunately not. Composers have just recently started to really show interest in composing South African stories and operas. So who knows? Maybe next time at the Metropolitan Opera I wouldn’t have to improvise — it would actually be written down. It seems like the South African opera scene is growing, with singers like you and the bass-baritone Musa Ngqungwana and the soprano Golda Schultz, who is currently in the Met’s “Falstaff,” appearing around the world.  There’s incredible talent in my country, and if you think I’m the only one that can do what I do, it’s a big mistake. You’ll find 10, 20 people able to do that. The beauty is that each and every person, of course, they have their own unique gifts and the way they use it. But as far as talent is concerned, and opportunities — especially when it comes to black artists — it has really enhanced them and made them believe that they too can be able to express themselves this way. Because many others, before Mandela was released, were never given that opportunity. So we are just enjoying this time. And the operatic world has truly opened its doors for us. In a sense, I think that music, as we’re dealing with harmony, is teaching the world that truly there shouldn’t be barriers. We can live in harmony and express our humanness together, through the arts. "
5c54f7403a125f5075c07a93,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/01/arts/television/russian-doll-netflix-harry-nilsson-gotta-get-up.html,"Spoilers ahead for the first season of “Russian Doll.”  In the new Netflix series “Russian Doll,” Nadia (Natasha Lyonne), a cynical video game programmer with commitment issues, finds herself caught in a never-ending cycle of death and resurrection on the night of her 36th birthday party. No matter what Nadia does, she eventually dies and awakens in the same bathroom on that same night at that same party. And with almost every reset, the staccato piano chords of a nearly 50-year-old pop tune kick in. [Read our critic’s review of “Russian Doll.”] That song is “Gotta Get Up,” the opening track from the late singer-songwriter Harry Nilsson’s 1971 album “Nilsson Schmilsson,” and its bright, infectious instrumentation belies melancholy, wistful lyrics about growing older. “We used to carry on and drink and do the rock ’n’ roll,” he sings. “We never thought we’d get older/We never thought it’d grow cold.” Lyonne, who created “Russian Doll” with Amy Poehler and Leslye Headland, was struck by the “buoyant doomsday quality” of Nilsson’s famously troubled life, as chronicled in the 2010 documentary “Who Is Harry Nilsson (And Why Is Everybody Talkin’ About Him)?” (An alcoholic, Nilsson filed for bankruptcy toward the end of his life and died at 52, of heart failure, in 1994.) “There was always a kind of ending that was unpleasant,” Lyonne said this week, “that was percolating under the surface of his songs, even at their most upbeat and certainly at their darkest.” Lyonne also wanted to “touch something that was out of time, and a New York and East Village that was out of time” while simultaneously evoking the present; at one point they questioned whether the characters should even have cellphones, she said. The Brooklyn-born Nilsson — whose legacy didn’t endure to the extent one might have expected in his ’70s heyday, which was distinguished by songs like “Everybody’s Talkin’” and the respect of celebrated peers like John Lennon — was the “perfect marriage of all those ideas.” Early on, there were other contenders for Nadia’s reset song, including Lou Reed’s “Crazy Feeling,” the Stooges’s “No Fun” and Lil’ Kim’s “Not Tonight.” But though they may have fit the tone, the creative team kept coming back to “Gotta Get Up” — as Lyonne put it, the other artists “didn’t pack the guttural punch” of Nilsson. Obtaining the rights to the song was another matter. The plan to reuse it many times, à la “I Got You Babe” in “Groundhog Day,” the show’s most obvious antecedent, ate into most of the music budget. Nilsson’s estate also limited the production to a certain amount of uses. As editing progressed, uncertainty about the song’s availability hung over the show like a “daily albatross,” Lyonne said, and the creators pondered which songs they might be willing to give up in order to afford “Gotta Get Up.” Because “Gotta Get Up” had become the song — if there was a Plan B, neither Lyonne or Headland, who discussed the topic in a separate interview, recall what it was. Fortunately, approval finally arrived late in the editing process. In an email, Brienne Rose, the show’s music supervisor, did not specify the terms of the licensing deal, citing confidentiality. But she did note that the team was able “to find a balance between the maximum number of uses, and what the budget would allow.” The constraints contributed to the varying ways in which “Gotta Get Up” is employed for Nadia’s resets — in the second episode, she dies several times within a four-minute montage, while the song continues to loop underneath, uninterrupted. In the pivotal fifth episode, in which Nadia begins to question her own goodness and morality, the song doesn’t appear at all. “We were able to kind of straddle that line and put you in a particular head space as you were watching the rest of the loop,” Headland said. “It’s the kind of thing you probably don’t notice, but your brain did.” (For the record, the theme song for Alan, the show’s other oft reanimated character, played by Charlie Barnett, was Beethoven’s “Piano Concerto No. 4 In G Major.” For both Headland and Lyonne, the composer is inextricably linked with Stanley Kubrick’s “A Clockwork Orange” — Headland views Beethoven primarily through the lenses of “pent-up energy” and “violence,” she said, themes that are found throughout “Russian Doll.”) The reset song technique does “more heavy lifting than just marking where you are in time,” Headland said, noting a scene from Episode 4 where, in a departure from the other sequences, “Gotta Get Up” intrudes on Alan’s reset. “Russian Doll” is about being haunted, she added. “So that music — what happened with Nilsson in his own personal life, and all those things — it’s just so obvious to me that he’s one of the many ghosts that are in that story.” "
5c9c007549f0eacbf105f6b2,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/27/obituaries/ranking-roger-dead.html,"Ranking Roger, a vocalist for the popular British ska band the Beat in the late 1970s and early ’80s who carried on that group’s infectious sound in subsequent bands and solo projects, died on Tuesday in Birmingham, England. He was 56. An announcement on his current group’s website said he had received a cancer diagnosis last year. Ranking Roger, whose real name was Roger Charlery, was one of two frontmen for the Beat, along with Dave Wakeling. The group, which was known as the English Beat in the United States to avoid confusion with a California power-pop band of the same name, had a brief but influential run after its founding in 1978, expanding on the ska sound, a lively precursor to reggae that had first migrated to England from Jamaica in the 1960s. “Ska is their base,” The Boston Globe wrote of the Beat in 1981, “but it’s infused with satisfying pressure-cooker-like tension and cut with reggae, pop and soul elements.” Neil Strauss, looking back on the group’s heyday in a 1995 article in The New York Times, described the Beat’s sound as “Jamaican ska informed by punk rock.” Mr. Charlery, who was black, and Mr. Wakeling, who is white, complemented each other: Mr. Wakeling was a more traditional vocalist, while Mr. Charlery “toasted,” the Jamaican version of rapping. The Beat’s best-known songs include a jaunty 1979 cover of “The Tears of a Clown,” which had been a hit for Smokey Robinson and the Miracles, and “Mirror in the Bathroom,” their biggest hit, which reached No. 4 in Britain in 1980. Some of the Beat’s songs had a political edge, notably “Stand Down Margaret,” a critique of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and her Conservative Party policies. “I said I see no joy, I see only sorrow,” the two vocalists sang. “I see no chance of your bright new tomorrow. So stand down Margaret.” But in a 1988 interview with The Globe (Mrs. Thatcher was still prime minister, and would remain in office until 1990), Mr. Charlery expressed some disillusionment about the power of music. “I sang ‘Stand Down Margaret’ for five years and no one listened,” he said. “She got in, and she got in again, and she’ll probably get in again. It goes to show how blind people are. Basically, I don’t think people ever listen.” After the Beat broke up in 1983, Mr. Charlery and Mr. Wakeling formed a new group, General Public. It broke up three years later, but the two men got back together for some shows in 1995. “Goodbye, Rog,” Mr. Wakeling posted on Facebook. “Thanks for all the fabulous years and wonderful memories.” Mr. Charlery was born on Feb. 21, 1963, in Birmingham to Jean Baptiste and Anne Marie Charlery, who were from St. Lucia in the Caribbean. He grew up in Birmingham and nearby Stechford and attended Tile Cross Academy. “My parents expected me to go into a factory,” he told The Birmingham Mail in 2016, when he released a new album, “Bounce,” as the Beat Featuring Ranking Roger. “I didn’t see that. I wanted to be a mechanic or a carpenter if anything.” His parents were destined to be disappointed. “Mum, Anne Marie, cried when I was on ‘Top of the Pops,’ ” he said, referring to the British television show, “and I knew I had done something right.” The Beat was born in part out of frustration with the conservative turn in England’s politics. “To the English Beat,” Robert Palmer wrote in reviewing the group’s second album, “Wha’ppen?,” in The Times, “unemployment, ecology and the antinuclear movement are not separate issues; they are interrelated.” “Anyone who would like to understand more about the attitudes underlying Britain’s inner-city rioting,” he added, “would do well to start here.” Mr. Charlery’s survivors include his partner, Pauline; five children, Matthew, Leon, Reuben, Luci and Saffren; and four sisters. In later years Mr. Charlery recorded and performed on his own and with variously named groups, among them Special Beat. (Mr. Wakeling had his own Beat-related group.) His most recent album, “Public Confidential,” again as the Beat Featuring Ranking Roger, was released this year. Another incarnation, in 2007, was the New English Beat, which included Ranking Junior, his son. In an interview with The Bristol Post of England that year, Mr. Charlery spoke of why he thought his music seemed to have a cross-generational, cross-racial appeal. “When the Beat were originally going ’round,” he said, “our audiences were so mixed — black, white and Indian, young people and older heads. It was brilliant, and I think we have kind of achieved that today. It is a bit different, obviously, but it is a very friendly crowd and everyone walks out sweating and happy, and I tell myself that’s the most I could ask for.” "
5c3381353a125f5075c03311,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/07/arts/music/benjamin-appl-park-avenue-armory-schubert.html,"The Park Avenue Armory must really want you to know who Benjamin Appl is. Otherwise it wouldn’t have given such significant real estate — three concerts, three Schubert masterworks — to Mr. Appl, a 36-year-old baritone who, with these performances, is making his American recital debut. His concerts at the Armory’s intimate Board of Officers Room, which began with Schubert’s “Die Schöne Müllerin” on Sunday and continue with the composer’s “Schwanengesang” on Tuesday and “Winterreise” on Thursday, remind me of the pianist Igor Levit’s debut there in 2014. Mr. Levit made an entrance by daring to program Beethoven’s final sonatas; Mr. Appl has chosen some of the most well known, and revealing, works in the art-song repertory. And like Mr. Levit, who pulled off his American entree with confidence and preternatural maturity, Mr. Appl presented a masterly account of “Die Schöne Müllerin.” He had the exacting attention to text of an actor, the charisma of a seasoned storyteller and an agile voice that, while not fully formed, shows promise not only for this week’s remaining concerts, but also for what I hope to be more appearances here in the years ahead. Mr. Appl, born in Germany and based in London, comes much-hyped from Europe, as one of the last private students of the lieder master Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau and the recipient of emerging artist awards, as well as honors for his first album with Sony Classical, “Heimat,” in 2017. He performs with the pianist James Baillieu, who on Sunday maintained clarity and avoided the muddle that often comes with “Die Schöne Müllerin” when it is transposed lower for the baritone voice. (The piece is written for a tenor’s range.) With text by the poet Wilhelm Müller, Schubert’s song cycle — which has the dramatic breadth of theater, and a vast melodic language — tells the story of a sensitive young miller who falls in love with the beautiful miller maid of the title, but is consumed by jealousy and, lost in his dark thoughts, drowns himself in a brook. The youthful Mr. Appl, with wide eyes and animated dimples, looked every bit the part of Müller’s Romantic hero. Over the course of the 70-minute performance his face increasingly shined with sweat and his sculpted hair lost its shape, a serendipitous parallel with the miller’s descent into histrionics. Yet he wasn’t overly dramatic. For the most part, Mr. Appl gave a direct reading of the piece, restrained and sublime in the final “Des Baches Wiegenlied,” and rationing theatrical moments for maximum effect: the unbridled joy of “Mein!,” the breathless rage of “Der Jäger,” the disturbing turn toward madness of “Am Feierabend.” That song — “Am Feierabend,” in which the miller is upset that his crush said good night to everyone, not to him only — showcased Mr. Appl’s greatest talents as a performer, yet revealed where he still has room to grow. His voice’s warmth didn’t quiet carry to the top of his range, and one outburst verged on barking. But the way he navigated the song’s transformation, from disappointment to obsession, was so gripping and troublingly real, I heard people all around me exhale afterward, as if Mr. Appl had rendered them breathless.

5c796c0e49f0eacbf105ae74,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/01/arts/music/girls-of-the-golden-west-review-amsterdam.html,"AMSTERDAM — “Oh, this is a new opera?” a friend said as we made our way to the Dutch National Opera here for the European premiere of John Adams’s “Girls of the Golden West” on Thursday night. “I thought it was Puccini.” It’s an easy mistake: Mr. Adams’s opera, with a libretto by Peter Sellars, playfully nods to “La Fanciulla del West,” or “The Girl of the Golden West.” And, like Puccini’s treacly western, it takes place in the heart of the California Gold Rush. But the similarities end there. “Girls” is an outright rejection of the romantic West of Puccini, of the hubris of Manifest Destiny, of all the rosy myths you’ve heard about the Golden State. It is revisionist — or, rather, corrective — American history, a tale of men turning feral as they swarmed California like an invasive species. In many ways, it is also an opera about the present. “Girls,” which had its premiere at San Francisco Opera a year after President Trump was elected, depicts California circa 1850 as a true melting pot: not just forty-niners, but also Mexican aristocracy, Native Americans, former slaves and immigrants from China and South America. And when white men’s fortunes took a turn for the worse, you can guess who bore the brunt. Miners down on their luck force themselves on women, lynch for sport and spend one long, frightening Fourth of July hunting as many people of color as possible. These horrors aren’t imagined; Mr. Sellars assembled the libretto from historical texts, including journals, poems and folk song lyrics of the time. For anyone worried about today, this opera seems to say, don’t be surprised: America has always been this way. If only “Girls of the Golden West” lived up to its meaning to the American moment, or to the promise of its eminent creators. Its premiere, in 2017, received mixed reviews. I was torn, attracted to the score and singers — especially the soprano Julia Bullock and the mezzo-soprano J’Nai Bridges, two “Girls” of the title — but unable to get over a libretto that was sleepy, dramatically awkward and overly long. Clearly aware of the opera’s problems, Mr. Adams spent last summer revising the score before it traveled to the Dutch National Opera with the same production, cast and conductor, Grant Gershon, this week. (A third stop is planned for a future season of the Dallas Opera.) The first act got much-needed trims, and a new ending that links it to the opening of Act II. (Previously, the two acts felt as independent as a double bill.) Mr. Adams also cut the “Spider Dance,” an amusing diversion that should have an afterlife as a short orchestral work, like “The Chairman Dances” from his “Nixon in China.” In San Francisco, Act I ended quietly, almost unexpectedly. Now, a tense finale heightens the opera’s politics. The miners celebrate the hanging of a Native American while minorities huddle indoors for safety. It’s a powerful image: Of the opera’s seven principal singers, five are people of color. Yet the white men are the only ones with weapons. But don’t expect any more improvements to the libretto. It remains the opera’s glaring fault, a confusing assemblage of found text that keeps characters from truly interacting as dialogues become little more than simultaneous monologues. Mr. Sellars used a similar approach in his and Mr. Adams’s 2005 opera “Doctor Atomic”; it wasn’t entirely successful in that work, either, but it benefited from a streamlined story you won’t find in “Girls” until Act II. Mr. Sellars’s solution, with a slightly altered staging in this revival, is to put more bodies onstage, to have characters spend less time addressing the audience and more time interacting with one another. But by turning to naturalism, he undercuts his original, still-present concept of a California history pageant à la Brecht — especially because the Brechtian set design, by David Gropman, is nearly unchanged. Backstage workings are clearly visible; period costumes are juxtaposed with red Solo cups inside a bar with the appearance of a roadside dive somewhere in the Sierra Nevada. Close listeners may also hear some Brecht in Mr. Adams’s score, played with exactitude and enthusiasm by the Rotterdam Philharmonic. It has the propulsive momentum that runs through most of his music, and playful touches of Americana like galloping rhythms and expansive fifths. But, with an accordion and a delightful taste of the lowbrow, Mr. Adams also suggests Weill and Brecht’s “Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny,” a similar opera about money, rowdiness and savagery. Mr. Adams has written some of the most sophisticated and stirring choral music in modern opera; here, he most often saves it for new settings of old folk songs that take a chilling turn from boisterous to sinister. The Dutch National Opera chorus, which sang with unfortunate imprecision all night, may still be settling into these passages. (It’s not promising, though, that it was also limp and lazy in acting out Mr. Sellars’s staging and John Heginbotham’s choreography.) But elsewhere, this score brings out some of the most inspired performances you’ll find among its cast of young stars. The tenor Paul Appleby, smooth and tender in fare like Mozart, has immersed himself in the role of Joe Cannon with a Missouri twang and desperate fury. (Genuinely tender is the baritone Elliot Madore, as Ramón.) Ryan McKinny’s bass-baritone is terrifyingly masculine, and Hye Jung Lee, as the sympathetic prostitute Ah Sing, has an enchantingly delicate soprano voice capable of shocking power. The most bitter music of the evening is reserved for the bass-baritone Davóne Tines, as the doomed former slave Ned Peters. With a penetrating bite, he delivers the setting of text from Frederick Douglass’s “What to a Slave Is the Fourth of July?”: “The Fourth of July is yours not mine,” Mr. Tines sings before being walked offstage with a gun to his back. Ms. Bridges’s Josefa, a Mexican woman who receives a death sentence from a kangaroo court, is fiercely dignified, and entrancing in the lullaby “Ven esta noche amado, querido.” And it’s difficult to imagine anyone else in the role of Dame Shirley, an eloquent observer of Gold Rush life, other than Ms. Bullock, who sings — deftly somber, ardent, joyous — as if each note were written only for her. She even makes the opera’s long running time bearable with a sublime epilogue: her voice heavenly as she describes “the wonderful and never-enough-to-be-talked-about sky of California,” and Mr. Adams’s music eerily lustrous, like a precious metal worth killing for.

5c7719a049f0eacbf105a883,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/27/obituaries/mark-hollis-dies.html,"Mark Hollis, the frontman for the British band Talk Talk, which had synth-pop hits in the early 1980s before veering into a more experimental sound that influenced a generation of musicians, has died. Mr. Hollis, about whom personal details are scarce, was widely reported to have been 64. A Facebook page devoted to the group confirmed the death, citing Keith Aspden, Mr. Hollis’s former manager, but provided no further details. Talk Talk was formed in London in 1981, when new wave and synth-pop groups like A Flock of Seagulls and Duran Duran were beginning to receive heavy airplay. Talk Talk’s biggest hits, among them “It’s My Life” and “Such a Shame,” were typical of the style: buoyant songs built on catchy, danceable beats and Mr. Hollis’s plaintive lyrics. The band at first consisted of Mr. Hollis on vocals, guitar and piano, Lee Harris on drums, Paul Webb on bass and Simon Brenner on keyboards. Mr. Brenner left after the group released its first album, “The Party’s Over,” on EMI in 1982, and Tim Friese-Greene became the band’s producer and unofficial fourth member. Talk Talk toured with Duran Duran and broadened its American audience with videos on MTV. But its songs never quite attained the mainstream popularity of other synth-pop groups. “It’s My Life,” the group’s highest-charting single in America, peaked at No. 31 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1984. The success of the album, also titled “It’s My Life,” that featured that song gave Talk Talk free rein to experiment. On its next albums, “The Colour of Spring” (1986) and “Spirit of Eden” (1988), the band drifted away from synth-pop into music that defied easy description. The languid songs on “Spirit of Eden” included elements of free jazz, blues, contemporary classical, industrial and ambient music as well as rock, with Mr. Hollis’s quavering vocals floating over it all. Later critics hailed the album as a precursor of post-rock, which became widespread in the 1990s. In a  video interview, Mr. Hollis said of “Spirit of Eden”: “Everyone who comes and plays on this album is given absolute freedom, has no direction at all in what they play.” He added, “And then you assemble an arrangement from that so you end up with something which is very tightly constrained.” The new sound was groundbreaking, and some critics were enthusiastic about it, but it was far from the marketable pop that EMI wanted, and the label eventually dropped the band. Talk Talk released another album, “Laughing Stock” (1991), on Polydor, then disbanded. Mr. Hollis largely receded from view after that. His last album was “Mark Hollis” (1998), an intimate, mostly acoustic offering that ended with nearly two minutes of silence. Nigel Reeve, a record executive and friend of Mr. Hollis’s, told The Guardian in 2012 that Mr. Hollis had no regrets about walking away from his rock star life. “In all the conversations I have with him, he says: ‘I did it. Full stop.’ He got to where he wanted to go,” Mr. Reeve said. Talk Talk’s influence outlasted the band: Aspects of its sound are echoed in music by groups like Radiohead and Sigur Rós. No Doubt reached No. 5 on the Billboard chart in 2004 with a cover of “It’s My Life,” and Sean Carey of the popular indie group Bon Iver described Mr. Hollis as “a hero of ours.” Mr. Hollis said little about his past, but the music website Pitchfork and other outlets reported that he was born in London in 1955. No information about his survivors was available. By most accounts he studied to become a child psychologist, then worked as a laboratory technician. His brother Ed, a disc jockey who managed punk groups, helped Mark get the attention of record labels after Mark formed a short-lived band called the Reaction in the 1970s. The group broke up when Mr. Hollis met the musicians who would join him as Talk Talk. "
5ca1045549f0eacbf1f7afea,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/31/world/europe/italian-minister-pans-hit-song-by-an-immigrants-son.html,"MILAN — Alessandro Mahmoud recently won a prestigious Italian song contest with his Italian-language rap tune “Money,” tinged with a Middle Eastern flavor. The lyrics recall how his Egyptian father “drank champagne during Ramadan” or beckoned him home from the playground with calls of “waladi habibi ta’aleena” — Arabic for “My son, my love, come here.” But it turns out that Italy’s interior minister, Matteo Salvini, was not a fan of the song. “#Mahmood............... meh............ The most beautiful Italian song?!?” Mr. Salvini wrote on Twitter following the result last month. Soon after, a member of his anti-immigrant League party proposed a law to limit foreign songs on the radio. Since then, Mr. Mahmoud, whose stage name is Mahmood, has been thrust into the center of a national debate about what it means to be Italian at a time when critics say the country’s most powerful politician seems intent on stoking racism and xenophobia — not only against new migrants but also legal immigrants who have lived in Italy for years. To that, Mr. Mahmoud, a 26-year-old of Sardinian and Egyptian ancestry, has an easy answer. “I’m super Italian, 100 percent,” said Mr. Mahmoud, who, in further proof of his nationality, still lives at home with his mother. Enter the venerable Italian pop song, timeless to its fans and stuck in time to its detractors. But music experts say it is ever-changing and has always been influenced by foreign styles. “Now we have to understand what is Italian music,’’ Mr. Mahmoud, dressed in a red corduroy jacket, floral shirt and wide-legged pants, said as he sat in a cafe on a recent day. ‘‘It can’t always be the same. Life moves on. Italian music needs new points of view.” He seemed unbothered by the criticism swirling around his victory and showed a text message that Mr. Salvini, an ever-astute politician, had written to him after the controversy exploded. “Ciao, Matteo Salvini here, notwithstanding the musical tastes — I prefer the other guy — enjoy the success. Here’s my number,” it read. Mr. Mahmoud wrote back that he was “sure there wasn’t anything personal.” But in retrospect, he said of Mr. Salvini’s tweet, “obviously there was something underneath it.” The minister “provoked ignorant comments,” Mr. Mahmoud said, such as people questioning how an Egyptian could win the Sanremo Italian Song contest, a cherished national institution. Mr. Mahmoud was born and raised in a neighborhood outside Milan to a Sardinian mother who met his Egyptian father in one of the coffee bars where she worked. As a young boy, he said he listened to Arabic music with his father until his father left when he was five. “And you can tell those melodies stayed in my head,” he said. He attended elementary school in Milan with Russians, Chinese and kids of many other nationalities. He had his Catholic communion and confirmation, took piano lessons, and listened to Italian singer-songwriters Lucio Dalla and Paolo Conte. He was steeped in the soft piano intros and top-of-the-lungs crescendos of the contemporary Italian melodic tradition. As he grew older, he became more influenced by Italian rap and American R&B stars like Frank Ocean, who challenged stereotypes when he came out as gay. Mr. Mahmoud said he has an aversion to being categorized, when it came to his nationality or sexuality. “I don’t feel part of that Italy that judges,” he said. He walked down the block to rehearse his winning song in a nearby studio with some fellow Italian rappers, who were less forgiving of Mr. Salvini’s tweet. “It’s so explicitly racist,” said Fabio Rizzo, a 39-year-old Sicilian rapper known as Marracash who has played on his being mistaken for a Moroccan by riding camels in a music video. “It’s incredible, no? Not even the hypocrisy to hide it.” The Milanese rapper Cosimo Fini, 38, whose stage name is Gué Pequeno, added of Mr. Salvini, “Unfortunately, for me he is expressing the thought of many Italians. Xenophobia, racism.” Mr. Salvini argues that his political enemies discredit themselves by tagging him as a racist or Fascist for everything he says or does, including his preference for one singer over another. But after he voiced his frustration with the result of the song contest, in which a special jury overturned the vote of the home audience, a lawmaker in his League party, Alessandro Morelli, proposed legislation requiring that at least a third of songs on the radio had to be Italian. Mr. Morelli is the former president of Radio Padania, the in-house League station where Mr. Salvini cut his teeth as a DJ. “If we exclude American music, Italian music is the one that has conquered five continents,” Mr. Morelli said nostalgically. The League proposal had the support of some of the mainstays of an Italian music scene that often seems cryogenically stuck in another century. “In Italy, we have about 80 percent foreign music and maybe 20 percent of Italian music,” said Albano Carrisi, better known as Al Bano, whose love life, including his onetime marriage to the daughter of Tyrone Power, has been a staple of Italian variety shows for a half-century. (Statistics showed nearly half the songs on the radio were Italian.) Mr. Carrisi attributed the longevity of Italian singers like himself on Italian television to the advanced age of the television audience. He put Mr. Mahmoud squarely in his category of Italian singers, but the rapper’s hit song was another matter. “It’s sung in Italian,” Mr. Carrisi said. “But Italian music is another thing. That’s not it.” Mr. Carrisi, who recently sang his 1967 hit with Mr. Salvini at the Interior Ministry, where the singer was promoting his wine company, said that Italian easy listening music was more melodic. The exemplar, he said, was the refrain of ‘‘Volare,’’ the winning song at Sanremo in 1958 — and was uncorrupted by the influence of American rap. Mr. Carrisi, who was blacklisted this month by Ukraine apparently in part for serenading Vladimir Putin in Moscow at a 100th anniversary celebration of the KGB, traced the roots of Italian easy listening back to Gregorian chants and Verdi. But some Italian music experts disagreed. Jacopo Tomatis, author of the new book, “The Cultural History of the Italian Song,” said there was a clear continuity between the songs popularized during Fascism and the postwar hits that Italians built their musical identity around. He pointed out a 1951 bulletin of the Italian state broadcaster that explained how Sanremo began as an effort to protect the Italian song against “the influence of African-American and Latin-American music.” The centrality of “Italianness” to the country’s music was ironic, he said, because “popular Italian music has always been an elaboration of foreign styles.” That foreignness is more explicitly celebrated by Italians such as Mr. Mahmoud and Ghali Amdouni, a rising Italian star of Tunisian ancestry, who is also from outside Milan. In his hit “Dear Italy,” he raps, “When they tell me to go home, I answer I’m already here.” Mr. Amdouni launched his new album at the local prison a few minutes from Mr. Mahmoud’s recording studio. For now though, the moment belonged to Mr. Mahmoud, who will represent Italy in next month’s Eurovision song contest. That same night, a circle of 7-year-old girls sang Mr. Mahmoud’s hit song as they waited in line at a local club. Mr. Mahmoud was there to chat with Milan’s mayor about reaching out to the city’s youth. “In the face of the Salvini’s words, I shrugged, and I thought let me use this opportunity to show a positive example,” the mayor, Giuseppe Sala, said backstage. On stage, the mayor showed a packed room Mr. Mahmoud’s elementary school class picture. Three children of Egyptian parents from the singer’s neighborhood shouted with joy when Mr. Mahmoud sang a couple bars of his song. “He’s such a good singer,” one of them, Habiba Ibrahim, 13, said. “And he’s so cool.” "

5c462b963a125f5075c058cf,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/21/obituaries/reggie-young-dead.html,"NASHVILLE — Reggie Young, a prolific studio guitarist who appeared on landmark recordings by Elvis Presley and many others and played a prominent role in shaping the sound of Southern popular music in the 1960s and ’70s, died on Thursday at his home in Leipers Fork, Tenn., just outside Nashville. He was 82. His wife, Jenny Young, said the cause was heart failure. Mr. Young played guitar on hundreds of hit recordings in a career that spanned more than six decades. Among his best-known credits are the Box Tops’ “The Letter” and Presley’s “Suspicious Minds,” both No. 1 pop singles in the late ’60s, and Neil Diamond’s 1969 Top 10 hit “Sweet Caroline.” Mr. Young also played the funky chicken-scratch guitar lick on “Skinny Legs and All,” the soul singer Joe Tex’s 1967 Top 10 pop hit. He contributed the reverberating fills and swells that punctuate James Carr’s timeless soul ballad “The Dark End of the Street,” also from 1967. And his bluesy riffing buttressed the sultry, throbbing groove on “Son of a Preacher Man,” a Top 10 single for the British pop singer Dusty Springfield in 1968. Mr. Young appeared on all these recordings, including those associated with Presley’s late-’60s return to the limelight, as a member of the Memphis Boys, the renowned house band for the producer Chips Moman’s American Sound Studio. Living and working in Memphis, where there had long been a fertile cross-pollinization between country music and the blues, was critical to the development of Mr. Young’s down-home style of playing, a muscular yet relaxed mix of rhythmic and melodic instincts. “In Memphis, it’s sort of in between Nashville and the Southern Delta down in Mississippi, so I’m kind of a cross between B. B. King and Chet Atkins,” Mr. Young said in an interview published on the website Soul and Jazz and Funk in 2017. “Most of the soul music back then was in Memphis,” he added. “That’s where I came from.” In addition to playing guitar, Mr. Young added the psychedelic accents of the electric sitar to a handful of influential recordings, among them the Box Tops’ “Cry Like a Baby” and B. J. Thomas’s “Hooked on a Feeling,” both of which reached the Top 10 in 1968. After American Sound Studio closed in 1972, Mr. Young moved to Nashville, where his soulful less-is-more approach graced hits like Dobie Gray’s “Drift Away,” Waylon Jennings’s “Luckenbach, Texas” and Willie Nelson’s “Always on My Mind.” Mr. Young’s Nashville session credits also include Billy Swan’s “I Can Help,” which topped both the country and pop charts in 1974. Mr. Young made an indelible contribution, especially during his years in Memphis, to the Southernization of pop music in the 1960s and early ’70s. This influence was felt not just by the number of records made in the South that were played on AM radio throughout the nation. It was also evident in the procession of artists, among them Aretha Franklin, Paul Simon and the jazz flutist Herbie Mann, who came from outside the region to make records steeped in the Southern musical vernacular. Reggie Grimes Young was born on Dec. 12, 1936, in Caruthersville, Mo., and was raised in Osceola, Ark., and later in Memphis. His father, Reggie, was an accountant who played Hawaiian-style classical guitar and taught his son to play when he was 14. His mother, Thelma (Mayes) Young, was a homemaker. In 1956 Mr. Young joined Eddie Bond and the Stompers, a rockabilly band that had a regional hit with a record called “Rockin’ Daddy” and opened shows for Johnny Cash, Roy Orbison and Carl Perkins. Three years later he joined Bill Black’s Combo, an instrumental quintet led by Presley’s former bass player. He played on two No. 1 R&B singles with the group, “Smokie” and “White Silver Sands,” before joining the Army in 1960, and rejoined after his return to civilian life in the early ’60s. He arrived just in time to travel with Bill Black’s Combo when it opened for the Beatles on their 1964 tour of the United States. During that tour, Mr. Young had the opportunity to introduce George Harrison to the finer points of his Southern style of playing. “George asked me, because I’m a blues player, ‘How do you bend and stretch your strings like that?’ ” Mr. Young recalled in the Soul and Jazz and Funk interview. “I told him, ‘You have to have light-gauge strings,’ and after that I think he went to lighter gauge strings on his guitar.” A compilation album of 24 tracks from sessions on which Mr. Young played, including recordings by Merle Haggard, Jackie DeShannon and Bobby (Blue) Bland, is to be released by the English label Ace Records this week. In addition to his wife, Mr. Young is survived by a son, Reggie III; a daughter, Cindy Evans; a sister, Alice Weatley; five grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren. Mr. Young played with so many luminaries over the course of his career that he said “it was nothing special” for him and his fellow Memphis Boys to be tapped to support Elvis Presley in the studio in the late ’60s. “We played with all the top stars of the time, and Elvis hadn’t had any hits for a while and didn’t have an album on the charts,” he said in a 2013 interview with Premier Guitar magazine. “As he stepped into the studio though — boy,” he continued. “I never met any other person with such charisma. It was very special for me.” "
5c40868d3a125f5075c04e8f,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/arts/music/stradivarius-sound-bank-recording-cremona.html,"CREMONA, Italy — Florencia Rastelli was mortified. As an expert barista, she had never spilled a single cup of coffee, she said. But last Monday, as she wiped the counter at Chiave di Bacco, the cafe where she works, she knocked over a glass and it shattered loudly on the floor. The customers all stood still, petrified, Ms. Rastelli recalled. “I was like: Of all days, this one,” she said. “Even a police officer popped in and asked me to keep it down. I was so embarrassed.” The people of Cremona are unusually sensitive to noise right now. The police have cordoned off streets in the usually bustling city center and traffic has been diverted. During a recent news conference, the city’s mayor, Gianluca Galimberti, implored Cremona’s citizens to avoid any sudden and unnecessary sounds. Cremona is home to the workshops of some of the world’s finest instrument makers, including Antonio Stradivari, who in the 17th and 18th centuries produced some of the finest violins and cellos ever made. The city is getting behind an ambitious project to digitally record the sounds of the Stradivarius instruments for posterity, as well as others by Amati and Guarneri del Gesù, two other famous Cremona craftsmen. And that means being quiet. A Stradivarius violin, viola or cello represents the pinnacle of sound engineering, and nobody has been able to replicate their unique tones. Fausto Cacciatori, the curator of Cremona’s Museo del Violino, a museum devoted to musical instruments that is assisting with the project, said that each Stradivarius had “its own personality.” But, he added, their distinctive sounds “will inevitably change,” and could even be lost within just a few decades. “It’s part of their life cycle,” Mr. Cacciatori said. “We preserve and restore them, but after they reach a certain age, they become too fragile to be played and they ‘go to sleep,’ so to speak.” So that future generations won’t miss out on hearing the instruments, three sound engineers are producing the “Stradivarius Sound Bank” — a database storing all the possible tones that four instruments selected from the Museo del Violino’s collection can produce. One of the engineers, Mattia Bersani, said that the sounds in the database could be manipulated with software to produce new recordings when the tone of the original instruments degraded. Musicians of the future would be able to “record a sonata with an instrument that will no longer function,” he said. “This will allow my grandchildren to hear what a Strad sounded like,” said Leonardo Tedeschi, a former D.J. who came up with the idea for the project. “We are making immortal the finest instrument ever crafted.” Throughout January, four musicians playing two violins, a viola and a cello will work through hundreds of scales and arpeggios, using different techniques with their bows, or plucking the strings. Thirty-two ultrasensitive microphones set up in the museum’s auditorium will capture the sounds. “It’ll be physically and mentally challenging for them,” said Thomas Koritke, a sound engineer from Hamburg, Germany, who is leading the project. “They’ll have to play hundreds of thousands of individual notes and transitions for eight hours a day, six days a week, for more than a month.” Organizing the project had also taken a long time, Mr. Koritke added. “It took us a few years to convince the museum to let us use 500-year-old stringed instruments,” he said. Then they had to find top musicians who knew the instruments inside out. Then the acoustics of the auditorium, which was designed around the sound of the instruments, had to be studied, as well. In 2017, the engineers thought their project was finally ready to get underway. But a soundcheck revealed a major flaw. “The streets around the auditorium are all made of cobblestone, an auditory nightmare,” Mr. Tedeschi said. The sound of a car engine, or a woman walking in high heels, produces vibrations that run underground and reverberate in the microphones, making the recording worthless, he explained. “It was either shutting down the entire area or having the project not seeing the light of day,” Mr. Tedeschi said. Luckily for the engineers, Cremona’s mayor is also the president of the Stradivarius Foundation, the municipal body that owns the Museo del Violino. He allowed the streets around the museum to be closed for five weeks, and appealed to people in the city to keep it down. “We are the only city in the world that preserves both the instruments and their voices,” Mr. Galimberti said. “This is an extraordinary project that looks at the future, and I’m sure people from Cremona will understand that closing the area was inevitable.” On Jan. 7, the police cordoned off the streets. The auditorium’s ventilation and elevators were turned off. Every light bulb in the concert hall was unscrewed to eliminate a faint buzzing sound. Upstairs in the museum, Mr. Cacciatori put on a pair of velvet gloves and took a 1615 Amati viola from its glass display case. He inspected it thoroughly, and then a security guard escorted him and the instrument down two flight of stairs to the auditorium. The curator handed the instrument to Wim Janssen, a Dutch viola player, who walked to the center of the stage. He sat on a chair in the semidarkness under a cluster of microphones. The three engineers left the hall, and took their seats in a soundproofed room beneath the hall filled with speakers and computer screens, servers and cables. Mr. Janssen wore an earpiece, through which Mr. Koritke relayed instructions. “Go,” Mr. Koritke whispered. The violist played a C-major scale as the recording team watched graphs on their screens responding to the crisp sound of the instrument. Mr. Tedeschi grinned in satisfaction. Then it happened, and they froze. “Stop for a moment, please,” Mr. Koritke said, and the violist held his position. The engineers rewound the recording, and played it again. Mr. Koritke heard the problem, loud and clear: “Who dropped a glass on the floor?” "
5c9a69b749f0eacbf105f264,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/26/arts/music/met-opera-die-walkure-review.html,"A listener sitting through the whole of the “Ring” — Wagner’s four-opera epos about the birth and destruction of a civilization — has to wait two and a half hours for the first relatable human interaction. That’s the running time of “Das Rheingold,” the prelude peopled with gods, dwarves and giants fighting over the gold that will cast its curse over the story. Then, at the beginning of “Die Walküre,” which returned to the Metropolitan Opera on Monday night and will be screened in cinemas worldwide on Saturday, we see a gesture that feels personal and true. A stranger seeking refuge asks the lady of the house for a drink of water. As she gives it to him, their hands touch. He drinks, and the music surges: Something other than thirst needs quenching. They are twins — Sieglinde, bittersweetly sung by the soprano Eva-Maria Westbroek, and Siegmund, the leonine tenor Stuart Skelton — separated in childhood. It is their combustible, transgressive love, sparked over that first sip of water, that plants the seeds for the end of a world built on rules, power and greed. Mr. Skelton and Ms. Westbroek were bright stars in a cast led by the blazing soprano Christine Goerke as Brünnhilde. The conductor Philippe Jordan presided over the orchestra, where he whipped up voluptuously sulfurous playing from the Met players. Casting the “Ring” is a task almost as herculean as singing it, and the Met can feel smug about much of the talent it has assembled for this revival. In Ms. Goerke, the house has found a Brünnhilde who marries vocal vitality and emotional presence in each radiant note. She takes on the physically grueling task with ninja-like focus and suppleness. [Ms. Goerke survived a vocal crisis before becoming an acclaimed Brünnhilde.] But “Die Walküre” demands a production that magnifies the work’s psychological nuances and eminently human conflicts. This isn’t it. Robert Lepage’s high-tech staging tickles the palate of the Instagram age with an expensive gadget made out of rotating planks that configure themselves into sculptural backdrops and surfaces for video wizardry. As a set, this behemoth is stiff, clunky and dangerous. Whenever singers are made to scramble atop its wobbly planks — mindful, perhaps, of the stumble Deborah Voigt took as Brünnhilde in 2011 — their movements are stiff, clunky and self-conscious. And when singers don’t arrive with a fully formed idea of their characters, or the vocal resources to fill them, the machine’s smooth planes coldly project their hesitancy into the auditorium. That happened on Monday in Greer Grimsley’s Wotan, who came across as detached and bitter. For much of the opera, the god Wotan stews in a marinade of anger, shame and impotence, torn between the implacable laws that shore up his rule and his yearning for an act of free will — like the shocking sibling love of Siegmund and Sieglinde — that could tear down his own power construct. In a long monologue, he sings of his conflicting desires and of the gnawing curse placed on the ring. The orchestra acts like a CT scan of his brain: Reflecting his subconscious thoughts with telltale leitmotifs, the musical tags denoting emotions, events and people. But at the most chilling moment, the music shuts off completely, leaving the singer to stare into a gaping black silence. That abyss is framed by Wotan twice crying “Das Ende!” (“The end!”), once with desperate power, the second time quietly. Mr. Grimsley’s outcry lacked nihilistic conviction, and his unsteady echoing answer felt neither cleansed nor changed. By contrast, Ms. Goerke’s Brünnhilde, who has observed her father’s despair, responded with singing of fingertip delicacy, a precise and private sound that clearly marked the awakening of compassion as her character’s destiny. But Ms. Goerke was also capable of zinging fortes in her “Hojotoho!” war cries that Wagner sets to something like a proto-ambulance siren. Jamie Barton’s portrayal of Fricka, Wotan’s wife, was also brilliantly purposeful and vocally commanding. Her flamboyant mezzo-soprano, with its inky depths and flickering hues, rendered the character as guardian of legal integrity. But, in the surprisingly tender tone in which she passes the responsibility on to Brünnhilde, she hinted at a deeper sense of not only the futility, but also the undesirability of being proved right. Personifying that undesirability is Hunding, Sieglinde’s cuckold husband, who has every right to demand revenge no matter how unsympathetic he may be. The bass Günther Groissböck sang the role with crisp intention and lethal bite. He was a fine foil for the pair of incestuous lovers whose passion simmers and flickers even in his stern presence. Ms. Westbroek’s singing mirrored the gradual abandonment of domestic and moral constraints, chiseled and dark-limned at first while still under her husband’s roof, then more florid, voluble and bright as Sieglinde gives in to passion. Mr. Skelton’s Siegmund was heedless from the start — perhaps too much so, as he pushed his beefy tenor to supernatural extremes in the shouts of “Wälse! Wälse!” with which he invokes ancestral protection. His tenor sometimes sounded frayed in subsequent phrases. But it was the sort of come-hell-or-high-water commitment that Wagner’s brilliant and megalomaniacal creation demands. "
5c4a1c343a125f5075c0628e,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/24/arts/music/chris-brown-rape-complaint.html,"The R&B singer Chris Brown filed a false accusation complaint in Paris on Thursday against a woman who accused him of rape last week. On Tuesday, Mr. Brown was released without charge following questioning by the Paris police over an allegation that he raped a woman at a hotel in the city. The one-page complaint, submitted by Raphael Chiche, Mr. Brown’s lawyer, asks the Paris Public Prosecutor’s office to investigate the claim as a criminal matter. The charge carries a penalty of five years in prison and a fine of around $50,000. Mr. Chiche did not respond to a request for further comment. Mr. Brown, 29, was taken into custody on Monday and questioned about an accusation of aggravated rape. A woman filed the complaint with the Paris police on Jan. 18, accusing him of raping her at his hotel after they met at a nightclub. On Tuesday, after his release, Mr. Brown posted a picture on Instagram that said “This b!tch lyin’.” In the caption for the picture, Mr. Brown wrote in capital letters that he wanted to “make it perfectly clear” that “this is false.” “For my daughter and my family this is so disrespectful and is against my character and morals,” he wrote. The post is no longer available. On Wednesday night, Le Parisien, a daily newspaper, published an interview with Mr. Brown’s accuser. Le Parisien said she was 24 years old, originally from Algeria and was studying theater, but the newspaper did not reveal her name. The woman said that on the night of Jan. 15, she was about to leave a gathering in Mr. Brown’s room at the upscale Mandarin Oriental hotel when she went to the bathroom. There, Mr. Brown assaulted her, she said. She also said that she was later raped by one of Mr. Brown’s bodyguards, then a friend of the singer, too. “My life’s shattered,” the woman told Le Parisien. “If I filed a complaint, it’s not for the money,” she added. “If anything, I want justice. And to make sure the horror of what I went through does not happen to another girl.” Jean-Marc Descoubes, the woman’s lawyer, said in a telephone interview on Thursday that he had not seen Mr. Brown’s complaint. “My client maintains her accusations against Chris Brown and the others. She will be carrying on,” he said. Mr. Brown has been involved in a string of violent episodes over the past few years. In July, he was arrested in connection with a nightclub dispute from April 2017, when he was accused of punching a photographer in Tampa, Fla. In May, a woman sued him, saying he held her against her will at his Los Angeles house last year while a friend of his raped her. He was arrested in 2016 on a charge of assault with a deadly weapon after a standoff at his home. In 2009, Mr. Brown pleaded guilty to one count of felony assault on his girlfriend at the time, the singer Rihanna. Despite the legal troubles, Mr. Brown has remained a popular artist with an ardent fan base. He has won several industry prizes, including the 2012 Grammy for best R&B album for “F.A.M.E.,” and he performed at that year’s Grammy ceremony. His most recent album, “Heartbreak on a Full Moon,” opened at No. 3 on the Billboard album chart in late 2017. "
5c4303333a125f5075c0545b,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/19/style/emo-metal-rock-music-nigeria.html,"the look Rock music fans have emerged from the digital underground in Nigeria. Photographs by Jan Hoek and Stephen Tayo Text by Edwin Okolo Produced by Eve Lyons LAGOS, Nigeria — Rock music is often produced and enjoyed under the pressure of social constraints, and the restrictive culture of post-dictatorial Nigeria made for a perfect cooker. In the 1990s and 2000s, teenagers who rejected the country’s politics of restraint in dress, physical appearance and behavior embraced American punk and metal imports.  Footage of Western concertgoers dancing in defiance of any discernible rhythm, alone in a throng of bodies, moving with careless abandon to music, presented a possible escape. Many of these young Nigerians first encountered bands beloved by early 2000s emo kids — Linkin Park, Evanescence, Paramore, Fall Out Boy — online and, through the exchange of music, formed a digital community. They called themselves “Gothics,” shorthand for a composite of binding beliefs and aesthetics from different rock subgenres, including dark clothing, severe makeup and an obsession with death. “The scene’s true beginnings are the MySpace groups from the early 2000s,” said Cheyi Okoaye, 30, who runs the music website Audio Inferno. “MySpace used to let you create and save these playlists, and many of us would sleep over in cyber cafes just to discover new bands.” In the last decade, Nigeria’s Gothics have taken their act offline. Each year they congregate at Rocktoberfest, the only festival in Nigeria dedicated to rock and alternative music. It has become a crucial meeting place for members of the country’s underground rock community. “I’m grounded,” said Kaego Odiah, a 19-year-old student at the University of Lagos who had come to Freedom Park in Lagos for the festival. “I snuck out of the house because I had to be here.” Rocktoberfest presents a rare opportunity for fans to dress un-self-consciously in their gothic uniform of funereal black. At the smaller but more frequent sing-off parties held in karaoke bars around the city, for example, many Gothics come straight from their day jobs, still in dress shirts and ties, and try to avoid meeting anyone they know from their lives outside the community. “We want to take rock music mainstream. That’s why we have the festival,” said Lekan Dada, 30, the co-founder of RockNation Nigeria, which produces the festival and promotes rock bands. “Radio stations are reluctant to play rock music. Nigerian cable stations dedicate one hour a week to rock. If we are going to make this mainstream, we need to create our own ecosystem.” Music has long underpinned Nigerian oral histories, worship songs, state ceremonies and other speech acts. But these traditional songs encourage the expression of joy and hope, and rarely fear, doubt or despair. In rock music, young Nigerians found their range of emotions reflected: Anger, loneliness, grief and insecurity could exist alongside rapture. Some Nigerians have made spreading the gospel of rock music their life’s work. The influx of American rock inspired Nigerian bands with similar sounds, including the Isomers, an alternative rock band reminiscent of Kings of Leon; 1 Last Autograph, whose metalcore sound harks back to Avenged Sevenfold; and Mimido, whose music has Christian rock influences.  Mr. Okoaye’s website Audio Inferno publishes music reviews and interviews of rock bands across Africa. And through RockNation Nigeria, Mr. Dada creates spaces for fans to congregate offline. Meeting up in person has helped Gothics assimilate without diluting their dark style. Henry Uche, who calls himself a vampire and prefers the name GothicHenri, dresses in all black and ties his looks together with chains, studs and a pentagram necklace. He believes that by incorporating a few gothic visual elements into outfits, he and his fellow fans are better able to telegraph a shared love of rock. “In the future, I can see festivals where people who identify with the different subcultures can connect while listening to good music, especially because our country isn’t alternative-friendly,” he said. While the crowds at Nigerian rock shows are mostly female, few women have become community leaders. The alternative singer Bianca Adanna Okorocha, 29, who performs as Clay, is one exception. She considers her perseverance an achievement. “I’m still here when most of the people I got into the scene with have fallen away to assimilate into ‘real life,’” she said. But more notable is her ability to fuse rock music with Afropop, the predominant contemporary sound in Lagos, and the success she has had in doing so. When Ms. Okorocha performs, she is magnetic, coaxing the bodies in her thrall to give in to their baser selves.

As the night neared its end, some wiped their faces clean of face paint, stuffed their torn tees and jewelry into backpacks and handbags, and headed home. The gothic purists, on the other hand, scattered and swarmed karaoke bars to scream along to death metal and throw back drinks, without a care for how they may appear to onlookers. “I don’t know exactly what it means to be goth,” Yasmin Mbadiwe, 23, said. “Only that other people say I am.” Jan Hoek is an artist and writer in Amsterdam.

At least that’s the lesson you might take from “Stomp,” the durable New York-based stage show that has become a long-running institution in a city where sticking power can be hard to come by. About to celebrate the 25th anniversary of its New York premiere, “Stomp” has endured, not thanks to high-priced sets and effects, but from wielding everyday objects like brooms, garbage cans and wooden poles to create a wordless percussive explosion onstage. And let’s not forget the 150 or so performers who have smacked their way in and out of its cast. (On March 3, some alumni will join the current cast in the two performances, followed by a private party.) “Stomp” is the brainchild of Luke Cresswell, 55, and Steve McNicholas, 63, who still maintain creative control. (Blue Man Group, another downtown mainstay, was sold to Cirque du Soleil in 2017.) And while they have expressed interest in branching out — in 1997, Mr. McNicholas told the Times, “We’re kind of trapped, because we don’t feel we can walk away from it” — “Stomp” has come to define their lives. They started working together in the early 1980s, creating a one-off in their hometown Brighton, England, called “Romance Is Not Dead” that they performed on the day of the royal wedding of Charles and Diana as counterprogramming. Later, they busked on the streets outside the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in a band called Pookiesnackenburger. Mr. Cresswell described their early music in an interview as “very eclectic, punky, thrashy, scratchy,” and with “lots of running around.” The band eventually split up, but Mr. Cresswell and Mr. McNicholas formed a new troupe: an ensemble of eight performers that made its debut as “Stomp” at the festival in 1991. Mr. Cresswell had been the band’s percussionist; since he could only carry a few small drums, he began improvising on the street, which meant he would use surrounding objects as well. “We quickly learned how much the audience enjoyed that kind of experimentation,” Mr. McNicholas said. After three years of international touring, Mr. Cresswell and Mr. McNicholas brought the act to New York where it has never left the Orpheum Theater in the East Village. Along the way, “Stomp” launched several touring companies, appeared on late night television, filmed an HBO special and collaborated with A-listers. There have been bumps. In 2010, a national tour of “Pandemonium: The Lost and Found Orchestra,” another sound-centered show from Mr. Cresswell and Mr. McNicholas, was canceled after less than three weeks of performances. But “Stomp” itself has become part of pop culture and an unqualified success, which hasn’t fazed the founding duo. “We’re British and we live in England so we’re quite reserved,” said Mr. McNicholas. “We’re quite used to people telling us that we’re nothing special.” As the show celebrates a quarter century in New York, where a spokeswoman said it has grossed about $100 million, here are 10 things you might not know about “Stomp.” In the early 1980s, Pookiesnackenburger was a supporting act for Madness at the Dominion Theater in London. Yes, that Madness, as in the guys who earwormed “Our house in the middle of the street” into an entire generation of unsuspecting British teenagers. “They once described us as their favorite group,” Mr. McNicholas said. The connection has lasted. Mr. Cresswell and Mr. McNicholas helped orchestrate a theatrical launch show for Madness’s 2009 album, “The Liberty of Norton Folgate.” “Stomp” props might seem widely available. But Mr. Cresswell said that everyday objects, depending on where they’re made, make different sounds. He and Mr. McNicholas have the props shipped from Britain by boat. On one voyage in the late 1990s, a freak wave hit a boat carrying “Stomp” trash cans. The cargo box carrying the cans sank to the bottom of the North Sea. “Stomp” has used a total of 13,000 poles, 5,200 boxes of tissues, and 52,000 candles during its New York run. And for when the drummers have suffered injuries: 7,800 Ace bandages. In the late 1990s, George Lucas was looking to cast “Star Wars: Episode I — The Phantom Menace,” the highly anticipated prequel to the franchise. He had seen “Stomp” on the West Coast. “They were looking for someone really musical and with rhythm,” Mr. Cresswell recalled. Mr. Lucas and the casting director, Robin Gurland, invited several “Stomp” cast members to audition. Ahmed Best got the job — as Jar Jar Binks, who ended up being one of the most reviled characters in “Star Wars” history. In the original 1994 review, the critic Stephen Holden wrote: “One person who would probably have given ‘Stomp’ his stamp of approval is John Cage. Not only does the show demonstrate with an entrancing charm the music to be found in everyday objects, it does so at a relatively modest volume.” Cage, who died two years before “Stomp” debuted in New York, was the influential avant-garde composer who thrived on defying convention, and urged other artists to do the same. The “Stomp” creators have had plenty of celebrity collaborators, from Bette Midler (the roots of the show are clear in a pre-“Stomp” segment from her “Mondo Beyondo Show”) to the vaudevillian Bill Irwin (on “The Late Show With David Letterman” in 1997). The founders’ favorite appearance, they said, was with Paul Simon and Jimmy Fallon, performing the Simon and Garfunkel hit “Cecilia” on “Late Night With Jimmy Fallon” in 2011. Carlos Thomas, 42, is one of the longest running cast members, having made his debut 20 years ago. He was more prepared for his audition than most prospective performers, having grown up with a single mother who couldn’t afford to buy him instruments. “To practice rhythm, I would make drums out of pots and pans,” Mr. Thomas said in an interview. “In high school, I would be the guy who would take the desk, chair and chalk on the chalkboard and go ‘Chooka-chooka-chooka.’ I’d make music out of everything in the classroom.” In 2015, Daniela and Tom Isenschmid bought out an entire “Stomp” show in London so they could make the performance the main attraction at their wedding reception. “Stomp” auditions occur once every two or three years. They are essentially open calls. One time, a dancer brought her boyfriend to an audition in London. The boyfriend watched the workshop through a window. “We said, ‘Come in, come in.’ And he came in, and he was great,” Mr. Cresswell said. His girlfriend didn’t make the ensemble. Paul Bend did, and has been a “Stomp” cast member since 2001. The couple is no longer together. In 1999, Mr. Cresswell and Mr. McNicholas were planning to mark the millennium scuba diving off the Micronesian island Yap, until they received a call from the office of Hillary Clinton, who was first lady at the time. Mrs. Clinton requested that they perform on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial on New Year’s Eve. (Quincy Jones, a longtime supporter of the partners, helped make the connection.) “Stomp” dutifully did the show and skipped the scuba diving. “Then we partied at the White House till 4 in the morning,” Mr. Cresswell said. “It was fantastic.” “It was the best party I’ve ever been to,” Mr. McNicholas added.

5c7ef21149f0eacbf105b800,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/05/obituaries/joseph-flummerfelt-dead.html,"Joseph Flummerfelt, the pre-eminent American choral conductor of his generation and a collaborator with some of the nation’s most renowned orchestras and maestros, died on Friday in Indianapolis. He was 82. The cause was a stroke, according to the Spoleto Festival U.S.A. in Charleston, S.C., where he was the director of choral activities for 37 years until retiring in 2013. Mr. Flummerfelt played an outsize, if not always highly visible, role in American classical music. He prepared choruses for hundreds of concerts by the New York Philharmonic and a host of other famous orchestras and maestros, and he trained generations of singers and conductors at Westminster Choir College in Princeton N.J. He often readied choirs behind the scenes, then handed them off to more famous conductors, who would lead them onstage for the final rehearsals and performances. He was the de facto chorus master of the New York Philharmonic for decades, preparing nearly 600 choral performances with the orchestra from 1971 through 2016. And when other top orchestras and conductors — a pantheon that included Claudio Abbado, Leonard Bernstein, Pierre Boulez, Carlo Maria Giulini and Riccardo Muti — needed choruses for their requiems, masses and choral symphonies, they often turned to Mr. Flummerfelt. Along the way, he became the best-known American choral conductor since Robert Shaw, the great chorus-builder and conductor, who had been a friend and mentor. Mr. Flummerfelt conducted the Westminster Choir, the larger Westminster Symphonic Choir and the New York Choral Artists, which he founded in 1979. His choirs were featured on some 45 recordings, several of which won Grammy Awards, including one of Mahler’s Symphony No. 3, conducted by Bernstein, and another of John Adams’s “On the Transmigration of Souls,” a work commissioned after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, with Lorin Maazel conducting the Philharmonic. Mr. Flummerfelt played key roles as well at the Spoleto Festival U.S.A. and the Festival dei Due Mondi in Spoleto, Italy. He often spoke of a need for flexibility in performance — warning that trying to “machine-in every detail” could “straitjacket” performers and stifle creativity. “At a certain point, you have to let go and trust that the technical aspects will hold,” he told his friend and former student Donald Nally, who became an esteemed choral conductor and teacher himself, for Mr. Nally’s book “Conversations With Joseph Flummerfelt: Thoughts on Conducting, Music, and Musicians” (2010). “You need to just let it sing and, in a very real sense, to let the performance evolve organically and spontaneously.” Joseph Ross Flummerfelt was born on Feb. 24, 1937, in Vincennes, Ind., where his father, John Ross Flummerfelt, was a funeral director and his mother, Mavorette (McGinnis) Flummerfelt, was a piano teacher. When he was about 5, he recalled, he came home from hearing her play the organ at the First Baptist Church, sat down at the family piano and picked out the hymn “Stand Up for Jesus” by ear. He had found music. His family bought its first record player when he was 12, and it came with a free recording of Handel’s “Messiah,” stirring in him dreams of conducting. “I remember spending hours in front of our living room mirror conducting that recording,” Mr. Flummerfelt was quoted as saying in Mr. Nally’s book. “Having seen only our local church choir and high school band directors at work (remember, this was before television), I didn’t really know what I was doing; yet responding to the music with some sort of gesture seemed to come naturally.” After graduating from DePauw University in Indiana, where he studied organ and church music, he studied under a number of influential figures, including Nadia Boulanger. It was his mentor Shaw who first sounded him out about going to teach at Westminster Choir College. Mr. Flummerfelt became a sought-after teacher and conductor at the college for 33 years. One of his summer students was a teenage Yannick Nézet-Séguin, who went on to become the music director of the Metropolitan Opera and the Philadelphia Orchestra. In 2009 Mr. Nézet-Séguin told The New York Times that his sessions with Mr. Flummerfelt had been the only significant conducting lessons he ever received. “Flummerfelt had a such a relaxed way of approaching the sound, with relaxed gestures and breathing,” Mr. Nézet-Séguin said. “Today I regard those things as my fundamentals, as much for orchestral work as for opera and choral music.” Mr. Nally, who conducts the Crossing, a Grammy-winning professional chamber choir in Philadelphia, and directs choral organizations at Northwestern University’s Bienen School of Music, said in a telephone interview, “The country is absolutely populated with people who studied with Joe.” At Westminster, Mr. Flummerfelt broadened its repertory and performance opportunities, said Joe Miller, who succeeded him. “He was kind of the artistic visionary behind the school,” Mr. Miller said by phone. (The college made headlines recently for another reason: It is being sold by Rider University to a Chinese company, but the sale is being challenged in court.) Mr. Flummerfelt was brought to the Spoleto festivals in Italy and then Charleston by their founder, the composer Gian Carlo Menotti. When Menotti left the Charleston festival in a dispute in 1993, he made it clear that any artist who continued to work there would not be welcome at his Italian festival. Mr. Flummerfelt became the only artistic leader to give up Italy’s Spoleto — and give up working with Menotti — so that he could remain in Charleston, said Nigel Redden, who later became general director of the American festival. “It is impossible to overemphasize how important that decision was to the preservation of Spoleto Festival U.S.A.,” Mr. Redden wrote in an email. Mr. Flummerfelt’s survivors include a brother, Kent, and two sisters, Pam Flummerfelt Rappaport and Carol Flummerfelt Helmling. In the Nally book of conversations, he spoke of the transcendent nature of conducting “I do long for those moments where everything is in place, where everything is flowing, and then the real truth comes from the source — whatever that is: God, the creative impulse, it doesn’t matter what you call it. And suddenly, things happen, which you couldn’t have planned. Real beauty is being created because all of the forces are perfectly lined up and a profound innermost connection is manifested.” "
5c45982b3a125f5075c05788,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/21/world/asia/teresa-teng-china-beijing-taiwan.html,"BEIJING — A beer in one hand, a microphone in the other, Meng Xiaoli stood in a crowded restaurant and began to sing. Your smile is as sweet as honey, Just like flowers blooming in the spring breeze. I wonder where I’ve seen you. During the workweek, Mr. Meng, 53, a strait-laced budget analyst who wears a red Chinese Communist Party pin on his lapel, spends his days shuttling between meetings and poring over reports as a budget analyst for a state-owned firm. But on weekends, he retreats to what he calls his “spiritual home,” a two-story restaurant and museum in Beijing that is a shrine to the woman he considers a goddess: the Taiwanese pop singer Teresa Teng, one of Asia’s most celebrated artists. “She knows what it’s like to be human — to find love and to make mistakes,” Mr. Meng said. Ms. Teng, who died suddenly in 1995 at age 42, was renowned for turning traditional Taiwanese and Chinese folk songs into maudlin Western-style hits. She was once banned in the mainland, her music denounced by the authorities as “decadent” and “pornographic.” But she never lost her base of rabid fans here, even as tensions have escalated between China and Taiwan, the self-ruled island that Beijing considers part of its territory. Her most ardent followers now gather at the Teresa Teng Music-Themed Restaurant in a sprawling residential neighborhood in western Beijing, near liquor stores, barbecue joints and hot pot restaurants. An enormous portrait of Ms. Teng, smiling as she holds a white rose, graces its front door. Inside, singers dressed in elegant gowns perform renditions of her signature ballads like “The Moon Represents My Heart” and “Sweet as Honey.” Customers sample dishes inspired by Ms. Teng’s music, including “moon pancakes” and fried pumpkin with honey sauce. More than two decades after her death, Ms. Teng’s mainland fans say her sugary voice and gentle personality are still one of a kind. “She’s a storyteller,” said Zheng Rongbin, the media executive who opened the restaurant in 2011. “She looks like the girl next door.” At a recent lunchtime performance, Wu Yingwei, 30, watched as her daughter, Muyao, 2, danced to a performance of “Ask Yourself,” a song that is a staple of karaoke bars in Asia. Ms. Wu said her daughter liked listening only to Ms. Teng’s songs and could sing several of her hits, including “Sweet as Honey.” “Teresa Teng’s style never gets old,” she said. “Her songs are very gentle and make me feel really warm.” Ms. Teng is claimed by many mainlanders as one of their own, even though she was born in Taiwan. Her father, who grew up in the mainland in the northern province of Hebei, was part of the Nationalist forces that fought Mao Zedong’s Communists in the Chinese Civil War. He retreated to Taiwan in 1949, four years before Ms. Teng’s birth. Ms. Teng was one of the first foreign singers whose music flowed into China after it began opening its economy to the world in the late 1970s. But her music was quickly banned as part of a campaign by the Communist government to block “spiritual pollution” from the West. The Taiwanese government used her music as a psychological weapon, blasting it from loudspeakers positioned near the mainland. Tapes of Ms. Teng’s music circulated on a black market in the mainland, and her popularity was clear. Because of her surname, which in Chinese uses the same character as the Communist leader Deng Xiaoping’s, she was sometimes referred to as Little Deng, reflecting her hold on the public imagination. Ms. Teng occasionally veered into politics, holding concerts to show solidarity with the pro-democracy protesters who gathered at Tiananmen Square in Beijing in 1989. She never performed in the mainland. In recent years, however, the government has warmed to her music, and the state-run media has celebrated her mainland roots. In 2011, officials opened a memorial hall in honor of Ms. Teng in her father’s hometown, Daming, where fans now converge on the anniversary of her death. The mainland has at least two restaurants devoted to Ms. Teng, including the one in Beijing, which is at the center of a struggling cultural development known as Taiwan Street. Mr. Zheng, the owner, said Ms. Teng’s music was still popular in the mainland because it reminded people of hearing her songs for the first time in the years after the chaos of Mao’s Cultural Revolution. “For many people, it was a very new experience and very different from what they had heard in the Cultural Revolution,” he said. “Now when people hear it, they remember what it was like to be young.” Ms. Teng has been hailed as a symbol of commonality between China and Taiwan at a time when relations have deteriorated, with President Xi Jinping of China recently warning that efforts by Taiwan to assert independence could be met by armed force. But Mr. Zheng said he did not have politics in mind when he opened the restaurant. “Music has no sense of borders,” he said. The Beijing restaurant, which is officially recognized by Ms. Teng’s family in Taiwan, also includes a museum, on the first floor, displaying some of Ms. Teng’s dresses, pianos and clocks. On the second floor is the performance hall, with a chandelier and a disco ball. On busy nights, hundreds of people pack into the hall, gathering around tables covered with red-checkered tablecloths. Some guests opt for private rooms, where they sing karaoke versions of Ms. Teng’s songs. On a recent night, Wang Liang, 36, paid $15 to request a live performance of “I Only Care About You” for his wife and daughter. “Ever since I was a child, I’ve always liked Teresa Teng’s songs,” Mr. Wang said. “Her songs aren’t as flippant as pop songs now, and they really stick in your memory.” One of the singers at the restaurant, Wang Xin, 25, who was trained as a classical pianist, said Ms. Teng’s supple singing style, rich with vibrato, is difficult to imitate. “The emotions are hard to capture,” she said. “It’s very hard to find the right tone.” She practices by listening to Ms. Teng’s songs on repeat on her phone. At a recent show, Ms. Wang, wearing fake eyelashes and red lipstick to evoke Ms. Teng, approached the microphone to sing one of the pop star’s tougher standards, “What Do You Have to Say?”: I waited for more than a year, Three-hundred sixty-five days isn’t easy, You simply don’t have me in your heart, Give me my love back! "
5c9526c349f0eacbf105e8c0,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/22/arts/matthias-goerne-philharmonic-review.html,"Some artists, even acclaimed ones, use a residency with a major orchestra to perform the works they are known for. Bolder artists seize these coveted opportunities to take chances and work closely with individual musicians in the orchestra, as the superb German baritone Matthias Goerne has done this season with the New York Philharmonic. Last Sunday Mr. Goerne took his artist-in-residence series to the 92nd Street Y, where he explored new dimensions in familiar Schubert songs by performing them in unusual arrangements for voice and strings, joined by members of the orchestra. Schubert’s gravely beautiful “Death and the Maiden” sounded Mahlerian and starkly ominous, with Mr. Goerne, his voice dark and expressive, backed by a string quartet and bass instead of a piano. The first half of this program involved nearly an hour of concentrated singing for the tireless Mr. Goerne, including an intense rendition of Hanns Eisler’s rightly named “Ernste Gesänge” (“Serious Songs”), an autumnal 1962 cycle. And in several songs by Schubert, Schumann and Brahms, Mr. Goerne’s exemplary young accompanist was, no less, Daniil Trifonov, who played beautifully. For the last program of his residency, on Thursday at David Geffen Hall, Mr. Goerne sang a work that involved a different kind of risk: John Adams’s “The Wound-Dresser,” with Jaap van Zweden leading the Philharmonic. This poignant 1988 piece for baritone and orchestra sets passages from a poem by Walt Whitman about his experience nursing wounded soldiers during the Civil War in makeshift hospitals on the outskirts of Washington, D.C. The piece was written for Sanford Sylvan, the beloved American baritone who died in January. Mr. Sylvan “made our American language a thing of beauty every time he sang it,” Mr. Adams wrote in tribute to Mr. Sylvan at the time. A singer performing “The Wound-Dresser” must be able to convey the cadences and rhythms of the American language, no less so in Whitman’s elegantly poetic words. Mr. Goerne sang the texts with clarity, empathy and nuance, though, understandably, with traces of a German accent. Some of his delivery lacked crisp articulation. No matter. His performance was magnificent, in part because a great German artist was embracing a distinctively American piece and, in doing so, conveyed its universal resonances. When Mr. Goerne sang of the daily drudgery at the hospital, “Bearing the bandages, water, and sponge,” his voice was somber and earthy. But in moments when the poet is overcome with idealized love for the maimed soldiers (“One turns to me his appealing eyes — poor boy! I never knew you.”), Mr. Goerne sang with plaintive tenderness, lifting phrases into the light upper reaches of his voice. In the opening section, beautifully rendered by Mr. van Zweden and the orchestra, Mr. Goerne’s singing of Whitman’s spare-no-details descriptions of bloody soldiers soared over a backdrop of strings playing steady, swaying chords, music at once numbing and celestial. It was a great idea to precede this work with another distinctively American piece: Ives’s “Central Park in the Dark,” in which soft cluster chords in the strings suggest the hazy summer nighttime in the park as sounds of whistled tunes, ragtime pianos from apartment windows and more intrude. After intermission Mr. van Zweden led an emphatic, well-played account of Brahms’s First Symphony. Yet the Brahms work echoed back to the concert at the 92nd Street Y, which concluded with the violinist Frank Huang and the cellist Carter Brey (both principals with the Philharmonic) and Mr. Trifonov in a majestic yet impetuous account of Brahms’s Piano Trio No. 1. You could say that Mr. Goerne was somewhat responsible for this exhilarating trio performance, since it was a significant part of his thoughtful residency. "
5c5375f83a125f5075c0769d,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/obituaries/jean-guillou-dead.html,"Jean Guillou, a French organ master whose modern-sounding compositions, unusual transcriptions and idiosyncratic performances challenged centuries of tradition and were preserved on more than 100 recordings, died on Jan. 26 in Paris. He was 88. His death was announced by his music publisher, Schott Music. Mr. Guillou (pronounced ghee-YOU) never lost the capacity to shock in a career of nearly eight decades, from his beginnings as a church organist while still a child through the half-century he spent in one of the most important organ posts in France, at the church of St. Eustache in Paris. He bucked performance traditions; transcribed music by composers who could seem an odd fit for the organ (including Stravinsky, who had dismissed the organ by saying that “the monster never breathes”); wrote ambitious organ works in his own idiom; and helped design new organs that challenged conceptions of how the instrument should look and sound. “Guillou proved that organists need not follow the orthodox path,” Cameron Carpenter, a young American organ star with a punkish demeanor and unorthodox approach of his own, wrote in an email. Critics, and other organists, sometimes harrumphed at the interpretive liberties and flights of fancy that Mr. Guillou took in a time in which the trend, especially in early music, was toward historical fidelity. After a performance at Riverside Church in New York in 1982, the New York Times music critic Allen Hughes, while praising Mr. Guillou’s “astonishingly fleet” fingers, complained in his review that Mr. Guillou had “let his enthusiasm for organ gadgetry and color possibilities take precedence over the rhythmic solidity and interpretive scale and poise that make for art in performance.” But his flamboyant style was a revelation to many. Michael Barone, the host of Pipedreams, the American Public Media radio program about the organ, recalled that Riverside performance as thrilling. “When he would sit at the organ, it was almost as if the organ would explode, or burst into flames,” Mr. Barone said in an interview. “He would reach deep into the depths of the spirit of music, and he challenged the dynamic and technical capabilities of the instrument.” Mr. Guillou shrugged off the criticism. Stephen Tharp, an organist who studied with him, said Mr. Guillou had “played the organ repertoire with ideas that were very individual, and he did so without apology.” He recalled Mr. Guillou telling him, “If you’re still upset with anything that happens in the organ world, you haven’t spent enough time in it.” Although Mr. Guillou passed much of his life playing in churches, he also saw it as his life’s mission to “emancipate this instrument from the bonds of the church” and make it part of the larger music world, his biographer, Jörg Abbing, said in an email. His transcriptions were colorful — including organ versions of Bach’s “Goldberg” variations and works by Liszt and others. He once wrote of his transcription of Mussorgsky’s “Pictures at an Exhibition,” one of his most popular, that it could “only be justified to the extent that it makes us forget that it is a transcription at all, with the new instrument merging into the essence of the work.” And his own compositions were often daring — including “La Révolte des Orgues,” scored for nine organs and percussion, which became something of a cult organ piece, and “Alice in Organ Land,” for organist and narrator. The organist Paul Jacobs, who is the chairman of the organ department at Juilliard and has played Guillou works, said that despite his reputation as an enfant terrible, Mr. Guillou exhibited great refinement in his music. “His music can be shocking, full of crashing dissonances, with a carnal, rhythmic energy to it,” Mr. Jacobs said in a telephone interview. “But I’ve always found that there’s just that French sense of proportion, of knowing when you don’t go beyond a certain point.” Jean Victor Arthur Guillou was born in Angers, France, on April 18, 1930, to Victor and Marguerite Guillou. His father was a natural gas salesman. Jean was pressed into service playing the organ at a local church before he was even a teenager. He studied at the Paris Conservatoire with Marcel Dupré, Maurice Duruflé and Olivier Messiaen, spent time in Lisbon and Berlin, and was appointed organist at St. Eustache in 1963. Survivors include his wife, Suzanne, a professor and writer, and a daughter, Béryl Zuccarelli, said Giampiero Del Nero, the president of Augure, an association devoted to Mr. Guillou’s work. Mr. Guillou was always thinking about ways to modernize the organ. His designs were incorporated into new instruments around the world, including one shaped like a giant hand at a church in L’Alpe d’Huez, France, and another (now being replaced) that was used for nearly three decades at the Tonhalle concert hall in Zurich. His book “The Organ, Remembrance and Future” (2010) traces centuries of organ history while making the case that organists should not be hampered by tradition. Mr. Guillou recorded for the Philips, Decca and Dorian labels among others. His recordings preserve many of his performances of Bach, Liszt, Schumann, Brahms and his own compositions, and he appeared as the soloist in a recording of Saint-Saëns’s Symphony No. 3, the “Organ Symphony,” with the San Francisco Symphony. He taught hundreds of organists, giving master classes in Zurich regularly. Jean-Baptiste Monnot, who studied with him there and became his assistant at St. Eustache, said that Mr. Guillou had urged his students to find their own approaches to music, telling them, “Every time you interpret a work, you should have the sensation that you’re premiering it.” As Mr. Guillou himself put it in 1996 in an interview with Mr. Barone for Pipedreams,“Nothing is worse than to play in such a way that the organ seems to be a dead machine.” "
5c3e34bc3a125f5075c048cc,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/15/arts/music/winter-jazzfest.html,"The NYC Winter Jazzfest is 15 years old, which is apparently enough time to develop its own version of “the old days.” This year it stretched on for nine days, with concert marathons on consecutive weekends and marquee concerts sandwiched in between. Of all this, the best part might have been the evening most reminiscent of what the festival had been like five or 10 years ago. It was the Half Marathon on the event’s first Saturday, an extra night of shows organizers added to stay aligned with the Association of Performing Arts Presenters convention, using just six clubs across Lower Manhattan. (The following weekend, a more typical, two-day Marathon took over 11 spaces each night.) Fewer people came, so lines were shorter, and rooms were full but not crammed. Almost all the venues were easily walkable from each other, and it felt less like an opportunity to harvest information and more like a chance to sit with the music. In improvised music there’s hardly the risk of repeating oneself, and one of the best things about Winter Jazzfest is running across the same artist in multiple contexts in a given night. During the Half Marathon, Joel Ross led a quintet at Subculture, perhaps the festival’s finest listening venue, a small underground theater with good sound and plenty of room to move around. Mr. Ross, 23, is the player to watch in New York this year: a vibraphonist who unites a lot of the instrument’s jazz history — from Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia and New York — and understands the vibes as a possible connector between hip-hop and West African music. But he hasn’t totally cracked the code as a bandleader, a role that upstart musicians these days are expected to fill. His serviceable set of neatly sculpted originals only really took off near the end, when the young alto saxophonist Immanuel Wilkins, his frequent collaborator, assumed the lead on Mr. Ross’s ballad “Touched by an Angel.” Reflecting the pinched sound of Oliver Lake and the pith of Jackie McLean, Mr. Wilkins allowed the melody to teeter and crash, making his feelings known without overstatement. Mr. Ross was among the most-hired players at the festival, and it was as a side musician that he shone most brightly. Later that evening, on the drummer and producer Kassa Overall’s set at Nublu, he locked into the slinky groove of “Layin’ with the Swami,” throwing things off every few cycles with a squib outside the scale. Mr. Ross was the M.V.P. sideman in this quartet, but really the honor belonged to him and Brandee Younger in tandem; her harp joined up with his vibraphone to create a single unit, woven and resounding. (They’ve done this before.) Mr. Overall was recreating the lighthearted but heavy-grooving vibe of the Blue After Dark jam sessions at Zinc Bar, which he hosted until recently on behalf of Revive Music (he left to begin a new residency at the Jazz Gallery). The vocalist and multimedia performer Melanie Charles will take over from Mr. Overall, later this month, and on Friday, during the full marathon, she performed at Mercury Lounge, where Revive curated a stage. Ms. Charles sang original music, sometimes from behind a deck of electronics, making a kind of astro-hydraulic pastiches in both Haitian Creole and English. Videos projected onto a screen behind her showed grass and city scenes, and when she cued a sample from Aretha Franklin’s “Day Dreaming,” the iconic singer’s image appeared onscreen. It’s a tough song to cover, but Ms. Charles’s band mostly got it (Revive’s other stage, at the Bowery Ballroom, hosted a less successful closing jam session on Saturday, full of special guests like Thundercat and Bilal but frustratingly orchestrated by the drummer Chris Dave, who could never seem to get satisfied with his sound team or his band.) Vocalists at the edges of jazz, R&B and spoken word were a recurring theme throughout both weekends. At the Half Marathon, this year’s artist in residence, Meshell Ndegeocello — who performed in different configurations throughout the festival — presented a program titled “No More Water, the Fire Next Time,” with a midsize band holding down slow grooves, and the poet Staceyann Chin reading acid verses. Quoting James Baldwin and telling of her own childhood in Brooklyn, she sped past outrage and sorrow, getting straight to a sense of conviction. During the Saturday of the full marathon, the singer Georgia Anne Muldrow joined the drummer Justin Brown’s band, Nyeusi. She delivered lines of homely inspiration, sometimes in a casual repartee, elsewhere in a wail. “All this colonization in your brain, you gotta empty it out for the real thing to come in,” she said. Behind her, Nyeusi ditched the wavy, synth-driven sound of its 2018 album, embracing something crunchier, more savory. Some of the full weekend’s purest energy was on display at the SoHo Playhouse, a rustic little theater on Vandam Street. There the booking outfit Search and Restore — which has been involved in the festival for about a decade — secured a constant flow of boldly inventive musicians across two nights. Many of them, like the bass clarinetist Lea Bertucci and the trumpeter Steph Richards, were horn players testing the limits of their instruments — and their listeners. In duo with the drummer Gerald Cleaver on Friday night, the tenor saxophonist Travis Laplante used circular breathing to play repetitive, slowly morphing patterns that were both startling and hypnotic. Your ear echoed differently with every note, so that you ended up experiencing each cluster as a prism of many resonances, more than as a melody or a rhythm. What’s new in jazz doesn’t always equate to youth, or even any clear stylistic break. At Subculture on Saturday, the tenor saxophonist J.D. Allen, 46, working with a still-new trio, welcomed David Murray, a stalwart saxophonist one generation Mr. Allen’s senior. As they played Mr. Allen’s stern but flexible original tunes, there was a vast difference in their approaches, but they traded ideas easily. The younger player often worked in long and heavy tones, related to John Coltrane; even his quickest lines had a wary darkness. Mr. Murray used a higher center of gravity, often vaulting from cool swing to fish-at-the-end-of-the-line agitation. On the punchy “Graffiti,” Murray chewed on his horn, softening the rhythm, and Nic Caccioppo’s drums ended up in an open tumble. During the second weekend, Nublu’s stage was given over to International Anthem, a four-year-old independent label in Chicago that is already having an outsize influence on creative music. On Friday at 11:30, I knew I should be seeing what all the fuss was about with Louis Cole, a wunderkind YouTube sensation whose jazz-infused, fratty IDM is starting to give Snarky Puppy a run for its money. He was playing at the Sheen Center, a theater across from Subculture. Instead, I stood in the front row for all of Ben LaMar Gay’s riveting set — a tangle of samba, blues and math-rock, bouncing from Bubber Miley to Animal Collective — and then stuck around for Joshua Abrams and Natural Information Society, a sextet featuring the bandleader on guimbri, Lisa Alvarado pulling chords out of a sighing harmonium, and Jason Stein playing sharply cut patterns on the bass clarinet. Mr. Stein’s funny shapes jutted up against the group’s circular, silt-over-rock flow, creating good tension. Mr. Abrams has been making Afrocentric, droning free jazz like this for a long time. In recent years, that kind of thing has become more commonplace on the avant-garde. Still, even if it didn’t reveal any blazing new truths, Mr. Abrams makes affecting music; I was glad to have stayed put and taken it in. "
5c9a79fa49f0eacbf105f280,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/26/obituaries/scott-walker-dead.html,"Scott Walker, who with his American pop group, the Walker Brothers, became a teenage idol in Britain in the 1960s, but who later immersed himself in experimental music that influenced artists like David Bowie and Radiohead, died on Friday in London. He was 76. His record label, 4AD, said the cause was cancer. He had been living in England since the 1960s. The Walker Brothers arrived in England in early 1965, reversing the earlier British invasion of America. There, the group — made up of Mr. Walker (his real name was Noel Scott Engel), a dramatic baritone who played bass; John Maus, a guitarist and vocalist; and Gary Leeds, the drummer, all of whom used the surname Walker — found the success that had eluded them in the United States. Though their popularity never reached Beatlemania levels, their fans, like those of the Beatles, would scream during their performances — and, in one harrowing incident, turned over a van taking them from a concert in Dublin. Evoking the blue-eyed soul of the Righteous Brothers, the Walker Brothers had several hits, two of which rose to No. 1 on the British charts: “Make It Easy on Yourself,” a ballad by Burt Bacharach and Hal David, and “The Sun Ain’t Gonna Shine Anymore,” which had first been recorded by Frankie Valli of the Four Seasons. Both songs also rose to the Top 20 of the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States. Mr. Walker left the group in 1967 to start a solo career that became a rejection of his rock-star phase. In one iteration he recorded songs by the Belgian singer and songwriter Jacques Brel. But his most critical period was a retreat into the studio to create avant-garde music that was hard to categorize: ominous and clangorous, existential and electronic, with big blocks of sound, his baritone voice now used to almost operatic effect. For many years, he did not appear in concert. Reviewing a recording on which Mr. Walker collaborated with the metal band Sunn O))) in 2014, Ben Ratliff of The New York Times described his music as “intricate puzzles of shock, indiscretion, non-resolution, theatrical uses of text and extended technique, often with a 40-piece orchestra.” He added that Mr. Walker was always looking for a “whoops factor”— “a moment of incomprehension from the listener.” In a message on Twitter, Thom Yorke, the lead singer and main songwriter of Radiohead, wrote that Mr. Walker had shown him “how I could use my voice and words.” “Met him once at Meltdown,” he added, referring to the annual music and art festival in England, “such a kind gentle outsider.” Noel Scott Engel was born on Jan 9, 1943, in Hamilton, Ohio, about 30 miles north of Cincinnati, the only child of Noel and Elizabeth Marie (Fortier) Engel. His father was an oil company geologist whose job took the family to various cities. When Scott was about 6 his parents divorced, and he went to live in Denver with his mother. They subsequently moved to New York, where in the mid-1950s Scott, still a schoolboy, began his entertainment career. He had small roles in the Broadway musicals “Plain and Fancy” and “Pipe Dream” and recorded singles, including “When Is a Boy a Man?” (1957), as Scotty Engel — hoping, without success, to break through as a teenage idol. Many of those songs were later released in the compilation album “Looking Back With Scott Walker” (1968). Around 1960 he and his mother moved to Los Angeles, where he attended high school and the Chouinard Art Institute. He also played in various music groups, worked as a session bassist and, in 1964, formed the Walker Brothers with Mr. Maus (who had already been using John Walker as a pseudonym). They played at the Whisky a Go Go and other clubs along the Sunset Strip. Although the best-known songs of his Walker Brothers period did not portend how radical his music would become, Mr. Walker began to demonstrate a willingness to free himself from the conventions of pop and rock as early as 1967, when he began releasing a series of solo albums — “Scott,” “Scott 2,” Scott 3” and “Scott 4.” He did so again on “Nite Flights” (1978), an album made during a brief reunion of the Walker Brothers. Along the way, he found an admirer in David Bowie. Mr. Bowie, a transcendent musical experimenter, was in a relationship with a woman who had dated Mr. Walker and kept his albums. Mr. Bowie listened to the music and became so enamored that he later took the role of executive producer of  “Scott Walker: 30 Century Man” (2007), a documentary directed by Stephen Kijak. “I like the way he can paint a picture with what he says,” Mr. Bowie said in the film. “I had no idea what he was singing about. And I didn’t care.” Mr. Walker, who worked on his albums slowly and meticulously, continued his musical evolution with “Climate of Hunter” (1984). With “Tilt” (1995) and “The Drift” (2006), he drew closer to matching his ambition to his creative visions — and to those that crept into his mind while he slept. “I have a very nightmarish imagination,” he said in the documentary, which focuses on the recording of “The Drift.” He added: “I’ve had bad dreams all my life. Everything in my life is big, it’s out of proportion.” “Clara,” a song on “The Drift,” reimagines the executions of  Benito Mussolini and his mistress, Claretta Petacci, at the hands of Italian partisans in 1945. (It was inspired by newsreels Mr. Walker had seen as a child.) Another song, “Jesse,” imagines a conversation between Elvis Presley and Jesse, his stillborn twin brother, as a vehicle to write about the destruction of the World Trade Center. In a plaintive, eerie vocal reminiscent of Mr. Bowie, Mr. Walker sings: Fame is a tall, tall tower A building left in the night Jesse, are you listening? It casts ruins in shadows Under Memphis moonlight Jesse, are you listening? Howard Kaylan, a founding member of the Turtles, said in a 2013 interview that he had been listening to Mr. Walker since the 1960s. He was a fan of the Walker Brothers, he said, but thought of Mr. Walker’s solo music as the work of genius. “My jaw hit the ground when I heard ‘Tilt,’ ” Mr. Kaylan told the newspaper Record Collector News. “And by the time he got to ‘Drift,’ I understood what he was doing: He is doing the most conventional pop music I ever heard. He is just doing it as if he was observing it from outer space and then trying to tell you what he saw as an alien.” Mr. Walker’s survivors include his partner, Beverly; his daughter, Lee; and a granddaughter. Mr. Maus died in 2011. Some of Mr. Walker’s lyrics were published last year in the book “Sundog,” with an introduction by the Irish novelist Eimear McBride, who compared Mr. Walker to James Joyce. “Walker’s work, as Joyce’s before it, is a complex synesthesia of thought, feeling, the doings of the physical world and the weight of foreign objects slowly ground together down into diamond,” Ms. McBride wrote. “This is not art for the passive. It does not impart comfort or ease. Tempests will not be reconciled by the final bars, and no one is going home any more.” "
5c7047743a125f5075c0b10d,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/22/arts/music/r-kelly-charged-indicted.html,"For more than two decades, the R&B singer R. Kelly has been trailed by allegations of sexual misconduct. He was married to a young singer who turned out to be 15 years old. There were claims that he controlled women in a cultlike atmosphere. He was linked to an infamous sex tape. None of it meaningfully stood in his way. Then, on Friday in Chicago, after weeks of renewed scrutiny, Mr. Kelly was indicted. The authorities accused him of aggravated criminal sexual abuse involving four victims, three of whom were underage, according to the Cook County state’s attorney, Kim Foxx. Aggravated criminal sexual abuse can carry a sentence of three to seven years in prison for each count. Mr. Kelly, whose real name is Robert Kelly, faces 10 of them. “This was 30 years in the making,” said Jim DeRogatis, the music journalist who was among the first to document allegations against Mr. Kelly. The singer, 52, was tried on 14 counts of child pornography and ultimately acquitted in 2008. But in the intervening years, the world around him has changed. The #MeToo movement has washed across the country. As the fallout from abuse by Catholic priests unspooled, statutes of limitations on the sexual acts involving children have been raised or, in states like Illinois, abolished altogether. Women who were afraid to come forward or who were not believed are increasingly being heard. Ms. Foxx said the events related to Mr. Kelly’s charges spanned from 1998 to 2010. Three of the victims were between the ages of 13 and 16 at the time of the events. [Meet the Chicago prosecutor asking R. Kelly’s accusers to come forward.] Mr. Kelly is accused of ejaculating on one victim, identified by the initials L.C., in a forcible encounter, an attempted criminal sexual assault. Court documents said she reported the offense to law enforcement officials within two years of its occurrence. Prosecutors said that Mr. Kelly had oral sex and intercourse with the other three victims, all of whom were less than 17 years old, too young to legally consent. Mr. Kelly, who turned himself in to the police in Chicago on Friday night, is due in court on Saturday for a bail hearing. After Mr. Kelly surrendered, his lawyer, Steven Greenberg, spoke to reporters for several minutes, fiercely maintaining Mr. Kelly’s innocence and blasting the state’s attorney for what he characterized as succumbing to public pressure by bringing charges against him. At one point he claimed that all of the women accusing Mr. Kelly are lying. “Mr. Kelly is strong, he’s got a lot of support and he’s going to be vindicated on all of these charges,” he said. “One by one, if it has to be.” After so many years of accusations, Mr. Kelly became the focus of scrutiny after the documentary “Surviving R. Kelly” was broadcast on Lifetime in January. The six-part series included testimony from several women who accused the singer of abuse dating back to the 1990s. The celebrity lawyer Michael Avenatti said last week that he had obtained a video showing Mr. Kelly having sex with a 14-year-old girl, and had given it to the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office in Chicago. He has said that Mr. Kelly and the girl refer to her age multiple times in the video, which is more than 40 minutes long. On Friday, Mr. Avenatti said that the video depicted oral, vaginal and anal sex, and that Mr. Kelly urinates on the girl. At one point in the footage, Mr. Avenatti said, Mr. Kelly has the girl watch a pornographic video on a screen, which depicts Mr. Kelly with another young woman. [What we know about R. Kelly’s two-decade trail of sexual abuse accusations.] On Thursday, two additional women came forward at a news conference in New York organized by their lawyer, Gloria Allred, to accuse Mr. Kelly of sexual abuse and misconduct when they were minors. The women, Latresa Scaff, 40, and Rochelle Washington, 39, said they met the singer after a concert in the mid-1990s when they were 16 and 15; they said he asked for a threesome and had sex with Ms. Scaff. “This may not be the only prosecution of Mr. Kelly, because we are aware of other open investigations in other jurisdictions,” Ms. Allred said on Friday. Ms. Allred said that two of her clients had been interviewed by federal investigators in Brooklyn. Federal investigators in Manhattan were also looking at Mr. Kelly’s conduct, although the circumstances were not immediately clear. “We’re glad to see the allegations against R. Kelly are being taken seriously and hope that these charges empower victims to come forward,” Rainn, the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network, said in a statement. “The survivors who shared their stories showed admirable courage and strength.” Mr. Kelly was acquitted in 2008, but allegations of sexual misconduct have followed him for much of his career. More than 20 years ago, Vibe magazine questioned a marriage certificate that said the singer Aaliyah was 18 when she and Mr. Kelly were wed. She was, in fact, 15 at the time and the marriage was annulled. Mr. Greenberg has said Mr. Kelly did not know she was underage at the time. Aaliyah died in a plane crash in 2001. [The lonely, and risky pursuit of R. Kelly: Meet the journalists who followed the case.]  Now a legacy act selling concert tickets largely on the strength of his catalog, Mr. Kelly was a powerful hitmaker when he was arrested on child pornography charges in 2002 over a tape prosecutors said showed him having sex with and urinating on an underage girl. He continued to release hits as his lawyers filed motion after motion, delaying the trial for six years. The girl from the video never testified, and though 14 witnesses identified her, Mr. Kelly’s lawyers argued successfully that her identity could not be proven. He was acquitted on all 14 counts he faced. In 2017, the allegations picked up again when Mr. DeRogatis, the music journalist, wrote articles for BuzzFeed News that described Mr. Kelly keeping women in a “cult,” in which he separated them from their families and exerted tremendous control over their lives. Last year, the social media campaign #MuteRKelly gained momentum, seeking to put pressure on the companies involved with Mr. Kelly’s career, including the streaming services Spotify and Apple Music; Ticketmaster, which sells tickets to his concerts; and RCA Records, a division of Sony Music that released his last four albums. While Mr. Kelly seemed impervious to the accusations, things appeared to take a turn in January, after “Surviving R. Kelly” caused a stir. Law enforcement authorities in Illinois and Georgia, where he has lived, began looking into his conduct. And after tremendous public pressure from activists, Mr. Kelly was dropped by RCA, just two weeks after the program aired. The fact that the alleged victim did not participate in Mr. Kelly’s 2008 trial was a significant problem for the prosecution, jurors said. “All of us felt the grayness of the case,” one juror told reporters at the time. On Friday, Ms. Foxx read off the charges against Mr. Kelly at a news conference and left without taking questions. Mr. DeRogatis was in the room. “The first girl, who I met,” he said, “it was 1991. She was 15. Thirty years the system has failed. I’d like to be optimistic today. I don’t know if I am.” "
5c6ee8d13a125f5075c0ad83,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/obituaries/peter-tork-dead.html,"Peter Tork, a struggling musician who became an overnight teenage idol in the 1960s with the Monkees, died on Thursday at a family home in eastern Connecticut. He was 77. His son, Ivan Iannoli, said the cause was complications from a rare form of cancer that was first diagnosed in 2009. Mr. Tork, who grew up in Connecticut, lived in Mansfield, east of Hartford, according to The Hartford Courant. The Monkees were an unabashedly manufactured band, created by Hollywood producers in the 1960s to capitalize on the astounding popularity of the Beatles. The members — Mr. Tork (the oldest, at 24), Davy Jones, Micky Dolenz and Mike Nesmith — were cast as the stars of an NBC sitcom, “The Monkees” (1966-68), in which they performed and dealt with comic situations with a childlike irreverence, much as the Beatles had in their hit films “A Hard Day’s Night” and “Help!” Mr. Tork was positioned as the goofy one, the court jester. The director Bob Rafelson, one of the show’s creators, compared him to Harpo Marx. Because they were created for television, did not write their own songs (that was left to professionals like Gerry Goffin, Carole King and others) and did not play their own instruments (they mimed playing on camera), the Monkees were disdained by many; if the Beatles were the Fab Four, the Monkees quickly earned the derisive nickname the Prefab Four. But they surprised many in the music industry, and perhaps themselves as well, when they became popular both on television and on the charts. Their show won the Emmy Award for outstanding comedy series in 1967, and the band’s many hit records — including “Last Train to Clarksville,” “Daydream Believer,” “Pleasant Valley Sunday” and the infectious if simplistic “(Theme From) The Monkees” (“Hey, hey, we’re the Monkees / And people say we Monkee around … ”) — for a while earned them sales on the same stratospheric level as the Beatles’. Both Mr. Tork and Mr. Nesmith were accomplished musicians — Mr. Tork played several instruments — and Mr. Dolenz and Mr. Jones were seasoned singers. (As a child, Mr. Jones had played the Artful Dodger in “Oliver!” on Broadway.) But because studio musicians did the playing on the first two Monkees albums, the notion that they were not a real band persisted. That began to change in 1967, when the group released what came to be considered its signature album, “Headquarters,” on which they played most of the instruments themselves and wrote several of the songs. Mr. Tork co-wrote some of them, and he shared lead vocals with Mr. Jones on the wistful ballad “Shades of Gray.” (Peter Tork vocals were a rarity on Monkees albums — he was by far the group’s weakest singer — but he had some memorable ones, often laced with humor, beginning with “Your Auntie Grizelda” on the band’s second album, “More of the Monkees.”) The Monkees recorded for only three years before disbanding; their popularity faded after their TV show was canceled, and Mr. Tork left the band in 1969. But the group enjoyed a revival in the 1980s and reunited for numerous concerts and tours, although usually without Mr. Nesmith. Mr. Tork recorded his first solo album, “Stranger Things Have Happened,” in 1994. He later formed a blues band, Shoe Suede Blues, with which he continued to perform and record until recently. The band’s latest album, “Relax Your Mind,” was released last year. “The blues is about community,” Mr. Tork told The Courant, explaining his genre switch. “Not about how lonely I am, but everybody’s been lonely.” Peter Halsten Thorkelson was born on Feb. 13, 1942, in Washington, the son of Halsten John Thorkelson, an economics professor, and Virginia Hope (Straus) Thorkelson. The family moved to Connecticut, where Peter graduated from high school in Storrs. He attended Carleton College in Minnesota, but left before graduating and moved to New York, where he performed in folk clubs in Greenwich Village and met another up-and-coming musician, Stephen Stills. In California, where both had relocated, Mr. Stills tried out for the Monkees. When that didn’t work out — some sources say Mr. Stills was rejected because he had bad teeth; Mr. Stills himself said that he rejected the job because he wanted to write songs for the show but that would have meant surrendering his music publishing — he recommended Mr. Tork, because people had always told the two that they looked alike. Mr. Tork left show business shortly after leaving the Monkees and at one point taught high school in Santa Monica, Calif. There were financial problems, and personal ones as well; he dealt with alcoholism and drug abuse, and served a short prison sentence for hashish possession in 1972. Later in his career he made guest appearances on a handful of television series, including “The King of Queens” and “7th Heaven.” His last movie role was in “I Filmed Your Death,” a horror drama yet to be released. Mr. Tork reunited with his fellow Monkees for a world tour in 2011 and with Mr. Dolenz and Mr. Nesmith in 2012 for a tour that included a tribute to Mr. Jones, who died that year. In recent years the surviving Monkees released two albums. Mr. Nesmith and Mr. Dolenz went back on the road last year, without Mr. Tork, for a tour billed as “The Monkees Present: The Mike & Micky Show.” (That tour was interrupted when Mr. Nesmith underwent heart surgery but resumed this year.) Mr. Tork’s marriages to Jody Babb, Reine Stewart and Barbara Iannoli ended in divorce. In addition to his son, he is survived by his fourth wife, Pamela Grapes, whom he married in 2014; two daughters, Hallie Iannoli and Erica Thorkelson; a sister, Anne Thorkelson; a brother, Nick Thorkelson; and three grandchildren. His brother, Christopher Thorkelson, died before him. Like many artists, Mr. Tork concluded that happiness came simply from doing the work. “It’s about getting to play the music full time,” he told The Los Angeles Times in 1992. “It’s not about the following anymore, the fame game. A little bit of fame is fun, but I’ve had enough, thank you.” "
5c8c237849f0eacbf105d5e4,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/15/arts/television/iggy-pop-punk-epix.html,"Over the years, the Michigan-born rocker James Osterberg Jr. — better known by his stage persona, Iggy Pop — has earned a reputation as “the Godfather of Punk.” This is thanks mostly to his tenure as the frontman of the proto-punk band the Stooges, but also because his reckless, sui generis stage presence embodied a gleeful but slightly scary abandon that became synonymous with the genre. His presence looms over “Punk,” a four-part documentary series about the fashion, politics and musical influences that defined punk rock, which debuted this week on Epix. Osterberg (credited as Iggy Pop) is an executive producer of the series, along with the fashion designer John Varvatos — which might raise eyebrows given that Varvatos put what some would say was the final nail in punk’s coffin in 2007 by buying CBGB, the hallowed punk club at 315 Bowery, and replacing it with one of his boutiques. In a phone interview, Osterberg defended Varvatos and also discussed the Sex Pistols, drugs and his favorite music critics. These are edited excerpts from that conversation. Punk, in its original form, was nothing if not iconoclastic. How do you feel when critics, fans or other musicians call you the “Godfather of Punk”? Once it gets into reverence, does that bother me? Yeah. I was, initially, but now I don’t mind being called “Godfather of Punk;” I suppose I’ve grown into the suit! There are occasional personal feelings that come from one-on-one interactions, when someone lets me know something genuine about the role that my work played in their life. When any type of music is still enjoying its vitality — that’s a social influence. And then, as people carry on that style and figure out how to further produce it, the style becomes academic, by really imperceptible steps. Even in country music: There is a hell of a big stretch going from Hank Williams to Garth Brooks, buddy! That process of change happens in all genres. Rock ‘n’ roll sort of took a beating and is now basically irrelevant, because it got mined to death. But whatever anybody wants to call me is O.K. I’ve been called worse things than the “Godfather of Punk”! You’ve said that the Sex Pistols were honest with their fans because they always told their fans that they shouldn’t be trusted.  I said “They always thought they were honest.” I don’t remember applauding anybody for saying “Don’t trust me.” I was much more impressed with their onstage ability than whether they were swindled out of thousands of dollars by their manager [Malcolm McLaren]. I just don’t care. But that doesn’t mean [McLaren] was not an effective Barnum-type showman. He was, you know? And that’s fine. The group, as a whole, had a lot of flair. Johnny Lydon is very good at the things you’re supposed to be good at when you front a group. And [the guitarist Steve Jones] was a really good foil for Johnny, especially when it came to doing publicity. Everybody contributed something musically, or in terms of image, to the group. In “Punk,” the deaths of the Sex Pistols bassist Sid Vicious and his girlfriend Nancy Spungen are presented as examples of how drugs essentially killed the punk movement. There was a lot of that stuff around the music business as I experienced it, as a punky type. And it was the hard stuff, so there was always a price to be paid. LSD and marijuana were the stuff being pushed in 1966 and 1967. And taking those drugs has a way of breaking down some barriers that people need to hold themselves together. But while those barriers are being broken down, you also get insights about life and the world around you, especially if you’ve grown up as a milk-fed American lamb to the slaughter, as we all were when we were told, “Go to Vietnam, but don’t ask why.” All that. Cocaine came in next. And it seemed like a good drug because, after a while, the weed and the LSD weren’t doing it anymore. Some people were getting into speed, but cocaine was a more upscale stimulant that, in effect, kept the party going. Eventually, people’s nerves were shot, their patience had worn thin, and many turned to opioid drugs, as well as Valium and other soporifics. Those are very subtle, dangerous drugs. Are there books or critics about either your music or punk music that you think are especially valuable? Lester Bangs and Nick Kent are two people I can think of, off the top of my head. Both of them, in sort of a flailing, wild, highly subjective way. But why not! At least the two of them were treating what they write about like it’s actually important. I read the stuff Lester Bangs wrote about me and thought: “Oh no, I’m a buffoon! But wait: I am a salient blowtorch of nihilism. Cool! Wait, am I cool or not? I’m not sure!” I have one of his books in hardback. I’ve had it for a long, long time. It’s sitting on the shelf along with “The Andy Warhol Diaries,” the collected works of Allen Ginsberg and a few other books. I look at their spines and think: “O.K., this is what’s important!” In “Punk,” you talk about your work without retrospectively judging yourself. What kind of questions were you asked and how did they make you feel? I knew and had worked for John Varvatos before I accepted both the interview and the fairly basic responsibilities that come with being listed as an executive producer. He loves and is genuinely interested in music. I once saw, in one of his stores, a book about the 100 greatest rock albums or something; at the time, I was modeling for him, so I was picking up some free swag. The book was thoughtful; it was a work of “soulful commerce,” I would say. So I knew that was where this show’s interview questions were going to be coming from. Like, there would inevitably be questions like: “So, you became a junkie … ” and that sort of thing. Whereas, a critic — who’s concerned with arcana and “pure art” — is going to have different questions. In those cases, you listen to the question and try to answer it inasmuch as it can be respected. And then you try to insert something of your own that has nothing to do with the question, so that you get in your own licks. You try to twist the thing over a little bit to your own point-of-view. What would you say to people who remain outraged that CBGB was turned into a Varvatos boutique? What would I say to people who think, “It all happened at CBGB, man”? There was something about that room that was conducive to a range of musical approaches that centered on a kind of detail-oriented, reference-oriented, intellectually-tinted art-rock. Like Talking Heads and many aspects of the Ramones, which was stylized in many ways. And Blondie, though that’s not as obvious in Blondie: [The lead singer Debbie Harry] seemed to learn how to sing out of nowhere. I don’t know how she could have done that without a club she could go to over and over while she was learning. And then Patti Smith’s group, obviously, even though I think “The Piss Factory” was recorded in the Nightingale. That was a little dive bar, smaller than CBGB, where they kept sawdust on the floor because people were going to puke, pee and spit, right? But she was also playing at CBGB, too. You could develop in that room. It was small in a particular way. "
5c6c743c3a125f5075c0a7aa,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/19/obituaries/bibi-ferreira-dies.html,"Bibi Ferreira, an indefatigable grande dame of the Brazilian stage who performed internationally and helped bring Broadway musicals to Brazil in the 1960s, died on Feb. 13 at her home in Rio de Janeiro. She was 96. Her death was confirmed by Júnior Amaro, the producer of her New York shows. Ms. Ferreira, who sang in English, French and Spanish as well as in Portuguese, began acting when she was a child and continued performing well into her 90s — although she did not make her New York debut until 2013. Her voice was powerful and protean, capable of making material identified with artists like Édith Piaf and Frank Sinatra entirely her own. “Ms. Ferreira is a chameleon known for her probing, psychologically layered portrayals and the sweeping grandeur of her singing,” the music journalist James Gavin wrote in The New York Times of her last performance in New York, in 2016 at 94. Beginning in the early 1960s, Ms. Ferreira starred in Portuguese translations of three Broadway musicals that became widely popular in Brazil. She was Eliza Doolittle in “My Fair Lady,” Dolly Gallagher Levi in “Hello, Dolly!” and Aldonza in “Man of La Mancha.” In 1975 she starred in “Gota d’Agua,” a hit reworking of the Greek tragedy “Medea” set in an impoverished neighborhood in Brazil. The show featured music by the celebrated songwriter and novelist Chico Buarque and was written by Paulo Pontes, Ms. Ferreira’s husband at the time. Ms. Ferreira was closely identified with her interpretation of Piaf’s work, which began in 1983 with a Portuguese version of the play “Piaf,” by the British playwright Pam Gems. She performed the play in Brazil and Portugal, and Piaf songs remained a favorite part of her repertoire. “She was the real voice, singing on the streets, never learning music,” Ms. Ferreira said of Piaf in 2016. “She only cared about two things: love and love.” Although Ms. Ferreira was beloved in Brazil and familiar to audiences around the world, she was little known in the United States until 2013, when she played a packed, one-night engagement at Alice Tully Hall at Lincoln Center. She returned twice more. On her last visit, she performed a one-woman show, “Bibi Times Four,” at Symphony Space on the Upper West Side. Ms. Ferreira acknowledged that some people thought performing at her age could be dangerous. But she called such concerns silly. “People are worried about me, and they shouldn’t be,” she said. “Now I’m 94, and I sing better every day.” Abigail Izquierdo Ferreira was born in Rio de Janeiro on June 1, 1922, to Aída Izquierdo, a dancer, and Procópio Ferreira, an actor and director. Her life practically began onstage: When she was about a month old, she appeared in a production as a last-minute stand-in for a lost baby doll. Ms. Ferreira studied at an American diplomatic school in Rio, having been turned away by a local Roman Catholic school, which would not accept the daughter of entertainers; the profession was widely considered disreputable at the time. She danced all over South America, beginning when she was about 3; studied ballet and opera; played the piano, violin and guitar; and learned several languages. Ms. Ferreira appeared in her first lead role in a major production in 1941, alongside her father in Rio de Janeiro, in “The Mistress of the Inn,” by the Italian playwright Carlo Goldoni. She remained with her father’s theater company until 1944, when she formed her own. That company performed Portuguese translations of plays by Oscar Wilde and Joseph Kesselring as well as an original play by Ms. Ferreira, “Angelus.” She also appeared in a few movies — notably “The End of the River” (1947), with the Indian actor Sabu — but most of her career was spent on the stage. Ms. Ferreira was married many times; she was usually vague about how many, but when pressed often told interviewers that the number was five. She told The Times that she was “born to be married,” adding, “Well, marriage shouldn’t be long.” Her marriage to Mr. Pontes ended with his death in 1976. She is survived by a half sister, Lígia Ferreira; a daughter, Teresa Cristina Ferreira, from her marriage to Armando Pinto Martins; two grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren. "
5c54e28e3a125f5075c07a78,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/01/obituaries/sanford-sylvan-dead.html,"Sanford Sylvan, the American baritone whose introspective eloquence and serene yet commanding presence put him at the center of some of the most important operatic events of recent times, died on Tuesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 65. The cause was not immediately known, his family said. Mr. Sylvan’s voice — solid, but silken and plangent — and his combination of emotional openness and understated dignity brought to operatic life two crucial characters in landmark works by John Adams. He was the first Chou En-lai in “Nixon in China” (1987) and Leon Klinghoffer in “The Death of Klinghoffer” (1991). He was also the soloist at the premiere of “The Wound-Dresser” (1989), Mr. Adams’s reflective orchestral setting of Whitman’s poem. “He was my muse,” Mr. Adams said in a phone interview on Thursday. “Certainly for the male voice during that period.” Mr. Sylvan was proposed for the “Nixon” role by its director, Peter Sellars, for whom he also starred in a pair of modern-dress stagings in the 1980s: “Così Fan Tutte,” which took place at a roadside diner, and “Le Nozze di Figaro,” set in Trump Tower in Manhattan. The productions were a radically unconventional approach to Mozart, and Mr. Sylvan’s energetic and sensitively shadowed portrayals — in “Così,” his Don Alfonso was a Vietnam veteran embittered by grief — were central to their success. “Sandy could sing that music with purity and a danger zone,” Mr. Sellars said in an interview on Thursday. “And Mozart at that time was not thought to be dangerous.” Sanford Mead Sylvan was born on Dec. 19, 1953, in New York City, and grew up in Syosset, on Long Island. His mother, Lenore (Cohen) Sylvan, was a teacher, and his father, Elliott Sylvan, was a trucking company executive. Inspired by a recording of Leontyne Price in “Aida,” Sanford fell in love with opera at an early age, and music teachers quickly discovered he had a voice. Not yet in high school, he was admitted to the Juilliard School’s pre-college program, and he spent several summers at the Tanglewood Music Center, where he studied with the great soprano Phyllis Curtin, a passionate advocate of new music. He went on to the Manhattan School of Music, working on the side as an usher at the Metropolitan Opera. But after graduation, Mr. Sylvan did something unusual. “In those days it was heresy to leave New York City if you wanted a career,” he said an interview with The New York Observer in 2011. “But I went to Boston in 1977 and it was the best thing I ever did. It’s hard to describe what Boston was like in the ’70s, ’80s and ’90s. There was a real relationship with the audience.” In Boston, where he already had contacts through his time at Tanglewood, Mr. Sylvan met the pianist David Breitman, with whom he began a long recital partnership. He also became a part of the prestigious and close-knit ensemble Emmanuel Music, which the conductor Craig Smith had founded there in 1970 at Emmanuel Church, with performances of Bach’s cantatas at the group’s core. Mr. Smith, who was working on Mr. Sellars’s 1981 production of Handel’s “Orlando” at the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Mass., brought Mr. Sylvan in to audition for the title role. Orlando goes mad in an extended, intense, vocally dazzling scene in the second act. “Sandy’s madness had absolute clarity,” Mr. Sellars said. “No operatic MSG. He put all the big gestures we’re used to from opera into this deeply personal space.” “Orlando” led to Mr. Sellars’s Mozart cycle and the Adams operas, which became famous for mining recent history for its mythical import. “John found Sandy’s temperature,” Mr. Sellars said, “and Sandy’s temperature deeply inspired John.” That temperature could seem deceptively mild. Chou En-lai, in “Nixon in China,” is the voice of reason in a tensely charged cast of characters, and Mr. Sylvan projected calm and equanimity. But he also captured undercurrents of fragility and anxiety. His Chou ended the opera in a tone of visionary resignation, summing up the frustration of the Nixon-Mao summit with a single, unanswerable question: “How much of what we did was good?” While “Nixon” summoned Mr. Sylvan’s gravity and “The Wound-Dresser” his melancholy, “The Death of Klinghoffer” — a reflection on the 1985 hijacking of the cruise ship Achille Lauro by Palestine Liberation Front militants, who killed Leon Klinghoffer, a disabled Jewish American passenger — demanded of Mr. Sylvan an overt outrage not usually associated with him. But he made Klinghoffer’s indignation musical, and the aria sung by the character’s dead body, falling from the ship after being thrown overboard, was a controlled outpouring, rage focused into tenderness. His recordings, many with Mr. Breitman, include programs of Schubert, Fauré, Jorge Martin and Virgil Thomson, as well as a luminous, delicate 1991 release, “Beloved That Pilgrimage,” which includes Theodore Chanler’s “Eight Epitaphs,” Barber’s “Hermit Songs” and Copland’s “Twelve Poems of Emily Dickinson.” Mr. Sylvan took part in the New York premiere of Mr. Adams’s opera “A Flowering Tree” in 2009, and also performed contemporary works by composers like Peter Maxwell Davies, Philip Glass, John Harbison and Charles Fussell. Mr. Sylvan took regular sabbaticals, spending time in a small farming community in Scotland and exploring Buddhism and Judaism. But he remained grounded for decades in the Boston music scene. He became so closely associated with that city that when he moved to Montreal in 2007 to take a teaching position at McGill University, The Boston Globe ran an article about on his departure with the headline “Sanford Sylvan Uproots Himself.” He began teaching at Juilliard in 2012, and became chairman of the school’s voice faculty last year. He is survived by his mother; his brother, Seth; and his sister, Gwen Sylvan. The broad success and reach of Mr. Sylvan’s performances — Mr. Sellars’s Mozart stagings toured widely and were broadcast internationally, and the Adams operas, which Mr. Sylvan performed in multiple cities, were made into acclaimed recordings — did not change his modest, focused approach to his career. He chose his projects and collaborators carefully, and his work always felt meticulously, but never aridly, tailored. His tone was both airy and substantial; his diction crystalline; his manner direct and unaffected. “I just did what I wanted,” he said in the 2011 interview. “I didn’t live like a prince. To sing the ‘St. Matthew Passion’ with a great conductor, that’s the bottom line for me. You don’t get rich singing the ‘St. Matthew Passion,’ you just get happy.” "
5caf1e8d49f0eacbf1f82bc1,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/movies/satan-and-adam-review.html,"The blues seep into every scene of “Satan & Adam,” a gritty yet lovely documentary. And even after the songs stop, the music’s bittersweet emotions linger. Sterling Magee worked as a studio and backup musician in the 1960s and ‘70s, playing with James Brown and Marvin Gaye, and recording on Ray Charles’s label. Stung by exploitation in the industry, he rechristened himself as Mr. Satan and became a street musician in Harlem. Adam Gussow, a Princeton University graduate living in New York, was wandering near the Apollo Theater in 1986 and stopped to listen to Magee. The two soon started performing together. They were a pair often defined by their contrasts, not the least of which was their looks: Magee, a fiery black veteran guitarist, side by side with the young Gussow, a white and somewhat nerdy harmonica player. The duo began to attract crowds, then acclaim: They toured Europe, recorded an album that made the charts (“Harlem Blues”), and were featured on a U2 record. V. Scott Balcerek, the documentary’s director, tells the story (later parts of which are better discovered onscreen than spoiled here) using decades of well-shot footage and interviews, and an underlying sense of melancholy. You can easily imagine some Hollywood executive eyeing up the tale for a treacly feature film of interracial understanding. And certainly, this documentary highlights the strong friendship between the two men. Yet even with a short running time the filmmakers don’t shy away from more complex issues — racial tensions, gentrification, art and anger. Like the blues, there’s real pain here, mixed with real beauty. "
5c943e7b49f0eacbf105e63b,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/21/theater/aint-too-proud-review-the-temptations.html,"As befits a show about the Temptations, the most infectiously rhythmic of chart-topping R&B groups, “Ain’t Too Proud” keeps time in style. I don’t mean that solely in terms of a beat that makes you feel like dancing. Of course, as you watch this latest entry in Broadway’s ever-expanding jukebox musical sweepstakes, you will no doubt find your legs twitching, as if from muscle memory. That’s the urge being translated with such sublime grace by those five natty men on the stage, Platonic ideals of stepping high and looking fine. But it is also true that time, unforgiving and unstoppable, is cannily presented as the shaping element in “Ain’t Too Proud: The Life and Times of the Temptations,” which opened on Thursday under the shrewd direction of Des McAnuff, with sensational choreography by Sergio Trujillo. As the show charts the changing fortunes of men who became synonymous with Motown’s glory days, the years keep moving forward with the relentlessness of a conveyor belt in an auto-making assembly line. [Read about Cholly Atkins, the real-life choreographer for the Temptations.]  It’s enough to wear a strong man down. And more than any of the (oh so many) pop-songbook shows that have befallen Broadway since the Abba-spouting behemoth “Mamma Mia!” opened in 2001, “Ain’t Too Proud” is a story of attrition. We watch as the core lineup of the original Temptations is whittled down to the last man standing. That’s the group’s leader and show’s narrator, Otis Williams, played with anchoring gravity by Derrick Baskin. Ultimately, though, it’s the music that’s the sole survivor. And that’s what’s being celebrated here — the collective miracle of a blissfully silken sound forged out of clashing egos, many misfires and life-wrecking hard work into numbers that keep playing in our memories. While honoring all the expected biomusical clichés, which include rolling out its subjects’ greatest hits in brisk and sometimes too fragmented succession, this production refreshingly emphasizes the improbable triumph of rough, combustible parts assembled into glistening smoothness. Dominique Morisseau, who wrote the show’s book, is the gifted author of a cycle of smart, tough-minded plays based in her native Detroit, where much of “Ain’t Too Proud” is also set. Her script, adapted from Otis Williams’s 1988 memoir, reminds us that the Detroit-based Motown Records — the crossover label run by Berry Gordy (Jahi Kearse) that revolutionized pop music — was indeed a factory of sorts, one that rigorously processed and refined raw talent for mass consumption. This means that unlike such current fare as “Beautiful” (about Carole King), and “The Cher Show,” “Ain’t Too Proud” isn’t focused on a single star, with the attendant by-the-numbers psychology. Instead, we have a study in group dynamics, in which the balance shifts in ways big and small, as the component parts keep changing. As Otis observes early on, after the firing of the group’s original lead singer, Al Bryant (Jarvis B. Manning Jr.), “Sometimes Temp stood for temporary.” This sense of interchangeability (and expendability) is given witty visual life in the second act, when a cavalcade of identically dressed Temptations, past and present fills the front of the stage. (Paul Tazewell did the delicious costumes.) [What’s new onstage and off: Sign up for our Theater Update newsletter.] Not that the audience is ever likely to confuse one Temp for another. The five-member group that most people know as the Temptations is embodied with piquantly detailed individuality by charismatic, supple-voiced actors who astutely convey the imbalanced equations of ego and accommodation in their characters. They are, in addition to Mr. Baskin, James Harkness (as Paul Williams), Jawan M. Jackson (as a Melvin Franklin who talks as well as sings in a thundering bass), Jeremy Pope (late of “Choir Boy,” who here plays Eddie Kendricks) and a smoking hot Ephraim Sykes (as David Ruffin). We meet them first as a team, singing “The Way You Do the Things You Do,” the Temptations hit from 1964, before Otis shepherds us back to the group’s starting point. That segue follows the formula established by “Jersey Boys,” the long-running Broadway hit from 2005 about the Four Seasons, also directed by Mr. McAnuff and generally considered the gold standard for jukebox biographies. (It has been reincarnated Off Broadway at New World Stages.) Like “Jersey Boys,” “Ain’t Too Proud” rapidly follows a fairly straightforward timeline through some pretty rough terrain. So in addition to seeing the Temps on (and back) stage, and in the recording studio — with mentors that include Smokey Robinson (Christian Thompson) and Norman Whitfield (Mr. Manning) — we are given quick-sketch glimpses of the grim personal and social problems that derail them. (Robert Brill’s set, lighted by Howell Binkley with projections by Peter Nigrini, neatly balances grit and glamour throughout.) Some of these synoptic moments can seem bizarrely perfunctory, as in a crack-smoking sequence and, worse, a party scene that portrays Ruffin’s abusive relationship with the singer Tammi Terrell (Nasia Thomas). And the attempts to portray the dawning social consciences of the singers — who became famous at the height of the civil rights movement — can feel strained. (On the other hand, I enjoyed the brief encounters with the women in the men’s lives, including the Supremes, led by Candice Marie Woods in a pitch-perfect evocation of Diana Ross, and Rashidra Scott makes the most of her onstage time as Otis’s neglected wife, Josephine.) Mercifully, the show mostly avoids the usual jukebox pitfall of jimmying in songs to reflect the plot in literal ways. Instead, the musical numbers generally register as a rippling, liquid mirror of societal and personal flux, especially in the ways they show the Temptations’ sound being calibrated to suit a mainstream (i.e., white) audience. As for the performance of those songs, orchestrated by Harold Wheeler with musical direction and arrangements by Kenny Seymour, they’re pretty close to perfection. They’re not entirely mimetic, which is a relief. These Temps (whose later additional members are ably incarnated by Saint Aubyn, E. Clayton Cornelious and Mr. Thompson) sound enough like their prototypes to satisfy hard-core fans. But the fabulous standards, which include “Cloud Nine” and “Papa Was a Rollin’ Stone,” have been reimagined with a heightened Broadway flair that stops short of pandering. This is especially true of the sinuous synchronicity of Mr. Trujillo’s choreography, in which everyone is often doing the same moves, but with a subtle, stylish edge that sets each member apart. (Or not so subtle, though still highly stylish, in the case of Mr. Sykes’s spectacular scissor splits.) You’re always aware of the component parts in this well-oiled music machine. As its title suggests, “Ain’t Too Proud” promotes the virtue of humility, at least when it comes to keeping a team together. But it also makes sure that these men never become ciphers. The happy paradox of this group portrait is that everybody gets to be a star. "
5c6d6bd03a125f5075c0a9a7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/20/theater/joe-iconis-be-more-chill-broadway.html,"Joe Iconis exploded out of N.Y.U. on a wave of hope. A songwriter with a knack for story and a taste for strange, he won the Jonathan Larson grant for early career composers. He scooped up the Kleban prize for most promising lyricist. He was hailed by Newsday as “ginormously talented.” The descriptors piled up until they made no sense any more. Emerging. Rising. Up-and-coming. But something wasn’t clicking. Year after year he wrote song after song, show after show. Small-scale productions came and went; big-time producers did not. He sustained himself on determination. And side jobs. And borrowed money. But mostly, he sustained himself with an unusual artistic collective — the Family, an evolving cohort of multitalented misfits (their word) — that, for more than a decade, has plied basements and barns, singing Mr. Iconis’s rock- and pop-influenced songs to a growing audience of fans. It is fandom that is finally propelling Mr. Iconis to Broadway. The sci-fi high school musical “Be More Chill,” for which he wrote music and lyrics, was left for dead in New Jersey after a tepid review from The New York Times. Resurrection has come thanks to young enthusiasts, who created YouTube videos using the show’s music, shared fan art on Tumblr, and have streamed the cast album more than 200 million times. The show, adapted from a young adult novel by Ned Vizzini about a nerdy teenager who swallows a pill-sized supercomputer that promises to improve his life, is now in previews at the Lyceum Theater; about half the cast are performers who are part of Mr. Iconis’s crew. Now he is spending his nights where he has long wanted to be, in the row of creators cradling laptops and binders at the back of a Broadway theater, polishing the show before it opens March 10. On his right forearm he sports a tattoo of a mule. “Hairy and stubborn,” he explains. “Just like me.” Mr. Iconis, 37, says his life changed forever when, as a 6-year-old growing up on Long Island, he saw his first Off Broadway musical: the original production of “Little Shop of Horrors,” a zany rock romp about a blood-craving, flesh-eating houseplant. “I was a little kid who was really scared — I would always cry in movies, and I never wanted to be away from my parents,” he said. “But ‘Little Shop’ didn’t scare me. It made me feel alive.” Each year for his birthday, and sometimes on holidays, he would see another show. He tracked theater seasons by reading newspaper ads; he tried to estimate box office grosses by calling ticket sellers to ask about seat availability. He loved theater. But he hated performing. “I was always terrible,” he said. “I knew I was terrible. And it terrified me.” So he took to the piano, writing songs, directing shows, doing anything that allowed him to make theater without being center stage. “I both gravitate toward and identify with people who feel like they don’t quite fit in,” he said. In college and grad school, both at New York University, he zeroed in on writing, and for his thesis in 2005, he crafted a musical about a garage band, “The Black Suits,” that seemed to have promise. “I thought, ‘This show will be produced Off Broadway, it will be well received, it will go to Broadway, and this is how I will enter into the musical theater world,’” he said. The universe had other ideas. And Mr. Iconis, a prolific writer, was impatient to get his songs heard. So in 2006 he staged a concert at Ars Nova, a small but prestigious theater that seeks to develop early-career artists. He thought of “Things to Ruin,” as he called it, as a theatrical version of a rock album that never existed. He was the de facto frontman, playing the piano and occasionally singing, and he found that he now relished that. But his shows were also a showcase for his friends. The cabaret scene in New York was dominated by solo acts and celebrities, but Mr. Iconis wanted something different — a sort of troupe of troubadours, most of them unknown. He had inspirations in mind — the filmmaker Robert Altman, for one, but also the Muppets, because, in Mr. Iconis’s fervid imagination, they are the model of an ensemble that successfully integrates friendship and theatermaking. There were maybe 10 participants to start — among them Jason Tam and Jason SweetTooth Williams, both of whom are in the cast of “Be More Chill,” Mr. Tam as the Squip (that’s the supercomputer) and Mr. Williams in three roles, including a high school drama teacher. By last Christmas, when Joe Iconis and Friends performed what are now their annual Christmas shows at Feinstein’s/54 Below, directed by his longtime collaborator John Simpkins, there were 65 performers — onstage, interspersed among the audience, even caroling in the bathrooms. “We were a bunch of rambunctious punk kids that loved musical theater but maybe didn’t quite fit into the quintessential musical theater mold,” Mr. Tam said. “But we found each other and we found Joe Iconis.” Many of his songs are clever and raw, like “Everybody’s at the Bar Without Me,” a furious ballad about feeling left out, and “The Goodbye Song,” the raucous singalong which closes most shows, inspired by a dying father bidding farewell to his child, but also weaving in affectionate allusions to E.T.’s return home in the great 1982 Spielberg movie. In the early years, the concerts were mostly at the Laurie Beechman Theater, a basement space underneath a Times Square restaurant, and at Joe’s Pub, part of the Public Theater. In recent years, the main performances have been over Labor Day weekend at Barrington Stage Company in the Berkshires, and in December with a series of Christmas-themed shows at 54 Below, but there have been lots of others — even a private party attended by James Earl Jones. “It feels like this crazy circus that has followed him and helped put the music out there and spread the word about what he does,” said Lauren Marcus, who met Mr. Iconis when she was at N.Y.U., sang in one of his earliest concerts, and then married him at a ceremony followed by a jamboree. The performances are silly and celebratory and self-referential. The recent Christmas show included jokes about “making people go viral” (an allusion to “Be More Chill”), and managed to be at once ever-so-winkingly politically incorrect and super-woke. (“Baby, It’s Cold Outside” featured an interpolated exchange between the two performers about the gender politics of the song.) Over the years, artists have come, and gone, and come again. “The more I met people, the more it started to become this idea — like I’m driving a bus, and I would tell people to hop on, and they could stay as long as they want to,” Mr. Iconis said. “The whole Family idea is loose enough to accommodate the lives of working artists — it needed to allow people to come and go as their life allowed.” Some are on Broadway — Eric William Morris, a longtime member of the Family who portrays an addled bartender in the Christmas shows, is now starring in a musical adaptation of “King Kong” — but many, like Mr. Iconis, have long been waiting for a big break. “We shared that feeling — when is this going to happen, and should we just go be investment bankers?” Mr. Williams said. “What got him and all of us through these struggling times were these concerts that we did together.” There’s been some blowback. “I definitely have a reputation of being very loyal, and that’s important to me — I love creating art with artists I have a history and a relationship with,” Mr. Iconis said. “But there was this notion of me as a frat boy working with his college friends. People got so insane about this idea of me just working with my buds.” He is unapologetic about wanting to advance his collaborators, and not simply allow them to be replaced by “someone who was on a TV show in 2003,” which is how he often sees theater casting. “Many people have performed my stuff brilliantly for years, and I feel like it’s my responsibility to do whatever I can to help,” he said. George Salazar, an actor who was featured in a Broadway revival of “Godspell” when he met Mr. Iconis, started singing in his concerts, and is now starring in “Be More Chill” as the protagonist’s best friend; his emotional rendition of the show’s big number, “Michael in the Bathroom,” has made him an internet sensation. “The Family is a group of misfits,” Mr. Salazar said, “but the things that make us strange and different are the very things Joe enjoys.” Mr. Iconis likes to write in public spaces — coffee shops and bars — away from the piano, focusing on lyric and drama, and letting that drive melody. He has been prolific, helping to create 10 full-length musicals, but has also been increasingly disappointed that none found commercial success, and at times has even wondered whether he should try to convert one of his side jobs, graphic design, into a full-time career. “He’s had a tough time getting shows on, because people don’t know where to place his shows — they have a childlike exuberance for adults,” said Julianne Boyd, the artistic director of Barrington Stage. He is culturally omnivorous, and often turns to musicals or films to explain his own feelings. Asked about his frustration, he cites a scene in “Boogie Nights” when the porn star protagonist realizes he is not going to get where he wanted, and a moment in “Synecdoche, New York” when a character buys a house on fire, knowing it might kill her. But one doesn’t have to look far to see how taxing his long journey has been: His breakout song, “Broadway, Here I Come!,” an oft-covered number featured on the NBC television series “Smash,” is, at its most literal, about someone hoping to get to Broadway who contemplates suicide. “I never stopped working, and I never stopped doing concerts, but it started to feel like there was a bit of doom hanging over everything, and then I started to see other people now coming up, and they were the next big things, and I was passed over,” he said. “After a while it started to feel exhausting.” He was introduced to “Be More Chill” by his agent, who suggested that he and the book writer, Joe Tracz, take a look at the novel. From the beginning, members of the Family have been part of the development process. The Broadway cast includes not only Mr. Tam, Mr. Williams, Ms. Marcus and Mr. Salazar, but also stars Will Roland, who as an N.Y.U. student in 2008 had a cameo in the Christmas show. And one of the show’s producers, Jennifer Ashley Tepper, was a college student interning at the York Theater Company when she stumbled across an Iconis demo tape; she was wowed, and has been helping produce his concerts and shows for the last decade. “The path has been hard,” she said. “There was one night when I was so upset about a bad review a show of Joe’s got that I threw a glass out a window.” “Be More Chill,” directed by Stephen Brackett, had its initial production at Two River Theater in New Jersey; Mr. Iconis and his collaborators thought it was going well, but after The New York Times disagreed, that was the end of that. “We spent nearly two years trying to get producers and regional theaters interested, and it was very clear no one was,” Mr. Iconis said. So he agreed to license the show for community productions, and many signed up; since June of 2017, R&H Theatricals has issued 145 licenses for the show. Among those who licensed the show was Jerry Goehring, the director of the theater arts program at a Connecticut college, Sacred Heart University. He was startled at how quickly the school’s production, which he directed, sold out, and how many people traveled from afar to see it, so he optioned the rights. Last summer, Mr. Goehring and Ms. Tepper rented space Off Broadway to stage a commercial run of the show. That, too, sold out, with throngs of young people defying the critics and flocking to the show. So Broadway, here they come. And now that Mr. Iconis is a Broadway composer, the theater world is opening to him further. Emboldened by “Be More Chill,” which is selling well in early previews, Ms. Tepper is planning this week to announce a commercial Off Broadway production of another Iconis show, “Broadway Bounty Hunter,” about an out-of-work actor who finds a job hunting criminals. It stars Annie Golden, who, although more than a generation older than Mr. Iconis and his college friends, is one of his most loyal collaborators. He has two more high-profile works in process: “The Untitled Unauthorized Hunter S. Thompson Musical,” commissioned by La Jolla Playhouse, with a Tony-winning director, Christopher Ashley, attached; and “Punk Rock Girl,” a jukebox musical featuring songs popularized by female musicians. “The dream is that it’s a show done by school groups, and that it would be impossible not to cast the strangest kids — the kids who would normally do tech,” Mr. Iconis said. “That was my guiding principle — to write roles for the weird kids."" As he watches “Be More Chill” through the preview process, he is obviously nervous, aware that critics still may not embrace his work. But he is determined to use the energy surrounding this show to fuel his other projects. “You can use your theater cred to do film or TV or music, but I’m just not interested,” he said. “The thing I want to do is have musicals running in theaters, hopefully close to, or on, Broadway.” "

He was 92. The Wiener Staatsoper in Vienna, where Mr. Adam sang many times, posted the news of his death. Dominique Meyer, the opera’s director, called him “undoubtedly one of the most important interpreters of the 20th century.” Mr. Adam, a bass-baritone, was a regular at the Bayreuth Festival in Germany beginning in the early 1950s, and in February 1969 he made his debut at the Metropolitan Opera in New York in one of his signature roles, Hans Sachs in Wagner’s “Die Meistersinger.” At a time when, for many operagoers, the singing was the only thing that mattered, Mr. Adam brought an actor’s sensibility as well as a fine voice to the stage. “Mr. Adam has developed the vocal and histrionic aspects of his art with equal care and success,” Allen Hughes wrote in The New York Times in reviewing Mr. Adam’s Met debut. “His voice is relatively light in weight and texture, and he sang here with a smoothness and flexibility that basses do not invariably possess.” “Mr. Adam is not a tall man, he has not let himself get fat, and he moves lithely,” Mr. Hughes added. “Indeed his movements, so splendidly scaled and timed, made his acting a joy to follow.” By the time he retired in 2006 he had appeared in operas and recitals all over the world. For his final performance, that November at the Semperoper in Dresden, he reprised the role of the hermit in Carl Maria von Weber’s “Der Freischütz,” which he had first performed at the same house in 1949. Theo Adam was born on Aug. 1, 1926, in Dresden. He sang in the Dresden Kreuzchor, a renowned boys choir, and was drafted into the German Army late in World War II. After the war, he studied singing before making his Semperoper debut in 1949. Mr. Adam joined the rosters of both Bayreuth and the Berlin State Opera in 1952. He first performed the role of Wotan in the Wagner “Ring” operas in 1963, and in 1967 he took his Wotan to the Royal Opera House in London. Metropolitan Opera audiences got to see him as Wotan in “Die Walküre” in 1969, just after his Met debut as Hans Sachs. He was back at the Met in 1972 in the same role, and, as was often the case, even critics who weren’t taken with a particular performance found something to like. “He sang the role in a dry manner, and had to gasp out some of the low notes,” Harold C. Schonberg of The Times wrote of that 1972 appearance. “It was a performance that was, however, redeemed by intense musicality, dignity and a stately stage presence.” Mr. Adam wrote several books about his life in music. Information on survivors was not immediately available. Mr. Adam was also known for numerous other roles, including the title character in Alban Berg’s “Wozzeck.” Philip Borg-Wheeler, reviewing a 1973 recording of that opera for Music Web International, said of Mr. Adam’s performance that “we have here arguably the most magnificent Wozzeck on record.” That is one of many recordings on which Mr. Adam is heard, including not only operas but also Masses, oratorios and other types of music. In 1997, the Washington Post music critic Joseph McLellan reviewed a two-CD compilation of songs, by various composers, that Mr. Adam had recorded. “This is a fine selection of the best lieder appropriate for a bass voice,” he wrote, “sung by the great Theo Adam with impressive style and deep emotional commitment.” "
5c3639c23a125f5075c0393d,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/09/arts/music/alex-lilly-2-percent-milk-review.html,"Through heartache, rejection, workplace harassment and pervasive disillusionment, Alex Lilly’s songs keep their cool on her debut album, “2% Milk.” Her voice is supple and relaxed; she often sounds like a smile is tugging at the corners of her mouth. And she brings a wry, analytical skepticism even to matters of the heart. In “Boomerang,” about giving an ex another chance, she sings, “I’ve tried to find someone new/Believe me though it’s hard to, they’re all worse than you.” Lilly, who is based in Los Angeles, has been writing songs while working as a keyboardist and backup singer on tour with Beck, Lorde and others, including a longtime spot in the suavely devious pop band the Bird and the Bee; “2% Milk” arrives on the label founded by Inara George, who leads the Bird and the Bee with the producer Greg Kurstin. And like the Bird and the Bee, Lilly delivers structural and emotional complexity with deceptive nonchalance. Lilly’s songs are full of musicianly gamesmanship. They’re synth-pop built around a decidedly human protagonist; they use hopscotching melody lines, shifty meters, subtly intricate counterpoint and spongy, unconventional synthesizer tones. But Lilly isn’t just showing off. Her convolutions also tell stories. In “Distracting Me,” she breaks away from workaholic concentration to realize, gratefully, “I love it when you are distracting me.” For that one line, she adds a beat, cheerfully disrupting her 4/4 routine. The album’s title song, with some lyrics by the poet Jacqueline Suskin, treats “2% Milk” as a symbol of a diminished life. “All that was rich/All that was whole/Used to be mine,” Lilly sings in an angular melody, while the beat lurches and cello-like countermelodies tug her further into malaise. “Cold Snap” turns post-breakup despair into an almost perverse triumph. The chords in the verses descend from undulating serenity into dissonance, but then the chorus swells as it proclaims, “Spring has come so I’m told/But I’ve become permanently cold.” “Pornographic Mind” — about a co-worker who’s all too eager to misread friendly conversation — observes, “There’s a delicate balance between work and play.” It begins with Lilly repeating “porno-pornographic” in a cascade of vocal harmonies suggesting Philip Glass, at once pretty and mathematical. That leads to a verse with melting synthesizer chords and a fidgety bass line: a sonic equivalent of the murky area between chatting and creepiness. Eventually, she decides, “All I know is, I don’t need this,” and, more luckily than some women, she makes her escape. Lilly is proud to overthink things. She stress-tests a relationship in “Hypothetical,” positing, “Let’s say we broke up today” and later explaining, “I like a love that doubts itself” and “I trust the heart that’s clinical.” Meanwhile, however, the underlying beat hints at girl-group romance. And subtly but surely throughout the album, Lilly makes clear that cool doesn’t mean cold. She’s thinking and composing her way through disappointment, loneliness and uncertainty. In the stately, shimmery closing song, “Firefly,” she mourns a romance that didn’t happen: “Almost a miracle, but it all came undone.” The smile in her voice isn’t oblivious or naïve; it’s a matter of will.

5c8818e649f0eacbf105cb4a,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/12/obituaries/jacques-loussier-dies.html,"Jacques Loussier, a French pianist who led a trio that performed jazzy interpretations of Johann Sebastian Bach, selling millions of albums and touring the world, died on March 5 at a hospital in Blois, in France’s Loire Valley. He was 84. His death was confirmed by his daughter, Hélène Loussier Oziouls Toulouse. His son Julien said the cause was complications of a degenerative disease. Mr. Loussier was classically trained, but he had dabbled in jazz improvisation for years when he formed the Jacques Loussier Trio in 1959. The other members were the drummer Christian Garros, who had played with Django Reinhardt, and the bassist Pierre Michelot, who had recorded with Miles Davis. The trio played recognizable Bach melodies or pieces, like “Air on a G String” and the Prelude No. 1 in C, then took flight into bebop improvisations. They quickly found a devoted audience and released a popular series of albums on Decca under the overall title “Play Bach” beginning in the early 1960s. Many critics bridled at the idea of jazzing up the work of Bach. John Rockwell of The New York Times, reviewing a performance at Carnegie Hall in 1975, wrote that he was “actively appalled by the very notion of ‘popularizing’ Bach — or any classical composer, for that matter.” “Mostly,” Mr. Rockwell continued, the trio “stuck too close to Bach for jazz and too close to cocktail/salon jazz for satisfaction.” In 2002, Mr. Loussier told the British newspaper The Independent  that such criticism did not bother him. “Bach himself,” he noted, “was improvising on these pieces for many years.” Other critics were more positive about Mr. Loussier’s playful style, including Robert Sherman, who reviewed another Carnegie Hall performance by the trio in The Times in 1966. “Mr. Loussier is a man with a fertile imagination, excellent musical instincts (given the basic premise of his transcriptions) and a powerhouse technique,” Mr. Sherman wrote. “The snippets he played ‘straight,’ or reasonably so, showed flair and intelligence, and even when poor old Bach was left far behind, Mr. Loussier’s volatile pianism was never less than compelling.” The Jacques Loussier Trio broke up in the late 1970s, and Mr. Loussier went on to compose original works, including music for French films and television. In 1985, the 300th anniversary of Bach’s birth, Mr. Loussier rebuilt the trio with André Arpino on percussion and Vincent Charbonnier on bass. The new trio embraced other composers in its jazz adaptations, including Satie, Debussy,  Ravel, Vivaldi and Beethoven, and released more albums. His last new release, on the Telarc label, was a version of Schumann’s “Kinderszenen,” in 2011. Mr. Loussier was born on Oct. 26, 1934, in Angers, in western France, to René Loussier, who worked in a bank, and Marguerite (Duvat) Loussier, a homemaker. He started playing the piano at 10, and later said that his distinctive approach to Bach developed while he practiced the Prelude in G Minor. “I played it 100 times or so,” he said. “Then one day I started to change the melody, then the left-hand harmonies. It was a natural instinct.” He studied for a time at the National Conservatory of Paris. “My fellow students would always ask me to play some Bach with my improvisations,” he said. “At that time, the Modern Jazz Quartet was doing this thing already: I heard them, and that gave me the idea to transform it with bass and drums.” In 1959, the year the Jacques Loussier Trio released its first album, he married Sylvie de Tournemire. Their marriage ended in divorce. In 1998 he married Elizabeth Note. In addition to his wife, with whom he lived in Cour-sur-Loire, France, and his son and daughter, Mr. Loussier is survived by three other sons, Thomas, Jean-Baptiste and Pierre; 13 grandchildren; and one great-grandson. In a case that brought Mr. Loussier renewed attention, he sued Eminem and Dr. Dre for $10 million in 2002, charging that they had used his music without credit. He asserted that “Kill You,” the first song on Eminem’s album “The Marshall Mathers LP” (2000), was suspiciously similar to one of his compositions, “Pulsion.” Mr. Loussier said that he thought Eminem or Dr. Dre, who produced most of “The Marshall Mathers LP,” had heard a snippet of “Pulsion” that he had played on one of his Bach recordings and “thought it was Bach’s music, not mine.” “So they used it without asking permission,” he continued. “If they had come to me, I would have accepted, and allowed them to use it for nothing, but they didn’t, which is not nice.” The case was settled out of court.

5c535cca3a125f5075c0764d,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/obituaries/harold-bradley-dead.html,"NASHVILLE — Harold Bradley, who played on thousands of country, pop and rock ’n’ roll recordings, including landmark hits like Brenda Lee’s “I’m Sorry,” Patsy Cline’s “Crazy” and Roy Orbison’s “Only the Lonely,” died on Thursday in Nashville. He was 93. His death, at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, was confirmed by his daughter Beverly Bradley. Beginning in the 1940s, Mr. Bradley’s work on six-string bass and guitar was also featured on records by, among many others, Red Foley, Hank Williams, Elvis Presley, Buddy Holly, the Everly Brothers and Loretta Lynn. Mr. Bradley, known for his spare, soulful playing, also played banjo and other instruments. But according to Guitar Player magazine and other sources, he is among the most recorded guitarists in history. The younger brother of the pioneering record producer Owen Bradley, Mr. Bradley also served for decades as the de facto leader of Nashville’s A-Team, the elite circle of first-call session musicians immortalized in the Lovin’ Spoonful’s 1966 Top 10 hit “Nashville Cats.” “Clear as country water” is how that song characterized the intuitive, uncluttered playing of the team under Mr. Bradley’s direction, an expansive ensemble that also included the pianist Floyd Cramer and the pedal steel guitarist Pete Drake. By the late ’60s, the group’s laid-back, no-frills approach drew folk and rock luminaries like Bob Dylan, Joan Baez and the Byrds to Nashville to record with them. “Everything that was happening in the studio — that was my world; that was as big as it got,” Mr. Bradley said, looking back on Nashville’s 1950s and ’60s heyday in a 2013 interview with NPR. “And then one day, my brother came up and he said, ‘We’ve got 25 out of the top 50 songs,’ ” Mr. Bradley continued, referring to the profusion of hit singles that featured Nashville’s A-Team. “All of a sudden I’m thinking, ‘That stuff we did in the studio, people are listening to that all over the world.’ ” Although he was a capable lead guitarist, Mr. Bradley made his mark as a rhythm specialist. His signature style featured a clicking, propulsive figure, often performed on six-string electric bass, that mimicked the lines of the acoustic bass. Known among industry insiders as “tic tac,” Mr. Bradley’s less-is-more approach furnished the supple rhythm bed for both Eddy Arnold’s “Make the World Go Away” and Tammy Wynette’s “Stand by Your Man.” In the process he helped shape not only the pop-inflected “Nashville sound” of singers like Mr. Arnold and Ms. Cline, but also the more soulful “countrypolitan” sound of Ms. Wynette, George Jones and Conway Twitty. As accomplished an entrepreneur as he was a musician, Mr. Bradley, with his brother Owen and Owen’s son Jerry, was among the first to build independent music studios on Nashville’s Music Row. By 1955 the three of them had merged their initial two ventures into Bradley Film and Recordings Studios, a musicians’ haven more commonly known as the Quonset Hut. During its first months of operation, the Quonset Hut produced blockbuster hits like Gene Vincent’s “Be-Bop-a-Lula,” Marty Robbins’s “Singing the Blues” and Sonny James’s “Young Love.” By the time Columbia Records purchased the facility in 1962, the Bradleys, along with visionary record executives like Chet Atkins and Don Law, had established Nashville as a major recording center. Later in his career, as subsequent generations of studio players rose to prominence and he worked fewer sessions, Mr. Bradley became active in the Nashville chapter of the American Federation of Musicians. From 1991 to 2008 he was the union’s president. He was also vice president of the international division for more than a decade. Mr. Bradley was elected to the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2006. He was the first instrumentalist without a significant career as a solo artist to be so honored. Harold Ray Bradley was born on Jan. 2, 1926, in Nashville, one of six children. His father, Vernon, was a salesman for Cumberland Tobacco Works for 46 years. His mother, Letha Maie (Owen) Bradley, was a homemaker. Mr. Bradley first learned to play the tenor banjo, but he switched his focus to guitar after his brother Owen observed that guitarists were in greater demand than banjo players. At 17 he became lead guitarist in Ernest Tubb’s band, the Texas Troubadours. After serving in the Navy from 1944 to 1946, he returned to Nashville and began playing in his brother’s local dance orchestra, which featured the future pop stars Snooky Lanson and Kitty Kallen as vocalists. Mr. Bradley worked his first studio session in Chicago in 1946, recording with the Grand Ole Opry star Pee Wee King and his Golden West Boys. He did not make his Nashville session debut until four years later (the city would not emerge as a recording hub until the 1950s), when he played acoustic guitar on Red Foley’s “Chattanoogie Shoe Shine Boy,” a No. 1 country and pop hit. Mr. Bradley also produced numerous television variety shows and movie soundtracks and made a brief appearance in Robert Altman’s acclaimed 1975 film, “Nashville.” In addition to his daughter Beverly, Mr. Bradley is survived by his wife of 66 years, Eleanor Allen Bradley; another daughter, Bari Bradley Brooks; and two grandchildren. Although he released three instrumental albums under his own name, Mr. Bradley regarded himself primarily as a contributor to the work of others. “We had a setup,” he said, reflecting modestly on his decades as a session musician in Nashville in 2013. “We would work from 10 to 1, 2 to 5, 6 to 9 and 10 to 1 at night,” he continued. “To me, it was like going to a party. A Brenda Lee party in the morning, then a Ray Stevens party in the afternoon. A Bill Monroe party and then end up with Henry Mancini and Patsy Cline and Elvis and just other people. I was just glad to be on board.” "

The position was vacant since the unexpected death in 2017 of Geri Allen, a groundbreaking pianist and esteemed educator. In succeeding Allen, Ms. Mitchell takes up the William S. Dietrich II Endowed Chair in Jazz Studies, a new position. She will be a tenured professor in the music department. Though she is leaving a professorship at the University of California, Irvine, Ms. Mitchell received most of her training not through academia but amid the outsider-run creative economy of Chicago’s improvised music scene. Ms. Mitchell’s work — particularly with her two-decade-old Black Earth Ensemble — often brings together instruments and musicians from across the globe to create a sound that’s as rooted as it is futuristic. In its simultaneous celebration of collectivity and compositional vision, it represents an extension of precepts espoused by the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians. Ten years ago, Ms. Mitchell became the first female chair of that South Side-based collective, which has a 54-year history of activism, education and vanguard composing. [Check out our Culture Calendar here.] At Pittsburgh, she joins one of the nation’s oldest and most robust jazz studies programs. In a sense, her arrival only continues a trajectory: The program was founded in 1969 by the saxophonist Nathan Davis, who aimed to help jazz define its place in academia without sacrificing a core Afrocentric ethic. Allen followed in that path, while integrating her own experiences on the experimental wing of New York’s jazz scene. In addition to a doctoral program in jazz, Ms. Mitchell will be in charge of the University of Pittsburgh-Sonny Rollins International Jazz Archives and an annual symposium, the Pitt Jazz Seminar and Concert.

Cox, said in a statement. Mr. Abraham-Joseph is an “unlawfully present United Kingdom national” who legally entered the United States in 2005 but was supposed to leave the next year, according to the terms of his nonimmigrant visa, Mr. Cox said. [Is 21 Savage American? Our music critic weighs in.] In addition to being in the country unlawfully after 2006, Mr. Abraham-Joseph was convicted of felony drug charges in 2014 in Fulton County, Ga., the statement said. Mr. Abraham-Joseph faces deportation proceedings and was expected to appear before a federal immigration judge. “We are working diligently to get Mr. Abraham-Joseph out of detention while we work with the authorities to clear up any misunderstandings,” Dina LaPolt, Mr. Abraham-Joseph’s lawyer, said in a statement on Sunday night. In a statement on Monday, representatives of Mr. Abraham-Joseph said that he “has never hid his immigration status from the US government.” “As a minor, his family overstayed their work visas,” the statement said, and Mr. Abraham-Joseph “was left without legal status through no fault of his own.” His arrest came after he performed at the Super Bowl Music Fest at the State Farm Arena on Thursday. Mr. Abraham-Joseph has been nominated for a Grammy for Record of the Year for “Rockstar,” a song with the rapper Post Malone. Mr. Abraham-Joseph’s album “I Am > I Was” opened at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in January. He is known for his flat delivery and subdued rap style. Mr. Abraham-Joseph has long maintained that he was from Atlanta. In August, he gave backpacks and games to children in Atlanta during an annual drive called Issa Back 2 School Drive. “Mr. Abraham-Joseph is a role model to the young people in this country, especially in Atlanta,” Ms. LaPolt said. She added that Mr. Abraham-Joseph was “actively working in the community leading programs to help underprivileged youths in financial literacy.” In a 2016 interview with VladTV, an urban news YouTube channel, Mr. Abraham-Joseph was asked where he grew up and he listed all the neighborhoods in Atlanta he had previously lived in. “I grew up on the East Side, Glenwood, Decatur,” Mr. Abraham-Joseph says. “I done grew up in all Atlanta really, everybody know me.

5c6ed4303a125f5075c0ad38,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/arts/music/sammy-davis-jr-documentary-concert.html,"How many people does it take to summon the multiple talents, decades-spanning career and complicated life of Sammy Davis Jr.? Laurence Maslon, who wrote the 2017 documentary “Sammy Davis, Jr: I’ve Gotta Be Me,” which had its premiere on PBS’s “American Masters” this week, remembered coming across a 1968 Mad Magazine satire on racial stereotypes that said three black individuals could equal an “emerging African nation” — but it would take four to represent Davis alone. Maslon, now the artistic director and writer of “Yes I Can: The Sammy Davis Jr. Songbook,” running Feb. 23-25 at the 92nd Street Y as part of its “Lyrics & Lyricists” series, mentioned this to the show’s director, Tazewell Thompson, during a rehearsal break last weekend. Thompson ventured, “It would take at least four people — or 14, or 40” to match Davis, who died in 1990 at 64, of throat cancer. For “Yes I Can,” Maslon and Thompson settled for three: Jared Grimes, who dances and choreographs Davis’s steps, and also sings; Max Kumangai, who conjures Davis’s vocal skills and dances; and Harriett D. Foy, a woman, cast as the “more mature, soulful” Davis, as Maslon put it, noting, “There was something androgynous about Sammy.” Matthew Saldivar plays mentor figures (Frank Sinatra, Steve Lawrence and Eddie Cantor); Betsy Wolfe juggles Davis’s female muses (the Broadway stars Janis Paige and Paula Wayne and Davis’s wife, May Britt). Once rehearsal resumed, the cast ran through part of the prologue, in which Davis describes the exhausting toll of his Broadway appearance in “Golden Boy,” a musical adaptation of the Clifford Odets play that cast him as a black boxer who falls in love with a white woman. “Can I be what I wanna be?” Foy rapped, to which Wolfe and Saldivar responded, chanting, “Yes you can!” In truth, success and self-actualization did not come easily to Davis, who started out as a prodigy in vaudeville. For many below a certain age, he’s remembered as a bejeweled fixture on variety and talk shows, or as the one black member of Sinatra’s Rat Pack — and as such the butt of jokes that would start an instant firestorm on social media today. But in addition to the many hats he juggled as an entertainer — song and dance man, actor, impressionist, raconteur — Davis became a civil rights activist. He befriended Martin Luther King Jr. and took part in the 1963 March on Washington and the “Stars for Freedom” rally during the 1965 march from Selma to Montgomery — even if some of Davis’s later actions, like expressing support for President Nixon or performing for troops in Vietnam, stumped younger, more progressive admirers. Maslon conceived “Yes I Can” — the title of Davis’s 1965 autobiography, and of a song cut from “Golden Boy” — as a companion piece to the documentary. “Because we covered so much of his life and the political stuff, the performance aspect got a little attenuated,” he said. “This show is mostly a celebration of his life through song.” The car accident that cost Davis an eye, and informed his conversion to Judaism, is not addressed in the 92nd Street Y show, for instance. “Because it was through song that Sammy expressed himself, really,” Maslon added. Thompson recalled gaining affection for Davis while in high school, living with his grandmother. “I remember her saying that Sammy Davis Jr. and Mickey Rooney were the two performers who could do anything,” he said. “But she said Mickey was the one who got all the breaks; Sammy had to keep proving himself and struggling. That’s why she forgave him when he hugged Nixon. She understood. She said, ‘The man just wants to be accepted.’” Grimes, at 35 a millennial who grew up watching Davis in old movies and performance clips, has a similar perspective. “I had an extensive conversation with Wynton Marsalis years ago, and until then I didn’t know how tough or complex Sammy’s journey was,” he said. “There were people who wanted him to fight and people who wanted him to make or at least seek peace. And he desperately wanted to please everybody.” Thompson figured: “The timing of his life was off. If Sammy were alive today, he would be the greatest star in the world — we would have caught up with him.” He didn’t, Maslon said, “live long enough to do a ‘Duets’ album like Sinatra or Tony Bennett, or sing with Lady Gaga. Would Sammy Davis be doing a duet with Cardi B if he were alive today? I think he would.” "
5c3709963a125f5075c03af8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/10/movies/female-film-composers.html,"Composers have been hired for two forthcoming blockbusters about warrior women — “Wonder Woman 1984,” directed and co-written by Patty Jenkins, and “Mulan,” directed by Niki Caro from a screenplay by three women. The composers: Hans Zimmer and Harry Gregson-Williams. Both, plainly, dudes. More than just a missed opportunity to lend flinty female heroes a female musical voice, the announcements were simply the latest examples of women being sorely unheard in film music. A 2018 study by the University of Southern California revealed that for the top 100 fictional films at the box office every year from 2007 to 2017, only 16 female composers were hired, compared with more than 1,200 men. Another report, from the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film, showed that of the top 250 films at the domestic box office in 2018, 94 percent were scored by men. “The numbers are bleak, but the landscape isn’t,” said Laura Karpman, a veteran film composer (“Paris Can Wait”) and a governor in the music branch of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. “People are reaching out in a way that I’ve never seen it my whole career.” Karpman was instrumental in expanding the diversity of her branch’s membership, which now includes the Russian composer Sofia Gubaidulina. Karpman also spearheaded the creation of a shortlist in the score category of the Academy Awards. “Had we had a voted-upon shortlist last year, I think we would have more diversity,” she said. Citing the composers behind “Get Out” and “Mudbound,” she added, “I want to see Michael Abels and Tamar-kali on Oscar shortlists.” (Karpman spoke before the shortlist was announced in December. It includes Terence Blanchard’s score for “BlacKkKlansman” — his first Oscar nomination if he moves to the next round — but, alas, no women.) Tamar-kali is one of several new voices in a persistently white male milieu. “Mudbound,” directed by Dee Rees, was the Brooklyn artist’s first score, which she followed with the Netflix drama “Come Sunday.” She’s also reteaming with Rees for an adaptation of the Joan Didion novel “The Last Thing He Wanted.” As an Afro-indigenous woman in the New York punk rock scene, she said, she was already used to being “an outlier within the outliers.” “It just kind of fuels your creativity,” she explained. “The ethos means even more to you, because you’re practicing it every moment — even in the pit, even at shows.” Like a handful of other female artists, Tamar-kali wasn’t pursuing film composition, but was commissioned after a director heard her work. Mica Levi, a British rocker from the band formerly known as Micachu and the Shapes, was nominated for an Oscar for “Jackie,” which followed her shivering, queasy breakout score for “Under the Skin.” The Icelandic cellist-composer Hildur Gudnadottir was hired for “Sicario: Day of the Soldado” and the forthcoming “Joker,” starring Joaquin Phoenix — two patently “macho,” big-budget features — largely because of her experimental electronic solo work. “People approach me looking for a specific type of sound, or feeling,” Gudnadottir said. “They don’t come knocking on my door for, like, a John Williams score. So that also puts me in a really good position, because I’m normally allowed to be myself.” “Joker” bucks the trend of high-profile superhero films going solely to male composers, as does the coming “Captain Marvel,” starring Brie Larson. Pinar Toprak, a Turkish composer who wrote additional music for Danny Elfman on last year’s “Justice League,” is the first woman to score a Marvel film. “Music, and art in general, it’s genderless,” Toprak told me in April, “because emotions are genderless.” One of the few women who scored a major studio film in 2018 was Germaine Franco, with the R-rated bro comedy “Tag.” After assisting the Oscar-nominated John Powell for years, the Mexican-American composer drew attention for giving “Coco” much of its musical personality — she orchestrated Michael Giacchino’s score and wrote several of its songs, although she was not asked to compose the score. She’s currently working on the Tina Gordon Chism comedy, “Little,” starring Marsai Martin of “black-ish.” All of this raises the question of why most studio features — even female-centric no-brainers like the “Ghostbusters” reboot and “Ocean’s 8” — still go to men. The history of women scoring films isn’t long. The pioneer was probably Germaine Tailleferre, a French composer who co-scored a travelogue in 1926. Thirty years later, the American Bebe Barron created the avant-garde electronic sound for “Forbidden Planet” with her husband, Louis. Wendy Carlos’s seminal synthesizer album “Switched-On Bach” led to her collaborations with Stanley Kubrick on “A Clockwork Orange” and “The Shining.” Angela Morley was an Oscar-nominated composer whose credits included the 1978 animated feature “Watership Down” and the TV series “Dynasty” and “Dallas.” Shirley Walker was a pianist who helped Carmine Coppola realize his score for “Apocalypse Now,” and went on to shape scores by Elfman and Zimmer in the 1980s and ’90s as an in-demand orchestrator. Both men, classically untrained, credit her as a teacher. Walker, who died in 2006, also composed her own scores, notably “Batman: The Animated Series,” the “Final Destination” movies and the 2003 horror film “Willard.” Yet she could never break into the top-tier movies she was helping men with. “I don’t think she got in the door for the same meetings that the guys would get,” said Lolita Ritmanis, a composer who was mentored by Walker. “I wouldn’t say she was bitter. She was a fighter till the end.” The first woman to win an Oscar for best score was Rachel Portman, for “Emma” in 1996. (The only other woman to win that prize is Anne Dudley, for “The Full Monty” the next year.) The film industry, Portman said, “tends to be quite cautious.” She added that directors feel more comfortable with composers who have “done something really similar-sounding before — which immediately makes it very difficult to break in. And also this feeling that there’s safety if someone else has hired someone before, which I think is particularly hard for women.” She said she had worked with only two openly misogynistic directors, and noted the occasional “delicious challenge” of a filmmaker presuming she’s not capable of writing “tough music” — that is, for action scenes or anything in a mode not stereotypically feminine. “I’m like, are you kidding? And I’ll just prove to them that I can.” The women interviewed for this article offered a variety of reasons for the longstanding inequality: institutionalized sexism; a lack of precedents and female role models to inspire girls to go into the field; and the social conditioning of women to be selfless caretakers and not seize the spotlight. Increasingly, women are entering the profession, but are still outnumbered by men. The film scoring certificate program at the University of California, Los Angeles has produced 120 graduates since 2013, of which only 25 percent were female. Likewise, only a quarter of applicants to the film scoring graduate program at U.S.C. this year were female — although the school invited seven women to join its 20-student program. (Portman suggested that universities pumping so many aspiring composers into such a small competitive field might itself be a problem.) Several workshops — including the Sundance Institute Film Music Program, which has achieved gender parity the past two years, and the Ascap Film Scoring Workshop — are trying to provide more women with real-world experience and access to the industry. Universal Pictures started its Film Music Composer Initiative to find talented women and people of color. Winning candidates are writing orchestral scores — and running recording sessions at Abbey Road — for shorts created by DreamWorks Animation. Nora Kroll-Rosenbaum scored the program’s first short, “Bird Karma.” She praised the initiative for providing opportunities, adding, “That door has been very much shut for a lot of people.” There are also new resources for support. The Alliance for Women Film Composers was founded in 2014, and now has close to 400 members. It has raised the visibility of women through concerts and advocacy work, and provides solidarity in a lonely profession with no formal union. “It’s a sisterhood, it’s a resource,” said Ritmanis, president of the alliance. “And although we are very much competitors, we are also each others’ cheerleaders.” “I think because of the global awareness of women’s rights, and #MeToo, and Time’s Up and all these different movements,” she added, “there is an interest and a call to action” among studios and decision makers. “People call me wanting to meet and figure out what they can do, and I do think that there’s a lot more opportunity for women to be part of the big audition process” for major feature assignments. As there should be, given their talent, said Doreen Ringer-Ross, an executive in the film music division of Broadcast Music Inc., the performing rights organization which manages the catalogs of many of Hollywood’s top composers. “The job of a composer is to be really sensitive, is to interpret the emotion of things, musically,” she said. “And women are traditionally great at doing that.” Still, emerging composers face a double standard. Jesi Nelson has been apprenticing with several male composers as she develops her own career, and she’s dealt with potential bosses commenting about her legs or musicians assuming that she’s somebody’s personal assistant when she’s actually running a recording session. “I do get angry, and sometimes I’m just like, what’s the point?” Nelson said. “If I’m working these ridiculous hours — seven days a week, 18-hour days — and it’s paying off for somebody to diminish everything that I’ve worked hard for in a few words based on my gender, like, why am I even doing this? But I love it way too much, so I won’t stop.” "

5c9125d049f0eacbf105de3e,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/19/arts/music/met-opera-wagner-ring-walkure-lepage.html,"We tend to think about Wagner’s “Ring” as an epic saga of bitter rivalries, fearless heroes and flying horses. But at the core of “Die Walküre,” the second of the four “Ring” operas, is something far more intimate: one of the most profound depictions of a father-daughter relationship in all the arts. The complex feelings between the brooding god Wotan and his favorite daughter, the feisty Valkyrie warrior Brünnhilde, come to a head during an intimate scene in Act II, when, in a rare moment of vulnerability, Wotan confesses what a mess he’s made of things. [Read about the triumph of Christine Goerke, the Met’s Brünnhilde.] The director Robert Lepage bungles this poignant scene in his production for the Metropolitan Opera, which returns on Monday. His staging makes me realize what I still miss about Otto Schenk’s production, which the Met retired 10 years ago. Mr. Schenk’s traditional approach, which presents the “Ring” as a storybook tale of gods, giants and dwarfs, had its limitations. But he was keenly sensitive to the relationships between Wagner’s characters, and his staging of this confessional moment is a high point. Long known as Wotan’s Narrative, this scene can seem like a dead spot: nearly 20 minutes of talk, talk, talk. In fact, it’s the heart of the entire cycle. As Wotan tells Brünnhilde the whole sorry story of how he came to this crisis point, the music unfolds slowly, quietly, almost statically. Many of Wotan’s halting vocal lines should sound like he’s almost muttering. In the Schenk “Walküre” — available on DVD and the Met Opera On Demand, conducted by James Levine and starring James Morris as Wotan and Hildegard Behrens as Brünnhilde — Wotan seems at first to be speaking to himself. Brünnhilde, who has never seen her father like this, warily approaches to ask what’s wrong. This anguished Wotan hesitates. If he voices his thoughts out loud, he says, will he lose grip on his own will? Brünnhilde tenderly replies that when he talks to her, he is “speaking to his will.” So he opens up, admitting to his greed for power; to violating the treaties he had pledged to uphold; to confiscating a magic ring from the Nibelung dwarf Alberich. Mr. Schenk’s staging could not be simpler: Wotan just sits on a rock, Brünnhilde next to him, sometimes resting her head on his knee, looking at her father with unblinking attentiveness, seemingly gripped by every word. It’s clear from the staging that what’s really transfixing Brünnhilde — more than the tangled story Wotan tells — is the fact that her father is opening up at all. Suddenly, this goddess seems like any devoted daughter of a powerful, emotionally walled-off father, finally confessing everything. And to her! The narrative comes to a crucial turn when Wotan explains how his hunger for knowledge drove him to follow the earth goddess Erda to her realm — where, in time, he says, the world’s “wisest woman” gave birth “to you, Brünnhilde.” In Mr. Schenk’s staging, Mr. Morris’s Wotan melts with fatherly affection and cradles her face in his hands, as Behrens’s Brünnhilde, with radiant eyes and a wistful smile, basks in her father’s love. How does Mr. Lepage present this scene? It starts off promisingly. In the version also available on video, and also conducted by Mr. Levine, a visibly rattled Wotan (Bryn Terfel) frets that he is the least free of all men. Brünnhilde (Deborah Voigt) looks both concerned and scared. But as the narrative begins, this Wotan walks up the raked planks of the production’s massive set and assumes a lordly stance, looking past Brünnhilde, who stands meekly below. So father and daughter are kept apart during what is supposed to be their moment of closest bonding. Suddenly, a circle of light rises from the ground in front of Brünnhilde. The image morphs into a huge eye. Brünnhilde, now sitting on the ground, begins to watch what is, in effect, a greatest-hits animated video projection of the story Wotan relates. When he talks of the giants who built the castle Valhalla, we see circles of color to suggest its rainbow bridge. When he speaks of Erda, a ghostly image of her comes into view. And when Wotan says that Erda conceived a child, this Brünnhilde is shown what looks like a sonogram image of her embryonic self. Rather than basking in her father’s love, Ms. Voigt’s Brünnhilde, looking nervous and confused, turns her face away from him. The overly obvious animated images are bad enough. What’s worse is that, by fixating with such preposterous exactitude on the details of Wotan’s story, Mr. Lepage distracts us from caring about what Wagner is really depicting: a proud but failing father who, with no one else he can trust, confides in his daughter. With Mr. Schenk’s staging, a newcomer to “Die Walküre” watching this father-daughter moment from a balcony seat at the Met may well have found it ponderous: two singers, sitting on a rock, during a long stretch of very slow music. But consummate artists like Behrens and Mr. Morris, working with a skilled director, trusted, rightly, that this restraint and subtlety would lend emotional richness and honesty to the scene. And emotional richness is just what Mr. Lepage’s production too often lacks. "
5c85456d49f0eacbf105c501,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/10/arts/music/review-met-opera-wagner-ring-rheingold-lepage.html,"The Machine is back. But does it still creak? This question loomed over the return, on Saturday afternoon, of Robert Lepage’s production of Wagner’s “Das Rheingold” to the Metropolitan Opera after a six-year absence. Mr. Lepage’s ambitious staging of Wagner’s four-opera “Ring” cycle relies on a massive, complex set: 24 planks that rotate like seesaws on an axis that can rise and fall. This 44-ton “Machine,” as it became widely known, was prone to glitches on a Wagnerian scale, starting when “Das Rheingold,” the first installment, was introduced in 2010. The planks can be twisted into sculptural set pieces and bathed in intricate video imagery. Debate among Wagner lovers over the Lepage “Ring” was heated from the start. But there was one thing everyone agreed on: The Machine too often squeaked and groaned when it kicked into action. After a major retooling, it has been tamed — well, mostly. There were occasional creaking sounds on Saturday. But things seemed to work smoothly. Those who were captivated by the staging years ago will be pleased to see the three mermaidlike Rhinemaidens, suspended from wires, seeming to cavort in the actual waters of the river, video-projection oxygen bubbles floating from their mouths to the surface, and pebbles on the riverbed rustling to their touch. We get an aerial view of the god Wotan and his trickster ally Loge walking sideways on a grand staircase down to the realm of Nibelheim in search of the dwarf Alberich. But for me, the noises and the glitches were never the real problem with this production. My main issue was that Mr. Lepage seemed to have scant interpretive insight into a work that, since its 1876 premiere, has been seized upon by generation after generation as an allegory about roiling issues of the time: a Marxist narrative of class struggle; a cautionary tale about the corrupting influence of power; a warning about environmental destruction; an absurdist reflection of nihilistic leadership. There’s certainly much in our world with which the “Ring” resonates. But if Mr. Lepage has ideas about the relevance of the cycle today — or even about who Wagner’s characters are and how they relate to each other — little of that comes through. Even though the set seemed to be working, the cast is clearly distracted by the physical demands of the production. It was hard not to fear for the feisty tenor Norbert Ernst, making his Met debut as Loge, when he had to walk backward up steep planks to report on the approach of the two giants. Why backward? Well, the wire securing him was attached to his back. There was no way Mr. Ernst could make this moment look natural. The good news is the eloquent and urgent performance of Wagner’s score that the conductor Philippe Jordan drew from the orchestra. Back at the Met for the first time since 2007, Mr. Jordan, 44, currently the music director of the Paris Opera, will assume the directorship of the Vienna State Opera in 2020. I hope this busy conductor can make time to appear at the Met in the future. He led a refreshingly lithe and transparent account of “Rheingold,” keeping things fleet and colorful during playful stretches, but drawing out dark, heaving undercurrents when the music turned ominous. There were a few too many passing fumbles in the brasses to ignore. Still, Wagner’s two-and-a-half-hour score seemed to flow right by. The standout member of the cast was Tomasz Konieczny, a powerhouse bass, in a breakthrough Met debut as Alberich. I tend to prefer portrayals that bring out Alberich’s suffering and bitterness; with a big, penetrating voice that can slice through the orchestra, Mr. Konieczny made Alberich sneering and dangerous. Once he steals the gold, forges the magic ring and becomes the gods’ powerful nemesis, this Alberich dominated the rest of the opera, rather than, as usual, a stentorian Wotan. In that role, the bass-baritone Greer Grimsley was solid, but for whole stretches his voice was leathery and dry. He came across as the suffering one, a god who already feared his time had come and gone. He seemed outmatched by this Alberich, with a breast-plated costume, looking like a kitschy reject from “Game of Thrones,” that didn’t lend him dignity. As Fricka, Wotan’s wife, the mezzo-soprano Jamie Barton seemed to be holding back some of the natural power in her voice. The result, though, was an unusually lustrous-toned and feminine Fricka. The soprano Wendy Bryn Harmer brought gleaming sound and intensity to the frantic goddess Freia, whom Wotan glibly promises to the giants Fasolt and Fafner (Günther Groissböck and Dmitry Belosselskiy, both excellent) as payment for building his castle in the sky. The rich-toned mezzo-soprano Karen Cargill, as the all-knowing earth goddess Erda; the reedy tenor Gerhard Siegel, as Mime, mercilessly bullied by his brother Alberich; Adam Diegel and Michael Todd Simpson, as the gods Froh and Donner; Amanda Woodbury, Samantha Hankey and Tamara Mumford, as the three Rhinemaidens: All sang strongly. But the singers never came together as a cast and seemed too often stranded on their own, a continuing shortcoming of this production. During the ovation at the end, the backstage crew came onstage to share in the applause. It was a generous gesture. They are the real heroes of Mr. Lepage’s “Ring.” "

Kelly, the R&B singer who has long been accused of sexual misconduct and preying on teenagers, after the broadcast of an explosive investigative documentary detailing the allegations against him. In a post across her social media channels just after midnight on Thursday, Lady Gaga said she was sorry for making the song “Do What U Want” with Kelly in 2013 and pledged to remove the track from iTunes and other streaming platforms. “I’m sorry, both for my poor judgment when I was young and for not speaking out sooner,” she wrote, citing her own trauma from being sexually assaulted. “My intention was to create something extremely defiant and provocative because I was angry and still hadn’t processed the trauma that had occurred in my own life.” Lady Gaga, along with artists like Jay-Z and Chance the Rapper, has for years faced criticism for collaborating with Kelly, with scrutiny intensifying again as a result of the documentary, “Surviving R. Kelly,” which aired on Lifetime. (Kelly has continuously denied the allegations against him.) [Read more about the decades of sexual abuse allegations detailed in the documentary.] “Do What U Want” was controversial when it debuted, with many fans rejecting the collaboration based on much earlier reports about Kelly’s behavior with women. The single’s music video, which was never released, was shot and directed by the photographer Terry Richardson, who has also faced repeated accusations of sexual misconduct. Lady Gaga previously defended the song, calling it a “natural collaboration.” At a 2013 news conference, she said, “R. Kelly and I have sometimes very untrue things written about us, so in a way this was a bond between us.” Following the airing of the Lifetime series, Chance the Rapper apologized “to all of his survivors for working with him and for taking this long to speak out.” He added: “The truth is any of us who ever ignored the R. Kelly stories, or ever believed he was being setup/attacked by the system (as black men often are) were doing so at the detriment of black women and girls.” [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] Representatives for Jay-Z, who released collaborative albums with Kelly in 2002 and 2004, have declined to comment. Sony Music, which oversees Kelly’s record label, RCA, has also declined to comment on the allegations. In her post, Lady Gaga wrote: “I stand behind these women 1000 percent, believe them, know they are suffering and in pain, and feel strongly that their voices should be heard and taken seriously.” The singer has previously spoken out about her own sexual assault at age 19. In 2015, she released “Til It Happens to You,” a ballad about sexual assault for the documentary “The Hunting Ground,” which examined the issue of campus rape. “If I could go back and have a talk with my younger self,” Lady Gaga added in her apology, “I’d tell her to go through the therapy I have since then, so that I could understand the confused post-traumatic state that I was in.” “Surviving R. Kelly,” which aired in six parts last week, covered the long history of allegations against Kelly and featured women who described being controlled or abused by him, often when they were teenagers. “I wish that he would experience a kind of social death, and that people who still vociferously declare him innocent — or their favorite artist, or worthy of having his work separated from who he is — that they are denied that,” said dream hampton, an executive producer of the documentary. Prosecutors in Chicago and Atlanta are now looking into the allegations against him, and have called for potential witnesses and victims to come forward. [Laughing at R. Kelly helped us ignore the charges against him. No longer, a Times culture critic writes.] In 1994, when Kelly was 27, he married the singer Aaliyah Haughton, who was 15 but was listed as 18 on a wedding certificate, according to Vibe Magazine. The marriage was annulled in 1995. Ms. Haughton died in a plane crash in 2001. Kelly was also accused of having sex with a teenager in a lawsuit in 1996, and again in 2001. Both lawsuits were settled, but the journalist Jim DeRogatis, who reported on them, continued to investigate the accusations against Kelly. In 2002, a video that appeared to show Kelly having sex with a teenage girl and urinating in her mouth was sent to Mr. DeRogatis at The Chicago Sun-Times, which reported that the footage was being investigated by the Chicago police. Later that year, Kelly was indicted by a grand jury in Chicago for child pornography. In the more than five years it took for his case to go to trial, he continued to release popular music, including the chart-topping song “Ignition (Remix).” He was found not guilty. "

He was a former high school math teacher who was unerringly precise about his laboratory values. He also had a spark to him that no cancer could extinguish. Over the years, we had tried a variety of therapies to treat him, some of which worked for a while, some not at all. After our most recent failed attempt to solve the complicated equation of his disease, he had said enough was enough, and asked to be placed on hospice at the nursing facility where he now resided. Fortunately for him, it was one of the few hospice programs that allowed him to continue seeing me to receive the regular blood transfusions that corrected the anemia brought on by his cancer, which eased his fatigue and made him feel more like himself. When I entered the examination room, he was wearing an outfit typical of what he sported to many of our visits: a red and yellow tattersall shirt; chinos with a broken button, held closed with a black belt; red Ohio State socks; and tan moccasins. His face was framed by square, dark brown glasses that gave him an air of being more serious than he frequently was. His son sat by his side. “I’m honored to be in the presence of such musical greatness!” I joked with my patient. “I should have brought a Sharpie marker with me to get your autograph.” He smiled and his son started to chuckle. My patient had just sung in a concert at the hospital near his nursing facility, showcasing performances by him and six other patients. He had been participating in a music therapy program for over a year. I am a firm believer in the ability of music to help people express their emotions, hopes and fears, making their medical conditions more tolerable. In one study, patients undergoing a bone-marrow transplant were randomized to participate in a music therapy program or receive standard medical care. Those who received music therapy needed fewer narcotic pain medications than those receiving the usual care. “Were you able to see a video of the show?” his son asked as he brought out his phone. I shook my head, and he scrolled through his files until he found the one he was looking for and pressed play. On the screen, my patient sat tall in a black wheelchair with a high back, wearing a blue dress shirt and bow tie. A microphone hovered in front of him, and a music therapist strummed a guitar softly by his side. He started in on “Sentimental Journey,” the song originally sung by Doris Day with Les Brown and His Band of Renown in the mid-1940s, when my patient was entering his teenage years. Gonna take a sentimental journey Gonna set my heart at ease  Gonna make a sentimental journey  To renew old memories … His voice started out a bit tremulous and unsure, but gathered strength as the song progressed, with some vibrato and huskiness adding depth to the words, as if he were living them in real time. “You sound incredible,” I told him. His eyes danced with delight. “You must have done this before.” “Only in a church choir,” he said. “And in a men’s quartet for a bit when I was younger. But never on my own for an audience.” “Did your family attend the show?” “Oh, they all came. My wife, children and my granddaughter. One son drove all the way from Illinois, he couldn’t believe his dad was actually going to do this.” “How long did it take you to practice?” I asked. “About two months,” his son answered. “The music therapist joined me while I was getting transfusions,” my patient added. I considered the many hours he spent regularly in an infusion chair as the blood slowly dripped in, time now well spent. Never thought my heart could be so yearny  Why did I decide to roam?  Gotta take that sentimental journey  Sentimental journey home. The three of us sat in silence when the song ended, thinking about the end of his journey, his journey home. “All of the care you’ve given me came out in that solo,” he said, his eyes now glistening. “Today, you’re the one who’s cared for me,” I said, shaking my head, as I considered how this man I’ve known for years had just sung his goodbye to all of us.

5c643f173a125f5075c097da,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/13/arts/supremes-photos-motown-grosse-pointe.html,"It’s a vision of two Detroits that have mostly faded now — the social set born of the American auto industry’s vast wealth and the galvanizing magic of ’60s Motown — together in a room. In June 1965, the Supremes, one of America’s biggest and most glamorous groups, performed at a debutante party at the Country Club of Detroit in Grosse Pointe, Mich., the posh all-white enclave just northeast of the city. It was the debutante party of Christy Cole Wilson, and The New York Times pictures of the event tell a layered story of two groups connected, at least for the evening, by the music of that time and place.  The three elegant darlings of Detroit, led by the 21-year-old Diana Ross, serenade a room of finely attired guests, many of practically the same age. But between the groups were also the realities of race and class — the distance between Grosse Pointe and the Brewster projects where the Supremes grew up, 10 miles and several worlds away. The Times covered the lavish event in avid detail. “It took three days, hundreds of fresh blue irises, thousands of little Italian lights and hundreds of thousands of yellow plastic flowers to turn the club into a French garden,” the story enthused. “Whole walls had disappeared behind Austrian silk panels of gold and mirrors before the 750 guests arrived.” Not until the eighth paragraph did the story mention that “when they were not dancing and being entertained by a rock ‘n’ roll group called the Supremes, the Wilsons and their guests were polishing off 20 cases of French champagne, attempting to create a liquor shortage (the plot failed), and heaping their plates with food from an abundantly stocked buffet table.” The trio hardly needed an identifier at that point. Between August 1964 and June 1965, the Supremes had five No. 1 singles, including “Baby Love,” “Stop! In the Name of Love” and “Back in My Arms Again,” which had gone to the top of the charts just six days before this party. Which is exactly why Ms. Wilson’s parents hired them. “Everyone had very glamorous deb parties when I was growing up,” said Ms. Wilson Hofmann, 72, who now lives in Bristol, R.I. Her father, Ralph C. Wilson Jr., a millionaire insurance scion who had “a stable in Lexington, Ky., and the Buffalo Bills football team,” seemed happy to toast his daughter in such style. The event reportedly cost $85,000, which would be roughly $675,000 today. (This was just the hometown event; the 18-year-old Ms. Wilson had already been formally presented at the Debutante Cotillion and Christmas Ball in New York in December 1964.) It was an era when families of distinction across the country presented their daughters to society, with the intention that suitable men from similar backgrounds would meet their future wives. In Grosse Pointe, it was the “Ford girls,” the great-granddaughters of Henry Ford, who had ramped up the deb-ball arms race. Nat King Cole sang at Charlotte Ford’s storied party in 1959, while Ella Fitzgerald performed at her sister Anne’s soiree in 1961. Racial dynamics were changing in the 1960s, but often in fits and starts. The Supremes performing at a private club in Grosse Pointe, which still had no black residents, reflected this lurching progress.  “Music filtered in,” said Izzy Donnelly, the director of education at the Grosse Pointe Historical Society. “The ’60s were about breaking tradition. Bringing black entertainers to debutante balls and private clubs was putting a big foot in the front door.” It wasn’t an intentional political statement to hire the Supremes to perform at her party, Ms. Wilson Hofmann said. She chose them because she loved their music, and she was from a family that could make her request happen. “I grew up in Grosse Pointe and loved the Supremes and that kind of music, like the Temptations and Marvin Gaye,” said Ms. Wilson Hofmann. “They were extraordinarily popular with white audiences, black audiences and everyone else,” said Dolores Barclay, an author and adjunct professor at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, who collaborated with Diana Ross on the singer’s memoir. “Appearing in white venues was breaking down racial barriers. But it’s a different type of disruption. It’s nonconfrontational. It’s having a platform and saying, ‘Yes, we’re here, we’re great and we’re a part of American music.’” The Supremes were homegrown celebrities in Detroit and received star treatment, but there were black entertainers across the country still entering clubs and performance halls through the kitchen. “Anything in the South was still tenuous,” said Coraleen Rawls, collections manager at the Motown Museum in Detroit. “On one hand, we had artists who were happy to perform because that’s their passion and vocation. But it was also disheartening to be international stars and still be treated differently.” Just two years after Ms. Wilson’s debut, Detroit would experience the devastating unrest of 1967, as the city’s racial and economic disparities exploded into national awareness. And the Motown sound would prove to be a powerful force in the healing process. “It unified people and brought us all together,” Ms. Rawls said. “Where there were ropes between whites and blacks, those ropes started disappearing, as the people on both sides were like, ‘We’re all dancing. Why do we have to have a rope in the middle? You’re dancing, I’m dancing. We’re singing, you’re singing, so why do we have to be separated by some rope because of some thoughts prior to our generation as to how you think we should be?’” The year after the Supremes played Ms. Wilson’s party, the first black family moved to Grosse Pointe, and by 1974, The Times reported that three African-American families called the town home. In 2019, Grosse Pointe Farms, where the Country Club of Detroit is, remains 94 percent white, while the city of Detroit is 79 percent black. The deb parties continued in Grosse Pointe, albeit in a scaled-back fashion. In 1970, The Times covered the celebration for Sheila Ford, another heir of the automobile family. She opted for a short purple dress instead of traditional formal attire, and hired the group Sha-Na-Na, who “played what the listeners called real modern blues music.” "

The final section of this “recitative and air,” as Thomson called it, is like a nonsensical yet glorious religious proclamation: “Foundationally marvelously aboundingly illimitably with it as a circumstance.” Sandy — everyone who worked with him knew this most principled, compelling and collegial singer, who died last week at 65, as Sandy — sang it just that way, lifting the words with robust sound and elation. After one run-through, during the final phrase, “Fundamentally and saints,” Sandy plunged down the scale to end on a sustained, hearty low C. For a moment he was quiet. Then he said something curious: “And people say I don’t have low notes,” speaking as much to himself as to me. Perhaps Sandy had gotten tired of hearing his eloquent lightness and clarity in the upper range praised. He was also commanding, both in voice and stage presence, and could summon bass power when called for, as he did that afternoon. We were preparing “Pigeons,” for baritone and piano, for an album of Thomson vocal works, most of them little-known, that I was making for Northeastern Records with an excellent group of Boston-area singers. I listened to it again last week following the news of his death. I didn’t know Sandy that well. We’d fallen out of touch in recent years. Yet making music together fosters a lasting intimacy between people. My first strong impression of him was in the title role of Handel’s “Orlando” at the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge in 1982, a pioneering Peter Sellars production that turned the knight Orlando into an astronaut. I’ll never forget his chillingly clear performance of the scene when romantic frustration drives Orlando to a harrowing mental breakdown. And I saw him in other landmark Sellars stagings: Mozart’s “Le Nozze di Figaro,” set in Trump Tower in New York, and “Così Fan Tutte,” moved to a roadside diner. Sandy once told me that he felt “born to do” this kind of opera, to take part in productions that looked deep into standard works to find contemporary resonances. If he never performed at the Metropolitan Opera, he said, so be it. And he never did. What he was doing took courage and mattered just as much as the Met, if not more. Before working together, we had mingled in Boston’s close-knit musical community. He had heard me perform in concerts. Still, I was a little surprised that he jumped at my offer to participate in the Thomson project. One of his assignments was “Capital Capitals,” another Gertrude Stein setting, for four male singers and piano. With some 3,000 words, the text vaguely evokes the French region of Provence — its landscape, food, and customs — in the form of a conversation between four cities: Aix, Arles, Avignon and Les Baux. What drew him to our project? Words. It was always words with Sandy. Whether the texts were somber or fanciful, poignant or impish, words came first. This was clear when he spoke about John Adams’s “The Wound-Dresser,” written for him in 1989. The text is a Walt Whitman poem, a reflection on tending sick and wounded soldiers during the Civil War. “It’s such a privilege to sing those words,” Sandy told me. It seemed revealing that he didn’t say it was a privilege to sing “that piece” or “that music.” He said “those words.” Of course, he meant it was a privilege to sing Whitman’s words as set to music by Mr. Adams, perhaps his most important collaborator; Sandy created the roles of Chou En-lai in “Nixon in China” and the title role in “The Death of Klinghoffer.” But it was communicating the words that came first; after his death, Mr. Adams tellingly paid tribute to the way Sandy “made our American language a thing of beauty whenever he sang it.” As a deeply spiritual person who took periodic sabbaticals to study Judaism and Buddhism, Sandy was touched by the hints of Christian mysticism that seem to run through “Pigeons on the Grass Alas.” Thomson fashioned this concert piece from passages of his opera “Four Saints in Three Acts.” The opera vaguely suggests the life of a group of 16th-century Spanish saints, and all the words for “Pigeons” come from lines that St. Ignatius sings. It begins with a solemn invocation. Over a low, soft D octave in the piano, the baritone sings a long melodic line that keeps leaping up and then descending on the notes of a D major scale, with what might seem baffling words: “A scene and withers,” “Why when in lean fairly rejoin place dismiss calls.” Come again? But Sandy sang it as if it were a truth imparted to him directly from God. After a transitional moment in the piano with soft, hymnlike chords, the lilting main section, almost a gentle dance, begins with a slightly clipped yet tender melody on the words “Pigeons on the grass alas.” Sandy and I had a long discussion about the meaning of the word “alas.” This episode in the opera is Ignatius’s vision of the Holy Ghost. So “alas” doesn’t mean “oh, no” or anything like that, Sandy thought. It’s closer to: “Isn’t that something?” It was that sense of openness and wonder that I’ll always hold dear about him. "
5c3667e23a125f5075c039ad,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/09/obituaries/dennis-johnson-dead.html,"Dennis Johnson, a composer who in 1959 wrote a trailblazing Minimalist work, a six-hour piano meditation of repeated notes and long pauses that went unheard for 50 years before being rediscovered, died on Dec. 20 in Morgan Hill, Calif. He was 80. His half brother, Don Wilson, said the cause was complications of dementia. Until 10 years ago, long after Mr. Johnson had dropped composing for a career as a mathematician, his music was known only by reputation. References to it were found in the writings of the composer La Monte Young, who described Mr. Johnson as one of his closest musical allies when they were students at the University of California, Los Angeles. Mr. Young is a founder of Minimalism, a genre of composition marked by repetition, gradual development and sometimes spare harmonies. Some of the most important contemporary composers, including John Adams, Steve Reich and Philip Glass, are at times associated with the movement or at least have incorporated such elements in their work. Mr. Young is credited with composing the first Minimalist work, his String Trio of 1958, which unfolded so slowly that listeners focused less on its sequence of notes than on its long, sustained tones and glacial pace. A year later, Mr. Johnson produced “November,” his piano work, which also moves glacially, starting with just two notes — a rising minor third — repeated several times before new material is added, in a process that yielded a flow of individual tones, sustained chords and silences. Mr. Johnson described his compositional method in a 2013 interview with the music magazine The Wire: “I would just sit down at the piano and diddle, and listen, and it would slowly grow, like out of a seed,” he said. “Even now, when I do mathematics, it seems to be that way.” Mr. Johnson’s innovations were repetition and generally consonant harmonies. Mr. Young has said that “November” influenced his own six-hour magnum opus, “The Well-Tuned Piano” (1964), considered an early landmark of the genre. But for the next 50 years “November” was virtually unknown. The path to its revival began in 1992, when Mr. Young gave the critic and composer Kyle Gann a cassette tape with a partial performance, by Mr. Johnson, running 112 minutes. Mr. Gann decided to reconstruct the score, using the tape and a handful of pages that Mr. Johnson had sent him detailing many of the work’s motifs as well as performance instructions. Mr. Gann performed a tag-team version of the piece with the pianist Sarah Cahill at the Second International Conference on Minimalist Music, at the University of Missouri, Kansas City, in 2009. That performance led to a 2013 recording by R. Andrew Lee for Irritable Hedgehog, a new-music label. Mr. Gann’s reconstruction has also been recorded by the Dutch pianist Jeroen van Veen. Though the score was unknown to most musicians until the release of Mr. Lee’s recording, its Minimalist qualities — and its influence on Mr. Young — have led to a reconsideration of Minimalism’s early history. Dennis Lee Johnson was born in Los Angeles on Nov. 19, 1938, to Leroy Johnson, a building contractor, and Eloise (Jeffcoat) Johnson, a seamstress. His parents divorced before he was 8, and when his mother remarried, the family moved to Canoga Park, Calif. In addition to Mr. Wilson, his half brother, Mr. Johnson is survived by a half sister, Judy Wilson Plouff. Mr. Johnson’s early talent for mathematics earned him a full scholarship to Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire, where he completed high school. He enrolled as a math student at the California Institute of Technology in 1956. But after a year he became disillusioned, and although he had studied the piano only casually as a child, he decided to transfer to U.C.L.A. to study music. As part of Mr. Young’s iconoclastic circle, Mr. Johnson produced works that were often whimsical, like “Din,” in which 40 musicians screamed, clapped their hands and shuffled their feet in a darkened hall. They could also be conceptual, like a piece that consisted of a card containing only the word “Listen.” He continued performing for several years, both on the piano and on the hichiriki, a Japanese double reed instrument. When Mr. Young moved to New York, in 1960, Mr. Johnson remained at U.C.L.A., shifting his focus to ethnomusicology and, by 1962, to mathematical study. But he visited New York several times from 1960 to 1965, and played the hichiriki in early versions of Mr. Young’s performance group, Theater of Eternal Music. In 1966, Mr. Johnson gave up performing music publicly and began work on his doctorate in math, which he completed two years later. In 1969, he took a two-year position at the Institute of Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J. Beginning in the mid-1970s, he worked for a decade at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, near Pasadena, first as a staff researcher and software developer and then as a consultant. Among his projects at the lab was the radio mapping of Venus — a mathematical reconstruction of the planet’s surface using radar data. He also taught mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley, and continued his own research in advanced algebra and geometry. His 1983 theorem, the Johnson homomorphism, is still studied in the field of geometric topology. After 1995, Mr. Johnson began working with Roger C. Alperin, a professor of mathematics at San Jose State University, on theoretical projects having to do with “understanding the symmetries of curves related to their geometry,” as Dr. Alperin explained it. Mr. Johnson’s final mathematical work, a collaboration with Dr. Alperin, was published in the German journal Beiträge zur Algebra und Geometrie (Contributions to Algebra and Geometry) in January 2016.

5c7815a949f0eacbf105aaf6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/28/arts/music/ukraine-eurovision-crimea-maruv.html,"The audience loved her. Her song had all the hallmarks of being a hit at Eurovision, the flamboyant European song contest with a cult following. The tune had romance and easy lyrics, and the singer was accompanied by dancers and had a strobe-lit stage act. The singer, Anna Korsun, whose stage name is Maruv, was on track to represent Ukraine at the Eurovision final in Tel Aviv in May. But now her chances have been derailed in an apparent geopolitical dispute after officials questioned her patriotism and her decision to tour Russia. At the national finals last Saturday in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, Ms. Korsun faced an unusual grilling from the jury. Jamala, the 2016 Eurovision winner from Ukraine whose full name is Susana Jamaladinova, began by questioning Ms. Korsun’s coming tour. Then she pretended to be a journalist in Tel Aviv and asked a surprising question in English: “Crimea is Ukraine?” “Ukraine, of course,” Ms. Korsun answered. (Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, drawing condemnation from around the world. Fighting between Ukrainian forces and separatists in the eastern Donbass region has killed more than 10,000 people.) Ms. Korsun’s answers did not seem to matter. On Tuesday, the Ukrainian national broadcaster announced that even though the public had voted for her, she would not be going to Tel Aviv. On Wednesday, Ukraine withdrew from the contest altogether. The broadcaster said the decision to drop Ms. Korsun was based on a disagreement over her contract. They “had not found common ground in the mission of the representative of Ukraine at the international song contest,” the broadcaster said in a statement. It also said that it had been unable to agree terms with other finalists and would therefore not send anyone to Eurovision 2019. The broadcaster’s decision was backed by officials who questioned Ms. Korsun’s allegiance to Ukraine. The Culture Ministry said that only “patriots who are aware of their responsibility” should be allowed to sing at Eurovision, the BBC reported. And the chairman of Ukraine’s Parliament said that any performers who tour in Russia should be banned from representing the country abroad, according to the  news service UNIAN. Ms. Korsun said she had been ready to cancel her concerts in Russia to perform at Eurovision, and she defended herself in a post on Instagram on Tuesday, writing: “I am a citizen of Ukraine, pay taxes and sincerely love Ukraine. But I am not ready to come up with slogans, turn my taking part in the contest into promotion for our politicians.” Eurovision’s rules officially ban politics from the singing competition. But this wasn’t the first time that Russia’s influence in Ukraine has been evoked in the contest. In “1944,” the song that won the Eurovision competition in 2016, Jamala sang about Soviet abuses under Stalin in her native Crimea. When it was Ukraine’s turn to hold the final, Russia’s contestant, Yulia Samoylova, was barred. Ms. Samoylova had performed in Crimea after the Russian annexation. The European Broadcasting Union, which organizes Eurovision, said it was saddened by Ukraine’s decision to pull its contestant this year. But it said in a statement on Thursday that each broadcaster was responsible for the selection of its act. Catherine Baker, a senior lecturer in 20th-century history at the University of Hull in England, said in an email that debates about whether contestants were fit to represent their country were common around the time of national selection competitions for Eurovision. “But contestants have also had to become ambassadors in a more direct sense because of the publicity responsibilities associated with Eurovision’s growing scale as an international event,” added Ms. Baker, who has studied the role politics plays in the singing contest. According to some observers, the public broadcaster’s move was unlikely to be popular with viewers. “The scandal that has unfolded around Ukraine’s participation in Eurovision will certainly have a negative impact on the image of the Ukrainian authorities,” said Sergei Kozlov, a Russian political scientist, speaking to a radio station affiliated to the news agency RIA Novosti. “The means by which she was removed from participation in the competition caused extremely negative emotions among TV viewers.” Fans of Eurovision criticized the decision to drop Ms. Korsun’s act. “Ukraine’s broadcaster has done itself a total disservice,” William Lee Adams, a journalist and founder of a blog about Eurovision, wrote on Twitter. “MARUV was gonna bring y’all glory!” "
5cb4bbca49f0eacbf1f84402,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/15/arts/music/english-concert-semele-review.html,"Handel was a savvy career strategist. So what could he have been thinking when he slipped his opera “Semele” onto the boards at Covent Garden during the Lenten season of 1744? By this point, having accepted that the appetite for Italian opera among London audiences had dwindled, Handel was writing popular English-language oratorios. “Semele” was a hybrid, adapted from an existing opera libretto by William Congreve, though Handel stipulated that it be presented at Covent Garden in the manner of an oratorio. But the subject matter — an unabashed celebration of erotic desire and dreams of immortality, and a story of adulterous love — was hardly suitable for Lent. “Semele” ran for only four performances, followed by two more later that year. Then it languished until the mid-20th century, when audiences realized that, with its inspired music, dramatic complexity and psychological insight, “Semele” is one of Handel’s masterpieces. “Semele” was met with enthusiastic ovations on Sunday at Carnegie Hall, where it received a marvelous concert performance by the English Concert, a superb period instrument orchestra whose annual spring visit to Carnegie is a must for Handel-lovers. They were joined by the aptly named Clarion Choir (Steven Fox, artistic director) and six splendid soloists, all led by the conductor Harry Bicket. The overture begins with a somber yet stately introduction and segues into a rhythmically jagged allegro section full of spiraling triplet flourishes. But the mood shifts when a courtly dance sets the scene for Semele, the daughter of Cadmus, King of Thebes. Her father has arranged for her to marry Athamas, Prince of Boeotia. But she keeps finding reasons to put off the ceremony. As we learn, she is in love with the god Jupiter. Handel gives Semele (the soprano Brenda Rae) a pair of arias: a tender, lyrical plea to Jupiter to inform her of what to do; and the bravura “The Morning Lark,” in which her ecstatic desires are expressed in streams of twittering, coloratura runs. Ms. Rae brought plush radiance to the confessional aria and brilliant, agile singing to the showpiece. In a remarkable quartet that follows, Handel seems to anticipate where opera as a genre was heading. With overlapping melodic strands, four characters express differently bewildered reactions. Semele is restless for Jupiter’s guidance; Athamas (the vibrant countertenor Christopher Lowrey) genuinely loves her and can’t understand her reticence; Cadmus (the sturdy, robust bass Soloman Howard) is mystified by his daughter’s emotional turmoil but doesn’t want to push her too hard; and poor Ino, Semele’s sister (the deep-voiced mezzo-soprano Elizabeth DeShong), who actually loves Athamas, is a bundle of conflicting emotions, including resentment of Semele. This is the kind of complex quartet Mozart would later master. In a boldly operatic touch, Jupiter (the rich-voiced tenor Benjamin Hulett) renders his verdict about the impending marriage by sending down thunder and fury, captured in the orchestra with pummeling drums and registered in chorus with terrified exhortations. Crucial scenes for Jupiter and his aggrieved wife, June (sung by Ms. DeShong with ferocity and a comedic streak), unfold in dramatic recitative. But the choruses may be the glory of “Semele.” Act II — when it looks like Semele and Jupiter, in the form of a mortal man, are going to live in sensual bliss — ends with the sumptuous “Bless the glad earth.” Strands of voices slip into passages of fugue, though Handel knows not to push the counterpoint into tangles of complexity. Semele, who desires immortality, is eventually tricked by Juno (disguised as Ino) into demanding that Jupiter appear to her in his godly form. This causes her destruction, sanctified with a contemplative yet stunned choral number. But the opera ends with the jubilant, rowdy “Happy, happy shall we be.” Why so happy? Bacchus, the god of wine, will rise from Semele’s ashes, we learn. So it’s party time. "

And to celebrate, the library is issuing 6,000 limited-edition library cards featuring an image of Reed taken by Mick Rock in 1972. The library acquired the archive — a large collection of notes, photographs, and more than 600 hours of recordings — after the rocker’s wife, Laurie Anderson, decided to share it with an institution that could preserve and showcase it. Before Reed died in 2013, he had never discussed what to do with his belongings, Anderson said in a phone interview. A part of her wanted to hold onto them, but another part of her thought those traces of Reed should be accessible to young musicians and anyone interested in the history of the man behind the sunglasses. Plus, there were so many books and profiles out there that had tried to define the musician. “It’s very important to be able to present raw material and let people make up their own minds,” Anderson said. [Read more about treasures at the New York Public Library.] Fans may rush to concert posters or his personal collection of LPs, but Anderson said his drawings about tai chi are particularly interesting. “A lot of people don’t actually realize the importance of that in his life,” she added. New York always found its way into the musician’s songs. And with this archive, Anderson said, “He’s become a part of the city, in a way.” "
5ca4c90a49f0eacbf1f80947,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/03/obituaries/gerry-stickells-dead.html,"Gerry Stickells was a car mechanic in southeast England who drove local rock groups to their engagements in his van when, in 1966, he met Chas Chandler, Jimi Hendrix’s manager. Mr. Chandler made him an offer: If he could get Hendrix’s gear out of customs at Heathrow Airport, he could join him on the road in Europe. The errand completed, Mr. Stickells soon became part of rock ’n’ roll history as the roadie, and then tour manager, for Hendrix, the transcendent electric guitarist who was about to release his first single, “Hey Joe,” in Britain. It became a four-year assignment: Mr. Stickells handled the Jimi Hendrix Experience’s gear, drove the band to gigs, fixed the van when it broke down and organized its tours. Some shows were more memorable than others: At the Denver Pop Festival in 1969, he brought Hendrix and his bandmates, the bassist Noel Redding and the drummer Mitch Mitchell, to safety in a U-Haul truck at Mile High Stadium after tear gas had enveloped them onstage during a riot. After the Experience dissolved in 1969, Mr. Stickells stayed with Hendrix, accompanying him most notably to Woodstock, where Hendrix played a jarring, feedback-heavy version of  “The Star Spangled Banner.” When Hendrix died the next year in London, Mr. Stickells identified his body at a hospital and accompanied it to Seattle for burial. What Mr. Stickells learned on the road with Hendrix laid the foundation for the business that he developed over more than 30 years: He became a top road and production manager for musicians at a time when the logistics of touring and performing were growing increasingly elaborate and concerts were turning into ever more lavish extravaganzas. He was best known for his years on the road with Queen, but he also worked with a star-studded cadre of other artists, including Paul McCartney, Elton John, Abba, Fleetwood Mac, Bette Midler and Madonna. Mr. Stickells died on March 6 at his home in Los Angeles. He was 76. His wife, Sylvia (Reed) Stickells, said the cause was complications of a skull base meningioma, a brain tumor that grows in the bones that form the bottom of the skull. It was discovered in 2003 and could not be fully removed, she said. Gerald Richard Stickells was born on July 22, 1942, in Lydd, a town in Kent, England. He was one of 10 children of Thomas and Doris (Coleman) Stickells, farm laborers in a wetland area called the Romney Marsh. At 15, Gerry quit school to become an apprentice mechanic in a garage in nearby New Romney, riding eight miles each way on his bicycle. It would be nearly a decade before he left to join Hendrix. “His parents couldn’t understand why he’d leave this good job, with jobs hard to come by down on the marsh,” Sylvia Stickles said in an email. “They never really got the music thing.” Mr. Stickells had no musical background, but he appreciated Hendrix’s musicianship and his skill as a performer. “When you’re close to the audience, they become more involved in some way; it all feels more alive,” he said in an interview in the 1990s that is posted on Crosstown Torrents, a website devoted to Hendrix. He recalled the “voltage” of a Hendrix show at a “sweaty pub gig.” After Hendrix died, Mr. Stickells managed his Manhattan recording studio, Electric Lady, and then moved to Los Angeles, where he turned the roles of tour and production manager into a global business. He teamed with Chris Lamb to form G.L.S. Productions, which handled every aspect of live music touring and production, including staffing, travel, trucking, ticketing, lighting and stage rigging. “We met on an Elton John tour, and he was the most experienced guy I had ever encountered,” Mr. Lamb said in an interview with Projection Lights and Staging News, an industry publication, in 2015, when it gave him its life achievement award. (Mr. Stickells had received the same honor eight years earlier.) “He knew how to handle every situation.” Through Elton John’s manager, John Reid, Mr. Stickells and Mr. Lamb found another client in Queen, in the 1970s. They helped fulfill the group’s ambitions for the lavish stage spectacles it became known for. “The hardest thing is dealing with the personalities involved, but once you become used to artists’ moods, you can usually stay a step ahead,” Mr. Stickells said in 1980 in an interview with the Philadelphia newspaper The Bulletin. “And I don’t spend too much time listening to the music. I’m too wrapped up in the practical matters.” In a statement posted on Queen’s website after Mr. Stickells’s death, Roger Taylor, the band’s drummer, called him “father figure, great friend and teacher, and an island of calm in the midst of chaos.” Peter Hince, who worked on Queen’s road crew from 1975 to 1986 and wrote the book “Queen Unseen” (2011), said Mr. Stickells had a productive relationship with the band’s lead singer, Freddie Mercury. “He was probably the only person able to get Freddie to change his mind, or convince him otherwise, when Fred chose to be difficult and play the diva,” Mr. Hince said in an email. Mr. Stickells was also credited with helping to crack the market for rock concerts in South America in the early 1980s; Queen proved to be an early success in Argentina and Brazil in 1981. His organizational and diplomatic skills were particularly helpful in dealing with military regimes. In 1985, he and Mr. Lamb built the infrastructure for the first Rock in Rio festival in Rio de Janeiro, where the lineup included Queen, James Taylor, AC/DC, George Benson, Yes, Ozzy Osbourne and Iron Maiden. “Rod Stewart showed up with his personal armed mini-military,” Mr. Stickells told Projection Lights and Staging News in 2007. “Death squads were the norm, and it was pretty intense, but Queen got along O.K. down there because they were able to just get with the local flavor.” Just before the Rio festival, Mr. Stickells reflected on how much the concert business had changed since the 1960s. Recalling the Monterey International Pop Festival in 1967, he told United Press International: “I was traveling with Hendrix, and we got all our sound equipment and the drum kit into one station wagon. Now I’m dealing with millions and tractor-trailer rigs and helicopters.” Mr. Stickells continued to work until 2003, when he had a seizure while on tour with Paul McCartney in Moscow. He learned he had a brain tumor when he returned to Los Angeles. He last worked in 2006, as a production consultant for a Rolling Stones concert in Rio. In addition to his wife, Mr. Stickells is survived by his sisters, Kathleen Evenden, Lilian Else and Muriel Green. Mr. Stickells recently watched “Bohemian Rhapsody” (2018), the film about Queen that won four Oscars, including one for Rami Malek for his portrayal of Mr. Mercury. Mr. Stickells was fragile and could barely speak. “The part that really caught his attention was the Live Aid performance,” Ms. Stickells said, referring to the re-enactment of the 1985 benefit concert that featured a memorable performance by Queen. “That was a huge highlight of his career, and he definitely recognized it, suddenly pointing and smiling, ‘It’s Fred.’ ” "

Last week, “Thank U, Next” (Republic) became Grande’s second No. 1 album in six months, with notably high streaming numbers for a pop album. In its second week out, its totals fell by more than 50 percent, with 169 million streams and 20,000 copies sold as a complete album, according to Nielsen. But that was enough to stay on top.

5c9c7f6049f0eacbf105f784,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/28/arts/music/the-shed-nyc.html,"Two weeks before the opening of the Shed, the ambitious $475 million arts center opening where the High Line meets the luxe Hudson Yards development, workers in hard hats were busily turning its biggest theater into a standing-room-only dance floor for the celebration of African-American music that will inaugurate it April 5. When that ends, they will install 1,200 seats for a run of staged Bjork concerts. Then the seating will be reconfigured for its next show, a kung fu musical featuring aerialists and Sia songs. And, by the middle of the summer, the theater’s walls and ceilings will disappear, as its airy, silvery puffer jacket of a shell rolls back on rails to expose an outdoor plaza for free open-air performances. New York has never seen a new cultural entity quite like the Shed — and not just because of its unusual building.  [See how the Shed’s nesting shell moves on rails to create indoor or outdoor space.] It was born, improbably enough, of the failed attempt to bring the Olympics — and a football stadium — to Manhattan. It began with an idea for a new kind of arts building, before it was entirely clear what would go inside. It was nurtured by the administration of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, a billionaire who gambled an eye-popping $75 million in public money on it before it was fully defined — and later matched the amount with a $75 million gift of his own money. And, in an astonishing feat, it raised nearly half a billion dollars before opening. Now it is opening in the Hudson Yards, the new development that both critics and admirers have likened to Dubai, and which Michael Kimmelman, the architecture critic of The New York Times, lamented was a “supersized suburban-style office park, with a shopping mall and a quasi-gated condo community targeted at the 0.1 percent.” The Shed could become its antidote — if it succeeds in its goal of welcoming the other 99.9 percent.  Some of its backers are calling it the city’s biggest new cultural entity since Lincoln Center opened in the 1960s; others see it more like the emergence of the Park Avenue Armory as a multidisciplinary arts space in 2007. Either way, it is rare for a new institution to attract the kind of lavish support the Shed has, and to open on such a grand scale.  The Shed was more than a decade in the making, and its birth was not always smooth. “This is a project that had more than nine lives,” said Kate D. Levin, who helped develop the project as Mr. Bloomberg’s cultural affairs commissioner and now serves on the Shed’s board. It all began more than two decades ago, with the dream of an investor named Daniel L. Doctoroff, who wanted to bring the Olympics to New York. When he became a deputy mayor in the Bloomberg administration, he continued the push, calling for the construction of a new football stadium for the Jets on the West Side of Manhattan to boost the city’s Olympics bid. (At one point, he tried to drum up support by lugeing down the steps of City Hall. “I almost killed myself,” he recently recalled. ) The plan to build the stadium was killed by state officials after it ran into significant community and political opposition, derailing the city’s Olympics bid. But, as part of its effort, the city had already rezoned a broad swath of the West Side — paving the way for what would ultimately become Hudson Yards. One element of the plan, from the beginning, called for building a “to be determined” cultural institution on a small parcel of city-owned land. It was the kind of amenity — like the promise of new schools and open space — that is often added to proposed real estate projects to help them win approval. But it also reflected the Bloomberg administration’s broader support for the arts and was a product of its time: As New York worked to recover from the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the administration was anxious to reaffirm the city’s position on the world stage. “In the Bloomberg administration we always saw New York on some level as a competitive entity,” Mr. Doctoroff said, “and thought that New York competes extraordinarily effectively through our cultural institutions.”  Their plans were nebulous at first. The city started out by holding brainstorming sessions with arts leaders and artists, and decided early on that the new space should be a highly flexible one that could cater to the growing desire of many artists to break out of their silos and blend disciplines. “Dancers were even more interested in collaborating with visual artists,’’ Ms. Levin said. “Musicians really wanted to work with theatrical kinds of expressions of their work.’’ The architecture firms hired to design it — Diller Scofidio + Renfro, in collaboration with Rockwell Group — were given the task of imagining not only a new structure, but also a new institution.  “It was some kind of cultural entity, it was undefined, and it was to be flexible,” the lead architect, Elizabeth Diller, said. “FLEXIBLE was in capital letters,” David Rockwell recalled. “We sort of liked that.” They quickly came up with the building’s salient feature: its sliding shell. It was a physical embodiment of that flexibility, but just as crucially it proved a nifty, eye-catching design that became a major selling point for a project still struggling to define itself. And it doubled its footprint. Mr. Doctoroff — who went on to run Mr. Bloomberg’s business, Bloomberg L.P., before running Sidewalk Labs, a sister company to Google, and becoming the chairman of the Shed’s board — tends to speak of the project in business terms. “It’s one of the largest cultural start-ups ever,” he said. At one point, he said, its founders market-tested the idea of making it a “cultural time share,” to see if it could be rented to visiting institutions that wanted a New York presence. They initially christened it Culture Shed. “One of the definitions of shed is ‘an open-ended structure with tools,’” Mr. Doctoroff said, “and that’s how we saw this, as a platform for artists.” There was still no artistic director in place in 2013 when Mr. Bloomberg arranged the $75 million city grant — jump-starting its creation at a moment when other arts projects, including the plan to build a performing arts center at the World Trade Center site, had seemed to stall. (Mr. Bloomberg declined to be interviewed about the Shed.)  Such lavish support for an untested concept was initially greeted with skepticism — and more than a little jealousy — from other city arts leaders as they struggled to keep their own institutions afloat in trying times.  But early fears that the city might be creating a cultural white elephant were largely allayed in 2014, when the Shed named its first artistic director and chief executive: Alex Poots, who had founded the Manchester International Festival and, as the artistic director of the Park Avenue Armory, had unexpectedly made the Upper East Side a destination for must-see, cutting-edge art. When Mr. Poots was first approached by the search firm looking for someone to lead the Shed — they had spoken earlier to figures from the visual arts world — he was not interested.  “When they came knocking, I remember thinking, well, what’s the mission?” he said. But he agreed to meet with Mr. Doctoroff — if Mr. Doctoroff would come see one of his shows, Kenneth Branagh’s muddy, bloody “Macbeth,” which was playing at the Park Avenue Armory after a run in Manchester. “This was not just a touring show; we made it,” he recalled telling Mr. Doctoroff. “And I have one question for you right at the start of this meeting: This show cost $4 million to make, O.K.? If we sell out the run, every single ticket, we would make $3.1 million in box office. So my big question to you is: Is $900,000 an investment in culture and society, or is it a loss?” Mr. Doctoroff’s reply, he said, was: “I’d been warned about you.” Before Mr. Poots agreed to take the job, he reshaped the whole idea of the Shed.  He insisted that the Shed commission all new work, sometimes with partners elsewhere. It was a radical departure for an entity that had weighed the cultural time share idea, and a departure for a city whose presenters often import visiting companies who perform works created by theaters and festivals elsewhere.  “That was a whole different organization that I was describing,” Mr. Poots said, “with twice as many staff and a whole commissioning pot of money that would need to be found.” The board signed off. Presenting all new work can be exciting. But it’s also risky. Karen Brooks Hopkins, the former president of the Brooklyn Academy of Music, put it this way: “Doing a few commissions is complicated — doing all is a little scary.” There was another thing, Mr. Poots said: its original name, Culture Shed, rubbed him the wrong way. He asked several artists he trusted for advice. Many said they found the word culture redundant, if not off-putting. Marina Abramovic, the performance artist, offered a branding analogy. “She said: ‘When they named Apple, they didn’t call it Apple Computer,’” Mr. Poots recalled. “Actually, I found out, they did. But they got rid of it — making her point.” He asked the artists to put their thoughts in writing so he could send them to the board — which agreed to rename the institution the Shed. Mr. Poots also made changes to the building. He wanted to add seating capacity to its theaters and, perhaps most crucially, better soundproofing. “That meant we could present Kendrick Lamar at 108 decibels without it affecting the galleries and critically, the theater,” he said. Those changes added $26 million to the building’s price tag. There were construction difficulties to surmount. The architects had to reorient the building so that it faced east instead of north. The Vessel, a shiny, copper-colored stairway to nowhere by Thomas Heatherwick that has proved more popular with selfie-takers than architecture critics, was added along the Shed’s north side. Asked what she made of the Shed’s shiny next-door neighbor, Ms. Diller simply raised her eyebrows. Then a new plan called for joining the Shed, which had been envisioned as a stand-alone building, to a tower. Ms. Diller and Mr. Rockwell ended up signing on to design the tower, too, to protect their design for the Shed, they said — a move that allowed them to claim the use of the tower’s first 10 floors as back offices and storage spaces for the Shed. The Shed has raised a total of $529 million, when a $45 million interest-free loan from Stephen M. Ross, the developer of Hudson Yards and a member of its board, is factored in. But for all its resources, it still faces challenges.  Raising money for annual operating expenses is much harder than raising money for capital projects, which generate excitement and naming opportunities. The Shed will soon find itself competing not only with existing cultural institutions for philanthropic support, but also new ones, including the multidisciplinary, flexible theater (sound familiar?) being built at the World Trade Center site, the Ronald O. Perelman Center for the Performing Arts.  Shed officials were reluctant to discuss their operating budget or business plan, but said they expect to spend around $50 million in the first year. They hope to generate rental income; the Shed has an event space on its top floor, and there has been talk of luring Fashion Week. Now the Shed will have to define itself, and where it fits into the city. Is it the northernmost part of the High Line, the popular elevated park Ms. Diller helped create on a set of abandoned rail tracks? Or is it a Hudson Yards amenity — another bit of bragging rights in a glossy new amalgam of office towers, condos and a luxury mall where $800 haircuts are on offer? The tensions are clear. The Shed is now envisioned as a place for artists to create new work — Ms. Diller recalled how when she was starting out New York was still “a place of production,” and lamented that it had become “a place for consumption” — but it sits in an area that, as much as any, has come to symbolize the soaring rents that have priced artists out of the city. Several arts leaders questioned whether the Shed’s permanent-festival approach to programming, with all new commissions, would produce enduring works — and if it would be able to compete with the tried-and-tested offerings of other presenters. But Mr. Poots, who has succeeded in the past at drawing audiences to even seemingly esoteric fare, said art needed new work, and new ideas.  “Let artists explore — let them fail!” he said. “We don’t want them to fail, but it’s not that they’ve messed up if they fail. In every show we do there’s things that don’t always work, but there has to be a place to experiment and invent.” He said that his artistic vision for the Shed — as the kind of place that welcomes the avant-garde and pop, as well as music, theater and dance, sometimes all within the same work — was all about forging a connection to the city and its diverse audiences.  “This idea that we’re making new work, commissioning across all art forms, allows for parity,” he said. “Across art forms, but also across society.” Ms. Hopkins, the former Brooklyn Academy of Music president, noted that challenge of making that kind of connection in a development critics have likened to a gated community. “The challenge for the Shed is that even with this constant flow of money, great cultural institutions thrive best without gates — wide open to great ideas, diversity, energy and curiosity,” she said. “We have seen Lincoln Center and others spend millions to open their campuses and space for this kind of real connection between visitor and artist. Can this happen at Hudson Yards?” The Shed is trying. It is working to reach out to the city beyond its glass-tower neighbors: offering $10 tickets to people in low-income neighborhoods, starting a program teaching flex, the Brooklyn-born, bone-bending dance, at schools and public housing community centers, and presenting works by 52 emerging artists from around the city — including It’s Showtime NYC!, the dance collective born of outlawed subway performers. And its flexible design holds out the possibility of presenting a wide variety of work, without being too hemmed in by the contours of its building. Which was the point from the beginning. “It started with a kind of response to how to make a structure that would be responsive into the future,” Ms. Diller said. “The future is unknowable: That’s the one thing that we do know. So what would artists be thinking about and doing in 20 years, 40 years? We have absolutely no clue.” "
5c5b048c3a125f5075c08503,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/06/arts/music/lincoln-center-92nd-street-y.html,"Lincoln Center, which has been buffeted by leadership churn in recent years, has looked to Broadway and academia for its last two presidents. They didn’t take. Now it is looking to the East Side of Manhattan, and to someone with a background running a large nonprofit cultural and community center. Lincoln Center announced Wednesday that its next president and chief executive would be Henry Timms, who leads the 92nd Street Y. The difficulties Mr. Timms, 42, will face at the center, the nation’s largest performing arts complex, are substantial. He must help get the long-delayed renovation of the New York Philharmonic’s home, David Geffen Hall, back on track after a series of false starts. He will need to keep the complex’s finances stable at a tough time for arts organizations. And he will have to work to improve Lincoln Center’s sometimes fraught relationships with the powerful independent organizations that make it their home, but do not answer to it — including the Metropolitan Opera, the Philharmonic and New York City Ballet. “I don’t think you should ever pretend that there aren’t some real, and interesting, management challenges here,” Mr. Timms said in an interview. “But I think it’s the case that every constituent’s best interest is served in a collaborative culture.” The 92nd Street Y has a $69 million annual budget, just over half of Lincoln Center’s; a powerful and wealthy board; and a wide variety of offerings that include a distinguished concert program and lecture series. While leading it, Mr. Timms helped create #GivingTuesday, which urges people to donate to charities on the Tuesday after Thanksgiving and has grown into a national movement. He raised $160 million toward a $180 million capital campaign for the Y, and used virtual reality to help people think about how to remake its buildings. And he helped the Y recover from one of its most difficult periods. His predecessor there, Sol Adler, was fired amid accusations that he had an affair with an employee, and there was an investigation into whether another manager there had been demanding kickback payments from vendors. Mr. Adler committed suicide in 2014, and his widow sued the Y. Mr. Timms’s ability to steer the Y through that trying time was one of the things that impressed Katherine Farley, the chairwoman of Lincoln Center’s board. “He inherited a very tough, tragic, complicated situation, any way you look at it,” Ms. Farley said in an interview. “His temperament is one of collaboration; he seems to have a low ego need.” That collaborative approach could help ease tensions at the complex. Although Lincoln Center was founded to serve essentially as the landlord to constituent organizations, over time it began offering its own performances and series, including Mostly Mozart and Great Performers — leading to competition for resources, ticket sales and contributions. Running the center has never been easy. Reynold Levy, who led it for a dozen years and left in 2014, called his memoir “They Told Me Not to Take That Job.” Things have been rocky since. Mr. Levy’s successor, Jed Bernstein, a producer who had led the Broadway League, was removed after only 27 months. An interim team took over until the center found its next president: Debora L. Spar, who had been the president of Barnard College. She was pushed out after a year, after clashing with the center’s senior staff, who were backed by the board. Then Lincoln Center named Russell Granet, who had run its education division, acting president — spurring speculation that he was next in line. Some of the leaders of the complex’s resident arts organizations expressed concerns that Mr. Granet did not have enough prior experience for a job of the scale and stature of running Lincoln Center, according to an arts executive who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive conversations. The leaders wrote Ms. Farley, asking for a meeting. When they met, they discussed the kind of leader they believed the center should seek. “They mentioned some qualities that really describe Henry to a T,” Ms. Farley said, adding that several constituents, including Deborah Borda, the president and chief executive of the Philharmonic, had mentioned Mr. Timms as someone to consider. “They said things like: someone who had an entrepreneurial instinct; someone who had a strong connection to the arts and who had real appreciation for excellence, and what was finest about Lincoln Center; someone who could create synergies across the campus to take all of what we do at Lincoln Center to a new level.” Ms. Borda said that she was pleased with the selection, and believed they would be ready to proceed with the next steps of the Geffen Hall project soon. “I think it is an exceptional appointment, and I really felt an immediate click of a true partnership with him,” she said in an interview. And Peter Gelb, the general manager of the Met, said that Mr. Timms’s experience made him a “great choice.” Mr. Gelb added that he was heartened that Lincoln Center had paid serious attention to its constituents during the search process. Asked if the Met had a wish list from the incoming administration, he said, “The Met’s wish list is the same as the other constituents: that Lincoln Center regard them with the importance they deserve, since they are the fundamental elements of what makes Lincoln Center Lincoln Center.” Mr. Timms — who grew up in Exeter, England, and is the author, with Jeremy Heimans, of “New Power,” a book about leadership in an increasingly interconnected world — will need to hit the ground running. The center’s leadership struggles have slowed big projects, including the renovation of Geffen Hall, which has been on and off for 20 years. Ms. Farley landed a $100 million gift from the entertainment mogul David Geffen in 2015, and renamed the building for him. But there were concerns that the early plans for a revamp would cost considerably more than the initial $500 million price tag people spoke of. And the proposal threatened to keep the Philharmonic out of the hall for several seasons of construction. In 2017, Ms. Spar and Ms. Borda, who was just starting at the Philharmonic, scrapped the plans and went back to the drawing board. Mr. Timms said it was too soon to say what his vision for Geffen Hall was. Ms. Farley promised that more plans for the hall would be shared in the near future, and said that they would still be transformative. “It’s going to be really exciting,” she said. "
5cae15bd49f0eacbf1f825c7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/10/theater/norma-jeane-baker-of-troy-review.html,"Marilyn Monroe is falling to pieces again. That most endlessly analyzed of Hollywood sex goddesses is now being subjected to an especially rigorous process of deconstruction — or is it evaporation? — at the Shed, the new, $475 million arts center of Hudson Yards, where Anne Carson’s “Norma Jeane Baker of Troy” opened on Tuesday night. “Norma Jeane” — which is less a play than a staged poem — is the inaugural production at the 500-seat Griffin Theater, and it has cultural cachet to burn, with the added draw of pop appeal. Ms. Carson is the esteemed Canadian poet, classicist, professor and translator, known for playfully finding serious links between the ancient past and the evanescent present. The director is Katie Mitchell, the intensely cerebral theater and opera director. And its sole performers — and this, for the less recondite theatergoer, is the beauty part — are that fine stage and screen actor Ben Whishaw and the opera star Renée Fleming. Neither Mr. Whishaw nor Ms. Fleming portrays the title character in this equally hypnotic and exasperating production. Or not exactly. When first seen, on a snowy New Year’s Eve in the early 1960s, their characters appear to be a rather anxious businessman (Mr. Whishaw) and the thoroughly professional stenographer (Ms. Fleming) he has recruited to help him work, after hours, on a special project. That would be the very script of the show we’re watching, which is indeed about Norma Jeane Baker. If you don’t know that Norma Jeane was Monroe’s birth name, I wish you much luck in following this show. Because that’s only the first — and by far the simplest — of the identities attached to Monroe in Ms. Carson’s investigation of the illusion and substance of feminine beauty in a testosterone-fueled world of war. For Ms. Carson has merged Monroe with another much-maligned sex object, Helen of Troy. You know who she is, right, the face that launched a thousand ships? But wait. This Helen isn’t exactly the woman you learned about in school. Instead, she’s the heroine of Euripides’ seldom-performed tragedy “Helen.” In that play, Helen never set foot in Troy, having been spirited away by the Gods (to exile in Egypt) before the war ever started. There was someone who appeared to be Helen living with her abductor, Paris. But she, it turns out, was only a phantasm or (to use a word much savored in Ms. Carson’s poem) a cloud. That is the story that Mr. Whishaw’s character is trying to tell, more or less, except that in his rendering, Helen is Norma Jeane, while her ostensibly cuckolded husband, Menelaus is transformed into Arthur, King of Sparta and New York (referring to Monroe’s third husband, the playwright Arthur Miller). The movie director Fritz Lang figures in this version, as does Monroe’s confidant Truman Capote, and — oh, yes — the singer Pearl Bailey. Norma Jeane is further conflated with another abductee from Greek mythology, Persephone, especially as she was conjured by the 20th-century British poet Stevie Smith. All these variations on the theme of beautiful women held captive by men echo a phrase that is both spoken and sung throughout this production: “It’s a disaster to be a girl.” Now why, you may well ask, is this a tale to be told by a man? Ms. Carson has said that she wrote this monologue with Mr. Whishaw in mind. He had appeared most compellingly as a fluidly androgynous Dionysus in Ms. Carson’s translation of Euripides’ “Bakkhai,” at the Almeida Theater in London in 2015. His ability to cross the gender divide without coyness or caricature turns out to be an invaluable asset in “Norma Jeane.” As his nameless man dictates his reworked version of Euripides — replete with spoken instructions as to punctuation and spacing, along with lengthy digressions on strategies of war — he slowly divests himself of his workaday clothing. What’s revealed beneath his business suit is a deeply scarred torso, possibly — you may infer — a legacy of time in the military. Then, little by little, this nervous, determined man reinvents himself — painted by fingernail by painted fingernail, false eyelash by false eyelash — as Monroe as she was seen in “The Seven Year Itch.” It is a process that at first appalls Ms. Fleming’s transcribing secretary. But as the production continues, she warms to her wounded employer’s ardent attempts to understand a woman whose suicide is still fresh in the American mind. By the end, they have together achieved a sort of improbable apotheosis of empathy. Or that’s the way I saw it. Ms. Carson is not the most immediately accessible of writers. Nor is Ms. Mitchell — whose recent work includes the divisive, gender-swapping Martin Crimp play “When We Have Sufficiently Tortured Each Other” at London’s National Theater — one to lead her audiences by the hand. She has rearranged Ms. Carson’s original text so that the play now begins with Mr. Whishaw uttering the ancient Greek word τις, which he explains is a highly protean pronoun. The monologue that follows is dense with references that range from the academic to the tabloid. And it is heard not only as spoken live by Mr. Whishaw, but as recited by his voice on a tape recorder. His words are occasionally picked up and echoed, often in song, by Ms. Fleming. From time to time, her creamy, disembodied voice floats through the air like thought made sound. You don’t really you need to know your classics or even your Hollywood lore to grasp the thematic gist of “Norma Jeane,” which ponders the follies of war-making men and their abuses of women. Sometimes Ms. Carson’s conjunctions of figures past and present can seem both too obvious and too obscure. The show’s surprisingly predictable conclusion lacks the haunting resonance it aspires to. But the precise calibration of the physical production holds your attention. (Or held mine, anyway; there have regularly been walkouts since it began previews last weekend.) The cohesive technical elements include Alex Eales’s perfectly detailed “Mad Men”-era set, Sussie Juhlin-Wallén’s matching costumes, Anthony Doran’s crepuscular lighting and Donato Wharton’s creepily insinuating sound. Mr. Whishaw and Ms. Fleming are, against the odds, marvelous. They somehow lend an emotional spontaneity to ritualistic words and gestures, while conjuring an affecting relationship between two people who, after all, don’t even exist in Ms. Carson’s text. Mr. Whishaw’s astutely measured metamorphosis here suggests both deep, contemporary personal neurosis and atavistic self-sacrifice. As might be expected, Ms. Fleming brings a luxuriant, caressing tone to the song fragments composed by the composer Paul Clark (which sometimes bring to mind Samuel Barber’s “Knoxville: Summer of 1915”). What you may not realize is that most of the sound effects and background music have been made entirely from a base of recorded clusters of notes sung by Ms. Fleming. This seems appropriate to a show about the mutability of perception and image. And though it’s a man who narrates — and tries to make sense of — Norma Jeane’s story, it is fittingly a woman’s voice that supplies the aural oxygen in which it unfolds. "
5c5b436e3a125f5075c085bd,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/06/arts/music/21-savage-ice-atlanta-rapper.html,"The video for “A Lot,” 21 Savage’s elegiac single, takes place at a formal dinner and party in a cloud-high mansion, a lavish and exuberant celebration of black wealth. But there’s a moving sequence midway through that suggests trouble just beneath the surface. The cuts are quick — warm shots of confident guests at the dinner table interspersed with darker scenes in which they’re suffering: poor health, financial hardship, criminal past, abuse, death of a loved one. The message of the video isn’t exactly that nothing is as it seems, but more that where you end up may be far from where you came from, and that success doesn’t cure all obstacles. When 21 Savage first emerged in 2015, he was a cold brutalist of a rapper whose verses verged on the dead-eyed. But just a few years on, he’s taken a turn to the reflective. Later in the video, he added a ruminative new verse to the song, rapping, “Went through some things, but I couldn’t imagine my kids stuck at the border,” directly addressing the current administration’s divisive immigration policies. [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] On Sunday, just a couple of days after that video’s release, 21 Savage was arrested by agents of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which said he was in this country illegally and placed him into deportation proceedings. As of Wednesday afternoon, he remained in ICE custody. Is 21 Savage American? By any measurement other than citizenship, yes. He was born She’yaa Bin Abraham-Joseph in England in 1992. According to Charles Kuck, one of his immigration attorneys, he came to the United States at age 7 and has been here continuously ever since, apart from a one-month period in 2005. He then re-entered the country on an H-4 visa, which expired in 2006, leaving him without legal status. But the events of the last few days underscore the ways in which the hard power of government authority and soft power of online conversation can align in peculiar and insidious ways. As news began to spread on social media of 21 Savage’s arrest on Sunday, the meme and joke ecosystem that uses trauma as oxygen went into overdrive, reacting with special intensity to the revelation that 21 Savage — one of the titans of Atlanta’s rap scene — was in fact British. As the government put his relationship with this country in peril, thousands of people chirped in online to poke at the unlikeliness, and precariousness, of his situation. That 21 Savage is in fact a British national is, ultimately, not particularly revelatory, or even meaningful. Foreign-born residents made up 13.7 percent of the United States population in 2017, according to the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey, published last year (which includes those in the country legally and illegally). Most of the humor turned on a high-society caricature understanding of England, and the dissonance of locating someone like 21 Savage — a seen-it-all stoicist with a dagger tattooed on his forehead — inside it. By and large, those people overlooked, or didn’t think as far as, the more odious association: that of empire and colonization. (His mother’s family hails from Dominica, a former British colony in the West Indies.) His success, however, is especially American. Growing up in some of Atlanta’s poorest communities, 21 Savage had a troubled childhood. He’s said that he dropped out of school to sell drugs, and has spoken in interviews of a youth marked by violence and crime. But after losing a close friend and a brother to gun violence, he turned to rapping. And within a year, he was one of Atlanta’s most promising prospects. He’s since worked with Drake, Cardi B and Post Malone. His 2017 debut album, “Issa Album,” went gold, and his second studio album, “I Am > I Was,” released in December, debuted at the top of the Billboard album chart. At this Sunday’s Grammy Awards, 21 Savage is nominated in two categories. He has also been maturing in the public eye — advocating for gun control, donating money to educate young people in Atlanta on financial literacy (an announcement made on Ellen DeGeneres’s show, of all places), even walking alongside then-girlfriend Amber Rose in 2017 at her SlutWalk, a women’s empowerment event, carrying a sign that read “I’m a Hoe Too.” This is the American promise, no? To start from nothing and turn it into a bounty. To receive a cruel hand and still emerge victorious. And yet there is this other American promise, or threat, which is that all that comfort can be easily ripped away if it isn’t achieved in the correct fashion. In the case of 21 Savage, whose public image was built on a kind of impenetrable toughness mixed with weary resilience, this moment of vulnerability was destabilizing. Even in his most intimate music, he never presents as anything other than an agent of control. But the immigration system is beyond his jurisdiction, even though, since becoming a public figure, he has taken steps to address his status. According to a statement released by his attorneys on Tuesday, in 2017 he applied for a U visa, which, according to United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, can be issued by the government to crime victims “who have suffered mental or physical abuse and are helpful to law enforcement or government officials in the investigation or prosecution of criminal activity.” 21 Savage has said he was shot in 2013. The statement did not specify whether he cooperated with authorities. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that 21 Savage was arrested at the same time DeKalb County police arrested another rapper, Young Nudy, on unrelated charges. But 21 Savage was detained directly by ICE, Kuck said. 21 Savage also was convicted on felony drug charges in 2014. The conviction record was expunged in September 2018 as part of Georgia’s first-offender program and the files have been sealed, according to Jacoby Hudson, who represented 21 Savage in the matter. (Though expunged convictions have been used in deportation proceedings, 21 Savage would be eligible for removal simply for the overstayed visa.) 21 Savage is now among the highest-profile immigration detainees, his situation instantly becoming a flash point in national conversations about people living in this country without legal status, and in dialogues about the ways in which immigrants contribute to American society. A petition asking for his release started by Black Lives Matter has amassed over 200,000 signatures. A star who built his own success, 21 Savage has in one fell swoop re-emerged as someone in need of protection. But in his recent music and public life, his identity was already becoming more complex and nuanced, delivering tales about the horrors of life at the bottom salted with a fresh understanding of just how slippery it can be at the top.

5c94c69149f0eacbf105e795,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/22/arts/music/silvana-imam.html,"STOCKHOLM — On a recent Friday night, the Swedish rapper Silvana Imam appeared on stage at Annexet, a concert venue in the south side of Stockholm, dressed like a comic-book villain. Her face hidden by a black mask studded with spikes, she dragged a metal baseball bat across the stage to the loud cheers of her mostly female audience. The menacing display was a theatrical embodiment of the gleefully confrontational role Imam, the lesbian daughter of refugees, has come to play in Swedish pop culture. Imam, whose mother is Lithuanian and father Syrian, is one of the country’s best-known hip-hop artists, and a symbol of the counterreaction to the rise of right-wing populism in Scandinavia’s most populous country. When the mask came off, Imam, 32, launched into “I Min Zon” (“In My Zone”), a languid, withering song from her first EP, in which she rails against racism and sexism in the country. “Fifteen million people in the world are named Mohamed,” she rapped in Swedish, “but whose name do they want to see on the résumé?” Mattias Naxe, 30, a lighting designer in the audience, said that he was drawn to Imam’s music primarily because she was a “very good rapper,” but added that her success was also a reflection of Sweden’s polarized political climate. In last fall’s national election, the right-wing populist Sweden Democrats won 18 percent of the vote, making them the country’s third-largest party. “She came at the right time,” he said, adding that she “very much” represents this particular moment. Although Sweden is known for being one of the world’s premier suppliers of dance-pop, it also has one of Europe’s most vibrant hip-hop scenes. Imam is one of its biggest female stars. In 2014, her breakout single “IMAM,” a political song in which she refers to herself as a “176 centimeter Pussy Riot,” reached number one in the Swedish charts. Since then, she has won numerous awards, including a Swedish Grammi, the country’s equivalent to a Grammy Award, for artist of the year. Her most recent album, “Helig Moder” (“Holy Mother”), released in February, has been widely praised in the Swedish news media, and she was recently announced as the opening act for the main stage of the renowned Roskilde Music Festival in Denmark. In an interview in a coffee shop in the Hornstull neighborhood of Stockholm, where she lives, Imam said she had struggled with the pressure of her success and the fallout from her position as a political provocateur. She explained that her new album was an attempt to come to terms with the “superhero everyone wants me to be, or the one that I’ve become in Scandinavia for a lot of people.” Although Sweden is often seen internationally as a paragon of social liberalism, many of Imam’s songs have highlighted the racism, misogyny and homophobia she believes permeate society here. Her 2015 single “Imam Cobain” included a frequently quoted line instructing the men who “say my love is a crime” to “go and kiss” a “swastika.” Another song called out people offended by the fact that she is a “hybrid,” with Syrian roots. The rise of the Sweden Democrats, she argued, only goes to prove her point. The party, whose slogans include “Keep Sweden Swedish,” has its roots in the neo-Nazi movement and campaigned on severely limiting immigration. “Sweden is finally revealing itself for what it is,” Imam said. The rapper was born in 1986 in communist Lithuania, but her family moved to what was then Czechoslovakia when she was a toddler. When her father, a journalist and lawyer, came under pressure there because of his far-left politics, the family fled to Kiruna, Sweden’s northernmost city, which she described as “very cold” and “with no people of color.” After the family relocated to Stockholm, Imam attended a school in the suburbs where she said there were “neo-Nazis and immigrants, and nothing in between.” A longtime fan of the Fugees and Kanye West, she started performing while completing her degree in English and psychology at the University of Stockholm. Her anger at the far right was galvanized in 2013, when Jimmie Akesson, the leader of the Sweden Democrats, retweeted a photo of her performing at a protest against the far right while wearing a jacket bearing a crossed-out “S.D.,” the party’s initials. The song she performed included the line, “send the pigs to slaughter,” referring to members of the party. Afterward, she received threats from his supporters. “He knew what he was doing. He knew what kinds of followers he had,” she said. The debate around refugees in Sweden, she argued, has become untethered from reality. “The claim that we can’t afford the refugees isn’t fact-based,” Imam said. Tax avoidance by large companies was a bigger drain on the economy, she added. In 2015, one of Imam’s cousins was among the many thousands of migrants attempting to make their way across the Mediterranean into Europe after the outbreak of the Syrian civil war. The incident, she recalled, affected her deeply. “She sent me a photo of her boat, with just water and three sandwiches, and I thought this was crazy,” she said. The cousin and her two children ultimately ended up in Denmark. Ametist Azordegan, a radio host and producer currently writing a book about Swedish hip-hop, described Imam by phone as one of the country’s “top hip-hop artists” and one of the “absolute best” lyricists, and argued that she “has built a space for gay, young women that hasn’t existed in the media in Sweden.” Christina Tsiobanelis, one of the three co-directors of “Silvana,” a documentary about Imam’s early career that played in movie theaters around Europe, said in a phone interview that the rapper’s success coincided with not only the rise of the far right, but also the growth of an increasingly vocal feminist movement in the country. “If she had come up three years earlier, she might not have become that successful,” she said. The film, which won a Guldbagge Award, the Swedish equivalent of an Oscar, for best documentary, also chronicled the beginnings of Imam’s relationship with Beatrice Eli, a Swedish pop singer. The two remain together, and have recorded several duets. In Imam’s view, they are the country’s first prominent lesbian couple to be “cool and young.” She added, after a pause, “and hot.” At Annexet, Eli appeared on stage to perform with Imam in “Magi Som Orlando,” a sexually charged duet. They pressed into each other as the crowd cheered. Then, a few minutes later, the stage turned into a raucous celebration reflecting Imam’s cultural and sexual identities. Two belly dancers and a row of women in traditional Arab costume gyrated on the stage, while another dancer balanced on her head. Silvana jumped up and down, laughing. “Silvana is a symbol for the new Swedish girl,” said Leonora Haag, 20, who watched in the audience. “Swedish people are very much a collective, you don’t stand out. What’s amazing about her is that she just doesn’t care.” "

5c2bca483a125f5075c0277e,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/01/arts/music/review-adriana-lecouvreur-metropolitan-opera.html,"Backstage at the Comédie-Française in the Paris of 1730, the title character of Francesco Cilea’s “Adriana Lecouvreur,” a leading actress with the company, demurs when hailed by a prince and an abbé as a muse, a goddess, a siren. No, Adriana answers in the short, soaring aria “Io son l’umile ancella.” She is a humble maidservant of the creative spirit who provides the words, the delicate instrument that serves the creator’s hand. Actually, Cilea created this 1902 opera as a surefire vehicle for a prima donna, so it’s always hard to take Adriana’s words seriously when a soprano sings them. But on Monday at the Metropolitan Opera’s New Year’s Eve gala premiere of a new production of “Adriana,” Anna Netrebko turned this aria into the aching expression of a woman who triumphs on the stage but muddles through life. When we meet her she is hopelessly in love with a dashing young man, Maurizio, whom she believes to be an ensign to a count. (He actually is the Count of Saxony.) But even before we see the lovers together, Ms. Netrebko, for all the charisma and allure she conveyed with her glamorous presence and her plush, intensely beautiful singing, suggested how uncertain Adriana feels. Emphasizing three crucial words, she sang that her life is quiet, happy and terrible. Terrible? Yes, in a way. You believed that this artist, who constantly recreates herself in public, would in life be all too vulnerable to the jealousies of rivals, the fawning of admirers, and the passions of a hotheaded, prevaricating young man. Also, the truth is that for all the lyrical richness, melodramatic fervor and stylish evocations of Parisian courtly and theatrical life in 1730, this opera, the only one by Cilea that turns up now and then in production, needs all the help it can get from artists of Ms. Netrebko’s stature. It’s a good and effective, but not great, work. The light touch that Cilea brings to bear, while preventing the drama from slipping into mawkish excess, sometimes feels musically thin. “Adriana” must have a superior cast and conductor to succeed. The Met is providing that and more with this David McVicar staging, which replaces the musty 1963 production created for Renata Tebaldi. The tenor Piotr Beczala, singing with youthful fervor, ardent lyricism and clarion top notes, is ideal as the impetuous Maurizio. While suggesting how smitten he is by Adriana, he comes across as a young man on the move. With his royal position looking risky, he proves himself through military exploits. But we learn that he is also disentangling himself from an advantageous liaison with the married Princess of Bouillon, who refuses to let him go. As the princess, the mezzo-soprano Anita Rachvelishvili, who almost stole the show singing Amneris to Ms. Netrebko’s Aida this fall, was again stupendous. She sang with unforced power and rich colorings throughout the wide range of her voice, from chesty low tones to gleaming top notes. Yet in conveying this imposing princess’s inner emotional fragility, Ms. Rachvelishvili shaped crucial phrases with supple, yearning tenderness. For all the convoluted strands of this story, “Adriana” is at its core a torturous love triangle. Ms. Netrebko, Mr. Beczala and Ms. Rachvelishvili claimed those roles so tenaciously that the drama bristled with passion and danger. [Read more about Anita Rachvelishvili’s rocket to stardom] That these performances made “Adriana” seem more musically substantial than usual was also thanks to the insightful conducting of Gianandrea Noseda. Cilea emerged during a period in Italian opera, dominated by Puccini, when the public could not get enough of hot-blooded, verismo (essentially true to life) music dramas. When it comes to harmonic daring and subtle manipulations of melodic motifs, Cilea was no Puccini. But without pumping up or milking the music in any way, Mr. Noseda led a vigorous, exacting and pulsing performance, drawing out inner details and lending lightness, with a mordant touch, to the many scenes of backstage bustle and frivolity at the company where Adriana is a star. The opera inhabits a realm similar to the 1980s play, and later film, “Dangerous Liaisons,” which shows 18th-century courtly French life as a game of sexual adventure and humiliation. In this Met production (involving five other companies and introduced at Covent Garden in London in 2010), Mr. McVicar puts the focus on the backstage hubbub of the theater troupe as much as possible. A rotating replica of a Baroque theater (a dominant element of Charles Edwards’s set) reveals the actors and dancers readying themselves in cluttered dressing rooms, then spins around to show us the performance as viewed from the wings. The costumes (by Brigitte Reiffenstuel) are also true to the styles of the period. In these days when updated settings are commonplace, Mr. McVicar’s choice to maintain the original setting might seem safe. But by telling the story with such attention to period detail he emphasized the opera’s intertwining of political and sexual intrigue. The entire cast was excellent, especially the baritone Ambrogio Maestri as Michonnet, the stage manager of the company, who pines for Adriana. With his formidable voice and hulking physique, Mr. Maestri was in his element bellowing commands at his troupe, which made the moments when he is awkward with affection for Adriana almost heartbreaking. Other standouts were Maurizio Muraro as the Prince of Bouillon, who hardly cares about his wife’s infidelities and is carrying on his own affair with Adriana’s rival in the theater company, and Carlo Bosi as the wily Abbé of Chazeuil. The strongest scenes in the opera, involving the three principals, leapt off the stage on Monday, especially the confrontation between Adriana and the princess in Act II, when they discover that they both love Maurizio. Ms. Netrebko and Ms. Rachvelishvili sang ferociously as they hurled accusatory phrases at each other. Yet each found moments in the music to suggest the womanly longing that consumes them. Since the spring of 2018, Ms. Netrebko is three for three in bringing new roles to the Met and making them her own: Puccini’s Tosca, Verdi’s Aida, and now Adriana Lecouvreur. In the final scene, when Adriana sings the aria “Poveri fiori,” Ms. Netrebko was magnificent. She cradles dying violets, a token of love she had given Maurizio, which she mistakenly thinks he has returned as a sign of rejection. In fact the princess has sent them, laced with poison. The implausible elements of the situation disappeared as Ms. Netrebko made this music, and this moment, seem an inspired creation. "

5c5509b63a125f5075c07aa6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/01/business/spotify-gimlet-podcasts-talks.html,"Spotify is in advanced talks to buy the podcast studio Gimlet Media, according to two people briefed on the proposed deal, a move that could help the music streaming service improve its profit margins and reduce its dependence on the major record companies. The two people spoke Friday on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the talks publicly. Representatives of Spotify and Gimlet Media declined to comment. Since Spotify went public last year, it has increased its investment in podcasts, once a minor part of its offerings. A deal with Gimlet, the company behind popular podcasts like “StartUp,” “Reply All” and “Crimetown,” would greatly expand that portfolio. Gimlet, which was founded in 2014 by Alex Blumberg and Matthew Lieber, two veterans of public radio, has also recently moved into television production. “Homecoming,” an Amazon series starring Julia Roberts, is based on a fictional podcast from Gimlet. “We created an I.P. factory,” Mr. Lieber, the president of Gimlet, said in a recent interview with The New York Times. “We generate a lot of stories.” Spotify, which has 200 million users around the world, 87 million of whom pay for monthly subscriptions, has signed celebrities like Amy Schumer and Joe Budden to exclusive deals for podcasts, which the company promotes widely. Those shows can draw Spotify’s users to spend more and more time on the service. While music fans may revolt if a popular song or album has been held back — or “windowed” — from streaming for a few weeks, podcast listeners tend to be less bothered by such gaps. The more podcasts that Spotify’s users listen to, the less reliant the company becomes on the licenses it must regularly negotiate with the major record companies. Barry McCarthy, the company’s chief financial officer and a former finance chief at Netflix, has frequently told analysts that his goal is to improve Spotify’s profit margins. Music is by far Spotify’s greatest expense. According to its financial reports, its costs for content — which is primarily music — are equal to about 75 percent of the company’s revenue. Spotify shares have fallen about 30 percent since their peak in August. The stock closed at $137.21 on Friday, up 1.3 percent for the day. The talks were first reported by Recode. "
5c534d323a125f5075c075f3,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/arts/television/comedy-songs.html,"Are you obsessed? The comic Catherine Cohen, 27, frequently asks her audience this question, and the way she swans around the stage tells you she finds the answer self-evident. To be fair, Cohen has earned a pretty obsessed following in part because of her finely sharpened first impression, that of a preposterously preening, rigorously self-regarding, sexually arrogant diva in Lululemon leggings. But it’s when she starts singing that her act deepens, and jokes about buffoonish bravado segue into ones about vulnerability and delusion. “Boys never wanted to kiss me, so now I do comedy,” she sings, smiling. It’s her thesis statement of a song, and the refrain “Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. Look at me!” is accompanied by Norma Desmond eyes and hustling footwork. Cohen is part of a resurgence of young comics making jokes you can hum, the latest to join a long tradition that includes stars from Steve Martin to Weird Al Yankovic. These days, comics are singing almost every night of the week at intimate spaces like Union Hall, Caveat and Club Cumming, packed with the kind of 20-something audiences that New York theater has long courted (mostly unsuccessfully). Frequent programs like “Pop Show,” with the charismatic host Ziwe Fumudoh, dedicated to original comic songs, regularly draw crowds; and traditional cabaret venues like Don’t Tell Mama in Times Square have recently started weekend stand-up nights accompanied by a piano player. In her finest tune, Cohen dreams aloud about leaving the city for an ideal life upstate. It begins meditatively mundane (“Think of the Instagrams I’d take/Think of the four pages of a novel I’d read/upstate”). Then she speeds up, dancing furiously, as she spirals into a yearning moan about the joys of apple picking. Only in song does she reveal the true insecurity of her character, the comic desperation of someone whose boasting hides some conventional aspirations: getting a boyfriend and living in Beacon, which in her fevered fantasy are related. Some of the popularity of these artists, who still fall under the hopelessly vague yet somehow enduring term of alternative comedy, may be a function of the decline of contemporary musical comedy. If you’re a musically inclined comedian who grew up in the past few decades, you are more likely to have laughed at work from Flight of the Conchords or the Lonely Island than at a Broadway show. Many of these young performers appear to be artistic descendants of “Our Hit Parade,” the defunct downtown showcase where dynamic artists like Erin Markey, Cole Escola and Bridget Everett blended comedy, cabaret and the pop charts. Its end in 2012 left a vacuum that has been filled by comedy. Neal Medlyn, one of the founders of that influential show, performs in the outlandish persona of the pink onesie-wearing rapper Champagne Jerry, and at a recent performance at Joe’s Pub, he paused to ask of his own evening: “Is it a comedy show? Is it a music show? Is it a tractor pull?” Younger performers are more likely to just call themselves comics. Larry Owens, a dynamo who appeared later in this show, is a good example. He studied drama and improvisation at the Steppenwolf Theater Company in Chicago and is well versed in Stephen Sondheim. But at the moment, you are most likely to see him on a bill of stand-ups. (This may change in May, when he stars as an aspiring artist in the new musical “A Strange Loop” at Playwrights Horizons.) While Cohen’s act is more like a musical that breaks into song when the characters need to express something more emotional, Owens is at his best when he quickly jumps right into a song. Of all the comedians who sing, he has the most virtuosic voice, a powerful, nimble instrument that can inject a cover of the “Fresh Prince of Bel-Air” theme with an ominous intensity or imbue a ballad to Oprah Winfrey with the kind of gravitas that could make you weep. The pianist Henry Koperski is the connective tissue for many of the artists in this scene, including Owens and Cohen, whom he writes music for and plays alongside on Wednesdays at Club Cumming in the East Village. On a recent Wednesday, when Cohen was performing at Joe’s Pub, Matt Rogers, who also works with Koperski, substituted for her, asking the Club Cumming crowd stuffed into its long hallway of a space: “Any straight people in the audience?” When a few women shouted, he responded wryly: “No, this is like 1912. Women don’t count.” Then the room went quiet. “If you’re a straight, that’s O.K.,” he said. “Some of my best friends are straight.” He delivered a velvety-voiced, soulful breakup tune about his love for Disney World that is the funniest tribute to Orlando since “The Book of Mormon.” His songs lean on a strong premise with a twist, but end not with a hard joke, but on a delicate emotional note. At the same show, Marcia Belsky, who has written a musical version of “The Handmaid’s Tale” set in 2028 Brooklyn, sang about how annoying it is when rich people get really into nature. “Don’t stress because deep down we’re all animals,” she sang, describing a dialogue with a wealthy man. “Yes, but you’re an animal who owns a yacht.” Take away the music, and these songs could be turned into stand-up bits, though not as funny. When the joke leans on an exaggerated reaction to the ordinary, it helps to have some dramatic notes to belt out. Musical comedy may be even more popular among artists who work online since comic songs tend to go viral faster than jokes told at a microphone, which may be why musical segments Leslie Jones’s tribute to the Upper East Side last week are as integral to the mix of sketches on “Saturday Night Live” as ever. It’s also why so many musical comedians work online. Demi Adejuyigbe, an inventive writer for “The Late Late Show With James Corden,” posts pop-culture spoofs, including a spot-on Childish Gambino and an annual and increasingly elaborate re-edit of the Earth, Wind & Fire song “September.” But the artist who captures the low-rent spirit of early Bo Burnham videos best is Matt Buechele, who has a gift for spotting and lampooning musical clichés in only a few seconds at his keyboard. His impressions reflect a perceptive ear, whether for that moment in a musical right before the romantic couple break out into song or how movies remix their hit song for the end credits. Improv comedy has not been immune to this trend. Baby Wants Candy, a musical juggernaut that started in the late 1990s, now has permanent shows in Los Angeles, Chicago and New York. Its alumni have also started their own companies, including North Coast, a hip-hop improv troupe that mounts a “Hamilton”-inspired show called “Anybody” at Caveat that tells the story of a historical figure. But the most impressive improvised musical I have seen is “Your Love, Our Musical,” also at Caveat, a double act in which Rebecca Vigil and Evan Kaufman interview a couple from the audience and turn their romantic origin story into a fluidly structured, tuneful show. On the night I attended, the artists were lucky enough to find a couple who met at a rationalist association and began a polyamorous relationship. And yet, as fertile material as this may be, part of the reason crowds roar at these shows is undeniably the perceived level of difficulty. If you think improvising an entire show seems like a magic trick, doing it with a full band and jokes that rhyme is like making the Statue of Liberty disappear.

5c801f8649f0eacbf105badf,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/06/obituaries/hugh-fordin-writer-and-record-producer-is-dead-at-83.html,"Hugh Fordin, a versatile behind-the-scenes show business figure who wrote detail-filled books, including a biography of Oscar Hammerstein II, and founded a record company specializing in cast albums and other recordings related to film and theater, died on Feb. 26 at his home in Titusville, N.J. He was 83. Hannah Fordin, his grandniece, said the cause was cardiac arrest. As a record producer and executive, Mr. Fordin, working in an era when the business was increasingly geared toward youth, made sure that music from the great American songbook and from stage and movie musicals had a chance to be heard. DRG Records, which he founded in 1976 and was still presiding over at his death, released cast albums for shows like the 21st-century revivals of “Wonderful Town” and “Sweet Charity” as well as albums by singers like Barbara Cook and KT Sullivan, the “Forbidden Broadway” parody series and reissues of notable recordings from the past. His albums were nominated for numerous Grammy Awards, and he and others won a 2001 Grammy for best musical theater album for the cast recording of “The Producers,” which he made for Sony. Mr. Fordin “relentlessly sought the performers who interpreted the great American songbook best,” Cynthia Daniels, his engineer from 1985 until his death, said by email. “No other record company or producer filled this particular space for the recorded version of these timeless songs.” (DRG later became part of Entertainment One, a Toronto-based company involved in music distribution.) Mr. Fordin’s interests were also evident in his books, which included “The World of Entertainment!: Hollywood’s Greatest Musicals” (1975), later reissued as “M-G-M’s Greatest Musicals: The Arthur Freed Unit,” and “Getting to Know Him: A Biography of Oscar Hammerstein II” (1977). Both were sharply observed studies of their subjects. The first examined great musicals made under the auspices of the producer Arthur Freed, beginning with “The Wizard of Oz.” “Fordin reproduces interoffice memos, production notes, art-department blueprints and hundreds of rare photos,” Walter Clemons wrote in a review in Newsweek in 1975. “The result is one of the liveliest records of the day-by-day process of filmmaking ever published.” The Hammerstein biography was similarly rich in anecdotes. “Mr. Fordin is careful about not crediting the sentimental Mr. Hammerstein with wit and sophistication,” Mel Gussow wrote in his 1977 review in The New York Times, “but he does acknowledge his humor. When corn grew too slowly for the location filming of ‘Oklahoma!,’ Mr. Hammerstein suggested that he might have to change his lyric to ‘as low as an elephant’s toe.’” Hugh Grant Fordin was born on Dec. 17, 1935, in Brooklyn. His father, Leon, owned a luggage store in Manhattan, and his mother, Annette (Bernstein) Fordin, was a homemaker. After graduating from James Madison High School, Mr. Fordin attended Syracuse University, though he left before graduating to begin working as a theater and music producer. Among his early producing credits was “Together With Music,” a 1955 album of music from a television special starring Noël Coward and Mary Martin. That same year he produced the cast album for “Silk Stockings,” a musical comedy that starred Don Ameche and ran on Broadway for more than a year. Mr. Fordin also produced some live shows in this period, including the final concert tour of Édith Piaf in 1962 and 1963. In the late 1960s Mr. Fordin spent three years as casting director for David Merrick, the prolific and famously difficult-to-work-with Broadway producer, helping on shows like “Play It Again, Sam.” “Every one of his employees down to the switchboard operator walked on eggshells,” Mr. Fordin wrote in a letter to The Times upon Mr. Merrick’s death in 2000, “but we knew we were working for the greatest Broadway producer of our time.” As a record producer and executive, Mr. Fordin took particular joy in reissuing titles from the past, whether from the French label Disques Swing or artists like Judy Garland and Peggy Lee. And he issued new music, some of it recorded live in concert, by artists like Karen Akers, Julie Wilson, Eartha Kitt and Ms. Cook, who was a favorite. “Judy Holliday had a special singing voice, and she did an album,” he said in 2003. “And the album died. Why? Because the Judy Hollidays and the Larry Kerts and the John Raitts — they’re doing performances like what they do in the theater. It lacks intimacy. But Barbara sings as if to one or two people in their living room.” Mr. Fordin, Ms. Daniels noted, was an early adopter of CD technology, for both new work and reissues. “Hugh tried to modernize the production and availability of Broadway and Off Broadway recordings in this new format,” she said, “while maintaining the arrangements and musical integrity of the times they were born into.” In addition to his grandniece, Mr. Fordin is survived by a niece, Lynn Fordin; a nephew, Scott Fordin; and a cousin, Damon Brandt. Ms. Daniels said that Mr. Fordin was a first-class storyteller, drawing on his deep knowledge of film and theater history to put artists at ease in recording sessions. “As I worked,” she said, “usually editing and mixing, I would inevitably hear chuckling and then everyone in the room break into laughter.” "
5ca68bec49f0eacbf1f8101a,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/04/arts/design/guide-the-shed-hudson-yards.html,"Part of what makes this weekend’s official opening of the Shed so momentous is the sheer breadth of its programming. That is also what makes it a bit overwhelming. Over the course of its inaugural season, the Shed — the low-lying, eye-catching, $475-million arts center amid the towers of Hudson Yards — will present concerts by Björk, a history of African-American music and exhibitions featuring the works of emerging New York City artists. It will pair Gerhard Richter with Steve Reich, Ben Whishaw with Renée Fleming, kung fu with the songs of Sia. Here, we offer a guide to navigating the Shed, which officially opens on Friday: what’s on each floor, where to pause for a meal or a drink, and even how to get inside the building in the first place.  ENTRANCES Take your pick. The main entrance, on the south side of the building at West 30th Street, leads to the Shed’s lobby, restaurant and shop. It’s situated directly underneath the High Line. There is another entrance on the north side, facing the Hudson Yards Plaza. COAT CHECK The north entrance will take you directly here.  SUBWAY The closest line is the 7; the entrance is just north of the Shed, between 33rd and 34th Streets, on the Hudson Yards plaza. ESCALATORS These run along the south side of the building. Stairs and elevators are also available.  1. LOBBY Here you’ll find ticket sales for the Shed’s programming, along with a shop (by McNally Jackson) and Cedric’s at the Shed, a restaurant and bar by Danny Meyer’s Union Square Hospitality Group. Cedric’s will be open to the public throughout the day. 2. LEVEL 2 GALLERY Saturday through June 2, this capacious space will host “Reich Richter Pärt,” an installation that pairs the visual art of Gerhard Richter with live musical performances of original scores by Steve Reich and Arvo Pärt. The Richter-Pärt collaboration is an import from the Manchester International Festival; but Mr. Reich’s contribution, a musical analogue of Mr. Richter’s “Patterns” series, is a premiere. 3. THE McCOURT When the Shed’s signature shell is extended over the plaza, the building adds a cavernous space ideal for big concerts. (This is where Björk will perform in May.) And that’s exactly how the Shed officially opens on Friday: with the five-concert series “Soundtrack of America,” an exploration of the influence of African-American music on contemporary culture. It was conceived by Steve McQueen, will spotlight up-and-coming musicians, and runs through April 14. 4. THE PLAZA If the shell is nested over the building, however, the plaza is in the open air, and open to the public. Here the Shed has a permanent installation, Lawrence Weiner’s text-based work “IN FRONT OF ITSELF.” 5. LEVEL 4 GALLERY Opening here on Saturday, and on view through May 30, is an exhibition of new and recent work by the artist Trisha Donnelly. 6. KENNETH C. GRIFFIN THEATER Inaugurating this 500-seat space is “Norma Jean Baker of Troy,” which runs from Saturday through May 19. The genre-blurring work, by the poet Anne Carson, is a monologue for Ben Whishaw, with sung interludes by the superstar soprano Renée Fleming. 7. THE SHOPS Beyond this retail space’s razzle-dazzle are dining options from reliably talented chefs like Thomas Keller (TAK Room), David Chang (Kawi), Costas Spiliadis (Estiatorio Milos) and José Andrés (Mercado Little Spain). The Snark Park offers changing exhibitions, and more art is to be found inside Neiman Marcus (including a wall of photographs by Bill Cunningham). 8. THE VESSEL Thomas Heatherwick’s Instagram magnet requires tickets for timed entry. (They can be booked online.) It has been compared to a shawarma and a trash can; what will it look like to you? 9. EDGE The observation deck at 30 Hudson Yards — a spear-shaped cantilevered balcony that sticks out 65 feet from the skyscraper — is opening soon. 10. THE HIGH LINE Before Hudson Yards there was the High Line, designed in part by Elizabeth Diller, the same architect behind the Shed. Visitors can come and go from the elevated park, whose northernmost stretch surrounds Hudson Yards, near the Shed’s main entrance at 30th Street. "
5c535e493a125f5075c07651,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/arts/music/review-aprile-millo-zankel.html,"Irish folk songs, princess gowns, a harp and 20 bouquets: The soprano Aprile Millo’s concert on Wednesday at Zankel Hall, her first solo program in New York in 10 years, had it all, and then some. Ms. Millo, 60, who has rarely sung in public recently, says she still has her heart set on a return to the Metropolitan Opera, where she was among the reigning Verdi singers of the 1980s and ’90s. So this was something of a trial run, and for the raucously adoring audience it was an exposure to an artist — beloved as a keeper of the old-fashioned flame of Italian opera — that most people at Zankel hadn’t heard live in years. [Can the diva who once ruled the Met make a comeback?] Joshua Barone and Zachary Woolfe, two of our classical music critics, were at the event, presented by New York City Opera, and they compared notes on the unique experience. WOOLFE So this wasn’t your average song program. BARONE I couldn’t tell whether I was at a rock concert or a recital, with the cheers of “Millo, Millo!” and “We love you, Aprile!” It began with a rose thrown to the stage, and I counted no fewer than five standing ovations from her (very vocal) fans throughout the night. What throwback glamour! WOOLFE Throwback glamour, too, in her gowns, which for the first half rendered her an emerald-color, Isolde-type medieval Irish queen and, after intermission, made her a sapphire vision out of “Frozen,” complete with glittery cape. She coughed; she drank from a water bottle; she cracked jokes; she announced that she was cutting the scheduled first-act aria from “Adriana Lecouvreur” because “Anna Netrebko sang it so beautifully I’m going to leave it to her.” And the crowd ate it up. BARONE Her charisma certainly goes far, even if the banter pushed the evening to just over two and a half hours. And it made her all the more endearing that she wore reading glasses to read music from a stand, because, as she said, “Mother’s memory isn’t what it used to be.” But did you notice a disconnect between her ease speaking to the crowd and the palpable tension in the opening numbers, six Italian songs she assembled for a rough narrative about the arc of a relationship? WOOLFE I don’t like speculating about what artists are feeling, but I can imagine that, after so many years away, she was a little nervous, to say the least. So no, I didn’t think that opening set really bloomed vocally. Throughout the evening, actually, her breath wasn’t ample enough to fill out long phrases; her tone in the middle was a little grainy, the low register cloudy. But there was some big, velvety sound in what I’d call the upper-middle range, and wistful eloquence when she went soft. The traditional Irish songs were lovely; I think everyone got the poignancy of “The Kerry Dance,” “gone, like our youth, too soon.” BARONE Those four Irish tunes, delicately accompanied by the pianist Inseon Lee and the harpist Merynda Adams, were the highlight of the night, or at least when her allure as a recitalist was at its peak. Like a cabaret singer, she blended Irish-American family history and song — “The Kerry Dance” was even more moving because Ms. Millo said her mother used to sing it to her at night. In “Danny Boy,” her voice was raspy and not completely at ease in the lower range of the opening verse. But it blossomed, gloriously, into a moment out of Ms. Millo’s salad days, rising from a fine quiet into a lushly phrased climax: “I’ll be here in sunshine or in shadow.” WOOLFE I also thought there was steady passion in a set of Rachmaninoff songs, which she dedicated to the Russian baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky, who died in 2017. She offered another tribute, to old-school italianità, with a spirit-seeing monologue from Licinio Refice’s “Cecilia,” a vehicle for the great soprano Claudia Muzio. BARONE These tributes throughout the night were reminders of Ms. Millo’s former colleagues and another time, when she was the diva du jour at the Met Opera and accumulating the passionate fan base we saw screaming in support of her on Wednesday. The big question, of course, is whether — after being away from the Met for more than a decade — she’ll sing there again. WOOLFE I don’t know if that’s in the cards; the soprano-baritone duet from Act III of “Aida,” while expressive at Zankel, didn’t make me confident that there was an evening-length leading role in her voice, at least not right now. But who cares? She could bring a lot of joy to people doing concerts like this. There is clearly an audience hungry for her charm, her phrasing, her sincerity, the community she’s gathered around her. (Her encore was a singalong “O Sole Mio.”) Those things can sometimes feel missing from the New York opera scene these days, and Wednesday conjured the art form as it’s meant to be: scrappy but also transcendent, both informal and grand. And brava for that. "

5c56ee4a3a125f5075c07c94,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/03/arts/jussie-smollett-concert-attack.html,"WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. — Jussie Smollett, the singer and actor who said he was attacked by two men yelling racial and homophobic slurs, struck a defiant tone at a concert Saturday night, his first public appearance since he reported the assault last week. “I have so many words on my heart that I want to say, but the most important thing I can say is thank you so much, and that I’m O.K.,” Smollett, a star of the Fox television show “Empire,” told the sold-out crowd at the Troubadour nightclub in West Hollywood. Smollett said that although he was not yet fully healed, “I had to be here tonight.” He said he couldn’t let his attackers win, referring to them with an expletive. The crowd, which included the “Empire” co-creator Lee Daniels and Representative Maxine Waters of California, roared in approval, though Smollett quickly followed by saying, “Now let’s have a good time.” He began his set with a cover of Stevie Wonder’s “Love’s in Need of Love Today.” Throughout his hourlong performance, Smollett made clear his desire to move on from the assault. “We’re not going to harp on” what happened, he said. Other than a small mark below his right eye, he showed no signs of injury, confidently commanding the stage along with black-clad dancers and a backing band. Smollett, a vocal critic of President Trump, did not perform his most outwardly political song, “F.U.W.,” which includes lyrics like “Who got the popular vote? Was the whole thing just a joke?” The performer, who is black and publicly came out as gay in 2015, told the Chicago police that he was assaulted early Tuesday by two men who tied a rope around his neck, poured a chemical substance on him and shouted “This is MAGA country,” a reference to Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan. The Chicago police are combing through security camera footage and have identified two “potential persons of interest,” but the lack of progress in the investigation has fueled speculation online that the attack did not happen as Smollett described. The police have said they are treating the report as if it occurred and that Smollett has been cooperative. Smollett addressed that speculation on Friday and again during his performance, as well as perceived inconsistencies regarding the severity of his injuries. “There’s been a lot of stuff that’s been said about me that’s absolutely not true,” Smollett said on Saturday, reading from a crumpled piece of paper. “I was bruised, but my ribs were not cracked, they were not broken. I went to the doctor immediately.” Smollett said he was not hospitalized, and that “Above all, I fought back,” inserting an expletive. That line received the loudest cheers of the night, but the crowd was enthusiastic even before the performance began. The line for entry stretched down the street as fans waited in the rain and activists handed out pamphlets. “I don’t know why they’re here for this show,” Marlo McKinley, who bought tickets last month, said of the activists. “But the fact all this is happening, that he’s still performing, is fantastic.” Tickets for Smollett’s show were still available as of Tuesday afternoon, but they sold out within 48 hours of the assault being reported. Though a Friday meet-and-greet with fans was canceled for “security reasons,” there was no enhanced security presence at the show on Saturday aside from a pair of officers from the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department. Several members of the Troubadour’s security team said the venue had not hired additional security for the event. Some attendees said they had bought tickets in a show of solidarity but left feeling energized by Smollett’s message and music. “I don’t watch ‘Empire,’ I hadn’t listened to his music, but I really wanted to support him,” one of them, Chris Katrandjian, said after the show. “The strength he exhibited was not only admirable, it was inspiring.” Another attendee, Royce Johnson, said he had found Smollett’s show uplifting. “As gay men, there is a proclivity to be victimized in many ways, and it’s part of our active narrative,” he said. “But watching what he did tonight, it left me feeling empowered.” "

The company boasted creativity, musicality and frugality, but it still failed to survive — shutting its doors amid a sea of red ink. Now its founder, Neal Goren, is back in business — thanks to an unusual collaboration between his new company, Catapult Opera, and Peak Performances at Montclair State University, which will present four of Catapult’s productions, beginning with the premiere of a new Robert Wilson staging of Menotti’s “Amahl and the Night Visitors” in the fall of 2020. The collaboration promises to bring an important artistic voice back to the region, and to offer hope of a financially viable model for Mr. Goren to continue putting on chamber opera. Jedediah Wheeler, the executive director of Peak Performances, said he had long admired Mr. Goren’s “tremendous imagination and gumption,” and added that the new partnership dovetails with his vision of universities as incubators of new work. “For lack of a better term, the Medicis of our time are at the universities,” he said. Mr. Goren, who was also Gotham’s conductor and artistic director, said he had pored over the company’s old financial statements to see where he could find savings. “The biggest expense after payroll was real estate, basically: performance space, rehearsal space and office space,” he said. “I thought, how can we reduce that?” With the new partnership, Peak Performances will underwrite four productions over two seasons, covering the cost of the productions, providing spaces for rehearsal and performance, and taking care of marketing. Mr. Goren, who will conduct the works, said that the shows would be designed to be tour-ready. Peak Performances had already been making plans to stage the new Wilson “Amahl” before the Catapult deal took shape. But Mr. Goren said that he had long been an admirer of the opera, and of Mr. Wilson, and looked forward to it. The remaining three productions were chosen in part to reflect the partnership’s dedication to racial, gender and cultural diversity. In the spring of 2021, Catapult will give the United States premiere of “La Ville Morte,” by the influential French composer, conductor and teacher Nadia Boulanger, written with Raoul Pugno to a libretto by Gabriele d’Annunzio. The opera, directed by Robin Guarino, will feature a new chamber orchestration by Stefan Cwik and Joseph Stillwell. The following fall, the company will perform David Hertzberg’s “The Wake World,” which had its premiere at Opera Philadelphia in 2017, in a new production by Mary Birnbaum. (Before Gotham closed, it had awarded Mr. Hertzberg, whose music Mr. Goren described as “wildly ecstatic and erotic,” a prize and commission that it could not see through.) And in 2022, Catapult will give the United States premiere of Errollyn Wallen’s 2007 opera “The Silent Twins,” staged by Charlotte Braithwaite. Mr. Wheeler, who has made Peak Performances one of the most vital performance series in the region, said he was pleased that the collaboration would give Mr. Goren a home, and that he hoped it would attract new audiences to opera, beginning with the students at Montclair State. He recalled the shock of his own first experience with opera: “Amahl and the Night Visitors,” which was commissioned by NBC for television. “I think about it to this day,” he said. “I remember plunking down in front of a black-and-white television set, and seeing something I had no reference for, and being completely drawn into it. I would bet that I didn’t even know that it was called opera.” "
5c6d96023a125f5075c0aa2a,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/20/arts/music/met-opera-season-netrebko-yannick-nezet-seguin.html,"A harrowing new staging of Berg’s “Wozzeck.” The return of the bass-baritone Bryn Terfel, after eight years, in Wagner’s “Der Fliegende Holländer.” And the company’s first regular Sunday matinees. Those are among the highlights of the Metropolitan Opera’s 2019-20 season, announced on Wednesday. There will be five new productions, including the “Wozzeck,” which will be conducted by Yannick Nézet-Séguin in his second season as Met music director, and the “Fliegende Holländer,” directed by François Girard. The other new productions? Something old (Handel’s 1709 “Agrippina,” coming to the Met for the first time) and something new (Philip Glass’s 1984 “Akhnaten,” also new to the company). Something borrowed (Phelim McDermott’s “Akhnaten” staging first appeared in London and Los Angeles) and something, well, blue: the Gershwins’s “Porgy and Bess,” starring Eric Owens and Angel Blue, will open the season on Sept. 23. New Year’s Eve, in recent years the occasion for a new production of a full work, will bring a Puccini gala — an act each from three operas — featuring Anna Netrebko. She’s not the only diva on offer: Joyce DiDonato stars in “Agrippina,” Sonya Yoncheva in Puccini’s “Manon Lescaut,” Jamie Barton in Gluck’s “Orfeo ed Euridice” and Diana Damrau in Donizetti’s “Maria Stuarda.” There are 25 productions total, and you probably can’t see them all. So what to choose? Our critics and writers zero in on the highlights. Though Gershwin called his music-theater classic a “folk opera,” I find it more and more simply a great opera, period. James Robinson’s staging has a superb cast and David Robertson conducting. When I saw this production at the English National Opera in London, technical glitches forced makeshift changes to some scenes. I can’t wait to see it properly. ANTHONY TOMMASINI When Anna Netrebko first took on Verdi’s  murderously ambitious Lady Macbeth a few years ago, critics declared it one of her greatest roles. Her vocal power is a given, but Ms. Netrebko also reveals the instability simmering beneath the power hunger. With the irrepressible Plácido Domingo in the title role (relieved, in some performances, by Zeljko Lucic) and Marco Armiliato conducting, this revival, opening on Sept. 25, promises to be one of the season’s early hits. CORINNA da FONSECA-WOLLHEIM This Orientalist potboiler may be known chiefly for the sweeping tenor aria “Nessun dorma,” but this season its leading ladies are the draws. With Christine Goerke (in an October run) and Nina Stemme (in April) sharing the title role, it’s a tag team of turbocharged dramatic sopranos. Mr. Nézét-Séguin, Mr. Armiliato and Carlo Rizzi take the podium. CORINNA da FONSECA-WOLLHEIM The Met has come slowly to the works of Mr. Glass, but Mr. McDermott’s imaginative, mesmerizing staging of “Satyagraha,” in 2008, was one of the company’s recent landmarks. This director returns on Nov. 8 with an “Akhnaten” of thrift store glamour, starring the countertenor Anthony Roth Costanzo and conducted, in her Met debut, by Karen Kamensek. JOSHUA BARONE The Norwegian soprano Lise Davidsen, 32, burst onto the scene a couple of years ago with commanding performances as Strauss’s Ariadne. The Met, historically sometimes slow to grab rising European stars, should be commended for engaging her so quickly, for a revival of Tchaikovsky’s surreal, stirring opera opening Nov. 29 — conducted, in another company debut, by Vasily Petrenko. ZACHARY WOOLFE Updated to the eve of World War I and deftly toggling between wit and heartbreak, this Robert Carsen production was a revelation for me when it was new in 2017. Now I’m eager to hear the score in the hands of Simon Rattle, returning to the Met on Dec. 13 after a riveting “Tristan und Isolde” in 2016. His cast includes Camilla Nylund as the Marschallin, Magdalena Kozena as Octavian, Golda Schultz as Sophie and Günther Groissböck reprising his scene-stealing turn as Baron Ochs. MICHAEL COOPER When I saw it at the Salzburg Festival in 2017, William Kentridge’s Berg staging struck me as his finest opera production yet. It has his antic visual trademarks — jittery action and flickering projections reminiscent of the grotesque battlefield prints of Otto Dix and George Grosz — but was notably humane and emotionally true. Elza van den Heever and Peter Mattei star at the Met beginning Dec. 27; for the first time since the 1980s, the gorgeously influential score will be conducted by someone besides James Levine. ZACHARY WOOLFE Opening Jan. 25, Robert Lepage’s staging of this singular take on the Faust legend — not quite oratorio, not quite opera — is a little busy and reliant on multimedia effects for narrative drive. But the draw here is Berlioz’s magnificent score, by turns heavenly and hellish, as well as performances by Bryan Hymel in the title role (though recent cancellations make his appearance a question mark) and the gifted comic Ildar Abdrazakov as Méphistophélès. JOSHUA BARONE A welcome commitment from the Met to a Baroque repertoire that it can serve better. David McVicar’s well-traveled production dates back to Brussels in 2000, but it is also one of this house standby’s more interventionist stagings, and should be particularly vivid opening Feb. 6 with a cast built around Ms. DiDonato singing the title role, alongside Kate Lindsey as Nerone, Iestyn Davies as Ottone, Brenda Rae as Poppea and Matthew Rose as Claudio. Harry Bicket, experienced in Handel, conducts. DAVID ALLEN Mr. Girard’s post-apocalyptic production of Wagner’s “Parsifal” for the Met was bleakly somber, mysterious and haunting. It will be fascinating to see his take on this earlier work, with Mr. Terfel in the title role, Anja Kampe as Senta and the always exciting (if always unpredictable) Valery Gergiev conducting, starting March 2. ANTHONY TOMMASINI Janacek’s earthy, poignant, sophisticated but accessible operas have been Met highlights almost whenever they’ve appeared. The season ends in May with just three performances, the first in 15 years, of Jonathan Miller’s production of this rending work, starring Susanna Phillips in the title role, and, in his Met debut, Pavel Cernoch. Lothar Koenigs, acute at the Met leading “Lulu,” conducts. SETH COLTER WALLS "
5c6190b73a125f5075c0916a,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/11/obituaries/nancy-b-reich-dead.html,"Nancy B. Reich, whose seminal 1985 biography of Clara Schumann established her as an important musical figure independent of her husband, the composer Robert Schumann, and helped turn the musicological spotlight on female composers, died on Jan. 31 in Ossining, N.Y. She was 94. Her death was confirmed by her daughter, Susanna Reich. Throughout her career, Dr. Reich fought to redress belittling portraits of Clara Schumann by earlier authors and to have her recognized as a significant composer, pianist and educator, as well as a central figure of German Romanticism. The decades that followed the publication of her book, “Clara Schumann: The Artist and the Woman,” vindicated her efforts with an explosion of both public and scholarly interest. Doctoral dissertations, anthologies and histories of music by women proliferated. Scholarly editions of Clara Schumann’s music for piano appeared, fueling an increase in performances. Dr. Reich’s death coincided with the beginning of a yearlong festival in Leipzig, Germany, for the bicentennial of Clara Schumann’s birth there. She died in 1896 and left behind compositions including songs, works for solo piano, chamber music and a piano concerto. But when Dr. Reich first turned her attention to the subject in the 1970s, Clara Schumann was noted primarily for her relationships with men. These included her father, the stern pedagogue Friedrich Wieck, who groomed her for pianistic stardom from an early age; her husband, with whom she had eight children before his death in a mental institution in 1856; and Brahms, with whom she came to be bound by a love that was deep but probably platonic. In her book, Dr. Reich relegated the Brahms strand of the story to a single chapter. “It was a most significant chapter, to be sure,” she wrote in her introduction, “but it was not the consuming central relationship that so many people have suspected.” Her take was a far cry from the “example of noble, pure and true womanhood” that the first biography, completed in 1908, made her out to be. A typical assessment of her status was found in John N. Burk’s “Clara Schumann: A Romantic Biography” (1940), which prized Robert’s work over Clara’s career as a touring virtuoso, even though she made much more money through her concertizing than he did with his compositions. For Mr. Burk, Robert was “an artist for eternity” while Clara was “a concert-giver for the moment.” The musicologist Judith Tick said in a telephone interview that Clara Schumann “was seen primarily as a muse,” adding: “Her life was assumed to pivot between two poles, Robert Schumann and Johannes Brahms. And Nancy’s book destroyed that, while tempering the sensationalist assumptions about Clara Schumann and Brahms.” Nancy Bassen was born on July 3, 1924, in the Bronx to Hyman Bassen, a writer and labor activist, and Ida (Orland) Bassen. After Hyman’s death in 1931 the family moved to Ithaca, N.Y., where Nancy’s brother, Jonas, was a student at Cornell University. Ida ran a boardinghouse for Jewish and black students who were not welcome in college dorms. After the family moved back to New York City, Nancy attended the High School of Music and Art, where she played violin and viola. She obtained a bachelor’s degree in music at Queens College in 1945, the same year she married Haskell Aaron Reich, who later became a physicist. Dr. Reich’s husband died in 1983. Her longtime companion, the biochemist Maurice M. Rapport, died in 2011. In addition to her daughter, a children’s book author, her survivors include a son, Matthew, and three grandchildren. In a telephone interview, Susanna Reich said her mother’s ambitions for an academic career had been cut short after she completed a master’s at Columbia University’s Teachers College in 1947. When she applied for a doctoral program at Columbia, her daughter said, “the interviewer asked her if she was married, and when she said yes, the interviewer told her to go home and take care of her husband.” Finally, in 1972, when Dr. Reich was 47, she obtained her Ph.D. from New York University. Buoyed by the women’s movement and intrigued by a stash of letters she came across, she dove into the life of Clara Schumann. Her research often took her behind the Iron Curtain, since many collections of documents were kept in what was then East Germany. “She had to register at every police station in every town she went to,” Ms. Tick, the musicologist, said. The sources themselves called for psychological detective work. While Clara Schumann left copious letters and diaries, many of those from her childhood were supervised, or even written, by her father. As a married couple, Robert and Clara kept a joint diary. In her work Dr. Reich collaborated with a psychoanalyst, Anna Burton, in reconstructing the picture of a musician who was as conscious of her exceptional status as she was conflicted about it. “It’s a very modern story,” Dr. Reich said in an interview with The New York Times in 1996. “Here was a girl growing up with a working mother who was taken care of by a maid, a child of divorced parents. She was left a widow at 36, but she was very independent and refused all loans. When Robert was sick, she went back to the concert stage to pay for his medical bills. She was a working woman. She worked with her hands.” Dr. Reich taught at New York University and Queens and Manhattanville Colleges and was a visiting professor at Bard and Williams. She never won tenure, even though her book, revised in 2001 and translated into German, Japanese, Hebrew and other languages, was well received. Liane Curtis, a musicologist studying the English composer Rebecca Clarke and the president of the Women’s Philharmonic Advocacy, said in a phone interview that it was Dr. Reich who gave her the idea that “having a woman as a subject was worth devoting a big portion of your life to.” "
5c8b5bdf49f0eacbf105d355,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/15/arts/music/christine-goerke-soprano-wagner-ring-met-opera.html,"Christine Goerke, who is getting ready to join the long, storied line of Brünnhildes who have scaled Wagner’s epic “Ring” cycle at the Metropolitan Opera, walked into Valhalla. No, not the majestic castle in the sky where her character, a Valkyrie warrior, brings slain heroes to serve her father, the mighty god Wotan. This Valhalla is a bar in Hell’s Kitchen, a few blocks south of the Met, that bills itself as “craft beer heaven.” “I’m going to be a total jerk and have sparkling water,” Ms. Goerke said at the bar, bowing to the coming marathon she faces in rehearsing and performing one of the toughest assignments in opera: her first complete “Ring” cycle, a sprawling 17-hour, four-opera saga of gods, dwarfs, giants and humans that she will star in between March 25 and May 11. “But on May 12, I’m getting so drunk — having all of the things.” It’s a triumphant return to the opera house where Ms. Goerke trained as an insecure young artist in the 1990s. When she sang the small role of the Third Norn in “Götterdämmerung,” the fourth “Ring” opera, at the Met in 2000, she recalled, she would linger in the wings after her exit, watching the soprano singing Brünnhilde and thinking: “Some day.” Now that day is here. “I think if you talk to anyone who’s ever been a young artist in any house, it’s always hard to come back and feel like a grown-up,” Ms. Goerke said over her seltzer, remembering her young fears that she had not trained at the fanciest conservatories. “I’m going to be 50, and I still feel like I’m 24.” “But then you wander out to get a cup of coffee,” she added, “and you go across the street and there’s a gigantic banner of yourself hanging on the side of the building — which is beyond freaky.” Raised on Long Island, Ms. Goerke overcame her self-doubt to achieve success singing Mozart and Handel. Then catastrophe struck, in the form of a vocal crisis that nearly led her to quit opera. The problem, she found, was that her voice had grown too large for the roles she had been singing. She slowed down, retrained, and re-emerged, against the odds, as one of the leading dramatic sopranos in the world — singing the heavy, nearly impossible-to-cast Wagnerian parts that she sometimes calls “the ‘spear and magic helmet’ ladies,” borrowing a line from the classic Bugs Bunny “Kill the Wabbit” parody. “People can’t get over the sheer power of the voice — and I don’t mean only the volume,” said Alexander Neef, the general director of the Canadian Opera Company in Toronto, where she sang her first staged Brünnhildes. “It’s the communicative power. It’s not only that she hits all the notes and she hits them powerfully. It’s that there’s always an element of storytelling that really allows her to connect with the audience.” Great Wagnerian sopranos are few and far between. Only one or two may emerge each generation with the power to be heard over some of the largest orchestras in all of opera without amplification, the precision to hit the high notes, and the artistry to break your heart. Ms. Goerke’s success has been big news in the opera world, which is usually grateful for singers who can merely get through such parts relatively unscathed. And the Met “Ring” will be her biggest test yet. A larger-than-life personality with an irreverent streak — imagine a cross between the great Swedish soprano Birgit Nilsson and Tina Fey — she works hard and plays hard. While singing Brünnhilde last fall in Wagner’s “Siegfried” at the Lyric Opera of Chicago, she and her Wotan, the bass-baritone Eric Owens, dressed up for Halloween as the animated superheros of “The Incredibles.” Last month, while starring at the Canadian Opera Company in the title role of Strauss’s “Elektra” — a princess obsessed with avenging the murder of her father — Ms. Goerke gamely joined an online video lip-syncing contest, known as the Dubsmash challenge, between her Toronto colleagues and the cast of another “Elektra” running at the same time in Chicago. Her song? “Daddy’s Girl.” Some find it all a bit much. Others see it as a welcome antidote to opera’s reputation for being elitist or snobby. “I got into it with one of my colleagues a little bit, who was like, ‘I feel like that’s dumbing down things,’” Ms. Goerke recalled. “And I was like, ‘I think it’s fun.’ And you know, it’s not 1945, and things are different. People are always trying to talk about how to make opera more accessible. And I feel like the way to make it more accessible is to let folks know that it is accessible. It’s not the thing that’s stuffy, and for your grandparents.” In person Ms. Goerke comes across as warm, funny and unpretentious — the kind of diva you would like to get a beer, or sparkling water, with. And her unusually frank, often humorous social media accounts offer glimpses into what it’s really like to be a 21st century opera star, which rarely bears much resemblance to popular pearls-and-furs prima donna stereotypes. Sometimes she shares her hacks for life on the road: She travels with her own spices to cut the expense of stocking a kitchen in each new city, and always packs a supply of stick-on hooks that allow her to rig curtains in rental apartments lacking blinds. And she occasionally shares details of her home life in New Jersey, where she lives with her husband, who works in construction, and their daughters, who are 9 and 12. (Her Twitter biography describes her as a “Dramatic Soprano and Soccer Mom...not necessarily in that order.”) In a burst of enthusiasm for her first “Ring,” she recently got vanity license plates for her 2004 Honda Element with 130,000 miles on it: GRANE19, after Brünnhilde’s trusty horse, Grane. Brünnhilde is, in many ways, the hero of the “Ring.” She defies the gods, falls in love with a heroic dragon-slayer and ultimately redeems the world through love before immolating herself. She appears in the final three of the cycle’s four operas — “Die Walküre,” “Siegfried” and “Götterdämmerung” — and although Ms. Goerke has sung them each individually, this will be her first time performing them together in complete cycles, as Wagner intended. “Ring” cycles tend to draw Wagner fans from around the world, who can be as obsessive as Deadheads. This one will likely draw plenty of critics, who will be measuring her performance against the legendary Brünnhildes of the past, as well as some of her old friends from Patchogue-Medford High School on Long Island, where she once played in the band. All will be listening to hear whether Ms. Goerke lives up to her potential. She has surpassed expectations before. Patrick Summers, the artistic and music director of the Houston Grand Opera, conducted some of her earliest successes in Mozart and Handel. He remembered how devastated she was 15 years ago when those of kinds of roles were no longer comfortable for her. Her decision to reinvent herself was initially met with skepticism: When Mr. Summers cast her in Wagner’s “Lohengrin” in Houston in 2009, he recalled, “I had some of my colleagues tell me it was crazy to think such a thing.” But she triumphed, and he invited her back — as Brünnhilde. “She so connects to Brünnhilde, because she’s a warrior herself,” he said. Andris Nelsons, who conducted her in breakout performances of Strauss’s “Elektra” at the Royal Opera House in London and with the Boston Symphony Orchestra (including at a searing Carnegie Hall performance in 2015), said he was awed by her ability to sing with power, but also with chamber-music-like intimacy — and by her dramatic intensity. “She lives on the stage, she loves on the stage, she hates on the stage,” he said. “It’s breathtaking.” Mr. Neef said that Ms. Goerke was the only singer he had ever cast based on a video — after watching a recording of an “Elektra” she had sung in Madrid in 2011. “I went into my artistic administrator’s office, and said you have to hire Christine for all three Brünnhildes right away,” he said. “Because if we wait, other people will figure it out, too.” They did. When Peter Gelb, the Met’s general manager, heard the frenzied ovation after Ms. Goerke sang the Dyer’s Wife in Strauss’s “Die Frau Ohne Schatten” staged there in 2013, he immediately offered her this season’s “Ring.” It is as formidable an assignment as opera offers, yet as she unwound at Valhalla — the bar, that is — she was already thinking about what comes next: She is studying the score of Wagner’s “Tristan und Isolde,” perhaps the only work that matches the “Ring” in its demands on its lead singers. “That’s my Everest at the moment,” Ms. Goerke said.

5c605fff3a125f5075c08f62,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/10/style/grammys-red-carpet.html,"The Grammy Awards, music’s biggest party, are taking place tonight in Los Angeles, with Alicia Keys, a 15-time Grammy winner, as the host. In the year since the last awards, which came under fire for not representing many female artists in its nominees, the Grammys have restructured the membership and nominations process in an effort to be more fair. Cardi B, who is nominated for five awards and will perform tonight, arrived with her husband Offset looking like a real-life version of Sandro Botticelli’s The Birth of Venus. She wore a vintage dress from Mugler’s 1995 couture collection with strings of pearls wrapped around her neck, waist and in a cone-shaped headpiece. The extravagant look was not out of the ordinary for Cardi B. She recently appeared on the cover of Harper’s Bazaar and inside its glossy pages as a modern fairy-tale heroine, and she wore a 30-pound pearl-encrusted dress to the Met Gala last year. Lady Gaga showed up in a glittering strapless Celine by Hedi Slimane dress. And Dua Lipa, who is nominated for best new artist, arrived in a silver, skintight dress that matched her nails, which were dripping with charms.  Camila Cabello, who performed the opening number, Kacey Musgraves and BTS all stopped for conversations with Ryan Seacrest. Ms. Cabello, who wore a shimmering pink dress, said: “The performance is based off of my grandma’s childhood.” BTS said they stayed up all night before their flight to Los Angeles working on their new album. The Backstreet Boys arrived together; the group has been nominated eight times before. (This year they are nominated for best pop duo/group performance for the single “Don’t Go Breaking My Heart.”) Though they have been a famous unit for 26 years now, the band members said they are able to live their lives as normal dads. “We go grocery shopping,” Nick Carter said. “We carpool,” Kevin Richardson added. Dolly Parton, who was honored in a tribute performance, wore a red dress with a bejeweled T-shaped collar. Mr. Seacrest asked if Ms. Parton ever puts on a disguise and sneaks into Dollywood, the amusement park that she owns. Ms. Parton answered: “No, but I close the park down sometimes to sneak in.” One notable absence from the red carpet was Ariana Grande. Ms. Grande tweeted on Thursday that she would not be performing at the ceremony because Ken Ehrlich, the producer of the Grammys, had stifled her creativity and self-expression in limiting what was possible for her performance. (Mr. Ehrlich told The Associated Press that she was not performing because she had not prepared something in time for the show.) The Grammys red carpet has a history of delivering outrageous sartorial concoctions. It is where Jennifer Lopez debuted her low-slung Versace dress and where Rihanna strutted in a bubble-gum-pink Giambattista Valli puff. This year’s carpet delivered its own memorable moments, with Cardi B’s Venus on the half-shell get-up, Janelle Monáe’s structured Jean Paul Gaultier dress with oversize shoulders and Jada Pinkett Smith’s long feather train.

5c7d718749f0eacbf105b470,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/04/arts/music/oscars-star-is-born-billboard-chart.html,"Four months after it last topped the Billboard album chart, Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper’s soundtrack to “A Star Is Born” has returned to No. 1 for a fourth time, thanks to the Academy Awards — and some deep-discount pricing on Amazon. “A Star Is Born” was up for eight Oscars on Feb. 24, including best picture, and best actor and actress for Cooper and Lady Gaga. It took home one, best original song, for “Shallow” — which Cooper and Lady Gaga performed on the show, sitting cheek to cheek at the piano. That publicity certainly helped the soundtrack reach No. 1. But so did an Amazon promotion offering downloads of the album at $3.99, which Lady Gaga made sure her 78 million Twitter followers knew about. (A further discount, to $2.99, was moot as far as the chart was concerned; according to Billboard’s rules, only sales made at $3.49 or more count toward an album’s chart position.) “A Star Is Born” ended last week with the equivalent of 128,000 sales in the United States — up about 150 percent from the week before — which included 76,000 copies sold as a full album and nearly 41 million streams, according to Nielsen. That success bumped Ariana Grande’s “Thank U, Next” to No. 2 after two weeks at the top, with the equivalent of 116,000 sales, including 127 million streams but just 19,000 copies sold as a full album. Also this week, two Atlanta rappers reached high positions with brand-new releases: Gunna opened at No. 3 with “Drip or Drown 2,” and Offset, from Migos, landed at No. 4 with his first solo album, “Father of 4.” The soundtrack to the Freddie Mercury biopic “Bohemian Rhapsody” — Queen, his band, opened the Oscars show, with the singer Adam Lambert — is in fifth place.

5c2fdae23a125f5075c02e98,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/obituaries/dean-ford-dead.html,"Dean Ford, vocalist for the Scottish band the Marmalade, whose voice was heard around the world on the group’s biggest hit, “Reflections of My Life,” died on Monday in Los Angeles. He was 72. His daughter, Tracey McAleese Gorman, said the cause was complications of Parkinson’s disease. Mr. Ford had a heady decade in the 1960s and early ’70s as the Marmalade (which eventually dropped its “the”) had hits in Britain and elsewhere in Europe, then grew even bigger with “Reflections,” a somber ballad in which the singer examines the world around him with dismay but also a glimmer of something positive. “The world is a bad place, a bad place, a terrible place to live,” sang Mr. Ford, who wrote “Reflections” with his bandmate Junior Campbell. “Oh, but I don’t want to die.” The song reached Billboard’s Top 10 in May 1970 after achieving even greater success in Britain. Fame, though, proved hard to handle for Mr. Ford, who left the group in the mid-1970s and struggled with alcoholism. In 1986 he sought help from Alcoholics Anonymous. One of his subsequent jobs was driving a limousine in Los Angeles, and his passengers included celebrities like Jane Wyman, Michael Jackson and Bob Dylan. But, he told The Scottish Mail in 2015, he never told passengers that he was once a celebrity too. “You’re not supposed to do that when you’re driving,” he said. “They don’t want to hear it. If it gets back to the guy who owns the company, you’re gone.” Mr. Ford, though, never lost his desire to perform. A subdued version of “Reflections of My Life” recorded in 2014 has been viewed more than two million times on YouTube. Last year Mr. Ford released “This Scottish Heart,” a 30-track, two-disc album. “Music was his life, music inspired him, music was everything to him,” his daughter said in a telephone interview. “He wasn’t just a lead singer; he loved playing the guitar, and he played it to my son, and at family gatherings, barbecues. He wouldn’t go anywhere without it.” Dean Ford was his stage name. He was born Thomas McAleese on Sept. 5, 1946, in Airdrie, Scotland, to Thomas and Elizabeth McAleese (although sources say he was born in 1945). He grew up in neighboring Coatbridge and left school at 16 to join a band called the Cravats. In 1963 he was recruited to front another band, the Gaylords, but decided his name needed sprucing up. “I thought about Dean Martin and Tennessee Ernie Ford,” he told The Mail, “and put them together.” The group became Dean Ford and the Gaylords. Known for close harmonies, the band, renamed the Marmalade at the suggestion of its record company, had modest success in 1967 with “I See the Rain,” then hit it big the next year with a cover of the Beatles’ “Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da” that went to the top of the British charts. The group toured with the Who and other leading acts of the day, immersed in the wild side of rock ’n’ roll. Mr. Ford said he avoided drugs for the most part but was derailed by alcohol. He had married Janeanne McBaine in 1968, but the marriage broke up. In addition to his daughter, he is survived by a sister, Liz Carson. After leaving Marmalade, Mr. Ford also left Britain for the United States. “I wanted to start over,” he said in a 1998 interview. “I wanted a new life. The trouble was, I brought myself with me.” At one of his favorite watering holes, another regular was a woman who often arrived at the bar beaten and bloody. One day she stopped coming, and he assumed the worst. “But then she turned up, and the change in her was stunning,” he said. She told her old drinking partners that she had gone to A.A. for help. “I think God sends us a message when we’re ready to hear it,” Mr. Ford said. “I was ready to hear it then.” "
5c4c417d3a125f5075c0674b,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/26/obituaries/michel-legrand-dead.html,"Michel Legrand, the invariably romantic pianist, arranger and composer of hundreds of film scores and songs that have became pop hits and love anthems, died on Saturday. He was 86. His death was confirmed on the artist’s official Facebook page by his management team. Over a career of more than 60 years, Mr. Legrand collaborated onstage, onscreen and in the studio with dozens of celebrated musicians of his era, from Miles Davis to Perry Como, Stéphane Grappelli to Liza Minnelli. A three-time Academy Award winner and five-time Grammy winner — he was nominated for a total of 13 Oscars and 17 Grammys — Mr. Legrand made the love song his métier. Among his better-known compositions are “The Windmills of Your Mind” from “The Thomas Crown Affair” (1968), which won the Oscar for best song; “The Summer Knows,” the theme from “Summer of ’42” (1971) (Mr. Legrand won an Oscar for the movie’s score); and the Oscar-nominated “What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?” from the film “The Happy Ending” (1969). All three were written with the lyricists Alan and Marilyn Bergman. His recording of “Brian’s Song,” his theme from the TV movie of the same name, made the Billboard pop chart in 1972, peaking at No. 56. Other standards of the Legrand canon include “I Will Wait for You” and “Watch What Happens,” both from “The Umbrellas of Cherbourg” (1964), the writer-director Jacques Demy’s musical tale of star-crossed love. (Norman Gimbel wrote the English lyrics.) A pop opera whose entire story was sung, “Umbrellas” first brought Mr. Legrand’s talents to the attention of American moviegoers and earned him a devoted following in the United States. He also scored Mr. Demy’s follow-up, “The Young Girls of Rochefort,” which included spoken dialogue as well as songs and which, like “Umbrellas,” starred the up-and-coming Catherine Deneuve. On the occasion of the 2009 British rerelease of “Rochefort,” Mr. Legrand told Time Out London of meeting Mr. Demy. “I just finished scoring a François Reichenbach movie called ‘America as Seen by a Frenchman,’” he recalled. “Demy loved the score, so we met and he wanted me to score his first movie, which was called ‘Lola.’ So then I scored ‘Lola’ and we became friends and we came to know, appreciate and love each other, and we stayed friends until the very last.” Mr. Demy, who died in 1990, was married to the filmmaker Agnès Varda, with whom Mr. Legrand also worked extensively. He even appeared onscreen, as a pianist, in her 1962 film, “Cleo From 5 to 7.” Among Mr. Legrand’s other notable compositions was “Papa, Can You Hear Me?” from the Barbra Streisand film “Yentl” (1983), also written with the Bergmans. He received three Oscar nominations for his work on that film, and won for its score. In 2018, he composed music for “The Other Side of the Wind,” a lost film by Orson Welles, whose “F for Fake” he had scored in 1973. Although Mr. Legrand composed far less for the theater than he did for film and television, he was nominated for Tony and Drama Desk awards for the show “Amour,” although it ran for only 17 performances on Broadway in 2002. He also wrote the music for “Marguerite,” a musical that had a brief run in London in 2008 whose creative team also included the writers and lyricists of “Les Misérables” and “Miss Saigon.” Mr. Legrand recorded more than 100 albums, with such disparate stars as Maurice Chevalier (for whom he worked as an accompanist early in his career), Kiri Te Kanawa, Sarah Vaughan, Lena Horne and Barbra Streisand. Others who recorded his music ranged from Frank Sinatra to Sting. Mr. Legrand celebrated over 50 years in show business in 2010 with a concert at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas that featured Dionne Warwick, George Benson, Melissa Manchester, Patti Page and Jennifer O’Neill (the star of “Summer of ’42”). He observed his 80th birthday in 2012 by beginning a world tour that included performances in France, Ireland, Japan, Argentina, Brazil, Russia, Denmark and the Netherlands. His schedule last year included performances in London, New York and Tokyo, and he was planning to tour again in 2019. Michel Jean Legrand was born on Feb. 24, 1932, in Bécon-les-Bruyères, a suburb of Paris, to a French father, Raymond Legrand, a composer and actor, and an Armenian mother, the former Marcelle der Mikaelian. From 1942 to 1949, he studied at the Conservatoire de Paris, where his teachers included the celebrated pianist Nadia Boulanger, before becoming an in-demand arranger, working for French stars like Édith Piaf and Yves Montand. In 1947, Mr. Legrand recalled in a 2011 interview, he became interested in jazz when he saw the trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie in concert in Paris (“I was ecstatic”). He would eventually work with Mr. Gillespie and other jazz greats, on albums like “Dizzy Digs Paris” (1953) and, most notably, his own “Legrand Jazz” (1958), for which he arranged well-known jazz compositions for three different groups of established musicians, one of which included Miles Davis, John Coltrane and Bill Evans. Mr. Legrand worked as an arranger with artists in various genres, including the opera singers Natalie Dessay and Anne Sofie von Otter. “While I was studying in Paris I decided that I wanted to touch on and exist within every possible musical discipline,” Mr. Legrand told Time Out London in 2009. “Concerts, records, radio, playing piano, conducting, singing, composing, classical, playing jazz. So when I started to work, it was really on that decision.” Mr. Legrand became an international sensation in 1954 with “I Love Paris,” a collection of well-known French songs, followed by “Holiday in Rome” and “Michel Legrand Plays Cole Porter.” All were hits. He was invited to the Festival of Youth and Students in Moscow in 1958, and aboard the ship from Paris to Moscow he met his future wife, Christine Bouchard, an Yves Saint Laurent model. They had three children. He would eventually marry three times, most recently in 2014 to the actress Macha Méril. Back in Paris, he began composing for film, working notably for New Wave directors like Jean-Luc Godard and later for Mr. Demy, whose “Umbrellas” earned Mr. Legrand his first three Oscar nominations. “The Young Girls of Rochefort” followed, and in 2009 Mr. Legrand was asked if that was a film of which he was particularly proud. “Yes,” he said, “but I must tell you, I’m not ashamed of anything I’ve done. All the films that I’ve done — and I’ve worked on about 250 — are like my children. So they are all special for different reasons. “But I like everything that I’ve done, and why not? I always did it with pleasure, and I did it because I wanted to do it. There is always a reason, and that is important for me.” In 1966 Mr. Legrand moved to Hollywood, where his friends and fellow composers Quincy Jones and Henry Mancini introduced him to the Bergmans. The first of his many collaborations with them was “The Thomas Crown Affair.” On the occasion of a 2010 concert at Olympia Hall in Paris, Mr. Legrand was asked by French radio whether any of his dreams had gone unfulfilled. “Off the top of my head,” he said, “I regret that I didn’t learn more languages, visit certain countries and listen to music that I don’t yet know about. In other words, there’s a whole cultural process that it’s been difficult for me to undertake because I’ve written a lot, worked, traveled, played around. So I haven’t had time to read some of the extraordinary books that I still think about.” “And then,” he added, “I would have liked to work with Judy Garland, who I nurture a mad passion for. But I was born too late. So no regrets.” "

Nipsey Hussle, born Ermias Joseph Asghedom, was pronounced dead just before 4 p.m. local time, according to the Los Angeles County Coroner. News of the 33-year-old’s death, in a shooting that left two others wounded, prompted an outpouring of support from the Los Angeles community that he championed. “Our hearts are with the loved ones of Nipsey Hussle and everyone touched by this awful tragedy,” Eric Garcetti, the mayor of Los Angeles, said in a tweet. “L.A. is hurt deeply each time a young life is lost to senseless gun violence.” The actress Issa Rae, who also grew up in South Los Angeles, expressed her admiration for the rapper on Twitter. [Update: Man suspected in Nipsey Hussle shooting is charged with murder.] “Watching Nipsey inspired me to invest and own in our communities,” Ms. Rae said. “He was a solid man who loved his woman, his family and his community. This hurts.” Of the two others wounded in the shooting, one was taken to the hospital and is in stable condition while the other suffered only a graze wound, the police said. All three were shot in the parking lot outside The Marathon Clothing, a store that Nipsey Hussle opened in 2017. The authorities had not identified a suspect or motive as of Monday afternoon. A Los Angeles fixture since the mid-2000s, Nipsey Hussle first drew widespread acclaim in hip-hop for his three-part mixtape series, “Bullets Ain’t Got No Name.” His stage name is a twist on the comedian Nipsey Russell. “Victory Lap,” his debut album, was nominated this year for best rap album at the Grammy Awards, losing to Cardi B’s “Invasion of Privacy.” “My whole energy is just at a low right now hearing this,” the rapper Drake, who collaborated with Nipsey Hussle, wrote on Instagram. “You were a real one to your people and to the rest of us. I’m only doing this here cause I want the world to know I saw you as a man of respect and a don. Rest easy my g.” Rihanna also mourned the rapper’s death on Instagram, posting photos of him with his daughter at the Grammy’s in February. “This doesn’t make any sense! My spirit is shaken by this,” she said. Nipsey Hussle had collaborated with artists including Snoop Dogg and YG, drawing from his city’s tradition of gangster rap and intricate street-level storytelling. In 2013, he created industry buzz by creating only 1,000 physical copies of his mixtape “Crenshaw,” an independent release that sold for $100 at a pop-up shop and was freely available online. He said Jay-Z bought 100 copies. “Nipsey was not only one of the greatest artists we worked with but an amazing father and leader in his community,” Nipsey Hussle’s label, Atlantic Records, said in a statement. “One of the kindest and brightest stars in the universe, he was inspiring to all.” By Monday morning, hundreds of mourners had gathered to pay their respects outside the store. Some fans prayed and cried while others laid down candles, flowers and signs to express their condolences. A steady flow of passing cars played tracks from Nipsey Hussle’s latest album. The rapper was a strong advocate for the South Los Angeles community where he was raised. In his teens, Nipsey Hussle dropped out of high school and became involved in street life as he tried to make a career in music. He identified as a member of the Rollin 60’s Crips gang, which he chalked up to history, circumstance and survival. “I’m not promoting it. I’m just speaking on it,” he said in a 2010 interview with Complex. “I’m more focused on giving solutions and inspiration more than anything.” Despite that affiliation, the rapper spoke out about gun violence and had plans to meet on Monday afternoon with representatives from Jay-Z’s Roc Nation and officials from the Los Angeles Police Department to talk about preventing gang violence, according to Steve Soboroff, the Los Angeles police commissioner. He was also an outspoken representative of the Crenshaw neighborhood and helped to promote the community’s art and culture. “From the beginning, Nipsey Hussle has been a critical part of #DestinationCrenshaw, even inspiring the name!” Marqueece Harris-Dawson, a city councilman who represents South Los Angeles, said on Instagram. “Destination Crenshaw” is a community project designed to promote black cultural history in South Los Angeles. Last year, Nipsey Hussle, who taught himself how to build computers, helped to launch a center in the Crenshaw district dedicated to connecting underrepresented groups with technology companies. “Growing up as a kid, I was looking for somebody — not to give me anything — but somebody that cared,” he told The Los Angeles Times. “Someone that was creating the potential for change and that had an agenda outside of their own self interests.” Nipsey Hussle was in a relationship with the actress and model Lauren London, with whom he had a son, Kross. He also had a daughter, Emani, from a previous relationship. Mark Ridley-Thomas, a Los Angeles County supervisor who represents South Los Angeles, said Nipsey Hussle “was a father, businessman, entertainer, and inspiration to many.” “We mourn his sudden and tragic passing and send his family our deepest condolences,” he said.

5c59f95a3a125f5075c08266,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/05/arts/music/louis-armstrong-house-museum-new-director.html,"Big changes are coming to the quiet block in Corona, Queens, where Louis Armstrong spent his last three decades. And a new artist and curator has arrived to help guide those changes. Kenyon Victor Adams will take over as director of the Louis Armstrong House Museum, effective immediately, the museum announced on Tuesday. Mr. Adams, 40, steps in as the museum works to finish construction on a 14,000-square-foot education and performance center in a lot across the street from the home, where Armstrong lived until his death in 1971. The museum also received a $1.9 million grant from New York City last year to renovate the house next door, known as Selma’s House, which will provide office and storage space for the organization. And the museum recently completed a monumental, nearly $3 million digitization process of its entire archive, making thousands of items available for listening and viewing online. That collection has long been housed at nearby Queens College, but it will move to the museum’s expanded campus in Corona when construction is completed. “The Armstrong legacy has the opportunity at this moment, with the new center, to be brought into the 21st century,” Mr. Adams said. “And I don’t think anyone is aware of just how grand and rigorous and expansive the legacy will show itself to be.” Mr. Adams comes to the museum from Grace Farms, an arts and cultural center in Connecticut, where he led its Arts Initiative. He previously studied religion and literature at Yale Divinity School, and theology of contemporary performance at the Yale Institute of Sacred Music. His artistic work includes “Prayers of the People,” an interdisciplinary work based on the writings of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and directed by Bill T. Jones. At the Armstrong house, Mr. Adams fills a role that has been vacant since the museum’s founding director, Michael Cogswell, retired last year. Mr. Adams’s goal will be to bring the house and its rich collection — which offers a deep look into Armstrong’s life through letters, reel-to-reel tapes, visual art and much more — into conversation with the neighborhood around it, as well as with a broader community of archival institutions devoted to black history. “We are in the midst of a sort of renaissance of African-American arts and letters, and diasporic arts and culture,” Mr. Adams said. “Jazz history is black history, so this is a fantastic time to take up again and repurpose — from a 21st-century perspective — this particular legacy of artistry and innovation.” Mr. Adams added: “We will now be able to pick up on the thinking of this great artist and innovator, who’s really contributed so much to American life and American identity — to what Martin Luther King would call the ‘human personality.’” "
5c60911a3a125f5075c08fa0,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/10/obituaries/ron-hutchinson-dead.html,"Ron Hutchinson, an ebullient film buff who led a campaign to restore scores of largely forgotten short sound films from the 1920s and ’30s that featured comedians, vaudevillians, opera singers and musical acts, died on Feb. 2 at his home in Piscataway, N.J. He was 67. His wife, Judy (Morton) Hutchinson, said the cause was colon cancer. United by their passion for old films and vintage music, Mr. Hutchinson and four like-minded friends created the Vitaphone Project in 1991 with an ambitious mission. They set out to preserve the one-reel shorts that Warner Bros. made under the name Vitaphone Varieties at studios in Brooklyn and Burbank, Calif., from 1926 to 1931, as Hollywood was shifting from silent movies to talking pictures like “The Jazz Singer” (1927), the first full-length talkie. Those early shorts used Vitaphone, a Bell Labs technology, which synchronized the speeds of the film projector and a turntable that played 16-inch sound discs. The challenge was to find the largely lost records that contained the voices of entertainers like George Burns and Gracie Allen, Bob Hope, Jack Benny and Rose Marie, as well as lesser-known vaudevillians like the comedy team Al Shaw and Sam Lee. Warner employed the Vitaphone system for its theatrical release of “Don Juan” (1926), a feature starring John Barrymore. But that movie had no dialogue, only music and sound effects. “It went over great, but the people loved the shorts, with people speaking,” Mr. Hutchinson, who became a historian of the era, said at a meeting of the New Jersey Antique Radio Club in 2016. So before showings of a subsequent Vitaphone feature in 1926, he said, “they had Al Jolson, Georgie Jessel and other popular performers, each in five- to ten-minuteshorts, and this just set off everything.” For Mr. Hutchinson, restoring those shorts became a delightful second career. A chemical engineer who worked for companies that specialize in environmental health and safety, he diligently searched for the sound discs through letters and emails to record collectors and relatives of the performers. He found one trove of 80 discs from the family of a man who had taken them home from the theaters he ran in Connecticut. He tracked down discs as far away as Australia and New Zealand. “The discoveries of soundtracks never seems to slow down,” he told the Chicago Film Society in an interview in 2011. “We average several hundred new soundtrack discoveries a year.” Mr. Hutchinson helped raise money for restoration of the shorts, largely through the U.C.L.A. Film & Television Archive, and Warner Bros. has released about 200 of them in various DVD sets. (He also found discs for other studios’ shorts.) For nearly a quarter-century, Mr. Hutchinson has hosted showings of the films at Film Forum in Manhattan. The cable channel TCM paid tribute to Vitaphone in 2016 with a 24-hour marathon of the shorts. “He’d call me up and say he’d restored 10 more films and we’d schedule a showing,” Bruce Goldstein, Film Forum’s director of repertory programming, said by phone. “And it was amazing stuff; he discovered vaudevillians who had been forgotten for years, like Shaw and Lee, who made the funniest short of all time, ‘The Beau Brummels.’ ” Ronald Porter Hutchinson was born on Aug. 30, 1951, in East Orange, N.J. His father, Frank, was a machinist, and his mother, Betty (Reese) Hutchinson, was a homemaker and volunteered for an organization that helped women with legal problems, especially divorces. During Mr. Hutchinson’s childhood, his interest in vintage music and early talking pictures was ignited by watching Joe Franklin’s nostalgia-fueled New York television show. As a teenager, he made films with his friends. But he followed a more practical career path, earning a bachelor’s degree in chemical engineering from the New Jersey Institute of Technology and pursuing a career in environmental safety. “When we got married, he got a Victrola, and the next thing you knew we had 20,000 78s,” his wife said in a telephone interview. “And while collecting records, he came across these huge Vitaphone discs, and he knew other collectors had them.” The Vitaphone Project was founded in Mr. Hutchinson’s house in Piscataway, which continued to be its headquarters. “We were all friends, united by what we could find — treasure hunters in a way,” said Vince Giordano, a founder of the project and the leader of the band Vince Giordano and the Nighthawks, which specializes in authentic arrangements of vintage jazz. “Ron had so much joy and exuberance in the discovery of the discs. It was almost like a hunger.” In addition to his wife, Mr. Hutchinson is survived by a daughter, Heather Miranda; a son, Jared; a grandson; and a brother, Robert. The first Vitaphone short restored thanks to Mr. Hutchinson was “Baby Rose Marie, the Child Wonder” (1929). Rose Marie, who decades later became known for her role as the wisecracking Sally Rogers on “The Dick Van Dyke Show,” was a child star who would go on to spend nearly every day of her life in show business. She was already a veteran when she sang to a Vitaphone camera. “When I first told her that we’d found the disc, she said to me that Jack Warner had told her it had been lost,” Mr. Hutchinson said in an interview in 2014 on the America’s Comedy podcast. He recalled her reaction when the short was screened in Los Angeles in 1994. “She looked at the screen — now blank — and said, ‘You know, the dress I wore was blue,’ ” he continued. “ ‘And I was looking over at the side, where my mother was.’ All these memories came rushing back to her.” "
5c72f0f23a125f5075c0b4b7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/24/arts/music/falstaff-review-met-opera.html,"To opera devotees who on principle believe that productions of a cornerstone work should be true to the original setting, I say get thee to Verdi’s “Falstaff” at the Metropolitan Opera. Robert Carsen’s 2013 production, which returned on Friday, is an exhilarating demonstration of how an insightful updating can reveal a great opera anew. From the vibrant performances of this winning cast, headed by the powerhouse baritone Ambrogio Maestri, who owns the title role, it seemed clear that the singers relished the chance this production provides to bring fresh immediacy to Verdi’s characters. Mr. Carsen sees Verdi’s bustling comic opera as overcast with melancholy. The entitled aristocracy is losing sway as new class structures allow self-made men to emerge. To bring out those resonances he shifts the Elizabethean setting to 1950s England, when an entrepreneurial population was emerging. The first scene, set in Falstaff’s room at the Garter Inn, shows the lumpy Sir John loitering in bed in a commodious oak-paneled room in a fading hotel. Room-service carts cluttered with dirty dishes are scattered everywhere. The whiny Dr. Caius (Tony Stevenson) accuses Falstaff of causing drunken chaos at his house the previous night. Falstaff’s slovenly henchmen (sung by Keith Jameson and Richard Bernstein) bicker with their boss. But when Mr. Maestri’s gigantic Falstaff finally stands up, he’s a scraggly, pathetic sight in his grimy long johns. Yes, Falstaff is a debt-ridden, self-deluded mooch. But when Mr. Maestri, in chilling voice, delivers Falstaff’s defense of his girth as an embodiment of stature and potency, you feel sympathy for this laughingstock of a knight. The second scene, in the garden of Alice Ford’s house, is shifted to a charming restaurant in Windsor where the merry wives, wearing colorful, slightly ostentatious dresses, are having a lunch date. The singers look charming and sing wonderfully: the soprano Ailyn Pérez, in plush voice as Alice; the rich-toned mezzo-soprano Jennifer Johnson Cano, a knowing Meg Page; the impressive contralto Marie-Nicole Lemieux, a plucky Mistress Quickly; and the exquisite soprano Golda Schultz, endearing as Nannetta, Alice’s daughter, who pines for young Fenton. Who is Fenton in this concept? A smitten waiter at the restaurant, here the ardent tenor Francesco Demuro. It’s perfect. My favorite scene comes at the end of Act II, when Falstaff arrives at Alice Ford’s house for what he thinks will be a secret rendezvous with her. (It’s a scam the women have concocted to teach him a lesson.) Mr. Carsen places it in a spacious Betty Crocker kitchen with bright yellow cabinets and gleaming appliances. Ms. Schultz’s Nannetta, wearing pedal-pushers and an oversized shirt, comes storming in, grabs a big bowl of Jell-O from the refrigerator, sits at the kitchen table and digs in glumly. What’s the matter? Practically crying, she says that her father (an ambitious businessman type, the robust baritone Juan Jesús Rodríguez) is going to make her marry Dr. Caius! The women just laugh: Caius? That fossil, that fool? They won’t let it happen. This staging touch brings out the feminist subtext of the opera: that for all the patriarchal bonds of society, women are ascendant and emboldening each other. The noted British conductor Richard Farnes, who was music director of Opera North in England for 12 years, led this “Falstaff” in his Met debut, with mixed results. Stretches of Verdi’s miraculous score had élan, color and clarity. But there were glitches and moments of poor ensemble. The performance may settle in. And opera lovers, especially those wary of updating, should not miss this inspired production of Verdi’s final opera. "
5c86cae449f0eacbf105c7ca,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/11/business/media/michael-jackson-music.html,"Canceling Michael Jackson, it seems, may not be so easy. Since HBO’s broadcast last week of “Leaving Neverland” — a two-part, four-hour spotlight on two men who said Mr. Jackson had abused them when they were young boys — reams of commentary have been devoted to whether fans could ever listen to “Off the Wall” or “Thriller” again in good conscience. But the numbers show that, at least so far, the popularity of Mr. Jackson’s music has not budged. Since the beginning of the year, songs from Mr. Jackson’s solo catalog have been streamed 16 million to 17 million times each week in the United States on services like Spotify, Apple Music and Tidal, according to Nielsen. Last week, including the period immediately after the documentary’s premiere on March 3 and 4, the total was 16,497,000 streams. Even the daily listening pattern did not vary since the HBO documentary was shown. On the two days of the “Leaving Neverland” premiere, a Sunday and a Monday, Mr. Jackson’s streaming numbers dipped below his typical daily average of about 2.3 million — but that was in line with the usual streaming pattern of his songs, which tends to peak in the middle of the week. In the three days after the film, those numbers climbed back up. By Thursday — the last day for which complete information is available — they had risen to 2.5 million. Particularly popular, as always, were hits like “Beat It,” “Billie Jean” and “Thriller.” A rival music data service, BuzzAngle, traced a similar pattern. According to BuzzAngle, weekly streams for Mr. Jackson this year hovered around 16 million until the middle of February, when they shot up to 22.8 million, suggesting that publicity for the documentary had stirred interest. By last week the totals had settled down, to 17.1 million. Could those numbers fall? In the days after the film, news blips suggested that Mr. Jackson’s legacy was slowly being affected. The producers of “The Simpsons” pulled a 28-year-old episode featuring Mr. Jackson’s voice from circulation. Radio stations in Canada and New Zealand said they would stop playing Mr. Jackson’s music. A statue of the star was removed from a British soccer museum. Radio stations in the United States have been cautious, significantly reducing the number of plays of Mr. Jackson’s music. According to Nielsen, Mr. Jackson’s songs have been played about 2,000 times a day on American radio stations in recent months. That number began to slip in February, and since the documentary aired it has dropped sharply, to about 1,500 a day through Sunday. “The court of public opinion seems to have convicted Michael, but at the same time, he has supporters who love him,” said David Bakula, a senior analyst at Nielsen. “For the long term, it might take two or three weeks for this to settle into a pattern.” The comedian Pete Davidson described what fans of Mr. Jackson and R. Kelly, who faces accusations of sexual misconduct with underage girls, have been wrestling with on the most recent episode of “Saturday Night Live.” “You don’t know how good someone’s music really is until you find out they’re a pedophile,” Mr. Davidson said during a “Weekend Update” segment. The recent business performance of Mr. Kelly may provide clues on how Mr. Jackson’s musical legacy may be affected by “Leaving Neverland.” Like Mr. Jackson, Mr. Kelly was tried and acquitted of sexual misconduct with minors. In early January, the popularity of Lifetime’s documentary “Surviving R. Kelly” caused a quick jump in the streams of his songs. But in the weeks since, even with frequent news developments in the Kelly story — he was dropped by RCA Records, was indicted and gave a bizarre television interview — his numbers have plummeted. In the first week of the year, Mr. Kelly had 13.2 million streams. The week after the documentary, that figure fell to 10.8 million. Over the last six weeks, his average has been about six million, and sales of his CDs and downloads have fallen by more than half. HBO’s premiere of “Leaving Neverland” drew an audience of 1.3 million, Nielsen reported. The next night, the second part had 927,000 viewers, and the Oprah Winfrey-led “After Neverland” discussion had 780,000. As of Monday, the total audience for Part 1 had risen to a healthy 3.7 million, thanks to delayed viewing on television, DVR and the HBO platforms HBO Go and HBO Now, and the second part of “Leaving Neverland” had been watched by 2.5 million viewers.

5c6e77043a125f5075c0ac21,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/reader-center/ryan-adams-investigation.html,"Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together. For nearly five months, Joe Coscarelli and Melena Ryzik, culture reporters for The New York Times, collected accounts from dozens of sources, who detailed troubling behavior by Ryan Adams, the Grammy Award-nominated singer-songwriter. They outlined a spectrum of inappropriate acts, including emotional abuse of romantic partners and explicit text-message and video-chat exchanges with a minor Mr. Adams never met in person.  In response to The Times’s investigation, several high-profile artists who had worked with Mr. Adams reacted online. Karen Elson, the model and musician, wrote on Instagram, “I also had a traumatizing experience with Ryan Adams.” (She later deleted the post.) Todd Wisenbaker, a guitarist who has worked extensively with Mr. Adams, posted a statement on Instagram with the caption: “This is incredibly hard for me to do, but Ryan, please get help.” The pop star Mandy Moore, who was once married to Mr. Adams, repeated her own allegations against him on Marc Maron’s “WTF” podcast. “We’ve seen a number of musicians or people who are in that world say, yes, I’ve had a bad experience with Ryan Adams,” said Ms. Ryzik. In the days since the article ran on Feb. 13, the reporters said they have received at least a dozen additional direct tips. On Feb. 14, the F.B.I. opened an inquiry into whether Mr. Adams’s communications with the underage fan constitute a crime. Through his lawyer, he has denied the allegations. Mr. Coscarelli and Ms. Ryzik started their reporting after two nearly simultaneous events early last October: a discussion with a source who alluded to misconduct by a musician who turned out to be Mr. Adams, and an anonymous tip delivered through The Times’s tip line that suggested looking into his treatment of women.  Mr. Coscarelli and Ms. Ryzik reached out to women known to have dated or otherwise been associated with Mr. Adams — touring with him as a supporting act, for example.  With the women who had firsthand experiences and decided that they may want to come forward as sources, “the initial interview was always an hour and a half long, at a minimum,” Ms. Ryzik said.  Over the next few months, they were in contact with those women multiple times, making several trips to Los Angeles and Ohio to speak with them in person. In some cases, sources put them in touch with other women who had stories to share. There were, Mr. Coscarelli said, “many official interviews and then hundreds of texts, emails, check-ins, quick phone calls.” In the days after publication, Ms. Ryzik estimated that she had texted with Ms. Moore six times. As they listened to the women’s experiences and gathered corroborating information from other sources, they discovered certain patterns of behavior. In relationships, Mr. Adams could be controlling: insisting that one partner, the musician Phoebe Bridgers, prove her whereabouts, for example, and threatening suicide if a woman didn’t respond to his messages immediately. In the case of the young woman who was a teenager when she developed a texting relationship with Mr. Adams, several details stuck out as especially disturbing: video calls on Skype in which he exposed himself; nicknames for her body parts. Mr. Coscarelli and Ms. Ryzik have worked on several articles about sexual abuse, separately and together. One thing they’ve learned about addressing such a delicate subject is that the women involved know their experiences best. “They know what the most damaging and damning parts of their accounts are,” Ms. Ryzik said. “If something sticks out to them as, ‘This really shows what the problem is,’ then that’s the kind of detail that you want in the story.” It has been more than 500 days since The New York Times published its first article detailing the film producer Harvey Weinstein’s yearslong record of sexual harassment and assault allegations. The reporting set off a sea change both for Mr. Weinstein, who was arrested last May and is awaiting trial, and for culture at large. The #MeToo movement has unseated titans in industries including media, restaurants, politics and business, in many cases as a direct result of Times reporting that has continued to expose abuses of power and created ripple effects for those involved. One reason Mr. Coscarelli and Ms. Ryzik, as well as their editors, Caryn Ganz and Ian Trontz, felt the Ryan Adams story was important to tell was it provided a window into the complicated power arrangements that undergird the world of pop music. “The music industry isn’t like Hollywood; it doesn’t operate in the same kind of power structure,” Ms. Ganz said. “An artist can wield just as much power as a large executive; it’s just a matter of their influence and connections.” Mr. Coscarelli said the Ryan Adams case is an example of a complex spectrum of behavior that includes subtler abuses of power that have been harder to document — but are much more common.  “I think as we’re moving into Year 2 of #MeToo reporting, often it’s not the R. Kellys and the Harvey Weinsteins of the world,” he said, referring to two men who have been accused of rape or sexual abuse by many women, “but people who are abusing their power in more complex, but equally pernicious ways.” Follow the @ReaderCenter on Twitter for more coverage highlighting your perspectives and experiences and for insight into how we work.

5c988ae049f0eacbf105eda3,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/25/arts/music/us-jordan-peele-i-got-5-on-it-luniz.html,"The trailer for Jordan Peele’s new horror movie, “Us,” set the internet on fire in December. The premise — a family stalked by its disfigured doppelgängers — was chilling, but much of the online reaction focused on the teaser’s use of “I Got 5 on It,” the 1995 platinum hit by the Oakland rap duo Luniz. As the trailer opens, the song plays over the car radio while the family discusses its meaning, prompting the dad’s accidental double entendre: “It’s not about drugs, it’s a dope song!” Known as the San Francisco Bay Area’s premier pot-smoking anthem, the track gets a makeover as the trailer turns darker — slowed down, then beefed up with orchestral overdubs, becoming a terrifying, atmospheric motif. [Read Manohla Dargis’s review of “Us.”] “You’d never think of it as a scary movie song,” said Anthony Gilmour, 52, the Bay Area rap producer known as Tone Capone, who made the original track. “But when they slow it up, it just sounds creepy.” Peele told Entertainment Weekly that the track had haunting undertones: “I feel like the beat in that song has this inherent cryptic energy, almost reminiscent of the ‘Nightmare on Elm Street’ soundtrack.” (He also liked that it was a Bay Area classic, appropriate for a film set in Northern California.) Luniz’s Garrick Husbands, 43, known as Numskull, said he was ecstatic to learn the song would be included in the film’s promotion. “It was the best thing, besides my children being born, I had ever heard,” he said in a phone interview. For many younger rap fans, this was their first encounter with Luniz, who originally formed as the LuniTunes in 1992. Linking up with Tone Capone the following year, Luniz helped usher in the Bay Area’s “Mob Music” sound — slow, brooding, 808-drum-machine-driven grooves often known as “slumpers.” The duo’s 1995 debut, “Operation Stackola,” went platinum on the strength of “I Got 5 on It.” Follow-ups in 1997 and 2002 didn’t reach the same heights, and the duo split around 2005, reuniting in 2015 for a mixtape called “High Timez.” In 2018, it released an EP, “No Pressure,” and it’s currently working on new singles. “I’ll give you a hint: They’re definitely around what’s going on with the movie,” said Luniz’s Jerold Ellis, 44, the rapper known as Yukmouth. (On March 8, the day “Us” had its premiere at SXSW, the duo released a revamped version of the track, “I Got 5 on Us,” with a video inspired by the film.) “I Got 5 on It” initially appeared in two scenes in “Us,” but the horror version — known as the “Tethered Mix” — was added to the soundtrack “as a result of its success in the trailer,” said Stacey Zarro, the vice president for publicity at the movie’s distributor, Universal Pictures. The “Tethered Mix” was the brainchild of Joe Wees, the senior vice president for creative marketing at Universal, and the trailer editor John Cantu. (Michael Abels was the composer for “Us.”) “We struck it down to where we had just a bit of the lyrics and some tones, added in our own effects, and then hired composition companies to help fill those in,” Wees said. (The “Us” team declined to name who finished up the mix.) Tone Capone was more than happy to dissect the revised track, noting some low-frequency oscillation on the bells and plucked strings. “They’re playing it at a slower tempo, using a turntable or a processor and then a computer to keep the pitch the same,” he said. As a producer, Tone Capone’s bona fides in Bay Area rap run deep. Working under the name DJ Cool G, he provided turntable scratches on the 1987 album “Surf or Die” by the Surf MC’s, a novelty group that nonetheless edged out the scene’s acknowledged founder, Too Short, as the first local rap act to sign to a major label. He provided an early influential remix of Eric B. and Rakim’s “Casualties of War” in 1992, and was soon directing label scouts to the region, yielding deals for Luniz, Dru Down and the Keak da Sneak launchpad 3X Krazy. Apart from “I Got 5 on It,” he is most famous for co-producing the Geto Boys’ Scarface, including the 1997 smash “Smile,” one of the last guest appearances Tupac Shakur recorded before his death. Along the way, he worked with Bay Area luminaries like E-40 and Mac Dre; Dirty Southerners like Devin the Dude; and New Yorkers like Lloyd Banks. His work lately has drifted toward R&B, developing vocal talent like the singer London Savoy. In recent years, he’s taken on a day job as a supply technician at U.C.S.F. Medical Center, but he estimates about half of his income comes from licensing and publishing from his classic catalog, a fact he ascribes to his old-school, major-label paperwork and publishing rights. “All I can say is, producers, stop giving your stuff away for free because you devaluing the game,” he said. “Even if you just chuck it out on the internet, you still got to have the business part done if you want to eat.” Still, even Tone Capone is amazed at the evergreen success of what was already what he called his “top breadwinner.” “It’s been good to me,” he said. “‘5 on It’ blew up, and it’s blowing up again, which is crazy because it’s 24 years later.” If that’s what being a one-hit wonder means, he joked, “I’ll be a one-hit wonder.” "
5c6a03ed3a125f5075c0a329,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/17/arts/music/21-savage-ice-interview.html,"ALPHARETTA, Ga. — For the last four years, 21 Savage has been one of the stalwarts of Atlanta rap, a rising star who has collaborated with Drake and Cardi B, among many others, and become one of the signature voices in the city. His December album “I Am > I Was” spent two weeks at the top of the Billboard chart, and his collaboration with Post Malone, “Rockstar,” was nominated for two Grammys. With that success has come more visibility. In late January, he performed his single “A Lot” on “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,” adding a new verse in which he rapped about children being separated from their parents at the border. A few days later, early in the morning on Super Bowl Sunday, Feb. 3, 21 Savage (born She’yaa Bin Abraham-Joseph) was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, who said he was an “unlawfully present United Kingdom national” who had overstayed his visa. He remained in ICE custody at the Irwin County Detention Center in South Georgia until Feb. 13, when he was released on $100,000 bond. The next day, he was in a hotel room in a suburb north of Atlanta, surrounded by several members of his legal team. Dressed in somber all-black, he spoke at length about his childhood, his time in detention, the Grammy Awards ceremony he missed and how growing up without legal status shaped the person he became. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. Do you remember first arriving here when you were young? Yeah, everything was like, bigger. I come from the poor side of London. My grandma house is real skinny. So when we first moved here, we was living in the hood still, but it was, like, way bigger. The toilet size, the bathroom size, it was just different. But I fell in love with it. It’s all I know. Did you have a British accent? Yeah, I had a accent, ’cause my first day of school they was making fun of me so I beat somebody up, and they was calling me “taekwondo kid.” My mama whupped me, she made me stay in the house. So I know I had a accent, but I been here 20 years — I don’t know what happened to it. Do you remember when you became aware that your status wasn’t settled? Probably like the age when you start to get your driver’s license. I couldn’t never take driver’s ed, I couldn’t never go get a job. About that age. Was it something you wanted to get taken care of? It felt impossible. It got to the point where I just learned to live without it. ’Cause I still ain’t got it, I’m 26, and I’m rich. So, just learned to live without it. Like a lot of other immigrants. We struggled but we couldn’t get food stamps, we couldn’t get government assistance. I learned how to live without. You know in school, when you get to a certain age, your clothes make you popular? I learned how to be popular without that. People respected me just for me. Do you think the situation taught you to carry yourself a certain way? It made me who I am. I wouldn’t write it no other way if I had the choice. If they said, “Hey, you could start your life over and make yourself a citizen,” I wouldn’t have never did it. I still want to go through this right here ’cause it made me who I am, it made me strong. Were you aware that there was a possibility that at some point you might not be able to stay in the country? Yeah, for sure. It’s like my worst nightmare. That’s why it’s always been trying to get corrected. Even if you got money, it ain’t easy. It ain’t no favoritism, and I respect it, I honestly respect it. It would be kind of messed up if they treated rich immigrants better than poor immigrants, I think. How draining was it being in detention, especially with the uncertainty of how long it was going to last? It really wasn’t jail, it was the possibility of me not being able to live in this country no more that I’ve been living in my whole life. All that just going through your head, like, “Damn, I love my house, I ain’t gonna be able to go in my house no more? I ain’t gonna be able to go to my favorite restaurant that I been going to for 20 years straight?” That’s the most important thing. If you tell me, “I’ll give you 20 million to go stay somewhere you ain’t never stayed,” I’d rather be broke. I’ll sit in jail to fight to live where I’ve been living my whole life. I’m sure you were spending a lot of time in your head. I could have made myself go crazy. I think they really try to break you. It’s like we gonna put you in jail and we gonna make you fight your case the slowest you can fight it so that you just want to go home. Nobody want to sit in jail, especially if they don’t have the money to fight it and they ain’t been to court in three months. What do you think has happened in your life that gave you a different perspective? It was what was at stake. It’s like, I got three kids, my mama, everything that I know is here in Atlanta. I’m not leaving Atlanta without a fight. We gon’ fight all the way till the last day even if that mean I sit in jail for 10 years. Were you upset about missing the Grammys? Nah, I was stressed about getting out. The Grammys is the Grammys, but when you in jail, the Grammys is nothing. I got to watch it. By that time they had put a TV in my room. Was the original plan that you’d be part of the Post Malone performance? Yeah I was supposed to perform. He wore the 21 Savage shirt, so I felt like I was there. I don’t care what nobody say — everybody in that building who’s connected to this culture, I was on their mind in some type of way. That’s all that mattered. They didn’t have to say it ’cause everybody knew it. It was in the air. All the people that was there, they said the words in other places and that matter just as much. All the big artists was vocal about the situation, so I was appreciative. Even the memes. They didn’t stress you out? Some of them was funny — I ain’t gonna lie. I was appreciative of that. I coulda been another person who just, “He locked up? Damn,” and nobody said nothing. Some people, I see why they was mad. It ain’t about the meme, it’s about the bigger picture. But I done been through way worse things in my life than somebody putting me on a meme. I been shot — what is a meme? A meme is nothing. That’s something on the internet that I can do like this [turns over phone] and never see again. I look at bullet scars every day, so it’s like, a meme, bro? Do you feel a responsibility to speak up about your circumstances? Yeah, I feel a responsibility. My situation is important ’cause I represent poor black Americans and I represent poor immigrant Americans. You gotta think about all the millions of people that ain’t 21 Savage that’s in 21 Savage shoes. Do you feel an urge to put some of this experience into music? Not right now, ’cause I feel like me putting it into music got me in this situation, kind of. "
5c2bbf163a125f5075c02770,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/01/obituaries/norman-gimbel-dies-at-91.html,"Norman Gimbel, the wildly versatile Brooklyn-born lyricist who won a Grammy Award for a blues hit, “Killing Me Softly With His Song”; an Oscar for a folk ballad, “It Goes Like It Goes” (from “Norma Rae”); and television immortality for the bouncy series themes to “Happy Days” and “Laverne and Shirley,” died on Dec. 19 at his home in Montecito, Calif. He was 91. The death was confirmed by his son Tony, managing partner of his father’s music publishing company, Words West. Any attempt to categorize the elder Mr. Gimbel’s musical leanings would be complicated. He was famous for the English lyrics of “The Girl From Ipanema,” Antonio Carlos Jobim’s 1964 bossa nova hit originally written in Portuguese. He also wrote English lyrics for Michel Legrand’s music from Jacques Demy’s romantic 1964 French film “The Umbrellas of Cherbourg,” most notably “I Will Wait for You” (“Till you’re here beside me, till I’m touching you”) and for what became “I Will Follow Him,” a solid hit about teenage adoration sung by Little Peggy March (age 15) in 1963. Among his early hits, “Sway” (“When marimba rhythms start to play”) was clearly Latin-accented, even when Dean Martin sang it, and “Canadian Sunset,” recorded by Andy Williams, became a jazz standard. “Ready to Take a Chance Again” (from “Foul Play,” 1978), which earned an Oscar nomination, was a wistfully hopeful love song. Jim Croce’s 1973 hit “I Got a Name” (“Movin’ me down the highway, rollin’ down the highway, movin’ ahead so life won’t pass me by”) was quintessential folk rock. Mr. Gimbel worked with David Shire on “Norma Rae,” but his most frequent collaborator may have been Charles Fox. “Killing Me Softly,” which brought Mr. Gimbel and Mr. Fox the song-of-the-year Grammy after Roberta Flack released it in 1973, had a conflict-ridden back story. Lori Lieberman, a California bistro singer, had recorded the song first (Mr. Fox and Mr. Gimbel were her producers and managers) and she said that the lyrics (among them, “I felt he found my letters and read each one out loud”) had been based on a poem she had written about attending an emotionally stirring Don McLean concert. The song, which became a hit again with the Fugees’ hip-hop cover in the 1990s, is now sometimes listed as written “in collaboration with” Ms. Lieberman. Norman Gimbel was born in Brooklyn on Nov. 16, 1927. His parents — Morris Gimbel, who was in the restaurant business, and Lottie (Nass) Gimbel — were Jewish immigrants from Austria. Norman, who studied English at Baruch College and Columbia University, began his career working for the music publisher David Blum and for Edwin H. Morris & Company. His first hit was “Ricochet,” written with Larry Coleman and Joe Darion and recorded by Teresa Brewer in 1953. The saucy, country-tinged pop song (“If you’re careless with your kisses, find another turtle dove”) rose to No. 2 on the charts. Mr. Gimbel soon moved to Los Angeles, where he worked more widely in television and film, teaming up with Mr. Fox on the themes to the hit sitcoms “Laverne and Shirley” (“Schlemiel, schlimazle, Hassenpfeffer Incorporated”) and “Happy Days” (“Sunday, Monday, happy days”) and the 1970s series “Wonder Woman” and “The Paper Chase.” He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1984. Back in New York, Mr. Gimbel wrote lyrics for two Broadway musicals, “Whoop-Up” (1958) and “The Conquering Hero” (1961), working with the composer Moose Charlap. The first show, set on an American Indian reservation, earned two Tony nominations; the second, starring Tom Poston as a fake war hero, had a book by Larry Gelbart. Despite positive reviews, both musicals flopped at the box office and closed early. Both of Mr. Gimbel’s marriages, to the fashion model Elinor Rowley and to Victoria Carver, a lawyer, ended in divorce. In addition to his son Tony, survivors include another son, Peter; two daughters, Nelly Gimbel and Hannah Gimbel Dal Pozzo; and four grandchildren. Mr. Gimbel gave relatively few interviews. In a six-minute segment as a contestant (alongside Burt Bacharach and Jerry Leiber) on “Play Your Hunch,” an early Merv Griffin game show, he spoke only three words. That verbal reticence, though, served him well professionally. “Norman had the extraordinary ability with his lyrics to capture the human condition with never an excessive word to describe a feeling or an action,” Mr. Fox, the composer, said in a statement after his writing partner’s death. He went on to praise Mr. Gimbel’s ability to conjure an entire song with its first line, and he offered examples: “Tall and tan and young and lovely.” “Strumming my pain with his fingers.” “If it takes forever, I will wait for you.” "
5c420ba53a125f5075c052a0,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/18/arts/music/cleveland-orchestra-review-ariadne-strauss.html,"CLEVELAND — Is Strauss’s “Ariadne auf Naxos” the best opera? Probably not, though it’s up there. If you asked me whether it was my favorite opera, my answer would be the same. But it must be the most operatic opera, the one that reflects most sweetly and profoundly on the nature of this strange, lovely hodgepodge of an art form. Putting on an opera, after all, is what the piece is all about. So it makes sense that the Cleveland Orchestra’s audience at Severance Hall here — for a pristine, poignant production of “Ariadne” that runs through Saturday evening — takes its seats to find what looks like a rehearsal. The players, wearing their own street clothes, are onstage, with a plastic work table and some chairs. A digital clock, the kind that keeps precise time for obeying musicians’ union regulations, is visible. The orchestra’s music director, Franz Welser-Möst, sits on the podium, chatting with the wind section. A stage manager comes out and holds up a hand to indicate five minutes to go; Mr. Welser-Möst stands; and, without anyone having applauded or the lights having gone down, the orchestra surges into the lithe rapids of the opening measures. Staged by Frederic Wake-Walker, it’s a disarming, intimate beginning to this most disarming and intimate of scores. And there is no orchestra I’d rather hear play it than this one, pared to a vivid, graceful chamber scale. Even at full complement, Cleveland is a group that performs with the crystalline energy of a quartet, silky yet piquant, so you can imagine the pearly lucidity when it’s reduced to just three dozen. In those first couple of minutes alone, the bassoon peeks through the strings, a gentle forest murmur. An onstage horn manages to deliver the delicacy and courtly distance you’d expect from an instrument located well into the wings. Strauss’s burbling kaleidoscope of themes unfolds with playfulness and sobriety, in perfect balance. That balance defines “Ariadne.” Originally conceived as the second half of an evening that would begin with a Molière play, it was revised in the form of a prologue and an opera proper. The prologue is set in the home of a rich man who, planning for a party, has asked a troupe of comedians to clown and commissioned an earnest young composer to write a serious opera on the mythical theme of Ariadne, abandoned on the island of Naxos. Then the order comes down: Because of time constraints — there’s a fireworks display to be had — comedians and tragedians are to perform simultaneously. The opera proper is the occasion for their collision and, by the end, sublime cohesion. It is a piece, just as opera is a genre, about polarities brought into vibrating equilibrium by being made to inhabit the same space: speech and singing; comedy and tragedy; antiquity and modernity; restraint and excess; illusions of purity, set against the complexity, the compromise, of life. No other work so well captures how opera, at its best, is both of the world and a rapturous heightening of it. Time and again, Strauss almost offhandedly swirls his orchestra into another sphere. And with its peerless elegance, Cleveland is perhaps uniquely suited to capture these magical pivots — to conjure out of this small orchestra, busy punctuating clatter and babble, a sudden, shockingly full rush of feeling that tingles your skin. Mr. Welser-Möst’s gift for letting scores breathe, unrushed and unruffled yet taut, serves “Ariadne” particularly well. The vitality of instrumental details enhances, rather than distracts from, the coherence of the drama. Moments like the briefest impression of violins tuning in the prologue, and the quiver of flute in the opera proper at the mention of leaves rustling, don’t ever stop the dialogue in its tracks; indeed, they propel it forward. Cleveland’s eloquent cast propels it, too. This is a talky opera; it can sag or sparkle. Mr. Welser-Möst and the orchestra have assembled artists who make their singing speak. And even make their speaking sing: The great baritone Wolfgang Brendel is a luxury in the talking role of the Major-Domo in the prologue. (See if you ever hear the consonants of the word “danach” pronounced with more relish.) There’s articulate boldness in other of the smaller roles, like the Music Master (the bass-baritone Hanno Müller-Brachmann) and Dance Master (the tenor Jonas Hacker). Mr. Welser-Möst seems to favor voices more willowy than plummy; his singers tend to blend with the instruments — beautifully — rather than soar over them. Kate Lindsey is direct and assertive as the Composer, her tone sometimes slender and chalky but with moonlit gentleness when it’s soft — an oboe-like quality that lends itself to moments in the prologue when the winds melt into the strings, an autumn sunset in sound. Her coloratura satiny and clean, Daniela Fally is a calmly sunny, blessedly unperky Zerbinetta, smiling through her seen-it-all-ness. In the title role, Tamara Wilson also exudes serenity and sweetness, even approachability; there’s rarely this much temperamental similarity between Ariadne and Zerbinetta. Even if it doesn’t really bloom at its top, Ms. Wilson’s soprano easily swells to fill climaxes. And it rests cozily within the ensemble textures, a clarinet rather than a trumpet. Trumpet-like is more the province of Andreas Schager, who as a properly exuberant Bacchus conquers the intense challenges Strauss laid out for his tenors. Mr. Schager manages to sing a role many squeal, blazing out the score’s unfriendly high notes. (It’s a triumph that can sometimes jar in the context of his more restrained colleagues.) After the bustling prologue and an intermission, the orchestra (in concert black) returns, now lowered into the pit, the stage surrounded by a gauzy white curtain. Throughout the spectacle of Ariadne’s suffering — and the interjections of the comedians who try to cheer her — fragments of old films (Chaplin, Marx Brothers, early cartoons) are projected, floating alongside snippets of footage of the stunning Severance Hall and its architectural details. It’s nostalgia, and at the same time it’s where we are now. It’s winking, yet sincere. It is, as the work’s librettist, Hugo von Hofmannsthal, wrote of “Ariadne,” “a very serious trifle.” Like opera.

5c3d1c5c3a125f5075c04623,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/obituaries/clydie-king-dead.html,"Clydie King, whose peppery but plain-spoken backing vocals helped define hits like the Rolling Stones’ “Tumbling Dice,” Linda Ronstadt’s “You’re No Good” and — despite her reservations about it — Lynyrd Skynyrd’s “Sweet Home Alabama,” died on Jan. 7 in Monrovia, Calif. She was 75. Tony Collins, her former husband, said her death, at Monrovia Memorial Hospital, was caused by complications of a blood infection that she had acquired during dialysis treatment. Ms. King joined Bob Dylan’s band in 1980, when he was in the midst of his Christian-rock phase, beginning a long association with him. Mr. Dylan had recently converted to evangelical Christianity, and the two bonded over music and faith. She became a central part of his ensemble, and they started a romantic relationship that lasted through the mid-’80s. In a statement to the news media on the occasion of Ms. King’s death, Mr. Dylan said: “She was my ultimate singing partner. No one ever came close. We were two soul mates.” Ms. King recorded dozens of songs under her own name in the 1960s, and in the next decade she released a smattering of solo albums on independent labels. But she never scored a breakthrough hit. Instead, by the mid-’70s she had established herself as a first-call backing vocalist, working with B. B. King, Joe Cocker, Odetta, Steely Dan and many others. Starting in 1966 she spent three years as a core member of Ray Charles’s famed backing vocal troupe, the Raelettes. Another member was Merry Clayton, who also went on to become a top-tier background singer and collaborated frequently with Ms. King over the coming decade. In the early 1970s, Ms. King was a leader of the Blackberries, a soul- and disco-oriented group that recorded for Motown’s West Coast affiliate, Mowest. She released three solo albums for small labels in the ’70s: “Direct Me,” a sparky soul-funk effort, in 1971; “Brown Sugar,” in 1973; and “Rushing to Meet You,” with a disco bent, in 1976. She stepped away from performing in the mid-’80s for health reasons, and never made a full comeback. Ms. King is survived by a sister, Enober Green; a brother, Willie King; two sons, Christopher and Randy Hale, from her marriage to Robin Hale; and a number of grandchildren. A third son from that marriage, Magge Hale, died before her, as did a daughter, Delores Collins, from her marriage to Mr. Collins. Both marriages ended in divorce. Clydie Mae King was born in Dallas on Aug. 21, 1943. Her mother died when she was 2 years old, and she was raised primarily by her older sister, Lula Mae Crittendon. Ms. King sang in her church choir as a child, and she stood out early. At age 8, she appeared on a national television show hosted by Art Linkletter. Soon after, her family moved to Los Angeles, where Ms. King started her recording career at 13, fronting a doo-wop group called Little Clydie and the Teens. Over the succeeding years she recorded frequently as a leader, mostly in a classic doo-wop or soul style, for the Specialty, Philips, Minit and Imperial labels. One day in June 1973, at a time when she was working constantly as a background vocalist, she called Ms. Clayton and asked her to participate in the recording of “Sweet Home Alabama.” Ms. Clayton initially resisted, offended by the song’s lyrics. The irony was not lost on Ms. King, either, that two black women might contribute to a song seen by many as celebrating the conservative backlash against civil rights. But she persuaded Ms. Clayton to do the session anyway, and together their boisterous voices helped define what became a smash hit. “We really wanted nothing to do with any type of Alabama at that time in our lives,” Ms. Clayton recalled in an interview shortly after the release in 2013 of “20 Feet From Stardom,” Morgan Neville’s Oscar-winning documentary about backup singers. (That film helped bring Ms. Clayton’s career out of the shadows, but it did not feature Ms. King.) “That was a part of our protest, you know?” Ms. Clayton told  Rolling Stone. “We couldn’t stand on the front lines, but we could certainly sing ‘Sweet Home Alabama’ with all of our hearts and souls — a song that will live in infamy.” Ms. King first worked with Mr. Dylan on the sessions for “Saved” (1980), his second of three religious albums. She is also heard with him on “Shot of Love” (1981), his final Christian album; “Infidels” (1983); and the 2018 archival collection “The Bootleg Series Vol. 13: Trouble No More 1979–1981.” Ms. King and Mr. Dylan made a wealth of recordings as a duo, which have yet to be released. “There must be at least an album’s worth. We would often go into the studios and do little things,” Ms. King said in a 2007 interview with In the Basement, a British music magazine. “I don’t know why nothing was ever issued. I expect it had to do with record company politics.” The 2017 concert film “Trouble No More,” centering on footage from Mr. Dylan’s 1980 tours, features Ms. King prominently. It closes with her and Mr. Dylan seated together at the piano, singing a tender duet on “Abraham, Martin and John.” Alongside Ms. King, Mr. Dylan’s famously mercurial voice becomes clear and well pitched, and the two harmonize with ease. They appear to be playing to a largely empty arena, presumably during a sound check — but they seem unconcerned about who is or isn’t listening, lost as they are inside the music. "
5c50f2d13a125f5075c06fea,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/29/obituaries/james-ingram-dead.html,"James Ingram, whose voice — technically precise, crisp and reserved, yet full of audacious feeling — made him one of the defining singers of R&B in the 1980s, has died. He was 66. The actress and choreographer Debbie Allen, a frequent collaborator with Mr. Ingram on musical theater projects, announced his death on Twitter on Tuesday, calling him her “dearest friend and creative partner.” She did not say where or when he died or specify the cause. Just as R&B’s “quiet storm” phase was peaking, Mr. Ingram was plucked from side-gig obscurity by the producer Quincy Jones to appear on his 1981 album, “The Dude.” Mr. Jones discovered Mr. Ingram on a demo of “Just Once,” written by Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil, which he sang for $50. Mr. Jones loved not just the song but the singer as well, and he called Mr. Ingram — who initially hung up on him — and invited him to perform “Just Once” and another song, “One Hundred Ways,” on that album. Both songs became huge hits, cracking the Top 20 of the Billboard Hot 100. “One Hundred Ways” earned Mr. Ingram a Grammy in 1982 for best male R&B vocal performance. Up until Mr. Jones rang him up, Mr. Ingram had been content in the background. “I was never no singer; I never shopped a deal, none of that,” he told The Chicago Tribune in 2012. But his voice — austere, luscious, commanding — was foreground material. His music was gentlemanly and romantic, the aural equivalent of being courted. Mr. Ingram was born on Feb. 16, 1952, and raised in Akron, Ohio. He sang in a church choir — his father was a deacon — and taught himself to play piano. After high school, he passed up a track scholarship to focus on music, eventually moving to Los Angeles. When Mr. Jones discovered him, Mr. Ingram had been inching his way into the music business for about a decade. He had been a pianist for Ray Charles; played in a band, Revelation Funk, which contributed a song to the soundtrack of the 1975 movie “Dolemite”; played in one of Dick Clark’s support bands; and done side work as a demo singer. After the success of “Just Once” and “One Hundred Ways,” Mr. Ingram became a force in R&B. In 1982 he recorded a duet with Patti Austin, “Baby, Come to Me,” which reached No. 1 on the Hot 100. In 1983 he released his first solo album, “It’s Your Night,” which featured several hits, including another duet with Ms. Austin, “How Do You Keep the Music Playing?,” and “Yah Mo B There,” a duet with Michael McDonald that would earn Ingram his second Grammy, in 1985. (He was nominated a total of 14 times.) Throughout the 1980s, Mr. Ingram worked with Mr. Jones on several other projects: participating in the all-star charity single “We Are the World”; writing for the soundtrack of Steven Spielberg’s film “The Color Purple” (1985); singing on Mr. Jones’s 1989 album, “Back on the Block”; and, most crucially, writing, with Jones, Michael Jackson’s 1983 Top 10 hit “P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing).” “It’s almost like I got the chance to go to Oz and Quincy was the Wizard of Oz and Michael Jackson was who he was dealing with in his world,” Mr. Ingram told Jet magazine in 2007. In a statement, Mr. Jones said: “There are no words to convey how much my heart aches with the news of the passing of my baby brother James Ingram. With that soulful, whisky-sounding voice, James Ingram was simply magical.” Later in the 1980s and into the ’90s, a time when songs from hit films often became radio hits too, Mr. Ingram was a soundtrack favorite. “Somewhere Out There,” a duet with Linda Ronstadt from the animated feature “An American Tail,” was one of biggest chart successes, reaching No. 2. He was heard on the soundtracks of “Beverly Hills Cop II,” “Forget Paris” and “City Slickers.” As a writer, Mr. Ingram was twice nominated for best original song at both the Academy Awards and the Golden Globe Awards: in 1994, for “The Day I Fall in Love” from “Beethoven’s 2nd,” and in 1995, for “Look What Love Has Done” from “Junior.” “I Don’t Have the Heart,” a song from his third album, “It’s Real,” reached No. 1 in 1990, but Mr. Ingram released music less frequently in the following decades. In 2008 he released a gospel album, “Stand (in the Light),” and he spoke frequently about his faith on “The 700 Club,” on the Christian Broadcasting Network. Mr. Ingram’s survivors include his wife, Debra, whom he married in 1975. Complete information on survivors was not immediately available. "
5c3bd0eb3a125f5075c0432a,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/13/arts/music/super-bowl-halftime-maroon-5-travis-scott-big-boi.html,"The N.F.L. on Sunday ended months of uncertainty by officially announcing Maroon 5 and the rappers Travis Scott and Big Boi as the lineup for this year’s Super Bowl halftime show. In an indication of how fraught the debate around the high-profile performance has become, Scott released a statement on Sunday announcing that he and the N.F.L. will partner on a $500,000 donation to the social justice group Dream Corps — a move that seemed to be aimed at stemming a backlash from groups that have criticized the football league’s policies. Sources familiar with the N.F.L.’s Super Bowl plans had confirmed the rock band Maroon 5 as the headliner as long ago as September, and Scott emerged last month as a reported addition to the Feb. 3 halftime performance at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta. Big Boi, the newest name on the bill, is a member of the Atlanta rap group Outkast. But the run-up to this year’s halftime announcement had turned into a skirmish over sports and politics, as artists and others criticized the N.F.L. over its treatment of Colin Kaepernick and other players who have taken a knee during the national anthem in protest of racial injustice. In February, the rapper Cardi B, who was featured on Maroon 5’s hit “Girls Like You” last year, told the celebrity news website TMZ that she would consider performing at a halftime show “when they hire Colin Kaepernick back.” In a song released last June, Jay-Z rapped, “I said no to the Super Bowl, you need me, I don’t need you.” Scott’s involvement, specifically, has prompted criticism from some. In an interview with TMZ, the Rev. Al Sharpton said he thought Scott “should do what a lot of other major artists have done — say, ‘I’m not going to participate.’” “You can’t fight against Jim Crow and then go sit in the back of the bus,” he added. In a pair of tweets, the rapper Meek Mill responded to the news that Scott would be performing with, “For what????” and “He don’t need that he on fire already!” And Gerald Griggs, first vice president of the Atlanta chapter of the N.A.A.C.P., told The Guardian that the chapter had contacted artists and asked them not to perform. “The majority of artists we’ve reached out to are standing in solidarity against the N.F.L.,” Griggs said. “They do not want to be associated because of the protest that was started by Mr. Kaepernick against racial injustice and police brutality.” For his part, Van Jones, the president of Dream Corps and a founder of the group, celebrated the announcement in a post on Twitter, addressing Scott by his handle. “This is great news!” Jones wrote. “Welcome, @trvisXX. Glad to have you with us, brother!” "
5c94cbce49f0eacbf105e7a2,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/22/arts/music/review-netrebko-kaufmann-forza-verdi-london-opera.html,"LONDON — “I like it very much,” Verdi wrote of “La Forza del Destino” a few months before his opera was to open. “I don’t know if the public will feel the same, but it is certainly something quite out of the ordinary.” The public, it turns out, often hasn’t felt the same. Even today, “Forza” struggles for affection more than practically any of Verdi’s mature works. It’s unwieldy and weird, with creaky plot twists and jarring shifts of mood. Yet when it is taken seriously, staged intelligently, cast carefully, and conducted with energy and polish, it can indeed be something quite out of the ordinary. And at the Royal Opera here, in a production that opened on Thursday, it is fully extraordinary. The central draw is the starry, comet-rare pairing of the soprano Anna Netrebko, 47, and the tenor Jonas Kaufmann, 49, the major singers of their generation. They have come together in a staged opera only once before: “La Traviata” here in London, 11 years ago. Since then, both have dived into darker, heavier roles, occasionally overlapping in repertoire but never on the same stage. Until now. And it feels like the meeting of two veterans at the top of their game, their chemistry comfortable and their combined effect galvanizing. Ms. Netrebko, in particular, gives one of the performances of her career. Singing Leonora for the first time, her voice is startlingly voluptuous and generous in the middle and lower registers. It’s down there where this pitifully persecuted character — violently separated from her lover, who in turn has aroused the eternal ire of her brother by accidentally killing their father — really lives. Her Leonora sounds death-hounded from the start, while also vibrating with the immense fervor — from love, from faith — that drives her forward. Ms. Netrebko sings with both relish and precision, having clearly internalized the bel canto lessons of earlier Verdi — like the other Leonora, in “Il Trovatore” — but now with an earthier flavor. Compared with her other recent parts, it is a more spontaneous creation than Ms. Netrebko’s serene Aida or her stilted Tosca, with the grandeur and sorrow of her Adriana Lecouvreur and a febrility that recalls her Lady Macbeth. Ms. Netrebko’s stage presence has grown more confident in recent years, and, paradoxically, more modest: She’s less busy in her acting, and more meaningful. The singer who might have once boiled over in exaggerated frenzy in “Pace, pace, mio dio” is now as focused in that climactic aria as the slow burn of a candle’s wick. In her duets with Mr. Kaufmann, his voice’s duskiness unsettles into stormy passion. His sound shadowy and haunted, with tears at its core, he is adept at playing outsiders like Don Alvaro, but occasionally he can seem muted on stage, merely grumpy. While the exciting bit of strain and hint of wear in his tone can conjure thoughts of Mario del Monaco, Mr. Kaufmann doesn’t go for del Monaco-type Italianate recklessness; sometimes he seems too obviously to be pacing himself. But he gets Alvaro’s wounded dignity and wariness, and he feeds off other singers, whether Ms. Netrebko or the robust baritone Ludovic Tézier. As Leonora’s brother, Mr. Tézier shows both Don Carlo’s implacability and the utter exhaustion of a life spent in single-minded pursuit of vengeance. He sings “Urna fatale” with the sustained patience and intensity that define the character. Antonio Pappano, the Royal Opera’s music director, isn’t one to force vigor out of extremes of fast and slow, loud and soft. Nothing in the score rushes, and nothing lags: You’re simply aware of the action moving forward at a pace that feels natural — propelled but never harassed. There are details that shine: I’m thinking, for one, of the shivery frost of strings as Padre Guardiano leads Leonora to the cross in the second act. But listening to Mr. Pappano and his committed orchestra is less about piecing together the moments than appreciating the flow. And to have that effect of a unified vision in “Forza,” notorious for its disjointedness, is an achievement, indeed. The company could have sold out this run with its luxurious stars alone, but it recognized that this work, as much as any in opera, needs to be solid throughout its cast. Ferruccio Furlanetto is a booming, sensitive Padre Guardiano, a moral anchor in a world of restlessness and rootlessness. Alessandro Corbelli is a piquant Fra Melitone, and smaller parts are gifts from two still-vital old hands, Robert Lloyd and Roberta Alexander. Veronica Simeoni is an agile voice and presence as Preziosilla, the eerie energizing spirit of the opera’s battle encampment scenes. Christof Loy, the director of this more or less modern-dress production, which first played in 2017 in Amsterdam, renders her a kind of demon in a society driven half-mad by war. The comic and tragic are in this staging cut from the same abrasive cloth, with crowd scenes that quickly turn threatening and characters who lurk moodily on the edges. Carnival-like sequences take on genuine mania and menace. Mr. Loy’s work here is sensible and intelligent; he treats “Forza” not as caricature but as fodder for clear, specific drama. He appreciates opera’s extroversion, its heightening of reality, but never abandons subtlety. It’s an ultimately straightforward approach that gives the work’s delirious strangeness its due while insisting “Forza” can be appreciated earnestly. The production is not exactly staged on a single set, but there is nevertheless the sense, as there should be, that these characters have never managed really to escape the room in which their troubles began. The killing of Leonora and Carlo’s father also periodically returns as fragments of a black-and-white film projected on the wall, its style reminiscent of Italian neorealist cinema. That genre’s vividness, honesty and compassion also come to life in Ms. Netrebko’s crushing yet rapturous performance. "

She was 94. Her death, at a care facility, was confirmed by her daughter, Linda Alvarado. Ms. Vidaurri, who was nicknamed La Calandria, or the Lark, belted out songs with a powerful voice, often making risqué wisecracks during her performances. Based in San Antonio, she sang in Mexico, Cuba and other parts of Latin America, performing with artists like Nat King Cole, Eydie Gorme & Los Panchos and Celia Cruz. By the 1950s she was mentioned alongside such famous Tejana entertainers as Eva Garza and Lydia Mendoza. Ranchera, traditional Mexican country music, often features wistful love ballads or boisterous paeans to places in Mexico and Texas. Ms. Vidaurri retired from the stage in the late 1950s at the insistence of her husband and former booking agent, Hillman Edward Eden. (They later divorced.) She performed rarely until 2001, when Graciela Sánchez, director of the Esperanza Peace and Justice Center in San Antonio, invited her to sing at an 85th birthday celebration for Ms. Mendoza. “The people started screaming and hollering,” Ms. Vidaurri told an interviewer for the PBS program “Conversations” in 2011, “and a lot of the ladies came and said: ‘We haven’t heard from you! We thought you were dead or you were still living in Mexico City’ ” — because nobody knew anything about me. So Gracielita told me, ‘Do you think you want to sing again?’ And I said, ‘I guess so, I don’t have Mr. Eden to stop me anymore.’ ” Ms. Vidaurri began performing regularly (in 2007 she sang at Ms. Mendoza’s funeral), and in time connected with three other ranchera singers who had grown up in San Antonio and were famous from the 1940s to the ′60s. She and the three women — Beatriz Llamas, Blanca Rodríguez and Janet Cortez — performed together as Las Tesoros de San Antonio, or the Treasures of San Antonio. (They continued to perform after Ms. Cortez died in 2014.) A documentary film about the group and their lives, “Las Tesoros de San Antonio: A Westside Story,” was released in 2016. Ms. Vidaurri was born in San Antonio on May 22, 1924, to Juan and Maria (Castillo) Vidaurri. Her father was a mechanic who owned a garage, and her mother was a housekeeper. Her mother, who had encouraged her singing, died when Ms. Vidaurri was a teenager, leaving her to care for her siblings. Ms. Vidaurri worked, attended night school and kept singing, and soon developed an audience. She performed on Mexican radio, won local singing contests and became an advertising model for Jax Beer. She went on to perform on stage with Mexican stars like Tín Tan, Jorge Negrete and Cantínflas. A second marriage also ended in divorce. In addition to her daughter, Ms. Vidaurri, who lived in San Antonio, is survived by a sister, Henrietta Rodriguez; four stepsisters, Sofia, Rita, Yvan and Ellena Vidaurri; and a stepbrother, Ruben Vidaurri. She had three sons, all of whom died before she did. Ms. Vidaurri continued to sing until nearly the end of her life. Her final public performance was at the Esperanza center last November. "

This year, the pair — now festival regulars — will return with another reimagining of “Salome,” set in the present day, one of more than 140 opera, theater, dance and music performances that will take place at the 43rd iteration of the festival this spring. The festival, in Charleston, S.C., is known for bringing together artists from many mediums. This year, it runs from May 24 through June 9. Some other highlights this year include a performance of the composer Joby Talbot’s vocal work “Path of Miracles” staged by the director John La Bouchardière, a performance by the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Company and productions of the Shakespeare plays “Twelfth Night,” “The Comedy of Errors” and “Pericles” from Shakespeare’s Globe. During some of the Globe’s performances, there will be a surprise element — audience members will get to collectively choose which of the three plays they would like to see performed. A testament to the festival’s diversity of genre is the fact that those shows will not be the only place in the festival that Shakespeare’s ideas can be heard. The conductor Evan Rogister will lead a program of selections from Prokofiev’s “Romeo and Juliet” orchestra suites. “We want to make people think of these as human stories rather than as a piece of dance or a piece of theater or a piece of music,” Nigel Redden, the festival’s director, said in a phone interview. Genre-straddling musicians including the jazz singer Esperanza Spalding and the folk band the Punch Brothers, are also featured on the lineup, as is “Pay No Attention to the Girl,” Target Margin Theater’s riff on “The One Thousand and One Nights.” Naturally, they won’t be the only ones there riffing on that work: The Beirut-based company Caracalla Dance Theater will perform the United States premiere of “One Thousand and One Nights,” a dance adaptation of those stories.

The director, Yuval Sharon, giggled, skipped over a set piece, and untangled some ropes dangling from the ceiling. Dancers stretched and laughed. Florian Teichtmeister, the Austrian stage and television actor who has been drafted as Papageno, his first operatic role, had just run through his mock-suicide scene with Lotte Lenya-style speak-singing and a sad clown’s face. He turned to the conductor, Alondra de la Parra, and began to apologize: “I know I couldn’t hold a tune if —.” “Stop it!,” she interrupted him, with a smile. “Focus on the diction. But you’re in pitch, you’re very musical. You’re going to be great.” Relieved, he took a drink of water, and Mr. Sharon — who runs the Industry, an experimental opera company in Los Angeles, and who last year became the first American to direct at the Bayreuth Wagner Festival in Germany — strolled over to discuss the suicide scene with Ms. de la Parra. “This is the part I can never explain to my son,” she said. “It’s a game,” Mr. Sharon said. “But suddenly the game is deadly serious.” The game of presenting a new production of “Die Zauberflöte” is deadly serious, indeed — especially in Germany, where the piece is particularly beloved and performed dozens of times annually in virtually all the country’s plethora of opera houses. Many families make annual pilgrimages to see the State Opera’s storybook 1994 “Zauberflöte,” directed by August Everding using sets and costumes based on 1816 designs by the architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel. (Schinkel, a local hero, also designed many of the buildings surrounding the company’s theater.) For this reason, the company’s new general manager, Mathias Schulz, decided to keep the old production in its repertory and run it alongside Mr. Sharon’s new one, which has been given a gloriously magical infusion of marionette theater and flying effects. The new staging opens Feb. 17 and runs through March 16, and the old one returns for four performances, with a different cast, at the end of April. It’s as if the Metropolitan Opera were to offer a fresh staging of “La Bohème” and then trot out its classic Zeffirelli production a month later. While opera houses will sometimes keep old sets and costumes in storage in case a new production turns out to be a disaster, it is highly unusual for a new show to be introduced with the explicit understanding that it will be presented alongside its predecessor. “With Schinkel there is a historic link that’s very important for this institution,” Mr. Schulz said in an interview. “At the same time, there is the possibility to show that different approaches and different concepts are valid.” Mr. Sharon’s first response was concern, he said of the plans to keep the old version around: “As though the optics of this were that they don’t trust that this is going to work, so they’re holding the other one in reserve. But I learned that was 100 percent not the case.” In fact, he added, knowing that the house will keep the Everding production — which is easy to revive with star singers who might not have time for the weeks of rehearsal needed to make the flying work safely — enabled him to realize his vision unimpeded. “I don’t think any theater would allow me to do this if it was meant to be the standard repertoire version they bring out every year for 20 performances,” he said, adding that the old production “is such a part of the spirit of the house that I understand why they wouldn’t want to let it go.” The soprano Anna Prohaska started her “Flute” career at the State Opera as Papagena in the Everding production before graduating to Pamina, which she will play in the premiere of Mr. Sharon’s show. “The Everding production is beautiful for the freedom it gives to singers,” she said in an interview, but she ribbed how traditional it is: “It’s a little bit patriarchy-washed.” If asked to return to the old production, she added, she’d attempt to integrate the rich characterization of Pamina she’s developed over weeks of work with Mr. Sharon. “The great thing about all this flying and this acrobatics and athletics,” she said, “is that you actually forget your nervousness about singing because you’re so focused on everything else.” With three major opera houses in Berlin, the new staging will therefore be the fourth version in a single city. In such a crowded market, how do you reinterpret a classic opera with fresh eyes? “I wanted to bring the piece to life in a new way without feeling like it gets suffocated through my narrow view,” Mr. Sharon said. He identified two main challenges. First, “Zauberflöte” has surprisingly large quantities of spoken dialogue, which in the mouths of non-acting singers can quickly become deadly. Second, he said, “it needs to have an almost childlike sense of wonder and also a sense of philosophical depth, because the productions that favor one or the other always feel like they’re only telling half the story.” Marionette theater occurred to Mr. Sharon as a general solution. The singers will sometimes be strapped into flying harnesses and sometimes move freely around the stage, but always be attached to visible ropes, as though they’re being manipulated by invisible child puppeteers. The costumes, by the Belgian avant-garde fashion designer Walter van Beirendonck, and the sets, by Mimi Lien, who won a Tony Award for “Natasha, Pierre & the Great Comet of 1812,” allude to both the Mozartean marionettes of Salzburg, Austria, and the Bauhaus-era ballets of Oskar Schlemmer. The dialogues will be replaced by the recorded voices of child actors. The magic — just like the magic flute — will be provided by Mozart’s music: While the singers will move jerkily and expressionlessly through the spoken dialogue, they will come to life, move freely, and sing with their own voices during the music. The one exception will be Papageno, who, content in his role as a puppet, will always move fluidly and speak with his own voice. Mr. Teichtmeister is following the tradition of the 1791 premiere, in which Papageno was played by Mozart’s librettist, Emanuel Schikaneder. A third set of problems with “Die Zauberflöte” seems more and more glaring: the specters of racism and misogyny. Audiences are offered no reason other than distrust of powerful women to believe the first-act switcheroo that reveals that the Queen of the Night, first presented as the hero’s savior, is evil, and that the slave-owning magician Sarastro is genuinely devoted to the search for love and light. Sarastro’s slave Monostatos is black, and his blackness is presented as the reason for his lust, sloth and rage. For Mr. Sharon, it was important not to ignore these parts of the piece, but to point out the ways in which the opera’s overarching message — in his view one of universal liberation, in which the puppets’ move toward self-awareness mirrors the human search for free will and a consciously, collectively shaped future — overcomes its blind spots. The only change to the dialogue, other than shortening some of the longer sections, will be the addition of comments from the voices of the children playing with the puppets, critiquing the racialized characterization of Monostatos. “There are these critical moments,” Mr. Sharon said, “where they stop and question it and say, ‘Well, why are we telling this story?’ and saying, ‘This doesn’t seem right, you don’t tell stories like this today, why are we telling ourselves this story?’ And I think finally one of them says, ‘Well, this must be a very, very old text.’ So then it just becomes part of the play, but it’s not a comfortable part of the play.” Crucially, in Mr. Sharon’s interpretation of the piece’s final trials, which induct Tamino and Pamina into Sarastro’s masonic order, it will be Pamina who leads the transformation. Having spent the opera gradually developing self-awareness as a puppet, she will show Tamino that he is attached to strings, show him how to remove them, and then learn with him how to walk unaided. After the conductor Franz Welser-Möst, who originally suggested Mr. Sharon for the production, dropped out three weeks before the premiere because of urgently needed knee surgery, Ms. de la Parra was given the task of coordinating flying singers and coaching an actor unfamiliar with opera through one of the piece’s central roles. “We all need a medium, a therapist and a masseur,” she said in an interview. But she seemed game. Asked if she was challenged by the flying, she showed a video on her phone from rehearsals for a recent, also acrobatic, staging she led of Mozart’s rarity “Thamos, King of Egypt.” Eager to find out what the singers had to go through, she had herself strapped into a harness and hoisted high above the stage. Ms. Prohaska, quick to stress the help of the flying team and Mr. Sharon, mentioned one entrance in which she will descend from above while the stage floor is dropped to the basement level, leaving her dangling almost 60 feet above the nearest surface for one nerve-racking moment. “I’ve been reading in the middle of the night about falls, even though I shouldn’t,” she said. “And I found a story about a stewardess for a Serbian airline in the 1970s who fell 10,000 meters and could still walk. So I figure, O.K., I’ll probably survive.” "
5c573f233a125f5075c07cfa,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/03/arts/music/don-giovanni-review-met-opera.html,"Class tensions simmer in Mozart’s “Don Giovanni.” The philandering protagonist may make no distinction in the women he hunts, but with the men who help or hinder his efforts — his servant Leporello and the peasant Masetto, whose bride, Zerlina, seems so delectable — he wields aristocratic clout like a club. Social mobility? Psh. Only someone as naïve as Zerlina could fall for that. For the cast, though, it’s a different story. With the exception of the noble but impotent Don Ottavio, a tenor part, the male roles all call for low voices that are potentially interchangeable. That’s how, last week at the Metropolitan Opera, the Italian bass-baritone Luca Pisaroni came to make his role debut as Don Giovanni in the same drab 2011 production by Michael Grandage, in which he has previously sung Leporello. Years earlier, in Salzburg, Mr. Pisaroni was Masetto. Meanwhile the Met’s current Leporello, the Russian bass Ildar Abdrazakov, has starred here before as the Don. That made the serenade scene in Act II, in which master and servant swap clothes, deliciously meta. Or so I told myself on Saturday, straining to find anything of interest in this leathery take on Mozart’s dark masterpiece. Vocally, both men fit their roles well. Mr. Pisaroni sounded muscular and suave in the title role, though his Don Giovanni felt more like a frat boy than a shape-shifting object of fascination. Mr. Abdrazakov’s hearty gruffness suited his part, and his earthy comic acting was effective. Watching the two singers trade places, I wondered whether Leporello was not the more desirable role. When he originated the role of Don Giovanni in 1787, Luigi Bassi (described by contemporaries as a “most beautiful but utterly stupid” singer) complained that the protagonist never gets a real aria. Leporello’s million-words-a-minute catalog aria, meanwhile, is a showstopper. With the German conductor Cornelius Meister at the helm, though, many of the rapid-fire numbers that carry the buffo weight in this tragicomedy rattled more than they hummed. The frequent coordination problems might have been a fluke, but Mr. Meister also imposed ill-advised tempos including a wet-blanket andante in “Là ci darem la mano” that all but suffocated this tender duet between Don Giovanni and Zerlina. As Zerlina, the Russian soprano Aida Garifullina made her house debut with an interestingly copper-hued, stiletto-sharp voice that didn’t quite fit this ingénue role. Another new face is the Italian soprano Federica Lombardi who sang the part of Donna Elvira. With an acidic brightness in her top notes she held her own well in ensemble numbers, but in the aria “Ah! Chi mi dice mai” her low register lacked the necessary power to make the music’s stark fluctuations psychologically telling. Power wasn’t an issue for the soprano Rachel Willis-Sorensen as Donna Anna, but the glassy hardness of her tone may be an acquired taste. As her onstage partner the French tenor Stanislas de Barbeyrac was another Met newcomer. Endowed with an ample, vigorous voice and a knack for expansive legato lines, he may mature into a tenor to watch. On Saturday, he tended to overwhelm his arias with finicky changes in dynamics. Rounding out the cast were the bass Stefan Kocan, stentorian and plush as the Commendatore, and the bass-baritone Brandon Cedel, suave and alert as Masetto. I wouldn’t be at all surprised if he’s begun to size up the other roles in this opera. "

The film, which is still untitled, will cull from roughly 55 hours of never-released footage of the band’s 1969 studio sessions that led to their final album, “Let It Be.” The announcement of the movie comes on the 50th anniversary of the Beatles’ final show, that much loved performance on a windswept roof in London. [How Peter Jackson Made WWI Footage Seem Astonishingly New With “They Shall Not Grow Old.”] “This movie will be the ultimate ‘fly on the wall’ experience that Beatles fans have long dreamt about,” Jackson said in a statement. “It’s like a time machine transports us back to 1969, and we get to sit in the studio watching these four friends make great music together.” The footage of the new film will be restored with the same techniques Jackson and his producers used during the making of “They Shall Not Grow Old.” The project has been approved by the former band members Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr, as well as Yoko Ono Lennon and Olivia Harrison, the widows of John Lennon and George Harrison. The “Let It Be” recording sessions were captured in an accompanying 1970 documentary by Michael Lindsay-Hogg, which highlighted the group’s tenuous relations leading to their breakup. Once Jackson’s movie is released, the Beatles’ management company, Apple Corps Ltd., will also rerelease the original 1970 film. "

But this summer, New Yorkers will be able to do all three without ever losing sight of the Brooklyn Bridge. The Brooklyn Bridge Park Conservancy and Brooklyn Bridge Park will offer a wide array of public activities from May through August, many of them free. The season begins May 11 with “Lift Off: A Waterfront Kite Festival.” [Check out our Culture Calendar here.] Arts programs include a free concert presented by the Metropolitan Opera; an outdoor film series that includes screenings of “Crooklyn,” “The Big Lebowski” and “Selma”; an outdoor production of “The Importance of Being Earnest” by the New York Classical Theater; sunset performances by Gibney Dance; an acoustic music series; and “Walt Whitman’s Song of Myself: StoneWalt Edition,” a reading of Whitman’s poetry that will honor his 200th birthday and the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots. Other public offerings at the park include exercise classes, a kayaking program, a stargazing fair and fishing clinics for children and adults. The Brooklyn Bridge Park Conservancy, which organizes and supports programming at Brooklyn Bridge Park, has been offering summer programming there since 2000, when it first started its outdoor film series.

5c59c6a23a125f5075c081d2,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/05/obituaries/jacqueline-steiner-dead.html,"From those first banjo licks, Bostonians know what’s coming: “Let me tell you the story of a man named Charlie. …” As sure as the train is roaring down the tracks, it’s the cautionary tale of Charlie, the Everyman who gets caught up in Boston’s soul-crushing subway system, whence he will never return. Jacqueline Steiner, who died on Jan. 25 at 94, was the lyricist who conjured up poor Charlie early in her singing and songwriting career. She and the song’s co-writer, Bess Lomax Hawes, dashed it off for a Boston mayoral candidate in 1949. They expected it to fade after the election along with their candidate, who received only 1 percent of the vote. But 10 years later, the folk music group the Kingston Trio picked it up. With a slightly new spin, the trio gave it a second life, and their “At Large” album, with the song, “M.T.A.” (also known as “Charlie on the M.T.A.”), as the opening track, hit No. 1 on the charts. “M.T.A.” received an astonishing third life in 2004, when Boston officials did away with subway tokens and issued an automated fare card. They called it the CharlieCard, which is still its name. At the ceremony showing it off, Gov. Mitt Romney heartily joined the Kingston Trio and belted out the song. The original version written by Ms. Steiner and Ms. Hawes and based on the tunes of two old folk songs, had a political edge. They wrote it for a progressive candidate named Walter A. O’Brien, who opposed the latest fare increase. Subway riders would pay a dime to get onto a train, but if they transferred to an aboveground streetcar, they had to pay an extra nickel to exit. (The system was so complex that the M.T.A. issued a 15-page booklet with instructions for both riders and subway operators; the agency ended the system after only a few months.) Charlie, alas, did not have that extra nickel. His absent-minded wife came down to the station every day, but instead of handing him a nickel, “through the open window she hands Charlie a sandwich as the train comes rumblin’ through.” (Ms. Hawes wrote the sandwich verse, which Ms. Steiner always believed gave the song its punch.) Charlie was thus doomed to “ride forever ’neath the streets of Boston / He’s the man who never returned.” After the election, Mr. O’Brien was deemed a Communist and blacklisted. The clean-cut Kingston Trio, trying to advance their careers in the midst of the McCarthy era, generally avoided overtly political songs. They sanitized the Steiner-Hawes version of “M.T.A.” and changed the name Walter O’Brien to the fictitious George O’Brien. The song remains embedded in Boston’s collective unconscious and is something of an unofficial city anthem. It has also served as a metaphor for other horrors, as when a Soviet cosmonaut was stranded in space after the 1991 breakup of the Soviet Union; Fred Small wrote a parody called “Sergei in the Milky Way,” based on the Kingston Trio’s arrangement. Some in Boston find an enduring poetic resonance in Charlie’s plight. Thomas Whalen, a social scientist at Boston University, said that with the fare increase, resentment toward the onerous arm of government and hints of corruption, the song taps into a rich vein of Boston history. “Charlie is caught in that political vortex, as we all are in Boston,” he said in a telephone interview. “It’s this Kafkaesque nightmare — Charlie can’t get off that train.” Jacqueline Steiner was born on Sept. 11, 1924, in Manhattan to Joseph and Jane (Lippert) Steiner. Her father was a clothing retailer, her mother a telephone operator. Her parents divorced when Jackie, as she was known, was a toddler, and two aunts and sometimes her mother raised her, mostly in Greenwich Village. Jackie skipped two grades and arrived at Vassar College at 16. She graduated in 1944 with a bachelor’s degree in philosophy, then headed to Radcliffe to study philosophy but dropped out to pursue a career as a folk singer and songwriter, taking odd jobs to support herself. It was while she was living in Cambridge that she and Ms. Hawes, who died in 2009 at 88, wrote “M.T.A.” Ms. Steiner’s first marriage, to Arnold Berman, ended in divorce after three years. Her second marriage, to Myron Sharpe, ended in divorce in 1980. Her son, Matthew Sharpe, said his mother died from complications of pneumonia in Norwalk, Conn., where she lived. In addition to him, she is survived by her daughter, Susanna Sharpe, and five grandchildren. Ms. Steiner was always politically active, starting early in the peace and civil rights movements. In Norwalk, she served for many years as secretary of the local branch of the N.A.A.C.P. A mezzo-soprano, Ms. Steiner was passionate about singing and playing the guitar. She sang at hootenannies with Pete Seeger and others and studied voice with Max Margulis, a founder of Blue Note Records, who also coached Judy Collins. She also recorded two albums. The first, “No More War,” which she recorded in 1966 as Jacqueline Sharpe, consisted entirely of original antiwar songs. The title track, “No More War,” was based on a 1965 speech by Pope Paul VI at the United Nations. On her second album, “Far Afield: Songs of Three Continents,” released in 1991, she sang her own version of “M.T.A.” as well as songs in multiple languages. As a singer for hire, Ms. Steiner sang solo and in choirs, at churches and synagogues. She even sang for prisoners at Sing Sing. She often hummed around the house, her son said, usually classical music. But at parties, he said, someone would inevitably coax her — “and it didn’t take much coaxing” — to bring out her guitar and sing “M.T.A.” “She wasn’t famous, but the song was famous,” he said. “And it gave her great pleasure to have created something known by so many people, and that had such enduring value.” "
5c545f153a125f5075c078f1,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/01/arts/television/kelly-rowland-gladys-knight-bet.html,"Kelly Rowland has been hearing it for almost as long as she’s been singing. “Always, when I meet somebody, they’re like, ‘Oh man, you look like a young Gladys Knight,’” she recounted. “Well, she’s lovely to me — a beautiful woman. So I definitely love the comparison.” And so apparently does Knight. “It’s no secret that I love my @kellyrowland,” Knight posted on Instagram in October 2016. “So many people have said that Kelly would be the perfect person to star in my biopic.” So when Rowland was asked to portray Knight in “American Soul” — a new BET drama about the evolution of Don Cornelius’s “Soul Train” — “I wondered if somebody was creeping through Gladys’s comments,” Rowland said. “I was beyond flattered because she had such an illustrious career, and I just wanted to soak her up.” Starting last fall, Rowland pored over vintage YouTube clips to help capture Knight’s essence for “American Soul,” debuting Feb. 5, which follows Cornelius as he hitches his wagon to her star in preparation for the show’s syndication on Oct. 2, 1971. The result is a groove down the “Soul Train” line as Rowland channels Knight, swaying in a glittering black evening gown alongside the fast-stepping Pips, in “I Heard It Through the Grapevine”; wrapped in gold knee-high gladiator sandals for “Friendship Train,” which the group performed on that inaugural episode; and seated alone at a piano in a poignant rendition of Knight’s signature song, “Midnight Train to Georgia.” Rowland’s own career skyrocketed in her teens alongside Beyoncé in Destiny’s Child, which in 1998 displayed its own coordinated outfits and synchronized moves on “Soul Train.” And she hasn’t left music behind: In November she released the self-love single “Kelly” as a teaser to a promised album, her first since “Talk a Good Game” in 2013. In a phone interview from Los Angeles, where she lives with her husband, Tim Weatherspoon, a talent manager, and Titan, their 4-year-old son, Rowland, 37, spoke about channeling a legend and the politics of the Super Bowl. Here are edited experts from the conversation. Did you grow up watching “Soul Train”? Oh, I absolutely did. “Soul Train” was one of my first memories of watching all these different beautiful black people dancing and having a good time, and that was just a moment for me. I remember wanting to dress like the women who had expressions of self and freedom. I remember watching so many different girl groups — was it En Vogue or SWV? — and them just making it look so fun. And I would emulate the dancers, whether it was pop locking or jumping from that one platform and landing in the splits. How intimidating was it playing the Empress of Soul? It wasn’t intimidating until I remember watching one performance of her doing “Midnight Train to Georgia.” And it was of course with the Pips, and they’re on a dark stage and she has a beautiful dress on, and it’s just so effortless. From all of her movements to the different inflections in her face, I sat there and just studied it for days and days and days. She’s an effortless voice, an effortless talent, and I think that’s what people have always loved about Gladys. Did you try to mimic her voice? There is only one Gladys Knight, and I completely love and respect her, and there is no voice in the world that sounds like hers. What I did do — because I wanted to have a little bit more rasp to my voice — I would take shots of whiskey and I would scream really loud to try to get it as scratchy as possible or be around people who were smoking in a cloud of smoke and inhale. And all of that still didn’t work. [Laughs] When I finally got a cold and my voice got raspy, I was like, “Oh my God, it’s so exciting!” What’s it like interpreting the classic “Midnight Train to Georgia”? Like, I can’t even say [starts to sing] “L.A.” [Pause] Oh my gosh, the very first verse literally gets me choked up. I think it’s one of the deepest love songs ever written, and it’s extremely personal to me now. It was personal before, because I am an Atlanta girl and Gladys is an Atlanta girl. But now I can’t wait to have a conversation with her to ask exactly what this song is about. I want to know where she was singing from. Are you nervous about her reaction to your performance? Yes, yes, I’m so nervous to have her watch me, for sure! Knight has been getting blowback for her decision to sing the national anthem at the Super Bowl. You appeared as part of Beyoncé’s halftime show in 2013. Is performing at the Super Bowl a political act? I think the interesting times that we’re in right now, in politics and opinions, make it very touchy. And I’ll keep my answer right there. Because it’s really unfortunate that we’re in this place where even having your opportunity … she probably wanted to do the national anthem her whole career, and here we are at a moment where you make one decision, and some people are excited and some people are really, really upset about it. [Sighs] It really is a tough one. Michelle Williams, your former Destiny’s Child collaborator, is playing Diana Ross in “American Soul.” Was there any competition about who could better recreate a diva? When she told me she got the role, I was excited and couldn’t wait to see her performance. We just didn’t have that competition moment and we probably should have! Any plans for another Destiny’s Child reunion? Everybody is like, “Oh my God, when’s it going to …” Our kids have play dates, and we hang out for girls’ nights, but it hasn’t been anything that we’ve talked about. And … yeah! Do you feel any extra pressure raising a boy in such turbulent times? I feel like it’s a great responsibility to raise a good man, respectful, with integrity, honest, a great sense of self-assurance. That’s the pressure that I feel ever since he was in my womb. My gosh, I think Mike Brown had just been killed, and it was a series of killings of black boys back-to-back. And I remember holding my belly, weeping, because I was thinking, I have a black boy and he’s going to come into this world and how do I protect him from ignorance? How do I protect him from any and everything — when they fall, when they’re learning to meet friends, when they’re going to have a job interview. Of course, God’s bigger than me, and he was just like, “You’ve got this.” I feel like God was like, “I created woman on purpose. I’ve created you this way for a reason, and you have everything it is that you need to raise this child.” RCA dropped R. Kelly after a documentary resurrected sexual-misconduct allegations. Last month, Mathew Knowles, Beyoncé’s father, spoke about keeping him away from Destiny’s Child. You went on to record songs with him. Any thoughts in hindsight? No, I’d honestly rather not say. I will keep my comments to myself at this moment because I’m still downloading all of this like everybody else is. You’ve vowed to finally release an album this year. What should we expect from your music-making?  I’m at the point where I feel like as long as I’m having fun making music, I can do whatever I want to do. Not follow anybody else’s standards, only my own. And music that I’m excited about, that I want to share with people, that I want them to be inspired by. On this next album, I want people to actually meet me. “Kelly,” your latest, very danceable single, feels like a proclamation of where you are in life. So what do you mean when you sing, “Kelly ain’t humble no mo’”? What I mean is, usually I let so many different things slide and it’s, “Oh, it’s so sweet, Kelly, it’s sweet.” I’m so sick of that word. “She’s sweet.” [Laughs] Because I am a kind person, but what I’m saying is: Don’t take my kindness for weakness.

5ca0debc49f0eacbf1f7afba,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/31/obituaries/david-white-dead.html,"David White, who formed the doo-wop quartet Danny and the Juniors in the mid-1950s, co-wrote their No. 1 hit “At the Hop” and composed their successful follow-up, “Rock and Roll Is Here to Stay,” died on March 16 in Las Vegas. He was 79. His daughter Wendy Adamczyk said the cause was lung and throat cancer. Like many other teenagers in the early days of rock ’n’ roll, Mr. White and his friends Danny Rapp, Frank Maffei and Joe Terranova (also known as Joe Terry), who called themselves the Juvenaires, harmonized in cars and school bathrooms. Their singing on a street corner in Philadelphia in 1957 attracted the attention of John Madara, then a 19-year-old singer, who heard them through his bedroom window. “The next day I asked some friends, ‘I heard this great group. Do you know who they are?’ And he said, ‘Yeah, that was Danny Rapp and the guys,’ ” Mr. Madara recalled in an interview in 2014 with Tom Meros for his online series “Tom TV.” Aware of Mr. Madara’s interest in the group, Mr. White found his way to Mr. Madara’s apartment, where they struck up a friendship and agreed to work together. Mr. Madara suggested they write a song that would play off teenagers dancing the bop on the television show “American Bandstand” and have an infectious beat like Jerry Lee Lewis’s recent rockabilly hit “Whole Lotta Shakin’ Goin’ On.”  With help from Artie Singer, a vocal coach and producer, they made a demo record, “Do the Bop,” with Mr. Madara singing lead and the Juvenaires singing backup. But when Mr. Singer and Mr. Madara brought the demo to Prep Records, it was rejected. “Artie took it to Dick Clark” — then a powerful Philadelphia disc jockey as well as the host of “American Bandstand” — “who suggested the title change to ‘At the Hop,’ ” Mr. White said in an interview in 2013 with the blog Milwaukee Opportunities. The group recorded a new version — only the lyrics needed to be changed — with Mr. Rapp singing lead. Mr. Clark agreed to play the song and gave it a huge boost in late 1957, when he had the group, now renamed Danny and the Juniors, on “Bandstand.” It leapt to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and stayed there for seven weeks. Hoping to repeat the success of “At the Hop,” Mr. White wrote “Rock and Roll Is Here to Stay” in early 1958 while touring with the group in Davenport, Iowa. It was not the hit “At the Hop” was — it peaked at No. 19 — but it acted as an enthusiastic rebuke to adults’ view of rock as a short-lived fad that tore at teenagers’ moral fiber. “Rock and roll is here to stay,” they sang. “It will never die/It was meant to be that way/Though I don’t know why.” David Ernest White was born on Nov. 26, 1939, in Philadelphia. When he was 3 he joined his parents, Frank and Marcia Tricker, in their acrobatic touring act, Barry and Brenda and Company. David showed an early interest in music; he began playing piano, clarinet and trombone in elementary school and was writing songs at 14. The Juvenaires, which Mr. White formed when he was about 15, sang at local parties and other events. Sometimes they practiced in Mr. White’s 1953 Pontiac so that they would not disturb the neighbors. Danny and the Juniors had a few modest hits after “At the Hop” and “Rock and Roll Is Here to Stay,” but none that kept them atop the charts. Mr. White left the group around 1961 and, in partnership with Mr. Madara, wrote many songs, including the Top 10 hits “The Fly” (1961), for Chubby Checker; “You Don’t Own Me” (1963), for Lesley Gore; and “1-2-3” (1965), for Len Barry. In 1965, Mr. White, Mr. Madara and Ray Gilmore formed a short-lived group, the Spokesmen, and together wrote a single, “The Dawn of Correction,” an optimistic corrective to Barry McGuire’s foreboding No. 1 hit, “Eve of Destruction.” It rose to No. 36 on the Hot 100. Mr. White found less success afterward. He broke up with Mr. Madara, released a solo album under the name David White Tricker, which did not do well; lived for a time in a trailer park; worked on various musical and film projects; and wrote a memoir that has not yet been published. He also collected royalties from filmmakers and advertisers eager to license songs from his archive, especially “At the Hop” and “Rock and Roll Is Here to Stay.” In the late 1960s, Mr. Rapp formed an all-new version of Danny and the Juniors, which toured the country; at one point he asked Mr. White to join him. While they never reunited, Mr. White sang a few songs with Mr. Rapp’s group at a lounge near Lake Tahoe in 1982. “He was real up, he was real excited about seeing me,” Mr. White told The Los Angeles Times in 1988. “I came very close to going back with him because he was working like crazy.” It was the last time they saw each other. Mr. Rapp died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in 1983. Mr. Terry and Mr. Maffei continued to perform occasionally as Danny and the Juniors, along with Mr. Maffei’s brother, Bob. In addition to Ms. Adamczyk, Mr. White is survived by his wife, Sandra (Simone) White; another daughter, Jody Conrad, and three grandchildren. A third daughter, Linda White, died in 2013. "
5c6e180e3a125f5075c0ab59,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/20/arts/who-is-jussie-smollett.html,"The “Empire” star Jussie Smollett, who was charged on Wednesday with staging a racist and homophobic attack on himself in Chicago last month, has been under a bright spotlight in recent weeks — but perhaps not for reasons that a career actor and singer would prefer. Mr. Smollett, who is black and openly gay, reported in January that he was the victim of an attack during which masked men poured chemicals on him and put a noose around his neck, prompting an outpouring of support from fans, activists and politicians. In a major twist, Mr. Smollett, who is in his mid-30s, was charged Wednesday with a felony count of disorderly conduct in connection with the episode. Mr. Smollett is best known for his acting role on “Empire,” a hip-hop drama on Fox, in which he plays a son vying for the throne of his father’s music empire. Growing up with five siblings pursuing careers in acting, modeling and music, Mr. Smollett first appeared on the big screen in 1992. He has landed supporting roles in several other films and television shows since, while also beginning a career as an R&B singer. [Here’s a timeline of what has transpired since Mr. Smollett reported the attack.] “Empire,” which finished its fifth season last year, follows a former drug dealer turned hip-hop mogul, Lucious Lyon, whose three sons must compete to run his multimillion-dollar company. Mr. Smollett’s character, Jamal Lyon, is a gay singer-songwriter who starts the series estranged from his father because of his sexuality. Mr. Smollett sings in and has written for the soundtrack of the series. As a child, Mr. Smollett landed a role in the family comedy film “The Mighty Ducks,” about a lawyer who must coach a youth hockey team after he was sentenced to community service. Two years later, Mr. Smollett starred with five of his brothers and sisters in an ABC sitcom called “On Our Own,” about siblings who are orphaned after their parents die in a car accident. Mr. Smollett’s younger sister, Jurnee Smollett-Bell, has grown up to make her mark in the acting world as well. She is one of the leads in “Underground,” a WGN America show about a group of slaves who try to escape from their Georgia plantation. Mr. Smollett is a guest star on the show. In 2017, Mr. Smollett appeared in the science-fiction thriller “Alien: Covenant.” That year, he also played Langston Hughes in the film “Marshall,” a biopic about Thurgood Marshall, the first African-American Supreme Court justice. Mr. Smollett and his siblings have been outspoken politically and devoted to causes like H.I.V./AIDS prevention and racial justice. Mr. Smollett sits on the board of four charity organizations, including the Trayvon Martin Foundation and the Black AIDS Institute, according to his website. Mr. Smollett also has a singing career separate from “Empire.” Last March, he released a 10-song R&B album. Days after he reported the attack, Mr. Smollett performed for a sold-out crowd in West Hollywood, Calif., telling his fans that he would not let his attackers win and that he “had to be here tonight.” Mr. Smollett told the police in January that, while walking in downtown Chicago, he had been confronted by masked white men who directed homophobic and racial slurs at him and announced it was “MAGA country,” a reference to President Trump’s campaign slogan. As Mr. Smollett has faced questions about whether his hate crime report was truthful, he has continued to insist that the incident occurred just as he reported it. In a statement released by Fox on Wednesday, before the Chicago police labeled Mr. Smollett a suspect in the case, the network said his character was not being written out of “Empire” in response to the police’s announcement that the trajectory of the investigation had changed, contrary to reports from multiple news outlets. Fox later declined to comment after Mr. Smollett was charged. On Wednesday night, following his indictment, his lawyers said in a statement, “Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked.” "
5c339b373a125f5075c0334b,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/07/arts/dance/review-caleb-teicher-conrad-tao-more-forever.html,"Grainy and circular, the sound in the dark could be that of a scratchy old record. But when the lights come up, you see that it is the tap dancer Caleb Teicher, caressing a sanded floor with his leather shoes: not a scratchy old record at all, but a young artist trying new things. In “More Forever,” which had its premiere in the Guggenheim Museum’s Works & Process series on Sunday, Mr. Teicher is joined by his company and at the piano by the composer Conrad Tao. Mr. Teicher and Mr. Tao are former teenage prodigies, now in their mid-20s, garnering much attention and acclaim as they mature in public. At its best, their “More Forever” is both youthful and sophisticated. This is a tap show without tap shoes. Mr. Teicher is reaching back before the invention of metal taps to an earlier tradition of thumping and scraping, but he applies it to his own ends. He starts quietly in a corner of the stage, and as other dancers pass through, trailing what looks like sand (it’s cornmeal) from their fists, they leave another soloist in another corner. This happens again and again, until the corners are full. Suddenly, a dancer center stage (the ebullient Macy Sullivan) takes the dance up tempo and onto the balls of her feet. The other dancers follow, locking into diagonals, lines and circles while the rhythms change. One by one, they depart, exiting with a funny little hop. Such compositional finesse is impressive. And the whimsy of that exit proves typical. (Mr. Tao later plays a toy piano.) But typical, too, is a note of wistfulness. Even as those hopping exits tickle the audience into giggles, they resonate as leave-takings. The dancers often face away from us, sometimes in silhouette. In a ballroom duet, Nathan Bugh and Evita Arce clench the sandlike powder in their fists, giving their tango and salsa partnering a poignant awkwardness (they can’t fully connect) and their footwork a scouring rasp as the powder escapes. This mixed tone, a strength of “More Forever,” may also be related to its dissatisfactions. The choreography effortlessly blends tap with Lindy Hop and same-sex partnering that’s wonderfully matter-of-fact. Mr. Tao’s piano-based score is more effortful in its use of electronics and its many modes — Romantic, Modernist, swinging jazz, all oddly with a harmonic and rhythmic undertow of Bossa Nova. But the dance and the music are tightly connected, and what they have most in common is a love of pauses, of pulling back. The result is a work of many pregnant silences but one that is too quick to land whenever it gets off the ground — as it does, especially, in Mr. Teicher’s solos, Astaire-like in their wildness. The hourlong composition, resisting its own momentum, breaks into too many disparate pieces, nearly as loose and attenuated as the stuff on the floor. Nevertheless, a theme does emerge, a concern with sand in the hourglass, the sound from the beginning that returns at the end. “I thought I would have more time,” Mr. Teicher sings near the end, with premature plaintiveness. Fortunately, he does. "

5c890d4349f0eacbf105cd55,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/13/arts/dance/temptations-sergio-trujillo.html,"Five handsome men, dressed sharp. Golden-voiced singers, each distinctly soulful, harmonizing on hit after hit. That they could also move well, smoothly executing snazzy, classy choreography, might have seemed extra. Yet it was essential to what made the Temptations exceptional and enduring. Think about it: Does anyone dance quite the way they did anymore? Not really. Not even the extremely talented cast of “Ain’t Too Proud: The Life and Times of the Temptations,” which opens at the Imperial Theater on Broadway on March 21. Times change. The past can never be wholly recaptured. Those are themes in this jukebox musical, which tells the story of the Temptations from the perspective of Otis Williams, the sole surviving original member (and an executive producer of the show). And deep in the second act, when consequences and regrets are starting to pile up, the actor playing Mr. Williams (Derrick Baskin) says, “Don’t nothing rewind but a song.” Change can be lamented or embraced. Sergio Trujillo, the choreographer of “Ain’t Too Proud,” is the embracing type. “It was important to me,” he said before a recent preview performance, “that an audience that knows the Temptations is able to watch the show and think, ‘That’s what I remember.’ But it’s also important to look through the lens of today.” The question he asked himself was: “If I were choreographing for the Temptations now, what would I do?” What he did was create choreography that is more intricate, stylistically varied and narratively sophisticated than anything the Temptations ever approached. All the characteristic slides and pivots and gestures in relay are in there, but amid a whole lot more. So while “Ain’t Too Proud” honors the past, it also brings out differences between dancing in Motown back then and dancing on Broadway now. The Temptations were not trained dancers. At first, they didn’t think of themselves as dancers at all. “We would just stand and sing, or sit and sing,” Mr. Williams, 77, recalled over the phone. The show has fun with this fact in an early scene. Paul Williams (no relation to Otis Williams) tries to get the other guys to dance in their act and they resist, claiming they can’t. He has to convince them that the ladies will like it. Paul Williams, who died in 1973, did give the Temptations their first moves. In 1965, though, they started working with a professional choreographer: Cholly Atkins. He is not a character in “Ain’t Too Proud.” But that omission, presumably for narrative economy, has some historical justification. In his 2001 autobiography, “Class Act” (written with Jacqui Malone), Mr. Atkins says that Motown artists were often told to say that they did their own choreography. He was part of the behind-the-scenes operation. That operation was called Artist Development, and it was a critical component in the vision of Motown’s founder, Berry Gordy. “Berry always wanted Motown artists to be more than recording artists,” said Shelly Berger, who became the Temptations manager in 1966. (He’s a creative consultant for “Ain’t Too Proud,” as well as a character in it.) And so the people hired for Artist Development were show-business veterans, there to teach the kids how to become versatile entertainers. Mr. Atkins was a tap dancer. Born in 1913, he came of age when tap, a sibling of jazz, was at its cultural peak — ubiquitous in nightclubs, Broadway shows and Hollywood musicals. As a black man, Mr. Atkins found little success in segregated Hollywood; he dubbed tap sounds for white dancers, gave ideas to Eleanor Powell. But in New York, with Honi Coles, a virtuoso once considered to have the fastest feet in the business, he formed a great partnership. Mr. Coles and Atkins were in the tradition known as the class act: suave, debonair, cultivated. They sang a little, told jokes, and danced in several styles. Their soft-shoe was recklessly slow, a nonchalant tightrope walk of graceful control and rhythmic exactitude.They toured with the big bands of Cab Calloway and Count Basie. They appeared on Broadway in “Gentlemen Prefer Blondes.” But by then, the early 1950s, tap was falling out of fashion. It got a shove from the rise of rock ‘n’ roll and rhythm and blues. At places like the Apollo Theater in Harlem, a home for tap, R&B revues took over. Coles became the theater’s production manager, appalled by the teenagers with hit records and no understanding of theatrical etiquette as basic as how to bow. Mr. Atkins began to teach them. Before long, word got around, especially when people caught what Mr. Atkins had done with Gladys Knight and the Pips. He was 30 years older than they were, and they called him Pop or Pops, names that stuck when Motown hired him as its official choreographer. “Pops refined the Temptations,” Otis Williams recalled. “What he did was dramatic but more economic, so we wouldn’t overly exert ourselves but still could get across.” Mr. Atkins called this technique “vocal choreography,” an art of moving for vocalists. It was dancing that accommodated a singer’s need to breathe and to get back to the microphone on time. In the right spots, it could be complex — feet following the bass line as voices sang a different rhythm. “But Pops would always stress, ‘Remember you guys are singers first,’” Mr. Williams said. Mr. Atkins was a taskmaster (“like a drill sergeant,” Mr. Berger said), but he adjusted to the skills of each group. “Let the punishment fit the crime” was his motto. The Four Tops didn’t get much more than some windshield-wiper bending. The Pips and the Supremes and the Temptations got the works. They were being groomed for “the smart rooms,” Mr. Williams said: supper clubs like the Copacabana, places where few black acts were invited. Along with their hits, they sang standards, and Mr. Atkins taught them routines with hats and canes. You can see the results in “TCB,” the Temptations’ 1968 television special with the Supremes, and especially on their 1969 special, “G.I.T. On Broadway,” an hour of nothing but show tunes. Every time one of Mr. Atkins’s groups appeared on television — on Ed Sullivan, “American Bandstand,” “Shindig,” “Soul Train” — they were spreading the tap and jazz steps he had learned when he was young, keeping those moves in cultural circulation as another generation picked them up from TV. He continued to choreograph for the Temptations until his death in 2003. By then, the group’s roster had turned over many times (there have been more than 20 Temptations). And the way the Temptations danced, once so current, had become a period style. It was around that time that Mr. Trujillo, born in Colombia in 1963, began choreographing “Jersey Boys,” the 2005 jukebox musical about the Four Seasons. For research, he studied videos of the old TV shows, footage of all the old groups. Since the Four Seasons didn’t move much, he had a free hand. “What I created,” he said, “was like the Temptations more than anything.” “Ain’t Too Proud” came with different pressures: “Can I live up to the legend of these great performers known for their dancing?” he asked himself. “With the confidence of having done other shows of the period” — “All Shook Up,” “Memphis” — “I let myself create with abandonment.” First, though, he wanted to earn the audience’s trust. And so the opening number of “Ain’t Too Proud” (“The Way You Do the Things You Do”) is very old school. Some of the lyrics are pantomimed baldly (opening the schoolbook), and when the narrator affectionately mocks those lyrics for corniness, he could be speaking of the choreography, too. Immediately after, the simplicity recedes. For Mr. Trujillo is tasked, as Cholly Atkins never was, with helping to tell a story, the plot of how the Temptations got together and what they went through. And over the course of the show, as the group’s music changes, getting funky or psychedelic, responding to the riots and assassinations of the late 1960s, the dancing also changes, turning harder-edged, angrier, more technically and emotionally complex. Throughout, the base style — “sprinkled with period authenticity,” in Mr. Trujillo’s words — tilts contemporary: sharper, bolder in attack. The Supremes in this show pop their hips with much more sexual frankness than the demure originals would have been allowed. Mr. Trujillo is also working with a different kind of performer. Ephraim Sykes, who plays David Ruffin — one of the group’s lead singers — trained at the Alvin Ailey school and danced in the junior Ailey troupe. He has mastered some of Mr. Ruffin’s signature moves: splits; tossing a microphone in the air, spinning, dropping to his knees and catching the mic. But he also does much that Mr. Ruffin never attempted. “I try to push my body as far as it can go,” Mr. Sykes said. “But also, how cool can I make it? That’s period for me. You didn’t see them try. Even the tricks I do that David never did, I’m trying to keep it so cool that it looks like David could’ve done them.” Dancing that hard and still having to sing as well as David Ruffin isn’t nearly as easy as Mr. Sykes makes it look. “Singers and dancers are taught to breath in opposite ways,” he said, one relaxing where the other tightens. “I’m trying to use my dance training with a singer’s mind.” Part of that dance training is in communicating with the body. “How they walked, how they stood, the pride of the city of Detroit, the bop in their step — it says so much about their times,” Mr. Sykes said. In “Ain’t Too Proud,” even when the Temptations aren’t doing a dance number — in scenes between Otis Williams and his wife, for example — the five men are often present onstage like a cool Greek chorus. Their physical presence shows how they were always in one another’s thoughts. That’s the kind of metaphor present nowhere in the choreography of Cholly Atkins. But what it looks like is five guys snapping and lightly swaying, as Cholly Atkins taught the Temptations to do. "
5c520dc13a125f5075c072d3,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/30/arts/music/david-daniels-opera-sexual-assault.html,"The opera singer David Daniels, one of the world’s leading countertenors, was arrested on Tuesday on a sexual assault charge stemming from a 2010 incident in Houston. Mr. Daniels and his husband, Scott Walters, were arrested Tuesday afternoon in Michigan, where they live, on warrants issued by the Houston Police Department, said Detective Lt. Aimee Metzer of the Ann Arbor Police Department. The two men, who were being held in the Washtenaw County Jail in Michigan on Wednesday while awaiting a hearing on bail and extradition, denied the accusations. Mr. Daniels rose to fame as a countertenor, singing high parts that were once the province of castratos or mezzo-sopranos at the Metropolitan Opera and around the world. When he and Mr. Walters were married in 2014, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, an avid opera fan, officiated. Now, with his arrest, Mr. Daniels becomes the most prominent classical music star to face criminal charges of sexual misconduct in the wake of the national #MeToo reckoning. Mr. Daniels and Mr. Walters were each charged with sexual assault in connection to a 2010 incident in which a singer said he was drugged and assaulted by the couple, according to charging documents filed by the Harris County District Attorney’s Office in Texas. The singer, Samuel Schultz, said in an interview in August that the two men assaulted him in May 2010, when, as a graduate student at Rice University in Houston, he had gone to hear Mr. Daniels in Handel’s “Xerxes” at Houston Grand Opera. After attending the performance and cast party, Mr. Schultz said, he was invited to Mr. Daniels and Mr. Walters’s apartment. There, he said, he was given a drink that caused him to lose consciousness. He awoke alone, he said, naked and bleeding from his rectum. A lawyer for Mr. Daniels and Mr. Walters denied the accusations. “David and Scott are innocent of any wrongdoing,” their lawyer, Matt Hennessy, said in a statement. “Sam Schultz is not a victim. He never would have gotten this much attention from his singing, and he knows and resents that fact. He waited eight years to complain about adult, consensual sex to ride the #MeToo movement to unearned celebrity. We will fight this.” Mr. Schultz said in an email that he had been told about the arrests by the Houston police, but he declined further comment. Mr. Schultz said over the summer that he had initially been afraid that making the accusations would damage his fledgling career. But he went public last summer — first anonymously, in an online post, and then naming Mr. Daniels and Mr. Walters as his attackers in an interview with The New York Daily News. A Houston police officer, D.H. Escobar, wrote in the charging documents that he had found Mr. Schultz, who was identified in the report only by his initials, to be “credible and reliable.” The officer said that he had met with a therapist Mr. Schultz consulted in 2010, and that her notes were consistent with what Mr. Schultz had told the police. The officer said that he had also reviewed medical records which showed that Mr. Schultz had sought medical attention “as a result of the sexual assault” on June 1, 2010. The charging documents state that the Houston police officer had reviewed a report by the University of Michigan Police Department, which had also investigated the incident over the summer. According to that report, Mr. Daniels had told university police that he had invited Mr. Schultz back to his apartment for a nightcap, where “things became sexual.” Mr. Walters told the university police that Mr. Schultz had taken an Ambien after seeing Mr. Walters and Mr. Daniels take them, according the report, adding that he then grew “woozy.” And Mr. Daniels told the police that, two days after that encounter, Mr. Schultz had “freaked out” and contacted him and Mr. Walters, telling them “you know what you did” before blocking further contact with them, the report said. Mr. Daniels has been a voice professor in recent years at the University of Michigan. A student paper, The Michigan Daily, reported that the school granted Mr. Daniels tenure in May, despite the fact that it had received an anonymous complaint of sexual misconduct two months earlier. Another student, Andrew Lipian, sued the school and Mr. Daniels in October, accusing Mr. Daniels of sexual misconduct; Mr. Daniels filed a countersuit. Kim Broekhuizen, a spokeswoman for the university, said in an email that Mr. Daniels had been on leave since August. “We will continue to closely monitor the situation as we determine the appropriate next steps,” she said.

As always, I loved Sam Trabucco’s style and got a kick out of his cluing and most of today’s nine debuts. (The meh ones were I COULDN’T and HOME CARE, not that there’s anything wrong with either one, they just weren’t remarkable. Certainly not a constructor’s fault.) The first clues that delighted me were VILA and VANILLI, which I would call a personal reverse Natick, since I was able to ink them in with total confidence.

I also misremembered the whole Milli Vanilli story, which turned very tragic, but their music is very embedded in my mind with my college experience, so any mention makes me pleasantly nostalgic (this is only the second time we’ve seen VANILLI, and it’s been more than 20 years). My college memories are free of PEP BANDS, by the way, which was also a debut.  After picking through much of the upper right, my letters spread south and west, petering out at the lower left corner, which stumped me most. There was tough stuff, though, throughout this whole grid. A couple of misdirections I was fond of were clues for ESP and GLAND, and there were fun clues galore. ARIE, clued as such, made me grimace for a second, but I didn’t dwell on it. 13A: I thought “overrode” had to be the thing here, for “Domineered,” and rolled my eyes a little at OVERBORE, which doesn’t strike me as a word. Wrong! It has even been in the puzzle before, multiple times. I was not overbored by this grid today, Mr. Trabucco, I feel you went quite overboard to amuse us.  15A: I am pre-nostalgic for the group in question here, the modern and still-existent GORILLAZ. This is one of those very insidery double clues, by the way; one of the founders of GORILLAZ is Damon Albarn, who is also in Blur, one of the bands mentioned in the crossing clue at 4D. I actually knew this, but I didn’t think of him as a poster child for BRITPOP (even though he is, as I learned once I consulted the world); I also had always assumed that GORILLAZ was a hipster misspelling of “guerrillas,” not anything to do with the Monkees. So there’s another bit of critical life information we’ve acquired today. I had never actually seen the humans behind the band in question, because they are often represented by cartoon characters, even when I’ve seen videos of them performing live. 16A: Right after a 21st-century pop music reference, bam! An abstruse compendium of world literary figures like Jeppe Aakjaer, a novelist who “was intensely concerned with social misery and the need for reform.” BENET’S Reader’s Encyclopedia was first edited, in 1948, by William Rose Benét, older brother of Stephen Vincent. There was an edition in 2008; there may be one in the works right now. 44A: In a rebuttal to the old “Plus ça change” argument, some aficionados among you may find it bemusing that this word, LICTORS, and its singular variant, were considered entries for early in the week, including a Monday puzzle back in 1954 (clued as “Fasces bearer in ancient Rome”). I was inordinately stumped by this entry and hit a dead end at its crossing with 45D, too, as I knew nothing of California’s Fort ORD. That little filler word is usually clued as an airport.  7D: It felt as if the four 12-letter entries in this puzzle split into pairs, with this one, the punnily clued DRAMA COACHES, crossing IM SPEECHLESS. 8D, which referenced the top entry on a Sports Illustrated list that I had certainly heard about but never examined, was one half of the other pair of 12-letter entries. The entry here is MIRACLE ON ICE — the unlikely 1980 Olympic hockey victory that was all rife with Cold War gravitas and rah rah United States patriotism. I’m just not familiar, except that I worked with one of the Times reporters who covered it, the perspicacious Craig Whitney, and he was still telling pretty riveting stories 25 years later in the newsroom. (It looks as if he took some part in a documentary, in case this event is also your No. 1 and you want more, more, more.) As far as 27A, the 12-letter entry crossing the above, this idiom made me think of my No. 1 “moment in sports history,” which was at 13 on the Sports Illustrated list. Can a horse PUT ON A CLINIC? It’s not like we could ask any of the rivals he left far, far behind in the dust; they would just shake their heads and murmur “neigh.” Is it silly that I get a little teary whenever I see Secretariat looking as if he could have soared 10 more miles with a sack of potatoes on his back? It took me forever to get the middle of this grid to work, to the point where I’m thrilled with how it turned out (ARIE and EERO notwithstanding). Often with this sort of design, though, you get the middle to work and then find that one of the corners won’t cooperate — I was happy to skate by here, though I’m not exactly in love with the SW (it’s certainly less colorful than I’d hope for, and LICTORS is a bit of a deep cut). I’m not one to include a ton of sports stuff in a crossword, so consider this grid with its skiing, hockey, football and ESPN references to be an anomaly. Sports are more my dad’s speed, so it’s a fun coincidence that it’s his birthday today! Happy birthday! I hope this crossword puzzle makes up for all the sports I quit during elementary school. Subscribers can take a peek at the answer key.  Trying to get back to the puzzle page? Right here.  What did you think? "
5c6c40b63a125f5075c0a709,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/19/obituaries/guy-webster-dead.html,"Guy Webster was smoking pot with the Mamas & the Papas in the group’s rented house in Los Angeles in 1966 when he had an idea about how to photograph them for the cover of their debut album. He told them to head into a bathroom, where all four squeezed, fully clothed, into the tub: John Phillips sat in the foreground, and behind him were Cass Elliot, Denny Doherty and Michelle Phillips, her legs stretched across the others’ laps. (Mr. Doherty told a slightly different story: that they had been hiding from Mr. Webster in the tub.) “You can see how stoned they were,” Mr. Webster said when he showed the picture to an audience attending an exhibition about his career at the Annenberg Space for Photography in Los Angeles in 2012. But the picture had a flaw: It included the toilet — an image, he said, that would have limited sales of the album, “If You Can Believe Your Eyes and Ears,” in family-oriented chain stores. “So Lou Adler,” he continued, referring to the producer of the album and the president of Dunhill Records, “came up with the idea that when we put shrink wrap over the album, and put a sticker on it that says, ‘Including “California Dreamin’,” we can sell it at Sears. And when the kids take it off, there’s the toilet.” “If You Can Believe Your Eyes and Ears” rose to No. 1 on the Billboard album chart and enhanced Mr. Webster’s growing reputation as one of the top rock ’n’ roll photographers of his time. Over a frenetic period between the mid-1960s and the early ’70s, Mr. Webster shot album covers for the Rolling Stones, the Doors, Simon & Garfunkel, Captain Beefheart, the Byrds, the Beach Boys, Tim Buckley and Nico, as well as continuing to work with the Mamas & the Papas. “He knew about the power and longevity of music,” Harvey Kubernik, who, with his brother, Kenneth, wrote “Big Shots: Rock Legends and Hollywood Icons: The Photography of Guy Webster” (2014), said by telephone. “He treated music as an art form that would be around for the next century.” Mr. Webster died on Feb. 5 in Ojai, Calif. He was 79. His wife, Leone (James) Webster, said the cause was liver cancer. Several months after that bathtub session, Mr. Webster invited the Doors to his small studio behind his parents’ house in Beverly Hills to photograph them for their first album, which would be released in early 1967. “In walked Jim Morrison, and he said, ‘Guy!’ ” Mr. Webster recalled in an interview in “Big Shots.” He did not recognize this longhaired lead singer, but Mr. Morrison reminded him that they had been in the same philosophy class at U.C.L.A. After removing his cheap beribboned shirt at Mr. Webster’s request, Mr. Morrison became the focus of the cover photo, his face much larger than those of Ray Manzarek, Robby Krieger and John Densmore, who looked more like satellites than bandmates. “I’m sure they hated me for this cover because they weren’t equal in size,” Mr. Webster said at the Annenberg lecture. “The songwriter is the guy on the far right — Krieger wrote ‘Light My Fire,’ Morrison didn’t.” But, he added, “I’m happy I went with it, because it was so popular.” Guy Michael Webster was born on Sept. 14, 1939, in Los Angeles. His father, Paul Francis Webster, was a lyricist who shared Academy Awards for best original song for “The Shadow of Your Smile,” “Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing” and “Secret Love.” His mother, Gloria (Benguiat) Webster, was a homemaker. After graduating from Beverly Hills High School, Guy attended Whittier College and then entered the Army, stationed at Ford Ord in California. When asked whether he knew anything about photography, he pretended that he did and quickly began studying photograph books in the base’s library. He eventually became the head of its photo department. After his discharge, he disappointed his parents by telling them he would study photography at Art Center College of Design in Pasadena rather than attend Yale. They refused to pay for his education, fearing he would become no more than a paparazzo. While he was at Art Center, his ambition to be a fine-art photographer was derailed by his friend Terry Melcher, Doris Day’s son, who was a producer for Columbia Records. Mr. Melcher introduced him to Mr. Adler, who was intrigued by Mr. Webster’s portfolio and hired him at Dunhill. One early project was Barry McGuire’s third album, named for his apocalyptic hit single, “Eve of Destruction” (1965). For the cover, in black and white, he photographed Mr. McGuire in a manhole. Columbia asked Mr. Webster to work with Simon & Garfunkel on their album “Sounds of Silence” (1966). He brought the duo to the shady grasslands of Franklin Canyon in Los Angeles, where he posed them on a dirt road looking as if they were walking into an unknown future. He also brought them to meet his father, who had collaborated with Johnny Mercer, Hoagy Carmichael and others. “Paul Simon said, ‘Hey, you want to hear our new song?’ ” Mr. Webster recalled in “Big Shots.” “And he pulled out his guitar in the living room in Beverly Hills, and my dad was sitting there, who is not a rock and roller, and he listened to ‘Sounds of Silence’ for the first time. ‘Oh, my God, you guys, what a brilliant song.’ ” By the early 1970s, Mr. Webster, burned out by the pace of his rock work, moved to Europe for several years. In Italy, he studied art history at the University of Florence and started building a large collection of vintage Italian motorcycles. Returning to the United States, he began photographing Hollywood stars like Jack Nicholson, Dennis Hopper, Candice Bergen and Jane Fonda. He also photographed actors for publicity shots and movie productions on location. “He had an ability to make celebrities feel very safe,” Leone Webster said in a telephone interview. “He also had these adorable pictures of the Kardashian girls growing up — he was like their family photographer.” In addition to his wife, Mr. Webster is survived by his daughters, Sarah, Merry, Jessie and Erin Webster; a son, Michael; two grandchildren; and a brother, Roger, who is also known as Mona. His marriage to Bettie Beal ended in divorce. Mr. Webster’s work with the Rolling Stones — including the photo for the bucolic cover of the United States release of the anthology “Big Hits (High Tide and Green Grass)” (1966) — began with an unusual offer in 1965 from Andrew Loog Oldham, their producer and manager: Take photographs, but don’t expect to be paid because it’s an honor simply to work with the band. “And I said, ‘Well, it’s an honor for you that I take these pictures,’ ” Mr. Webster said at the Annenberg event. “He paid me for one album cover. Three of them came out during the years using my photographs.” "
5c82af9e49f0eacbf105c1a0,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/style/self-care/how-to-stay-safe-in-the-club.html,"Discwoman, a booking agency in Brooklyn, is trying to answer questions that were often overlooked in night life: How do you create safety in parties and night life? And, how can you make everyone feel included in that safety? Although much of electronic dance music, like house and techno, came into being at gay and black clubs in Detroit, Chicago and New York in the 1980s, today a lot of it is enjoyed at predominantly white clubs in Europe or at enormous festivals. And while dance-world night life can be community building and fun, there is also harassment, assault and drugging. There are a few ways to fix that. “By nature all of our events are inclusive, booking women and women of color. We try to make it feel normal rather than a spectacle,” said Frankie Decaiza Hutchinson, a founder of Discwoman. “I’m really into the idea of it not being considered radical. It’s just how it should be. I feel like that’s how our parties should be, too.”  Across the United States and in Europe, there are a number of collectives focused on diversity, inclusion and self-care in the electronic dance space.  Room for Rebellion, a European collective, uses club nights to raise funds for legal and safe abortion in Ireland. Resis’dance, a collective in London, focuses on challenging the male-dominated party scene by gigging, fund-raising and teaching. Here, we learn their tips for self-care and safety on and near the dance floor. If you don’t see yourself reflected, you should understand what to expect. Discwoman said their experience is that rosters with people of color, women and nonbinary people will transform the turnout. “Once you book that way, those communities start to come to those venues anyway, regardless of who’s playing, because they feel like they’re being represented and cared about,” Ms. Hutchinson said. The bottom line is: The crowd is more likely to be diverse when the lineup is representative of different communities. “I see more black women come out when black women play,” Ms. Hutchinson said.  It’s important to work with spaces like clubs or concert locations that support your ideas and intentions, Ms. Hutchinson said. That also includes ensuring attendees feel comfortable no matter what.  “It’s more caring for each other and having an attentiveness and a thoughtfulness in the way you organize events,” said Lenora Thornton, the creative director for Sister, a “decentralized collective” formed in 2015 for female and gender-nonconforming music lovers and creators. For organizers of the event, it is important to have a conversation in advance about safety and the issues that may arise. “Be ruthlessly caring about what you want and need to make your night what it should be,” Anna Cafolla, a Room for Rebellion promoter, wrote in an email. “Get to know the bar staff and security, and flag anything as soon as you see it.” That includes asking venues and staff about how they identify and handle harassment. For instance, staff members should know that gender presentations may not match IDs. “That can be a real issue at the door, so having security that understands those nuances can influence how comfortable people feel when they walk in the door,” Mx. Thornton said. Resis’dance hosts workshops with situation-based examples of harassment and teaches de-escalation techniques. This means following your gut, believing the victim and staying alert. The collective also emphasizes that there are ways of fighting back that aren’t violent. “Our biggest tip is to watch out for your friends and the people around you, always believe and support your friend or the person who reports something,” said Virginia Wilson, co-founder, event operations manager and resident D.J. at Resis’dance. Use your platform to help those who don’t have as many resources as you do. “A white able-bodied man can use his privilege to interrupt and challenge door staff, for example, when someone is obviously being discriminated against,” Mx. Wilson said. “We really expect and encourage people who are more privileged and generally safer on a night out to step up and be on high alert for any discrimination happening around them while partying.” Teaching changes the future. Discwoman holds equipment workshops for D.J.s and those training to be D.J.s. Ms. Burgess-Olsen was a teacher of Akua, a D.J., at the beginning of her career. Now, years later, Akua is on Discwoman’s roster.  “Equipment is always something connected to being a man and using machines,” Ms. Hutchinson said. The workshops are designed to start “cutting through the expectations of what we’re supposed to be doing.” The safe dance movement is built on harm-reduction principles. People in the field understand that festivals, clubs and bars are often accompanied by drugs and alcohol. Not allowing drug use to contribute to death, assault or injury is a goal for venues and promoters that want to make safe spaces. Mx. Thornton of Sister said it is important to recognize the ways in which you can keep people healthy and safe while they’re experimenting. Basic things a venue can do include “providing free water, having earplugs” and having a person in charge of dealing with things, in case “someone has an issue if they feel like they’re in a space where they’re overwhelmed while they’re maybe on psychedelics.”  Sister volunteered with one festival on a psychedelic triage team and teamed up closely with a medical tent to assess people in distress and help determine if they needed emotional or medical care. One technique back when Resis’dance started was to have a “safer spaces crew.” Designated members of the collective would remain sober during an event and would therefore be present to support anybody who experienced violence or illness.  These members go through basic first aid training, arrive early to events and do “rounds” throughout the event, where they travel the space with a watchful eye.  Their “sole duty is the care and careful consideration of the safety of the people at the party,” Mx. Wilson said.  "

5c76c79049f0eacbf105a783,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/27/obituaries/dorothy-masuka-dead.html,"Dorothy Masuka, a vocalist and songwriter who blazed a trail for female pop stars in South Africa and became a dogged advocate of the struggle against apartheid, died on Feb. 23 at her home in Johannesburg. She was 83. The South African jazz journalist Gwen Ansell, who knew Ms. Masuka, said the cause was complications of a stroke that Ms. Masuka suffered last year while touring Europe. Ms. Masuka rose to fame in the mid-1950s, becoming one of the first black female recording artists to achieve stardom across southern and eastern Africa. She performed in a jazz-inflected pop style, singing in native African languages, often about politics. Ms. Masuka wrote prolifically, and many of her songs were covered by other South African stars. Miriam Makeba adapted Ms. Masuka’s “Pata Pata” (originally titled “Ei-Yow”), turning it into her signature song. Tunes like “Kulala” and “Hamba Nontsokolo” were covered by Hugh Masekela, Thandiswa Mazwai and others. “A lot of my songs, they talk,” she told The Mail & Guardian, a South African newspaper, in 2014. “The way of my singing is message. You send a message: It’s love, it’s sadness, it’s everything.” Ms. Masuka’s career took off right as a newly cosmopolitan culture was flourishing among young black South Africans. At the same time, the country’s apartheid regime was tightening its repressive policies. From early in her career, she wrote and recorded songs that squarely addressed the racist policies of the South African government and others across the continent. She sang in support of the nonviolent Defiance Campaign, and she denounced the pro-apartheid politician D. F. Malan in “Dr. Malan.” In 1961 she recorded “Lumumba,” addressing the assassination of the Congolese leader Patrice Lumumba. The South African authorities tried to seize all copies of the record, and Ms. Masuka went into exile for more than 30 years. Throughout the 1960s she worked with pro-independence groups across southern and eastern Africa, including the African National Congress, which at the time was a revolutionary party seeking to overthrow the apartheid regime in Pretoria. For a few years she traveled widely, performing on behalf of independence movements in Zimbabwe, Malawi, Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya. She lived briefly in New York and London, supported by A.N.C. sympathizers, before settling down in Zambia with her children. Ms. Masuka was a flight attendant for 15 years while keeping up her musical career, returning to live in Zimbabwe after it gained independence in 1980. She moved back to Johannesburg in 1992, when apartheid was crumbling. Information on her survivors was not immediately available. Dorothy Masuku was born on Sept. 3, 1935, in Bulawayo, Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). Her name was misspelled “Masuka” on some early records, and the mistake stuck. Her father was a chef who worked for rail companies and hotels, and her mother ran a restaurant. Dorothy got her first taste of performing at her mother’s shop, where she sang songs for pennies in the tsaba-tsaba style, a rhythmic dance music popular in the 1940s. She attended Roman Catholic mission schools, first in her hometown and then, after moving at 12, in Johannesburg. In 1952 she played hooky to go on tour with the African Inkspots, a renowned male vocal ensemble based in Johannesburg. The next year she again ditched school to appear in the Rhodes Centenary Exhibition in Bulawayo, where she won first place in the Miss Bulawayo beauty contest. The win helped persuade her family to support her ambitions as a performer. Her mother signed a contract with Troubadour Records on behalf of Dorothy, who was still a minor. She immediately recorded a handful of songs, including her first hit single, “Hamba Nontsokolo.” An upbeat piece guided by a swinging guitar rhythm, it featured her chirruping voice over a bed of vocal harmonies, reflecting the popular sound of South African vocal groups at the time. The song became Ms. Masuka’s calling card, and Nontsokolo became her nickname. In later years, South Africans tended to refer to her affectionately as “Mam Dorothy.” In the late 1950s she performed often in both South Africa and Southern Rhodesia, becoming a top act in both countries. She was a regular on Johannesburg’s thriving club circuit, and toured with the African Jazz and Variety revue, a pioneering traveling show that featured some of South Africa’s finest black musicians and performing artists. Ms. Masuka’s recording of “Into Yam” — the revue’s closing number, and its only song to come from the black townships — became a dance-hall hit. Ms. Masuka did not make a full-length album until 1987, when she recorded “Ingalo” for the Zimbabwean Starplate label. She followed it with “Pata Pata,” in 1990, for the British label Mango, which reinvigorated her career. She followed that with a few more albums in the 1990s and 2000s, including “Mzilikazi” and “Lendaba,” both for South Africa’s Gallo label. Ms. Masuka was inducted into the Afropop Hall of Fame in New York in 2002, and four years later President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa awarded her the Order of Ikhamanga in Silver, a high national honor bestowed upon artists, writers and other cultural figures. Ms. Masuka continued to perform well into her 80s. In 2017 she shared a bill with the pianist Abdullah Ibrahim at Town Hall in New York, and last year she released her final album, “Nginje.” Today she is considered a national hero in both South Africa and Zimbabwe, though she resisted aligning herself with any single country. “I’m a child of every part of this continent,” she said in a 2015 interview at the Zanzibar International Film Festival, when asked about her history of activism. “I’ve been fighting not for a particular area — I’ve been fighting for South Africa, I’ve been fighting for Zimbabwe, Malawi, Tanzania, Congo and all these places. So I feel I don’t belong to one place.” "
5c41ff043a125f5075c0528d,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/18/arts/music/r-kelly-manager-arrest.html,"A manager for R. Kelly turned himself in to the authorities in Georgia on Friday on charges that he threatened a man who accuses the R&B singer of holding his daughter captive. The manager, Henry James Mason, 52, of Mableton, Ga., was wanted on a warrant for terroristic threats and acts against Timothy Savage, whose daughter Joycelyn is believed to be living with Kelly. Savage told the police that after he tried to contact his daughter, Mason told him over the phone that he would do “harm” to Savage and his family and threatened to kill him. Mason surrendered to the Henry County Sheriff’s Office, near Atlanta, and was released on $10,000 bond on Friday. In a statement released by his lawyer, Mason denied that he had “engaged in any acts of bullying, harassment, or aggressive acts.” He said he had, in fact, tried to help Timothy Savage and his wife, Jonjelyn, re-establish a relationship with their daughter. [Read about RCA’s decision on Friday to drop R. Kelly from its label.] The police report was filed last May, but a storm of controversy has surrounded Kelly in recent weeks, after “Surviving R. Kelly” aired on Lifetime. The documentary series chronicled decades of allegations against Kelly, including that he operates a so-called sex cult in which he physically and emotionally abuses women and keeps them from their families. Timothy and Jonjelyn Savage, who both appeared in the documentary, say that Joycelyn is among those women. But Kelly’s representatives say that the women who live and travel with him are doing so voluntarily, and that he has not abused any of them. Last year, TMZ released a video in which Joycelyn said she was happy living with Kelly and was there of her own volition. “They were perfectly consensual relationships,” Kelly’s lawyer, Steven Greenberg, said last week. Timothy Savage said Mason’s call wasn’t the last time he was warned about speaking out against Kelly. According to the Henry County police, another Kelly associate, Don Russell, sent Savage a text early in the morning on Jan. 3, the day the first episode of “Surviving R. Kelly” aired on Lifetime. Russell sent Savage the text message, at about 5 a.m., saying that “it would be best for him and the family if the documentary does not air,” according to a police report. Savage called the police. While an officer was at the house, Russell called Savage, who put his phone on speaker so the officer could hear. Russell, the officer wrote in his report, accused Savage of giving Lifetime false information and told Savage that if he continued supporting the documentary, “that they (R. Kelly/Don) would be forced to provide information disproving Timothy” and that the information “would ruin him, his reputation, business and family, because it would show him a liar.” The police said on Friday that detectives were reviewing the call. Russell, who has not been charged with a crime, declined to comment about the call on Friday. Gerald A. Griggs, a lawyer who represents Timothy and Jonjelyn Savage, said on Friday that he hoped Mason’s arrest would serve as a “message to Mr. Robert Sylvester Kelly and his camp, that no one will be bullied or threatened, and we will pursue legal action against anyone who attempts to bully or threaten the Savages.” Kelly is not facing criminal charges, but prosecutors in Atlanta and Chicago, where Kelly has had homes, began looking into accusations against him after the documentary aired. Kelly has been dogged for years by accusations but has never been convicted of a crime. He was acquitted in Chicago on child pornography charges in 2008, in a case that involved a tape that prosecutors said showed him having sex with a 13-year-old girl. But the girl in the video did not testify and Kelly’s lawyers argued that her identity could not be proven. He has also settled lawsuits against him going back to the 1990s. Tracy Sampson, a woman who said she was an intern at Epic Records in 1999, told Dateline in an interview to be aired Friday night that Kelly sexually abused her beginning when she was 16. She said she sued Kelly and reached a $250,000 settlement. Mr. Greenberg told Dateline that every woman who had come forward to accuse Kelly of misconduct was lying. The documentary, which followed years of reporting on R. Kelly’s treatment of women, led to calls for RCA, Kelly’s record company, which is a division of Sony Music Entertainment, to drop him. On Friday, RCA did just that. "
5c6484563a125f5075c098db,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/13/fashion/courtney-love-batsheva-fashion-week.html,"A model in a print Batsheva dress appeared at a microphone on a balcony on West Broadway and solemnly declaimed. “I am doll parts,” she said. “Bad skin. Doll heart.” If you knew these words, you really knew them. This was the rallying cry of an angry slice of a generation: one that had blossomed into fury with Hole, who screamed along with its lead singer, Courtney Love, on records like “Live Through This” and at frenetic live shows.  Model after model stepped to the mic and chanted snatches of Hole songs, alternately angry, bruised, fearsome and mocking. Beneath their wigs and braids, a few were recognizable: Christina Ricci, Veronica Webb, Annabelle Dexter-Jones, Theodora Richards. Below, on a couch that was the space’s only seating, sat Ms. Love herself, gazing upward, Instagramming. Batsheva Hay found fame designing what were popularly referred to as prairie dresses, modest little frocks in Laura Ashley fabrics. She has often played up the sweetness inherent in the premise, as she did last season, when she staged a fashion presentation as old diner, with model-waitresses bearing French fries. Now her models were picking up the darker undercurrent and spitting Love-isms — “Hooker-waitress, model-actress / Oh, just go nameless” — as a small battalion of sewing machines whirred below. Ms. Hay has cited Ms. Love and her “Kinderwhore aesthetic” as an inspiration before, part of a lineage that includes Cindy Sherman and other chroniclers of the restless feminine divine. Her look, she wrote in a note after the presentation, “was so of that time but she was also so ahead of her time.”  Ms. Hay’s circle includes friends of Ms. Love’s, like the psychoanalyst Jamieson Webster and the former Hole bassist Melissa Auf der Maur, who produced the music for the show and came up with the idea of having the models read the lyrics.  Eventually, Ms. Hay and Ms. Love ended up direct messaging on Instagram. Despite her much publicized baby-doll dresses, Ms. Love had her Laura Ashley moments, too. “That Laura Ashley green corduroy jumpsuit with yellow flowers?” she said. “I had that in the ’90s. I wore it till the wheels fell off. I wore it traveling so people wouldn’t know it was me. The persona was always ahead. Wearing a ripped dress, whatever. I actually flew with Sheryl Crow to Canada where she was doing Lilith, and I was doing a dark edge fest. I was dressed like a housewife, and she was wearing all leather and Fly Shades.” Ms. Love had an inkling there would be some tribute to her at the show, but she hadn’t anticipated the reading or the final performance of “Miss World” by Esther Rose McGregor, one of Ewan McGregor’s daughters. She was wearing a veil and a wedding dress on which Ms. Hay had invited Ms. Love to scribble whatever she wanted in red Sharpie.  The dress came back with words from Hole’s “Good Sister/ Bad Sister”: “Better watch your back, sister.” In her earlier scribbling days, Ms. Love was sometimes seen with words like “slut” and “witch” written in lipstick on her forearms. “It really moved me,” she said of the performance, though she said she hadn’t known what to do with her hands during it. Being confronted with a specter of one’s younger self is a surrealism most of us won’t know. But the lyrics, Ms. Love said, held up. “Some of them I really, really love,” she said. “Some of them are too out there and commercial, and everyone knows them. The important thing for me, then and now, is it has to look good on the page. I mean, you can love Led Zeppelin and not love their lyrics sort of thing, but I made a big effort in my career to have what’s on the page mean something.” Their sense of righteous female rage hasn’t dated much, a reporter said, in rock or outside of it.  “It certainly hasn’t,” Ms. Love said. On a trip to Scotland with her daughter, Frances Bean Cobain, she bought what she called “little niche rock magazines that are still out”: Mojo, Q, Classic Rock.  “Frances was like, You’re like the granny with her hobby,” she said. “Throwing them, yelling. The only women who were in ’em were Joan and Debbie and maybe some Patti. I was like, what, what? Slash on every page! They’re all cool. But where are the chicks? It’s like it didn’t happen.” “But for Batsheva,” she added, “I thought it was juxtaposed really well.” "
5c3798683a125f5075c03c77,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/10/arts/music/review-dear-erich-opera-jazz-holocaust.html,"The acclaimed jazz pianist and composer Ted Rosenthal was inspired to write the opera “Dear Erich” by a box of letters that sat in his attic for 20 years, untouched. Herta, a grandmother Mr. Rosenthal never met who died in a Nazi concentration camp, wrote the letters to her son, Erich, Mr. Rosenthal’s father, who left Germany in 1938 to attend college in Chicago. Erich did not know what precisely happened to his mother after her letters ended. For years, he was loath to talk about it with his children. In 2015, during a visit to his grandmother’s hometown, Mr. Rosenthal met a scholar who translated Herta’s more than 200 letters and fleshed out her story. This gave Mr. Rosenthal the idea for “Dear Erich,” a jazz opera, as he calls it, which was commissioned by New York City Opera and had its premiere on Wednesday at the Museum of Jewish Heritage in Lower Manhattan. Presented with the National Yiddish Theater Folksbiene (which won raves for its Yiddish production of “Fiddler on the Roof,” soon moving to Stage 42 in Midtown), it’s a simple and fluid production, sensitively directed by Mikhaela Mahony. There are some compelling elements to “Dear Erich,” which has a libretto by Mr. Rosenthal and his wife, Lesley Rosenthal. Though it dramatizes situations and invents details, the opera tells the true, wrenching story of a decent son trying to start a new life in America but anguished over his mother left behind. The two-act work deftly shifts between present-day scenes of the aging Erich; flashbacks to his college days in Chicago; and earlier scenes in Germany, in which the headstrong young man refuses to go into the family scrap metal business, determined to pursue an American education. You care about these characters. And the cast is gifted. But the libretto (which has additional lyrics by Barry Singer, E.M. Lewis and Edward Einhorn) is proliferated with lame rhymes (“I need to go, I need to grow,” young Erich tells his parents) and often wallows in mawkishness. (“The darkness comes before the morning,” Erich’s wife tells him when he’s disconsolate). And the music is frustratingly uneven. In an early scene, when the old, ill Erich drifts in and out of consciousness, having conversations with his dead mother, the wistfully restrained qualities of Mr. Rosenthal’s mellow jazzy score convey regret and fragility. When his grown children try to rouse him, then complain that he has shut them out emotionally, jittery rhythms suggest both their American sassiness and genuine concern. These scenes brought out the best from the 11 skilled players of the orchestra, led by the conductor Adam Glaser. But the score keeps breaking into songs, Mr. Rosenthal’s jazz equivalents of arias, and they are often maudlin. In an interview with JazzTimes, he said that he hopes these numbers will be performed independently. In the opera, they felt inserted and heavy-handed. The scenes that invite real break-out jazz work well: when Erich encounters American city street life; when he heads with his wife, Lili, to a Chicago club; when the jazzy spins during their wedding party segue into traditional Jewish dancing. The impressive singers of this 15-member cast — many taking more than one role — gave their all to the piece. The baritone Peter Kendall Clark brought gravity and earthy sound to Old Erich, while the baritone Brian James Myer was the robust-voiced, conflicted Young Erich. Rachel Zatcoff was a bright, loving Lili. Glenn Seven Allen was winning as Freddy, Erich’s son, who goes to Germany to uncover his grandmother’s story. He brings back a final letter from Herta to Erich that was never sent. In an affecting scene based on that letter, Herta (the radiant soprano Jessica Tyler Wright), explains that she is being sent on a one-way trip, but tells her son that nothing befalling her is his fault — that his life is her gift to him, and his to her. It would have been moving to end the opera with that scene. Instead, the score builds to a final chorus about the power of remembrance, complete with “ah-ah” refrains and soaring Hollywood-melodrama melodies. "
5c35427f3a125f5075c03709,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/08/arts/music/r-kelly-criminal-investigation.html,"Prosecutors in Chicago and Atlanta are seeking information from any potential victims or witnesses after the airing of an investigative documentary about R. Kelly that detailed allegations of more than two decades of sexual and physical abuse by the R&B singer. “Please come forward,” said Kimberly M. Foxx, the state’s attorney for Cook County, Ill., at a news conference in Chicago on Tuesday. “There’s nothing that can be done to investigate these allegations without the cooperation of both victims and witnesses. We cannot seek justice without you.” The district attorney’s office in Fulton County, Ga., began conducting interviews after the broadcast of “Surviving R. Kelly,” a six-part series that aired on Lifetime last week, according to the lawyer for a couple who say the singer is holding their daughter against her will. Gerald A. Griggs, a lawyer for the couple, Timothy and Jonjelyn Savage, said that he was contacted by senior investigators from the district attorney’s office on Monday. A representative for the Fulton County District Attorney’s Office declined to comment. Representatives for R. Kelly also declined to comment, but have said in the past that the women living with Kelly were doing so voluntarily. The district attorney’s contact with the Savages’ lawyer was first reported on Tuesday by TMZ. [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] Griggs said that he provided the investigators with access to the Savages for questioning, along with additional witnesses. The television special included accusations, first reported by Buzzfeed in 2017, that Kelly has been keeping women in a so-called sex cult in recent years. The episodes featured numerous women who described being controlled or abused by the singer, often beginning when they were teenagers. It also featured a series of former associates who said they had assisted Kelly with his sexual arrangements, as well as family members, including the Savages, of women who have lived with Kelly. The Savages say that their daughter, Joycelyn, has been held and mistreated by Kelly, first in an Atlanta residence beginning in 2016, and then in Chicago. She is still believed to be living with him. A woman who lived with Kelly in the past, Asante McGee, described the arrangement in interviews with Buzzfeed and Teen Vogue last year, detailing mental, physical and sexual abuse. She said the women were forced to refer to Kelly as “Daddy” and required his permission to bathe, eat, use the bathroom and move between rooms. A representative for McGee said that she had not been contacted by investigators. Foxx said that, since the broadcast of “Surviving R. Kelly” — which she called “deeply, deeply disturbing” — her office had heard from two families in the Chicago area who were concerned about their loved ones’ contact with Kelly recently. But she did not confirm the existence of any active criminal investigation. Kelly has consistently denied all allegations regarding sexual misconduct and physical abuse against girls and women. In 2008, he was found not guilty of child pornography charges at a trial in Chicago. Representatives for the singer said last year: “All of the women targeted by the current media onslaught are legal adults of sound mind and body, with their own free will. Law enforcement officials in Atlanta and Chicago previously have made ‘wellness’ visits to check on the women in question and have found nothing to cause alarm.” And in a video interview published by TMZ in July, Joycelyn Savage disputed her parents’ assertion that she was being held captive. “I am in a happy place with my life,” she said. “I’m not being brainwashed or anything like that.” Local police have said they visited two homes thought to belong to Kelly in the Johns Creek area outside Atlanta in December 2016. At that point they said, “no further investigation is being conducted at this time.” Foxx said on Tuesday that the Chicago police have visited a Kelly home there in the past. Public interest in the accusations skyrocketed in the last week around the “Surviving R. Kelly” documentary, which was a ratings blockbuster throughout its three-night run. On Tuesday, Oronike Odeleye, a founder of the #MuteRKelly campaign to raise awareness about the accusations against the singer, called reports of the prosecutors’ interest “absolutely great news.” She added in an interview: “It’s unfortunate that it took this to get them to move on it. We had presented them with all the same evidence before.” "
5c3008a03a125f5075c02ef0,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/obituaries/pegi-young-dead.html,"Pegi Young, a late-blossoming folk-rock musician who was a founder of a school for children with severe physical and speech impairments, like her son from her marriage to the singer-songwriter Neil Young, a performer at its many star-studded benefit concerts, died on Tuesday in Mountain View, Calif. She was 66. Her brother Paul Morton said the cause was cancer. By the early 1980s, Ms. Young had grown frustrated with the special education programs available for her son, Ben, who was born with cerebral palsy in 1978. She began thinking about starting a school to better address his needs and those of other children who had largely lost the ability to speak. That inspiration led in 1987 to the Bridge School, an innovative institution in Hillsborough, Calif., that has since achieved global reach. Ms. Young founded it with the speech and language pathologist Marilyn Buzolich and Jim Forderer, who had adopted many special-needs children. At the school, about 17 miles south of San Francisco, children from ages 3 to 12 use augmentative and alternative communication techniques, including speech generators and manual communication boards, to help them articulate their thoughts and prepare to complete their educations in their local school districts. Vicki R. Casella, the executive director, said in a telephone interview that Ms. Young had a “determination to ensure that children like Ben have the opportunity to become active participants in their communities.” Dr. Buzolich added that Ms. Young’s experience as the parent of a child with special needs had been critical to the school. “Professionals often diss parental input, but the parent sees the whole child,” Dr. Buzolich said by telephone. “You can imagine the parents at the Bridge School saying to themselves, ‘She understands me, she knows what it’s like, she’s been there.’ ” The school runs an international teacher training program; implements its curriculum in developing countries; organizes conferences; and conducts research to measure the effectiveness of its educational strategies. “I take a tremendous amount of satisfaction with the knowledge that we’re changing lives for the better,” Ms. Young said in 2017 in an interview with AXS, a ticketing website. “It’s truly having a global impact.” The annual benefit concerts have been the source of much of the school’s funding. Over three decades, headliners have included Mr. Young, Bruce Springsteen, David Bowie, Emmylou Harris, Pearl Jam, the Who, Lucinda Williams and Metallica. The last concert was in 2016. Margaret Mary Morton was born on Dec. 1, 1952, in San Mateo, Calif. Her father, Thomas, was an investment manager. Her mother, Margaret Jean (Foley) Morton, was a homemaker and a hospital auxiliary volunteer. Pegi wrote poetry in high school and played guitar for pleasure, but she did not consider a career in music. She attended community colleges in Northern California but did not graduate. When she met Mr. Young, in 1974, she was working as a waitress near his ranch and living in a tepee with her dog. In his 1992 song “Unknown Legend,”  Mr. Young sang, “She used to work in a diner / Never saw a woman look finer / I used to order just to watch her float across the floor.” They married in 1978. She occasionally sang backup for Mr. Young, most notably at the 1994 Academy Awards telecast, when he sang his Oscar-nominated song, “Philadelphia.” But it was not until she was in her 50s that she recorded her first album, “Pegi Young” (2007). She followed it with four more. The most recent, “Raw” (2017) — credited, like the previous two, to Pegi Young and the Survivors — was in response to her divorce from Mr. Young in 2014. He had begun a relationship with the actress Daryl Hannah, and they married last year. In one song, “Why,” Ms. Young sings: “Why’d you have to ruin my life? Why’d you have to be so mean? Why’d you have to tell me such lies? Why not be straight with me?” After the album’s release, Ms. Young said on NPR that she hoped the songs could help people get through difficult life passages. “It could be, you know, late-in-life divorce,” she said. “It could be death.” She added, “Loss and heartbreak are pretty universal.” In his review of “Raw” in Glide magazine, Lee Zimmerman wrote, “With songwriting assistance from guitarist Kelvin Holly and Spooner Oldham, Young creates a stunning story line, one that taps into feelings that are both bitter and unbridled.” In addition to her son and her brother Paul, Ms. Young is survived by her daughter, Amber Jean Young; her stepson, Zeke Young; two grandchildren; her sisters, Sally Morton and Judith Davidson; two other brothers, Michael and Brian Morton; her stepsister, Mary Ann Wolkomir; and her stepbrother, Kevin Kleczka. Although she had found her way in music, Ms. Young nonetheless viewed the Bridge School as her life’s work. “Three or four of our students now have graduated from college,” she told Speakers in Code, a music website, in 2016, “and I’ve been to every one of their graduations with huge pride of a mother hen for seeing the success that these students have enjoyed — that once they have left Bridge, there is continuum of success.” Ben Young became a successful organic egg farmer. “You know when you buy eggs in a grocery store, and even when you buy them from a good organic source, you notice the yolks are kind of pale?” she said with pride. “Ben’s eggs are nuclear orange.” "
5c38beca3a125f5075c03f1c,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/11/arts/estonia-russia-narva.html,"NARVA, Estonia — The conversion of factories into cultural venues rarely raises eyebrows these days, but the Kreenholm complex here is not just any relic of industry. Once the world’s largest cotton mill and a poster child of Soviet might, it stands on an island in the river that now makes up the European Union’s eastern border. Russia is just a stone’s throw away, leaving Narva — where nearly 90 percent of the population is ethnic Russian — caught between two worlds. Kreenholm’s imposing atmosphere appealed to Jarmo Reha, 27, a theater director from Tallinn, the Estonian capital. He recently commandeered the site for his production “Oomen,” which saluted the ghosts of industry with actors hammering on iron while the Narva Boy’s Choir sang the socialist anthem “The Internationale.” The performance was well received by visiting critics, but some condemned the use of Kreenholm as “blasphemy,” Mr. Reha said in an interview. The factory’s former workers complained that events were being imported from the capital, yet no one was reaching out to the local population. Thousands in the city lost their jobs after the mill was privatized, and it closed for good in 2010. “It’s an open wound,” Mr. Reha said. It’s the kind of tension that Narva is becoming accustomed to as it becomes the latest front in a simmering culture war in the former Soviet bloc. Estonia is lavishing money and attention on Narva to attract investment to the city, fearing that its neglected Russian minority is prone to Kremlin influence. The arts are central to the strategy. Kreenholm hosted the inaugural edition of Station Narva, an alternative music festival, this fall. A cultural program funded by the Ministry of Culture has also been established there, bringing in artists and exhibitions. Vaba Lava Narva, a theater in a former military factory, opened in December. A campaign is underway to make Narva one of the European Union’s capitals of culture in 2024. Helen Sildna, who is leading the campaign, said that there was a “soft power” dimension to the cultural initiatives. “From a defense perspective, building a happy, prosperous community in our border area is crucial,” she said. “But from a human perspective, it’s the decent thing to do anyway.” After years as a Soviet satellite, Estonia, a nation of just 1.3 million people, is anxious to safeguard its language and identity — and that has meant a residual suspicion of its Russian-speaking minority. Narva’s street signs are in Estonian, a language that is related to Finnish and uses a Latin script; many locals, especially older people, don’t speak it. They get their news and entertainment mostly from Kremlin-backed television channels. The radio airwaves are awash with mainstream Russian pop. Until recently, Narva was stigmatized as a hotbed of crime and opioid addiction, closer not only in distance but also in mentality to Russia. The rest of Estonia stayed away. But Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 was “like a bell ringing that woke people in Estonia up,” said Jaanus Mikk, the chief executive of Narva Gate, a property developer renovating Kreenholm. “Politicians started to think about Narva, and it helped the city a lot — more funds and projects came in.” Donbass, Ukraine, is another region with a large ethnic Russian population that is suffering from the collapse of industry. After Crimea’s annexation, pro-Russia demonstrations in Donbass escalated into armed conflict between separatists and the Ukrainian government. Parallels between Donbass and Estonia’s northeast have many in the Baltics worried. Sergei Stepanov, a journalist at ETV Plus, a Russian-language Estonian channel, said that people in Narva mainly watched networks broadcast from across the border that carry what he described as fake news. “People in Narva are influenced by these channels’ constant misinformation about Ukraine,” he said. The Estonian president, Kersti Kaljulaid, said in an interview in November that the people of Narva “watch Russian TV channels and we all know there is no free media in Russia — the news is basically propaganda.” But, she added, “we do not respond by restricting their access or producing anti-propaganda, because the trouble with anti-propaganda is it’s still propaganda.” Instead, funding from Estonia’s government is flowing to events like Station Narva, which brought around 3,000 people to Kreenholm and its surroundings. The headliner was the British post-punk band Echo and the Bunnymen, and the lineup also featured popular acts from Estonia and Russia, including Mart Avi, a rising star of a new “weird wave” of innovative Estonian pop music, and Shortparis, a flamboyant dark electro band from St. Petersburg. Roman Boiko, who runs Art Club Ro-Ro, a bar and music venue in Narva, said that while some welcomed the government’s investment in culture, “people here are still suspicious.” Ro-Ro, a D.I.Y. setup of surrealist artwork and anything-goes carpentry, is the only place in the city to hear more alternative music year-round. “All the attention Narva is getting, and that more people are coming here, feels very good,” Mr. Boiko said. “It’s really important for people here to start believing that there is an interest in them, and even in solutions to their problems.” The funding and support for the arts in Narva also benefit a new generation of Estonian artists who have a more open attitude to collaborating with Russians. The singer Mart Avi, a 27-year-old praised for his startling baritone voice and Bowie-esque stage presence, was among the performers at Station Narva. He said in a recent interview in Tallinn that the festival “was a big thing. It was rather unusual for something like that to happen there.” He said he believed that artists should work together to cut through Estonia’s identity divides. “It’s super easy for me to find a common language with Russians,” he said. “It’s not about territory. If you can find a common area of interest, then all is well.” Mr. Avi said that he did not have the “chip on the shoulder” about Russia that many Estonians who lived through Soviet times have. “I’m saved by the fact that I’m the first generation to be born in free Estonia.” Mr. Reha, the theater director who is also of that generation, said Estonia needed “empathy,” not “tribalism.” “When I was in Narva, I stopped calling the locals Russians. I started calling them ‘our Russians,’ ” he said. “Why should we leave them cut off? They are a part of us.” "
5c65d5423a125f5075c09c69,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/arts/children-culture-winter-activities.html,"Film Forum and Alamo Drafthouse Long before I had children who required a cultural education, I had planned out a film history curriculum. I thought we might begin, my hypothetical children and I, with silent short subjects, maybe Georges Méliès’s “A Trip to the Moon,” and work our way chronologically through cinema history. After a couple of years, we’d move on to talkies, lingering on Max Fleischer cartoons and Laurel and Hardy’s comic two-reelers, arriving at Technicolor just in time for my student-offspring to see “The Wizard of Oz” around age 7 or 8. When my actual children arrived, this plan worked not quite as well as you’d think. The students had been equipped with touch screens, and they had their own syllabus in mind. But we have managed to strike a balance between What I Want My Kids to Like and What They Actually Like, largely with the help of the programmers in charge of series like Film Forum Jr., which offers lovingly curated fare from throughout movie history. Being part of a theatrical audience rather than just lounging on the couch helps kids (and their parents) appreciate these works — albeit with some occasional fidgeting. (This weekend is the 1956 “Carousel”; next weekend is the George Pal-produced “The War of the Worlds.”) At the other end of the spectrum are many of the films that run as part of the Alamo Drafthouse Kids Camp program. Alamo may be as well-known for its strictness — disruptive patrons are ejected without a refund — as for its comforts, like reclining chairs, small tables and waiter service. But Kids Camp offers a far more relaxed atmosphere. (This weekend’s shows include a mix of PBS children’s programs; next week brings matinee screenings of “The Muppets Take Manhattan.”) Other kid- and cinephile-friendly screenings across the city include the Metrograph’s Playtime: Family Matinees and the Nitehawk Cinema’s Lil’ Hawk Friendly series. Students and teachers should check their listings in advance to see what’s on the syllabus. DANIEL McDERMON Ongoing series at various times; filmforum.org and drafthouse.com/family. Brooklyn Academy of Music Are there parents out there who don’t feel guilty and confused when it comes to children and screens? Do we teach them to code while they’re still in training pants or do we keep them from anything flat, shiny and pixelated until they’re 18? Now in its third year, this Brooklyn Academy of Music festival with a dual focus on technology and creativity suggests a digital middle way, screens as a place for discovery and play. Taking over the BAM Fisher building in Downtown Brooklyn, Teknopolis noodles around with motion- and touch-based technologies. (Time-based tickets dictate a 90-minute visit, so be prepared to move and touch fast.) The first two floors, designed for children 6 and up, use a mix of digital and analog machinery, inviting participants to manipulate music, text, ink drawings and photographs. The installation “Más Que la Cara,” by the Brooklyn-based innovators Zach Lieberman and Molmol Kuo, creates a living mask of your child’s face, allowing augmented facial expressions, like an emoji come to life — fun, or creepy? In “Body Sketches,” participants can hand-draw patterns that are repurposed to create virtual costumes. (The best part about virtual costumes: minimal laundering.) In the balcony, TMEMA’s “Manual Input Sessions” let participants use hand gestures, even naughty ones, to create an augmented shadow play. Older kids and adults who think that goggles are a good look can opt to include a virtual-reality experience. “VR-1,” by the Next Wave Festival artist Gilles Jobin, is an immersive dance piece that allows a helmeted you to jump into the body of a hopefully flexible avatar and virtually dance alongside other participants, like a next-level silent disco. “Play Room” allows musicians with a sci-fi streak to invent weird instruments. (Weirder than the fluba?) There’s also “L U N E,” which allows users to build a virtual pillow fort. How is this better than a real pillow fort? This one is made of stars. The BAM Fisher Rooftop hosts several 360° films. One, “Crow: The Legend,” has Oprah Winfrey in her V.R. debut. Another, “Man on Spire,” a collaboration with The New York Times and Koncept VR, follows the professional climber Jimmy Chin up the spine of 1 World Trade Center. The Times also created “A Classic Circus Folds Its Tent,” a tribute to the final Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey show. There’s an augmented-reality arcade where ticket holders can try out various apps, like Flarmingos, which adds boxy, pinkalicious flamingos to everyday surroundings, a reality augmentation I would happily support. Also helpful: There’s a Whole Foods 365 a few blocks away, as most children will still prefer their postfestival snacks nonvirtual. ALEXIS SOLOSKI Feb. 23-March 10 at BAM Fisher, 321 Ashland Place, Brooklyn; bam.org. Various Locations A Kenyan girl obsessed with superheroes. South American children trying to save their Indigenous culture. Young people questioning their gender identities. As the movie industry continues to be criticized for a lack of diversity, the selections of the New York International Children’s Film Festival stand out as surprising exceptions. A cinematic celebration for kids that is about as far away from a kiddie event as you can imagine, it arrives next weekend with 15 features, 75 short films, two virtual-reality experiences, an animators’ panel, discussions with directors and a determination to show the world in all its fascinating multiplicity. “We can’t ever underestimate the importance of kids seeing people that look like them — onscreen and as filmmakers,” said Maria-Christina Villaseñor, the festival’s programming director. Showing films for ages 3 through 18 at seven sites over four weekends, the festival will open Friday, Feb. 22, with “The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind,” the first film written and directed by Chiwetel Ejiofor, the Oscar-nominated star of “12 Years a Slave.” The movie, from Malawi and Britain, relates the true story of a 13-year-old who devised a windmill for his famine-plagued village. (Ejiofor plays his father.) The festival will also offer the Kenyan and German project “Supa Modo” and interviews with its director, Likarion Wainaina. This fictional film features a 9-year-old Kenyan girl whose terminal illness does not quash her desire to fight and fly like a superhero. Both films raise sobering issues, and Ejiofor did not even conceive of his debut picture as a children’s film. But the festival does not focus so much on work made for the young as on work that will engage them. Even the animation sometimes embraces serious themes. In Juan Antin’s “Pachamama,” set centuries ago in the Andes, a boy and a girl struggle to recover a stolen icon. (Antin will also take part in an audience talkback.) And Kitaro Kosaka’s ghost story, “Okko’s Inn,” chronicles the life of a recently orphaned girl who copes with grief through hard work.  Featuring strong female protagonists is a priority for the festival, in which about half the filmmakers this year are women. They include Linda Hamback of Sweden, whose animated “Gordon & Paddy” has a female rodent detective, and Joya Thome of Germany, who will appear at the festival and whose “Queen of Niendorf” presents a girl who defines courage differently than her male peers do. This year’s festival also spotlights films from the Netherlands; Steven Wouterlood will discuss his feature “My Extraordinary Summer With Tess,” an exploration of family and friendship. The festival’s short films, which are judged by an adult jury (winners become eligible for Oscars), also examine sex stereotyping. A shorts program about re-evaluating masculinity, “Boys Beyond Boundaries,” which was new last year, has returned with films like Christina Willings’s Canadian documentary “Beauty,” featuring five children whose self-definitions don’t match their birth certificates. “There’s a real demand for sophisticated media for kids,” said Nina Guralnick, the festival’s executive director. “Now more than ever.” LAUREL GRAEBER Feb. 22-March 17 at various locations; nyicff.org. New York Philharmonic Of course the New York Philharmonic’s mascot is a penguin. What other animal comes to mind when you look at a symphony orchestra in full concert dress? You won’t find that kind of attire here, though — not at the Very Young People’s Concerts, which are also Very Informal, and Very Friendly. Which is where Philippe the Penguin comes in. Some New York parents — the kind who get their preschool application in before the third trimester of pregnancy — are already snapping up their subscriptions to the next season of the Philharmonic’s children’s programs. But for anyone keen to dip just one experimental toe into the classical waters, the coming week is a good time to see Tchaikovsky and Beethoven broken down into spoonable chunks. In a first step, the Philharmonic breaks down the target audience itself. Its Very Young People’s Concerts at Merkin Hall are specifically for 3- to 6-year-olds. These interactive events are based on the understanding that, at this age, a child craves nothing more than to be in control, which is why little audience members get to mess with the music almost from the moment they enter the building. A quartet performing in the lobby might let kids determine their tempo or volume. (Be prepared for demands that a stroller be pushed a little more allegro on the way home.) Other stations let children get their hands on real instruments, or ask nosy questions of a harpist armed with angelic patience. The actual performance on this occasion, Feb. 24 and 25, features selections from Tchaikovsky’s “Swan Lake,” with storytelling and video — and the ever-relatable Philippe the Penguin — keeping little minds focused. The following weekend’s program targets children ages 6 to 12 with a Young People’s Concert on March 2 titled “Level Up — Beethoven, Andrew Norman and Video Games.” Here, too, there is an interactive component before the performance proper that allows visitors to think like composers and come up with a musical bridge between existing passage of music. But the focus of the performance in David Geffen Hall is a more rigorous introduction to the notion of development in music. Using the iconic opening movement of Beethoven’s Fifth as a case study, development here is related in terms of the choices and story lines opening up inside a video game. The brilliant, boyish composer Andrew Norman talks about Beethoven and his own award-winning “Play,” part of which will be performed by the Philharmonic. A work by a Very Young Composer, Kyler Simon, is also part of the concert. Its title? “The Great Adventure.” CORINNA da FONSECA-WOLLHEIM Feb. 24-25 at Merkin Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, and March 2 at David Geffen Hall, Lincoln Center, at Broadway and West 65th Street, Manhattan; 212-875-5656, nyphil.org. “Adventure Time” (streaming on Hulu).

5c6173623a125f5075c0911e,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/11/style/cardi-b-grammys-fashion-review.html,"It’s possible that the most out-there moment of fashion week took place Sunday night thousands of miles away from the New York catwalks — sorry, red carpet — at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. I am speaking, of course, of Cardi B’s Grammys entrance as Venus emerging from her clam in vintage Thierry Mugler (circa 1995), her top half covered in a nude body suit and molded bustier, her bottom half in black velvet that exploded into a pink satin abalone frame around her pearl-encrusted waist. It was a little absurd and a little unwalkable and deep in the realm of costume. (She later changed into another vintage Mugler, an off-the-shoulder white gown with floor-length fringe, the better to make it to the stage to accept her Grammy for best rap album.) But as an image of female potency and coming into one’s own, it was impossible to miss. Sometimes, you’ve just got to get out of your shell. Along with Janelle Monáe’s flying buttress Jean-Paul Gaultier minidress and flying square hat, it was a reminder that red carpet fashion is at its most arresting when it is about statement-making of the very personal kind — when clothing on the red carpet was unabashedly performative instead of protective. Halfway through a fashion week in New York that, Telfar aside, has been notably sedate, and now that the film world seems to have effectively traded self-actualization for the economic security of brand marketing, it’s worth remembering. Even if Lady Gaga, the former dress provocateur, seems to have blandified herself into haute Oscar acceptability. Was it only 2011 when she made her Grammys entrance in a translucent egg? She has gone from there to understated Saint Laurent column in eight years.  It’s a journey, of a sort — and one that is presumably her choice, which is the point. If she now wants to define herself in silver screen terms instead of meat dresses, that’s her prerogative. Though the jewel-encrusted unitard she wore to sing “Shallow,” which hinted at some of the looks of yesteryear, made me miss the more jaw-dropping moments. Still, if there was any real takeaway from the Grammys fashion, it was the range of styles on display on a night that finally put women front and center. Aside from Post Malone in his pink suit covered in rhinestone stars and Leon Bridges in his custom-made mustard Bode covered in personal totems, the men, who have been peacocking their way through the Hollywood awards season, were relatively restrained. (See: Drake in his black Tom Ford turtleneck and cashmere overcoat. See also: Donald Glover, who won a Grammy but didn’t even show up.) The women, however, did their own thing. Sisters, dressing the way they want to dress. You could see it from the start, when Michelle Obama (Michelle Obama!) took to the stage in a hammered silver sequin Sachin & Babi wrap jacket and trousers — part armor, part lounge suit — continuing her post-White House/book tour-wardrobe breakout. She joined the host Alicia Keys, who did relative understatement (sure she changed clothes multiple times, but she also had a barefoot moment) in red and then teal green and then black; Gaga in her silver; Jada Pinkett Smith, who did old-time glamour in feathered Roberto Cavalli; and J. Lo, who did mystery in a giant white hat — all to celebrate the power of music. And you could see it in Dolly Parton, who did herself in ruffly red and then body-hugging white lace and sparkles to perform. In Diana Ross, who did full-on diva in the stage-swallowing biggest dress of the night (she’s earned it). In Katy Perry, who did bulbous ruffles in pink Balmain (there was a lot of pink), which both made her look a bit like a hedge and was kind of toned down (for her). In Miley Cyrus and her tux (Mugler) and the yellow floral trouser suit she wore to perform with Dolly (Valentino couture). In the Coach jumpsuit with more than 25 kinds of crystals and paillettes that H.E.R. wore on the red carpet. Like them or not, they spoke to the fact that music may be the last refuge of the fashion risk-taker. It’s one of the few celebrity-adjacent industries that has managed not to get indebted to the “ambassador of XX house” machine; where clothes still serve at the pleasure of the celebrity, as opposed to the other way around. That is, after all, how they should serve us all.  "
5c2d2d623a125f5075c0295a,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/02/movies/bohemian-rhapsody-a-star-is-born.html,"I was waiting for a subway last month in Mexico City when I figured out what’s wrong with the Queen movie. I mean, I knew what was wrong. “Bohemian Rhapsody” is scared of tapping into the imagination that made the band so innovative and powerfully, addictively strange. But that’s not what hit me waiting for the subway. The platform entertainment system was playing a concert video of “Another One Bites the Dust.” I don’t know what year the clip was from or what city Queen was in. I just know that the lighting is warm, the groove is skintight (you could feel it on the platform), and that Freddie Mercury is wearing — is packed into — white short-shorts and almost nothing else. No shoes, no shirt yet all service. The towel he’s whipping around gets an almost immediate, theatrical toss into the crowd. The red wristband and red bandanna tied round his neck bring out the red in his Montreal Canadiens trucker’s cap. Mercury does all his Mercurial moves — the side gallop, the chug-a-lug, the duck strut, the steed swipe, the rewind, the vroom-vroom, the Wimbledon Final frozen pirouette, the one where he kind of dries his tushy with the microphone stand in a full march. And he does them while belting out this uppercut of a song (with some shockingly forceful assistance from the drummer Roger Taylor). Commuters, tourists, kids: we looked up at this thing, mesmerized, in jeopardy of missing a train. That’s right about when I figured out what was wrong with the Queen movie: There’s nothing in it remotely like this. “Bohemian Rhapsody” plods, explains, obscures, speculates and flattens. It does not mesmerize. I mean, I wouldn’t miss a train for this. We learn how “We Will Rock You” allegedly sprang from a fit of personal protestation. But it’s news we can’t use. The movie won’t stop telling us things — about the music business and the songs, about Mercury’s tortured sex life. And it fails to show you anything close to what that clip on the subway platforms makes you feel: sweaty. The musical biography has an impossibly high degree of alchemical difficulty. One performer has to become a totally different performer, and not any performer, just this one star the whole world knows, and it has to be done in a way that makes you believe you’re seeing either the impersonated star or something quintessential about them. Val Kilmer made you believe you were seeing something vitally true about Jim Morrison. Joaquin Phoenix did the same with Johnny Cash. And Jamie Foxx became Ray Charles. Angela Bassett convinced you that if you were seeing if not Tina Turner, then Turner’s indestructibility; and Marion Cotillard, the brittle incandescence of Edith Piaf. For my money, one of the triumphs of this type of acting is Chadwick Boseman’s James Brown in “Get On Up.” Boseman pumps Brown full of edginess and spite while having to reconstruct Brown as a stage specimen, and part of that reconstruction involves learning to lip sync to Brown. You sense that you’re watching an actor who’s done more than homework. He’s written himself a little dissertation. It’s not an impression of Brown. It’s an interpolation. Some movies pivot and omit the musical performance altogether. That’s the approach Todd Haynes applied to Bob Dylan in “I’m Not There” and John Ridley took in having Andre 3000 play Jimi Hendrix in “Jimi: All Is by My Side.” But the alchemy is a reason to dislike the genre. It’s hard to get the proportions right. It takes some work in, say, “Cadillac Records” to figure out where Beyoncé ends and Etta James is supposed to begin. Rami Malek has a different challenge in “Bohemian Rhapsody.” He’s not a superstar playing another superstar. He just has to become the superstar Freddie Mercury was. Just. And yet because the movie is mostly scenes of recording sessions, squabbling and self-pity, Mercury’s stardom is made beside the point — it’s assumed — so Malek gets to play a charismatic sufferer, -quipster and, eventually, proud brown gay man. It’s just that this version of Mercury isn’t terribly exciting without the reward of seeing him vroom-vroom in short-shorts. The movie rides the roller coaster of biographical cliché. What’s missing are musical numbers that showcase his showmanship and eternal capacity for self-delight. This means more time watching Malek struggle with dental effects meant to bring his mouth into more realistic alignment with Mercury’s. Maybe Malek has done the best anyone could with the teeth. But they wind up bringing something vampiric out of Mercury that I don’t know was ever there. Either way, the alchemy is off.  WE’RE IN A HAPPY MOMENT for musical-movie excitement. “Mary Poppins” has returned with new songs. And despite that lie of a title, “The Greatest Showman” is the most impressive phenomenon nobody saw coming or took seriously once it came. “Bohemian Rhapsody” is now the musical biopic’s biggest hit. We can have the argument later about the difference between a classical movie musical and a movie where people get on stage and do music, but you could also add to the mix this latest incarnation of “A Star Is Born,” which was a smash too. It’s the story of how a waitress became a Grammy winner. And because the tale is essentially a fantasy — of love, fame and ruin; biography as mythology — its casting is the inverse of the rock bio. A musician does the acting. In Bradley Cooper’s version, the musician is Lady Gaga. She starts off as Ally the restaurant grunt. But when Cooper’s beloved alt-country pill guzzler sees her belt “La Vie en Rose” in a drag parlor, he hauls her into stardom, which Gaga knows well. But the surprise of her acting comes in the first hour when the movie is closer to earth and requires her to be more like you and me — daughter, employee, listener. There’s a lovely hesitance to her here, not in the camera-shy way singers tend to get when it’s time to act. Reluctance is a performance strategy for her in this movie. Again, she’s like you and me, she can’t believe Bradley Cooper’s happening to her, either. Some of what’s great about the first hour is how it gets you thinking about the kind of career Gaga could have in movies they haven’t made in, like, 30 years. The scenes at home with Ally, her chauffeur father and his fellow drivers are loud, funny and warm in a way that reminded me of “Moonstruck.” And some of the pleasure I had watching Gaga in them is how she reminded me of another singer who acts: Cher. A friend points out that she could have Cher’s career if the movies were still interested in normal people. I, at least, would love to see Gaga in a “Mask” or a “Suspect.” She and Malek are both near the top of the heap for Oscar nominations. And she’s got an alchemical advantage over Malek’s Freddie Mercury. When Ally’s career takes off, Gaga winds up playing a pop star not unlike herself. And you realize she has the opposite problem that Malek does. You’re less interested in her as a singer — but only because we’ve seen her do huge, stadium-size razzle-dazzle before. And yet she’s indifferent to playing the fame stuff. It doesn’t seem to interest Ally or Gaga. If the movie loses Ally a bit in the second half, Gaga never appears lost. She’s giving a serious, considered, committed performance of a person she seems to know. Malek’s commitment is to a movie committed in the wrong proportions. It doesn’t know who it wants Freddie Mercury to be. “Bohemian Rhapsody” doesn’t fixate on the showmanship until the finale, which restages their electric, legendary Live-Aid performance at Wembly Stadium and passes for showstopping. Yet you exit hungry for a movie that gets closer to the bottom of a man who renamed himself after both an element and a planet. If someone dares take another crack (and someone really should), I know the perfect Freddie. Her first name is Lady. And her last name comes straight from a Queen song. "
5c2fd22b3a125f5075c02e89,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/obituaries/honey-lantree-dead.html,"Anne Lantree’s life changed after a chance encounter with a drum kit in 1963. She was working in a hair salon in London owned by her friend Martin Murray. Mr. Murray moonlighted as the rhythm guitarist in an amateur rock ’n’ roll band called the Sheratons, whose drummer had recently quit. His drum kit was still set up at the group’s rehearsal space, and Ms. Lantree, who was there for a guitar lesson, asked if she could try it. Mr. Murray acquiesced, he said in an interview on Thursday, “not giving any thought that she would jump on these drums and play like she had her whole life.” “She was just a born, natural drummer; she hadn’t played before and just went for it,” Mr. Murray continued. “I was aghast, staring at her, and said, ‘All right, you’re our new drummer.’ ” Ms. Lantree’s impromptu solo was the start of a whirlwind career as one of the few women to play drums in a 1960s rock group. The Sheratons soon became the Honeycombs, with Ms. Lantree billed as Honey, and released “Have I the Right?,” a bouncy love song that reached No. 1 on the British pop charts and No. 5 in the United States. Ms. Lantree died on Dec. 23 at her home in Great Bardfield, Essex, England. She was 75. Her son Matthew Coxall said the cause was breast cancer. Female drummers are rare in rock music, and were even rarer in the 1960s. That did not stop Ms. Lantree, who soon began performing with the band. The group, which also featured Dennis D’Ell as lead singer, Allan Ward on lead guitar and John Lantree, her brother, on bass, performed nightly at a local pub that quickly became swamped with admirers. At one show the band met Alan Blaikley and Ken Howard, two aspiring songwriters, and they offered the group “Have I the Right?” (the title is sometimes rendered without the question mark) and many of the other songs that would make up its first album. The band used its new material to audition for the record producer Joe Meek, who immediately saw their potential. They recorded “Have I the Right?” in Mr. Meek’s studio. Featuring twanging guitars and thumping drums augmented by stomping feet, the song was released as a single by Pye Records, whose managing director suggested that Ms. Lantree go by Honey and that the group become the Honeycombs. The Honeycombs appeared on television and released their first album, called simply “The Honeycombs,” in 1964. Some journalists accused the group of using Ms. Lantree, who dressed stylishly and sported a beehive hairdo, as a gimmick. Some even questioned whether she had actually played the drums on “Have I the Right?” “We couldn’t do nothing about it,” Mr. Murray said, “just deny it, which is the truth.” In late 1964, Peter Pye replaced Mr. Murray, and in 1965 the Honeycombs set off on a tour of Scandinavia, Australia and parts of Asia. That same year the group reached No. 12 on the British pop charts with “That’s the Way,” in which Ms. Lantree sang with Mr. D’Ell, and released a second album, “All Systems Go!” But the Honeycombs’ greatest success was already behind them, and the band broke up in 1967. “It was very traumatic,” Ms. Lantree told an Australian newspaper in 1991. “I was still living at home with my parents, and I went back to hairdressing. People still recognized me, and it was hard to get on with a new life.” Anne Margot Lantree was born on Aug. 28, 1943, in Hayes, Middlesex, England, to John and Nora (Gould) Lantree. Her father owned a sign-making business, and her mother was a homemaker. The family moved to Highams Park, in Northeast London, and Ms. Lantree attended high school there before she started working in Mr. Murray’s salon. Ms. Lantree married David Coxall, a pensions administrator, in 1969. He died in 2018. In addition to her son Matthew, she is survived by another son, Simon; a brother, John; and five grandchildren. Ms. Lantree’s time at the top of the charts was fleeting, but she was not finished with music. Beginning in the 1980s she played with different versions of the Honeycombs. She stopped only when Mr. D’Ell died in 2005. "
5c8bc9df49f0eacbf105d4a6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/15/movies/sxsw-film-festival.html,"AUSTIN, Tex. — Surprises abounded at this year’s South by Southwest film festival, with movies featuring depraved demons, devilish doppelgängers and sadistic senseis all doing despicable things. And yet, one of the most gasp-worthy moments was hearing the tween actor Jacob Tremblay use the F-word in the first five minutes of “Good Boys.” It wouldn’t be the only time in this comedy about a wild day in the life of a few sixth-graders, and it was one of several breakout titles worth knowing about as the film portion of the festival comes to a close on Saturday. “If I’m being honest, I am shocked and appalled,” Tremblay joked during the post-screening Q.& A., and added referring to his director Gene Stupnitsky, “Gene told me this was going to be a PG-rated family movie. He lied.” The movie was right at home at a festival that has turned into something of a testing ground for the hit potential of Hollywood comedies. The audience applauded the comic timing of Tremblay and his co-stars, Brady Noon and the scene-stealing Keith L. Williams, and that positive reaction along with a recently released red-band trailer featuring one of the movie’s producers, Seth Rogen, has fueled social-media interest. “Good Boys” opens nationwide in August. Another talker was Olivia Wilde’s directing debut, “Booksmart.” Much like “Good Boys,” it follows students on a wild day, but this one is female-focused. Beanie Feldstein and Kaitlyn Dever star as high school seniors who, on the last day of school, realize they may have studied too hard and partied too softly. They make up for that in one outrageous evening that includes drugged strawberries and a raucous graduation bash. The packed house at the Paramount theater especially appreciated the killer soundtrack and a high laugh-per-minute ratio. Also winning over festivalgoers was “Long Shot,” a rom-com starring Rogen and Charlize Theron. The crowd was drawn to the combination of smart and slapstick humor, and was also roused by a Boyz II Men cameo. Then, after the screening, could it really happen? Or do dreams just fade away? The pop group did a little East Coast swing in a surprise performance. The laughs had a mellower edge at the premiere of the Harmony Korine comedy “The Beach Bum,” starring Matthew McConaughey as Moondog, the pothead writer he may have been born to play. The crowd basked in the movie’s hazy glow, and McConaughey was a great sport, attending the after-party dressed in character. Critical reaction to the film was a little more mixed. Variety wrote, “The question here isn’t if McConaughey is having fun, but whether audiences will find his laid-back, ever-lit persona nearly as entertaining to watch.” And The Hollywood Reporter said that the film was “high on style, if not substance.” Humor was also a thread through some of the festival’s darker films, including Jordan Peele’s “Us,” which opened SXSW and featured a measured number of laugh- and shriek-worthy sequences. Similarly, audiences winced and laughed during “The Art of Self-Defense,” starring Jesse Eisenberg in a deadpan role as an accountant who is brutally attacked by masked assailants. Taking classes at a dojo, he meets a sensei (Alessandro Nivola) with a tainted worldview. The comedy is pitch-black, but the crowd appreciated its sinister quirks. Other funny journeys down twisted roads included “Porno,” a 1992-set film about conservative Christian teenagers working in a small-town movie theater. After discovering an old film hidden in the walls, they inadvertently unleash a sex demon that wreaks havoc. Keola Racela’s debut feature, with more than one instance of genital mutilation played for laughs, made festivalgoers squirm but got them talking as well. “Villains,” directed by Dan Berk and Robert Olsen, put a fun twist on the home-invasion genre, with Bill Skarsgard and Maika Monroe as criminals on the lam. When their car runs out of gas, they pick the wrong home to break into, that of a couple (Jeffrey Donovan and Kyra Sedgwick) with a few skeletons in their closet and another secret in their basement. And in keeping with the Boys/Boyz festival motif, there was “Boyz in the Wood,” a hallucinogenic comedy-survival tale from the music video director Ninian Doff about teenagers in the Scottish Highlands who become more hunted than hunters. The site Film School Rejects described it as “‘Hot Fuzz’ meets ‘Attack the Block.’” The movie was the subject of so much chatter that SXSW added an extra screening. The festival wasn’t entirely lighthearted. Its two major jury awards went to much more serious-minded films. “Alice,” Josephine Mackerras’s drama about a woman (Emilie Piponnier) who becomes a prostitute to support her child, won the narrative feature prize. And “For Sama,” which focuses on a young female Syrian filmmaker, Waad al-Kateab, who cataloged harrowing aspects of her life in Aleppo for five years, took the documentary feature award. But the festival’s biggest and funniest standouts show its programming strengths, and reinforce the value of the theatrical experience, the opportunity to laugh, and sometimes cringe, with a large, responsive audience.

5c7417573a125f5075c0b6d8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/25/arts/music/r-kelly-plea-not-guilty.html,"The R&B singer R. Kelly was released from a Chicago jail Monday, three days after he surrendered to face 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse. Mr. Kelly’s bond had been set at $1 million. According to Cook County jail records, a woman who described herself as a friend from the Chicago area paid $100,000, the standard 10 percent bail fee, to secure his release. Mr. Kelly walked through the jail gates around 5:30 p.m. local time, then moved slowly through a scrum of waiting reporters as a fan nearby yelled “Free R. Kelly!” He was driven away in a black Mercedes van, trailed by a news helicopter. Earlier on Monday, Mr. Kelly appeared in Cook County criminal court in an orange prison jumpsuit with “DOC” printed on the back, and pleaded not guilty to the charges. His lawyer, Steven Greenberg, asked the judge whether his client would have to settle child support payments he owes to post bond, or if the $100,000 would suffice. Judge Lawrence E. Flood said Mr. Kelly only needed $100,000. Prosecutors in Chicago say they have identified four victims, including one teenage autograph seeker whom they say Mr. Kelly had sex with for months beginning when she was 16 years old. Another was a girl he met at a restaurant, at her 16th birthday celebration. A third was a 24-year-old hairdresser of his, who told prosecutors that Mr. Kelly tried to force her to perform oral sex on him. Court documents said she reported that incident to law enforcement officials within two years of when it occurred and handed over a shirt she was wearing that day, which DNA analysis showed had his semen on it. It was not clear why Mr. Kelly was not charged in connection with this at the time. Mr. Greenberg has said it may have been a consensual encounter. [Read more about the case here.] For years, Mr. Kelly, whose real name is Robert Kelly, seemed largely immune to accusations that he sexually abused minors and kept women in a cultlike environment, shielded by a series of nondisclosure agreements. But his behavior came under renewed scrutiny in January after the documentary “Surviving R. Kelly,” which chronicled the allegations against him, aired on Lifetime. He was arrested in 2002 on child pornography charges stemming from a tape that prosecutors said showed him having sex with and urinating on an underage girl. But in 2008, he was acquitted on all counts after the girl prosecutors said was in the tape refused to testify. That same girl is now the fourth victim cited by prosecutors. They also have said that they have a different tape of Mr. Kelly and the girl having sex, and Michael Avenatti, the celebrity lawyer who gave the video to law enforcement, has said that it is a recording of a different incident than the earlier tape, which removes any concern about double jeopardy. Mr. Avenatti said on Monday that he had obtained a second video of Mr. Kelly that showed him having sex with an underage girl. He said he gave the 55-minute-long tape to prosecutors, and that the girl in the video was one of the victims Mr. Kelly had already been charged with abusing. In this tape, he said, Mr. Kelly “refers to the victim having a 14-year-old body part, a vagina.” Mr. Kelly’s next court date will be March 22. "

His death came amid widespread concern about crime in Puerto Rico; on Wednesday, the top F.B.I. official there said the island was facing “a crisis of violence.” In an article published in April, Paper Magazine called Mr. Fret “Latin trap’s first openly gay pioneer.” That month, he released a single titled “Soy Así,” or “I’m Like This.” The “Soy Así” video, which has been viewed over 500,000 times on YouTube, opens with Mr. Fret wearing a glittery crop top and matching skintight pants, holding a (presumably fake) rifle. Surrounded by women in skimpy outfits, he boasts about his looks, makeup and designer gear, and calls himself “the reincarnation of Frida Kahlo.” “I’m a person that doesn’t care what anybody has to say,” he told the magazine. “Young gay guys or young lesbians that are looking at me now like a role model, like wow, if he did it, and he don’t care what anybody else has to say, I can do it.” Latin trap originated in the Caribbean in the mid-2000s, mixing Southern hip-hop with local sounds. Bad Bunny, Messiah and Ozuna — all of whom have worked with Cardi B — are among its best-known practitioners. In a statement to Billboard, Mr. Fret’s manager, Mr. Rodriguez, said his client was “an artistic soul, a big-hearted dreamer.” “His passion was music,” he added, “and still had a lot to do.” In July, Mr. Fret appeared in a video by the artist Mike Duran, for a song called “Diferente.” There were familiar tropes — money, bikinis — but Mr. Fret’s appearance, rapping in a rainbow mesh T-shirt in a hot tub, and later in a crisp white shirt with a glitter crown and impossibly long eyelashes — was, in fact, very different. Samy Nemir Olivares, a Puerto Rican writer and activist who lives in New York, said Mr. Fret represented hope for people like himself, who had faced bullying and harassment for their sexual orientation. “Kevin Fret represented a refreshing view in a music genre that is very homophobic and very machista,” he said. Mr. Fret used the braggadocio and performativity of the genre to make the case for inclusivity, Mr. Nemir Olivares argued. “In Puerto Rico, that’s an act of resistance,” he added. But it did not always go smoothly. Mr. Fret had responded forcefully after he was the target of homophobic threats in the lyrics of a rival artist, which left some questioning whether his killing had been motivated by hate. The police were searching for another man on a motorcycle who was with Mr. Fret when he was found, but quickly fled. There was no indication of the motive so far. Mr. Fret had also lived in Miami in recent months. In June, he was charged with battery after a fight in the Brickell neighborhood. Mr. Fret said he had been attacked because of his sexuality. He had a large following on Instagram, but no posts were visible on Thursday, indicating that he may have deleted previous posts. There was just one “story”: a religious saying that translates to “Pray, relax and let God do the rest.” "
5c87d23149f0eacbf105ca2e,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/12/world/asia/seungri-prostitution-south-korea.html,"HONG KONG — A leading K-pop singer has been formally named as a suspect in an investigation into accusations of prostitution and sexual misconduct at nightclubs in South Korea. The police in Seoul, South Korea, said that the singer, Lee Seung-hyun, 28, who performs under the name Seungri and is a member of the boy band Big Bang, was suspected of “offering sexual services” in 2015. Local news reports, citing what they said were leaked posts from a messaging app, said Mr. Lee was accused of arranging for investors to receive sexual favors at a nightclub called Arena. Mr. Lee has denied the accusations against him, but said that he would nonetheless retire from the entertainment scene to protect the reputation of his band and of the talent agency that manages it, YG Entertainment. “I will take the investigation seriously to clear all the allegations,” he wrote in an Instagram post on Monday. Mr. Lee is not in custody, and YG Entertainment said he would begin his mandatory military service on March 25. The police said they had made arrangements for the investigation to continue after he enlisted. The investigation appears to have begun after video circulated online that was said to have shown a man being assaulted by employees at another nightclub, Burning Sun, which Mr. Lee has promoted. According to local media reports, the man said he was trying to defend a woman who had been molested at the club. Lee Moon-ho, the head of Burning Sun, was questioned by the police for 10 hours, according to local news reports. In a statement he posted to Instagram before deleting his personal account, he said that many unfounded rumors were circulating about misconduct at the club — he cited claims of police collusion, drugging and sexual assault of women, and drug sales — but that the alleged assault on the man was the only confirmed episode. “On the cases related to Burning Sun that I did not know about, I will actively participate in the investigations to ensure that the truth is quickly uncovered and I am making efforts to prevent these issues from arising again,” he wrote. Prostitution is illegal in South Korea, but businessmen are thought to sometimes arrange illicit sexual encounters in exchange for deals. As Seungri, Lee Seung-hyun has an outsize presence in Seoul’s night life and music scene, and also has his own chain of ramen restaurants. He has cultivated an image evoking F. Scott Fitzgerald’s Jay Gatsby, with a solo tour and album under the title “The Great Seungri.” Representatives from Arena declined to comment. Spokesmen for Burning Sun could not be reached for further comment; a representative was quoted in the South Korean daily Kyunghyang Shinmun as saying that Seungri was part of its management, but not its owner. The chief executive of YG Entertainment said in a statement that Seungri was no longer executive director at the club, and that he would be resigning from his business roles before he enlisted in the military. The accusations have rocked fans from South Korea and abroad. Some defended the star and lamented his downfall, while more than 200,000 others signed a petition calling for the police to punish him, and to act on other allegations of corruption and drug crimes against women at adult entertainment venues. “We demand self-reflection among male celebrities who are the perpetrators and abettors of rape culture; who saw women as sexual tools rather than human beings to be respected, actively participated in crime or condoned, assisted or enjoyed it,” Digital Sexual Crime Out, a feminist activist group, said in a statement. “We also demand self-reflection among men who related to these male celebrities and consumed the case as simple gossip.” "
5c5418dd3a125f5075c07833,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/01/arts/music/robert-ashley-improvement-kitchen.html,"For opera singers, playing a part originally created by another artist is as common as breathing. But vocalists who specialize in contemporary works face a different challenge: inhabiting a character whose first appearance, played by another (often still living) singer, has been documented in audio or video. When you can see and hear a role’s originator at work, presumably with the composer’s blessing, how free are you to make that role your own? Gelsey Bell, a charismatic and fiercely intelligent performer whose résumé extends from guerrilla street theater to Broadway, has created her share of roles, not least the modest, pious Mary Bolkonskaya in “Natasha, Pierre & the Great Comet of 1812.” Now she will appear in a revival of Robert Ashley’s “Improvement (Don Leaves Linda),” from 1985, in which the composer’s mix of sung and spoken texts and smooth electronic accompaniment advance a cryptic story of epic scope. Ms. Bell was in the original cast of Mr. Ashley’s final ensemble opera, “Crash,” which had its premiere as part of the 2014 Whitney Biennial. Others from that ensemble — Amirtha Kidambi, Brian McCorkle, Paul Pinto, Dave Ruder and Aliza Simons — will join her in “Improvement,” at the Kitchen in Manhattan Feb. 7-16. In this opera Ms. Bell assumes the central role of Linda: a modern American Jewish woman (whom Ashley based on the mother of a childhood friend) abandoned by her husband, but also employed as an allegorical representation of the Jewish diaspora, starting in Spain in 1492, when Jews were expelled by royal decree, and continuing to California in the mid-20th century. The role was created by Jacqueline Humbert, an effervescent artist featured on the 1992 Nonesuch recording of “Improvement.” Ms. Bell and Ms. Humbert discussed the perils and pleasures of being Linda in a recent conversation at the TriBeCa home of the arts administrator Mimi Johnson, Ashley’s widow, who helped produce his operas for 30 years. Ms. Humbert, in California, joined the chat by telephone. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. Jacqueline, what did Ashley tell you about Linda when you were about to create this character with him? JACQUELINE HUMBERT Obviously I was to represent the Jews from the time of the diaspora up until about 1952, and their travels throughout the world. I read through it a number of times to get a feeling for the shape of the piece, and to get the pitches in my mind. Then I went back and did extensive research into the history — everything from the Spanish Inquisition to Giordano Bruno, to Freud, Mussolini, and the Campo de’ Fiori [the Roman square where heretics, including Bruno, were executed], and eventually to Israel — so that I could match the emotion in my voice to the history that was being referenced.  Ashley’s operas are so dissimilar to conventional works in the genre. What did he actually put in front of you in the score? HUMBERT There’s just a pitch assignment and words. You can twist those words sonically however you feel like interpreting them. But he had this passacaglia [a sequence of variations over a repeating figure, usually in triple meter] running through it, these pitches, and they run through the whole piece. Was the interpretation largely left open to you? HUMBERT There was a lot of back and forth: I would try something, and he either liked it or he didn’t. We went through many incarnations before we hit on it. Gelsey, you’re a scholar. Did you undertake a similar kind of preparation? GELSEY BELL Well, I’d read Bruno a while ago when I was working on my dissertation. I’d read [Frances Yates’s] “The Art of Memory.” And I’ve done some more recent reading on 1492 and what has happened since. But also, one of the things that made me fall in love with Bob’s work, many years ago, was this idea of the West Coast identity of the person who had gotten so far away from the Old World, and what that meant for a diaspora of people coming from Europe. You’re coming to Linda with Jacqueline’s performances and recording out there. To what extent do you feel beholden to what’s been documented? BELL I first got to know this piece through the recording, so there are many aspects of what you did, Jackie, that feel really essential to me. But at the same time, there’s been a moment in this process where I stopped listening to the recording and just saw what came out of me. My voice is different from yours in many ways, Jackie, and so there are certain things that sound more natural and sincere coming from me: a slight change in the way I’m handling timbre, a slight change in the way I handle ornamentation in certain scenes. MIMI JOHNSON In this piece in particular, the recording is very important. Jackie, of course you cannot forget that in live performance, you doubled your own recorded voice. HUMBERT That was a trick in itself, because the task there was to match every syllable to what was on the underlying tracks. JOHNSON After you guys finished “Improvement,” all of the other operas Bob made in a completely different way.  When “Improvement” was staged originally, the singers were vocalizing over their recorded parts? HUMBERT The voices were embedded in the orchestra, and they couldn’t figure out how to separate them at the time. Tom Hamilton [the music director] has recently been able to do it, so they’re able to perform it live. BELL And Tom said he had a conversation with Bob at the time they were making the recording, and Bob was like, “We’re never going to do this live. This isn’t about a live version; this is about the recording, so don’t worry about this.” And then, you guys did it live. [Laughs] What are the biggest challenges of “Improvement,” and what are the most satisfying things about it? BELL What’s hardest? On a purely technical level, the way we have things set up now is that every word in the opera has a certain amount of beats, and there’s just that many beats that we’ll do, every show. It’s not like someone is pressing cues to follow you; you start those beats and the metronome’s going, and it will keep going until you get to the end. This is the first time I’ve ever been part of a piece that has been that rigid that’s so long. And there’ll be large sections where if you’re off, you just will have no idea for a while. It’s a very different way of working than having a conductor who’s following you. It’s so much fun performing Bob’s work. The language just never stops giving, both musically and philosophically. It’s some of the most enriching work that I’ve done, because every rehearsal you find something new, and something new speaks to you. Divorce has been a very big subject in my life, and there’s just not that many operas that deal with that aspect of human interaction. Around the time that you guys were recording this, my parents were getting divorced. It speaks to me in a way that a lot of opera just doesn’t. There’s something really amazing and emotional about being able to inhabit this role. HUMBERT I would say that the most challenging thing in doing “Improvement” was to make it sound effortless. There’s so many words, and it’s so hard, but he didn’t want there to be any sense of a struggle going on. It took a lot of practice to come to that place where it sounded effortless. But the most satisfying thing is when you finally get it, and you can do it, it feels wonderful. "
5c7cf77b49f0eacbf105b323,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/04/well/family/using-arts-education-to-help-other-lessons-stick.html,"In “A Tree Grows in Brooklyn,” Betty Smith’s 1943 autobiographical novel about growing up poor in the early 20th century, the public school that the heroine attends is a pretty bleak place. But “there was a great golden glory lasting a half-hour each week when Mr. Morton came to Francie’s room to teach music.” He taught them classical music, the book continues, without telling them what they were learning, setting his own words to the great works. “Little boys whistled part of Dvorak’s New World Symphony as they played marbles. When asked the name of the song, they’d reply ‘Oh, “Going Home.”’ They played potsy, humming ‘The Soldiers’ Chorus’ from Faust, which they called ‘Glory.’” Francie also looked forward to the visits of the drawing teacher; “these two visiting teachers were the gold and silver sun-splash in the great muddy river of school days.” Arts education in schools has introduced many children to great painters and great music, and helped them through their first dance steps or tentative musical endeavors. It can serve as a bright spot in the schoolchild’s day or week, a class that brings in beauty, color and joy, and which is not about testing. These subjects are often under threat either from budget cuts or from the inexorable demands of academic testing and “accountability,” but insights from neuroscience suggest that arts education can play additional important roles in how children learn. Paul T. Sowden, a professor of psychology at the University of Winchester in England, warned that in Britain, as in the United States, arts and humanities subjects have suffered in recent years as the emphasis shifted to science and technology. It's important, he said, that arts education be available equally to everyone. But arts education, he said, is a chance to build resilience and determination in children, as well as to help them master complex skills. Arts education encompasses many disciplines: “I’m talking about everything from music, drama, dance, design, visual arts,” Dr. Sowden said. And the goal goes beyond the specific subjects, he said: “You’re looking for opportunities in the arts education context to encourage children to ask questions, to use their imaginations, but also to approach their work in a systematic, disciplined way.” When children are younger, arts education helps develop their capacity for collaboration, for creativity, and even for asking questions. As they get older, he said, “their executive function is much more developed, their ability to sustain attentional tasks is much greater.” For them, arts education can offer the chance to refine and polish a skill over time, or revise a project until it is as good as it can be. Sometimes the arts are taught in a very set curriculum, Dr. Sowden said, but there are real advantages to teaching in a more exploratory way, where children can experiment. And both parents and teachers can encourage children to explore, he said; “that’s the way you get the biggest benefit, not just learning to reproduce a particular work by Monet or dance sequence.” The skills that children master in arts education, he said, may be transferable to other curricular areas. Mariale Hardiman, a professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Education, where she directs the neuro-education initiative, was interested in how children do — and don’t — retain what they learn in school. “A lot of the information we teach doesn’t stick.” What she saw as a school principal, she said, was that when arts were integrated into the curriculum, “learning became more visible.” Teachers told her “the children would remember the information better when they taught it through the arts.” So though arts education has many other benefits, she said, such as creative thinking, her studies have focused on children’s memory for academic subjects, comparing what children remembered 10 weeks after material was taught. Researchers wrote two different versions of the curriculum, matched for content and timing, both involving active learning, but one including arts education. For example, in an arts integrated curriculum, students would sketch their vocabulary words, or learn some of the material as songs, or act out molecular motion with their bodies. The children who had learned the material in the curriculum that made use of the arts remembered more, and the effect was largest among the children who were less strong academically, the “lower performers.”  “We found the biggest difference with children at the lower level of achievement,” Dr. Hardiman said. “Could this be at least one lever for closing an achievement gap?” After all, these are often the students who are condemned to dreary drill and repetition, in hopes of bringing them to a higher level: “What if the arts are a lever of school reform, better than the drill and kill we do with remedial students?” In a 2019 article in the journal Trends in Neuroscience and Education, Dr. Hardiman and her colleagues described the results of a randomized controlled trial looking at fifth-graders who were taught science content, some using techniques from arts education, and others with more conventional instruction. The researchers again saw an effect on the students with more limited reading skills; they remembered more science if they had learned with the integrated arts methods. So why might the arts integration help children’s memory? “Arts allow for elaboration, allow for repetition,” Dr. Hardiman said. “Memory is certainly enhanced through repetition, the more you revisit something, the more you remember it.” And the visual and performing arts also allow children to elaborate in creative ways on the material. The advantage of learning through the arts will come as no surprise to anyone who grew up with the “Fifty Nifty United States” song or learned how a bill becomes a law from Schoolhouse Rock. Some of today’s children are learning history from the lyrics of “Hamilton.”  I suddenly remembered a rather mournful tune from decades ago, in high school, when a science teacher told us we would be tested on the elements with a charge of positive 2 and a friend and I set them to a chant; I can still name them, in order, and when it comes to chemistry, I am definitely one of the less able students. “Arts integration should not replace arts education,” Dr. Hardiman said. She suggested a “three-legged stool,” with one leg being arts education, including dedicated classes in visual and performing arts, and the second arts and cultural offerings, such as artists coming into the school or visits to museums. The third leg would be the integration of the arts into the teaching of other subjects. “Parents can easily do simple arts activities with kids,” Dr. Hardiman said, and can incorporate these ideas around homework or just in spending time together. Maybe it would help to put the multiplication tables into a song, or ask children to sketch their ideas, or use body poses to show the emotion that a character in a story is feeling. Ronald Beghetto, a professor of educational psychology and the director of Innovation House at the University of Connecticut, studies creativity in educational settings, which, he said, “can be manifest across all different disciplines.” “We tend, as adults, to overplan and overstructure young people’s experiences,” Dr. Beghetto said. While structure is important, he said, so is “letting kids determine their own problems to solve, their own ways to solve them.”  Arts education, he said, can provide those structured opportunities that foster creativity.  “Working through some creative endeavor, we’re really resolving uncertainty,” he said. “We approach the blank canvas.” "
5c40f20d3a125f5075c04fdf,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/arts/television/masked-singer-costume-designer.html,"A peacock, a hippo, a monster and a unicorn each take to the stage, performing choreographed moves while belting pop tunes like “Don’t Stop Me Now” and “Oops … I Did It Again.” No, you didn’t eat one too many edibles. You’re watching “The Masked Singer,” Fox’s new competition series that pits 12 extravagantly costumed celebrities against each other. An adaptation of a South Korean series called “The King of Mask Singer,” the American version debuted earlier this month to an audience of more than nine million viewers. Because the identity of each famous participant is kept secret until the contestant is voted off the show, “The Masked Singer” can’t rely on the spectacle of their star power. (The host Nick Cannon, along with the celebrity panelists that include Jenny McCarthy and Robin Thicke, are low-wattage at best.) That’s where costume designer Marina Toybina comes in. A four-time Emmy winner, Toybina got her big break working on Britney Spears’s 2007 music video, “Piece of Me,” and has since collaborated with other A-list pop stars, including Ariana Grande, Taylor Swift and Miley Cyrus. And remember when Katy Perry was famously upstaged by two anthropomorphic dancing sharks during her 2015 Super Bowl halftime show? Toybina deserves much of the credit for the joy that Left Shark brought to our lives. Toybina spoke to The New York Times about her knack for idiosyncratic animal outfits and creating full-body costumes that won’t suffocate the person inside. (Hint: hidden fans.) These are edited excerpts from the conversation. If you saw what I was wearing right now, you’d probably die. I work from home. Girl, I just had a newborn. I’m in, like, two robes. I feel you. You seem to have carved out a niche for yourself as a creator of elaborate viral animal costumes. First, the infamous sharks for Katy Perry’s Super Bowl halftime show; and there were a couple of designs you did for Pink’s 2018 tour that involved some very realistic animal masks that look somewhat like the ones on “The Masked Singer.” Somehow, they’re all coincidences. Going back to the Super Bowl, that was a pretty incredible experience. It was the first time I’d ever dealt with puppetry, so we had to figure out how to start from scratch and learn the entire process day by day. Then in the beginning of last year, I did the costumes for Pink’s tour, and the idea was to have this very avant-garde forest scene where it’s like, half human, half animal. So there were masks involved there, which was like my trial-and-error before “The Masked Singer.” After designing Pink’s tour, two months later I got a call from one of the producers of the show and she sent me the original concept. I watched a few episodes and I was like, “Oh my gosh, we just did this.” Everything I’ve learned in the past five, 10 years led me to figure out how to do this show. So you don’t have a secret animal fetish. No, not at all! To be honest when I got the call I was just like, “What is happening with all these animals?” The costumes almost reminded me of Julie Taymor’s animals in the Broadway version of “The Lion King” — it’s almost just a suggestion of the animal, rather than a literal rendering. The idea was always to combine the elements of fashion with costume. So the costume part of it becomes the mask, and the fashion part of it became the outerwear. It wasn’t so literal. The deer that I created almost looks like a soldier. We put a lot of details into aging the jacket and creating the elements of this character. Every character had some sort of world that they lived in. I’m such a big fan of movies and the one thing I haven’t really done in my career is film. I was able to introduce everything that I was inspired by — “Donnie Darko” and “Edward Scissorhands” had a huge influence on the rabbit costume. The whimsical side of Narnia had a little bit of an influence on the lion and the unicorn. How did you conceive of the designs for the show? Did you first come up with the costumes and then the contestants chose which ones they liked? Or did they have more input? All the artwork was done before the casting, and once we were working with the casting, the producers and I we were able to figure out which 12 we wanted to keep. From there it was more collaborating, letting some of the cast members possibly choose their own costume or us hearing who’s being cast and thinking, “This would be a perfect costume for this person.” Somehow it just magically worked, even though it was trial and error. It sounds like you have really good karma! Usually when you sketch a 2D design, you do a lot of alterations to it when you start building the costume. If you look at the original sketches for the show versus the costumes that are onstage, we barely had any changes. I think it gave our celebrities, the famous behind-the-mask personas, a little bit of freedom to play around and become these characters because what they saw on paper is exactly what they look like onstage. It almost became like an inner-child experience for a lot of these people, an alter ego — to go out, cover their faces and become this character and truly have fun with it. I think that’s what made this show come to life. How do your designs differ from those on the Korean version? The one difference is how anime some of the [Korean-designed] masks were. I wanted to bring something that was a little bit more of a 360[-degree] mask that really hid our talent and embodied all these characters. A lot of the Korean elements had this extravagant mask and extravagant shoulder piece but then everything else was kind of toned down. We created fuller costumes, head-to-toe characters. One of my favorite designers is [Alexander] McQueen and I made sure the lion and the unicorn had this couture-y drape work that you don’t even see anymore. I think both fashion and costuming, the art of it is slowly going away. You see more and more digital work in film, in music videos. It was important for me to design this show the old-school way. It was important to do it all by hand. Does anyone ever complain that their costume is too heavy or difficult to move around in? Of course — you know, a costume is a costume. The difference between the stuff you buy at the store and a costume [is] you are going to have weight. You are going to have extra protection, extra seams, extra material, extra linings. But we were able to adapt different ways for the costumes to be removed so they can breathe. Everything from the way they were constructed was considered — breathing mechanisms, putting fans inside of masks, putting fans inside of the monster costume. Just making sure that we can circulate oxygen. Do you have a favorite costume? It’s hard to choose one but as far as intricacy I think the lion would probably be the one that took the longest to figure out, and a lot of heart and soul went into that one. What is your ultimate career goal as a designer? My biggest dream is to do film. I would absolutely love to work with someone like Tim Burton. Looking at movies like “Mary Poppins [Returns]” or “The Nutcracker [and the Four Realms],” that’s something I would love to do. So, a trippy adaptation of a beloved classic.  If these characters on the show could be part of Marvel, that would be amazing. "
5c5d456e3a125f5075c08ab6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/08/arts/music/paris-opera-bastille-anniversary.html,"PARIS — The Opéra Bastille was a laughingstock before it was even built. Turning 30 this year, the larger and more modern of the Paris Opera’s two theaters is widely regarded as one of the ugliest in Europe. And its comically embarrassing origin story — which even Stéphane Lissner, the company’s director, tells through chuckles — begins with a mistake. The long-serving French president François Mitterrand ordered a new opera house to be built in the early 1980s as one of his Grands Projets, like the I.M. Pei-designed Louvre Pyramid and the Grande Arche of La Défense. After receiving more than 700 proposals, with the architects’ names kept hidden, Mitterrand and his aides chose a design they thought was by Richard Meier, then a star (and now disgraced). It wasn’t. The name that was unveiled was Carlos Ott, a relatively unknown Uruguayan-Canadian architect who didn’t have any major credits on his résumé. But Mitterrand moved forward with the project, committing to a behemoth that became the third-largest building in the city, after two other Grands Projets — the enormous Bibliothèque Nationale and the Ministry for the Economy and Finance. Originally planned for the Parc de la Villette area on the outskirts of Paris — where Jean Nouvel’s Philharmonie concert hall opened in 2015 — the theater was moved to the Place de la Bastille, where the famous prison once stood. The location made sense for the opening date, meant to coincide with the 200th anniversary of the start of the French Revolution, when the prison was stormed by insurgents. And by the 1980s, the Bastille was a working-class area; this new opera house was conceived with a broadened public in mind. On that front, the Opéra Bastille has been a success: The average age of its audience is nearly 10 years younger than that of the Metropolitan Opera, and it’s not unusual for the Paris Opera to sell out both the 19th-century Palais Garnier (its 2,000-seat house in the expensive center of town, now primarily home to ballet and small-scale opera) and the 2,700-seat Bastille. “I think a lot of people don’t like the building,” Mr. Lissner said in an interview. “But the big majority today believes it was worth it, because a lot of people are able to go to the opera,” with more seats, and more diverse programming available. But while the Bastille has been a blessing in some respects (it also provided a wealth of new spaces for rehearsals and workshops), it has been glumly tolerated and mocked for virtually all of its existence. When the opera house opened in 1989, it wasn’t quite finished — along the way, concessions had been made, including the loss of a modular, or flexible, space desired by the influential composer and conductor Pierre Boulez, a de facto culture czar — and it didn’t even have a music director. In an article about the tumultuous days leading up to opening night, The New York Times repeated a common joke: “What is the difference between the Bastille Opera and the Titanic? The Titanic had an orchestra.” Another comparison with the Titanic could be made with the Bastille’s appearance, which from certain angles resembles a cruise ship. But ask 10 people in Paris what the building looks like, and you’ll probably hear 10 different answers: hospital, swimming pool, government office, airport. Few, if any, would say it looks like an opera house. The eminent French critic Christian Merlin, who attended the earliest productions at the Bastille, recalled in an interview finding the building “impressive but cold and gray, somewhat anonymous.” Mr. Lissner said it is “absolutely not convincing, aesthetically, from the outside.” Inside is not much different. Even entering is a challenge: The door appears to be on the second floor, accessible by way of a grand staircase. But it’s rarely used, and newcomers are left to find the real entrance on the ground floor. (On a recent visit for the opening night of a new production of Berlioz’s “Les Troyens,” the stairs were closed off with bright yellow tape.) Despite the building’s size, the lobby spaces are narrow, crowded and brightly lighted; it is nearly impossible to make it through an entire intermission without getting pushed. The theater itself, which occupies only about 5 percent of the building, is devoid of warmth: Its stone walls and fixtures have all the charm of a hotel convention center. (Mr. Ott, in a mid-2000s interview with the newsletter of the Institut François Mitterrand, said this was because he “didn’t want anything to detract from the performance.”) Balcony seats were designed to offer clear views of the stage — which they do, at the cost of some vertigo. Singers and directors alike must contend with the cavernous space. Manuel Brug, a German critic who has been visiting the theater for years, said it is “not possible to be intimate” there. In “Les Troyens,” for example, only the mezzo-soprano Stéphanie d’Oustrac, as Cassandre, seemed at ease penetrating the orchestra and filling the hall. The production’s director, Dmitri Tcherniakov, overcame the Bastille’s dimensions by pushing the cityscape of Troy back extremely far, opening up the rear of the theater to give the set the depth of three stages. “Everything has to always be big,” Mr. Brug said. “You have to have a kind of energy as a director that you don’t get swallowed by it.” Compare this with the Palais Garnier, commissioned by Napoleon III and designed with neo-Baroque opulence. A visit there is a step out of modernity and into a fairy tale. Not an inch of the gilded grand foyer is left undecorated; the nearby Salon du Soleil is a magical space with facing mirrors that create the illusion of a candlelit abyss. Inside the theater, which is densely packed with plush red seats, a monumental chandelier — the one that inspired the climax of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s musical “The Phantom of the Opera” — hangs from a ceiling magnificently painted by Chagall. The acoustics are forgiving, and conducive to jewel-box productions like a new staging of Scarlatti’s oratorio “Il Primo Omicidio,” which had its premiere the night before “Les Troyens.” “When I walk into the Garnier,” Mr. Lissner said, “I walk into a theater.” The Bastille was never meant to be an update of the Garnier — its populist mission aimed at shedding some of the Garnier’s perceived stuffiness — but Mr. Ott might have gone too far. Mr. Brug said the Bastille’s abundance of stone and metal, and harsh angles, has left it “so sober.” It is also a victim of poor urban planning. The Garnier is a clearly defined anchor of the Place de l’Opéra; people walking out of the Métro station there are welcomed by a postcard-ready view of the facade. When you stand in the theater’s loggia, you can look down l’Avenue de l’Opéra to the Louvre. But the Bastille sits on more of an intersection than a plaza. Place de la Bastille is a complicated roundabout with a columnar monument in the center. Given its history, the space is a common beginning or end point for demonstrations; on a recent Saturday, it was where Gilets Jaunes (“Yellow Vests”) protests converged, leading to the cancellation of a public dress rehearsal of “Rusalka” at the opera house. “It’s a place for demonstrations mostly,” Mr. Brug said, “and for traffic jams.” In this regard, the Opéra Bastille stands out among the Mitterrand-era Grands Projets. The Grande Arche is still very much the heart of La Défense, and the Louvre Pyramid has become one of Paris’s definitive landmarks. But the Bastille has never quite fit in, nor has it ever become more inviting. “As it often happens in France, the maintenance was neglected,” Mr. Merlin said, adding that at the Bastille “it was a little bit embarrassing to see safety nets on the facade after only a few years in order to prevent tiles from falling down.” There have been some improvement efforts. To celebrate the Paris Opera’s 350th anniversary, and the anniversary of the Bastille, this season, the company commissioned Claude Lévêque to create installations, collectively called “Saturnales,” for both its theaters. Light rods top the Bastille’s facade like a minimalist tiara; they can been seen from around the neighborhood. And Mr. Lissner, after taking over the company in 2015, installed a large screen above the steps of the Bastille, where he keeps his primary office. (He spruced it up with furniture from the Garnier.) “When you are outside, you can’t tell what kind of building this is,” he said. “So I decided to put this screen outside to show the program and images of the opera.” Mr. Brug said that he typically wouldn’t be a fan of something like this, but conceded that it gives the building “a vitality.” It’s unlikely the Bastille will change further any time soon, inside or out. Mr. Lissner said that would be difficult, and expensive. Mr. Merlin hopes that the acoustics will eventually be improved, “at any price.” But the Paris Opera is planning a new space there — a modular one, as once promised to Boulez, with room for an audience of 800 — that is expected to open in 2023. After holding a competition, the company recently hired the Danish firm Henning Larsen Architects, known for the Copenhagen Opera House and the Harpa concert hall in Reykjavik. This time, there was no mistake about whose design had been chosen. "
5cb4d7b049f0eacbf1f844a1,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/15/business/media/pulitzer-prizes.html,"Pulitzer Prizes were awarded on Monday to news organizations that uncovered instances of malfeasance and outright fraud in President Trump’s financial past, recognizing journalists’ perseverance in the face of the president’s ever-sharper attacks on a free press. The New York Times received the explanatory reporting prize for an 18-month investigation that revealed how the future president and his relatives avoided paying roughly half a billion dollars’ worth of taxes. The Wall Street Journal won the national reporting award for disclosing clandestine payoffs made by the president’s associates before the 2016 election to two women who had alleged affairs with Mr. Trump. Threats to journalists, foreign and domestic, provided a backdrop for this year’s prizes, which also honored reporters forced to cover deadly tragedies in their hometowns and, in one case, their own newsroom. In the cultural realm, the Pulitzers recognized the singer Aretha Franklin for her contributions to American music, the first special citation granted to a woman. The South Florida Sun Sentinel won the prize for public service, considered the most prestigious of the Pulitzers, for documenting the massacre of 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., in February. The paper’s in-depth articles revealed a series of failures by local officials and law enforcement that, the paper wrote, contributed to the loss of life. “Feeling overwhelmed and grateful,” a Sun Sentinel reporter, Scott Travis, wrote on Twitter after learning of the honor. “But also sad that we won the greatest journalism award — the Pulitzer — because of a tragedy that never should have happened.” [Here’s the full list of winners.] The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette won for breaking news coverage of a gunman’s spree at the Tree of Life synagogue in October, where 11 people died. The Pulitzer board also recognized The Capital Gazette of Annapolis, Md., where five employees were killed in a shooting in June, with a special citation that included a $100,000 bequest. Dana Canedy, the awards’ administrator, cited The Capital Gazette’s “unflagging commitment to covering news at a time of unspeakable grief.” In honoring The Sun Sentinel, The Post-Gazette and The Capital Gazette, the Pulitzer board underlined the importance of local journalism at a moment when regional papers are struggling to survive. First given in 1917, the Pulitzer Prizes are presented annually by Columbia University for excellence in journalism and letters. Invoking the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, The Washington Post columnist killed in Turkey by Saudi assassins, Ms. Canedy praised this year’s honorees for a willingness to speak truth to power. “This year’s winning work reflects yet again a steely resolve in upholding the principles of this noble profession,” Ms. Canedy said. The Times’s examination of Mr. Trump’s family finances, by the journalists David Barstow, Susanne Craig and Russ Buettner, drew on tens of thousands of pages of confidential records and previously undisclosed tax returns. The award was the fourth Pulitzer win for Mr. Barstow, a record for a reporter. (The news photographer Carol Guzy, the poet Robert Frost, the playwright Eugene O’Neill and the playwright and biographer Robert Sherwood have also won four prizes.) The Times won in the category of editorial writing, for essays by Brent Staples that grappled with questions of race, slavery, and memory in communities across the country. In accepting his award in The Times newsroom on Monday, Mr. Staples, who joined the paper’s editorial board in 1990, thanked his great-great-grandmother, who was born into slavery, saying, “I was channeling my family story.” The complexities of race and class figured in many of the prizewinning works. The award for drama went to Jackie Sibblies Drury for “Fairview,” a play that challenges viewers to confront their prejudices, and which The Times critic Ben Brantley called “dazzling and ruthless.” “Frederick Douglass: Prophet of Freedom,” an examination of the civil rights pioneer by David W. Blight, won the history prize, and the biography award went to Jeffrey C. Stewart for “The New Negro: The Life of Alain Locke,” a portrait of the Harlem Renaissance patron. Darrin Bell, a freelancer artist, became the first African-American to win for editorial cartooning, for a series published in The Washington Post on the experiences of disenfranchised groups under the Trump administration. It was one of three prizes awarded on Monday to The Post, including feature photography — for Lorenzo Tugnoli’s pictures of a famine in Yemen — and criticism, for essays by the paper’s nonfiction book critic, Carlos Lozada. The ProPublica journalist Hannah Dreier received the feature writing award, for capturing the plight of Salvadoran immigrants caught in a federal crackdown on MS-13 gang members on Long Island; one of her pieces was copublished by The New York Times Magazine. The staff of Reuters won the breaking news photography prize for a visual narrative of migrants traveling toward the United States border. The Los Angeles Times won the investigative reporting prize for revealing accusations of sexual abuse against a gynecologist at the University of Southern California. The reporting, by Matt Hamilton, Harriet Ryan and Paul Pringle, led in part to the resignation of the university’s president. Tony Messenger of The St. Louis Post-Dispatch received the commentary prize for columns about rural Missourians faced with unaffordable fines for minor offenses. The Advocate, of Baton Rouge, La., received the prize for local reporting for a critical examination of Louisiana’s criminal justice system. In the international reporting category, the year’s winners included Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, Reuters journalists imprisoned for more than a year in Myanmar. Their reporting, on human rights violations against Rohingya Muslims in the Southeast Asian nation, shared the prize with coverage by The Associated Press of atrocities in Yemen. The journalist Eliza Griswold won the nonfiction writing prize for “Amity and Prosperity: One Family and the Fracturing of America,” the story of an Appalachian family disrupted by an oil fracking company. The fiction prize went to Richard Powers for “The Overstory,” a narrative that entwines the lives of humans and trees. Ellen Reid won the music prize for her operatic work “p ris m,” and the poetry prize went to Forrest Gander for “Be With,” a collection of meditations on grief and loss. At the start of Monday’s ceremony, Ms. Canedy recognized an entry that had not won: 17 obituaries of slain Parkland students and faculty, written by the staff of the school’s student publication, The Eagle Eye. “These budding journalists remind us of the media’s unwavering commitment to bearing witness,” Ms. Canedy said, adding that the students’ work “should give us all hope for the future of journalism in this great democracy.” "
5c4f09c23a125f5075c06b01,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/28/arts/television/rent-live-review.html,"A longstanding superstition holds that saying the title of William Shakespeare’s “Macbeth” while inside a theater — unless you are rehearsing or performing the play itself — will bring about a terrible curse. The notion is based on an unfounded legend, but it makes you wonder what people were saying in the studio where “Rent: Live” was rehearsing the past few weeks. On Sunday, not long before the 8 p.m. curtain for the musical’s live broadcast on Fox, the network announced that Brennin Hunt, the actor playing Roger, seriously injured his foot while performing during the previous day’s dress rehearsal. Unlike on Broadway (and in most professional theater productions), the show did not have understudies for its leads. The solution? Much of what viewers would see would be Saturday’s recorded performance, the cast noted in a statement during an early commercial break. The final 15 minutes or so were live; Hunt was at a table, his foot in a cast and propped on a chair. (Hashtags like #RentNotLive and #RentKindaLive trended during the broadcast.) [Read more about the barely live “Rent: Live.”] It feels a bit weird to critique what was almost entirely a recorded dress rehearsal. How do you measure three hours of chaotic visuals and middling audio most of us were never meant to see and hear? Mostly in disappointment, I guess, though this is what Fox gave us. “Rent,” Jonathan Larson’s musical about a ragtag bunch of young squatters who self-righteously equate their refusal to pay their landlord to sticking it to The Man, debuted at New York Theater Workshop in 1996 and went on to become a Broadway juggernaut. But it’s a curious choice for a major network production. It’s not family friendly in the way that “The Sound of Music” or “The Wiz” are, or “Grease” sort of is. It’s a show so of its time (garage rock filtered through a Broadway sensibility!) that it can be easy to play down the impact it had as a daring, wildly progressive musical prominently featuring characters of color, queer romance and people living with (and dying from) AIDS, at a time when the disease and its victims were rarely front and center in pop culture. [See photos from the original production of “Rent.”] Few moments from “Rent: Live” evoked what made the show so special. The sound mixing was rough — characters’ voices were sometimes too soft, too loud or just too muddled to comprehend. It didn’t help that the overzealous crowd, perhaps primed from years of “American Idol” and the like, chimed in to “woo” and cheer whenever an actor belted a long note — which, if you aren’t familiar with “Rent,” occurs a lot.  In the case of “Today 4 U,” a musical showcase for the larger-than-life optimist Angel (Valentina, a star of “RuPaul’s Drag Race”), the audience was so hyped it drowned out much of her vocals. Also too muddled to comprehend: the frantic, overwrought camerawork. “Rent: Live” was directed by Michael Greif, who oversaw the original Broadway production, and Alex Rudzinski, but they both seemed to be channeling Baz Luhrmann. The cameras swooped around the sprawling stage erratically, without any ostensible purpose other than to distinguish this from feeling like a theater production. During “Will I?,” a simple melody sung by the chorus in a round, the focus shifted dizzily from one character to another, effectively dulling the moment’s emotional resonance. As with network TV’s other recent live musicals, the cast was a mix of stage and screen performers, along with a couple of pop stars. The results were all over the place: The R&B singers Tinashe and Mario, playing Mimi and Benny, did fine, but they weren’t standouts. Jordan Fisher’s Mark was lithe and fun to watch while dancing, particularly during “La Vie Boheme.” The highlights included Vanessa Hudgens as the flighty performance artist and activist Maureen and Kiersey Clemons as her uptight lawyer girlfriend, Joanne, performing “Take Me or Leave Me.” It’s a fun duet brimming with flirtations and frustrations, a favorite song of countless high school theater nerds (like me) and karaoke enthusiasts — and Hudgens and Clemons nailed it in the dress rehearsal, convincingly playing the feverish couple at a crossroads while hitting those notes. As Collins, the Broadway actor Brandon Victor Dixon (who played Judas in last spring’s live TV broadcast of “Jesus Christ Superstar”) also gave a towering performance during the number “I’ll Cover You (Reprise).” He brought soul and the pangs of grief and loss into every lyric, and when the chorus joined in, it was haunting. Around 10:45 p.m., the would-be live show finally became live. Unfortunately, the last few songs of “Rent” are some of the musical’s most unremarkable, as the story hurtles awkwardly toward its jarring ending. [Read The Times’s original review of “Rent.”] Yet in those moments, as the characters comforted one another during the final song and cast members from the original Broadway production, including Idina Menzel, Taye Diggs and Anthony Rapp, appeared onstage for “Seasons of Love,” I regretted that these hard-working performers didn’t get to put on the show that they had signed up for (even if the fully live “Rent” probably would have suffered from the same maddening camera whiplash and bad sound). Yes, it was disappointing. But clearly there was love in this production, too. "
5c38e6183a125f5075c03f9a,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/11/style/rock-masculinity-men-emotions.html,"When Sam Fender, 22, a British singer-songwriter, released “Dead Boys” four months ago, a song about the suicide of a close male friend, he had no idea that so dour a subject would resonate so deeply.  The song, which exorcised his grief in a torrent of fidgety guitars, frantic beats and haunted vocals, has been streamed more than 3.5 million times on Spotify, and its video has about 850,000 views on YouTube. In December, he won the Critics’ Choice 2019 Brit Award (Britain’s equivalent to the Grammys). While writing the song, Mr. Fender learned that 84 British men commit suicide each week; another friend killed himself after he finished recording the song. Mr. Fender blames those losses, in part, on “a world where men don’t feel they can talk about their problems, no matter how bad they are,” he said. “I started to question all the archaic ideas of what a bloke is supposed to be.”  On that score, he has plenty of musical company.  In recent months, a number of male rock musicians and hip-hop artists have released songs that rail against the most suffocating notions of what it can mean to be a man. And they’re finding a significant audience by doing so.  The new album by the brutalist British band Idles, “Joy as an Act of Resistance,” uses toxic masculinity as a sustained theme. It was a top 5 hit in Britain and has garnered some of the most awed reviews of the year. The Guardian ranked it No. 6 on its list of best 50 albums of 2018, writing that listening to it “often feels like purging yourself of the year’s toxicity in one pent-up blizzard of drums and guitars.” As It Is, a neo-emo band from Brighton, England, released a single last June, “The Stigma (Boys Don’t Cry),” that attacks traditional male restrictions. The band’s current album, “The Great Depression,” has been streamed more than 13 million times on Spotify.  American artists have tackled the issue as well, including Tiny Moving Parts, an emo group from Minnesota, who released the album “Swell” last year. And Henry Jamison, 30, a singer-songwriter in Vermont, addresses what Rolling Stone magazine calls “violent interpretations of masculinity” in “Gloria Duplex,” an album due out next month.  The men, who all identify as heterosexual, say their writing is a direct result of the #MeToo movement and the dialogue about gender identity. “All these norms that we see aren’t normal at all,” said Joe Talbot, the lead singer and writer of Idles. “It’s a giant lie.” For Mr. Talbot, 33, personal tragedy also brought the issues home. In 2017, his wife gave birth to a stillborn girl. “It was the most traumatic experience I will ever go through,” he said. “But I kept myself detached from my emotions. I thought it was stoicism. That’s not stoicism. It’s ignorance.” It took months of therapy, and reading Grayson Perry’s 2016 book dissecting male tropes, “The Descent of Man,” before Mr. Talbot said he could “connect with other people and finally feel less lonely.”  Jordan Stephens, 26, a British hip-hop musician and actor, underwent a similar journey after a sudden breakup. “I had never experienced a loss of control like that,” Mr. Stephens said. “I was crying about stuff that had nothing to do with the breakup, stuff that I had put away for years, like my grandma dying.” “I thought, something is wrong with men’s relationships to emotion,” he said. The experience moved him to write an essay in The Guardian in October titled “Toxic masculinity is everywhere. It’s up to us men to fix this.”  “For years, I had been a finger-pointing feminist,” he said. “I would call out every guy but myself. But the breakup and what happened around it put up a mirror to my own issues.” The fact that music has become a key way for these men to explore these themes has deep antecedents. Elvis Presley blew away traditional gender roles by presenting himself as a hip-swinging sex symbol, a role more commonly reserved for women at the time. Transgressive stars of the 1960s, like Mick Jagger, and glam-rockers of the ’70s, like David Bowie, used androgyny to push back against gender constraints.  That dynamic has remained part of popular music ever since, though it has often been expressed just by teasing implication or as an act of provocation for commercial gain. See: hair metal bands like Mötley Crüe and Poison.  The current crop of maverick musicians takes a more earnest approach. One of their boldest precursors is Henry Rollins. Starting in the ’80s, his hard-core music, confrontational spoken-word pieces, and he-man persona consciously used virility to attack itself — something that Idles now does just as avidly.  Mr. Rollins, 57, sees significant change between many of today’s musicians and those of his early days. “The entire scene is so less testosterone loaded,” he said. Younger musicians “have broken with the past. It’s a more open and truthful conversation we’re having now. I went to an all-boys school. We had gay teachers. Couldn’t talk about it. Gay students. Never mentioned.” “The conversation about gender fluidity makes me feel old,” he said, but “I see I have to continually evolve.”  Indeed, musicians in their 30s already feel a cultural rift with peers in their 20s on matters of gender identity. “When I was in college 10 years ago, we were just horrible,” Mr. Jamison said. “People in their 20s are examining these issues in a way that feels very natural. They’re not going to have trouble if someone takes on a different pronoun.” Still, the men worry that airing their issues may be seen as yet another case of men seizing the mic from women. “I don’t want to in any way belittle the struggles of other people while talking about the struggles of a straight man,” said Patty Walters, 27, the lead singer of As It Is. “At the same time, toxic masculinity is real.” "
5c882fcb49f0eacbf105cb6a,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/12/obituaries/hal-blaine-dead.html,"Hal Blaine, the ubiquitous drummer whose work in the 1960s and ’70s with Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, Barbra Streisand, the Beach Boys, Simon & Garfunkel, the Ronettes and many others established him as one of the top session musicians of all time, died on Monday at his home in Palm Desert, Calif. He was 90. His son-in-law, Andy Johnson, confirmed the death. Mr. Blaine, who played on at least 40 singles that reached No. 1 on the Billboard pop chart, was a reliable and adaptable musician, able to offer delicate brushwork on a ballad or a booming beat on records produced by Phil Spector, who was known for his so-called Wall of Sound. Mr. Blaine brought drama to a song’s transitions, often telegraphing a big moment with a flurry of strokes on a snare drum or tom-tom. If he had a signature moment on a record, it was on the Ronettes’ 1963 hit, “Be My Baby,” produced by Mr. Spector. The song opened cold, with Mr. Blaine playing — and repeating — the percussive earworm “Bum-ba-bum-BOOM!” But the riff came about accidentally. “I was supposed to play more of a boom-chicky-boom beat, but my stick got stuck and it came out boom, boom-boom chick,” he told The Wall Street Journal in 2011. “I just made sure to make the same mistake every few bars.” Three years later, he used the same beat, but in a softer way, on Frank Sinatra’s “Strangers in the Night.” Mr. Blaine was part of a loosely affiliated group of session musicians who in the early 1960s began dominating rock ’n’ roll recording in Los Angeles. Along with guitarists like Glen Campbell and Tommy Tedesco, bassists like Carol Kaye and Joe Osborn, and keyboardists like Leon Russell and Don Randi, Mr. Blaine played on thousands of recordings through the mid-1970s. He famously said he gave the group its name, the Wrecking Crew, although Ms. Kaye has insisted that he did not start using that term until years after the musicians had stopped working together. His skills led producers to use Mr. Blaine as the drummer for various groups’ studio work, replacing their credited drummers. The drummer heard on the Beach Boys’ records was often Mr. Blaine and not the drummer the group’s fans knew, Dennis Wilson, whose brother Brian was the band’s creative force. “I must tell you, first of all, Dennis was not really a drummer,” Mr. Blaine told Modern Drummer magazine in 2005. “I mean, they had bought him drums because they needed drums in the group. So he learned as they went on.” Asked if Mr. Wilson was angry that he was replaced in the studio, Mr. Blaine said he was not. “He was thrilled,” he said, “because while I was making Beach Boy records, he was out surfing or riding his motorcycle. During the day, when I was making $35 or $40, that night he was making $35,000” performing live. Mr. Blaine’s other studio credits include Presley’s “Can’t Help Falling in Love,” Simon & Garfunkel’s “Mrs. Robinson,” the 5th Dimension’s “Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In,” the Byrds’ “Mr. Tambourine Man,” Ms. Streisand’s “The Way We Were,” the Crystals’ “Da Doo Ron Ron” and Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass’s “A Taste of Honey.” In 2000, Mr. Blaine was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame with four other studio musicians, including the drummer Earl Palmer, who had helped introduce him to session work. The Recording Academy gave Mr. Blaine a lifetime achievement Grammy Award last year. Hal Blaine was born Harold Simon Belsky on Feb. 5, 1929, in Holyoke, Mass., to Meyer Belsky, who worked in a leather factory, and Rose (Silverman) Belsky. When he was 7 the family moved to Hartford, where he was inspired to learn drumming by watching the fife and drum corps of the Roman Catholic school across the street from his Hebrew school. “One of the priests noticed I was watching, and before long I was playing with these kids,” he told The Hartford Courant in 2000. On Saturdays, he regularly went to a theater in Hartford to watch big bands, singers and vaudeville acts, and he grew to admire virtuoso drummers like Buddy Rich and Gene Krupa. When he was 14, he moved with his family to Southern California. He attended high school in San Bernardino while his parents opened a delicatessen in Santa Monica. After serving as an Army cartographer during the Korean War, Mr. Blaine attended a drum school in Chicago run by Roy C. Knapp, who had been Mr. Krupa’s teacher. He began to play drums in strip clubs, and by the late 1950s he was working with a jazz quartet. He then worked with the teenage idol Tommy Sands and the pop singer Patti Page. He also played briefly with Count Basie’s big band at the Waldorf Astoria in New York, filling in when Mr. Basie’s regular drummer, Sonny Payne, was sick. Until the early 1960s, Mr. Blaine thought of himself as a jazz drummer. But his work in the Los Angeles studios identified him, almost exclusively, as pop music’s go-to session drummer. Once he established himself in the studios, Mr. Blaine rarely performed live. One exception came in the 1960s, when Nancy Sinatra persuaded him to work with her at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas; she put his name on the marquee and arranged for a nanny for his daughter, Michelle. And in the mid-1970s, John Denver brought him on tour. “His favorite time was with John,” Mr. Johnson, Mr. Blaine’s son-in-law, said in a telephone interview. “They were like brothers, and he was really torn up when John passed.” Mr. Denver died in 1997 when the single-engine airplane he was piloting crashed into Monterey Bay in California. Mr. Blaine is survived by his daughter, Michelle Blaine, and seven grandchildren. He was married and divorced five times. Mr. Blaine was far less busy in studios in the 1980s. By then producers were increasingly relying on drum machines, and more self-contained bands insisted on playing their own instruments. He started giving drum clinics and worked on commercial jingles. He played most recently at a party for his 90th birthday at a Los Angeles nightclub. Jim Keltner, a drummer who also became known for his session work, recalled the first time he saw Mr. Blaine play, in the 1960s. “I can hardly describe the effect it had on me,” Mr. Keltner wrote in the foreword to “Hal Blaine & the Wrecking Crew” (1990), an autobiography written with David Goggin. “He was playing a beat I’d heard thousands of times but was giving it a certain kind of sophisticated funk that I’d never heard before.” “How was he able to do these things with his drums?” "
5c42732c3a125f5075c053bf,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/18/obituaries/lorna-doom-dead.html,"Teresa Ryan, who played bass in the proudly extreme 1970s Los Angeles punk band Germs under the name Lorna Doom, died on Wednesday in Thousand Oaks, Calif. She was 61. Her death, in a hospital, was announced on Facebook by the band’s drummer, Don Bolles, and confirmed by her cousin Beth Bergman, who said the cause was cancer. Ms. Ryan would stand calmly onstage with her bass lines propelling the music along with Mr. Bolles’s beat, while Germs’ leader, Darby Crash, delivered the songs with anarchic, often bloodily self-mutilating intensity: confronting audience members, lighting matches, smashing glasses on his head. Germs shows often sparked riots in the audience. The band made one album and lasted until 1980, when Darby Crash (born Jan Paul Beahm) killed himself with a heroin overdose. He had often spoken of a five-year plan to create a notorious cult band, record one album and then commit suicide to make himself legendary. Germs formed in 1976 with an initial lineup of Darby Crash, Lorna Doom, Pat Smear (born Georg Albert Ruthenberg) on guitar (he later toured with Nirvana and became a member of Foo Fighters) and Belinda Carlisle on drums (she was replaced by Mr. Bolles). Ms. Carlisle, who went on to be the lead singer of the Go-Go’s, wrote on Twitter on Thursday that Ms. Ryan “was a visionary and a trailblazer” who “never compromised.” Teresa Marie Ryan was born on Jan. 4, 1958, in Dallas and grew up in Southern California and Nebraska. Her father, James Patrick Ryan, was a lumber store manager; her mother, Betty Marie (Bruenecke) Ryan, was a homemaker. Ms. Ryan and Ms. Carlisle, who were high school friends, were recruited into Germs through an ad placed by the other two original members calling for “two untalented girls” to join a band. Darby Crash renamed them — Ms. Carlisle became Dottie Danger — and, true to early punk style, musical skill didn’t matter. Ms. Ryan learned her instrument while in the band, although she earned praise from musicians like Mike Watt, the bassist for the Minutemen, who said on Twitter, “Good people, I love LOVE germs bass lines!” Germs played its first show in April 1977, and six months later released the single “Forming”/”Sexboy,” which is often cited as the first Los Angeles punk record. Germs became a resident band at the Los Angeles club the Masque and thrived on shock value. At some shows, Darby Crash would cut into his chest a symbol that he called “circle one”; Germs fans showed loyalty by giving one another cigarette burns. Laura Jane Grace of the band Against Me! posted on Twitter, “I can still see the ‘Germs burn’ on my wrist from when I was 14 years old.” Germs’ only album, “(GI),” was produced by Joan Jett and released in 1979. Its lyric sheet revealed the poetic intelligence of the words that Darby Crash would drunkenly yowl, slur or skip during performances. The band also recorded six songs for the William Friedkin film “Cruising,” although only one, “Lion’s Share,” was used. During the late-1970s punk era, Germs shows grew tumultuous. “It all got terribly violent and extremely frightening towards the end,” Ms. Ryan told The Guardian in 2008. “There was this influx of punks from Southern California who latched on to our gigs and basically made it impossible for us to play without a riot happening. That was the beginning of the end.” By 1980, most promoters were unwilling to book the band. “Now we can’t play anywhere,” Darby Crash complained in Penelope Spheeris’s 1981 punk documentary, “The Decline of Western Civilization.” He started another band, but regrouped Germs for a final show on Dec. 3, 1980. Four days later, he was dead. Ms. Ryan moved to New York City with her boyfriend, who was the bassist in Joan Jett’s band, the Blackhearts. Born Gary Moss, he took Ms. Ryan’s last name as a stage name when he joined the band in 1979, performing as Gary Ryan. They were married in the early 1980s and divorced in the 1990s. Ms. Ryan is survived by her brother, Richard Ryan. In New York City, Ms. Ryan worked for art galleries. She returned to California in the early 2000s to help care for her ailing father, and worked there as a personal assistant and a bookkeeper. She lived in Agoura Hills, Calif. Ms. Ryan was an adviser for “What We Do Is Secret,” a 2007 movie about Germs that featured Shane West as Darby Crash and Bijou Phillips as Lorna Doom. After singing with the reunited Germs at a party for the film, Mr. West went on to tour as lead singer with the surviving band members. In clubs, and on the Warped Tour in 2006 and 2008, Germs performed for a younger, more well-behaved generation of punk fans. “It was totally surprising to get the band together again,” Ms. Ryan told The Guardian, “but it’s also the most comfortable thing in the world.” "
5c33d6ab3a125f5075c033d1,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/07/obituaries/howell-begle-dead.html,"Howell Begle, a Washington lawyer who found a second career crusading on behalf of underpaid black R&B stars of the 1950s and ’60s, leading to industrywide royalty reform and the creation of the charitable Rhythm & Blues Foundation, died on Dec. 30 at a hospital in Lebanon, N.H. He was 74. His wife, Julie Eilber, said the cause was injuries he sustained in a skiing accident on Dec. 24. Mr. Begle (rhymes with eagle) was a successful corporate lawyer with a specialty in media mergers and a roster of high-profile arts clients, like the Kennedy Center, when, in 1982, a friend encouraged him to meet Ruth Brown, the singer of 1950s R&B classics like “Teardrops From My Eyes” and “(Mama) He Treats Your Daughter Mean.” A lifelong fan of Ms. Brown’s music, Mr. Begle met her after a performance and brought along some records for her to sign. When she told Mr. Begle that she had not received any royalties in decades, he said he would look into the problem. Ms. Brown had spent years trying to recover royalties from her former record company, Atlantic. One of the label’s earliest and biggest stars, she was so associated with Atlantic that it was sometimes called “the house that Ruth built.” But she had not been paid since leaving the label in the early 1960s. In the fallow years of her career, she had worked as a maid and a bus driver. Like most artists of her generation, Ms. Brown had signed contracts with very low royalty rates — hers was 5 percent, compared with a standard of about 15 percent today. Many of those artists, particularly black ones in genres like blues and R&B, were further exploited through shoddy bookkeeping and questionable business practices. Excessive expenses were often charged against artists’ accounts, leaving them eternally indebted to their labels and therefore ineligible for royalties. Digging through the accounts of Ms. Brown and other Atlantic artists, including the Coasters, the Drifters and Big Joe Turner, Mr. Begle found further problems. Since 1969, for example, the label had simply stopped mailing quarterly statements, although they were contractually required to. For a 1985 Atlantic R&B compilation, Ms. Brown and Mr. Turner’s accounts had been charged for new mastering, editing and mixing expenses. Such practices were widespread, but Atlantic was a vulnerable target. Ahmet Ertegun, the most prominent of the label’s founders, was revered in the industry and had a reputation for treating artists well. Ms. Brown’s case threatened to undermine that. As a seasoned Washington insider, Mr. Begle also knew how to pressure Atlantic and its parent company, Warner Communications. Ms. Brown testified before a congressional panel and was interviewed by a sympathetic Meredith Vieira on “West 57th,” a CBS newsmagazine. In 1986, Steve Ross, the chief executive of Warner Communications, met with Mr. Begle and the Rev. Jesse Jackson. Throughout this campaign, Mr. Begle considered Ms. Brown his most valuable weapon. “I truly believed in Ruth because this woman was tough as nails,” he was quoted as saying in “The Last Sultan: The Life and Times of Ahmet Ertegun,” a 2011 biography by Robert Greenfield. “I knew I could trust her, and I believe Atlantic knew she was not going to be bought off.” Mr. Begle did his work pro bono; his firm, Verner, Liipfert, Bernhard, McPherson and Hand, wrote off at least $60,000 in expenses. Both Ruth Brown and Ahmet Ertegun died in 2006. In 1988, as pressure mounted on Mr. Ertegun leading up to the celebration of Atlantic’s 40th anniversary, the label announced that it would waive the unrecouped debts and recalculate royalties for Ms. Brown and others of its R&B artists back to 1970. (Files were incomplete before that date, the company said.) Ms. Brown received her first royalty payment in 28 years, for about $20,000. A donation from Atlantic of nearly $2 million that year helped create the Rhythm & Blues Foundation, which gives grants to artists in need. Mr. Begle was its first executive director. In time, most other major labels followed Atlantic’s lead in giving legacy artists improved royalty rates. The singer-songwriter Bonnie Raitt, a founding board member of the foundation, said in a statement, “Howell’s dedication and tenacity in fighting for royalty reform and recognition for the whole generation of pioneer R&B artists who were denied both in the measure they deserve will always make him a hero to me.” Howell Edward Begle Jr. was born in Detroit on Jan. 4, 1944. After his parents divorced, he moved with his mother, Lucille, to Scottsdale, Ariz., and later to Stuart, Fla. He graduated from the University of the South, in Sewanee, Tenn., in 1965 with a degree in political science. His wife said he had fed his love of R&B at wild parties on the campus, where bands like Doug Clark and the Hot Nuts performed. Mr. Begle received a law degree from the University of Michigan in 1968 and was soon drafted into the Army. He was commissioned a captain despite having no military education. Stationed in Okinawa, he worked in the Judge Advocate General’s Corps, the military law division. While there he also booked concerts by acts like Ike and Tina Turner. He moved to Washington and joined Verner, Liipfert after leaving the Army in 1973, becoming a partner. In later years he operated his own firm, Howell Begle and Associates, based at his home in Boston. He continued to represent the Kennedy Center for its annual honors event, as well as the American Film Institute and the Academy Awards, clearing the rights to film clips for the Oscars broadcast. Besides his wife, his survivors include three sons, Mark, Matthew and Charles; a daughter, Kristin Edwards; a sister, Cathy Deggeller; and three grandchildren. In a 1990 interview with Rolling Stone, Ms. Brown said that in the midst of her battle with Atlantic, Mr. Ertegun once visited her backstage while she was performing in the Off Broadway show “Staggerlee.” They embraced, and he told her that “everything’s going to be all right,” that he would never let anything happen to her. Then, Ms. Brown recalled, before Mr. Ertegun left, he added, “You know, Ruth, you got a good lawyer.” "

5c476ccf3a125f5075c05b7a,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/22/obituaries/kaye-ballard-dead.html,"Kaye Ballard, whose long career as a comedian, actress and nightclub performer included well-regarded runs in “The Golden Apple” and “Carnival!” on Broadway and a classic turn as a television mother-in-law, died on Monday at her home in Rancho Mirage, Calif. She was 93. Her death was announced by her lawyer, Mark Sendroff. Ms. Ballard wasn’t a top-flight singer, an Oscar-caliber actress or a drop-dead beauty — she once played one of Cinderella’s ugly stepsisters — but she made up for any shortcomings with determination and a sheer love of performing. Even after she became well known, Ms. Ballard was not above taking parts in touring shows and regional theaters, and she rode the nightclub circuit for years, though she found the pace exhausting. In 2000, in her mid-70s, she brought a cabaret show to Arci’s Place in Manhattan called “Another Final Farewell Appearance,” but there was nothing final about it: Later in the decade she was still hard at work, including in tours of “The Full Monty” and “Nunsense.” For the last 40 years or so of her performing career, wherever she was appearing people would mention one particular item from her lengthy résumé: “The Mothers-in-Law,” an NBC sitcom in which she and Eve Arden played neighbors whose children married, turning the newly minted mothers-in-law into partners in meddling. Ms. Arden’s character was a haughty upper-crust type; Ms. Ballard’s was brassy and very Italian. The show made its debut in 1967, and, as with many sitcoms in that era of only three networks, its characters seared their way into the public consciousness with a disproportionate vigor: The series lasted only two seasons, but the mother-in-law personas acquired a certain immortality. “The show was on just long enough to typecast me as a loudmouth Italian actress, but not long enough to ensure that I would earn the kind of money where I wouldn’t have to worry about being typecast,” Ms. Ballard said in “How I Lost 10 Pounds in 53 Years,” a memoir written with Jim Hesselman and published in 2006. Ms. Ballard was born Catherine Gloria Balotta in Cleveland on Nov. 20, 1925, the second of four children. Her father, Vincenzo, and her mother, Lena (Nacarato) Balotta, had both immigrated from Italy. Her father laid concrete sidewalks for a living. “He used to take me all over Cleveland showing me his work,” Ms. Ballard wrote. Even as a child she wanted to be an entertainer, and she passed up a scholarship to Cleveland Art College to pursue that goal. She got her first laughs doing impressions, a skill that served her well for decades in her nightclub acts. (She did a pretty good Bette Davis. She and a second impressionist once appeared on the TV game show “To Tell the Truth” along with Davis herself; four masked panelists asked questions and tried to guess which of the three was the real thing. Davis received three votes, but Ms. Ballard got the other.) Ms. Ballard found an agent in Cleveland and played some local spots, calling herself Kay Ballad; the first name soon acquired an E and the last an R. Then, not yet 20, she was booked on a burlesque tour, doing impressions and skits, which led to a job in Detroit at the Bowery Room, whose owner knew the bandleader Spike Jones and spoke highly of her to him. She hopped a plane to Los Angeles to try to talk her way into Jones’s show and succeeded, winding up singing and also, using her high school band skills, playing flute and tuba. Ms. Ballard toured the vaudeville circuit with Jones for almost two years, but when their show hit New York she was captivated by musical theater; in 1946 she was offered a part in “Three to Make Ready,” a Broadway revue that was about to go on tour, and she took it. Stage appearances all over the country followed in the next several years. Then, in 1954, she won the part of Helen (as in “of Troy”) in “The Golden Apple,” an unusual musical with book and lyrics by John Latouche and music by Jerome Moross that drew on “The Iliad” to tell a story set in early-20th-century Washington State. The show opened at the Phoenix Theater in the East Village and, riding strong reviews, moved to Broadway soon after, running there for 125 performances. Ms. Ballard’s part included the song “Lazy Afternoon,” which Brooks Atkinson, in The New York Times, called “a triumphant number and the high point of the show.” The song was later recorded by many artists, including Barbra Streisand, but Ms. Ballard was the first to release it as a single; on the flip side of that record she introduced another song later made far more famous by others (including, memorably, Peggy Lee and Frank Sinatra), Bart Howard’s “Fly Me to the Moon” (then called “In Other Words”). Her next Broadway role, in 1961, was also in an atypical musical: “Carnival!,” with music and lyrics by Bob Merrill and a book by Michael Stewart. Unlike “The Golden Apple,” though, this one enjoyed a sustained Broadway run, lasting almost two years. Ms. Ballard was the Incomparable Rosalie, a magician’s assistant. For one song, “Always, Always You,” she was in a basket into which her boss, Marco the Magnificent (James Mitchell), kept thrusting swords. Ms. Ballard also appeared in two Broadway flops, “The Beast in Me” in 1963 and “Molly” in 1973, a musical using Gertrude Berg’s characters from the television show “The Goldbergs” and the radio show that preceded it. (For “Molly,” in which Ms. Ballard played the title character, she dropped the E from “Kaye” in her billing. “Let’s just say that I will never go to a numerologist again for advice!” she wrote in her book by way of explanation.) And she was in one television special with a noteworthy theatrical pedigree: Rodgers and Hammerstein’s “Cinderella,” created for CBS. It featured Julie Andrews in the lead; Ms. Ballard and Alice Ghostley played the stepsisters. Its one broadcast, on March 31, 1957, drew an estimated audience of 107 million, a record at the time. After that, Ms. Ballard began turning up on television in guest spots and on variety shows. Desi Arnaz, the executive producer of “The Mothers-in-Law,” eventually picked her for the show after deciding that Ann Sothern, who was originally slated for the role, did not provide enough of a contrast to Ms. Arden’s character. In the early 1970s Ms. Ballard also had a recurring role on “The Doris Day Show,” and her résumé came to include guest appearances on shows like “The Love Boat” and “Trapper John, M.D.” While working regularly in television and making the occasional film, Ms. Ballard toured nightclubs (Arthur Siegel was her longtime pianist) and made the rounds with “Hey, Ma … Kaye Ballard,” a one-woman show recounting her career and her clashes with her mother. Breast cancer, diagnosed in 1994, slowed her down only briefly. Her successes after that included an appearance in a widely acclaimed revival of “Follies” at the Paper Mill Playhouse in New Jersey in 1998. Ms. Ballard, who never married but said she had been engaged four times, leaves no immediate survivors. Last week, a new documentary about her career by Dan Wingate, “Kaye Ballard — The Show Goes On!,” was screened at the Palm Springs International Film Festival. Despite her name recognition, Ms. Ballard knew that she was never an A-list star. Instead, she viewed herself as being in the honorable second tier of performers who work hard but might not achieve lasting fame. Another was Billy De Wolfe, a character actor and friend who died in 1974, and whom she honored with a brief chapter in her book. “He’s yet another performer who falls into the category of brilliant ‘supporting players’ who I feel left the public’s consciousness much too soon after they passed away,” she wrote. “Who knows, perhaps I have a fear that the same thing will happen to me.” "
5c77a37149f0eacbf105a995,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/28/arts/television/michael-jackson-leaving-neverland.html,"If the average cultural experience demands the suspension of disbelief, if we oughtn’t think too much about this movie we’re watching, this novel we’re reading, this magic trick being performed right before our eyes, if being entertained means setting aside skepticism, logic and possibly a sense of morality, then what a magic trick we had in Michael Jackson. He lived in defiance of physics and race and gender, and we just kind of lived with that. We ate it up. Just the odyssey of his nose from bulb to nub seemed somehow like a people’s journey. For so long, so much about Michael Jackson won our awe, our pity, our bewilderment, our identification, our belief that he was a metaphor, an allegory, a beacon, a caveat — for, of, about America. You need to do a lot of looking at him to feel this way. You also need to do a lot of looking the other way. But, eventually, all the suspension reaches a logical end. You run out of hooks to hang things on. There’s a moment in “Leaving Neverland,” Dan Reed’s documentary about Jackson’s alleged pedophilia, where I simply ran out of hooks. The movie devotes itself to two men, Wade Robson and James Safechuck, who claim, in separate accounts, that Jackson sexually abused them for years, from boyhood into adolescence. [Michael Jackson’s history of sexual abuse accusations.] And of all the allegations, the moment that really got me is the ring. Now, this is 90 minutes into a four-hour movie, which HBO is showing in two parts starting Sunday, and I’ve learned how Jackson has ingratiated himself into two families, starting around 1987 or ’88, after the release of his album “Bad,” during his world tour. I’ve heard a recording of a mock interview Jackson does with Safechuck, a solidly middle-class Southern California boy, in which Jackson says the best part of a trip to Hawaii that he arranged for the boy and his mom was “being with James Safechuck.” I’ve stared at a lingering shot of a photograph of Jackson, who would have been around 30 and Safechuck who was about 9 or 10, and Jackson is beaming in sunglasses and a military jacket, flashing a peace sign, and James, in a too-big baseball cap, is turning to the camera, looking alarmingly ruminative for someone whose life should be rumination-free. By the time you get to the ring, I’ve already heard how Jackson lured Safechuck into sex, by masturbation (James, again, is about 10), and how the closer he got to James on tour, the farther the parents’ hotel room would get from their son’s. The way Safechuck remembers it, there was so much sex, and he says Jackson told him that if anybody found out about it, their lives would be over. I’ve heard about Michael buying the Neverland complex in Santa Barbara County, Calif., (mansion, amusement park, zoo!) and the elaborate system of doors and bells to alert Jackson of any encroachment on the lair in which some of the abuse supposedly occurred. I’ve seen Wade Robson, a doll-faced Michael Jackson impersonator from Brisbane, Australia, say he was 7 when Michael began abusing him, describing a grim scenario in which he was naked on all fours at the edge of the bed, poised — trapped — between his idol, who was masturbating to him, and a cutout of Peter Pan. I’ve heard all of this — and a distressing deal more — by the time the documentary gets to the part where Jackson allegedly takes Safechuck shopping for a ring. But there’s something about the way the filmmakers reserve this scene for the back end of Part 1 that ices your bones, something about the way an adult Safechuck doesn’t seem to want to go back there. But here he is, talking in a TV documentary about the vows he says that he and Jackson exchanged. Here he is, forlorn, holding the ring that he’s kept, all this time, in a handsome box. The story of the ring and the vows feels as graphic as the memories of masturbation and French kissing and nipple tweaking. If you happen to be the sort of person who’d try to balance, say, the multiple counts of child molestation Jackson was charged with in 2003 and acquitted of later with extenuating details from Jackson’s biography (Wasn’t he abused and too famous too soon and prematurely sexualized? He never had a childhood! He’s still a child!), if you partook in the steady diet of fluffy news stories about Jackson and some little boy (often identified as “Jackson’s friend”) and thought mostly that they were cute or banal and that Jackson just related to kids as kids — like, platonically — if you thought that he couldn’t know there was a real difference between adult passion and child’s play, then perhaps you’ll find Safechuck’s memory of the ring particularly shattering. I did. It’s so private and wrong, not just to us but clearly to Jackson, who makes up a story at the jewelry store that the ring is for a woman, even though Safechuck is there by his side. He knew. I’m staring at the coat rack looking for somewhere to suspend more disbelief, and there’s no more room. I have to hold this.  “LEAVING NEVERLAND” is long but delicately, patiently done — and so quiet; you can practically hear yourself listening. It’s not a feat of investigative journalism so much as an act of bearing witness. Reed sits, individually, with Safechuck and his mother, Stephanie, and with Robson and his mother, Joy, and his siblings, Chantal and Shane. It doesn’t try to make cultural or political sense of the allegations. It’s not a masterpiece saga about fame, race, gender, sexuality and the legal system; it’s not “M.J.: Made in America.” (For a long view, there’s “On Michael Jackson,” Margo Jefferson’s pungent, essential critical X-ray from 2006.) “Leaving Neverland” is about one man’s possible contribution to the ruin of two families and the anguish that still disturbs them and, in some way, how that ruin and anguish should disturb us. The movie presents Jackson almost entirely from the two families’ points of view, in photographs, answering machine messages and a montage of lovey-dovey faxes he sent to his “little one,” which is what Wade remembers Jackson calling him. He even remembers the lullaby Jackson built around the phrase. The movie recreates for us the haze Jackson cast over them. Its only moments of disputation arrive in the form of television, from, say, Jackson’s defense lawyers during the 2004-5 trial, and, in 1993, from Jackson himself, in a recorded statement against molestation charges brought by the father of Jordan Chandler. (It was nationally broadcast, as news.) Reed appears to have encouraged everyone in the movie to try to be in the original moment as best they can. For James, Wade and the rest of the on-camera participants (Wade’s grandmother is here, too, as are, in Part 2, both men’s wives), they seem happy enough in the early telling, when everyone’s a little star-struck. So the movie has a real emotional arc — as well as an abundance of orchestral strings and too many handsome drone shots. The tears don’t come until well into hour four. James, though, appears to be reliving it all. He winces, cringes and grimaces; he does a lot of nervous neck scratching. It’s here that I should offer the Jackson estate’s disclaimer. It vehemently denies what James and Wade allege, and is suing HBO for $100 million. The movie breaches a nondisparagement clause in a contract with Jackson from the early 1990s, according to the suit. Around 1993, James and Wade told the authorities that Jackson didn’t molest them; and Wade testified in court on Jackson’s behalf in 2005. Several years ago, both men filed lawsuits against the estate that were dismissed because of statutes of limitations. And their suits are now under appeal. Fatherhood and, presumably, therapy have encouraged both men to reverse their stories, acknowledge what they believe happened to them and tell their families that they lied about not being abused. This is a strategy that puts a lot of faith in the accusers and obviates the possibility of counterargument. Much is asserted and nothing’s proven, and yet you do come to understand how a mix of showbiz and fandom brought so many boys into Jackson’s life. James starred in a 1986 Pepsi commercial with him. Wade’s uncannily sharp impersonation wins him some nights onstage during the “Bad” tour. Both Stephanie and Joy, the mothers, seem proud to have raised sons so appealing to the planet’s most worshiped person. He tells the Safechucks how lonely he is. And so, in an alarming throwaway detail, the family starts disguising Jackson in order to sneak him out of Hayvenhurst, his pre-Neverland estate, and into their normal, suburban house. It’s like he actually was E.T. At the Safechucks, Jackson could be a regular, what exactly, kid? We do see Polaroids of him sans make up, doing funny faces, looking guilelessly happy, so yeah, sure: a kid.  HAVING STEPHANIE AND JOY speak here as much as they do is a relief for any number of reasons. But let’s just focus on two. First, they’ve had some time to process all of this. They’re lucid. Jackson’s trial, conducted on behalf of a 13-year-old, Gavin Arvizo, featured testimony from Janet Arvizo, the boy’s mother, who spent five days on the stand and, by most accounts, was a terrible witness for her son. She claimed Jackson imprisoned her family, and yet she was allegedly free to leave Neverland to pamper herself? She snapped her fingers at the jury. The defense claimed she committed welfare fraud, for which she was later prosecuted. So we shifted the blame. What’s wrong with her? The parents of any kid who passed through Neverland were more convenient to indict. How could you let your child sleep in an adult’s bed? It’s been 15 years, though. Someone should find Janet Arvizo and give her a do-over. That brings me back to how crucial it feels to have Stephanie and Joy speaking in this documentary. (Neither man’s father is interviewed, although, in the case of James’s, we never find out exactly why.) You can’t hear a parent wrestle with this blame question enough, whether it’s being asked in relation to R. Kelly or Michael Jackson, your pastor or your priest: How could they let their child spend that much time with an adult stranger? There’s never a “right” or “good” answer. But faith is usually a factor. And faith entails a suspension of disbelief. The mothers both mention an early limit they set. For Stephanie, it was refusing to let James sleep in Jackson’s room on that trip to Hawaii. And Joy recalls vehemently nixing Jackson’s request to abscond with Wade for a year. But Jackson ultimately wins, anyway. He gets his way, in part, because he could be as manipulative as he could be affectionate, but also because each woman feels, in her way, maternal toward him. He was, both women more or less say, a member of their families. Both families defended him, in the moment, against detractors and accusers. Both boys denied that they were molested — Wade at the trial and to the news media; James to his mother and to a grand jury. So their sons’ falling under his spell — that required some suspension of disbelief. The mothers had fallen, too. We all had. It was so easy to fall.  NOBODY BOUGHT MORE Michael Jackson vinyl LPs than we did of “Thriller.” The euphoria for anything associated with that album was cross-racial and intergenerational. Upon visiting anybody’s house, I’d ask if they had a copy. If the answer was “no,” I’d turn into a 1980s sitcom kid and say something like, “What is your problem?” (I would have been 7, 8 or 9.) If the answer was “yes,” I’d ask to play it, and while it was on, I’d lie on the floor and take long drags on the album’s inside photo: Jackson, in a white suit, lying on his side, one leg bent, looking at us. On the knee of his bent leg is a tiger — a tiger cub. I stared with deep longing. He was so pretty, with his absurd curls and isosceles triangle of a nose and creamy brown face. I’m calling it a photo when, really, it was a centerfold. But what did I want from that picture? What did I want from Jackson? Friendship? A handshake? A souvenir? A hug? Pictures and TV footage of Jackson and other boys were easy enough to come across — him and Emmanuel Lewis, him and Alfonso Ribeiro, him and Sean Lennon (none of whom have accused him of any abuse), him and E.T., him and the boy I now know is James Safechuck. There were so many of him and James. Google didn’t make these images simple to find. Magazines did. Teen magazines. I wanted a picture, too. I wanted the warmth and surprise and serious, only-us closeness in some of those images, although James never looks entirely happy in many of them. The seriousness I identified in a lot of the boys’ faces is what adult-me would now call stress. At the time, I wanted my friends to see Michael Jackson whisking me out of airports and into limousines. I didn’t do an imitation of him or anything, and I never begged my mother to take me to see him. She didn’t have money for that. MTV and “Entertainment Tonight” and the stray issue of Right On! would have to do. But what if I did beg and begged because I was really good at being Michael Jackson? Would that have made a difference? Would she have sacrificed our little family to make my 7-year-old’s dream come true? Ideally, a parent is a backstop against innocent fervor; against foolish, zealous choices and blissful ignorance. So I have to believe that my mother would have saved me from the hazards of my desire. That was her job. But that’s what adult Wade and James think their mothers’ job should have been, too. What’s still eating each woman up, toward the end of “Leaving Neverland,” is that neither woman disagrees. It’s entirely possible that we’ve spent the last 26 years preparing for a moment like this — for somebody to lay it all out, graphically, frankly; for somebody to tell us a story, their story. For a long time, the chief teller of any such story was Jackson himself. He would install his sense of persecution into music videos, like the one for “Leave Me Alone,” from 1989, the finale of “Black or White,” from 1991, and “Ghosts,” from 1997, into songs like “Why You Wanna Trip on Me?” (1991), “Scream” (1995) and “They Don’t Care About Us” (1996). Very good songs, mostly about his tribulations as a so-called weirdo (the tabloids named him Wacko Jacko) and, especially, as a black man. He tried, in highly rated television interviews, to let us see him as wounded and vulnerable and, well, normal. In 1993, he let Oprah Winfrey grill him (about the boys, but also about his altered appearance). He would let Martin Bashir do an occasionally pseudo-vérité version of the same, in a roving two-hour, 2003 TV documentary (“Living With Michael Jackson”) that exposes him as being helpless against himself. (There’s a long, astounding passage, for instance, in which Jackson leads a caravan of children on a Neverland excursion, and he seems taxed by such an overwhelming — and overwhelmingly absurd — babysitting assignment. Yet he’s able to bring himself to have one of his park’s homemade snow cones, anyway. It’s like the parody of Jackson’s hapless eccentricity you can see in Harmony Korine’s celebrity-impersonator film, “Mister Lonely,” and in the “Teddy Perkins” episode of FX’s “Atlanta.”) Then, after his arraignment in 2004, Jackson even danced, for appreciative fans, atop a car. Five years later he was dead. The story was that Jackson never molested anybody. And we stuck to it, and it stuck to him. And the question now, of course, is what do we do? It’s the question of our #MeToo times: If we believe the accusers (and I believe Wade and James), what do we do with the art? With Jackson, what can we do? Wade became a successful choreographer who’s made a career out of teaching his version of Jackson’s hydraulic bounces, whips, and stutters to Britney Spears, ‘N Sync, Cirque du Soleil and rooms full of aspiring dancers. “Look Back at It,” the big single from A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie’s No. 1 album from January, is built out of two Jackson hits. Michael Jackson’s music isn’t a meal. It’s more elemental than that. It’s the salt, pepper, olive oil and butter. His music is how you start. And the music made from that — that music is everywhere, too. Where would the cancellation begin? Jackson provided us an early occasion to ask the question about the art without ever realizing it was being asked. We simply lived with it, with the possibility of his guilt, and the many compartments we make to contain everything he was: the conscientious enthusiasm for and the comedy of him, the tragedy he so obviously represents. Perhaps we can live it because it’s not unreasonable to wonder whether he was living with the contradictions himself. There is something about the way Jackson morphed from pretty to disfigured, closer to Joseph Merrick, the medical case study whose “elephant man” bones Jackson swore he never tried to buy. The morphing could have been a result of the pigmentation ailment, vitiligo, that he told Winfrey he suffered from. But what if all of that change he so notoriously underwent, all the damage he seemed to wear on his body, all the creatures his videos turned him into (werewolves, zombies, a panther, a skeleton), what if his outward self became some semiconscious manifestation of a monster that lurked within?

The owner, MaryAnn Rolle, 55, was featured in the Netflix documentary “Fyre: The Greatest Party That Never Happened,” one of two documentaries released this month that chronicle the 2017 music festival disaster, which left attendees stranded without food or drinking water and sleeping on beaches in makeshift tents. The other new film is Hulu’s “Fyre Fraud,” which also takes a critical look at the festival and its organizers. Well-heeled festivalgoers were cheated out of tickets costing hundreds or thousands of dollars, and local islanders were not paid for their services in building the infrastructure for the festival on Great Exuma in the Bahamas. In the Netflix documentary, Ms. Rolle explains that she spent $50,000 of her savings and received no compensation from festival organizers. In May 2017, she told The New York Times that she was owed $134,000 by festival organizers. She said her credit had been ruined. [Read our article from 2017 taking stock of the wreckage of the Fyre Festival.] Ms. Rolle catered 1,000 meals per day from her Exuma Point Beach Bar and Grill in April 2017, delivering food to Coco Plum Beach and Rokers Point, where the festival’s main events were scheduled to take place, according to the GoFundMe campaign, which Ms. Rolle and her husband started. Festival organizers visited her restaurant and stayed at the Exuma Point Beach Resort. “Lots of people I know weren’t paid,” Ms. Rolle said in an interview on Tuesday. After the festival, she added, “we couldn’t find the organizers. No one answered their phones. Nothing was done for us, not until now.” The festival was scheduled for two weekends starting in late April 2017 and was promoted by the rapper Ja Rule. It was hyped by some of Instagram’s best known influencers, including the models Kendall Jenner and Bella Hadid. Ultimately the event was canceled. The festival’s organizer, Billy McFarland, was sued and charged with defrauding investors. In October, the entrepreneur was sentenced to six years in federal prison. The festival’s promotional videos displayed the Bahamas’ white sandy beaches and featured models in bikinis lounging on sailboats and swimming along the island’s azure shore. But when festivalgoers arrived on Great Exuma — the organizers’ last-minute choice — the staff was woefully unprepared. Headliner bands like Blink-182 had canceled. Monsoon-like rains had soaked the tents where people were supposed to camp. Some guests, who had been promised meals by star chefs, were served sliced cheese on bread. The campaign was Ms. Rolle’s last appeal for help because she, like other island business owners and workers who provided services to festival organizers, was left empty-handed. GoFundMe verified the campaign and Ms. Rolle posted a thank-you note on Facebook. In her interview, she offered this advice: “Be mindful of strangers.” She said she had participated in the Netflix documentary because she wanted to tell the world what happened to her island community. “People have responded well,” she said. “What a wonderful world we live in where people are so generous.” Her beachfront restaurant is on the northern end of Great Exuma, where Ms. Rolle and her husband, Elvis, serve an island buffet with fresh fish, ribs, Bahamian macaroni and cheese and what she described as Mr. Rolle’s favorite “punch cocktail.” This week, Ja Rule posted an apology to Ms. Rolle on Instagram, writing, “MaryAnne Rolle we’ve never met but I’m devastated that something that was meant to be amazing, turn out to be such a disaster and hurt so many ppl.” Ms. Rolle said she did not know if he had donated money to her campaign.

5c53495c3a125f5075c075e1,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/nyregion/vodka-russia-museum-staten-island.html,"[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] Upon arrival at the Booze History Museum in Staten Island, visitors are treated to what Lev Mezhburd, the museum’s founder, director, curator and tour guide, calls a “disinfection.” “The items in the museum are very sensitive,” Mr. Mezhburd said. “To go in there, you have to get rid of the microbes that live on us.” This is how Mr. Mezhburd’s cleansing process works: Wielding a fire extinguisher, he instructs his visitors to open their mouths and say, “Ah.” He then sprays Russian Standard vodka into their mouths. More drinks follow from a series of other visual gags, including an IV drip bag, a radio and a pair of binoculars, all of which conceal vodka. At the start of a recent tour, Mr. Mezhburd, 69, leaned into his bar like a professor resting on a lectern. He came up with a poetic association for each vessel in his disinfection collection. While pouring vodka from a light bulb, for example, he recited a poem about love and light by the Russian Symbolist writer Innokenty Annensky. In case you haven’t picked up on this yet, Mr. Mezhburd believes vodka ought to be celebrated, not vilified. “When you’re talking about alcohol, it’s always just drunken driving or breaking up families,” he said. “Nobody talks about how many people are getting relaxation, how many people are getting enjoyment from drinking alcohol, how many people are getting together because of alcohol.” The museum takes up about 500 square feet in two rooms of Mr. Mezhburd’s home in Grant City, on the East Shore of Staten Island. Since moving there in 1998, he has collected over 1,000 artifacts. The basement is a jumble of signs and statuettes. The bar is plastered with hundreds of different Russian liquor labels. A gallery upstairs is more orderly, with 10 glass cases of booze-related bric-a-brac. Mr. Mezhburd hasn’t done much to publicize his museum, but he said he would consider requests to visit sent through Facebook. Usually his guests have heard about the tours, which occur roughly every month, through word of mouth. They tend to be people like Mr. Mezhburd: Jewish refugees from the former Soviet Union. Tours are usually conducted in Russian, and they frequently turn into larger celebrations of Jewish and Russian culture, with musical performances and potluck buffets. “This is our tradition,” said one visitor, Olga Komarova, 56, who attended similar events during her youth in the Soviet Union. “The main thing is to create a very warm environment, to socialize, to fit together, to sing together, to share some ideas.” The museum, however, extends far beyond Jewish and Russian drinking culture. Mr. Mezhburd’s gallery features display cases organized geographically. They prompt him to tell stories about Omar Khayyam, the 11th- and 12th-century Persian polymath who exhorted his readers to drink wine, and the eighth-century Chinese poet Li Po. “He never was sober. Never in his life,” Mr. Mezhburd said. “And he was a genius.” Some items on the shelves, such as Prohibition-era licenses to drink for medicinal purposes, have real antiquarian value. But Mr. Mezhburd prefers to focus on kitsch. He proudly describes his figurines of grinning clergymen as “the largest collection in the world of drunk monks.” Other items only look serious. Mr. Mezhburd pulled out a leather-bound book called “How to Develop Courage and Self-Confidence.” “This is how,” Mr. Mezhburd said, opening the book to reveal a hidden cavity holding a bottle of vodka and pouring it into shot glasses. “And now, this is what we will do.” Breaks in the tour offer visitors the opportunity to banter in Russian. One guest, who declined to share her name, quoted the satirist Mikhail Zhvanetsky on why it’s a good idea to drink in the morning: “So the sun comes up quicker.” Igor Primak, a high school math teacher, replied to a toast with an old Russian saying: “The toaster drinks to the dregs!” Toward the end of the tour, Mr. Mezhburd produced the very first item he collected: a ceramic figurine of a man with shabby clothes and a stubbly beard, leaning against a street clock and clutching a bottle of booze. Flip a switch atop the figurine, and the man’s head moves from side to side while he whistles a mournful tune. Mr. Mezhburd declared the drunkard his “soul mate.” After the tour, visitors moved to a second-floor living room for a concert by the singer Elmira Galeeva, who interprets poems by the likes of Osip Mandelstam, American rock standards and songs from a genre of Russian folk known as “bard” music. “The poetry — it was part of our lives,” Mr. Primak said, reminiscing about his Moscow University days. “I used to read, and remember, most of those poems she’s singing. It’s something that I miss right now very much.” Other attendees said they’d come mainly in anticipation of the concert. “The most important thing was Elmira Galeeva,” said Ms. Komarova, a devoted fan of the musician. After the concert and a communal dinner of sour cabbage, chicken liver and other regional staples, Mr. Mezhburd returned to the gallery. Amid some conclusory musings, his wife, Natasha, entered the room. “We’re talking about the philosophy of the museum,” someone explained. “Mm,” Ms. Mezhburd said. “It is drinking. This is the one point. Drink a lot.” "

5c7b82d649f0eacbf105b162,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/03/business/media/leaving-neverland-michael-jackson-estate.html,"Michael Jackson’s damaged reputation began to recover the day he died. The lurid accusations of child molestation that had dogged him for years fell to the background as fans around the world celebrated the entertainer who had gone from pop prodigy to global superstar over a four-decade career. Flash mobs from Stockholm to the Philippines re-enacted his video scenes, and his music sales again broke chart records. Now, nearly 10 years after his death, the dark side of Mr. Jackson’s legend has returned through a documentary that rocked the Sundance Film Festival and is being championed by Oprah Winfrey. In addition to delivering a hit to his mended reputation, the film poses a significant risk to the Jackson estate, which has engineered a thriving posthumous career, including a Broadway-bound jukebox musical. The four-hour documentary, “Leaving Neverland,” to be broadcast on HBO in two parts on Sunday and Monday, focuses on the wrenching testimony of two men, Wade Robson and James Safechuck, who say Mr. Jackson abused them for years, starting when they were young boys. While the accusations are not new, their revival in the #MeToo era, with its momentum of accountability for figures like R. Kelly, Harvey Weinstein and Bill Cosby, gives them new meaning. “There has always been this shadow or cloud about Michael,” said Charles Koppelman, a longtime music executive who once served as a financial adviser to Mr. Jackson. “With this documentary about to be shown to millions and millions of people, and all the notoriety that it’s now getting, I think it will have a detrimental effect to the legacy and the estate.” The estate has already begun its war on “Leaving Neverland.” It issued a series of fiery statements around the time of the film’s Sundance debut in January and has filed a petition in Los Angeles County Superior Court for arbitration, seeking $100 million in damages from HBO. In making its case, the estate — whose beneficiaries are Mr. Jackson’s mother and three children, as well as children’s charities — portrays Mr. Robson and Mr. Safechuck as “serial perjurers” for whom HBO has become “just another tool in their litigation playbook.” The debate over the film is likely to be intense in black communities, where figures like Mr. Jackson and Mr. Kelly have their strongest defenders, said Yaba Blay, a professor at North Carolina Central University whose specialty is black racial and cultural identities. “If you think R. Kelly tore black America apart, this is going to destroy us,” Dr. Blay said. On Monday night, after the conclusion of “Leaving Neverland,” HBO and the Oprah Winfrey Network plan to broadcast Ms. Winfrey’s interview with Mr. Robson, Mr. Safechuck and the film’s director, Dan Reed. In “Leaving Neverland,” Mr. Robson, 36, and Mr. Safechuck, 41, tell parallel stories of being drawn into Mr. Jackson’s inner circle as boys. Mr. Robson met Mr. Jackson on tour in Australia at age 5 and moved to the United States two years later to be near his idol. Mr. Safechuck was 8 when he was cast in a Pepsi commercial and met Mr. Jackson. Both men say Mr. Jackson abused them while charming their families at his 2,600-acre Neverland compound in Los Olivos, Calif. He also warned them to keep their sexual relationship secret, the men say. “He told me if they ever found out what we were doing,” Mr. Robson says in the film, “he and I would go to jail for the rest of our lives.” Complicating the men’s accounts are their histories as Mr. Jackson’s defenders. Both gave sworn testimony at different times denying that any abuse had taken place, and Mr. Robson was the first witness called by Mr. Jackson’s defense team at his 2005 criminal trial on molestation charges involving another boy. Members of the men’s families say in the film that they knew nothing of the alleged abuse at the time, nor suspected any. No corroborating testimony or evidence for their accounts is presented. In the film, the men say the change of heart had to do with their becoming fathers. After Mr. Jackson died at 50 on June 25, 2009, they filed separate lawsuits against the estate, making their accusations of abuse public for the first time. Those cases were thrown out for being filed too late, but remain under appeal. The estate has seized on the men’s past defense of Mr. Jackson to attack their credibility. It also accuses the director, Mr. Reed, whose previous documentaries include “Three Days of Terror: The Charlie Hebdo Attacks” and “The Paedophile Hunter,” of flouting standard journalistic practice by failing to contact the estate for a response. “It is a disgrace,” Howard Weitzman, the estate’s lawyer, wrote in a 10-page public letter to HBO last month. In an interview, Mr. Reed noted that “Leaving Neverland” includes footage of blanket denials from Mr. Jackson and his lawyers, and he argued that the opinions of the estate and Jackson family members are irrelevant. “I do not think that interviewing a member of the Jackson family saying what a nice guy Michael was has any bearing on the credibility of someone who claims that Michael Jackson abused him behind a locked door,” Mr. Reed said. Born in Gary, Ind., Mr. Jackson became famous as the preternaturally talented lead singer of the Jackson 5, whose first four singles on the Motown record label — “I Want You Back,” “ABC,” “The Love You Save” and “I’ll Be There” — went to No. 1 in 1970. Joe Jackson, the boys’ domineering father, controlled the group, and it became part of Michael’s mythos that he never had a normal childhood. With later solo albums like “Off the Wall” and “Thriller,” both produced with Quincy Jones, Mr. Jackson reached superstardom, breaking sales records around the world as the tabloids chronicled his offstage life. In 1993, he was accused of child molestation for the first time. Early the next year, he paid a reported $23 million to settle a civil case. During that time, prosecutors in Los Angeles and Santa Barbara, Calif., built a criminal case against Mr. Jackson, only to drop it when the main accuser — the boy from the civil case — decided against cooperating. Aside from a No. 1 single in 1995, “You Are Not Alone” — written by Mr. Kelly — Mr. Jackson never achieved the level of success he had attained earlier in his career. Criminal charges were brought against him in 2003, when he was accused of using alcohol and pornography to seduce and molest a boy. In 2005, a jury acquitted Mr. Jackson, but his reputation seemed beyond repair. In the trial’s wake, he left Neverland for Bahrain, where he was spotted in shopping malls wearing black robes and veils. After his return to the United States, mired in debt, he made plans for a comeback tour, only to die in a rented mansion in Los Angeles, having succumbed to a combination of drugs provided to him by his personal physician, who was later found guilty of involuntary manslaughter. His estate, led by John G. Branca, Mr. Jackson’s longtime lawyer and deal maker, and John McClain, a music executive, struck an array of lucrative deals, including film and record contracts. It also approved two Jackson-related shows by the dance-theater troupe Cirque du Soleil. One of those, “Michael Jackson: One,” has been a Las Vegas staple since 2013. Since 2009, the estate has brought in more than $2 billion, according to Billboard. Half of that came from the sale of its stakes in major song catalogs: Sony/ATV, which contained more than 200 songs written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, and EMI, whose vast holdings include most Motown hits. A test of Mr. Jackson’s market appeal may be “Don’t Stop ’Til You Get Enough,” the musical produced by the estate and Columbia Live Stage, a division of Sony Pictures. Planned for a 2020 Broadway premiere, it has a highbrow creative team: Lynn Nottage, a two-time Pulitzer Prize winner, is writing the book, and Christopher Wheeldon, a ballet luminary, is the choreographer. Since “Leaving Neverland” made its debut at Sundance, the fate of the musical has caused talk in theater circles. A Chicago tryout run was canceled; producers blamed scheduling conflicts after an actors’ strike. A spokesman for the show said the production remained on schedule. The larger question, said Stacy Wolf, a Princeton theater professor, is whether Ms. Nottage, who is known for her politically charged work, has the freedom to stray from a sanitized account of Mr. Jackson’s life story. The show, which will incorporate Mr. Jackson’s songs, was announced as being based on the period leading up to his “Dangerous” tour of 1992 and 1993 — a tour cut short when allegations of abuse surfaced. “The question is, can she figure out, as a dramatist, how to tell the story she wants to tell, without compromising her politics, and dealing with this very difficult estate?” Ms. Wolf said. Through the show’s spokesman, the producers and Ms. Nottage declined to comment. In its petition for arbitration, the Jackson estate accused HBO of being in breach of a 1992 agreement it had made with the singer to broadcast a concert from Bucharest, Romania. The estate said the contract had contained a nondisparagement clause that HBO was violating with “Leaving Neverland.” The filing — which begins, “Michael Jackson is innocent. Period.” — also targets the credibility of Mr. Robson and Mr. Safechuck. Both men, the filing says, are “pursuing claims against the Jackson estate for hundreds of millions of dollars,” through appeals of their suit. (In response, HBO has said it plans to broadcast “Leaving Neverland” as announced, “despite the desperate lengths taken to undermine the film.”) In the #MeToo era, aggressive statements against accusers may not be effective, said Matthew Hiltzik, whose firm, Hiltzik Strategies, handles crisis management for celebrities and corporations. “It’s understandable that an estate would want to fight back in any way possible because of the unique challenges of trying to refute claims against someone who has been dead for 10 years,” Mr. Hiltzik said. “But it may backfire based on the contents of the documentary and the current climate.” "

Fosse and Verdon collaborated across multiple entertainment mediums, so there are plenty of pieces to choose from. Here are some of the best. [The why and how of Fosse/Verdon dance moves.] Stream it on Vimeo. Many of the moves in “Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)” bear a striking resemblance to this number, which Verdon and two dancers performed on “The Ed Sullivan Show.”  Highlights: The casual head bobs; the high kicks (so many!) done with such ease.

But that’s why it works; Verdon is completely game to lean hard into the playful nature of old-school burlesque as filtered through Fosse’s precise choreography. Highlights: Verdon’s signature, nasally vocals, which are as expressive as her moves; the manic, cartoonish baby steps during the break. Seduction was a common theme in Fosse’s pieces … Stream it on Amazon Prime. The dancer and choreographer Ann Reinking, another collaborator (and romantic partner) of Fosse’s, has described the characterization of the dance hostesses like so: “From the waist up you’re glamorous, you’re wonderful. But from the waist down, you’re tired and your legs are busted and your feet hurt.” You can feel it seep through the dancers’ slinky bodies; much of this number actually involves intense stillness.

Producers said on Monday that the musical, which uses the song catalog of Alanis Morissette to confront such contemporary issues as rape culture and addiction, will open next fall. They did not specify a theater or a date. “Jagged Little Pill” has had one previous production, a sold-out 10-week run last year at the nonprofit American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Mass. Reviewing the show for The New York Times, the critic Jesse Green said it “takes on the good work we are always asking new musicals to do: the work of singing about real things,” but added, “if only it didn’t sing about all of them all at once.” In the Boston Globe, Christopher Muther expressed similar misgivings about the catalog of social issues crammed into the plot, but called it “wildly entertaining” and “wickedly funny in just the right places.” The musical features songs written by Ms. Morissette and Glen Ballard, many of them from the 1995 album that gives the show its title, and a book by Diablo Cody, the Oscar-winning screenwriter for “Juno.” Diane Paulus, who is the artistic director of the A.R.T. and a Tony winner for “Pippin,” is the director. The cast in Cambridge was led by Elizabeth Stanley and featured a showstopping Lauren Patten in a supporting role; the cast for Broadway has not yet been named. The musical, with Vivek J. Tiwary, Arvind Ethan David and Eva Price as lead producers, is expected to be capitalized for up to $14 million, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The producers said that they expect the final cost to be slightly lower. In an interview, the producers said the show is being revised somewhat after its last production. “We were quite happy with the work we did on our original musical, but you can always keep improving, and the changes we have made are many, many little ones that add up to a more streamlined, layered, and deeper show,” Ms. Price said. “The world has continued to change, and that has affected the writing and the direction.” The producers have been working on the show for nearly nine years, largely because of the complexity of hammering out rights agreements for the songs. “We wanted to produce something that was not just another Broadway musical, but was true to the legacy of the record,” Mr. Tiwary said. “We want to be an entertaining musical with messages.” "
5cafa4a749f0eacbf1f830dd,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/arts/music/radiohead-inquest.html,"A Toronto jury on Thursday concluded a coroner’s inquest into the death of a drum technician who died after the roof of a stage collapsed on him before a Radiohead concert in 2012. The technician, Scott Johnson, had been hired for the band’s tour for its album “The King of Limbs.” An hour before a sold-out show in Toronto in June 2012, a rooflike structure came crashing down on crew members, killing Johnson and injuring three other workers who were setting up equipment. The jury proposed 28 nonbinding recommendations to help prevent similar incidents, including the creation of a permanent working group that would establish and update standards and best practices for the live-performance industry. Several other recommendations highlighted the need to improve oversight of safety rules for the construction of temporary stages in Ontario. Radiohead responded to the jury’s conclusion with a statement, saying that the inquest’s verdict of accidental death “feels frustratingly insufficient given that the stage collapse was shown to be preventable.” The group added: “The jury have made sound and practical recommendations to prevent such an accident happening again and to ensure the future safety of show crews and audiences. It’s up to all of us now to make sure that these recommendations are implemented.” In 2013, provincial officials brought charges under the Occupational Health and Safety Act against Live Nation Canada, the concert organizer, and Live Nation Ontario Concerts GP. Other charges were brought against the Toronto-based Optex Staging and Services and a single engineer. The defendants had pleaded not guilty. After several delays, a judge stayed the charges in September 2017 because the case had taken too long. (A 2016 Supreme Court of Canada ruling said cases in provincial court should go to trial within 18 months of charges being brought.) The Ontario coroner’s office began a new public inquest into Johnson’s death on March 25. For more than two weeks, a five-person jury heard testimony from engineers, provincial officials and workers who were present when the stage was being built. Radiohead’s drummer, Philip Selway, and Johnson’s father, Ken, also gave statements. "

The 28-year-old pianist, who was competing against four other finalists, will receive $50,000, a recording contract with Mack Avenue Records, and two years of professional services. The competition’s closing event took place on Saturday at the Hilbert Circle Theater in Indianapolis, capping a 14-month process in which each finalist also had an engagement at an Indianapolis jazz club and participated in an outreach program at a local high school. With his win, Mr. Cohen joins a lineup of nine past awardees that includes Sullivan Fortner, Aaron Parks, Dan Tepfer and Aaron Diehl — who have all attained significant renown since winning. The American Pianists Association holds a competition for young musicians every two years, but it alternates between jazz and classical. Mr. Cohen was a finalist the last time it focused on jazz pianists, in 2015, but he lost to Mr. Fortner. “It’s a great honor,” Mr. Cohen said in an interview on Sunday. “I feel super excited about signing with Mack Avenue. I think my particular musical vision aligns with a lot of the artists,” he added, alluding to the label’s roster of straight-ahead, acoustic jazz musicians. Mr. Cohen has already appeared as a side musician on two Mack Avenue releases, both by the drummer Herlin Riley. He has also made five albums as a bandleader on other labels, including one on which he’s joined by the bass luminary Ron Carter. The conclusion of the 2019 contest stretched across two nights. On Friday, finalists performed two 15-minute sets each at the Jazz Kitchen nightclub, accompanied by a house rhythm section. On Saturday, at the Hilbert, the pianists performed in duet with the famed vocalist Kurt Elling, then with the Buselli-Wallarab Jazz Orchestra. Mr. Cohen and Mr. Elling performed “I Keep Going Back to Joe’s,” a ballad best known from Nat King Cole’s rendition; with the big band, Mr. Cohen played a medley of tunes composed by Fats Waller. "
5c4608ec3a125f5075c0589d,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/21/theater/school-of-rock-jill-valentine.html,"Jill Valentine is pretty sure the kids have a nickname for her: Fun Killer. For nearly four years, Ms. Valentine has been the head guardian of “School of Rock,” which played its last performance on Sunday at the Winter Garden Theater. Guardians care for child actors during rehearsals and before and after performances, making sure they’re fed, watered and rested. Ms. Valentine distributes children’s pain relievers, she runs science flashcards, she confiscates contraband. She doesn’t have children of her own — “I have two cats and a boyfriend, that’s enough!” she said — but 63 have come into and out of her care since she joined “School of Rock” for pre-Broadway rehearsals in 2015. Thirteen children, age about 8 to 13, star in every performance, with four more waiting backstage. Thirty-six alumni joined them for Sunday’s show-closing jam session. Before the Saturday evening performance, Ms. Valentine met me at the show’s rehearsal space, now mostly denuded and bubble wrapped. She talked about the responsibilities of the job, the hectic schedule and why there are no children showmances. Her feelings about the show’s ending were bittersweet, but not so bittersweet that she hadn’t booked a 5 a.m. Miami-bound flight for Monday. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation. What exactly is a guardian? It’s the responsible person for the child actor. We are responsible for their safety, health, well-being from the time that they walk into the stage door until the time they walk out. I will be in two hours before the curtain goes up. Then we pick up the kids about an hour and 15 minutes before curtain. There are 17 of them. It’s a lot. They’ll go upstairs, drop their stuff, do a physical and vocal warm-up in our green room and then we are off to the races — hair calls, costumes, mic check, all that stuff. Once the kids go downstairs for the show, we don’t have any breaks. They’re onstage all the time and we’re backstage. They go upstairs for intermission — quick snack, water break, bathroom break, game of cards. And then right back downstairs again until the end of the show. What’s the popular snack these days? Their tastes are not what you would think of as kid tastes. They like poke bowls. They’re into Maison Kayser. They don’t eat kid food. They’re like very short adults. But if there’s a birthday and we have birthday cake, everyone is in. What do you do to bond with them?  If you ask them real questions about what their life is like and then follow up, they know that you care. We spend 40 hours a week together; that’s an incredible amount of time. They really do become like family. How do you reassure the parents? When we start rehearsal, I do a parent orientation. I have an eight-page packet that I send out. Like, so your child’s in a Broadway show, here’s what you need to know, a step-by-step guide. They have my cellphone number. I get texts, I get phone calls, I get emails. What emergencies have you handled? We’ve certainly had bloody noses, we’ve stood offstage with trash cans. We say, if you think you’re going to be sick, please walk off the stage, we will be there with a trash can for you. I have to ask the kids, do you need to stop? Can you finish the show? It has to be the actors’ choice. Do you handle a lot of stage fright? There’s usually a little bit of nervousness for the first or even the second show. We try really hard to encourage parents to maybe hold off on inviting everyone you’ve ever met to see your child perform for like a week. Do you have ways of celebrating when someone leaves the show? We do. We call it graduation. The audience gets to cheer and afterward we do a graduation ceremony, everybody sings “Pomp and Circumstance.” They get a little mortar board, they sign the back of the set, they get a little diploma. Are they sad to leave? Yeah, they are. And sometimes it’s really hard to watch them go. It’s also pretty great. We have a lot of alumni come back. They can come in and go to warm up and sit with the other kids. They’re all coming back tomorrow! So many of them! It’s going to be nuts. [Check out our Culture Calendar here.] So Fun Killer, how do you kill the fun? If we’re having a tough day I’m one who comes in and is like: “What are you, crazy? We’re doing a show. You cannot throw a football backstage. You just can’t.” I’ve definitely taken away a basketball, a skateboard. Do you have a favorite group of kids? I try very hard not to have favorites. Kids know and it doesn’t really suit what we’re trying to teach them, which is professionalism. Have there been any kid showmances? Not really. Our age group tends to be before that kicks in. Mostly boys and girls have cooties. Plus we have no time! What’s the hardest part of the job? I think the hardest thing is to be consistent. It doesn’t matter how tired I am. Or if it’s Sunday night of a five-show weekend and all I want to do is go home. Because when the stuff hits the fan [Ms. Valentine used a more colorful term], I need those kids to turn to me and to trust me. Is it sad to leave the show? A little. It’s my sixth Broadway show. I know what this is. I’m O.K. But in packing up the office, I’m going through paperwork and old schedules, drawings the kids have made. Which is like, Oh, right. Remember that? We’ve done so much! If anything, my overwhelming feeling is not sorrow, but pride. "

It will make possible a major upgrade, in the form of a 35,000-to-45,000-square-foot space, to be named the Cooperman Family Education and Community Center. The hope, Mr. Schreiber said, is to break ground on the building sometime between July 2020 and June 2021. “This new education and community center, designed to serve citizens from all corners of our city, will provide life-enhancing programs and activities for everyone from babies to seniors,” Ras Baraka, the mayor, said in a statement. “We’re grateful to the Cooperman Family for their thoughtful philanthropy.” The construction of the center will come with increased programming for NJPAC, which saw 600,000 visitors during its 2018 season, and served 100,000 students and families through its arts education programs. Artist training will continue for students in film, theater, poetry, jazz, dance and hip-hop, as will free community engagement programs in a variety of genres. Mr. Schreiber said the new center will also allow NJPAC to build more extensive programming for older adults. “We’re also thinking about how wellness can be integrated into this,” Mr. Schreiber said. “That means nutrition, mindfulness, culinary arts.” The center is also looking to integrate counseling programs into its model for students and families. The expansion will also allow the center to offer space to other local programs for rehearsals, performances, meetings and exhibitions. “Often nonprofits tell us they need space to create work as much as they need money,” Mr. Schreiber said. The first step will be series of community meetings about the center’s development. “We’re going to hold them in all five wards of Newark, and we’ll talk about what’s happening now, what’s working and what’s missing, and how this can be additive,” Mr. Schreiber said. “We’re going to be good listeners.” "
5ca1029e49f0eacbf1f7afe4,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/31/arts/music/met-opera-clemenza-di-tito-review.html,"“La Clemenza di Tito,” Mozart’s least-loved opera, returned to the Metropolitan Opera on Saturday evening to an auditorium yawning with empty seats. The cast wasn’t to blame. With the fiercely empathetic mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato as Sesto, a trouser role she has made her own, this revival made a strong case for the work’s rehabilitation on musical grounds. But by recycling the airless Rococo-dress staging by Jean-Pierre Ponnelle from 1984, the Met perpetuates the prejudice against the work as dramatically irrelevant. His take is so short on ideas that it might be more honest to let the singers wear their own clothes and call it a concert production. Mozart wrote “Clemenza” on commission in 1791 for the coronation of Leopold II as king of Bohemia. In the opera, a Roman emperor forgives his friend, who had been compelled by love to conspire against him. The 1734 libretto, by Pietro Metastasio, already felt sclerotic by Mozart’s theatrical standards; he tweaked it to create ensemble numbers amid the sequence of dry recitatives and pomp-and-firework arias that made up a traditional opera seria. Even so, an Austrian nobleman who attended the premiere called it “most boring” in his diary. The new queen, Maria Luisa, struggled to stay awake. Reports that she called the opera “una porcheria tedesca” — German pigswill — may be apocryphal. Or perhaps she bristled at the work’s political message, which presented clemency and tolerance as a ruler’s supreme virtues just weeks after Marie Antoinette had been arrested midflight and forcibly returned to Paris amid jeering crowds. After all, the production Leopold and Maria Luisa watched in Prague was in contemporary dress. On Saturday, the singers struggled to convey a unified dramatic concept amid 18th-century wigs and pastel Roman columns. The tenor Matthew Polenzani sang the title role of the ruler unhappy inside his power bubble with a plush, slightly woolly tone and plain-spoken phrasing. In one scene he confronts Sesto, who has confessed to the plot on his life without letting on that the vengeful Vitellia (the voluble soprano Elza van den Heever) manipulated him into it. Mr. Polenzani’s acting seemed to suggest a homoerotic bond between Tito and Sesto. That’s an intriguing idea, but would require a new staging designed around it; the opera shows Sesto being very much in love with Vitellia. And when Ms. DiDonato portrays that passion, she does so wholeheartedly, with body and voice. In scenes with Ms. van den Heever, her sound was flickering, brilliant and complex, its warmth tempered with the touch of vinegar Mr. DiDonato injects when singing the part of a man. In the dazzling aria “Parto, parto,” Ms. DiDonato vividly rendered the moment at which her character, buffeted by hope and despair, snaps into action and commits to the conspiracy plan. The subtle electric charge that went through the house at that moment was yet another reminder that she is one the great singer-actors of our time. Ms. van den Heever’s acting is more rigidly histrionic, but with her flame-drawn singing, she brought a welcome over-the-topness to a work filled with conflicted-but-noble characters. A source of pure joy and light was Ying Fang as Servilia, sung with a soprano of succulent sweetness. Her character is mostly a foil for Tito’s generosity: He wants to marry her but desists instantly when she tells him she is in love with another man, Annio. But something about Servilia’s quiet integrity and courage clearly endeared her to Mozart, because he wrote two of the opera’s loveliest arias for her. As Annio — another trouser role — the mezzo-soprano Emily D’Angelo conveyed youthful tension with a high-voltage, nervy tone. The bass-baritone Christian Van Horn was decorous and steely as Publio, the guardian of protocol. In the pit, Lothar Koenigs drew brisk and streamlined playing from the Met Orchestra — which included 22 players who had soldiered through the five-hour matinee of Wagner’s “Die Walküre” earlier in the day. Their commitment to reviving the musical riches of “Clemenza” was inspiring. The Met should invest in a production to match it. "

But someone will be onstage discussing him. “King James,” a play by Rajiv Joseph, will be making its world premiere at the Steppenwolf Theater in Chicago in May 2020, the Steppenwolf announced on Thursday as part of its 2019- 2020 lineup announcement, a diverse slate with a particular emphasis on people of color. Anna D. Shapiro will direct. The show will depict life in Cleveland after 2016, when the Cavaliers won the championship, as two friends “spar in a verbal game of one-on-one, revealing past secrets, present truths, and a possible future after ‘The King’ has left the building.” (Last summer, Mr. James left Cleveland for the Los Angeles Lakers.) The play will also be produced on the West Coast in Los Angeles, where Mr. James currently resides, as part of the Center Theatre Group’s 2020- 2021 season. Other highlights from Steppenwolf’s upcoming season include the debut of “Lindiwe,” a musical featuring works by the famed South African group Ladysmith Black Mambazo (Nov. 7-Dec. 29, 2019). Tracy Letts, a Tony Award and Pulitzer Prize winner, will bring his play “Bug” to Chicago, which is slated to be directed by David Cromer (“The Band’s Visit”) and star Carrie Coon (“Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?”, HBO’s “The Leftovers”) and Namir Smallwood (Jan. 23-March 8, 2020). Lauren Yee’s “The Great Leap,” which last year was at the Atlantic Theater Company’s Stage II in New York, will make a leap of its own to Chicago. Another play about basketball, the work tracks an American team’s trek to Beijing in the late-1980s (Sept. 5-Oct. 20, 2019). “The Brothers Size,” an early work of Tarell Alvin McCraney, is headlining Steppenwolf’s young adult programming (Oct. 2–19, 2019), as is the world premiere of “I Am Not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter,” an adaptation of the book by Erika L.

5c76fe1d49f0eacbf105a82f,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/27/fashion/weddings/taylor-swift-surprises-a-couple-again.html,"The wave of attention that accompanied Taylor Swift’s surprise performance at the Los Angeles engagement party of Alexander Goldschmidt and Ross Girard on Feb. 23 was nothing Mr. Goldschmidt didn’t see coming. “I knew this was going to be a moment people talked about — I just didn’t think the news cycle would pick it up this hard because it was Oscars weekend,” said Mr. Goldschmidt, who works in social media marketing for TV shows through the company Digital Media Management. But it’s possible Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper’s swoony Academy Awards duet only fueled interest in love stories: Since Ms. Swift serenaded Mr. Girard with her song “King of My Heart” at the Sycamore Tavern hours after Mr. Goldschmidt proposed, news of the engagement party crasher reached outlets as far as Germany and Australia. “I didn’t think about the fact that Taylor had never performed the song acoustically, and that people might have responded because we’re a gay couple,” said Mr. Goldschmidt, 30, who has been dating Mr. Girard, 32, since 2016. “But that may have added to it.” The series of events that found Ms. Swift, in a ponytail and a blue floral dress, strapping on her guitar for a flabbergasted party of 65 stretches back to 2014, when Mr. Goldschmidt met Ms. Swift backstage at an Ed Sheeran concert. “I had tweeted — and I didn’t even tag either of them — that I wanted an Ed Sheeran and Taylor Swift duets album,” Mr. Goldschmidt said. “Out of nowhere, Ed responded to me. We ended up DM-ing, and he told me he’d get me backstage at his next concert. When I went backstage he grabbed me a beer and said, ‘Have you ever met Taylor?’” Two weeks and many selfies later, Ms. Swift and Mr. Goldschmidt met in Los Angeles on the set of her “Shake It Off” video; Mr. Goldschmidt is among that video’s dancers. They kept in touch on social media. In July 2015, when Mr. Goldschmidt was single and miserable, Ms. Swift shared some encouraging words Lady Gaga had sent her via Twitter. “Life is friends, family, and love! We all see that in you, your prince charming will come!” Lady Gaga’s post said. Mr. Goldschmidt shared the tweet on Instagram. “I have been given my instructions. I leave my love life in Lady Gaga’s magical hands. My Prince Charming will come,” he wrote. He started dating Mr. Girard, who is the head of productions at Campfire, a television and film production company, not long after. In 2018, backstage at Ms. Swift’s “Reputation” show at the Rose Bowl, he was ready to introduce Mr. Girard to his famous friend. But he didn’t have to. “She came up and said ‘Hey Ross!’,” Mr. Girard said. “She had been reading all of Alex’s posts. She didn’t even need to ask my name.” Mr. Goldschmidt and Mr. Girard don’t consider “King of My Heart” their song, the one they fell in love to. Instead, “it was a song that had always resonated with me and my own story, because it’s about someone who has become content with being alone and getting to that place of self love, and then suddenly having someone come into their life and rock their world,” Mr. Goldschmidt said. He didn’t beg, cajole or even ask Ms. Swift to sing it at the surprise engagement party he had been planning for months. Instead, Ms. Swift’s publicist, Tree Paine, reached out to him.  “I had sent Taylor an email thanking her for all of the years of advice on love and on life and for that song, which had sunk into my heart,” Mr. Goldschmidt said. Two weeks later, Ms. Paine called to say Ms. Swift would like to be part of their engagement day. It isn’t the first time Ms. Swift has surprised a couple. In June 2016, she crashed the wedding of Max Singer and Kenya Smith, and about 100 guests in Long Beach Island, N.J., before sitting down at a piano and performing her hit song “Blank Space.” Other couples have been sent champagne and she’s shown up at bridal showers. Mr. Goldschmidt was driving to work in late January when he got the call. “Basically, I lost feeling in my face and I had to pull my car over,” he said. “I cried a little bit, I screamed a little bit, then I tried to restore the feeling to my face.” He kept the news a secret from almost everyone, including his parents and Mr. Girard’s parents, who were flying in from the East Coast for the party. The only person he told was a friend who works as an event planner for the restaurant group that owns the Sycamore Tavern. “I had to tell him so we could figure out the service doors so I’d have a place to hide her,” Mr. Goldschmidt said. Challenges to keeping a poker face presented themselves to the last minute: “I was down on one knee on top of a mountain proposing to Ross, and my phone was going off with calls from her security team about sweeps they needed to do of the venue.” At the start of the viral video from the party, Mr. Goldschmidt and Mr. Girard stand arm in arm, holding champagne glasses. Mr. Goldschmidt says, “There is one secret I didn’t trust any of you with. I would like to welcome my friend Taylor.” As Ms. Swift makes her way into the room, gasps erupt. Mr. Girard said he was too preoccupied thinking of how he was going to thank his loved ones for coming to the party for it to register that he was about to be sung to by one of the world’s most popular performers. And Mr. Goldschmidt’s father thought that his son was introducing a drag queen version of Ms. Swift. “I had to explain to him, I live in Hollywood, not West Hollywood, Dad,” he said. Mr. Goldschmidt and Mr. Girard have not yet picked a wedding date. But they know they’ve set a high bar for reception entertainment. “We’re being told it’s going to be hard to live up to this,” Mr. Goldschmidt said. "

In Saint-Saëns’s “Samson et Dalila,” which returned to the Met on Wednesday for five performances after opening the season with a different cast in September, Ms. Rachvelishvili begins with a veritable whisper. Her voice a sheet of gauze, individual notes fine and faint as threads, she sometimes seems to be barely singing at all in the aria “Printemps qui commence.” Her seduction — at first, that is — is about making us, like Samson, lean in closer, rather than roaring out a stereotypical smolder. She brings down the first act curtain with coy quiet. [Read how Ms. Rachvelishvili has taken the opera world by storm.] But her commanding first notes just after intermission show that that pale, girlish priestess was just a ruse. Ms. Rachvelishvili’s voice expands as her Dalila does: to a full-throated, lava-blooded lover unsure of whether she believes her own lies in the second act, then to an agonized, regretful woman in the third. Elina Garanca, who played the role on opening night, was cool and immaculately elegant. Ms. Rachvelishvili is earthier, in voice and presence, and more exhilarating. Her Dalila is an unsettled, unsettling creation, changeable and realistically varied — a character closer to Carmen than I’d previously thought, voiced with ominous languor and sudden fearlessness. She had the unusual distinction of ensnaring two tenors on Wednesday. Aleksandrs Antonenko began the performance as Samson, but labored and coughed his way through the first act. Before the second, an announcement was made that he was struggling with a cold and would be replaced by Gregory Kunde. Mr. Kunde is hardly an unknown. Singing now for 40 years, he is a noted leading man in Europe, in heroic roles like Radamès (“Aida”) and Calaf (“Turandot”). Once a bel canto specialist, he’s the rare tenor with both Rossini’s and Verdi’s very different versions of “Otello” in his repertory. But at 65 — that’s no typo — he hadn’t sung at the Met since 2007, and rarely before that. There’s always reason to fear a rushed return to its daunting stage, but Mr. Kunde had a beautiful success as Samson, singing with clear, strong, focused tone and acting with moving reserve. In cleaner, more robust voice than many tenors a generation younger (even on their healthy days), he rose by the end to genuine nobility, passionate without strain. His love scene with Ms. Rachvelishvili was quietly combustible, an achievement considering they had no opportunity to rehearse together. (The Met said on Thursday that Mr. Kunde would take over Mr. Antonenko’s remaining three performances, too; as scheduled, Kristian Benedikt will sing Samson on March 28.) For low voices, this revival benefits from playing alongside the rollout of Wagner’s “Ring” cycle at the Met. Tomasz Konieczny (an acclaimed Alberich) and Günther Groissböck (Fasolt and Hunding) moonlight memorably with small yet meaty parts in “Samson,” Mr. Konieczny as Abimélech and Mr. Groissböck as the Old Hebrew. Along with the conductor Mark Elder, Laurent Naouri is the holdover from opening night, and he still sings the High Priest with restrained relish. Darko Tresnjak’s production has its garish charms; I like gold-tasseled costumes and shiny crowns as much as the next guy, and the massive god statue of the finale is impressive. But the staging feels static and antsy, rather than majestic or truly energetic. For all the nearly-nude gyrations of this Bacchanale, its intensity doesn’t build to boiling. And if you’re going to go the old-Hollywood-spectacle route, as Mr. Tresnjak does, you can’t get away with the pitiful anticlimax of his finale, which dispatches the Temple of Dagon with a little bright light and smoke. After lurid lighting and miles of shiny fabric, I want to see a temple fall down! "
5caba41b49f0eacbf1f81a85,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/08/arts/zadie-smith-dance-alvin-ailey.html,"When I was about 12, the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater came to town and my mother took me to see them. It was a trip for just us two, and I was a little reluctant, suspecting some species of racial uplift, which I felt I could receive far more easily by staying in my room, listening to Monie Love and watching Cameo’s “Word Up” video on repeat. I was suspicious of racial uplift in general. The way it always seemed to point in the same direction, toward the supposed “higher” arts: the theater but not the television, opera singers but not beatboxers, ballet dancers but not body-poppers. No Jamaican mother ever ran into a kid’s bedroom, waving a cassette, crying: “Have you heard ‘Push It’? It’s by some brilliant young ladies from New York!” Yet I couldn’t imagine anything on the legitimate stage meaning as much to me as Salt-N-Pepa’s bump and grind. Off we went — and it was a ravishment. Nothing prepares you for the totality of Alvin Ailey: the aural, visual, physical, spiritual beauty. Up to that point, most high-culture excursions (usually school trips) had felt like sly training for a lifetime of partly satisfying adult aesthetic experiences: nice singing but absurd story, or good acting but incomprehensible 400-year-old text, and so on. To be permitted to hear the thickly stacked, honeyed gospel of “Wade in the Water,” while simultaneously watching those idealized, muscular arms — in every shade of brown — slowly rise and assume the shape of so many ancient amphoras! Heaven. And then below the regality and poise of the upper body, beneath the waist, there continued the bastardized bump and grind from MTV, coming full circle to meet its call-and-response West African roots. Everywhere you looked: sensory pleasure. In place of the saccharine costume confections of “The Nutcracker,” here were down-home, flowing, church-white gowns, stunning against so much shining dark skin, and redolent of the American South, a dream place I’d visited only in books and song. It dawned on me that I was watching neither high nor low culture but rather a wholly unified thing. Ailey’s all-encompassing vocabulary included the athletes from the running tracks and the fly-girls from the videos, the swaying of church ministers and the hip-switching of Caribbean dance hall and carnival. A diaspora of movement, in short. All fingertips stretched to the sky, all leaps seemed weightless, the whole logic tended upward. “Didn’t my Lord deliver Daniel well?” asked the gospel choir, and then pushed the question further from the biblical to the political: “Then why not every man?” Deliverance. From shackles, from oppression, from stereotype and misidentification, from prejudice, from any form of restraint, even that proposed by gravity. Toward freedom. (I note that in the photo the minister is the only one encumbered with shoes.) To me, all dance is a discourse on freedom, but in black dance, for obvious reasons, this discourse has been as much literal as figurative. Which fact makes it impossible not to see this photograph as history as much as choreography, although it is an image in which the “black body” is not solely a site of pain, suffering and exploitation — as it is often depicted today — but also the locus of an extraordinary joy. At the shimmering point at which archetypes (“the black body”) become individuals and then icons, I spy, in this image of uplift, Bishop Richard Allen, Marsha Hunt and Joseph Cinque leaping into history, or the Rev.

5ca6228249f0eacbf1f80e6d,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/04/style/beyonce-adidas-collaboration.html,"After Kanye and Adidas, and Rihanna and Puma; after Questlove and Nike, and Kendrick Lamar and Reebok, it was only a matter of time. And on Thursday, the first lady of Everything, Beyoncé Knowles, entered the sneaker wars. Adidas announced that it would collaborate with Ms. Knowles on several endeavors, including a signature collection with Adidas and an expansion of the singer’s active-wear brand, Ivy Park. She will be a creative partner at Adidas. In a statement, Ms. Knowles called the coming collaboration the “partnership of a lifetime” and touted a shared philosophy “that puts creativity, growth and social responsibility at the forefront of business.” The pop star and entrepreneur will retain ownership of Ivy Park, which was introduced in 2016 in partnership with Topshop and sells comfort wear and athleisure at retailers including Nordstrom. In 2018, Ms. Knowles acquired full ownership of the company after Sir Philip Green, Topshop’s owner, was accused of racial abuse and sexual harassment. Little financial information about Ivy Park is available, and it is unclear how successful the brand has been. It was immediately popular upon its release in 2016. On Thursday, its website had been altered to broadcast the Adidas partnership. The Beyoncé/Adidas collaboration is perhaps the most notable partnership between a superstar and a sports brand yet, and it indicates the consumer and social power that can be derived from such cross-branding. It is also a tribute to the lane Rihanna paved in 2014 when she became a creative director and global ambassador at Puma, back when it was still a novel idea that an entertainer might lend her name to a company best known for athletic apparel. (Rihanna parted ways with Puma and is now said to be working with LVMH on her own luxury brand.) Championing women and girls has become a key part of Adidas’s public relations strategy. This month, the company announced a new phase of its “She Breaks Barriers” initiative, which highlights the lack of equal media coverage for women’s sports in the United States.  Ms. Knowles has positioned herself as a political voice for black Americans and for women, including through her musical examination of her marriage and her 2018 Coachella performance, which gave a platform to historically black colleges. She will amplify these messages, and those Adidas has already pushed, by giving the company her imprimatur. “Beyoncé is an iconic creator but also a proven business leader, and together, we have the ability to inspire change and empower the next generation of creators,” said Eric Liedtke, a member of the executive board of Adidas AG. Adidas’s “multilayered” partnership with Ms. Knowles will include a program whose resources will be given over to “the next generation of athletes, creators and leaders.” Last July, Forbes estimated that Ms. Knowles was worth $355 million, citing her most recent solo album, “Lemonade,” her million-dollar-grossing tour with her husband Jay-Z and the value of her stake in his streaming service, Tidal.

5c6c1e1b3a125f5075c0a6a2,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/19/realestate/she-loves-her-stuff-he-has-little-and-cares-less.html,"The actor Will Chase and the singer and composer Ingrid Michaelson were introduced years ago at a red-carpet charity event.  “I don’t remember meeting him,” said Ms. Michaelson, 39, all cheery candor. “I remember meeting her,” said Mr. Chase, 48, who plays an egotistic trouper/impresario (nothing like his own gallant self, of course) in the Broadway revival of “Kiss Me Kate,” now in previews, and who set hearts aflutter as the country-singing superstar Luke Wheeler on the series “Nashville.” His TV credits also include “Smash,” “Sharp Objects” and “Stranger Things.” It’s safe to say that the story of their courtship wouldn’t spark a bidding war for the film rights.  “We went on a date,” said Ms. Michaelson, who has released eight studio albums and made her film-acting debut in the 2017 comedy “Humor Me.” “We liked each other, and that was that. He started out as a fan of my music, and I was a fan, too, because I loved ‘Nashville.’ We came to each other with mutual respect.” She continued: “Not to be morose, but my mother passed away, I got a divorce and my life kind of fell apart. And then I began seeing Will, and right off the bat it was good.” Living together has been similarly fine. “Wunderbar,” you might say, to quote one of Mr. Chase’s numbers from “Kiss Me Kate.”  Soon after getting together in 2015, the couple moved into a three-floor spread in a rental building in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn. And perhaps as a nod to Ms. Michaelson’s obsession with the Yuletide season — don’t get her going on her musical Christmas clock, a gift from Hallmark — they quickly planted a dozen evergreens on one of the apartment’s two terraces. Ms. Michaelson’s brother, Charlie, and his wife and toddler daughter are right upstairs, in the building’s only other unit. “Ingrid and her brother are very tight, and we get to see them every day, which is a plus of being here,” Mr. Chase said. “And we’re the insta-babysitters.” Keeping to the all-in-the-family theme, one of Mr. Chase’s daughters from his first marriage has lately been in residence as well, on a gap year before starting college. Occupations: He’s an actor; she’s a pop composer and singer who did a stint on Broadway as a replacement in “Natasha, Pierre & the Great Comet of 1812.” Getting away from it all: “I know a lot of theater people say this, but I like living tucked away from the theater district,” Mr. Chase said. “It’s very familial in Brooklyn. I like to be here and veg.” Ms. Michaelson has taken the lead in outfitting the apartment. This is partly because she is hip, Mr. Chase said, and knows that a certain object “will look great in the place by the thing, which I just can’t visualize.”  And it is partly because she had many pieces to contribute, several from the Victorian house in Nyack, N.Y., that she owned with her former husband: bedside lamps, side tables, chests, a mirror and a dining table that she adored but worried might be too big for the space.  “We just measured it,” she said. “It’s 82 inches and I’m like, ‘Should we get a smaller table?’ But I do love it.” But really, it comes down to this: Ms. Michaelson has her stuff, and she loves her stuff. Mr. Chase is not a material guy. He accumulates little and cares less, although he is very tender on the subject of the vinyl classical records he inherited from Ms. Michaelson’s father. “I’m like, ‘Don’t you want to keep that chair or whatever from your family?’ And he’s like, ‘Not really.’ Will’s very easygoing. I admire that he doesn’t get sentimental about too many objects,” Ms. Michaelson said. “I, on the other hand, hold on to things,” she added, pointing to the chest from her family’s Staten Island house that held her childhood arts and crafts supplies, and to two spindle-backed antique chairs, the sole survivors of a set that belonged to her grandmother. When Ms. Michaelson does let something go, she tries very hard to avoid regret. This is not always possible. It was absolutely not possible in the case of the antique egg incubator she bought at the Brooklyn shop Sterling Place.  “It was my first big furniture purchase, and it cost $500,” she said. “I used it as a side table, but it was really too big for a side table and too small for anything else. So I ended up selling it.” She added: “I still think about it.” “Note to self: Christmas present,” her boyfriend said. Whatever his indifference to how his space is filled, Mr. Chase would prefer that the space be big. Never mind that more often than not he and Ms. Michaelson can be found nestled on the very puffy sectional in a corner of the living room watching “Game of Thrones.”  He likes room to roam. He’s got it. The living room — heavy on the wood and earth tones, and heavily dependent on Restoration Hardware and West Elm — is cozy and welcoming, but betrays nothing about the professional lives of the inhabitants. All is revealed in the studio/office where, surrounded by family photos and theater posters and caricatures, Mr. Chase memorizes his lines and Ms. Michaelson writes. (She is working on the score for a musical adaptation of “The Notebook.”) “It’s kind of our accomplishments in here, mixed with bizarre things,” she said.  Bizarre: the lion’s head she bought at a rest stop while on tour. Bizarre (but sweet): the Grimace sponge she bought for Mr. Chase on eBay.  The accomplishments include Mr. Chase’s Tony Award nomination certificate (for his performance in the 2012 revival of “The Mystery of Edwin Drood”) and Ms. Michaelson’s two platinum singles (for 2007’s “The Way I Am” and 2014’s “Girls Chase Boys”). “But it’s not ‘Look at us.’ It’s not, like, showcasing us,” Mr. Chase insisted. “And then we joke, ‘It’s not like we have that many awards.’” For weekly email updates on residential real estate news, sign up here.

5c7f320d49f0eacbf105b88d,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/05/arts/music/r-kelly-interview.html,"In his first interview following his arrest last month on sexual abuse charges, an emotional and unyielding R. Kelly denied having sex with underage girls and portrayed himself as a victim of a social media-fueled smear campaign. Mr. Kelly, whose real name is Robert Kelly, screamed, cursed and pleaded to the camera in the sit-down with Gayle King, a host of “CBS This Morning,” parts of which aired on Wednesday. “Hate me if you want to, love me if you want,” Mr. Kelly said. “But just use your common sense. How stupid would it be for me, with my crazy past and what I’ve been through — oh, right now I just think I need to be a monster, hold girls against their will, chain them up in my basement, and don’t let them eat, don’t let them out!” He continued, directly into the camera and growing tearful: “I didn’t do this stuff! This is not me!” “I’m fighting for my life!” he said, using an expletive. He jumped out of his seat and became so upset that Ms. King paused the interview so he could regain his composure. Mr. Kelly, 52, was charged last month in Chicago with 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse involving four women, three of whom were minors at the time. He was released from jail last week after a woman describing herself as a friend of Mr. Kelly posted a $100,000 bond. His arrest came after a Lifetime documentary, “Surviving R. Kelly,” brought new attention to accusations that he had mistreated women and revived prosecutors’ interest in his behavior. “Everybody says something bad about me,” Mr. Kelly said, referring to the documentary. “Nobody said nothing good. They was describing Lucifer. I’m not Lucifer. I’m a man. I make mistakes, but I’m not a devil. And by no means am I a monster.” [Read more on the Surviving R. Kelly documentary that detailed the sex abuse accusations.] CBS released portions of the interview Tuesday night, and another portion will air on Thursday. During the interview, Ms. King repeatedly pressed Mr. Kelly about the many allegations against him. He gave no ground, and often fired back at his accusers. When she asked him if he had broken any laws, he responded, “Absolutely not.” “You can start a rumor on a guy like me or a celebrity just like that,” he said. “All you have to do is push a button on your phone and say: ‘So and so did this to me. R. Kelly did this to me.’” When Ms. King asked Mr. Kelly if he had done anything wrong, he said: “Lots of things wrong when it come to women, that I apologize. But I apologized in those relationships at the time I was in the relationships.” One of the women he is charged with sexually abusing as minors, Jerhonda Pace, said on Instagram and Twitter that what she saw in the interview “was a man that needs help.” “For decades he’s been around enablers who never told him the truth” about his conduct, she wrote. “Him believing he’s doing no wrong is no different than an adult telling a child Santa is real.” According to prosecutors, another of the underage girls was the same one who appeared in a sex tape with Mr. Kelly that resulted in a 2008 trial on child pornography charges. The girl did not testify then, and Mr. Kelly was found not guilty after his lawyers successfully argued that his identity could not be proved. In an excerpt from the interview released on Tuesday, Mr. Kelly referred to his acquittal, telling Ms. King: “You can’t double jeopardy me like that. You can’t. It’s not fair.” The new charges involving that girl are based on a newly obtained videotape, about two decades old, that came from someone who had once been in contact with Mr. Kelly. That person recently gave the tape to Michael Avenatti, the celebrity lawyer, who turned it over to prosecutors. [Prosecutors say a hairdresser, autograph seeker and birthday girl were all victims of R. Kelly.] In the tape, the girl refers several times to having 14-year-old body parts and, according to Mr. Avenatti, the acts depicted in the video were different from those at the center of the 2008 case, eliminating any issue of double jeopardy. Ms. King also mentioned that Lady Gaga had recently apologized for having collaborated with Mr. Kelly on a song several years ago. Mr. Kelly responded: “She’s a very great talent and it’s unfortunate that her intelligence go to such a short level when it comes to that.” Some of the interview covered allegations separate from Mr. Kelly’s criminal case: that he has held women in a kind of sexual and emotional captivity, dictating their every move, including when they can go to the bathroom. The parents of two women now living with Mr. Kelly, Azriel Clary, 21, and Joycelyn Savage, 23, have accused him of brainwashing their daughters. [Meet the woman trying to convict R. Kelly and send him to prison.] “I love them,” Mr. Kelly told Ms. King. “It’s like they’re like my girlfriends. We have a relationship. It’s real and I know guys like — I’ve known guys all my life that have five or six women, okay. So don’t go there on me.” As for their age, Mr. Kelly said: “I don’t look at much younger than me. I just look at legal,” and that he was an “older man that loves all women,” regardless of age. He also said the women’s parents had encouraged them to get close to R. Kelly to jump-start their music careers. “What kind of father, what kind of mother would sell their daughter to a man?” he said, adding that Ms. Clary’s parents had wanted her to have sex with him. An interview Ms. King conducted with Ms. Clary and Ms. Savage will air on Friday. In an excerpt aired on Wednesday, Ms. Clary is visibly emotional. “I’m crying because you guys don’t know the truth,” Ms. Clary said. “You guys believe in some facade that our parents are saying; this is all lies for money. If you can’t see that, you’re ignorant, and you’re stupid,” adding several expletives. Ms. Clary’s parents responded on Twitter via Mr. Avenatti. After Ms. Savage’s parents held a news conference in Atlanta later in the morning, their daughter called them. According to a television reporter who was there, the parents said it was the first time they had spoken with her in two years. Mr. Kelly could soon wind up back in jail; according to The Chicago Sun-Times, a court ordered that if he did not pay his ex-wife the $161,663 he owes her in child support by Wednesday morning, he could be jailed for failure to pay. It was unclear Wednesday afternoon if he had paid. “I have been assassinated,” Mr. Kelly told Ms. King. “I have been buried alive, but I’m alive.” "

Your album “Pacific Daydream” is nominated for a Grammy this year; you just released the “Teal Album,” and the “Black Album” is coming out in March. Most important, your cover of Toto’s “Africa” hit more than 25 million streams on Spotify. Well, that started with a 14-year-old girl in Ohio who spammed us every day requesting us to cover Toto’s “Africa.” We let it play out for a few months and decided to release Toto’s “Rosanna.” Then, a week later, we put out “Africa.” Do you get tired of playing, say, your old hit “Buddy Holly” all the time? We’ve played well over a thousand shows, and it’s all about feeling the audience’s excitement, and it’s just so addictive. Standing up there and playing a lick or singing a hook is just like putting a question out into the universe: “Am I worth something? Am I good? Am I cool?” And you just want to hear this roar of affirmation: “Yes, Rivers, you rock.” It’s such an intense craving for me that I’ll do whatever it takes to get it, even if it means playing “Buddy Holly” for the 2,000th time. You’ve been a rock star for decades now. Do you think you’ll always want to keep answering that question? Yeah, until I kick the addiction. It’s like any drug. You can’t just say, “Well, you’ve been shooting heroin for 25 years by now, you think you’d just feel good all the time,” right? Do you think that’s a healthful way to live? I have some detachment from it now, and I can use that addictive dynamic to get the best work out of me without being too miserable all the time. Number one by limiting my exposure to the online world. That’s just more stuff to get addicted to, and it can give you a thrill, but it can make you feel pretty terrible about yourself. I’ve set my computer so I can’t get on to social media except for a few hours on Fridays. But you were just on Twitter. I was? What does it say? It says, “My voice is dead tonight, you have any vocal health tips for me?” Oh, I just load it all into a program which tweets three times a day. So I don’t know when that was composed, but not recently. Though my voice is kind of wrecked today. Even with the limits, you do have a very clear relationship to social media. You’re very present on Snapchat. Yeah, that’s the one I do every day. As for the rest of my social media, it’s 100 percent sincere and reflecting how I’m feeling at the time, but probably only 20 percent of it is literally from me. The rest is cut and paste. Sometimes your tweets feel as if they might be curated by artificial intelligence. My new passion is computer programming. I’ve been writing a program to generate our set lists for our tour with the Pixies. I get almost sexually aroused looking at spreadsheets. You signed up for Tinder for purely platonic reasons. How did that go? I was working with this producer, Jake Sinclair. He’s a young guy. He was on Tinder, and he was telling me all about it, and I just started writing songs from his perspective. I met somebody in Indianapolis — we walked around the whole city. But I started talking to this one woman on the phone, and I said: “Look, I’ve gotta be upfront with you. I’m actually just a songwriter looking for inspiration,” and I think she was really disappointed. It made me feel like this is not the best experiment to continue. “Saturday Night Live” aired a sketch featuring Matt Damon and Leslie Jones as insanely devoted Weezer fans. What did you think of it? I didn’t watch it. I like to exist in my own happy little world and not be too close to what people are saying about the band. You wrote a tweet about it. You said you were crying while watching it, in all caps. I’m sure that would be my reaction if I did see it. "
5c79789349f0eacbf105aea6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/01/arts/music/review-aida-met-opera-verdi.html,"“O terra, addio,” the doomed lovers sing at the end of Verdi’s “Aida,” bidding the earth adieu. Now, after 31 years and 245 performances, the time has come for the Metropolitan Opera’s sprawling, sturdy, utterly traditional, utterly delightful “Aida” production to join them in farewell. The well-worn, well-loved show will play just twice more, on March 4 and 7 (numbers 246 and 247). Then its weathered hieroglyphics, its applause-garnering live horses, its looming walls of craggy stone-esque plaster and its gold-sprayed props will all be sealed in storage, as securely as Aida and Radamès in their tomb at the opera’s end. Peter Gelb, the company’s general manager, confirmed in an interview that when “Aida” returns, it will be to open the 2020-21 season in a new production directed by Michael Mayer and designed by Christine Jones, the pair that updated the Met’s “Rigoletto” to 1960s Las Vegas. Yannick Nézet-Séguin will conduct a starry cast: Anna Netrebko, Anita Rachvelishvili, Piotr Beczala and Ludovic Tézier. “It will be as epic and grand as the current production,” Mr. Gelb said, “in a completely different way.” (And, in news that will give succor to audience members mulling late-night Metro-North trains back to Scarsdale, it will also eliminate one of the current staging’s two intermissions.) Perhaps it’s not fashionable for a critic, especially one with a taste for the progressive in opera productions, to cop to loving the Met’s “Aida,” which was originally mounted in 1988 in majestic Franco Zeffirelli-ish style by Sonja Frisell, who got the gig after Mr. Zeffirelli’s own concept proved impossibly expensive, even for the go-go ’80s. But I love it. I love the shadow-strewn scene on which the curtain rises during the soft final bars of the prelude. I love when Gianni Quaranta’s sets show just the giant heads and feet of temple carvings, as if to indicate we’re seeing merely the tip of the iceberg of a whole civilization. I love how Amneris’s attendants hilariously pretend to play the harp in the second act, and how one of them does a wonderfully unnecessary show of presenting perfumes for her to sample. I love how opera can sometimes be about what’s unnecessary, about what’s extravagant, fun, sensorily stimulating. I love when the stage slowly lowers to reveal the sun-baked Triumphal Scene. I love the ridiculous too-much-ness of that moment, with extras circling back into the parade again and again in different costumes, trying to convince us that this really is a cast of thousands. I love the flickering torchlight emanating from the chamber where the priests judge Radamès. I love the starlit Nile Scene, and I love the smoky temple rituals. Will the new production be better? Maybe. It will almost certainly be less hulking: Mr. Gelb said a major element will be projections by Mark Grimmer of 59 Productions, the design firm that has practically taken up residence at the Met. But the company’s departing, bulky, stage-filling simulacrum of ancient Egypt deserves an elegy for showing up, season after season, and finding the balance on which 19th-century grand opera relies: between awesome spectacle and intimate drama. The Frisell “Aida” stuck that difficult landing time and again, and it deserves our gratitude. It’s being put to bed honorably, with a cast that sings well and commits itself to the drama. The soprano Sondra Radvanovsky is for once an Aida who seems like the princess she is, proud and forthright. Ms. Radvanovsky has calmed a voice that used to have starker edges, though her tone is still chalky. With his haunting, echoey baritone, Quinn Kelsey is an unusually sinister Amonasro. As Radamès, the tenor Jorge de León is blunt but sincere and charming — much like the production. And while the commanding bass Soloman Howard is always a pleasure as the King, will the Met ever give him another role? The best surprise is the mezzo-soprano Olesya Petrova, who, after a handful of minor roles with the company, delivers a thrilling Amneris. Her voice has less plummy power than Ms. Rachvelishvili’s, but it penetrates, without ever losing its gentleness of texture. And she deploys it with delicacy and feeling through the full range of the character’s moods. Rarely have I seen an Amneris so plausibly lovelorn, so earnestly pained. When this production had its premiere on Dec. 8, 1988, the Radamès was Plácido Domingo. In a memorable bit of poetic symmetry, he returns for these final performances, this time on the podium, helping the great ocean liner sail one last time. "
5c76e03149f0eacbf105a7cc,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/27/arts/music/gunna-drip-or-drown-2-review.html,"At the beginning of “3 Headed Snake,” from his new album, “Drip or Drown 2,” Gunna is beautifully mumbling. Words are in there somewhere, but they’re genuinely of no concern. Rather than use a mumble to signal confusion or disorientation, he treats blurry words as a thing of exuberance. For him, the dance of pure syllables is almost peppy. Gunna is not the first rapper to retreat into the warm cocoon of pure tones. He is a dutiful student of Young Thug’s non sequitur filigree, which dominates the sound of streaming and has been put to use by everyone from Post Malone to Lil Baby. But Gunna is preternaturally chill, almost koan-like in his delivery. His voice is whisper-sweet. He raps on beats as if lightly touching them, fearful that they might snap under too much force. For the last couple of years, the 25-year-old rapper from Georgia has been releasing strong mixtapes steadily — “Drip or Drown 2” doesn’t quite have the full force of last year’s “Drip Season 3” or “Drip Harder,” his collaborative album with Lil Baby, but it is still thick with his signatures: calmness and word manipulation. Sometimes he bends words so hard that “ways” rhymes with “bags.” Sometimes he emphasizes the rhyme in the middle of the phrase as much as the one at the end of it. Sometimes he is narrative-driven, rapping about new cars, new clothes and new women, but generally he strings clauses together as if absent-minded, a fever dream of excess and bravado. (The most pure version of this here is on “Speed It Up,” where the phrases come hot and short.) In places, he opts for surrealism: “Pop an addy while I’m riding to meet Tom Ford.” And sometimes he leans on humor: “Got vintage garments old as my granny.” Gunna has a penchant for rapping over beats that include guitar, like on “Richard Millie Plain,” but he doesn’t use them for rock scabrousness. Instead, they’re caressing, soft-edged beds, elegant accompaniment for a rapper who makes his points with textures more than words. That said, there is a tenderness that peeks through here, not just in the gentleness of the sing-rapping, but also in some of the lyrics. Everyone raps about buying expensive new things, but only Gunna links the ability to spend money wantonly to emotional intimacy. On “Idk Why,” he raps, “Mama thanked me for her purse/And looked me in my face and then she started crying.” And on “Yao Ming,” he relates a tale familiar to anyone who thinks of a loved one while traveling: “Went shopping in Japan, spent more than my show/Brought Thugger back some pants.” "

In between, leaps across generations and oceans will define the organization’s 32nd season, which features 27 separate programs from September through June, Jazz at Lincoln Center announced on Tuesday. The South African concerts (Sept. 12-14) commemorate the 25th anniversary of apartheid’s defeat, and feature Wynton Marsalis leading his Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra alongside eight guest South African musicians. It’s one of nine programs that the orchestra is scheduled to perform over the year, including the world premiere of “Supernova” (April 23-25), a new suite by the saxophonist Sherman Irby, and the season-closing program devoted to some of Ellington’s major works (June 12-13). [Check out our Culture Calendar here.] Mr. Marsalis will pay tribute to the drummer Art Blakey, his former employer, in honor of Blakey’s centennial. He will perform items from the drummer and bandleader’s repertoire with a group of younger musicians. That same weekend, May 1-2, the drummer and former Blakey apprentice Ralph Peterson Jr. will also lead a group featuring other veterans of Blakey’s Jazz Messengers. ECM Records, the influential German label, will celebrate its 50th anniversary with a starry multinational lineup including Vijay Iyer, Ravi Coltrane and Anja Lechner (Nov. 1-2). Later that month, the Cuban pianist Chucho Valdés will perform alone as well as in a two-piano duet with Chick Corea (Nov. 15-16). Jazz at Lincoln Center’s main stages habitually favor older and established performers, but the 2019-20 season does include appearances from four distinguished figures of the younger generation: two vocalists, Cécile McLorin Salvant (Sept. 27-28) and Jazzmeia Horn (March 6-7), and two trumpeters, Ambrose Akinmusire (March 27-28) and Etienne Charles (June 5-6). This season also marks the 25th year of Essentially Ellington, Jazz at Lincoln Center’s flagship education program, which supports festivals for young performers and provides resources to jazz educators.

5c94c08b49f0eacbf105e782,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/22/movies/the-dirt-review.html,"Mötley Crüe’s first gig, as dramatized in Jeff Tremaine’s Netflix adaptation of the band’s memoir, “The Dirt,” does not go well. The drummer, Tommy Lee, knocks over a cymbal before anyone plays a note; the crowd’s heckling turns into a full-on brawl. But when that fight is over, a guy in the back punctures the silence to scream, “[Expletive] yeah, Mötley Crüe!” And that sentiment is an apt summation of the approach and complexity of this tepid, incompetent biopic. The book version, attributed to all four members and the writer Neil Strauss, was a notorious tell-all, reveling in the group’s bad behavior and self-mythologizing. But Tremaine and the screenwriters Rich Wilkes and Amanda Adelson have sanded it down to a junior varsity “Bohemian Rhapsody,” complete with many of the same crude devices: embarrassingly bad wigs, hilariously on-the-nose needle drops (the band plays “Take Me to the Top” as they go … to the top) and declamatory, subtext-free dialogue. As with “Bohemian,” the result is the kind of paint-by-numbers storytelling that “Walk Hard” should have smothered in its crib over a decade ago. Tremaine’s staging is as convincing as an ’80s-themed party at an insurance office, and the film is shot with all the visual punch of a period Bud Light commercial. The nonstop preening and partying of the first half is exhausting, but the comedown, in which Tremaine attempts to rearrange the film into a serious character drama, is downright painful. The filmmakers try desperately to have it both ways, flipping from cheerful hedonism to “Reefer Madness”-style moralizing. The complexities of addiction seems out of their grasp. Biopics love to dazzle us with their try-hard verisimilitude, and this one gives us nearly 10 minutes of end-credit split-screen comparisons between the real Crüe and the movie Crüe, presumably so we can marvel at the skill of the duplication.

Kelly was charged in Chicago with 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse. Read more here.  Two additional women came forward on Thursday to accuse the R&B star R. Kelly of sexual abuse and misconduct while they were minors. The women, who had not previously spoken publicly about the accusations, gave their accounts at a news conference in New York organized by their lawyer, Gloria Allred. The two women, Latresa Scaff, 40, and Rochelle Washington, 39, both of Maryland, said they met the singer, whose real name is Robert Kelly and who has faced sexual abuse accusations going back more than two decades, after a concert in Baltimore in 1995 or 1996. [What we know about R. Kelly’s  trail of sexual abuse accusations.] Mr. Kelly had performed with LL Cool J at an arena in the city. The two teenagers, who were about 16 and 15 at the time, bought tickets to the concert and an after-party at a nearby nightclub, they said. Ms. Allred showed photos of the two women that they said were taken that night. They had dressed up and were smiling broadly as they posed with LL Cool J and in front of a backdrop emblazoned with Mr. Kelly’s visage. At the after-party, Mr. Kelly pointed to the girls and asked his security guards to bring them to the stage, the women said. They were offered drugs and alcohol, and Mr. Kelly’s staff members paid for a taxi to take them back to his hotel, Ms. Scaff said. While waiting for Mr. Kelly to arrive in a hotel suite, the girls were so excited that they called a local radio station to tell them they were with R. Kelly, Ms. Scaff said. They went on live radio and “many people heard us,” she added. Mr. Kelly entered the room a short while later with his penis exposed and asked the girls to dance, Ms. Scaff said. He asked for a threesome, the women said, and Rochelle, who was younger, said she would not participate and went into the bathroom. Mr. Kelly then asked Latresa to perform oral sex, and had sex with her, she said. She was under the influence of marijuana and alcohol at the time, she added. Afterward, neither girl saw Mr. Kelly again. Ms. Scaff said she told friends about what had happened, and Ms. Washington told her mother. “When I first met R. Kelly that night, I was very happy and excited because I was young and star-struck,” Ms. Scaff said. But in hindsight, she said, she feels hurt. “I am speaking out because I want to encourage other victims who I know must be out there to come forward as well,” she added. Ms. Allred said that both women met with officials from the office of the United States attorney for the Eastern District of New York on Thursday afternoon to share their accounts. Asked why she chose that office, rather than the Baltimore Police Department or another agency, Ms. Allred said she had confidence in the prosecutors there and believed that they were investigating Mr. Kelly. A spokesman for the office said he could not confirm that. A lawyer for Mr. Kelly did not immediately return a call and email requesting comment. Mr. Kelly has faced accusations of sexual misconduct and abuse for decades but has never been convicted; he has denied that he had sex with minors or held women against their will. He was acquitted in 2008 of 14 counts of child pornography in a trial that centered on a sex tape, and has reached settlements with numerous accusers. But momentum against him has been building since Buzzfeed News’s publication in July 2017 of a lengthy investigation into accusations that Mr. Kelly held women in a so-called sex cult. That article, by the journalist Jim DeRogatis, who has been reporting on the accusations against Mr. Kelly for nearly 20 years, spurred a six-part Lifetime documentary, “Surviving R. Kelly,” that aired last month and included testimony from several women who accused Mr. Kelly of abuse. Public opinion seemed to turn against him. His label, RCA Records, has dropped him, and Spotify has removed his songs, which include “Ignition” and “I Believe I Can Fly,” from its playlists. He is also being investigated in at least two states: Illinois and Georgia, where he had homes and where prosecutors have urged any potential victims or witnesses to come forward. The celebrity lawyer Michael Avenatti also said last week that he had given Chicago prosecutors a videotape that, according to a report, appears to show Mr. Kelly having sex with a girl who may have been underage. Ms. Allred said she represented “a number” of Mr. Kelly’s accusers — she would not specify how many — and said that some were worried that videos of them being abused might be circulating. Ms. Washington, who cried as she spoke, encouraged women who were victimized by Mr. Kelly to contact lawyers and law enforcement officials. “I want victims to know it’s not their fault,” she said. "

Kelly having sex with a girl who may have been underage. Once a dominant R&B singer and hitmaker, Kelly, 52, has been trailed by allegations of sexual misconduct and abuse for years, but he has never been convicted of a crime. In 2008, he was acquitted of child pornography charges pertaining to a videotape that, prosecutors alleged, showed Kelly having sex with an underage girl. Avenatti said in an interview and on Twitter that the tape, made in the late 1990s, was not the same tape in the 2008 trial. He said he had turned it over to the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office in Chicago, which has been looking into Kelly’s conduct but declined to answer questions about the tape on Thursday. The video, which is about 45 minutes long, includes two scenes, one in a living room and another in a bedroom, according to CNN, which said it had seen the tape. A man whom CNN said “appears to be R. Kelly is seen performing multiple sex acts with the girl.” In the tape, Kelly and the girl refer to her body parts being 14 years old. He urinates on her. Law enforcement officials in Illinois and Georgia, where Kelly has had homes, began looking into his behavior after the documentary “Surviving R. Kelly” aired on Lifetime last month. The program detailed accusations that Kelly had sex with minors and kept young women in what has been described as a sex cult, preventing them from communicating with their families and exerting control over their lives, including whom they could look in the eye and when they could use the bathroom. Two weeks after the documentary aired, Kelly was dropped by his label, RCA Records, following intense pressure from activists in the #MuteRKelly campaign. In a strongly worded statement on Thursday, Kelly’s lawyer, Steve Greenberg, questioned the credibility of Avenatti and CNN’s description of the video and said Kelly “denies that he has engaged in any illegal conduct, of any kind whatsoever.” He also portrayed the women who have spoken out against Kelly as being out for money: “Accuse R. Kelly and boom, make a buck.” Building a criminal case against Kelly could be challenging, for similar reasons that bedeviled prosecutors in 2008. That case involved a 27-minute sex tape that bore some disquieting similarities to the tape described by Avenatti and CNN on Thursday. The previous video showed what prosecutors described as Kelly having sex with and urinating on an underage girl. That girl never testified, and Kelly’s lawyers argued that her identity could not be proven. Avenatti declined to say how he had obtained the new video. On Twitter he said he was representing “multiple clients,” but in the interview he did not say whether he was representing the girl in the video, nor whether she was cooperating, a fact that could be as pivotal as it was in 2008. He said that the charges based on the new tape could be brought in Illinois despite the fact that it was made two decades ago. At the time, the statute of limitations for child sex crimes allowed charges to be brought until a victim turned 38; the time limit was erased in 2017. Avenatti rose to prominence representing Stormy Daniels, who said she had an affair with President Trump. Avenatti also represented a woman named Julie Swetnick, who accused Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct ahead of his confirmation hearings for the Supreme Court. But questions about Swetnick’s account, which was viewed as less credible than that of another accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, helped rally holdout Republicans around the idea that Kavanaugh was the victim of character attacks. Avenatti toyed publicly with running for president in 2020, before announcing that he had decided against it. "
5c4febe83a125f5075c06d08,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/29/opinion/italy-claudio-baglioni.html,"MILAN — Politics is a show, and every country has its favorite. The United States is bringing on yet another Hollywood classic (the aging action hero, the desert, the border, the money). France is offering its periodic re-enactment of its Revolution, with gilets jaunes replacing sans-culottes. Germany’s national orchestra is saying goodbye to an exhausted chancellor/conductor. Britain is deep into a Shakespearean tragedy of its own creation: to leave or not to leave Europe…?  And what about Italy? It’s a music festival, of course. The Italian Song Festival (Festival della Canzone Italiana) is held annually in Sanremo, a quaint seaside resort near the French border, and is by far the most popular television event of the year. This year it will be broadcast live between Feb. 5 and Feb. 9. Held since 1951, it is used for picking the Italian entry to the Eurovision Song Contest and today it attracts more than 12 million viewers — more than half of the country’s TV audience. It combines a song contest with some comedy and a few handsomely paid international guests. Advertisers scramble to squeeze their products into five days of prime-time broadcasts.  But Sanremo, as it is known, is far more than a song contest. It’s a national gathering, like the Academy Awards in the United States. It’s a truce in quarrelsome times. It’s predictable and reassuring. The young like to trash it live on social media, but they too watch it, and talk about little else for days. That is why I’ve accepted an invitation to join the festival’s giuria degli esperti (experts jury), which includes writers, actors and film directors (Sanremo’s organizers didn’t know I was planning to write about them, of course). But watching the Barnum from the inside? How could I say no? It’ll be a master’s degree in political science, anthropology and social studies — all in a few days.  Sanremo’s presenter — and artistic director — changes regularly. Last year and again this year both roles have fallen to a soft-spoken pop singer in his 60s, Claudio Baglioni. His 1972 song “Questo Piccolo Grande Amore” (“This Little Great Love”), lamenting a young man’s obsession about his unattainable beloved in her ultrathin T-shirt, is still an unofficial national anthem; every Italian can sing along with it. On Jan. 9, during the preview news conference, Mr. Baglioni answered a question about immigration. It’s a sensitive topic; the populist government is openly fighting it. He complained that the public mood has turned “nasty.” He said that this government, just like the previous ones, is mismanaging immigration, this time allowing a”a farce” by leaving 50 asylum-seekers at sea for 19 days. (They were finally brought to shore the same day by the Maltese Coast Guard and will be distributed across nine European Union nations). All hell broke loose. The director and presenter was crucified on social media, government ministers attacked him and state television executives voiced their disapproval. Matteo Salvini, Italy’s interior minister and leader of the anti-immigration League, said: “I like Claudio Baglioni when he sings, not when he gives political speeches.”  Italy split — not along traditional party lines, but in more imaginative, unexpected ways. Sanremo’s old devotees argued for freedom of expression, even though they had voted for the populist parties, Mr. Baglioni’s fans defended him, and scores of pop singers — rarely heard on these topics — passionately took sides. Political pundits who can’t tell the difference between a refrain and a remix wrote thoughtful columns. For a few days Italy was transformed into a huge debating society. Until everyone got fed up and started arguing about something else. A country where immigration is discussed because of a song contest but not in Parliament? Is that worrying? Actually it’s quite interesting, and somewhat refreshing. Italy is indeed in a new mode. The 2018 election winners — the Five Star Movement and the League — approved a painful budget, after a long hassle with the European Union Commission — and are jockeying for position before the European election (May 23 to 26). They disagree about most things, from self-defense to infrastructure, vaccination to immigration. But the League, which received 17 percent of the vote in the 2018 election, is booming, and is now credited with a stunning 36 percent of public support. By contrast, its governmental partner, Five Star, is losing pace, down from 33 percent to 26 percent, as Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte whispered to Germany’s chancellor, Angela Merkel, in Davos on Jan. 23. Luigi Di Maio, its young leader, is worried and confused. After praising France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, at the end of 2017 (“The Five Star Movement believes deeply, just like you, in Europe’s refoundation”), on Jan. 8 he posted his praise for, and even offered logistical support to, the Yellow Vests in France: “Yours is the same spirit that has animated the Five Star Movement and thousands of Italians since our birth in 2009.”  But, like an embarrassed spouse, his colleague Mr. Salvini was quick to point out that the Italian government is against violence. And so are Italians, it must be said. To many foreigners, Italy may look and sound like an endless festival. But this noisy, messy, passionate discussion actually keeps the nation together, especially at times like this. A new migrants’ crisis is taking place over a boat carrying 47 people that has been prevented from docking in Sicily. People shout and argue and many say unpleasant things. But they don’t clash in the street or hate each other. Social tensions in France, Britain and the United States run higher. We have no Yellow Vests in Italy, no Brexit-like psychodrama, no shutdowns and no walls. To be sure, we are arguing again about boats with migrants. But our national pressure cooker is fitted with a valve so that political steam is slowly and safely released. It’s an orchestra of finely tuned humanity, even if that humanity sometimes rises alarmingly in pitch.  For Italians, even disharmony is a sign of sanity, decency and, most important, joie de vivre. And no populist government can change that.

5c6718853a125f5075c09fa2,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/15/arts/music/city-opera-bankruptcy-challenge.html,"There are ominous notes coming from New York City Opera. The company, which has struggled to raise money since emerging from bankruptcy in 2016 and was forced to sharply curtail its current season to cut costs, announced this week that its board chairman — and biggest benefactor — was stepping down. The departing chairman, Roy G. Niederhoffer, a hedge fund manager who played a key role in the effort to revive City Opera after it closed and filed for bankruptcy in 2013, said in an interview that he was leaving the board for personal reasons, explaining that he needed more time to focus on his growing business and young family. But his move comes at a troubled moment. City Opera had planned to open this season with Robert Ward’s opera “The Crucible,” but it canceled the production as part of its efforts to halve the year’s operating budget after failing to hit fund-raising targets. Its board is down to a mere three members. It has largely spent the more than $5 million in bequests it received after emerging from bankruptcy, and its modest endowment is shrinking. The company’s most recent financial report notes that its difficulties “raise substantial doubt about New York City Opera, Inc.’s ability to continue as a going concern.” Michael Capasso, the company’s general director, and its new interim board chairman, Kenneth A. Rosen, said they were confident City Opera would be able to survive by adding board members, wooing new donors and continuing to build community ties. They said they expected the big production this June, Iain Bell’s “Stonewall,” a world premiere commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall uprising, to help. “Look, it’s an uphill battle,” Mr. Capasso said in an interview. “Producing opera is hard. And expensive. But I think we know how to do it, and I think we’re actually poised to achieve success.” Since returning after the bankruptcy with a traditional production of Puccini’s “Tosca,” the company has brought back the theater legend Harold Prince to stage Bernstein’s “Candide,” long a City Opera favorite; performed a series of operas in Spanish and another series on gay themes; and presented contemporary works, including Charles Wuorinen’s “Brokeback Mountain,” which had been commissioned by the original iteration of the company. But City Opera’s assumption that it could raise $4 to $5 million a year — roughly 30 percent of what it had before bankruptcy — proved overly optimistic. Mr. Niederhoffer praised Mr. Capasso for taking the company out of bankruptcy, saying they had succeeded in every area “save one.” “The one thing that we failed at, at least so far, is that the fund-raising proved much more difficult than we anticipated,” he said. “What failed to materialize so far is the broad-based support that NYCO once had from many thousands of individual donors, from prior board members and prior donors — some of whom did come back, but not at the level we anticipated.” Mr. Niederhoffer made up fund-raising shortfalls himself by writing big checks; company officials said that he had given more than $8 million in recent years to the company. When he was asked if he would continue to offer the same level of support, he said, “I can’t commit to anything right now, but I will certainly do my best to support the company.” Mr. Capasso said that the company was determined to live within its means, even if that meant scaling back. “In prior years there was a spending problem, not necessarily a fund-raising problem,” he said. “Now we have the opposite: The spending is very much in line; the fund-raising is not.” Significant challenges lie ahead. The value of City Opera’s endowment fund dropped to $3.4 million as of the end of June 2017, down from $4.8 million the year before, according to an audited financial statement. The statement said that City Opera’s board had agreed to spend more than the authorized 7 percent of the fund to rebuild the company after bankruptcy, and that the board planned to replenish the fund. During the bankruptcy case, questions were raised about the viability of the reorganized company. A filing by the New York State Attorney General’s office noted that the pending bequests meant that the new company would be “almost certainly financially viable in the short run” but added that “this cannot be said for the plan’s financial sustainability beyond its first few years.” The reorganized company faced significant headwinds: It has had to repay more than $1.2 million to creditors owed money in the bankruptcy, officials said in a court filing, even as it was starting from scratch. But Mr. Rosen, the new chairman, said that he expected to be able to build up the board and a new group of donors. The company just hired a new development director. “I think that success begets more success,” he said. “I would hope and anticipate that with the success of ‘Stonewall,’ you build up that head of steam for your next event.” "

Right off the bat, bounding onto the stage in a white tuxedo — the Met’s production is updated to 1960s Las Vegas — Mr. Grigolo looked the part of the womanizing Duke of Mantua. But he acted nervously overeager and sang that way, too. During “Questa o quella,” the duke’s snappy aria declaring that all women entice him, Mr. Grigolo sounded almost desperate. This charismatic tenor, with his brawny voice and feral intensity, has become perhaps the most dependably exciting singer in opera. And when he slips into this unruly hyper-tenor mode, you often don’t mind because he also delivers blazing sound and passion. But often on Tuesday, he just pushed too hard vocally and overplayed the duke’s unbridled sensuality. Nicola Luisotti’s stylish but deferential conducting just called more attention to Mr. Grigolo’s volatility. Verdi’s jester, Rigoletto, is turned into this Rat Pack duke’s sidekick, though what exactly his responsibilities are remains a gap at the core of the director Michael Mayer’s concept. The baritone Roberto Frontali looked sympathetic as an older, bedraggled man in a loud sweater and frumpy coat. His voice, if not sizable or richly colored, is firm and appealing. But his honorable performance was ill-matched to Mr. Grigolo’s hotheaded aristocrat. The soprano Nadine Sierra — as Gilda, the daughter Rigoletto tries to keep hidden at home — started unsure but blossomed. Her singing was technically assured, with clean coloratura passagework and shimmering top notes, and sensitively phrased. After the duke, pretending to be a poor student, romances Gilda and rushes off, you could see Ms. Sierra wondering what feelings this brash man had unleashed in her. Her reaction set the mood perfectly for the aria “Caro nome.” Ms. Sierra sang it beautifully, though her sound has a bright, sunny glint that can feel hard-edged. She was at her best during the wrenching scene when Gilda, having been abducted by the duke’s henchmen, confesses her shame to her despairing father. The earthy bass Stefan Kocan was a malevolent Sparafucile, a hired assassin. As his sister Maddalena, Ramona Zaharia, a rich-voiced mezzo-soprano, had a strong Met debut. You want to hope that over the course of a 13-performance run, this “Rigoletto” should settle in. But there will be even more cast changes than scheduled, now that Bryan Hymel has withdrawn from the final eight performances as the duke, citing personal reasons. He will be replaced by no fewer than three different tenors. "
5c6352b33a125f5075c095c5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/12/arts/21-savage-released.html,"Lawyers for the Britain-born rapper 21 Savage say he will be released on bond on Wednesday after spending more than a week in the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which said it had arrested him for being in the United States illegally. Kuck Baxter Immigration, the law firm representing the rapper, whose legal name is She’yaa Bin Abraham-Joseph, posted news of his pending release on its Facebook page on Tuesday afternoon. “In the last 24 hours, in the wake of the Grammy Awards at which he was scheduled to attend and perform, we received notice that She’yaa was granted an expedited hearing,” the post said. “Today, 21 Savage was granted a release on bond. He won his freedom.” Mr. Abraham-Joseph, 26, was arrested in the early hours of Feb. 3 during an operation by federal and local law enforcement authorities in Atlanta, Immigration and Customs Enforcement said at the time. The agency said in a statement at the time that he was a British national who had entered the United States on a nonimmigrant visa in 2005 and was supposed to leave the following year. The agency also said that Mr. Abraham-Joseph was convicted of felony drug charges in Fulton County, Ga., in 2014. One of Mr. Abraham-Joseph’s lawyers, Charles Kuck, said that conviction was vacated and the charges were dismissed by prosecutors in 2018. A member of the rapper’s legal team, Dina LaPolt, said in a statement after his arrest that he had been “left without legal status through no fault of his own” because “as a minor, his family overstayed their work visas.” Mr. Kuck said his client was 12 when his immigration status expired. Mr. Abraham-Joseph was nominated for a Grammy Award for record of the year for “Rockstar,” a song with the rapper Post Malone, but did not win at the awards ceremony on Sunday. Known for his flat delivery and subdued rap style, his album “I Am > I Was” opened at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in January. Charles Kuck, another member of Mr. Abraham-Joseph’s legal team, said Tuesday that the rapper had been granted release but would have to spend one more night in custody. “We actually can’t get him out today because ICE stops taking money at 2 o’clock and the judge’s decision came down at around 2:15,” Mr. Kuck said. “He’ll be released in the morning.” Mr. Kuck declined to say what bail had been set at or where his client was being detained, but he said Mr. Abraham-Joseph had been treated well. “The facility where he has been held has been extraordinarily gracious to him, his legal team and his family,” Mr. Kuck said. “They have treated him well and we are grateful for their hospitality, as best as that can be in a jail cell.” A spokesman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. Mr. Abraham-Joseph’s next date in immigration court is set for April 11, Mr. Kuck said. The Facebook post from Mr. Abraham-Joseph’s lawyers on Tuesday said that he wanted to draw attention to immigration detainees who are not as well known as he is. “He will not forget this ordeal or any of the other fathers, sons, family members, and faceless people he was locked up with or that remain unjustly incarcerated across the country,” the post said. “And he asks for your hearts and minds to be with them.” "
5c5dce1e3a125f5075c08c49,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/08/arts/music/review-metropolitan-opera-donizetti-fille-camarena.html,"Javier Camarena has done it again. Any tenor singing Tonio, the hero of Donizetti’s “La Fille du Régiment,” has to knock off a string of nine high C’s in the joyous aria “Ah! mes amis.” On Thursday at the Metropolitan Opera, when “Fille” returned in Laurent Pelly’s production, Mr. Camarena’s breezy performance of the aria, complete with clarion, effortless high C’s, was so thrilling that the audience broke into an ecstatic ovation. So after exchanging glances with the conductor, Enrique Mazzola, Mr. Camarena sang it again: 18 high C’s for the price of nine. In recent years the Met has relaxed a longstanding policy against encores, and Mr. Camarena has earned several. This “Fille” comes as he seems to be inching away from his trademark florid bel canto roles into weightier vocal fare. Though this fall he sang well in Bizet’s “Les Pêcheurs de Perles,” he did not seem as comfortable then as he was during every moment as Tonio on Thursday. It’s a credit to the fine cast that Mr. Camarena did not steal the show entirely. The coloratura soprano Pretty Yende was wonderful as Marie, the orphaned baby who was adopted by a French army regiment and raised as their honorary daughter (hence the title). She has become an adored mascot to a roster of surrogate fathers. In this production, which updates the story to World War I, we see Ms. Yende’s Marie stomping through the camp in army pants and boots, and marching in place alongside the proud soldiers. She sang with gleaming sound, sparkling runs and lots of sass, as well as a gift for physical comedy. Some of the high jinks may have slightly pushed her voice, causing her pitch to slip during some softer passages. Still, this is one of her best Met roles to date. Ms. Yende and Mr. Camarena treat the story seriously, without a trace of mugging or winking. They were adorable during scenes of budding romance. Complications ensue when the Marquise of Berkenfield, here the commanding mezzo-soprano Stephanie Blythe, realizes that Marie is the daughter she abandoned at birth to avoid scandal, and hauls her off to teach her ladylike behavior. But young love wins out. Though there is quite a bit of spoken French dialogue in the piece, the Met’s cast pulled it off, including the veteran baritone Alessandro Corbelli as Sulpice, Marie’s protector in the regiment, and the gravelly voiced actress Kathleen Turner, wonderfully droll as the non-singing Duchess of Krakenthorp. Assuming he keeps singing on the same level, Mr. Camarena may well be prevailed upon to repeat his big aria in the remaining six performances of this run: 18 high C’s down, 108 to go. "
5c5dc22e3a125f5075c08c16,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/08/arts/music/review-robert-ashley-improvement-opera.html,"Robert Ashley’s “Improvement (Don Leaves Linda)” isn’t the first opera to have its heroine pathetically forsaken in an American desert. Puccini’s “Manon Lescaut” starts its final act in one, with the title character “alone, lost, abandoned,” as she cries in a majestic outpouring of an aria. The Linda of “Improvement” — which was written in the 1980s and is being given a soulfully austere revival at the Kitchen in Chelsea through Feb. 16 — doesn’t get to vent her feelings quite so extravagantly. For one thing, she’s left by Don, her husband, at a distinctly unoperatic locale: a highway turnoff. For another, her voice rarely rises much beyond the soft singsong-y speech that’s characteristic of Mr. Ashley’s mature works. Her most sweeping solo is a kind of monologue; she mulls in a quiet flood of gently rhythmic talk how she has “driven my husband from me by my complacency and my indifference.” [Read about the pleasures and perils of reviving Robert Ashley.] But even if Linda’s story never overtly expands far beyond the everyday — a coffee, a late-night rendezvous in a deli, a letter from her son she reads aloud — our 90 minutes with her and the people she comes across take on a lulling, mesmerizing grandeur as episodes and years pass. This is in large part because Gelsey Bell, the production’s Linda, has a silky yet focused voice that securely handles Mr. Ashley’s rush of wryly absurdist text. Her big, moist eyes shift from fear and sadness to a kind of consolation, weariness and resignation — from innocence to experience. This trajectory isn’t merely personal. “For the sake of argument,” the narrator (a recording of Mr. Ashley, who died in 2014) tells us near the beginning, “Don is Spain in 1492 and Linda is the Jews.” The various places and people in their path, moreover, represent figures and themes in the history of the Jewish people in the centuries since the Spanish expulsion. An airline ticket counter representative with a lot of questions is meant to evoke the Inquisition; the big city to which Linda eventually moves is, in the allegory, assimilation. If this seems like too much and too weird to take in on a first listen, it is. There’s little overt drama: The six performers sit at six small tables on platforms, recite-singing into microphones. (The change of scenes is evocatively captured in the saturated sky of a distant mountain range in the background of David Moodey’s set.) Many listeners will just perceive the alluringly enigmatic stories being told: Taken together, they’re a sun-baked, ominous American gothic that’s like a quieter version of Don DeLillo, Thomas Pynchon or Nathanael West. But even an initial brush with “Improvement” is an experience of hypnotic vocal virtuosity — the cast makes its way through an enormous quantity of words with choral synchronicity and stunning clarity — and emotional weight, rueful humor and a pleasant sense of bathing in idiosyncratic charm. Though we come to know Linda only in impressions and episodes, she comes sympathetically to life. “Improvement” was originally conceived as a recording. Tom Hamilton’s electronic background score — a cool, smoothly droning landscape marked by little pops, bits of flute, faint taps of steel drum and the occasional shimmer — was for a long time inextricable from the vocal tracks. So when the piece was done live, the performers essentially had to duet with their own recorded selves. For this new staging — developed by Mr. Ashley’s widow and longtime collaborator, Mimi Johnson, in conjunction with its cast (Ms. Bell, Brian McCorkle, Paul Pinto, Aliza Simons, Dave Ruder and Amirtha Kidambi) — the electronics have been created anew, and the performers have been freed. But Mr. Ashley always makes you think about being free — “if there is any meaning to that word,” as Linda says. His interpreters work under precise constraints, not least the steady pulse of 72 beats per minute that defined his essential works, including much of the tetralogy “Now Eleanor’s Idea,” of which “Improvement” is the first part. But within those restrictions, there is a universe of choices as to diction, emphasis, mood and volume to be explored in Mr. Ashley’s style, which is controlled yet capacious. There’s ample room for the adjustment and, perhaps, yes, improvement that is Linda’s story, and ours. "
5c571a9e3a125f5075c07ccd,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/03/arts/music/paris-opera-primo-omicidio-romeo-castellucci.html,"PARIS — You can’t always expect to understand the work of Romeo Castellucci. But you’re sure to be awed by its beauty. Especially when the Italian director — really, a polymathic theatrical artist — stages opera. His productions are rich in symbols and enigmas; each movement leads to a picture-perfect tableau. A “Moses und Aron” at the Paris Opera in 2015 dealt almost entirely in stark contrasts of black and white. “Salome,” at the Salzburg Festival last summer, placed its antiheroine in a pool of milk, serenading the severed head of a horse. Mr. Castellucci’s latest project, Scarlatti’s “Il Primo Omicidio” (“The First Homicide”), which continues at the Paris Opera’s Palais Garnier through Feb. 23, is tame by comparison: relatively direct, yet still striking.  “It’s a portrait of Cain,” Mr. Castellucci said of Scarlatti’s 1707 oratorio, an account of the Cain and Abel story, in an interview under the ornate chandeliers of the Garnier’s grand foyer. “But it’s really about innocence.” To that end, during the oratorio’s second part Mr. Castellucci removes the singers from the stage, placing them in the orchestra pit and nearby boxes, and replaces them with children miming the roles onstage. A story of jealousy and murder, in his telling, becomes one of rediscovering lost innocence, of adults in search of their youthful doppelgängers. Spoiler alert: They are found, eventually. But not before a journey abounding in imaginative stage magic — with layers of lighting and scrims, Mr. Castellucci conjures vast Rothko canvases that have the soft seamlessness of a James Turrell — reaches its end. Here is some of the production’s arresting imagery.  For the scene in which Eve learns she will be a mother, Mr. Castellucci thought of the Annunciation — the angel Gabriel delivering the news to the Virgin Mary that she would give birth to Jesus. So he turned to “Annunciation With St. Margaret and St. Ansanus,” an Italian Gothic triptych by Simone Martini and Lippo Memmi that now hangs in the Uffizi in Florence.  But he turned it upside down. As Eve sings of her coming motherhood, the massive altarpiece is lowered, slowly, above her head. “It’s a kind of guillotine,” Mr. Castellucci said. “A menace.” It’s difficult to keep track of how many scrims are in play at any given moment during the production. They seem to be constantly in motion: rising, falling, accompanied now and then by luminous rods and rotating objects obscured to the point of fuzziness.  At one point, a shapeless mound is inflated, eventually assuming the humanoid form of God. He is larger than life, appearing to exist in an ethereal void separate from Adam, Eve and their children. At the foot of the stage, he is more humbly presented, and sung, by the countertenor Benno Schachtner. Part I of “Il Primo Omicidio” exists in a surreal landscape. (Those Rothko homages, by the way, are from Mr. Castellucci’s interpretations of the painter’s color fields as landscapes.) Part II is more grounded. Literally. The curtain rises to reveal tall grasses and rocks. But the vista is still otherworldly; the night sky at the back of the stage feels extremely close, like the views of outer space from the tiny planets of “The Little Prince.”  The switch from adult singers to children happens the moment Cain murders Abel. “We are in the domain of childhood,” Mr. Castellucci said. “It is a childish mythology.”  Before the final scene of the production, in which the adult Adam and Eve rediscover their lost child doubles, Mr. Castellucci poignantly meditates on the afterlives of Cain and Abel.  For a brief moment, Abel rises from the dead and is recognized before he walks offstage alone and, we’re meant to feel, forgotten. Cain, shamed yet also crowned, is passed around a group of children in modern dress.  In the shuffle, Cain moves offstage as well. He’s replaced by a crudely shaped stuffed version of himself that is also passed around and sent offstage. By the end, the children are playing with a ball that still bears some resemblance to Cain: the lower half the same shade of brown as his pants, the middle and top the color of his skin and crown.  So Cain lives on. With each generation he is increasingly abstracted, but the power of his cautionary tale remains. "
5caf3aae49f0eacbf1f82c56,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/theater/playboy-club-playboy-live.html,"“Let’s be outrageous,” Brandon James Gwinn murmured into a microphone. “Let’s misbehave.” It was Monday night at the Playboy Club and everyone seemed to be behaving relatively well. People chatted, checked their phones, ate prawns served pink and prone on a bed of crushed ice, like sunbathers stranded atop some glacier. Besides, when a culture is grappling, however clumsily, with questions of sexual equality and power differentials, what would misbehavior look like anyway? Five of the Playboy Bunnies lined up, a fluffy-tailed choo-choo train, and demonstrated the bunny hop as the band played along. Everyone was invited to join in. Max Chernin, one of the evening’s guest performers, grabbed the nearest waist and gamely hop hop hopped. Would a conga line form? No. Mr. Chernin sat back down. This new iteration of the Playboy Club — New York’s original branch closed in 1986 — opened in September, just west of the theater district. With its velvet banquettes, black walls and Sputnik chandeliers it resembles a midcentury bordello. Every Monday since March 25 it has been hosting Playboy Live!, a showcase for Broadway talent that joins other off-night hotspots like Feinstein’s/54 Below, Birdland and, more recently, the Green Room 42 at the Times Square Yotel. Tuesdays are for backgammon. During the first set, in the dining room, Mr. Gwinn and the T-Shirt Tuxedo Trio, with Anne Fraser Thomas on vocals, purred jazz standards and a few torch songs, plus a bossa nova version of “I Could Have Danced All Night,” scrolling through the set list on an iPad. As Beau Speer, the evening’s producer, told me, the acoustics in that room don’t really favor belting. Then the band took a break, reforming a half-hour later in the lounge and leading off with “Man of La Mancha.” Generally and with a lot of exceptions, Broadway appeals to women and families, a demographic that wouldn’t seem to overlap with the Playboy brand. The magazine’s old cover line made it explicit: Entertainment for Men. A few days earlier I’d asked Nicole Levinson, the vice president of brand management and partnerships, if Playboy’s founder, Hugh Hefner, had been a show-tune enthusiast. “He was not himself a Broadway fan,” she said diplomatically. “He definitely supported performance.” As Diana Garcia, who was recently hired to program the club, said, “We want people to realize that it’s not about just these men in suits coming in having business meetings. It is about female empowerment.” Is that why Ms. Thomas and Tracy McDowell would later cover “Take Me or Leave Me” from “Rent”? The funny, awful, sorry-grateful thing about Playboy Live! is that it didn’t seem to be about anything or for anybody — not the couples on dates or the tables of all women or the coed friend groups or the child who was carried out of the dining room in mid-tantrum. (Apparently, you can bring a child to this Playboy Club. Should you? Depends how your child feels about arty bikini photos and olive fed Wagyu nigiri.) Is this the misbehavior Mr. Gwinn suggested? At dinner, no one applauded the trio, except for the other performers perched down front. One of them, Jen Sanchez, delivered an insinuating version of “I’ve Got You Under My Skin,” which sounded at least a little dirty. In the lounge, a few more tables leaned in. But most guests busied themselves taking selfies or talking to the Bunnies. Relentlessly pleasant, each Bunny wore a custom-tailored corset, bow-tie and heels. Though mostly decorative, a few set down drinks with the patented Bunny dip. Some were tall and some were short. Diversity. When a birthday was announced, five Bunnies lit sparklers and sang in almost harmony, making the club feel like a pheromone-spiked Señor Frog’s and maybe creating a fire hazard. In their earlier iteration, the Playboy Clubs were created by and for men, places where little and medium shots could feel like big ones and women could imply sex without having to deliver it. Now women can be members. Ms. Garcia told me that the club wants to welcome the L.G.B.T.Q. community, too. A newer magazine cover line reads: Entertainment for All. So if it isn’t selling men sex, what is Playboy selling? Probably not Ms. McDowell’s bouncy Barry Manilow cover. The brand has struggled with this for a while. In 2011, “The Playboy Club,” a Hefner-approved drama trading on nostalgia, lasted only three episodes. In 2015, the magazine announced that it would no longer include nude pictures. In 2017, just before Hefner died, nudity came back. The Playboy Club seems part of an obvious effort to rebrand — Ms. Levinson prefers language like “evolve” — Playboy into a more generic luxury property that honors its history but makes its cotton-tailed frisson available to all. (Although if you want to visit the Rabbit Hole, the speakeasy two floors below, you’ll need to pay at least $25,000 in annual membership fees.) Its current vision of empowerment still involves lacing women into those corsets and having them bunny hop — smiling, jiggling — a narrow definition of liberation. If the Playboy Club has an orientation, it is retrosexual. Late in the evening, the band struck up the bunny hop again and the Bunnies formed ranks. No one joined the dance. "
5c5092ad3a125f5075c06ec4,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/29/arts/music/aprile-millo-met-opera-new-york-zankel.html,"“It’s so perfect, it makes you want to cry,” the soprano Aprile Millo said, her eyes getting moist just thinking about it. She was sitting in a rehearsal room last week, talking about a song she was about to practice. It is on the program of her recital on Wednesday at Zankel Hall, her first in New York in 10 years. But Ms. Millo could also have been describing her voice: an instrument of easy, opulent power and fiery yet sumptuous phrasing, a moving recollection of the great Italian singers who ruled 60 or 70 years ago. It was a voice that thrilled the Metropolitan Opera through the 1980s and ’90s, when Ms. Millo was among the house’s reigning divas: the grandly emoting star of new productions, opening nights and TV broadcasts opposite Plácido Domingo and Luciano Pavarotti. Then, at what should have been the height of her career, things petered out. Her Met performances grew less frequent; she hasn’t appeared with the company since 2007. Over the past decade, she has barely sung in public at all. “There was a general feeling that her career had wound down at that point,” Peter Gelb, the Met’s general manger, said of her last performances. But it hadn’t, and hasn’t — at least not if Ms. Millo has something to say about it. At 60, she has her heart set on returning to the Met. “It’s not about voice; the voice has been functioning,” she insisted in an interview after the rehearsal. “But when you go through a lack of confidence, you’re not going to want to be anywhere.” So the audience on Wednesday will be listening closely: to hear the singer still treasured as among the most authentic contemporary exponents of the great Verdian tradition, and to hear whether she still has what it takes to command the Met. Ms. Millo says her instrument is ready; it’s her nerves and her appearance — a bit more ample than in her heyday — that she feels still need work. “I want it,” she said. “But I want to actually show up looking correct. I don’t want to offer excuses. My time will either come or it won’t. But I think God is moving me toward it.” Born to a pair of singers in New York in 1958, Ms. Millo was that rarity: an operatic prodigy, her sound alarmingly mature when she was still in elementary school. The art form in her household was always wrapped up in transformation. “They did the ‘Cavalleria Rusticana’ duet,” Ms. Millo said, “and they were no longer Mom and Dad.” Both parents and child embraced reinvention: Hamill was changed to Millo before she was born, and she turned April into Aprile, pronounced a-PREE-lay. She came of age on the West Coast, starring in musicals at Hollywood High School, then went on the classical competition circuit. She flourished. Auditioning when she was barely in her 20s for the New York City Opera, where her father had sung in the 1940s (and which is presenting her recital on Wednesday), she was offered major contracts. Big roles beckoned in Europe, too. Ms. Millo instead chose to enter the young artist program at the Met, where she studied, bided her time and found a champion in James Levine. A few outdoor performances of Verdi’s “Ernani” in the summer of 1984 excited connoisseurs, and her New York career was ready to ignite that December when she made an unexpected house debut — three weeks ahead of schedule — replacing a colleague in Verdi’s “Simon Boccanegra.” “It was like she came out of nowhere,” Michael Capasso, City Opera’s general director, recalled. “She sang that ‘Boccanegra’ — she was the cover — and the world was talking about her, literally overnight: ‘You’ve got to hear this woman.’” Among the fiercely opinionated opera fans who were the company’s grass roots, she swiftly became so beloved that the stage-right column in the Met’s Orchestra-level lobby is still known by some as the “Millo pole,” where you’d rush at intermission to kibitz about her performances. “For me,” the longtime artist manager and administrator Matthew Epstein said, “she was one of two female singers, what [the conductor Tullio] Serafin used to call vocal miracles, at the end of the 20th century: Borodina” — the Russian mezzo-soprano Olga Borodina — “and Aprile Millo.” “Aprile was a unique vocal phenomenon,” Mr. Epstein said. “And all of us who remembered what it was supposed to sound like love her very much for that.” Not everyone was on board. “Some operagoers,” the critic Susan Elliott wrote in 1990, “are still debating whether Millo is the real thing, or merely a collection of diva mannerisms.” But those “mannerisms,” vocal and physical gestures that might have seemed hopelessly old-fashioned coming from others, seemed, when Ms. Millo did them, the very embodiment of opera’s origins. This gave her performances an uncanny, seance-like aspect, even as they also felt wholly fresh — the voice healthy and secure — and deeply felt. “There was a ‘Tosca’ performance,” Ms. Millo recalled, “and I left the stage, and I fully expected to see the Palazzo Farnese when I went through the door. I was truly there.” She had triumphs through the Verdi canon — “Don Carlo,” “Il Trovatore,” “Aida,” “Otello,” “Un Ballo in Maschera,” “Luisa Miller” — as well as in “Tosca” and “Andrea Chénier.” She starred in the Met premiere of Verdi’s “I Lombardi” in 1993, a run she points to as perhaps the start of her troubles. A deviated septum temporarily changed her hearing, making her, she said, “uncharacteristically cautious” and leading to rumors of vocal problems. A “Mefistofele” in 1999, canceled at the last minute when she had acid reflux after drinking lemonade, made her seem unreliable. “And then we run into ‘You’re not glamorous enough,’ and I got heavy,” Ms. Millo said, fearing there was no place for her in an operatic culture increasingly focused on HD cinema broadcasts. She grew perilously indecisive about engagements. “She is like every gifted artist: full of issues, full of fears,” Mr. Epstein said. “Aprile is gripped by fear, and it is very hard for her to get past it.” Which is not to say she has been silent. She has given master classes and been generous with guidance for young singers, and has appeared in concert here and there. Mr. Gelb, who started at the Met in 2006, said, “Over the course of my tenure, I’ve received an occasional email from her, that she’s working toward getting back to singing and she’ll let me know when she’s ready.” Is she? “I feel that there’s still opera in her,” said Robert Lombardo, a veteran artist manager. “I don’t think she’s going to go out there and sing Giselda” — in “I Lombardi” — “but there are roles she can certainly get into the voice, and it depends on her will and how much she wants to do.” He mentioned Cilea’s “L’Arlesiana,” and “Andrea Chénier.” “I think she still has a couple of miles left in her to do it the right way,” he said. Mr. Gelb is more doubtful. “I think it’s unlikely,” he said, “given the length of time she’s been away and that she hasn’t been singing on major stages. But nothing’s impossible.” “If she were to suddenly have the goods vocally to sing on the stage of the Met,” he added, “we would put her on the stage of the Met.” And that is where Ms. Millo wants to be. “I would like to salute that house one more time,” she said. “Because it has great spirits and a need for something that is a little bit demented.” “I don’t want it to end with: ‘She was great and she was on the scene; where’d she go?’” she added. “I want to end nicely. I want to have a good last act. The first act was so good; it would be nice to have a good last act.” "
5c4df9b83a125f5075c06940,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/27/arts/music/met-opera-bluebeard-iolanta-review.html,"In the gray depths of a New York winter, it was an aptly gray couple of days at the Metropolitan Opera. First, on Thursday, the opening of a revival of the company’s bleak, brooding double bill of Tchaikovsky’s “Iolanta” and Bartok’s “Bluebeard’s Castle,” inspired by black and white film. Then, on Friday, Debussy’s “Pelléas et Mélisande,” which, in Jonathan Miller’s staging, runs the visual gamut from slate to putty. Drab weather, outside and in. But the sense of grayishness in the “Iolanta”/“Bluebeard” pairing — and in “Pelléas,” for that matter, almost at the end of its run this season — extended past the designs. Both operas were populated with intelligently, earnestly emoting singers whose voices were often unable to put across a strong sense of character or drama. “Iolanta,” a fairy tale about a princess whose blindness is cured by love, is a tricky piece, quivering between tender delicacy and robustly tuneful grandeur. In his Met debut, the conductor Henrik Nanasi didn’t yet seem in control of this balance, and the score felt merely mild, without the feverish vividness Valery Gergiev brought to the company’s performances in 2015. The soprano Sonya Yoncheva was an extraordinary Iolanta when I heard her sing the role in Paris three years ago. Her presence is still sensitive and soft-grained, if less specific and moving than in 2016, but her voice has grown less dependable. Its slender clarity has taken on a more pronounced flutter; her tone feels narrower and harder, yet also fainter. That she doesn’t summon the surging phrases of her duet with Vaudémont, the prince who falls for her, means that her victory doesn’t come fully to life; the opera’s stakes remain lukewarm. While I cherish the moments she underplays — her aria after her blindness is revealed to her (it’s a long story) is a wistful monologue, not a vocal showcase — Ms. Yoncheva’s pale Iolanta means a pale “Iolanta.” Alexey Dolgov, a late replacement for Matthew Polenzani as Vaudémont; Alexey Markov, as his friend Robert; and Vitalij Kowaljow, as Iolanta’s father, King René: All good, the rest of the cast also never quite summoned coloristic richness. The bass Harold Wilson was very fine — secure and resonant — in the smaller role of Bertrand. The double bill’s director, Mariusz Trelinski, slyly creates connection between “Iolanta,” with its triumphant ending, and the grimly pessimistic “Bluebeard,” a Symbolist drama about a very fraught honeymoon. There are some scenic parallels, and the final beat of his “Iolanta” staging darkly suggests that King René — who has kept his daughter hidden for years, ostensibly for her own good — is of a piece with Bluebeard, whose desire to control a series of wives takes a homicidal turn. While a virtuosic and difficult orchestral assignment, “Bluebeard” is also, in a way, more straightforward in mood than “Iolanta,” and in the Bartok, Mr. Nanasi more confidently elicited fluent, flexible playing, the winds slithery but strong. In Angela Denoke and Gerald Finley, the Met has cast two perceptive singers as Judith and Bluebeard. Neither strained nor sounded ugly, but neither could summon the power to project over a seething orchestra. The result was a performance more politely eerie than properly harrowing. It should be noted, for those planning evenings with lovers, that the run of this double bill ends on Feb. 14. What could be a more pleasant outing? “Kiss me,” Bluebeard orders his wife, not long before she drifts into the underworld: “No more questions.” Happy Valentine’s Day! "
5ca60e4249f0eacbf1f80e24,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/04/theater/titus-andronicus.html,"A Shakespeare play is a dangerous place. Swords can kill you. So can poison, grief and bears. Eleven corpses crowd the stage in “Richard III.” “King Lear” does away with 10 characters. But at 14 deaths, “Titus Andronicus” — with its beheadings, live burial and disgustful approach to pastry-making — takes the Shakespearean cake. T.S. Eliot called “Titus Andronicus” “one of the stupidest and most uninspired plays ever written.” That doesn’t mean it hasn’t inspired others. The image of a mother made to eat her children was hard to shake, and a couple of decades after its 1594 premiere, artists had already begun to appropriate — O.K., fine, cannibalize — its plot for uses comic, tragic and savagely satirical. Directors have staged it with almost no gore and with nothing but gore. It has been modernized, musicalized, performed by puppets and adapted to Kabuki. Stephen K. Bannon sent it into space. Its blood has spattered everything from bootleg Dutch tragedies to Japanese anime to “Game of Thrones.” “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt” gifted us the character Titus Andromedon, played by Tituss Burgess. (His rival: Coriolanus Burt.) Now comes Taylor Mac’s “Gary: A Sequel to Titus Andronicus,” which picks up, figuratively and literally, after the final murders. It opens on April 21 at Broadway’s Booth Theater. But before audiences tally whether Mac outdoes Shakespeare on the body count, let’s look back at some of the play’s more memorable appearances in culture, pop and otherwise. In the mid 19th century, the African-American actor Ira Aldridge and the English playwright C.A. Somerset collaborated on a new version that transformed Aaron, a Moor and the lover of the barbarian queen Tamora, from villain to hero, subverting racial stereotype. Aldridge and Somerset cut out most of the carnage and interpolated at least one scene from a contemporary melodrama that Aldridge had also starred in. Aldridge’s opinion: “I will venture to say that there is not a play on the stage with a more powerful climax.” A Scottish critic praised Aldridge’s performance as Aaron as “remarkable for energy, tempered by dignity and discretion.” A British horror comedy beloved of theater reviewers and the people who hate them. “Theater of Blood” stars Vincent Price as Edward Kendal Sheridan Lionheart, a depraved classical actor, bad in every sense. After faking his death Lionheart revenges himself on his critics, with murders inspired by Shakespeare. After executing six critics and convincing a seventh to kill his wife Othello-style, Lionheart turns to “Titus Andronicus” to snuff the eighth. Meredith Merridew (Robert Morley), who refers to his poodles as babies, is invited onto a cooking show and served a pie. No prizes for guessing the filling. Lionheart suffocates him with the crust. Stephen Sondheim’s Tony-winning chiller, written with Hugh Wheeler, doesn’t directly descend from Shakespeare. An adaptation of Christopher Bond’s 1973 play, its key source is a gristly 19th-century penny dreadful, “The String of Pearls: A Romance,” which describes a homicidal barber and the baker Mrs. Lovett, his unsavory accomplice. Still, the revenge plot, with its abductions and threats of rape, echoes “Titus Andronicus” and the use of human mincemeat as the symbol of ultimate inhumanity smacks of homage. As Mrs. Lovett sings, “It’s man devouring man, my dear/And who are we to deny it here.” Heiner Müller, the experimental German playwright who specialized in grimly absurdist Shakespeare rewrites, refashioned “Titus Andronicus” as a postmodern, postcolonial debauch. His version lays bare the violence of the original (arguably pretty bare already) while reframing it as a political allegory of how wealthier nations exploit impoverished ones. Drawing on the 1973 Chilean coup and a divided Berlin, Müller explores the failure of culture and human progress to make the world a less brutalized place. As one character says, “Poetry is murder.” Before Mr. Bannon became Donald J. Trump’s chief strategist, he fell for another populist leader, albeit one with more military experience: Titus. The play obsessed him and in the early ’90s, he and the screenwriter Julia Jones collaborated on an interplanetary adaptation of “Titus Andronicus.” Here, Titus is the leader of the Andronicii, incorporeal beings who come to earth and take on human form. Shakespeare never included erotic scenes of ectoplasmic sex. Mr. Bannon did. Shockingly, studios passed. He and Ms. Jones also rewrote “Coriolanus” as a rap musical set during the Los Angeles riots. Though Mr. Bannon’s space guignol wouldn’t fly, he is listed as an executive producer on Julie Taymor’s 1999 film version of the tragedy, which reset the play in a Rome both ancient and modern. Anthony Hopkins said that his Titus referenced both King Lear and Hannibal Lecter, another character with outré taste in fine dining. Reviews were generally positive, with a Times critic writing that the movie “makes the best possible argument for a cautionary drama that contemplates the absolute worst in us.” But not only Rome loses big in “Titus.” The movie cost $25 million and made back just $2 million at the box office. In the 69th episode of “South Park,” a middle schooler, Scott Tenorman, convinces Cartman to buy his pubic hair. When his friends set Cartman straight on how puberty actually works, Cartman asks for his money back. Then he vows revenge. After various plans fail, including one involving guest stars Radiohead, Cartman arranges for the murder of Scott’s parents, lures Scott to a Chile Con Carnival and feeds him a dastardly bowl of chili. “Nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah, I made you eat your parents,” Cartman gloats. Founded in 2005, Titus Andronicus, which now styles itself +@, is a post-punk Brooklyn outfit led by Patrick Stickles. The name celebrates Shakespeare’s crowd-pleasing appeal and if serving a mother the pastry-encased corpses of her children isn’t punk rock, I mean what even is? The band’s first song on their debut album, 2008’s “The Airing of Grievances,” quotes liberally from Aaron’s Act V speech. Their fourth album, 2015’s “The Lamentable Tragedy,” a 29-song rock opera about Mr. Stickles’s manic depression, name-checks the “Titus Andronicus” title page in the 1623 folio, though honestly quarto editions are way more rock ’n’ roll.

5c40e9303a125f5075c04fcd,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/fashion/rihanna-fashion-brand-lvmh.html,"Is Rihanna the Coco Chanel of the 21st century? Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton LVMH, the parent company of Dior, Givenchy and Fendi, apparently thinks so. It is in the midst of a deal to back her in a fashion brand, making her the first female designer of color at the largest luxury conglomerate in the world. The news, confirmed by sources within the group who were not authorized to speak for the company, was first reported by WWD. Neither LVMH nor Rihanna would comment, though the singer has recently been photographed on the street wearing a “mystery” pair of oversize Fenty-branded square sunglasses hinting at what may be to come. While the details of the agreement remain unclear, it is a turning point in both fashion and fame. The combination of Fenty and LVMH will be the clearest expression yet of how celebrity, social media and influencers have redefined the power balance between culture and consumption, changing the way brands of all kinds relate to their audience.  It is not insignificant that despite the number of well-known and respected designers currently unemployed in the fashion world, including Alber Elbaz, Stefano Pilati and Peter Copping, the dominant luxury group decided to put its money where a pop star was. Robyn Rihanna Fenty, one of the defining musical artists of the millennium and a multi-hyphenate talent, has no formal fashion training. What she does have is a clear vision for her own image, 14 No. 1 singles on the Billboard 100 chart and more than 50 Top 40 hits, 67 million Instagram followers, and an ability to disrupt the status quo. Now that the elite fashion world is in disarray, splintered by the rise of the street, direct communication and a growing awareness of its lack of diversity, there is little wonder that LVMH would see in Rihanna a potential way forward. The company first became aware of the power of her base when it signed her to Kendo, its beauty subsidiary, in 2017. (Kendo produces cosmetics for Sephora, also owned by LVMH, as well as other outlets.)  The runaway success of Fenty Beauty, premised on addressing a diverse array of skin tones — and which itself already has 6.3 million Instagram followers — astonished the group. The line changed what consumers demanded from their makeup and was named one of Time magazine’s 25 Best Inventions of 2017.  Discussions began internally at LVMH with Bernard Arnault, the chief executive, about what could happen next. Though the group had had various conversations over the years about building a brand from scratch, it had not done so since Christian Lacroix in 1987 because of the cost involved. (Lacroix was sold in 2005.) It preferred to buy already established names. Unlike most new designers, however, Rihanna had a public profile that was as fully formed and global as any heritage brand. She came to the attention of the fashion industry early on, singing at a Gucci fund-raiser at the United Nations in 2008, and quickly understood the power of style to magnify her messages and help her transcend the limits of the music world. In 2011, she began working with the stylist Mel Ottenberg, and an adventurous, self-aware style that encompassed looks by emerging designers as well as runway names like Lanvin and Givenchy began to emerge. In 2014, she was named fashion icon of the year at the Council of Fashion Designers of America awards, where she appeared in a sheer crystal-spangled Adam Selman dress and matching cap, a white fur wrap strategically draped around her body, setting off a so-called naked trend in red carpet dressing. The next year, at the Met Gala, she wore a giant yellow cape from the Chinese designer Guo Pei, and enshrined her skill at making an entrance. Even though Rihanna became the face of Dior’s Secret Garden scent in 2015 (making her its first black brand ambassador), she never aligned herself with a single brand; they served her purposes, rather than the other way around.  The fact that she signed a deal with Puma to be its creative director and start her own ready-to-wear brand in 2014, when the sportswear giant was still owned by Kering, an LVMH rival, and for a time worked with both groups simultaneously (an unprecedented arrangement) reflects the shift in status. Suddenly a celebrity could have the upper hand. Last September, she introduced her lingerie collection, Fenty x Savage, at New York Fashion Week, where it made waves for including a wide range of body types and colors.  Her ambitions for her brand were perhaps matched only by those of Kanye West, who first made forays into Paris back in 2011 and interned for a while at Fendi, and whose Yeezy brand is backed by Adidas. Though Mr. West once declared his desire to design for Hermès and claimed he had been in talks with LVMH that fell through, he has stepped away from the formal catwalk in recent seasons to focus more on street wear and selling directly to consumers.  (It was Virgil Abloh, his former creative director, who ended up going to Paris. He was named men’s wear designer of Louis Vuitton in March 2018.) Other celebrities have made the move into fashion, using the red carpet as a springboard to legitimacy. But what has set them apart, whether it’s Victoria Beckham or Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen at The Row, is that they have done so in part by renouncing their low culture past and humbly pledging their troth to design.  After all, industry wisdom says that to be a “real” designer, individuals must dedicate themselves to the craft. (Otherwise they are just Jessica Simpson.) Also, those designers started — and remain — small and independent. By contrast, Rihanna, who starred in last summer’s “Ocean’s 8,” appears to understand how her various platforms and outlets for expression can complement one another, and shows no interest in abandoning any of them. LVMH has presumably not asked her to. There are still outstanding questions around just what shape her brand will take, where it will be based and how the relationship with LVMH will be structured. Even what it will be named.  But what is certain is that Rihanna’s first catwalk show or extravaganza or concert, or whatever it turns out to be, will be appointment viewing far beyond the often insular fashion world. And she now has the potential to set not only style trends, but also a trend in what managers, agents, executives and kids thinking about their future imagine is possible.  Last May, as a host of the Met Gala celebrating the show “Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination,” the — what to call her? designer? creative phenomenon? imagemeister? — made her entrance in a heavily embroidered Martin Margiela bustier minidress, grand overcoat and miter, and was crowned on social media as the pope of fashion.  From the vantage point of today, it looks like a sign of things to come. "

5c4711f53a125f5075c05a54,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/22/arts/music/chris-brown-rape-paris-allegation.html,"PARIS — The R&B singer Chris Brown was released without charges on Tuesday after he was questioned by the Paris police over a rape accusation, according to the authorities and his lawyer. Shortly afterward, Mr. Brown said in a message on his Instagram account that the accusations were “false” and that his accuser was “lying.” Mr. Brown, 29, had been taken into custody on Monday for questioning about an accusation of aggravated rape and possible drug infractions. Reports in the French news media said that an investigation had been opened after a woman filed a complaint with the Paris police, accusing him of raping her at his hotel last week after they met at a nightclub in the capital. The Paris prosecutor’s office said on Tuesday evening that Mr. Brown had been released without charges but that the investigation was continuing. Mr. Brown’s lawyer in Paris, Raphael Chiche, confirmed that his client had been released but did not comment further on the allegations against him. On his official Instagram page, Mr. Brown posted a picture on Tuesday evening that said “This b!tch lyin’,” an image he had used before in reference to a previous accusation in the United States. In the caption for the picture, Mr. Brown wrote in all caps that he wanted to “make it perfectly clear” that “this is false.” “For my daughter and my family this is so disrespectful and is against my character and morals,” he wrote. According to the celebrity-news magazine Closer, which first reported Mr. Brown’s detention, his questioning came after a woman in her 20s filed a complaint against him. The woman, who was not identified, accused Mr. Brown of raping her in a Paris hotel room last week, the magazine said. The woman told the police that she met the singer on Jan. 15 at a nightclub near the Champs-Élysées and that later that evening, he invited her and several other women to the upscale Mandarin Oriental hotel, where he was staying, Closer reported. According to the magazine, the woman told the police that she then found herself alone in one of the hotel’s rooms, where she said Mr. Brown raped her. She also accused a friend of the singer and his bodyguard of raping her. The Paris prosecutor’s office said on Tuesday evening that two other people who had been questioned by police in connection with the case had also been released without charges, but it did not identify them or explain their connection to Mr. Brown, who has been attending shows in the city for Paris Men’s Fashion Week. Mr. Brown’s record company, RCA, which said this month that it had signed a new deal with Mr. Brown, did not respond to a request for comment. Last week RCA dropped another of its R&B stars, R. Kelly, after protests that followed the airing of the television documentary “Surviving R. Kelly.” In the documentary, women said that Mr. Kelly had lured them into sexual relationships when they were underage, and had abused them mentally and physically. Mr. Brown has been involved in a string of violent episodes over the past few years. In July, he was arrested in connection with a nightclub dispute from April 2017, when he was accused of punching a photographer in Tampa, Fla. In May, a woman sued him, saying he held her against her will at his Los Angeles house last year while a friend of his raped her. He was arrested in 2016 on a charge of assault with a deadly weapon after a standoff at his home. In 2009, he pleaded guilty to one count of felony assault on his girlfriend at the time, the singer Rihanna. Despite his legal troubles, Mr. Brown has remained popular with an ardent fan base. He has won several industry prizes, including the 2012 Grammy for best R&B album for “F.A.M.E.,” and he performed at that year’s Grammy ceremony. His most recent album, “Heartbreak on a Full Moon,” opened at No. 3 on the Billboard album chart in late 2017. In 2010, according to the BBC, Mr. Brown was forced to postpone a British tour after he was denied a visa to enter the country because of the assault conviction involving Rihanna. In 2015, he was forced to cancel the Australian and New Zealand leg of his “One Hell of a Nite” tour for the same reason. Earlier that year, he was barred from leaving the Philippines for three days because of a fraud complaint stemming from a 2014 New Year’s Eve concert in that country. "
5c832e7b49f0eacbf105c2c8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/arts/television/r-kelly-gayle-king-interview-cbs.html,"“Is this camera on me?” R. Kelly’s line, in the midst of his 80-minute interview with CBS’s Gayle King about his charges of sexual abuse, was the opening lyric of one of the most bizarre and unhinged performances of the R&B singer’s career. He shrieked into the camera: “You’re killing me, man!” He smacked his fist into his palm. He beat his chest. He paced and stabbed the air and seemed as if he might lose physical control. (Ms. King later said that she didn’t worry that the singer would harm her, but she thought that “I might get accidentally clobbered.”) He kept on rambling even as his handlers tried to soothe him and reapplied his makeup, as if administering to a boxer between rounds. The obvious question, after Mr. Kelly’s Tuesday meltdown replayed for days, finally becoming a CBS prime time special Friday night, was: Why would he agree to this? How could he imagine this might possibly help him? But you can infer the motivation from that “Is this camera on me?” Whether consciously or by habit, Mr. Kelly saw the chance to turn an interview into a solo show. Earlier this year, the Lifetime docu-series “Surviving R. Kelly,” which laid out an extensive case that Mr. Kelly preyed upon women and underage girls, showed how he used the intimate investment of fandom to escape consequences. (Mr. Kelly has denied all sexual abuse allegations.) [Read more: R. Kelly, Michael Jackson and the Lingering Questions About Child Sex Abuse Cases] There was an audience out there — fans who had heard his songs at weddings and graduations — and if he could summon up a barnburner of emotion, maybe he could get the crowd on his side one more time. He believed he could flee. But a network-TV interview while you’re facing criminal charges is not the same as performing a tribute ballad at Whitney Houston’s funeral. (Last month in Chicago Mr. Kelly was charged with 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse; he has pleaded not guilty.) The raging, self-pitying R. Kelly on this stage only recalled the threatening, controlling R. Kelly described in “Surviving,” which CBS’s special drew heavily on (including an interview with its producer Dream Hampton). Mr. Kelly’s breakdown got most of the attention, but we shouldn’t overlook what Ms. King did. Rather than match his volume, she addressed Mr. Kelly, whose first name is Robert, calmly and firmly, the way you would a tantrum: “Robert. Robert.” Just as important, she recognized that Mr. Kelly was trying to use the interview to claim a soapbox. “Robert, we have to have a conversation,” she said, as he continued to hold forth, looking past her into the lens. “I don’t want you just ranting at the camera.” Her impassive body language said it all. She was not going to engage on his level; he would have to come to hers. She was not going to indulge another man talking over and around and to the side of her, trying to shout and aggress and ugly-cry his way out of trouble. The editing of the segment underscored her point, cutting to a longer-range side view to deny Mr. Kelly the direct-to-camera soliloquy he was trying to have. The image of him, shot from a low angle, aggrieved and slashing the air, revealed Mr. Kelly’s desperate isolation like a portrait tableau. Friday’s special didn’t reveal new moments from the interview as stunning as the ones already replayed all week. (In one new clip, Mr. Kelly explained his visit to McDonald’s after posting bail, offering perhaps the least-wanted endorsement in America: “When it comes to McDonald’s that M stands for Mom.”) It also excerpted Ms. King’s earlier interview with two women, Azriel Clary and Joycelyn Savage, who denied that Mr. Kelly was keeping them captive in his home — though, as Ms. King noted, Mr. Kelly was present for the entire interview, coughing loudly and making his presence known. Maybe more valuable, the special provided context for the viral clips: the history of the abuse and “sex cult” charges against Mr. Kelly; interviews with accusers and their family members; background from experts and the Chicago music journalist Jim DeRogatis, who pursued the case for two decades. These sections, as “Surviving” did at greater length, got at the question of how an accused abuser could escape consequences for so long. But you could also look to Mr. Kelly’s all-too-familiar responses in the interview. The multiple, detailed accusations, he said, were “rumor,” the women were “lying” and “scorned.” His fury may have been jaw-dropping — but all this had worked for him, and other men, before. Last fall, his future clouded by a sexual assault charge, Brett M. Kavanaugh roared his way onto the Supreme Court on national TV. The face-off between the wrathful Mr. Kelly and the stoic Ms. King was a clash of temperaments. But it was also a collision of eras: the moment of the reckoning coming face-to-face with decades of impunity. At one point, Mr. Kelly asked about his accusers, “Why now?” “Because we’re in a different time where women are speaking out,” Ms. King said. The times may have caught up with R. Kelly. Maybe his loss of control was a recognition of that. But at other times, he spoke like he believed he had history on his side. “I guarantee you,” he told Ms. King, “that I’m going to come out of this like I did before.” "
5c3797803a125f5075c03c75,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/10/arts/music/review-aida-carmen-met-opera.html,"It speaks to the general high quality of the Metropolitan Opera these days that performances like this week’s “Aida” are rare. Yes, in the 21st century there may be fewer deliriously great nights at the opera than there once were. (Though try to get a ticket to the Met’s “Adriana Lecouvreur,” if you want a taste of what those were like.) But if the highs have winnowed, so have the lows. You’re far less likely than you were even 15 or 20 years ago to be embarrassed by the company — to face what opera fanatics call, with fascinated disdain, filth. The befuddled casts thrown together for the season’s umpteenth “La Bohème.” The routinier conductors. The creaky sets. These all used to be far too common, but the Met under Peter Gelb, its general manager since 2006, chugs along with more professionalism. We can argue about stagings and singers, but the operation overall is solid. Sometimes, though, you get a whiff of the bad old days, like a sudden glimpse of the seedy, pre-Disney Times Square. That was the perverse glory of the “Aida” on Monday. Returning for four performances after a starry run in the fall — followed by three more, with a new cast, later in the winter — the show stumbled from start to finish. Summoning a quartet of great Verdi singers — soprano, mezzo-soprano, tenor and baritone — isn’t easy, but there’s no reason a major opera house should go 0 for 4. The tenor Yonghoon Lee fared best of the central foursome as Radamès, but apart from a loud, tightly ringing high register, his sound lost energy lower down and tended to thin into a croon at anything softer than a scream. Roberto Frontali’s voice lacked focus as it delved into Amonasro’s baritonal depths. The mezzo Dolora Zajick, who has been singing Amneris at the Met for 30 years, is, at 66, a wonder of longevity. But her once-mighty volume has faded, other than an occasional forced burst of blunt power, leaving only her stolid, vaguely querulous portrayal of this complex character. Making her Met debut as Aida, a role she’s sung around the world, the soprano Kristin Lewis lacked vocal fullness and color; her performance gave the impression of a faint pencil sketch of the part. (Sondra Radvanovsky was originally scheduled, but canceled on Christmas Eve.) The bass Soloman Howard, as the King, was the only one onstage with a dependably steady, clear, penetrating sound. This muted ensemble was presided over with brisk facelessness by the conductor Nicola Luisotti, who gave little sense of the majestic atmosphere that should fill the work’s civic scenes, nor of the urgency of the personal drama. It was a vexed evening all around. Ms. Lewis seemed to be nearly crushed by a lowering set before “Ritorna vincitor.” The amplification of the offstage priests in the Judgment Scene was distorted, resulting in weird sibilants blaring from above the proscenium. Even one of the horses in the Triumphal Scene bridled hard, all too ready to bolt the stage. Indeed, the only real highlight of the performance was a single note: Ms. Lewis ended that Triumphal Scene with a high E flat, an octave above what Verdi wrote. This flashy interpolation didn’t really exist in opera lovers’ imaginations before Maria Callas was captured doing it in pirated, widely circulated live recordings from Mexico City in the early 1950s. Since then, some Aidas have added the note, but it remains unusual enough that I hadn’t heard it in person until Monday; for that, I thank Ms. Lewis, even if her clean, brief E flat was far from a resonant, Callas-style spear. I recognize that sometimes repertory staples deep in the season return to the stage with precious little rehearsal. But with some in the audience paying hundreds of dollars for tickets, there’s no excuse for something like this. And besides, Bizet’s “Carmen” came back for nine performances on Wednesday — like “Aida,” after a run in the fall — in considerably better shape. Not that everything went smoothly for “Carmen,” either. The turntable that rotates the Act I set of Richard Eyre’s production was broken, so it needed to be essentially restaged on the fly. Under the baton of Louis Langrée, the children’s chorus got painfully away from the orchestra near the beginning, and balances were sometimes off: At the end of “Les tringles des sistres tintaient,” in Act II, you could barely hear the melody. But things settled down — and the turntable functioned at its next appearance, at the very end of the opera. Don José has been one of the tenor Roberto Alagna’s best Met roles, and he sounded youthfully inflamed on Wednesday, stronger than when he opened the company’s season with a painfully unsteady performance of “Samson et Dalila” in September. (He, too, settled down later in that run.) Mr. Alagna’s onstage presence has become more subdued than it used to be: I wanted more obvious unraveling, more physical heat from this “Carmen,” as I did from his paternal turns in “Cavalleria Rusticana” and “Pagliacci” a year ago. But by the end of “Carmen,” his quiet ferocity — a homicidal explosion of what we’d now call toxic masculinity — was chilling. Aleksandra Kurzak’s soprano vibrates with feeling as Micaëla; Alexander Vinogradov is a sturdy Escamillo. Anchoring the performance was the mezzo Clémentine Margaine, arrestingly stern and articulate in the title role. Her voice doesn’t bloom, but it darkly insinuates, like a clarinet. And she portrays a disconcertingly changeable, mordant yet (seemingly genuinely) hopeful Carmen, rising to stony grandeur in the final duet. She puts vocal prowess at the service of a creative, personal conception of the character: If only there was any of that in the Met’s woeful “Aida.” "
5c48a5303a125f5075c05e62,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/23/theater/michael-jackson-musical-chicago.html,"The Michael Jackson musical is taking its first steps onto the dance floor. The show’s producers announced Wednesday that the project, now titled “Don’t Stop ’Til You Get Enough,” will have an initial production this fall in Chicago, running Oct. 29 to Dec. 1 at the James M. Nederlander Theater. The musical will focus on the period of time leading up to Jackson’s “Dangerous World Tour,” which began in 1992, according to a spokesman, confirming details first reported by The Chicago Tribune. It will feature a book by Lynn Nottage, a two-time Pulitzer winner for the plays “Ruined” and “Sweat,” and direction and choreography by Christopher Wheeldon, who won a Tony Award for the choreography of “An American in Paris.” The musical is being produced by the Michael Jackson Estate and Columbia Live Stage, and the producers said they are aiming to bring it to Broadway next year.

5ca0dfdd49f0eacbf1f7afbf,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/31/nyregion/woodstock-festival-1969-stage-souvenir.html,"[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] In this year of 50th anniversaries — astronauts walking on the moon, “Sesame Street” premiering on television and the Mets winning their first World Series, to name only three — Steve Gold has what he says is the biggest souvenir from one of the biggest happenings of all: the stage from Woodstock. “It was the focal point,” said Mr. Gold, who was 15 when more than 350,000 people descended on a field in Bethel, N.Y., about 15 miles from where he grew up. It was, after all, where the Who, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Sly and the Family Stone, Janis Joplin and Richie Havens performed. Mr. Gold was in the crowd. As a local, he was not stuck in traffic on the New York State Thruway, as so many were. “I went back and forth every day because I knew the back roads,” he said. “Not that many people knew the back roads, but I was able to go in and out as I pleased.” After Jimi Hendrix delivered his electrifying performance of “The Star-Spangled Banner” and the crowd left, Woodstock became history. Now there is a museum at the site with psychedelic-looking exhibits. There is a stone marker. “I call it the tomb of the unknown hippie,” Duke Devlin, a longtime “site interpreter” for the museum, declared in a museum video. “Looks like a grave.” Last year, when archaeologists combed the field for five days — one day longer than the festival itself — Spin magazine mused: “Perhaps they would find an old peace symbol? Or a strand of hippie beads? Or Jimi Hendrix’s guitar pick?” Mr. Gold had no such thoughts when he went home from Woodstock in 1969. He figured what he had witnessed was just another rock concert. “For Sullivan County, it was a big to-do,” Mr. Gold said, “but it didn’t seem like this worldwide big to-do.” The big to-do for him was a girl named Robin, whose parents owned a bungalow colony with cottages they rented out during the summer and repaired before the weather turned cold. “What happens after Labor Day is you start renovating or adding additions for the following season,” he said. “My girlfriend’s father was building a little sports area, like basketball hoops and a paddleball court.” One day, Mr. Gold went by to watch. “I want to be nice to the father because I’m dating his daughter,” he said, retelling the story. “He asks if I would help him unload wood from his pickup truck. I say O.K. They’re these plywood panels. He says, ‘I bought these panels at Yasgur’s farm because they were selling everything from the concert, and this was the stage. I bought part of the stage.’ I said, ‘O.K.’ I was like, so what, I’m here because of your daughter, whatever.” He did not imagine that the moment would replay itself someday, but a couple of years ago, it did, in one of those middle-of-the night moments when things come to mind out of nowhere. He was lying in bed. “I didn’t tell my wife I was thinking about my first love,” he said. “But I thought, ‘I remember Robin’s dad telling me he was building the paddleball court with wood from the stage.’” Soon Mr. Gold, who lives in New City, made the drive to Woodbourne, where Robin’s father’s bungalow colony had been, and he and a friend went looking for the paddleball court. The compound had fallen into disrepair and was overgrown. After wandering around, disoriented, he was ready to give up the search. “My friend says, ‘What’s that all the way deep, deep in the woods?’” he said. “I go, ‘I don’t know, but I don’t remember it being that far away.’” They pushed through the brush, crossing a stream that seemed as wide as the Mississippi River. There it was. “The same exact paddleball court that I remember,” he said. He could not be sure it was the court he had watched Robin’s father put together with the boards from Woodstock. Without explaining why, he asked the owners — Robin’s parents had long since sold the place — if he could pull off a couple of the wooden panels. He said they thought it was a strange request, but they agreed. “I saw a lot of the markings that you see in the Woodstock movie and photos,” he said. There were logos for Weyerhaeuser, the lumber manufacturer that had made the boards. “They’re very prominent,” he said, “and some panels had different color paint.” He remembered seeing photographs of the stage with paint like that. “So I was 99 percent sure this was the stage,” he said. He hired an independent consulting firm, which concurred after testing the wood and checking the Weyerhaeuser markings and the paint. “It appears that the plywood in your possession is authentic and from the Woodstock Festival,” the consultant concluded. Mr. Gold did one other thing. He called Robin. “I hadn’t spoken to her since I graduated from high school in 1971,” he said. He reached her after sending her sister a message on Facebook, asking for a telephone number. As he tells it, he got right to the point. “I said, ‘Robin, the reason I’m calling is the paddleball court,’” he said. “Her first words were, ‘Did you know the paddleball court was built from the Woodstock stage?’ I said, ‘Would you write a letter and notarize it?’” She did. Next Mr. Gold hired people to take the paddleball court apart — carefully, piece by piece. He lent some to the Museum at Bethel Woods, adjacent to the original festival site. The museum director and senior curator, Wade Lawrence, had doubts when he heard Mr. Gold’s story about tracking down the plywood panels. “As a museum professional, as a museum curator, I’m always skeptical of any claims of authenticity of any object,” he said. But he met Mr. Gold at a storage unit where Mr. Gold had stashed the wood, and left convinced that it was what Mr. Gold said it was. What was his confidence level? “If I were to put a number on this,” he said, “I’d say it’s in the 90s.” A journalist, Joel Makower, who interviewed Mr. Gold in the 1980s for his book, “Woodstock: The Oral History,” said after hearing the story of the stage that it “sounds plausible.” Michael Lang, one of the 1969 event’s original promoters, said through a spokesman that, “It’s true.” Still, Mr. Lawrence initially resisted Mr. Gold’s offer to provide several panels for the museum’s 50th anniversary exhibit, which opened on Saturday, mainly because the plywood he saw at the storage unit was in poor condition. But Mr. Gold insisted that there was wood that was better looking, and he sent photos of several pieces. “They have water stains all over them,” Mr. Lawrence said, “but hey, it rained at Woodstock.” So he decided to use them in the exhibit. Now Mr. Gold is cutting the wood into small pieces and selling them online. He even plans to save the sawdust, and sell that. (Mr. Lawrence, the curator, distanced himself from Mr. Gold’s commercialization, noting that Mr. Gold’s items are not being sold at the museum. Cutting the wood and selling it is “not something a museum would condone or do,” Mr. Lawrence said.) Is there an appetite for that kind of memorabilia? Should what was left of the stage be cut into circles (for pendants with peace symbols, which Mr. Gold is selling for $99 apiece), into small pieces mounted in a frame ($299) or slightly larger squares ($499, complete with a glass cover)? He said he had sold 500 pendants, 200 frames and about 50 of the $99 items since they went on sale on March 19. One more question: What happened to him and Robin? “I think she started seeing somebody from her parents’ bungalow colony,” Mr. Gold said. “I think she showed him the paddleball court and said, ‘This is the Woodstock stage,’ and he fell in love with her.” "
5c2d246e3a125f5075c02946,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/02/arts/design/apollo-theater-graphic-novel.html,"The graphic novel “Showtime at the Apollo: The Epic Tale of Harlem’s Legendary Theater” is like a sprawling Hollywood biopic. A sea of boldface names — James Brown, the Jackson Five, Dionne Warwick and countless others — make their way through the theater. The work, adapted by Ted Fox from his 1983 history of the same name, and illustrated by James Otis Smith, goes beyond the singers, dancers, comedians and other entertainers who have taken the stage of the Apollo, which celebrates its 85th anniversary this month. The book also shines a light on Harlem and black culture in America. Fox said he reworked his Apollo history into a focused narrative told in three acts, beginning years before the first performance at the theater. An early chapter highlights the Harlem Renaissance and some nightspots, like the Cotton Club, where black performers were popular, yet where black audience members were usually barred. It also notes that the Apollo name first turns up in 1922 — when it was the name of a burlesque theater. An early page of “Showtime at the Apollo” — published by Abrams ComicArts and arriving in stores on Jan. 8 — states simply, “It is an epic tale.” An illustrated prologue, “A Quest,” shows the author in March 1980, when he meets Bobby Schiffman, the son of Frank Schiffman (a founder of the Apollo). The younger Schiffman, who temporarily shuttered the theater in 1976, agrees to cooperate with Fox on the book on one condition: “Write about the way the Apollo really was, the good and bad.” The graphic novel juggles the sometimes harsh realities of the outside world and the magic of the performances on stage. There is drug abuse, robberies and riots — but the overall outlook remains upbeat. Like a biopic, the second act is filled with highs and lows. On Jan. 26, 1934, Hurtig and Seamon’s Burlesque is reopened as the Apollo Theater, whose inaugural show, “Jazz à la Carte,” is what the 85th anniversary this year commemorates. In 1935, there is rioting and looting in the neighborhood, following accusations that two white clerks at a local store, S.H. Kress & Co., beat a young black shopper. (About 3,000 people descended upon S.H. Kress, according to a report in The New York Times.) During the unrest, the Apollo is spared from any physical destruction, as it will be time and again. In 1943, Harlem experiences a worse riot when a police officer shoots and arrests a black soldier. A rumor of his death spreads and many white-owned businesses in Harlem are gutted, but there is an exception: “Nobody touches the Apollo,” the graphic novel reads. “A cordon of Harlemites forms spontaneously to protect the theater.” The book makes note of other riots in the ’60s and a shooting in the theater, in 1975, during a performance by Smokey Robinson. These sobering moments balance the euphoria of other events, like the live recording of a 1963 album by James Brown, which stays on the charts for 66 weeks; or a 1980 performance by George Clinton, who opts for the Harlem stage over Madison Square Garden, a scene whose panels are filled with the refrain “One nation under groove” and “It’s Saturday Night at the Apollo.” One historic moment that comes to life is a performance by the bandleader Lionel Hampton. A caption reads, “Hampton has a penchant for clearing the Apollo, even if it means leading the audience out with his own band!” On two sequential pages, Smith illustrates the band playing, the puff of smoke that allows Hampton to disappear from the stage, the rapturous audience and a march down West 125th Street to the cheers of those outside. The Apollo artwork is filled with characters whose faces are known worldwide, in a palette of black, white and multiple blues. “I find color in comics — especially modern digital coloring — to be distracting,” Smith wrote in an email. “I love the somewhat anonymous commercial illustration of the ’40s and ’50s, and the physical limitations of print techniques. I tried to use the blue mainly as a graphic element.” Smith credits Pete Friedrich, an art director, for a lot of the design work, which includes smartly placed newspaper clippings that move the story along. The story notes that performing at the theater was physically demanding: During its heyday, an engagement meant a weeklong commitment of 31 shows. Benny Payne, who played piano for Cab Calloway, describes challenging logistics: playing two shows at the Apollo and two at the downtown Paramount theater on the same day, leading to frantic cab rides with back-seat outfit changes. Despite the unrelenting artistic demands of the space, it would be financial issues that brought the theater down: In late 1979, the I.R.S. closed the Apollo for payroll-tax violations. But the third act delivers the start of a happy ending: The Apollo gets taken over by new management in 1981, begins renovations in May 1983 and, one month later, is designated a New York City landmark. Financial mismanagement strikes again; The Daily News earns a Pulitzer Prize for editorial writing in 1999 for its coverage of the plight of the theater. Order is restored, followed by an outdoor renovation that is unveiled in 2005, with the theater’s marquee made to look as much as possible as the original — though this time with a multitude of lights. The final dialogue in the graphic novel belongs to Francis Thomas — a.k.a. Doll, or Mr. Apollo — who was a veteran of the Harlem entertainment scene.

5c51f6753a125f5075c0727d,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/30/movies/oscars-controversy.html,"You know things are going wrong with the Oscars when even Lin-Manuel Miranda gets upset. The “Hamilton” star, who has long cultivated a reputation as Twitter’s crown prince of positivity, reached his breaking point last week after it was reported that the Oscar broadcast would run only two performances from the five nominated songs. Most Oscar producers would regard this year’s best-song lineup as a rare gift, since many of the tunes hail from box office behemoths and can be sung by big stars. Still, on the telecast, the academy has reportedly chosen to feature only “Shallow” from “A Star Is Born” and “All the Stars” from “Black Panther.” [Here’s the complete Oscar ballot.] Among those left in the cold are Jennifer Hudson, a consistent awards-show powerhouse who would have sung “I’ll Fight” from the documentary “RBG,” and Emily Blunt, the popular star of two of last year’s biggest hits, who could have performed “The Place Where Lost Things Go” from “Mary Poppins Returns.” The notion of excluding these artists from the broadcast didn’t sit well with Miranda, Blunt’s “Mary Poppins Returns” co-star. Miranda was referring to another recent Oscar controversy, the decision to soldier on with no host for the show after Kevin Hart stepped down over offensive tweets, but the truth is that Oscar conflagrations are happening on a regular basis these days, and many are of the academy’s own making. Take another decision, tweeted by the Variety reporter Kris Tapley on Sunday, to award the winner of the best-cinematography Oscar during a commercial break. The academy is exploring this option for several of the tech categories to cut the length of this year’s show, and while those acceptance speeches will probably be edited into the broadcast later that night in some kind of truncated form, reporters at the ceremony will be announcing the winners on social media long before the home audience gets to see them. Blowback to this idea was fierce and immediate, with many blasting the academy president, John Bailey, who is himself a cinematographer. “I’m offended by the proposed changes to the telecast,” tweeted the director and academy member Gina Prince-Bythewood (“Beyond the Lights”). “Filmmaking is a collection of crafts and The Academy is the only awards show that honors and amplifies all. As it should be.” It should be, but will it? At this point, the Oscars seem almost ashamed to put on a show. There will be no host nor overarching comic sensibility, most of the musical performances have apparently been cut (including the nominated “Ballad of Buster Scruggs” song “When a Cowboy Trades His Spurs for Wings”), and plenty of worthy categories will be shunted to the margins. Given the mandate by ABC to trim the length of the telecast, we can expect acceptance speeches to be ever more quickly curtailed, and I’ll be surprised if we still see clips of the nominated performances, the sort of thing that might introduce some of these smaller movies to a wider audience. In other words, the Oscar telecast has become an entertainment program determined to divest itself of all entertainment. Does the academy understand why we still tune into this show? When I think back on the Oscars of yesteryear, I remember moments, not minutes: a speech that surprises, a musical performance that connects, an unplanned line that becomes a part of history. If the academy isn’t going to leave room for those moments to happen, it might as well issue a press release instead of a broadcast. The Oscars ought to take a few cues from the Super Bowl, another mammoth entertainment event that refuses to be ashamed of its size. When the Super Bowl is broadcast this Sunday, producers won’t be forced to choose between either the national anthem or the halftime show, or eliminate overtime if the game goes long. They understand that people want the Super Bowl to be as maximal as possible, a communal watching experience that gives us plenty to talk about. Why can’t the Oscars be as unabashed? Even the Super Bowl’s most annoying feature — endless commercial interruptions — has been rebranded as one of its greatest strengths: You now watch not just to see which team prevails, but to debate what high-profile ads won the night, too. Instead of apologizing for the Oscars’ length, ABC could take similar advantage of it by stuffing the commercial breaks with exclusive footage from “Avengers: Endgame” or “Toy Story 4,” two films to be released by the network’s fellow Disney subsidiaries Marvel and Pixar. There are plenty of other organic, exciting ways to work those blockbusters into the broadcast, and they can even help restore some of the categories the academy wants to cut from the show. Is a sound-mixing Oscar the most scintillating thing to present during the telecast? On its own, perhaps not, but what if you could show a clip of Beyoncé and Donald Glover mixing their duet of “Can You Feel the Love Tonight” from the forthcoming redo of “The Lion King”? The presentation might take a little longer, but I doubt anyone would complain. So let’s embrace that attitude: Instead of apologizing for the show’s length, the academy should resolve to pack the Oscar broadcast full of major moments, no matter how long it goes. Instead of antagonizing the craftspeople who should be celebrating the biggest night of their careers, the Oscars should find a way to honor them by making every presentation a blockbuster event. As a kid, Lin-Manuel Miranda tuned in to the Oscars simply because he loved a movie, and there was no show on earth that loved movies more. It’s time for the Oscars to prove they can still be that show. "
5c84082649f0eacbf105c39d,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/09/movies/jordan-peele-us-premiere.html,"AUSTIN, Tex. — When Jordan Peele took the stage to present the world premiere of his new horror film, “Us,” at South by Southwest, he had jokes. “What if I showed four episodes of ‘This Is Us’ in a row, with no explanation?” he asked. And he gave a shout-out to another film that brought him to the festival three years ago. “If you haven’t seen ‘Keanu,’ go see it. It’s a must-see.” But back to “Us,” the follow-up to Peele’s Oscar-winning, culture-galvanizing “Get Out.” Expectations have been high for “Us” since the trailer dropped on Christmas Day and raised questions around the web. What’s up with the family that seems to be terrorized by creepy doppelgängers? Why the scissors? How much does the 1995 Luniz track “I Got 5 on It” really factor in? Now, the biggest question to arise after its first public screening is: Does “Us” live up to the hype? I won’t give away the plot, but based on the electrified reaction Friday night in the packed Paramount Theater, signs are pointing to yes. SXSW moviegoers can be more enthusiastic than many; they’re eager for a great night out. And Peele seems to be particularly good at generating audience response. “Get Out” mixed humor and chills, and in “Us,” Peele’s comedy roots are even more apparent. At Friday’s screening, the crowd was laughing heartily one moment, screaming the next and cheering soon after. But Peele wants to leave audiences wondering as well. During a Q. and A. after the screening, he said, “My favorite thing is the idea that people will leave ready to have a conversation with whoever they’re with.” He continued, “I also wanted to design a film that’s very personal for every individual.” Early critical responses have been positive, while grappling with the movie’s meaning. The Hollywood Reporter wrote, “Maybe every happy ending is somebody else’s catastrophe, and therefore, no horror film is ever really over.” In its review, Variety said the movie trades “on some uncanny combination of Peele’s imagination and our own to suggest a horror infinitely larger and more insidious than the film is capable of representing.” And Indiewire praised Peele’s “ability to explore how past cultural events can take ominous new dimensions in the present.” The rest of America can weigh in when the movie opens in theaters March 22.

5c2d391c3a125f5075c02977,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/02/obituaries/ray-sawyer-dead.html,"Ray Sawyer, who cut a distinctive figure as a member of the band Dr. Hook and the Medicine Show thanks to his flamboyant style and attention-drawing eye patch, and who sang lead on one of the group’s best-known songs, “The Cover of Rolling Stone,” died on Monday in Daytona, Fla. He was 81. His wife, Linda Lombardi Sawyer, announced his death on Facebook. She did not give a cause but said in a post a week earlier that he had been hospitalized. Mr. Sawyer and the band rose to prominence in the early 1970s with a country-rock sound that later became more lush and occasionally even displayed a disco influence. Dennis Locorriere usually sang lead, but Mr. Sawyer was the most recognizable band member. His eye patch gave the group its name, a sort of skewing of the Captain Hook character from “Peter Pan.” “I’ve had the eye patch since I was 27,” Mr. Sawyer told The St. Petersburg Times in 2010. “I was in a car accident. Some people still ask if it is a gimmick, something to draw attention, but it’s real.” He sang the lead vocal on “Rolling Stone.” (The label of the original single gave the title as “The Cover of Rolling Stone,” though the lyrics he sings use a “the” before the magazine’s name.) The song, a parody about rock ’n’ roll fame, reached the Top 10 of the Billboard pop chart in March 1973. That same month, the magazine did in fact put the band, or at least a caricature of it, on its cover. Ray Sawyer was born on Feb. 1, 1937, in Chickasaw, Ala. Dr. Hook and the Medicine Show was formed in the late 1960s in New Jersey and caught fire after it joined with Shel Silverstein, the cartoonist and sometime songwriter, and played his songs in the 1971 movie “Who Is Harry Kellerman and Why Is He Saying Those Terrible Things About Me?” (directed by Ulu Grosbard and starring Dustin Hoffman). The movie got the band a contract with Columbia Records. Mr. Silverstein, who died in 1999, wrote “Sylvia’s Mother,” a lament about a pay-phone call that in 1972 became the group’s first big hit. It may or may not have been a parody of country ballads, but “The Cover of Rolling Stone,” also written by Mr. Silverstein, was certainly a gag. “We take all kinds of pills that give us all kind of thrills,” the lyrics went, “but the thrill we’ve never known is the thrill that’ll gitcha when you get your picture on the cover of the Rolling Stone.” By the mid-1970s the band had been derailed by mismanagement and was facing bankruptcy. “Somebody was putting the cash away, and it wasn’t us,” Mr. Sawyer told The Toronto Star in 1991. “The bankruptcy court took everything away from us, even the ‘Medicine Show’ part of our name. I haven’t figured out yet why they did that. It’s like taking the Pips out of Gladys Knight and the Pips.” But by 1976 the band, as simply Dr. Hook, was on the comeback trail with a smoother sound, heard that year on a cover of Sam Cooke’s “Only Sixteen.” Later hits included “When You’re in Love With a Beautiful Woman” in 1979. Mr. Sawyer left the group in 1982, and he and Mr. Locorriere later engaged in a legal tussle over rights to the group’s name. Mr. Sawyer continued to perform into this decade. A full list of survivors was not immediately available. "
5c2d52db3a125f5075c029ae,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/02/obituaries/daryl-dragon-dead.html,"Daryl Dragon, the “Captain” half of the pop duo the Captain and Tennille, whose string of soft-rock hits in the 1970s included “Love Will Keep Us Together” and “Muskrat Love,” died on Wednesday in Prescott, Ariz. He was 76. His former wife and singing partner, Toni Tennille, announced his death through a publicist, who said the cause was renal failure. The Captain and Tennille, whose specialty was romantic ballads featuring Ms. Tennille’s silky voice, reached the Top 10 seven times from 1975 to 1979. “He was a brilliant musician with many friends who loved him greatly,” Ms. Tennille said in a statement. “I was at my most creative in my life when I was with him.” Mr. Dragon’s stage name came from his days as a backup musician with the Beach Boys in the 1960s and early ’70s, when he often wore a captain’s hat onstage. Mike Love, one of the group’s leaders, would introduce him to audiences as the “captain of the keyboards.” He had been performing with the Beach Boys for several years before the hat made its fateful appearance. “I just picked it up one night on the spur of the moment,” he told The Boston Globe in 1976, “and that night they spotlighted me in ‘Help Me Rhonda.’ It made a big hit, and I’ve been wearing it ever since.” Daryl Dragon was born on Aug. 27, 1942, in Los Angeles. His father, Carmen, was a composer and conductor, and his mother, Eloise (Rawitzer) Dragon, was a soprano who sang on radio programs. Mr. Dragon was trained in classical piano but didn’t take to it. “I seemed to be at war with myself in my musical tastes,” he told The Globe. “I could appreciate the great compositions, but I also liked the boogie beat.” He played in several bands in the 1960s before signing on with the Beach Boys. He met Ms. Tennille in 1971, when he was brought in to play keyboards for the San Francisco run of an ecology-themed musical, “Mother Earth,” which she had co-written and in which she was performing with South Coast Repertory, a theater company from Orange County, Calif. He in turn brought her onto a Beach Boys tour as a backup singer and pianist. The two began performing together in nightclubs, and after self-financing a demo, they landed a record contract. Their cover of “Love Will Keep Us Together,” a song that Neil Sedaka and Howard Greenfield wrote and that Mr. Sedaka recorded in 1973, became a worldwide hit in 1975, reaching No. 1 on the Billboard singles chart and winning the Grammy Award for record of the year. The Captain and Tennille kept turning out hits for the rest of the 1970s. They also landed a television variety show on ABC as the network tried to duplicate the success that Sonny and Cher had enjoyed with their own show earlier in the decade. But the series, which had its premiere in September 1976, lasted only one season. Mr. Dragon found the whole experience distasteful. “Television is a great garbage disposal,” he said at the time. “It keeps grinding up artists like us and throwing them away.” Mr. Dragon produced all 10 of the duo’s 10 albums. They continued to perform after their hit-making run ended in 1979 — “Do That to Me One More Time” was their last gold record — and Mr. Dragon produced other artists. Ms. Tennille, meanwhile, increasingly pursued solo projects. The couple divorced in 2014. In 2016, Ms. Tennille published a memoir in which she wrote that their marriage had not been the idyllic partnership it had been made to seem. Their record company, she wrote, falsely announced that they had married on Valentine’s Day 1975; to satisfy expectations, they married for real not long after. “I can say without exaggeration that he showed no physical affection for me during our very long marriage,” she wrote. Mr. Dragon is survived by a brother, Doug. "

A bartender at the restaurant shot the video that made waves on Facebook. Mr. Landis, 43, has been the choir director at Hingham Middle School six years. He and Mr. Michienzie, a tailor, got engaged on Christmas Eve in 2016. They kept their engagement quiet for months because Mr. Landis wasn’t sure how his students would react to him having a husband. But word got out last year. “At the end of the summer, Margit and I heard he was getting married. He’s the best teacher, and he’s got this great energy, and he makes every school function fun. We thought, wouldn’t it be awesome to do something for his wedding?” said Ms. Foraste of Hingham. The women emailed their fellow choir parents, asking if their sixth-, seventh- and eighth-grade singers were up for participating in a surprise appearance to celebrate Mr. Landis’ wedding, and making sure they felt no pressure to be involved. “We hoped we’d get at least 15 kids to do it,” said Ms. Foraste, who was worried about availability during the busy run-up to Christmas. Instead, 50 of the 70 choir members committed. Four weeks of secret Sunday evening rehearsals at the James Library in Norwell, under the direction of Dona Maher, a colleague of Mr. Landis’s who gives private piano and voice lessons, resulted. Students had to finagle their partial absence from school that Friday with the principal, some of them missing lunch to be excused. “I was flabbergasted by how much they cared,” Mr. Landis said. “As a middle-school teacher, I see students struggling so much with trying to figure out who they are,” he said. “Some of the students singing have inner struggles, and things I know about going on at home. I was so glad they were there, feeling the love in the room and knowing everything’s going to be O.K., that things do work out.” “I Doozy” is an every-so-often feature highlighting people, places or things related to Weddings.

Furious at the disease, I’m starting the new year with a yowl. Survivors of patients who have not survived, people dealing with a terminal condition, and their caregivers are generally advised to seek acceptance. However, great artists of anger have taught us how cathartic a rousing roar can be, especially when the object of rage is not a conjured scapegoat but a clear and present danger. One of the greatest of those artists in living memory — the singer, pianist, composer Nina Simone — lambasted the disasters of American racism. Does she have something to teach those of us dealing with cancer-related tragedies? In 1963, after the killings of Medgar Evers and of four little girls in the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Ms. Simone began producing a number of anthems for the civil rights and black power movements. One of her most powerful songs continues to be all too relevant. The lyrics of “Mississippi Goddam,” I thought, might serve me while cancer’s casualties stun me. By tweaking Nina Simone’s words, would I implicitly be comparing rampant racism to metastatic disease or vice versa? I could live with that analogy, as Susan Sontag — the public intellectual who rejected all metaphors of illness — once did. Ms. Simone reinvented other refrains created by writers of many different ethnicities and nations, shaping them to her purposes. In doing so, she has emboldened me to recycle some of her stanzas for people from diverse backgrounds who live with cancer. When borrowing is acknowledged, after all, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. Here, then, is a homage to Nina Simone that I hope will lead you to listen to her terrific rendition of “Mississippi Goddam.” In an aside within this edgy elegy of damaged lives, she calls it “a show tune, but the show hasn’t been written for it yet.” I also feel as if I have been watching a show that hasn’t been written yet. After too many cancer-related setbacks and deaths of relatives, friends, and correspondents — you readers could not be more moving about your own bereavements — I started belting Nina Simone’s protest with new words, invigorated by her spirit of indignant fury. When cancer feels like an epidemic, it may be easier to rage than to mourn, as all of us undoubtedly will, over rending losses. Carcinoma Goddam Myeloma’s got me so upsetLeukemia’s made me lose my rest And everybody knows about carcinoma goddam. Metastatic breast has gotten me upset Mesothelioma made me lose my rest And everybody knows about pancreatic goddam. Can’t you see it? Can’t you feel it?

Onscreen text describes the record, still a cult favorite, as one of the first openly gay country albums. But by the end of this sustained, frightening immersion in Peter’s private world, the title has acquired a darker connotation. Isabelle Dupuis and Tim Geraghty have made a grim and haunting documentary about what it means to burn bright, then die alone. Grudzien’s Astoria home in Queens belongs to “Grey Gardens” school of housekeeping. Shot mainly from 2005 to 2007, the movie shows Peter living there with his twin sister, Terry, who like him struggles with evident mental illness, and their near-centenarian father, Joseph, who remembers a childhood working in mines. (“For some people, life, it’s not worth it,” Joseph says in a blunt summation of Terry’s demons.) Peter prattles on about the old days, recalling a Nashville where, as he describes it, everyone looked effeminate. He performs at karaoke, sounding like someone who never carried a tune in his life. Even when three cousins try to stage an intervention, it is clear that this household — which Peter voices fear of losing — is a sanctum that can’t be breached. At one point Peter, dressed at his most outlandish, brags that he is wearing the same style of sunglasses worn by the Claude Rains character in “The Invisible Man.” Invisibility is what he achieved, and what this film — by staring so empathetically at squalor and loneliness — so painfully shows.

5cb43a5b49f0eacbf1f84192,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/15/lens/altamont-1969-bill-owens.html,"A half-century ago, 1969 capped a radical, idealistic decade that saw the rise of the hippie generation and the assassinations of John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Woodstock, perhaps the most famous concert ever, happened that summer, with free love and drugs serving as backdrops to sets by Jimi Hendrix, Santana, Richie Havens and others. But another large, raucous rock festival that year became notorious for very different reasons: Altamont. That December, the Rolling Stones and the Grateful Dead organized an impromptu concert at Altamont Speedway, in the golden hills of Northern California’s East Bay, that drew an estimated 300,000 people. Four people died, including a man who was killed by members of the Hells Angels who had been hired to provide “security” for the event. So much for peace and love. The concert was featured in the documentary film “Gimme Shelter,” and a few photojournalists captured the experience. Among them was Bill Owens, who would soon rise to photographic fame for his seminal early 1970s project “Suburbia,” which cheekily documented the rise of the suburbs in California. In December 1969, he was working as a photographer for The Independent, a newspaper in nearby Livermore, Calif., when his friend Beth Bagby and her boyfriend, Robert, who worked for The Associated Press, called to see if he wanted to shoot the concert. His editors gave him the day off as long as he let them publish a photo of the gathering. “The concert was going to be on a Saturday morning,” he recalled. “For some reason I had a motorcycle, probably because it was $85. So I drove my motorcycle out, and I went on the back roads. People were abandoning their cars, so pretty soon I had to ditch the motorcycle, because there was a barbed-wire fence there, and I couldn’t take it up this hill.” He got there early with two cameras, three lenses, film and a jar of water. He climbed up the sound tower to get a bird’s-eye view, which gave him a sense of the concert’s sprawling scale. Several hours later, a Hells Angels biker climbed the tower and threatened to bash his head with a pipe wrench and toss him off the tower if he didn’t come down. Since he’d used up all his film by then, Mr. Owens happily obliged and slowly made his way back to his motorcycle to go home. As he later wrote: “People fighting on sound towers only happens in the movies, and the good guy wins. Reality is different.” Mr. Owens didn’t even like rock concerts as he was a few years older than the hippies surrounding him, and he wasn’t interested in “dope.” He just wanted to go home to his family, put on the TV and watch Walter Cronkite.  Ms. Bagby stayed into the night, and photographed a Hells Angels member stabbing an African-American man, Meredith Hunter, near the stage as the Stones played. Mr. Owens didn’t know anything had gone horribly wrong until the following day. In addition to pictures of Mick Jagger making his way through the crowd, and Jefferson Airplane and Santana on stage, Mr. Owens managed to capture images of the Hells Angels beating people with pool cues, and feared his family might be at risk. Not taking any chances, he published his images under a pseudonym. “When the images appeared in Rolling Stone and Esquire all over the world, I had two or three different aliases on different images,” he said. “I would not publish my name, because my name is in the phone book, and I don’t want anybody associated with the Hells Angels to come looking for me and shoot me thinking I was the one who shot the photographs of the guy being murdered. “I’ve got a wife and a kid, and a second kid coming along. You want to be watching TV in the night time. You don’t want to be sitting there with a gun trying to protect yourself. I don’t want anything to do with that culture.” After the images were published, Mr. Owens and Ms. Bagby lent their negatives to a young couple who planned to include them in a book, but their house was burglarized and the thieves took all the negatives. Mr. Owens blames the Hells Angels, who he suspects weren’t interested in evidence remaining at large. The few pictures that survived have been collected in a new photo book, “Altamont 1969,” that was recently published in Italy by Damiani Books. It’s a fascinating collection of photographs, in addition to being an important document of a turbulent chapter in American cultural history. It’s also a surprising series to those who know Mr. Owens for his funny, warmhearted projects from the 1970s, and perhaps also to those who know him only as one of the founders of the craft beer brewing and craft distilling movements in the United States. Mr. Owens also served in the Peace Corps and took a hitchhiking trip around the world. The Altamont project, which relied so heavily on being present at a particular moment, seems an outlier compared to the rest of his work. In 1978, he published a manual about how to become a documentary photographer, in which he wrote: “Each year prizes are given to photographers who were at the right disaster at the right time: a shot of someone falling to his death, or better yet, a photograph of someone holding a gun on a hostage, and being blasted at by the cops. My photographs of violence are not a source of personal pride.” But at 80, having lived a rich and varied life, Bill Owens is thrilled the book will be a part of the cultural conversation. And he’s glad it’s happening now. “I know now, at age 80, God can take you,” he said. “Within three months, I can go. A lot of people have gone already. I read the obits. When you’re ready, something can be cooking inside of you, and you’re gone, and I’ve got this legacy to take care of.” Follow @nytimesphoto and @jblauphoto on Twitter.

5c87c6eb49f0eacbf105ca17,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/12/movies/charlize-theron-long-shot-sxsw.html,"AUSTIN, Tex. — The Oscar-winning actress Charlize Theron traveled to South by Southwest over the weekend for the premiere of her new romantic comedy, “Long Shot,” in which she stars as a presidential candidate opposite Seth Rogen as her speechwriter. The film opens nationwide May 3. We asked readers if they had any questions for her during the festival, and I selected a handful of those to ask Theron on Saturday at the Four Seasons. She spoke about how “Monster” (2003) made her more empathetic, how her physical transformation for “Tully” took a toll and how she’s still waiting for a part in a Marvel movie. Here are edited excerpts from her responses. Your performance in “Monster” was an absolute tour de force. It felt to me as if you did much more than study Aileen Wuornos. It seemed as if you were able to connect with her psyche in some way. Can you talk about your connection to this role a bit more? — Deb, Wilmington, Del. I think the more you embed yourself in the information you have access to, the more alive things become underneath your skin. They executed Aileen on the day I said yes to the film.

So Patty and I flew out to Flint, Mich., and we spent three days in a guest bedroom, reading as many of Aileen’s letters as we possibly could to just try and understand her. Many actors mention how playing a role can sometimes impact their views on issues in the world. Have any of the roles you’ve played had that effect on you, and if so which one, and in what way? — Frank Komola, Bradford, Mass. Yes, I never really truly understood the difference between empathy and sympathy until I played Aileen. Once I empathized with her, I could understand her actions a little bit more. And I think it’s sometimes a tricky thing to talk about, because we don’t want to ever justify this person’s actions. But I remember being done with that movie and walking through my life in this world, traveling, going to Africa, and just really understanding the power of empathy and how, I don’t think, we encourage it enough. You’ve demonstrated your action-movie cred in about a half-dozen films, but haven’t yet appeared in a Marvel or DC project. Hard to believe you haven’t been asked, so what’s the story? — Stu Freeman, Brooklyn That’s a question for Marvel. I’ve met with those guys and we’ve had some conversations, but I’ve never been offered anything. I would totally be open to it. That genre is becoming really fascinating to me, and that kind of physical storytelling is something that I’m really enjoying. So get with it, Marvel! Is there any physical change you won’t make to play a role? — Lanie, San Antonio There’s nothing so far that a director has asked of me that I’ve said no to. But for [the 2018 movie] “Tully,” I had gained all this weight and it was really, really hard in my 40s to lose it. I did a lot of damage to my body and I definitely went through a period of full frustration where I was like, I will never do that again. And then of course I know, if the right material came around, I would do it again in a heartbeat. The film industry seems to be making progress with more complex female acting roles (although there is still a lot to be done). But the industry still does not have nearly enough female directors. Why do you think it is so difficult for female directors to succeed? — Cristina Salazar, Baltimore We’ve gone through a very long period where women weren’t supported in that job, and so now we’re in the recovery process. It’s great because of film festivals like South by Southwest and Sundance and Telluride. There are more platforms for filmmakers who haven’t had the opportunities in the last 20 or 30 years. And I also think the industry now understands the benefit. This stuff is not always generated by good thoughts and big hearts. The industry is realizing that there is something to be monetized here and that women are actually tapping into storytelling in a way that is really good for our business. You said in an interview that you were stalking the incredible director Lynne Ramsay. Is it working?  — João Xará, Lisbon, Portugal  Not yet. I have to amp up my game a little bit more. We had a really nice period where she was in L.A. writing and not living far from me. We got to hang out a little bit. She has a little girl and our kids got together. She’s an absolutely lovely person and I’m such a fan of her work. But she moves by the beat of her own drum, and unless she’s going to be inspired by something, none of my stuff is flattering enough for her to change her process, which is what I admire most about her. How much credit do you give the directors for helping your performance shine? — Screed, New York The majority of it. If I felt like I didn’t need that or benefit from that, I think I would just be directing my own stuff. There’s something really powerful about working with people, whether it’s your director or your cinematographer, your entire crew. I often imagine them all sitting at a table, and what they each bring in their own expertise that makes what I do so much better.  Any interest in directing? — Padgman1, Downstate Illinois I feel like probably, but not right now. I have a passion for storytelling and exploring it in many different facets. I can literally see myself getting into production design. I just love all the tentacles of the process. So yeah, I can see it happening, but there’s nothing in the near future that I’m imagining. "

5c93c55949f0eacbf105e501,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/21/fashion/ariana-grande-law-roach-zendaya.html,"When Ariana Grande stepped on stage at the Times Union Center in Albany for the start of her 80-date Sweetener World Tour this week and began to belt “God Is a Woman,” she did so wearing a mix of haute and street wear, Versace and the independent Los Angeles designer Oscar Utierrè, that signaled the next stage in her professional evolution from Nickelodeon star to global sensation. Her longtime stylist Law Roach said the point was that she can no longer be put in any single box.  Neither, as it happens, can he. A thoughtful 30-something (he is evasive about his age) who has been helping Ms. Grande define and refine her image since 2015, Mr. Roach has in the process become something of a lightning rod and activist in an industry that has struggled with issues of size-ism, racism and #MeToo. “I like to grow with my clients,” he said by phone on a break from tour rehearsals in Pennsylvania. Ms. Grande, he said, “went through so much these last two years: the bombing at the concert, the death of what could have been one of the loves of her life, the breakup with Pete.”  Mr. Roach was referring to the singer’s former fiancé, Pete Davidson; her late boyfriend, Mac Miller; and the suicide bombing that killed 22 people in Manchester, England, during her 2017 Dangerous Woman Tour. “It’s just, she has 148 million people on Instagram alone watching her go through it,” he said. In helping Ms. Grande make the leap from teenage kitten to adult woman-with-a-cause, Mr. Roach is staying true to a career marked by evolution: Celine Dion emerging from grief to become a viral sensation in an $885 Vetements “Titanic” hoodie during Paris couture week in 2016; Tiffany Haddish famously re-wearing Alexander McQueen for the third time to present at the MTV Movie & TV Awards in 2018.  Most recently it was Zendaya’s masterminding of her Tommy Hilfiger x Zendaya collection during Paris Fashion Week. The show was inspired by the Battle of Versailles, the 1973 face-off between French and American designers that featured a large number of black models, many more than usual runway shows. “It was about paying homage to the people who opened the door for us,” Mr. Roach said, of the Zendaya show. All of the models were women of color, and included Pat Cleveland, who walked in the Battle of Versailles; Veronica Webb, the first black woman to land a cosmetics contract with a major brand (Revlon); and Beverly Johnson, the first black woman to appear on the cover of American Vogue. Ten of the 59 women, aged from 18 to 70, were plus size. Black plus size women? “In our community, that’s a given,” Mr. Roach said. “This is the shape of woman we’ve grown up with — my mom, her aunts, her grandma. It had to be size inclusive, because if the women in Zendaya’s family can’t wear it, then she doesn’t want to make it.” “We all know the average woman is not a size 0 or 2,” Mr. Roach said. “I think it’s just human nature to want to see ourselves, to be represented. When I got into this industry, I didn’t see anyone who looked like me.” Mr. Roach was the first black stylist on the cover of the Hollywood Reporter’s annual Stylist & Stars issue, in 2017. “I’m still the first to do some things in 2019,” he said. “The more I’ve been around, the more I see where the deficit is.  “It’s award season, I’m taking high jewelry appointments, I see who else is at those appointments. When I go to Paris, I see who’s at the shows. During the Oscars, I’m backstage with Mary, and I see what that landscape looks like,” he said of last year’s ceremony, where Mary J. Blige, a client, was nominated for best supporting actress and best original song, for “Mudbound.” “Why is this still the landscape? Why does it still look this way? I just always come back to the question: Is it talent or is it opportunity? “You get to this position by first being someone’s intern,” Mr. Roach said. “And then an assistant. I don’t see black assistants, or black interns. Everybody’s not going to meet a Zendaya and have the gumption or the ability to figure everything out.” Mr. Roach grew up on the South Side of Chicago, the oldest of five siblings, with a single mother. “I grew up very, very, very, very poor,” he said. “Single parent, shelters. I was a kid of the streets.”  Far from thinking about fashion, he was thinking about how to feed his siblings. “I was always big brother/mother because my mother suffered from alcoholism and drug addiction,” he said. “I had to cook. I had to clean. I raised my youngest brother when my mom passed away. I grew up with nothing. Literally, nothing.” While working as a bartender, he and his best friend opened a vintage clothing store called Deliciously Vintage. One day in 2009, Kanye West walked in, and Mr. Roach was soon fielding inquiries from around the world.  “People started calling the store, ‘Hey, I’m a stylist for this magazine, do you have. ...’ It triggered something in me,” said Mr. Roach, who started calling himself a stylist. Now he calls himself an “image architect,” because, he said “I didn’t have someone else’s formula of how to do this job, I created my own.”  Two years later, one of his customers, a close friend of Zendaya’s father, invited him to Los Angeles. Zendaya, then a budding Disney star, was going to Justin Bieber’s “Never Say Never” premiere. “They were going to the mall to find something to wear, and my friend Chastity was like, ‘Oh, you should take Law. He loves clothes, he can help,’” Mr. Roach said. “So, we all went to the mall. And Zendaya and I have been together ever since.”  Now Mr. Roach is gearing up to help Zendaya with the press tour for “Spider-Man Far From Home” with Tom Holland, as well as starring in the Bloomingdale’s 2019 spring “Mix Masters” campaign, as himself. He is also eyeing a creative endeavor, whether it is taking the helm of an existing brand or starting his own. Mr. Roach believes people must demand change, and at all levels. “This next generation of girls in Hollywood — the Zendayas, the Yara Shahidis, the Kiki Laynes — these women are coming in asking to work with people who look like them,” he said. “That’s the only way this landscape is going to change. We have to be able to be in these rooms.” "
5c88e9cb49f0eacbf105cce6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/13/world/asia/jung-joon-young-sex-videos.html,"HONG KONG — A K-pop singer apologized on Wednesday for filming and sharing intimate videos of women without their consent as South Korea reckoned with a widening inquiry centered on another celebrity’s misconduct at Seoul nightclubs. The Seoul police say the singer, Jung Joon-young, 30, is suspected of violating sexual violence laws that prohibit the non-consensual filming and sharing of intimate videos. He was met by investigators on Tuesday at Incheon International Airport after he arrived on a flight from Los Angeles, where he had been filming a televised variety show. In a written statement shared by his agency, MAKEUS Entertainment, on Wednesday, Mr. Jung admitted to illicitly filming women and sharing the videos in group chats online. “I kneel down to apologize to the women who appear in the videos,” he wrote, adding that he would withdraw from the entertainment scene and repent his “unethical and unlawful acts” for the rest of his life. Mr. Jung’s admission comes after another K-pop singer, Lee Seung-hyun, who performed under the name Seungri, announced his retirement on Monday after being named a suspect for “offering sexual services” at nightclubs. The 28-year-old singer has denied the allegations but nonetheless chose to leave the entertainment scene and quit his boy band, Big Bang. The police have said that the two cases are “related and not related,” but noted that Mr. Jung’s case could be seen as a “derivative” of their inquiry into Mr. Lee’s conduct. Under South Korean law, those found guilty of taking explicit photos or videos without a subject’s consent can face up to five years in prison or a fine of up to 30 million won, or $26,500. The distribution of intimate photos or videos without consent carries the same maximum punishment. But critics say the police and prosecutors are lax about enforcing the law. In 2018, only roughly a third of the 6,800 reported cases were taken to trial, according to statistics from the Supreme Prosecutors’ Office of the Republic of Korea. And fewer than one in 10 trials led to prison sentences that year. Yunkim Ji-yeong, an assistant professor of feminist philosophy at the Institute of Body and Culture at Konkuk University, said such illicit filming and sharing of the videos were commonplace in South Korea. “Men competitively upload illegally filmed videos and encourage one another so that they upload again and the cycle perpetuates,” she said. She added that while tens of thousands of South Korean women protested illicit filming in a half-dozen rallies in 2018, some women were still surprised by the allegations because they contradicted the idealized image of pop idols. “These cases show that these male celebrities were using women to conduct illegal activities,” Ms. Yunkim said. MAKEUS Entertainment said in a statement that Mr. Jung’s contract had been terminated after he made an apology. "
5c3391283a125f5075c03338,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/07/science/whales-songs-acoustics.html,"Sometimes a whale just wants to change its tune.  That’s one of the things researchers have learned recently by eavesdropping on whales in several parts of the world and listening for changes in their pattern and pitch. Together, the new studies suggest that whales are not just whistling in the water, but constantly evolving a form of communication that we are only beginning to understand. Most whales and dolphins vocalize, but dolphins and toothed whales mostly make clicking and whistling sounds. Humpbacks, and possibly bowheads, sing complex songs with repeated patterns, said Michael Noad, an associate professor in the Cetacean Ecology and Acoustics Laboratory at the University of Queensland in Australia.  Birds may broadcast their social hierarchy among song-sharing populations by allowing the dominant bird to pick the playlist and patterns. But how and why whales pass song fragments across hundreds of miles, and to thousands of animals, is far more mysterious.  The biggest question is why whales sing at all.  “The thing that always gets me out of bed in the morning is the function of the song,” Dr. Noad said. “I find humpback song fascinating from the point of view of how it’s evolved.” The leading hypothesis is that male humpbacks — only the males sing — are trying to attract females. But they may also switch tunes when another male is nearby, apparently to assess a rival’s size and fitness, said Dr. Noad, who was the senior author of one of four new papers on whale songs. Why the humpbacks’ musical patterns tend to be more complex than those of other whales is also a bit murky. Dr. Noad suggested that the development may be the result of so-called “runaway selection.”  Early humpbacks with complex songs were so much more successful at mating that they gained a substantial evolutionary advantage over their brethren with simpler vocalizations. This led to some very large, sometimes very noisy animals. Julien Bonnel, an associate scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, said the growing research also shows the importance of collecting data over many years, offering insights not only into whales but ocean conditions that affect other species.  The technology for recording whales has gotten much cheaper over the last dozen years or so, making it more accessible to researchers. And computer programs that analyze huge data sets quickly have helped interpret years of these recordings.  Tagging whales without hurting them has produced more data, Dr. Noad noted, but the tags only remain on the whale for a few hours, limiting the information that can be collected. In one of the new studies, led by scientists at the New York-based Wildlife Conservation Society, researchers tracked humpbacks singing along the east and west coasts of Africa, comparing songs sung by those off the coast of Gabon to those near Madagascar. The study, published in the journal Royal Society Open Science, confirmed that the two populations interact, noting overlap in their vocalizations. The researchers recorded songs annually from 2001 to 2005 using hand-held hydrophones aboard boats. “Male humpback whales within a population tend to sing the same song type, but it’s continuously changing and evolving over time,” said Melinda Rekdahl, the study’s first author and a marine conservation scientist with the wildlife society. “It’s thought to be one of the best examples of cultural evolution in the animal kingdom.” Dr. Rekdahl wasn’t on the boat that collected the sound for her new study, but she knows firsthand that “it can be an amazing experience,” she said.  The sound of a nearby singer resonates through the hull of the boat. “If the singer is that close, you can hear the song getting fainter just before the whale surfaces nearby,” she recalled. “If the singers aren’t that close,” she added, “you can often sit there for hours recording and hearing the song through your headphones but not see a whale anywhere.”  Dr. Rekdahl based her new study on data collected between 2001 and 2005, because she thought those recordings offered the best opportunity to compare song similarities between neighboring populations.  The idea of using songs to look at population mixing and connectivity is relatively new, she said, and has only been proven valuable in the last few years. Some animals repeat sounds more than others, some sing “aberrant” tunes, and juveniles may hum jingles altogether different from the adults’. Humpbacks also alter their tunes over time.  One reason might be novelty — for themselves or nearby females. “If I was swimming up with 15,000 whales and all the males were singing the same song, it would drive me crazy,” Dr. Rekdahl said. Maybe the “females are just, like, give me a new song!” Two additional recent studies examined how the songs change, seasonally and across years. In one paper, Jenny Allen, who was a doctoral student with Dr. Noad, found an unexpected pattern among humpbacks. Once their songs reach a certain level of complexity, humpbacks drop that tune entirely and pick up a new, simpler one. Her study, the first to quantify the complexity of the songs, was published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences.  “That clear oscillating pattern was something we didn’t really expect,” said Dr. Allen, now a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Queensland and a lecturer at Griffith University in Australia. Assuming that the songs are meant to attract females, “it might be that a brand-new song is a bit sexier than continuing to sing the complicated version of the old song,” she said. But because it’s hard to memorize a whole new song, “they’re simplifying it to make it easy to learn so much new material all at once.” Humpback songs have a lot of repeating patterns, which might make them easier to remember, just as rhymes at the end of poetry lines aid memorization, Dr. Allen said. She also found a lot of predictability in the patterns, and compared them to pop songs based on the same four chords. In another new paper, researchers at the University of Brest in France found that the pitch of Antarctic blue whale, pygmy blue whale and fin whale vocalizations fell from 2007 to 2016 at various recording sites in the southern Indian Ocean.  Because of a whale’s anatomy, a louder call is higher in pitch and a quieter one is lower. Essentially, the whales have gotten slightly quieter, said Emmanuelle Leroy, now a research fellow at the University of New South Wales and an author of the new research. “Blue whales are mostly solitary, so to communicate across large distance, they need to produce really low-frequency and high-intensity calls,” she said. “The calls are really loud and will propagate over a few hundreds of kilometers.” Her team has two hypotheses to explain the drop in pitch across years. With the populations rebounding since the end of commercial whaling, perhaps the whales don’t need their calls to carry as far to be heard by others.  [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] Or perhaps with oceans acidifying because of climate change, the calls are naturally carrying farther, allowing the whales to reduce their volume. The team does not believe the change in pitch is tied directly to human activity. Their research, published in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans, also showed that the call pitch of the Antarctic blue whales varies across seasons, with pitches increasing by .1 hertz during the spring and summer and dropping at other times.  That might be the whales’ response to the loud cleaving of icebergs in the spring and summer. These extremely loud sounds — like the cracking of ice in a glass — make it harder for the whales to hear one another, so they crank up the volume, Dr. Leroy said. Dr. Noad thinks the overall drop in pitch could be a reflection of the aging of the population, with older whales making deeper sounds.  (Contrary to other scientists, he also believes that whales can hear human-made noises from quite a distance, in the same way that people in urban environments can hear the distant rumble of traffic even if there are no cars passing directly by.) Humpback whales have made a “really nice comeback” since commercial whaling was largely stopped in the 1960s, Dr. Noad said. But for unknown reasons, blue and fin whales are still struggling; just a few thousand Antarctic blue whales remain. In yet another new study related to whale song, researchers at Woods Hole found that short-finned pilot whales living off the coast of Hawaii have their own vocal dialects, suggesting that different groups are purposely avoiding one another.  Relatively little is known about this species’ behavior. The new research provides a better sense of the social ties between whale groups, which could promote understanding of their genetic diversity and evolution, as well as conservation, the researchers said.

At the same time, Jackson fans swarmed Twitter, criticizing the documentary and his accusers. By the time he died at age 50 in 2009, Jackson had been trailed by allegations of child sexual abuse for more than 15 years. But “Leaving Neverland” contains granular, disturbing detail that could reshape his legacy for years to come: A secret system of bells to warn when other adults were approaching. A mock wedding ceremony with a young boy, complete with a gold ring studded with diamonds. Parents who were only too happy to be guests at Neverland, unaware what was happening to their sons a few closed doors away. The Michael Jackson estate has denied all of the allegations, likened the documentary to a character attack and sued HBO. Part Two airs on Monday night, but is already available to stream on HBO Go and HBO Now. [Michael Jackson’s fans are tenacious. | Our critic Wesley Morris reviews the documentary.] Here are some key points and a sampling of more viewer reactions from Part One: The movie shows how two boys and their families were pulled deep into Jackson’s orbit through fame and show business. Wade Robson, an aspiring dancer who became a successful choreographer as an adult, met Jackson after winning a dance competition. His mother, Joy, went so far as to move herself, Wade and her daughter to Los Angeles from their native Australia, leaving behind her husband and eldest son, on promises that Jackson would work with them to make Wade a star. James Safechuck met Jackson when he was cast in a Pepsi commercial that featured Jackson, and at age 10, Safechuck joined Jackson on tour. His mother, Stephanie, recounts meeting celebrities like Sean Connery, flying first class and being chauffeured in limousines. James describes the otherworldly frenzy of just walking with Jackson to his car, slicing through waves of screaming fans. Every night, he said, he would sleep in a hotel room with Jackson. His mother recounts that as the tour went on, her room got farther and farther from the one her son and Jackson shared. “Everybody wanted to meet Michael or be with Michael,” James Safechuck says as the film opens. “He was already larger than life. And then he likes you.” He nurtured relationships, including with the boys’ mothers. He spent hours on the phone with James and Wade, but he would also call their moms, just to talk to them. Jackson also spent time at the Safechucks’ modest home in Simi Valley, Calif. He could have been anywhere in the world, Stephanie Safechuck said, but he chose to be with them. “He was a son I started to take care for,” Stephanie Safechuck said. “He would spend the night, I’d wash his clothes.” She said that she once told Jackson that she had prayed for her son’s success in getting into commercials, and that he went on to find success right away. In response, she said, Jackson told her that he had prayed, too. He had prayed for a friend, and then he found James. The Neverland Ranch was Jackson’s California compound that included an arcade, an amusement park, an assortment of exotic animals and a train station. It was the perfect playground for children, and in the documentary it is also portrayed as the perfect place to keep children apart from their parents. Robson’s and Safechuck’s families were offered rooms in a guesthouse, which was separate from the main house where the boys would each stay with Jackson. Wade Robson’s mother, Joy, recounts that she got the sense during one long visit that her son and Jackson were avoiding her — and in such a big place, that was easy to do. She said she spent a lot of time alone and with Jackson’s chimpanzees. [“Leaving Neverland” could threaten the fortunes of Jackson’s thriving estate.] One of the most uncomfortable sequences in the film is when James Safechuck recounts all the places in Neverland where he said that he and Jackson had sex: On a blanket in Jackson’s closet, where several doors and a system of bells would alert them if someone was coming. In a private screening room at the back of the movie theater. In a house filled with Jackson’s memorabilia, such as a rhinestone jacket he wore to the Grammys. In an attic. In a castle in the theme park. In an upstairs room in the train station. The property had been for sale for several years, with an asking price as high as $100 million, and was recently listed with new brokers for $31 million. James Safechuck takes a small gold ring, studded with diamonds, out of a jewelry box and slips it onto his finger. It doesn’t fit past the fingernail of his adult hand. This was the ring, he said, that he and Jackson used in a mock wedding ceremony. When they went to a jewelry store to pick it out, they pretended Jackson was buying it for a woman whose hands were small, like the boy’s. As each sits alone in front of the camera, Robson and Safechuck recount a frightening pattern of abuse by Jackson, made even more disturbing by the similarities between them. Both said Jackson would ask them to get on all fours so he could look at them from behind while he masturbated. He asked them to rub his nipples. He would perform oral sex on them and they on him. He showed them pornography. Safechuck says the abuse started when he was 10. Robson says it began when he was 7. They say it went on for years. Jackson was the subject of two child molestation investigations during his lifetime. The first time, Jackson reached a settlement with the boy who accused him and no charges were filed against him. The second time, after a trial, Jackson was acquitted. [Read a timeline of Jackson’s history of sexual abuse allegations.] Jackson’s defenders have pointed out that both Safechuck and Robson have told the authorities in the past that they were not molested by Jackson, and that Robson took the stand in Jackson’s defense during the trial. Both men said that Jackson had trained them for those moments for years, drilling into them that if anyone found out, their lives would be over, or that he and they would go to jail. The Jackson family and his estate have emphatically denied the allegations, though neither they nor any other Jackson supporters appear in the film. “The creators of this film were not interested in the truth,” the family said in a statement. “They never interviewed a single solitary soul who knew Michael except the two perjurers and their families.” The statement said that Jackson “was and always will be 100 percent innocent of these false allegations.” Last month, the coexecutors of Jackson’s estate sued HBO and its parent company, Time Warner, for $100 million for breach of contract, saying that by airing the documentary, HBO violated a nondisparagement clause in a 1992 contract it signed before airing a Jackson concert in Romania. HBO said it would not change course. “Despite the desperate lengths taken to undermine the film, our plans remain unchanged,” HBO said in a statement. “This will allow everyone the opportunity to assess the film and the claims in it for themselves.” Devoted Jackson fans had been girding themselves for the documentary, and through a loose network of pro-Jackson websites and hashtags began planning to counteract the film. When it began, they overwhelmed the #LeavingNeverland hashtag with thousands of tweets calling the men liars and the film a work of fiction. The celebrity gossip and news feed Baller Alert also posted a series of skeptical tweets. The Jackson estate encouraged people to watch the Romanian concert instead. And Taj Jackson, the singer’s nephew and longtime defender, parried with a critic. But as Part One moved into more disturbing territory, viewers began reacting with disgust, shock and sadness. Some asked why the men’s parents had allowed them to get so close to Jackson. The second half of the documentary, airing on HBO Monday night and available for streaming now, moves through Jackson’s trial, introduces Robson’s and Safechuck’s wives, and takes the audience through their decision, after years of publicly proclaiming Jackson’s innocence, to come forward with their accounts.

5c6865143a125f5075c0a159,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/16/opinion/sunday/michael-jackson-leaving-neverland.html,"When Dan Reed ordered up a score for his documentary, he asked the composer to evoke the image of a shimmering sprite leading two boys deeper and deeper into an enchanted forest. The boys don’t notice that the trees grow menacing. And suddenly, the sprite turns into a monster. As “Leaving Neverland” shows, Michael Jackson spent his life shape-shifting from best pal, father figure and beneficent idol into cruel, manipulative rapist. It was apparent for decades that Jackson’s cotton-candy lair was sulfurous. But as with other monsters — Harvey Weinstein, Bill Cosby, R. Kelly, Woody Allen, Jeffrey Epstein and Bryan Singer — many turned a blind eye. Celebrity supersedes criminality. How can you see clearly when you’re looking into the sun? How can an icon be a con? It was easier to ignore a landscape designed as a spider web for child sexual abuse than to give up the soundtrack of our lives, the catchy songs that coursed through memories of weddings, bar mitzvahs and other good times. “With Michael Jackson, you can see how grotesquely his fame, and our worship of fame, distorts and excuses and enables evil — to the point mothers fail to protect their children and literally throw them in harm’s way,” says Maureen Orth, who did groundbreaking stories in the ’90s for Vanity Fair about both Jackson and Allen. Indeed, the most harrowing part of the new documentary about the shredded lives of two of Jackson’s victims is the complicity of their mothers. Jackson spent as much time grooming the mothers as the sons, to the point where the women saw nothing wrong in letting their children share a bed with a grown man. (The documentary, which left the audience stunned at Sundance last month, premieres on HBO next month.) Reed is a Brit who made several documentaries about terrorism. He says he became practiced at leading victims gently back to their traumas, so they could use their minds as cameras to bring key moments to life, letting their faces and voices tell the stories. And that is how the tragedies of James Safechuck and Wade Robson unfold, through the pain in their eyes and the confusion in their voices and the moments where they tear up or swallow hard. Safechuck, who works as a computer programmer, was raised in Simi Valley. He met Jackson when he was a 9-year-old child actor in 1987, starring with the singer in a Pepsi commercial. Jackson promised to make the boy the next Spielberg. Robson, a dance teacher who did choreography for Britney Spears and ’N Sync, grew up on the other side of the world in Brisbane. He spent all his time dressing and dancing like Jackson. He won a dance contest in 1987 and got to meet Jackson, who was on tour in Australia, and dance onstage. Then, he was ensnared in the warped fantasy, a 7-year-old being initiated into sex at Neverland by the 31-year-old Jackson. The mothers, Stephanie Safechuck and Joy Robson, knew that Jackson was ensorcelling their sons, even as he lured the mothers out of the frame with luxurious enticements. But they were stage mothers and fans, so they chose to believe Michael was a kind, lonely little boy at heart, not a heartless pedophile, and they did not dig deeper when their sons said nothing bad was going on. “He flies you first class, you have a limo waiting for you at the airport, amazing, you know, it’s a life of the rich and famous,” Mrs. Safechuck gushes in the film, adding: “I got to meet Sean Connery. That was big for me. It was like, ‘Oh my God, Sean Connery!’” She also loved Neverland: “He had a beautiful wine cellar, really good wines, champagne, that was just something I enjoyed — it was a fairy tale every night.” After all, as she says, he was a genius and they were “just nobodies.” Jackson bought them a house after James testified on the singer’s behalf in a trial involving another boy. It somehow made sense to James’s mother when she was told that she couldn’t be near the hotel rooms her son and Michael shared in Europe because the nicer suites she would prefer were farther away. As Wade Robson puts it, “What you’d think would be standard kind of instincts and judgment seemed to go out the window.” His mother left Australia and his father and moved to L.A. with Wade and her daughter to be closer to Michael; the father later committed suicide. After Wade finally told a therapist and his wife and family what had happened, he was alienated from his mother for a time. Like James, Wade — who lied in court twice to protect the man he loved — had symptoms of trauma that intensified with the birth of his son. James’s hands shake as he shows a diamond ring that Jackson gave him for a private mock wedding. Wade had a nervous breakdown and stopped dancing for a time. “I had one job” and messed it up, Mrs. Safechuck says. “My son had to suffer for me to have this life.” Even with this shocking documentary, the Michael Jackson estate is still demonizing the victims and planning to bring a musical about Jackson’s life to Broadway in 2020. Reed says he is “agnostic” about it: “Am I going to campaign to have Michael’s name removed from classrooms and his statues removed from shopping malls? No. Is this the right time to celebrate Michael as a legitimate good person you might want to emulate? Possibly not.” And that is what’s known as British understatement. "
5c840deb49f0eacbf105c3ab,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/09/us/politics/amy-klobuchar-2020-staff-interview.html,"There was no real doubt what the first question to Senator Amy Klobuchar would be. Backstage at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Tex., where Ms. Klobuchar was the first in a series of presidential candidates to be interviewed on Saturday, the interviewer, Kara Swisher, asked: “Do you want to start with the comb or end with the comb?” “We’re going to start with the comb,” Ms. Swisher, the co-founder of the technology news website Recode and a contributing opinion writer for The New York Times, concluded. “The comb” was a reference to a February New York Times article about how Ms. Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat, treats her staff in the Senate. In 2008, The Times reported, an aide bought her a salad in an airport but fumbled the plastic utensils. On the plane, Ms. Klobuchar berated the aide, pulled a comb out of her purse and ate the salad with it. “It was me sort of doing a mom thing,” Ms. Klobuchar responded at Saturday’s event, co-sponsored by The Texas Tribune. “I didn’t have a fork. I used a comb to eat a salad very briefly on a plane in a MacGyver move.” The fact that Ms. Klobuchar ate salad with a comb was not the main conclusion of the Times report. She did not mention on Saturday that, after finishing the salad, she handed the comb to the aide and ordered him to clean it. The article, based on interviews with more than two dozen former aides, also included details about how her Senate office employees who took paid parental leave were expected to stay in their job for three times as many weeks as they had taken off — and that if they didn’t, according to an employee handbook, they would be required to pay back the money earned during their leave. In response to the article, Ms. Klobuchar’s office said it had never enforced that policy and would change the handbook. She did not address that on Saturday, and Ms. Swisher did not ask. Ms. Klobuchar, who has previously said she “can be tough on people,” acknowledged — as she has in past responses to reports on her treatment of her staff — that she was “sometimes too tough.” “I can push them too hard,” she said. “I can always do better.” Ms. Swisher then asked if Ms. Klobuchar felt the coverage of her treatment of staff members was sexist, given that many male politicians act similarly. “I’m not going to go there,” she said, adding, “Whatever it is, I just can’t waste my time analyzing it, because the stakes are too high, and I care too much. That’s why I announced my candidacy in the middle of a blizzard by the Mississippi River.” In the rest of the interview, Ms. Klobuchar and Ms. Swisher had wide-ranging discussions on health care, technology, foreign policy and other issues. Ms. Klobuchar expressed support for several policies to lower drug prices, including importing products from Canada (“In Minnesota, we can see Canada from our porch,” she joked); ending the “pay for delay” practice in which big pharmaceutical companies pay manufacturers not to produce generics; and allowing the government to negotiate drug prices with Medicare, a perennial proposal from Democrats. She criticized the relatively short sentence given to the former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort in his financial fraud case this week, citing her experience prosecuting white-collar crime and declaring, “You can’t have two systems of justice, one for the rich and powerful and one for everyone else.” She denounced President Trump for his attacks on the news media, saying he “tweets whatever he wants in the morning but doesn’t respect the amendment that allows him to do it.” She also said she disagreed with Representative Ilhan Omar’s recent comments about American politicians’ support for Israel, “because I believe you can be true to your country and advocate for another country, whether it is Israel or Canada or Ethiopia” — but condemned Mr. Trump for emboldening intolerance, including anti-Semitism, and noted Ms. Omar’s own background as a refugee. Asked about a recent proposal by Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, another presidential candidate, to break up big tech companies like Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook, Ms. Klobuchar refused to commit to it. But she endorsed antitrust action and the breakup of monopolies broadly as “one of the governing principles for ensuring that we have a capitalist system.” Ms. Warren also appeared at South by Southwest on Saturday, speaking with Anand Giridharadas of Time magazine. Mr. Giridharadas began the interview by telling everyone in the audience who either worked for or hoped to work for one of those tech giants to stand, and then asking Ms. Warren to explain to them why she wanted to break up their companies. Picking Amazon as her example, Ms. Warren condemned the ability of such giants to, essentially, play on a field they control. Amazon not only runs a marketplace, she said, but uses its vast trove of information about consumers’ behavior in the marketplace to create and promote its own products. “You can be an umpire — a platform — or you can own teams. That’s fine. But you can’t be an umpire and own one of the teams that’s in the game,” she said. “Break those things apart and we will have a much more competitive, robust market in America. That’s how capitalism should work.” “The monopolist will make fewer monopoly profits,” she added. “Boo-hoo.” Pressed on what this outlook said about her philosophical differences with Senator Bernie Sanders, who is running on a democratic socialist platform, Ms. Warren said she wanted capitalism to work better. “There’s an enormous amount to be gained from markets,” she said. “But markets have to have rules. They have to have a cop on the beat. Markets without rules are theft.” As in her stump speeches, Ms. Warren also spoke at length about the systemic effects of racism, especially in worsening economic inequality. In the 1960s, she noted, when redlining and other forms of housing discrimination were legal, the homeownership gap between black and white Americans was 27 percentage points. Today, it is 30 percentage points. “Race matters,” she said. “And until we say so and attack the problem head on, we are not going to fix it.” "
5c7df49e49f0eacbf105b573,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/04/arts/television/oprah-michael-jackson.html,"On a recent afternoon, an audience composed mostly of survivors of sexual abuse sat in the Times Center auditorium in Manhattan for a preview screening of Dan Reed’s “Leaving Neverland,” to be followed by a Q. and A. led by Oprah Winfrey. The documentary, which aired on HBO in two parts on Sunday and Monday, profiles Wade Robson and James Safechuck, two men who say Michael Jackson sexually abused them when they were children. The final hour of the film pivots from the graphic, triggering details of molestation that Robson and Safechuck say occurred for several years to the emotional fallout in their adulthood. At the screening, audience members could be heard sniffling, sighing and crying during moments when Robson and Safechuck spoke of their struggles to come forward to their families. [Michael Jackson’s tenacious fans. | “Leaving Neverland” Part 2 recap.] There were also emphatic cheers and bursts of applause on several occasions, as when Safechuck’s mother, Stephanie, recalls dancing on the day Jackson died and exclaiming, “Oh, thank God he can’t hurt any more children.” Then, at the conclusion of the viewing, came nearly 90 minutes of processing with Winfrey. The lights came up, the cameras turned on and Winfrey, Safechuck, Robson and Reed ascended the stage to record “Oprah Winfrey Presents: After Neverland.” The hourlong special, which aired Monday evening on both HBO and OWN immediately following the conclusion of “Leaving Neverland,” was a return to the audience-involved, talk-show therapy format that she perfected over 25 seasons of “The Oprah Winfrey Show.” Winfrey solicited responses from some of the abuse survivors seated before her, and called upon Howard R. Fradkin, a psychological trauma consultant specializing in male sexual abuse, to speak about patterns of grooming and manipulation. But at the center of those teaching moments were Robson and Safechuck. At first, Winfrey asked them to elaborate on how they came to recognize themselves as victims and seek help, and invited them to unpack the ways in which they say Jackson compelled them into years of silence. Talk eventually turned to suspicions of their motives, and the assertions by superfans and the Jackson family that Robson and Safechuck are only coming forward for financial gain. Reed emphatically denied that either of the men or their families received compensation for the film. Robson said that a lawsuit he filed against the Jackson estate in 2013 was about doing “something good with this bad,” not about remuneration. He saw the legal system as a “platform” to tell his story in a scenario where the estate would “have to listen” and “have to sit there.” “Michael trained me and forced me to tell the lie for so many years, and particularly on the stand,” he continued. “And those were really traumatizing experiences for me that had a huge impact on the rest of my life. So the feeling was, I want an opportunity to reprocess that experience. I want to get on the stand again, because now I’m able to tell the truth.” (Robson’s suit was thrown out by a judge because too much time had passed. Safechuck sued the following year and was also unsuccessful. Both cases are under appeal.) The Jackson family has denied all of the allegations and publicly condemned the film, and the estate is suing HBO for $100 million. Winfrey seemed fully aware of the optics of her interview: “All the anger — you guys are going to get it. You know that, right?” She continued, “You’re going to get it. I’m going to get it. We’re all going to get it.” At various points during the taping, Winfrey mentioned, in passing, her own experience as a survivor of child abuse. Curiously, there was no mention of her personal connection to Jackson — in particular, the famous 1993 live interview with him at Neverland Ranch, which took place just months before the first public accusations against him were made. In that interview, she was an unabashed fan (“I think ‘King of Pop’ is actually too limiting,” she told him, referring to his moniker), but based on her conversation with Reed, Robson and Safechuck, it’s clear her perception of Jackson has shifted. Winfrey explained at the beginning of the taping that she reached out to Reed after watching the documentary, and told him that he had done “in four hours what I tried to do in 217 episodes” dedicated to educating her audience about sexual abuse. As the conversation wound down, the subject turned to absolution. When the accusers were asked if they had forgiven Jackson, Safechuck admitted that he felt guilt just the weekend before for speaking out. “Like I let him down,” he said. “Like — it’s still there. The shadow’s still there.” Winfrey concluded the show with words of inspiration for survivors and the importance of education around abuse, and the audience in the theater gave a standing ovation that emanated a collective catharsis. Robson had one last thing to say, however — a direct address to the audience in the theater. “As so many of you know, being a survivor is so isolating,” he said. “At least it is for a really long time. So to be in this space with you guys, the brothers and sisters in trauma and in triumph — that we’re standing, you know, and we’re here, I’m just so grateful.” "

5cb441e849f0eacbf1f8419c,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/15/world/asia/indonesia-election-islam.html,"JAKARTA, Indonesia — Joko Widodo, the Muslim president of Indonesia, is into heavy metal and saving Christians. Earlier in his political career, he helped shelter ethnic Chinese Christians during deadly rioting. And upon winning the presidency in 2014, Mr. Joko filled his cabinet with women and banned a radical Islamic group that calls for Islamic law to replace Indonesia’s democracy. His election was seen as a victory for the moderate Islam that has long flourished in this country. But this time around, as he runs for re-election on Wednesday against a pugnacious former general who has embraced the language of hard-line, Middle Eastern Islam, Mr. Joko is veering rightward. At a Saturday campaign rally, he pointedly gave thanks to Muslim preachers, and on Sunday he visited Mecca. For his vice-presidential running mate, Mr. Joko chose Ma’ruf Amin, the 76-year-old head of the Indonesian Ulema Council, which has issued fatwas against homosexuality and the wearing of Santa hats by Muslims. No hip-gyrating traditional dancing, no premarital sex and certainly no headbanging heavy metal allowed. Nearly 5,000 miles from the birthplace of Islam, Indonesia, the nation with the world’s largest Muslim population, has been widely seen as proof that Islam and democracy can coexist and prosper. “Indonesia is a country with more than 260 million people, with a geographical area of at least 17,000 islands,” Lukman Hakim Saifuddin, Indonesia’s minister of religious affairs, said in an interview. “People still treasure and respect the diversity, the differences.” Yet as the Muslim world has wrestled with Islam’s role in modern society, Indonesia, too, has engaged in a national spiritual reckoning. In recent years, the country’s Muslim majority has embraced more overt signs of religiosity and shifted toward Arab-style devotion: flowing clothes and veils, Arabic names and Middle Eastern devotional architecture. Most of all, a puritanical Salafist interpretation of Islam, which draws inspiration from the age of the Prophet Muhammad, is attracting followers in Indonesia. Bureaucrats steeped in austere Wahhabism draw converts in government prayer halls. Hundreds of Indonesians joined the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, and hundreds of thousands more cheer for the group on social media. Pushed aside are the syncretic traditions that were long the hallmark of Indonesian Islam, a blending with indigenous beliefs that gave the faith its distinct local flavor. “In Indonesia, Salafi ideology has penetrated urban and rural, civil servants and villagers,” said Din Wahid, a theologian at Syarif Hidayatullah State Islamic University. “They see corruption all around them and say that it is only Shariah and restoring a caliphate that will be able to fix society.” Mr. Joko’s opponent in the election on Wednesday, Prabowo Subianto — the European-educated son of a Christian and a connoisseur of fine wines — may seem an unlikely figurehead for hard-line Islam. But he is an astute politician who has shouted for jihad and vowed to welcome home from self-imposed exile Rizieq Shihab, the head of the Islamic Defenders Front, which gained notoriety for attacking nightclubs in Jakarta, the capital, and calling for Shariah law. “Political Islam has strengthened tremendously over the last two decades in Indonesia,” said Andreas Harsono, an Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch and author of the new book “Race, Islam and Power.” “We should be very concerned, because both sides in the campaign have now made human rights and democracy decline.” Faith politics exploded in late 2016 when millions of Indonesians marched in the streets of Jakarta to protest what they considered blasphemous language from Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, a Christian who was then the Jakarta governor. Mr. Ma’ruf, Mr. Joko’s surprising choice of running mate this year, was one of the drivers of those protests. Mr. Basuki, widely known as Ahok, was jailed for 20 months. Mr. Joko declined to defend his former deputy. “Ahok’s downfall was because of populism, like Trump or Brexit,” said Zuhairi Misrawi, a researcher for Nahdlatul Ulama, the world’s largest Islamic social organization, which promotes moderate Islam. “Now, political parties are aiming to get more votes by showing how Islamic they are, and it is changing our Indonesian political identity.” Even Mr. Lukman, the religious affairs minister under Mr. Joko, tries to thread the needle on the role of faith in Indonesian society. “Indonesia is not officially an Islamic state,” he said, sitting in an office decorated solely with Muslim art. “But Indonesia is also not a secular state.” Islam arrived in Indonesia through Arab and Indian merchants. By the 16th century, the faith had displaced or cross-pollinated with Buddhism, Hinduism and animist faiths. Most Muslims here still practice a fusion form of the faith. Traditional Indonesian mosques had thatched or pitched roofs, reminiscent of Hindu temples. Indonesian Muslim festivals feature offerings of flowers to volcanoes. The national dress for women includes a lacy, body-hugging blouse. Beginning in the 1980s, Saudi money began changing the look of Islam in Indonesia. Open-air mosques were replaced by marble, domed edifices. Today, thousands of mosques around the country bear Middle Eastern motifs attesting to their Saudi, Qatari or Kuwaiti funding. Perhaps the most influential Saudi investment in Indonesia is the Institute for the Study of Islam and Arabic, known by the Indonesian acronym, Lipia, where classes are segregated by gender and teach the fundamentalist Wahhabi theology that dominates in Saudi Arabia. “Even though Indonesian Islam is a syncretic, cultural Islam, we are taught that anything from Saudi, the country of Mecca and Medina, must be authentic and good,” said Ulil Abshar Abdalla, the coordinator of the Liberal Islam Network, who studied at Lipia. The university has produced some of Indonesia’s most renowned Islamic scholars. But it has also nurtured militants linked to terrorist attacks across Southeast Asia. Over the past two years, Lipia has expanded across the country, opening at least three new campuses in a country with a shortage of universities. Mainstream Indonesian Muslim leaders resent the inroads that Saudi-inspired Salafism has made here. “Wahhabism is against our culture, and our religion is totally different from the Middle East,” said Mr. Zuhairi of Nahdlatul Ulama, who is helping set up an online presence to compete against the puritanical websites popular with young Indonesians. “Our war is to get moderate Islam to fight for millennial Muslims who are hungry for Islam,” he said. “But people don’t see us as passionate, as charismatic. It’s hard to change this.” The flowering of a more conservative Islam in Indonesia accelerated after the overthrow of Suharto in 1998, after more than three decades of corrupt, dictatorial rule. What followed was a federalist exuberance that gave local governments newfound authority. The province of Aceh, for example, is now under Shariah, with public flogging for adulterers or those who drink alcohol. “Salafism is a magnet for people because it’s very simple and easy to understand,” said Mr. Ulil of the Liberal Islam Network. “It gives the impression that it’s based on prophetic, pure scripture while others, like us, are not authoritative.” When Zaenal Abidin started building a Salafist community on the outskirts of Jakarta in 1998, three families joined him. Now there are 300, many of them middle-class government employees, who send their children to Mr. Zaenal’s Islamic school. “We were colonized for so long by Christians, so we have an inferiority complex,” he said. “But this is a country with the world’s largest number of Muslims, so we must show our true Islamic nature.” As it has elsewhere in the Muslim world, conservative dress has become more common in Indonesia. Polygamy and child marriage are also on the rise here, as democracy has allowed personal freedoms repressed during the Suharto era to prosper. “Radical groups understand that they can use democracy to their advantage,” said Musdah Mulia, a professor of Islamic political thought at Syarif Hidayatullah State Islamic University. “They say that democracy is bad because it allows infidels to have a vote, but then they manipulate it for themselves.” "
5c89793549f0eacbf105ceaa,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/13/technology/elizabeth-warren-tech-companies.html,"AUSTIN, Tex. — Among the techies who attended the annual South by Southwest Interactive conference the past few days, the hottest topic of conversation — besides the swarms of drunken idiots careening around Austin on rented electric scooters — was Senator Elizabeth Warren’s ground-shaking proposal to break up large tech companies like Amazon, Google and Facebook. In her proposal, which she released on the eve of the conference, Ms. Warren argued that these companies have abused their power and harmed competition in two big ways. The first is by offering their own products on platforms they control: Amazon giving preferential treatment to its house brands, or Apple promoting its own apps inside the iOS App Store. Ms. Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat and presidential candidate, argues that the companies should be required to do one or the other — sell their own goods or run a third-party marketplace — but not both. “You can be an umpire or you can own teams,” she said. “But you can’t be an umpire and own one of the teams that’s in the game.” Ms. Warren also argues that by acquiring potential competitors, as in Facebook’s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, large tech companies have made it harder for smaller start-ups to compete on fair terms. She proposes appointing regulators who would undo such mergers, and break up the conglomerates. Regulating big tech is quickly becoming a central theme of the 2020 presidential race. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and others have also talked about the need to rein in the tech giants. And Ms. Warren has demonstrated more technology literacy than most elected officials. But many of the tech-industry insiders I spoke with in Austin, including some who agree with Ms. Warren that the big companies are too powerful, cautioned that some of the details in her proposal were too vague, and could backfire if put into effect as written. Ms. Warren’s plan is a bold first stab at reform, and some of her proposals make a lot of sense. But I’d offer a few edits. Apply specific fixes to specific problems. One shortcoming in Ms. Warren’s plan — and it’s an understandable one, given that this is a campaign proposal and not a final set of rules — is that it proposes broad solutions to narrow problems. Lawmakers don’t typically craft regulations for individual companies. That’s for good reason: A law that specifically targeted Amazon, and not its competitors, would be seen as creating an unfair double standard. Instead, Ms. Warren’s proposal targets technology companies with more than $25 billion in annual revenue that operate third-party marketplaces — a group that includes Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google — and proposes a set of rules that apply to all of them, as well as any companies that meet the threshold in the future. (Microsoft, which makes more than $25 billion in annual revenue and has a third-party marketplace in the form of the Windows app store, was somehow spared.) The problem with applying a one-size-fits-four model to tech, as the industry analyst Ben Thompson has written, is that the large tech companies have different business models that pose different anti-competitive risks. The stranglehold that Google and Facebook have on the digital advertising market is different from the way Amazon muscles out e-commerce brands, which is different from the way Apple uses its App Store to force burdensome terms on developers. The possibility of unintended consequences means that tailoring regulations to address each of these problems is important. A law that banned Amazon from competing with third-party sellers on its platform could also cripple Chromebook laptops, or prevent iPhone users from getting access to their iTunes libraries. Rather than one giant package that crams everything together, a set of effective tech regulations would treat each problem discretely, and address each with surgical precision. Split off cloud businesses. Ms. Warren proposes having big tech companies split off significant chunks of their businesses, like separating Google’s ad operations from its search engine. But she does not mention one of the clearest examples of oligopolistic behavior in the tech industry: cloud computing. Right now, much of the internet is powered by infrastructure owned by a small number of giant tech companies that include Amazon, Microsoft and Google. These companies make a killing by renting out data storage, computing power and other essential services to other businesses, essentially selling the picks and shovels of the digital gold rush. The cloud-computing market may not seem like an obvious antitrust target. It is highly competitive, and years of price wars between the giants have driven the costs of these services down. Doesn’t giving young start-ups the ability to rent world-class infrastructure make it easier, not harder, for them to compete? Yes, it does. But the concentration of critical infrastructure among so few companies — each of which also operates enormous consumer-internet businesses of its own — gives those companies enormous power, and invites anti-competitive abuse. For example, let’s imagine that Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s chief executive, decided to sabotage Netflix, which runs on Amazon Web Services, Amazon’s cloud-computing unit, in order to help his company’s streaming video service. He could theoretically tell the Amazon Web Services team to slow Netflix’s traffic, or analyze its usage patterns to determine which Netflix shows Amazon’s streaming-video team should copy. To be clear, Mr. Bezos is extremely unlikely to do that, given that it would be a scandalous violation of Amazon’s privacy policies and would cost the company a lucrative customer. But the reality that companies with dominant internet services also provide the infrastructure that powers much of the consumer internet is a clear example of the kind of market consolidation Ms. Warren is trying to address. An effective breakup proposal could require companies like Amazon, Google and Microsoft to spin their cloud-computing divisions off into stand-alone businesses, in a manner similar to the one Ms. Warren proposed for breaking up e-commerce marketplaces. To adapt her baseball analogy, tech companies would either play on the team or own the stadium, but not both. Get rid of the “app tax.” Another easy, specific fix would be to stop Apple and Google, the makers of the two dominant mobile operating systems, from taking unfair advantage of mobile app developers. At the moment, any company that wants to sell in-app purchases or subscriptions through an iOS app must pay what software developers derisively call the “Apple tax”: a fee of 15 to 30 percent that Apple skims off the top of in-app purchases and subscriptions bought by users. (Google’s mobile app store charges similar fees.) These fees add up quickly. Before it removed in-app subscriptions last year, Netflix was paying Apple an estimated $700,000 a day for the privilege of selling subscriptions in its app. And some competitors have begun to complain that these platforms’ strict developer policies amount to bullying. On Wednesday, Spotify filed a complaint with the European Commission over Apple’s App Store policies, arguing that they unfairly stifle competition. Apple and Google would argue that their fees are justified, because operating an app store requires hiring reviewers and security teams and all kinds of other expenses. But these companies have monopoly control of their own mobile universes, and they have used that power to set up virtual tollbooths that suck billions of dollars a year out of the pockets of smaller competitors. Don’t get lured into a censorship debate. Something bizarre happened on Monday when Facebook momentarily took down several of Ms. Warren’s Facebook ads promoting her proposal to break up big tech. Ms. Warren seized on the episode, saying it was proof of Facebook’s ability to “shut down a debate” over its power. The ads were quickly reinstated, and Facebook made it clear that the removal was not a case of politically motivated censorship. The company has a longstanding policy that limits the use of Facebook’s name in ads, a measure that is mostly meant to prevent sketchy advertisers from claiming falsely to be “Facebook’s official quiz game” or whatever. But the idea that Facebook would censor one of its prominent critics was irresistible to politicians, including Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, and other conservative lawmakers who have spent the past several years complaining that social media platforms are engaging in partisan censorship. “She’s right — Big Tech has way too much power to silence Free Speech,” Mr. Cruz wrote of Ms. Warren in a message on Twitter. One problem with the debate over the tech companies’ power is that it risks conflating real anti-competitive behavior (like Facebook’s shutting off data access to competitors) with imaginary abuses (like Mr. Cruz’s unsupported claims that social media platforms are biased against conservatives). The former is a real menace; the latter is a bad-faith attempt to work the refs and preserve a partisan advantage. But in political discourse, both can be framed as proof of the need for “neutral platforms.” The best advice I could possibly give Ms. Warren, or any other Democrat hoping to bring big tech to heel, is to focus squarely on competition, and to avoid being sucked into partisan debates about content censorship. The worst outcome of a push to regulate big tech companies would be a set of rules that made it easier for people to exploit these companies’ power, while leaving their fortresses intact. "
