5c94c69149f0eacbf105e795,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/22/arts/music/silvana-imam.html,"STOCKHOLM — On a recent Friday night, the Swedish rapper Silvana Imam appeared on stage at Annexet, a concert venue in the south side of Stockholm, dressed like a comic-book villain. Her face hidden by a black mask studded with spikes, she dragged a metal baseball bat across the stage to the loud cheers of her mostly female audience. The menacing display was a theatrical embodiment of the gleefully confrontational role Imam, the lesbian daughter of refugees, has come to play in Swedish pop culture. Imam, whose mother is Lithuanian and father Syrian, is one of the country’s best-known hip-hop artists, and a symbol of the counterreaction to the rise of right-wing populism in Scandinavia’s most populous country. When the mask came off, Imam, 32, launched into “I Min Zon” (“In My Zone”), a languid, withering song from her first EP, in which she rails against racism and sexism in the country. “Fifteen million people in the world are named Mohamed,” she rapped in Swedish, “but whose name do they want to see on the résumé?” Mattias Naxe, 30, a lighting designer in the audience, said that he was drawn to Imam’s music primarily because she was a “very good rapper,” but added that her success was also a reflection of Sweden’s polarized political climate. In last fall’s national election, the right-wing populist Sweden Democrats won 18 percent of the vote, making them the country’s third-largest party. “She came at the right time,” he said, adding that she “very much” represents this particular moment. Although Sweden is known for being one of the world’s premier suppliers of dance-pop, it also has one of Europe’s most vibrant hip-hop scenes. Imam is one of its biggest female stars. In 2014, her breakout single “IMAM,” a political song in which she refers to herself as a “176 centimeter Pussy Riot,” reached number one in the Swedish charts. Since then, she has won numerous awards, including a Swedish Grammi, the country’s equivalent to a Grammy Award, for artist of the year. Her most recent album, “Helig Moder” (“Holy Mother”), released in February, has been widely praised in the Swedish news media, and she was recently announced as the opening act for the main stage of the renowned Roskilde Music Festival in Denmark. In an interview in a coffee shop in the Hornstull neighborhood of Stockholm, where she lives, Imam said she had struggled with the pressure of her success and the fallout from her position as a political provocateur. She explained that her new album was an attempt to come to terms with the “superhero everyone wants me to be, or the one that I’ve become in Scandinavia for a lot of people.” Although Sweden is often seen internationally as a paragon of social liberalism, many of Imam’s songs have highlighted the racism, misogyny and homophobia she believes permeate society here. Her 2015 single “Imam Cobain” included a frequently quoted line instructing the men who “say my love is a crime” to “go and kiss” a “swastika.” Another song called out people offended by the fact that she is a “hybrid,” with Syrian roots. The rise of the Sweden Democrats, she argued, only goes to prove her point. The party, whose slogans include “Keep Sweden Swedish,” has its roots in the neo-Nazi movement and campaigned on severely limiting immigration. “Sweden is finally revealing itself for what it is,” Imam said. The rapper was born in 1986 in communist Lithuania, but her family moved to what was then Czechoslovakia when she was a toddler. When her father, a journalist and lawyer, came under pressure there because of his far-left politics, the family fled to Kiruna, Sweden’s northernmost city, which she described as “very cold” and “with no people of color.” After the family relocated to Stockholm, Imam attended a school in the suburbs where she said there were “neo-Nazis and immigrants, and nothing in between.” A longtime fan of the Fugees and Kanye West, she started performing while completing her degree in English and psychology at the University of Stockholm. Her anger at the far right was galvanized in 2013, when Jimmie Akesson, the leader of the Sweden Democrats, retweeted a photo of her performing at a protest against the far right while wearing a jacket bearing a crossed-out “S.D.,” the party’s initials. The song she performed included the line, “send the pigs to slaughter,” referring to members of the party. Afterward, she received threats from his supporters. “He knew what he was doing. He knew what kinds of followers he had,” she said. The debate around refugees in Sweden, she argued, has become untethered from reality. “The claim that we can’t afford the refugees isn’t fact-based,” Imam said. Tax avoidance by large companies was a bigger drain on the economy, she added. In 2015, one of Imam’s cousins was among the many thousands of migrants attempting to make their way across the Mediterranean into Europe after the outbreak of the Syrian civil war. The incident, she recalled, affected her deeply. “She sent me a photo of her boat, with just water and three sandwiches, and I thought this was crazy,” she said. The cousin and her two children ultimately ended up in Denmark. Ametist Azordegan, a radio host and producer currently writing a book about Swedish hip-hop, described Imam by phone as one of the country’s “top hip-hop artists” and one of the “absolute best” lyricists, and argued that she “has built a space for gay, young women that hasn’t existed in the media in Sweden.” Christina Tsiobanelis, one of the three co-directors of “Silvana,” a documentary about Imam’s early career that played in movie theaters around Europe, said in a phone interview that the rapper’s success coincided with not only the rise of the far right, but also the growth of an increasingly vocal feminist movement in the country. “If she had come up three years earlier, she might not have become that successful,” she said. The film, which won a Guldbagge Award, the Swedish equivalent of an Oscar, for best documentary, also chronicled the beginnings of Imam’s relationship with Beatrice Eli, a Swedish pop singer. The two remain together, and have recorded several duets. In Imam’s view, they are the country’s first prominent lesbian couple to be “cool and young.” She added, after a pause, “and hot.” At Annexet, Eli appeared on stage to perform with Imam in “Magi Som Orlando,” a sexually charged duet. They pressed into each other as the crowd cheered. Then, a few minutes later, the stage turned into a raucous celebration reflecting Imam’s cultural and sexual identities. Two belly dancers and a row of women in traditional Arab costume gyrated on the stage, while another dancer balanced on her head. Silvana jumped up and down, laughing. “Silvana is a symbol for the new Swedish girl,” said Leonora Haag, 20, who watched in the audience. “Swedish people are very much a collective, you don’t stand out. What’s amazing about her is that she just doesn’t care.” "
5ca234ad49f0eacbf1f7b22a,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/01/dining/madhur-jaffrey-rap-video-mr-cardamom.html,"The halal cart was shaking. Inside the hot tin box, the 85-year-old actress and cookbook author Madhur Jaffrey, masked in giant sunglasses and a rippling white wig, was hopping up and down and making profane gestures with both hands. It was Day Two of the video shoot for “Nani,” a rap song by Zohran Mamdani, a young Queens M.C. who calls himself Mr. Cardamom. The elegantly feline Ms. Jaffrey — best known for her roles in the Merchant-Ivory film “Shakespeare Wallah” (1965) and, more recently, the NBC sitcom “I Feel Bad” — was incarnating a gangster granny who refuses to submit to her son’s bleating demands for less meddling and more dutiful child care. In the video, which debuted Monday online, the character describes herself as “85 years gold” and “the best damn Nani that you ever done seen,” among other assertions too colorful for this newspaper. She is prone to slapping bothersome men on the street (who cower even as they loom over her) and insisting that restaurant maîtres d’ come grovel and refill her water glass. “It’s like playing Lady Macbeth,” Ms. Jaffrey said. “If you’re an actress, you have to play everything.” In what may be the unlikeliest pairing since Martha Stewart and Snoop Dogg, Ms. Jaffrey agreed last spring to appear in Mr. Mamdani’s video after he wooed her over a cup of chai.  “I thought, I can do this,” Ms. Jaffrey said. “Then I read the words.” She watched rap videos as research, and grew nervous. The biggest challenge: to mouth the lyrics at top speed, while staying on the beat. The song was written two years ago as a homage to Mr. Mamdani’s then 85-year-old nani (grandmother), Praveen Nair, a former social worker in Delhi, India, and a founder of the Salaam Baalak Trust, which helps underprivileged children living on the streets. “She has gone against the grain in so many different ways,” he said. This manifests in the video as a fantastical vision of her running a crime syndicate and recruiting children at Khan’s tutoring center in Jackson Heights, Queens, who are supposed to be preparing for the city’s Specialized High Schools Admissions Test. “It’s an Indian ‘I Will Survive’ kind of song,” Ms. Jaffrey said. For many in the desi diaspora, Ms. Jaffrey is a revered figure, almost single-handedly responsible for introducing the complexities of Indian food to the West, and asserting its place in the pantheon of great world cuisines. A mutual friend approached Ms. Jaffrey on Mr. Mamdani’s behalf, and she was intrigued. The two met, and he pleaded his case, then proceeded to build the video around her, weaving in clips from her movies and TV cooking shows. Mr. Mamdani, 27, was born in Kampala, Uganda, and moved to New York at age 7. In his official, buttoned-up life, he counsels homeowners facing foreclosure. But he has always had an alter ego as a musician. As a junior at the Bronx High School of Science, he ran for class vice president with a rapped platform promising freshly squeezed juices for all. He lost. Four years ago, he reinvented himself as Young Cardamom, and with his childhood friend Abdul Bar Hussein (a.k.a. HAB) recorded “Kanda (Chap Chap),” a rap about the fatty, greasy splendor of Ugandan-style chapati. (At one point in the video, the flatbread spins on a turntable.) “#1 Spice,” the duo’s biggest hit, was written for the 2016 movie “Queen of Katwe,” where it is first sung by a child in Uganda selling salt, then blasted as a full-fledged rap over the credits: “Bring the flavor to the fish, bring the flavor to the rice / Who’s the number-one spice?” (The film was directed by Mr. Mamdani’s mother, Mira Nair, whose work includes the Oscar-nominated “Salaam Bombay!”) Mr. Mamdani wanted his first solo video as Mr. Cardamom (“Better drop the act that I’m young,” he said) to be “a love letter to desi New York.” So the crew wound its way from an apartment in Parkchester in the eastern Bronx, a neighborhood home to many Bangladeshi immigrants, to Kabab King, a nostalgically dingy 24-hour diner and cabby sanctuary in Jackson Heights. “The service is horrendous, and it’s beautiful,” Mr. Mamdani said. “You can make direct eye contact with someone and they will not come to your table.” The owners let him shoot without charge. There were few frills on set. Mr. Mamdani asked a friend to arrange Ms. Jaffrey’s transportation, and was horrified to learn later that she’d had to share a Lyft from her home in Greenwich Village. “Somebody carried my shoes,” Ms. Jaffrey recalled. Between takes, she swapped recipes with the crew and offered tips on difficult ingredients like bitter gourd: “We don’t cut down on the bitterness — we think it’s good for you.” The shoot took place last May, during the holy month of Ramadan, a difficult time for a Muslim rapper to make a video celebrating food. Mr. Mamdani fasted for the first day, but couldn’t make it through the second, not with kebabs so close at hand. It took nearly a year to finish the video. Among other obstacles, one would-be editor pocketed Mr. Mamdani’s hard drive and was never heard from again. In the meantime, Ms. Jaffrey shot the first season of “I Feel Bad” (the series is awaiting renewal) and wrote a cookbook, out this May, dedicated to the pleasures of the Instant Pot. “If you follow my directions — not the Instant Pot directions — any rice comes out perfect,” she said. When Mr. Mamdani tried to pay her for her work on the video, she refused. But she kept the yellow beret he had bought as a final, Che Guevara-esque touch for her costume. Mr. Mamdani likes to imagine her wearing it every now and then, eyebrow cocked, still prowling the streets as Nani. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest.

5ca6950749f0eacbf1f8102c,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/04/obituaries/a-rapper-who-came-back-for-his-neighborhood.html,"Nipsey Hussle’s raps boasted of his exploits as a young man in South Central Los Angeles and the perils of becoming a gang member. But his music was also a path to a more legitimate life for him and an inspiration and exhortation to others in his situation. Hussle, who was 33 when he was shot and killed in Los Angeles on Sunday in what police said appeared to be a personal dispute, was born Ermias Joseph Asghedom in Los Angeles on Aug. 15, 1985, to Dawit Asghedom and Angelique Smith. His father is Eritrean, and Hussle had said that his name means “God will rise.” Hussle said in a 2018 interview with the Dallas radio station KBFB that he had visited Eritrea and met his relatives there in recent years and considered his African heritage an important part of his identity. “As much as I’m a black person from America, I’m a black person from Africa, too,” he said. He said he dropped out of high school after the 10th grade to focus on music. He rapped about his background, and his hope for the future, on “Blue Laces 2”: Third generation, South Central gang banging Had lived long enough to see it changing Think it’s time we make arrangements Finally wiggle out they mazes Find me out in different places But he never entirely left the streets behind, and he said he had never entirely meant to. Hussle was a member of the Rollin’ 60s Crips gang, and in the Dallas radio interview he said: “You don’t get out of a gang, truthfully. You just redirect your energy.” At the time of the interview, he was on a promotional tour after the release of his debut album, the Grammy-nominated “Victory Lap,” that February. The album was his first major-label release after he had spent years as a recognizable mixtape rapper who had not quite broken into the mainstream. He sold one mixtape for $100 to gin up publicity; Jay-Z was reported to have bought 100 copies. While he worked to come up as a rapper, he pursued other ventures that kept him tied to his neighborhood and allowed him to give back to it, like a shared work space and the Marathon Clothing, his store off Crenshaw Boulevard. (He was shot outside it.) Entrepreneurship and self-actualization were a part of his message, along with swagger and braggadocio. “I ain’t in cars going on missions no more, I ain’t in the spot,” he said in 2018. “I’m on a radio run, dropping my album, you know what I mean, building businesses, employing my homeboys, you know what I mean, and paying taxes.” His death prompted widespread mourning in South Los Angeles, as well as calls to address the violent crime that still plagues the community. “I think young people that’s really identified themselves as gang members, when you look at yourself outside of the gang, you don’t really got an identity,” Hussle said, adding that he had decided to focus on music after several of what he described as “wake-up calls.” In addition to his father and mother, his survivors include his partner, Lauren London, an actress and model; their son, Kross; a daughter from a previous relationship, Emani Asghedom; a brother, Semiel; and a sister, Samantha Smith.

5c8a5ec049f0eacbf105d0cc,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/14/arts/music/blueface-thotiana-interview.html,"ENGLEWOOD, Colo. — For Blueface, everything is still new, and a little surprising. A couple of weeks ago, he was paid $20,000 to perform two songs at the opening of a boutique. When he asks women in the crowd at concerts to lift up their shirts, they oblige. Recently, seated in first class on a flight, he ran his phone camera over the sea of other people in cushioned seats, smiled and implored his viewers to “say hello to all my Caucasian friends.” When the 22-year-old rapper born Johnathan Porter posts these happenings on his Instagram story, he often gives the camera a little flat-affect eyebrow-raise, a Jim Halpert out in the hip-hop wilds. The unlikely and wild moments are arriving ever more quickly these days, now that Blueface has catapulted from local Los Angeles rap notoriety to national ubiquity thanks to his single “Thotiana,” which recently reached No. 9 on the Billboard Hot 100. The slow-tempo bacchanal full of nearly whispered boasts was originally released last summer, but has recently exploded: first as a viral sensation with accompanying dances, and lately via a couple of remixes — one, with YG, to bolster its street authority, and a second, with Cardi B, to ease its path into pop ubiquity. By December, when Blueface signed a distribution deal for his first mixtape, “Famous Cryp,” with Entertainment One Records, it was already notching between 5 and 7 million streams a week, according to Nielsen Music. Alan Grunblatt, the label’s president of urban music, said “Thotiana” was poised to be the most successful song he’s worked on since Bone Thugs-n-Harmony’s No. 1, double-platinum “Crossroads.” “Getting to this point probably took about 25 percent music,” Blueface said, verging on unimpressed, at his Denver hotel on a quiet afternoon in between shows in Colorado Springs and Englewood late last month. The rest, he noted laconically: “Marketing, promotion, being yourself.” Unlike most rappers, he openly describes Blueface as a character. “Blueface is probably 10 times Johnathan,” he said. “Every rapper, I don’t give a [expletive] what they tell you, they got two different personalities — they not like that when they at home.” In a genre that’s long been burdened with the expectations of authenticity bumping up against the dictates of entertainment, such candor is refreshing, and utterly reasonable. As rising-star origin stories go, this is rather unromantic, but telling of the times. Blueface is, perhaps above all, a first-rate character actor of the meme era, right down to the tattoo of Benjamin Franklin that creeps from his right ear all the way to the middle of his cheek. If you watch closely, you can see Blueface leaning into the theater of it all. He’s honed a few signature moves that he breaks out at every show: moistening the tips of his pointer finger and pinkie in his mouth, then smoothing out his eyebrows; grabbing a mop and putting it to work during “Bleed It”; pouring water over himself somewhere in between “Freak Bitch” and “Thotiana.” And then there’s the dance — the comically sexual bust down, in which he yanks at the waistband of his pants while studiously gyrating. Always, the look on his face is part rough-edged heartthrob, part can-you-believe-this? What makes Blueface’s ascendance even more intriguing is that his flow is deeply unorthodox. On the skeletal but urgent “Famous Cryp,” his arrangement of words often bears only a passing relationship to the beats he’s rapping over. His syllables can be arrhythmic, and the conclusions of his lines fall over the end, like Wile E. Coyote zooming past the edge of a cliff, legs still pumping. At times, he suggests the embryonic Los Angeles gangster rap of the late 1980s, or even vocal eccentrics like E-40 and Suga Free. But his approach feels novel and raw, not hyperstylized. Debates about rap’s generational crisis — agonizing over younger rappers less concerned with the work of rhyme than their elders — have by now become frequent and tiresome, but Blueface’s music has spawned the unusual circumstance of people actually debating about art, rather than presentation. (“In Defense of Blueface” read one Pitchfork headline.) A YEAR AGO, Blueface had just a few songs up on SoundCloud; now, he’s at the dawn of his mainstream ascendance, meaning that to some, he’s a cause for excitement, and to others, a cause for concern. In Colorado Springs, during a jovial set for a couple hundred enthusiasts, he did the mop thing, the eyebrow thing, the bust down. Some women lifted up their tops, and he filmed them. At the end of the night, he noticed two small children by the foot of the stage, and brought them up. How old were they? Nine and 11, they replied. A mischievous look came over his face and he asked if they’d ever seen a woman’s breast before. They didn’t quite know what to make of the question, and fortunately, no one gave them a quick lesson. The next night, Blueface and his entourage pulled up to the back door of the Gothic Theater in Englewood and were greeted by an agitated security guard, a couple of concerned-looking venue representatives and a baby-faced local police officer. The security guard said he’d received reports of trouble in Colorado Springs, something about underage women exposing their breasts onstage (which had not happened). Blueface was mostly quiet while his bombastic manager, Wack 100, protested, “Was you there to see that?” The game of chicken outside the venue lasted around five minutes; each side threatened to derail the night’s show before eventually relenting. Blueface remained quiet and nonconfrontational, more accommodationist than rabble-rouser. The show went off without a hitch. Blueface has a sleepy, easy charm, and moves with the carriage of the athletic star he was just a few years ago. If it was the early 1990s, he’d already have been cast in a Hughes Brothers or John Singleton film. (For now, how about a three-episode arc on “Ballers”?) When he was a child, his mother, who’d moved to Los Angeles from Ohio to pursue acting, took him around for commercial auditions. “It was fun when I got picked and I was in the commercial and it was like, ‘oh, look at the commercial!’” he said. “But I didn’t enjoy it as a kid.” He stopped auditioning once he began taking football more seriously. He attended several high schools, constantly changing in pursuit of a better sports program. William Coan coached Blueface during his 2014 senior year at Arleta High School, during which the team went 8-4, averaging 40 points a game. Blueface was the starting quarterback, and talented — “Not only could he throw the ball, he could run the ball as well,” Coan said — and also easy to coach: After the team worked out in the weight room, Blueface would blast the gratingly saccharine “Clean Up,” from the Barney children’s series, from his phone. Getting groomed for the spotlight on the field has been a help in music. “You the center of attention,” Blueface said. “Keep your poise, pressure make diamonds.” Blueface moved to North Carolina to give college football a try, and his mother left California as well. When he returned after a short stint that went nowhere, her absence ended up being a boon. “I think if she was in Cali when I was doing my thing, it wouldn’t have worked,” he said. “I would have been in her nest, and she wouldn’t have necessarily agreed with half the [expletive] I was doing. It made Blueface be able to be Blueface 100 percent.” Blueface was his street name — he is a member of the School Yard Crips gang, which dominated the neighborhood he grew up in before it was his rap name. When he returned from college, he became a stay-at-home dad, caring for his son, Jevaughn, while Jevaughn’s mother, Jaidyn, would go off to work. He thought he might become a barber, and ran an Instagram account called the Fade Room, showing off haircuts and fights. But after a chance outing to a studio, he decided to pursue rapping, making a list of steps for music-business success, only some of which had to do with music. “I didn’t know what kind of sound I wanted to make. I didn’t have no influences,” he said. “I just heard my voice in the microphone and was like, damn, I like that.” He posted a handful of songs to SoundCloud, each with a different style. The one that stuck was “Deadlocs,” a casual, boastful talker with a spooky beat from an old friend, Scum Beatz. He set goals for daily play counts, and for when he would shoot a video. Then he started creating viral moments — taking informal polls on Instagram about which high school’s students were following him the most, then driving to that school and performing an impromptu concert atop his car. Rather than goof off to gain followers, he wanted to be sure his face was connected to his song: “Putting it from your ears to your eyes.” IN TODAY’S HIP-HOP ecosystem, distribution and starmaking systems are well-oiled; the fans are there before the artist ever shows up. Memes get disseminated quickly (and mostly discarded quickly too). Snippets of songs are used as soundtracks for selfie or dance videos. The music — the musician — is often merely an accent. That makes social media a necessary evil and a savage tease for upstart musicians of this generation: You have to cultivate a viral-friendly image, but not let it swallow your art. “People be famous for everything other than music and that’s what they really trying to do,” Blueface said. “But they don’t know once you get famous for being this funny guy, nobody’s going to take you serious as a musician.” Still, if it’s virality the kids want, then virality Blueface will give them. Last year, when he wasn’t yet able to Crip walk (a footwork-heavy dance pioneered by Crips), he was mocked online. So he taught himself, filming his progress. However he doesn’t always identify when the winds aren’t going his way, like when he faced backlash for recently referring to a transgender woman as “it.” He shrugged off questions about the matter. As for his living-meme Ben Franklin tattoo, he insists he was sober when he got it, not long after he’d decided to become a rapper, but long before fans had really taken to him. “The people that went with me was like, ‘Nah, don’t do that. Do not do that.’” Blueface said. But he was determined: “This is going to be the never-forget-it,” he told them. No turning back. Eventually, Blueface collected several songs he’d posted on his SoundCloud on “Famous Cryp,” which he initially released independently and has gone as high as No. 29 on the Billboard album chart. He is also signed to Cash Money West, and his new music, including the singles “Bleed It” and “Studio,” will be released via Republic, a division of the Universal Music conglomerate. “I’ve got two labels going full throttle with two singles,” Wack 100 said. Add to that guest appearances on songs by G-Eazy, Tyga and others, creating, he said, “so much traffic.” The suffusion is likely to continue through the spring; Blueface has recorded songs with Drake, the Game, French Montana, Lil Pump, E-40 and others. “‘Thotiana’ has become, like, a worldly song. It’s like ‘Teach Me How to Dougie,’ ‘Chicken Noodle Soup,’” Wack 100 said, referring to transcendent hip-hop one-hit wonders of a decade ago. “What happens is those songs will get so big and the artist will get caught up in the moment of making all the money off that song that then when it drowns out, you come with a song after the fact and because it’s not as big as that, people won’t deal with you. So I’m forced to feed them something different.” In recent months, as Blueface’s career has been thriving, there have been legal setbacks. He was arrested in February on charges of gun possession and last November on charges of assault with a deadly weapon (after he was reportedly the victim of a robbery). Blueface has pleaded not guilty in both cases. In the meanwhile, Johnathan is trying to squeeze all the rewards out of being Blueface. He bought a house in a gated community. When he last saw his mother, he gave her $10,000 in cash. Jaidyn joined him in Colorado — the two have been on and off since high school, and slowly, he’s trying to induct her into his new life. “To understand that you are literally two different people inside of one body, she’s just starting to get it,” he said. “You with Johnathan — you don’t want to be with Blueface.” This month, he’ll be on tour opening for Lil Baby. And this summer, he hopes to release a proper full-length album. But you can almost sense the creeping fatigue. Being Blueface is, right now, almost constant work. “I just want to get paid to lay down, wake up when I want to wake up, go to sleep when I want to go to sleep, and my money just be there,” he said, unapologetically. “I just want to make the most doing the least.” "
5c6708783a125f5075c09f73,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/15/world/asia/rap-video-thailand-liberate-p.html,"BANGKOK — The rhymes came to Nutthapong Srimuong before dawn, when Bangkok is as still as it can be and the night jasmine overpowers the Thai capital with its perfume. The country whose capital is turned into a killing field Whose charter is written and erased by the army’s boots The country that points a gun at your throat Where you must choose to eat the truth or bullets A largely nocturnal individual, Mr. Nutthapong, 30, had worked on a few bars of a rap song, “What My Country Has Got,” for months. Then he abandoned the project. But the rule of Thailand’s military junta had stretched past the four-year mark. Restrictions on free speech showed little sign of abating. Elections, frequently promised, never materialized. In late October, a group of musicians called Rap Against Dictatorship, led by Mr. Nutthapong, released “What My Country’s Got.” Within a week, the music video had collected 20 million views online — in a country of 70 million people with a general aversion to dissent borne of prison sentences meted out to those who oppose the government. “Thais have been taught that politics are disconnected from their lives, but I want people to know they have rights to elections and democracy,” said Mr. Nutthapong, who raps under the name Liberate P, the P standing for “the people.” “I wanted this song to bring out our voices, but I never expected it to have such a big impact,” he added. “It shows that even grass-roots people are tired and want change.” In 2014, a military group, the National Council for Peace and Order, led Thailand’s 12th successful coup since absolute monarchy was abolished in 1932. After repeated delays, Prayuth Chan-ocha, the coup leader and now the country’s prime minister, set elections for March 24, but efforts to kneecap the political opposition have left little hope of free and fair polls. A country best known internationally for its golden beaches and temples has instead made headlines for the junta’s political prohibitions — arresting people for reading George Orwell’s dystopian novel “1984” in public, for example, or flashing the defiant, three-fingered salute from the “Hunger Games” films and books. Hundreds of Thais have been sent to “attitude adjustment” camps. A computer crimes act and a sedition law have been used to imprison activists, human rights groups say. As more and more Thais listened to “What My Country’s Got,” the government responded with its own rap song, “Thailand 4.0.” “There are lots of talented Thais if we work together,” went one lyric that accompanied a video in which a bespectacled girl built a robot. To date, the video has been viewed 4.6 million times, compared with 56 million for “What My Country’s Got.” Mr. Prayuth, who has written several syrupy songs of his own, including “Fight for the Nation,” blasted Rap Against Dictatorship’s harder-edged effort. “Anyone who shows appreciation for the song must accept responsibility for what happens to the country in the future,” he told the local news media. Talk of a criminal investigation ensued, and Mr. Nutthapong worried about arrest. But Mr. Prayuth is running for prime minister in next month’s polls, and detaining the rapper behind a viral video is not a winning campaign strategy. Still, distaste for the song lingers in pro-military circles. On Facebook, Suthep Thaugsuban, a veteran politician who supports the junta, wrote that the rappers “were born Thai, but they express themselves in such a disgusting, abominable way and think to destroy their own homeland.” Mr. Nutthapong puts things differently. “I love Thailand,” he said. “I want a country that I can be proud of.” Mr. Nutthapong grew up in Chanthaburi, a province in eastern Thailand known for its durian, a stinky and spiky fruit. Thai pop, with its bubble-gum sweetness, was not for him. He gravitated instead to American rap. Following in his father’s footsteps, Mr. Nutthapong studied architecture in college in Bangkok. Eleven years later, he’s still not quite done with his thesis. Rap, in all its windowless studio intensity, got in the way of his diploma. Even if his fine-boned features and strategically tousled hair seem more suited for a performer in a boy band, Mr. Nutthapong began dredging up some of Thailand’s darkest history in his rhymes. His audience has followed. In just the past week, a half million more people viewed Rap Against Dictatorship’s video. In one of his earlier rap songs, “Oc(t)ygen,” Mr. Nutthapong mined a turbulent period in the 1970s, when dozens of Thai protesters, many of them college students, were massacred by security forces and right-wing mobs. You have guns and power but you don’t have the right to take away lives Those killings were memorialized in a  Pulitzer Prize-winning photograph from 1976 of a lifeless student dangling from a tree as a man swings at the corpse with a folded chair. This episode, like other bloody crackdowns on dissent over the decades, is missing from Thai schoolbooks. “They want us to forget everything,” Mr. Nutthapong said. In the video for “What My Country’s Got,” shot in black and white, the lynching at Thammasat University in Bangkok is re-enacted, a man heaving a chair at a hanging dummy as a mob cheers him on. Mr. Nutthapong, rage rippling across his face, enters the frame. The country that makes fake promises like loading bullets Creates a regime and orders us to love it  In 2006, after a break of 15 years, the military again left the barracks to topple Thaksin Shinawatra, a brash billionaire who had threatened traditional power bases. Mr. Thaksin is now in self-exile after a corruption-linked conviction but parties aligned with him have prevailed in every election this century. When security forces cleared the streets of protesters loyal to Mr. Thaksin, scores were killed. “It’s the same loop over and over,” Mr. Nutthapong said, of Thailand’s brand of democracy interruptus: elections followed by coups, interspersed with bloodletting on the streets. “The only bargaining power the people have is democracy, but everything looks like it’s in the dark and there’s no way out,” he added. Next month’s election, which is circumscribed by a military-drafted constitution that keeps much of the power in the army’s hands, brings him little hope. “With the upcoming election, it was unfair from the beginning,” he said. “People are in servitude.” But just because younger Thais are disenchanted with the current state of politics doesn’t mean that they will be placated by air-conditioned malls and the latest in selfie technology. “I grew up in a province that is full of fruits and good soil,” Mr. Nutthapong said. “Sweet things are not enough. We need freedom.” Despite threats of detention, college students have led rallies against the junta. A 40-year-old heir to an auto parts business has started his own political party. For millions of others, listening to a rap anthem of dissent is their outlet, even as the junta recently suspended broadcast of a TV station linked to Mr. Thaksin, saying it incited conflict in society and threatened national security. “Do they think we can be shut up forever?” Mr. Nutthapong asked. “Do they have that low an opinion of Thai people?” As Thailand’s political parties restarted their rusty machinery in preparation for an election neither free nor fair, Mr. Nutthapong was working again in the dark hours, recording a new Rap Against Dictatorship song, “Capitalism,” which he described as a meditation on income inequality and human rights.

Nipsey Hussle, born Ermias Joseph Asghedom, was pronounced dead just before 4 p.m. local time, according to the Los Angeles County Coroner. News of the 33-year-old’s death, in a shooting that left two others wounded, prompted an outpouring of support from the Los Angeles community that he championed. “Our hearts are with the loved ones of Nipsey Hussle and everyone touched by this awful tragedy,” Eric Garcetti, the mayor of Los Angeles, said in a tweet. “L.A. is hurt deeply each time a young life is lost to senseless gun violence.” The actress Issa Rae, who also grew up in South Los Angeles, expressed her admiration for the rapper on Twitter. [Update: Man suspected in Nipsey Hussle shooting is charged with murder.] “Watching Nipsey inspired me to invest and own in our communities,” Ms. Rae said. “He was a solid man who loved his woman, his family and his community. This hurts.” Of the two others wounded in the shooting, one was taken to the hospital and is in stable condition while the other suffered only a graze wound, the police said. All three were shot in the parking lot outside The Marathon Clothing, a store that Nipsey Hussle opened in 2017. The authorities had not identified a suspect or motive as of Monday afternoon. A Los Angeles fixture since the mid-2000s, Nipsey Hussle first drew widespread acclaim in hip-hop for his three-part mixtape series, “Bullets Ain’t Got No Name.” His stage name is a twist on the comedian Nipsey Russell. “Victory Lap,” his debut album, was nominated this year for best rap album at the Grammy Awards, losing to Cardi B’s “Invasion of Privacy.” “My whole energy is just at a low right now hearing this,” the rapper Drake, who collaborated with Nipsey Hussle, wrote on Instagram. “You were a real one to your people and to the rest of us. I’m only doing this here cause I want the world to know I saw you as a man of respect and a don. Rest easy my g.” Rihanna also mourned the rapper’s death on Instagram, posting photos of him with his daughter at the Grammy’s in February. “This doesn’t make any sense! My spirit is shaken by this,” she said. Nipsey Hussle had collaborated with artists including Snoop Dogg and YG, drawing from his city’s tradition of gangster rap and intricate street-level storytelling. In 2013, he created industry buzz by creating only 1,000 physical copies of his mixtape “Crenshaw,” an independent release that sold for $100 at a pop-up shop and was freely available online. He said Jay-Z bought 100 copies. “Nipsey was not only one of the greatest artists we worked with but an amazing father and leader in his community,” Nipsey Hussle’s label, Atlantic Records, said in a statement. “One of the kindest and brightest stars in the universe, he was inspiring to all.” By Monday morning, hundreds of mourners had gathered to pay their respects outside the store. Some fans prayed and cried while others laid down candles, flowers and signs to express their condolences. A steady flow of passing cars played tracks from Nipsey Hussle’s latest album. The rapper was a strong advocate for the South Los Angeles community where he was raised. In his teens, Nipsey Hussle dropped out of high school and became involved in street life as he tried to make a career in music. He identified as a member of the Rollin 60’s Crips gang, which he chalked up to history, circumstance and survival. “I’m not promoting it. I’m just speaking on it,” he said in a 2010 interview with Complex. “I’m more focused on giving solutions and inspiration more than anything.” Despite that affiliation, the rapper spoke out about gun violence and had plans to meet on Monday afternoon with representatives from Jay-Z’s Roc Nation and officials from the Los Angeles Police Department to talk about preventing gang violence, according to Steve Soboroff, the Los Angeles police commissioner. He was also an outspoken representative of the Crenshaw neighborhood and helped to promote the community’s art and culture. “From the beginning, Nipsey Hussle has been a critical part of #DestinationCrenshaw, even inspiring the name!” Marqueece Harris-Dawson, a city councilman who represents South Los Angeles, said on Instagram. “Destination Crenshaw” is a community project designed to promote black cultural history in South Los Angeles. Last year, Nipsey Hussle, who taught himself how to build computers, helped to launch a center in the Crenshaw district dedicated to connecting underrepresented groups with technology companies. “Growing up as a kid, I was looking for somebody — not to give me anything — but somebody that cared,” he told The Los Angeles Times. “Someone that was creating the potential for change and that had an agenda outside of their own self interests.” Nipsey Hussle was in a relationship with the actress and model Lauren London, with whom he had a son, Kross. He also had a daughter, Emani, from a previous relationship. Mark Ridley-Thomas, a Los Angeles County supervisor who represents South Los Angeles, said Nipsey Hussle “was a father, businessman, entertainer, and inspiration to many.” “We mourn his sudden and tragic passing and send his family our deepest condolences,” he said.

The track briefly appeared on the Billboard Top Country Songs chart before being removed after it was deemed insufficiently country. (On Friday, Billy Ray Cyrus joined the track on a remix.) The lines are blurry, but this is far from the first time country music and hip-hop have been in dialogue. They’ve been dancing around each other, and sometimes with each other, for more than two decades, whether in the form of deeply Southern rap music, bluegrass-inflected hip-hop, country singers collaborating with rappers or, in some cases, those singers rapping themselves.

5caf67c049f0eacbf1f82d6f,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/us/nipsey-hussle-funeral.html,"LOS ANGELES — The coffin, adorned with white and violet flowers, sat center stage. Three large photographs of the slain rapper were projected overhead on giant television panels, rendered in hues of pink and blue. A thick wall of flowers, a piano, and a harp on stage softened the atmosphere of the cavernous sports arena. Choking back tears as they danced, family, fans and hip-hop luminaries gathered on Thursday in Los Angeles to honor Nipsey Hussle, the rapper who was gunned down in South Los Angeles last month. The bittersweet memorial to a local hero melded deeply emotional tributes with arena-filling musical interludes from his debut album. “This is a celebration. The marathon continues,” shouted DJ Battlecat over the loudspeaker before the beginning of the service at Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles, which included Hussle’s family along with prominent figures like Stevie Wonder, Snoop Dogg and YG.  Before the service began, Hussle’s voice boomed from the speakers and thousands of fans sprung to their feet to sing along, the bass shaking the ground, giving the event the feel of a concert. The outpouring reflected the depth of admiration for Hussle, who incorporated his upbringing and experience as a gang member into his music, which spoke powerfully to many who live in the city’s poorest neighborhoods and well beyond. As his musical success propelled him in recent years, Hussle funneled investments to the South Los Angeles streets on which he had grown up, earning devotion from fans, neighbors and local leaders.  Hussle’s Marathon Clothing store became a potent symbol of black entrepreneurship and was transformed into a makeshift memorial last month after Hussle was gunned down outside its doors over a “personal dispute,” according to the Los Angeles Police Department.  The majority of mourners at the event were African-American and Latino, largely in their 20s and 30s, many wearing the famous “Crenshaw” shirts that were sold in Hussle’s store. Members of the Eritrean community wore traditional clothing, some adorned with national flags.  As the service drew to a close, a D.J. played several songs from Hussle’s album, including “Hussle & Motivate.” Attendees danced and sang along, some chanting Hussle’s name as they left the arena toward the procession, which ran through Watts, Inglewood and South Los Angeles. Here are more highlights from the day. Before performing at the funeral, the musician Stevie Wonder called for stronger gun regulations. People nodded along in the audience as he spoke. “It is a heartbreak to again lose a member of our family. It is a heartbreak because it’s so unnecessary,” he said. “It is so painful to know that we don’t have enough people taking a position that says: Listen, we must have stronger gun laws.” “It is unacceptable,” he added, in what was the most overtly political speech during the memorial. “It is almost like the world is becoming blind. I pray that we will grow and that the leaders who have responsibility to perpetuate life will do it by making sure that the laws will make it very hard for people to have guns and take their frustrations out to kill life.” After his remarks he performed the song “Tears in Heaven.” In a tribute, Snoop Dogg said that he and Hussle were drawn to each other like magnets. He said that other up-and-coming artists often promise that “I’ll make you a million dollars.” Not Hussle; he knew his talent was about more than money: “He was a visionary.” “Nipsey’s line was, ‘Hey homey, listen to my music, just give it a listen,’” Snoop Dogg recounted. “I didn’t grow up with Nip, in the neighborhood, but I watched him grow up in front of me.” He praised Hussle for the unifying role he played in a culture sometimes marred by gang violence. “We’re going to respect another man from another neighborhood when he comes from where we come from,” Snoop Dogg said. “You are a peace advocate, Nip. That’s what you are.” The service all but stopped the hip-hop world on Thursday. While some West Coast rappers took the stage to speak about Hussle’s life and enduring message, others sent their own emotional condolences. Jay-Z, whose company Roc Nation managed Hussle in recent years, wrote in a statement printed for the funeralgoers: “You were a curious soul who was evolving at a speed that was truly inspiring. The seeds you have planted are already bearing fruit.” Kendrick Lamar, another local Los Angeles hero, in his own letter recalled touring with Hussle in 2009. “Casually I would go out to the crowd and listen to the substance he spewed on stage. Thinking to myself, this is the type of talent I want to be a part of,” he wrote. “I watched a young, ambitious black male orchestrate fellowship amongst the men around him on that tour.” And Drake, who was set to perform in London on Thursday, posted a photo of himself watching the service to Instagram. “Sent off like a king and rightfully so,” he said. “Sending our love from across the world.” Before entering Staples Center, many fans stopped to take pictures in front of a black armored truck that Hussle owned. The “all money in” truck was used for promotions and became a fixture outside his clothing store. The truck was treated like a piece of public art, positioned in the middle of a closed-off street, surrounded by fencing and plainclothes security guards.  Kathleen Gonzalez, 20, said that what she remembered most about Hussle was how he treated everyone — “a homeless man, an average man, a man without papers who was here illegally.”  “He gave everyone the same praise he received,” added Ms. Gonzalez, a therapist who works with special needs children in South Los Angeles. “Nowadays it’s really rare to see that.” Even as the city came together on Thursday to mourn Hussle, she said her community was on edge over the threat of more violence.  “Being from that part of the city, it’s something you keep in mind,” she said. “Nipsey wouldn’t want that.”  Some mourners came from far away. Ron Solomon flew in from Atlanta on Wednesday night and went straight to Hussle’s shop in Crenshaw. “Everything he lived is what I believe in, too,” he said. “Uplifting his people. Not letting the system beat us.” The N.B.A. all-star James Harden, of the Houston Rockets, and DeMar DeRozan of the San Antonio Spurs also came to mourn Hussle. They wore white to honor their friend and fellow South Los Angeles native and entered with somber faces, not speaking to anyone. President Barack Obama sent a letter praising Hussle, which Karen Civil, a hip-hop media personality, read at the service. Mr. Obama said that he had heard Hussle’s music through his daughters.  “While most people look at the Crenshaw neighborhood where he grew up and see only gangs, bullets and despair, Nipsey saw potential,” the former president wrote. “He saw hope. He saw a community that even through its flaws taught him to always keep going.”  Angelique Smith, Hussle’s mother, stood up to the microphone dressed entirely in white, with a tulle veil covering part of her face. She spoke at length of her own spiritual beliefs, calling on Hussle’s ancestors to “lead him on his journey.”  “I have perfect peace,” she said. “I am happy, I am complete. I am strong, and if I can feel this way, so can you.” With the help of Hussle’s father, Dawit Asghedom, who was at her side, Ms. Smith named several ancestors by name and led mourners in a call and response.  She spoke of a deep spiritual connection to her son, using his given name of Ermias. “He’s intelligent. He’s radiant. He’s a superhero,” she said. Lauren London, Hussle’s longtime partner and mother of his 2-year-old son, also took the microphone in a white dress. She quoted what Hussle had often told her: “The game is gonna test you. Never fold. Stay 10 toes down. It’s not on you, it’s in you, and what’s in you they can’t take away.” By midafternoon, hundreds of people had gathered in the streets along Crenshaw and Slauson, outside the clothing shop where Hussle was killed. The funeral procession snaked 25 miles through South Los Angeles, a last lap through the neighborhood where he grew up and is beloved.  Todd Lavergne, who grew up in the neighborhood and does equine therapy for children throughout the city, sat on his horse at the intersection. Mr. Lavergne, 45, said he wasn’t even a fan of Hussle’s music: “I’m an elder.” But he still came to pay homage, underscoring Hussle’s reach. “He represented the community and wanted to help the community,” he said. “To give them something to do, to keep their minds busy.” Even the manner in which Hussle was killed was seen by some as a final message to the community, to keep up the push for peace that Hussle had worked so hard for. Darlene Young, who has a soul food catering business and was driving for Uber in South Los Angeles on Thursday, said that God had, “brought him home in a way to show the violence in the streets.” She continued, “if you read the Bible, you have a time to live and at time to die.” Reporting was contributed by Walter Thompson-Hernández in Los Angeles and Joe Coscarelli and Niraj Chokshi in New York.

5ca67ad649f0eacbf1f80ff8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/04/arts/music/nipsey-hussle-shooting-death.html,"Though far from a struggling musician, Nipsey Hussle, the Los Angeles rapper who was shot and killed on Sunday, was not living the luxury fantasy of hip-hop superstardom. He often traveled without security. He did not anchor his image to brick-size piles of money and fleets of foreign cars, opting rather for a few thick gold chains with a flannel or a hoodie. Instead of multi-million-dollar brand deals, high fashion collaborations and appearances on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show,” Hussle partnered with a developer to buy a local strip mall and helped with the opening of a co-working space and a Fatburger. “Nipsey’s there kissing babies, taking selfies,” recalled Mark Webster, who worked with Hussle on branding for the burger joint. Most casual listeners are familiar with hip-hop’s 1 percent — Jay-Z, Drake, Cardi B. But Hussle represented a less visible, less glamorous, but increasingly ascendant hip-hop archetype: the regional legend, a member of rap’s middle class who can do well without ever reaching mainstream mega-fame. With the rise of streaming and the 24/7 personalized reality show of social media, it’s a boom time for this in-between tier of artists. Even outside hip-hop strongholds like New York, Atlanta, Chicago and Los Angeles, rappers from cities like Charlotte, N.C.; Baton Rouge, La.; and Pompano Beach, Fla., have been able to develop and sustain national fan bases. Many like Hussle earn a healthy living, if not ultra-wealth, without broad radio play or platinum plaques. And in the tradition of the pre-internet hometown heroes that came before them, many stay close to home for a combination of financial and personal reasons. But that same accessibility and dedication to their communities can also make them reachable targets, a harsh reality that has resonated in the hip-hop world this week. The police said Hussle, 33, was killed in front of his South Los Angeles clothing store by someone he knew, likely because of a neighborhood dispute. On Thursday, prosecutors charged Eric R. Holder Jr., 29, with Hussle’s murder. “Everything about Nipsey was Crenshaw and Slauson,” the Game, a friend and Los Angeles rapper who collaborated with Hussle, said in an interview. “Those are the two streets that ended up taking his life.” Hussle, whose given name was Ermias Asghedom, has been mourned by major artists, athletes, actors and politicians who remembered his entrepreneurship and philanthropy. But the biggest outpouring of grief was in Crenshaw, where the rapper was still “just a regular dude from L.A.,” the Game said. Najee Ali, an activist in South Los Angeles who knew Hussle, said: “He walked in the community every day. People could walk up and touch him.” A product of the CD mixtape era, Hussle, a classic West Coast stylist reminiscent of ’90s gangster rap, would pass out his music by hand or sell it from the trunk of his car before things went truly digital. But as hip-hop transitioned to free music online and eventually to YouTube and streaming services, regional artists of Hussle’s caliber suddenly had access to broader audiences for little cost. At Spotify and Apple Music, hip-hop revealed itself to be the most in-demand genre, and niche rappers like Hussle found greater opportunities. For artists like Hussle — or his southern peers Kevin Gates, Yo Gotti and Young Dolph, among countless others — concerts might take place in nightclubs instead of stadiums, and without sophisticated celebrity infrastructure, they try to capitalize on viral moments and guerrilla marketing. Nearly 15 years into his career, Hussle appeared to be on the cusp of crossover stardom. He had a GQ spread, and with management from Jay-Z’s Roc Nation, he released his first official studio album, “Victory Lap,” on Atlantic Records, a major label, last year. It was a modest success, debuting at No. 4 on the Billboard chart and earning a Grammy nomination, though his numbers still paled in comparison to rap stars like Drake or J. Cole, who regularly top 100 million Spotify plays on a track. Hussle, who never had a breakout hit, was earning about a tenth of that, though his reputation was outpacing his commercial impact. But rather than use his success as a one-way ticket to the gated communities of Calabasas, he rarely strayed from the blocks where he came up as a member of the Rollin’ 60s Crips gang. Wack 100, a prominent rap manager and a self-described Piru Blood from Los Angeles, noted that despite Hussle’s background, his killing did not conjure the East Coast vs. West Coast war of 1990s gangster rap, which saw the shooting deaths of the Notorious B.I.G. and Tupac Shakur. “It wasn’t an outsider that came over here and did that” to Hussle, he said. Bloods and Crips frequently work together in music, and violence in hip-hop rarely stems from those affiliations these days, Wack said. He credited that to the formation more than a decade ago of a council of elders — regional gang leaders who were involved in rap and wanted to prevent bloodshed that could undermine big business, while also uniting communities. “We knew we made mistakes and we were part of the problem of laying the foundation of the negativity,” he said. Hussle had reinvested his earnings back into Crenshaw, maintaining street-level ties even as his star grew. And like many in his situation, Hussle’s comfort in the neighborhood that treated him like a king resulted in a casual presence. When he was shot on Sunday afternoon in front of his Marathon Clothing store, Hussle was with only two friends, and taking photos with fans. “Sometimes keeping it real is too much,” Wack said. “When you’re that accessible, that common, then it becomes easy to get to you and easy to plot on you.” For other rappers who looked to Hussle’s career as a blueprint, his killing has resulted in increased paranoia and anxiety. Mozzy, a Sacramento rapper who frequently wrestles with the consequences of his gang ties in music and interviews, said that Hussle “was supposed to be untouchable,” and represented the aspirational “big dog” in his lane “as far as being a gangster rapper and trying to transition into being a mogul and a role model.” “I ain’t going to lie, I’m kind of shaking right now,” Mozzy said, having recently had a “mini-altercation” in his own neighborhood. He cited the fatalistic advice of the Louisiana rap veteran Boosie: “Most rappers die in their own city,” and added: “Every day you’re taking one of the biggest risks of your life by being a rapper and living in your community, or continuing to pull up there. But you take that risk out of a love for the people.” Charlamagne Tha God, the author and rap radio host for Power 105 in New York, said that Hussle’s death would “absolutely affect the way people move through their hood” in the future. “It makes you constantly question yourself and say, ‘Should I give back and go back, or should I give back and not go back?’ And how much going back is too much?” Charlamagne said. The Game, a native of Compton who remains a presence there, described the constant nagging feeling that the place with the most love for you could also be the place with the most festering hate. He said that less than 24 hours before Hussle was shot, the two spoke about “how to move, and dip in and dip out” of the neighborhood to stay safe. “I know, I know,” he recalled Hussle telling him, “I just gotta get this right for my people.” "
5c89321c49f0eacbf105cdb0,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/13/arts/music/french-british-hip-hop-afrobeats-afrotrap.html,"LONDON — Britain can be an insular place. A parlor game here involves trying to list as many famous Belgians as possible, on the basis that few people know any. An equivalent exercise with French rappers would be even tougher. France is one of the world’s largest rap music markets, but its neighbor on the other side of the English Channel pays little attention. The lack of interest is reciprocated. French rap is full of borrowed English words: The F-bomb is often detonated in lyrics, especially in “le rap hard-core.” But the prevailing influence is American; British rappers struggle to command attention. Stormzy, probably Britain’s highest-profile M.C., topped the British charts when he released his debut album in 2017. In France, he did not even make the top 200. Can the differences between these opposing citadels of European rap be bridged? The answer lies not just in Britain and France, but also in Europe’s former colonies in Africa. West and Central Africa contain numerous English- and French-speaking nations that reflect the presence of Britain, France and Belgium as colonial powers until the 1960s. Imported styles of pop music from sub-Saharan Africa have been adopted and transformed by British and French musicians who have roots there. Omo Frenchie is a London-based rapper who toggles between English and French in his songs. “Rapping in French is a lot harder,” he said in a telephone interview. “It’s the language and the pronunciation. In French, they’ll go the long way around saying even simple things. But the good thing is that when you do find a nice line, it sounds amazing.” Frenchie, who would not give his real name or age, is actually a trilingual performer. He also uses Lingala, one of the languages of the Democratic Republic of Congo, a country that emerged from Belgian colonial rule in 1960. Frenchie was born there but moved to London with his family as a baby. The first time he used French and Lingala in a song was in 2013. The occasion was a guest appearance on a track by the musician Afro B, another Londoner with a Francophone African background. After it came out, Frenchie noticed a surge of interest on Twitter, with people asking: Who’s this guy that’s speaking French? “From then on, I knew that that was my niche,” Frenchie said. He is not alone. Yxng Bane (pronounced Young Bane) is an up-and-coming rapper from London with a clutch of British chart hits under his belt. Like Frenchie, he has Congolese ancestry. The 22-year-old, real name Larry Kiala, grew up speaking English and French at home, before later learning Lingala. Last year, he teamed up with a French rapper called Franglish for the song “Makasi,” which was recorded in Paris. His linkup with Franglish — a hybrid name to strike fear in the hearts of the Académie Française, the zealous gatekeepers of the French language — was forged through their shared African heritage. The French rapper also has a Congolese family background (“makasi” is the Lingala word for “strong”). Their collaboration illustrates the growing influence of African music on British and French rap. The shift is partly driven by demographic change. The proportion of Britons from a black African background doubled between 2001 and 2011, when the last national census took place. (France does not record the ethnicity of its citizens.) The strong influence of African music on British rap derives from the popularity of Afrobeats, a blend of West African, Caribbean and American urban music, which originated in the 2000s in Nigeria and Ghana, former British colonies. It crossed over into British urban music in the early 2010s. The first Afrobeats hit in Britain’s top 10 came in 2012 with D’Banj’s “Oliver Twist.” (The song’s video featured Kanye West, who signed D’Banj to his record label.) Since then, numerous variants have sprung up, a dizzying profusion of subgenres with names like Afroswing and Afrobashment. The proliferation is partly a fad. “I feel like if you’re going to put the word Afro in it, there has to be that African element,” Omo Frenchie said. “A lot of it is watered down,” he added. “It deserves a little bit more.” But the overall hybrid style, moving easily between Chicago drill, Drake’s sing-rapping, Caribbean dance hall and West African urban pop, is more than a trend. It has taken root in the mainstream as a newly dominant mode of urban music in Britain. Its geographically profuse sound is epitomized by a rising star of British rap, Octavian, who was born in France to African parents before moving to London as a child. The equivalent genre across the Channel is Afrotrap. It was pioneered by MHD, a musician from Paris who is one of the best-known rappers in France. He created Afrotrap in 2015 when he posted a video of himself on social media freestyling a rap over a song by the Nigerian Afrobeats band P-Square. Last year, he became the first French rapper to play the Coachella festival in California. But MHD’s career hangs in the balance. In January, he was arrested on charges relating to a man’s violent death in Paris. MHD denies any involvement. Nonetheless, the genre that he created has become embedded in French hip-hop. The rapper Niska drew on Afrotrap in his album “Commando,” the No. 3 most-streamed album in France in 2017. In an email exchange before his arrest in December, MHD, 24, whose real name is Mohamed Sylla, said that his ambition was “to export my music to an international audience.” “In France, this kind of mixture was new,” he said, referring to Afrotrap. He felt an affinity, he added, with his British peers: “The English have this ability to mix things up and fuse genres. They are lucky to have a public that is hyper-open to these blended sounds.” Afrotrap draws on Coupé-Décalé, a dance music style from the Ivory Coast. It is harder and faster than the British Afrobeats and its offshoots. “The African music sound in France is different,” Frenchie said. “No one in the U.K. has jumped on a beat like that. It’s predominantly an African sequence.” But there are areas of overlap as well as divergence. MHD has bolstered his profile in English-speaking markets by collaborating with Afrobeats singers such as the Nigerian star Wizkid. Last year, he played shows in London. Niska followed in his footsteps in February. Traffic across the English Channel is building in volume. “I feel like there’s a big wave with the Afrotrap music coming from France,” Yxng Bane said. “I feel that it’s getting highly recognized.” And his own efforts at an Anglo-French rapprochement in rap will continue, he added. “Just keep your eyes open,” Yxng Bane said. “Got some more Francophone for them. It’s coming, it’s coming.” "

Cox, said in a statement. Mr. Abraham-Joseph is an “unlawfully present United Kingdom national” who legally entered the United States in 2005 but was supposed to leave the next year, according to the terms of his nonimmigrant visa, Mr. Cox said. [Is 21 Savage American? Our music critic weighs in.] In addition to being in the country unlawfully after 2006, Mr. Abraham-Joseph was convicted of felony drug charges in 2014 in Fulton County, Ga., the statement said. Mr. Abraham-Joseph faces deportation proceedings and was expected to appear before a federal immigration judge. “We are working diligently to get Mr. Abraham-Joseph out of detention while we work with the authorities to clear up any misunderstandings,” Dina LaPolt, Mr. Abraham-Joseph’s lawyer, said in a statement on Sunday night. In a statement on Monday, representatives of Mr. Abraham-Joseph said that he “has never hid his immigration status from the US government.” “As a minor, his family overstayed their work visas,” the statement said, and Mr. Abraham-Joseph “was left without legal status through no fault of his own.” His arrest came after he performed at the Super Bowl Music Fest at the State Farm Arena on Thursday. Mr. Abraham-Joseph has been nominated for a Grammy for Record of the Year for “Rockstar,” a song with the rapper Post Malone. Mr. Abraham-Joseph’s album “I Am > I Was” opened at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in January. He is known for his flat delivery and subdued rap style. Mr. Abraham-Joseph has long maintained that he was from Atlanta. In August, he gave backpacks and games to children in Atlanta during an annual drive called Issa Back 2 School Drive. “Mr. Abraham-Joseph is a role model to the young people in this country, especially in Atlanta,” Ms. LaPolt said. She added that Mr. Abraham-Joseph was “actively working in the community leading programs to help underprivileged youths in financial literacy.” In a 2016 interview with VladTV, an urban news YouTube channel, Mr. Abraham-Joseph was asked where he grew up and he listed all the neighborhoods in Atlanta he had previously lived in. “I grew up on the East Side, Glenwood, Decatur,” Mr. Abraham-Joseph says. “I done grew up in all Atlanta really, everybody know me. If you don’t, you ain’t from this city.” "

Detectives confirmed the suspect, Eric Holder, 29, was in custody. Nipsey Hussle was fatally shot on Sunday outside a store he co-owned in South Los Angeles. His death was met with grief and outrage by residents in the Crenshaw neighborhood where he grew up and by people across the music industry. According to video evidence cited by the police, Mr. Holder reportedly walked up to the rapper and two other men who were with him several times before leaving and returning armed with a handgun. He fired several times before fleeing the scene in a white Chevy Cruze that was driven by an unidentified woman. [Update: Man suspected in Nipsey Hussle shooting is charged with murder.] “In this case as in every case, it’s the community’s involvement that makes us safer,” said the Los Angeles police chief, Michel Moore, at a news conference on Tuesday. Mr. Holder was arrested in Bellflower, Calif., shortly after 1 p.m. on Tuesday after a member of the public called the police. Los Angeles sheriff’s deputies detained Mr. Holder and he was then taken into L.A.P.D. custody. Mr. Moore did not reveal much information about the motive for the shooting Tuesday, but noted that Nipsey Hussle and Mr. Holder appeared engaged in a personal dispute. Asked if the shooting was related to gang activity, Mr. Moore demurred, stating the motive was “not, to our information, anything related to rivalries between gangs.” Mr. Moore also said that a stampede at a vigil for the rapper on Monday night, in which more than a dozen people were injured, was the result of a panic stemming from a struggle over a handgun that was pulled out, but not fired. On Tuesday, in an effort to contain potential violence amid intense interest and heightened tensions, police officers cordoned off access to the memorial outside the store. Throughout the day, fans continued dropping off flowers. Nipsey Hussle, born Ermias Joseph Asghedom, was remembered by city officials on Tuesday as a gifted artist and passionate advocate for the South Los Angeles community in which he was raised. “He was working closely with the city to help save lives and transform lives, even as he was doing that for himself,” Mayor Eric Garcetti said at the news conference. “He was a tireless advocate for the young people of this city and of this world, to lift them up with the possibility of not being imprisoned by where you come from or past mistakes.” The rapper was scheduled to meet on Monday afternoon with representatives from Roc Nation, Jay-Z’s entertainment company, and police officials to discuss how the community could support efforts to stop gang violence and help children in the area. His death was felt particularly deeply in Crenshaw, the neighborhood he grew up in and rapped about and where he maintained a regular presence. His fans said he offered hope, advocated self-improvement and financially invested in the community, which has long struggled with violent crime. He opened a co-working space dedicated to increasing diversity in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, and helped to promote black arts and culture. His debut studio album, “Victory Lap,” was nominated for best rap album at the Grammys last year and debuted at No. 4 on the Billboard chart. He was in a relationship with the actress and model Lauren London and had two children, Kross and Emani. “I am completely lost,” Ms. London said on Instagram on Tuesday. “I’ve lost my best friend.” Mourners have transformed The Marathon Clothing store into a makeshift memorial for the star. He was a regular presence at the store, long after he became famous, and it became a potent symbol for his commitment to redeveloping Crenshaw. "
5caf8a8249f0eacbf1f82ff8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/arts/music/lil-nas-x-old-town-road-country-rap.html,"Over the last few weeks, “Old Town Road” — a strutting and lightheartedly comedic country-rap tune by the previously unknown 20-year-old rapper Lil Nas X — has lived an improbable number of lives. It began as a Hail Mary pass by a college dropout hoping music might save him from having to go back to school. But in the way that the internet can rapidly make and remake something, morphing meaning in real time, Lil Nas X’s track became something different almost every few days on its path from SoundCloud obscurity to pop ubiquity: a savvy troll, a manipulator of streaming algorithms, a meme theme, a battering ram to genre barriers, a trigger of music-biz discord, a David suffering at the hands of Goliath, a sociocultural rallying point, and eventually, a site of cross-cultural kumbaya. [Listen to a history of country-rap in 29 songs.] And now, it’s likely to be one of the most emblematic songs of the year: On April 8, “Old Town Road” became the No. 1 song in the country, capping a startling ascent that demonstrates what can happen when viral engineering meets lightning-rod controversy meets the pop uncanny. For its first 25 seconds, “Old Town Road” could be any other rural lament, a lonely howl delivered over a plucked ukulele. It’s only when the trap drums kick in and the vocals change from singing to quasi-ironic rapping that the song’s true intentions come to the fore. It’s a genre-hybrid exercise — a hip-hop song with country-themed subject matter, partly rapped and partly sung in an exaggerated honky-tonk accent — and also a comedy sketch. The way Lil Nas X overaccentuates his vowels and makes them wobble is a caricature of stoic drawl, and when he raps “cowboy hat from Gucci, Wrangler on my booty,” it’s both confident boast and funny fantasy. It’s also a neat distillation of how genre is currently lived in American pop music: fluidly, with styles and ideas up for grabs by creators and easily slipped on and off by listeners, with varying degrees of sincerity. Pop, more than ever, is an identity playground. [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] But the particular alchemy of “Old Town Road” also taps something deeper: more than two decades of dialogue between country music and hip-hop, genres that have been slowly but consistently finding common heritage, swapping structural elements and taking comfort in each other’s sounds. But the industry’s gatekeepers are less interested in this mutability. For decades, Nashville has essentially framed and marketed the rural experience as white — despite and in defiance of the deep black roots of country music. So when an artist like Lil Nas X — who is black, and raps, and is from Atlanta, with no ties to the country music business — lays claim to rural aesthetics, even in a way that’s partly tongue in cheek, it causes real disruption. In late March, “Old Town Road” appeared on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart before it was removed for being deemed insufficiently country, causing a furor. But resistance led to embrace: a remix of the song featuring Billy Ray Cyrus, which in turn has been played by some country radio stations, which helped the song land on Billboard’s Country Airplay chart. “Old Town Road” — the original or the remix — is by no means the first country-rap crossover. There have been collaborations across genre lines, like Nelly and Tim McGraw’s “Over and Over”; songs in which country singers rap, like Jason Aldean’s “Dirt Road Anthem” and Blake Shelton’s “Boys ’Round Here”; and performances that are fully genre flexible, like Sam Hunt’s “Take Your Time.” And hip-hop has flirted with country signifiers on and off since the 1980s, whether it was the fringe-outfitted rapper Cowboy from the Furious Five, or Kool Moe Dee’s — and later, Will Smith’s — excursion to the “Wild Wild West.” By the 1990s, Southern rap was flourishing, providing a platform for ideas, accents and sounds that weren’t part of hip-hop from the coasts. Crooked Lettaz from Mississippi, 8Ball & MJG from Tennessee, UGK from Texas and many more emphasized drawling flows and production that leaned toward Southern soul and sometimes blues. Around the turn of the century, a pair of young white rappers, Bubba Sparxxx and Colt Ford, were beginning to work with Shannon Houchins, a producer in the Atlanta rap innovator Jermaine Dupri’s camp. Houchins would go on to produce most of “Dark Days, Bright Nights,” Sparxxx’s independent debut album, which got him signed to the major label Interscope and partnered with the producer Timbaland, who steered country-rap to its first big breakthrough moment: Sparxxx’s single “Ugly,” a hip-hop and pop hit with a video that included a pig sty and a tractor race, and went to No. 15 on the Billboard Hot 100. Sparxxx’s follow-up album, “Deliverance,” was a stunning and elegant cross-genre statement radically unlike anything that had preceded it. It made less of a broad impact, but in the wake of Sparxxx’s innovations came a wave of artists who effectively identified as country rappers focused on rural storytelling and signifiers — growing up far from cities, partying at mud bogs and so on. The seeds were also planted for what was to be Nashville’s first extended flirtation with hip-hop. Kid Rock, an early white rapper, remade himself as a country-rock rapper-singer. Tim McGraw partnered with Nelly on “Over and Over,” a road ballad that went to No. 3 on the Hot 100 in 2004. Kenny Rogers collaborated with both Wyclef Jean and Coolio. Even Willie Nelson appeared on a hip-hop song. And in Nashville, the MuzikMafia emerged, a polyglot group of performers that included the singing duo Big & Rich and the rapper Cowboy Troy, who collaborated on several songs, including the single “I Play Chicken With the Train,” which in 2005 became the first country-rap song to land on the Billboard Country Songs chart. These were outliers, or novelties — brief successes that Nashville tolerated but didn’t wholeheartedly embrace. But at around the same time, Houchins teamed up with Ford to form Average Joes Entertainment, a record label devoted to the intersection of country and rap centered on white rural experiences, with a growing stable of burly gool-ol’-boy rappers — “hick-hop,” it was occasionally called — operating largely outside the country music mainstream, though Ford regularly collaborated with the genre’s stars. [A godfather of country-rap on his 2000s hits and Lil Nas X.] By the early 2010s, Nashville was in search of raw energy. The music became more rural, rougher at the edges and more willing to flaunt a range of influences. These younger singers — Jason Aldean, Luke Bryan — often made it plain that hip-hop was as much of their musical heritage as country or Southern rock. That lineage was cemented when, in 2010, Aldean covered “Dirt Road Anthem,” a song originally recorded by Ford and Brantley Gilbert; his version went to No 1. on the country chart and No. 7 on the Hot 100. It opened the floodgates — Blake Shelton rapped a little, Bryan danced to hip-hop songs onstage, the duo Florida Georgia Line built a career on importing just the faintest hint of hip-hop percussion and slang. Their song “Cruise” became one of the biggest hits of 2013, bolstered by a remix featuring, who else, Nelly. That there’s a splash of hip-hop coursing through country (its male performers, at least) is now fundamentally accepted, but always with the country performer — and the country music business — in control of just how much. Nothing, though, is immune from the force and urgency of the meme economy, and Lil Nas X has demonstrated himself to be a master of how to pachinko his way from the margins to the mainstream. “Old Town Road” began on SoundCloud, where he tagged it as country to avoid competing with the hip-hop heavyweights that dominate the platform. Once it began to get noticed, he pushed it heavily on TikTok, the short-performance-clip app, where it was the soundtrack to thousands of videos. The track also arrived at a fortuitous moment — on the heels of a trickle of Western aesthetics into the high-style universe over the last couple of years, and also following the success of stylistically diverse country performers like Kacey Musgraves, who have demonstrated that a country musician can be a beacon of cool far outside the genre’s walls. Even Kanye West recently took to the countryside, unveiling his last album at a Wyoming cowboy ranch. In another moment, the aesthetic choices of “Old Town Road” might have been perceived as pure kitsch, but now they are kitsch with a side of tastemaker. And though the removal of the song from the country chart reflected an initial resentment, the mood soon switched. Some country singers said they found “Old Town Road” to be country, or country enough. They didn’t want to be on the wrong side of cool. Billy Ray Cyrus, who joined the song’s remix, is not a country insider at the peak of his powers, but he’s still a performer with a great deal of resonance within Nashville thanks to his 1992 pop-country crossover smash “Achy Breaky Heart.” Cyrus’s “Old Town Road” verse is pure glitz, a blend of hip-hop braggadocio and country-boy-in-the-big-city awe: “Spent a lot of money on my brand-new guitar/Baby’s got a habit, diamond rings and Fendi sports bras/Ridin’ down Rodeo in my Maserati sports car.” The performance is effortless, showing a version of country music that’s cosmopolitan, flexible and self-aware. Whether Cyrus’s co-sign will be enough for the industry side of Nashville to embrace “Old Town Road” remains to be seen. That’s because, when it comes to charts and common practices, country isn’t a genre or a set of sounds as much as it is an oligarchy, the product of a limited number of record labels; a media environment that relies heavily on radio (with programmers who can lack imagination, as female country performers have long known); and a profound bottleneck in terms of new talent and new ideas. (To be fair, country is not alone in this: In 2012, the K-pop novelty star Psy went to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Rap Songs chart with “Gangnam Style,” which was — and remains — one of the biggest viral YouTube songs in history, but was by no means a rap song in the American context.) Nashville’s initial resistance suggests some unfortunate things about country as a genre: that it might not be able to make fun of itself; that it might look askance at outsiders, especially black performers; that it understands itself only through the lens of protecting its central ideology, and not as an omnivorous sound in dialogue with the rest of pop, and the rest of America. Country music is preoccupied with borders, and it treats each new incursion as an opportunity for identity crisis. It’s a wild contrast with contemporary hip-hop, which understands itself as music that borrows widely, and experiments with glee. But perhaps the greatest indictment of how the country music leadership handled “Old Town Road” comes from a cursory listen to some other songs on the chart. Take “Look What God Gave Her,” the new single by Thomas Rhett, perhaps the ur-country gentleman of the last few years. It’s a soft soul song with a faint disco undertow, nothing country about it beyond the perceived affiliation of the performer. Elsewhere there are soft-rock ballads and R&B songs, none of them subject to anything like the skepticism that has greeted Lil Nas X, whose reference points might in fact be more classically country (even if refracted through a kitsch lens). Which means that the Lil Nas X controversy boils down to a conversation about who is entitled to lay public claim to Southern tropes that country music believes it has monopolized (but in truth, has been less and less reliant on in recent years). That it’s happening at a moment featuring more black country music performers than any in recent memory — Darius Rucker, Kane Brown, Jimmie Allen, Mickey Guyton and many more — is especially discouraging. On its own terms, “Old Town Road” has been a wild success. And when it comes the music business’s terms, well, that’s being reverse engineered. Following the Cyrus remix, Lil Nas X teased another with Young Thug. In truth, “Old Town Road” isn’t quite fully country or hip-hop, at least not in the ways those genres taxonomize themselves. It’s something far more slippery, slithering between the two spaces and arriving at pop novelty. This is where songs that have been disowned by their ostensible homes but provide uncomplicated pleasure often land — embraced widely even as they’re kept at arms length locally. But it is too potent to remain that way. It certainly won’t be long before some country singers incorporate it into their live sets. Country stations are beginning to play the song, which serves as a kind of proxy for acceptance. And indeed, Billboard recently announced that it might revisit its decision to include “Old Town Road” on its main country chart — after all, country is as country allows itself to be. "

But there’s a moving sequence midway through that suggests trouble just beneath the surface. The cuts are quick — warm shots of confident guests at the dinner table interspersed with darker scenes in which they’re suffering: poor health, financial hardship, criminal past, abuse, death of a loved one. The message of the video isn’t exactly that nothing is as it seems, but more that where you end up may be far from where you came from, and that success doesn’t cure all obstacles. When 21 Savage first emerged in 2015, he was a cold brutalist of a rapper whose verses verged on the dead-eyed. But just a few years on, he’s taken a turn to the reflective. Later in the video, he added a ruminative new verse to the song, rapping, “Went through some things, but I couldn’t imagine my kids stuck at the border,” directly addressing the current administration’s divisive immigration policies. [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] On Sunday, just a couple of days after that video’s release, 21 Savage was arrested by agents of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which said he was in this country illegally and placed him into deportation proceedings. As of Wednesday afternoon, he remained in ICE custody. Is 21 Savage American? By any measurement other than citizenship, yes. He was born She’yaa Bin Abraham-Joseph in England in 1992. According to Charles Kuck, one of his immigration attorneys, he came to the United States at age 7 and has been here continuously ever since, apart from a one-month period in 2005. He then re-entered the country on an H-4 visa, which expired in 2006, leaving him without legal status. But the events of the last few days underscore the ways in which the hard power of government authority and soft power of online conversation can align in peculiar and insidious ways. As news began to spread on social media of 21 Savage’s arrest on Sunday, the meme and joke ecosystem that uses trauma as oxygen went into overdrive, reacting with special intensity to the revelation that 21 Savage — one of the titans of Atlanta’s rap scene — was in fact British. As the government put his relationship with this country in peril, thousands of people chirped in online to poke at the unlikeliness, and precariousness, of his situation. That 21 Savage is in fact a British national is, ultimately, not particularly revelatory, or even meaningful. Foreign-born residents made up 13.7 percent of the United States population in 2017, according to the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey, published last year (which includes those in the country legally and illegally). Most of the humor turned on a high-society caricature understanding of England, and the dissonance of locating someone like 21 Savage — a seen-it-all stoicist with a dagger tattooed on his forehead — inside it. By and large, those people overlooked, or didn’t think as far as, the more odious association: that of empire and colonization. (His mother’s family hails from Dominica, a former British colony in the West Indies.) His success, however, is especially American. Growing up in some of Atlanta’s poorest communities, 21 Savage had a troubled childhood. He’s said that he dropped out of school to sell drugs, and has spoken in interviews of a youth marked by violence and crime. But after losing a close friend and a brother to gun violence, he turned to rapping. And within a year, he was one of Atlanta’s most promising prospects. He’s since worked with Drake, Cardi B and Post Malone. His 2017 debut album, “Issa Album,” went gold, and his second studio album, “I Am > I Was,” released in December, debuted at the top of the Billboard album chart. At this Sunday’s Grammy Awards, 21 Savage is nominated in two categories. He has also been maturing in the public eye — advocating for gun control, donating money to educate young people in Atlanta on financial literacy (an announcement made on Ellen DeGeneres’s show, of all places), even walking alongside then-girlfriend Amber Rose in 2017 at her SlutWalk, a women’s empowerment event, carrying a sign that read “I’m a Hoe Too.” This is the American promise, no? To start from nothing and turn it into a bounty. To receive a cruel hand and still emerge victorious. And yet there is this other American promise, or threat, which is that all that comfort can be easily ripped away if it isn’t achieved in the correct fashion. In the case of 21 Savage, whose public image was built on a kind of impenetrable toughness mixed with weary resilience, this moment of vulnerability was destabilizing. Even in his most intimate music, he never presents as anything other than an agent of control. But the immigration system is beyond his jurisdiction, even though, since becoming a public figure, he has taken steps to address his status. According to a statement released by his attorneys on Tuesday, in 2017 he applied for a U visa, which, according to United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, can be issued by the government to crime victims “who have suffered mental or physical abuse and are helpful to law enforcement or government officials in the investigation or prosecution of criminal activity.” 21 Savage has said he was shot in 2013. The statement did not specify whether he cooperated with authorities. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that 21 Savage was arrested at the same time DeKalb County police arrested another rapper, Young Nudy, on unrelated charges. But 21 Savage was detained directly by ICE, Kuck said. 21 Savage also was convicted on felony drug charges in 2014. The conviction record was expunged in September 2018 as part of Georgia’s first-offender program and the files have been sealed, according to Jacoby Hudson, who represented 21 Savage in the matter. (Though expunged convictions have been used in deportation proceedings, 21 Savage would be eligible for removal simply for the overstayed visa.) 21 Savage is now among the highest-profile immigration detainees, his situation instantly becoming a flash point in national conversations about people living in this country without legal status, and in dialogues about the ways in which immigrants contribute to American society. A petition asking for his release started by Black Lives Matter has amassed over 200,000 signatures. A star who built his own success, 21 Savage has in one fell swoop re-emerged as someone in need of protection. But in his recent music and public life, his identity was already becoming more complex and nuanced, delivering tales about the horrors of life at the bottom salted with a fresh understanding of just how slippery it can be at the top.

5c64698d3a125f5075c09891,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/13/books/review/walk-this-way-geoff-edgers.html,"WALK THIS WAY Run-DMC, Aerosmith, and the Song That Changed American Music Forever By Geoff Edgers In 2017 Nielsen Music reported that hip-hop and R & B had officially surpassed rock as America’s most-consumed genre. The news elicited international headlines, but for many of us it elicited a yawn. Who didn’t know by then that hip-hop was not just — to cite the rapper Nas, the comedian Katt Williams and countless pundits of the past decade — “as American as apple pie,” but one of America’s greatest exports: a music, culture and ethos that lives and breathes from California to Cape Town, New York to New Delhi? It wasn’t always so, of course. Such is the premise of Geoff Edgers’ “Walk This Way: Run-DMC, Aerosmith, and the Song That Changed American Music Forever,” which argues that before the July 4, 1986, release of the hit in his title — one of the first rap songs played on mainstream radio, the genre’s first in the Billboard Top 10 — almighty hip-hop was merely “a small underground community of independent labels and scrappy promoters.” As Edgers, the national arts reporter for The Washington Post, tells it, the crossover rap-rock tune “made it safe to be black and mainstream,” “proved that hip-hop, dismissed by many as a fad, had legs” and became “so many things to so many different people, from bar mitzvah boys in Westchester County to Ice-T.” It accomplished that, essentially, by being “hip-hop’s Trojan horse, the music camouflaged enough to give timid programmers permission to play”; this fomented a movement like the Harlem Renaissance and San Francisco’s Summer of Love, one that “crossed geographical, economic and, most important, racial lines.” All of this is well-trod territory. There has been no dearth of ink spilled about Run-DMC, Aerosmith or hip-hop’s rise to cultural domination. So in a book that is occasionally hyperbolic yet fastidiously thorough — sometimes too thorough: “Walk This Way” grew from a long-form article and often feels better suited as one, unless you’re enthralled by the nitty-gritty of industry insider-ness — Edgers carves out a niche by creating in narrative fashion the very mash-up he’s documenting, merging two racial and spatial histories just as Run-DMC and Aerosmith’s hit fused disparate sounds and scenes. On the one hand, there’s the sex, drugs and rock ’n’ roll story of Bronx-raised Steven Tallarico, joining forces with Joe Perry in ’70s-era Boston to become Steven Tyler of Aerosmith. Edgers pegs the two as polar opposites: While “Perry has his personality knob set on permanent mumble,” Tyler “blasts into a conversation. He makes up words and phrases and draws on entire waiting rooms of personalities. He dances across decades, cities and relationships.” They made an electrifying onstage duo — until they fell victim to the clichés of rock stardom, battling addiction and going from filling stadiums to grasping at straws for a hit. Meanwhile, over in early-’80s New York — Hollis, Queens, to be exact: far from the white college bars of Boston but still “an urban oasis compared to the burned-out brick buildings of the Bronx” — Joseph Simmons (Run) and Darryl McDaniels (DMC) joined forces with Jason Mizell, a.k.a. Jam Master Jay, to garner fame as Run-DMC. Hip-hop was still, as the music mogul Lyor Cohen says, “a powerful little secret running through America,” but it was bubbling to the surface — Blondie’s 1981 hit “Rapture” name-checked the hip-hop pioneer Fab 5 Freddy and featured him in its video; a popular trio of white kids called the Beastie Boys endearingly wedded hip-hop mettle with adolescent impishness; and Run-DMC released the first rap album to go gold — before falling prey to internal battles incited by the myriad hustles of an underground industry. Into this mix — “a pair of pale-faced rockers itching for a fix, a trio of black kids still trying to figure out why they were there” — enters the producer Rick Rubin: hip-hop’s unlikely poster child. The Long Island-raised Rubin was a proud suburbanite blithe about street cred; “his drug of choice,” Edgers writes, “was the General Tso’s chicken that flowed into his dorm room” at N.Y.U. Thinking of hip-hop as black punk rock, Rubin partnered with Russell Simmons (Run’s brother) to form the iconic label Def Jam. The mission was to capture the genre’s live-show energy on record, and also to transform a hit rock song released by Aerosmith in 1975 into a strange-bedfellows crossover duet. Edgers gives us the hyper-amusing blow-by-blow of just how this duet came alive, from the back-and-forth of lyrical expletives in the studio — Run called Tyler’s lyrics “hillbilly gibberish” — to the recording of a music video that is both harbinger and metaphor for the song’s legacy: Here were the two groups literally breaking down the wall between them so they could rock out — rap out? — together. And the rest is hip-hop history. Or is it? After “Walk This Way,” Aerosmith’s ninth studio album sold five million copies and returned them to stadium-show status. Rubin was crowned “King of Rap” on the cover of The Village Voice. Run-DMC, however, found themselves embroiled in more in-house battles and lawsuits, and though their legacy as hip-hop godfathers is well enshrined, their 1988 “Tougher Than Leather” album was not the commercial smash that Aerosmith’s release was. There is an elephant in the room here, one that Edgers signals toward but ought to face squarely. What does it say about American culture that for an African-American art form to receive its due it had to not just seek white validation but cloak itself in the trappings of whiteness? How is it that the biggest immediate winners in the story were not the black rappers but the white rockers and the white producer? These are rhetorical questions; anyone mildly familiar with American cultural history knows the dynamics at play here. When Edgers casually compares “Walk This Way” to the “historic” moment when “Elvis thrust his pelvis on ‘The Milton Berle Show’ 30 years earlier,” there’s that elephant again: Is anyone more representative of the long legacy of white appropriation of black art forms than Elvis? In rock ’n’ roll it was a shameless, easy process: white artists covering songs by black artists, then earning the money and credit. But wait, you say. In hip-hop it has not been so shameless and easy. Scores of black originators in the genre then and now continue to earn their due. And anyway, hip-hop is not simply “black” but creole: Latinos were vital to its inception; broadly speaking, hip-hop culture was, as Fab 5 Freddy says to Edgers, akin to American pop culture itself: “a collaborative effort between blacks, Jews and Italians, particularly in New York.” This is true. But it is also why hip-hop narratives, like the “Walk This Way” saga, continue to hold so much appeal, almost as America’s national fable: They reinforce the myth of the American dream. The myth that an empire of wealth can grow from dorm rooms (but never mind the price tag on those dorm rooms and thus the color and class of most people inhabiting them). The myth that America is a melting pot of hybrid peoples coming together to produce beautiful cultures (but never mind that such a process has been governed by racist, capitalist-driven power dynamics that continue to benefit some more than others). There is something anachronistic, especially in a Black Lives Matter era, about recounting hip-hop history without more than a nod to these realities. Edgers tells the story with incredulity — behold how one song changed American music! — but in the context of American history the ending is actually an inevitability: If it hadn’t been hip-hop it would have been something else, because as Ralph Ellison pointed out in his famed Time magazine essay “What America Would Be Like Without Blacks,” American culture is African-American culture and vice versa. How this process has played out and for whose benefit, how its reality has been negated by whole swaths of America — including a current president who omits hip-hop from his inauguration because it’s not right for the “typically and traditionally American event” — these are the issues demanding the attention of hip-hop historians of the here and now.

5ca28ae949f0eacbf1f7febb,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/01/us/nipsey-hussle-vigil.html,"LOS ANGELES — It had become an inspiring symbol of success in South Los Angeles, but on Monday the Marathon Clothing store was transformed into a makeshift memorial for the rapper Nipsey Hussle, the co-owner, who was fatally shot outside its doors, stunning fans across the city and the music world. Some prayed and cried, while others left candles, flowers and signs to express their condolences for Hussle, born Ermias Joseph Asghedom, who had grown up in the Crenshaw area and stayed on to help his neighborhood even after becoming big enough to make it out. A steady flow of passing cars on Slauson Avenue blared tracks from his latest album. Bela Vega, 28, a fan, fought back tears as she explained how Hussle, 33, had given hope to people who had also grown up around gang violence. His fans and neighbors clung to lyrics and interviews in which he advocated self-improvement; his financial investments in the community, she said, showed he was serious about creating a ladder for other people who had grown up in similar circumstances. But now, his death, and the questions surrounding it, have reignited longstanding fears about violence and despair in the area. “The story repeats over and over again, and you just ask, ‘When does it stop?’” Ms. Vega said. “This is our community. But do I want my son to grow up over here? No. No.” Two others were wounded in the shooting, and a suspect has yet to be identified, according to the police. Hussle remained a regular presence at the strip mall off Crenshaw Boulevard that houses Marathon. Outside the store on Monday, mourners shared stories about times they had summoned up the courage to say hello to him and the smiles he had flashed back. [More than a dozen people were injured as a stampede broke out at a memorial for Nipsey Hussle.] “He meant everything to the community,” said Lesly Marroquin, 26. “This was all him. His music, he speaks real facts. He talks about how he grew up. He wanted people to see what he went through, to show people they could change. He was a role model.” The area, comprising several predominantly black and Hispanic neighborhoods in South Los Angeles, is home to many working- and middle-class families. Its streets are lined with single-family homes and low-rise apartment buildings, while its main boulevards and thoroughfares feature strip-mall businesses and fast-food restaurants. The area has a troubled history with gang violence, something Hussle addressed in his music. Crime has remained a significant concern, residents said Monday, even as citywide rates have fallen in recent decades. An autopsy found that Hussle died from gunshot wounds to the head and torso, the Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner-Coroner determined. Chief Michel Moore of the Los Angeles Police Department noted Sunday night that in one week there had been 10 homicides and 26 shooting victims across Los Angeles. “That’s 36 families left picking up the pieces,” he said on Twitter. Despite those numbers, the yearly total of homicides in the city of Los Angeles, which includes Crenshaw, has decreased steeply in the last 30 years, from a peak of 1,092 in 1992 to 259 in 2018. Still, Hussle made improving South Los Angeles a priority. After his rap career took off, he diversified beyond the music industry, becoming a local businessman and philanthropist. “From the beginning, Nipsey Hussle has been a critical part of #DestinationCrenshaw, even inspiring the name!” Marqueece Harris-Dawson, a city councilman who represents South Los Angeles, said on Instagram. Destination Crenshaw is a project devised to promote black cultural history in South Los Angeles. Last year, Hussle, who taught himself how to build computers, helped open a center in Crenshaw dedicated to connecting underrepresented groups with technology companies, according to an interview with The Los Angeles Times. “Growing up as a kid, I was looking for somebody — not to give me anything — but somebody that cared,” he told the newspaper. “Someone that was creating the potential for change and that had an agenda outside of their own self interests.” As a teenager, he dropped out of high school and became involved in street life and joined a gang, according to interviews, as he tried to start a rap career. He began releasing music in the mid-2000s, and first made his name with the “Bullets Ain’t Got No Name” series of mixtapes, which established him as an inheritor of the storied lineage of Los Angeles gangster rap, carrying a torch lit by N.W.A, Snoop Dogg and DJ Quik. He was a muscular rapper who delivered direct, unromanticized lyrics about navigating the challenges of street life. On singles like “Hussle in the House,” which had the trademark g-funk synthesizer whine and a reference to “Straight Outta Compton,” Hussle rapped authoritatively as a resident of Crenshaw and especially the notorious Slauson Avenue. “I’m from where homicide boost the economy,” he delivered matter-of-factly. “I came from nothing/so did every other rapper/save the speculation/real banger, gun clapper.” Slender and a little grizzled, with slick braids and a grown-out beard, he identified as a member of the Rollin 60’s Crips gang, which he chalked up to history, circumstance and survival. “I’m not promoting it. I’m just speaking on it,” he said in a 2010 interview with Complex magazine. “I feel like I’m an ambassador,” the rapper added. “I’m more focused on giving solutions and inspiration more than anything.” He had plans to meet on Monday afternoon with representatives from Jay-Z’s Roc Nation and officials from the Los Angeles Police Department to talk about preventing gang violence, according to Steve Soboroff, the Los Angeles police commissioner. As his music career careened forward, Hussle largely stayed the independent route, releasing most of his projects through the All Money In label that he founded in 2010. But his entrepreneurial streak often earned more attention than his songs, namely the marketing coup tied to his 2013 mixtape “Crenshaw,” in which he sold 1,000 copies for $100 each (including 100 copies to Jay-Z, who respected the hustle). The move came as digital piracy and free music online had all but sapped CDs of value, leading Hussle to start his #Proud2Pay movement. “It ISN’T the price of the plastic case and polyurethane disc,” he said at the time, “it’s the price of Revolution! The price of Rebellion against an industry that has tricked us all into making products that have no soul for fear of not being heard if we don’t.” It wasn’t until last year that he released his proper debut studio album, “Victory Lap,” via Atlantic Records (in partnership with All Money In). The LP debuted at No. 4 on the Billboard chart and was nominated for best rap album at the Grammys, losing to Cardi B’s “Invasion of Privacy.” He collaborated with a wide array of rappers, including Drake, the Game, Snoop Dogg, Childish Gambino, Rick Ross and YG. He was an occasional actor and had a memorable performance as a rapper having a feminist awakening on the CW sitcom “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend.” Hussle also guest-starred on YG’s anti-Trump hip-hop anthem “FDT,” rapping: “I’m from a place where you prolly can’t go/speakin’ for some people that you prolly ain’t know/it’s pressure built up and it’s prolly gonna blow.” At the same time as he released “Victory Lap,” which featured Puff Daddy and Kendrick Lamar, Hussle helped open a 4,700-square-foot co-working space in Crenshaw called Vector 90, dedicated to increasing diversity in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. “In our culture, there’s a narrative that says, ‘Follow the athletes, follow the entertainers,’” he told The Los Angeles Times last year. “And that’s cool but there should be something that says, ‘Follow Elon Musk, follow Zuckerberg.’ I think that with me being influential as an artist and young and coming from the inner city, it makes sense for me to be one of the people that’s waving that flag.” He added: “I just want to give back in an effective way.” His death drew condolences from across the music industry and beyond, with everyone from Drake and Rihanna to Steph Curry and Russell Westbrook recognizing the stamp he left on his city. “It’s dangerous to be an MC,” Nas wrote on Instagram. “It’s dangerous to have money. Dangerous To Be A Black Man... Nipsey is a True voice. He will never be silenced.” Hussle was in a relationship with the actress and model Lauren London, with whom he had a son, Kross. He also had a daughter, Emani, from a previous relationship. Outside the Marathon store on Monday, Marcus Adams, 24, said the rapper “was an inspiration” for him as a young black man who grew up in South Los Angeles. Mr. Adams, who is studying business administration at West Los Angeles College, said Hussle’s music reflected his own experience trying to avoid the pitfalls of growing up in an impoverished community. “I came because I just felt I owed it to him,” he said. “It’s a job to come here and show my condolences.” "

The company plans to begin offering classes in March in New York, starting with a foundations of freestyle course that will teach beatboxing and improv. “Our mission is to foster creative voices,” said Anthony Veneziale, a co-founder of the group, who said he hopes the techniques associated with freestyling — rapping and singing stories spontaneously dreamed up based on words or ideas suggested by audience members or other performers — will help inspire new shows and music. And, he said, the group is hoping to diversify the performers of freestyle. “Freestyle Love Supreme” was established in 2003 by Mr. Veneziale, Mr. Miranda, who went on to create “Hamilton,” and Thomas Kail, who became the director of “Hamilton.” The group has performed frequently over the years; it is now performing a commercial run at the Greenwich House Theater that ends on Sunday. Guest performers have included Mr. Miranda, who was onstage there Sunday night, during the Oscars, which were airing at the time (a film he performed in, “Mary Poppins Returns,” was nominated in several categories). The group’s school, the Freestyle Love Supreme Academy, will offer eight-week programs, with three hours of class each week and a fee of $550, that will conclude with student performances. The academy will work in partnership with Mr. Miranda, Mr. Kail, the Ars Nova founders Jenny and Jon Steingart, and Jill Furman, a “Hamilton” co-producer. "
5ca6279b49f0eacbf1f80e8e,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/04/world/middleeast/israel-election-rap-tamer-nafar.html,"JERUSALEM — Frustrated over their choices in the Israeli election, and at Arab politicians whom they describe as ineffective, some Palestinian citizens of Israel have been gathering popular support for a boycott of Tuesday’s ballot. But a well-known Palestinian hip-hop artist released a powerful new video on Thursday pushing back on the boycott, urging Arab citizens not to waste their votes — and expressing hope that a strong turnout on Tuesday could help send Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu packing, or even “to prison.” In the Arabic-language video, which spread widely on social media and has sparked a robust online debate, the rapper, Tamer Nafar of Lod, Israel, argues with himself over whether to vote or stay home, then comes down strongly in favor of voting — dramatizing what Mr. Nafar said had been his own internal dialogue over the past few weeks. “It’s our land, but their state,” the voice of the pro-boycott Mr. Nafar says in the video, which is titled “Tamer Must Vote” in English, adding of the Israeli Parliament, “The Knesset’s not for me.” But the Mr. Nafar who favors voting retorts that even the shekel is Israeli. What then, “throw away our money” and drop out of the economy, since the taxes paid by Arab citizens fund the army? “Plant tea leaves at home so we won’t fund missiles on Gaza?” “They’re using us to look liberal,” the pro-boycotter says, echoing a frequent argument of Palestinian citizens who say that participating in Israeli democracy provides a veneer of equality in Western eyes. “Yeah, baby, democracy is so ’80s,” the pro-voter says sarcastically. His vote wouldn’t change anything, the pro-boycotter responds: It’s like stepping “into a missile war when all I got is a knife,” or fighting a tank “when all I got is a stone.” The pro-voter hits back by acknowledging “it doesn’t mean that we’ll liberate Palestine,” but says, dropping the mic, that “if our vote will erase Lieberman, imprison Bibi, then we’re ready,” referring to the former defense minister Avigdor Lieberman. Indeed, one of the richest ironies that could emerge from Tuesday’s election would be if strong Arab turnout raised the minimum vote threshold for political parties to gain entry into Parliament so high that Mr. Lieberman failed to clear it. His party, Yisrael Beiteinu, is struggling in the polls. [Read about how Prime Minister Netanyahu’s anti-Arab provocations may backfire this time around, though they may have helped him in the past.] It was Mr. Lieberman who pushed a change in the election law that raised the voting percentage threshold in 2015, as a way of banning Arab parties from the Knesset. The Arab parties responded at the time by joining forces, and their Joint List won a record 13 seats in the Knesset that year. Some polls this year indicated turnout among Palestinian citizens would be even higher, given widespread anger at Mr. Netanyahu, who has been running an exceptionally anti-Arab campaign. But the boycott movement is having the reverse effect, exasperating Arab leaders as well as many Jewish Israeli opponents of Mr. Netanyahu who hoped that Arab voters could play a decisive role in defeating him. In an interview, Mr. Nafar said he was still hoping for such a result, which he said would be “poetic justice.” [Read our guide to the Israeli elections.] He said that he was not enamored of Benny Gantz, the former army chief who is neck and neck with Mr. Netanyahu in the polls, but that Mr. Gantz would be preferable to Mr. Netanyahu. And although Mr. Netanyahu is facing indictment only on corruption charges, Mr. Nafar said — he would prefer it be for “war crimes” — “At least it’s something,” he added. “I guess I’m watching too much ‘Game of Thrones,’” he said. Mr. Nafar, 39, began his hip-hop career in the late 1990s, and his lyrics took a strong political turn with the outbreak of the Palestinian uprising known as the Second Intifada, in 2000. The son of Palestinian refugees and a father of two, he was the star of a celebrated autobiographical film, “Junction 48,” in 2016. The Israeli culture minister, Miri Regev, walked out on his performance at the country’s movie awards ceremony that year and has tried to have his performances canceled. “I’m not saying that being in the Knesset is the best medicine, but if I want to let go of it I should do that dose by dose,” he said, explaining his decision to vote — not all at once, with nothing in its place. In the video, Mr. Nafar’s pro-boycott persona has little use for Arab politicians. “Did they deal with poverty? Did they bring us schools and jobs?” he asks. “We only see them out there during elections.” He adds that he voted for the Joint List the last time, but infighting broke it apart. “For me, this ship has sunk,” he says. Yet Mr. Nafar’s pro-vote voice says that rather than the Titanic, he sees Arab politicians as the Mavi Marmara — the protest ship that tried to defy the Israeli blockade of Gaza in 2010, gaining international attention for the Palestinian cause. “It doesn’t make sense for me to give up a tool, when I hardly have any tools, so I’m going to vote,” he says. The alternative, Mr. Nafar said in the interview, would be to allow Israeli leaders to do whatever they wanted to Palestinian citizens — even if, as some extremist right-wing politicians would like, that meant transferring Arab citizens out of Israel. Voting, Mr. Nafar’s alter ego says in the video, was at least one thing he has the power to do to ensure “that I can sing to the boycotters, rather than talk to them in the transfer trucks.” "
5ca1045549f0eacbf1f7afea,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/31/world/europe/italian-minister-pans-hit-song-by-an-immigrants-son.html,"MILAN — Alessandro Mahmoud recently won a prestigious Italian song contest with his Italian-language rap tune “Money,” tinged with a Middle Eastern flavor. The lyrics recall how his Egyptian father “drank champagne during Ramadan” or beckoned him home from the playground with calls of “waladi habibi ta’aleena” — Arabic for “My son, my love, come here.” But it turns out that Italy’s interior minister, Matteo Salvini, was not a fan of the song. “#Mahmood............... meh............ The most beautiful Italian song?!?” Mr. Salvini wrote on Twitter following the result last month. Soon after, a member of his anti-immigrant League party proposed a law to limit foreign songs on the radio. Since then, Mr. Mahmoud, whose stage name is Mahmood, has been thrust into the center of a national debate about what it means to be Italian at a time when critics say the country’s most powerful politician seems intent on stoking racism and xenophobia — not only against new migrants but also legal immigrants who have lived in Italy for years. To that, Mr. Mahmoud, a 26-year-old of Sardinian and Egyptian ancestry, has an easy answer. “I’m super Italian, 100 percent,” said Mr. Mahmoud, who, in further proof of his nationality, still lives at home with his mother. Enter the venerable Italian pop song, timeless to its fans and stuck in time to its detractors. But music experts say it is ever-changing and has always been influenced by foreign styles. “Now we have to understand what is Italian music,’’ Mr. Mahmoud, dressed in a red corduroy jacket, floral shirt and wide-legged pants, said as he sat in a cafe on a recent day. ‘‘It can’t always be the same. Life moves on. Italian music needs new points of view.” He seemed unbothered by the criticism swirling around his victory and showed a text message that Mr. Salvini, an ever-astute politician, had written to him after the controversy exploded. “Ciao, Matteo Salvini here, notwithstanding the musical tastes — I prefer the other guy — enjoy the success. Here’s my number,” it read. Mr. Mahmoud wrote back that he was “sure there wasn’t anything personal.” But in retrospect, he said of Mr. Salvini’s tweet, “obviously there was something underneath it.” The minister “provoked ignorant comments,” Mr. Mahmoud said, such as people questioning how an Egyptian could win the Sanremo Italian Song contest, a cherished national institution. Mr. Mahmoud was born and raised in a neighborhood outside Milan to a Sardinian mother who met his Egyptian father in one of the coffee bars where she worked. As a young boy, he said he listened to Arabic music with his father until his father left when he was five. “And you can tell those melodies stayed in my head,” he said. He attended elementary school in Milan with Russians, Chinese and kids of many other nationalities. He had his Catholic communion and confirmation, took piano lessons, and listened to Italian singer-songwriters Lucio Dalla and Paolo Conte. He was steeped in the soft piano intros and top-of-the-lungs crescendos of the contemporary Italian melodic tradition. As he grew older, he became more influenced by Italian rap and American R&B stars like Frank Ocean, who challenged stereotypes when he came out as gay. Mr. Mahmoud said he has an aversion to being categorized, when it came to his nationality or sexuality. “I don’t feel part of that Italy that judges,” he said. He walked down the block to rehearse his winning song in a nearby studio with some fellow Italian rappers, who were less forgiving of Mr. Salvini’s tweet. “It’s so explicitly racist,” said Fabio Rizzo, a 39-year-old Sicilian rapper known as Marracash who has played on his being mistaken for a Moroccan by riding camels in a music video. “It’s incredible, no? Not even the hypocrisy to hide it.” The Milanese rapper Cosimo Fini, 38, whose stage name is Gué Pequeno, added of Mr. Salvini, “Unfortunately, for me he is expressing the thought of many Italians. Xenophobia, racism.” Mr. Salvini argues that his political enemies discredit themselves by tagging him as a racist or Fascist for everything he says or does, including his preference for one singer over another. But after he voiced his frustration with the result of the song contest, in which a special jury overturned the vote of the home audience, a lawmaker in his League party, Alessandro Morelli, proposed legislation requiring that at least a third of songs on the radio had to be Italian. Mr. Morelli is the former president of Radio Padania, the in-house League station where Mr. Salvini cut his teeth as a DJ. “If we exclude American music, Italian music is the one that has conquered five continents,” Mr. Morelli said nostalgically. The League proposal had the support of some of the mainstays of an Italian music scene that often seems cryogenically stuck in another century. “In Italy, we have about 80 percent foreign music and maybe 20 percent of Italian music,” said Albano Carrisi, better known as Al Bano, whose love life, including his onetime marriage to the daughter of Tyrone Power, has been a staple of Italian variety shows for a half-century. (Statistics showed nearly half the songs on the radio were Italian.) Mr. Carrisi attributed the longevity of Italian singers like himself on Italian television to the advanced age of the television audience. He put Mr. Mahmoud squarely in his category of Italian singers, but the rapper’s hit song was another matter. “It’s sung in Italian,” Mr. Carrisi said. “But Italian music is another thing. That’s not it.” Mr. Carrisi, who recently sang his 1967 hit with Mr. Salvini at the Interior Ministry, where the singer was promoting his wine company, said that Italian easy listening music was more melodic. The exemplar, he said, was the refrain of ‘‘Volare,’’ the winning song at Sanremo in 1958 — and was uncorrupted by the influence of American rap. Mr. Carrisi, who was blacklisted this month by Ukraine apparently in part for serenading Vladimir Putin in Moscow at a 100th anniversary celebration of the KGB, traced the roots of Italian easy listening back to Gregorian chants and Verdi. But some Italian music experts disagreed. Jacopo Tomatis, author of the new book, “The Cultural History of the Italian Song,” said there was a clear continuity between the songs popularized during Fascism and the postwar hits that Italians built their musical identity around. He pointed out a 1951 bulletin of the Italian state broadcaster that explained how Sanremo began as an effort to protect the Italian song against “the influence of African-American and Latin-American music.” The centrality of “Italianness” to the country’s music was ironic, he said, because “popular Italian music has always been an elaboration of foreign styles.” That foreignness is more explicitly celebrated by Italians such as Mr. Mahmoud and Ghali Amdouni, a rising Italian star of Tunisian ancestry, who is also from outside Milan. In his hit “Dear Italy,” he raps, “When they tell me to go home, I answer I’m already here.” Mr. Amdouni launched his new album at the local prison a few minutes from Mr. Mahmoud’s recording studio. For now though, the moment belonged to Mr. Mahmoud, who will represent Italy in next month’s Eurovision song contest. That same night, a circle of 7-year-old girls sang Mr. Mahmoud’s hit song as they waited in line at a local club. Mr. Mahmoud was there to chat with Milan’s mayor about reaching out to the city’s youth. “In the face of the Salvini’s words, I shrugged, and I thought let me use this opportunity to show a positive example,” the mayor, Giuseppe Sala, said backstage. On stage, the mayor showed a packed room Mr. Mahmoud’s elementary school class picture. Three children of Egyptian parents from the singer’s neighborhood shouted with joy when Mr. Mahmoud sang a couple bars of his song. “He’s such a good singer,” one of them, Habiba Ibrahim, 13, said. “And he’s so cool.” "

This week, the number is 823 — along with 83 million streams, that is. Those are the numbers for “Hoodie SZN” (Highbridge/Atlantic), by the New York rapper A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie, the latest and most extreme example of the disparity that now exists in the music industry between the still-rapid growth of streaming and the cratering business of old-fashioned album sales. Billboard and Nielsen credit “Hoodie SZN” with the equivalent of 58,000 sales in the United States last week, a number that incorporates streams and downloads of individual tracks, as well as sales of the full album. But the vast majority of that composite number is from streaming — so much so that the sales number represents a new low on the chart. The 823 copies of “Hoodie SZN” that were sold last week — all as downloads, since that title has not been released on any physical formats — is the least number of copies that any album has sold in the week it went to No. 1. It tops a record set just the week before by 21 Savage’s “I Am > I Was,” which sold 3,481 copies and had 84 million streams. These numbers reflect a business that has become so dominated by streaming that CD sales are all but disappearing, except with a handful of superstars like Taylor Swift and Adele, or when they are bundled with concert tickets. The Recording Industry Association of America reported that for the first half of 2018 (the most recent figures it has published), streaming represented 75 percent of all retail sales revenue in the United States, while physical formats were just 10 percent. During those six months, only 18.6 million CDs were sold in the United States, a decline of 47 percent from the first half of 2017. Before Billboard began to incorporate streaming numbers in its album chart, in 2014, the lowest sales number for a No. 1 album was 40,478, set by Amos Lee’s “Mission Bell” in February 2011. The rest of this week’s Top 10 is, for the most part, just slightly reshuffled from the week before. 21 Savage’s “I Am > I Was” fell to No. 2, the “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse” soundtrack is No. 3, Meek Mill’s “Championships” is No. 4, and Post Malone’s “Beerbongs & Bentleys” is in fifth place.

Also this week, the soundtrack to “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,” featuring Post Malone, Juice WRLD and Nicki Minaj, among others, rose one spot to No. 2, swapping places with 21 Savage’s “I Am > I Was,” which fell one rung to No. 3. Post Malone’s “Beerbongs & Bentleys” is No. 4, and Meek Mill’s “Championships” is in fifth place. "
5c802f9349f0eacbf105bb17,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/06/us/politics/supreme-court-rap-music.html,"WASHINGTON — Five years ago, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. enlivened a Supreme Court argument by reciting raw and violent lyrics from the rapper Eminem. The chief justice said he was worried that ignoring the song’s musical and cultural context could “subject to prosecution the lyrics that a lot of rap artists use.” That case, about online threats in a domestic dispute, ended in a cryptic muddle. But now the issue Chief Justice Roberts raised in passing is squarely at the court’s doorstep, in an appeal from a Pittsburgh rapper sent to prison for two years for threatening police officers — in a song. This time, the justices will have expert assistance from a group of hip-hop stars, including Chance the Rapper, Meek Mill, Killer Mike, Yo Gotti, Fat Joe and 21 Savage. In a brief filed Wednesday, they urged the Supreme Court to hear their fellow rapper’s First Amendment challenge to his conviction. [Read the brief here.] They also offered the justices, whose average age is about 66, what they called “a primer on rap music and hip-hop.” “A person unfamiliar with what today is the nation’s most dominant musical genre or one who hears music through the auditory lens of older genres such as jazz, country or symphony,” they wrote, “may mistakenly interpret a rap song as a true threat of violence.” In an interview, Killer Mike, the performer and political activist, said judicial treatment of rap music was sometimes infected by racism. “Outlaw country music is given much more poetic license than gangster rap, and I listen to both,” he said. “And I can tell you that the lyrics are dark and brutal when Johnny Cash describes shooting a man in Reno just to watch him die and when Ice Cube rapped about a drive-by shooting early in his career.” “It’s no different from stop and frisk,” he said. “It’s another form of racial profiling.” The case before the Supreme Court concerns Jamal Knox, a black artist who raps under the name Mayhem Mal and as part of Ghetto SuperStar Committee. After being arrested in 2012 in Pittsburgh on gun and drug charges, Mr. Knox and a friend recorded a song whose title, which included a vulgar word directed at the police, was partly a homage to an N.W.A. classic with a similar name. The friend posted the song on YouTube and Facebook. The song named the officers who conducted the arrest and were scheduled to testify against Mr. Knox. It included lyrics like “let’s kill these cops ’cause they don’t do us no good,” and featured sounds of sirens and gunfire. Some listeners, including the rappers supporting Mr. Knox, heard boisterous wordplay and political rhetoric. “This is a work of poetry,” the rappers wrote. “It is not intended to be taken literally, something that a reasonable listener with even a casual knowledge of rap would understand.” Prosecutors heard something different, and they charged Mr. Knox with issuing terroristic threats and intimidating witnesses. The officers testified that the song made them nervous and fearful, and one said it figured in his decision to leave the police force. At his sentencing in 2014, Mr. Knox, who was 19, said he had adopted a persona in the song. “I mean, as a rapper, we have to put on an image,” he told the judge. “So even when things may go wrong, like you got to make it still seem like as if it’s right.” The Pennsylvania Supreme Court affirmed Mr. Knox’s conviction based largely on the printed lyrics. That was a mistake, Mr. Knox’s lawyers wrote in their petition seeking review in the United States Supreme Court. “The song’s lyrics were never meant to be read as bare text on a page,” they wrote. “Rather, the lyrics were meant to be heard, with music, melody, rhythm and emotion.” Writing for the majority in the State Supreme Court, Chief Justice Thomas G. Saylor focused on Mr. Knox’s literal message. “The song’s lyrics express hatred toward the Pittsburgh police,” he wrote. “As well, they contain descriptions of killing police informants and police officers.” “They do not,” he added, “include political, social or academic commentary, nor are they facially satirical or ironic.” In their brief, the rappers said that assertion revealed “a court deeply unaware of popular music generally and rap music specifically.” For support, they cited Ice-T’s memoir, in which he explained that there was a difference between the persona he adopted in the song “Cop Killer” and his actual one. “If you believe that I’m a cop killer,” he wrote, “you believe David Bowie is an astronaut.” (That was a reference, of course, to Bowie’s “Space Oddity.”) The First Amendment does not protect all speech. There are exceptions for libel, incitement, obscenity and fighting words, and one for “true threats,” which is at issue in Mr. Knox’s case. Such prosecutions are not unusual, as there are dozens of statutes making it a crime to issue various kinds of threats. In the decade ending in 2014, some 1,500 people were charged with making threatening communications under federal law, according to a brief supporting Mr. Knox from the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. R. Stanton Jones, one of Mr. Knox’s lawyers, said rap music is particularly prone to being misunderstood. “While famous rappers like Eminem win Grammy Awards and make millions off the violent imagery in their songs, judges and juries are routinely convinced that lesser-known rap artists are somehow living out their lyrics as rhymed autobiography,” Mr. Jones said. “It’s an alarming trend, often with devastating consequences for the young men of color who are almost always targeted in these cases.” The Supreme Court has not given definitive guidance on how to tell when a threat is a crime. It has suggested that two things are needed: that the speaker intended to make a threat and that a reasonable listener would have understood the statement to be a threat. In 1969, the court threw out a case against a draft protester charged with threatening President Lyndon B. Johnson. “If they ever make me carry a rifle,” the protester said, “the first man I want to get in my sights is L.B.J.” The remark was not a true threat, the court ruled, because it was conditional, made at a rally and greeted by laughter. Reasonable people, the court said, would not have understood the statement to be a threat. The court did not consider whether the protester intended to threaten the president. In 2003, in a case about cross burning, the court ruled that the speaker’s intent matters. Read together, the two decisions suggest that prosecutors must prove both the speaker’s subjective intent and a reasonable listener’s objective understanding. In Mr. Knox’s case, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that there was proof that he had intended to issue threats. But the court seemed to say that proof that his statements would reasonably be understood as threats was not needed. Mr. Knox’s lawyers said that left a dangerous gap. “The notion that one could commit a ‘speech crime’ by uttering an objectively harmless statement with bad intent is profoundly chilling,” they wrote.

5c5361e83a125f5075c0765d,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/books/angie-thomas-on-the-come-up-hate-you-give.html,"Few first novelists have the kind of success Angie Thomas saw with “The Hate U Give,” which has spent 100 weeks on the Times Best-Seller list and been made into an equally acclaimed movie. Perhaps even fewer write a second novel that gets as many advance raves as Thomas’s “On the Come Up,” which will be published this month. It’s set in the same fictional community, Garden Heights, as “The Hate U Give,” but Thomas turns her attention away from Starr (the protagonist in her first novel) to the world of hip-hop, and Brianna, a talented teenager who lives and breathes it. I asked her to talk about how the book came into being. These are excerpts from our conversation. When did you start writing “On the Come Up”? Even before I wrote “The Hate U Give,” I knew I wanted to write a novel that paid homage to hip-hop. For me, as a teenager, hip-hop was how I saw myself when I didn’t see myself in books. And I could never seem to find books that gave hip-hop its due. A lot of times in Young Adult books, hip-hop is only used when the characters are at parties — otherwise they’re more into indie rock. But for so many kids, hip-hop is their music, hip-hop is their culture, it speaks to them when other things don’t. I mean, white suburban kids are the biggest consumers of hip-hop. [Read our review of “On the Come Up.”] I had this character, Bri, and I knew she had to be a rapper, but that’s all. I got the idea for the plot after “The Hate U Give,” when I began to deal with challenges to the novel, people trying to censor it. A police union in South Carolina spoke out against the book being on a summer reading list. The union was concerned that it created anti-police sentiments. And it was challenged by some school districts, because of the language. Of course, if they paid attention to what their students were saying in the hallways they would hear many more f-bombs than I could ever write. I knew it wasn’t really about the language, it was the subject matter. So when I was dealing with my own censorship, I thought of the rappers who had meant so much to me, like Tupac, Biggie, Lauryn Hill and Nas, and how they went through it. I was raised knowing that when hip-hop spoke up, it was always challenged. So often when rappers speak, they’re criticized for how they do it, as opposed to what they actually say. I was looking to them for inspiration about the censorship I was facing, just as I was trying to write a book about hip-hop. My mantra is: I want to write the way rappers write. They can make us laugh, they can make us cry, they can make us uncomfortable, they can make us feel empowered. When they use hip-hop well, they’re being authentic and true to themselves. When you write for teenagers, they know phoniness a mile away. I have to be real with them even if it makes other adults uncomfortable. As you wrote, did you feel the weight of the success of “The Hate U Give”? Everyone says the second book is the hardest and I can attest to that. I felt like I had a thousand eyes looking over my shoulder with every line I wrote, saying “Well, Starr wouldn’t say that.” I had to get into the mind-set of writing it for myself, not for readers of “The Hate U Give.” At times I even felt resentful of that book. But I’m happy it was a struggle because I learned to listen to my own voice inside and write for myself first. How did you set about creating the character of Brianna, who is very different from Starr? It was always going to be a whole different book from “The Hate U Give,” but when I did think about Bri in relationship to Starr, it was with the idea of going in the exact opposite direction. People tell me all the time, “I love that Starr has such a stable and functional family.” Well, Bri’s family is not as stable and functional. Who’s to say a young lady with a family like that doesn’t deserve to have her story told? People tell me, “I love how Starr handles herself.” Well, here’s a young lady who speaks from her heart and speaks without thinking. This is another story set in Garden Heights, but I do not want anyone to assume their lives are the same. I hope some readers walk away learning that even black kids from the same place are totally different. I thought it was brave of you to give Bri an “anger management issue,” given the stereotypes about “angry black women” out there. For sure, black girls get that “angry black girl” stereotype put on them, and it doesn’t allow them to be angry. It was important to me to let her have her anger and own it — there’s nothing wrong with anger, and I wanted to show that being angry doesn’t have to mean being irrational. Men get to be angry all the time. Did becoming involved with student activism after “The Hate U Give” change your approach to fiction writing? To me it all comes down to writing stories that people ultimately want to read, and keeping that the priority. But I do think about those kids a lot, and how I influence them. I remind myself, and I tell my fellow writers, that the kids we write for today are going to be politicians with Twitter accounts tomorrow. I know what these kids read now will affect the people they become. I’m a firm believer that if our current leaders read books about black kids when they were kids, we wouldn’t be where we are today. If they read books about Latino kids, they wouldn’t be calling for walls. In this book you do something really well that we rarely see on the page, which is lay out the interior, mental process of composing a rap, or any kind of rhyming verse, for that matter. I have the utmost respect for rappers, specifically the ones who are good! Because word play and sentence structure and flow and all that, they are not easy to do. I was mainly going on how I did it when I was a teenager. I asked myself, what made me decide to rhyme this word with that word? So often hip-hop is written off, and people don’t consider it an art form. In showing Bri’s mind-set as she does her rhymes, I wanted to show people that this is not easy, you really have to have a talent, and study and learn and take it seriously if you want to do it well. It was many, many drafts! One of the other pleasures of this book is the presence of Bri’s grandparents and their church friends. You found the comedy in them but also, there are some deep ideas about generations and families.  A lot of this book was inspired by my own teenage years. My big tragedy was when my mom lost her job and it put my family into crisis mode, but I also drew on how I grew up living in a nontraditional two-parent household — and I say nontraditional because my two parents were my mom and my grandma. That’s a reality for a lot of kids, but it also can be messy. My family was more functional than Bri’s, but my grandmother too was a huge part of my upbringing. Also, I wanted Bri’s story to be parallel to hip-hop’s story. When I think of hip-hop in relation to soul and R & B, in a lot of ways those are the grandparents of hip-hop. Artists in those genres will criticize hip-hop, and don’t understand it. But you can’t disconnect hip-hop from R & B, from the blues, from gospel even. Bri’s grandparents don’t always understand her or agree with her, but they’re still connected to her and influence her. You focused a little more on teenage romance in this book, too. Why did you decide to go there? I always feel like I drop the ball on the romance part — and you know, it’s not a requirement of a young adult book by any means, but sometimes it feels as though, you should have something in there. I just never want to make my readers feels as if they have to have this happening in their lives, they have to act a certain way. With Bri, we see this crush she’s had for so long, but I raise the question: ‘Just because this is the person I’ve liked for so long, is this the person I should be with?’ Have you already started another novel? I have, and I’m still writing to find out what happens. All I can tell you is, it’s also set in Garden Heights. "
5ca7b2ce49f0eacbf1f813e9,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/05/us/chris-darden-nipsey-hussle-public-defender.html,"The killing this week of Nipsey Hussle, a rapper and advocate for the communities of South Los Angeles, sent a painful tremor throughout those neighborhoods and the music industry. Now the man charged in his death, Eric Holder, is being represented by another Los Angeles figure: Christopher Darden, who became a household name when he helped prosecute — unsuccessfully — O.J. Simpson in 1995 for the deaths of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald L. Goldman. Here’s a look at Mr. Darden, the man who famously asked Mr. Simpson to try on the bloody glove. After leaving the district attorney’s office, Mr. Darden worked as a law professor, and was a co-writer on several legal thrillers as well as “In Contempt,” a behind-the-scenes account of the Simpson case that The New York Times called “powerful and affecting.” The Times’s review noted the personal consequences that Mr. Darden said he suffered as Mr. Simpson’s lead lawyer, Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., manipulated the issue of race during the trial: “The defense lawyer’s suggestion that Mr. Darden was a token black recruited by the prosecution team for the color of his skin led to accusations, on the street, that he was ‘an Uncle Tom, a sellout, a house Negro,’ Mr. Darden says. He writes that he received death threats and was spat upon, and that his family, too, was harassed.” Mr. Darden also became a defense lawyer and worked as a commentator on legal cases for a number of television networks. Yes. Many law school graduates favor starting their careers as prosecutors. It pays less than some of them could make in private practice, but it provides invaluable court experience early in their careers, while their more highly paid law school classmates who take private jobs spend their time on legal research and helping more seasoned lawyers prepare cases. Prosecution work also teaches them the ins-and-outs of plea bargaining and negotiations between lawyers, which is how the overwhelming majority of criminal cases are resolved. So when they hang a shingle to become a defense lawyer, they can immediately draw on years of experience as prosecutors. Many of the criminal defense lawyers in any county seat are typically former prosecutors, while the best private lawyers who handle white-collar litigation and other expensive specialties often were once federal prosecutors. (Earlier in his career, Mr. Cochran had been a prosecutor in the Los Angeles County district attorney’s office.) It’s the most remembered moment of the Simpson trial, which prompted Mr. Cochran’s famous exhortation: “If it doesn’t fit, you must acquit.” Mr. Darden addressed the impact of that pivotal moment, and his decision to ask Mr. Simpson to try on the glove, during a Reddit “Ask Me Anything” session in 2017. “Quite honestly, I did not appreciate at the time the impact that little ditty had on the jurors,” Mr. Darden wrote. “I thought it was a kids’ rhyme for idiots, to be honest, but it was effective.” He added: “I take responsibility for the glove issues, so if there is any blame or fault to be assessed, it fell on me. And it should be assessed to me, because I’m the only one strong enough to carry that burden.” He said he felt it was clear that Mr. Simpson did what he could to avoid making the glove fit. “I hoped the jury would recognize that, but they couldn’t see it, because they didn’t want to see it,” he said. Some have been critical of Mr. Darden, 62, for taking on the defense of a man charged with killing a beloved figure in his community. But as Mr. Darden made plain in his book, he has endured such criticism before, including being called a traitor for helping to prosecute Mr. Simpson. Yet many lawyers hold strongly to the concept that everyone is entitled to a defense. In fact, Mr. Darden has said that if he had been a criminal defense lawyer at the time, he would not have had a problem defending Mr. Simpson. Mr. Darden has said that, as a young man, he grew interested in becoming a lawyer from watching trials involving civil rights leaders. “I knew how important the law was to the black community, and I admired those lawyers who took those cases, and I wanted to be one of them,” he said on Reddit.

Furious at the disease, I’m starting the new year with a yowl. Survivors of patients who have not survived, people dealing with a terminal condition, and their caregivers are generally advised to seek acceptance. However, great artists of anger have taught us how cathartic a rousing roar can be, especially when the object of rage is not a conjured scapegoat but a clear and present danger. One of the greatest of those artists in living memory — the singer, pianist, composer Nina Simone — lambasted the disasters of American racism. Does she have something to teach those of us dealing with cancer-related tragedies? In 1963, after the killings of Medgar Evers and of four little girls in the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Ms. Simone began producing a number of anthems for the civil rights and black power movements. One of her most powerful songs continues to be all too relevant. The lyrics of “Mississippi Goddam,” I thought, might serve me while cancer’s casualties stun me. By tweaking Nina Simone’s words, would I implicitly be comparing rampant racism to metastatic disease or vice versa? I could live with that analogy, as Susan Sontag — the public intellectual who rejected all metaphors of illness — once did. Ms. Simone reinvented other refrains created by writers of many different ethnicities and nations, shaping them to her purposes. In doing so, she has emboldened me to recycle some of her stanzas for people from diverse backgrounds who live with cancer. When borrowing is acknowledged, after all, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. Here, then, is a homage to Nina Simone that I hope will lead you to listen to her terrific rendition of “Mississippi Goddam.” In an aside within this edgy elegy of damaged lives, she calls it “a show tune, but the show hasn’t been written for it yet.” I also feel as if I have been watching a show that hasn’t been written yet. After too many cancer-related setbacks and deaths of relatives, friends, and correspondents — you readers could not be more moving about your own bereavements — I started belting Nina Simone’s protest with new words, invigorated by her spirit of indignant fury. When cancer feels like an epidemic, it may be easier to rage than to mourn, as all of us undoubtedly will, over rending losses. Carcinoma Goddam Myeloma’s got me so upsetLeukemia’s made me lose my rest And everybody knows about carcinoma goddam. Metastatic breast has gotten me upset Mesothelioma made me lose my rest And everybody knows about pancreatic goddam. Can’t you see it? Can’t you feel it?

Kuck Baxter Immigration, the law firm representing the rapper, whose legal name is She’yaa Bin Abraham-Joseph, posted news of his pending release on its Facebook page on Tuesday afternoon. “In the last 24 hours, in the wake of the Grammy Awards at which he was scheduled to attend and perform, we received notice that She’yaa was granted an expedited hearing,” the post said. “Today, 21 Savage was granted a release on bond. He won his freedom.” Mr. Abraham-Joseph, 26, was arrested in the early hours of Feb. 3 during an operation by federal and local law enforcement authorities in Atlanta, Immigration and Customs Enforcement said at the time. The agency said in a statement at the time that he was a British national who had entered the United States on a nonimmigrant visa in 2005 and was supposed to leave the following year. The agency also said that Mr. Abraham-Joseph was convicted of felony drug charges in Fulton County, Ga., in 2014. One of Mr. Abraham-Joseph’s lawyers, Charles Kuck, said that conviction was vacated and the charges were dismissed by prosecutors in 2018. A member of the rapper’s legal team, Dina LaPolt, said in a statement after his arrest that he had been “left without legal status through no fault of his own” because “as a minor, his family overstayed their work visas.” Mr. Kuck said his client was 12 when his immigration status expired. Mr. Abraham-Joseph was nominated for a Grammy Award for record of the year for “Rockstar,” a song with the rapper Post Malone, but did not win at the awards ceremony on Sunday. Known for his flat delivery and subdued rap style, his album “I Am > I Was” opened at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in January. Charles Kuck, another member of Mr. Abraham-Joseph’s legal team, said Tuesday that the rapper had been granted release but would have to spend one more night in custody. “We actually can’t get him out today because ICE stops taking money at 2 o’clock and the judge’s decision came down at around 2:15,” Mr. Kuck said. “He’ll be released in the morning.” Mr. Kuck declined to say what bail had been set at or where his client was being detained, but he said Mr. Abraham-Joseph had been treated well. “The facility where he has been held has been extraordinarily gracious to him, his legal team and his family,” Mr. Kuck said. “They have treated him well and we are grateful for their hospitality, as best as that can be in a jail cell.” A spokesman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. Mr. Abraham-Joseph’s next date in immigration court is set for April 11, Mr. Kuck said. The Facebook post from Mr. Abraham-Joseph’s lawyers on Tuesday said that he wanted to draw attention to immigration detainees who are not as well known as he is. “He will not forget this ordeal or any of the other fathers, sons, family members, and faceless people he was locked up with or that remain unjustly incarcerated across the country,” the post said. “And he asks for your hearts and minds to be with them.” "

The tribute makes Elliott the third rapper to ever be honored by the organization, following Jay-Z’s induction in 2017 and Jermaine Dupri’s last year. The list of this year’s inductees was announced on Saturday’s episode of “CBS This Morning,” and featured an appearance by the Hall of Fame chairman and musician Nile Rodgers, who called Elliott “one of my favorite writers of all time.” Not only is Elliott, a Grammy Award-winning artist, responsible for monumental hits from the early 2000s like “Get Ur Freak On” and “Work It,” but she’s also the only female rapper to have six studio albums certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. Over the course of her three-decade career, she’s written for some of the music industry’s most talented female artists, including Beyoncé (“Signs”), Whitney Houston (“In My Business”), Aaliyah (“If Your Girl Only Knew”), Mary J. Blige (“Never Been”) and Ciara (“One Two Step”). In its announcement, the Hall of Fame recognized Elliott as “a groundbreaking solo superstar, pioneering songwriter-producer and across-the-board cultural icon.” On Saturday, Elliott responded on Twitter by congratulating “all the AMAZING songwriters who have been inducted” this year, all of whom became eligible 20 years after their first commercial release of a song. The 2019 class also includes the singer-songwriters Yusuf Islam (better known as Cat Stevens), John Prine, Tom T.

5c76e03149f0eacbf105a7cc,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/27/arts/music/gunna-drip-or-drown-2-review.html,"At the beginning of “3 Headed Snake,” from his new album, “Drip or Drown 2,” Gunna is beautifully mumbling. Words are in there somewhere, but they’re genuinely of no concern. Rather than use a mumble to signal confusion or disorientation, he treats blurry words as a thing of exuberance. For him, the dance of pure syllables is almost peppy. Gunna is not the first rapper to retreat into the warm cocoon of pure tones. He is a dutiful student of Young Thug’s non sequitur filigree, which dominates the sound of streaming and has been put to use by everyone from Post Malone to Lil Baby. But Gunna is preternaturally chill, almost koan-like in his delivery. His voice is whisper-sweet. He raps on beats as if lightly touching them, fearful that they might snap under too much force. For the last couple of years, the 25-year-old rapper from Georgia has been releasing strong mixtapes steadily — “Drip or Drown 2” doesn’t quite have the full force of last year’s “Drip Season 3” or “Drip Harder,” his collaborative album with Lil Baby, but it is still thick with his signatures: calmness and word manipulation. Sometimes he bends words so hard that “ways” rhymes with “bags.” Sometimes he emphasizes the rhyme in the middle of the phrase as much as the one at the end of it. Sometimes he is narrative-driven, rapping about new cars, new clothes and new women, but generally he strings clauses together as if absent-minded, a fever dream of excess and bravado. (The most pure version of this here is on “Speed It Up,” where the phrases come hot and short.) In places, he opts for surrealism: “Pop an addy while I’m riding to meet Tom Ford.” And sometimes he leans on humor: “Got vintage garments old as my granny.” Gunna has a penchant for rapping over beats that include guitar, like on “Richard Millie Plain,” but he doesn’t use them for rock scabrousness. Instead, they’re caressing, soft-edged beds, elegant accompaniment for a rapper who makes his points with textures more than words. That said, there is a tenderness that peeks through here, not just in the gentleness of the sing-rapping, but also in some of the lyrics. Everyone raps about buying expensive new things, but only Gunna links the ability to spend money wantonly to emotional intimacy. On “Idk Why,” he raps, “Mama thanked me for her purse/And looked me in my face and then she started crying.” And on “Yao Ming,” he relates a tale familiar to anyone who thinks of a loved one while traveling: “Went shopping in Japan, spent more than my show/Brought Thugger back some pants.” "

Age: 29 Hometown: Born in Tripoli, Libya, Gashi and his family lived in 24 countries before settling in Brooklyn when he was 11. Now lives: He splits his time between a spacious loft in Beverly Hills, Calif., and a new house in the Kensington area of Brooklyn that he bought for his parents in 2017. Claim to fame: Gashi is a rising rapper and singer who has collaborated with DJ Snake, French Montana and other big industry names. His eclectic style (he sometimes wears a patterned scarf tied on his head) and self-aware lyrics (his song “YouTube Comments” tackles cyberbullying) stem from his worldly upbringing.  “It’s very rare for a kid like me — a refugee — to say things like, ‘I live in L.A.,’ ‘I moved my parents into a bigger home,’ ‘I got my father a car,’” he said. “It doesn’t feel real. I’m afraid if I blink I will miss this moment.” Big break: As a young boy in Munich, Gashi made money for his family by performing Michael Jackson moves on the streets. He hasn’t stopped grooving since. In 2016, a video of him dancing to his breakout single “Disrespectful,” filmed by his mother, blew up online, spurring millions of streams on SoundCloud and a deal with Roc Nation.  During a meeting with RCA Records soon after, he wowed a conference room full of executives with an energetic impromptu performance. They signed him on the spot. “All my life, I can never stand in one place when I’m listening to music,” he said. Latest project: His public persona defies neat labels. In January, he recorded a cover of “Hurt” by Nine Inch Nails at Spotify’s New York Studios. The following month, he made his TV debut on “the Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,” performing his single “My Year,” with G-Eazy and a blizzard of confetti.  “The thing that shocked me was how small the studio was,” Gashi said. “Everything on TV looks super-huge, but in reality it’s like a small elementary school auditorium.” Next thing: His debut album with RCA Records drops this year. “The album is basically about a rapper who is stuck in a time machine and is forced to make ’80s music,” he said. “I am the trap Phil Collins.” His mask: Before his record deal, Gashi made ends meet by helping out his father, who worked as a janitor at his family’s apartment building in Brooklyn. “People would bully me and be like, ‘How can he be a rapper if he’s a garbageman?” he said. “So, my mother said to me, ‘Why don’t you wear a ski mask so they don’t see you?’”  He is now rarely seen without a neon-orange balaclava mask rolled into a tight skull cap. “I wear my ski mask before a performance to get into my zone,” he said.

The premise — a family stalked by its disfigured doppelgängers — was chilling, but much of the online reaction focused on the teaser’s use of “I Got 5 on It,” the 1995 platinum hit by the Oakland rap duo Luniz. As the trailer opens, the song plays over the car radio while the family discusses its meaning, prompting the dad’s accidental double entendre: “It’s not about drugs, it’s a dope song!” Known as the San Francisco Bay Area’s premier pot-smoking anthem, the track gets a makeover as the trailer turns darker — slowed down, then beefed up with orchestral overdubs, becoming a terrifying, atmospheric motif. [Read Manohla Dargis’s review of “Us.”] “You’d never think of it as a scary movie song,” said Anthony Gilmour, 52, the Bay Area rap producer known as Tone Capone, who made the original track. “But when they slow it up, it just sounds creepy.” Peele told Entertainment Weekly that the track had haunting undertones: “I feel like the beat in that song has this inherent cryptic energy, almost reminiscent of the ‘Nightmare on Elm Street’ soundtrack.” (He also liked that it was a Bay Area classic, appropriate for a film set in Northern California.) Luniz’s Garrick Husbands, 43, known as Numskull, said he was ecstatic to learn the song would be included in the film’s promotion. “It was the best thing, besides my children being born, I had ever heard,” he said in a phone interview. For many younger rap fans, this was their first encounter with Luniz, who originally formed as the LuniTunes in 1992. Linking up with Tone Capone the following year, Luniz helped usher in the Bay Area’s “Mob Music” sound — slow, brooding, 808-drum-machine-driven grooves often known as “slumpers.” The duo’s 1995 debut, “Operation Stackola,” went platinum on the strength of “I Got 5 on It.” Follow-ups in 1997 and 2002 didn’t reach the same heights, and the duo split around 2005, reuniting in 2015 for a mixtape called “High Timez.” In 2018, it released an EP, “No Pressure,” and it’s currently working on new singles. “I’ll give you a hint: They’re definitely around what’s going on with the movie,” said Luniz’s Jerold Ellis, 44, the rapper known as Yukmouth. (On March 8, the day “Us” had its premiere at SXSW, the duo released a revamped version of the track, “I Got 5 on Us,” with a video inspired by the film.) “I Got 5 on It” initially appeared in two scenes in “Us,” but the horror version — known as the “Tethered Mix” — was added to the soundtrack “as a result of its success in the trailer,” said Stacey Zarro, the vice president for publicity at the movie’s distributor, Universal Pictures. The “Tethered Mix” was the brainchild of Joe Wees, the senior vice president for creative marketing at Universal, and the trailer editor John Cantu. (Michael Abels was the composer for “Us.”) “We struck it down to where we had just a bit of the lyrics and some tones, added in our own effects, and then hired composition companies to help fill those in,” Wees said. (The “Us” team declined to name who finished up the mix.) Tone Capone was more than happy to dissect the revised track, noting some low-frequency oscillation on the bells and plucked strings. “They’re playing it at a slower tempo, using a turntable or a processor and then a computer to keep the pitch the same,” he said. As a producer, Tone Capone’s bona fides in Bay Area rap run deep. Working under the name DJ Cool G, he provided turntable scratches on the 1987 album “Surf or Die” by the Surf MC’s, a novelty group that nonetheless edged out the scene’s acknowledged founder, Too Short, as the first local rap act to sign to a major label. He provided an early influential remix of Eric B. and Rakim’s “Casualties of War” in 1992, and was soon directing label scouts to the region, yielding deals for Luniz, Dru Down and the Keak da Sneak launchpad 3X Krazy. Apart from “I Got 5 on It,” he is most famous for co-producing the Geto Boys’ Scarface, including the 1997 smash “Smile,” one of the last guest appearances Tupac Shakur recorded before his death. Along the way, he worked with Bay Area luminaries like E-40 and Mac Dre; Dirty Southerners like Devin the Dude; and New Yorkers like Lloyd Banks. His work lately has drifted toward R&B, developing vocal talent like the singer London Savoy. In recent years, he’s taken on a day job as a supply technician at U.C.S.F. Medical Center, but he estimates about half of his income comes from licensing and publishing from his classic catalog, a fact he ascribes to his old-school, major-label paperwork and publishing rights. “All I can say is, producers, stop giving your stuff away for free because you devaluing the game,” he said. “Even if you just chuck it out on the internet, you still got to have the business part done if you want to eat.” Still, even Tone Capone is amazed at the evergreen success of what was already what he called his “top breadwinner.” “It’s been good to me,” he said. “‘5 on It’ blew up, and it’s blowing up again, which is crazy because it’s 24 years later.” If that’s what being a one-hit wonder means, he joked, “I’ll be a one-hit wonder.” "
5cacb50949f0eacbf1f81d89,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/09/arts/music/lil-nas-x-old-town-road.html,"A wealth of internet memes plus a viral controversy over race and the sanctity of country music have led to a distinctly 21st century No. 1 song: Lil Nas X’s “Old Town Road,” a sticky genre hybrid that has been the talk of social networks and the music industry alike for weeks. The track, which clocks in at only one minute and 53 seconds, dethroned “7 Rings” by Ariana Grande for the top spot on the industry-standard Hot 100 singles chart, Billboard announced on Monday night. The chart is determined by weighing a combination of digital streams, radio airplay and digital sales data in the United States. “Old Town Road” depended largely on streaming, totaling nearly 47 million plays — over 10 million more than its closest competitor — in the last week of chart eligibility, which ended Friday. The song was also downloaded 22,000 times and received an increase in radio play as it became a cause célèbre this month. Buzz began to grow when “Old Town Road,” which the Atlanta rapper Lil Nas X described as country-trap, arrived on three charts simultaneously: the Hot 100, Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot Country Songs. With silly lyrics delivered in an exaggerated drawl (“cowboy hat from Gucci/Wrangler on my booty”), the track had become an online sensation through memes on social apps like TikTok, where young people made short country-themed videos set to the song. But Billboard soon removed “Old Town Road” from the country chart, calling its initial inclusion a mistake because the song “does not embrace enough elements of today’s country music.” (The song’s beat samples an instrumental number by Nine Inch Nails, which includes a plucked banjo melody.) Many critics of the decision questioned whether race was a factor, and noted modern country’s frequent use of rapping and digital drum sounds from hip-hop. In a savvy chess move, Lil Nas X, who signed to Columbia Records amid the song’s rise, released a remix on Friday featuring the veteran country singer Billy Ray Cyrus, who argued for it to be embraced by the Nashville establishment. Billboard addressed its handling of the song in a statement on Friday, saying that the company would “continue to monitor how it is marketed and how fans respond.” It added: “Our initial decision to remove ‘Old Town Road’ from the Hot Country Songs chart could be revisited as these factors evolve.” (Because of its release date, numbers for the remix will be counted toward the position of “Old Town Road” on next week’s Billboard charts. On Tuesday, the rapper Young Thug also teased a remix.) For Lil Nas X, who turned 20 on Tuesday, the strange trip to No. 1 was well worth it. Regardless of any negativity, he posted on Twitter, “i’m going down in history.” "

5caf5cbc49f0eacbf1f82d24,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/us/nipsey-hussle-memorial-los-angeles.html,"LOS ANGELES — I keep coming back to Nipsey Hussle’s vigil — the thousands of candles, flowers and handwritten notes — left where the rapper and activist was shot and killed outside his clothing store in the city’s Hyde Park neighborhood on March 31. Every time I come back, I’m surrounded by a sea of black and brown faces and the sound of his music, which has now become the unofficial soundtrack of the city. The City of Los Angeles is in mourning.  The news came as a shock. It was Sunday around 4 p.m., and I was interviewing Randy Hook, a member of the Compton Cowboys — a group of 10 childhood friends who ride horses through Compton — when he put his phone down and said, “We lost Nipsey, man.” Then I began to receive text messages, 20 to be exact. I went on social media, and my fear was confirmed: We had, in fact, lost Nipsey. Part of the reason his death was so shocking was that I believed that, in some ways, he was invincible. He often rapped about death, but I believed that Nipsey had figured out a way to overcome the often brutal realities of Los Angeles street life. That was not the case.  Nipsey Hussle, born Ermias Joseph Asghedom, and I were the same age, 33, and briefly attended Hamilton High School together. At Hamilton, he was more committed to playing basketball than he was to rapping, but it’s almost no surprise that the rapper came out of that school. Prominent Los Angeles musicians like Syd from The Internet and Kamasi Washington, a jazz artist, also attended it. Nipsey and I never met, but we had mutual friends, and it always seemed as if I knew him. Maybe it was the sound of his voice — a blend of Southern drawl and laid-back West Coast popular here — or his style of clothing that felt like home. Maybe it was because we both grew up in the same era, both grew up going to the Fox Hills Mall on weekends, and both grew up shopping at the Slauson Swapmeet. Maybe it was because every time he spoke, I heard the city I grew up in: a community of black and brown people trying to combat daily bouts with hardship and loss with unyielding joy and love. The City of Los Angeles appreciated Nipsey for so many reasons: He was an activist who supported his community and gave back — without boasting about it on social media — in ways that continue to be revealed as each day passes. Nipsey unapologetically believed in Los Angeles and represented it at a time when so many of the people and landmarks that we grew up with have changed or have closed down. Every time he rapped about Crenshaw or Slauson Boulevard in a song, he preserved our memory of it, even as the city’s landscape changes and leaves many of us wondering what’s next.  Nipsey had his flaws. He made comments about masculinity that some said were homophobic. He acknowledged on “The Breakfast Club,” a popular radio show, that he still had a lot of growing up to do.  But at a time when so many residents of South L.A. are displaced, Nipsey reinvested a part of the money he made from music into the community that raised him. He was a co-founder of a space called Vector90, which was a ’hood version of WeWork, accessible to people in the community, with an emphasis in STEM for young people of color. He bought up the entire strip mall — the same one where he first sold music from the trunk of his car — that was home to his Marathon clothing store, a space invested in fostering a positive environment for the community. And he gave back generously to the 59th Street elementary school he attended as a child. We saw ourselves in Nipsey, because, in many ways, he was part of us. Some people have rightfully noted his past involvement with the Rollin’ 60s Crips, one of Los Angeles’s most notorious street gangs. Allowing that to define his legacy is not only reductive but is also missing the larger point: Like so many other black and brown youth from his community, Nipsey was shaped by forces far beyond his control. At some point, though, Nipsey recognized that being an active member of a gang wasn’t the only way to live. Music became an outlet for his thoughts and ideas about the world.  In many ways, Nipsey was a journalist like me. He wrote and documented the things he experienced and used vivid descriptions and rich metaphors. Songs like “Dedication,” “Blue Laces 2” and “Keys 2 the City” were autobiographical testimonies told through the lens of someone fighting both to preserve a memory and redefine the negative image of his life and community. Nobody could tell it better than he could; he was the expert in his own story. His story was ours, too.  When “Victory Lap,” his first studio album, was nominated for a Grammy this February, my friends and I felt as if we had just been nominated for one too. We were proud and hopeful, sharing text messages about our favorite songs the week the album came out. It felt like the beginning of Nipsey’s ascent into the upper echelon of mainstream success, after nearly 15 years of putting out some of our favorite mix tapes.  Some people are comparing his death with that of Tupac Shakur,the rapper who was reportedly killed by rival gang violence 23 years ago. The motive for Nipsey’s death is still pending. But some similarities are uncanny: Each one died by gun violence, loved his community, and showed wisdom far beyond his years. Since Nipsey’s death, the city has felt somber, deflated, even. In the end it was Nipsey’s unwavering commitment to frequent his community as an everyman — to stay connected to the “streets” — that felt like a double-edged sword. On one hand it’s why we loved him, he was accessible, he was humble and his energy was pure; but it was that very connection that, ultimately, led to his killing. And that’s what makes the loss of Nipsey so unbearable.  "

The man, Eric R. Holder Jr., 29, was arrested on Tuesday, two days after Nipsey Hussle was fatally shot while standing outside a store he owned in South Los Angeles with two other men. Prosecutors charged Mr. Holder with one count of murder, two counts of attempted murder and one count of possession of a firearm by a felon. If convicted, Mr. Holder would face a maximum sentence of life in prison. He pleaded not guilty to the charges at his arraignment on Thursday, a spokesman for the district attorney’s office said. Mr. Holder’s defense lawyer, Chris Darden, declined to comment. According to video evidence cited by the police, Mr. Holder walked up to Nipsey Hussle and the two men who were with him several times before leaving and returning with a handgun. He fired several times before fleeing in a white Chevy Cruze that was driven by an unidentified woman. The chief of the Los Angeles Police Department, Michel R. Moore, said at a news conference on Tuesday that investigators believed the shooting was rooted in a personal dispute between Nipsey Hussle and Mr. Holder. Chief Moore said that Mr. Holder was believed to be a member of a gang, but that the police did not think the shooting was related to gang rivalries. The death of Nipsey Hussle, who was born Ermias Joseph Asghedom, prompted grief and outrage by residents in the Crenshaw neighborhood, where the rapper grew up and maintained a regular presence even after he became a successful artist. His fans held deep appreciation for his financial investment in the community, which has long struggled with violent crime, and saw him as a symbol of hope and self-improvement. "

Mr. Holder was arrested later on Tuesday. [Read more about the suspect’s arrest.] Chief Moore also said that a stampede at a vigil for Nipsey Hussle on Monday night, in which more than a dozen people were injured, was the result of a panic stemming from a struggle over a handgun that was pulled out, but not fired, at the memorial. “We had a series of falls, trips and injuries from the glass and other materials that were there, and that was the vast majority of the injuries that we saw,” he said. Margaret Stewart, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles Fire Department, said Monday night that at least 19 people had been transported to hospitals, including two in critical condition and two in serious condition. One of the patients in critical condition was hit by a car. Another person was stabbed, Chief Moore said, and two women who arrived at a hospital with gunshot wounds said they were shot at the vigil after first reporting that they had been injured elsewhere. He added that while he was not questioning their account, a police commander at the vigil did not report hearing any gunfire. Hundreds of fans and supporters had gathered throughout the day outside Marathon Clothing, the store that Nipsey Hussle co-owned and outside of which he was shot, to pay tribute to the rapper, entrepreneur and community activist. [“He meant everything to the community”: Nipsey Hussle’s Crenshaw neighborhood was shaken by the shooting.] Nipsey Hussle, born Ermias Joseph Asghedom, was remembered by city officials on Tuesday as a gifted artist and passionate advocate for the South Los Angeles community in which he was raised. “He was working closely with the city to help save lives and transform lives, even as he was doing that for himself,” Mayor Eric Garcetti said at the news conference. “He was a tireless advocate for the young people of this city and of this world, to lift them up with the possibility of not being imprisoned by where you come from or past mistakes.” The rapper was scheduled to meet on Monday afternoon with representatives from Roc Nation, Jay-Z’s entertainment company, and police officials to discuss how the community could support efforts to stop gang violence and help children in the area. His death was felt particularly deeply in Crenshaw, the neighborhood he grew up in and rapped about and where he maintained a regular presence. His fans said he offered hope, advocated self-improvement and financially invested in the community, which has long struggled with violent crime. He opened a co-working space dedicated to increasing diversity in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, and helped to promote black arts and culture. His debut studio album, “Victory Lap,” was nominated for best rap album at the Grammys last year and debuted at No. 4 on the Billboard chart. He was in a relationship with the actress and model Lauren London and had two children, Kross and Emani. “I am completely lost,” Ms. London wrote in an Instagram post on Tuesday evening. “I’ve lost my best friend.” "
5cb0e0fb49f0eacbf1f837c6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/12/opinion/nipsey-hussle.html,"“How you die 30-something after banging all them years?” Nipsey Hussle posed that question about a fallen colleague on a song released about a month before he met a similar fate. After his friend died, the ex-gangbanger Hussle said he took to the “sauna sheddin’ tears/All this money, power, fame and I can’t make you reappear.”  Nor can Hussle’s fans make him reappear. On March 31, the rapper and activist was shot to death outside his clothing store in Los Angeles. Yet he is more present in the culture than he has ever been. How does a rapper who was just coming into his own fill the Staples Center for his funeral and cast a spell over a society that barely knew his name the day he died? One reason Hussle’s death struck a collective nerve is because his story fit into competing narratives across an ideological spectrum. Pull yourself up by your bootstraps? Hussle believed in hard work and black uplift and self-reliance, and started several businesses in the hood. Fight the powers that be? Hussle joined fellow rapper YG on an indictment of Donald Trump: “I’m from a place where you prolly can’t go/Speakin’ for some people that you prolly ain’t know.” But the main reason his story is so compelling is because love was at the core of his beliefs and behavior. Love of his craft. Love of his blackness. Love of his neighborhood. Love of his partner, the actress Lauren London, and their kids. And, belatedly, across the nation, in vigils and outpourings of unashamed adoration, we show our love of him for loving so faithfully while few of us paid attention. His death is even more haunting because the love he showed took place against the backdrop of unsettling violence, both real and imagined, both in structural forces and intimate spaces, often conjured or measured by his own pen. Hussle captured both his métier and his pedigree when he dubbed himself the “2Pac of my generation,” a cleareyed if fatal prophecy. There are certainly differences. Tupac’s resonant baritone, steeped in the sonic registers of the East and West Coasts where he came of age, echoed eerily across the culture and gained him global fame before death made him a transcendent icon. Hussle’s voice drawled in a Southern cadence inflected with California bravado that produced a Louisiangeles accent. Death amplified a sound that has only now been heard for the first time in many quarters. Both Tupac and Hussle were transformed in death from hood griots to ghetto saints, from verbal magicians to generational martyrs. Hussle loved and embraced his blackness, a blackness that was bigger than the sum of its intriguing parts. He was every bit the unapologetic patron of Slauson, Crenshaw and South Central Los Angeles. But he also embraced his East African roots in his father’s homeland of Eritrea when he was 18. Hussle, his brother and his father made another pilgrimage to Eritrea in 2018 that gave him renewed inspiration for his reverse-gentrification Husslenomics: Own your master recordings, master your own entrepreneurial terrain, recycle capital in the hood by reinvesting earnings back into the people who inspired your art.  Hussle also embodied the trans-Atlantic routes of black identity — the crisscrossing and crosscutting ways of global blackness and the awareness that no one culture or country or tribe has ownership of a blissfully variegated blackness. It was that sense of blackness that linked a scholar like me and a rapper like him when we shared a six-hour flight last year from Los Angeles to New York.  “Are you Michael Eric Dyson?” he asked as he slid into the seat next to me. “I read your books.” “Yes, sir. Are you Nipsey Hussle?” I replied as I showed him that I had downloaded his latest album on my smartphone. “I listen to your music.” We both smiled. We had an epic conversation and talked about the psychologist Abraham Maslow, whom he brought up. We discussed Hussle’s journey from gangbanging to hip hop, but especially our unblushing love for black culture.  Hussle’s murder reveals a darker side of blackness: The revelation that the man charged in his murder is named Eric Holder is an unavoidable metaphor of the destructive doppelgänger that often lurks in black life. That for all the effort to do well and to be right, there are opposing forces that seek to subvert, distract and destroy. Hussle was a more delightful doppelgänger, borrowing his nom de plume from Nipsey Russell, the black comedian known as the “poet laureate of television” whose comedy reveled in aphorism and rhymes. Each day since Hussle’s death, more of his words surface like Dead Sea Scrolls and shed light on the secular scriptures he spat in rhyme. His death at 33 inevitably suggests the arc of resurrection, or at least a biblical reckoning with his time on earth. “I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith,” another marathon runner said. Or as Hussle said, “Hopin’ as you walk across the sand, you see my shoe print/And you follow til it change your life, it’s all an evolution.” Michael Eric Dyson (@MichaelEDyson) is the author of “What Truth Sounds Like: Robert F.

5c5489513a125f5075c07991,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/01/nyregion/tekashi-69-pleads-guilty.html,"[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] The rapper and Instagram star known as Tekashi 6ix9ine has pleaded guilty to charges stemming from his role in a violent drug-trafficking gang and was cooperating with federal prosecutors, according to newly unsealed court records. The rapper, whose legal name is Daniel Hernandez, admitted at a federal court hearing in Manhattan on Jan. 23 to being a member of the Nine Trey Gangsta Bloods, and said he had helped other gang members rob people at gunpoint. In one case, he said, “I helped members of Nine Trey attempt to kill a rival gang member.” Mr. Hernandez added, “I did this to maintain or increase my own standing in Nine Trey.” He also said the gang engaged in “shooting at people, robbing people and, at times, drug trafficking.” Mr. Hernandez said he apologized to the judge and “to anyone who was hurt, to my family, friends and fans for what I have done and who I have let down.” Mr. Hernandez remained incarcerated, and it was unclear Friday when he will be sentenced or how his cooperation might affect his prison sentence. At the plea hearing, a prosecutor said that Mr. Hernandez’s cooperation was likely to reveal the criminal activities of other people and that he may eventually need to be placed in the witness protection program. Mr. Hernandez, 22, was charged in November along with several other alleged members and associates of the Nine Trey gang on racketeering conspiracy and firearms charges, a federal indictment shows. The gang “wreaked havoc on New York City, engaging in brazen acts of violence,” Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, said when charges were announced. In one case last April, prosecutors said, the gang’s members held up a rival gang member at gunpoint near Times Square. Mr. Hernandez helped to plan and direct the robbery, and filmed it from a car, prosecutors said. Later that month, the government said, a member of the gang shot at a rival inside Barclays Center, where Mr. Hernandez was scheduled to perform. Though no one was hit, he later posted a video of himself and co-defendants bragging about the shooting, the prosecutors said. At the time, Lance Lazzaro, a lawyer for Mr. Hernandez, pronounced him “completely innocent” of the charges, portraying him as a victim and noting that the F.B.I. had warned his client of threats made against him. On Friday, Dawn M. Florio, another of Mr. Hernandez’s lawyers, declined to comment on his decision to plead guilty and cooperate, but added that “every effort” was being made “to protect him and his family and his loved ones, for their safety.” Prosecutors declined to comment on the case. In court last week, Mr. Hernandez pleaded guilty to racketeering conspiracy and eight other charges, for which he could face a minimum of 47 years in prison and a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. If he cooperates successfully, the government has agreed to write to the judge, seeking a sentence below the minimum, a prosecutor said. Mr. Hernandez has spent the better part of his adult life crafting a viral internet personality. His brash stunts — which included dying his hair rainbow colors and wearing clothing emblazoned with obscenities — made him a near-instant superstar on Instagram and other platforms. [Read more about the rapid rise and sudden fall of Tekashi 6ix9ine.] But his meteoric career trajectory as a rapper was unusual. Mr. Hernandez only began pivoting to music after he had become well-known on the internet for his obnoxious antics. He appears to have sought gang affiliation to bolster his credibility among some hip-hop fans. Judge Paul A. Engelmayer ordered the transcript and other records of Mr. Hernandez’s guilty plea temporarily sealed after a prosecutor cited several pending arrests and “safety concerns” with respect to Mr. Hernandez and his family. His plea and cooperation deal may help him obtain a reduced sentence, but it could also be the end of his rap alter ego. Cooperating with the police or federal investigators can be risky in a rap genre that has historically pitted itself against law enforcement, and for him, the stakes may even be higher. For years, his star power stemmed from cultivating a public persona as an outlaw, a self-described “supervillain.” A formal cooperation deal with the authorities undercuts that persona, and he now risks being labeled a “snitch.” "
5c9b93a049f0eacbf105f52d,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/27/business/china-war-on-fun-earrings-tattoos.html,"China is waging a war on fun. The latest target: men’s earrings. Chinese censors in recent months have blurred the earlobes of some of China’s young male pop stars in television and internet appearances, lest their piercings and jewelry set too feminine an example for the country’s boys. The ban elicited eye rolls and even some jokes, but it illustrated the Communist Party’s creeping interference in even the smallest details of Chinese life. Men’s earrings aren’t the only objectionable material that China’s censors are blurring, covering up or cutting out. Soccer players wear long sleeves to cover their tattoos. Women in costumes at a racy video game convention have been told to raise their necklines. Rappers can rhyme only about peace and harmony. This sanitizing infuriates Rae Fan, a 22-year-old college student in southern China’s Guangxi region. Some of her favorite American and South Korean movies have disappeared from local streaming platforms. To make matters worse, her friends appear indifferent to it and won’t welcome anything that smacks of criticism of the government. Her parents, both civil servants, told her that she would be better off not watching those movies anyway. In other words, the censorship is working. “The purpose of this kind of control is to ensure everybody shares the mainstream values,” Ms. Fan said. “We will be easier to manage.” The Communist Party’s effort to instill what it calls “core socialist values” — patriotism, harmony and civility, among others — is intensifying. Content that celebrates money worship, hedonism or individualism is increasingly removed. Material that was acceptable only a few years ago no longer passes muster.  In a few years’ time, today’s youths will have seen less unfiltered content than people even five years older. Without knowing what they don’t know, they’re likely to be more receptive to party doctrine and easier to govern. “To cultivate a new generation that will shoulder the responsibility of national rejuvenation, we need to resist erosion from indecent culture,” the official Xinhua News Agency wrote in a 2018 commentary that criticized those it called China’s effeminate young male idols. “More important, we need to nurture outstanding culture.”  Like the internet elsewhere, China’s online community can truck in crude or inflammatory content. China’s toughness may sound appealing to some Americans frustrated by what Facebook, Twitter or YouTube allow.  But China takes that attitude to such an extreme that it risks infantilizing the country’s culture. It lacks content-rating systems — like the American industry group that labels movies PG or R, for example — so everything has to be suitable for a 12-year-old to consume.  The sex has been edited out of the local streaming of “Game of Thrones,” rendering the plots that are often explained through “sexposition” nonsensical. The Chinese film industry put a black dress on Sally Hawkins’s nude body when “The Shape of Water” hit theaters there. It cut the most brutal scenes out of the climactic battle between Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy in “The Revenant,” as well the brief nudity and gay content in “Green Book.” Censorship isn’t new. For a time, the Communist Party’s conservative faction conducted a campaign against spiritual pollution. When I was growing up in China in the 1980s, the Communist Party disliked pop music, flared pants, permed hair, love stories and even kissing. The first movie kiss in modern China didn’t take place until 1980. Still, Chinese viewers won more freedom of expression here and there over the next four decades. That’s why, to some Chinese people of my generation, the new crackdown on entertainment is alarming, even if the targets are sometimes lowbrow or coarse.  Two years ago, broadcasters and streamers began blurring tattoos. A detective show covered blood and bodies with blurs. Last year, male ponytails got the blur treatment. There’s so much blurring on the Chinese internet that there’s a term for it: “heavily applied mosaics.”  “If a male entertainer who chose to dye his hair and sport tattoos, earrings, a long ponytail … appears on a variety show, what will be left on the screen?” asked an entertainment blog named No. 3 Theater Inspector. Two years ago, the blog noted, that entertainer would have been considered normal.  The entertainment industry has no choice but to go along. Last year, regulators shut down over 6,000 websites and over two million online accounts and social media groups. When one short video app, Miaopai, was shut down and then reinstated, the founder promised to shake up the app by adhering to core socialist values and creating positive content, according to an internal letter that was published in Chinese media. The stark loss of edge of China’s first hip-hop show, “The Rap of China,” offers another cautionary tale. It was by no means critical of society or current affairs. Still, rappers dissed one another and argued with the judges in its first season in 2017, giving Chinese viewers a glimpse of the swagger and rebelliousness of hip-hop.  Then came the crackdown. A co-champion of the show, Wang Hao, who raps under the name PG One, apologized last year after accusations from the state media and the Communist Party Youth League that lyrics in one of his older tracks encouraged drug use. When entertainment blogs accused him of having a relationship with a married actress, streaming services pulled his music. When the second season of “The Rap of China” aired, the tone of the show changed. The contestants rapped about love, dreams and family. IQiyi, the video platform that produced the show, changed the name to “China’s New Rap,” explaining that the new name nodded to a new era for China.  To Lippi Zhao, an engineer and a fan of hip-hop music in the city of Xi’an, the second season was both lame and ironic. Both finalists that season were Uighurs, a predominantly Muslim ethnic group living in the Chinese region of Xinjiang. The authorities there have forced as many as one million Muslims, most of them Uighurs, into detention camps. “The Rap of China” didn’t touch the subject.  “They had to know what their own people were going through,” Mr. Zhao said. “But they had to do everything to avoid the elephant in the room while competing in the show.” Chinese viewers seemed to miss the energy of the first season. On Douban, China’s most authoritative website for entertainment ratings, viewers began giving the show lower scores. IQiyi declined to comment.  Artists are self-censoring to protect themselves. Mr. Zhao, the engineer, said some underground rappers he followed had pulled some of their potentially controversial tracks from streaming platforms for fear that they would be barred from performing live.  He alerted me this month that “Underground 8 Miles,” one of China’s most famous hip-hop contests, had been canceled. The spokesman for the contest apologized to over 3,000 participants in a video and explained that the authorities believed that some of its content would have a negative impact on young people. The retreat in freedom of expression in entertainment and culture spheres is shocking to many Chinese from previous generations. Liang Wendao, a writer in Hong Kong, wrote in an article that he had never imagined that Chinese people in the modern era would still confront the gaps in culture and arts that they faced decades ago.  “When faced with all of these,” he wrote, “we can only sigh in despair.” "
5caf027249f0eacbf1f82a17,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/us/nipsey-funeral.html,"LOS ANGELES — Thousands of mourners are expected to gather in downtown Los Angeles on Thursday to honor the life of Nipsey Hussle, the Grammy-nominated rapper who was fatally shot last month and whose success and commitment to redeveloping South Los Angeles made him a local hero. The funeral, billed as a “celebration of life,” will be held at the Staples Center. All tickets for the event, which were free, were claimed online within minutes of being made available earlier this week. The arena’s capacity is 21,000. Tens of thousands of fans are expected to gather around the venue, where a public memorial for Michael Jackson was hosted in 2009. The two-hour service will begin at 10 a.m. local time and will be followed by a procession from the Staples Center through South Los Angeles. Hussle, born Ermias Joseph Asghedom, channeled his upbringing and adolescence as a gang member into music that spoke powerfully to many who live in Los Angeles’ most vulnerable neighborhoods. As his star rose in recent years, Hussle brought investments and attention back to the area, earning the adoration of his neighbors and fans. Though he developed a following far beyond Southern California, his death last week struck a particularly painful chord among residents of the Crenshaw District, where he grew up. His clothing store on Slauson Avenue in South Los Angeles, The Marathon Clothing, had become a potent symbol of local success and black entrepreneurship, a theme he addressed regularly in his music. His fans clung to lyrics that melded familiar rap bombast with exaltations about self-discipline and long-term financial planning, a break from a music culture that often emphasizes flashy spending. The store transformed into a makeshift memorial on March 31 after Hussle was gunned down there over a “personal dispute,” according to the Los Angeles Police Department. The suspect, Eric Holder, was apprehended by authorities two days after the shooting. For days outside the store, fans prayed, lit candles and left hand-written letters addressed to Hussle. One of the mourners was Candace Cosey, 32, who remembers him as Ermias from their time attending Hamilton High School together in the early 2000s, a magnet school on the West Side of Los Angeles. She recalled how Hussle would sell mix CDs to her and others at school, and how he later started selling music in the neighborhood out of his trunk. She came close to tears as she pulled out a picture of him from the high school yearbook. “If you grew up here, you either knew him directly or you knew someone who knew him,” she said. Even as his career took off, Hussle remained approachable and “big hearted,” she said. As he amassed fame and wealth, he continued living modestly while making investments in businesses in the neighborhood. And he could be very generous. When a colleague passed away several years ago, Ms. Cosey approached Hussle’s team to see if he could help with the funeral expenses. He contributed several thousand dollars, she said. “He was about uplifting us. He hired people from the neighborhood who wouldn’t have had a job otherwise. He took care of so many people, and he invested in what he believed in, here, because he grew up here,” she said. “We have to keep that work going. It’s what he was about.” [Read more about the community’s reaction to Hussle’s death.] Hussle’s death has drawn attention far beyond the Crenshaw District. Celebrities and political leaders across the country have offered their condolences to Hussle’s family and friends. In an interview last week, Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles praised Hussle’s contributions to South Los Angeles, a community that he acknowledged has been historically overlooked by the city’s political establishment. Mr. Garcetti said Hussle embodied the very idea of black entrepreneurship, a critical component of lifting the community and its residents. “He represented redemption and hope. He had come from the world of gangs and gotten out,” he said. “This is a devastating shock to the stomach. He was really ambitious — he wanted to get African Americans into tech, on top of his music game, on top of his businesses.” “Then to be killed in such a clichéd way, by guns, for a beef in South L.A., it feeds into too many stereotypes,” he said. Velma Sanders, 60, said she did not listen to Hussle’s music but, as a lifelong resident of South Los Angeles, she felt pride watching his career grow in recent years. His presence, she said, was felt by everyone. “He would be out here. He showed you that he didn’t fear where he grew up. He was proud of it,” she said. “He was building up this community, giving back to this community. He took that money and instead of buying something luxurious, a big home or whatever, he put it back in his community so these would not be vacant buildings. It’s just beautiful.” [Read an assessment of Hussle’s music and its place in hip-hop.] Manuel Pastor, a professor of American studies and ethnicity at the University of Southern California who has researched the demographics and culture of South Los Angeles, said Hussle’s killing “felt like a kick in the stomach.” He described Hussle as “a hometown guy lifting up his hometown.” Nothing illustrated this more, he said, than when Hussle and his girlfriend, the actress Lauren London, posed for a photo shoot in GQ in February at locations around South Los Angeles — not Hollywood, not downtown Los Angeles, not New York. “This really hit hard. This was a hometown guy who stayed home,” said Mr. Pastor. Mr. Pastor said Hussle had left the gang life but never rejected the culture of the community. Alienation and the search for identity amid violence and poverty often feed into gang culture, something Hussle spoke about openly. “He did what many people ask of black celebrities, to come back to their community,” said Najee Ali, an activist in South Los Angeles who knew Hussle. He said the community is accustomed to feeling left behind when one of its own makes it big and finds fame. “They all leave,” he said. “Hussle was the only one to stay in the community. He believed in the slogan, ‘Don’t move, improve.’ That’s what made him special.” Hasani Leffall, 35, who knew Hussle, once worked for the rapper’s stepfather at a South Los Angeles restaurant called Bayou Grille. To emphasize the depth of feeling over Hussle’s murder within the black community of Los Angeles, he mentioned the murders of Tupac, Biggie Smalls, even Malcolm X and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Even with his fame, money and the support of the community, Hussle couldn’t escape the violence of the streets he rapped about. Mr. Holder, the suspect in the killing, is an aspiring rapper who knew Hussle when he was younger. Mr. Holder, Mr. Leffall said, “represents a dark side about L.A., and a dark side about just men in L.A., in Crip life. There’s always somebody that just doesn’t like you, doesn’t like the fact that people love you.” "

Khalid, who was nominated for five Grammys last year, including best new artist, reached No. 1 on Billboard’s album chart for the first time with his second album, “Free Spirit” (Right Hand Music Group/RCA). It sold 85,000 copies as a full album in the United States — helped by a bundling deal that included it with the cost of concert tickets — but also performed well on streaming services, with 147 million streams last week, according to Nielsen. That added up to the equivalent of 202,000 album sales. Eilish, the 17-year-old singer and songwriter who made a splash on last week’s chart, was bumped to No. 2 with “When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?,” and Nipsey Hussle’s year-old “Victory Lap,” which re-entered the chart last week after the rapper was killed at age 33, fell one spot to No. 3. Also this week, Ariana Grande’s “Thank U, Next” is in fourth place, Juice WRLD’s “Death Race for Love” holds at No. 5, and Sara Bareilles’s “Amidst the Chaos” opens at No. 6. Lil Nas X’s song “Old Town Road” holds at No. 1 on Billboard’s Hot 100 pop singles chart, with record-setting streaming numbers. The track, which now includes Billy Ray Cyrus in a remix version, was streamed 142 million times in the United States last week, according to Nielsen. That easily beat the 116 million streams Drake had for “In My Feelings” last July, and it is also nearly four times as many as the No. 2 song on this week’s chart, “Sunflower” by Post Malone and Swae Lee, which had 36.5 million. But “Old Town Road” is still not on Billboard’s Hot Country Songs list, after being removed last month for being insufficiently country. One big reason: The song is largely being ignored by mainstream country radio stations, although it is on many country-themed playlists on streaming services. "
5c3bd0eb3a125f5075c0432a,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/13/arts/music/super-bowl-halftime-maroon-5-travis-scott-big-boi.html,"The N.F.L. on Sunday ended months of uncertainty by officially announcing Maroon 5 and the rappers Travis Scott and Big Boi as the lineup for this year’s Super Bowl halftime show. In an indication of how fraught the debate around the high-profile performance has become, Scott released a statement on Sunday announcing that he and the N.F.L. will partner on a $500,000 donation to the social justice group Dream Corps — a move that seemed to be aimed at stemming a backlash from groups that have criticized the football league’s policies. Sources familiar with the N.F.L.’s Super Bowl plans had confirmed the rock band Maroon 5 as the headliner as long ago as September, and Scott emerged last month as a reported addition to the Feb. 3 halftime performance at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta. Big Boi, the newest name on the bill, is a member of the Atlanta rap group Outkast. But the run-up to this year’s halftime announcement had turned into a skirmish over sports and politics, as artists and others criticized the N.F.L. over its treatment of Colin Kaepernick and other players who have taken a knee during the national anthem in protest of racial injustice. In February, the rapper Cardi B, who was featured on Maroon 5’s hit “Girls Like You” last year, told the celebrity news website TMZ that she would consider performing at a halftime show “when they hire Colin Kaepernick back.” In a song released last June, Jay-Z rapped, “I said no to the Super Bowl, you need me, I don’t need you.” Scott’s involvement, specifically, has prompted criticism from some. In an interview with TMZ, the Rev. Al Sharpton said he thought Scott “should do what a lot of other major artists have done — say, ‘I’m not going to participate.’” “You can’t fight against Jim Crow and then go sit in the back of the bus,” he added. In a pair of tweets, the rapper Meek Mill responded to the news that Scott would be performing with, “For what????” and “He don’t need that he on fire already!” And Gerald Griggs, first vice president of the Atlanta chapter of the N.A.A.C.P., told The Guardian that the chapter had contacted artists and asked them not to perform. “The majority of artists we’ve reached out to are standing in solidarity against the N.F.L.,” Griggs said. “They do not want to be associated because of the protest that was started by Mr. Kaepernick against racial injustice and police brutality.” For his part, Van Jones, the president of Dream Corps and a founder of the group, celebrated the announcement in a post on Twitter, addressing Scott by his handle. “This is great news!” Jones wrote. “Welcome, @trvisXX. Glad to have you with us, brother!” "
5ca78c2b49f0eacbf1f81370,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/05/business/media/lil-nas-x-billy-ray-cyrus-billboard.html,"Booming beats. A twanging banjo. Is this country music? When Lil Nas X, a young black hip-hop artist from Atlanta, created the surprise hit “Old Town Road,” he did not imagine that it would end up at the center of a debate on race, the Nashville establishment and musical genres. The track marries a beat familiar to hip-hop fans with acoustic sounds and lyrics filled with cowboy imagery. Lil Nas X had no record deal when he made it, and the song bubbled up on the internet before it made three different Billboard charts: the Hot 100, Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot Country Songs. Once it was a success, Billboard removed it from its country chart. On Friday, in what seemed to be a dare to Billboard and Nashville, Lil Nas X released a new version of the song that included the 1990s country star Billy Ray Cyrus as a featured vocalist. Was it country enough for them now? When Billboard banished “Old Town Road” from the country chart, it issued a statement to Rolling Stone claiming the song “does not embrace enough elements of today’s country music to chart in its current version.” With Mr. Cyrus along for the ride, it is possible that country radio stations who ignored it will start playing it. [Listen: Lil Nas X and the long history of country-rap.] Billboard’s decision to drop the song from Hot Country Songs prompted a debate about race and country music itself. White Nashville artists, like Florida Georgia Line and Sam Hunt, have used hip-hop-influenced beats and production techniques for years. Do those performers have more leeway than Lil Nas X? Shane Morris, a former record label executive in Nashville, thinks so. “They said there were compositional problems,” Mr. Morris said of Billboard’s chartmakers, “because they didn’t know how to justify it any other way without sounding completely racist.” Charles Hughes, the director of the Lynne & Henry Turley Memphis Center at Rhodes College, called Billboard’s decision “a bad move,” saying it perpetuated a longstanding racial tension in black music. “Black artists have been influential in country a long, long way back,” Mr. Hughes said, “but country has rewarded white artists that have taken advantage of those influences, without giving black artists the same opportunities.” The rejection of “Old Town Road” by the country establishment, in Mr. Hughes’s view, echoed a time when country radio stations ignored Ray Charles’s groundbreaking 1962 album, “Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music.” Lil Nas X, whose real name is Montero Hill, said he wrote “Old Town Road” last fall, after staying with his sister while avoiding his parents as a college dropout. When his sister finally sent him on his way, he imagined his future. “I felt like a loner cowboy,” he said. “I wanted to take my horse to the Old Town Road and run away. The horse is like a car. The Old Town Road, it’s like a path to success. In the first verse, I pack up, ready to go.” He posted the song online in December along with an observation: “country music is evolving.” It soon became a sensation on TikTok, an app that allows users to make and share short music videos. Young people made video shorts of themselves dressing up in cowboy gear, using the song as a soundtrack. By March, Lil Nas X had nailed down the deal with Columbia. In an interview on Friday, he sidestepped questions about being dropped from the country chart. “I’m still in Billboard — this is amazing,” he said. This week, the song climbed 17 spots, to No. 15, on Billboard’s Hot 100, which measures the popularity of pop songs. The blending of country music and black American forms is certainly nothing new. The white guitarist Jimmie Rodgers, whom many consider the father of country music, built the genre on a foundation of the blues in the 1920s. Ray Charles’s innovations in the early 1960s paved the way for the Nashville success of another black artist, Charley Pride. More recently, Darius Rucker, of the rock band Hootie and the Blowfish, had a No. 1 country hit with “Don’t Think I Don’t Think About It.” Last year, Jimmie Allen, a black performer from Delaware, made Billboard’s country top 10 with his debut single, “Best Shot.” Another African-American singer, Kane Brown, had two No. 1 hits on Billboard’s country chart, one in 2017 and one in 2018. In a statement, Billboard said that its chart decisions were determined by factors including the promotion of a song and its reception at radio and on streaming services, and that it could revisit its decision about “Old Town Road.” So far, the song has gotten little support from country stations. Last week, it was played five times on country stations, according to Nielsen; this week, it was played 62 times by 31 stations. The remixed version of “Old Town Road,” with vocals from Mr. Cyrus, the singer of the 1992 hit “Achy Breaky Heart,” came together two weeks ago, Lil Nas X said. The finishing touches were added on Thursday night, hours before it was released and went viral all over again. The rapper’s collaboration with Mr. Cyrus, the father of the singer Miley Cyrus, may seem unlikely, but Lil Nas X said he had been a fan for years. In December, two days after the song’s initial release, he posted a message on Twitter asking for Mr. Cyrus to join him on the track: “twitter please help me get billy ray cyrus on this.” While the addition of Mr. Cyrus may help the song’s chances on country stations and country charts, the new version makes no substantial change to its core. Mr. Cyrus defended the country bona fides of the original version of “Old Town Road” on Wednesday, adding to the pressure on Billboard and the Nashville establishment by casting Lil Nas X in the role of a beloved country music archetype — the outlaw. “When I got thrown off the charts,” Mr. Cyrus wrote on Twitter, “Waylon Jennings said to me ‘Take this as a compliment’ means you’re doing something great! Only Outlaws are outlawed. Welcome to the club!” "

Driven by steady streams, the album moved a total of 47,000 equivalent units, according to Nielsen Music, combining 68 million digital on-demand song plays and just 398 in traditional sales — a record low in sales for a No. 1 album, beating its own bottom-water mark of 823 from last month. (Neither of the album’s trips to No. 1 in January came during its debut week on the Billboard 200, a rarity on today’s charts.) “I Am > I Was,” the former chart-topper by the Atlanta rapper 21 Savage, climbed back to No. 2 from No. 8, following his arrest on Super Bowl Sunday by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. 21 Savage, whose album added another 40,000 units — with just 839 in sales — in its seventh week out, remains in ICE custody and is facing potential deportation proceedings because the government says he is in the United States illegally. Future’s “The Wizrd,” another recent No. 1, fell one spot to No. 3 this week, with 51 million streams and 1,600 in sales for a total of 40,000 units, while Travis Scott’s “Astroworld” is No. 4 in its 27th week on the chart. The soundtrack for “A Star Is Born,” another chart fixture in recent months, is No. 5 with 38,000 units as the film and album continue their path through awards season. Business should pick up next week: Ariana Grande, who has had two No. 1 hit songs so far this year, released “Thank U, Next,” her second album in six months last Friday, and is poised for another blockbuster debut. And then there’s the Grammys stimulus, which could lead to sales bumps for Sunday night’s stars, like Kacey Musgraves, Brandi Carlile, H.E.R. and Cardi B. Musgraves won album of the year for “Golden Hour,” which peaked at No. 4 last April. "
5c5480fb3a125f5075c0796e,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/01/arts/music/super-bowl-atlanta-rap-concert.html,"ATLANTA — “Welcome to Atlanta, out-of-towners!” the hip-hop carnival barker Lil Jon screamed to a full arena on Thursday night, as he baptized the Super Bowl weekend crowd with a torrent of regional hits. It was the halftime show that never could be — a charmingly slapdash, nearly five-hour profane parade of local heroes and of-the-moment aspirants that represented a specific place and point of view too hot for an audience north of 100 million. Though the annual mid-game concert, which lasts fewer than 15 minutes, is rarely tied to the Super Bowl’s location, this year’s choice of a headliner — the anodyne pop band Maroon 5 — has proved controversial on two fronts: First, for its lack of fealty to the host city’s constantly regenerating pool of black musical talent, and also because of reports that more au courant stars turned down the N.F.L. in solidarity with Colin Kaepernick. (The late addition of the rappers Travis Scott and Big Boi, of the Atlanta duo Outkast, did little to quell the consternation and head-scratching given the three acts’ obvious incongruity.) [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] Still, Atlanta has shown itself to be more than willing to make the most of the festivities. On Thursday, at the first night of the Super Bowl Music Fest at the State Farm Arena downtown, the city’s hip-hop royalty came together for a reverse-chronological survey of Atlanta music this century, from Lil Baby, 21 Savage and Migos to Ludacris, Jeezy and T.I. (The Music Fest concerts were scheduled to continue with more Super Bowl-esque lineups on Friday, with Post Malone and Aerosmith, and Saturday, featuring Bruno Mars and Cardi B.) Though the event was temporally and nominally linked to the N.F.L. — and came with a bevy of corporate sponsorships — football felt like an afterthought, and the crowd booed when periodic commercials for the league interrupted the music. Instead, the concert felt like the celebration of Atlanta that was unlikely to happen on Sunday. And it was part of a constellation of local events, many overseen by the Atlanta Super Bowl LIII Host Committee, that sought to highlight the city’s rich cultural past and present, including six nights of free, genre-spanning concerts at Centennial Olympic Park. (There were no shortage of unofficial parties, after-parties and after-after parties, as well, with many local artists packing multiple appearances into each night.) “I’m not going to say anything bad about Maroon 5 — I love Maroon 5,” said Maya Neguse, a 20-year-old student, as the concert began. “It’s just that they’re not lit enough for the Super Bowl.” Indeed, the arena was ready to move, responding with special enthusiasm to dance crazes that originated locally (“Swag Surfin,” “Crank That (Soulja Boy),” “Laffy Taffy”) and regional references. “If you went to Freaknik make some noise,” said Big Tigger, the night’s occasional M.C., at one point, referring to the storied black college spring break gathering. “If your mama went to Freaknik make some noise,” he added to much louder cheers, revealing the plethora of what he called “’90s babies” in the audience. The night’s performances also served as a genealogical chart for the local scene. Shorter sets from the current princes of Atlanta, like 21 Savage, Lil Yachty and Lil Baby, gave way to a fuller performance by their relative elders in Migos, who welcomed to the stage everyone’s godfather, Gucci Mane. (The most notable absences of the night were from the in-between micro-generation: Future and Young Thug.) Then came the foundational contingent — the artists who might actually be able to hold down a Super Bowl stage if Southern hip-hop could crystallize into classic rap, à la classic rock. Lil Jon, who went from crunk pioneer to EDM conqueror and is now 48, played both rapper and D.J., delivering his well-worn chants — “Get Low,” “Neva Eva (Get On My Level)” — and those of his contemporaries in Crime Mob, Ying Yang Twins and YoungBloodZ. Ludacris, the headliner, also stuck to greatest hits and demonstrations of local unity, beginning with the anthemic “Welcome to Atlanta” and a brief cameo by Jermaine Dupri. After running through the most recognizable parts of his catalog with a full band — the first of the night — Ludacris welcomed the concert’s only female performer, Ciara, who did her best to supply feminine energy with some two dozen backup dancers. From there, as the clock passed 1 a.m., Ludacris was joined by Jeezy (formerly Young Jeezy) and, eventually, T.I., for a brief foray into their proto-trap music. The three men, seemingly mellowed by age and success, stood shoulder to shoulder performing the 2005 song “Bang,” which warns outsiders to mind local Atlanta customs. “When you come this city, just know,” T.I. said as the track ended. “It’s us.” "

Long before the English-speaking pop mainstream took real notice, BTS were already global pop stars. The successes the K-pop outfit have had in this country happened largely without worrying about how it might or might not fit in. On its new release, “Map of the Soul: Persona,” it showcases its highest-profile collaborations to date in a way that preserves its core strengths. The shimmering “Boy With Luv” features Halsey — but more importantly, it features Halsey singing in Korean, exactly the sort of bilingual exchange that’s all too rare. And “Make It Right” is in part written by Ed Sheeran. It has some of his signature soft-soul gestures, but BTS renders them with complexity. The least comfortable collaborations are the ones in which the balance of power is wildly uneven, where one party badly needs something from the other. But all you hear on these songs is mutual respect. JON CARAMANICA The first new song in two years from Steve Lacy — who plays in the space-soul outfit the Internet and has collaborated with Blood Orange, Vampire Weekend and others — is a narcotically mellow inversion of casually strutting 1970s R&B. On the one hand, it’s about yearning, with Lacy’s vocals aquatically damp; but on the other, Lacy is far too at ease — far too chill — to really break a sweat. CARAMANICA “So Good” is elegantly rendered, built-by-hand disco from Omar Apollo, one of several strong songs from his impressive new EP, “Friends.” For the last two years, he’s been releasing songs that were sharp but felt tentative, as if he was worried about overstepping boundaries. But on “Friends,” he moves toward the upbeat and joyful, and sounds more free than ever. CARAMANICA Lead singers with Sounds of Blackness — Ann Nesby, Big Jim Wright and Lauren Evans — spill over one another with overlapping gospel praise in “Til I Found You,” the first single from a new collection by the producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis with various collaborators. The track is built on an easygoing beat and rippling guitar lines, but the singers turn it into an urgent competition to extol the comforts of faith. JON PARELES “I can make your dreams come true/if you let me listen in on you,” Yeasayer’s Anand Wilder sings, as if he’s Alexa or Siri or some present or near-future authoritarian state. That’s the sweet chorus; the verses are far more paranoid, with no more comfort to offer than, “Don’t look so guilty, you’ve got nothing to hide.” In a lilt with an electronic pulse — glancing back at the Cars — Yeasayer pinpoints where the promise of convenience meets the threat of constant surveillance. PARELES This exuberant romp about the upsides of getting rich quick is effective and fun, but it’s more intriguing for the performers it brings together, a union of singer-rappers of North African heritage: Geko, born in Manchester, England, is of Libyan and Algerian descent; Ay Em, from London, of Egyptian and Moroccan heritage; and French Montana, who grew up in the Bronx but was born in Morocco. Each has a particular take on the blurry line between rapping and melody. To be fair, French Montana mostly phones in his mumbles, but Geko and Ay Em make for a winning tag team. Geko, a strong rapper, sings with a light touch, and Ay Em provides aural and spiritual ballast: “I just did my prayer, then you know it’s back to business.” CARAMANICA In Courtney Barnett’s latest two-chord stomp — well, three in the chorus — she’s even blunter than usual about self-doubt and alienation: “I feel stupid, I feel useless, I feel insane,” she begins. But as she finds a defensive posture — “We’re gonna tell everyone it’s O.K.,” she sings with a laugh — the band cranks up, organ and tambourine pile on and voices join her for a rowdy singalong. She may be insecure and alienated, but she’s far from alone. PARELES With tolling chimes, a growly high-drama vocal, a minor-mode melody, a verse about death and an arena-scale drumbeat, “God’s Country” verges on goth metal, with only a little bit of slide guitar and devout lyrics to qualify it as country. It’s Blake Shelton’s latest paean to rural life, a song about hard-working, churchgoing farmers that’s not cozy and nostalgic, but grimly fatalistic. PARELES The guitarist Bill Frisell and the bassist Thomas Morgan released their first duets album two years ago, a collection of performances that smoldered like warm coals and bespoke an easygoing, simpatico new partnership. Now they’re back with “Epistrophy,” an entire album of covers. It closes with this rendition of “In the Wee Small Hours of the Morning,” honoring the old Sinatra ballad’s melancholy theme but still animated by Frisell’s ebullient warmth. And all the while there is Morgan’s virtuoso flexibility; he’s as responsive as he is grounded and firm. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO With Abrams, a veteran bassist affiliated with Chicago’s broad-minded experimental jazz community, it makes less sense to speak of tracks than to talk about stories. Each of the four lengthy performances on his new album with Natural Information Society unfolds slowly and consequentially, with a sense of abstract narrative. On the nearly 24-minute “In Memory’s Prism,” Abrams keeps the underlying bass line — played on the guembri, and indebted to North African music — almost unchanged while the harmony and instrumentation slowly shift above. (At various times, there’s harmonium and trumpet and autoharp and bass clarinet in there, to name a few.) It all has the implacable momentum of migration, or the feeling of a big new idea just coming into being. At the very least, it will put your mind in a place of peaceful wandering; by the end, you’re likely to wind up deep in your own imagination, remembering or inventing a story of your own. RUSSONELLO If this track is any indication, Josephine Wiggs’s solo album due May 17, “We Fall,” is a far cry from her stint as a founder and bassist in the Breeders. “Time Does Not Bring Relief” is a droney, Minimalist instrumental built on echoing piano figures, a major chord with a recurring dissonance, quiet glitchy sounds and fleeting appearances from string-section lines and a drumbeat. It’s meditative, while it hints at unresolved tensions. PARELES "

Offset’s marital troubles with Cardi B sent him to the celebrity doghouse, but he’s lately re-emerged in search of a public rebrand — devoted husband, committed father and newly introspective rapper. The title track of his solo album, “Father of 4,” is a plea for understanding directed toward his young children. He lists them off, explains how he’s done them wrong, then promises to do better. CARAMANICA The Haitian band Lakou Mizik, which was formed after Haiti’s catastrophic 2010 earthquake, has remade the New Orleans standard “Iko Iko,” a pop hit (for the Dixie Cups and others) based on half-understood Mardi Gras Indian chants that may have Haitian roots. Lakou Mizik added lyrics in Haitian Kreyol proclaiming the Haiti-New Orleans connection; the 79rs Gang, a Mardi Gras Indian alliance, sings the New Orleans chants. Hooting horns from Haiti’s rara carnival tradition mix with the Preservation Hall Jazz Band; there’s percussion from all sides and an earth-moving bass. Mardi Gras is March 5; the cultural cross-pollination, and the party, continue. PARELES The Oscars are Sunday, which means you only have a few days to absorb all the covers of “Shallow” from “A Star Is Born,” including this sharp late entry from Jimmie Allen and Abby Anderson, young country singers with R&B inclinations, who harness the song’s raw power and shellac it with a layer of controlled cool. CARAMANICA The music in “The Barrel” is folky and straightforward, circling through four chords fingerpicked on an acoustic guitar behind Aldous Harding’s demure voice. The words are the conundrum: cryptic, imagistic and distinctly wary of some undefined commitment: “Looks like a date is set/Show the ferret to the egg/I’m not getting led along.” And the video clip, with some surprises near the end, gives nothing away. PARELES On her new album, “Intuition: Songs from the Minds of Women,” the vocalist Alicia Olatuja chose a wide range of songs written by female artists — from Joni Mitchell to Angela Bofill to Imogen Heap — and set about making a new imprint on each. Her album-closing rendition of “This Woman’s Work,” by Kate Bush, features nothing but Olatuja’s luminous, classically trained voice overdubbed a handful of times, wound together in an airy, a cappella arrangement. Bush’s version was an intimate mash-up of ’80s pop and folk song and musical theater; Olatuja has found a way to honor what made it so distinctive, while creating a whole new sound. RUSSONELLO Michael Rother, the guitarist from the 1970s Krautrock trailblazers Neu! (and briefly before that, Kraftwerk), has collected a boxed set of his solo work, including previously unreleased tracks like this one from the score for the 2015 film “The Robbers.” It unfolds methodically, with an octave-bouncing line somewhere between bass riff and mantric melody; three-and-a-half minutes in, some clanking, chattering electronics arrive to give it precisely the lift it needs. PARELES The hypnosis continues. Gunna remains the most clever and intuitive rapper of the post-Young Thug generation, and on “Baby Birkin” — a standout from his new “Drip or Drown 2” — he circles again and again to a rhyme scheme that bleeds across the conventional bar structure, making the final syllable of each phrase into a de facto leadoff rhyme. The result is you never quite know if you’re coming or going, if the end is in front of you or just behind. It’s intoxicating. CARAMANICA Norah Jones has been collaborating widely lately, flexing genre boundaries; this track will be on an album collecting those experiments. “Just a Little Bit” leans toward jazz and Minimalism, with the meticulous Brian Blade on drums carrying a syncopated pulse as Jones sustains a drone on organ and ornaments it sporadically on piano. Her voice is approachable as always, but what she is singing is more confrontational. “I’m not the one you can refuse/I’m not your plaything, I’m not your muse.” Rightfully: This is not a time to take women for granted. PARELES One of the great disappointments of the tail end of the SoundCloud rap boom is how thoroughly its anarchic instincts have been all but wrung out of it. Sometimes, when you hear Lil Pump rap, he sounds like … a regular rapper. Which is fine, of course, if less fun. “Harverd Dropout” is his first full-length album, and while it features successful collaborations with Kanye West, Lil Uzi Vert, YG, 2 Chainz, Quavo and others, it’s most impressive when an awareness of the rest of the world is filtered out. Take “Vroom Vroom Vroom,” an agglomeration of interjections, sound effects, bass throbs and more, slapped atop each other chaotically. It’s exuberant fun, a return to the moment when what Lil Pump and others proposed was a new idea, a radical notion, an essential urge. CARAMANICA Contemplating the optimism of space travel and discord on Earth, Bruce Hornsby delivers a swinging, Minimalistic chamber-pop hoedown, an Aaron Copland-tinged romp with yMusic’s horns and strings ricocheting all around Hornsby’s percussive piano clusters. It’s genial and upbeat, but far from complacent. PARELES The tenor saxophonist Chris Potter, the drummer Eric Harland and the keyboardist James Francies lock into a big-boned, contemporary-jazz groove about a minute into “Hold It,” and you start to hear voices crowding the room. It’s almost all Potter, overdubbed on top of himself, before the dubs drop out and he launches into one of his characteristically herculean solos. This track is from “Circuits,” a new album announcing a fresh band, but one that harkens to the electrified, funk-fusion group Underground, which Potter led about a decade ago. Nowadays, jaw-dropping technical displays are the norm for Potter, but this band can still get something new out of him. RUSSONELLO This full-length song from Tierra Whack keeps things minimal, as she sings and raps over a two-bar, two-chord loop, plus or minus a drumbeat. In an assortment of voices, none of them all that perturbed, she severs her ties to a guy who’s selfish, stingy, dishonest, unfaithful and distracting her from her career. “I don’t wanna work it out,” she informs him, “so cancel our gym membership.” PARELES Here's the thought process behind a breakup, telescoped into five minutes by the three sisters in Teen. It's exposed at the start — a piano, a beat, a voice — with lyrics like “I don’t know why I still pretend that you could still be, maybe, my man.” Then, as details emerge about past conflicts and current letdowns, synthesizers join the chords and the sisters add harmonies to conclude, “I can’t pretend any more.” It's heartsick and triumphal at the same time. PARELES On his new album, “Preminger Plays Preminger,” the tenor saxophonist Noah Preminger honors his great-uncle, the director Otto Preminger, whose noir films were often known for their use of poignant, haunting music. (Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn famously scored “Anatomy of a Murder.”) With help from a stellar, acoustic-jazz quartet, Noah covers pieces from the old movies’ soundtracks, as well as some original compositions inspired by them. “For the Man with the Golden Arm” — an outtake left off the album, which was released on Friday to Newvelle Records subscribers — falls into the latter category; the saxophonist channels the circumspection and the longing of the 1955 film’s original soundtrack into a watery, wandering melody. Preminger overdubs multiple tenor saxophone parts, which paddle around each other and rest gently on Jason Moran’s rippling piano accompaniment. RUSSONELLO "
5caf94c949f0eacbf1f8307b,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/us/obama-nipsey-hussle-funeral.html,"Nipsey Hussle, the Grammy-nominated rapper, was remembered by a lineup of celebrities and respected figures at a funeral service on Thursday. Among them: the 44th president of the United States. In a letter read to mourners who had filled the Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles, President Barack Obama praised Hussle, 33, for overcoming the circumstances of his youth and becoming an advocate for South Los Angeles. “While most folks look at the Crenshaw neighborhood where he grew up and see only gangs, bullets and despair, Nipsey saw potential,” Mr. Obama said in the letter, read aloud by the hip-hop media personality Karen Civil. “He saw hope,” the letter continued. “He saw a community that, even through its flaws, taught him to always keep going.” Hussle, born Ermias Joseph Asghedom, was fatally shot outside his clothing store on March 31. Within days, the authorities arrested Eric R. Holder Jr., 29, the man suspected of shooting him. Mr. Holder has pleaded not guilty to the murder. [Read more about Nipsey Hussle’s funeral here.] In the letter, Mr. Obama said that he had learned about Hussle’s “transformation and his community work” after being introduced to the rapper’s music by his daughters, Sasha and Malia. Mr. Obama also praised him for giving back to his community, which Hussle did, in part, by opening the Marathon Clothing store and a co-working space in Crenshaw dedicated to increasing diversity in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Hussle “set an example for young people to follow,” Mr. Obama said, adding that his “is a legacy worthy of celebration.” “I hope his memory inspires more good work in Crenshaw and communities like it,” Mr. Obama said. Later in the service, Hussle’s family and friends shared memories of his love, curiosity, passion and drive. “He had such beautiful energy,” said his mother, Angelique Smith. “He’s intelligent, he’s radiant, he’s a superhero.” Ms. Smith also shared memories from Hussle’s childhood, relaying how he sprang to action when her car caught fire and fondly recalling his love of amusement park rides. Hussle’s brother, Samiel, remembered watching with amazement as Hussle built a computer when they were kids, and later started a music career and amassed friends left and right. Hussle’s partner, the actress Lauren London, described him as a “majestic” soul. “He was the strongest man that I ever knew, a gentle father, a patient leader, a divine light,” she said. The free tickets to the service, hosted in the 21,000-seat arena, were claimed online within minutes of being released earlier this week. The service began with Hussle’s own songs “Right Hand to God” and “Victory Lap,” the title track from his most recent album and major-label debut. Others who paid tribute to Hussle included Stevie Wonder, Snoop Dogg, and Louis Farrakhan, the leader of the Nation of Islam. "

Let us know at theplaylist@nytimes.com and sign up for our Louder newsletter, a once-a-week blast of our pop music coverage. A couple of months ago, Ariana Grande explained her new strategic philosophy to Billboard: “My dream has always been to be — obviously not a rapper, but, like, to put out music in the way that a rapper does.” Which is to say not on a traditional tightly-controlled pop star rollout, but in the drip-drip-drip fashion of the streaming era, in which artists bombard listeners with music in rapid succession, barely leaving room to reflect. And yet the period leading up to the release of “Thank U, Next,” Grande’s fifth album, which was released on Friday, hasn’t been quite that radical. There were singles, and videos, and now an album — nothing to fear here. The latest single is “Break Up With Your Girlfriend, I’m Bored,” a satisfying thumper with an astral-trap beat and Grande deciding that, in fact, she’d like to be the other kind of rapper as well. Not to say that she’s purely rapping on this song, but rather that rapping as an act has melted so thoroughly that the chasm between what it currently is and what Grande is doing here isn’t very vast. So much so that when she belts out a few lines near the song’s end it sounds like someone else altogether has arrived. (Grande spends the whole video stalking a couple made up of a handsome young man and a Grande doppelgänger. She keeps urging them to split, up until she inserts herself between them, and then she chooses … herself.) JON CARAMANICA “We don’t touch anymore/But we talk all the time so it’s fine,” sings Amber Bain, who records her solo, intricately produced pop as the Japanese House. She’s assessing the later stages of a romance: “Somebody tell me what I want/‘cause I keep on changing my mind.” She surrounds herself with synthesizers and vocal harmonies that can reflect the dizzying swirl of remembered infatuation or the steady trudge of everyday partnership; when the song ends, she still hasn’t figured things out. PARELES A path to solace is indirect and uncertain in “Noise,” the first release from the Brooklyn-rooted songwriter Zsela (whose father is Marc Anthony Thompson, a.k.a Chocolate Genius). Her voice is sumptuous and her phrasing is curvaceous and conversational in “Noise,” a hushed ballad that moves with the rhythm of breathing, not machines. Its backdrop subtly shifts from the sparsity of a lone electric piano to subdued orchestral instruments, and its chords start out unresolved and move in and out of hymnlike uplift, as she ponders the breakups of others and her own: “Cannot count the ways you used to love me,” she muses. “But I can count the ways you used to try.” JON PARELES How sensitive can a guy be? This sensitive. “Can’t we just talk/figure out where we’re going?,” Khalid pleads. There’s a tryst, with “flowers in the room,” but also a reckoning; whatever happens will have to be consensual. The loop has hi-hat sounds and syncopated synthesizers — from Disclosure — as Khalid hops between tenor and falsetto. The result of this negotiation isn’t guaranteed. PARELES Cool-kid pop made by the kids hiding out under the bleachers, “Homework” is a soothing, crypto-melancholy anthem about reflecting on young love. Kim Petras has a warmly synthetic voice, and lil aaron raps in a reassuring tone — together, they’re a sweet, effective pair, delivering teen-flick coming-of-age sparkle with little flickers of gone-too-far darkness. CARAMANICA This ghostly whisper of a waltz is from “Quiet Signs,” the new album by Jessica Pratt. Like the rest of the album, the backup is minimal — acoustic guitar picking, a few notes from a piano — and the production’s low-fi hiss makes Pratt’s soprano even wispier. She sings about singing in “Crossing,” with words dissolving into wordless syllables, turning into an elusive lullaby. PARELES The trumpeter Christian Scott aTunde Adjuah’s pieces often feel like something more than songs, or at least outside of them. They’re like a film composed only of long and powerful shots: The music starts intense and grows more so — comfortable at a steadfast medium tempo, not needing a lot of harmonic movement to swell and push onward. On “Ancestral Recall,” the title track from Scott’s forthcoming album, the focus is squarely on the drums and percussion, which maintain a rabbling, six-beat groove adorned by little more than a ghostly synthesizer and Scott’s scorching trumpet. Then there’s the poet Saul Williams, uttering lines that unpack the tune’s title: “Earth as my hard drive, sky as my witness/There’s no such thing as small spirits, ancestral minorities/Take breath through nature’s hidden forces.” GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO Bassekou Kouyate, from Mali, plays the ngoni, a West African lute that’s a likely ancestor of the banjo, and he leads Ngoni Ba, featuring ngonis of various sizes down to a bass ngoni. “Miri” (“Dream”), the title track of his new album, is an instrumental reverie based, the liner notes say, on worries about Mali’s Islamist insurgency and about climate change. Its fingerpicked vamp carries insistent minor-key melodies and a little bit of ngoni shredding. PARELES A New Orleans jazz band — clarinet, trombone, her own banjo — backs Leyla McCalla in the title song of her new album. The wryly old-fashioned slow-drag setting belies the hardheaded economic realism of “The Capitalist Blues,” a theme statement for an album full of songs about trying to get by in a ruthlessly market-based world. “I am swimming in an ocean of sharks,” McCalla sings, graceful but resigned. PARELES More cheerily melodic tragedy from the Savannah, Ga., rapper Quando Rondo, who is signed to the imprint of the Baton Rouge realist YoungBoy Never Broke Again. In its production, “Gun Powder” has some of the lighthearted toughness of the early T.I./Young Jeezy era, but the real amusement is in how Quando Rondo almost smirk-shrugs his way through some very bitter words: “Send a text to all the opps like, yeah, we want all the smoke/We up by 6, they down by 2, they need to go fix the scope.” CARAMANICA Miho Hazama, a Japanese-born, classically trained composer, is starting to make waves in New York. On Friday she released “Dancer in Nowhere,” her latest album with m_unit, an ensemble combining typical elements of a jazz big band with strings, vibraphone and French horn. The title track starts with the violins in a tentative, prickly dance, before the tenor saxophonist Jason Rigby alights, playing a repetitive melody — unresolved but deeply satisfying — over a bed of strings and horns. A heavier, more percussive section barrels in, with a melody derived from the original line. The song ends back on that soaring first passage, the band playing faster now and Rigby improvising into the beyond. RUSSONELLO With the slow, misty grace of a requiem, “Memories of Nanzenji” finds the keyboardist and crossover-jazz guru Mark de Clive-Lowe reflecting on a visit to the historic temple and gardens in Kyoto, Japan. Featuring a quintet that includes the whirling alto saxophone of Josh Johnson, this tune appears on “Heritage,” a new album out on Friday. It was largely recorded during a run of shows at the Blue Whale in Los Angeles, then de Clive-Lowe augmented the recordings in the studio, adding layers of synthesizer and more. RUSSONELLO I’m old enough to remember when 5 Seconds of Summer was a punk band! I’m old enough to remember when the Chainsmokers were … well, not quite good, but not this bad! If you are less old than I am, here is a song to order Sweetgreen to. CARAMANICA "
5c497e963a125f5075c06087,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/24/arts/music/kodak-black-r-kelly-dying-to-live.html,"A couple of years ago, songs made by the rapper Kodak Black as a young teenager began to recirculate online. The most striking was “Ambition,” a precociously skeptical and wounded song. “I’m 14 and already thinking ’bout death,” he rapped. “Damn, I was raised by the dead end.” For the rest of his teenage years, Kodak continued on this path, returning time and again to themes of hopeless circumstances, existential frailty, perseverance blended with nihilism. They ground all of his albums and mixtapes, right up through “Dying to Live,” his second studio album, which was released last month and debuted at the top of the Billboard album chart. But Kodak’s success comes under a lingering cloud, one familiar to any observer of hip-hop in the past few years. The 21-year-old Florida rapper is scheduled to stand trial this spring on charges of criminal sexual conduct, stemming from a 2016 incident in South Carolina in which he is accused of sexually assaulting a young woman at a hotel following a concert. According to the Florence County Sheriff’s Office incident report, he bit the victim and told her “that he could not help himself.” She reported the attack to her school resource officer. A condition of the consent order setting Kodak’s bond is that he cannot discuss the case publicly, nor can anyone representing the defense or the prosecution, according to Beattie Ashmore, one of his lawyers. Of the many rappers who in recent years have experienced explosive popularity while facing horrific criminal allegations, none is as contemplative or introspective an artist as Kodak Black. 6ix9ine is a taunter. XXXTentacion wrestled with pain, but rarely with ethics. Neither arrived at a place in which morality was a recurrent theme of his work. Over two major label albums and several mixtapes, Kodak has proved himself to be an acute observer of both his own internal conflicts and the external circumstances that helped set him on his path. If any artist in this situation is well-suited to directly tackle the complexities of these sorts of issues in his art — and in public life — it’s him. But he hasn’t risen to the occasion. “Dying to Live” — Kodak’s first major musical statement since being released from jail in August for weapons and drug charges and probation violation — is a very strong album, and in places, you hear the Kodak who might have something of substance to say. On “Transgression,” he proposes a turn to penitence: “I did everything the streets told me was cool to do/Now I’d rather prove it to myself before I prove to you/I hate I fell in love with thuggin’, I give my mama anxiety.” On “Needing Something,” he tightens his slurry wheeze into an anguished singing voice: “All this pain make me sing songs/Ain’t no love in the sewer that I came from.” Elsewhere on the album, like on “Testimony” and “If I’m Lyin, I’m Flyin,” he sounds regretful, rapping with a heavy head about God trying to set him on a better path. But given what’s happening in his public life, what isn’t there is almost louder: any sort of understanding of what it’s like to victimize someone, or be a victim. There is no shortage of opportunities to speak about these issues in public settings, however, and Kodak’s recent promotional tour around the release of “Dying to Live,” which took him mostly to radio stations, provided several chances for him to be engaged by interviewers. That’s what happened on the Hot 97 morning show “Ebro in the Morning.” The host Ebro Darden began the conversation by mentioning Kodak’s various criminal cases, but then pivoted away from them into an interview that had all the comfort of a trip to the principal’s office. In one moment of a generally unrevealing interview, Kodak was comfortable enough to display reflection: “I don’t really believe in karma, but I feel like the world, it don’t favor us, so I gotta, like, stop, like, living and thugging so hard, so the world can soften up around me.” A moment later, he added, “A good tree ain’t gonna produce no bad fruit.” This was the Kodak that appears in his music: self-aware, and concerned with consequences. It was the perfect moment for Darden to introduce a challenging line of questioning, but instead, the conversation retreated to the banal. Only at the conclusion did Darden return to the subject, while never directly asking Kodak a question. “We take sexual assault here serious,” Darden said sternly, then followed with an invitation to return and discuss it at a later date. Kodak looked disoriented. Moreover, he appeared surprised that the allegation would be even alluded to in an interview, as if no one around him had suggested it might. He brusquely walked out. In other interviews from that week, the allegations did not come up. Kodak’s talk with the Breakfast Club, on the Hot 97 rival station Power 105, was much more jovial, including banter about safe sex and child support. On the podcast “A Waste of Time With ItsTheReal” — which opened with a direct statement that Kodak wouldn’t be asked about the allegations — Kodak again revealed striking insight into navigating the gap between perception and reality: “Sometimes they make you feel like criminalized and all that stuff. Sometimes they make you feel like you worthless and stuff, so when I see people really like shouting, and trying to take pictures, screaming, I be like, damn, me? Like for real? I’m from the projects. Like, me?” Missed opportunities, all of them. Part of this has to do with the norms of the day — power has tilted heavily in celebrities’ favor when it comes to press: Media outlets routinely make ethical sacrifices to secure big names. Kodak communicates with his fans via Instagram, and generally, that is enough for him; being asked uncomfortable questions is something he hasn’t learned how to manage. It’s a circumstance that allows young artists to experience great success with little friction, and possibly, to remain successful while holding skepticism and inquiry at arm’s length, or pretending it doesn’t exist altogether. That wasn’t always the case, however. It was especially pointed listening to the Kodak Black album and observing its rollout in the wake of the recent Lifetime documentary series “Surviving R. Kelly,” which details allegations that have long trailed the 52-year-old R&B singer: that he targets underage women for sexual relationships, deploys emotional and physical abuse against his partners and leverages his power and stature to silence his victims. The scope of Kelly’s alleged transgressions is vast, and spans decades. Kodak Black is accused of one sexual assault. But the R. Kelly series underscored the changing ways in which performers hide, both in their public life and their art. “Surviving R. Kelly” reminds us how throughout Kelly’s ascent and troubled run, the media kept the allegations in the public conversation. There is footage from three televised interviews with Kelly: In 2002, after a sex tape that appears to show him urinating on an underage girl leaks; in 2008, after he is acquitted of child pornography charges; in 2012, pegged to the release of his autobiography. The interviews are awkward, and Kelly is deflecting in each of them. Nevertheless, Kelly faced public questioning, in a time in which television — and media in general — held more sway over an artist’s public image. Kelly’s reply when asked directly if he is attracted to teenage girls — “When you say ‘teenage,’ how old are we talking?” — remains indelible, much as Kodak’s blunt dismissal of Darden and abrupt departure, captured on video and spread widely online, will. But perhaps the more meaningful lesson to be extracted from “Surviving R. Kelly” has to do with Kelly’s strategic use of music as a character witness. Kelly deployed the godly alongside the carnal, the romantic alongside the lustful; during eras in which he was being vilified, he often used music — “I Believe I Can Fly,” “Step in the Name of Love” — as a means of cleansing his image in real time. And then there is Kodak, haunted by his demons and gifted at sharing. But his capacity for reflection is a similar distraction — a glimmer of maturity that holds out hope, but is only a glimmer. To be vulnerable and also cloistered, mature and also naïve — it is possible for both things to be true at the same time. "

Let us know at theplaylist@nytimes.com and sign up for our Louder newsletter, a once-a-week blast of our pop music coverage. Tame Impala — Kevin Parker playing everything he can in the studio — aligns multiple eras, but mostly the 1970s, in “Patience,” his first single since 2015. “Has it really been that long?” he sings. Pounding major-seventh piano chords like Todd Rundgren, using conga drums to punch up and punctuate synthesizer arpeggios, and hinting at Michael Jackson in his melodies, he comes to the realization that he’s “growing up in stages/living life in phases.” It’s an honest part of a long-term evolution. JON PARELES Lizzo continues to stake out turf as one of this year’s most versatile pop breakouts — a sturdy singer, a limber rapper and always rich with lighthearted thirst. On “Tempo,” she goes bump for bump with Missy Elliott on an electro-hip-hop thumper teeming with arched-eyebrow come-ons. It’s pure, infectious joy. JON CARAMANICA Cowbells clink, the wah-wah guitar cackles, synthesizer lines wriggle and horns punch terse little riffs in the latest single from Ibibio Sound Machine, a London band whose lead singer, Eno Williams, is from Nigeria; the band releases its album “Doko Mien” on Friday. “Wanna Come Down” is a snappy funk track that owes more to Prince than to Nigeria’s own Afrobeat or juju. Williams splits her lyrics between English and the African language Ibibio but the video clip, alas, offers no subtitles. PARELES It makes some sense that the Last Poets — who, in the late 1960s, did more to augur the rise of hip-hop than any band of their generation — would find relevance today by looking back. This group was always guided by ancient practices, and the last few years have demonstrated that America’s troubled racial history remains close at hand. On “For the Millions,” from an album due in May, the bassist Jamaaladeen Tacuma offers a buoyant accompaniment that recalls the poets’ 1972 record, “Chastisment.” And Abiodun Oyewole reaches further back, rapping a remembrance of black lives lost over the years, and a call to continue the fight. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO Justin Vernon of Bon Iver has been citing Bruce Hornsby as an influence since the beginning of his career, and over the last few years, the two performers have been inching toward each other. This jagged but soothing collaboration was recorded at Vernon’s Eau Claire studio. Vernon’s singing is characteristically pastel, while Hornsby’s has a heavy, urgent grounding. Their hymnal give and take owes something to folk and roots music, and something to jazz, and it’s surprising, given how different their vocal approaches are, just how much their words appear to be hugging each other, balms in an emotional storm. CARAMANICA Nature abhors a vacuum, so with Ed Sheeran largely missing in action, the Australian singer Dean Lewis has stepped into the void. Last year, Lewis’s single “Be Alright” was a savvy slice of mournful folk-pop. He’s just released his debut album, “A Place We Knew,” which includes “Stay Awake,” an impressively dynamic number about the hope of love that nods to both Sheeran’s crisp melodies and his irrepressible urge toward rhythm. CARAMANICA A breezy cross-generational Mexican-American love song featuring two of the most prominent and long-running Chicano rappers — MC Magic, from Phoenix, and Lil Rob, from San Diego — and Cuco, the rising indie soul-pop singer from South Los Angeles. “Search” moves slowly and with warmth, in the manner of the slow-jam oldies played for decades on Los Angeles radio by Art Laboe, whom MC Magic name-checks here. Like those molasses-thick grooves, this song is almost guilelessly sweet: In the video, the two young protagonists don’t even so much as kiss. CARAMANICA The Doobie Brothers of nü-trap play tug-of-war with unexpected sweetness over light piano and lighter drums. Nav, as ever, is a font of melancholy and mistrust, and Young Thug … well, Young Thug remains a master of free-associative madness, concluding with a flirtatious riff that begins, “You look just like my rich auntie” and goes on to express sentiments that, for most, would be verboten, but which in his signature wail sound like vivid confession. CARAMANICA Burrow into “Hungry Ghost,” the new album by the guitar-bass-drums trio Typical Sisters, and you might start to notice what isn’t there. This is improvisation-driven music, right at the corner of jazz and post-rock, but there are none of the showy, full-band misdirections that have become so typical of jazz today. And while the album’s title refers to Chinese Buddhism, these aren’t slow, numinous, incantatory sounds, either. Instead, what you get is happily in the middle and something increasingly rare today: group exploration with little flexing or hurry, electric guitar melodies that sound like open promises — a reminder that it’s O.K. to listen with no expectation of a payoff.

But now, once those holiday playlists stop streaming, it becomes just another slow week on the charts. The rapper 21 Savage has the No. 1 spot on Billboard’s album chart for a second time with “I Am > I Was,” with the equivalent of about 65,000 sales in the United States, according to Nielsen. That includes 84 million streams and a little more than 3,000 copies sold as a full album. Overall, the album lost 51 percent of its momentum from its opening week. With no major new releases last week, A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie holds at No. 2 with “Hoodie SZN,” while most of the rest of the Top 10 is also filled with recent rap hits: Meek Mill’s “Championships” is No. 3, Post Malone’s “Beerbongs & Bentleys” is No. 4, and the “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse” soundtrack — featuring Post Malone, Lil Wayne, Juice WRLD and others — is No. 5. Michael Bublé’s “Christmas,” which had reached as high as No. 3 this season, fell to No. 148 with a 91 percent decline in streams, while Mariah Carey’s “Merry Christmas” fell 173 spots to No. 181. In total, songs from the Top 200 albums racked up 2.6 billion streams last week, down from 3.4 billion the week before. "

Here are 10 more artists our pop music critics will be keeping an eye on in 2019. [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] When she’s gently strumming an acoustic guitar and singing about love in her reedy, tremulous mezzo-soprano, the 21-year-old Jade Bird might seem to fit a soothing, long-established singer-songwriter mold on “Love Has All Been Done Before.” But that’s only until she gets riled. Then her rock band kicks in, her voice gets rough and her words turn pointed and pitiless. And when full fury takes over, she starts spitting lines at rap speed. She’s no pushover. Her debut album is due April 19. JON PARELES This Los Angeles rapper has a quixotic, charismatic flow, spilling words past the end of lines with a pinched, tart voice that recalls the earliest Los Angeles gangster rap. On the recent mixtape “Famous Cryp,” he’s vibrant but protean, still figuring out the boundaries of his skill. But songs like “DM,” “Bleed It” and “Thotiana” are terse, bawdy and infectious. JON CARAMANICA Nicola Cruz is an electronic musician, producer and D.J. from Ecuador who has already made a reputation on the international club circuit. Instead of putting electronic sounds in the foreground, he builds tracks from loops and improvisations that are likely to come from ancient instruments, particularly Andean ones like wood flutes, percussion and small guitars — though he might also try a sitar. The artificial pieces he constructs sound oddly natural. His second album, “Siku” — named after an Andean panpipe — comes out Jan. 25. PARELES Billie Eilish’s debut album is likely to appear this year, and while she’s only 17, she is no unknown. Since her initial SoundCloud postings in 2015, her online releases have drawn hundreds of millions of Spotify streams and have made her a tour headliner. The songs she writes with her brother and producer, Finneas O’Connell, are usually hushed ballads that glance back at Lana Del Rey and Lorde. Her voice is whispery and sweetly tearful with a steely undercurrent, and it stakes out a particular persona: passionate and vulnerable but also vindictive and treacherous. Onstage, she gets thousands of voices singing along. PARELES In current country, Fleetwood Mac and the Eagles loom as large as Hank Williams and Loretta Lynn once did. Lauren Jenkins writes and sings about disappointment, disillusion, drinking and holding on despite it all with a Stevie Nicks rasp in her voice. Her debut album, “No Saint,” is set for March 15, and it surrounds her most bitter tidings with gleaming guitars and bright harmonies. PARELES LeeBrian, a young Puerto Rican rapper, is the first artist signed to the label of Sky, the producer responsible for hits by J Balvin (and others). LeeBrian is a nimble, flexible vocalist — sometimes agitated, sometimes preternaturally relaxed, and often toggling between both, like on the whimsical “Goku Sin El Ki.” CARAMANICA Lil Tjay is an exuberant, sweet-voiced singer-rapper from the Bronx with an easy instinct for melody. What helps him stand out from the current overstuffed class of artists with similar aesthetic approaches is his comfort moving between both light and dark subject matter, as on the hit “Brothers” and “Long Time.” CARAMANICA Over the past few years, this Texas native has found success in Nashville as a songwriter for Brett Eldredge among others. But listening to her recent debut album, the soothing and lovely “Borrowed Heart” — some of which was written with Lori McKenna — that work for others sounds superfluous. She’s got a sturdy, rich voice, and a way of bending a song toward sadness, where she sounds right at home. CARAMANICA The South African songwriter Nakhane Touré is also a novelist and actor whose works deal with a fraught upbringing: He broke away from conservative Christian “conversion therapy” to prize his identity as a gay man. The songs on his album “You Will Not Die” — released in Europe last year and due Feb. 22 in the United States — delve into both trauma and redemption. They ponder faith, pleasure, exile and belonging; they traverse hymns, neo-soul, South African pop and electronic dance music, and Nakhane’s voice crests in a vibrant, androgynous falsetto. Tenacity carries him toward joy. PARELES Of all the members of the YBN hip-hop collective, none shows more promise than YBN Cordae, a North Carolina rapper who specializes in thoughtful, emotionally eloquent and lyrically complex music. On songs like “Kung Fu,” he’s impressively dexterous, and of all the rappers who’ve taken swipes at J. Cole recently, only he handed any blows. CARAMANICA "

On Friday she released an album, “Thank U, Next,” and a hot-button video for a new single, “Break Up With Your Girlfriend, I’m Bored.” And throughout Sunday, she found several ways — some earnest, some petty — to stay at the forefront of online discussion. When she won best pop vocal album, for “Sweetener,” she wrote on Twitter, “I try not to put too much weight into these things,” conceding, “this is wild and beautiful.” She appeared in a psychedelically disorienting commercial for Apple’s Memoji, with an animated Grande head performing “7 Rings.” When Cardi B won best rap album, Grande fired off a couple of frustrated tweets; her ex-boyfriend, Mac Miller, who died last year, was a nominee. (She later apologized and deleted all of the tweets.) And she posted several photos of herself in the custom Zac Posen dress she was going to wear during the ceremony. [Who soared and who flopped? See the best and worst of the Grammys.] This wasn’t the Grammy experience Grande was planning to have. Up until a couple of days ago, she was slated to perform on the broadcast, a plan that imploded in spectacular fashion. After the longtime show producer Ken Ehrlich said in an interview that Grande was no longer performing because she “felt it was too late for her to pull something together,” Grande replied with barbs. “I’ve kept my mouth shut but now you’re lying about me,” Grande wrote on Twitter. “I can pull together a performance over night and you know that, Ken. It was when my creativity & self-expression was stifled by you, that I decided not to attend.” And so on the night of the Grammys, all of the noise Grande generated was heard everywhere but the actual broadcast, making her one of several artists who made loud splashes without ever setting foot in the Staples Center. This year’s ceremony was perhaps as notable for who didn’t show up — Kendrick Lamar, Childish Gambino (who won four awards, including record and song of the year for “This Is America”), Taylor Swift — as who did. And also for how it treated several of its biggest winners, including Drake, cutting off their speeches abruptly. (This, on a broadcast on which only nine awards were handed out over more than three and a half hours.) [Hear our pop music team break down the Grammy highs and lows.] So perhaps the best place to communicate an unfettered message during the Grammys is anywhere but the actual ceremony. The show still conceives of itself as a linear television experience, when in fact the consumption of it — and especially the stars it relies upon — is wild, woolly and omnidirectional. Consider 21 Savage, nominated for two awards for his role on Post Malone’s “Rockstar” but unable to attend because of his detention by Immigration and Customs Enforcement last week. When Post Malone performed, he didn’t mention his collaborator, which spurred a fierce backlash online. (Eventually, a photo of him wearing a 21 Savage T-shirt underneath his outfit was circulated.) Kei Henderson, one of 21 Savage’s managers, wrote on Twitter that she and others “attempted to solidify recognition for Savage during the performance of ‘Rockstar,’ it just didn’t work out that way.” The only person to mention 21 Savage during the broadcast was Ludwig Göransson, the Childish Gambino collaborator. The lack of other acknowledgment was glaring. Some stars used the Grammys window to advertise their other endeavors. Childish Gambino appeared in a vivid ad for Google’s Playmoji in which he danced alongside an avatar of himself. Travis Scott had one of the most energetic performances of the show, but also released a new sneaker during the ceremony. Taylor Swift, who was nominated once this year, posted a photo on Instagram from the Baftas, in London. (Last year, the video for “The Middle” — the Zedd, Maren Morris and Grey collaboration — debuted during the Grammys as part of a Target advertising campaign; this year, it was nominated for record and song of the year. The side road works.) While plenty of stars sought a way around the Grammy telecast pipeline, others used it to its fullest potential. Cardi B, who often appears to be the only performer in any field who still experiences genuine shock and gratitude, delivered an emotional speech after winning best rap album. Brandi Carlile’s performance of “The Joke” was outlandishly good, and Alicia Keys’s hosting had several slyly intriguing moments. Following a brutally boring Grammys last year that also deeply marginalized women, it was refreshing that most of this year’s high points came from female artists. More often, though, when the Grammys had an opportunity to celebrate one of pop’s most prominent stars, it dropped the ball. Speeches from almost all the most relevant winners — Kacey Musgraves, Cardi B, Dua Lipa — were cut short. In no case was this more egregious than with Drake, by far the most popular artist to win a Grammy this year. Drake was offered a performance slot, but turned it down (as did Lamar and Childish Gambino). So when he popped up onstage after he was announced as the winner of best rap song, it was a true surprise. [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] While his appearance was magnanimous — especially after his prior critiques of the Grammys — his speech was anything but. He took a swipe at his prior best rap song Grammy win for “Hotline Bling,” which is not (really) a rap song. He drew attention to the fact that those who vote for the Grammys might not be the best equipped to “understand, you know, what a mixed-race kid from Canada has to say, or a fly Spanish girl from New York, or anybody else, or a brother from Houston,” acknowledging Cardi B and Travis Scott. And then, the real humdinger. “Look, if there’s people who have regular jobs who are coming out in the rain, in the snow, spending their hard-earned money to buy tickets to come to your shows, you don’t need this right here, I promise you. You already won.” “But,” Drake continued. The Grammys, however, did not continue with him. The camera pulled back to a wide shot, and then the show quickly cut to commercial. (A representative for the show later said that producers mistook Drake’s pause for the end of his remarks.) The Grammys made room for plenty of time-absorbers: Alicia Keys karaoke; umpteen tributes; a long montage dedicated to the Recording Academy’s beleaguered outgoing leader, Neil Portnow. But it is the show’s stubborn curse that it’s willing to cut off the most popular and meaningful artist in pop at the knees in order to preserve its sense of self-importance — a preposterous and careless choice. It is that same hubris that allows Ariana Grande to watch the Grammys from the couch rather than be on the stage, and that ensures the Grammys will continue to be a site of protest, of dissent, and dullness for years to come, pending changes in leadership and attitude. After the ceremony, Drake posted a photo of the victory envelope bearing his name, and added the caption “Too raw for TV.” Now more than ever, that’s a fine way to be. "
5c646f493a125f5075c098a0,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/13/arts/music/ariana-grande-thank-u-next-review.html,"No current pop star is more adept at stoking and channeling swells of online fan curiosity than Ariana Grande. In the past year, she navigated a tumultuous relationship with the comedian Pete Davidson; the death of an ex-boyfriend, the rapper Mac Miller; a public row with the Grammys; and more. In the process, she has become a master of the Easter egg, the clapback, the strategic tweet-and-delete. In the middle of a storm, Grande is cool and collected, hands firmly on the wheel. This comes through in her use of social media, and also in her music and videos. “Sweetener,” an optimistic love-song album released last August, was hot on the heels of her high-octane short-duration romance with Davidson. And the singles leading up to her new album, “Thank U, Next,” aggressively fed the gossip machine, ensuring that just as Grande’s music was reaching its peak popularity, she was also the subject of continuous meta-musical conversation. It is savvy gamesmanship, and an appropriately modern approach to pop superstardom in the age of social media and streaming. And yet that flirtation with tabloid ubiquity is the least interesting aspect of “Thank U, Next,” Grande’s fifth album, which has some hiccups but is still her most musically flexible and au courant release to date. [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] A pure vocal talent who early in her career excelled with songs that gave her singing generous room to breathe, Grande hasn’t always been in close dialogue with the rest of pop music. That has changed now. “Thank U, Next” was reportedly made in around two weeks, and it shows, but in the right ways — there is less deadening polish on the vocal production, and Grande demonstrates a new comfort toying with style and approach. That’s clearest on the album standout, “Bloodline,” which communicates a cruel sentiment — “don’t want you in my bloodline” — with disarming casualness. Produced by the pop hitmaker Max Martin, “Bloodline” has rocksteady breeze, electro sternness and some of Grande’s most in-the-pocket singing. “Thank U, Next” can be split between the songs produced by Martin, both alone and with his regular collaborator Ilya Salmanzadeh, and the rest. The Martin songs are crisp, as always: “Bad Idea” has the urgency and cool of late 1980s pop. “Break Up With Your Girlfriend, I’m Bored” — which includes a riff on ‘N Sync’s most snide anthem, “It Makes Me Ill” — is so bulbous and tart that it sounds jolly. (The other Martin contribution, “Ghostin,” is the album’s only real dud.) It’s in the other songs, however, that Grande takes her most intriguing leaps, largely because of the new fluidity she brings to her singing. As the pop music landscape has shifted to take in the dominance of streaming, it was inevitable that R&B, and also older-fashioned pop, would find their way toward hip-hop. And not in a platitudinous, quick-handshake-while-pinching-your-nose way, but a serious integration — the rhythmic and attitudinal choices that have long been central to hip-hop are becoming essential to artists far outside the genre. And so it has gone for Grande, who has learned to contort her huge voice into the clipped cadences that have defined the hip-hop mainstream over the last couple of years. On “7 Rings,” she’s so convincing with her flow that there was wild disagreement online as to which rapper she was ripping off. (2 Chainz, most likely, but maybe Soulja Boy.) “Fake Smile” takes a different approach to the same idea, opening with the same melancholy soul sample used in the Wu-Tang Clan’s “Tearz”; its rough-hewed urgency is threaded throughout the rest of the song. There are other curious musical choices, as well — the jubilation and saccharine taste of the hook of “NASA” recalls K-pop. And Grande hasn’t totally disconnected from the clarity and spaciousness of her early music, heard here on the pristine “Make Up,” which sounds naïve from a distance but roars with mature desire. That these varying choices all sound comfortable together is the real sign of progress on this album. Its mild disorganization isn’t dissimilar to the direction Rihanna was moving on “Anti.” That was the first moment in which she truly stepped out into uncharted territory, showing off unexpected strengths that had long been hidden. “Thank U, Next” proves that Grande, too, has many other places to roam.

5c5795f33a125f5075c07d67,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/03/arts/music/super-bowl-halftime-show.html,"Maroon 5 — a quasi-soul, quasi-rock, utterly funkless band — was the main attraction at the Super Bowl halftime show at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, likely the third or eighth or maybe 14th choice for a headliner. In a year in which the Super Bowl halftime show has become a referendum on political mindfulness, in which the N.F.L. has become a staging ground for conversations about racial justice in America, Maroon 5 was a cynically apt choice. It is neutral, inoffensive, sleek without promising too much. For nearly two decades, it has been wildly popular without leaving much of a musical mark, as easy to forget as mild weather. And the band did no better during its 13 and a half minutes onstage, in a performance that was dynamically flat, mushy at the edges, worthy of something much worse than derision: a shrug. It was an inessential performance from a band that might have lost some moral authority if it had any moral authority to lose. Perhaps for the N.F.L., which probably sought to make the halftime performance as anodyne as possible, this was a victory. But what saddles Maroon 5 as a band — its propensity to pretend lithe things are thumping, its commitment to thinning out the soul and rock of the 1970s and 1980s until they’re so brittle they might snap — doomed this performance, which blithely skated through a half-dozen of the band’s hits. [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] And in a year in which the political valence of the halftime show mattered more than ever, the band’s stubborn resistance was glaring. The N.F.L. canceled the traditional news conference for performers this year, looking to avoid a fiasco. But the frontman Adam Levine did do an interview with “Entertainment Tonight” in which he suggested that the choice to perform at the halftime show triggers in some an “insatiable urge to hate a little bit.” “No one thought about it more than I did,” he added, not very reassuringly. “I’m not in the right profession if I can’t handle a little bit of controversy.” Efforts to blunt Maroon 5’s dullness, and its political aversion, were being made for weeks before the formal announcement that it would be the headliner. In December, Variety reported that the band had approached a half-dozen black artists to appear as part of the performance. But the decision of whether to perform was now oriented around the protests of Colin Kaepernick and other N.F.L. players, who in 2016 began taking a knee during the national anthem (or otherwise not standing at attention) as a means of drawing attention to the systemic oppression of black people in this country. The halftime show — one of the biggest stages in pop, and also an unpaid performance on behalf of the N.F.L. — became radioactive. Perform, and be perceived as a shill for the league. (Kaepernick is pursuing a grievance against the N.F.L., accusing team owners of colluding to keep him from playing in the league.) Ultimately, Maroon 5 — a band that hasn’t had a Top 20 hit without a black or Latina guest performer in four years — was joined by Travis Scott, hip-hop’s most energetic performer, but not one much troubled by political concerns. (Last month, Scott announced he would, in partnership with the N.F.L., donate $500,000 to a nonprofit organization, Dream Corps.) Also added to the performance was Big Boi — one half of Outkast, and an Atlanta rap elder — which felt like an attempt at moral cover. Online petitions requested all of the performers take a knee in support of Kaepernick and his goals. No one did. For what it’s worth, the toxicity of being associated with the Super Bowl didn’t appear to extend beyond the halftime performance. Chance the Rapper performed in a Doritos commercial (with the Backstreet Boys); 2 Chainz was entertaining in an ad for Expensify; Cardi B and Lil Jon tag-teamed in a Pepsi ad. Both of the pregame performances were by black artists: a taut, controlled reading of “America the Beautiful” by Chloe x Halle and an impressive, if Disney-saccharine, national anthem from Gladys Knight, who before the game criticized Kaepernick for making the anthem a site of protest. In this context, Maroon 5 was a dead band walking: a base coat destined to be painted over. Three years ago, Beyoncé effectively hijacked Coldplay’s performance for one of the most rousing and politically savvy halftime performances ever. But nothing even remotely on that scale happened here. Scott and Big Boi were ushered on and offstage quickly, boxes that had been checked off. Scott bark-rapped his way through “Sicko Mode,” and at the end of his moment, fell backward onto the crowd, as close to his mayhem-filled live shows as circumstances allowed. Big Boi emerged in a Cadillac wearing a fur coat — the most exciting moment of the whole show — and did a casual pass at Outkast’s “The Way You Move,” with Sleepy Brown. When Levine joined them for a synchronized two-step, it took him a second or two to catch the groove. "
5c51e6bb3a125f5075c0725a,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/30/books/review-go-ahead-in-rain-tribe-called-quest-hanif-abdurraqib.html,"When it comes to experiencing music, our ears tell us only so much. In “Go Ahead in the Rain,” his book about A Tribe Called Quest, the poet and cultural critic Hanif Abdurraqib recalls the determination with which he listened to the hip-hop group’s fourth album, “Beats, Rhymes and Life,” when it was released in 1996. Thinking it would be their last, he was intent on loving it. His hands, though, were narrating another story. At the time, Abdurraqib was a teenager in Columbus, Ohio, where it would get unbearably cold during the winter; fiddling with the buttons on his Walkman to skip a song on the cassette entailed exposing his skin to the frigid air. And yet: “I would pull my fingers out of gloves and rush to fast-forward what I could before the wind forced my hands back to the warmth they craved.” Abdurraqib’s slender book is full of tactile moments like this, remembrances making it clear that A Tribe Called Quest will always evoke more for him than just a sound. “Go Ahead in the Rain” traces the story of the group over the past three decades. It pays attention to the larger changes in the culture, but its overall tenor is warm, immediate and intensely personal. Abdurraqib begins with a soaring, wide-angle view of the musical traditions that slaves brought to America from West Africa — drawing a path from a percussion that was outlawed by 18th-century slave codes to a jazz that was “born out of necessity” — before landing on his own childhood as a “shy and nervous kid” who took up the trumpet in an attempt to connect with his father. A Tribe Called Quest offered another chance for connection; their early albums, like “People’s Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm” (1990) and “The Low End Theory” (1991), with their jazz samples and socially conscious lyrics, were deemed “acceptable” in his parents’ house, where a lot of rap was not. Readers looking for a biography of the group will find some of the basics here, but it’s how Abdurraqib filters the information — absorbing it, refracting it through his own distinctive lens — that gives this compact book its power. He covers, among other things, A Tribe Called Quest’s beginnings in Queens; its involvement in the Afrocentric rap collective Native Tongues; and its nadir in the late ’90s, when the visionary energy the group brought to bear on its first three albums dissipated into something that started to sound dutiful and desultory. Two forces hastened A Tribe Called Quest’s breakup in 1998, according to Abdurraqib. One was large and impersonal, having to do with the state of hip-hop in the ’90s, when a flood of money deepened the apparent divide between commercialism and authenticity, presenting artists with a stark choice: “Be real enough to stay underground, or go pop enough to get money.” He locates A Tribe Called Quest and its wide-ranging appeal “at the center of this tug-of-war,” with the group getting worn down by the strain. This smart structural analysis is plausible enough, but what moves Abdurraqib the most is the intense and fractious friendship between two of the group’s core members, Q-Tip and Phife Dawg. (Ali Shaheed Muhammad and Jarobi White are also acknowledged as essential members in the book, but they appear mostly as onlookers to the main emotional drama.) Abdurraqib remembers identifying with Phife from the start: the scrappy M.C. who mastered the ironic art of the punch line, cutting grandiose bombast with comic self-deprecation. Q-Tip gets respect here for his brilliance and ambition, but Abdurraqib likens him to a perfectionist older brother: demanding and a bit aloof, seemingly oblivious to how hard Phife was trying to prove himself. The theme of mortality runs through the book, which is billed as a “love letter” on the cover but could also be called an elegy. Phife died of complications from diabetes in March 2016, just after A Tribe Called Quest had reunited and recorded “We Got It From Here … Thank You 4 Your Service,” their first new album in 18 years. The album was released just before midnight on Nov. 10, 2016, bearing lyrics that sounded veritably prophetic in light of the election results from just a couple of nights before. “All you black folks, you must go / All you Mexicans, you must go”: What might have constituted biting satire in a more (ostensibly) innocent time was beginning to sound like a news transcript. “Black folks have been creating with their backs against the wall for years, telling the future, speaking what is coming to the masses that aren’t eager to hear it until what’s coming actually arrives,” Abdurraqib writes. He says he is drawn to vibrations, beats and bass lines — “that which can be felt more than heard.” You can trace a line between this sentiment and Abdurraqib’s stubborn loyalty to cassettes long after CDs became available. CDs promised convenience and flawless digital sound, but cumbersome tapes — “the most tedious and least practical” listening technology — offered something more tangible; their fragility and physical constraints, the effort it took to skip songs, “locked a listener into a commitment.” Hip-hop albums in the 1990s were “sprawling, overrun with skits and Easter eggs” that you might miss if you messed with the fast-forward button. Similarly, the small size of Abdurraqib’s book is belied by how much it contains. In one chapter, he moves from The Source magazine to Toni Morrison to Emmett Till and Otis Redding; in another he moves from Philando Castile to Alton Sterling to Sterling’s job selling bootleg CDs and another “CD man” Abdurraqib once knew. “It’s funny, isn’t it — the things that play on our screens and in our heads for years, detached from any fullness,” he writes. To isolate something, to shear it from its context, is to distort it; by gathering stories from the past, Abdurraqib situates A Tribe Called Quest within the fullness of history and memory. With Phife gone, “a group like A Tribe Called Quest will never exist again,” Abdurraqib writes. “At least now, I think, we can lay them to rest.” This lush and generous book is a call to pay proper respects — not just to a sound but to a feeling.

5c5c90823a125f5075c088d3,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/07/arts/music/grammy-awards-diversity.html,"The Grammy Awards are supposed to be music’s biggest party. But in recent years the show has also become a piñata for critics, activists and even major artists over a host of issues like race and gender — and, oh yes, music. The 61st annual show, to be hosted by Alicia Keys and broadcast live by CBS on Sunday night, should be no different. After a bruising time last year, when the show came under fire after just one woman won a solo award on the air — and the chief executive of the Recording Academy, Neil Portnow, commented that women in music should “step up” to advance their careers — the Grammys made a series of changes in their membership and nominations process that were meant to address their underlying problems. But in many ways the Grammys still walk a tightrope. And as the show tries to stay culturally relevant, while also balancing the demands of race and gender representation, it may be impossible to please everybody at once. “That moment kind of shed a light on an issue that needed attention, and that is a lack of diversity in the industry,” Portnow said in an interview this week. “And if the light that was shed becomes a catalyst for change, then you can feel that it had a reason and a value.” To viewers, one of the clearest changes will be that eight, instead of five, acts will now compete in the four major categories: album, record and song of the year, and best new artist. That change satisfied many critics by adding more women to the mix, but it also has made the contests harder to handicap. For album of the year, Drake and Kendrick Lamar, two deities of contemporary hip-hop, are up against Post Malone, who has topped the charts with a mellow style between rapping and singing; the boisterous rap of Cardi B; the adventurous R&B of Janelle Monáe and H.E.R.; and two singer-songwriters in the country and folk spheres, Kacey Musgraves and Brandi Carlile. If Carlile prevails, she would be the award’s first openly gay winner. But as an artist with minimal sales, would her victory make the Grammys seem out of touch with the masses? Will a rapper win, or will they cancel one another out on the ballot? There is also a chance that the award could go to Drake or Lamar only to have the winner not show up. That has become a growing risk for the Grammys as the show has alienated more and more hip-hop and R&B stars — like Drake, Kanye West, Jay-Z and Frank Ocean — by failing to give them the most prestigious prizes. “The fact of the matter is, we continue to have a problem in the hip-hop world,” said Ken Ehrlich, the longtime producer of the show. “When they don’t take home the big prize, the regard of the academy, and what the Grammys represent, continues to be less meaningful to the hip-hop community, which is sad.” Ehrlich said that this year he offered performance slots on the show to Drake, Lamar and Childish Gambino — whose song “This Is America” is up for four awards, including record and song of the year — but they all declined. Representatives of those three artists declined to comment on whether they would attend the show. More bad news for the Grammys arrived on Thursday afternoon, when Ariana Grande confirmed reports that she had pulled out after clashing with producers — apparently Ehrlich himself — over which song to perform. “I’ve kept my mouth shut but now you’re lying about me,” Grande wrote on Twitter, responding to an Associated Press interview in which Erhlich said that she “felt it was too late for her to pull something together.” “I can pull together a performance over night and you know that, Ken,” she wrote. “It was when my creativity & self expression was stifled by you, that i decided not to attend. I hope the show is exactly what you want it to be and more.” Last year was another flash point in the troubled history of the Grammys and hip-hop, as Jay-Z, the most nominated artist, with eight nods — including album, record and song of the year — went home empty-handed, and Lamar, while winning all five awards in the rap field, lost out on album of the year, to Bruno Mars. Three months later, Lamar won the Pulitzer Prize for music. “For the Pulitzers to get it right and the Grammys to get it wrong says a lot,” said Troy Carter, an artist manager and former Spotify executive. Portnow said he believed the Grammys had made good-faith efforts to reach out to artists, but the tensions have shown no signs of letting up. “We would hope that all nominees attend the show and be there as their own achievements are celebrated,” Portnow said, “because that’s really what it’s about.” But while race has been a growing problem for years, the Grammys’ most urgent issue is over gender. Last year, a report by the University of Southern California, released days before the show, found dismal numbers about the representation of women in the music industry and at the Grammys. Lorde, the only woman nominated for album of the year in 2018, was not offered a solo performance slot. After the show, Portnow’s “step up” comment drew an immediate outcry, with some women music executives calling for his resignation. (Portnow said at the time that his words had been taken out of context, and later announced that would leave his position at the expiration of his contract in July.) In response, the Recording Academy appointed a task force, led by Tina Tchen, a former chief of staff to Michelle Obama, to “identify the various barriers and unconscious biases faced by underrepresented communities” at the academy and in the wider industry. Working with the task force, the academy has tried to make its voting pool more diverse, inviting 900 new people, from a variety of backgrounds, to be members; of those, 22 percent accepted in time to vote this year, according to Laura Segura Mueller, the academy’s vice president of membership and industry relations. Last week the task force challenged the music industry to hire more women producers and engineers, two jobs that are overwhelmingly male. Even with these steps, this year’s nominations show just how much work is left to achieve real gender parity. On the eight songs up for record of the year, a total of 48 producers and engineers were credited, and only two were female. One of them is Lady Gaga, as a producer of “Shallow,” her song with Bradley Cooper from “A Star Is Born,” which is a strong contender for both record and song of the year. Lady Gaga is scheduled to perform, but that night Cooper will be at the Baftas, the British film awards. (Taylor Swift, who is up for just one award, pop vocal album, is also in London, filming an adaptation of “Cats,” and is not expected to attend the show.) And this week U.S.C. released an updated version of its report, showing that the numbers for women working in music have not improved. Looking at Billboard’s year-end Hot 100 list for the last seven years — a total of 633 songs, after removing duplicates — the report found that of 1,455 artists credited on those songs, only 17.1 percent were women. In another finding, only three of those 633 songs were credited solely to female songwriters. “This report really solidifies what we saw last year,” said Stacy L. Smith, the founder of U.S.C.’s Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, and the leader of the study, “and confirms that females are still facing an inclusion crisis in prominent positions in the music space.” Portnow said he viewed last year’s criticism as an opportunity to address important issues, and for the academy to take a leadership role in the industry. Not everyone will be happy, he said, but that’s O.K. “The underlying factors of what makes people happy or unhappy changes from year to year,” he said. “It might be something musical, or it might be something sociological, which is what we’re seeing more of in today’s climate. But that’s appropriate, because that’s the time in history we are living in.” "
5c76a64e49f0eacbf105a710,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/27/arts/music/21-savage-arrest-ice.html,"ALPHARETTA, Ga. — At the beginning of the year, 21 Savage was at his commercial apex. His second album, “I Am > I Was,” spent two weeks atop the Billboard album chart. “Rockstar,” his collaboration with Post Malone, was nominated for two Grammys, and he was set to perform at the ceremony. But now he has a new, perhaps even higher-profile public role: To his supporters, he’s a possible martyr of conscience, under fire for his choice to express his political views in his music. A week before the Grammys, 21 Savage was arrested in Atlanta and put into removal proceedings by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which said he was an “unlawfully present United Kingdom national” and charged him with overstaying his visa. A week and a half later, he was released on $100,000 bond. 21 Savage — birth name She’yaa bin Abraham-Joseph — was, unknown to most, born in London in 1992, and an undocumented immigrant in the United States. That alone makes him vulnerable to removal by the immigration authorities. But in an interview earlier this month, two of his attorneys — Dina LaPolt, his general counsel, and Charles Kuck, his immigration attorney — proposed that there might have been political motivations at play. Three days before 21 Savage’s arrest on Feb. 3, LaPolt was already putting an action plan in motion. “We had heard that they were looking at him,” she said. In late January, 21 Savage performed a new version of his single “A Lot” on “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,” with lyrics that touched on the issue of children being separated from their parents at the United States border, a controversial Trump administration tactic to discourage illegal immigration. “There was scuttlebutt after the Jimmy Fallon show” coming from “some very high levels in Washington,” LaPolt added. What she heard suggested that 21 Savage had ruffled feathers. And so on the Thursday before the Super Bowl, LaPolt dispatched another attorney from her firm, Danielle Price, to Georgia to accompany 21 Savage back to California, a more immigrant-friendly state with a newly passed sanctuary law. He declined to go until after completing his contractual commitments — a pair of concerts at events surrounding the game — that weekend. While his case winds its way through the immigration system, 21 Savage’s team has been actively underscoring the political dimension to his plight and marshaling public support. A #Free21Savage coalition of a couple of dozen activist organizations is drawing attention to his situation, and two members of Congress — Hank Johnson and Zoe Lofgren — spoke publicly on his behalf while he was still in detention. Lofgren, from California and chairwoman of the House Judiciary Immigration and Citizenship Subcommittee, released a statement opening the door for 21 Savage to appear as a witness before her subcommittee and floating the idea that he had been arrested as a result of publicly questioning United States immigration policy. “Was his arrest in response to his Constitutionally protected speech?” the statement said. “It looks like that.” Bryan D. Cox, ICE’s Southern Region Communications Director, said in an email, “We’re not able to give any additional comment on this case.” Now that 21 Savage has been released on bond, his case moves to a different docket, for those who aren’t detained. The wait for his next hearing could be more than a year. “Time is our friend,” Kuck said. “We want to make sure we can maximize the politics and the process.” When 21 Savage was in detention, he “tried to refrain from talking to my mama and my kids — I ain’t want them to hear me through the phone,” the rapper said. He did want to speak with his lawyers, however. “I don’t like hopes and none of that,” he said he had told them. “Keep it real.” Between them, there is an easy rapport. In his music, 21 Savage rarely raps above a whisper, and in person, he was contained and disarmingly calm, speaking forcefully without ever raising his voice. On the day after his release, he was wearing all black, from his Balenciaga jacket to his Prada shoes, and his demeanor was studious. By contrast, his lawyers were sharp-tongued and defiant. While they barked on his behalf, he maintained imperturbable cool. For now, anyway, they will do much of the speaking. After interviews the day after his release with The New York Times and “Good Morning America,” 21 Savage has gone almost completely silent.  HIP-HOP MYTHOLOGIES are built on regional specificities. More than any other genre in American pop, rap music understands itself as the product of place. 21 Savage’s Atlanta is and has been the center of the genre’s innovation for more than a decade now — the most vital creative hotbed of the most vital American music. So the knowledge that he initially came from elsewhere served as a useful reminder that this American music, like so many American musics before it, wouldn’t sound the same without immigrants. A quick reminder: Almost all of hip-hop’s founder generation — Kool Herc, Grandmaster Flash, Doug E. Fresh — was born in the Caribbean. The island influence continues through today: Last year, Nicki Minaj wrote on Instagram about coming to the United States as an undocumented immigrant from Trinidad and Tobago when she was 5. Hip-hop has also faced immigration crises before. Slick Rick, one of the most innovative rappers of the late 1980s and early 1990s, was born in England. In 1991, he pleaded guilty to two counts of attempted murder (and other charges) in connection with the 1990 shooting of his former bodyguard. In 2001, he was arrested after performing on a cruise ship that left American waters and put into deportation proceedings, beginning a tug-of-war over his residency until 2008, when he was pardoned by David A. Paterson, then the governor of New York. In 2016, Slick Rick was granted United States citizenship. In 2009, Shyne — a protégé of Sean Combs — was deported to Belize, where he was born, not long after completing his sentence for attempted murder, assault and reckless endangerment related to the infamous 1999 shooting at Club New York (which also involved Combs and his girlfriend at the time, Jennifer Lopez). Slick Rick was, at times, a cause célèbre, but largely among the genre’s elders. Shyne became, in essence, collateral damage of late-90s rap excess. But both cases unfolded in far less dramatic moments of the immigration debate. By rapping about the child separation policy, 21 Savage inserted himself directly into a noxious political climate. And while many rappers, from YG to Eminem to Jay-Z, have spoken openly of their contempt for President Trump and his policies, none had as much to lose. Early in his career, 21 Savage did not immediately appear as a likely candidate for a political agitator. On his earliest mixtapes, he emerged as a coldhearted menace, dulled to the world’s pain. His lyrics were bleak, his attitude bleaker. Over the last couple of years, as he has become increasingly popular, he’s been steadily remaking his public image — a product, he said, of being exposed to more of the world. “I think financial freedom made me grow as a person,” he said, speaking about his desire to help others. “I did it as soon as I had the resources and the time. ‘Cause when you first start making money, it’s like you still figuring yourself out.” “But then it’s like, O.K., we a machine now,” he added. “Now we can get everybody else right.” It was this impulse, LaPolt said, that resonated with her when she was first in discussions to represent 21 Savage last year. “I realized how much he did for the community,” she said, citing his back-to-school drives and interest in spreading financial literacy to underserved populations. “I said to the rest of the team, ‘This needs to be at the forefront of the storytelling.’” LaPolt is a prominent music industry attorney who was one of the primary engines of the Music Modernization Act, the copyright legislation that was signed into law in October and which, among other things, updates how royalties are paid in the streaming age. When 21 Savage was arrested, she put her Washington connections to work. Johnson, a Congressman from Georgia who had attended a back-to-school drive organized by 21 Savage, wrote a letter of support. Lofgren’s statement came soon after. On the Sunday of the Grammys ceremony, which 21 Savage ended up watching on a television in his detention-center cell, Kuck called ICE’s toll-free number for detainee information and learned that, unexpectedly, a hearing had been scheduled for Tuesday morning.  NOW THAT 21 SAVAGE has been released from detention, the push to secure his status continues. His legal team has applied for cancellation of removal, which is available to individuals who have been in the United States for more than 10 years, have American citizen family members who rely on them, are of good moral character and have no disqualifying criminal convictions. In interviews early in his career, 21 Savage spoke frankly about his life before music. “I done sold cocaine, sold crack cocaine,” he told The Fader in 2016. “I never sold, like, a whole brick. I done took bricks.” In 2014 he was arrested, and later convicted, on drug charges. Last year, through a first-offender program, the conviction was removed from public record, though that still had “monstrous immigration consequences,” Kuck said. Subsequently, LaPolt hired the Atlanta-area attorney Abbi S. Taylor, who secured the vacating of the plea and the dismissal of the charges. The file is now sealed. A search for 21 Savage on the Georgia Felon Search website turns up nothing. In an hour-plus interview, 21 Savage declined to speak only about the particulars of his prior interactions with law enforcement. When ICE arrested 21 Savage, it stated that he had been convicted of an “aggravated felony” in addition to overstaying his visa. At the hearing where he was granted bond, it formally withdrew that charge. “Not only does he not have a conviction, but there are no pending charges, there never will be any charges from that, and that case is sealed,” Kuck said, “so it simply never happened.” But the specter of that case highlights a potential continuing concern: that 21 Savage’s public persona — his art, his social media, his prior public statements — could be leveraged against him. (Public image, and especially lyrical content, have often been used in legal proceedings involving hip-hop artists, as seen recently in the case of 6ix9ine.) Kuck said that such topics were raised in the first hearing, though, “it didn’t come up in a way that we believe hurt our case.” “I’m very optimistic,” Kuck added. “I am convinced that we will ultimately obtain permanent residence for him.” Asked if the uncertainty he still faces causes him anxiety, 21 Savage was blunt: “Hell yeah.” That he could be used as a political cudgel isn’t lost on anyone, including 21 Savage himself. “He goes, ‘Well, I don’t want Trump to come at me,’ and I go, ‘You’re the last person he’s going to come after,’” LaPolt said. “Who in their right mind is going to come after him and not have a complete backlash?” But for someone who for most of his life has lived with the permanent uncertainty of the undocumented, he was at his most exultant and confident speaking about not having to fight alone. “It’s like putting bulletproof glass in front of a bulletproof vest,” 21 Savage said. “I’m going to stand up already, this vest already going to stop any bullet you throw, and y’all going to come help and put some glass in front of it too? This can’t be stopped. We a tank now. We was already the army — now we coming in tanks.” "
5c5876873a125f5075c07f0f,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/04/arts/music/backstreet-boys-dna-billboard-chart.html,"The last time the Backstreet Boys had a No. 1 album, in fall 2000, CD sales were at their commercial peak and iTunes did not exist; even “American Idol” was still two years away. Since then, of course, the music business has been transformed. CDs are now a mere niche, and positions on Billboard’s weekly album chart are largely determined by billions of clicks on streaming services, each worth just a fraction of a penny. But this week, the Backstreet Boys — its five members now well into their 30s and 40s — benefited from the music industry’s last-ditch strategy to move CDs: concert-ticket sales bundles. Following in the footsteps of Ariana Grande, Travis Scott, Bon Jovi and the Dave Matthews Band, the Backstreet Boys offered fans copies of their latest album, “DNA” (K-BAHN/RCA), with tickets to their summer tour. That deal helped sell 227,000 copies of “DNA” in the United States last week, according to Nielsen. Back in 2000 that amount would have barely made a dent; the Backstreet Boys’ “Black & Blue” sold 1.6 million copies in its first week on sale that November. But in the chart’s new math, sales of complete albums now carry far greater weight than any single click. So even though “DNA” had just 6.6 million streams, the album sales put it far ahead of any other release this week, with 234,000 total “equivalent” album sales — a measurement that factors in complete album sales as well as streams and downloads of individual tracks. By comparison, the latest album by the rapper Future, “The Wizrd,” had a healthy 69 million streams in its second week out, yet only 3,000 sales as a full album, yielding an equivalent number of just 56,000. “The Wizrd,” last week’s chart-topper, fell to No. 2. Also this week, A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie’s “Hoodie SZN” holds at No. 3, Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper’s “A Star Is Born” soundtrack is No. 4, and Weezer’s latest untitled album — this one known as the “teal” album, with covers like Toto’s “Africa” and TLC’s “No Scrubs” — is No. 5.

5c7d718749f0eacbf105b470,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/04/arts/music/oscars-star-is-born-billboard-chart.html,"Four months after it last topped the Billboard album chart, Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper’s soundtrack to “A Star Is Born” has returned to No. 1 for a fourth time, thanks to the Academy Awards — and some deep-discount pricing on Amazon. “A Star Is Born” was up for eight Oscars on Feb. 24, including best picture, and best actor and actress for Cooper and Lady Gaga. It took home one, best original song, for “Shallow” — which Cooper and Lady Gaga performed on the show, sitting cheek to cheek at the piano. That publicity certainly helped the soundtrack reach No. 1. But so did an Amazon promotion offering downloads of the album at $3.99, which Lady Gaga made sure her 78 million Twitter followers knew about. (A further discount, to $2.99, was moot as far as the chart was concerned; according to Billboard’s rules, only sales made at $3.49 or more count toward an album’s chart position.) “A Star Is Born” ended last week with the equivalent of 128,000 sales in the United States — up about 150 percent from the week before — which included 76,000 copies sold as a full album and nearly 41 million streams, according to Nielsen. That success bumped Ariana Grande’s “Thank U, Next” to No. 2 after two weeks at the top, with the equivalent of 116,000 sales, including 127 million streams but just 19,000 copies sold as a full album. Also this week, two Atlanta rappers reached high positions with brand-new releases: Gunna opened at No. 3 with “Drip or Drown 2,” and Offset, from Migos, landed at No. 4 with his first solo album, “Father of 4.” The soundtrack to the Freddie Mercury biopic “Bohemian Rhapsody” — Queen, his band, opened the Oscars show, with the singer Adam Lambert — is in fifth place.

5c50dc473a125f5075c06fb9,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/29/obituaries/edwin-birdsong-dies.html,"Edwin Birdsong, a keyboard player and producer whose blend of funk, jazz and disco music from the 1970s and ′80s developed a cult following and was sampled by a later generation of artists, died on Jan. 21 in Inglewood, Calif. He was 77. His daughter Angela Birdsong said on Tuesday that the cause was not certain, but that Mr. Birdsong had suffered several strokes in the past and had congestive heart failure. Mr. Birdsong released a handful of solo albums, among them “What It Is” (1972), “Super Natural” (1973) and “Edwin Birdsong” (1979), but they achieved only limited success, and he turned to working as a sought-after session musician and producer for better-known acts. In the late 1980s, however, sample-hungry producers rediscovered Mr. Birdsong’s work, notably the songs “Rapper Dapper Snapper” and “Cola Bottle Baby.” The percussion and bass line of “Rapper Dapper Snapper” were an important part of “Me, Myself and I,” the breakout hit on De La Soul’s debut album, “3 Feet High and Rising” (1989). The song was also sampled on the Gang Starr song “Skills” in 2003. “Cola Bottle Baby,” an energetic tribute to women of a certain shape, became the basis of a very different kind of dance music when the French electronic duo Daft Punk used it for the hit “Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger” on their second album, “Discovery” (2001). Kanye West repurposed “Cola” yet again when he sampled Daft Punk’s single to make an even bigger hit, “Stronger,” on his third album, “Graduation” (2007). In an interview with the online audio program Jazz Under the Bridge in 2016, Mr. Birdsong said he felt “blessed” to see his creations reinvented, adding, “God gives the music to all of the musicians around the world.” Edwin Lee Birdsong was born on Aug. 22, 1941, in Shreveport, La., to Sidney and Josephine (Page) Birdsong. His father was a Baptist minister, and Edwin grew up playing the piano in church. The family moved to Los Angeles when Edwin was young, and he graduated from high school there in 1959 before serving in the Army. For a time he was stationed in Germany, where he played piano in bars. After returning to the states, he studied music at the Manhattan School of Music and the Juilliard School without graduating from either. Mr. Birdsong worked with Stevie Wonder and was a frequent collaborator with Roy Ayers, the jazz, funk and soul vibraphone player. One of his collaborations with Mr. Ayers, “Running Away,” was sampled by A Tribe Called Quest on “Description of a Fool,” the last song on their first album, the hip-hop classic “People’s Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm” (1990). Mr. Birdsong’s three marriages ended in divorce. He lived in Victorville, Calif. In addition to his daughter Angela, he is survived by five other daughters, Linda Owens and Robin, Tia, Shebibah and Candice Birdsong; three sons, Sterling, Singh and Anthony; three sisters, Linda Ticer, Elzater Williams and Lemonia Golden; a brother, Sheldon; eight grandchildren; and six great-grandchildren.

How he’s filling at least part of that downtime? Video games. A fan of the Red Dead Redemption series, he was nudged into contributing an original song to Red Dead Redemption 2. “Unshaken” is lonely cowboy-western soul, produced by Daniel Lanois — an incantation for those with bleary eyes and unswerving defiance. JON CARAMANICA A chorus of “oohs” and “ahs” in jazzy chords, circling without resolution, accompanies the Chicago rapper Noname as she calmly zooms down her latest stream of consciousness. Syncopating her rhymes rapidly and precisely over the tricky beat, Noname touches on her success without a record label, African-American representation on TV, mass incarceration, Christmas and all the direct messages she has ignored, among other things. “I sell pain for profit, not propaganda,” she declares. Her producer, Phoelix, also shows up as a singer with an enigmatic, equally unresolved chorus. JON PARELES A fine mist of guitar-pop, “Promise” — the new solo single from Jimin, of the K-pop juggernaut BTS — runs in the opposite direction of the familiar BTS maximalism. Here he sounds tender and sweet, and the song never moves quicker than a saunter. In the broader BTS oeuvre, it’s something of an afterthought, casual and unobtrusive. But that hardly matters: It broke the SoundCloud record for most plays in a song’s first 24 hours. CARAMANICA Post Malone’s farewell to 2018 is far more exuberant than anything he released last year. “Wow.” is boastful but not melancholy — “I got a lot of toys/720S bumpin’ Fall Out Boy” — and he’s largely rapping, with only a flimsy skin of melody. After a year in which his album “Beerbongs & Bentleys” helped set the framework for pop’s full-molt evolution, this is a chipper cherry on top, unconcerned with formal innovation and blithely cheerful. CARAMANICA A lurching beat, somewhere in the vicinity of reggae, and a psychedelic-orchestral blur of instruments accompany the high, singsong vocals of Neshma Friend, who records as Micropixie. “How could we ever win the game of life/When all we ever knew was pain and strife/Every day,” she muses. She admits to the hopes that a holiday can raise, then ambles off her own way. PARELES This quartet from New York writes songs spiked with humorous asides, ska guitar and riot grrrl attitude (so it doesn’t sound anything like T. Rex, or the Marc Bolan tribute act from England that shares its name). The group started when its members were still in high school and its second album, “Prehysteria,” delivers more scrawny indie rock with an extra helping of eye roll. Over the Sleater-Kinney-ish backdrop of “Maddy’s Got a Boyfriend,” Lyris Faron nurses a wounded heart: “She leaves me crying in the sand/she said she never liked my band.” CARYN GANZ “I love you baby but my lips are turning blue,” Ursula Rose raps, deadpan, shattering the male self-pity and metronomic electro-pop that Bear Hands concocted for the rest of this track. She’s centered; the guys are a mess. PARELES It has been six years between albums for the Danish songwriter and classical composer Nanna Oland Fabricius, who made her debut album as Oh Land in 2008. “Human Error” merges her early dance-pop electronics with skeletal piano and unfurling orchestral arrangements as she sings about the difference between calculated planning and real life: “No missing digits, no real mistakes/Just human errors make human hearts break,” she realizes. PARELES Steph Richards composes in ways that standard notation could never document. To make “Brooklyn Machine,” she yanked out one of her trumpet’s valves — some air escapes where it ought to be, making the muffled, sometimes warping sound you hear in your right speaker. The tinnier tone coming from the left emerges when Richards covers the valve and air passes through the horn’s bell, like usual. The bell, in turn, is covered with a mute, helping her create the fuzzy mumble at the beginning of the track. “Brooklyn Machine” appears on “Take the Neon Lights,” her forthcoming album, but the performance in the video above — featuring abstracted urban scenes animated by Andrea Yasco — is a separate take, just under a minute and a half of haunting trumpet surgery and jostling play with her piano-bass-drums quartet. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO Paul McCartney, that Paul McCartney, uses Auto-Tune — yes, Auto-Tune — to sing about lost, lifelong love. “It was a time we were all full of hope/Saw the future burning bright,” he sings. “Do you remember?” Now it’s the future. And all you can remember is when the Beatles wouldn’t use anyone else’s sounds, and when an unprocessed voice was enough. PARELES "
5c6384b53a125f5075c09624,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/12/theater/freestyle-love-supreme-review.html,"Upon arrival at the Greenwich House Theater to see “Freestyle Love Supreme,” the mostly improvised and entirely delightful hip-hop musical that opened there on Tuesday, you will be asked to turn off your phone and lock it in a Yondr pouch. There it will remain until an usher liberates it when the show is over, 75 minutes later. This is not an act of random persnicketiness. Nor is it meant as insurance against the possibility of a free-range Patti LuPone showing up to tongue-lash you for texting or taking pictures during the performance. The six-man cast of “Freestyle” is too laid-back for that; the vibe is more rec room than star chamber. But they do mean to bind you to a contract: In return for listening very closely to them, they will be listening very closely to you. You might think that’s true of any live show, but “Freestyle” makes the bargain more literal and thus the show more live. Its songs do not exist until, with your help, the performers create them before your ears. To be clear, though each song’s content is improvised, the formats predate this run of performances, sometimes by years. Conceived by Anthony Veneziale and created with Lin-Manuel Miranda and Thomas Kail, “Freestyle” had its debut in 2003. When I first saw it a year later at Ars Nova — with a cast that included Mr. Miranda, using the hip-hop handle Lin-Man — some if not most of the current numbers were already part of the repertoire. In one sequence I’ll call “Second Chance” (no titles are provided) Mr. Veneziale solicits from audience members stories of life events they wish they could do over. Having picked one, he and the crew proceed to create a mini-musical on the spot, first telling a comically exaggerated version of the volunteer’s story, then rewinding it back to the beginning before retelling it with a happier resolution. That much is unchanged. The tale itself, though, is always new and always a matter of luck. At the show I attended, the early one on Saturday, the story chosen was not, in truth, so fascinating: A woman trips while walking down Sixth Avenue on her birthday. I thought one of the other audience offerings, in which a woman falls into a Venetian canal, would have given Mr. Veneziale more to work with, but perhaps “Do I Hear a Waltz?” — which has exactly that plot — scared him off. In any case, he and Utkarsh Ambudkar and the evening’s special guest, Christopher Jackson, subbing for the regular cast member Andrew Bancroft as part of the show’s ongoing rotation, turned this banal slice of life into something hilarious, absurd and also moral: an oratorio on the theme of “digital health.” In their version, the woman falls because she is too busy Instagramming her birthday to enjoy it live with the relatives actually accompanying her. Also too busy to notice potholes. [What’s new onstage and off: Sign up for our Theater Update newsletter] Like everything in “Freestyle,” this story is told to a nonstop beat that sometimes had me worrying if the performers could keep up. After all, they were not merely speaking but also spitting constant rhymes (“mumps” and “humps”) and off-rhymes (“pencil” and “suspenseful”) that worked nearly as effectively as those in traditional, prefab songs. They are also improvising the staging. The most extraordinary part of “Second Chance” is the rewind, which like the similar section of the song “Satisfied” in “Hamilton” runs all the physical action you’ve just seen in reverse. But there is this difference: In “Freestyle” the performers can rely only on their instantaneous muscle memory. If the words and action are unfailingly surprising, the music is more predictable, mostly bluesy chords that allow the improvisers to spin out noodles of melody. (On Saturday, the rappers were accompanied on keyboards by Arthur Lewis and Ian Weinberger, while the astonishing Chris Sullivan provided additional sound effects with just mouth and microphone.) Even so, when the lyrics and melody land in the same emotional place at the same moment, the sensation of great depth is like that of any good song, multiplied here by the difficulty factor. It’s useless to point out highlights that will never recur but, for me, “Freestyle” paradoxically soared when it took a breather from its giddy high spirits. A number I’ll call “True” spins what Mr. Veneziale tells us are completely factual reminiscences from a word suggested by the audience. The word “Mom” prompted Mr. Jackson, an original “Freestyle” performer and more recently a star of “Hamilton,” to thank his for not killing him despite his terrible misbehavior as a youngster; Mr. Lewis sang an impromptu lament for his, who recently died. Under the direction of Mr. Kail, who also directed “Hamilton,” “Freestyle” is loose enough to permit such moments — or maybe smart enough to head directly toward them. And yet it is also, within the limits of improv, extremely tight, so that you never worry you will wind up watching the cast fall into a pothole (or canal), unless intentionally. This is partly the result of an ideal mix of personality types: Mr. Veneziale warmly upbeat, Mr. Ambudkar snarky-nerdy, Mr. Sullivan impish and explosive, Mr. Jackson joyful yet commanding. (Other guest stars scheduled to appear before the mostly sold-out show closes on March 3 include James Monroe Iglehart, Daveed Diggs and Lin-Man himself.) But the real secret of the show is the cast’s commitment to deep attentiveness. Words and phrases called out by the audience, even those you thought had been discarded, whirl back into the narrative repeatedly, with all the punch of reprises. You have been heard! So when the usher unlocks your phone from the pouch, you may feel as I did: strangely uninterested in turning it on. That’s digital health indeed. "

Let us know at theplaylist@nytimes.com and sign up for our Louder newsletter, a once-a-week blast of our pop music coverage. Quiet, nightmarish and nursery-rhyme catchy, Billie Eilish’s “Bury a Friend” is matter-of-fact about mourning’s connection to death wish: “Bury a friend/I want to end me.” The video, her creepiest yet, is not for the needle-phobic; the song on its own is unflappably ominous. Its beat is a muffled but brisk electronic shuffle; her voice, moving in and out of electronic effects, is detached and crisply rhythmic, as she wonders, “Why aren’t you scared of me/Why do you care for me?” Another line from the song supplies the title of the debut album she just announced: “When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?” JON PARELES YBN Cordae is one of the most promising young technicians in hip-hop. It’s little surprise, then, that his song celebrating women from various parts of the country (and the world) — his own version of Ludacris’s “Area Codes” — is lighthearted and a little crude, but also lyrically clever, just sharp enough to make the bawdiest moments go down easy. JON CARAMANICA Perky turns menacing — and “fashionista” becomes a three-syllable word — in “Fashionista” by the Japanese group Chai; its first album was “Pink” in 2017, and this is from its coming one, “Punk.” Sing-chanting over a strutting bass line — like the Spice Girls, but switching between English and Japanese — Chai’s voices rattle off thoughts on applying makeup to “get it all sexy” before declaring, in a cloud of backup vocals, “We are fashionista!” By the end of the song, dissonant guitar chords have surfaced, the beat is crashing and ricocheting around, and that cloud of voices has turned into a typhoon: a party out of bounds, or a consumer revolt? PARELES Here’s a track that thumps, blips and hisses its way toward the limbic system, while a filtered voice urges, “Get loose to the rhythm of the drum.” Paradoxically, amid all those programmed beats and swoops, I don’t hear an actual drum. PARELES A hard smack of good cheer from the Lil Peep archives, which still hold a bounty of collaborations with his good friend, the D.I.Y. sing-rap innovator iLoveMakonnen. Much like iLoveMakonnen’s underappreciated 2017 single “Love,” “I’ve Been Waiting” has some 1950s guilelessness at its core, blended with 1980s pop optimism. What’s striking here is how intuitive a melodist iLoveMakonnen is — Lil Peep smear-sings the chorus, while iLoveMakonnen sounds jubilant even though the sentiment leans dark. Patrick Stump of Fall Out Boy, the guest of honor, finds a welcome home for his tight yelps — he sounds anxious, as always, but also happy to be here. CARAMANICA The South African rapper Yugen Blakrok, who made a quick appearance on the “Black Panther” soundtrack album, has a full album out today, “Anima Mysterium.” In “Picture Box,” she confronts media distortion and “horrific daily news” that’s “spewing words without content/spoken out of context,” and she summons mystical remedies. Her voice is low and insistent, in a thick, trudging, orchestral track that faces burdens with tenacity. PARELES “Despacito” taught Luis Fonsi to breathe. For almost two decades, he’d been among the more powerful vocalists in Latin pop, but he rarely allowed himself to find a pocket, a groove, and reside there peacefully. So what’s notable about “Vida,” his new album, is how he leans back from his vocal authority and finds ways to dole it out carefully, like on the lilting guitar caresser (with extremely light EDM flickers) “Poco A Poco.” “Vida” is, shockingly, Fonsi’s first album following the globe-smashing success of “Despacito,” released two years ago. Both versions are here — the original, and the remix with Justin Bieber — and, it should be said, they still go hard. CARAMANICA Allison Miller was aboard the New York subway while she wrote most of the tunes on “Glitter Wolf,” her fifth album with Boom Tic Boom, something that shows through in the music. These pieces have the sturdy, thwacking power of so much of Miller’s drumming — which is equally informed by punk and jazz — and the jostling momentum of an M.T.A. car on the move. Miller writes melodies with purpose, and many of the tunes on the LP seem destined to stick with you, perhaps none more than “Daughter and Sun.” It starts off as a romp, its swinging melody nodding to Ornette Coleman in one moment, and Middle Eastern maqam in the next. The sextet slowly dissolves until all we’ve got left is Miller alone. She picks up the pieces, playing a drum solo that coheres into a powerful rumble, and sends us back to that joyful melody. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO White Denim, a long-running band from Austin, loves the impact of garage rock, the melodies of pop and the musical and verbal intricacies of prog rock. “NY Money” is nearly seven minutes of perpetual motion, semi-sequiturs and two-chord (the intro has three) Minimalist obsessiveness. It hurtles through thoughts of drugs, death, self-renewal, disappearance, a gaptoothed waitress and high finance without ever losing its limber momentum. PARELES Paul Webb, who was the bassist in the 1980s band Talk Talk, first recorded as Rustin Man in 2002, on a duo album with Beth Gibbons of Portishead. The sequel, 17 years later, is the Rustin Man album “Drift Code,” and it’s a throwback to the post-psychedelic British prog rock of the late 1960s and early 1970s — particularly Soft Machine and its bemused, melancholy singer, Robert Wyatt. “Judgment Train” is a bluesy, jammy, wah-wah-loving railroad ride toward an unknowable afterlife. PARELES Two sound-worlds meet on this track from “An Attempt to Lift the Veil,” a duet album by Jim Jarmusch, on electric guitar, and Jozef van Wissem, on lute. One is a loud, constantly evolving yet somehow meditative feedback drone; the other is a handful of laconic, minor-key motifs on lute. One is clangorous, amorphous, psychedelic, the other consonant, neatly contained and semiclassical. Somehow, they harmonize. PARELES "

Romeo Santos’s “Utopia” is a luscious new album of collaborations with bachata stars of various generations (though notably, none who emerged after Santos became a solo phenomenon). But while there are standout performances from Raulin Rodriguez and Monchy & Alexandra, among others, the most anticipated song is “Inmortal,” on which Santos reunites with his bandmates in Aventura, the foursome that modernized bachata in the 2000s and hasn’t released new music in eight years. “Inmortal” is lithe and lovely — the group’s taut dynamic is still rooted in the formidable pair of Lenny Santos on guitar and Max Santos on bass. (Henry Santos dips in and out on background vocals.) Romeo sings like a matador — commanding but also sly, weaving in and out of the forefront at will. Like the rest of this album, “Inmortal” argues that even as the music Aventura spawned mutates ever faster, there is still comfort in how it used to be. JON CARAMANICA Gil Scott-Heron, the visionary poet and musician who died in 2011, would have turned 70 this week. In commemoration, the Archives — a reggae band based in Scott-Heron’s onetime home of Washington, D.C. — has released the first single from a forthcoming album devoted to his repertoire. This version of “Home Is Where the Hatred Is,” a testimonial of bleak addiction, trades in the edgy anxiety of Scott-Heron’s scurrying original for a sedate, dub-reggae flow. But Puma Ptah, a vocalist hailing from the U.S. Virgin Islands, holds onto the lyric’s core sense of pathos and frustration. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO It’s more important that this exists than that it’s great. That said, it’s almost great. Conor Oberst takes the Jackson Maine part and aggressively deflates it — he turns the searching lyrics morose, and you sense he wants to yank the cadence down into the mud but doesn’t let himself. Perhaps that’s because Phoebe Bridgers is on deck, and she’s in ferocious form. If Oberst is stubbing the song out, she’s lifting it over her head in triumph. CARAMANICA Blissed-out but not blissful synth-pop from the Australian singer Hatchie, “Stay With Me” is viscous and shimmering, but also so lush it verges on the suffocating. Maybe that’s by design: “It’s no better now you’re gone/I feel nothing, I feel numb,” she sings, wallowing in ache as the dreamy music takes up all the air in the room. CARAMANICA “Titanic Rising,” the album released on Friday by Weyes Blood — the songwriter Natalie Mering — takes refuge from present-day dread in vintage sounds, reaching back to the late 1960s and the early 1970s. “Everyday,” a song about longing and fear of loneliness, moves from Beatles-style piano bounce and bass countermelodies to a chorus full of exultant vocal harmonies recalling the Mamas and the Papas. An orchestral buildup sounds supportive but then falls apart, leaving her unfulfilled once again. The video, directed by Mering, becomes a horror movie. JON PARELES “When the last tree has fallen and the rivers are poison/You cannot eat money,” the Norwegian songwriter Aurora warns in “The Seed,” an environmental anthem that seesaws between hopeful and baleful. She summons an orchestra and a multitracked choir to juxtapose the growth of a seed — “Feed me sunlight/feed me air” — with the forces arrayed against it. The outcome isn’t guaranteed. PARELES Composure on the surface, passion and turbulence flaring within: That’s what happens in the songs on Ioanna Gika’s new album “Thalassa,” released on Friday. In “Out of Focus,” stately electric-piano chords pace a sustained but odd-angled melody: “All I was, was wanting you,” she confesses as it begins. But nervous, double-time drums and electronics are already creeping in, soon to swell with voices and instruments, as she realizes this romance is crumbling: “Holding on to history/love, the absentee.” The melody stays clear and aloft; the hope plummets. PARELES “The Who Sell Out” was a 1967 concept album, an imaginary pirate-radio broadcast that placed new Who songs between the band’s own mock commercials. Now it’s a just throwaway reference — “Im’a sell out like the Who” — for Barrington DeVaughn Hendricks, the rapper and utterly unpredictable producer who records as Jpegmafia. His casual boasts are by far the most commonplace part of this track, a glimmering assemblage of looping keyboards, comic interruptions and plaintive melodic fragments of song from the electronic-pop singer Eyas: “I’ll dream again, or will I?,” she muses, in promising non sequiturs. PARELES In just two and a half minutes, “Tirata Tiratata” demonstrates the depth of Anat Fort’s talents as a pianist, and the synergetic range of her trio (Gary Wang on bass and Roland Schneider on drums), which is celebrating its 20th year together. Fort skids around the keyboard in quick, truncated lines, using jagged chords in the left hand to slice up her momentum even as the group’s energy continues to rise. With the trio tumbling toward a release, Fort remains governed by a deep sense of poise and a luminous touch. RUSSONELLO The 12-minute title track of Christian Fennesz’s new album, “Agora,” his first solo release in five years, conjures elemental forces in limitless space: vast washes of sound that materialize slowly out of nowhere and transform themselves from noise to tone and back again, perceptible sometimes as chords and sometimes as abstract sound. They work on their own time frame, hinting at something that dwarfs mere human scale. PARELES "

The Tom Petty archives keep yielding more, like this previously unreleased song about media posturing that rings true in 2019. Tersely and unhurriedly, he rejects posing for magazines or video — and by extension, if he were still alive, social media — to insist, “It was all that rang true/I did it for real and I did it for you.” The arrangement, even though it’s with a full band, is clearly preliminary. If Petty, who died in 2017, had finished it for an album, it would have had more gleam and filigree. But the emotion is irrevocable. JON PARELES Alicia Keys has recorded indelible women’s empowerment songs like “Girl on Fire” and “Superwoman.” But she also understands that changes in gender roles are complicated and constantly in flux — particularly for the mother of two sons. “Raise a Man,” whose co-writers include Terius Nash (The-Dream), is deliberately blurred in every way. It shuns crisp hooks for rippling, improvisational vocal lines; it loops through unresolved chords played by a cloudy string section. It’s a confession of love as vulnerability and connection: “Is it O.K. that I’m not independent?” she sings, “Is it O.K. that I show weakness?” But it’s also clear that she expects equal openness and respect from her partner: “I want what’s coming to me: perfection, protection.” PARELES Pomp and camp, all rolled into one barnstormer. The title track from Lizzo’s forthcoming album is ecstatic, comedic, bawdy and tragic, toggling between powerful blues-soul singing and jubilant, swinging rapping to convey emotion that’s serious and also so unexpected it can’t help but be sort of a laugh, too. JON CARAMANICA “Please Me” begins with all of the R&B from 1990 to 1993 compressed into a rock-hard diamond — signature Bruno Mars nostalgia. Then Cardi B arrives, fresh off her best rap album Grammy win, with her customary saucy salaciousness. Mars grooves and flirts, and Cardi barks demands; even though they had success last year with their first collaboration, the remix of Mars’s “Finesse,” they’re an unlikely pair. Mars is about precision, and Cardi expands to fill the space she’s given, and then some. On this song, the mood is a tug-of-war: breathe fast, then relax, then breathe fast again, then relax. And then it’s done. CARAMANICA Post-punk thrust, math-rock patterns and splintered lyrics mirror the daily dystopian media barrage in “On the Luna,” from “Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost — Part 1,” due March 8, the first of two Foals albums promised this year. Guitar and synthesizer parts overlap in dizzying stereo counterpoint as the 9/4 meter keeps things off-balance; Yannis Philippakis casts himself as a baby boomer singing about childhood memories and present-day regrets. “We had it all and we didn’t stop to think about it,” he realizes. PARELES Les Claypool, from Primus, and Sean Lennon reclaim Beatles (and Monty Python) psychedelia to set out the biography of Jack Parsons, a rocket-science luminary (at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory) who was also a devotee of Aleister Crowley’s Ordo Templi Orientis and its “sex magick” rituals. “Better be careful boys,” Lennon sings. “You just might set the world on fire.” The keyboard tones echo “Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds,” while the extended vocal-harmony coda (singing Crowley’s precepts “Do what thou wilt” and “Love is the law”) hints at “I Want You (She’s So Heavy).” And the video, paying homage to Terry Gilliam’s animations, makes clear just how phallic rockets are. PARELES Nubiyan Twist, a 12-piece band of young Londoners, sources its inspiration widely, from the Caribbean to the Bronx to Central Africa. The group’s guest on “Addis to London” is Mulatu Astatke, the pioneering Ethiopian vibraphonist, another eclectic thinker, who has studied music around the world, and was never content to espouse the traditional sounds or popular music of his homeland. At the start of this track he’s heard explaining the West African roots of the rhythm the band’s about to play. But the sounds of his native country are in there, too, particularly in the tilted minor mode of the harmonies. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO Mortality looms patiently over the folk-rock of “Time Is the Killer.” Rain Phoenix, the sister of the actors Joaquin and River Phoenix, sounds artlessly natural as she sings “Everybody’s lying when we say we’re not afraid,” over a modestly strummed acoustic guitar and a brushed-drums, reverb-laden folk-rock band. Michael Stipe’s occasional backup vocals arrive with fatherly sympathy. The tranquillity is stoic, far from oblivious. PARELES Most likely, you’ll go into a Sons of Kemet show looking forward to Shabaka Hutchings’s tenor saxophone, and you’ll leave buzzing about Theon Cross’s tuba. More than Hutchings, more than its double drummers, it is Cross’s thick, molten playing that pumps life into the upstart British jazz group. Now he is releasing his own album, “Fyah,” full of slamming, dancehall-influenced club tracks, driven by the fireworks between Cross and the drummer Moses Boyd. One piece that sticks out is the chiller “Ciya” — with Cross creating a seductive loop underneath as the alto saxophonist Nubya Garcia and the trombonist Nathaniel Cross, the bandleader’s brother, whisper a gentle sough of a melody. RUSSONELLO Working toward self-forgiveness after a divorce, “Moral of the Story” seesaws between fragility and pomp: from Ashe’s quavery high voice and parlor-song piano tinkling to a hefty, lurching beat and a massed chorus. “People fall in love with the wrong people sometimes,” she tells her mother and her lawyer in the verses. Behind the brave face, there’s still some regret. PARELES The new Avril Lavigne song “Dumb Blonde” — full of blunt horns, hard-slap percussion and lyrics sung in a voice that sounds computer generated — is so chaotic, cluttered and unnatural that when Nicki Minaj arrives two minutes in, she’s a calming force. That said, Minaj’s verse is tepid and tossed-off — perhaps as a reaction to the mayhem that precedes it, or perhaps because she knows well enough when a song will fade into the ether, and no one will remember anyway. CARAMANICA No. Just: no. PARELES Wadada Leo Smith rarely plays the trumpet on “Rosa Parks: Pure Love. An Oratorio of Seven Songs,” a 72-minute suite he composed for an ensemble that’s really many groups in one: three vocalists, four stringed instruments, four trumpets (including Smith), and a duo featuring drums and electronics. On “Rosa Parks: Mercy, Music for Double Quartet,” the strings and brass come together, stretching paper-thin but steely melodies across a lot of open space. Smith states in the press materials that the oratorio is dedicated to a woman “of exceptional courage and wisdom, who made the right move of resistance at the right time.” In that sentence you can almost hear Smith’s music: His slow, deliberate horn playing often sounds like a practice of resistance, and he always knows the right time to act. RUSSONELLO It’s easy for Matthew Shipp’s pelting, centrifugal piano improvisations — full of hard dashes, often in contradictory directions — to feel strident and strong. It’s a bigger feat when he plays toward an emotional middle-range, and on “Flying Saucer” (from a new album, “Signature”) he achieves it, staying around the center of the keyboard, sounding impatient but unruffled. It’s a joy to follow his ardent, two-handed flow, unfolding like a well-told surrealist narrative, and his joyful interactions with the bassist Michael Bisio and the drummer Newman Taylor Baker.

5c618c753a125f5075c0915e,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/11/arts/music/grammys-moments-best-worst.html,"The 61st annual Grammy Awards on Sunday worked to right the wrongs of the past few years’ ceremonies, where the leading narrative was tension over a lack of diversity and poor representation for the most influential young artists in music. Big stars still stayed home — and one of the biggest got cut off mid-speech — but the show corralled a former first lady and delivered many messages of inspirational uplift. Here are the highlights and lowlights as we saw them: Of all the major-category nominees at this year’s Grammys, none were more surprising than Brandi Carlile, the 37-year-old folk-rock — or rockin’ folk — singer and songwriter who earned six nods, including album of the year. But when she appeared on the Grammys stage, things became clear. Her performance of “The Joke,” a defiant anthem about tolerance, was genuinely startling (and vastly superior to the album version). Carlile’s vocals were robust, ragged, full of sneer and hope. On a night curiously light on impressive singing, it was an uncomplicated, genuine, cleansing thrill. JON CARAMANICA [Hear our pop music team break down the Grammy highs and lows.] Drake, who pointedly did not perform on Sunday night, claimed just his fourth Grammy in 42 tries — best rap song for “God’s Plan” — and he deigned to show up to accept it, taking the winner’s podium for the first time. (His previous awards were not televised, and he’s even clowned the show for giving “Hotline Bling” the best rap song trophy in 2017 “maybe because I’ve rapped in the past or because I’m black,” he said.) This time, he pulled a Fiona Apple and told the world it didn’t matter: “We play in an opinion-based sport, not a factual-based sport,” he said, seemingly legitimately nervous. “This is a business where sometimes it’s up to a bunch of people that might not understand, you know, what a mixed-race kid from Canada has to say, or a fly Spanish girl from New York, or anybody else, or a brother from Houston.” It was part motivational speech, part rebuke of gatekeepers, and all Drake, the most famous guidance counselor in the universe. “The point is, you’ve already won if you have people who are singing your songs word for word, if you’re a hero in your hometown,” he added. “You don’t need this right here, I promise you.” But when he gathered his breath to finish the sentiment, the show cut to commercial. Drake was not seen at the Grammys again, and given how hard it was to get him there in the first place, he might not be for a while. JOE COSCARELLI [Want to be heard during the Grammys? Maybe stay home, our critic writes.] If the tensions at last year’s ceremony left the Grammys in knots, Alicia Keys was a CBD oil rubdown: a soothing, self-assured earth mother prepared to “Kumbaya” the show into a place of solidarity and affection. “Do you feel that love in the building?” she announced at the top of the ceremony. “This is love, this is life, this is living, this is light, and all because of music.” She brought out Lady Gaga, Jada Pinkett Smith, Michelle Obama and Jennifer Lopez to speak about music as a vessel for empowerment and empathy. She twirled in a variety of outfits. She joked around with John Mayer and harmonized with Smokey Robinson. She had already logged oodles more screen time than any host in recent memory when she perched on a stool between two grand pianos and played one with each hand in a demonstration of technical badassery, then took a tour through songs she wished she had written (Roberta Flack’s “Killing Me Softly,” Juice WRLD’s “Lucid Dreams,” Kings of Leon’s “Use Somebody”), wrapping on her own Jay-Z collaboration “Empire State of Mind” like a humblebrag come to life. But she still ended the show on a note of grander uplift: “Let’s keep listening and loving each other.” CARYN GANZ [At a ceremony dominated by female performers and presenters, women took center stage.] Flanked by younger admirers for a patchwork tribute, Dolly Parton easily held her own, with her voice still twangy, feathery and persuasive. The start was shaky: Kacey Musgraves too tentative and Katy Perry too vehement before Parton righted the tone of “Here You Come Again.” Miley Cyrus made an admiring rival in “Jolene,” and Cyrus shared three-part a cappella harmony with Parton and Maren Morris in “After the Gold Rush,” a Neil Young song Parton has recorded with Linda Ronstadt and Emmylou Harris. Little Big Town gave Parton an arena-country buildup in the story-song “Red Shoes,” from the 2018 “Dumplin’” soundtrack, before the female-solidarity finale, “9 to 5,” in which Parton made sure to praise her recent songwriting collaborator and producer, Linda Perry, who was leading the band. Parton was all smiles, and all gumption. JON PARELES For a show that has traditionally shunted aside Latin music (leaving it to the Latin Grammys, a separate event altogether) — and has yet to really acknowledge the rising urbano wave — Camila Cabello’s opening number covered a lot of ground. Sure, it was centered around “Havana,” a No. 1 pop hit, but Cabello’s Cuba-via-Miami roots shone through, and she also managed to ground a performance that featured both Young Thug and Ricky Martin. (Guess which one was wearing diamond-encrusted boots.) J Balvin, the pop-reggaeton star from Colombia, popped up for an interlude of his hit “Mi Gente” — and held up a newspaper that read “Build bridges not walls” — while the Cuban-American jazz trumpeter Arturo Sandoval made himself heard throughout. For a show that’s traditionally a ballad-loving affair, the energy was welcome, as was diversity that didn’t just feel like lip service. COSCARELLI [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] Childish Gambino’s “This Is America,” the first-ever hip-hop song to be honored with a Grammy for song and record of the year, is fittingly self-conscious: rapped in clipped, referential phrases, with melodic sections and a smattering of uncredited ad-libs by some of the genre’s true recent innovators (Young Thug, 21 Savage, Quavo, BlocBoy JB). That none of them — including the song’s lead artist and writer, Donald Glover — bothered to show up and accept the trophy for the songwriters was also apt for a show that has long struggled with its handling of hip-hop, dating back to the first-ever rap award in 1989, when a number of the nominees boycotted. (Kendrick Lamar and Drake, the most nominated artists of the night, also declined to perform; the “This Is America” producer Ludwig Goransson accepted the second award.) But the first no-show led to an awkward dead-air moment as the presenters, Alicia Keys and John Mayer, shuffled around the stage, trying to figure out what to do next. One of Childish Gambino’s managers tweeted a shrug emoji. But what really underlined the sharp elbow of a nonappearance was that Glover did appear as part of the Grammys telecast, after all — starring in a cellphone commercial that aired more than once. COSCARELLI “Welcome to the Grammys,” Cardi B proclaimed one hour and 28 minutes into the Grammys, luxuriating atop a jewel-encrusted piano that would make Liberace blink. She started her performance of “Money” in a dramatic cape like a sexy vampire leopard, and ended it sporting a ring of feathers like the baddest peacock on the block. Her set of plush banquets evoked vintage glitz, but 20 dancers doing floor work, four more waving large fans and a flamboyant pianist — Chloe Flower — couldn’t steal attention from the main attraction. When she returned to the stage to accept the award for best rap album, she had switched modes: from swagger to heart. “I can’t breathe,” she said, struggling for a brief moment to organize her thoughts. An entire arena was ready to offer up their lungs. GANZ [See the full winners list.] During the 19-second fingerpicked introduction to the power ballad “Shallow,” Lady Gaga executed two full body hair flips, one side kick and seven exaggerated stabbing motions with her left arm, each punctuating plucks of Mark Ronson’s acoustic guitar. As she sang the verses to the song, the standout from “A Star Is Born,” she acted out seemingly the entire arc of rock stardom: drinking, doing cocaine and torturing a microphone stand. Lady Gaga is one of our most gloriously talented pop stars, and one of the most nerve-racking, because you never know when her tango with good taste will dip into disaster. In her attempt to make this performance of “Shallow” the most everything, she ended up with less. GANZ The first song on Kacey Musgraves’s album of the year winner, “Golden Hour,” is “Slow Burn,” a slightly psychedelic country ballad about how chill she can be — in love, in her career and just in general. Critically respected but largely ignored by the Nashville establishment, Musgraves spent most of Grammys night edging her way, patiently, into the spotlight. Her first appearance, to perform her song “Rainbow,” betrayed some nerves. As part of the Dolly Parton tribute, Musgraves’s hair had gotten bigger but she was still muscled over by a vocally pushy Katy Perry on “Here You Come Again.” By the time she took center stage to accept the show’s final award, though, having won best country album and then beaten out pop stars like Drake, Cardi B and Kendrick Lamar for the top all-genre prize, the Grammys had come to her, and Musgraves delivered a simple, effective moment of gratitude that showed just how easy she is to root for. In a room used to having the air sucked out of it by all sorts of try-hards and egomaniacs, Musgraves just let it breathe. COSCARELLI H.E.R., the shades-wearing singer, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist who won the Grammy for best R&B album, summoned echoes of Prince and “Purple Rain” with reverberating chords from her electric guitar as she sang “Hard Place.” Singers and a string section gathered onstage as the song moved into a gospel-charged crescendo and H.E.R. let loose more expansive, ever more soulful melismas. She wasn’t done until she had flaunted some wailing lead guitar and then eased the song back down, with poised dynamics at every moment — the kind of real-time musicianship the Grammys still hope to reward. PARELES Let’s say up front that Jennifer Lopez is a genuinely versatile talent — a spectacular dancer, an underrated actress, a person who sings. There are numerous ways she could have enlivened any number of parts of the Grammys this year, or any other year. Fronting a Motown tribute, however — yeah, how about no? Lopez did not appear to be singing live at any point during her six-minute-plus performance, to the chagrin of many online, and perhaps also to any of the dozens of R&B singers who could have handled these songs with verve and power. While the dance routines were strong, turning the music of Motown — which featured some of the most vital, urgent vocals in pop music history — into a Busby Berkeley routine was a swing and a miss. CARAMANICA It is nigh impossible to pay full tribute to Aretha Franklin, who had one of the most forceful, nuanced and outrageous voices of the last century. So Yolanda Adams, Andra Day and Fantasia didn’t go over the top on their version of “(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman.” The performance was taut — just three sharp vocalists delivering impassioned singing, paying homage to an icon while silently accepting there are shoes that can never fully be filled. CARAMANICA Miley Cyrus has never won a Grammy. She was not up for one this year. She’s only been nominated once ever. And yet! Cyrus came to play on Sunday, joining Shawn Mendes to make an unnecessary (sleeveless) duet a true power ballad, and then appearing again for a tribute to her godmother, Dolly Parton. Cyrus was loose, but focused; impactful, but not scenery-chewing, and, knowing her nonstop-ness, she probably wanted more. She could’ve torn up that cage with Travis Scott! She could’ve kept “Shallow” earthbound! She could’ve hosted! Bless her. COSCARELLI Some Grammy performances have little to do with music in itself. The recording business owes a lot to Diana Ross, who had dozens of No. 1 hits, turns 75 in March and is still touring this year. What she never got, with the Supremes or solo, was a competitive Grammy award; the Recording Academy came up with a Lifetime Achievement award in 2012. So when she arrived onstage in a regal, gauzy red gown, after being introduced by her grandson, her presence was enough. She got through the retrospective gratitude of “The Best Years of My Life” (despite an ill-advised upward key change) and an arm-waving singalong of “Reach Out and Touch (Somebody’s Hand),” as she strolled through the audience. “Learn, dream, unlock new doors,” she exhorted. “All is possible.” The standing ovation was a cumulative appreciation. PARELES Between a 2014 Super Bowl appearance with Bruno Mars and this Grammy Awards duet with Post Malone, Red Hot Chili Peppers have made themselves symbolic elder statesmen of excess. Excess was the thematic link for a three-part Grammy medley: Post Malone’s acoustic-guitar-strumming ballad “Stay” (recalling a lovers’ quarrel while he was “too drunk to talk”) followed by his singsong, self-censored boasts of overindulgence in “Rockstar” and then the Chili Peppers’ 2016 song “Dark Necessities,” which hints at addiction and self-destructive impulses. Post Malone’s self-satisfied self-pity coupled with the Chili Peppers’ we-can-still-do-this athleticism — the singer Anthony Kiedis ended up shirtless — all played like unintentional parody. Post Malone also made no mention of his collaborator on “Rockstar”: 21 Savage, currently detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. PARELES Janelle Monáe has extensive ideas about cybernetic control vs. sensual abandon; she also has old-school showbiz razzle-dazzle. She combined them all to perform “Make Me Feel,” a song that harks back to the Minneapolis funk of Prince and prime Janet Jackson. Flanked by dancers who were costumed as shiny automatons, she swaggered through the song with robotic twitches, hip-pumping carnality and even some moonwalking, adding a snippet of her gynocentric song “Pynk” and the admonition, “Let the vagina have a monologue!” She earned the mic drop that ended the song. PARELES The Grammys, structurally, still look like they could be filmed in the 1970s. The camera setups are fairly flat, and the performances are tightly controlled. So credit Travis Scott for taking a much-needed wrecking ball to the format. He began his performance with a coolly tempered “Stop Trying to Be God,” backed by James Blake duetting with Philip Bailey (of Earth, Wind and Fire). But then the scene switched: Scott reappeared inside a tall cage rapping “No Bystanders,” and was swarmed by dozens of ecstatic revelers, some of whom began scaling the cage walls. Eventually Scott climbed up, hopped over the top and landed on the outstretched arms of his faithful. For a show that likes to pretend music moves in one direction — from the stage outward — this was a welcome reminder that it can also go up, down, around, and explode in plain sight. CARAMANICA "

Let us know attheplaylist@nytimes.com and sign up for our Louder newsletter, a once-a-week blast of our pop music coverage. “Ill Wind” was a postscript to Radiohead’s 2016 album, “A Moon Shaped Pool,” released on a bonus disc but not, until now, to streaming services. Its very few lyrics counsel isolation and detachment for fear of provoking that “ill wind.” They’re set to one of Radiohead’s morose bossa novas, at first akin to “Knives Out”: a nest of minor-key counterpoint on guitar and bass. But then more layers arrive, fluty sounds and buzzy ones, swallowing the song before prettily fading out. What seemed like a sanctuary was a trap. JON PARELES More seemingly left field but in fact totally harmonious cross-genre collaborations in 2019, please. The young country star Kane Brown brings adds an earthy sincerity to Khalid’s soothing delivery of angst on this remix of “Saturday Nights,” and Juice WRLD drizzles his melodically sweet melancholy on Halsey’s impressively stern scold “Without Me.” JON CARAMANICA Adia Victoria, a songwriter from South Carolina who’s now based in Nashville, offers a terse taxonomy of breakups in “Different Kind of Love,” from her second album due next month. “Some of them I knew it best to hesitate/Some I’ve never seen again,” she notes. The setting seems retro at first: a hypnotic rockabilly shuffle with a hefty backbeat and plenty of reverb on the guitar, soon to be punched up by a saxophone section. But it’s not back-to-basics: extra guitars and other, more elusive sounds thicken the mix, as Victoria gets around to a classic, nonnegotiable demand: “Tell me, who do you love?” PARELES The pop-punk trio Pottymouth, three women who have been working together since their teens, confronts aging with a galloping punk-rock beat in — really, this is not a high number — “22.” Abby Weems sings, “Oh, 22 — I still do what I used to do.” And why not? Their speed and passion haven’t faded. PARELES Two Washington, D.C. trios that aren’t afraid to think and rock at the same time are returning this spring: Ex Hex’s “It’s Real” is due March 22 and Priests’ “The Seduction of Kansas” will be released on April 5. Priests’ title track is like a semiotics class set to an arty dance beat: the singer Katie Alice Greer flings around signifiers of American culture — Superman, Dorothy, Applebee’s — before repeating a vow that teeters between genuine and controlling: “It’s true, I’m the one that loves you.” Ex Hex, led by Helium and Wild Flag’s Mary Timony, start off with a surfy bop that glances back to the Ramones’ interpretation of girl-group pop. Their lips aren’t sealed. CARYN GANZ A stark stunner from Lana Del Rey, narrating as someone who’s “24/7 Sylvia Plath/Writing in blood on your walls/‘Cause the ink in my pen don’t look good in my pad.” The arrangement is minimal piano, haunting as an empty, dark cave. And Del Rey spins into deliciously morbid, almost absurdist lyrics: “Hello, it’s the most famous woman you know on the iPad/Calling from beyond the grave, I just wanna say, ‘Hi, Dad.’” CARAMANICA A random rebound hookup: That’s the premise of “Dancing with a Stranger.” It isn’t much of a duet; it’s more like a pair of solos telling parallel stories. “Look what you made me do/I’m with somebody new,” Sam Smith and Normani sing together, while they head off to separate trysts. PARELES The Weeknd is back to his louche ways on “Lost in the Fire,” the second single from “Hyperion,” the forthcoming album by the gloomy French electro-house producer Gesaffelstein. The mood is overcast 1980s Miami, and the singing blends empathy with eroticism. No one is better than the Weeknd at underscoring the trauma common to both. CARAMANICA The Texas bluesman Gary Clark Jr. announces that he’s “paranoid and pissed-off” as he charges into the title song of his coming album, “This Land,” declaring that he’s bought himself 50 acres “right in the middle of Trump country” and is braced for racist neighbors: “I see you looking out your window/Can’t wait to call the police on me.” All the tones are confrontational and raw: a distorted bass line, Clark’s not-always-in-tune lead guitar, his gruff voice, an underlying blues-meets-reggae riff. The video imagery invokes slavery, lynchings, Confederate flags and cross-burning bonfires. “I’m America’s son,” he taunts. “This is where I come from.” PARELES Here is the #MeToo movement in action, simultaneously methodical and melodic. The midtempo folk-rock behind Stella Donnelly’s voice doesn’t telegraph her fury, but she’s reading a self-defense manual and preparing to execute painful moves against someone — married, prosperous, powerful — who is acting inappropriately. “Are you scared of me old man,” she sings, “or are you scared of what I’ll do?” PARELES Kassa Overall’s new album — the irreverently titled “Go Get Ice Cream and Listen to Jazz” — attests to the diverse musical identity of this drummer, producer and rapper. It’s one of the few genuine-sounding, full-scope amalgams of contemporary hip-hop and jazz to surface in recent years. On “Who’s on the Playlist,” as the pianist Sullivan Fortner traces the chords to Miles Davis and Bill Evans’s “Blue in Green,” Overall, 36, daubs his snare drum with brushes, then adds a splatter of electronic percussion. He starts the track with a mumbly, ironic Master P quote before cracking a window into his heart on a verse that grows tensile and urgent before stopping up short. Judi Jackson, a young British jazz singer, shows that the interdisciplinary spirit is contagious — or at least, generational: She sings in an Erykah Badu purr for most of the song, then rattles off a cold rap verse. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO “Human,” an electronic instrumental by the Swedish composer Tomas Nordmark, has a meditative, nearly ambient foundation: sustained, consonant tones like distant horns. But the foreground is jittery, full of unpredictable, glassy tones that briefly hover, then disappear. Mood: inscrutable. PARELES "
5c5af6773a125f5075c084d9,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/06/arts/music/grammy-awards-preview.html,"Year after year, I have dutifully watched the Grammy Awards. And the next morning, year after year, I have wondered why. I’ll be watching on Sunday, when the Grammys air on CBS, but with thoroughly limited expectations. The Grammy show strives each year to keep up with what just happened in music and to ameliorate its past errors. But after a while, blundering along just isn’t funny anymore. Awards shows are thankless at best; there are invariably complaints about omissions and honest disagreements over winners. Meanwhile, the demands of network television are by no means aligned with the dozens of Grammy Awards that recognize music’s less commercial genres along with the grunt work of making recordings. (The vast majority of the 84 Grammys are handed out in a live-streamed ceremony before the prime-time television spectacle, which only squeezes in about a dozen awards between live performances.) This year, the Recording Academy is atoning for an unforced error by its outgoing president, Neil Portnow, who ends his term in July. In 2018, he responded to a question about the lack of women receiving televised awards on the show, in line with harsh statistics about the Grammys’ historical lack of recognition for women, by saying that women need to “step up” — apparently oblivious to systemic barriers for women’s careers, not to mention overt harassment. (He later said he regretted his choice of words.) Sunday’s reparations include having the impeccable Alicia Keys as host and a performance by Diana Ross — who turns 75 on March 26 and who, in Grammy annals, was given a lifetime achievement award in 2012 after exactly zero wins either with the Supremes or in her solo career. Women also dominate the lineup of the show’s other announced performers and are well represented among the nominees for major awards. However, several of those are collaborations with men, like the Bradley Cooper-Lady Gaga duet “Shallow,” Maren Morris’s lead vocal on “The Middle” with Zedd and Grey, and Cardi B with Bad Bunny and J Balvin in “I Like It.” The top categories — record (for the artist, producers and engineers), song (for songwriters) and album of the year, along with best new artist — have also been expanded from five nominees to eight, an easy way for the Grammys to claim more diversity. Selections like those should make the statistics look more equitable in, perhaps, a few decades. Music is the most nimble of mass-audience art forms. Now it can be recorded alone on a computer and released immediately online, and it evolves fast, constantly pulling in ideas from the cultural margins, whether that’s beats from Caribbean sound systems or murky, disconsolate SoundCloud rap. The Grammys’ mandate is to sift through the welter of music released every year, rewarding merit and recognizing innovation (though not, strictly speaking, from the past year, but from the preceding Oct. 1 to Sept. 30, which can make some nominations seem ancient). The Recording Academy, the organization behind the Grammys, was modeled after the Oscars’ Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences: tabulating votes from industry pros, both artists and technicians, presumably to add up to informed choices. But history has not been kind to the Grammys’ winners for album of the year. In 1967, Frank Sinatra’s “A Man and His Music” beat the Beatles’ “Revolver.” In 1985, Lionel Richie’s “Can’t Slow Down” was chosen over Prince’s “Purple Rain,” Bruce Springsteen’s “Born in the U.S.A.,” Tina Turner’s “Private Dancer” and Cyndi Lauper’s “She’s So Unusual.” And last year, Bruno Mars won the top prize over more adventurous albums by Kendrick Lamar, Lorde, Jay-Z and Childish Gambino. Recording Academy voters have been reliably stodgy and ballad-loving, at best befuddled and at worst wrongheaded. It often seems that the Tin Pan Alley holdouts whose Grammy votes regularly pushed back against rock — as late as 1995, when Tony Bennett’s “MTV Unplugged” was album of the year (leading to ridicule and the creation of a “traditional pop” category) — have been replaced by rock holdouts who are still suspicious of hip-hop. The Grammys have recognized undeniable blockbusters by black performers, like Michael Jackson’s “Thriller” and Lauryn Hill’s “The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill.” But they have snubbed paradigm-shifters like Beyoncé’s “Lemonade” (which lost album of the year in 2017 to a more conventional pop megahit, Adele’s “25”). In 2014, Macklemore & Ryan Lewis won best new artist and best rap album over the clearly superior Kendrick Lamar. (Besieged by criticism, the Grammys repented; Lamar has gotten multiple awards and nominations since then, including this year for the “Black Panther” soundtrack album, and he was the show’s incendiary live opening performer in 2018.) The 61-year history of the Grammys is tied to the idea of network TV as a monoculture, and the show once presented a rare chance for millions of people to share a live musical performance. Assured of an audience, the Grammys of yesteryear often presented classical music and jazz — non-popular genres — that have disappeared from more current, metrics-driven iterations of the awards. The show is flashier now, and more determined to offer end-to-end pop-star power. But in the era of on-demand music video and proliferating cable channels, the Grammys have lost any clear role as America’s TV musical centerpiece. And if the initial idea of a prime-time network Grammy show was that multiple generations could share the full spectrum of music, it hasn’t worked out that way. Instead, the Grammys come off as the older generation scolding the young, the entrenched trying to rein in the newcomers. I have long had a rule of thumb that the album that includes the oldest songs wins: Norah Jones’s debut album, Herbie Hancock’s “River: The Joni Letters,” Natalie Cole’s “Unforgettable … With Love,” Eric Clapton’s “Unplugged,” the “O Brother, Where Art Thou?” soundtrack. (This year, Cardi B could benefit from the oldest-song effect; “I Like It” is built on a 1967 Pete Rodriguez boogaloo, “I Like It Like That.”) In recent years, the show has touted unique collaborations, “Grammy Moments,” that try to suggest musical and historical continuity between eras; this year promises Post Malone with the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Too often, though, Grammy Moments have meant fading elders performing alongside up-and-comers who learned their “influences” on the TelePrompTer. The Grammys still have some redeeming features. In the non-prime-time, non-pop categories, a Grammy win can help sustain a career. The broadcast provides glimpses of music history in its lifetime-achievement tributes — its version of community service. And even in an era when musicians play on television from morning shows into late nights, Grammy slots hold a little drama; ask Adele, who was sabotaged by tech ineptitude in 2016. Music-business strategists have long understood that a memorable prime-time performance pays off while award snubs are soon forgotten, and this year’s Grammys should be a bonanza for H.E.R., a slow-burn R&B singer who’s an unexpected contender for top prizes and who will be performing. So yes, I’ll be watching. I’ll even click onto the preshow awards, which will be punctuated by an international lineup of live music including Fatoumata Diawara and Natalia Lafourcade. Just don’t talk to me the morning after. "
5cb1e2bc49f0eacbf1f83bc8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/13/arts/music/coachella-guava-island-donald-glover.html,"“Guava Island,” a new 55-minute film starring Donald Glover and Rihanna, was released as a limited-time free stream on Amazon overnight Saturday, during Glover’s headlining set as Childish Gambino at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. The mysterious project, which has been teased for months, features Glover as Deni, a singer hoping to bring the mystical island of Guava together with a music festival, while Rihanna plays his girlfriend, Kofi, and provides voice-over during a fairy-tale-like animated introduction about the fictional location and its valuable blue silk. Nonso Anozie (“Game of Thrones”) and Letitia Wright (“Black Panther”) also appear. With a plot involving exploited workers, the struggles of musicians and a society divided between red and blue, the film incorporates themes present in much of Glover’s recent work, from the hit FX series ""Atlanta"" to his viral, Grammy-winning song and video for “This Is America,” which is interpolated in “Guava Island.” [Read the NYT review of “Guava Island.”] The film was written by Glover’s brother Stephen and directed by his longtime collaborator Hiro Murai, who was also behind the camera for much of “Atlanta” and “This Is America.” Following its premiere on the grounds of Coachella on Thursday, and the Childish Gambino show on Friday night, “Guava Island” was made available for anyone to watch on Amazon for 18 hours starting Saturday at 12:01 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time; it will then be available exclusively to Amazon Prime subscribers. Shot in Cuba and inspired by the Brazilian crime epic “City of God” and Prince’s “Purple Rain,” “Guava Island” does not ultimately feature much new music from Childish Gambino — or any singing from Rihanna. The movie opens with a breezy unreleased number from Glover (“If the world ends/I think I wanna die with you”) and has elements of another song with the lyrics, “Maybe the sky will fall down on tomorrow/but one thing’s for certain baby/we’re running out of time.” It also incorporates alternate versions of recent Childish Gambino singles like “Summertime Magic” and “Feels Like Summer,” along with “Saturday,” which Glover debuted on “Saturday Night Live” last year (“God, this 9 to 5 just keep on killing me,” he sings). In one scene set in a factory, another character tells Deni that he hopes to save enough money to make it to America. “It’s different there,” the man says. “I heard people are their own bosses.” Deni responds: “This is America. Guava’s no different than any other country,” adding, “America is a concept. Anywhere where in order to make yourself rich, you have to make someone else richer is America.” He then leads a choreographed dance to the song that mirrors some of the music video. At Coachella on Friday night, Glover — who has thrown his own festival, Pharos — did not make a show of plugging “Guava Island,” though he did incorporate tropical imagery and sounds into his set. For one unreleased song, he cleared a section in the crowd to scream over a cacophonous burst of complex drum rhythms, bathed in almost-apocalyptic red lights. He also performed the still-unreleased track “Human Sacrifice,” which debuted in a Google ad during the Grammy Awards in February. Glover was overcome by emotion onstage while discussing the deaths of his father and the rappers Mac Miller and Nipsey Hussle. “What I’m starting to realize is all we really have is memories at the end of the day,” he told the crowd. “All we are really is like, data — you pass it on to your kids, you pass it on to your friends, your family.” “While we’re here,” Glover added, “feel something and pass it on.” "

But for a kid growing up in the immigrant neighborhood of Canarsie, it might have just as easily been a universe away. I grew up in the subway cars of Brooklyn, and graffiti was the wallpaper of my childhood. I would often trace the fluid lines of a black tag with my fingertips, feeling the wild stroke of a derelict hand that had dared to leave its mark on the world. These were the markings of a small, underground world written in code, performed in darkness and proudly criminal. What most citizens deemed vandalism, I saw as art. I didn’t visit museums. The only galleries I knew were the streets and subways of New York City where young kids sought immortality in an otherwise bleak world of food stamps and white bread. Graffiti as we know it today evolved from a specific time and place: N.Y.C. in the 1970s and ’80s. There are rival origin stories in Philadelphia, and cities like Chicago and Los Angeles had their own scenes, but I grew up here, the golden age of vandalism, and nothing else came close to that cultural electricity, which still resonates today. Everything started in subway cars, because everyone who was poor converged in those spaces and found each other, unrehearsed and unfiltered. Graffiti was the backdrop to an early hip-hop culture that was rising from the streets: breakdancing, bomber jackets, Adidas shell-toes with fat laces, Krylon cans and boomboxes. I heard kids spitting out rap lyrics on the train faster than I could think. I saw moves that defied gravity, with nothing more than a human beatbox for rhythm and piece of cardboard for a dance floor.  I knew kids who couldn’t read but who could throw down masterpieces in sketchbooks with a handful of Sharpies. Pioneers like Taki 183 gave rise to a generation of bomb artists like Dondi, Seen, Lee, Revolt, Phase 2, Sane, Smith, Lady Pink and countless others. They paved the way for artists like Cost, Revs, Shepard Fairey and Banksy, who are known and beloved the world over. But this was the city before Koch, before gentrification. Before graffiti moved into galleries. When crime here was climbing to all-time highs. There is no way to romanticize the era. Poor people committed crimes against other poor people. Drug dealers seemed omnipresent. The hopelessness lived in crumbling brick buildings and rat-infested subway platforms. Art was solace. I remember my friends swarming over every blank wall in the city with black markers and Krylons hoping their tags would stay up just long enough to become more than a blemish to be painted over. That maybe, it would last long enough to become Art. There is an undying paradox in graffiti that makes it the most tragic form of art — it is the act of being anonymous while simultaneously aspiring to fame. You are known for your tag, not your real name. Your identity is hidden, but your tag is everywhere. It is both profane and sacred. At its core, it is nihilistic. And that is why I love it. Because pretty food is the same. I am a chef and there is a connection between the permanence (or lack thereof) of food and street art. When the culture of graffiti I grew up with died out at end of the ’80s, I longed for something as sublime and as useless as spraying art on a wall. I found it on a porcelain plate in a French kitchen. I found a tribe of derelicts who were unhinged and passionate and nocturnal. There is an insanity to the number of hours spent over a stove to create a plate of food that will disappear in mere minutes. It’s not logical. But we do it anyway. We live for the few people out there who will truly get it. It means the world to us. To the rest of society, we are as anonymous as that fool who scrawled an illegible word on the back of a subway car. Edward Lee, the author of “Buttermilk Graffiti” and “Smoke & Pickles,” is the chef and owner of 610 Magnolia, MilkWood and Whiskey Dry in Louisville, Kentucky, and the culinary director of Succotash in National Harbor, Maryland, and Penn Quarter in Washington, D.C.

5c6a03ed3a125f5075c0a329,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/17/arts/music/21-savage-ice-interview.html,"ALPHARETTA, Ga. — For the last four years, 21 Savage has been one of the stalwarts of Atlanta rap, a rising star who has collaborated with Drake and Cardi B, among many others, and become one of the signature voices in the city. His December album “I Am > I Was” spent two weeks at the top of the Billboard chart, and his collaboration with Post Malone, “Rockstar,” was nominated for two Grammys. With that success has come more visibility. In late January, he performed his single “A Lot” on “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,” adding a new verse in which he rapped about children being separated from their parents at the border. A few days later, early in the morning on Super Bowl Sunday, Feb. 3, 21 Savage (born She’yaa Bin Abraham-Joseph) was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, who said he was an “unlawfully present United Kingdom national” who had overstayed his visa. He remained in ICE custody at the Irwin County Detention Center in South Georgia until Feb. 13, when he was released on $100,000 bond. The next day, he was in a hotel room in a suburb north of Atlanta, surrounded by several members of his legal team. Dressed in somber all-black, he spoke at length about his childhood, his time in detention, the Grammy Awards ceremony he missed and how growing up without legal status shaped the person he became. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. Do you remember first arriving here when you were young? Yeah, everything was like, bigger. I come from the poor side of London. My grandma house is real skinny. So when we first moved here, we was living in the hood still, but it was, like, way bigger. The toilet size, the bathroom size, it was just different. But I fell in love with it. It’s all I know. Did you have a British accent? Yeah, I had a accent, ’cause my first day of school they was making fun of me so I beat somebody up, and they was calling me “taekwondo kid.” My mama whupped me, she made me stay in the house. So I know I had a accent, but I been here 20 years — I don’t know what happened to it. Do you remember when you became aware that your status wasn’t settled? Probably like the age when you start to get your driver’s license. I couldn’t never take driver’s ed, I couldn’t never go get a job. About that age. Was it something you wanted to get taken care of? It felt impossible. It got to the point where I just learned to live without it. ’Cause I still ain’t got it, I’m 26, and I’m rich. So, just learned to live without it. Like a lot of other immigrants. We struggled but we couldn’t get food stamps, we couldn’t get government assistance. I learned how to live without. You know in school, when you get to a certain age, your clothes make you popular? I learned how to be popular without that. People respected me just for me. Do you think the situation taught you to carry yourself a certain way? It made me who I am. I wouldn’t write it no other way if I had the choice. If they said, “Hey, you could start your life over and make yourself a citizen,” I wouldn’t have never did it. I still want to go through this right here ’cause it made me who I am, it made me strong. Were you aware that there was a possibility that at some point you might not be able to stay in the country? Yeah, for sure. It’s like my worst nightmare. That’s why it’s always been trying to get corrected. Even if you got money, it ain’t easy. It ain’t no favoritism, and I respect it, I honestly respect it. It would be kind of messed up if they treated rich immigrants better than poor immigrants, I think. How draining was it being in detention, especially with the uncertainty of how long it was going to last? It really wasn’t jail, it was the possibility of me not being able to live in this country no more that I’ve been living in my whole life. All that just going through your head, like, “Damn, I love my house, I ain’t gonna be able to go in my house no more? I ain’t gonna be able to go to my favorite restaurant that I been going to for 20 years straight?” That’s the most important thing. If you tell me, “I’ll give you 20 million to go stay somewhere you ain’t never stayed,” I’d rather be broke. I’ll sit in jail to fight to live where I’ve been living my whole life. I’m sure you were spending a lot of time in your head. I could have made myself go crazy. I think they really try to break you. It’s like we gonna put you in jail and we gonna make you fight your case the slowest you can fight it so that you just want to go home. Nobody want to sit in jail, especially if they don’t have the money to fight it and they ain’t been to court in three months. What do you think has happened in your life that gave you a different perspective? It was what was at stake. It’s like, I got three kids, my mama, everything that I know is here in Atlanta. I’m not leaving Atlanta without a fight. We gon’ fight all the way till the last day even if that mean I sit in jail for 10 years. Were you upset about missing the Grammys? Nah, I was stressed about getting out. The Grammys is the Grammys, but when you in jail, the Grammys is nothing. I got to watch it. By that time they had put a TV in my room. Was the original plan that you’d be part of the Post Malone performance? Yeah I was supposed to perform. He wore the 21 Savage shirt, so I felt like I was there. I don’t care what nobody say — everybody in that building who’s connected to this culture, I was on their mind in some type of way. That’s all that mattered. They didn’t have to say it ’cause everybody knew it. It was in the air. All the people that was there, they said the words in other places and that matter just as much. All the big artists was vocal about the situation, so I was appreciative. Even the memes. They didn’t stress you out? Some of them was funny — I ain’t gonna lie. I was appreciative of that. I coulda been another person who just, “He locked up? Damn,” and nobody said nothing. Some people, I see why they was mad. It ain’t about the meme, it’s about the bigger picture. But I done been through way worse things in my life than somebody putting me on a meme. I been shot — what is a meme? A meme is nothing. That’s something on the internet that I can do like this [turns over phone] and never see again. I look at bullet scars every day, so it’s like, a meme, bro? Do you feel a responsibility to speak up about your circumstances? Yeah, I feel a responsibility. My situation is important ’cause I represent poor black Americans and I represent poor immigrant Americans. You gotta think about all the millions of people that ain’t 21 Savage that’s in 21 Savage shoes. Do you feel an urge to put some of this experience into music? Not right now, ’cause I feel like me putting it into music got me in this situation, kind of. "
5c63ebd33a125f5075c096f5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/13/t-magazine/swizz-beatz-art.html,"HIP-HOP’S INTEREST in contemporary art is, by now, something of a cliché. American materialism has been at the center of rap lyrics since at least 1982, when Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five rhymed about stolen TVs and “double-digit inflation.” But long before Jay-Z was rapping about wanting “a Picasso in my casa,” before Kanye West was putting a Takashi Murakami on an album cover, before Kendrick Lamar was restaging Gordon Parks photographs in a music video, before Beyoncé, after having already paid homage to the Swiss video artist Pipilotti Rist in a promotional film for her album “Lemonade,” filmed another video with Jay-Z, her husband, inside the Louvre, before Drake cited James Turrell as an influence on the visuals for one of his tours in the same interview in which he said Jay-Z makes too many art references in his lyrics and claimed “the whole rap/art world thing is getting kind of corny” — there was the hip-hop producer Swizz Beatz, who had his first hit single in the late ’90s while still a teenager, and who used the money to buy an Ansel Adams photograph. Swizz Beatz, whose real name is Kasseem Dean, lives in a house in Englewood, N.J., that used to belong to Eddie Murphy. Its driveway is long enough that, after a taxi had dropped me at the front gate and I buzzed the intercom, an assistant had to come down in her car to pick me up. Just inside the foyer were a set of 1978 portraits of Muhammad Ali by Andy Warhol. In the living room were a couple of Gordon Parks photographs — one of a Harlem gang leader, from 1948, the other of Ali training in London in 1966. (Dean has the largest collection of Parks photographs in private hands, and some of them will go on view in a show at Harvard this spring.) There was also a Grammy placed inconspicuously on a coffee table. Down a long, glassed-in hallway, I arrived at an enormous white room where hanging on one wall was a 2008 Kehinde Wiley painting, 25-feet long and 8-and-a-half-feet high, depicting a black man in a green hoodie reclining in a position reminiscent of Auguste Clésinger’s 1847 marble sculpture “Femme Piquée par un Serpent” (or “Woman Bitten by a Snake”), which gives the painting its name. In the back of the room was a 19-foot-tall wooden sculpture from 2013 by Kaws, a rendition of the artist’s funereal Mickey Mouse figure, with X’s for eyes and disfigured mouse ears. That the work fit indoors at all seemed to be some kind of logistical miracle. “There’s no way I was going to put it outside,” Dean tells me. “What if it snowed?” This room, he admits, started out as a “man cave,” but once the Kaws sculpture arrived and the Wylie painting was hung, it turned into something more like a gallery. “They became like brothers,” he says. There is something about the home that doesn’t quite fit with its owner’s personality. It’s not exactly showy, though I also can’t bring myself to call an enormous sculpture of a deranged Mickey Mouse understated. And yet in person, Dean is soft-spoken and almost comically modest. He was wearing a cast when I visited him, a souvenir from the 40th birthday party that his wife, Alicia Keys, threw for him a few days earlier at the World on Wheels skating rink in Los Angeles. He tells me the story: Beyoncé was pulling off some elegant moves on her skates, and so he attempted a spin and fell hard, breaking his arm in five places. But the party had just started — all his friends had come out, and he knew his wife was going to unveil his present soon, and he didn’t want to disappoint anyone, so he downplayed the pain. Cracks appeared in this facade when Jay-Z wrapped his arm around Dean for a picture and the wincing response the gesture received led Jay-Z to believe that his friend may have seriously injured himself. Finally, the group gathered outside, where Keys presented Dean with her gift to him — a new Aston Martin — which husband and wife promptly drove to the hospital. Though he can be overwhelmingly humble, when I asked him how he thinks the hip-hop community became so interested in art, he responds, evenly and deliberately — just stating the facts — “I don’t take credit for a lot of things, but I will take credit for that.” DEAN WAS BORN in the Bronx in 1978 and was drawn to art from an early age because of the borough’s thriving cultural scene in the 1980s, where he was fascinated by the graffiti art on subway cars and in apartment hallways. He began buying art for the same reason a lot of people do: status, an image to project to the world. This worked better with some people than others. “I got laughed at for collecting” at first by some friends, he tells me, who couldn’t believe he was spending all his money on paintings, but it impressed the record executive Clive Davis, a collector himself, who went to Dean’s house and saw that he was different from other musicians and producers with whom he did business. What began as a tool to use in renegotiating his music industry contracts soon turned into a compulsion, then a passion and, by the time he married Keys in 2010, a lifestyle. Over the past 20 years, he and his wife have built one of the great American collections of contemporary art, and he has quietly become one of the art world’s most important power brokers, a singular advocate for artists in an industry that often exploits creativity for the sake of the bottom line. As he began collecting more seriously, he and Keys refocused their purchases on living artists, especially African-American artists — people like Nina Chanel Abney, Arthur Jafa and Deana Lawson — who are the primary focus of what he now calls the Dean Collection, and whose careers he learned he could help as a high-profile client of various galleries. One of his tactics, he tells me, is walking into a gallery to ask questions about one of their younger artists — often an artist of color — who maybe hasn’t had a show in a while, and if the gallery seems unenthusiastic and tries to sell him work by a different artist, he keeps pushing for the original artist he came to see, who often winds up getting a solo show as a result of his inquiries because he’s shown the artist has market value. This might seem like a small gesture — a collector advocating for an undervalued artist — but commercial galleries are, above all, the front line in an industry obsessed with profit, and the importance of this kind of influence, which puts the artist above the business, from a collector (often the greediest of all players in this comedy of manners) can’t be overstated. His goal has been nothing less than to “change the climate” of the art world, to shift the color of the artists on the walls of galleries and museums, which for most of history have been reserved for white men. “Because who else is going to do it?” he says. “Everybody goes into a gallery and sees what they can get for cheap and how to take advantage of an artist. I choose to do it the other way.” In the last few years, more and more artists of color have started to receive major exhibitions, with increasing regularity. This has been a positive development, but Dean also noticed an alarming trend of stories in the press speculating on black artists as the newest stars of the art market — or, read another way, as a kind of shallow currency that can reinforce the art market’s overarching greed: “I kept seeing write-ups saying this is what to buy, this is what you should do and all these business publications saying this is what you need to invest your money in, whether you like it or not.” Visiting a 2015 retrospective of Kehinde Wiley at the Brooklyn Museum, where Dean is a member of the board, he looked at the names on the wall labels of who had lent works to the show and found no black collectors. And yet the media continued to anoint black artists as the future of the art world. “If they’re saying we’re the culture, how are we gonna be the culture if we don’t own nothing from the culture?” he asks. After the show, he made a point of buying the largest Kehinde Wiley painting he could get his hands on, the one that now hangs in his house. The relative absence of major works by black artists in black collections proved the importance of having the hip-hop community become serious connoisseurs of contemporary art, and for years now, Dean has acted as an informal adviser in this endeavor. One of the people he has helped over the years (and who has since become a major collector himself) is Sean “Diddy” Combs, the music mogul with whom Dean has a longstanding relationship. He recalled going one year with Combs to Art Basel Miami Beach, one of the world’s biggest art fairs, where works are known to sell for seven figures within minutes of opening. A gallery was trying to sell Combs a substandard Picasso, “some lithograph,” Dean says, in a tone of genuine disgust. “And I just said, ‘You’re not buying that Picasso. It’s not happening.’” And Combs listened. “I told him, ‘That’s a bathroom piece, bro,’” by which he meant a less than desirable artwork you buy to hang over the toilet. “And the gallery was so mad at me,” he continues. “But it’s like, if you’re gonna sell him a Picasso, sell him a [expletive] Picasso! Don’t play around and misguide his purchase.” More recently, Dean helped facilitate Combs’s purchase of Kerry James Marshall’s 1997 painting “Past Times,” which shows a black family having a picnic in a scene that recalls Seurat. Dean spoke to Jack Shainman, Marshall’s dealer, about the history of the painting, and then took Combs to Sotheby’s to view it. Combs ended up buying the work for $21.1 million, the most money ever paid for a living black artist. “I thought it was important that that particular piece went to an owner of color,” Dean tells me. “It was time for us to step up to the plate and let the world know that we do own a piece of this market as well.” TO UNDERSTAND Dean’s true impact on the contemporary art world, one must first grasp just how unethical and ridiculous the art world can be. The best summation of this I’ve ever seen came from an email chain that was forwarded to me that was between a group of prominent artists, some of whose works regularly sell for seven figures. One of them was trying to sell a work he owned by another prominent artist in order to pay for an expensive surgery, but he didn’t want it to go to a particular collector who was known for selling works at auction for massive profits. “The auction thing is grotesque,” one of the artists remarked in the email. “But most people just think it’s fabulous. The art world is sick ... Now it’s been taken over by these Kool-Aid drinking greedy ugly immoral hedge-fund auction-house zombies and everybody is just so titillated as they follow the creeps off the cliff.” Auction houses are largely unregulated dens of inequity, where the identities of buyers — many of whom are actual white-collar criminals — is a closely guarded secret, the prices of works are marked up mostly for reasons of theatrics and artists receive no percentage of the sales, no matter that they created the works now making everyone in the room rich. (The law is different in the United Kingdom, where artists often receive a small cut of resales, but not in America, despite ongoing efforts among artists and various members of Congress; the California Resale Royalty Act, which ensured that in certain cases a seller had to pay artists 5 percent of the resale price, was effectively nullified last year, when a federal court ruled that the Copyright Act took precedence over the state law.) These auctions are in turn covered breathlessly by the press, which celebrates each record as some testament to the strength of our global artistic culture and not just an elaborate ceremony of people getting ripped off. Imagine a developer who buys shoddy houses at foreclosure sales, repaints them and flips them for multiple times as much money, frequently to foreign buyers who will never even see the properties they purchased, and you get some idea of how this business functions. The difference is that the profit margins at art auctions are much higher and exist for far more arbitrary reasons: Auction houses merely capitalize on trends in the market and in most cases aren’t investing in rehabbing paintings in the way a developer might with a house in order to increase its value. Dean, who has never sold a work in his collection (he’s only traded), is likely the first collector to argue openly on behalf of resale royalties for artists. Part of this comes from his background in music: He’s able to buy so much art — about 70 pieces in the last year alone — partly because he still gets royalty checks 20 years after producing DMX’s “Ruff Ryders’ Anthem.” (His other major hits include Beyoncé’s “Check on It” from 2005, Jay-Z’s “On to the Next One” from 2009 and T.I.’s “Bring Em Out” from 2004.) Artists in every other industry continue to collect money on what they create if it sells, except for visual artists, who simply watch as collectors flip their works to increase their own wealth. Even if American law doesn’t change — and there’s little hope that it will — “I think the answer is: Doing good for the artists should be a lifestyle,” Dean says. “It should be the thing to do. Not a charity. People feel like when they’re doing things for artists, it’s like a charity. The artists don’t need no charity from you! The artists just need respect. You should do it just because.” At a Sotheby’s auction last September, he gave a speech about the importance of giving artists royalties. This was enough to convince one collector, Joel Straus, who sold a Kerry James Marshall artwork (a study, in fact, for the painting purchased by Combs) for $1.8 million, to announce that he would give Marshall a percentage. This wouldn’t have been news if it weren’t for the fact that it was presumably the first time a living artist had received a cut from a Sotheby’s sale at its American headquarters. Dean has proposed sidestepping the law entirely and instead introducing an option for collectors selling a work through an auction house or gallery to simply check a box — yes or no (he’s been referring to it unofficially as “the Dean Choice”) — to indicate whether they’d like to give a percentage of the sale to the artist. He suggests that 3 to 5 percent is a fair commission. Shainman, Marshall’s dealer, tells me this is an uphill battle. Auction houses aren’t exactly known for doing things because they are morally right. (Neither are dealers, for that matter. Since the ’90s, Shainman has been one of the only American dealers to encourage collectors to resell works through his gallery instead of the auction houses, in part so that he can give the artist a percentage of his commission.) For Dean, though, ever the optimist, “we’re just one sentence of disagreement off.” “If you’re really a patron,” he continues, “and really a collector, you’re gonna say yes. And I feel that in the first year we introduce this option, 30 percent are gonna say yes. And then the year after that it will be 60 percent, and then it will just keep going up from there, and then we won’t even need a rule. It will just be the thing to do. People are gonna want to check yes because the artists will know if they don’t — if they didn’t do the right thing.” IF DEAN’S relationship to art is thoughtful, knowledgeable, careful and considerate, then his ideological opposite is Art Basel Miami Beach, which is held annually at the Miami Beach Convention Center and in satellite events across the city. I am not a spiritual person, but if the river Styx were so shallow that Charon had to drag by hand his boat carrying the departed souls into the underworld, one might have an idea of what it is like to walk up and down the length of Collins Avenue during these few December days. A mix of unapologetic corporate branding and a kind of neoliberal revenge fantasy in which no display of hollow wealth or drunken immaturity is too aggressive to be rendered off limits, this is an event during which I received emails informing me that, at a pop-up hosted by “Montauk hot spot the Surf Lodge,” “Brandon Boyd of Incubus has installed his personal, free-form, ambiguous kind of visual style that focuses on magic, serendipity, curiosity and mystery.” At the fair itself, I watched as a couple took a series of selfies in front of a Keith Haring painting, as if in flagrant disregard to the overwhelming sensation I was experiencing at the time that death is inescapable. It was against this backdrop in Miami Beach that Dean had organized the seventh installment of the No Commission art fair, an event he began in 2015, in which 100 percent of the profits from the artworks sold goes to the artists who made them. (Typically at art fairs and in gallery exhibitions, artists get 50 percent from the sale of a work.) This alone was a remarkable feat of kindness, made all the more significant during a week that seemed to distill contemporary greed into some kind of primordial vision of the concept itself. No Commission originated as Dean’s class project in the Owner/President Management program at Harvard Business School, where he earned a degree in 2017. The idea was to make something that would not only benefit artists but also be accessible to novice collectors for whom art fairs, not to mention galleries, are often cold and unwelcoming places. (There was, however, still a brand sponsor, as there is for everything in Miami: Bacardí.) Within the first minutes of opening, the shoe designer Christian Louboutin, hidden beneath a baseball cap, had bought three works. Dean posed for photos with some fans and then took a moment to admire a photograph by Jamel Shabazz, known for his street photography from the 1980s of people in Brooklyn and the Bronx, and the image of Dean looking at this picture seemed to demonstrate just how far he had traveled from the Bronx of his youth. He told me he was excited to see that, at the main fair, many galleries who are not known for working with artists of color had brought works to sell by black artists. The week had the same boozy self-indulgence, the same cheek-kissing emptiness of years’ past, but it also felt like something was changing, hopefully for the better. As he looked at the picture, I could see that there was writing on the back of his shirt. It said: “By the artist for the artist with the people.”  "

Yet in keeping with the excess unspooled in both, here they are anyway: two documentaries about the Fyre Festival — Netflix’s “Fyre” and Hulu’s “Fyre Fraud” — an event for which lots of young people paid lots of money and got nothing in return but international mockery. The movies have footage, guests, formal devices and sneering in common. Releasing one within spitting distance of the other is like opening a Walgreens across the street from a CVS. They’re different and the same. Even so, “Fyre” is fine. “Fyre Fraud” is better. “Fyre” hurls the swindle at its center like a bowling ball. The movie, which Chris Smith directed, finds the players in and around a 2017 scheme to pull a music festival out of thin air: software programmers, marketing people, expert event planners, laborers, the bilked. They make it clear that Fyre probably never could have been a success, and even if you know the story of how it wasn’t, nothing stops you from rooting against it anyway. It was conceived in both bad faith and bad taste, as part of a collaboration between Billy McFarland, a 20-something con man from New Jersey, the beached middle-aged rapper Ja Rule, and a fleet of Instagram influencers. [Read our inside account of the Fyre Festival.] Hundreds of people bought tickets to a party on an island in the Bahamas promoted, fictionally, as once belonging to the drug lord and murderer Pablo Escobar. They were promised a luxe weekend and got soggy mattresses instead. Each movie consists of talking-head interviews. But the meat of Smith’s movie is the footage, handsome footage — of meetings, conference calls and promotional shoots; of what happened when all those kids sought food, water and a desperate exit. You watch both movies in a kind of fascinated horror at how easy it was for McFarland to create a network of what appears to be unwitting co-conspirators to help him plan an experience that wound up losing $24 million. So many people mention how seductive and magnetic McFarland is that you also watch both movies expecting them to inspect his magnetism. To see him in Smith’s film, reveling in footage taken by other people — this chubby, gangly, awkward but not not handsome slouch who himself seems attracted to fame, power, wealth and sand — is to wonder whether those same people needed a magnet in their lives, especially one who could make them some money. “Fyre” needs another layer. You can locate in it this national moment of brashness and effrontery. (Even after McFarland has been arrested, as he was in June 2017, and released on bail, he cooks up another sham business. As you read this, he’s serving six years in prison after pleading guilty to wire fraud.) But the Hulu documentary, by Jenner Furst and Julia Willoughby Nason, does more than locate. It unpacks, analyzes and jabs. “Fyre” is an ethics thriller. “Fyre Fraud” is a behavioral farce. It has arguments to make about the insecurities of millennials and the perniciousness of social media. And the arguments don’t feel like blather. The sharpest parts of Smith’s “Fyre,” which is a co-production of Vice Studios and, apparently, Jerry Media, the marketing bros who helped sell the festival in the first place, are throwaway observations, like the one someone makes about how a single tweet of a sad sandwich demolished the image of a hot event that it took an armada of supermodels to help sell. Smith’s movie does have a devastating moment with a Bahamian woman still recovering — emotionally and financially — from the compassion she showed the Fyre flies who swarmed her poor restaurant. Both do a fine job of having Ja Rule incriminate himself on calls and in the media. But the Hulu movie is more comprehensively damning, in part because it goes farther with the cultural story and in part because the filmmakers have access to what’s missing from the other film: McFarland, who stonewalls and swivels through the tougher questions. The filmmakers reportedly had to pay him to do it. So the bad judgment extends even to the movies about the bad judgment. Nonetheless, reconstructing how Fyre burned a lot of people is not a small thing. I left Smith’s movie irked that it doesn’t attempt to show who McFarland was or to explain him as fully as it could. (His participation, paid but preferably otherwise, wouldn’t have been necessary.) I suppose it’s hard to get to the bottom of these pathological seducers. The makers of that trashy but effective new R. Kelly documentary series certainly had a hell of a time. In “Surviving R. Kelly” and Smith’s film, that void could just mean the real story is about the victims, enablers and suckers — or even about us. But when people in both Fyre movies say that they’re positive McFarland will strike again, what’s in order is the deeper, more cautionary examination of him that’s in “Fyre Fraud.” Not because that prediction is wrong. But because I wouldn’t put anything past this country. McFarland really might have another act. Maybe as a con artist. Maybe as someone more, I don’t know, elected. "

The first original song Sky Ferreira has released since 2013 veers sharply away from the armor-clad pop that filled her first album. But in a way, it’s a segue from that record’s ominous (and atypical) title song, “Night Time, My Time,” by way of the latter-day “Twin Peaks”; she produced the song with the music supervisor for “Twin Peaks,” Dean Hurley. A full minute of a dirgelike string-section instrumental — keening and quivering above, pulsating below — opens “Downhill Lullaby” before Ferreira comes in, singing a chantlike verse in a low, ragged voice: “You leave me open when you hit me/No one can hear you, then you hurt me.” She announced back in 2015 that her next album would be called “Masochism”; this makes clear why. JON PARELES From 1969-72, Joseph Jefferson led a Philadelphia funk band called the Nat Turner Rebellion, which released a few singles — including “Tribute to a Slave” in 1969 — and left an album’s worth of unreleased music in the vaults of Sigma Sound Studios. The first full Nat Turner Rebellion album, “Laugh to Keep from Crying,” has now been compiled by independent archivists and music-business students at Drexel University, which received thousands of tapes from Sigma Sound as a donation. “Tribute to a Slave,” a greeting across eras to the rebel slave Nat Turner, is vintage socially conscious, tambourine-shaking funk. Amid wah-wah guitars and assertive horns, it proclaims, “We ain’t slaves no more.” PARELES Cage the Elephant and Beck made a Twenty One Pilots song. (A good thing!) CARYN GANZ Recently, Lil Uzi Vert announced online that his career was on hold, if not over. What appeared to be a disagreement with his label seemed to be imperiling the release of any new music, including the long-awaited album “Eternal Atake.” In the last couple of days, however, there’s been some movement amid the uncertainty. “Free Uzi” — which his label said was not an official release — made its way to SoundCloud and YouTube, and displayed Uzi at his frenetic best: rapping about a woman “back on my team/ ’cause my neck wet like a squeegee”; alluding to issues with his finances; and confessing to watching “The Big Bang Theory.” JON CARAMANICA Rosalía’s first release since last year’s vivid and clever nu-flamenco album “El Mal Querer” is “Con Altura,” a sweetly melodic reggaeton number featuring a tart and restrained guest verse from J Balvin. The song is impressive, and the video, by Director X, is a riot of colorful outfits, flexible dance, and the confidence that comes with knowing every step you’ve chosen is the right one. CARAMANICA “Hustle” couldn’t bang any more bluntly; it’s three minutes of tightly packed pop escalation. “Don’t hustle me,” Pink berates a guy who “took my love/mistook it for weakness.” Then she restates the line with a blunter word that radio stations and this newspaper won’t use. The swinging beat harks back to rockabilly, and so does Pink’s belted-with-a-grin vocal, but the production expects a minuscule 21st-century attention span, springing a new sound — handclaps, backup voices, gunshots, bell tones, synthetic horns — every four bars if not sooner. It’s as meticulous as it is brash. PARELES Kelly Clarkson and Pink have been working in parallel for almost two decades. In 2017, when both artists had new albums (“Meaning of Life” and “Beautiful Trauma”) they teamed for a cover of R.E.M.’s “Everybody Hurts” at the American Music Awards. Now they’ve collaborated — along with Marshmello and Ed Sheeran’s “Shape of You” team of Johnny McDaid and Steve Mac — on a classic empowerment anthem either of them could have sung. It’s from the forthcoming animated movie “UglyDolls,” in which Clarkson plays a plush toy seeking self-acceptance. Perhaps in the future this duo of powerhouse vocalists and electric live performers will seek a co-headlining arena tour. GANZ As the influence of Nigerian highlife and American funk stretched across West Africa in the 1970s, different cultural traditions found their own ways in. In Benin, Sir Victor Uwaifo became known for rendering the ekassa — a rhythm and dance associated with the coronation of a new king — as a modern sound. On “IIziegbe (Ikassa No. 70),” horns and voices call back to him from across a bed of buoyant bass drum, played on every off-beat. This is one of 12 recently dug-up tracks, all from different artists, released Friday in the latest installment of Strut Records’ “Nigeria 70” series. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO “Put your makeup on, girl, stand up straight/Your face will take you farther than your brain”: The mother figure that haunts “Pretty Shiny Things,” the harrowing and beautiful new single from the country singer Kassi Ashton, is vicious and unapologetic. Ashton paints her with the savage acuity of Miranda Lambert and the lonely sorrow of Julie Roberts, which is to say she’s painful to listen to, but hard to ignore. CARAMANICA Bluesy, fingerpicked electric guitar, and not much else, accompanies Pink Sweats in “I Know,” from the new EP “Vol. 2.” It’s a love song with a streak of desperation — “There must a reason that you’re stealing my soul” — and with a high, mournful vocal, Pink Sweats resigns himself to obsession. PARELES This year’s carnival season in Colombia has ended, but two top Colombian bands extend the party with this collaboration that pools their strengths: deep dancehall-like growls from Systema Solar and the tart lead vocals of Liliana Saumet from Bomba Estéreo, entwined guitars that hint at both cumbia and Congolese pop, busily arpeggiating synthesizers and deep-dive bass lines, even some traditionalist Afro-Colombian drumming. “There will always be Carnival,” the song insists, working to make it true. PARELES Secret Machines, one of the best trios of the aughts, released a live album this week that was recorded in 2006 at the Garage in London. “Nowhere Again” is from the group’s thundering, ominous 2004 debut, “Now Here Is Nowhere,” but the band played it a bit poppier at this show shortly before the release of its second LP, “Ten Silver Drops.” A year later, the guitarist Benjamin Curtis left the band to focus on another project, School of Seven Bells. He died from lymphoma in 2013 and documents of his time in Secret Machines with his brother, the keyboardist and singer Brandon, and the drummer Josh Garza are very valuable. GANZ A tenacious 5/4 pulse propels “Crow’s Perch” through a slew of post-punk transformations in just four minutes: from muffled bass line through sparse, almost jazzy ballad, through brittle patterns and strangulated one-syllable vocal lines, through a briefly restrained spoken-word passage on the way to a crashing, shouting, dissonant peak. It’s math-rock confronting a world of chaos. PARELES Betty Carter was jazz’s quintessential modernist: She liked to tease and stretch a classic melody until it was almost misshapen, testing her elastic instinct against the structure of a piece. In this live recording, captured at Lincoln Center in 1992 during the heady final years of her career, Carter sings “If I Should Lose You” in duet with the young pianist Geri Allen. The accompanist treats the song with her own sense of passionate restraint, collapsing its harmonies at the center, as if to represent the song’s fraught, nearly fatalist romanticism. A record of the concert has just been released on CD by Blue Engine Records, Jazz at Lincoln Center’s in-house label. RUSSONELLO "

Just want the music? Listen to the Playlist on Spotify here (or find our profile: nytimes). Like what you hear? Let us know at theplaylist@nytimes.com and sign up for our Louder newsletter, a once-a-week blast of our pop music coverage. After a six-year gap, Vampire Weekend has re-emerged with a song that wraps misgivings in three-chord elation: first with folksy acoustic-guitar picking, then with gospel-rock piano and congas, later with jammy hints of the Grateful Dead. It all feels jovial until Ezra Koenig’s words register a not-so-oblique dread: “Anybody with a worried mind could never forgive the sight/Of wicked snakes inside a place you thought was dignified/I don’t wanna live like this, but I don’t wanna die.” Meanwhile, anyone seeking meditative sanctuary can click on “120 Minutes of Harmony Hall Guitar” — the opening acoustic guitars simply looping away, adding a modest drone for the second hour. JON PARELES The lyrics are cryptic, and so is the video, with images of armed men, surveillance screens, captive women and lessons in violence. But there’s no mistaking the urgency of Sam Fender’s desperate vocal, the rising refrain “He will play God” and the syncopated, reverberating guitar note that persists throughout the song, keeping things tense. PARELES Fresh from boygenius, her collaboration with Julien Baker and Lucy Dacus, Phoebe Bridgers has teamed up with Conor Oberst (Bright Eyes) as Better Oblivion Community Center, suddenly releasing a full album. It’s folk rock all the way, harking back to the Byrds, Bob Dylan and Ian and Sylvia, with shared lead vocals, intertwined acoustic and electric guitars and, often, a tambourine shaking along. Electric guitars surge and spill over in “Dylan Thomas,” as Bridgers and Oberst sing about power, entertainment and the elusiveness of truth. PARELES For this movie theme, Dua Lipa honors the plot of “Alita: Battle Angel,” a film based on a post-apocalyptic manga about a human brain resurrected as a cyborg warrior: “This is not a swan song,” she sings, “It’s a new life.” But she also ties it in to the female self-assertion of the rest of her catalog: “I won’t stay quiet,” she sings, her voice swelling, “ ’Cause staying silent’s the same as dying.” Backup chants sound like remnants of past civilizations; the beat is mechanized, cybernetic. The song puts human aspiration in electronic armor. PARELES Yes, that Snow. “Con Calma” underscores the endless cycles of borrowing that nourish pop music, messy and unlikely as they may be. In 1992, “Informer,” by the white, Canadian dancehall performer Snow, spent seven weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100. This was an outlier for many reasons, some less obvious than others — Snow had cut his musical teeth in Toronto’s Jamaican community. Over the years, “Informer” has remained, despite occasional mockery, the rare durable, credible example of a song by a white reggae performer. Now, in 2019, reggaeton titan Daddy Yankee, well into the neutralized-pop portion of his career, has built atop it a new song, which is enthusiastic and lighthearted, squeezing something just a little bit too tepid out of something which, in its day, had been the little-bit-too-tepid thing. JON CARAMANICA Agonized and serrated, the new song from Call Me Karizma revives mid-to-late-2000s Warped Tour electro-punk, blends it with emo instincts as refracted through SoundCloud rap, adds in heaping gobs of Marilyn Manson, and tops it off with, hiding in plain sight, a flicker of Yung Joc’s “It’s Goin’ Down.” CARAMANICA “Ecstasy” is an anti-manifesto from Sneaks, the singer, songwriter and producer Eva Moolchan. “I don’t wanna explain,” she whisper-sings, almost as if she’s humming to herself. But meanwhile she’s assembling blips, plinks, a buzzing bass riff, hovering electronic tones and casually intersecting vocal lines into a teasingly enticing track: she’s doing, not telling. PARELES Florence and the Machine almost — but not entirely — separate two threads of her music with a yin-yang pair of new songs. “Moderation” goes for a hand-clapping, room-shaking Motown-flavored rock-soul stomp — think Martha and the Vandellas — as Florence Welch scoffs at the whole notion of moderation in love. “Haunted House” turns inward instead. It starts and ends something like a parlor song, a piano waltz sung by Welch at her most decorous. But when the chorus arrives and she confesses “I’m not free yet,” she doesn’t hold back the buildup; moderation is, indeed, a struggle. PARELES As a collaborator and on her own, Julia Michaels has typecast herself as the queen of neurosis, and she’s true to that brand throughout her latest EP, “Inner Monologue Part 1.” In “Happy,” she sings, “Sometimes I think I kill relationships for art,” and adds, “I pay my bills with it.” A reggae-ish beat heaves and slams below her and a backup chorus joins her in her misery, but at the end, as she quietly moans “I just want to be happy,” there are crickets in the mix. PARELES A tsk-tsk masquerading as a chest puff, J. Cole’s “Middle Child” is the beginning of what he’s suggested is a coming onslaught of new music this year. The themes, however, are familiar: Cole’s love-em-but-needle-em relationship with younger rappers is present in full force. But unlike most elders, he’s also willing to paint himself as a student — hence, middle child. Which is why even though this song echoes mid-2010s Drake triumphalism (and also mentions Drake, for good measure), Cole cuts the arrogance with commitment to granular, almost mundane narrative. All tell, no show. CARAMANICA The saxophonist, flutist and bass clarinetist Eric Dolphy led just five studio sessions in his brief lifetime, yet he’s seen as one of jazz history’s great possibility-expanders — an improviser who squirreled away his masterful abilities under layers of evocative idiosyncrasy, packing his notes with more breath than they could fit, letting them bloom and quiver well beyond their natural pitch. Dolphy’s second-to-last recording session took place in New York in July 1963, with a midsize band, across two days, less than a year before his death at 36. It resulted in a pair of well-reputed albums, “Conversations” and “Iron Man,” but many assumed the complete session recordings were lost. The flutist James Newton — who had held onto a trove of tapes and papers that Dolphy left behind — recently turned them over to Resonance Records, which released 18 of the finest tracks from those 1963 dates on “Musical Prophet: The Expanded 1963 New York Studio Sessions.” Half were previously unissued, including this alternate take of “Jitterbug Waltz,” a Fats Waller classic with a frisky, twirling melody that’s oddly befitting of Dolphy. And mark the trumpeter: It’s the future jazz eminence Woody Shaw, age 18, sounding phenomenal in one of his first professional recording dates. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO Last year’s most awe-inspiring jazz release was “Emanon,” Wayne Shorter’s three-disc masterstroke, much of which he recorded live with his quartet joined by the London Chamber Orchestra. But unless you shelled out for the full boxed set, you probably haven’t heard it yet. Now the digital wait is over — on Friday, Blue Note released the album on streaming platforms. On “Prometheus Unbound,” we hear how skillfully Shorter marshals a string section; he uses the orchestra not only to add strength and harmonic layers, but also to give his wide, intervallic leaps a new dynamic momentum. RUSSONELLO Hearing “Trio Tapestry,” the first album from this all-star group, it’s hard not to think back on Joe Lovano’s work in the Paul Motian Trio, another bass-free combo whose history was entwined with ECM Records. Like Motian’s, the new trio’s music drifts slowly into the space around it, gently filling a room with worried air. But the biggest difference between the bands is in the tumbling, unsettled piano of Marilyn Crispell and the warmer, more diatonic guitar of Bill Frisell (the third member of Motian’s trio). On “Rare Beauty,” Lovano’s trio treats his sharp modal melody with a sense of unfettered freedom, moving loosely in and out of step with each other. RUSSONELLO Que Vola brings together three Afro-Cuban percussionists — all members of the Osain del Monte Orchestra — and seven French jazz musicians. The lead single from the group’s self-titled debut is “Calle Luz,” a quick, pattering original that reshapes a rumba rhythm around its jagged, four-horn arrangement. The West African roots of rumba come through in various ways here; amid all the rhythmic and harmonic complexity, you might even hear echoes of Fela Kuti’s Africa ’70 band in the sound of the Rhodes, bass and drums. RUSSONELLO Sage Fisher, who records as Dolphin Midwives, uses loops of harp and electronic sounds, and sometimes (though not on this track) her voice, to construct tracks that evolve from ambient Minimalism to something considerably more volatile. “Junglespell” starts out pretty and vaguely Asian, with rippling, overlapping harp motifs. But halfway through, an electronic vortex takes shape, in rhythm-disrupting clusters and miniature alarm bells; a pretty coda can’t soothe everything. PARELES "
5c51bbf63a125f5075c071bf,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/30/arts/music/grammy-awards-music-video.html,"Another year, another persistent worry that the Grammy Awards will once again fail to recognize boundary-pushing black performers. The nominations  are led by Kendrick Lamar, Drake and a crop of female artists — a promising shift after years of complaints about a lack of diversity at the music industry’s big night. However, nominations don’t necessarily turn into wins: Two years ago, Beyoncé was snubbed in the major categories; in 2018, Jay-Z received the most nominations of any artist and walked away empty-handed. But at this year’s ceremony, which will take place Feb. 10, there is one category in which the Recording Academy has nominated a surprisingly sophisticated set of performers, all of whom are black: best music video. (In addition to the artist, this Grammy is awarded to the video’s director and producer.) In the Grammy context, the music video category — No. 83 out of 84 on the official list — is generally an afterthought. It was instituted in 1984, the same year MTV inaugurated its Video Music Awards, just as the medium was becoming central to star-making. At this moment — when artists are as likely to develop their audiences on YouTube as on any audio-only platform, and in which expertise in self-presentation and self-promotion is mandatory — the category feels essential. The nominations recognize clips that shaped conversation as much as the songs they illustrate. Some of these videos are wholesale pieces of art in which the visuals and music are fundamentally inseparable; sometimes the importance of the video itself trumps that of the song. Childish Gambino’s “This Is America” and Joyner Lucas’s “I’m Not Racist” present competing narratives about the state of black life in this country. “Apes**t,” by Jay-Z and Beyoncé (recording as the Carters), is a lush fantasia about dismantling old power hierarchies. Janelle Monáe’s “Pynk” is a wild, psychedelic tour of female amorousness. And Tierra Whack’s “Mumbo Jumbo” serves a strong dose of surrealism. Of these nominees, “This Is America” was the most influential and revelatory last year, a stark, violent, ecstatic and darkly comic statement of intent from Childish Gambino, the musical alter ego of the actor Donald Glover. It was also the first music project from Glover that embodied the tension and savvy of his work in other mediums, particularly the television show “Atlanta.” In the video, Glover saunters, slides, shimmies and bolts his way through a warehouse. His body movements careen from the sensual to the frustrated — he is a performer, a pleaser, but one at war with those impulses, torn between delivering joy and extinguishing it. Sometimes he’s nailing dances from the Instagram Explore page or the video-sharing app Triller, but then he brakes hard, finds a gun and kills fellow performers offering less fraught forms of musical healing. “This is America/Don’t catch you slippin’ up,” he raps, setting terms for negotiating a white society that leaves barely any margin for black error. At the end of the video, as Young Thug sings, “You just a black man in this world/You just a bar code,” Glover runs directly at the camera — first in darkness, only the whites of his eyes and teeth visible. Then he emerges into the light, frantic, no longer in control. This burst of dystopian pessimism has a dim contrast in “I’m Not Racist,” which is almost grotesquely earnest and naïvely optimistic. It, too, takes place in a warehouse, where an aggrieved, bearded MAGA-hat-wearing white man faces off against a skeptical black man. The 30-year-old Massachusetts rapper Lucas (who is black) performs both verses, first from the perspective of the white conservative (with an abundance of racial epithets), and later, from that of the black man who can’t bear to listen anymore. As music, it is onerous agitpop — an egregious case of bothsidesism. As video, it’s unintentionally comic, mawkish passing for sober. Throughout the clip, the tension grows; the white man stands up and hovers over his counterpart, pointing and yelling. Eventually, the black man stands up, flips the table, knocks the MAGA hat off his sparring partner’s head. It seems like there will be resolution, that the guy who insists he’s not racist will finally come to the realization that he is. But then the men face each other and hug, a hilarious conclusion that pretends problems can be solved by simply airing grievances, not addressing them. It feels antiquated and childishly hopeful, as if it had been released in a less tumultuous time — like, say, the early 2010s. Both of these videos are premised on the anxiety that’s born of systemic misunderstanding, confrontation and racism. For a recalibration of that dynamic, there is “Apes**t,” the audacious Jay-Z and Beyoncé video filmed in the Louvre, which proposes that black beauty and creativity belong in museums, too, and that no exclusively white space should remain that way. It is a lavish affair, aesthetically and conceptually, energized by the fact that, on a basic level, the art on the Louvre walls is static, but the performers in the space are not. When a passel of dancers, lying prone atop the Daru staircase, begins to convulse and come to life, it feels like watching birth. Throughout the clip, Beyoncé and Jay-Z hold the screen with intensity and confidence, as natural in this hallowed space as in their home(s). In this, the later stage of their respective careers, engagement with high art has emerged as a crucial signifier, one beyond music, or fashion or other more conventional displays of material wealth. While “Apes**t” doesn’t feel as fully formed or thoughtfully executed as Beyoncé’s “Formation,” which won in this category in 2017, its near-casualness is a loud statement. All three of these videos are designed as provocations of a sort, thinkpiece-bait event releases designed to cut through online clutter. Put out a song on streaming services, and it might be swallowed whole by the ocean. In this crowded climate, creating a vivid video is a survival strategy, especially with no tastemaker outlet (à la MTV) directly promoting/privileging the format. That is how the most effective music videos function today: as time-stopping conversation pieces. But this category also recognizes artists who understand how crucial video is to image formation, and who build it into their output from the earliest stages of their careers. Monáe’s “Pynk” is excerpted from a short film called “Dirty Computer” that accompanied her 2018 album of the same name. Since her early days, Monáe has excelled at character development, and her music functions best as part of an audiovisual whole. “Pynk” is a frothy, playful celebration of sexual openness, straightforward in narrative but inventive in presentation. It was part of a broader story she told last year, in art and in public life, about coming out as queer. The 23-year-old rapper Tierra Whack is a natural visual eccentric and fantastical inheritor of Monáe, as well as of Missy Elliott, Busta Rhymes, the director Chris Cunningham and others. Her excellent 2018 debut album, “Whack World,” was 15 minutes long, one minute per song, and released as one long video full of Whack inhabiting various oddball characters. Strangely, she’s nominated here for “Mumbo Jumbo,” a single that predated that album. Where “Whack World” feels like an extended art project, “Mumbo Jumbo” scans as a micro horror film. Whack is in a dentist’s chair, singing through a mouth retractor. At the end of her surgery, her smile has been exaggerated into an overblown grin. She walks out onto the street, which is as decrepit as Glover’s warehouse, and is surrounded by suffering people saddled with the same false grin — almost an echo of the hollow-eyed sunken place victims in “Get Out.” The song is fine, sort of an extended melodic mumble. But for Whack, perhaps more than any of her fellow nominees, the video is the story. Inventive videos have won in this category before: Janet and Michael Jackson’s “Scream” in 1996, Missy Elliott’s “Lose Control” in 2006, and “Formation.” But more frequently it has gone to the just-fine-enough (or just-expensive-enough) video for an otherwise very popular song, or to an artist so famous (say, the Beatles, in 1997) that Grammy voters tick their box reflexively. But moving forward, this category should be seen as an opportunity to embrace a whole new breed of musician, one who reflects what has long been true but rarely acknowledged at the Grammys: that the job of a recording artist has changed, and that those now making the most vivid impact are as careful about how they look as how they sound.

There’s an insistent, syncopated pulse — but no drumbeat — behind “Jerrod,” an invitation to a timid lover from Solange’s new album, “When I Get Home.” She offers openness, intimacy and sharing: “Give you all the things that I want,” she promises, her voice nestling amid chromatic chords that refuse to resolve; her vocal phrases ride directly atop the bass line, then pull away. Nothing feels solid until the song segues into the next track, “Binz,” and the drums arrive. JON PARELES Like the birds returning from down south and the trees finding new color, the first Drake verse of 2019 heralds the coming of spring and, with it, the hope of new options on the horizon. Not the forced choices of cold-weather confinement, but the chance to seek out what you really want. On the original “Girls Need Love,” Summer Walker sang about her cravings with lethargic swing. On this remix, Drake arrives, the recent 10-year anniversary of his genre-reframing mixtape “So Far Gone” on his mind and on his tongue, to try to make amends on behalf of the less sensitive sex. “Arched back, deep stroke, white wine, weed smoke/that’s my best combination” he starts the flirt rapping, then downshifts into cooing. And this is the real spring awakening: a performance reminiscent of when his rejection of the boundaries between tender and tough was still raw. JON CARAMANICA A blur can be more tantalizing than something fully legible. Jackie Mendoza’s “Seahorse,” from an album due April 26, melts the edges of her vocals with echoes, reverb and stereo panning, while keyboards and guitars float in and drift around her. There’s a pop song near the surface, but it stays just out of reach. PARELES Angst wrapped in mockery surrounded by pop-history allusions with deniable lyrics bonded to endearing melodies — yes, Weezer has released a new album called “Weezer” with a parenthetical color (The Black Album). “High as a Kite” treats its cliché title seriously: “Miles above it’s so serene/I’m letting go of all the troubles that I’ve seen,” Rivers Cuomo sings, putting a yearning tone in his voice. The track summons the orchestral stateliness of late-1960s Beatles and Beach Boys alongside bird calls and distorted lead guitar, flaunting craft and keeping its attitude guarded. PARELES Justin Faulkner has a thrashing, teeming style on the drums — he attacks them — yet he exudes a reassurance that basically all the best drummers have. In striking that balance, he’s like Art Blakey and Elvin Jones. It might have something to do with the fact that Faulkner has effectively been taking a seminar in the music’s lineage for the past 10 years as the youngest member of the pre-eminent saxophonist Branford Marsalis’s quartet (he’s still only 27). On “The Secret Between the Shadow and the Soul,” the group’s third album featuring Faulkner, he shows he’s gone from being the most startling thing about this quartet to the best thing about it. RUSSONELLO Four banjo-wielding songwriters — Rhiannon Giddens, Amythyst Kiah, Leyla McCalla and Allison Russell — reckon with the history of slavery, particularly women’s slavery, on the album “Songs of Our Native Daughters,” drawing on slave chronicles and minstrel songs as well as contemporary perspectives. In “Moon Meets the Sun,” they harmonize in a song of tenacity, cultural survival and willed optimism: “Ah, you put the shackles on our feet but we’re dancing,” Giddens sings. “Ah, you steal our very tongue but we’re dancing.” PARELES This is going to sound meaner than intended but: think Wilson Phillips meets the Chainsmokers. CARYN GANZ “Footsteps,” the song that opens Kehlani’s new mixtape “While We Wait,” holds the lingering afterthoughts of a breakup, with apologies, justifications and regrets from both sides. The underlying beat is slow enough to make room for fitful, asymmetrical vocal lines, while backup vocals arrive to multiply the second guesses. “When I walked away I left footsteps in the mud so you could follow me,” Kehlani and Musiq Soulchild sing at the end, even as their melodies diverge like separate paths. PARELES The latest high-concept album from the electronic duo Matmos, arriving March 15, is “Plastic Anniversary,” which derives all of its sounds from plastic: tapped, plucked, rubbed, scraped, flexed, blown through like horns. “Breaking Bread” is constructed from samples of breaking and broken LPs by the group Bread. It goes for the comic, with a steady syncopated bounce, Caribbean-tinged riffs and an artificial zoo-full of squeaks, chirps, scrapes and plunks. Another track from the album, “Thermoplastic Riot Shield” — played on a clear shield emblazoned “Police” — is far more ominous. PARELES In May the first album from L7 in 20 years, the first album from Sebadoh in six years and the first album from Bad Religion in six years will all be released. All three bands started putting out music in the late 1980s, hit creative peaks in the 1990s and were never beholden to the record industry. Good news: Everyone remembers how to sound like themselves. GANZ “The Creator Has a Master Plan” is spiritual jazz’s signature piece, a glistening two-chord chant that’s like a warm aloe cleanse. Its own creator, the nonpareil tenor saxophonist Pharoah Sanders, has been performing “Master Plan” for the past 50 years. When Joey DeFrancesco decided to venture into spiritual-jazz terrain on his new album, “In the Key of the Universe,” the virtuoso organist was wise enough to enlist Sanders. All of this album is good, but most of it keeps contact with DeFrancesco’s bop comfort zone. Not “Master Plan.” It becomes the album’s highlight, almost inevitably. RUSSONELLO Jason Palmer’s “Rhyme and Reason” is the first release from Giant Step Arts, a nonprofit dedicated to giving underappreciated but visionary jazz musicians the support they need to make quality live albums. Palmer is a perfect first subject for this: He’s a thrifty improviser with a vast dynamic range and an ambitious composer, but he’s hardly known. On “Herbs in a Glass,” the album’s opener, he propels his band mates (the tenor saxophonist Mark Turner, the bassist Matt Brewer and the drummer Kendrick Scott) through a squirrelly nine-beat rhythm; the odd, open-ended meter ends up pushing his intense melody into the plain air, giving it a billowy freedom. RUSSONELLO Sitting at the Jazz Gallery recently as Anna Webber led a septet through the tunes from her latest album, “Clockwise,” I wrote down a lot. Here’s a little of it: splitting and scraping her tones … descended from hocketing and Western choral music and the World Saxophone Quartet and Battle Trance … Teutonic syncopation. Webber is a composer, saxophonist, flutist and more, with big ears and a bustling career underway. “Clockwise” is her first release for Pi Recordings, and a convincing one. It’ll certainly speed your mind up. RUSSONELLO "

5c50a0063a125f5075c06ee6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/29/business/media/r-kelly-jim-derogatis-dream-hampton.html,"CHICAGO — For the journalists who have dug the deepest on R. Kelly, these should be satisfying days. Mr. Kelly, the R&B star behind megahits like “Ignition” and “I Believe I Can Fly,” is facing new consequences after decades of accusations of misconduct, including sex with underage girls and holding women in cultlike captivity. In the weeks since a wrenching and widely discussed new documentary aired on the cable channel Lifetime, Mr. Kelly has been dropped by his record label and is being scrutinized by law enforcement in at least two states. But Jim DeRogatis, the Chicago music journalist who has been chronicling Mr. Kelly’s case for almost 20 years, and Dream Hampton, the filmmaker and critic who made the documentary, “Surviving R. Kelly,” are still being cautious about their safety. Mr. DeRogatis, who has had bullets shot through his windows before, asked that the location of his home not be revealed. Ms. Hampton keeps a guard posted outside her home all night. “We have this hit on our hands that’s having all this real-world impact,” Ms. Hampton said in an interview. “But it’s also come with all the attendant stresses and security concerns.” The gunman at Mr. DeRogatis’s home was never identified and no threatening behavior has ever been tied to Mr. Kelly directly. But the worries of Mr. DeRogatis and Ms. Hampton are a reminder of the high stakes that have surrounded the journalistic pursuit of Mr. Kelly since the accusations against him first emerged. [Meet the prosecutor asking R. Kelly’s accusers to come forward.] After “Surviving R. Kelly” aired, one of the singer’s managers, Henry James Mason, was arrested in Georgia for “terroristic threats” against one of the families featured in the film. (Mr. Kelly, who was acquitted in 2008 of 14 counts of child pornography, has repeatedly denied having sex with minors or holding women against their will.) For Mr. DeRogatis, the trail began in 2000, when an anonymous fax led him to a number of scoops for The Chicago Sun-Times — including the existence of a videotape that was said to show Mr. Kelly having sex with a 14-year-old girl. It has continued into the social-media era, with a series of investigative articles published by BuzzFeed News in 2017 that rekindled outrage and led to the Lifetime series. Mr. DeRogatis veers from expletive-laden indignation to choked-back tears when describing the effects of Mr. Kelly’s alleged behavior with what he estimates to be at least 48 women. But he has a special frustration with the rest of the news media, which, he says, failed to follow The Sun-Times’s investigative lead, and for years made light of the charges or ignored them altogether. “Where was everybody else?” Mr. DeRogatis shouted in an interview last week, his voice bouncing off the tile walls of his home. “I wanted everybody in the world to write about this” and stop Mr. Kelly, he added. As The Sun-Times’s pop music critic, Mr. DeRogatis was an unlikely candidate to write such a complex investigative story. “I’m a rock critic,” he said. “I’ve had to deal with the most complicated arrangements of off-the-record, on-the-record sourcing that any journalist will have to deal with.” A forthcoming book by Mr. DeRogatis, “Soulless: The Case Against R. Kelly,” to be published in the fall by Abrams Press, will tell the story of his reporting throughout the case, and delve into some of the topics that have consumed him as a critic, like the insidious power of celebrity media. In the small and prickly world of music journalists, Mr. DeRogatis, 54, stands out as especially cantankerous and contrarian. In 1996, for example, he was fired by Rolling Stone after complaining publicly when his negative review of Hootie & the Blowfish was killed and replaced with a kinder one. Yet like his hero, the critic Lester Bangs, Mr. DeRogatis also campaigns for his favorite artists with the zeal of a superfan. That comes through on “Sound Opinions,” the syndicated weekly radio show he hosts with Greg Kot of The Chicago Tribune. And in person, Mr. DeRogatis displays his personal hall of fame on his forearms, with mural-like tattoos picturing, among others, the Velvet Underground, Nirvana, Public Enemy and Bangs, who died in 1982. For the dozens of women Mr. DeRogatis has interviewed, he said, their experience with Mr. Kelly is a perverse inversion of music’s transformative power. “If rock ’n’ roll can save your life, is there a flip side?” he asked. “Can it be destroyed by music?” When Mr. DeRogatis received that first fax on the day before Thanksgiving in 2000 — it said that Mr. Kelly had a “problem” with young girls, and was signed only “a friend” — he initially tossed it aside. But its specificity nagged at his reporter’s instincts. The note included the names of a victim, a lawyer and a sex crimes investigator at the Chicago Police Department. “You’re not going to make up a weird Polish cop name,” he said. When he called that investigator, she said she couldn’t talk about the case and hung up. A month after he received the fax, Mr. DeRogatis, working with The Sun-Times’s legal affairs reporter, Abdon Pallasch, published their first investigation. In the years that followed, the reporters documented an apparent pattern of predatory behavior, as well as confidential settlements to silence women and a music industry unwilling to let go of one of its rainmakers. On the day they received a videotape that appeared to show Mr. Kelly with a young woman — which they did not write about because they could not confirm the woman’s identity — a gunshot shattered Mr. DeRogatis’s vestibule window. Their most explosive finding was a second videotape, dropped anonymously in Mr. DeRogatis’s home mailbox, which, over nearly 27 minutes, showed Mr. Kelly with what appeared to be a 14-year-old girl. That second tape, which like the first was turned over to the police, led to Mr. Kelly’s indictment in 2002 on charges of child pornography. After a long-delayed trial, he was acquitted after the young woman believed to be on the tape refused to testify, although she had been identified by more than a dozen witnesses. Framed on the wall in Mr. DeRogatis’s home office is the well-thumbed index card that he read 17 times on the witness stand at Mr. Kelly’s trial, declining to answer questions under the First and Fifth Amendments. Ms. Hampton, the documentarian, credited Mr. DeRogatis for that dogged work, which first put on the record most of the women who were interviewed in “Surviving R. Kelly.” “What Jim helped us to understand,” she said, “is that it was indeed a pattern, and that it is still happening.” Their respect is mutual. Praising the documentary’s visceral interview format, Mr. DeRogatis said, “What Dream Hampton did is introduce you to these women.” Throughout their reporting for The Sun-Times, Mr. DeRogatis and Mr. Pallasch had little serious competition. “It was very hard to get the rest of the media to take this seriously,” said Mr. Pallasch, who is now a spokesman for Susana A. Mendoza, the Illinois comptroller. One reason, which Mr. DeRogatis has frequently given, citing statements made by black cultural critics like Mark Anthony Neal, was that the victims were black women. Even as Mr. Kelly went on to collaborate with pop stars like Lady Gaga, the complaints of black activists and journalists were often ignored, said Akiba Solomon, the senior editorial director at Colorlines, a news site focused on race. “Black women have had a steady drumbeat around R. Kelly, even when it wasn’t a huge story,” Ms. Solomon said. “But part of the reason why nobody has listened is about how black girls are devalued and the labor of black women journalists is devalued as well.” After the trial, the news media largely moved on from the accusations against Mr. Kelly, and Mr. DeRogatis left The Sun-Times in 2010 to teach English at Columbia College Chicago. Yet he continued to hear from victims, and he remained one of the few voices that called for Mr. Kelly to be held accountable — by the music and media industries, if not by the law. In late 2016, Mr. DeRogatis was contacted by a family saying that they had told the police that Mr. Kelly was keeping their daughter as part of a “cult” at one of his rental properties near Atlanta. Mr. DeRogatis worked with three separate media outlets on the story, each of which progressed far along the editing process before dropping out. After the last outlet canceled, on a Wednesday afternoon in July 2017, Mr. DeRogatis contacted Shani O. Hilton, the vice president of news and programming at BuzzFeed News, who accepted the piece. It was edited, fact-checked and given a legal review in four days. “He literally FedExed all of his boxes of evidence, his tapes, his transcriptions,” Ms. Hilton said. That article, published the next Monday at nearly 5,000 words, and several others that followed spawned an activist hashtag, #MuteRKelly, that called for Mr. Kelly to be dropped by his label, RCA, and by streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music. His BuzzFeed stories also led to Kreativ, a television production company that has a deal with Bunim/Murray Productions — the reality-TV giant behind shows like “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” — to begin laying the groundwork for the documentary. Interviews with victims and family members who had been identified through Mr. DeRogatis’s reporting were lined up. After selling the project to Lifetime, the producers approached Ms. Hampton, who said that at first, the Bunim/Murray association turned her off. “They said they were approaching this very seriously and wanted to center these black girls,” Ms. Hampton said. “I took off my sunglasses and stopped eating my sushi and all of a sudden took this meeting very seriously.” Ms. Hampton, 47, joined the project in February 2018, as showrunner and executive producer, and her involvement immediately gave it credibility. As a hip-hop journalist in the 1990s, she developed a reputation as both an insider and a cutting critic of the culture’s shortcomings. She developed close friendships with the Notorious B.I.G. and Jay-Z, yet called out Dr. Dre and other rappers for violence against women. In 2000, shortly before The Sun-Times published its first exposé, Ms. Hampton had written a glowing profile of Mr. Kelly for Vibe, spending long stretches in the studio, where, she says, she saw young women also present. She has not written another magazine profile since, and said that she saw the Lifetime documentary as “a chance to redeem myself for not having opened Jeffrey Dahmer’s fridge.” The documentary had originally been planned for 60 or 90 minutes. But as the material mounted — it ultimately included interviews with 54 people, including accusers, family members and commentators — “we just kept greenlighting hours,” said Brie Miranda Bryant, the senior vice president of unscripted development and programming at Lifetime. It ran as six hourlong episodes, and has reached a total of 25.8 million viewers so far, according to Lifetime. The film drew immediate notice for the powerful testimony of black women who said they had been targeted by Mr. Kelly, and led to protests outside the offices of RCA and its parent company, Sony Music Entertainment. The company soon parted ways with Mr. Kelly, scrubbing him from the RCA website, although neither RCA nor Sony has commented publicly. For Ms. Hampton, the documentary fits into a career marked by activism. She is an executive producer on “It’s a Hard Truth Ain’t It,” a prison documentary that will be shown next month on HBO, as well as on “Finding Justice,” a six-part documentary series about injustices in black communities, that will be shown on BET in March. Mr. DeRogatis is now finishing his book, which he said would include new details about the case and some of the women he has interviewed over the years. But it may still not be complete. He recently began communicating with another woman, who so far is not ready to go on the record. “My book is about R. Kelly by necessity,” he said. “But it’s really about the girls. It was always about the girls.” "
5c4223b03a125f5075c052f8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/18/arts/music/r-kelly-rca-sony.html,"For years, R. Kelly had seemed untouchable. Acquitted on charges of child pornography, accused of misconduct with underage girls, Mr. Kelly long remained embraced by the music industry. He toured widely, appearing at Grammy parties and making records with stars like Lady Gaga and Jay-Z. But on Friday, Mr. Kelly — once one of the biggest and most influential stars in pop music — was dropped by his record company, RCA, in the music industry’s highest-profile casualty of the #MeToo era. RCA’s agreement to part ways with Robert Kelly, confirmed by a person briefed on the move who declined to be identified because the deal was confidential, came after weeks of protests. A recent television documentary, “Surviving R. Kelly,” drew wide attention for its visceral testimonials by women who said that as underage girls they had been lured into sexual relationships with Mr. Kelly, and abused by him mentally and physically. Yet as pressure had mounted on RCA — including from other artists on its roster — the company remained silent. The news of Mr. Kelly’s departure was first reported by Billboard, and RCA, a unit of Sony Music Entertainment, made no formal announcement; by Friday afternoon, Mr. Kelly had simply been scrubbed from the label’s website. Activists who had been calling for Mr. Kelly’s dismissal cheered the decision, while still criticizing RCA for its slow pace, and they pushed the entertainment industry to punish Mr. Kelly further. “After years of profiting from R. Kelly, despite their knowledge of his sexual abuse of black girls, Sony’s RCA is finally acting,” Arisha Hatch of the group Color of Change said in a statement. Time’s Up called on streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music to remove his music. “All allies in the fight against sexual violence,” the group wrote on Twitter, “must take a stand on this toxic issue.” Accusations of misconduct by Mr. Kelly, 52, date to the mid-1990s, when it was revealed that, at 27, he secretly married his 15-year-old protégée, Aaliyah; their marriage certificate falsely listed her age as 18. The union was quickly annulled. Aaliyah died in a plane crash in 2001. Lurid reports of misconduct followed, many of them in The Chicago Sun-Times, including accounts from women who said that Mr. Kelly had sex with them when they were as young as 15. In 2002, Mr. Kelly was charged with multiple counts of child pornography over a videotape that prosecutors alleged showed him having sex with a 14-year-old girl. But he was acquitted of all charges in 2008, after the young woman said to be on the tape would not testify. Mr. Kelly has denied abusing or mistreating any women. Don Russell, who identified himself as the “top adviser” to Mr. Kelly, said on Friday that other labels were interested in signing Mr. Kelly, though he declined to identify them. Mr. Kelly, he said, is eager to move on. “Once this thing pivots with the negative press, the defamation of character and the false allegations,” Mr. Russell said, “we will look at repositioning this to allow him to get some of the content he has out there.” Even as accusations mounted against Mr. Kelly, he continued to have a high-profile career, writing and producing hits and earning an uneasy respect from many music critics who saw him as an innovator and a rare talent. According to the Recording Industry Association of America, Mr. Kelly has sold at least 32 million albums in the United States alone. But the public opinion began to turn against him again in 2017, after an investigation published by BuzzFeed News said that he had been holding women against their will in an abusive “cult.” In that report, former members of Mr. Kelly’s inner circle said that he was holding at least six women in a form of captivity, “dictating what they eat, how they dress, when they bathe, when they sleep and how they engage in sexual encounters that he records.” Online outrage over that reporting led to a social media campaign, #MuteRKelly. “Surviving R. Kelly,” broadcast in six parts this month by Lifetime, reinvigorated that campaign, leading to protests outside the corporate offices of RCA and Sony in New York and Culver City, Calif. Prosecutors in Chicago and Atlanta, where Mr. Kelly has lived, have asked women to come forward, but Mr. Kelly has not been charged with a crime. Celebrities like Lady Gaga, Celine Dion and Chance the Rapper, who collaborated with Mr. Kelly in the past, distanced themselves with contrite statements; Lady Gaga removed a 2013 track, “Do What U Want,” from online music services. Asante McGee, a fan who became part of Mr. Kelly’s entourage, said that during her time with him, he forbade her from looking other men in the eye and made her ask permission to go to the bathroom. Ms. McGee said in an interview on Friday that she felt vindicated knowing Kelly was finally facing consequences. “I am relieved,” Ms. McGee said. “His time is coming to an end.” For the women in the documentary and their families, the release of “Surviving R. Kelly” also brought fears of retaliation. On Friday, a man who has been part of Kelly’s management team, Henry James Mason, turned himself in to the authorities in Georgia, after being wanted on a warrant for terroristic threats and acts against Timothy Savage, whose daughter Joycelyn is believed to be living with Kelly. Mr. Mason denied the accusations. Mr. Savage and his wife, Jonjelyn, appeared in the documentary saying that they had not had contact with their daughter in years. Last year, TMZ published a video in which Joycelyn Savage said she was happy living with Mr. Kelly and was there of her own volition. Last week, Mr. Kelly’s lawyer, Steven Greenberg, called the relationships “perfectly consensual” and said that Mr. Kelly never knowingly had sex with anyone underage. Terms of Mr. Kelly’s exit deal — including what, if anything, RCA paid him to terminate the contract — were not disclosed. He had been signed to Jive Records — now owned by Sony — in 1991 and had most recently renewed his RCA contract a few years ago, according to two people with knowledge of that deal. According to the person briefed on Mr. Kelly’s exit talks, RCA had been discussing the move for months with his legal team, well before the release of the Lifetime documentary but after the #MuteRKelly movement had gained momentum. Yet what will become of Mr. Kelly’s career is unclear. His music remains available on streaming services, and his valuable back catalog — with hits like “I Believe I Can Fly” and “Ignition (Remix)” — will remain the property of RCA. Mr. Kelly was also quietly dropped last year by the Universal Music Publishing Group, yet that company still controls the songwriting rights for his past songs. Mr. Kelly will most likely earn royalties off his past hits for years. For many in the industry, the question of censorship weighs heavily over any decision to remove music from circulation — particularly in the streaming era, when deletion of an album means it has been all but erased. Spotify faced criticism over these issues last year when it instituted a poorly defined “hateful conduct” policy that seemed to largely affect black artists, including Mr. Kelly; their tracks were removed from Spotify’s official playlists but remained available for fans to listen to. After an industry uproar, the policy was rescinded within three weeks. Mr. Kelly’s star has faded in recent years; his last album for RCA, “12 Nights of Christmas,” released in 2016, reached only No. 177 on the Billboard chart. And his most recent songs have been released on the streaming platform SoundCloud, without the involvement of RCA. Those kinds of outlets, which are often used by up-and-coming artists, may now present an avenue for Kelly to release music in the future. “Like it or not, R Kelly still has fans and defenders,” said Bill Werde, the director of Syracuse University’s Bandier Program on the music industry. “There are people who love his music so much, they are willing to ignore or rationalize the awful realities brought to life in the documentary,” he added. “And the modern music business means he still has plenty of ways to reach those people.” "

Kaepernick is the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback whose refusal to stand during “The Star-Spangled Banner” — and decision to kneel instead — to protest police brutality has made him a divisive figure nationwide, earning him praise from civil rights groups, but scorn from many conservatives, including President Trump. “I understand that Mr. Kaepernick is protesting two things, and they are police violence and injustice,” Knight wrote to Variety. “It is unfortunate that our national anthem has been dragged into this debate when the distinctive senses of the national anthem and fighting for justice should each stand alone.” The statement continued: “I am here today and on Sunday, Feb. 3, to give the anthem back its voice, to stand for that historic choice of words, the way it unites us when we hear it and to free it from the same prejudices and struggles I have fought long and hard for all my life.” This is the latest twist at the intersection of politics, sports and music that has surrounded this year’s Super Bowl. Kaepernick is still in the middle of an ongoing arbitration case regarding a grievance he filed against the N.F.L. He has accused the league’s owners of colluding to keep him out of the league after not being signed last season. His protests during the anthems became a cultural flash point, even though he wasn’t in the league. Other N.F.L. players began kneeling to support Kaepernick, as did celebrities off the field. Last fall, Nike made Kaepernick the face of a prominent advertising campaign. This year’s Super Bowl became particularly fraught because of the halftime show. Some high-profile artists, including the rapper Cardi B, said they would not be willing to perform, in a show of solidarity with Kaepernick. Last year, Jay-Z rapped in one of his songs: “I said no to the Super Bowl, you need me, I don’t need you.” Earlier this week, the N.F.L. announced the halftime acts would be Maroon 5 and the rappers Travis Scott and Big Boi. Scott’s decision to participate, in particular, received backlash, including from prominent African-Americans like Al Sharpton. Variety reported that Kaepernick and Scott spoke before the announcement and described the conversation as “cordial and respectful.” But on Wednesday, several posts critical of Scott appeared on Kaepernick’s Twitter account. Perhaps anticipating the criticism, Scott announced on Sunday, in conjunction with the halftime billing, that he and the league were teaming up on a $500,000 donation to Dream Corps, a social justice group. Representatives for Kaepernick and Knight declined to comment. "
5c35f05a3a125f5075c03867,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/09/arts/music/woodstock-50th-anniversary-festival.html,"WOODSTOCK, N.Y. — When the first Woodstock music festival was held in 1969, bringing around 400,000 people to a muddy field in Bethel, N.Y., it focused the world’s attention on pop music’s power to shape the culture. Half a century later, in a music market already jammed with big-ticket festivals, could another Woodstock muster the same impact? Michael Lang, one of the producers of the original event, is betting that it can. From Aug. 16 to 18 — almost exactly 50 years after the first Woodstock — he will present an official anniversary festival, Woodstock 50, in Watkins Glen, N.Y., with ambitions to not only attract a huge multigenerational audience but to rally those fans around a message of social activism. Mr. Lang, who at 74 still has some of the cherubic look seen in the 1970 documentary “Woodstock” — though his curls are threaded with gray — said in an interview at the festival office in Woodstock that he is still booking the acts for the new show; he is hoping for a mixture of legacy bands, current pop and rap stars and, possibly, some news-making combinations. But his vision for Woodstock’s 50th, he said, is clear: a large-scale camping weekend combining music with a program of films, speakers and partnerships with organizations like Head count, which registers young voters.  “Coachella’s got its thing, as does Bonnaroo and Lollapalooza,” Mr. Lang said. “But I think they’re all missing an opportunity to make a difference in the world. They’re all perfect places for social engagement and for fostering ideas, and I think that’s lost.” “We want this to be more than just coming to a concert,” he added. “And hopefully a lot of the bands will become part of this effort to get people to stand up and make themselves heard, to get and out vote. And if they don’t have a candidate that represents their feelings, to find one — or to run themselves.” Yet activism plays a significant part in a number of festivals. Environmental sustainability is central to Bonnaroo, for example, and this year Jay-Z’s Made in America Festival, in Philadelphia, has “Cause Village,” with some 56 charitable and activist organizations represented.  Woodstock 50 will be held in the fields surrounding the Watkins Glen International racetrack, where the Summer Jam in 1973 drew an estimated 600,000 people for the Grateful Dead, the Allman Brothers and the Band; more recently, it has been the site of two festivals by Phish.  For Woodstock, three main stages will be supplemented by three smaller “neighborhoods,” as Mr. Lang described them, with their own food and programming.  Tickets? Mr. Lang and his team are still working on that. But they envision selling a maximum of around 100,000 three-day passes, with most attendees camping on site. As with its other anniversary years, Woodstock’s 50th will be widely celebrated and exploited in the media, with books, albums and a PBS documentary among the projects planned. But unlike the last Woodstock anniversary concerts, in 1994 and 1999, which Mr. Lang presented along with partners, the event now faces severe competition from large-scale festivals around the country.  Coachella, Lollapalooza and Bonnaroo, the three biggest, are now highly developed brand names, with the drawing power to sell out well in advance; tickets for Coachella’s two weekends, for example, sold out in a matter of hours last week. There is even a competing Woodstock: the Bethel Woods Music and Culture Festival, over the same anniversary weekend — which will also feature “TED-style talks” — will be held on the same grounds as the original, around 60 miles from the town of Woodstock. (The Watkins Glen site is further afield, about 30 miles west of Ithaca.) For many concertgoers, another issue is whether the Woodstock name itself was damaged by the 1999 festival, which was marred by fires, rioting and reports of sexual assault.  “It’s not tainted,” Mr. Lang said. “’99 was more like an MTV event than a Woodstock event, really. I take some responsibility for that. It was also kind of an angry time in music.” And then there is the corporate consolidation of the concert business, which has grown especially intense over the last few years as two companies, Live Nation and AEG, compete to book major tours. Live Nation is a partner in the Bethel Woods event. “The industry has completely changed since 1999,” said John Scher, the veteran concert promoter who was a partner with Mr. Lang on Woodstock ’94 and ’99. “The entrepreneurial spirit of 1969 doesn’t exist anymore.” Mr. Lang declined to discuss the budget for Woodstock 50, but festivals of its size typically spend tens of millions on talent alone. “We paid $135,000 for all of our talent in 1969,” Mr. Lang said. “Times have changed.” The festival is being financed by the Dentsu Aegis Network, a unit of the Japanese advertising giant Dentsu; agencies within the Dentsu Aegis Network will be involved in marketing and selling sponsorships.  One advantage for Woodstock 50 is that it is “official.” Mr. Lang remains a partner in Woodstock Ventures, the company that controls the trademark rights, and licenses it for various products. The one Mr. Lang has been closest to is Woodstock Cannabis.  “Cannabis has always been in our DNA,” Mr. Lang said with a smile; his first commercial venture, in 1966, was a head shop in the Coconut Grove neighborhood of Miami. Of the other young men on the team that created Woodstock — Joel Rosenman, John Roberts and Artie Kornfeld — Rosenman is a partner in Woodstock Ventures, along with the family of Roberts, who died in 2001. Kornfeld will return as a consultant and “spiritual adviser,” Mr. Lang said.  Merchandise sales — particularly featuring the original Woodstock bird-and-guitar logo — provide one proxy for gauging the continuing appeal of the Woodstock brand. Dell Furano, the chief executive of Epic Rights, who has handled official Woodstock merchandise for 15 years, said that he is expecting over $100 million in retail sales of Woodstock licensed products in 2019 — four or five times that of non-anniversary years. “There’s every type of tie-dye. Children’s products. Dog products. Speakers, wine, cannabis,” Mr. Furano said in an interview. “The appeal is multigenerational.” In 1969, the mud, the tie-dye and the idealism were all catalysts in creating what the original festival had promised: three days of peace and music. Mr. Lang said that the divisiveness of the current political climate called for that once again. “It just seems like it’s a perfect time,” he said, “for a Woodstock kind of reminder.” "
5c609f3e3a125f5075c08fb5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/10/arts/music/grammy-awards.html,"• Our critics and writers weigh in on the best and worst moments of the 61st annual Grammy awards. • At a ceremony dominated by female performers and presenters, Kacey Musgraves won album of the year for “Golden Hour,” as well as three other awards. Cardi B became the first woman to win best rap album as a solo artist for “Invasion of Privacy.” • See the full list of winners and the red carpet looks. • Childish Gambino’s “This Is America” won four awards and Lady Gaga’s “Shallow,” from the movie “A Star Is Born,” won two. • This year’s ceremony was perhaps as notable for who didn’t show up — Kendrick Lamar, Childish Gambino, Ariana Grande — as who did. LOS ANGELES — Women took center stage at the 61st annual Grammy Awards on Sunday night, with bold performances and wins in many top categories, a year after the awards came under withering criticism for its track record in gender representation. The controversies of last year, when just one woman won a solo award during the telecast — and the outgoing head of the Recording Academy, the organization behind the awards, remarked that women in music should “step up” to advance their careers — were never far from the surface of the show. Dua Lipa, a 23-year-old British singer who has established herself as a hitmaker, alluded to that when accepting the award for best new artist, saying she was honored to be recognized among so many other female artists. “I guess this year we really stepped up,” Lipa said. Backstage, she told reporters that the message of greater gender equity was immediately clear to her when the nominations were announced in December. [Read about Michelle Obama joining Alicia Keys onstage.] The award for album of the year went to Kacey Musgraves for “Golden Hour,” a collection that stretched the boundaries of country and drew deep respect from critics. She also took home three other prizes in the country field. “Women have a really necessary perspective — to life, to music,” Musgraves told reporters backstage. “It’s really nice to see that getting a chance to be included.” Many of the awards won by men highlighted the Grammys’ fraught history with hip-hop. Both the record and song of the year prizes — the latter awarded for songwriting — were won by Childish Gambino’s “This Is America,” a thumping, confrontational song about racial injustice. It was the first hip-hop song to win either award. But Donald Glover, the actor and musician who performs as Childish Gambino, was absent. He, along with Kendrick Lamar and Drake, the two most powerful and influential young rappers in music, were offered performance spots on the show but turned them down, reflecting the alienation from the Grammys that has taken hold among much of the upper ranks of hip-hop. Drake was there to accept the award for best rap song, for “God’s Plan” from his blockbuster album “Scorpion.” Before his speech was cut off, he alluded to the gulf between the Grammy establishment and hip-hop culture. “This is a business where sometimes it’s up to a bunch of people that might not understand what a mixed-race kid from Canada has to say or a fly Spanish girl from New York, or a brother from Houston,” he said. “But the point is, you’ve already won if you have people who are singing your songs word for word, you don’t need this right here,” he added, holding up the Grammy. Brandi Carlile, an earnest female singer-songwriter in an Americana style, was the dark horse of the show, getting six nominations — more than any other woman — including in the top categories of album, record and song of the year. She gave a powerful, arena-filling performance of her song “The Joke,” and ended up winning three awards, though none in the top categories. She took best American roots performance and song for “The Joke,” and Americana album for “By the Way, I Forgive You.” They were the first Grammys of her career. Lamar and Drake, the two most-nominated artists — with eight and seven nods, respectively — each won only one. Lamar’s “King’s Dead,” from the “Black Panther” soundtrack, tied for best rap performance with Anderson .Paak’s “Bubblin.” Childish Gambino’s “This Is America” won a total of four awards, including rap/sung performance and best music video. The ceremony began with the 21-year-old singer Camila Cabello performing her song “Havana” on a neon-colored city street scene, joined by a white-suited Ricky Martin, J Balvin and Young Thug. But the first moment of major star power came a few minutes later, when Alicia Keys, the host, introduced “my sisters”: Lady Gaga, Jada Pinkett Smith, Michelle Obama and Jennifer Lopez. Each spoke about the inspiring power of music throughout their lives. Obama, drawing a thunderous welcome from the crowd at the Staples Center, was nearly drowned out as she delivered her lines. “From the Motown records I wore out on the South Side,” she said, “to the ‘who run the world’ songs that fueled me through this last decade, music has always helped me tell my story.” One superstar woman after another performed solo routines, as if they were fleshing out different views of diva-hood. Janelle Monáe performed “Make Me Feel” with bits of inspiration from Prince and Michael Jackson, but focused on female sexuality, surrounded by female dancers in tight rubber outfits. [Messages of inspiration and hope prevailed during the show.] With Cooper absent, Lady Gaga took both parts of “Shallow” herself. Dressed in a black sequined suit and high platform heels, she thrashed on the stage like a 1970s arena rocker, as pyrotechnics announced the song’s climax. Jennifer Lopez led a Motown tribute performed as a Vegas-style revue. She was joined by Smokey Robinson and Ne-Yo, with a medley of about 10 songs jammed into six minutes and featuring gymnastic, bottom-shaking, somersaulting dancing. Cardi B won the first Grammy of her career, best rap album for “Invasion of Privacy.” Holding the hand of her husband, the rapper Offset, she joked about struggling for composure — “Maybe I should start smoking weed!” — before talking about the long nights she worked to finish her album and shoot videos while pregnant. She is the first female solo artist to win in the category. Earlier, she performed “Money” dressed in purple and black like a supervillain, while dancers around her moved and spread their legs in synchronous motion like a bawdy Busby Berkeley sequence. In the audience, Offset stuck out his tongue suggestively. [Never miss a pop music story: Sign up for our weekly newsletter, Louder.] H.E.R., the stage name for the 21-year-old singer and songwriter Gabriella Wilson, led a slow-build version of her ballad “Hard Place.” She won two awards, for R&B performance (in the song “Best Part”) and best R&B album, for her self-titled release “H.E.R.” But when accepting R&B album, she seemed almost baffled that it was eligible. “It’s not even an album,” she said. “It’s an E.P.” Lady Gaga won the first award of the telecast, best pop duo/group performance, for “Shallow,” her duet with Bradley Cooper from their movie “A Star Is Born.” Tearful, she said she wished Cooper were with her — he was in London for the Baftas, the British film awards — and addressed a theme in the film, in which Cooper plays a singer struggling with addiction. “I’m so proud to be part of a movie that addresses mental health issues,” she said. “A lot of artists deal with that and we’ve got to take care of each other.” Diana Ross, appearing in a wide, lacy red gown, celebrated her 75th birthday with two hits from her solo career, “The Best Years of My Life” and “Reach Out and Touch (Somebody’s Hand).” Winding up her performance, she ordered those in the crowd to wave their hands, saying: “Together we have no limits. You can learn, dream, unlock new doors. All is possible.” She ended with, “Happy birthday to me!” Dolly Parton had the most cross-generational appeal, singing a five-song medley with Katy Perry, Kacey Musgraves, Miley Cyrus and Maren Morris that had Smokey Robinson and the K-pop group BTS all dancing and singing along in the crowd. It ended with a nostalgic singalong on “9 to 5” that seemed to pull in the whole arena. Shortly thereafter, Musgraves won her third Grammy of the night — best country album for “Golden Hour” — and gushingly doled out thanks to her manager, the Grammys and her fans. “I never dreamed that this record would be met with such love, such warmth, such positivity,” Musgraves said. [Here’s the full list of Grammys winners.] All but nine of the Grammys’ 84 awards were given out in a nontelevised ceremony that was attended by few of the night’s big stars. Carlile led the preshow portion with her three wins in the American roots category. “Americana music is the island of the misfit toys; I am such a misfit,” Carlile said, accepting the second award. “It is the music that has shaped my life and made me who I am, and even given me my family.” Lady Gaga and Musgraves each had two early wins. Lady Gaga’s “Joanne (Where Do You Think You’re Goin’?),” a piano version of a song first released more than two years ago, took best pop solo performance, and “Shallow” took best song written for visual media. Musgraves won best country solo performance for “Butterflies” and her “Space Cowboy” took best country song. The score for “Black Panther” also won an award for its composer, Ludwig Göransson. [Here’s a look at the Grammys red carpet.] The preshow awards may be invisible to most of the general public, but they can set important benchmarks in the industry, and have the power to reshape careers among artists in genres far beyond pop radio. One barrier was broken with the award for best engineered album, nonclassical, which went to Beck’s “Colors.” Among its winners was Emily Lazar, a studio veteran who became the first woman to win as mastering engineer in that category. “I am so grateful to be one of the people,” she said, “that young women see and they can say: ‘I can see it. I can be it. That’s a cool career, I want to go do that.’” Claudia Brant, a seasoned songwriter for Latin artists who won best Latin pop album for “Sincera,” noted that for all the Grammys’ power, it is the daily studio work that matters the most. “Of course it’s going to change my career, because it’s the biggest recognition I’ve ever gotten,” Brant said. “But tomorrow I’ll have a session in the studio with another artist that’s looking for good songs.” The Grammys missed a chance for another milestone in the producer of the year category. The award went to Pharrell Williams. Had it gone to Linda Perry, she would have been the first woman to take home that award. [Here’s the full list of Grammys winners.] "

BROTHERS OSBORNE at Terminal 5 (Jan. 23, 8 p.m.). For those who appreciate their country music with a healthy dose of roadhouse-ready rock, this Maryland-based duo have released a series of up-tempo, guitar-heavy singles that have earned them both critical acclaim (including five Grammy nods) and a considerable following. Their rough-around-the-edges sound — relative to the slick Nashville aesthetic that’s currently in vogue — has endeared them to those country fans alienated by the genre’s radio-driven conformity. The show is sold out, but tickets are available through the resale market. 212-582-6600, terminal5nyc.com CAM’RON at S.O.B.’s (Jan. 19, 8 p.m.). This Harlem-based M.C. will bring his collection of irresistible, party-starting tracks to this intimate club in SoHo. As a member of the Diplomats, best known for their earthshaking self-titled anthem, Cam’ron helped shape the sound of uptown rap in the late 1990s. Soon after, his solo efforts translated into two massive crossover hits: the indelible “Oh Boy” and “Hey Ma.” Since then, he has remained beloved among rap aficionados for his bombastic, club-ready tracks, but he has enough memorable songs and collaborations to appeal to those newer to the genre. 212-243-4940, sobs.com ANTHONY HAMILTON at Kings Theater (Jan. 19, 8 p.m.). This R&B singer retains the aura of a different time — his rich, smooth voice and defiantly traditional instrumentation have long set him apart from many peers in the genre. His breakthrough in the early 2000s, for example, was fueled by an appearance on the bluesy, rustic Nappy Roots hit “Po’ Folks.” He has continued to draw on everything from classic gospel, with his 2016 single “Amen,” to barbershop harmonies, releasing a series of viral covers of rap hits with his quartet, the Hamiltones. 718-856-5464, kingstheatre.com KING PRINCESS at Warsaw (Jan. 23, 7 p.m.) and Irving Plaza (Jan. 24, 7 p.m.). “I hate it when dudes try to chase me,” sings Mikaela Straus at the opening of her hit single “1950,” which she released under her stage name, King Princess — and somehow that’s not even the song’s most memorable line. Catchy, romantic pop confections are quickly becoming the 20-year-old singer-songwriter’s specialty, despite the fact that she has yet to put out a full-length album. What she has created so far, though, stretches the boundaries of pop norms with titles like “Pussy Is God” and stories about women falling in and out of love with one another. Both shows are sold out, but tickets are available through resellers. 212-777-6800, mercuryeastpresents.com LARAAJI at the Park Church Co-op (Jan. 24, 7 p.m.). Though this septuagenarian’s big break came with the release of his Brian Eno-produced album “Ambient 3: Day of Radiance” in 1980, in recent years he’s garnered a number of new fans thanks in part to a series of reissues from the trendy electronic label Leaving Records. Laraaji makes serene New Age music on an array of instruments including the zither, the hammered dulcimer and the piano. This meditative set will, fittingly, take place in a Brooklyn church. Rachika S, a local ambient electronic composer, opens. eventbrite.com  THIS IS HIP HOP at the Apollo Theater (Jan. 18, 8 p.m.). Hip-hop, with its generally spare instrumentation, has long been a good fit for festival-style concerts that squeeze in a number of acts. The legendary lyricist Rakim and a slew of local rap groups active from the 1980s to the early 2000s — the Lox, E.P.M.D., Black Moon and Brand Nubian — will be sharing the turntables and microphones at this old-school affair. For New York rap fans, it’s a head-nodding trip down memory lane; for those new to the genre, it’s a vital history lesson. 212-531-5305, apollotheater.orgNATALIE WEINER AARON BURNETT AND THE BIG MACHINE at the Cell (Jan. 19, 9 p.m.). Boisterous and urgent, the tenor saxophonist Burnett sounds like he could be living on the jazz avant-garde of the 1970s, or surviving a cyborg apocalypse three decades in the future. His new album with the Big Machine is “Anomaly,” full of original compositions with a weird, seductive darkness — from ballads to scorching, unsettled postbop. Burnett celebrates the disc’s release with an iteration of the Big Machine that includes Joel Ross on vibraphone, Carlos Homs on piano, Nick Jozwiak on bass and Dan Nadeau on drums. 646-861-2253, thecelltheatre.org GEORGE COLEMAN QUINTET at Jazz Standard (though Jan. 20, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). Particularly well known for his stint in Miles Davis’s band during the 1960s, this tenor saxophonist uses a lissome, slippery tone to craft melodies of scattered beauty. Now 83, Coleman appears this weekend in a band of straight-ahead jazz stalwarts: Harold Mabern on piano, Yotam Silberstein on guitar, Gerald Cannon on bass and George Coleman Jr. on drums. 212-576-2232, jazzstandard.com KEYON HARROLD at the Blue Note (Jan. 21-23, 8 and 10:30 p.m.). Harrold is technically gifted enough to have recorded the Miles Davis trumpet parts heard on the soundtrack to the 2016 film “Miles Ahead.” He’s also a ruggedly modern thinker, whose own most recent album draws inspiration from radio hip-hop, classic quiet storm, cinematic scores and contemporary jazz. He has long performed in the backing bands for figures like Maxwell, Jay-Z and Rihanna, but these days he is focusing more squarely on his own bandleading career. A native of Ferguson, Mo., Harrold here will perform a program titled “Jazz for Reflection, Protest, Justice and Unity.” 212-475-8592, bluenote.net  INGRID JENSEN QUINTET at the Birdland Theater (Jan. 23-26, 7 and 9:45 p.m.). A trumpeter who’s as versatile as she is vigorous, Jensen released a standout album last year with the tenor saxophonist Steve Treseler. Titled “Invisible Sounds,” it pays tribute to Kenny Wheeler, an influential trumpeter and composer who died in 2014. Jensen and Treseler reinterpret nine of Wheeler’s compositions, which tend to be lyrical and songlike, whether moving at a quick clip or drifting as slowly as cloud cover. Though Jensen is the nominal bandleader for the gigs on Wednesday and Jan. 24, Treseler will also be there; they’ll be joined by Christine Tobin on vocals, Gary Versace on piano, Martin Wind on bass and Jon Wikan on drums. On Jan. 25 and 26, Jensen will revisit the material from her 2003 disc, “Project O,” with the pianist Gary Versace, the bassist Richie Goods and the drummer Jon Wikan. (The tenor saxophonist Joel Frahm will sit in on Jan. 25 only.)212-581-3080, birdlandjazz.com KASSA OVERALL WITH JASON MORAN at the Jazz Gallery (Jan. 18, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). In December, Overall — a drummer, producer and sometime rapper — launched a monthly residency at the Gallery called “Time Capsule.” He is welcoming a different high-profile pianist each month and will record every performance. The resulting tapes will form a capstone product, a hybrid recording that blends chopped-up elements from different performances. (There’s a visual element, too: Overall is collaborating with the artist Nate Lewis, who will create a work to accompany the record.) For this month’s show, Overall welcomes the eminent pianist Jason Moran. 646-494-3625, jazzgallery.nyc MATANA ROBERTS, HALEY FOHR AND SUZANNE LANGILLE at Issue Project Room (Jan. 19, 7 p.m.). In the first show of Issue’s 2019 season, Roberts, an alto saxophonist and multimedia artist, will perform a new work from her continuing series “I Call America,” using video, text and improvised music to address the intersection of societal concerns and personal frustrations. In a separate set, Haley Fohr — best known for her experimental folk outfit Circuit des Yeux — will perform a solo vocal work titled “Wordless Music.” And Suzanne Langille, another singer, will lead a quartet in an exploration of the overlap between vocal and instrumental expression. 718-330-0313, issueprojectroom.orgGIOVANNI RUSSONELLO For an overview of January and February’s cultural events, click here.

Last week, “Thank U, Next” (Republic) became Grande’s second No. 1 album in six months, with notably high streaming numbers for a pop album. In its second week out, its totals fell by more than 50 percent, with 169 million streams and 20,000 copies sold as a complete album, according to Nielsen. But that was enough to stay on top. Billboard reported that it was the first time that a solo female artist has had more than one week at No. 1 on the chart since Taylor Swift’s “Reputation” notched four weeks at the end of 2017. (Last October, Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper spent three weeks at the top with “A Star Is Born”; this week, that soundtrack is No. 3.) Also this week, the “Bohemian Rhapsody” soundtrack rose one spot to No. 2; look for it to remain strong on next week’s charts, thanks to the best actor Oscar for its star, Rami Malek. The duo Florida Georgia Line opened at No. 4 with “Can’t Say I Ain’t Country,” and in fifth place is Drake’s mixtape “So Far Gone,” which first came out 10 years ago but was not commercially released until last week.

BILAL at National Sawdust (March 29, 8 p.m.). A onetime member of the Soulquarians, this Philadelphia-born singer, songwriter and producer is well known as a collaborator: He has won a Grammy for his work with Kendrick Lamar and lent his vocals to the likes of Jay-Z and Mac Miller. Bilal himself took a circuitous path as a solo artist after his sophomore album was shelved in 2006. Disenchanted with the industry, he parted ways with his label and began experimenting with jazz and electronic sounds, rejecting the “neo-soul” billing that has followed him for much of his career. The result, heard on recent albums “A Love Surreal” and “In Another Life,” is fluid and inviting. 646-779-8455, nationalsawdust.org BROADLY PRESENTS EUPHORIA at Villain (March 30, 8 p.m.). This Vice-owned event space hosts a celebration of International Transgender Day of Visibility, organized by the media company’s female-focused internet channel. Following an afternoon fair for transgender-centered businesses, the evening session will culminate with a dance party hosted by the D.J. Bronze Goddess and the House of LaBeija, one of New York’s oldest drag houses. A performance by Big Freedia — the New Orleans-based rapper and an ambassador of the city’s distinctive bounce style, known for her high-profile collaborations with Beyoncé and Drake — is sure to be a highlight.eventbrite.com EARL SWEATSHIRT at Irving Plaza (March 30, 8 p.m.). For years, the rapper Thebe Kgositsile has been fighting against his own founding myth. Kgositsile, who performs as Earl Sweatshirt, got his start with the California collective Odd Future, gaining a following in 2010 as a viral teenage provocateur with an affinity for shock value and gore. Following his first mixtape, Kgositsile’s music started to show more vulnerability. His latest album, an exploratory set titled “Some Rap Songs,” considers family: A standout track, “Playing Possum,” incorporates sampled audio from his mother and recently deceased poet father. Kgositsile’s performance is sold out, but tickets are available through the resale market.212-777-6800, mercuryeastpresents.com [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] EX HEX at Bowery Ballroom (April 4, 8 p.m.). Technically skilled and wildly inventive, the rock nomad Mary Timony is routinely held up as a guitar god. With Ex Hex, the Washington-based trio she has led since 2014, Timony’s style pulls back from the experimentalism she embraced as the frontwoman of the riot-grrrl-adjacent group Helium in the 1990s. Rounded out by the bassist Betsy Wright and the drummer Laura Harris, Ex Hex play more straight-ahead garage rock; their second full-length recording, “It’s Real,” is packed with power chords, revved-up guitar solos and layered vocals — perfect fodder for the group’s notoriously fun live show.212-260-4700, mercuryeastpresents.com MATMOS AND KEITH FULLERTON WHITMAN at Pioneer Works (April 4, 7 p.m.). Both acts on this double bill work with experimental hybrids of electronic and organic sound. Since coming together in 1997, Matmos — the duo of Martin Schmidt and Drew Daniel — have obsessed over the materiality of music. They compose by gathering samples from diverse sources, like washing machines, animal cages or amplified nerve tissue; their new record, “Plastic Anniversary,” cleverly comments on the impending environmental crisis by drawing from all-plastic source material. Expect to hear selections from that album at this art center in Red Hook, Brooklyn, as well as the highly technical experiments in ambient and drone from the Brooklyn-based performer Whitman.pioneerworks.org DEEM SPENCER at Baby’s All Right (April 3, 8 p.m.). On his earliest releases, this soft-spoken rapper from Queens delivered a sound that might have been described as half-whispered, and half-finished, poetry. Last month’s “Pretty Face” — his first full-length recording — is built on the same melancholy lyricism and lo-fi production that defined previous projects, but it feels more resolute, nudging up the intensity on his heartsick ruminations. Spencer’s performance at this fittingly intimate club in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, is two milestones in one: his first headlining show in New York and the live debut of tracks from “Pretty Face.”718-599-5800, babysallright.comOLIVIA HORN BACHIR AND MUSTAPHA ATTAR at Roulette (March 30, 8 p.m.). The Master Musicians of Jajouka, a heritage band from a small village in Morocco, have become an influence on the rest of the world thanks to their work with Western stars such as Ornette Coleman, Bernardo Bertolucci and even the Rolling Stones. They’re defined by the sharp scrawl of the ghaita, a double-reed instrument, and the resounding pound of the tebel drum, which is made of goatskin and struck with wooden sticks. Bachir and Mustapha Attar are the sons of Hadj Abdesalam Attar, who led the Master Musicians when they made their first recordings in the 1960s. At this concert, part of the continuing A World in Trance festival, the Attar brothers will perform alongside three improvising musicians based in the United States: the saxophonist and clarinetist Ned Rothenberg; the saxophonist, vocalist and visual artist Arrington de Dionyso; and the percussionist Ben Bennett.917-267-0368, roulette.org BROKEN SHADOWS at the Village Vanguard (through March 31, 8:30 and 10:30 p.m.). The alto saxophonist Tim Berne, an outré doyen of the New York music scene, writes runic, sharp-edged, fiercely desiccated tunes. They’re a lot of fun if you’re the type who likes to question the entire phenomenology of “tunes” or, better yet, “fun.” Broken Shadows, his new band, which is about to release an album on the subscription-only Newvelle Records imprint, is more immediately rambunctious. This music is easy to sing along with, and to move to, partly because the group mostly plays the compositions of Ornette Coleman, and partly because of the personnel: the underappreciated tenor saxophonist Chris Speed, the wily bassist Reid Anderson and the gallivanting drummer Dave King.212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com EDDIE HENDERSON at Smoke (March 28-30, 7, 9 and 10:30 p.m.). In big-band jazz and bebop, a trumpeter was often responsible for adding a flare of percussive energy to the upper reaches of a group’s sound. In later forms of jazz, more heavily influenced by funk and soul, the instrument sometimes played more of a steadying role — holding sultry tones, projecting calm — while the rhythm section addressed questions of impact more directly. Eddie Henderson is comfortable in both circumstances, though he is more commonly associated with the jazz-funk movement of the 1970s, when he was known for work in his own bands and those led by Herbie Hancock. He performs here with Donald Harrison on alto saxophone, Peter Zak on piano, Essiet Okon Essiet on bass and Mike Clark on drums — most of whom appeared on “Be Cool,” Henderson’s strong album from 2018.212-864-6662, smokejazz.com SUSIE IBARRA at H0L0 (March 31, 7 p.m.). Ibarra plays the drums with cool precision and a sense of architectural awareness that befits a great composer. After all, she’s that too. Always blazing a new creative trail, she will present at H0L0 a fresh project, “Bird Songs,” featuring original music inspired by bird calls, with Jake Landau on guitar and keyboards and Jean-Luc Sinclair on electronics. The cellist Leila Bordreuil and the vocalist and performance artist Lauren Tosswill will open the show with separate solo performances.h0l0.nyc MARCUS MILLER at the Rose Theater (March 29-30, 8 p.m.). During the 1980s, Miller was the bassist and musical director in some of Miles Davis’s final bands; he wrote and produced almost every tune on “Tutu,” Davis’s Grammy-winning jazz-pop album from 1986. Here Miller will present a concert surveying the panorama of Davis’s electric period, which stretches back to the late 1960s, in an octet featuring Brett Williams on keyboards, Alex Han on saxophone, Marquis Hill and Russell Gunn on trumpet, Vernon Reid on guitar, Alex Bailey on drums and Mino Cinelu on percussion. Each night’s concert will be preceded by a discussion with Miller at 7 p.m.212-721-6500, jazz.org ‘TWO WINGS: THE MUSIC OF BLACK AMERICA IN MIGRATION’ at the Stern Auditorium (March 30, 8 p.m.). The operatic mezzo-soprano Alicia Hall Moran and the pianist Jason Moran, a MacArthur fellow, like to think beyond the idea of multimedia performance. In 2012, with “Bleed,” they transformed a floor at the Whitney Museum of American Art into a zone of convergence and exchange, inviting dozens of performers, scholars and healers to collaborate over a period of days. And on Saturday they will debut “Two Wings,” a community-crafted project that uses the Morans’ own family lore to interrogate the history of America’s Great Migration. The Morans’ fellow performers will include the vocalists Pastor Smokie Norful, Toshi Reagon and Hilda Harris, and the Imani Winds quintet. The historian Isabel Wilkerson will read portions of her definitive account of the Great Migration, “The Warmth of Other Suns.” The concert is part of “Migrations: The Making of America,” a continuing festival produced by Carnegie Hall.212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO "

Grande’s fourth career No. 1 album comes during a prolific, artistically redefining period for the singer, whose last release, “Sweetener,” debuted atop the chart in late August with 231,000 units sold. Since then, Grande has used the fuel of her tabloid moments for music, earning her first No. 1 single on the Billboard Hot 100 (“Thank U, Next”) and then another with “7 Rings” last month. This week, the singer is attempting to top the Hot 100 for a third time with the song “Break Up With Your Girlfriend, I’m Bored.” Grande’s craftily dedicated fans even instituted a #Boycott7Rings campaign in the hopes of getting listeners to give more streams and sales to its follow-up. According to Billboard, the 307 million on-demand streams for songs from “Thank U, Next” mark the highest-ever one-week total for a pop album; of the Top 20 largest streaming weeks, “Thank U, Next” is No. 9 and the only non-hip-hop album on the list. Also on this week’s chart, No. 2 and No. 3 are both movie soundtracks: “A Star Is Born,” featuring Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper, is in second place ahead of the Academy Awards on Sunday, while “Bohemian Rhapsody” is right behind it. Last week’s No. 1, A Boogie Wit da Hoodie’s “Hoodie SZN” is No. 4 and Post Malone’s “Beerbongs & Bentleys” is No. 5. The album of the year winner at last week’s Grammy Awards — Kacey Musgraves’s “Golden Hour” — re-entered the chart entirely, landing at No. 9 with 35,000 units, including 20,000 in album sales. "

5c372cbd3a125f5075c03b5b,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/10/opinion/r-kelly-documentary-metoo.html,"“I didn’t value the accusers’ stories because they were black women,” Chance the Rapper said in the final episode of Lifetime’s six-part documentary “Surviving R. Kelly,” which aired last week.  A few hours before the show, Chance wrote on Twitter: “Any of us who ever ignored the R. Kelly stories, or ever believed he was being set up/attacked by the system (as black men often are) were doing so at the detriment of black women and girls.”  Chance’s blunt admission has long been true. For 20 years, black girls and women accused the R&B singer Robert Kelly of sexually assaulting minors. Yet he still enjoyed enormous success.  So his spectacular fall — due in large part to the work of Dream Hampton, an executive producer of the documentary — marks a seismic cultural shift. Over the past week, we’ve had conversations with many people who had never believed black girls’ allegations against him until they saw the documentary (which the two of us, who are sisters, consulted on in its early stages). It seems that #MeToo has finally returned to black girls. After all, #MeToo was founded by a black woman, Tarana Burke, to help African-American girls like the 13-year-old in Alabama who told her in 1997 about being sexually abused by her mother’s boyfriend. Now we have to make sure that it does not leave. It’s clear that the tide has turned. The backlash against R. Kelly includes high-profile celebrities and everyday fans, as well as prosecutors in Atlanta and Chicago who are looking into the allegations and asking potential victims and witnesses to come forward. And it builds on the #MuteRKelly campaign; the cancellation of his concert last spring in Chicago, his hometown; and a statement by the Women of Color of Time’s Up demanding that companies like RCA Records, Spotify and Apple Music stop doing business with him. But our optimism is tempered by history, which shows that social justice movements rarely center, for any meaningful period, on black girls, or anyone who has survived sexual violence. That’s because black girls experience racial, gender and economic oppressions all at the same time, a phenomenon the law professor Kimberlé Crenshaw calls intersectionality. As a result, their voices and experiences do not neatly fit into a single-issue narrative of gender or race. Harriet Jacobs said as much in “Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl,” her landmark 1861 abolitionist narrative. “Slavery is terrible for men, but it is far more terrible for women,” she wrote to a predominantly white, female readership. She explained to them that a rite of passage for enslaved black girls was the threat of slave masters raping them. “I now entered on my 15 year — a sad epoch in the life of a slave girl,” she wrote. “My master began to whisper foul words in my ear.”  Though Jacobs’s memoir initially received favorable reviews, it fell into obscurity during the Civil War. Most academics considered it a work of fiction until 1987, when it was reissued; the historian Jean Fagan Yellin had rediscovered the book and proved its origins. Contrast that with Frederick Douglass’s memoirs, which “made him the most well-known Negro on the globe,” according to a 2018 book review in The Times.  As activists, we’ve also witnessed this firsthand. Twenty years ago, when we helped the filmmaker Aishah Shahidah Simmons make “NO! The Rape Documentary,” she was initially rejected by every major distributor. An executive from HBO even told her in 1998, “Let’s face it, very unfortunately, most people don’t care about the rape of black women and girls. And therefore, we’re concerned that there won’t be many viewers who will tune in to watch NO!, were we to air it on our network.” Even today, as #MeToo continues to dominate headlines, black girls have been invisible in the movement. Instead, the media has primarily focused on white Hollywood actresses who have come forward with their accounts of systemic abuse and harassment. But we learned through our work with A Long Walk Home, a nonprofit we founded in 2003 in response to Salamishah’s own experience of rape when she was 17, that one of the most overlooked yet effective ways to create social change is to just believe the stories that girls and young women of color tell us. And since black girls live at the crossroads of gender and racial violence, if we want to empower them, we have to confront and dismantle each system of oppression that affects them. This past summer, for example, young artists and activists in our organization, which works to end violence against girls and women, led their first public art campaign, called “The Visibility Project.” They took over Douglas Park in Chicago, where several girls from their school had been abducted and later sexually assaulted. It’s also where a 22-year-old black woman, Rekia Boyd, was killed by an off-duty police officer in 2012. As the girls shared their stories of sexual assault or gang violence, they refused to separate the impact of sexual violence, gun violence and political brutality on their lives and on their city. And there was a ripple effect. We’ve noticed in our work that black girls are very powerful organizers; they recruit boys, other girls, their parents and ultimately their community into the movement. That’s another reason we have to make sure that this current moment of listening to and believing black girls and young women is durable. If it’s fleeting, the#MeToo movement will fail.  This requires new forms of collaboration and coalition-building. Legacy civil rights organizations must prioritize sexual assault and domestic violence with the same passion that they bring to voting rights or criminal justice reform. White feminists should organize for equal pay and reproductive rights around an anti-racist framework. Victims’-rights organizations must offer culturally specific resources and lift up the work of organizations led by black women that have long been on the front line of these issues like Black Women’s Blueprint, Girls for Gender Equity, Love With Accountability, Project Nia and the Sasha Center.  With each passing day, more young women accuse R. Kelly of sexual assault. That means more people and institutions — with the glaring exception of his label, RCA — are taking their voices and by extension, girls who look like them, seriously. We’ve been waiting for this moment for a long time. Let’s not squander it.

Just want the music? Listen to the Playlist on Spotify here (or find our profile: nytimes). Like what you hear? Let us know at theplaylist@nytimes.com and sign up for our Louder newsletter, a once-a-week blast of our pop music coverage. The fuzztone is cranked way up on “Lo/Hi,” the first Black Keys song since 2014. It’s the kind of garage-boogie stomp that the band never left behind. Singing about desperate loneliness and 180-degree mood swings, the Black Keys reach back to a late-1960s combination of primordial three-chord simplicity (hinting at Norman Greenbaum’s “Spirit in the Sky”) and overdubs galore. Between the group handclaps, a gang of guitars and the whooping, wailing backup vocals, it’s a far cry from the early Black Keys’ two-man-band austerity — but with the old wallop intact. JON PARELES A folky waltz tells the story of an adolescent romance, deploying details with a concision akin to Paul Simon: “Morrissey apologists, amateur psychologists, serial monogamists, we went to different colleges.” There’s no happy ending, and Phoebe Bridgers’s production surrounds the acoustic guitars with distant, shadowy strings that hint at the song’s higher stakes. PARELES Lauren Mayberry, frontwoman of the Scottish band Chvrches, has a voice that’s tart, serrated and soaring — it cleanly pierces through everything around it. That makes it a sleek, albeit unexpected, complement to the production of Marshmello, whose music is restlessly and relentlessly dopey. On “Here With Me,” Mayberry is a beacon of reason, singing with ramrod posture while the song wiggles and wobbles behind her. JON CARAMANICA “And I haven’t lost my mind thinking about you/And I haven’t lost my breath shouting all the things we’re about to do,” sings Helado Negro — Roberto Carlos Lange — in “Pais Nublado” (“Clouded Nation”), a subdued bossa nova with an electronic penumbra from his new album “This Is How You Smile.” His songs are often bilingual in English and Spanish and built on electronic underpinnings, though “This Is How You Smile” welcomes acoustic guitar as well. The album muses on desire, Latinx identity, change and rhythm, hinting at places where history and politics have intimate repercussions. PARELES The drummer and composer Kendrick Scott will release an album next month titled “A Wall Becomes a Bridge,” featuring his long-running quintet Oracle (plus the turntablist Jahi Sundance on about half the tracks). Scott invests seriously in the ancient ideal of music as a healing force, and the notion that through focus and attunement, he might create sounds that resonate with our particular moment. He’s one of more consistent bandleaders in instrumental music today, with original music that feels consequential and distinguished in spite of its adherence to an airtight, contemporary-jazz aesthetic. With Joe Sanders on bass, Mike Moreno on guitar, Taylor Eigsti on Fender Rhodes and John Ellis on soprano saxophone, Oracle douses your ear in textures that are thick but aerodynamic, and on “‘>>>>>>>>>>>Mocean” Ellis’s liquid melody cuts against Scott’s constant patter, feeding the band two different kinds of fuel. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO Why wouldn’t the guitar on “Who Shot Cupid?” rest somewhere between flamenco, new age and early emo? Juice WRLD has become one of the most promising figures in hip-hop by almost completely dismantling the genre’s usual structures. That’s plain throughout his new album “Death Race for Love,” but the thickly layered moaning vocals on this song — “All the drugs I did, they weren’t worth it/now I'm worthless/I hope my new lady thinks I'm perfect” — show just how far Juice WRLD is able to bend hip-hop, turning it into something soft, interior and elegiac. CARAMANICA An album of newly unearthed recordings by the Texan songwriter Townes Van Zandt (1944-1997) rightfully makes “Sky Blue,” a previously unknown song, its title track. It’s a terse, low-fi, solo, fingerpicked glimpse of chronic despair: “No good reason to be livin’/Been lookin’ high and low,” he sings. PARELES In his decade-long country music career, Justin Moore has been rabble-rousing and retrograde, a stern guy and a goof. Finally, he’s found a song that captures both sides of his duality. “Jesus and Jack Daniels” is delivered with a smear of Randy Travis stoicism — mom parents via the good book, and dad via the bottle: “When we messed up she’d fill us up/with the scripture and a Baptist hymn/and she’d pray we’d be a little more like her and a whole lot less like him.” CARAMANICA The music is an elegantly melancholy bolero. But the words to “Temes” (“You Fear”) are a challenge, defying a machismo that pretends to be romantic but is actually about maintaining power, sometimes violently. “If my freedom is your dispossession/and my body is the recipient of your whim/If my shadow is behind your figure/Why do you fear me?” iLe (Ileana Mercedes Cabra Joglar) sings. And in the desolate video clip, she pulls herself together after a sexual assault. PARELES Backed by Soundwalk Collective, Patti Smith recites dire words by Antonin Artaud about how “A mortal folly comes over the world.” Her tone is steadfast, as if partaking in a ritual; she sings like a stoic lullaby when she reaches the lines, “Here where the mother eats her sons/Power eats Power: Short of war, no stability.” Around her, Sound Collective constructs a pyre of creaky, echoey fiddle lines and drumbeats that build to an apocalyptic rumble. PARELES Like many of Carla Bley’s melodies, the tune to “Ida Lupino” is a simple, songlike thread, snaking through a set of chord changes that gradually tweak the pressure around it, thickening the air and then letting things go slack again. On this version, by the young jazz combo Lioness, Amanda Monaco daubs at single notes on her guitar, painting little shapes around the alto saxophonist Alexa Tarantino’s dewy, unhurried treatment of the melody. Underneath, the drummer Allison Miller keeps a steady beat going, hardly deviating from her cool, eighth-note pattern, even when sparks momentarily start to fly. RUSSONELLO "
5c9ccde649f0eacbf105f878,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/28/arts/music/billie-eilish-debut-album.html,"LOS ANGELES — Even before she turned 17 in December, the singer Billie Eilish had accomplished nearly all of the modern prerequisites for pop stardom and then some: Her homemade songs, written only with her older brother, had been streamed more than a billion times on digital platforms; she’d played increasingly large sold-out concerts to delirious fans (and their patient parents); appeared with Ellen DeGeneres and Jimmy Fallon; and collected some 15 million followers on Instagram. Among those legions, many had already started to adopt the musician’s striking visual aesthetic: performatively dead eyes (bored, at best), hair dyed in shades of electric blue and pale purple, an all-baggy anti-silhouette — a collective middle finger to the strictures of teen-pop sex appeal. While still drawing befuddled stares from those outside of her demographic, Eilish’s mere presence has been known to get a certain subset of teenager hyperventilating — and spending hundreds of dollars on merchandise Eilish designed herself. What the musician didn’t have along the way — and, to her credit, didn’t need — was the lightning strike of a memeable moment or a megahit, the most surefire ways to get noticed (and, potentially, soon forgotten) in today’s avalanche of content. In fact, only now, three years after the music industry caught a whiff of Eilish’s extremely fresh blood, was she even getting around to releasing her debut album. [“When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?” redefines teen-pop stardom. Read the NYT review.] “When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?,” out Friday via Darkroom/Interscope, marks the latest apex in Eilish’s fairy tale career, and it’s likely to cement her growing reputation as a 21st century music business unicorn who embodies all the creative and commercial promise of online youth culture. It might also make her a household name. To speak to her business team and label bosses is to hear the phrase “the biggest artist in the world” repeatedly, and in earnest, as a near-term goal. Dave Grohl, whose daughters are obsessed with Eilish, could only compare her to his old band: “The same thing is happening with her that happened with Nirvana in 1991,” he told a music business conference recently, holding up Eilish’s tough-to-categorize music as proof that “rock ’n’ roll is not even close to being dead.” The hip-hop producer Timbaland called this year, and next, hers for the taking. “I do not see a ceiling,” said Brandon Goodman, one of Eilish’s managers. No pressure. “I can’t even tell you how anxious I’ve been to get this album out,” Eilish said in her parents’ tiny kitchen earlier this month. Self-possessed but entirely a teenager, with one ASAP Rocky shoe propped on the table and gothic rings on every finger, Eilish talks like an Instagram caption come to life — everything is “fire” or “trash,” bro, and she is always “deadass.” Her look is Hot Topic by way of hypebeast; in photos, a smile is rare, though searing eye contact from her ice-blue alien saucers is common. Ahead of her album, Eilish was taking stock of her atypical adolescence, and acknowledging the fact that for all of the attention she’d garnered thus far, her ride into the mainstream was about to kick into a new gear. “For a minute, I could go somewhere nobody knew who I was — maybe at Costco or something,” she said. “I would go places and try to convince myself I wasn’t faaamous or whatever.” But the last bits of her anonymity have been fading; the day prior, she’d been recognized four times while walking two blocks home, forcing her to come to terms with a fast-approaching reality. “There’s no other choice for me,” she said. “I literally have to.” What Eilish and her cadre of surrounding adults hope will differentiate her from decades-worth of precocious, fast-burning teen stars before her is twofold: autonomy and familial support. [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] Building on the paths cut not just by Lorde, Lana Del Rey and Halsey, but Brockhampton, Odd Future and the Weeknd, Eilish is an artist-as-creative director, building her own layered universe for fans to obsess over through a unified flow of music, videos, social media and staging. Musically, she combines most of the internet-first ideas of this century — EDM drops, sad-girl bedroom confessions, SoundCloud rap abandon — into an edgy, genre-agnostic (but playlist-friendly) fusion that sounds like pop and streams like hip-hop. (Instead of one runaway single, Eilish has eight different songs with more than 140 million plays on Spotify.) She insists on near-complete control. “I could easily just be like, you know what, you’re going to pick out my clothes, someone else will come up with my video treatments, someone else will direct them and I won’t have anything to do with them,” Eilish said. “Someone else write my music, someone else produce it, and I won’t say anything about it. Someone else run my Instagram.” “Everything could be easier if I wanted it to,” she continued. “But I’m not that kind of person and I’m not that kind of artist. And I’d rather die than be that kind of artist.” Billie Eilish is also, in many ways, a family business. The songs are written and produced by Eilish and her 21-year-old brother, Finneas, who often opens for her and plays as her backing band. The pair record almost exclusively in their comfortably cluttered childhood bedrooms, never far from their parents, Maggie Baird and Patrick O’Connell, long-toiling actors who pieced together bit parts, regional theater and voice-over work. These days, Baird tours as Eilish’s assistant, but is really more like her chief of staff, all mom and part manager (but without the commission). O’Connell, who also did handiwork and carpentry, is now part of the tour crew, and has gone from driving the van in the leaner days to lighting director. Yet somehow, the cloud of stage-parent oppression seems absent, which isn’t to say that this Partridge Family for the Instagram age wasn’t partially by design. The children were home-schooled, O’Connell said, in part because Finneas was born the same year as the smash hit “MMMBop” by Hanson, a trio of brothers. “I was completely swept away by these kids,” O’Connell recalled. “They were religious Oklahoma home-schooled, but nonetheless. Clearly what had happened was they’d been allowed to pursue the things that they were interested in.” Though not much of a musician herself, Baird eventually taught both children in a beginner’s songwriting class, using touchstones like the Beatles, and the kids were generally encouraged to follow their passions; college was never the goal. (They were also raised vegetarian and slept in a four-person family bed until Finneas was about 10; more recently, the parents took the living room of their two-bedroom, one-bath nest.) Eilish was initially drawn to dance, horseback riding and singing in the Los Angeles Children’s Chorus. But she was primarily a D.I.Y. aesthete, building costumes and crafts from scratch and rallying friends for her elaborate projects. “I was unbelievably bossy,” Eilish said. (Her lifelong friend Zoe Donahoe chimed in from nearby: “She just knew what she wanted.”) Finneas committed to music first, but when he enlisted a 13-year-old Eilish to sing “Ocean Eyes,” a song he’d written for his band, the family’s lives were forever altered. The siblings uploaded the track to SoundCloud for Eilish’s dance teacher to choreograph to, but it took off, fueled by unofficial remixes and algorithm magic, drumming up industry intrigue. By the summer of 2016, Eilish had signed to Darkroom, a marketing company-turned-boutique label run by 28-year-old Justin Lubliner, in partnership with Interscope Records. John Janick, the chief executive of Interscope, recalled of Eilish: “Her sense of style, how she thinks, the way she talks — everything about her was just different. She had such a strong point of view, especially for being 14 years old.” Lubliner envisioned her as “a new breed of pop star,” and was unconcerned with competition from more traditional singers like Selena Gomez and Camila Cabello. Instead of pushing “Ocean Eyes,” which goes down easy as vaguely R&B indie-pop, to Top 40 radio, Eilish’s team vowed to move slower and more deliberately. “We didn’t want it to be about a song,” said Goodman, who with Danny Rukasin manages Eilish and Finneas. “We never wanted anything to be bigger than Billie the artist.” The label released a nine-track EP, “Don’t Smile at Me,” the next summer, in addition to a steady stream of one-off songs, and watched as each grew exponentially. Although rappers frequently break online, leaving radio to catch up (or not), the holistic, streaming-first path was largely unprecedented for an aspiring pop heavyweight at the time. “For the past two years, people have been like, ‘Whoa, this came out of nowhere overnight!’” said Goodman. Along the way, Eilish has developed into a much stranger, more unique artist than initially promised. Though her voice is pure, her lyrical themes are angsty and bleak — serial killers, domination, monsters under the bed — and on her new album, she favors wobbly beats, jarring turns and creepy sound effects, which flow seamlessly with her visual aesthetic on social media and in her videos. Veering sharply into abject, “American Horror Story” aesthetics, Eilish has bled jet-black liquid from her eye sockets, let a tarantula crawl across her face, and been manhandled and stabbed with needles by disembodied hands, invoking shock artists like Nine Inch Nails and Marilyn Manson more than Taylor Swift or Katy Perry. Crucially, Eilish has also absorbed an at times cartoonish, outlaw essence from the world of rap — without actually trying to rap. Eilish cites Tyler, the Creator, Childish Gambino and the influencer Bloody Osiris as her guiding lights of self-presentation, and her music incorporates now-ubiquitous elements of trap production without feeling forced. “Everyone needs to give hip-hop credit — everyone in the world right now,” Eilish said. “Whatever you’re doing, you’ve been influenced by hip-hop.” Still, she’s a well-adjusted teenager and her core audience remains young women, offering them an original vantage on the rebellions du jour. “Xanny,” a standout from Eilish’s new album, takes on the SoundCloud generation’s dependency of choice — benzos and opioids — with concern and scorn: “I don’t need a xanny to feel better,” she sings. “Don’t give me a xanny now or ever.” She was matter-of-fact about already being a role model. “I completely recognize the responsibility, and I do think about it,” Eilish said. “But it’s not going to change the way that I am.” So far, she has largely managed to avoid the trapdoors of internet controversy that often accompany viral notoriety — something Eilish said she has had nightmares about. But with the increasing heat of fame comes more micro-scrutiny, as Eilish got a taste of recently with the release of the song “Wish You Were Gay.” (Lyrics: “To give your lack of interest an explanation/don’t say I’m not your type/just say that I’m not your preferred sexual orientation.”) “I really tried hard, dude,” she said, responding to the small-scale backlash. “I thought it was so clear that it wasn’t meant as an insult. But I understand it’s a sensitive word for people.” She bristled more at mention of her friendship with the young rapper XXXTentacion, who was murdered last year but previously drew condemnation for allegations of domestic abuse. In the kitchen at home, her mother called, half-jokingly, for Eilish’s publicist in the other room. “I want to be able to mourn, I don’t want to be shamed for it,” said Eilish, who performed a tribute song following XXXTentacion’s death. “I don’t think I deserve getting hate for loving someone that passed.” No one chimed in to coach her. Flanked at all times by her family, Eilish felt sturdy, if a bit jaded, in anticipation of the ways her life would continue to change in the coming months — harder questions, greater expectations, less privacy. Earlier, her brother had described the surreality of Eilish’s rise as “an autonomous thing, and it’s moving forward really fast, and we’re all on it.” Her father chimed in: “It’s a train, or a river, or a vortex, and we’re all flying down.” Finneas added: “But traveling it safely feels much easier than trying to bail out.” Eilish agreed, and said she was working on being in the moment while also keeping perspective, motivated especially by the promise of larger and larger concerts, which have become near-religious experiences for her fans. She flicked nervously at a lighter, singeing a cactus on the table in front of her. “I’m realizing the place I’m in right now is kind of my time, though — my moment,” she said. “These are the good old days.” "
5cab5f5e49f0eacbf1f819bd,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/08/arts/music/beyonce-homecoming-netflix.html,"A year after one of the most critically lauded festival performances in recent pop history, Beychella is coming to Netflix. “Homecoming,” teased by the streaming service as “a film by Beyoncé,” will be available on April 17, according to a trailer released Monday, which shows concert footage and backstage preparations from the singer’s headlining performance at Coachella last year. The documentary will provide an “intimate, in-depth look” at the concert, revealing “the emotional road from creative concept to cultural movement,” Netflix said. The nearly two-hour show at the Empire Polo Club in California featured dozens of musicians backing Beyoncé in the style of historically black college marching bands and traced “a lineage of Southern black musical traditions from New Orleans second line marches to Houston’s chopped-and-screwed hip-hop,” said the critic Jon Caramanica in The New York Times. “There’s not likely to be a more meaningful, absorbing, forceful and radical performance by an American musician this year, or any year soon,” he wrote. “It was rich with history, potently political and visually grand. By turns uproarious, rowdy, and lush. A gobsmacking marvel of choreography and musical direction.” [Read the full review of Beyoncé’s Coachella set.] Beyoncé had been scheduled to headline the festival in 2017, but pushed her performance back a year after becoming pregnant with twins. “Thank you for allowing me to be the first black woman to headline Coachella,” she told the crowd at her comeback show. The trailer for “Homecoming” features clips from rehearsals and Beyoncé’s workout routine, in addition to moments with her children and husband, the rapper Jay-Z, who made a cameo appearance at Coachella. Using a 2013 interview with the poet and activist Maya Angelou, not long before her death the next year, a voice-over on the trailer says, “What I really wanted to do is be a representative of my race — of the human race.” “I have a chance to show how kind we can be, how intelligent and generous we can be,” Angelou continues. “I have a chance to teach and to love and to laugh. And I know that when I finish doing what I’m sent here to do, I will be called home.” "

On “X 100PRE,” he extended his narrative, starting with Latin trap and reggaeton and exploring dembow, pop-punk and synth-pop. It showed an artist not content with sticking strictly to the sounds that be built his success on. What’s next for Bad Bunny? And what were the sounds and movements that set the table for his rapid rise?  On this week’s Popcast: Eduardo Cepeda, who writes a regular column for Remezcla on reggaeton history, and also contributes to Pitchfork and the Nation Suzy Exposito, Latin music editor for Rolling Stone Isabelia Herrera, music editor for Remezcla and a member of the curatorial committee for MoMA PS1’s Warm Up series "

COLONIZED DREAMS: A MIPSTERZ EVENT at the Knockdown Center (March 9, 6:30 p.m.). Mipsterz, a collective whose name merges “Muslim” and “hipsters,” is led by the filmmaker Abbas Rattani, the illustrator Sara Alfageeh and the musician Yusuf Siddiquee and promotes the work of Muslim artists across genres. For this showcase, the group has curated a lineup of Muslim musicians, writers and artists who are mostly from New York. Humeysha, the musical alias of the Brooklyn-based singer-songwriter Zain Alam, blends spacey indie rock with more traditional Indian sounds from instruments like the tabla and puja bells. The D.J. Ayes Cold connects bhangra music with hip-hop and R&B, while the Lebanese-American percussionist Adam Maalouf performs mostly on the pantam, an instrument created from the Trinidadian steel pan and southern India’s ghatam drum. 718-489-6285, knockdown.center MATTHEW DEAR at Elsewhere (March 8, 7 p.m.). A founding artist of the trendy electronic music label Ghostly International, Dear is better known as a bandleader, producer and D.J. whose work is steeped in Detroit techno. He has remixed songs for the likes of the XX and Spoon, and as a soloist, his work has long incorporated nearly equal parts electronic effects and live performance. On his latest album, 2018’s “Bunny,” which features Tegan and Sara and Greg Ahee from Protomartyr, Dear’s voice and songwriting give a more personal dimension to his reliably left-of-center yet dance-floor-ready beats.elsewherebrooklyn.com LITTLE FEAT at the Beacon Theater (March 8, 8 p.m.). At the half-century mark, a number of the musicians behind Little Feat’s best-known songs are still with the group, including the co-founder and pianist Bill Payne, the guitarist Paul Barrere, the percussionist Sam Clayton and the bassist Kenny Gradney. For this celebration of their 50 years onstage, expect a career-spanning retrospective that shows the range of this tricky-to-pin-down band, whose work spans country, funk, R&B and more. Regardless of what they’re playing, though, Little Feat have long been celebrated for their live act. 212-465-6000, beacontheatre.com [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] MEEK MILL at Hammerstein Ballroom (March 12-13, 8 p.m.). This Philadelphia-born rapper’s rise could hardly be more antithetical to 2019’s standard rap narrativeof getting discovered on SoundCloud by a major label, and then steering toward viral fame with the label’s help. Instead, Meek Mill took the long way to the top, first gaining credibility as a battle rapper and flirting with mainstream success, which was derailed by protracted legal battles and stints in prison. The strength of the work from the early years of his career, though — especially “Dreams and Nightmares,” the album cut that has become every underdog’s anthem, and the rapper’s best-known song — helped him push through. Finally, he is back in the world and back on the road. Both shows are sold out, but tickets are available through the resale market. 212-279-7740, mc34.com ROBYN at Madison Square Garden (March 8, 7 p.m.). “I was like, I’m not going to write one single sad love song,” this Swedish pop singer told The New York Times of her latest album, “Honey.” “And then when I started writing, it was sad love song, sad love song, sad love song. But it’s in a different way.” Robyn has spent over two decades turning those sad love songs into nightclub gold, in iterations that have made her both a Billboard hit maker (“Show Me Love” and “Do You Know (What It Takes)” and a cult favorite (“Call Your Girlfriend” and “Dancing on My Own”). 212-465-6741, msg.com WEEZER AND PIXIES at Madison Square Garden (March 12, 7 p.m.). These joint headliners offer some of the most enduring indie rock of the 1980s and ’90s — and TV on the Radio, who are opening, will represent the 2000s. Weezer have continued to release albums at a fairly prolific clip and still own a significant chunk of the alt-rock canon, from “Say It Ain’t So” to “Hash Pipe.” Their most recent brushes with the mainstream, though, have been less expected — namely, a viral cover of Toto’s “Africa.” After playing three nights at the comparatively cozy Brooklyn Steel last November, Pixies are bringing their unorthodox noise pop back to one of the city’s biggest stages.212-465-6741, msg.com NATALIE WEINER EZRA COLLECTIVE at Rough Trade NYC (March 9, 8:30 p.m.). Afrobeat from the 1970s, woozy new R&B, dub reggae and classic backpacker hip-hop all help define the sound of this London-based band’s new disc, “You Can’t Steal My Joy,” due next month. They have become something of a sensation, and the album is likely to be one of the year’s most-talked-about releases from Britain’s thriving contemporary jazz scene. The group — which features the brothers T. J. and Femi Koleoso on bass and drums, respectively; Joe Armon-Jones on keyboards; Dylan Jones on trumpet; and James Mollison on saxophone — will play material from the coming disc at this Brooklyn rock club.roughtradenyc.com VIJAY IYER AND CRAIG TABORN at Roulette (March 12, 8 p.m.). Two leading jazz pianists in their late 40s, Iyer and Taborn each have their own specific formulas, but both are built on a mix of studious abstraction and propulsive weight. Next week they will release their first album as a duo, the expansive, richly improvised “The Transitory Poems,” on ECM Records. The crystalline scatter of Taborn’s playing meets Iyer’s slightly thicker articulation in a sympathetic repartee; the pair seem to constantly divert their own path. They celebrate the album’s arrival at this concert, playing on two grand pianos.917-267-0368, roulette.org ‘IDENTITY: FREEDOM’ at the Kitchen (March 7-9, 8 p.m.). The nonprofit organization Arts for Art organized this series of concerts to highlight some of free jazz’s most respected elders, all of whom are presenting suite-length original works here. The festival begins on Thursday with “Trail of Tears Continuum (1492-2019),” a 90-minute piece composed by the bassist William Parker (a founder of Arts for Art) featuring singers, poets and a five-piece instrumental group, as well as a film component. On Friday, the pianist Dave Burrell debuts “Harlem Renaissance,” a response to the life and work of the dancer Josephine Baker; Burrell’s sextet will play in conversation with two dancers, Marguerite Hemmings and J’royce Jata. The series concludes on Saturday with a presentation of Andrew Cyrille’s “Haitian Fascination” project, in which this storied drummer fuses the music of Haiti — his ancestral home — with avant-garde jazz.212-255-5793, thekitchen.org MIYA MASAOKA at the Park Avenue Armory (March 13, 7 and 9 p.m.). Masaoka’s style on the koto, a long, stringed instrument from Japan, bespeaks deep equanimity: She is comfortable allowing vast amounts of open space — playing quietly, just a few notes at a time — but within that serene composure she strategically builds a feeling of tensile anticipation. You can lie down and stretch out inside her music, but you can’t ever get completely comfortable. An eclectic collaborator across the worlds of traditional and avant-garde music, at the armory she debuts “The Long Arc of Time,” a work inspired by traditional Japanese Buddhist chants and by the poetry of Tracie Morris. The performance will feature Masaoka alongside fellow Japanese and American musicians and the soprano Kamala Sankaram.212-616-3930, armoryonpark.org OMAR SOSA AND SECKOU KEITA at Merkin Hall (March 9, 7:30 p.m.). Sosa, a Cuban pianist of great percussive power and fluid grace, released a collaborative album in 2017 with Keita, a Senegalese master of the kora (a West African stringed instrument typically used to create spiraling layers of rhythm), and the Venezuelan percussionist Gustavo Ovalles. Here the trio will perform some of the pristine, soothing music from that release. All three of these musicians now live in Europe, so a New York sighting is rare — especially featuring all of them together.212-501-3330, kaufmanmusiccenter.org KAMAAL WILLIAMS at Le Poisson Rouge (March 9, 7:30 p.m.). This young keyboardist crafts tightly woven grooves that are equally influenced by the cosmic soul-jazz of the 1970s as they are by the broken-beat and nu-jazz traditions of his native London. Partly thanks to his work in the short-lived but widely acclaimed duo Yussef Kamaal, Williams finds himself at the front of a crowded pack of young keyboardists on the busy British scene. Here he’s likely to draw heavily on the material from his debut solo album, last year’s Herbie Hancock-indebted “The Return.”212-505-3474, lpr.com MIGUEL ZENÓN at the Village Vanguard (March 12-17, 8:30 and 10:30 p.m.). One of the most casually prodigious alto saxophonists of today, Zenón devotes most of his creative energy to exploring the music of his native Puerto Rico, always through a vigorously intellectual lens. Last year he released a striking album, “Yo Soy La Tradición,” featuring music sourced largely from Puerto Rican folk traditions, retrofitted for saxophone and string quartet. And later this month, he will join up again with his longstanding jazz quartet to record a new album devoted to the music of Ismael Rivera, a heroic popular vocalist in Puerto Rico during the late 1960s and the ’70s. At this Vanguard run, the group — featuring Luis Perdomo on piano, Hans Glawischnig on bass and Henry Cole on drums — will set about breaking in this new material.212-255-4037, villagevanguard.comGIOVANNI RUSSONELLO LOU REED DRONES at the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine (March 13, 6:30 p.m.). Physics and music nerds, unite and rejoice! The moment you have been collectively awaiting has arrived: A handful of Lou Reed’s guitars, curated by his technician Stewart Hurwood, will be arranged against a stack of amplifiers and tuned to create a glorious noise that will morph as you wander about in this acoustically splendid cathedral. Holy feedback! It should be glorious.stjohndivine.org/calendarDANIELLE DOWLING "

But “Baby Shark,” a song as infectious as anthrax to which the caretakers of young children likely need no introduction, entered the Billboard Hot 100 chart at No. 32 this week, placing Pinkfong, a South Korean educational brand, alongside the world’s top musical artists. For the uninitiated, click if you dare. “Baby Shark,” which Pinkfong says it based on a “traditional singalong chant,” has been viewed more than 2.1 billion times on YouTube, making it among the 30 most-viewed videos ever. It was streamed 20.8 million times just in the past week, Billboard said, with 73 percent of those streams coming from video. Its rise onto the charts comes long after SmartStudy, a Seoul-based company that has produced thousands of children’s videos under the Pinkfong brand, first posted it on YouTube in November 2015. The company remixed it, adding a new beat and melody, in the now-popular version posted in June 2016. It has now been adapted into more than 100 versions in 11 languages, the company said. The song was helped along by attention from K-pop acts in Korea and spread throughout Southeast Asia before eventually finding its way to the United States in 2018, when a social media challenge invited people to post videos of themselves dancing to the song. Participants included Ellen DeGeneres and James Corden, while Kylie Jenner and Cardi B made references. It first appeared on Billboard’s Kid Digital Song Sales chart in July, followed by the Streaming Songs chart in November. It also made it to the U.K. Top 40, which is not produced by Billboard, in September. Making a Top 40 list is far from easy. Jimi Hendrix made it to Billboard’s just once. Wu-Tang Clan never made it. But today’s charts are different, and often include an eclectic mix of music. Billboard has made a series of changes to its rankings for an era in which viral hits on social media can capture more attention than sustained radio airplay, and consumers download more music than they buy in record shops. In 2012, Billboard began counting digital sales and online streams in its singles chart, immediately lifting “Gangnam Style,” the YouTube hit by the South Korean rapper Psy, to the top of the new Rap Songs chart. In 2014, Billboard and Nielsen SoundScan, the agency that supplies Billboard’s data, added streams and downloads to its album chart formula. Billboard and Nielsen tweaked the formula in July, making streams from paid services like Spotify and Apple Music worth about three times as much as those from “free” users, including YouTube viewers. Bin Jeong, the chief executive of Pinkfong USA, said in an emailed statement that the digital content company is responding to the success of “Baby Shark” by creating toys, DVDs and other consumer products, including books and diapers. The company, which has about 200 employees in offices in South Korea, the United States and China, is also working on TV shorts and a movie, he said. “We are not planning to settle for Baby Shark hitting the music charts and getting YouTube views, but we are developing Pinkfong and Baby Shark into an entertainment brand that will be enjoyed by generations to come,” she said.

PAT GREEN at Terminal 5 (March 2, 7 p.m.). Escape to the Lone Star state at this show, which features four acts whose sound belongs to the Texas-specific country subgenre known as red dirt. Green, who had a string of radio hits in the mid-2000s, is the elder statesman of this lineup. He’ll be joined by the Eli Young Band, who are currently on the country charts with their upbeat single “Love Ain’t,” as well as by Aaron Watson and Kyle Park — two artists who are stalwarts on the rodeo circuit. The common thread is a rough-around-the-edges, rock-tinged take on country music that never strays too far from the genre’s dancehall roots. 212-582-6600, terminal5nyc.com ICE CUBE at Terminal 5 (March 6, 8 p.m.). Gen Z might only know this pioneering Los Angeles-based rapper as an approachable blockbuster star or, most recently, one of the moguls behind the BIG3 basketball league. But this N.W.A. alum still has a rich catalog of songs that were once considered subversive but are now classic. Both in N.W.A. and as a soloist, Ice Cube helped revolutionize rap with his cleareyed lyrics about police brutality, white supremacy and gang life. His unflinching political observations continue on his 2018 release “Everythangs Corrupt,” which includes a song called “Arrest the President.” 212-582-6600, terminal5nyc.com INNOV GNAWA at National Sawdust (March 2, 7:30 p.m.). This collective of Moroccan expatriates makes gnawa, or ritual trance music. It bears some of the same stylistic traits as American blues: call-and-response singing and a stringed instrument (in the case of gnawa, a sintir) that is used to establish harmony. The complicated, endlessly cycling rhythms, though, are distinct to the genre and create a soothing, meditative ambience. This performance is billed not as a concert, but as an “immersive gnawa ritual.” 646-779-8455, nationalsawdust.org [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] LOVE ROCKS NYC at the Beacon Theater (March 7, 8 p.m.). For the third year running, the designer John Varvatos and the real estate broker Greg Williamson have organized an all-star concert to benefit the New York charity God’s Love We Deliver, which provides food and support to people with life-threatening illnesses. This year’s edition will star Robert Plant, Sheryl Crow, Buddy Guy, Grace Potter, Keb’ Mo’, Taj Mahal, Lukas Nelson, Doyle Bramhall II, Bernie Williams, Ivan Neville, Ann and Nancy Wilson, and more, while Whoopi Goldberg and Martin Short host. Even the house band will be filled with music’s A-listers, including Paul Shaffer, the former musical director of “Late Show With David Letterman,” and the prolific drummer Steve Gadd. 212-465-6000, beacontheatre.com THE NEW COLOSSUS FESTIVAL at various locations (March 7-10). For 35 years, the CMJ Music Marathon was New York City’s very own pleasantly overwhelming indie music festival, where up-and-coming artists took over performance spaces every October in the interest of getting heard by myriad journalists and record label reps trolling for talent. But it ended in 2016, and a new festival aims to fill the void it left behind while also catching international artists en route to South by Southwest in Austin, Tex. In its first year as a multiday event, at six different clubs across the Lower East Side, the event will feature over 100 acts, including the Canadian D.I.Y. act Ellis, the Brooklyn-based punk band Thick and the Norwegian alt-pop group Das Body. newcolossusfestival.com KODIE SHANE at S.O.B.’s (March 6, 8 p.m.). At a moment when there are more commercially successful women in rap than there have been at any point since the early 2000s — when, in fact, one of the genre’s biggest and buzziest artists, Cardi B, is a woman — it looks even more foolish than usual to define M.C.s like Chicago’s Kodie Shane by their gender. The 20-year-old rapper, who is based in Atlanta, first drew recognition as a member of Lil Yachty’s Sailing Team collective and favors similarly melodic, AutoTuned verses over trap beats. In place of Yachty’s whimsy, though, on songs like “Sing to Her,” Shane tends toward the undeniably sultry. 212-243-4940, sobs.com SUZANNE VEGA at Café Carlyle (March 5-9, 8:45 p.m.; through March 16). This New York-based singer-songwriter has been composing and performing folk-inspired acoustic tunes since she was a Barnard student in the early 1980s. The venerable cabaret Café Carlyle might be considerably more upscale than Tom’s Restaurant — the Upper West Side student haunt that inspired Vega’s enduring and influential single “Tom’s Diner” — but both offer a glimpse of a bygone New York. A product of the bohemian Greenwich Village folk scene, which has all but disappeared, Vega herself presents an evening of time travel to a completely different period in the city’s history. 800-405-2027, cafecarlylenewyork.com NATALIE WEINER AMBROSE AKINMUSIRE at the Village Vanguard (March 5-10, 8:30 and 10:30 p.m.). A young trumpeter at the top of his game, Akinmusire is coming off the release of last year’s “Origami Harvest,” his stellar fifth album, featuring long-form compositions for voice, string quartet and jazz combo. In the coming week he returns to the Vanguard — a familiar stomping ground — with his quintet, which features Walter Smith III on tenor saxophone, Sullivan Fortner on piano, Harish Raghavan on bass and Justin Brown on drums. Expect original music with a smoky, drifting aesthetic, and group interplay that overflows the formal boundaries of most small-group jazz.212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com KURT ELLING at the Rose Theater (March 1-2, 8 p.m.). An esteemed jazz crooner whose vocal power is matched by his cool sensitivity to each song, Elling presents the premiere of “The Big Blind,” a drama in the format of an old radio musical. Written by Elling and the composer Phil Galdston, it tells of a young jazz singer in midcentury Chicago who’s trying to catch his big break. The show’s cast includes the vocalist Dee Dee Bridgewater (a National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master), the stage actor Ben Vereen, the drummer Ulysses Owens Jr.’s New Century Jazz Orchestra and a Foley artist providing live sound effects.212-721-6500, jazz.org IMPROV NIGHTS at Happylucky No. 1 (March 1-2, 8 p.m.). John Zorn continues to expand the footprint of the Stone, his avant-garde presenting shop, which left behind its spartan digs in Alphabet City last year and moved to the New School’s Glass Box Theater. Now Zorn is planting a flag in central Brooklyn, too: This weekend his new series debuts at Happylucky No. 1, a gallery and event space in Crown Heights. The Stone will be programming concerts there each weekend going forward. (Bookings have already been made through the end of 2019.) Things are kicking off in classic Stone fashion: two nights of round-robin improvisations with some of New York’s leading creative musicians (the cellist Okkyung Lee, the guitarist Mary Halvorson, the percussionist Cyro Baptista and more than a dozen others) performing in randomly thrown-together configurations.www.happyluckyno1.com JULIAN LAGE TRIO at Le Poisson Rouge (March 5, 8:30 p.m.). Lage, a 31-year-old guitar virtuoso, just released a winning new album, “Love Hurts.” It might be the closest thing he’s released to a straight-ahead jazz record. But with the bassist Jorge Roeder and the drummer Dave King — two left-field improvisers a generation ahead of him — at his side, a freewheeling, rock-tinged vibe finds its way in through the seams. Ever the adaptive player, Lage leans into the influences of Pat Martino and John Scofield here, playing his distorted electric guitar in snaky, spiraling lines. The trio’s repertoire ranges from Ornette Coleman to Roy Orbison to some of Lage’s own tunes.212-505-3474, lpr.com ADAM O’FARRILL’S BIRD BLOWN OUT OF LATITUDE AND AARON BURNETT AND THE BIG MACHINE at National Sawdust (March 5, 7 p.m.). A blazing young trumpet talent, O’Farrill will unveil a new nine-piece ensemble that plays original music with a political bent: The tunes he writes for Bird Blown Out of Latitude are inspired by the traumas caused by displacement and forced migration. The tenor saxophonist Burnett is, like O’Farrill, an arresting improviser with an idiosyncratic, confrontational approach to composition. Here he will present material from his recently released album, “Anomaly,” with his combo, the Big Machine.646-779-8455, nationalsawdust.org LINDA MAY HAN OH QUINTET at the Miller Theater (March 2, 8 p.m.). As part of a continuing jazz series at the Miller, Oh, a young bassist, will lead a quintet, showcasing her sturdy, propulsive original compositions, likely drawing from her fine 2017 album, “Walk Against Wind.” Her band at the Miller features the alto saxophonist Greg Ward, the guitarist Matthew Stevens, the pianist Fabian Almazan and the drummer Allan Mednard.212-854-7799, millertheatre.com ALFREDO RODRIGUEZ AND PEDRITO MARTINEZ at Jazz Standard (Feb. 28-March 3, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). Rodriguez, a pianist, and Martinez, a percussionist and vocalist, are masters of Afro-Cuban rhythm who both hail from Havana, though they learned their craft in different settings: Rodriguez at clubs and solares — the housing units where much of Cuba’s African musical inheritance is passed down — and Martinez at various conservatories in the city. On “Duologue,” their new, Quincy Jones-produced album, the pair find plenty of generative energy in the space between their styles.

Let us know at theplaylist@nytimes.com and sign up for our Louder newsletter, a once-a-week blast of our pop music coverage. Maren Morris gets the cursing out of the way right at the top of “Girl,” the first single from her second album, due this year. It’s a reminder she’s a country singer, but not really. “Girl,” which Morris wrote with her “The Middle” collaborator Sarah Aarons, as well as Greg Kurstin, has a bit of Billie Eilish, a little Lana Del Rey, maybe some Alannah Myles. And yet thanks to some meaty guitar, it has a slow-country stubbornness. Morris’s ambivalence extends right to the vocal mix, which obscures her, and the arc of the melody, which gets thickened but never builds or finds resolution. JON CARAMANICA There’s no avoiding it: Dolores O’Riordan’s death a year ago (she died from drowning in a London hotel bathtub after heavy drinking) haunts “All Over Now,” the first song from an album — “In the End,” due April 26 — that the Cranberries completed from demo recordings by O’Riordan and Noel Hogan. In the first verse she sings, “Do you remember, remember the night/at a hotel in London.” It turns out to be a song about seeing a woman trying to pretend she’s not a domestic-violence victim yet not getting involved. Guitars buzz in minor chords over a choppy beat, while O’Riordan’s voice — the demo included vocal harmonies — holds stoic regret. Her death multiplies the sadness of the chorus: “It’s all over now.” JON PARELES Tamaryn, a songwriter originally from New Zealand, has long placed her voice amid washes of reverb-laden guitar, mingling impulses from 1960s girl groups and 1990s shoegaze. “Fits of Rage” snaps her reveries into focus; the guitars still echo, but her voice leaps out from them, demanding accountability from someone who seems about to shrug her off. Her voice grows furious as she declares, “You can’t deny I was so close to you.” Sometimes anger is clarifying. PARELES Here’s a thoroughly convincing period piece: a Phil Spector girl-group beat, three chords and lots of reverb behind Lily & Madeleine singing in unison about passion overriding reason: “I try to keep myself together but I’m losing it anyway.” PARELES Glen Hansard, the Irish songwriter from the Frames, the Swell Season and “Once,” reduces his voice to a depressive, scratchy monotone in the ominous, low-self-esteem love song “I’ll Be You, Be Me,” from an album arriving in April. A ticking snare drum and a skulking bass accompany lines like “My lover is all good things/and I’m the fool whose spell she’s under.” By the end of the song he’s engulfed in a tsunami of strings, choir and feedback, but still too glum to raise his voice. PARELES An adorable video for a pro forma duet from two of Latin music’s rising stars who’ve been playing are-they-or-aren’t-they for months. The song is sweet, a little evanescent. Committed-to-video memories are forever, though. CARAMANICA Dawn (Richard, from Danity Kane) promises a weekend-long sexual marathon in “Sauce,” invoking Rihanna, La Perla and the Kentucky Derby over a slow, undulating trap beat. For nearly the entire track, her lead vocal stays on just two low notes; it couldn’t be more single-minded. But around it, voices and instruments materialize like stray fantasies, and a sweetly unexpected a cappella coda anticipates satisfaction. PARELES In which post-Young Thug fever-pitch syllable squeals finally come full circle and arrive at saccharine-sweet pure-pop accessibility. YNW Melly is one of the most impressive young melodists working — see “Murder on My Mind” — and even though there’s not much material to work with in the verses here, the chorus is bright, effusive and sneakily rich. Kanye is a low-impact accent piece here, singing part of the hook and adding bonus whimsy to the video. CARAMANICA Elena Alexandra Apostoleanu, the Romanian singer who records as Inna, pivots toward pop’s center. A decade ago she was singing in English over house-music beats and EDM synthesizers. But more recently, her high, smiley voice has been heard alongside Latin pop hitmakers like J Balvin, Pitbull and Daddy Yankee, in English and Spanish. In “Sin Ti,” a song about a sudden infatuation, she whispers insistent endearments in a catchy, extremely canny production by David Ciente that hops all over the Latin map: dembow verses and flamenco-tinged acoustic guitar in the chorus, with bits of sampled vocals and fleeting string-section phrases winking in and out of earshot. In a small world, she’s up-to-the-minute. PARELES Echoing the keyboard chords of Bruce Springsteen’s “My Hometown,” the Killers’ “Land of the Free” is a compendium of issues — mass incarceration, immigration, racism, gun control — heading into a gospelly chorus. The video clip, centered on news footage, is by Spike Lee; the Killers’ willingness to face a social-media backlash is as significant as the song. JON PARELES Snarky Puppy might be today’s most popular band whose audience wouldn’t be fazed by a nearly 10-minute-long lead single with no words. “Xavi” is the first thing we’re hearing from “Immigrance,” a forthcoming album from this large ensemble of virtuoso music nerds and studio hotshots. Crunchy guitar slices out a truncated phrase in conversation with an insistent snare drum, and flutes and trumpets drape a humid cloud cover overhead. The tune’s head-nodding six-beat rhythm is based around an antique chaabi groove, which Snarky’s bassist and leader, Michael League, learned from Gnawa musicians while performing in Morocco last year. It accords with “Immigrance’s” overall bent, which considers the role of migration and exchange in shaping our world. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO The alto saxophonist Greg Ward’s new album, “Stomping Off From Greenwood,” has the rusted, resonant sound of so much beat-driven jazz coming from Chicago natives today (Jeff Parker, Makaya McCraven, Marquis Hill). But its instrumentation — alto sax, two guitars, bass, drums — calls to mind another standout album from last year, Logan Richardson’s “Blues People.” Like Richardson on his album, Ward bobs gracefully through a coolly plotted improvisation on “The Contender” as his rhythm section handles a stop-and-start polyrhythm, creating friction and expectation and the illusion of an incline for Ward to climb.

MARC COHN at City Winery (Jan. 6, 7:30 p.m.). For those who prefer their rock on the softer side and with a healthy dose of blues, singer-songwriter Marc Cowhn — best known for his hit “Walking In Memphis” — is headlining a near-ideal evening of music. Also performing are John Oates and his Good Road Band, who recently released “Arkansas,” a rootsy album designed in part as a tribute to legendary bluesman Mississippi John Hurt, and then Cohn will get vocal support from legendary harmonists the Blind Boys of Alabama. 212-608-0555, citywinery.com MDOU MOCTAR at Baby’s All Right (Jan. 4, 8 p.m.). The robust rock tradition among the Tuareg people — a Berber group with origins around the southern Sahara — has long been represented internationally by artists like Bombino and Tinariwen. Moctar, a singer-songwriter, offers a subtler, more intimate variation on their desert blues with his most recent album “Sousoume Tamachek.” Translated from the Tuareg dialect in which he sings, the title of the soothing, stripped-down release fittingly translates to something like “calm down.” He’s responsible for every note on the album, layering electric and acoustic guitar, percussion, and singing with mesmerizing results. 718-599-5800, babysallright.com NEW POWER GENERATION at Sony Hall (Jan. 4, 7:30 p.m.). Prince’s backing band for over 20 years, the New Power Generation reunited shortly after his death in 2016. While the Revolution, who are also currently touring, were the primary support for Prince’s 1980s output, the New Power Generation — whose long tenure belied a much less consistent personnel — played behind his 1990s and 2000s compositions and performances. Their setlists span the singer’s career, though, for fans new and old who want to hear Prince’s music in as close to its original form as is still possible live.212-997-5123, sonyhall.com NONAME at Brooklyn Steel (Jan. 5-6, 8 p.m.). Upon first listen, the Chicago rapper’s music sounds laid-back and understated. “I make lullaby rap music,” she explained recently on Twitter, a description as concise and apt as most of her rapid-fire yet still conversational verses. But even though her volume rarely goes above piano, Noname has attitude and depth to spare as she raps over asymmetrical grooves that have a live, unprocessed sound. On her recent full-length debut “Room 25,” there are lines salacious enough to garner their own headlines alongside philosophical manifestos, as on “No Name”: “’Cause when we walk into heaven, nobody’s name’s gonna exist/Just boundless movement for joy, nakedness radiance.” Both shows are sold out, but tickets are available via the secondary market.888-929-7849, bowerypresents.com/brooklyn-steel OZOMATLI at Sony Hall (Jan. 5, 7:30 p.m.). The Los Angeles band’s goal has long been to capture that they see as a melange of genres: cumbia, salsa, rock, hip-hop, reggae and funk. This past year was the 20th anniversary of their self-titled debut album, which earned them a spot opening for Santana on the 1999 “Supernatural” tour. Since, they’ve been among the most reliable purveyors of Latin rock, often foregrounding issues around immigration, social justice and worker’s rights (the band’s members first met while trying to unionize a community center). 212-997-5123, sonyhall.com CL SMOOTH at S.O.B.’s (Jan. 10, 8 p.m.). When the rapper released his best-known single “They Reminisce Over You (T.R.O.Y.)” alongside producer Pete Rock, he was just 23. Over two decades later, the song’s carefully crafted bars and jazz-sampling beat remain etched in hip-hop history, giving its titular reminiscence new meaning. In a recent interview, CL Smooth reflected on how the music has evolved since the duo’s heyday during what’s often called hip-hop’s golden age. “I wouldn’t change anything.”212-243-4940, sobs.com NATALIE WEINER GLOBALFEST at the Copacabana (Jan. 6, 7 p.m.). As always, the 16th annual Globalfest features a broad range of acts from across the world. Highlights this year include the Calcutta-based Pandit Debashish Bhattacharya, who plays Indian ragas on the slide guitar, in a style descended of the sitar; the Cuban mambo revivalists of Orquesta Akokán; and Gato Preto, an electronic duo exploring music from across the African diaspora. All told, the evening boasts performances from a dozen bands across three stages at the Copacabana, one of Manhattan’s most storied nightclubs. globalfest.org CRAIG HARRIS at Nublu 151 (Jan. 6, 7 p.m.). Harris, a trombonist, is celebrating the release of “Brown Butterfly,” an ambitious album paying homage to the legacy of Muhammad Ali. The suite laces gnarled horn arrangements and spoken tributes to Ali over protean rhythms, drawing on influences as varied as Count Basie’s big band and the drum-and-bass of 1990s London; the music emulates the rugged grace and mercurial power of Ali in the ring. Harris’s band includes Kahlil Kwame Bell on percussion, Calvin Jones on bass, Adam Klipple on piano, Tony Lewis on drums and Jay Rodriguez on saxophone. nublu.net CHRISTIAN SANDS at Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola (Jan. 5-6, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). A 29-year-old pianist and bandleader of increasing renown, Sands is aligned with jazz’s straight-ahead mainstream, but he’s got an unbounded inquisitive instinct. He sounds like he listens to Oscar Peterson, Jason Moran and Eddie Palmieri in about equal doses. He performs this Saturday with a quartet including the guitarist Caio Afiune, the bassist Yasushi Nakamura and the drummer David Rosenthal; that group will likely draw heavily from Sands’s most recent album, “Facing Dragons.” On Sunday, he returns with a trio featuring the bassist Luques Curtis and the drummer Terreon Gully. The latter show is a tribute to Erroll Garner; Sands serves as the creative ambassador for the Erroll Garner Jazz Project, a group dedicated to furthering the canonical pianist’s legacy. 212-258-9595, jazz.org/dizzys JEN SHYU AND JADE TONGUE at the Jazz Gallery (Jan. 9, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). A vocalist, poet and movement artist, Shyu is equally devoted to open-ended abstraction and absorptive storytelling. Here she presents “In Healing/Zero Grasses,” a new project with her longstanding group, Jade Tongue, that features a characteristically radical admixture of song, spoken poetry and outré improvisation, all aimed at healing humanity’s relationship with the natural environment. Jade Tongue includes Ambrose Akinmusire on trumpet, Mat Maneri on viola, Thomas Morgan on bass and Dan Weiss on drums. 646-494-3625, jazzgallery.nyc BEN WENDEL HIGH HEART AND KENDRICK SCOTT ORACLE at ShapeShifter Lab (Jan. 6, 7 p.m.). Wendel and Scott are two of the most admired composer-bandleaders among today’s young music students and devotees of jazz’s modern mainstream. Here Wendel, a saxophonist, will present the debut of High Heart, a new acoustic-electric ensemble with the vocalist Michael Mayo, the keyboardists Shai Maestro and Gerald Clayton, the bassist Joe Sanders and the drummer Nate Wood. Scott, a drummer, will perform with Oracle, a vessel for his shimmering, gently propulsive compositions; in its current iteration, the group includes Sanders on bass, John Ellis on saxophone, Taylor Eigsti on piano and Mike Moreno on guitar. shapeshifterlab.com WINTER JAZZFEST (Jan. 4-12). Now in its 15th year, the Winter Jazzfest has never had a more bountiful lineup of contemporary jazz talent. Its beloved weekend marathon — featuring simultaneous shows at venues across Lower Manhattan — will now stretch across two weekends: a “Half Marathon” will set the pace this Saturday, with a fuller, two-night marathon taking place a week later, on Jan. 11-12. In the week between, one-off concerts will be held nearly every night at a variety of venues. Highlights include Sunday’s New York debut of the pianist Arturo O’Farrill’s “Fandango at the Wall,” a suite he first performed at the United States-Mexican border this past spring, with a multinational federation of musicians; and a concert on Thursday with the saxophone luminaries Pharoah Sanders and Gary Bartz performing together. Both of those shows, and many others at the festival, will take place at Le Poisson Rouge. winterjazzfest.comGIOVANNI RUSSONELLO "

The show paid mere lip service to the successes of women and nonwhite performers, and were boring to boot. So the bar for this year’s ceremony, which took place Sunday at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, was low, and the remit was clear: do everything the opposite of how it has been done. To some degree, the 61st annual Grammy Awards delivered. Though there were ample tributes to the music of decades past, and some awkwardly cut-short speeches (see: Drake, Dua Lipa), there were also performances from worthy young singers (Camila Cabello, H.E.R.), rising hip-hop stars (Cardi B, Travis Scott) and the next generation of Americana royalty (Kacey Musgraves, Brandi Carlile). That most of the show’s most impressive moments came from women was a rebuke to all the recent years in which the Grammys seemed content to sideline impressive female talent.

5c3762793a125f5075c03bd6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/10/arts/music/gaga-r-kelly-apology.html,"Lady Gaga, the pop singer and Academy Award hopeful for her role in “A Star Is Born,” became the latest musician to apologize for collaborating with R. Kelly, the R&B singer who has long been accused of sexual misconduct and preying on teenagers, after the broadcast of an explosive investigative documentary detailing the allegations against him. In a post across her social media channels just after midnight on Thursday, Lady Gaga said she was sorry for making the song “Do What U Want” with Kelly in 2013 and pledged to remove the track from iTunes and other streaming platforms. “I’m sorry, both for my poor judgment when I was young and for not speaking out sooner,” she wrote, citing her own trauma from being sexually assaulted. “My intention was to create something extremely defiant and provocative because I was angry and still hadn’t processed the trauma that had occurred in my own life.” Lady Gaga, along with artists like Jay-Z and Chance the Rapper, has for years faced criticism for collaborating with Kelly, with scrutiny intensifying again as a result of the documentary, “Surviving R. Kelly,” which aired on Lifetime. (Kelly has continuously denied the allegations against him.) [Read more about the decades of sexual abuse allegations detailed in the documentary.] “Do What U Want” was controversial when it debuted, with many fans rejecting the collaboration based on much earlier reports about Kelly’s behavior with women. The single’s music video, which was never released, was shot and directed by the photographer Terry Richardson, who has also faced repeated accusations of sexual misconduct. Lady Gaga previously defended the song, calling it a “natural collaboration.” At a 2013 news conference, she said, “R. Kelly and I have sometimes very untrue things written about us, so in a way this was a bond between us.” Following the airing of the Lifetime series, Chance the Rapper apologized “to all of his survivors for working with him and for taking this long to speak out.” He added: “The truth is any of us who ever ignored the R. Kelly stories, or ever believed he was being setup/attacked by the system (as black men often are) were doing so at the detriment of black women and girls.” [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] Representatives for Jay-Z, who released collaborative albums with Kelly in 2002 and 2004, have declined to comment. Sony Music, which oversees Kelly’s record label, RCA, has also declined to comment on the allegations. In her post, Lady Gaga wrote: “I stand behind these women 1000 percent, believe them, know they are suffering and in pain, and feel strongly that their voices should be heard and taken seriously.” The singer has previously spoken out about her own sexual assault at age 19. In 2015, she released “Til It Happens to You,” a ballad about sexual assault for the documentary “The Hunting Ground,” which examined the issue of campus rape. “If I could go back and have a talk with my younger self,” Lady Gaga added in her apology, “I’d tell her to go through the therapy I have since then, so that I could understand the confused post-traumatic state that I was in.” “Surviving R. Kelly,” which aired in six parts last week, covered the long history of allegations against Kelly and featured women who described being controlled or abused by him, often when they were teenagers. “I wish that he would experience a kind of social death, and that people who still vociferously declare him innocent — or their favorite artist, or worthy of having his work separated from who he is — that they are denied that,” said dream hampton, an executive producer of the documentary. Prosecutors in Chicago and Atlanta are now looking into the allegations against him, and have called for potential witnesses and victims to come forward. [Laughing at R. Kelly helped us ignore the charges against him. No longer, a Times culture critic writes.] In 1994, when Kelly was 27, he married the singer Aaliyah Haughton, who was 15 but was listed as 18 on a wedding certificate, according to Vibe Magazine. The marriage was annulled in 1995. Ms. Haughton died in a plane crash in 2001. Kelly was also accused of having sex with a teenager in a lawsuit in 1996, and again in 2001. Both lawsuits were settled, but the journalist Jim DeRogatis, who reported on them, continued to investigate the accusations against Kelly. In 2002, a video that appeared to show Kelly having sex with a teenage girl and urinating in her mouth was sent to Mr. DeRogatis at The Chicago Sun-Times, which reported that the footage was being investigated by the Chicago police. Later that year, Kelly was indicted by a grand jury in Chicago for child pornography. In the more than five years it took for his case to go to trial, he continued to release popular music, including the chart-topping song “Ignition (Remix).” He was found not guilty. "

ANI CORDERO at the David Rubenstein Atrium at Lincoln Center (Jan. 31, 7:30 p.m.). The New York-based singer and instrumentalist uses music to tap into her Puerto Rican heritage, performing traditional music from the island, as well as from around Latin America (she’s worked with the Brazilian ensemble Os Mutantes, among others). Specifically, on her debut solo release in 2014, “Recordar,” Cordero paid tribute to Latin American music’s history of protest songs, offering her rendition of compositions by artists like Mexico’s Chavela Vargas and Chile’s Violeta Parra. This concert is free, and the Puerto Rican pop singer JOATA will open. 212-721-6500, lincolncenter.org RYAN HURD at Bowery Ballroom (Jan. 25, 8 p.m.). Like many artists working to break through in Nashville, Hurd has an impressive roster of songs that he’s co-written for country stars: Darius Rucker, Dierks Bentley, Florida Georgia Line and Tim McGraw. While writing “Last Turn Home” for McGraw, Hurd met his wife, Maren Morris; now he’s guest-starring in her music videos. The songs he writes for himself are charmingly romantic, painting pictures of understated, easy affection. On “Love in a Bar” (which, naturally, is about Morris) he sings about falling hard for someone while sharing a few beers; his latest single, “To a T,” is an ode to a cozy night in. Both show his flair for believable love songs that aren’t cloyingly sweet. 212-260-4700, boweryballroom.com LES SAVY FAV at Junction (Jan. 25, 8 p.m.) and Elsewhere (Jan. 26, 7 p.m.). On Friday and Saturday, this art-punk quintet will perform their first local shows in more than two years. The band members have been experimenting with noise, pop and punk music for over two decades, but at this point — nearly nine years after their last new album, and with two members locked into a regular gig on “Late Night With Seth Meyers” — Les Savy Fav’s raucous, unpredictable live shows remain their calling card. Their gig at Junction in Long Beach, N.Y., is a benefit for Tommy Brull Foundation, an organization dedicated to helping people with special needs on Long Island; the band’s set at Elsewhere is sold out, but tickets are available through resellers. 516-889-1680, junction11561.comelsewherebrooklyn.com KACEY MUSGRAVES at the Beacon Theater (Jan. 25-26, 8 p.m.). A young country singer selling out two nights at one of New York City’s biggest theaters is newsworthy in and of itself; the fact that said country singer, Musgraves, is a woman working at a moment when country radio seems to be hostile to female artists only adds to the significance of this success. Long a critical darling, Musgraves took a pop-oriented swing with her mellow, sweet 2018 release, “Golden Hour,” and with its Grammy nomination for album of the year, she appears to have hit a home run. Tickets for both shows are available on the resale market. 212-465-6000, beacontheatre.com WU-TANG CLAN at Terminal 5 (Jan. 26-27, 8 p.m.). As part of the extended 25th anniversary celebration for their seminal 1993 debut, “Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers),” this Staten Island-bred rap group is performing two rare New York shows. Many of Wu-Tang’s nine founding members, including GZA, RZA, Method Man, Ghostface Killah and Raekwon, have found substantial success outside the group; “36 Chambers,” though, still holds importance. RZA recently told Complex of the release that “each of our lyrics are potent and become more substantiated as time goes on.” Both shows are sold out, but tickets are available through resellers. 212-582-6600, terminal5nyc.com [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] YOUNG DOLPH at Gramercy Theater (Jan. 31, 7 p.m.). Succeeding in rap without first rising through the ranks in one of its hubs — New York, Chicago, Atlanta or Los Angeles — is challenging. Yet Young Dolph’s commitment to representing his hometown, Memphis, remains steadfast. He’s also stayed independent, another unlikely choice for an M.C. who trades in catchy trap beats and streetwise lyrics just slightly more hard edged than the current trends on commercial rap radio. Fresh off his biggest solo success to date with the single “Major,” though, Dolph is starting to reap some rewards. The show is sold out, but tickets are available on the resale market.212-614-6932, thegramercytheatre.comNATALIE WEINER BRAXTON COOK at Baby’s All Right (Jan. 25, 8 p.m.). A gifted young alto saxophonist and vocalist, Cook is both a graduate of Juilliard’s notoriously traditionalist jazz program and a veteran of Christian Scott aTunde Adjuah’s genre-bending ensembles. In his increasingly acclaimed solo projects, Cook builds a contemporary, jazz-pop identity that draws from 1970s fusion, ’80s R&B and contemporary Los Angeles hip-hop. Through it all, he finds a way to let his bebop-rooted saxophone improvisations shine. At this concert, featuring a guest appearance from the trumpeter Theo Croker, he will draw material from “No Doubt,” an album he released late last year.babysallright.com ANTONIO HART QUINTET at Smoke (Jan. 25-26, 7, 9 and 10:30 p.m.). Hart, a stellar alto saxophonist who burst onto the New York scene alongside Roy Hargrove in the early 1990s as part of the Young Lions generation, has always worn his debt to Cannonball Adderley on his cuffs. Here he presents a tribute to Adderley, an iconic hard-bop saxophonist, in a quintet that features Freddie Hendrix on trumpet, Caili O’Doherty on piano, Alex Ayala on bass and Cory Cox on drums.212-864-6662, smokejazz.com VIJAY IYER at Jazz Standard (through Jan. 27, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). Iyer’s sextet has been one of the hottest commodities in jazz since the release of its debut, “Far From Over,” in 2017. A version of that band will play on Friday and Saturday, presenting Iyer’s beaming, rhythmically interleaved original music. Then on Sunday, Iyer will perform with a newer group that features some of his colleagues and students at Harvard University, where he teaches. (He’s also a MacArthur fellow.) That band is called the Ritual Ensemble, and it features Ganavya Doraiswamy on vocals, Yosvany Terry on saxophones and Rajna Swaminathan on mridangam, an Indian percussion instrument.212-576-2232, jazzstandard.com AVA MENDOZA ET AL. at H0L0 (Jan. 31, 7 p.m.). A conclave of young avant-garde improvisers will descend on this darkened basement in Ridgewood, Queens, for a night of free playing. It’s hard to know where things will go; if you go, steel yourself for a wide variety of musical textures and temperaments, most of them liberated from standard time and harmony. The performers include the thrashing, post-metal guitarist Ava Mendoza; the pensive tenor saxophonist Ingrid Laubrock; and the bassist Brandon Lopez, who uses his instrument in a variety of nontraditional ways.h0l0.nyc ‘THE MUSIC OF ANTHONY BRAXTON’ at Roulette (Jan. 25, 8 p.m.). One of the premier — and most prolific — living American composers, Braxton continues to release reams of new music, typically drawing on improvisation and built around his own complex musical systems. On Friday his 12-disc collection titled “GTM (Syntax) 2017,” featuring his Tri-Centric Vocal Ensemble, comes out. Here an 11-person version of that group performs in celebration of the record’s release.

Every recording Smith releases feels apt to be called a “landmark.” It’s the awe-inspiring, wide-screen breadth of his trumpet sound, the slowly accruing power of his compositions, and his way of making even small ensembles sound spacious — and ancient. “America’s National Parks,” his widely acclaimed 2016 release celebrating the natural wonders of North America, stands out in particular for its tumultuous melodic beauty and the bristling, mutating forms of its compositions. At Jazz at Lincoln Center, Smith presents the New York City debut of this work, joined by the personnel from the album: the pianist Anthony Davis, the cellist Ashley Walters, the bassist John Lindberg and the drummer Pheeroan akLaff.212-721-6500, jazz.orgGIOVANNI RUSSONELLO "

A couple of months ago, the 22-year-old musician who records as Rat Boy rented a huge empty warehouse a short walk to a lovely little stream and a slightly longer walk to a small black sign leaning against a decayed wall that reads FARM TOILET. Here, slowly, he, his father, and brother have been building out the raw space into a place — inspired by the Beastie Boys’ old G-Son Studios in Los Angeles — where he can work, and also play. A few days before Christmas, it was mostly empty save for a roughly fashioned studio. On one wall was a Public Enemy “Fear of a Black Planet” poster. On a shelf was an autographed vinyl copy of the Beastie Boys’ “Hello Nasty.” On the center table, an old issue of the Beasties’ publication Grand Royal and some obscure graffiti magazines. Up against the wall, a small-scale screen printing rig and several of Cardy’s ghoulishly realistic illustrations. Sitting on a pallet under a blanket was an Amek Einstein console, the same kind that the Dust Brothers used to work on, that Cardy bought for about 6,000 pounds on the internet from Peru. It’s the most money he’s ever spent on anything, he said, but he still wasn’t sure it worked. This month Cardy will release the second Rat Boy album, “Internationally Unknown,” a high-energy collision of punk convulsion and hip-hop storytelling full of raucously fun, sharp-tongued songs about slackerdom, resistance and disorderly joy. It’s shaped by late 1970s punk with flickers of dub, nods to 1990s hip-hop (and also the early 2000s English rapper the Streets), and embraces the musical exuberance of 2000s pop-punk. Which is to say, it is an extremely of-the-moment amalgam, refusing to draw distinctions between genres. It’s also part of a long continuum of British punk that looks for kinship in black music and part of a wider re-engagement with the 1990s as source material. [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] The 1990s are the leading touchstone for Cardy, who has studied the era with loving devotion and built a specific, refined aesthetic from it: “It’s a bunch of people that are around my age making something for themselves. I love the way stuff looks — making their own magazines, the music, being motivated to put stuff out,” he said, slumped in a chair wearing a Supreme bottle cap T-shirt, his hair pink and scraggly. “They did everything right, but did they know they were doing it right?” “I kind of see Jordan as the nexus of what was happening in the ’90s when punk and hip-hop were blowing up,” said Brett Gurewitz, the founder and chief executive of Epitaph Records, which is releasing “Internationally Unknown” via its Hellcat imprint. “Rat Boy is the embodiment of that time.” Similarly, Cardy, too, has been figuring things out by trial and error. For a young person gravitating toward art and music, Chelmsford — he grew up in this city of around 100,000, and hasn’t lived elsewhere — was an unremarkable place to be. Mostly, Cardy hung out with friends at the city’s lone skate park. When he became curious about music, YouTube was his university. “I used to watch thousands of videos,” he said. Cardy’s natural artistic curiosity was buttressed by a creeping sense of outsiderness. “When I was in school when I was a kid, I did feel like there were not, like, people that were into the same stuff,” he said. “Everyone was into what was happening around here, and I’m just liking [expletive] that happened 20 years ago.” He became increasingly inspired after seeing the early success of King Krule, the London singer and songwriter who, in the early 2010s, when he was still a teenager, broke through with a fascinating punk-jazz hybrid: “It really motivated me to see someone like that doing it at that age.” When Cardy finally began posting his self-produced songs to SoundCloud, he began emailing the links as widely as he could. One of the first people in the music business he met was Drew McConnell, who plays bass in the British band Babyshambles (which is fronted by Pete Doherty) and was introduced to Cardy’s music by an intern at his publishing company. Before long, McConnell was setting up management and label meetings for Cardy, who was sleeping on his sofa. [Here are 10 more artists to watch in 2019.] “He had obviously listened to a lot of records,” McConnell said. “The way he would sing would remind me of Elvis Costello, or Robert Smith from the Cure. But at the same time he’s a huge hip-hop fan.” Cardy signed to Parlophone — home to Babyshambles and also Coldplay — and began working on his first album, “Scum,” a loose and exciting collection of songs that range from punk to dub to hip-hop. (An early version of one of them was sampled on Kendrick Lamar’s “Lust,” from his 2017 album “DAMN.”) “That’s what I thought a first record is, I thought like it’s all over the place,” Cardy said. “It was just guessing.” On the album’s deluxe version, the songs are interwoven with skits, in part because Cardy felt like the songs themselves didn’t tell a consistent story. “When the record was done it was kind of like, ‘You need to have a single’ at the end,” he said. And while he obliged, “I released two songs as singles that are [expletive] in my opinion, trying to write a pop song.” McConnell joked that a mainstream record label signing Cardy was like the government capturing a disruptive hacker “and being like, ‘you work for us now.’” For his second album, Cardy knew he wanted to tell a more consistent story, and was introduced to Tim Armstrong, of the California street-punk legends Operation Ivy and Rancid and the punk-hip-hop hybrid pioneers Transplants, and also Gurewitz’s partner in Hellcat. When they first spoke on the phone, the first thing they agreed on was tempo: 170 bpm, fast enough for punk mayhem but also, at half time, a comfortable in-the-pocket pace for rapping. Cardy went to Los Angeles and spent six weeks working with Armstrong at the Boat, once the studio of the Dust Brothers. (John King of the Dust Brothers also worked on the new album.) They recorded live takes, then chopped up and sampled the results. The guitars are hard-charging and dirty, and the rapping and singing is delivered with a blend of sneer and ennui: On “I Wanna Skate,” he’s yelling in the most casual manner, “You want it now? I wanna wait!/You want a Benz? I wanna skate!” In person, Cardy is gentle and soft-edged. But on both his first and second records, his attitude is consistent: a permanently extended middle finger to authority, and a robust sense of working class agitation. His best songwriting is in a narrative style that he learned listening to hip-hop: Slick Rick’s “Children’s Story,” Prince Paul’s “A Prince Among Thieves,” Too Short. AFTER TALKING FOR a while in his new studio, Cardy hopped in a van driven by his guitar tech, Tuck. (Chelmsford is a small enough city that it was Tuck who sold 12-year-old Cardy his first guitar.) They headed over to Cardy’s family’s house, where the yard overflowed with half-finished projects belonging to his dad, Brett, who does fabrication work on automobiles and other vehicles. It was Brett who introduced a 6-year-old Cardy to the first Transplants album. And it was Brett’s example of making something from nothing that Cardy identifies as the germ of his own D.I.Y. instincts. Until he was around 18, Cardy assumed he’d become a graphic designer, or maybe a tattoo artist. Some of his earliest art — inspired by the cars his father worked on, and the ones they raced on weekends — was in the style of Ed Roth, the hot rod artist. When he was young, art and music were always commingled; he’d have Myspace pages for bands with song art but no songs. He still does all the artwork for his projects — “I always thought you do everything yourself,” he said — films wild CKY-style videos with his friends, and also has a budding streetwear line, Scum. His father wasn’t home, so Cardy arranged to meet him at the local garage where he was working for the day. On the way, he pointed out a lone Rat Boy graffiti tag on the back of a road sign near a roundabout. A few minutes later he found his father jawing away with a couple of car-customizer friends. Brett is salty, profane, thick-skinned — a bruiser to Cardy’s anxious artist. But Brett also supports Cardy’s flights of creative fancy. The Burberry tartan-painted car from Cardy’s early music videos was done by Brett (and part of it is in Cardy’s warehouse, along with some other vehicles Brett chopped-and-remixed). Their conversation was amiable, a little punchy. Cardy recalled how Brett never pushed him to pursue things he didn’t feel strongly about, like schoolwork: “It’s always been, like, do what you want to do.” They spoke about Cardy’s music and the unlikeliness of his performance intensity, joked about living in close quarters and celebrated hating authority. Recalling when Cardy was first learning to race cars, Brett explained his hands-off parenting philosophy, which felt like the foundation for all of Cardy’s subsequent life choices. “Just let him crash,” Brett said. “He ain’t going to do it twice.” "
5cb0ffb249f0eacbf1f838dc,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/12/arts/music/coachella-live-stream.html,"Merely headlining Coachella? You’re doing it wrong. These days, the festival’s biggest past and present stars are hacking it. From new films by Donald Glover and Beyoncé to a one-morning-only Easter performance by Kanye West, this year’s fest in Indio, Calif., comes with a shadow billing of bonus, semi-sanctioned content aimed far beyond the main stage.  The extracurricular activity signifies the evolution of one of the country’s largest music festivals from a mostly self-contained arbiter of status — able to confer cultural relevance in a font size on its lineup posters — into something more like an all-purpose tool for today’s globally minded performers, accustomed in the digital age to serving many audiences at once and on their own terms. For fans, more off-platform programming at Coachella means it’s easier than ever to avoid FOMO without coughing up a half-grand and trekking to the desert. Here’s a short guide. The rapper Childish Gambino, alias of the entertainer Donald Glover, is unveiling a new movie and has a headlining set this weekend. A mysterious trailer for the film, called “Guava Island,” had its premiere at Glover’s PHAROS festival in November, crediting the co-stars Rihanna, Letitia Wright, Nonso Anozie and the director Hiro Murai (“Atlanta,” “This Is America”), and sending internet sleuths into overdrive. The secrets of “Guava Island” were revealed Thursday night at an early screening on the Coachella campgrounds, and it debuted during Childish Gambino’s set. The movie is neither a visual album à la “Lemonade,” as some fans predicted, nor a traditional feature, but something in between. Kyle Buchanan of The New York Times attended the screening and described it as “a music-driven fable” set in Cuba that pairs refurbished Gambino hits, including “This Is America” and “Summertime Magic,” with a slight plot concerning love, music and capitalism.  The film will be available to stream free on Amazon for 18 hours, from 3 a.m. to 9 p.m. Eastern on Saturday and will remain available for Prime Video members. Saturday, April 13, 3 a.m. Eastern All year, Kanye West has been hosting a roving, informal, invite-only Sunday morning concert series — Sunday Service — featuring a gospel choir and sanctified renditions of his songs and others.  Guests have reportedly included Katy Perry and David Letterman, but the Coachella crowd (and viewers watching on the live stream) will get to hear the gospel on the second Sunday of the festival, which falls on Easter this year.  In January, Billboard reported that West had originally been set to headline both weekends of the festival, but he pulled out at the last minute because of a dispute over his desire to perform in a custom dome. It’s unsurprising, then, that he’s chosen an equally nontraditional venue for the Sunday Service show — a hill (or “mountain,” as West called it in an announcement video) on land usually reserved for campgrounds. Sunday, April 21, Time T.B.A. (West has said 9 a.m. Pacific.) One of the most disruptive Coachella performances in recent memory took place last year, when Beyoncé — the first African-American woman to headline the festival — transformed her set into a robust, kinetic survey of the collegiate traditions and musical lineage of black America. That show is the subject of “Homecoming,” a new, behind-the-scenes documentary debuting on Netflix the Wednesday between the two weekends of this year’s festival.  The original performance was the most-watched Coachella live stream ever, with more than 458,000 concurrent viewers. Now, the artist will deliver a remixed, 360-degree view of the experience to Netflix’s millions of subscribers. Wednesday, April 17  For the first time, Coachella will live stream its second weekend on YouTube in addition to Weekend 1. Tune in for a special at-home viewing experience featuring short documentaries on, and original commentary from, top-billed performers. April 19-21  "
5c60dd433a125f5075c0900b,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/10/arts/music/michelle-obama-grammys.html,"Follow our coverage and analysis of the 2019 Grammy Awards. Those expecting a ho-hum Grammys night were surely jolted awake on Sunday when, just minutes into the show, Michelle Obama walked onto the stage hand-in-hand with Lady Gaga, Jada Pinkett Smith and Jennifer Lopez. They were joined by the host Alicia Keys. In the surprise appearance, which doubled as a moment of female solidarity the Grammys needed, Obama spoke to the crowd as it erupted in applause and cheers. “All right, all right, we got a show to do,” Obama, who wore a loose-fitting shimmering silver jumpsuit, said playfully when the audience wouldn’t settle down. [Here’s the full list of Grammys winners.] “From the Motown records I wore out on the South Side to the ‘who run the world’ songs that fueled me through this last decade, music has always helped me tell my story, and I know that’s true for everybody here,” she continued, referring to the Chicago neighborhood where she was raised. “Whether we like country or rap or rock, music helps us share ourselves, our dignity and sorrows, our hopes and joys. It allows us to hear one another, to invite each other in. Music shows us that all of it matters — every story within every voice, every note within every song. Is that right ladies?” she said as many in the crowd remained standing. The moment could not have come at a better time for the show. Last year, the event, which has struggled to stay relevant, came under fire for a statement made by Neil Portnow, the chief executive of the Recording Academy. Women in music should “step up” to advance their careers, he had said. The academy has since changed its membership and nominations process in efforts to address underlying problems of inequality. On Sunday night, the women onstage with Obama spoke about how music gave them a space to explore who they are. “They said I was weird, that my look, my choices, my sound, that it wouldn’t work,” Lady Gaga said. “But music told me not to listen to them. Music took my ears, took my hands, my voice and my soul, and it led me to all of you and to my Little Monsters who I love so much.” Next, Pinkett Smith spoke. “We express our pain, power, progress through music — whether we’re creating it, or just appreciating it,” she said. “But here’s what I know: Every voice we hear deserves to be honored and respected.” Lopez closed out the segment. “Back in the Bronx, music gave me a reason to dance, from hip-hop to freestyle, pop, soul and salsa,” she said. “It kept me moving from the block to the big stages and even bigger screens. It reminds me where I come from, but it also reminds me of all the places I can go. Music remains the one place we can all feel truly free.” [See all the looks from the Grammys red carpet.] "
5c62e9ea3a125f5075c09446,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/12/arts/music/review-yuja-wang-igudesman-joo-carnegie-hall.html,"In all seriousness: What can’t Yuja Wang do? This star pianist has built her reputation on breathtaking mastery of the standard repertory, like the chamber works she played last Wednesday with the violinist Leonidas Kavakos at Carnegie Hall. Or Robert Schumann’s Piano Concerto, which she’ll do with the Boston Symphony Orchestra later this week. But in between those two dates, she stopped by Carnegie’s Zankel Hall on Monday for something entirely different: a comedy show. One with music, of course. And, as always, she was radiant in Rachmaninoff and Lutoslawski. But there was — more. She rapped! She sang and danced through a “West Side Story” medley! She did one-legged, upside-down yoga on a piano bench! And along the way, she never lost an ounce of virtuosity. As part of Ms. Wang’s season-long Perspectives series at Carnegie, she was appearing with the musical comedy duo Igudesman & Joo — Aleksey Igudesman, violin, and Hyung-ki Joo, piano — in a program called “The Clone,” an evening-length version of a sketch they posted on YouTube in 2017. Their approach to performance taps into a joy and curiosity often left behind in music school, which is where Mr. Igudesman and Mr. Joo met as youngsters in Britain. What student hasn’t gone off book for the sake of a joke, to parody someone else’s mannerisms or change the key of a well-known piece for comedic effect? The more skilled you are, the better the results. There is no skill lacking in Igudesman & Joo’s act: They have training fit for the concerto circuit, though, in the tradition of P.D.Q. Bach, they have never surrendered the fun of exploiting the comedy in classical music. An entire bit at Zankel consisted of transposing Mozart’s “Rondo alla Turca” from A minor to A major. There’s a bit of subtle music theory education there, but the punch line was in the unexpected change of character brought on by the different key. They then went even further, adding B flats for a tinge of klezmer. Later, they seamlessly blended Gloria Gaynor’s “I Will Survive” with Mozart, early opera and hip-hop. In “The Clone,” however, those moments of playfulness and discovery were buried in jokes that quickly became uncomfortable, even offensive. The sketch’s conceit is a demonstration of all the capabilities of a hypothetical Yuja Wang clone. (Or robot? It’s never really clear.) She arrives in a large box that they say “smells of sweet and sour chicken.” The duo goes on to mock the Chinese language, and when the clone malfunctions, they laugh it off with a shrug: “Made in China!” Even more difficult to take was the implication that these two men had mail-ordered a woman who obeys their every command and casually accepts their frequent remarks about her sexuality. At one point, Mr. Joo turned to the audience and said, “God, she’s so hot.” Among the cheapest jokes was “How do you turn her on?” followed by “I can think of a couple of ways.” And in the opening, when Mr. Joo came out onstage dressed as her, he said, “I know I’m not Yuja Wang, but some girlfriends do call me Huge-a Wang.” It’s a shame. Because when the evening hewed more closely to truly musical comedy, it showed just how funny virtuosity — especially that of the multitalented Ms. Wang — can be. "
5cadf74049f0eacbf1f82559,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/10/arts/music/tayla-parx-ariana-grande-thank-u-next.html,"For 15 weeks since the fall, the top spot on the Billboard singles chart has been occupied by one of two Ariana Grande mega-smashes — “Thank U, Next” and “7 Rings” — that drip with the mettle and coquettish swagger of a pop diva, while borrowing from hip-hop beats and cadences. That winsome formula, though particularly compelling from Grande, can be traced back through recent pop history on a global scale: There are elements of the sound in a K-pop track by the girl group Red Velvet from 2015; a JoJo kiss-off from 2016; a Fifth Harmony single from 2017; and a Grammy-nominated Christina Aguilera number from last year. Even “High Hopes,” the sugary comeback hit from the pop-punk survivors Panic! at the Disco, which peaked at No. 4 in January, shares some of that DNA in its ecstatic vocal runs and melodic precision. The common link comes via the songwriter Taylor Parks, an ebullient 25-year-old former child actress with a brightly dyed bob and an air of benevolent mischief, who was credited on each. Known in the industry as a top-liner, Parks, who performs as Tayla Parx, contributes melodic and lyrical ideas to some of the biggest artists in the world, and those aspiring to be. For the last few years, she has done so quietly, cutting a meticulous yet low-key warpath through popular music on a personal quest to land a No. 1 single on every genre chart — a lofty goal that’s no longer far-fetched. “I only have a few more to go,” Parx said recently, while putting the finishing touches on her own debut album. “I need a country, I need a gospel, and I need a hip-hop.” She tackled Latin pop back in 2016, before its crossover explosion, and Nashville was already in her sights, she teased, after recent interest from Kacey Musgraves and Keith Urban. They are not the only ones to take notice. Parx was credited as a co-writer on half of Grande’s blockbuster “Thank U, Next” album, which rebooted the pop singer’s sound and public narrative. For Parx, the release worked as a springboard from workaday writer to A-list studio presence and, ideally, viable solo artist — an elusive final hurdle for many young female songwriters, from Ester Dean and Jessie J to Julia Michaels and Starrah. “Most songwriters fail to become an artist the same size they were a songwriter,” acknowledged Richie Kipp, one of Parx’s managers. “But I’ve never seen anyone wired like Tayla.” A Texas-born protégée of the actress and choreographer Debbie Allen, Parx moved with her family — a mother who worked in software and a father in mortgage underwriting — to Los Angeles to pursue show business. She played Little Inez Stubbs in the 2007 film adaptation of “Hairspray” before landing a few small television parts, including on Nickelodeon shows where she first crossed paths with Grande. Though they kept in touch intermittently on AOL Instant Messenger — and Parx helped write the title track for Grande’s second album, “My Everything,” in 2014 — the women did not really reconnect in person until the making of “Thank U, Next” late last year. In the meantime, Parx had clocked studio time with Babyface, contributed to a Mariah Carey divorce anthem while still a teenager and become a voice actor on “The Sims” and “The Walking Dead” video games. (Parx’s song “Me vs. Us” has a Simlish version, sung entirely in the fictional language.) Now, with Grande in her corner and on her résumé, Parx is trying to balance studio sessions for hit-seeking artists like Sam Smith, Haim and Dua Lipa with signing artists and producers of her own, going on acting auditions, working on a screenplay for an animated film, conceiving a clothing brand and promoting her Atlantic Records release, “We Need to Talk.” The new album, like Parx’s best hits, is playful and conversational, blending pop, R&B and traces of rap with plenty of Grande-esque high notes. “It’s been nuts,” Parx said. “I really had to jump through all the hoops of fire. First of all, being black, and then being a woman, and then being a young black woman. But we got through all of them.” (A recent study by the University of Southern California Annenberg Inclusion Initiative found that of the 633 songs to chart from 2012 through 2018, just 12.3 percent included female songwriters.) In addition to her contagious pluck and facility across genres, Parx credited her listening skills and discretion as crucial to endearing her to major artists. “There are a lot of things in my vault from the biggest stars in the world,” she said. “I would never betray them or take advantage of that trust.” Her acting background helps, too. “When I write these songs after having conversations with artists,” she said, “I’m embodying that and becoming them in that moment.” Aguilera compared Parx to a little sister, one who introduced her to “Black Mirror” and Instagram stories, while also gamely battling Aguilera’s children with Nerf guns. “She just has this natural personable quality that makes you feel at ease,” Aguilera said. “You want to be in a room with her.” As a former child performer herself, Aguilera said she was thrilled with the recognition now heading Parx’s way after her work with Grande. “I can hear Tayla in those songs, for sure,” Aguilera said, praising Parx’s ability to collaborate with “another young artist and really take them to that next place in their career, where you’re like: ‘Oh, wait, who is this again? Ariana Grande!?’” Parx was brought into the “Thank U, Next” sessions in October by her longtime friends and collaborators Victoria Monét, another top-liner, and the producer Tommy Brown, or TB Hits, who had both worked on Grande’s four previous albums. Grande had just released a full-length, “Sweetener,” that August, but with the death of her ex-boyfriend, the rapper Mac Miller, and the flame out of her high-profile romance with Pete Davidson of “Saturday Night Live,” she had plenty more material to work through. “We were kind of there through the breakup and the makeup and the breakup again,” Parx said, “which is why records like ‘NASA’ and ‘Make Up’ came.” The group wrote about nine songs in a week, six of which ended up making the “Thank U, Next” album. But none were as crucial as the title track, which existed in multiple versions, including the internet-melting one where Grande addressed her exes by name. “They all felt like the one until we got to ‘Thank U, Next,’ and then we were like, ‘This is the one one!’” Parx said. Brown recalled Parx as an advocate for specificity. “She was a big supporter of using the names,” he said, citing her tendency to speak her mind. “All big stars need people who are honest with them,” Brown added. “Too many times these people are lied to or just agreed with. Tayla’s not going to that.” Parx noted that she, Monét and Grande were not only collaborators but also peers and friends. “For me to connect to a young female is a completely different perspective than when you have a Max Martin talking to a young female,” she said, referring to the longtime pop hitmaker. As for the criticism that Grande received about appropriating black music and style, Parx brushed it off, noting that many critics failed to recognize the pop star’s black collaborators. “She’s actually supporting the black producers and writers that she works with more than some of the black artists that I’ve worked with,” Parx said. “I think the free exchange is important for the evolution of music,” she added. “If we didn’t take from each other, genre-wise, everything would sound the same. As long as the proper credit is given, that’s the most important thing.” Parx’s technical skills, like a knack for arranging and producing vocals, also help set her apart. “I might find a breath or a word that I like — it’s like surgery,” she said of the process, which can include coaching singers toward certain emotional registers and chopping up different takes into fine-tuned final versions. As she spoke, Parx was using one ear to track the progress of her own vocals on a song that needed to be finished for her album. In the editing process, a line that should have been “teach me” had morphed into “tease me.” “It sounds like I have a lisp,” she told her audio engineer, barely missing a beat in conversation. Seeming genuinely sated by all of the success coming her way, Parx was typically buoyant about the possibility that “We Need to Talk” may not be her own commercial breakthrough, but merely another baby step in an atypical career. “That would be very ungrateful of me to look at the records that I’ve broken, the career that I’ve had from 9 until now, and measure my success against someone else’s,” she said, flashing her disarmingly confident grin. “There’s a lot of things that the biggest artists in the world haven’t done that I’ve done.” "

Messages of inspiration and hope prevailed at a colorful and uplifting Grammy Awards on Sunday, defying expectations that the event would be drab. The stars also all but steered clear of any political messages. The host, Alicia Keys, set the positive tone by telling personal stories and speaking often of peace and love. And she lead the event with an all-star moment of female solidarity, which included a surprise appearance by Michelle Obama, who said that music “has always helped me tell my story,” and “allows us to hear one another, to invite each other in.” [Here’s the full list of Grammys winners.] Obama wasn’t the only unexpected attendee with a message of empowerment. Drake, one of the most nominated artists this year, with seven nods and one win, showed up to accept the award for best rap song for his smash “God’s Plan.” Drake, who has skipped the Grammys in recent years and turned down an offer to perform at this year’s show, used his time on stage to speak to other artists and to children who aspire to music fame. His message: That awards like the Grammys are not a measure of success in the music industry. “We’re playing in an opinion-based sport, not a factual-based sport,” he said, explaining that music is a business where powerful people who don’t necessarily understand artists’ experiences are often making the decisions. “The point is you’ve already won if you have people who are singing your songs word for word, if you’re a hero in your hometown, if — look, look — if there’s people who have regular jobs who are coming out in the rain, in the snow, spending their hard-earned money to buy tickets to come to your shows, you don’t need this right here, I promise you that, you already won,” he said, holding up his Grammy. Not long after, Diana Ross, in a flowing red gown, celebrated her upcoming 75th birthday with two hits from her solo career: “The Best Years of My Life” and “Reach Out and Touch (Somebody’s Hand).” She punctuated her performance by speaking to the crowd. “So much love in this room,” she said. “Together we have no limits. There’s only success ahead and you can lead the way. Learn, dream, unlock new doors. All is possible.” Earlier in the night, Lady Gaga accepted an award for “Shallow” from “A Star Is Born” and said she was proud to be part of a movie that addresses mental health issues. “A lot of artists deal with that, and we’ve got to take care of each other,” she said, adding, “So if you see somebody that hurting, don’t look away.” And Dua Lipa, winner for best new artist, clapped back at Neil Portnow, the chief executive of the Recording Academy, who said last year that women in music should “step up” to advance their careers. “I guess this year we really stepped up,” Lipa said, accepting her award, referring to the strong showing by women this year. “For anyone that hasn’t realized how special they are to have a different story, a different background, a name that honors their roots because they just want to be normal, whatever the hell that means,” she went on, adding, “never let that get in the way of you and your dreams, because you deserve it.” "

This Nigeria-born, British-bred rapper makes her way to Brooklyn this weekend to perform hard-charging songs that draw together elements of grime, trap and techno. An energetic M.C., Flohio — whose given name is Funmi Ohiosuma — floods her music with a brashness that she attributes to her South London upbringing. Ohiosuma recently told The Guardian, “Rap isn’t meant to be too happy; there’s meant to be grit in there.” That attitude guides her recent EP, “Wild Yout,” on which she touts her authenticity and taunts her detractors. Released in November, it was the culminating effort of her breakout year. 718-599-5800, babysallright.com JOSÉ GONZÁLEZ at the Apollo Theater (March 21-22, 8 p.m.). In his solo work, this Swedish-Argentinian songwriter is a practiced minimalist, painting pictures with just his fingerpicked guitar and soft vocals. But González transforms in the company of collaborators. His sound expands whether he’s recording with the folk-rock group Junip or touring with the String Theory, an experimental orchestra from Berlin and Gothenburg with whom he released a live album last month. The String Theory will join him for his two-night run at the Apollo, performing new arrangements of songs from González’s three solo albums. 212-531-5305, apollotheater.org [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] KAIA KATER AND KARINE POLWART at Carnegie Hall (March 23, 9 p.m.). This double bill showcases a range of folk traditions, embraced by two distinctly contemporary artists. For Quebec-born Kater, the Canadian folk songs of her childhood and the Appalachian music she studied while attending college in West Virginia serve as touchstones; Polwart, meanwhile, draws from the musical heritage of her native Scotland. The noted political dimension in the songwriting of both women makes this a natural pairing: Kater has sung about the Black Lives Matter movement and political strife in her father’s home country of Grenada, and Polwart’s 2018 album, “Laws of Motion,” addresses Trumpism and the experiences of migrants. 212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org TORRES at Le Poisson Rouge (March 22, 8 p.m.). In the six years since she released her debut album, the Brooklyn-based singer Mackenzie Scott (a.k.a. Torres) has made the journey from quiet, confessional songwriter to adventurous, often boisterous rocker. On her most recent album, 2017’s “Three Futures,” Scott textured her guitar work with industrial and electronic sounds, aiming to create something that engaged all five senses. For her show at this Manhattan multimedia club, expect sensory engagement, beginning with her ritual preshow burning of palo santo sticks. Annie Hart, of the trio Au Revoir Simone, will open, setting the stage with lush, synth-driven pop songs. lpr.comOLIVIA HORN ALTERNATIVE GUITAR SUMMIT at various locations (March 21, 25 and 27-28, 7:30 p.m.). Organized by the guitarist Joel Harrison, the annual Alternative Guitar Summit gathers some of the most talented six-string improvisers in jazz, post-rock and world music. This year’s festival begins on Thursday with a 50th-anniversary celebration of the music of Woodstock, at Le Poisson Rouge in Greenwich Village. Harrison will play music from the Richie Havens and the Grateful Dead songbooks alongside the Everett Bradley Choir. The guitarist Ben Monder and the vocalist Jo Lawry will collaborate on music by John Sebastian and the Band. And the guitarist Nels Cline, who’s best known for his work in Wilco, will revisit Santana’s iconic Woodstock performance. The summit’s second concert takes place on Monday, when Cline, Leni Stern and others will pay tribute to the esteemed guitarist (and multi-instrumentalist) Ralph Towner at Drom, in the East Village. It concludes on Wednesday and Thursday at Jazz Standard with solo shows from Towner himself. (On the last two nights, there will be second sets at 9:30 p.m.) alternativeguitarsummit.com AARON DIEHL TRIO at the Baruch Performing Arts Center (March 28, 8 p.m.). Diehl’s piano playing has the same courtly, dapper flare as his wardrobe (he’s usually attired in a crisp, dark suit, sometimes topped off with a pair of thick-framed glasses). Picking up the mantle of midcentury greats like Bud Powell, Barry Harris and Cedar Walton, he espouses the ideal of jazz as America’s classical music, whether he’s performing standards or his own neo-traditionalist compositions. He may be best known for his work alongside Cécile McLorin Salvant, an eminent young vocalist, but at Baruch the spotlight will fall squarely on Diehl and his trio, which features the bassist David Wong and the drummer Aaron Kimmel. They will be playing music from his most recent album, “Space, Time, Continuum,” as well as some new pieces.212-352-3101, baruch.cuny.edu/bpac FIRE! AND MADALYN MERKEY at the Clemente Soto Vélez Cultural Center (March 28, 8 p.m.). The tenor saxophonist Mats Gustafsson, one of Europe’s most uncompromising free improvisers, angles toward the void in Fire!, a trio that includes the bassist Johan Berthling and the drummer Andreas Werliin. Whether scrawling an illegible smear of notes across the top of a pounding beat or erupting in fury as the rhythm dissolves beneath him, Gustafsson keeps the intensity high and your ears alight — even when his tone skews murky and dark. Fire! shares the bill here with Merkey, whose semi-ambient electronic music guides listeners into a kind of dreamlike state. This concert — Fire!’s first ever in New York — is presented by the nonprofit organization Blank Forms.blankforms.org DEREK GRIPPER at Roulette (March 23, 8 p.m.). Gripper, a South African guitarist, has developed a virtuoso approach to playing Malian music that was originally composed for instruments such as the kora (a 21-string instrument, somewhere between a harp and a guitar) and the ngoni (a possible progenitor of the banjo). He fingerpicks his classical guitar in percussive swirls, producing a sound that’s as enlivening as it is hypnotic. His repertoire includes music by the kora master Toumani Diabaté and the guitarist Ali Farka Touré, as well as folk songs from South Africa’s Western Cape. This concert kicks off the fifth annual A World in Trance festival, which spotlights music from around the world with explicitly spiritual overtones.917-267-0368, roulette.org MANUEL VALERA AND THE NEW CUBAN EXPRESS BIG BAND at Terraza 7 (March 28, 9 p.m.). Valera, a Cuban-born pianist with a blazingly fluent right hand and a mellifluous compositional style, has long led the New Cuban Express, a midsize band that integrates elements of contemporary New York jazz with Afro-Cuban forms. On Thursday he will premiere a big-band iteration of the ensemble, featuring the vocalist Sofía Rei and the alto saxophonist Román Filiú, plus 16 other instrumentalists.347-808-0518, terraza7.com WEBBER/MORRIS BIG BAND at the Jazz Gallery (March 22, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). The tenor saxophonist and flutist Anna Webber recently put out “Clockwise,” an album full of atonality and friction and discomfited momentum — not to mention, some of New York’s premier improvising musicians. Angela Morris, a fellow saxophonist, shares some of Webber’s style, while also drawing more heavily on the influence of Impressionist composers and jazz’s most ancient styles. They have been playing their ambitious original compositions in this big band for a few years, and supposedly there’s an album on the way — but so far all we have to show for it are a few YouTube clips and a bit of buzz on the scene. To really hear the Webber/Morris Big Band, you’ve got to go in person.646-494-3625, jazzgallery.nyc GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO "
5c92753e49f0eacbf105e1b8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/20/arts/music/christian-scott-atunde-adjuah-ancestral-recall-review.html,"Back in the 2000s, before social media’s impact had played out, when it wasn’t yet obligatory for artists to turn their work into a political statement, the trumpeter Christian Scott aTunde Adjuah was already using music to envision change. He rarely used vocals, but Mr. Scott wrote directly from his experiences growing up in the Upper Ninth Ward of New Orleans, and from his investigations into the history of race in America. His music combined musical legacies and pushed well beyond the standard approaches to contemporary jazz; on songs like “K.K.P.D.” and “Dred Scott,” he was projecting something like a new vision for American society. So “Ancestral Recall,” Mr. Scott’s bold new album, is only one link in a long chain of ambitious, broad-minded work. And while it may not be his most immediately affecting album (that remains “Yesterday You Said Tomorrow,” from 2010), it offers the kind of slow-burning immersion that most of his recent records have only gestured at. His main goal when making “Ancestral Recall” was to remind listeners that musical traditions centered on rhythm (African and Native American traditions in particular) have as much nuance and complexity as those built primarily around harmony (read: European). Across the album, Mr. Scott lets rhythms from West Africa and the Caribbean and New Orleans — from the pre-Columbian era, the 19th century and today — lace in and out of one another. At key moments, the poet Saul Williams interjects with lines of imagistic poetry, wandering from speech to rap to song in a style similar to that of Yasiin Bey (formerly Mos Def). On the title track, he intones: Up from the water I was drowned.The bullet exits the body.The organs seal themselves.The planes appear out of fire.The people are praying right there where we left them. While he is saying this, Mr. Scott surrounds him in beaming trumpet lines — declarative though unresolved — as if heralding the arrival of a new regime. There have been two major stages of Mr. Scott’s career — among the most high profile in jazz today. From 2007 to ’12, he released three studio records that wriggled smartly away from genre concerns. Thanks in part to their drummers, Marcus Gilmore and Jamire Williams — each of whom had his own way of reconstituting the influence of Tony Williams — the songs on “Anthem,” “Yesterday You Said Tomorrow” and “Christian aTunde Adjuah” tumbled into your ear with the writhing, essential force of a feeling, or a mass of people on the move. Since 2015 he has placed a new emphasis on patterned, polyrhythmic drumming, using a tightened-up approach and more explicitly melding the sounds of modern hip-hop with ancient, diasporic rhythms. His output of the past five-plus years have been defined by Mr. Scott’s interplay with the flute of Elena Pinderhughes and the latticework drumming of Corey Fonville — both of whom first joined the band on 2015’s “Stretch Music” (a highlight), and who appear on “Ancestral Recall” — as much as by its conceptual aspirations. The new album unifies the winning elements of Mr. Scott’s past work: the historical syncretism, the tensile band energy, the powerful physicality. The first track, “Her Arrival,” begins with a group of percussionists playing hand drums and a babble of voices rising up. It sounds like a street scene, and it’s an early indication that this will be music of embodiment. You can nearly walk around inside it. Midway through the album, on the graceful “Overcomer,” a slapping drumbeat disappears early in the track and a pastel silence takes over; then a mist of harmonizing voices comes in, with a cajón, an Afro-South American percussion instrument, being pounded below. When Mr. Scott takes a solo, his trumpet starts at a whisper and grows more distorted. Soon he’s alternating between spinning thick twirls of blues, à la Louis Armstrong, and pelting spears like Hugh Masekela. Mr. Scott is not a collegiate-sounding trumpet player, and he plays with as much deference to New Orleanian and continental African traditions as to bebop. As a result, he plays fewer notes than most jazz trumpeters today, and his projection is more immediately majestic. He is following a path of his own, and so far, it’s still breaking new ground. "
5ca4f79849f0eacbf1f80a6f,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/03/arts/music/khalid-free-spirit-review.html,"With his 2017 debut, “American Teen,” Khalid (whose last name is Robinson) arrived as a teenager from El Paso, speaking for fellow teens, with a peer group of “young dumb broke high school kids” — a little proud, a little humble and mostly just dazedly matter-of-fact. With his long-breathed croon floating over unassuming low-fi production, he sang about circumscribed but smartphone-connected lives, misfiring romances and looming life choices. The immediacy of his melodies, the Everyteen sensibility of his lyrics and the direct yearning in his voice quickly found a wide audience. More than a billion streams, five Grammy nominations (though no wins) and a 2018 EP (“Suncity”) later, Khalid’s second full-length album, “Free Spirit,” grapples with a more singular, more isolated experience: coming to terms with fame, wealth, broader horizons and lingering insecurity. “Is this heaven or Armageddon?” he wonders in “Free Spirit.” He has moved from “we” to “I.” The music cushions his unease. It’s a generous album — 17 songs — that rolls along smoothly for nearly an hour, one leisurely midtempo groove after another, while Khalid’s voice conveys far more longing than agitation. He has upper-echelon producers now (among them John Hill, Digi, Charlie Handsome and Hit-Boy), and he’s separating himself from the twitchy, narrow-band approach of the SoundCloud rap crowd. He’s also learning from R&B’s more distant past. On the new album, Khalid embraces a fuller sound that often harks back to the 1980s and 1990s, with pillowy synthesizers, tickling guitars and multiple layers of his own vocal harmonies. In “Self,” Khalid strives to balance self-doubt — “The man that I’ve been running from is inside of me” — and self-preservation; the track, produced by Hit-Boy, lurches forward on a boom-bap beat and surrounds Khalid with glimmering keyboards and echoey vocals. In “Twenty One” — his current age — Khalid woos someone while he confesses his own turmoil: “I’m in pain/But I’m to blame/To end this fight/I have to change.” Yet there are handclaps, pop-rock guitars and layered vocals to bolster him and make sure he gets through. Success hasn’t made Khalid sleazy or arrogant. He doesn’t take partners for granted; he also understands the pop potential of respectful flirting. “Talk,” produced and co-written by the English duo Disclosure, is a male analogue of Janet Jackson’s “Let’s Wait Awhile,” telling an eager partner that slowing things down a little will bring them closer. “Can’t we just talk/figure out where we’re going,” Khalid requests, ever so politely, as syncopated synthesizers tick and blip around him. “Better,” which includes production by the Norwegian duo Stargate, celebrates the sensual bliss of a secret affair: “Just hold me in the dark/No one’s gotta know what we do,” he urges, amid floating piano chords and a swirl of his own naturalistic and sampled vocals. “Nothing feels better than this,” he exults. But Khalid can’t stay cocooned in romance. For much of the album, he’s out on his own, coping with internal anxieties and external pressures. On “American Teen” he had high school classmates who shared his fun and frustrations; on “Free Spirit,” they’ve been replaced by business associates with their own motives. “Bad Luck” glides along on gently ticking drums and a lacework of guitars, distantly suggesting Marvin Gaye’s “Sexual Healing,” yet it’s anything but reassuring. All Khalid sees around him is shallowness and duplicity: “No one really means it when they’re wishing you well/I got no one to call, no one/and people only love you when they’re needing your wealth,” he sings in a sweet, sad falsetto. And in “Hundred,” he marches through countless obligations and glances at the dubious “friends” who surround him: “Everybody wants a favor, everybody needs me/But I’m too busy trying to fight away all of my demons.” He doesn’t conquer those demons on “Free Spirit”; nor does he succumb to them. Instead, he suspends them in melody and rhythm, recognizing them and staring them down. He doesn’t pretend to be a hero or an antihero — just a young man alone, trying to get through life with some honest grace. "
5c71a2dd3a125f5075c0b328,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/23/arts/r-kelly-bond.html,"CHICAGO — One was a teenage fan who sought R. Kelly’s autograph during his 2008 child pornography trial. Another was his 24-year-old hairdresser. According to documents released by prosecutors on Saturday, Mr. Kelly grabbed her by the head, tried to force her to perform oral sex and then ejaculated on her, leaving his DNA. A third victim, prosecutors said, was a girl Mr. Kelly met at a restaurant during her 16th birthday celebration. Her mother was concerned about Mr. Kelly’s interest, so he helped her navigate around her parents. According to prosecutors, he instructed the girl to take a cab to his studio after her father had dropped her at school. There, he gave her an envelope with “a large sum of money” and they began a once-a-month sexual relationship that lasted for about a year. In revealing details of their case at a bond hearing in Chicago on Saturday, prosecutors portrayed Mr. Kelly as a man who repeatedly used his fame to draw girls and women into his orbit, and then turned them into targets for his sexual gratification. After surrendering Friday to face 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse involving four women, three of whom were minors at the time, Mr. Kelly, 52, was ordered held on Saturday on a $1 million bond. He did not make bail on Saturday, and “it looks like he will be at the jail for the night,” according to a spokeswoman from the Cook County Sheriff’s Office. He also had to surrender his passport and was told not to have contact with any of the alleged victims or anyone under the age of 18. “We’re happy to turn in his passport,” said Mr. Kelly’s lawyer, Steven Greenberg. Alluding to the song that made Mr. Kelly a superstar, “I Believe I Can Fly,” the lawyer added, “Contrary to the song, Mr. Kelly doesn’t like to fly.” Mr. Kelly, whose full name is Robert Kelly, did not enter a plea, though his lawyer has claimed that the women testifying against him are liars. On Saturday, Mr. Kelly stood at the front of a packed courtroom in a black hooded sweatshirt and athletic pants, holding his hands behind his back, before he was led away. Mr. Kelly has been through the court system before, in a highly publicized child pornography trial that stemmed from a video that prosecutors said showed him having sex with, and urinating on, an underage girl. Several witnesses identified her, but the girl refused to testify and Mr. Kelly’s lawyers argued that her identity could not be known for certain. He was acquitted on all counts. Kim Foxx, the Cook County state’s attorney, said on Saturday that one of the four women in the new cases is that same girl. There is no indication she has changed her mind about testifying, but the documents released on Saturday say that prosecutors have a new videotape showing the girl having sex with Mr. Kelly and making reference to being 14 years old. The tape, about two decades old, came from someone who had once been in contact with Mr. Kelly. That person recently gave the tape to Michael Avenatti, the celebrity lawyer, who turned it over to prosecutors in Ms. Foxx’s office. According to Mr. Avenatti, the acts depicted in the tape were different from those at the center of the 2008 case, eliminating any issue of double jeopardy. The girl who sought Mr. Kelly’s autograph during his 2008 trial, identified in the court papers as J.P., matches the description of a woman, Jerhonda Pace, who first told her story publicly in a 2017 BuzzFeed article by the music journalist Jim DeRogatis, who has been chronicling accusations against Mr. Kelly for nearly 20 years. According to the documents, they began a sexual relationship several months after she had sought his autograph. They had sex multiple times over the course of nine months, when she was 16, the documents allege. She told BuzzFeed that she left Mr. Kelly after he slapped and choked her during an argument. She had saved a shirt that Mr. Kelly had ejaculated on, according to the documents, and turned it over to the authorities. Mr. Kelly has been accused several times in the past of sexually abusing underage girls, but he reached settlements with nondisclosure agreements that for many years served as a protective shield. Ms. Pace broke her nondisclosure agreement, according to BuzzFeed, and her account, along with another article describing how Mr. Kelly kept women in an apparent sex cult, was the beginning of a fresh round of coverage and public outrage. Many of the allegations were chronicled last month in a six-part Lifetime documentary, “Surviving R. Kelly,” which emboldened Chicago prosecutors to try to build another case against him. Ms. Pace was in the courtroom on Saturday. The day before, after the charges were announced, she made a statement on Twitter: “To everyone that called us liars and shamed us, keep that same energy. R. Kelly is going down, DOWN.” Also in the courtroom, looking on from the row reserved for Mr. Kelly’s family and friends, were two women, Joycelyn Savage and Azriel Clary, whose presence served as a strong statement from Mr. Kelly. Their families have said the women are being held captive by Mr. Kelly, but his lawyer has said they are living with him willingly, and local authorities who have conducted checks at the parents’ behest have not found anything illegal with the living arrangement. Ms. Clary’s parents were also in the courtroom on Saturday. Their daughter did not acknowledge them. Another alleged victim, identified in court documents as H.W., met a 32-year-old Mr. Kelly at a restaurant in 1998 while she was celebrating her 16th birthday. Prosecutors say Mr. Kelly’s manager gave her the singer’s business card with his personal phone number written on it and told her to call him. Her mother, who heard the exchange, took the card away and told Mr. Kelly’s manager that her daughter was only 16. H.W. later removed the card from her mother’s purse and called him. Mr. Kelly told the girl that she should take a cab to his studio after her father dropped her off at school. There, at his studio on North Larrabee Street, they had intercourse and she performed oral sex on him, according to the documents. They had sex about once a month for a year. The fourth woman in the new cases, identified as L.C., was the only one who was an adult at the time of the alleged crime. She was Mr. Kelly’s 24-year-old hairdresser in 2003 when he entered the room with his pants down, according to the documents. He grabbed her head and tried to force her to perform oral sex. She resisted, prosecutors said, but he masturbated, and then ejaculated on her and repeatedly spit in her face. L.C. reported the event to law enforcement officials and gave them the shirt she had been wearing that day; DNA testing found Mr. Kelly’s semen on the shirt. It was not immediately clear on Saturday why that case was not prosecuted when it was first reported. Mr. Greenberg, the singer’s lawyer, said that may have been a consensual encounter. The DNA will be a new piece of evidence that prosecutors did not have in Mr. Kelly’s first trial. The culture around sexual misconduct is new, too, in the wake of the #MeToo movement and the continued fallout from abuse by Catholic priests. Amid a ferocious outcry, Mr. Kelly’s record label, RCA, a division of Sony Music Entertainment, dropped him two weeks after the documentary aired. Along with the Chicago prosecutors, their counterparts in Atlanta, where Mr. Kelly also has lived, began looking into his conduct; federal investigators in New York are also gathering evidence, though the scope of their inquiry is not clear and Mr. Kelly has not been charged outside Illinois. “I am cautiously optimistic,” said Kenyette Tisha Barnes, co-founder of the #MuteRKelly social media campaign. “The difference between this indictment and the last indictment is that you didn’t have the degree of public pressure to get him convicted in 2008. It was actually the opposite — more people wanted him acquitted.” "
5c9c007549f0eacbf105f6b2,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/27/obituaries/ranking-roger-dead.html,"Ranking Roger, a vocalist for the popular British ska band the Beat in the late 1970s and early ’80s who carried on that group’s infectious sound in subsequent bands and solo projects, died on Tuesday in Birmingham, England. He was 56. An announcement on his current group’s website said he had received a cancer diagnosis last year. Ranking Roger, whose real name was Roger Charlery, was one of two frontmen for the Beat, along with Dave Wakeling. The group, which was known as the English Beat in the United States to avoid confusion with a California power-pop band of the same name, had a brief but influential run after its founding in 1978, expanding on the ska sound, a lively precursor to reggae that had first migrated to England from Jamaica in the 1960s. “Ska is their base,” The Boston Globe wrote of the Beat in 1981, “but it’s infused with satisfying pressure-cooker-like tension and cut with reggae, pop and soul elements.” Neil Strauss, looking back on the group’s heyday in a 1995 article in The New York Times, described the Beat’s sound as “Jamaican ska informed by punk rock.” Mr. Charlery, who was black, and Mr. Wakeling, who is white, complemented each other: Mr. Wakeling was a more traditional vocalist, while Mr. Charlery “toasted,” the Jamaican version of rapping. The Beat’s best-known songs include a jaunty 1979 cover of “The Tears of a Clown,” which had been a hit for Smokey Robinson and the Miracles, and “Mirror in the Bathroom,” their biggest hit, which reached No. 4 in Britain in 1980. Some of the Beat’s songs had a political edge, notably “Stand Down Margaret,” a critique of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and her Conservative Party policies. “I said I see no joy, I see only sorrow,” the two vocalists sang. “I see no chance of your bright new tomorrow. So stand down Margaret.” But in a 1988 interview with The Globe (Mrs. Thatcher was still prime minister, and would remain in office until 1990), Mr. Charlery expressed some disillusionment about the power of music. “I sang ‘Stand Down Margaret’ for five years and no one listened,” he said. “She got in, and she got in again, and she’ll probably get in again. It goes to show how blind people are. Basically, I don’t think people ever listen.” After the Beat broke up in 1983, Mr. Charlery and Mr. Wakeling formed a new group, General Public. It broke up three years later, but the two men got back together for some shows in 1995. “Goodbye, Rog,” Mr. Wakeling posted on Facebook. “Thanks for all the fabulous years and wonderful memories.” Mr. Charlery was born on Feb. 21, 1963, in Birmingham to Jean Baptiste and Anne Marie Charlery, who were from St. Lucia in the Caribbean. He grew up in Birmingham and nearby Stechford and attended Tile Cross Academy. “My parents expected me to go into a factory,” he told The Birmingham Mail in 2016, when he released a new album, “Bounce,” as the Beat Featuring Ranking Roger. “I didn’t see that. I wanted to be a mechanic or a carpenter if anything.” His parents were destined to be disappointed. “Mum, Anne Marie, cried when I was on ‘Top of the Pops,’ ” he said, referring to the British television show, “and I knew I had done something right.” The Beat was born in part out of frustration with the conservative turn in England’s politics. “To the English Beat,” Robert Palmer wrote in reviewing the group’s second album, “Wha’ppen?,” in The Times, “unemployment, ecology and the antinuclear movement are not separate issues; they are interrelated.” “Anyone who would like to understand more about the attitudes underlying Britain’s inner-city rioting,” he added, “would do well to start here.” Mr. Charlery’s survivors include his partner, Pauline; five children, Matthew, Leon, Reuben, Luci and Saffren; and four sisters. In later years Mr. Charlery recorded and performed on his own and with variously named groups, among them Special Beat. (Mr. Wakeling had his own Beat-related group.) His most recent album, “Public Confidential,” again as the Beat Featuring Ranking Roger, was released this year. Another incarnation, in 2007, was the New English Beat, which included Ranking Junior, his son. In an interview with The Bristol Post of England that year, Mr. Charlery spoke of why he thought his music seemed to have a cross-generational, cross-racial appeal. “When the Beat were originally going ’round,” he said, “our audiences were so mixed — black, white and Indian, young people and older heads. It was brilliant, and I think we have kind of achieved that today. It is a bit different, obviously, but it is a very friendly crowd and everyone walks out sweating and happy, and I tell myself that’s the most I could ask for.” "

EL GRAN COMBO AND LA SONORA PONCEÑA at Radio City Music Hall (Feb. 16, 8 p.m.). That two of the world’s most enduring and renowned salsa bands are booked at a theater with permanent seats is a bit of a head scratcher, but few performance spaces are large enough to accommodate the legions of fans both El Gran Combo and La Sonora Ponceña have accrued during their decades of performance. Both bands hail from Puerto Rico; the former was founded in 1962 by Rafael Ithier, who still leads it today, while the latter was established in 1954 — eight years after its current leader, Enrique Lucca Jr., was born. Expect plenty of dancing in the aisles. 212-465-6225, radiocity.com INTERPOL at Madison Square Garden (Feb. 16, 8 p.m.). This show is a homecoming for these indie stalwarts, who met at N.Y.U. and started making dark, stripped-down rock music in the late 1990s. Fifteen years after their breakthrough album “Antics” and on the heels of their 2018 release “Marauder,” Interpol is back at the Garden with a remarkable opening lineup that provides a good snapshot of alternative rock music today. You’ll want to get to the arena early to catch Snail Mail, the name under which the buzzy singer-songwriter Lindsey Jordan performs, and the breezy indie favorites Car Seat Headrest. 212-465-6741, msg.com METRIC AND ZOÉ at Kings Theater (Feb. 18, 7 p.m.). The brash, synth-driven, dance-inspired rock of Toronto’s Metric has remained relatively constant over the 16 years since the band’s first studio album, “Old World Underground, Where Are You Now?” — the zeitgeist, though, has shifted dramatically. When they came onto the scene, Metric was surrounded by like-minded alternative rockers such as TV on the Radio and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. But even as Metric’s music veers from the trend, they appear indefatigable; 2018’s “Art of Doubt” is a testament to their artistic vitality. The Mexican rock band Zoé, who have shown similar endurance over their nearly two decades at the forefront of their genre, co-headline this Brooklyn show. 718-856-5464, kingstheatre.com BOB MOULD BAND at Brooklyn Steel (Feb. 21, 8 p.m.). As the frontman for the bands Hüsker Dü and Sugar, this singer and guitarist found his niche with cathartic yet approachable rock jams. Hüsker Dü, who were active through most of the 1980s, have attained considerable retroactive renown for the way their blend of punk and alternative rock anticipated grunge. Their niche acclaim stands in stark contrast with Sugar, Mould’s band in the early 1990s, which had a brighter sound and hits on Billboard’s alternative charts. His latest release, “Sunshine Rock,” is almost like a blend of these two styles, combining the fierceness of Hüsker Dü with the optimism of Sugar. 888-929-7849, bowerypresents.com PANDA BEAR at Pioneer Works (Feb. 14-15, 7 p.m.). Animal Collective’s co-founder Noah Lennox has released six solo albums under this zoological alias, stretching out the band’s signature experimental, reverb-heavy dance music to include even more unexpected sounds and forms. Lennox’s most recent album, “Buoys,” eschews some of those ornate layers of synths and chaotic postproduction effects that have made his work so psychedelic and instead embraces straightforward songs that put his own, relatively unobscured voice front and center. Where his last album, “Panda Bear Meets the Grim Reaper,” had a harder edge, “Buoys” features gentle, acoustic songs that still have some unconventional filigree. 718-596-3001, pioneerworks.org [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] THE ’70S SOUL JAM VALENTINE’S CONCERT at the Beacon Theater (Feb. 16, 3 and 8 p.m.). It’s hard to think of a genre more explicitly associated with romance than the R&B and soul of the 1970s, with the lush arrangements and seductively slow tempos. Fittingly, some of the artists behind the era’s date-night-appropriate hits will gather for two Valentine’s Day-themed shows on the Upper West Side. Featured artists include the Philadelphia-based soul groups the Stylistics (“You Are Everything”), the Delfonics (“La-La Means I Love You”) and Blue Magic (“Sideshow”); the funk-inflected band Bloodstone (“Natural High”); and the quiet storm pioneers the Manhattans (“Kiss and Say Goodbye”). 212-465-6085, beacontheatre.com VINCE STAPLES at the Hammerstein Ballroom (Feb. 21, 8 p.m.). At 25 years old, this rapper from Long Beach, Calif., has made three critically acclaimed albums that flirt with rap’s avant-garde while retaining mainstream credibility. His music and his public persona — the sardonic Twitter star who wears his gang affiliation (Crips) and his Sprite endorsement on his sleeve with equal aplomb — suggest that this praise has not skewed his lucidity regarding the streets he grew up on and still uses as source material. His latest release, “FM!,” is a concise 22 minutes of songs that are as fun to listen to as they are thought-provoking. 212-279-7740, mc34.comNATALIE WEINER ETHNIC HERITAGE ENSEMBLE at Nublu 151 (Feb. 21, 8 p.m.). A master percussionist and eminence of Chicago’s creative music scene, Kahil El’Zabar channels a deep sense of history into his music, coming away with something timeless and universal and enchanted. For over 40 years, he has led the Ethnic Heritage Ensemble, usually as a trio featuring a rotating cast of horn players and flutists. But he recently expanded it into a quartet, with Alex Harding on baritone saxophone, Corey Wilkes on trumpet and Ian Maksin on cello. At Nublu the band celebrates the release of “Be Heard,” which will be out in March on the audiophile Spiritmuse Records.nublu.net MORGAN GUERIN QUINTET at the Jazz Gallery (Feb. 15-16, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). Though still in his early 20s, Guerin has already started to accrue a reputation as a jaw-dropping musical polymath. On Friday, he will play drums and bass in a quintet performing new, original music; on Saturday, he will again perform his own tunes with a five-piece band, but this time he will be on a saxophone, an electronic wind instrument and a synthesizer. If the music is anything like his two releases thus far (“The Saga” and “The Saga II”), it will be a broadly sourced form of contemporary electric fusion, centered on luminous, morphing textures and elegantly lyrical songwriting.646-494-3625, jazzgallery.nyc KIRK KNUFFKE TRIO at Zinc Bar (Feb. 20, 7:30 and 9 p.m.). A cornetist, Knuffke has a strong sense of his instrument’s history and expressive range, but his playing seems always tinged with a playful optimism. He has been one of the most compelling sidemen on the New York scene for at least a decade now, and more recently he’s been quietly releasing a series of fascinating albums of his own. The most recent, “Witness,” found Knuffke teaming up with the operatic baritone Steven Herring, plus two fellow jazz improvisers. It was unlike any other album in recent memory — and at times utterly transporting. Here Knuffke appears in a trio featuring the bass guitarist Stomu Takeishi and the drummer Bill Goodwin.212-477-9462, zincjazz.com JOE LOVANO, DAVE LIEBMAN AND GREG OSBY at Birdland (Feb. 19-23, 8:30 and 11 p.m.). Three of the best saxophonists in straight-ahead jazz and its affiliated territories, Lovano (tenor saxophone), Liebman (soprano) and Osby (alto) join up this week with a trio of all-star side musicians: the pianist Phil Markowitz, the bassist Cecil McBee and the drummer Billy Hart. All six of these players have been among jazz’s most respected figures since at least the 1980s, and all continue to barrel forward creatively.212-581-3080, birdlandjazz.com DIANNE REEVES at the Rose Theater (Feb. 15-16, 8 p.m.). For the eighth year in a row, Reeves will headline Jazz at Lincoln Center’s main stage during Valentine’s Day weekend. She became a National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master last year, adding a punctuation mark to a career already known to be one of the most distinguished in jazz. Her voice has the power and clarity of Sarah Vaughan’s, and her repertoire only continues to expand: Her most recent album, “Beautiful Life,” from 2014, which won a Grammy, included riveting, personalized renditions of tunes by Fleetwood Mac, Bob Marley and Esperanza Spalding, as well as some Reeves originals.212-721-6500, jazz.org DAYNA STEPHENS QUARTET at the Village Vanguard (Feb. 19-24, 8:30 and 10:30 p.m.). A tenor saxophonist of svelte articulation and beaming tone, Stephens plays contemporary jazz with an emphasis on emotive clarity. His improvisations hold your attention thanks to careful, smart pacing, and Stephens’s willingness to sprinkle moments of simple beauty into his counterintuitive flights. This week is the 40-year-old saxophonist’s debut as a bandleader at the Village Vanguard, where he’s joined by Aaron Parks on piano, Ben Street on bass and Gregory Hutchinson on drums.212-255-4037, villagevanguard.comGIOVANNI RUSSONELLO "

The owner, MaryAnn Rolle, 55, was featured in the Netflix documentary “Fyre: The Greatest Party That Never Happened,” one of two documentaries released this month that chronicle the 2017 music festival disaster, which left attendees stranded without food or drinking water and sleeping on beaches in makeshift tents. The other new film is Hulu’s “Fyre Fraud,” which also takes a critical look at the festival and its organizers. Well-heeled festivalgoers were cheated out of tickets costing hundreds or thousands of dollars, and local islanders were not paid for their services in building the infrastructure for the festival on Great Exuma in the Bahamas. In the Netflix documentary, Ms. Rolle explains that she spent $50,000 of her savings and received no compensation from festival organizers. In May 2017, she told The New York Times that she was owed $134,000 by festival organizers. She said her credit had been ruined. [Read our article from 2017 taking stock of the wreckage of the Fyre Festival.] Ms. Rolle catered 1,000 meals per day from her Exuma Point Beach Bar and Grill in April 2017, delivering food to Coco Plum Beach and Rokers Point, where the festival’s main events were scheduled to take place, according to the GoFundMe campaign, which Ms. Rolle and her husband started. Festival organizers visited her restaurant and stayed at the Exuma Point Beach Resort. “Lots of people I know weren’t paid,” Ms. Rolle said in an interview on Tuesday. After the festival, she added, “we couldn’t find the organizers. No one answered their phones. Nothing was done for us, not until now.” The festival was scheduled for two weekends starting in late April 2017 and was promoted by the rapper Ja Rule. It was hyped by some of Instagram’s best known influencers, including the models Kendall Jenner and Bella Hadid. Ultimately the event was canceled. The festival’s organizer, Billy McFarland, was sued and charged with defrauding investors. In October, the entrepreneur was sentenced to six years in federal prison. The festival’s promotional videos displayed the Bahamas’ white sandy beaches and featured models in bikinis lounging on sailboats and swimming along the island’s azure shore. But when festivalgoers arrived on Great Exuma — the organizers’ last-minute choice — the staff was woefully unprepared. Headliner bands like Blink-182 had canceled. Monsoon-like rains had soaked the tents where people were supposed to camp. Some guests, who had been promised meals by star chefs, were served sliced cheese on bread. The campaign was Ms. Rolle’s last appeal for help because she, like other island business owners and workers who provided services to festival organizers, was left empty-handed. GoFundMe verified the campaign and Ms. Rolle posted a thank-you note on Facebook. In her interview, she offered this advice: “Be mindful of strangers.” She said she had participated in the Netflix documentary because she wanted to tell the world what happened to her island community. “People have responded well,” she said. “What a wonderful world we live in where people are so generous.” Her beachfront restaurant is on the northern end of Great Exuma, where Ms. Rolle and her husband, Elvis, serve an island buffet with fresh fish, ribs, Bahamian macaroni and cheese and what she described as Mr. Rolle’s favorite “punch cocktail.” This week, Ja Rule posted an apology to Ms. Rolle on Instagram, writing, “MaryAnne Rolle we’ve never met but I’m devastated that something that was meant to be amazing, turn out to be such a disaster and hurt so many ppl.” Ms. Rolle said she did not know if he had donated money to her campaign.

5c41ff043a125f5075c0528d,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/18/arts/music/r-kelly-manager-arrest.html,"A manager for R. Kelly turned himself in to the authorities in Georgia on Friday on charges that he threatened a man who accuses the R&B singer of holding his daughter captive. The manager, Henry James Mason, 52, of Mableton, Ga., was wanted on a warrant for terroristic threats and acts against Timothy Savage, whose daughter Joycelyn is believed to be living with Kelly. Savage told the police that after he tried to contact his daughter, Mason told him over the phone that he would do “harm” to Savage and his family and threatened to kill him. Mason surrendered to the Henry County Sheriff’s Office, near Atlanta, and was released on $10,000 bond on Friday. In a statement released by his lawyer, Mason denied that he had “engaged in any acts of bullying, harassment, or aggressive acts.” He said he had, in fact, tried to help Timothy Savage and his wife, Jonjelyn, re-establish a relationship with their daughter. [Read about RCA’s decision on Friday to drop R. Kelly from its label.] The police report was filed last May, but a storm of controversy has surrounded Kelly in recent weeks, after “Surviving R. Kelly” aired on Lifetime. The documentary series chronicled decades of allegations against Kelly, including that he operates a so-called sex cult in which he physically and emotionally abuses women and keeps them from their families. Timothy and Jonjelyn Savage, who both appeared in the documentary, say that Joycelyn is among those women. But Kelly’s representatives say that the women who live and travel with him are doing so voluntarily, and that he has not abused any of them. Last year, TMZ released a video in which Joycelyn said she was happy living with Kelly and was there of her own volition. “They were perfectly consensual relationships,” Kelly’s lawyer, Steven Greenberg, said last week. Timothy Savage said Mason’s call wasn’t the last time he was warned about speaking out against Kelly. According to the Henry County police, another Kelly associate, Don Russell, sent Savage a text early in the morning on Jan. 3, the day the first episode of “Surviving R. Kelly” aired on Lifetime. Russell sent Savage the text message, at about 5 a.m., saying that “it would be best for him and the family if the documentary does not air,” according to a police report. Savage called the police. While an officer was at the house, Russell called Savage, who put his phone on speaker so the officer could hear. Russell, the officer wrote in his report, accused Savage of giving Lifetime false information and told Savage that if he continued supporting the documentary, “that they (R. Kelly/Don) would be forced to provide information disproving Timothy” and that the information “would ruin him, his reputation, business and family, because it would show him a liar.” The police said on Friday that detectives were reviewing the call. Russell, who has not been charged with a crime, declined to comment about the call on Friday. Gerald A. Griggs, a lawyer who represents Timothy and Jonjelyn Savage, said on Friday that he hoped Mason’s arrest would serve as a “message to Mr. Robert Sylvester Kelly and his camp, that no one will be bullied or threatened, and we will pursue legal action against anyone who attempts to bully or threaten the Savages.” Kelly is not facing criminal charges, but prosecutors in Atlanta and Chicago, where Kelly has had homes, began looking into accusations against him after the documentary aired. Kelly has been dogged for years by accusations but has never been convicted of a crime. He was acquitted in Chicago on child pornography charges in 2008, in a case that involved a tape that prosecutors said showed him having sex with a 13-year-old girl. But the girl in the video did not testify and Kelly’s lawyers argued that her identity could not be proven. He has also settled lawsuits against him going back to the 1990s. Tracy Sampson, a woman who said she was an intern at Epic Records in 1999, told Dateline in an interview to be aired Friday night that Kelly sexually abused her beginning when she was 16. She said she sued Kelly and reached a $250,000 settlement. Mr. Greenberg told Dateline that every woman who had come forward to accuse Kelly of misconduct was lying. The documentary, which followed years of reporting on R. Kelly’s treatment of women, led to calls for RCA, Kelly’s record company, which is a division of Sony Music Entertainment, to drop him. On Friday, RCA did just that. "

BIG FREEDIA at Brooklyn Bowl (Jan. 11-12, 11:59 p.m.). The latest EP, “3rd Ward Bounce,” from New Orleans’s best-known bounce ambassador surges with a high-energy vibe, which concertgoers can expect to be in full force at these shows. And the late hour should enhance the performances, loosening the audience’s inhibitions and encouraging people from all backgrounds to twerk to the irresistible rap-dance blend. Bounce has had a notable influence on a number of recent pop hits, including Drake’s “Nice for What” and Beyoncé’s “Formation,” both of which feature Freedia.718-963-3369, brooklynbowl.com KATE BOLLINGER at Trans-Pecos (Jan. 12, 8 p.m.). This singer-songwriter from Charlottesville, who hasn’t yet graduated from the University of Virginia, makes delicate, R&B-tinged pop; her most recent song, “Tests,” sounds like a lullaby, but nearly imperceptible electronic percussion gives it some unexpected flair. She is joined on the bill by two other similarly minded artists, each abstractly confessional with guitars in tow: Caroline Schuck is a local who sings compellingly about  identity crises; Grace Ludmila veers more toward dream pop. The bill’s gritty foil to these three performers is the experimental banjo player Gouox. thetranspecos.com DJ LOGIC at Brooklyn Bowl (Jan. 17, 8 p.m.). Growing up in the Bronx, this turntablist was surrounded by rap’s earliest experiments with jazz via sampling. His music, though, puts the two genres in conversation in a far different way: He uses his turntable as an instrument, going far beyond the flourishes meant to add streetwise flair. Instead, he improvises through spinning, scratching and sampling with bands that span jazz, funk and R&B. On Thursday, he’ll be joined by guests such as the jazz bassist Christian McBride and Living Colour’s Vernon Reid, who has long been his mentor.718-963-3369, brooklynbowl.com LADY MOON & THE ECLIPSE at National Sawdust (Jan. 11, 8 p.m.). There’s a lunar eclipse happening on Jan. 20, so the Brooklyn R&B collective named after that astronomical event is going on tour — a ritual they’ve developed over the past few years. The group specializes in neosoul with a cross-genre bent that manifests through Afrobeat, gospel and funk. The result is charmingly retro, with rich harmonies and an emphasis on live instrumentation. Harsh Armadillo, a funk band from New Hampshire, and the Nigeria-born saxophonist and D.J. Eli Fola open.646-779-8455, nationalsawdust.org MUNYA at Elsewhere (Jan. 16, 8 p.m.). Making nostalgic French pop that isn’t overwhelmingly cloying is a feat in itself, but the Montreal singer-songwriter Josie Boivin, who records under the name Munya, has even more to offer. Her breathy soprano, layers of synths and a band that can go from understated groove to maximalist jam in the space of a chorus merge to create songs that are engaging, even as they create an easy ambience. “I don’t justify/Everything comes and goes,” she sings on “Some More,” lyrics that are reassuringly laissez-faire.elsewherebrooklyn.com SLICK RICK at Brooklyn Bowl (Jan. 11, 8:30 p.m.). The hip-hop legend is hosting what’s billed as his “9th annual” birthday celebration — which means he’s turning 54 on Monday. And his debut, “The Great Adventures of Slick Rick,” reached an important milestone in November: its 30th anniversary. The album includes “Children’s Story,” familiar to most through Montell Jordan’s “This Is How We Do It” and the lyric “Once upon a time, not long ago,” a catchphrase in mainstream hip-hop. Much of his music has had a similarly long tail: Even those who’ve never listened to it will likely hear something familiar.718-963-3369, brooklynbowl.comNATALIE WEINER DARCY JAMES ARGUE’S SECRET SOCIETY at the Jazz Gallery (Jan. 11-12, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). Maybe you’ve heard: New York’s big-band scene is quietly roaring again (not that it ever went completely silent). If you’re trying to find the action, the Gallery is a good place to start, and to understand where a lot of today’s young composer-bandleaders draw their inspiration, Darcy James Argue’s long-running Secret Society ensemble is a good bet. This weekend the sophisticated, space-rock-tinged, 18-piece band will perform works from across its three-disc catalog, as well as some unrecorded numbers. (On Thursday, the Gallery will also host its 12th Jazz Composers’ Showcase, organized by Miho Hazama, with a house big band playing compositions by three young composers.)646-494-3625, jazzgallery.nyc EMMET COHEN TRIO WITH RON CARTER at the Village Vanguard (Jan. 15-20, 8:30 and 10:30 p.m.). Cohen is a young piano virtuoso with a delicate touch and an assured, swaggering swing feel; he has endeared himself to some of the most imposing figures in straight-ahead jazz, and plays in bands led by the bassist Christian McBride and the drummer Herlin Riley. But there may be no living jazz musician with more cachet than Ron Carter, the 81-year-old bassist and National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master — and technically Cohen counts him as a side musician. On the album that Cohen, Carter and the drummer Evan Sherman released in 2018, Carter’s slippery bass and Cohen’s debonair flow are all sorts of simpatico.212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com THEO CROKER at Ginny’s Supper Club (Jan. 11-12, 7 and 9 p.m.). A young trumpeter who’s equal parts insouciance and fleet command, Croker recently unveiled a new ensemble: the Big Brother Big Band. That group will cram onto the stage at Ginny’s on Friday, giving uptown listeners their first glimpse at Big Brother’s soul-and-hip-hop-infused take on the large-ensemble tradition. On Saturday, Croker returns to Ginny’s with a smaller group.212-421-3821, ginnyssupperclub.com ORRIN EVANS QUINTET at Smoke (Jan. 11-13, 7, 9 and 10:30 p.m.). Evans, a daring Philadelphia pianist, is as deeply rooted in bebop tradition as he is versatile and incursive. His Captain Black Big Band (which used to hold down a weekly residency at Smoke) released one of last year’s best large-ensemble records, but he’s equally enthralling as a leader of small groups. Here Evans, 43, presents a quintet featuring powerful players from across generations with the upstarts Josh Lawrence on trumpet and Caleb Curtis on alto saxophone, plus the bassist Ben Wolfe and the drummer Ralph Peterson, both respected veterans in their mid-50s.212-864-6662, smokejazz.com JAZZ AT LINCOLN CENTER ORCHESTRA AND NATIONAL SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA OF ROMANIA at the Rose Theater (Jan. 11-12, 8 p.m.). Wynton Marsalis is Jazz at Lincoln Center’s artistic director and the lead composer for its large ensemble. The New York Philharmonic commissioned him to write a piece it could perform in collaboration with Marsalis’s Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra, and he came up with “The Jungle (Symphony No. 4),” an ode to the urban frenzy of New York City, which premiered in 2016. (It is apparently not a reference to Upton Sinclair’s working-class novel of the same name, which is set in Chicago.) Here the Jazz at Lincoln Center ensemble will perform the work with the visiting National Symphony Orchestra of Romania.212-721-6500, jazz.org JUSTICE IS COMPASSION at Nublu 151 (Jan. 16-21, 7:30 p.m.). Arts for Art, the organization behind the annual Vision Festival and presenters of and advocates for free jazz, is back this year with a souped-up version of this wintertime festival. Started in January 2016, it has become an annual Trump-era tradition for a group committed to strengthening the ties that bind radical music and social justice. This year, the festival has been wisely pared down to six days, and has moved into the nicely outfitted room at Nublu 151, a step up from the small gallery space it formerly used. Things kick off Wednesday night with a trio featuring the bassist Michael Bisio, the trumpeter Kirk Knuffke and the cellist Fred Lonberg-Holm and a quartet including the trumpeter Jaimie Branch and the alto saxophonist Darius Jones. Each subsequent night appears promising; a full schedule is at artsforart.org.nublu.net GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO For an overview of January and February’s cultural events, click here. "
5c6173623a125f5075c0911e,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/11/style/cardi-b-grammys-fashion-review.html,"It’s possible that the most out-there moment of fashion week took place Sunday night thousands of miles away from the New York catwalks — sorry, red carpet — at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. I am speaking, of course, of Cardi B’s Grammys entrance as Venus emerging from her clam in vintage Thierry Mugler (circa 1995), her top half covered in a nude body suit and molded bustier, her bottom half in black velvet that exploded into a pink satin abalone frame around her pearl-encrusted waist. It was a little absurd and a little unwalkable and deep in the realm of costume. (She later changed into another vintage Mugler, an off-the-shoulder white gown with floor-length fringe, the better to make it to the stage to accept her Grammy for best rap album.) But as an image of female potency and coming into one’s own, it was impossible to miss. Sometimes, you’ve just got to get out of your shell. Along with Janelle Monáe’s flying buttress Jean-Paul Gaultier minidress and flying square hat, it was a reminder that red carpet fashion is at its most arresting when it is about statement-making of the very personal kind — when clothing on the red carpet was unabashedly performative instead of protective. Halfway through a fashion week in New York that, Telfar aside, has been notably sedate, and now that the film world seems to have effectively traded self-actualization for the economic security of brand marketing, it’s worth remembering. Even if Lady Gaga, the former dress provocateur, seems to have blandified herself into haute Oscar acceptability. Was it only 2011 when she made her Grammys entrance in a translucent egg? She has gone from there to understated Saint Laurent column in eight years.  It’s a journey, of a sort — and one that is presumably her choice, which is the point. If she now wants to define herself in silver screen terms instead of meat dresses, that’s her prerogative. Though the jewel-encrusted unitard she wore to sing “Shallow,” which hinted at some of the looks of yesteryear, made me miss the more jaw-dropping moments. Still, if there was any real takeaway from the Grammys fashion, it was the range of styles on display on a night that finally put women front and center. Aside from Post Malone in his pink suit covered in rhinestone stars and Leon Bridges in his custom-made mustard Bode covered in personal totems, the men, who have been peacocking their way through the Hollywood awards season, were relatively restrained. (See: Drake in his black Tom Ford turtleneck and cashmere overcoat. See also: Donald Glover, who won a Grammy but didn’t even show up.) The women, however, did their own thing. Sisters, dressing the way they want to dress. You could see it from the start, when Michelle Obama (Michelle Obama!) took to the stage in a hammered silver sequin Sachin & Babi wrap jacket and trousers — part armor, part lounge suit — continuing her post-White House/book tour-wardrobe breakout. She joined the host Alicia Keys, who did relative understatement (sure she changed clothes multiple times, but she also had a barefoot moment) in red and then teal green and then black; Gaga in her silver; Jada Pinkett Smith, who did old-time glamour in feathered Roberto Cavalli; and J. Lo, who did mystery in a giant white hat — all to celebrate the power of music. And you could see it in Dolly Parton, who did herself in ruffly red and then body-hugging white lace and sparkles to perform. In Diana Ross, who did full-on diva in the stage-swallowing biggest dress of the night (she’s earned it). In Katy Perry, who did bulbous ruffles in pink Balmain (there was a lot of pink), which both made her look a bit like a hedge and was kind of toned down (for her). In Miley Cyrus and her tux (Mugler) and the yellow floral trouser suit she wore to perform with Dolly (Valentino couture). In the Coach jumpsuit with more than 25 kinds of crystals and paillettes that H.E.R. wore on the red carpet. Like them or not, they spoke to the fact that music may be the last refuge of the fashion risk-taker. It’s one of the few celebrity-adjacent industries that has managed not to get indebted to the “ambassador of XX house” machine; where clothes still serve at the pleasure of the celebrity, as opposed to the other way around. That is, after all, how they should serve us all.  "
5c37e2513a125f5075c03d39,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/10/us/kevin-fret-dead-puerto-rico.html,"Kevin Fret, a Puerto Rican social media star who billed himself as the first openly gay Latin trap artist, was fatally shot in San Juan early Thursday, according to the police and local news reports. Mr. Fret, 25, was riding on a motorcycle in the Santurce neighborhood at about 5:30 a.m. when he was shot twice, in the head and the hip, the police said. He was taken to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead. The police had not yet released the name of the man who was shot pending identification of the body, but Mr. Fret’s manager, Eduardo Rodriguez, confirmed his death in a statement to Billboard. His death came amid widespread concern about crime in Puerto Rico; on Wednesday, the top F.B.I. official there said the island was facing “a crisis of violence.” In an article published in April, Paper Magazine called Mr. Fret “Latin trap’s first openly gay pioneer.” That month, he released a single titled “Soy Así,” or “I’m Like This.” The “Soy Así” video, which has been viewed over 500,000 times on YouTube, opens with Mr. Fret wearing a glittery crop top and matching skintight pants, holding a (presumably fake) rifle. Surrounded by women in skimpy outfits, he boasts about his looks, makeup and designer gear, and calls himself “the reincarnation of Frida Kahlo.” “I’m a person that doesn’t care what anybody has to say,” he told the magazine. “Young gay guys or young lesbians that are looking at me now like a role model, like wow, if he did it, and he don’t care what anybody else has to say, I can do it.” Latin trap originated in the Caribbean in the mid-2000s, mixing Southern hip-hop with local sounds. Bad Bunny, Messiah and Ozuna — all of whom have worked with Cardi B — are among its best-known practitioners. In a statement to Billboard, Mr. Fret’s manager, Mr. Rodriguez, said his client was “an artistic soul, a big-hearted dreamer.” “His passion was music,” he added, “and still had a lot to do.” In July, Mr. Fret appeared in a video by the artist Mike Duran, for a song called “Diferente.” There were familiar tropes — money, bikinis — but Mr. Fret’s appearance, rapping in a rainbow mesh T-shirt in a hot tub, and later in a crisp white shirt with a glitter crown and impossibly long eyelashes — was, in fact, very different. Samy Nemir Olivares, a Puerto Rican writer and activist who lives in New York, said Mr. Fret represented hope for people like himself, who had faced bullying and harassment for their sexual orientation. “Kevin Fret represented a refreshing view in a music genre that is very homophobic and very machista,” he said. Mr. Fret used the braggadocio and performativity of the genre to make the case for inclusivity, Mr. Nemir Olivares argued. “In Puerto Rico, that’s an act of resistance,” he added. But it did not always go smoothly. Mr. Fret had responded forcefully after he was the target of homophobic threats in the lyrics of a rival artist, which left some questioning whether his killing had been motivated by hate. The police were searching for another man on a motorcycle who was with Mr. Fret when he was found, but quickly fled. There was no indication of the motive so far. Mr. Fret had also lived in Miami in recent months. In June, he was charged with battery after a fight in the Brickell neighborhood. Mr. Fret said he had been attacked because of his sexuality. He had a large following on Instagram, but no posts were visible on Thursday, indicating that he may have deleted previous posts. There was just one “story”: a religious saying that translates to “Pray, relax and let God do the rest.” "

Laurence Maslon, who wrote the 2017 documentary “Sammy Davis, Jr: I’ve Gotta Be Me,” which had its premiere on PBS’s “American Masters” this week, remembered coming across a 1968 Mad Magazine satire on racial stereotypes that said three black individuals could equal an “emerging African nation” — but it would take four to represent Davis alone. Maslon, now the artistic director and writer of “Yes I Can: The Sammy Davis Jr. Songbook,” running Feb. 23-25 at the 92nd Street Y as part of its “Lyrics & Lyricists” series, mentioned this to the show’s director, Tazewell Thompson, during a rehearsal break last weekend. Thompson ventured, “It would take at least four people — or 14, or 40” to match Davis, who died in 1990 at 64, of throat cancer. For “Yes I Can,” Maslon and Thompson settled for three: Jared Grimes, who dances and choreographs Davis’s steps, and also sings; Max Kumangai, who conjures Davis’s vocal skills and dances; and Harriett D. Foy, a woman, cast as the “more mature, soulful” Davis, as Maslon put it, noting, “There was something androgynous about Sammy.” Matthew Saldivar plays mentor figures (Frank Sinatra, Steve Lawrence and Eddie Cantor); Betsy Wolfe juggles Davis’s female muses (the Broadway stars Janis Paige and Paula Wayne and Davis’s wife, May Britt). Once rehearsal resumed, the cast ran through part of the prologue, in which Davis describes the exhausting toll of his Broadway appearance in “Golden Boy,” a musical adaptation of the Clifford Odets play that cast him as a black boxer who falls in love with a white woman. “Can I be what I wanna be?” Foy rapped, to which Wolfe and Saldivar responded, chanting, “Yes you can!” In truth, success and self-actualization did not come easily to Davis, who started out as a prodigy in vaudeville. For many below a certain age, he’s remembered as a bejeweled fixture on variety and talk shows, or as the one black member of Sinatra’s Rat Pack — and as such the butt of jokes that would start an instant firestorm on social media today. But in addition to the many hats he juggled as an entertainer — song and dance man, actor, impressionist, raconteur — Davis became a civil rights activist. He befriended Martin Luther King Jr. and took part in the 1963 March on Washington and the “Stars for Freedom” rally during the 1965 march from Selma to Montgomery — even if some of Davis’s later actions, like expressing support for President Nixon or performing for troops in Vietnam, stumped younger, more progressive admirers. Maslon conceived “Yes I Can” — the title of Davis’s 1965 autobiography, and of a song cut from “Golden Boy” — as a companion piece to the documentary. “Because we covered so much of his life and the political stuff, the performance aspect got a little attenuated,” he said. “This show is mostly a celebration of his life through song.” The car accident that cost Davis an eye, and informed his conversion to Judaism, is not addressed in the 92nd Street Y show, for instance. “Because it was through song that Sammy expressed himself, really,” Maslon added. Thompson recalled gaining affection for Davis while in high school, living with his grandmother. “I remember her saying that Sammy Davis Jr. and Mickey Rooney were the two performers who could do anything,” he said. “But she said Mickey was the one who got all the breaks; Sammy had to keep proving himself and struggling. That’s why she forgave him when he hugged Nixon. She understood. She said, ‘The man just wants to be accepted.’” Grimes, at 35 a millennial who grew up watching Davis in old movies and performance clips, has a similar perspective. “I had an extensive conversation with Wynton Marsalis years ago, and until then I didn’t know how tough or complex Sammy’s journey was,” he said. “There were people who wanted him to fight and people who wanted him to make or at least seek peace. And he desperately wanted to please everybody.” Thompson figured: “The timing of his life was off. If Sammy were alive today, he would be the greatest star in the world — we would have caught up with him.” He didn’t, Maslon said, “live long enough to do a ‘Duets’ album like Sinatra or Tony Bennett, or sing with Lady Gaga. Would Sammy Davis be doing a duet with Cardi B if he were alive today? I think he would.” "
5c91306649f0eacbf105de6c,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/19/obituaries/jh-kwabena-nketia-dead.html,"J. H. Kwabena Nketia, a Ghanaian ethnomusicologist and composer who became the world’s leading scholar on African musical traditions, died on March 13 in Legon, a suburb of Accra, the capital of Ghana. He was 97. His death, at a hospital, was confirmed by the composer Fred Onovwerosuoke, who studied with Dr. Nketia and became a close friend. In a career stretching back to the 1950s and continuing into his 90s, Dr. Nketia wrote hundreds of articles and books in English and Twi, a Ghanaian language, on topics ranging from music theory to folklore, as well as scores of compositions. He held professorships at the University of California, Los Angeles; the University of Pittsburgh; and the University of Ghana, where he helped shape the curriculum after Ghana broke free from British rule. His 1974 book, “The Music of Africa,” is widely considered a definitive historical study, and “Ethnomusicology and African Music,” a collection of his writings published in 2005, is used in classrooms throughout Africa and across the world. As a composer, Dr. Nketia wrote music for choirs, solo voices and instrumental groups that used both African and Western instruments. His music was particularly informed by the sounds of Ghana, but he integrated influences from across the African continent. In his academic work, too, Dr. Nketia espoused a Pan-African ideology even as he insisted on the multiplicity of sub-Saharan cultures. “The most important characteristic of this family of musical traditions is the diversity of expressions it accommodates, a diversity arising from different applications of common procedures and usages,” he wrote. “The music of Africa, like its language, is, so to speak, ‘ethnic-bound.’ Each society practices its own variant.” Dr. Nketia devised ways of using Western techniques to document and analyze African music while preserving its indigenous characteristics. He revolutionized how the rhythms of sub-Saharan African music are transcribed, employing the 6/8 time signature rather than a simple two-beat measure. And his studies went beyond rhythmic analysis. He made a point of championing the diversity of harmonic languages used throughout Africa as well. “He always wanted to ensure that the West knew about the diversity of our harmonic language,” Dr. Onovwerosuoke said. Robert Farris Thompson, a professor emeritus of art history at Yale University, wrote in an email that Dr. Nketia was “one of the finest scholars in all of post-colonial Africa,” adding, “He showed that the African history of music was a sacred tradition revealed.” Joseph Hanson Kwabena Nketia was born on June 22, 1921, in Asante Mampong, Ghana. In the Akan language, Kwabena is the name for boys born on Tuesday. An only child, he was raised by his mother and maternal grandparents after his father died. He credited his grandparents as his first music teachers. He received training in European music theory as a high school student at the Presbyterian Training College in southeastern Ghana. In 1944, he was one of 20 Ghanaians in the first class awarded Britain’s Commonwealth scholarship, which sent him to England to study linguistics at the School of Oriental and African Studies. He also took classes at the Trinity College of Music and Birkbeck College at the University of London. In 1952, back in Ghana, he accepted a research fellowship in African studies at what is now the University of Ghana and traveled the country recording musical performances and festivals. He began developing interdisciplinary programs at the university that explored the intersections of language, dance, music and folklore. Dr. Nketia traveled to the United States for the first time in 1958, on a Rockefeller Foundation fellowship; over the course of a year he studied at Juilliard, Columbia University and Northwestern University, and developed relationships with such prominent American musicians and folklorists as Charles Seeger and Henry Cowell. Dr. Nketia performed “The Republic Suite,” perhaps his defining musical composition, at Ghana’s Republic Day Concert on July 1, 1960, celebrating the election of his friend Kwame Nkrumah as the nation’s first president. The suite’s formal elements aligned it with Western classical music, but many of its melodies were drawn from traditional songs recognizable to Ghanaian listeners. Dr. Nketia became the deputy director of the University of Ghana’s new Institute of African Studies in 1961. Three years later, having attained tenure as a full professor, he became the first African to serve as the institute’s director. Soon after, he became the founding director of what is now the School of Performing Arts, and he filled its faculty and research positions with prominent Ghanaian artists, including the playwright Efua Sutherland, the author Ama Ata Aidoo and the choreographer Albert Mawere Opoku. In 1992 he founded the International Center for African Music and Dance, an archive based at the university. Dr. Nketia was the recipient of many awards and worked with a number of international cultural organizations, including Unesco’s International Commission for a Scientific and Cultural History of Mankind. Tireless in his scholarship, he delivered lectures at universities on five continents well into his later years and published his last book, “Reinstating Traditional Music in Contemporary Contexts,” in 2016, on the eve of his 95th birthday. He is survived by three daughters, Akosua Adoma Perbi, Priscilla Naana Nketia and Adjoa Nketia; seven grandchildren; and nine great-grandchildren. His wife and their two sons, Kwabena Yeboa Nketia and Eric Kwame Gyimah Nketia, died before him. Dr. Nketia’s grandson Kwame Ametepee Tsikata, a famed Ghanaian rapper known as M.anifest, remembered him as “very generous with all his knowledge and his wisdom.” “He had an incredible intellectual curiosity,” Mr. Tsikata said, “until the end.” "
5c4b40073a125f5075c06582,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/25/us/r-kelly-kim-foxx-surviving-documentary.html,"She remembered her older cousin urging her to keep it a secret. He had said she would get in trouble if she told anyone that he had touched her. How her grandmother would be upset. A year later, as she walked home from school, two boys forced her into a Victorian house and raped her. She was in the second grade. How could she tell anyone, she wondered? She didn’t even know who the boys were. Kim Foxx, 46, carried those traumas with her when she stepped to a podium earlier this month and made an extraordinary request in her first term as Chicago’s top prosecutor: She wanted anyone with sexual abuse allegations against the R&B artist R. Kelly to come forward. The plea came in the wake of a six-hour television documentary, “Surviving R. Kelly,” in which several women accused him of abuse, including keeping them in a house and controlling them with fear and intimidation. Tensions in Mr. Kelly’s hometown Chicago have long simmered over rumors about his behavior, and a widespread belief that serious allegations were played down over the years because of his talent and because his accusers were black women. Mr. Kelly has repeatedly denied the allegations. His lawyer, Steve Greenberg, did not respond to requests for comment. But he told The Chicago Sun-Times that Ms. Foxx was unfairly prejudicing his client. “The lead prosecutor should be silent until there’s evidence,” he said. Ms. Foxx, the first black woman to serve as the Cook County state’s attorney, was in high school in Chicago when Mr. Kelly began to make a name for himself in the city — and not just for his music. Local residents say he also had a reputation for hanging out with young girls. Chicago prosecutors tried Mr. Kelly on child pornography charges in 2008 when Ms. Foxx was a sex crimes prosecutor in the office. In her circles, Mr. Kelly’s “Step In the Name of Love” was always on the barbecue playlist, and his song “I Believe I Can Fly” a staple at graduations. “This is about, for me, opening the doors,” Ms. Foxx said of her request that people with abuse allegations come forward. “We should allow people to have the opportunity to tell their stories and then vet them.” In a city where Mr. Kelly has become part of the cultural fabric, the suggestion was explosive. Public sentiment has been tilting against Mr. Kelly since the documentary, but support for him is still easy to find in Chicago. After the documentary aired, Mr. Kelly celebrated his birthday at a Southside nightclub, singing powerfully as adoring fans cheered him on. Anaya Frazier, a 17-year-old junior at Gwendolyn Brooks Preparatory Academy in Chicago, said two boys recently blasted R. Kelly songs in the cafeteria. When she asked a security guard to get them to turn it off, she said the guard told her to “get over it,” and that the music was not hurting her. “A lot of young folks in Chicago, they talk about the R. Kelly situation as if it’s a joke,” said Anaya, who takes part in A Long Walk Home, a nonprofit that uses the arts to empower young girls. Two decades ago, Anaya’s mother, Tiahanna Robinson, went to Kenwood Academy, the same high school that Mr. Kelly had attended. Ms. Robinson said she remembered Mr. Kelly, who had long since left the school, as one of many men who used to hang around the campus and spend time with female students. “I knew it was wrong,” said Ms. Robinson, 37. “But at the same time, it was normal almost because that’s what was going on in the area.” Ms. Robinson said she was no longer a fan of R. Kelly, but her boyfriend still plays his music, arguing that you can love the art and not the artist. Whether they listen to Mr. Kelly’s music or not, Ms. Robinson said, black Chicagoans are unified in acknowledging “that they don’t protect their women and it’s time for them to step up.” The documentary on Mr. Kelly “sickened me,” Ms. Foxx said. But she insisted that she was separating her feelings as a prosecutor, who must follow the law and the evidence, from those as a sexual assault survivor and mother of two teenage daughters. As a toddler, Ms. Foxx lived in the Cabrini-Green public housing complex with her mother before the family moved around to apartments on the North Side. Ms. Foxx said she knew she wanted to become a lawyer when she was about 6 years old and her mother brought her to court for a proceeding to get child support from Ms. Foxx’s father. Ms. Foxx said she remembered being impressed by the lawyers’ fancy language and the fact that they were trying to help her mother. She earned her bachelor’s degree in political science and a law degree at Southern Illinois University and then worked for Cook County as a guardian representing neglected children. One case stood out. A 14-year-old client was abused by her stepfather, and the girl’s mother blamed her for the abuse and accused her of seducing the man, Ms. Foxx said. Ms. Foxx said she could not fathom that anyone could fault a child in a situation like that. When she joined the Cook County state’s attorney office in 2001, she prosecuted sex crimes with a focus on people victimized by those in positions of authority. A year after she became a prosecutor, the office filed 21 counts of child pornography charges against Mr. Kelly in connection with a tape of Mr. Kelly having sex with someone prosecutors asserted was a minor. A jury acquitted Mr. Kelly of all charges despite a 27-minute video that prosecutors said showed him having sex with and urinating on an underage girl. In local media reports, some jurors said that they couldn’t be certain about the identity of the female in the video. Ms. Foxx was not involved in Mr. Kelly’s prosecution at that time, but she had a front-row seat not just to the drama playing out in court, but also to the one in the community. At family outings, she said, she would hear his defenders question whether the girl in the tape was a willing participant, and whether this was simply an attempt to take down a black man at the height of his career. Ms. Foxx would not say whether she still listens to Mr. Kelly’s music, saying that she did not want to show any bias in the event that there is a case against him. And she has insisted that the old prosecution had no bearing on her current actions as the state’s attorney. Her office has received more than a dozen reports about Mr. Kelly since she made her request, she said. Two of the reports, she said, came from families that lost contact with relatives the families believed were being coerced by Mr. Kelly. She said investigators would look into the complaints and that she would make a determination on how to proceed. Ms. Foxx said she needed to be proactive in such cases, in part because survivors of sex crimes have a difficult time in coming forward. “I hope that the public has seen that there is a real need to have conversations about sexual abuse and sexual assault,” she said, “particularly with young victims.” "
5c84436d49f0eacbf105c3f0,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/09/arts/r-kelly-released-jail.html,"CHICAGO — R. Kelly was released from jail on Saturday for the second time in less than two weeks after being taken into custody this week for failing to pay his ex-wife more than $160,000 in child support. Mr. Kelly was charged last month with 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse and spent a weekend in jail before a woman who described herself as a friend posted $100,000 bond. It was not immediately clear who arranged for Mr. Kelly’s release on Saturday. His lawyer, Steven Greenberg, said the person who posted the $161,663 bond wished to remain anonymous. “I promise you, we’re going to straighten all this stuff out,” Mr. Kelly said after he left the Cook County Jail in Chicago, according to television station WSB-TV. He was taken into custody on Wednesday after having appeared in court. He had been ordered last month to pay his ex-wife Andrea Kelly $161,663 in child support. They have three children together. Mr. Kelly, 52, has repeatedly denied the allegations against him, including during a dramatic interview with Gayle King on “CBS This Morning,” which began airing segments on Wednesday. He screamed, cried and jumped out of his chair, proclaiming he had done nothing wrong. Mr. Kelly’s former criminal defense lawyer, Ed Genson, told Neil Steinberg, a columnist at The Chicago Sun-Times, that Mr. Kelly was “guilty as hell.” Mr. Genson represented Mr. Kelly as he fought child pornography charges that, after six years of delays, culminated in a 2008 trial. He was found not guilty. Mr. Genson said that he did not think Mr. Kelly had “done anything inappropriate for years” because, he said, he sent the singer to the doctor for “libido-killing shots,” according to Mr. Steinberg’s column, which was published on Thursday. Mr. Genson also said that he had vetted Mr. Kelly’s songs and told him to rewrite lyrics that suggested he was attracted to young girls. He said that the song “Ignition,” a brazenly sexual song about a man driving around with a woman, was originally about a high school driving instructor and his students. Mr. Kelly’s current criminal defense lawyer, Mr. Greenberg, said “you’d think a legend like Genson would recognize a jury acquitted him and that should be the end of it.” "
5ca60e4249f0eacbf1f80e24,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/04/theater/titus-andronicus.html,"A Shakespeare play is a dangerous place. Swords can kill you. So can poison, grief and bears. Eleven corpses crowd the stage in “Richard III.” “King Lear” does away with 10 characters. But at 14 deaths, “Titus Andronicus” — with its beheadings, live burial and disgustful approach to pastry-making — takes the Shakespearean cake. T.S. Eliot called “Titus Andronicus” “one of the stupidest and most uninspired plays ever written.” That doesn’t mean it hasn’t inspired others. The image of a mother made to eat her children was hard to shake, and a couple of decades after its 1594 premiere, artists had already begun to appropriate — O.K., fine, cannibalize — its plot for uses comic, tragic and savagely satirical. Directors have staged it with almost no gore and with nothing but gore. It has been modernized, musicalized, performed by puppets and adapted to Kabuki. Stephen K. Bannon sent it into space. Its blood has spattered everything from bootleg Dutch tragedies to Japanese anime to “Game of Thrones.” “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt” gifted us the character Titus Andromedon, played by Tituss Burgess. (His rival: Coriolanus Burt.) Now comes Taylor Mac’s “Gary: A Sequel to Titus Andronicus,” which picks up, figuratively and literally, after the final murders. It opens on April 21 at Broadway’s Booth Theater. But before audiences tally whether Mac outdoes Shakespeare on the body count, let’s look back at some of the play’s more memorable appearances in culture, pop and otherwise. In the mid 19th century, the African-American actor Ira Aldridge and the English playwright C.A. Somerset collaborated on a new version that transformed Aaron, a Moor and the lover of the barbarian queen Tamora, from villain to hero, subverting racial stereotype. Aldridge and Somerset cut out most of the carnage and interpolated at least one scene from a contemporary melodrama that Aldridge had also starred in. Aldridge’s opinion: “I will venture to say that there is not a play on the stage with a more powerful climax.” A Scottish critic praised Aldridge’s performance as Aaron as “remarkable for energy, tempered by dignity and discretion.” A British horror comedy beloved of theater reviewers and the people who hate them. “Theater of Blood” stars Vincent Price as Edward Kendal Sheridan Lionheart, a depraved classical actor, bad in every sense. After faking his death Lionheart revenges himself on his critics, with murders inspired by Shakespeare. After executing six critics and convincing a seventh to kill his wife Othello-style, Lionheart turns to “Titus Andronicus” to snuff the eighth. Meredith Merridew (Robert Morley), who refers to his poodles as babies, is invited onto a cooking show and served a pie. No prizes for guessing the filling. Lionheart suffocates him with the crust. Stephen Sondheim’s Tony-winning chiller, written with Hugh Wheeler, doesn’t directly descend from Shakespeare. An adaptation of Christopher Bond’s 1973 play, its key source is a gristly 19th-century penny dreadful, “The String of Pearls: A Romance,” which describes a homicidal barber and the baker Mrs. Lovett, his unsavory accomplice. Still, the revenge plot, with its abductions and threats of rape, echoes “Titus Andronicus” and the use of human mincemeat as the symbol of ultimate inhumanity smacks of homage. As Mrs. Lovett sings, “It’s man devouring man, my dear/And who are we to deny it here.” Heiner Müller, the experimental German playwright who specialized in grimly absurdist Shakespeare rewrites, refashioned “Titus Andronicus” as a postmodern, postcolonial debauch. His version lays bare the violence of the original (arguably pretty bare already) while reframing it as a political allegory of how wealthier nations exploit impoverished ones. Drawing on the 1973 Chilean coup and a divided Berlin, Müller explores the failure of culture and human progress to make the world a less brutalized place. As one character says, “Poetry is murder.” Before Mr. Bannon became Donald J. Trump’s chief strategist, he fell for another populist leader, albeit one with more military experience: Titus. The play obsessed him and in the early ’90s, he and the screenwriter Julia Jones collaborated on an interplanetary adaptation of “Titus Andronicus.” Here, Titus is the leader of the Andronicii, incorporeal beings who come to earth and take on human form. Shakespeare never included erotic scenes of ectoplasmic sex. Mr. Bannon did. Shockingly, studios passed. He and Ms. Jones also rewrote “Coriolanus” as a rap musical set during the Los Angeles riots. Though Mr. Bannon’s space guignol wouldn’t fly, he is listed as an executive producer on Julie Taymor’s 1999 film version of the tragedy, which reset the play in a Rome both ancient and modern. Anthony Hopkins said that his Titus referenced both King Lear and Hannibal Lecter, another character with outré taste in fine dining. Reviews were generally positive, with a Times critic writing that the movie “makes the best possible argument for a cautionary drama that contemplates the absolute worst in us.” But not only Rome loses big in “Titus.” The movie cost $25 million and made back just $2 million at the box office. In the 69th episode of “South Park,” a middle schooler, Scott Tenorman, convinces Cartman to buy his pubic hair. When his friends set Cartman straight on how puberty actually works, Cartman asks for his money back. Then he vows revenge. After various plans fail, including one involving guest stars Radiohead, Cartman arranges for the murder of Scott’s parents, lures Scott to a Chile Con Carnival and feeds him a dastardly bowl of chili. “Nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah, I made you eat your parents,” Cartman gloats. Founded in 2005, Titus Andronicus, which now styles itself +@, is a post-punk Brooklyn outfit led by Patrick Stickles. The name celebrates Shakespeare’s crowd-pleasing appeal and if serving a mother the pastry-encased corpses of her children isn’t punk rock, I mean what even is? The band’s first song on their debut album, 2008’s “The Airing of Grievances,” quotes liberally from Aaron’s Act V speech. Their fourth album, 2015’s “The Lamentable Tragedy,” a 29-song rock opera about Mr. Stickles’s manic depression, name-checks the “Titus Andronicus” title page in the 1623 folio, though honestly quarto editions are way more rock ’n’ roll.

5c630a6b3a125f5075c094dc,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/12/movies/the-lego-movie-2-catchy-song.html,"That song got stuck inside my head. Before a recent screening of “The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part,” a promotion for the film was playing on a loop with a snippet from its “Catchy Song.” As the chorus repeated over and over that “this song’s gonna get stuck inside your head,” I found that very thing happening on a level so maddening I had to put my headphones in and play something else, anything else, to drown it out. Mission accomplished for the comedian, actor and musician Jon Lajoie, who was asked to write a movie song that would elicit mixed feelings: “maybe 49 percent annoying and 51 percent fun to listen to,” he said. Think Black Eyed Peas’ “I Gotta Feeling” meets Owl City and Carly Rae Jepsen’s “Good Time.” Lajoie gained popularity through comedy videos he posted on YouTube, like rap parodies, fake commercials and even a song called “The Best Song.” He had a recurring role on the FX series “The League” and now records more serious folk rock under the name Wolfie’s Just Fine. “Catchy Song” has an airy sheen thanks to production by the D.J. Dillon Francis and vocals from T-Pain and That Girl Lay Lay. In a phone interview, Lajoie talked about the difficulty of following up the first “Lego Movie” hit song, “Everything Is Awesome,” what it takes to make an earworm and why he doesn’t feel bad for parents who have to listen to it over and over again. How did you end up writing “Catchy Song?” I’d wanted to do this kind of thing for a long time. But the opportunity to write music for an animated movie is few and far between, and it usually goes to Broadway people. I didn’t know whether I’d be good at all. But I wanted to at least try. The filmmakers liked my stuff enough to let me take a crack at it. What was your objective with it? At first we were going more in the direction of a song that is supposed to drive you insane, something that sort of feels creepy and brainwashy. And so I thought about it for a while and then, one day I was showering and I start screaming, “This song’s gonna get stuck inside yo! This song’s gonna get stuck inside yo!” So I wrote an annoying version of that. But eventually the movie’s story changed and it needed to be a somewhat enjoyable song. Was it daunting to think about how to follow up “Everything Is Awesome”? Yes, there’s no way to make a more annoyingly catchy song than “Everything Is Awesome.” So we thought, let’s look at the audience and acknowledge that we know this in an impossible task, and let’s lean into the meta-ness and take it one step further. We wouldn’t necessarily have to write a catchier song, we would just say that the song is super-catchy. Did you try additional ideas before settling on this? Yes, we had a song called “All Is Amazing.” We actually recorded a version of it but never used it. It was almost the exact same thing as “Everything Is Awesome” except every lyric was tweaked just a tad and every melody tweaked just a tad. In the end, we found that it was funny in the room, but after putting it all together it wasn’t that funny. And then there was this other idea where the song would be called, “It’s Hard to Follow Up a Hit Song.” So you can see the territory we were playing around in. What music were you listening to when thinking about this? I listened to a lot of Katy Perry, Taylor Swift and Ariana Grande. Also a lot of K-pop. There’s something very specifically bubblegum there with just a teaspoon of creepy. The producer Max Martin’s theories on writing a catchy song are very eloquent. They boil down to this: find a catchy melody, keep the same amount of syllables every verse and every chorus, hit the melody at the same rhythm every time, and hammer it into the audience’s brain by repeating it over and over. I definitely took that advice. Did it take a while to get what you wanted? We’d produced so many different versions of this song and were struggling to find the right sound. I knew Dillon Francis through a friend, so we sat down with him and he took our descriptions of what we were looking for. When we heard his demo, everyone just breathed a sigh of relief. And on top of that, throw in T-Pain on that chorus, who was incredible. I had written maybe 20 different verses for that song. Then we found That Girl Lay Lay. She came in and freestyled her verses. We sat there in shock and I just threw out all the verses I worked on for a year. So this song would not be what it is without them. Do you have a technique for getting rid of an earworm? Just go listen to any Beatles song. They’re the perfect example of a band doing what pop music is supposed to do but doing it in a great way that is sustainable. Do you feel bad for parents whose kids may want to hear this on repeat? I would feel bad if I wasn’t the person who has heard and heard and heard this song for a year. There’s no way anyone’s ever going to listen to this song more than me. "
5c7047743a125f5075c0b10d,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/22/arts/music/r-kelly-charged-indicted.html,"For more than two decades, the R&B singer R. Kelly has been trailed by allegations of sexual misconduct. He was married to a young singer who turned out to be 15 years old. There were claims that he controlled women in a cultlike atmosphere. He was linked to an infamous sex tape. None of it meaningfully stood in his way. Then, on Friday in Chicago, after weeks of renewed scrutiny, Mr. Kelly was indicted. The authorities accused him of aggravated criminal sexual abuse involving four victims, three of whom were underage, according to the Cook County state’s attorney, Kim Foxx. Aggravated criminal sexual abuse can carry a sentence of three to seven years in prison for each count. Mr. Kelly, whose real name is Robert Kelly, faces 10 of them. “This was 30 years in the making,” said Jim DeRogatis, the music journalist who was among the first to document allegations against Mr. Kelly. The singer, 52, was tried on 14 counts of child pornography and ultimately acquitted in 2008. But in the intervening years, the world around him has changed. The #MeToo movement has washed across the country. As the fallout from abuse by Catholic priests unspooled, statutes of limitations on the sexual acts involving children have been raised or, in states like Illinois, abolished altogether. Women who were afraid to come forward or who were not believed are increasingly being heard. Ms. Foxx said the events related to Mr. Kelly’s charges spanned from 1998 to 2010. Three of the victims were between the ages of 13 and 16 at the time of the events. [Meet the Chicago prosecutor asking R. Kelly’s accusers to come forward.] Mr. Kelly is accused of ejaculating on one victim, identified by the initials L.C., in a forcible encounter, an attempted criminal sexual assault. Court documents said she reported the offense to law enforcement officials within two years of its occurrence. Prosecutors said that Mr. Kelly had oral sex and intercourse with the other three victims, all of whom were less than 17 years old, too young to legally consent. Mr. Kelly, who turned himself in to the police in Chicago on Friday night, is due in court on Saturday for a bail hearing. After Mr. Kelly surrendered, his lawyer, Steven Greenberg, spoke to reporters for several minutes, fiercely maintaining Mr. Kelly’s innocence and blasting the state’s attorney for what he characterized as succumbing to public pressure by bringing charges against him. At one point he claimed that all of the women accusing Mr. Kelly are lying. “Mr. Kelly is strong, he’s got a lot of support and he’s going to be vindicated on all of these charges,” he said. “One by one, if it has to be.” After so many years of accusations, Mr. Kelly became the focus of scrutiny after the documentary “Surviving R. Kelly” was broadcast on Lifetime in January. The six-part series included testimony from several women who accused the singer of abuse dating back to the 1990s. The celebrity lawyer Michael Avenatti said last week that he had obtained a video showing Mr. Kelly having sex with a 14-year-old girl, and had given it to the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office in Chicago. He has said that Mr. Kelly and the girl refer to her age multiple times in the video, which is more than 40 minutes long. On Friday, Mr. Avenatti said that the video depicted oral, vaginal and anal sex, and that Mr. Kelly urinates on the girl. At one point in the footage, Mr. Avenatti said, Mr. Kelly has the girl watch a pornographic video on a screen, which depicts Mr. Kelly with another young woman. [What we know about R. Kelly’s two-decade trail of sexual abuse accusations.] On Thursday, two additional women came forward at a news conference in New York organized by their lawyer, Gloria Allred, to accuse Mr. Kelly of sexual abuse and misconduct when they were minors. The women, Latresa Scaff, 40, and Rochelle Washington, 39, said they met the singer after a concert in the mid-1990s when they were 16 and 15; they said he asked for a threesome and had sex with Ms. Scaff. “This may not be the only prosecution of Mr. Kelly, because we are aware of other open investigations in other jurisdictions,” Ms. Allred said on Friday. Ms. Allred said that two of her clients had been interviewed by federal investigators in Brooklyn. Federal investigators in Manhattan were also looking at Mr. Kelly’s conduct, although the circumstances were not immediately clear. “We’re glad to see the allegations against R. Kelly are being taken seriously and hope that these charges empower victims to come forward,” Rainn, the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network, said in a statement. “The survivors who shared their stories showed admirable courage and strength.” Mr. Kelly was acquitted in 2008, but allegations of sexual misconduct have followed him for much of his career. More than 20 years ago, Vibe magazine questioned a marriage certificate that said the singer Aaliyah was 18 when she and Mr. Kelly were wed. She was, in fact, 15 at the time and the marriage was annulled. Mr. Greenberg has said Mr. Kelly did not know she was underage at the time. Aaliyah died in a plane crash in 2001. [The lonely, and risky pursuit of R. Kelly: Meet the journalists who followed the case.]  Now a legacy act selling concert tickets largely on the strength of his catalog, Mr. Kelly was a powerful hitmaker when he was arrested on child pornography charges in 2002 over a tape prosecutors said showed him having sex with and urinating on an underage girl. He continued to release hits as his lawyers filed motion after motion, delaying the trial for six years. The girl from the video never testified, and though 14 witnesses identified her, Mr. Kelly’s lawyers argued successfully that her identity could not be proven. He was acquitted on all 14 counts he faced. In 2017, the allegations picked up again when Mr. DeRogatis, the music journalist, wrote articles for BuzzFeed News that described Mr. Kelly keeping women in a “cult,” in which he separated them from their families and exerted tremendous control over their lives. Last year, the social media campaign #MuteRKelly gained momentum, seeking to put pressure on the companies involved with Mr. Kelly’s career, including the streaming services Spotify and Apple Music; Ticketmaster, which sells tickets to his concerts; and RCA Records, a division of Sony Music that released his last four albums. While Mr. Kelly seemed impervious to the accusations, things appeared to take a turn in January, after “Surviving R. Kelly” caused a stir. Law enforcement authorities in Illinois and Georgia, where he has lived, began looking into his conduct. And after tremendous public pressure from activists, Mr. Kelly was dropped by RCA, just two weeks after the program aired. The fact that the alleged victim did not participate in Mr. Kelly’s 2008 trial was a significant problem for the prosecution, jurors said. “All of us felt the grayness of the case,” one juror told reporters at the time. On Friday, Ms. Foxx read off the charges against Mr. Kelly at a news conference and left without taking questions. Mr. DeRogatis was in the room. “The first girl, who I met,” he said, “it was 1991. She was 15. Thirty years the system has failed. I’d like to be optimistic today. I don’t know if I am.” "
5c6d53813a125f5075c0a96b,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/20/arts/music/breunion-boys-brexit-band.html,"LIVERPOOL, England — On a recent Saturday, the Breunion Boys — a Dutch boy band set up in response to Britain’s planned departure from the European Union — stood in a dressing room in the basement of Liverpool University doing final warm-ups for their first show in Britain. The five members stared into one another’s eyes and kicked their legs in time to orders from Flavia Faas, the band’s songwriter and dance coach. They tried not to laugh as the exercises got quicker and quicker, so much so it was silly. “This is what we came here for!” Faas shouted as the group finished. A few moments later, they took the stage at the “Rock for Europe” event. The audience in the student union hall was only about 60 people, and decades older than the crowd at a typical boy band gig. Most stood or sat at the back, looking tired after listening to hours of pro-European Union speeches. “We don’t bite,” said Joshua Alagbe, 24, one of the band’s members, encouraging people forward. “We just want to show the real love between Britain and Europe.” The group then launched into a cover of the Backstreet Boys’ “I Want It That Way.” “Ain’t nothing but a heartbreak,” they sang. “Ain’t nothing but a mistake.” In the audience, David Murtagh, 69, a part-time roadside assistance coordinator, made a face to show it wasn’t his kind of music. “But I do like their shirts,” he said later. The Breunion Boys may sound like a stunt, but the group has grabbed more attention than most activists in the bitter debate around Brexit, as Britain’s departure from the European Union is known, including in British media outlets that support the withdrawal. Since posting the clip for their debut song, “Britain Come Back,” online in December, they have appeared on daytime television and in tabloid newspapers. The video for the song has also appeared on several comedy TV shows, especially a part when Seyed Hosseini, 22, raps “look at what you leave behind” while showing his abs. (John Oliver showed it on HBO’s “Last Week Tonight” then called the band “a pretty solid argument for leaving the E.U. on any terms necessary.”) The Liverpool show was billed as the first of a British tour, although the only other stop scheduled so far is in London on March 29, the date Britain is scheduled to leave the bloc. The woman behind the group, Julia Veldman, 30, an animator from the Netherlands, said in an interview that she genuinely believed the Breunion Boys could have an impact. “I’m very sincere,” she said. “People have tried a lot of facts and arguments and they haven’t moved the debate one inch. So we can but try with emotion.” “We know this is funny,” she added. “But that’s the strength of it. There’s no light or air anywhere in the Brexit debate. Now people talk about us, and then we can say how we feel. We’re a bit like a Trojan horse.” Veldman was living in New York when she heard the result of the 2016’s Brexit referendum. “That was literally the first time I realized there were people who didn’t like the European Union, which is stupid of course,” she said. She started crying when she heard the news, she said, adding, “We’ve had peace and opportunity in Europe for so long, and I don’t want to lose that.” The idea of using a boy band to deliver her message came quickly, Veldman said. There is nothing more British than a boy band, she added, mentioning groups like Take That and One Direction. “Being vulnerable and asking someone to reconsider can be pathetic,” she said. “But when it’s young boys who can dance and sing and are hot, it’s different.” Finding guys who could do that as well as discuss the intricacies of Brexit was difficult, Veldman added. Her search lasted a year. “There’s many people with political views,” she said. “They don’t all have sex appeal.” Before the show in Liverpool, the group talked about sometimes feeling like a real boy band. They have several hard-core fans, they said, including a group of schoolgirls that regularly sends them drawings. But they also get the online abuse — including death threats and accusations they are funded by Russia or George Soros, the financier who is often villainized by many on the far right. (“I wish,” Veldman said, laughing.) But all the members insisted they are doing this because they care about Brexit. Pablo Ramos, 25, the band’s best dancer and a hotel receptionist in Amsterdam, said he had been able to move to the Netherlands from Spain only because European Union citizens have the right to live and work in any member country. “Why make a limit, a border between us?” he said. The Breunion Boys have only two original songs. (The second, “The Real Deal,” features lyrics like, “Oh, the treaties we have together / No one’s going to treat you better.”) But more songs will emerge as Brexit unfolds, Veldman said. She wants the band to sing about the potential return of a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, but is concerned about getting the right tone. At the Liverpool show, it was clear that even if the Breunion Boys cannot change the course of Brexit, their efforts were entertaining people. Within two songs, more than half the audience had moved near the stage. Most were swaying — and laughing — along. Between numbers, the band asked the audience how they felt about Brexit. A student, who said he was originally from Germany, looked as if he were about to cry when he said he feared having to leave Britain. The boys jumped down from the stage and hugged him; the audience sighed. But the biggest cheer came a few minutes later, as the group finished “Britain Come Back.” It came just after Hosseini lifted his top and pointed to his abs. "
5c7fcdb549f0eacbf105b9d3,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/06/arts/music/solange-when-i-get-home-review.html,"Solange’s breakthrough 2016 album, “A Seat at the Table,” was a sweet-voiced, multilayered manifesto: the sound of one black woman finding her path forward and confronting the ways systemic racism and sexism affect personal struggles. Its successor, “When I Get Home,” is something different: a reverie, a meditation, a therapeutic retreat, a musicians’ playground. “With ‘A Seat at the Table,’ I had so much to say,” Solange said in an interview streamed from Houston on Sunday night. “And with this album, I have so much to feel.” For Solange, 32, “When I Get Home” is one more step away from ordinary pop expectations. Even before “A Seat at the Table,” she spiked her more conventional R&B albums with songs insisting she was different. Now she has nearly let go of the pop structures that undergirded “A Seat at the Table” and kept its songs catchy. “When I Get Home” is built for gentle, repeated immersion, not instant gratification. Its tracks prize mantras over hooks, and wander in structure and tempo, taking improvisational tangents. Although the album is punctuated by spoken-word interludes — bits of poetry, self-help, comedy and tribute — it is designed to flow as a whole, gradually infusing a room like incense or the smells of home cooking. The opening song, “Things I Imagined,” makes clear that Solange is offering floaters, not bangers. She sings, “I saw things I imagined” more than a dozen times, repeating the line or parts of it while continuously toying with the music: different melodies, different speeds, different chords, everything in a dreamlike flux. A labyrinthine transition leads to the optimistic, vaguely spiritual refrain that will also close the album: “Takin’ on the light.” The production, like nearly the entire album, uses layers of keyboards with improvisational tendrils and puffy, quavery, analog-sounding tones that hark back to 1970s Stevie Wonder, particularly “Journey Through the Secret Life of Plants.” And Solange’s voice is sure-footed and playful, confident that the music will follow her every whim. On nearly all of the full-length songs, Solange is credited as the sole composer and lyricist. She has a long list of guests — among them Playboi Carti, Gucci Mane, Earl Sweatshirt, The-Dream, Dev Hynes, Sampha, Scarface and Panda Bear from Animal Collective — but outside a few prominent guest raps, Solange and her musicians slip the collaborators into the background. This is her space, her sanctuary. As its title suggests, “When I Get Home” contemplates returning home and making a refuge there, reconnecting with memories and everyday surroundings that were once taken for granted. The black solidarity that was Solange’s strongest message on “A Seat at the Table” is still there in “Stay Flo” and in “Almeda,” where she praises “Black skin, black braids, black waves, black days” and insists, “These are black-owned things” over rattlesnake drum-machine accents. But most of the album has her musing on more private, domestic matters and looking inward. The home she invokes is the Third Ward in Houston, where Solange grew up. She returned there to work on this album following a period of upheaval. After a tour that was a model of abstract, starkly choreographed precision, Solange had severe health problems. As 2017 ended, she canceled a New Year’s Eve show because she was coping with an autonomic nerve disorder. Some tracks on “When I Get Home” are named after Houston streets, and Solange’s lyrics (as they were in “Scales” on “A Seat at the Table”) are dotted with references to the city’s idiosyncratic status symbols like grills (extravagantly jeweled dental caps) and “slab” (slow, low and bangin’) cars with reflective “candy paint.” Solange — echoing the artistic playbook of her sister, Beyoncé — paired the release of “When I Get Home” with an online film, which she directed and unveiled as an Apple Music exclusive. It’s a slightly abridged version of the entire album, accompanying non-narrative scenes of, among other things, black cowboys doing rodeo feats, a circular white arena holding group rituals in the desert, and dancers claiming Houston’s urban spaces. At the beginning and end of the film, Solange, in a glittering dress, dances alongside a mysteriously hooded Holy Ghost, revealed at the end as a black man. “The film is an exploration of origin, asking the question how much of ourselves do we bring with us versus leave behind in our evolution,” Solange said in a statement. The film visualizes “Sound of Rain” as a computer-animated extravaganza: a stadium full of dancers that turns into a garden, a burning man, people riding flying machines. The song is one of the album’s closest approaches to pop-R&B, with an ingenious beat, terse melodies and abundant countermelodies; the lyrics are cryptic and sunken into the mix, but at the end Solange reveals, “Sound of rain/helps me let go of the pain.” Another near-pop song is “Jerrod,” a promise of intimacy — “Give you all the depths of my wanting” — that Solange coos with the airy tenacity of Janet Jackson. For much of the album, Solange dissolves verse-chorus-verse into meditations and vamps. Keyboards supply rich chords that offer plenty of places to alight harmoniously; the beat is often an implied pulse that can and does leave behind 4/4 convention. In the chromatic haze, Solange ponders questions and considers life lessons in a few ambiguous words. In “Beltway,” she sings “don’t, don’t, don’t,” pauses, and continues, “you love me”; it’s impossible to tell where the couple stand. In “Dreams,” she recalls growing up with dreams and advises patience: “Dreams, they come a long way — not today.” She teeters on the verge of a relationship in “Time (is)” — “I was getting to feel/All the way” Solange sings — before its six-beat meter changes to five beats and Solange and Sampha each repeatedly sing an enigmatic line: “You’ve got to know.” And with hovering piano chords and hissing cymbal, “Down With the Clique” hints at the anticipation of Herbie Hancock’s “Maiden Voyage” as Solange reminisces, “We were rollin’ up the street/Chasing the divine.” In the interlude “Can I Hold the Mic,” Solange explains, rhapsodically: “I can’t be a singular expression of myself. There’s too many parts, too many spaces, too many manifestations, too many lines, too many curves, too many troubles, too many journeys, too many mountains, too many rivers, so many …” A keyboard follows each syllable of that speech, soon joined by chords to harmonize. The lilt of her voice alone could have carried these few seconds of content, but she and her musicians made the effort to match the rhythm and find its song. Because Houston is not her only home on this album; music is. "
5c832e7b49f0eacbf105c2c8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/arts/television/r-kelly-gayle-king-interview-cbs.html,"“Is this camera on me?” R. Kelly’s line, in the midst of his 80-minute interview with CBS’s Gayle King about his charges of sexual abuse, was the opening lyric of one of the most bizarre and unhinged performances of the R&B singer’s career. He shrieked into the camera: “You’re killing me, man!” He smacked his fist into his palm. He beat his chest. He paced and stabbed the air and seemed as if he might lose physical control. (Ms. King later said that she didn’t worry that the singer would harm her, but she thought that “I might get accidentally clobbered.”) He kept on rambling even as his handlers tried to soothe him and reapplied his makeup, as if administering to a boxer between rounds. The obvious question, after Mr. Kelly’s Tuesday meltdown replayed for days, finally becoming a CBS prime time special Friday night, was: Why would he agree to this? How could he imagine this might possibly help him? But you can infer the motivation from that “Is this camera on me?” Whether consciously or by habit, Mr. Kelly saw the chance to turn an interview into a solo show. Earlier this year, the Lifetime docu-series “Surviving R. Kelly,” which laid out an extensive case that Mr. Kelly preyed upon women and underage girls, showed how he used the intimate investment of fandom to escape consequences. (Mr. Kelly has denied all sexual abuse allegations.) [Read more: R. Kelly, Michael Jackson and the Lingering Questions About Child Sex Abuse Cases] There was an audience out there — fans who had heard his songs at weddings and graduations — and if he could summon up a barnburner of emotion, maybe he could get the crowd on his side one more time. He believed he could flee. But a network-TV interview while you’re facing criminal charges is not the same as performing a tribute ballad at Whitney Houston’s funeral. (Last month in Chicago Mr. Kelly was charged with 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse; he has pleaded not guilty.) The raging, self-pitying R. Kelly on this stage only recalled the threatening, controlling R. Kelly described in “Surviving,” which CBS’s special drew heavily on (including an interview with its producer Dream Hampton). Mr. Kelly’s breakdown got most of the attention, but we shouldn’t overlook what Ms. King did. Rather than match his volume, she addressed Mr. Kelly, whose first name is Robert, calmly and firmly, the way you would a tantrum: “Robert. Robert.” Just as important, she recognized that Mr. Kelly was trying to use the interview to claim a soapbox. “Robert, we have to have a conversation,” she said, as he continued to hold forth, looking past her into the lens. “I don’t want you just ranting at the camera.” Her impassive body language said it all. She was not going to engage on his level; he would have to come to hers. She was not going to indulge another man talking over and around and to the side of her, trying to shout and aggress and ugly-cry his way out of trouble. The editing of the segment underscored her point, cutting to a longer-range side view to deny Mr. Kelly the direct-to-camera soliloquy he was trying to have. The image of him, shot from a low angle, aggrieved and slashing the air, revealed Mr. Kelly’s desperate isolation like a portrait tableau. Friday’s special didn’t reveal new moments from the interview as stunning as the ones already replayed all week. (In one new clip, Mr. Kelly explained his visit to McDonald’s after posting bail, offering perhaps the least-wanted endorsement in America: “When it comes to McDonald’s that M stands for Mom.”) It also excerpted Ms. King’s earlier interview with two women, Azriel Clary and Joycelyn Savage, who denied that Mr. Kelly was keeping them captive in his home — though, as Ms. King noted, Mr. Kelly was present for the entire interview, coughing loudly and making his presence known. Maybe more valuable, the special provided context for the viral clips: the history of the abuse and “sex cult” charges against Mr. Kelly; interviews with accusers and their family members; background from experts and the Chicago music journalist Jim DeRogatis, who pursued the case for two decades. These sections, as “Surviving” did at greater length, got at the question of how an accused abuser could escape consequences for so long. But you could also look to Mr. Kelly’s all-too-familiar responses in the interview. The multiple, detailed accusations, he said, were “rumor,” the women were “lying” and “scorned.” His fury may have been jaw-dropping — but all this had worked for him, and other men, before. Last fall, his future clouded by a sexual assault charge, Brett M. Kavanaugh roared his way onto the Supreme Court on national TV. The face-off between the wrathful Mr. Kelly and the stoic Ms. King was a clash of temperaments. But it was also a collision of eras: the moment of the reckoning coming face-to-face with decades of impunity. At one point, Mr. Kelly asked about his accusers, “Why now?” “Because we’re in a different time where women are speaking out,” Ms. King said. The times may have caught up with R. Kelly. Maybe his loss of control was a recognition of that. But at other times, he spoke like he believed he had history on his side. “I guarantee you,” he told Ms. King, “that I’m going to come out of this like I did before.” "
5c5d90113a125f5075c08b7f,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/08/arts/music/ariana-grande-cardi-b-videos.html,"Welcome to In Her Words, where women rule the headlines. Sign up here to get it delivered to your inbox. Let me know what you think at dearmaya@nytimes.com. “I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it.”— Ariana Grande Bills flying. Backsides shaking. Drinks flowing. And hardly a man in sight.  For as long as there have been music videos, there have been male artists flaunting their riches with zero subtlety and surrounding themselves with gyrating, nearly naked women. But in the past few weeks, two of the world’s most powerful pop stars — women — have reimagined the played-out concept by keeping the outrageous displays of wealth and women’s bodies, but cutting men out of the picture, literally. Ariana Grande and Cardi B, who are up for a collective seven Grammys on Sunday night, recently released videos just weeks apart, in which they expertly extracted the testosterone — in front of and behind the camera. (Both videos were directed by women.)  And while both stars are coming off high-profile breakups, neither song is a lament of lost love, or anything close to it. In fact, the lyrics barely mention men at all.  [Sign up here to get this column, In Her Words, delivered as a newsletter to your inbox.] “Young women right now have a kind of outlaw energy in our public sphere,” Ann Powers, NPR Music’s critic, told me this week. “Economic independence is a central part of their sexiness, a central part of their glamour,” she said.  The video for “7 Rings,” by Grande, whose new album dropped today, is dedicated entirely to her staggering wealth, which she boasts about defiantly — lavishing herself and her band of tattooed, braid-whipping besties with drinks and diamonds.  “I don’t mean to brag, but I be like, ‘Put it in the bag,’” sings Grande, 25, about reaching a level of success that allows her to buy whatever she wants. In “Money,” Cardi B presents a hyper-glam, gold-encrusted, nudity-packed celebration of cash and the women proudly in pursuit of it.  The video famously includes a scene where she is breast-feeding her baby, peppered amid images of women shooting money guns and dancing on poles while other women (and only women) shower them in bills.  “I don’t really need the D, I need the money,” Cardi B, 26, raps.  The messages Grande and Cardi B are sending — these recent music videos have about 140 million and 45 million views on YouTube — may feel new and particularly relevant in this era, but music has a storied history of female artists flexing their independence and money, Powers said.  In the 1920s, the blues artists Bessie Smith and Ma Rainey sang about having money of their own and being supported by other women. (Rainey’s nickname was “the gold-neck woman” because she piled on gold jewelry.) Then there were Aretha Franklin, Janis Joplin, Dolly Parton, Annie Lennox and Madonna, among others, who have been forces of women’s empowerment in pop music. More recently, we have Beyoncé and Rihanna leading the feminist charge in pop by celebrating other women and being unapologetic about their success and their sexuality.  Despite all that, the music business remains male-dominated, Powers said. But these women — and more of them — are increasingly saying, “‘O.K., we’re going to do it for ourselves.’” ______ Our gender editor, Jessica Bennett, writes:  “Long before the age of Twitter, ‘Letters to the Editor’ sections of newspapers were how citizens engaged in public discourse. And yet those letters — like their more modern counterpart, the comments sections — remain predominantly written by men. (By our rough estimate, women account for about a quarter of New York Times letters submissions — although they do tend to write in greater numbers about issues like education, health, gender and children.)  Earlier this month, The Times said it would strive for parity in its Letters section. And we need your help to make it happen.

About Beyoncé, he wrote: “Maybe this album is merely a misstep, and maybe Beyoncé has yet to record the brilliant solo album that people expected. Or maybe it's proof that she isn’t quite as versatile as she seemed.” “Dangerously in Love” went on to become a multiplatinum album, selling over 15 million copies worldwide.

5c33ce4b3a125f5075c033be,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/07/arts/globalfest-world-music-copacabana.html,"They showed up in Mardi Gras headdresses, fedoras and tutus paired with combat boots. They drummed on darbukas, djembes and congas. And many of the performers at Sunday’s GlobalFest also brought grievances with them along with their costumes and instruments: against occupation, the erasure of indigenous voices, walls. GlobalFest, which took over the Copacabana nightclub near Times Square for the first time this year, is an annual showcase of music from all corners of the earth. This year 12 acts performed overlapping sets on three stages in what proved a joyful and often raucous celebration of diversity and culture’s uncanny knack for slipping through borders and stretching out roots underneath walls. As such, the festival is an inherent act of defiance against any attempt to cement hierarchies. At the same time, it complicates the notion of identity politics by demonstrating the composite nature of style. While the musicians’ art was always fueled by tradition, their distinct sounds were almost invariably shaped by the clash — or serendipitous kiss — of difference. Sometimes it was the fusion of geographically far-flung styles that yielded new musical alloys. Indian ragas took on a flirtatious shimmer in the hands of Debashish Bhattacharya, who infused them with strains of Flamenco and Hawaiian music and performed them on a new breed of Indian slide guitar of his own devising. The result was a heady mix of languid Polynesian sounds caffeinated by the rhythmic fireworks of the tabla of Subhasis Bhattacharya, Debashish’s brother. The members of 47Soul are drawn from the Palestinian diaspora, but the group’s musical roots reach even wider, encompassing Middle Eastern dabke drumming, fuzzy synth beats and reggae to eminently danceable effect. Politics are never far from the surface in lyrics that speak of dispossession and in the label — “Shamstep” — the band has given its music, which voices dreams of Arab unity across the Levant. In fact, new labels were often needed to capture new hybrids: “Southern Gothic.” “Freak cabaret.” “Afropsychedelic.” “Afrofuturist global bass” is how the members of Gato Preto describe their combustible blend of rap, funk and Senegalese drumming. The band is fronted by the explosively charismatic Gata Misteriosa, from Mozambique, who teamed up with the Ghanaian-German producer Lee Bass and Moussa Diallo, an incandescent djembe master from Senegal. Their set had a steamy carnival energy, with the relentless drive of the machine-made pulse amplified by heart-quickening flurries of live drumming. Pulses were also set racing by BCUC, a South African group that brings punk-rock energy and hypnotic rhythms to social activism, and by the Orquesta Akokán, a Cuban-American big band uniting dazzling talent and midcentury polish in simmering mambos. A very different spell was cast by Amythyst Kiah — a self-described “Southern Gothic” singer of “alt-country blues” — who gave a standout performance in the evening’s only solo act. Her razor-sharp guitar picking alone guarantees her a place among blues masters, but it’s her deep-hued voice that can change on a dime from brushed steel to melted toffee that commands attention. In performance she comes across as both uncompromising and generous. She introduced a song, the traditional “Darling Cora,” by pointing out its shared roots in English and West African folk. When she sang it, accompanying herself on banjo, the instrument’s dry warmth seemed to carry echoes of the African stringed kora. Jeremy Dutcher, a Canadian who is a member of a Wolastoq community in New Brunswick, showed that artistic dialogue can be just as fruitful when conducted, not across cultures, but between generations. Mr. Dutcher, who won the coveted Polaris Music Prize last year, draws on wax cylinder recordings from the early 1900s of songs in Wolastoqiyik — a language that is now in danger of extinction. His lyrical compositions layer the ghostly frayed voices of his ancestors with jazzy arpeggios on the piano, keening cellos lines and arching phrases sung in his own voice, which is powered by classical training and colored here and there by the tremor and guttural catch of traditional chant. Classical strains also filtered into the elegant set by Magos Herrera, a Mexican vocalist with a feline, smoky voice, who teamed with the string quartet Brooklyn Rider and the percussionist Mathias Kunzli for her new album “Dreamers.” Her songs are drawn from across Latin America, united by delight in melody and storytelling, supported by the string quartet as it seamlessly morphs from rhythm section to silver-screen swooning. And classical instruments appeared — and were sometimes abused — in what was perhaps the most extraordinary show of the evening. Dakh Daughters is born out of Kiev’s theater scene and features seven women who bring equal parts musical and theatrical chops to performances that are witty, subversive and brash. Dressed in tutus and combat boots with their faces painted white, the Daughters stalked the stage like conquerors taking possession of an alien territory. Texts (in Ukrainian, English and French) were delivered in shouts, hisses and yelps, with the voices sometimes coming together in exquisitely vocalized folk harmonies. Individually, the voices belonged to wildly disparate worlds including heavy metal, punk, and the glassy plangency of Balkan folk singing. They handled instruments like found objects: a violin propped against a hip, a cello tilted at a rakish angle. The bassist mostly drew sound from her instrument by spanking it; the drummer stomped the foot pedal of her bass drum as if it were vermin. A signature song of the Daughters is “Rozy/Donbass,” referring to a region contested by Russia, once known to Ukrainians for its rose gardens. It begins with a mournful setting of lines by Shakespeare delivered almost mechanically, with shouts of “Donbass” flung out with raw aggression. Eventually the music takes on a ritualistic whirl until it screeches to a halt with just the word “rozy” — roses — intoned as if by zombies. The song, like the Daughters’ performance, is darkly seductive and alienating at once — a powerful expression of the tensions endured by women in conflict zones, and a reminder that identity often means fighting on multiple battle lines.

5c9c7f5f49f0eacbf105f783,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/28/arts/music/hudson-yards-the-shed-arts-center.html,"On opening night at Lincoln Center, in 1962, Leonard Bernstein and the New York Philharmonic, joined by opera singers and a choir, performed music by Beethoven, Mahler, Copland and Vaughan Williams for an audience in tuxedos and gowns. The atmosphere should be decidedly more funky at the concerts that inaugurate the Shed, the 21st-century arts complex devoted to presenting new work, which is just two miles from Lincoln Center. Its first concert series, Soundtrack of America, will celebrate not the European classical sphere but the heritage of African-American music across a broad historical and stylistic spectrum, from spirituals to hip-hop. Most of the crowd will share a dance floor. It’s a statement of purpose, though it also promises to be a party. It signals that the Shed, a $475 million arts center within the Hudson Yards development of luxury retail, name-brand architecture and multimillion-dollar residences, will welcome cultural events and audiences well outside the economic elite. As with all of its programs, some tickets — spread across the room — will be only $10. “Because we’re starting from scratch, we’re trying to customize every decision to being inclusive,” said Alex Poots, the Shed’s artistic director and chief executive. He added: “We commission work across all platforms with parity between performing arts, visual arts and pop. They’re all equal, and there’s no poor relation either in terms of investment or in terms of space, in terms of facilities or in terms of brainpower.” Soundtrack of America, a five-concert series from April 5-14, is directed by the visual artist and film director Steve McQueen (“12 Years a Slave”) and will feature 25 up-and-coming musicians, five per night, playing roughly 15-minute sets. The performers’ mandate is to view the past from the present, placing songs of their own alongside music that influenced them. Their individual artistic paths are intended to add up to an expansive musical constellation. At first, Mr. McQueen said, he had imagined presenting an orderly linear musical progression, from the African rhythms that survived in Congo Square in New Orleans to the present. But America’s musical history made him reconsider. “It’s not linear,” he said. “It goes back on itself, it goes left, and it goes right. Is the wind linear? Sometimes it blows back and forth. It’s like a garden more than anything else. Things are sprouting up all over the place.” The opening-night roster includes Jon Batiste, the bandleader for “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert,” and PJ Morton, the Grammy-winning keyboardist from Maroon 5; other nights feature the rapper Smino; the Grammy-winning blues-rocker Fantastic Negrito; the blues-rooted guitarist Melanie Faye; and the idiosyncratic R&B songwriters Moses Sumney and Eryn Allen Kane. The Shed sought out musicians who are thoroughly conscious of forebears and possibilities. Serpentwithfeet — the self-described “pagan gospel” songwriter Josiah Wise — is on the bill April 9. “This show holds a different place in my heart,” he said. “I’ve always been a fan of not just black music itself, but of the narrative of black music. I’m thinking about the music of today, and how does that relate to the music of the 1940s, or the 1870s. I’m constantly thinking about it. I don’t have the privilege not to. Black music isn’t just decorative. It always has a lot of legwork.” The musicians will be backed by a house band — including horns and strings when needed — led by Greg Phillinganes, the prolifically recorded session keyboardist who has been the musical director for Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder onstage, among many others. The music, Mr. Phillinganes said, will be unmistakably live. “This is an Auto-Tune-free zone,” he said. Mr. McQueen intends the staging to focus on musicians at work. “We want to get as close to the bone as possible, to get to the idea of performance rather than any idea of spectacle,” he said. “I want to see the sweat. I want to see the tears. I don’t need glitter. I don’t need smoke.” The brain trust choosing and advising the performers also includes the history-making producer Quincy Jones, along with two younger producers, Dion Wilson (better known as No I.D., who produced Jay-Z’s album “4:44” and tracks for Kanye West, Drake, Common and Nas) and Tunji Balogun, an executive producer for H.E.R. and Khalid. Building Soundtrack of America was a labyrinthine process. To program the Shed, Mr. Poots cast a wide net of ideas — to, among others, Mr. McQueen, with whom he had curated projects in England. One day Mr. McQueen “phoned me out of the blue,” Mr. Poots recalled at an interview in the Shed’s temporary New York City offices. “He said: ‘Imagine hearing the history of African-American music. Imagine a family tree, and you hear from when the boats arrive, and African-American music starts happening all over the country, right up to now.” Mr. Poots immediately wanted to make that the Shed’s grand opening project, forthrightly declaring that African-American music was central to modern culture. “The minute the idea was hatched, this was going to be it,” he said. “I had absolutely no idea how to do it, and Steve really didn’t, but he said, ‘Let’s just start.’” Instead of a gala opening featuring superstars, Soundtrack of America will present emerging musicians. “We didn’t think it was strange,” Mr. Poots said. “But people have pointed out, ‘Who launches a new arts center with 25 pretty much unknown musicians?’ To me, it was a logical conclusion to the idea and the goal that Steve had set down.” Mr. McQueen and Mr. Poots, who are both British, knew they needed American perspectives and solid academic underpinnings, so they called on an expert: Maureen Mahon, a cultural anthropologist and associate professor at N.Y.U. who concentrates on African-American music. She oversaw a “family tree” — intended as a suggestion, not a canon — of music: from unrecorded African-American music through work songs, spirituals, blues, jazz, swing, bebop, R&B, rock ’n’ roll, hip-hop and onward. A panel of other advisers included the journalist Nelson George and musicologists with specialties ranging from current trap back to little-documented slavery-era music.  The family tree went out to the performers, but beyond that tree, musicians didn’t receive assignments; they defined their own musical genealogy. “It’s hard to pick fruit from such an amazing tree, but no matter which one I pick, I know it’s going to be sweet,” said Tarriona Ball, a.k.a. Tank, the frontwoman of New Orleans poetry-funk-jazz band Tank and the Bangas. “Or maybe even a little bitter, because the history isn’t always so clean.” PJ Morton, who grew up in New Orleans, plans to incorporate prime New Orleans R&B and Stevie Wonder in his set. “It’s a beautiful thing that we can be influenced by everything now,” he said. “But I do think it’s important to know that these are real people and real things, and to understand how we got here.”  The jazz-soul singer and songwriter Sy Smith is hoping to dovetail her father’s doo-wop, her classical music studies, the go-go music she heard while attending Howard University, the mixtape culture of early hip-hop and her current jazz-tinged mode. “I want people to appreciate that we all come from different places to end up where we are,” she said.  The initial five concerts may not be the end of Soundtrack of America. It will be filmed in a five-camera shoot; it could spin off an educational app. And given the infinitude of African-American music old and new, it could lead to additional concerts in many formats as the Shed welcomes culture without tuxedos. “I don’t view our first five concerts as the endgame,” Mr. Poots said. “That's the starting point. We could do this for years.” "
5c8bd29149f0eacbf105d4b4,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/15/arts/music/playlist-anderson-paak-sean-paul-j-balvin.html,"Every Friday, pop critics for The New York Times weigh in on the week’s most notable new songs and videos. Just want the music? Listen to the Playlist on Spotify here (or find our profile: nytimes). Like what you hear? Let us know at theplaylist@nytimes.com and sign up for our Louder newsletter, a once-a-week blast of our pop music coverage. The music struts while the lyrics bristle in “King James,” from Anderson .Paak’s album due in April, “Ventura.” The springy bass line and jazzy chords reach back to the analog exuberance of 1970s Stevie Wonder, and like Wonder, Anderson .Paak fuses an optimistic sound with a spirit of determined resistance, alluding to a jumping over wall, Colin Kaepernick and deep-seated racial hostility. As party whistles blow, an exuberant chorus joins him to sing, “O.K. now, just don’t stay down/Let’s go shake down until we get what we need.” JON PARELES A conceptual tour-de-force that lands with the force of a dance track, Holly Herndon’s “Eternal” is as propulsive as it is disorienting. She built it with other human singers and with artificial-intelligence software that manipulated her own vocals all over the place. A choir of women’s voices, harmonizing and ricocheting in counterpoint that could be Balkan or extraterrestrial, heaves above a booming drumbeat and bursts of synthesizer, landing hard together and then veering apart, with barely intelligible lyrics that clear for phrases like “too much to be contained.” The video shows Herndon crowned in motion-capture sensors and other women’s faces flickering in and out of focus, as software struggles to digitize and contain the complexities of flesh. PARELES Sean Paul, from Jamaica, and J Balvin, from Colombia, are both masters of the crossover-building strategic alliance. “Contra la Pared” (“Against the Wall”) is a canny, skeletal, all-hook production (by Tainy) that puts Paul squarely on Balvin’s turf. It tops a lean reggaeton beat with flute sounds from Colombia’s Andean traditions, as the two men take turns — with Balvin’s smooth croon and Paul’s rough declamation — exulting in how irresistible he is to a certain woman. Paul switches between English and Spanish; he’s got an eye on changing pop demographics. PARELES Angelique Kidjo’s next album, due April 19, will be “Celia,” a tribute to the Afro-Cuban singer Celia Cruz, and she’s not shying away from any challenges. “Quimbara” was one of Cruz’s signature songs in the 1970s, with high-speed, tongue-twisting lyrics. Backed by Michelle Ndegeocello on bass, the Afrobeat pioneer Tony Allen on drums, Dominic James on guitars and the Gangbe Brass Band, Kidjo reconnects the salsa original to West Africa, layering the song with a tumbling six-beat rhythm, a brass-band undertow and a tangle of scurrying guitar lines while she belts with enough grit to rival Cruz herself. PARELES RuthAnne Cunningham, an Irish singer and songwriter credited on hits from JoJo, Britney Spears and Westlife, uses vintage soul materials for “Love Again.” She tops the sturdy gospel chords from “People Get Ready” (and countless other songs) with a familiar pop premise: that her love can rescue a man from his heartbroken misery. There’s an aching, unpredictable rawness in her voice that makes the classic plea work one more time. PARELES Dwight Trible’s big, open baritone might sound to you like a wake-up call, or an entire universe yawning. (You won’t be yawning yourself.) He sings spiritual jazz with a light redolence of Andy Bey, and a heap of gospel’s influence. By now he’s considered an elder on the Los Angeles jazz scene, and in addition to running one of the city’s most influential community venues he has figured prominently into both of Kamasi Washington’s most recent albums; he’s also a member of in Pharoah Sanders’ band. Trible’s 2017 solo album, “Inspirations,” was unjustly overlooked — hopefully the same won’t be true of “Mothership,” out Friday. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO Kindly sentiments — “I never want to see you cry/I only want to see you shine” — arrive amid frantic rhythms in “Frens” by Obongjayar, a Nigerian singer and songwriter based in England whose voice puts a hoarse urgency atop a gentle core. Rooted in Afrobeat, the track pulls drums, bells, guitars, horns and more into a feverish affirmation that ends too soon. PARELES Charli XCX’s 2014 album “Sucker” was a fistful of sassy, punky pop. And while the British singer and songwriter has been steadily moving away from that sound in her own work, there’s still a spot for it in her heart — and on her Vroom Vroom Recordings label imprint. Enter Nasty Cherry, a four-piece band whose first track, “Win,” was co-written by Charli and produced by Justin Raisen, who contributed to “Sucker” as well as Sky Ferreira’s like-minded 2013 LP “Night Time, My Time.” The vibe is ’90s angst rock welded to a Sia-esque chorus, and it is indeed a winner. CARYN GANZ A chronicle of multiple romances and/or obsessions, from childhood crush to high-school infatuation to post-breakup rationalizations, “Never (Let You Go)” is two or three songs in five minutes by Deanté Hitchcock, an Atlanta rapper who sometimes slips into singing. Behind him, a slinky trap track segues into an even slower vamp that carries breathlessly accelerating but crafty rhymes: “Can’t waste my time thinkin’ ’bout all the time wasted.” His lyrics conclude, “I learned to let you go,” followed by an instrumental coda on solo piano, a quiet elegy to all the tumult. PARELES Frankie Cosmos is releasing two tracks each week from her digital album “Haunted Items,” beginning with “Dancing” and “Tunnel.” They are miniatures, less than two minutes each, and decidedly bare-bones: just her voice, elementary piano parts and an occasional overdubbed harmony vocal. Obliquely and then with startling directness, both songs consider a broken relationship: “I cry more times a day/than you did in five years,” she suddenly reveals in “Dancing.” PARELES A “duet” for a hologram world: Here’s an exhumed recording of Nat King Cole, who would have been 100 this week, with Gregory Porter’s voice dubbed in. The track begins with the two trading lines over a simple, two-beat rhythm — nice enough — but when Porter tries to weave new harmonies and ad-libs into Cole’s solo part, it all comes undone. RUSSONELLO Vijay Iyer and Craig Taborn represent two different kinds of musical progressives. Both are pianists associated with the avant-garde, but Taborn, whose playing is more ephemeral, is a spectral figure, rarely spotted around the scene unless he’s playing a gig. Iyer seems constantly in the world, leading new bands and curating concert series, snapping up awards, teaching at Harvard and Banff. Each pianist, in his own way, has become about as respected as one can get in jazz. On a new disc, “The Transitory Poems,” they balance each other’s styles, Iyer playing the naturalist and the system-builder to Taborn’s fleeting, fugitive poet. On “Clear Monolith,” a sparse and jittery start gives way to a halting dance before a blues feeling steals in and pulls the two players together. By about the 5:30 mark, they’re playing more notes but sounding more serene. Then it all drops down again, and a new cycle begins. RUSSONELLO "
5c46d2743a125f5075c059a9,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/22/arts/music/tour-laundry-hans-juergen-topf.html,"BERLIN — One afternoon in November, Hans-Jürgen Topf walked through the backstage area of the Mercedes-Benz Arena, where dozens of crew members were unloading the equipment for the final stop of U2’s “Experience + Innocence” tour. After enthusiastically greeting and hugging several of the workers, Topf, 62, came to a sweltering room filled with humming washing machines and dryers. “This is my life,” he said. “The artists live their life, and I live my laundry life.” The world’s top specialist for tour laundry, Topf has traveled with many of the world’s biggest music acts, including Madonna, Pink and Beyoncé. As tours have become bigger and more professionalized, their logistics have become increasingly daunting. The U2 tour, which lasted about seven months and spanned two continents, included roughly 150 people, all of whom needed food, housing and clean clothes. That’s where “der Topf,” as he likes to call himself, comes in. His company, Rock ’n’ Roll Laundry, provides equipment and laundry staff for touring productions. Although Topf didn’t join the U2 tour because of a back injury, he was in Berlin to pick up machines he had rented to the crew. (He mostly stays within Germany these days, because of his back, but previous tours have taken him as far as South America and Australia.) “My reputation precedes me,” Topf said, adding that, in the music world, “nobody tackled the subject of laundry, nobody wanted to learn it, until I developed a system for it.” “He is a pioneer,” Jake Berry, the tour’s production director, said by phone. Twenty years ago, Berry said, most tour laundry had to be done quickly during tour stops at a local laundromat. He said the clothes would come back wet, or, “you’d find a girl’s thong in there.” In the early 2000s, Berry said, a “little man” — Topf — began appearing outside German venues with a van, offering to pick up, wash and return the production’s clothes. Berry said that the items were returned “pristine and folded.” Soon after that, he invited Topf to join him on tour. “It’s very hard to find someone who is passionate about laundry,” Berry added. “He is passionate.” [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] A few weeks after the U2 concert, Topf, who has a gray beard and wears metal-rimmed glasses, was in the basement at the Max-Schmeling-Halle, another venue in Berlin, helping his son Achim, 31, do laundry for Die Fantastischen Vier, a popular German rap act. The biggest challenge of doing tour laundry, Topf explained, was the volume, which can vary unpredictably, and the need to work without fixed facilities. He often had to work outside or wherever he could find running water, he said, including, at one point, in empty holding cells intended for disorderly fans in a South African stadium. “I know every disabled bathroom in every German football stadium,” he said. When he is on tour, Topf begins almost every day by washing the performers’ clothes, which usually have to be air-dried with a small fan. The most soiled garments he ever handled, he said, were coveralls worn by the metal band Slipknot that had been sprayed with beer, cream and fake blood, and left in garbage bags for three days. The most common stains on performers’ clothes, he said, were sweat and aluminum dust from truck ramps carried onstage by equipment-case wheels. The dust gets on the clothes when performers throw themselves on their knees or roll around onstage. The best solution, he said, was for crew members to put down mats: “It’s better for the pants.” Washing artists’ clothing involves high stakes. Topf recalled one incident, in which Joe Cocker grew furious after a discolored line appeared in pants that Topf had washed. “I haven’t forgotten that my whole life,” he said. He also once shrank a golden pair of pants that belonged to David Hasselhoff, and a mistake by a dry cleaner Topf had hired once ruined a $3,000 vest belonging to Janet Jackson, he said. But he is quick to point out that mishaps are rare: “Der Topf is mega-reliable.” When on tour, he often spends three to four hours every afternoon ironing the performers’ clothing, his least favorite part of the job, while simultaneously washing the crew’s garments. On some tours, he spends up to 20 hours a day doing laundry, he said. After a show, the machines go into specially built rolling cases, so they can be loaded onto trucks and brought to the next location. Topf pointed out that the touring business has become much more professional and business-oriented since he began. He used to find drugs in the clothes all the time, he said, adding, “These days, I’m more likely to find an herbal tea bag.” Joe Pomponio, a stage manager for numerous festivals in Europe who has worked frequently with Topf, said by phone that, for many acts that have spent years on the road, comforts like professionally done laundry have become vital. He added that he did not know anybody who offered services comparable to Topf’s, and that Rock ’n’ Roll Laundry was a fixture on the European festival circuit. “Der Topf is everywhere,” he said. Topf was born in 1956 to a family of East German refugees. In the communist G.D.R., his father worked as a smuggler, secreting people across the Iron Curtain in potato shipments. After he was caught by the East German secret police, Topf’s father escaped with his wife to Ludwigshafen, then in West Germany, where they founded a laundry. Topf is still based there. One evening in 1982, while making a delivery for his parents’ business, Topf noticed Ted Nugent’s tour bus, seemingly lost. After giving the driver directions, he was given free tickets to the concert, and later that evening, offered to clean the band’s clothes. When Nugent’s manager encouraged him to continue his services, he began standing outside concert venues “like a groupie” and offering same-day laundry services to visiting music acts, including Elton John and Blue Öyster Cult. He eventually bought a small truck, loaded in two washers and two dryers, and drove alongside touring bands. At night, he would sleep on top of his machines, doing laundry during the day for the Bee Gees, among others. Today, Topf’s business makes much of its income by renting out machines to touring productions, and it recently partnered with a businessman who has started an American version of Rock ’n’ Roll Laundry. Topf also runs a laundry business in Ludwigshafen catering to businesses and restaurants. The laundry in Ludwigshafen, he said, features an extensive collection of photographs of his favorite customers, including Phil Collins and Harry Belafonte. Topf said that Belafonte had signed his photo, “Thanks for taking the rocks out of my pants.” “I have no idea what that means,” Topf said, “but that’s the kind of thing you keep.” "

TONY BENNETT at Radio City Music Hall (April 13, 8 p.m.). For the better part of a century, this decorated singer from Astoria, Queens, has championed the great American songbook, bewitching audiences with renditions of pop and jazz standards by Cole Porter, Irving Berlin and others. More recently, the 20-time Grammy Award winner introduced himself to younger generations with a series of “Duets” albums, on which he sang alongside contemporary artists like Lady Gaga, John Legend and Amy Winehouse. Bennett still actively tours at the age of 92 and, per the title of his most recent book, is “just getting started.”212-465-6000, radiocity.com LAURA JANE GRACE & THE DEVOURING MOTHERS at Bowery Ballroom (April 18, 7 p.m.). This trio is a side project of Grace’s, whose work as the frontwoman of the Florida punk band Against Me! has highlighted her experiences as a transgender woman, particularly on albums like “Transgender Dysphoria Blues” and “Shape Shift With Me.” Alongside her Devouring Mothers — the drummer Atom Willard (also in Against Me!) and the bassist Marc Jacob Hudson — Grace writes more restrained songs that retain hints of her punkish invective. At this Lower East Side club, the trio will receive support from the New Jersey-based rock group Mercy Union and the Philadelphia-based noise-punk band Control Top. 212-260-4700, mercuryeastpresents.com ‘LIVE FROM HERE’ at the Town Hall (April 13, 5:45 p.m.). The mandolinist Chris Thile had already taken over hosting duties on the weekly radio variety show “A Prairie Home Companion” before its original host, Garrison Keillor, fell from grace. This rebranded program, like its predecessor, is recorded before a live audience, often traveling from its home base in St. Paul to theaters around the country. Among the guests at this week’s taping in Midtown is Sara Bareilles, the pop singer behind radio hits like “Love Song” and  “King of Anything.” She shares the bill with the folk duo Milk Carton Kids and the comedian Aparna Nancherla. 212-997-6661, thetownhall.org NATALIE PRASS at Bowery Ballroom (April 17, 8 p.m.). As this singer-songwriter from Richmond, Va., knows, creating art with a political point of view can be risky. Her second album, last year’s “The Future and the Past,” was written largely in response to the 2016 presidential election; finding a label willing to release it took her longer than she had hoped. In the past year, Prass has toured the album tirelessly, as both a headliner and a supporting artist on Kacey Musgraves’s “Oh, What a World” Tour. On this stop, she’ll perform funk-flavored pop songs like “Oh My” and “Short Court Style,” as well as more orchestral holdovers from her 2015 debut. 212-260-4700, mercuryeastpresents.com [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] PRETTY LOU’S THIRD ANNUAL CHARITY CONCERT at Irving Plaza (April 16, 6 p.m.). The New York hip-hop community rallied around the Brooklyn-based D.J., nightlife personality and Fat Joe affiliate Pretty Lou Ortega (not to be confused with the member of the 1990s rap group Lost Boyz, whose moniker he shares) after he learned he had the rare blood condition aplastic anemia, which has since developed into leukemia. In its third year, this annual showcase benefiting leukemia and A.L.S. research will feature Fat Joe and his fellow Terror Squad member Remy Ma, as well as Raekwon and Ghostface Killah of the Wu-Tang Clan, the Diplomats and others. 212-777-6800, mercuryeastpresents.com PRIESTS at Elsewhere (April 16, 8 p.m.). The members of this trio from Washington have long pushed back on the “political punk” label that critics often affix to their work; still, how they earned it is clear. The debut record from these firebrands is colored by brash guitars and the muscular vocals of their frontwoman, Katie Alice Greer, whose lyrics broach subjects like consumerism and free will. Riffing on the name of Thomas Frank’s 2004 book on the rise of populist conservatism, Priests titled their just-released follow-up “The Seduction of Kansas.” This album is similarly concerned with American politics and identity; this time, though, their sound is more polished. elsewherebrooklyn.comOLIVIA HORN EMMET COHEN TRIO at Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola (April 16, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). Cohen, 28, has a breezy, phlegmatic command at the keyboard, and a deep well of historical jazz references at his fingertips. He has worked as a side musician for such luminaries as Christian McBride and Herlin Riley, and has recorded with the elder statesmen Ron Carter and Jimmy Cobb. If he wasn’t already an obvious heir apparent to the neo-traditional jazz mantle, his win at last weekend’s 2019 American Pianists Awards ought to make it official. At Dizzy’s, he will be joined by the bassist Philip Norris and the drummer Kyle Poole. They will draw some of the night’s material from Cohen’s recent trio album, “Dirty in Detroit.”212-258-9595, jazz.org/dizzys MIHO HAZAMA AND M_UNIT at Jazz Standard (April 17, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). The crossbreeding of classical and jazz has a long history, stretching back to the Third Stream movement of the 1960s. And new approaches to this amalgam have been thick on the ground of late: Just try to count how many young jazz musicians are writing for string quartet these days. One of the boldest thinkers and most delightful composers in this vein is Hazama, who studied Western classical music in Japan before making the jump to jazz. Her chamber orchestra, m_unit, blends strings and horns and mallet percussion in service of her resplendent, highly singable compositions. At the Standard, the group will be playing selections from the recently released “Dancer in Nowhere.”212-576-2232, jazzstandard.com BEN MONDER, TONY MALABY AND TOM RAINEY at Public Records (April 17, 8 p.m.). This newly opened music club, cafe and bar in Gowanus, Brooklyn, has a high-fidelity sound setup in two different rooms. In the back, which is laid out like a typical nightclub, electronic and experimental shows run throughout the week. Every Wednesday going forward, the barroom hosts a weekly jazz series. The group playing this Wednesday is a trio featuring three esteemed, New York-based improvisers with a long history of collaboration: the dark-toned, harmonically sophisticated guitarist Ben Monder, the undersung saxophone titan Tony Malaby and the roving, idiosyncratic drummer Tom Rainey.publicrecords.nyc BRANDON ROSS’S PHANTOM STATION at the Jazz Gallery (April 12, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). Ross, a guitarist best known for his work in the jazz-rock power trio Harriet Tubman, doesn’t just play a slew of different instruments (banjo, soprano guitar, regular old electric guitar, etc.), he also ranges freely from sweet and lyrical playing to wavy, confrontational distortion. Phantom Station is not a band; it’s an opportunity for him to embrace his proclivity for newness and change. He performs under this name with a wide variety of collaborators and formations. On Friday, the ensemble will include Graham Haynes on cornet and electronics, J. T. Lewis (also a member of Harriet Tubman) on drums and Hardedge on sound design. 646-494-3625, jazzgallery.nyc STRETCH MUSIC FESTIVAL at Harlem Stage Gatehouse (April 12, 7:30 p.m.). The trumpeter Christian Scott aTunde Adjuah is about to close the book on a three-year residency at Harlem Stage. As part of that, since 2017 he has convened an annual Stretch Music Festival, comprising educational events, discussions of art and activism, and performances. (The event’s title is a reference to the way Scott refers to his own music; it’s an effort to wriggle free from the limitations of genre.) He is coming off the release last month of “Ancestral Recall,” an impressive album on which West African-derived rhythms and whispery synthesizers fortify his bristling trumpet playing and the strident, subversive poetry of Saul Williams. Friday’s festival will include performances by Scott, the saxophonist Logan Richardson and Freelance, a band that fuses contemporary R&B with backpacker hip-hop and jazz.212-281-9240, harlemstage.org JOHN ZORN’S NEW MASADA QUARTET at the Village Vanguard (April 14, 3 p.m.). Last year, Zorn, the eminent alto saxophonist and downtown arts organizer, released “The Book Beriah,” the final portion of his 613-song epic, “Masada,” a collection of experimental, often lovely compositions based in Jewish folk song, klezmer and free jazz (613 is the number of commandments, or mitzvot, in the Torah). As is the wont of this serial collaborator, Zorn featured a different ensemble on each of “Beriah’s” 10 CDs (11, including the bonus disc). Here he plays material from “Masada” in a new quartet featuring three talented improvisers: Julian Lage on guitar, Jorge Roeder on bass and Kenny Wollesen on drums. 212-255-4037, villagevanguard.comGIOVANNI RUSSONELLO "
5caf2ca149f0eacbf1f82c25,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/arts/music/kendrick-lamar-pulitzer-prize-music.html,"A year ago, shock waves rippled through the arts world when the Pulitzer Prize in Music, almost always bestowed on a classical composer, was awarded to Kendrick Lamar’s album “DAMN.” “This is a big moment for hip-hop music and a big moment for the Pulitzers,” Dana Canedy, the prizes’ administrator, said then. “I never thought I’d be a part of it,” Mr. Lamar told Vanity Fair about the prize. “It’s one of those things that should have happened with hip-hop a long time ago.” It was not only the first time the prize had gone to a hip-hop work; never before had it been given to any kind of mainstream popular music. Even as Pulitzer-winning musical styles shifted over the decades, from the Americana of Copland’s “Appalachian Spring” (1945) to the fragmented atonality of Donald Martino’s “Notturno” (1974) to the joyful genre-bending of Caroline Shaw’s “Partita” (2013), the prize has remained almost exclusively the province of classical music. But Mr. Lamar’s Pulitzer upended all that. Was “DAMN.” a fluke, or will the prize — the 2019 winner will be announced on April 15 — genuinely embrace popular music? What now counts as a “distinguished American composition”? The music Pulitzer was established in 1943 as a celebration of homegrown art in the midst of World War II; the first winner was a briskly patriotic cantata by the Neo-Classicist William Schuman. For decades, the prize was mostly given to well-established composers: As Mr. Martino once said, “If you write music long enough, sooner or later someone is going to take pity on you and give you the damn thing.” There was also long a sense that awardees largely came out of the insular academic scene. In a scathing 1991 article, the critic Kyle Gann chastised the Pulitzer as a “reward for conformity and a compensation prize for ineffectuality.” After winning, in 2003, John Adams told The New York Times that, “among musicians that I know, the Pulitzer has over the years lost much of the prestige it still carries in other fields like literature and journalism.” (Mr. Adams, as well as six other Pulitzer-winning composers, declined to be interviewed for this article; Mr. Lamar was unavailable for comment.) Recently the prize has broadened in aesthetic scope and given a career boost to young composers like Ms. Shaw, who was 30 when she won. But until Mr. Lamar, it had still barely budged outside of its old classical music limits. When, in 1965, the music jury attempted to break free of those constraints by requesting a special citation for Duke Ellington, the Pulitzer’s governing board declined the recommendation. The prize has been haunted by that embarrassing episode, only partly rectified by special awards and citations granted posthumously to Ellington and other jazz legends like Scott Joplin and John Coltrane. A turning point came in 1997, when Wynton Marsalis won, the first time the prize recognized jazz. The guidelines subsequently eliminated an original reference to classical forms and, in 2004, dropped a requirement to provide a notated score, allowing for recording-only submissions. There were critics. “I don’t think it’s a good idea at all,” Mr. Martino said of the new openness in 2004. “Let these people win DownBeat polls,” referring to the jazz magazine. (Characteristic of the history of the prize is the contradiction that some of the composers who have complained about its insularity have also vociferously defended its boundaries.) Such changes, though, didn’t overturn the status quo. Since Mr. Marsalis, only two other jazz composers have won: Ornette Coleman and Henry Threadgill. Even Mr. Lamar’s path to victory last year was somewhat unusual: “DAMN.” had not been officially submitted. But during a weekend of deliberations, the five-member music jury weighed the merits of some classical submissions that drew on hip-hop influences, and came to the conclusion that hip-hop itself should be under consideration. The jury introduced “DAMN.” into the process and ultimately decided it was worthy of the prize. “We’re there all day listening, reading, discussing,” one of the 2018 jurors, the jazz violinist Regina Carter, said in a recent interview. “We were all really respectful of one another and listened to each other. There was no fighting going on: We’d argue our cases, but it never got ugly.” Ms. Canedy, who spent much of her career as a reporter and editor at The New York Times, became the Pulitzers’ administrator in 2017. She sees Mr. Lamar’s win as a step toward diversifying the submission pool. “The biggest thing we could have done to send a signal to the music industry that we’re serious about this is to award a Pulitzer to Kendrick Lamar,” she said in a recent interview. “That’s not why we did it; we did it because his work was spectacular. But if it sends a signal to the industry that we really are open to all kinds of amazing music, then that’s a good thing.” But even if SoundCloud rappers and aspiring singer-songwriters start to submit, their work still needs to be evaluated by a jury. Pulitzer juries in the past decade have typically comprised a mix of classical and jazz musicians, critics, academics and arts administrators. Will future juries give adequate attention to nonclassical submissions — or have the knowledge to properly distinguish a work of the caliber of “DAMN.” from other hip-hop entries? “Technically speaking, excellent music is excellent music,” Ms. Canedy said. “So I think if you can judge excellent music, you can do that across genres.” Maybe, or maybe not. Having listened to Mr. Lamar’s music, Steve Reich, who won in 2009, said, “I don’t know enough hip-hop to separate him from other hip-hop artists.” “To make a judgment, you have to make an informed judgment,” Mr. Reich added. “And I don’t have that. Therefore, I wouldn’t be competent to judge him.” The composer Kevin Puts, who won in 2012, said in a recent interview, “I do a lot of judging of competitions for so-called classical music, like orchestra music. I feel I’m qualified to do that. But I wonder, if there were more genres or more styles involved, if I would really be the person to make a good decision.” Ms. Carter expressed confidence in the diversity of the two juries on which she has served. But she also acknowledged that there were potential limitations in the early stages. “If you have jurors and no one is familiar with that genre, then I think it’s not even going to make it into that forward pile,” she said. Excellent music may be excellent music, but not all musicians have equal understanding or even respect for different traditions; consider the many online commenters who dismissed Mr. Lamar’s win, one of whom described the album as “neurologically divergent from music.” The prize, moreover, is not actually decided by the music jurors. The jury is instructed to provide the Pulitzers’ administrative board — which includes journalists, editors and academics, but not professional musicians — with three unranked nominations. The board then decides which of the three receives the award. “We would have been happy with whomever they had chosen to win both times,” Ms. Carter said of her juries, “because all of the composers felt really strong and their works were really intriguing.” Last year’s Pulitzer could well have gone to one of the other, more conventional finalists, the composers Ted Hearne and Michael Gilbertson, rather than Mr. Lamar. And if a future board were to be confronted with, say, an opera by Tania León, an experimental record by Nicole Mitchell, and a visual album by Beyoncé, might its members tend to select the finalist with whom they were already most familiar? “That’s just never happened,” Ms. Canedy said. “Every finalist gets its due when it comes before the board,” she added. “They do what they do, which is download the work, listen to it, debate it, and then make a decision.” It’s not always that simple. The Ellington controversy arose from disagreement between a jury eager to award a jazz master and a board concerned that it was violating the prize’s rules. In 1992, the music jury recommended only a single finalist: a work by the composer Ralph Shapey. The board  demanded that the jury provide a second option and, when a piece by the composer Wayne Peterson was submitted, the board chose the Peterson. Angry jurors then released a statement describing the board’s decision as “especially alarming because it occurred without consultation and without knowledge of either our standards or rationale. Such alterations by a committee without professional musical expertise guarantees, if continued, a lamentable devaluation of this uniquely important award.” And the Pulitzer remains singularly important — which makes its intricate rules and shifts of stylistic emphasis big news in the music world. The 2019 prize may go to a groundbreaking symphony, a confessional folk record or a transcendent mixtape. Speaking in late February, Ms. Canedy said that the music jury — which will remain anonymous until the prize is announced — had selected its three finalists. “We had a diverse slate of entries,” she said. “We have three finalists that we’re incredibly proud of, and would be happy to see any of the three win a Pulitzer.” "

THE CACTUS BLOSSOMS at Bowery Ballroom (April 11, 8 p.m.). Because of their tightly woven harmonies and rockabilly influences, this band of brothers from Minneapolis has racked up comparisons to two of music’s most celebrated siblings: the Everlys. This year, the group, comprising Page Burkum and Jack Torrey, released “Easy Way,” a record that ever-so-slightly mussed up the clean-cut sound of their 2016 label debut, but maintained a sunny outlook and retro coziness. One highlight, “Got a Lotta Love,” was written with Dan Auerbach from the Black Keys. With its heart-on-its-sleeve lyrics, it illustrates their songwriting strategy. As Torrey told Rolling Stone, singing about love is “more attractive than singing about divisive subjects.”212-260-4700, mercuryeastpresents.com ELLA VOS at Brooklyn Steel (April 10, 8 p.m.). Many women’s careers are hindered by pregnancy; this pop singer’s was propelled by it. Her best-known song, the moody, R&B-tinged track “White Noise,” centers on her experience with postpartum depression, and she has said that becoming pregnant is what gave her the courage to pursue music in the first place. The anonymity granted by Vos’s stage name (her chosen moniker roughly translates from Spanish to “she you”) further boosts her confidence, empowering her to tackle difficult material in her songs. “You Don’t Know About Me,” from her debut album, addresses women’s lack of bodily agency, and “Empty Hands,” from an EP released in January, documents the cancer treatment she recently underwent.888-929-7849, bowerypresents.com HAND HABITS at Bowery Ballroom (April 10, 8 p.m.). Meg Duffy, the songwriter behind this indie-rock project, is a musician’s musician. A product of New York’s Hudson Valley D.I.Y. community, Duffy gained a reputation in Los Angeles for shredding on demand as a go-to session guitarist and a member of Kevin Morby’s touring band. Duffy’s solo work is more restrained and reflective, as evinced on Hand Habits’ recent sophomore album, “Placeholder,” which features a softened guitar tone and raw lyrics about anxiety. After supporting Japanese Breakfast at two New York shows in January, Hand Habits return as a headliner.212-260-4700, mercuryeastpresents.com [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] HONEY DIJON at 99 Scott (April 5, 11 p.m.). “House music for me was never just about tracks,” this D.J., transgender activist and fashion darling told Vice. “It was really about creating something that was too black, too queer and too gay.” Coming of age in Chicago during the heyday of house, Honey Dijon was mentored by Derrick Carter, a pioneer of the genre. Her own style grew to be more eclectic, drawing on techno and sampling soul and pop hits, but it honors her house roots. As a performer, she strives to foster human connection through sound, channeling the sense of liberation she found in her own formative musical experiences, like sneaking into Chicago nightclubs as a teenager. tixr.com SOUNDTRACK OF AMERICA at the Shed (April 5 and 7, 8 p.m.; April 9, 8:30 p.m.; through April 14). For its opening, this flashy new interdisciplinary arts space — a cultural counterweight to the surrounding commercial development in Hudson Yards — will host five nights of concerts honoring the influence of African-American musicians. Developed by the filmmaker Steve McQueen, the series aims to explore the story of black music in America from early spirituals to today’s diverse forms. To that end, the performances in the coming week feature artists such as the jazz pianist and bandleader Jon Batiste, the rappers Smino and Rapsody, the avant-pop cellist Kelsey Lu and the R&B singer Emily King.646-455-3494, theshed.org Y LA BAMBA AND HABIBI at BRIC House Ballroom (April 11, 8 p.m.). Luz Elena Mendoza’s Mexican heritage has long informed her songwriting: As the frontwoman of Y La Bamba, she sings in both Spanish and English, taking cues from traditional musica mexicana as well as American folk songs and dream pop. Her band’s most recent album, “Mujeres,” grapples with what it means to be Mexican in the current political climate, and with the machismo entrenched in Mexican society. At this Brooklyn arts center, Y La Bamba share a bill with Habibi, another group for whom multicultural identity is a central concern. Their “Cardamom Garden” EP from last year was recorded partly in Farsi, celebrating their lead singer’s Iranian roots, and cultivated a distinctly American surf-rock vibe.718-683-5600, bricartsmedia.orgOLIVIA HORN MICHAËL ATTIAS at Greenwich House Music School (April 6, 7:30 p.m.). On Friday, Attias will release “Échos la Nuit,” an album of slow, ruminative solo recordings on which he plays both the alto saxophone (his primary instrument) and the piano. Hearing these 12 tracks is like inspecting the mysterious line drawings of a beloved artist. Sometimes you’ll almost discern the contour of a landscape or the dark shading of a limb, but ultimately the shapes all drift back into a desolate, spacious abstraction. At Greenwich House, Attias will perform solo and in a quartet.212-242-4770, greenwichhouse.org AMIR ELSAFFAR AND TWO RIVERS WITH HAMID AL-SAADI at Pioneer Works (April 8, 7 p.m.). ElSaffar, a lauded Iraqi-American trumpeter, leads bands mostly comprising jazz musicians, but he gets them to use the trundling rhythms and maqam-based melodies of Middle Eastern music, rather than the typical tools of contemporary jazz. Recently he has been performing with Al-Saadi, a singer and scholar of traditional maqam. Here Al-Saadi will join ElSaffar’s sextet, Two Rivers.pioneerworks.org JONATHAN FINLAYSON at the Stone (April 10-13, 8:30 p.m.). Last year, Finlayson, a young trumpeter with an appetite for tangled rhythm and lithe, fugacious melody, released a compelling album, “3 Times Round,” with his sextet. In the coming week at the Stone, across four evenings, he gathers a different band each night: On Wednesday and Thursday, there are trios (featuring the bassist Mark Helias and the drummer Tom Rainey on the first night, then the saxophonist Brian Settles and the drummer Chad Taylor on the second). On April 12, he presents a quintet that includes the alto saxophone phenom Immanuel Wilkins, and on April 13, he closes the run with a septet, playing a new suite of music called “The Odyssey of Big Boy.”thestonenyc.com SULLIVAN FORTNER TRIO at the Village Vanguard (through April 7, 8:30 and 10:30 p.m.). Fortner is just 32, but the New Orleans-born pianist — who’s often clad in a loose smoking jacket and fedora — carries himself with the wizened, avuncular comportment of a jazz elder. When he sits down at the piano, though, youthful energy comes spilling off him like sweat from an athlete’s back. He plays bracing, mile-a-minute postbop, often tangling up his arpeggios and using both hands to create layers of rhythm. At the Vanguard he is joined by Ameen Saleem on bass and Jeremy Clemons on drums; the group will likely draw some repertoire from Fortner’s most recent release, “Moments Preserved.”212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com OLIVER LAKE at Roulette (April 5, 8 p.m.). An avant-garde alto saxophonist and multimedia artist, Lake has been at the top of his class since the early 1970s, when he arrived in New York from St. Louis, where he had helped establish the influential Black Artists Group. In 1976 he and three other saxophonists formed the World Saxophone Quartet, an all-sax combo that became one of the most successful, if unorthodox, jazz groups of the following decade. At Roulette, he presents Alto Madness, a similar ensemble featuring three fellow alto saxophonists — Bruce Williams, Darius Jones and Michaël Attias — as well as the drummer Pheeroan AkLaff. The band will play “Tone Poem for J. A. H.,” a piece Lake originally wrote 12 years ago for the World Saxophone Quartet.917-267-0368, roulette.org ‘A TRIBUTE TO DAVE VALENTIN’ at the Hostos Center for the Arts and Culture (April 6, 7:30 p.m.). Valentin, a Grammy-winning flutist and a fixture of New York’s salsa and Latin jazz scenes, died in 2017 at 64, cutting short a career that encompassed the release of almost two dozen of his own albums, as well as stints with McCoy Tyner’s Latin All-Stars and Tito Puente’s Golden Latin Jazz All-Stars. The pianist Bill O’Connell was the musical director of Valentin’s final band, and here he presents an hommage to his former boss, playing songs from Valentin’s repertoire with a quintet that includes the flutist Andrea Brachfeld. After an intermission, O’Connell will retake the stage with a new 10-piece group, Bill O’Connell’s Afro-Caribbean Ensemble, featuring the master percussionist Roman Díaz. 718-518-4455, hostos.cuny.edu/culturearts MCCOY TYNER AND CHARLES MCPHERSON WITH THE JAZZ AT LINCOLN CENTER ORCHESTRA at the Rose Theater (April 5-6, 8 p.m.). Two jazz giants, Tyner and McPherson will celebrate their 80th birthdays together in a performance with Wynton Marsalis’s Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra. (Tyner reached the milestone late last year; McPherson will turn 80 in July.) The large ensemble will play Tyner’s and McPherson’s compositions, which have been newly arranged for orchestra by members of the group.212-721-6500, jazz.orgGIOVANNI RUSSONELLO "

SUSANA BACA at Sony Hall (Feb. 12, 8 p.m.). This 74-year-old Peruvian singer-songwriter started her career as an ethnomusicologist, specifically focusing on Afro-Peruvian culture. But when David Byrne featured her recording “Maria Lando” on his 1995 compilation “Soul of Black Peru,” she was thrust upon the international stage. Since, she has recorded six albums for his Luaka Bop label and won two Latin Grammys. Baca’s repertoire includes both traditional Peruvian songs and her own originals, but the sound is consistent thanks to her ensemble’s elegant acoustic instrumentation and her superlative, powerful voice. 212-997-5123, sonyhall.com ANITA BAKER at Radio City Music Hall (Feb. 13-14, 8 p.m.). At 61, this R&B legend concluded what was billed as her farewell tour in 2018 with a star-studded finale in September that included appearances by Stevie Wonder, Lalah Hathaway and Kelly Rowland. Thankfully for fans, she’s back with this two-night run at Radio City. The “Giving You the Best That I Got” singer’s roster of hits may have helped define the quiet storm era, which started in the 1970s, but at recent live shows, she has sounded as vital and captivating as ever. 212-465-6000, radiocity.com TALIB KWELI at the BRIC House Ballroom (Feb. 14, 8 p.m.). A Brooklyn native, this rapper gives an interesting spin to Valentine’s Day concerts: His is a love letter to his home borough. Brooklyn — specifically Park Slope, where Kweli grew up, and Fort Greene, where this concert will take place — has changed dramatically since he first rose to prominence in the late 1990s as half of Black Star, which he formed with the M.C. Yasiin Bey (then known as Mos Def), a fellow Brooklynite. Kweli’s message, though, has remained the same: He’s still using his technical mastery to push for social and political reform in Brooklyn and beyond. 718-683-5600, bricartsmedia.org [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] LIFE AND DEATH X SÓNAR at the Avant Gardner (Feb. 8, 10 p.m.). The influential electronic music label Life and Death is partnering with the Spanish festival Sónar to curate a night of D.J.s from around the world at this multiroom Brooklyn club. The lineup includes Life and Death’s co-founder, D.J. Tennis (a.k.a. Manfredi Romano), who specializes in techno; the Los Angeles-based producer Daedelus, who makes experimental electronic music; the London-based house D.J. Call Super; and the Israeli D.J. Mor Elian, whose recent work skews toward electro and ambient music. 347-987-3146, avant-gardner.com SARAH SHOOK & THE DISARMERS at the Knitting Factory (Feb. 14, 8 p.m.). With a rare combination of deft, classic country sounds and plain-spoken storytelling, Shook bucks both Nashville’s mainstream and the overly self-aware Americana scene. The twist comes from Shook’s unconventionally compelling voice, which is low, steady and a little nasal, recalling Appalachian yodeling but with a grungy edge. Plentiful slide guitar and a reliance on barn-dance-ready shuffle rhythms ground the songs in tradition, and the execution is sharp enough that the band’s old-school approach is convincing, a believable transformation of country’s vintage melancholy. 347-529-6696, knittingfactory.com SHARON VAN ETTEN at the Beacon Theater (Feb. 9, 8 p.m.). Van Etten’s new album, “Remind Me Tomorrow,” is receiving rave reviews, thanks in part to the New Jersey-bred singer-songwriter’s fairly dramatic stylistic shift. On her most recent releases, her confessional, poetic songs are bolstered by a slew of different electronic effects and synths instead of basic rock instrumentation. “I found that I was more drawn to the darkness and the driven synths and the syncopated beats,” she told The New York Times last month. The elaborate production, though, does little to obscure her music’s potent vulnerability.212-465-6000, beacontheatre.comNATALIE WEINER CLAUDIA ACUÑA at the Birdland Theater (through Feb. 9, 7 and 9:45 p.m.). Last week Acuña released “Turning Pages,” her first album in a decade and her first to consist of mostly original tunes. It finds the Chilean-born vocalist luxuriating in the breadth of her powers, whether covering Abbey Lincoln or unveiling her own compositions; she’s equal parts taut rhythm, flowing largess (think Cassandra Wilson in the 1990s) and sky-seeking mountain folk. Acuña performs songs from that album here with her band, featuring Juancho Herrera on guitar, Pablo Vergara on keyboard, Carlos Henderson on bass and Yayo Serka on drums.212-581-3080, birdlandjazz.com ITAMAR BOROCHOV at Nublu 151 (Feb. 13, 9 p.m.). An Israeli-born trumpeter, Borochov plays contemporary jazz that’s easy to enjoy. His melodies are direct and often plangent, his harmonies and rhythms sturdy and repetitious. His latest album, “Blue Nights,” draws together influences from the Middle East and North Africa with jazz-academy thinking. He performs here, using his signature quarter-tone trumpet (a custom instrument that allows him to play more fluidly in Middle Eastern modes), with Rob Clearfield on keyboard, Sam Weber on bass and Jay Sawyer on drums. The North African folk band Innov Gnawa, which was featured on one track on “Blue Nights,” will appear as special guests.nublu.net DEE DEE BRIDGEWATER at 92nd Street Y (Feb. 14, 7:30 p.m.). A recently minted National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master, Bridgewater is one of jazz’s most beloved straight-ahead veterans of the 1970s and ’80s, with a style that’s rooted in theater; she carries forth the storytelling legacies of Dinah Washington and Nancy Wilson. Her most recent album, “Memphis,” is a homage to the soul music of the city where she was born, but at this Valentine’s Day concert — joined by her typical backing trio of the pianist Carmen Staaf, the bassist Tabari Lake and the drummer Tyson Jackson — expect a more standard serving of romantic jazz fare.212-415-5500, 92y.org RUDRESH MAHANTHAPPA’S INDO-PAK COALITION at the Miller Theater (Feb. 9, 8 p.m.). Mahanthappa, an alto saxophonist, has been working with his Indo-Pak Coalition for long enough now that the group is starting to subtly outgrow the initial mission statement. They are no longer simply jazz improvisers combining musical traditions from across the Indian subcontinent. The trio — which also includes the guitarist Rez Abbasi and the drummer and tabla player Dan Weiss — has the restless, unboxable rapport of musicians broadly exploring musical sounds and strategies, with Indian classical as its launchpad.212-854-7799, millertheatre.com THUNDERCAT at the Blue Note (Feb. 12-14, 8 and 10:30 p.m.; through Feb. 17). Thundercat, a six-string-electric-bass wunderkind and merry prankster, might be the most hopelessly enjoyable artist currently making music in jazz’s crossover territory. He will do a six-night run in the coming week, welcoming a range of unannounced special guests throughout. Expect wry, hilarious non sequiturs muttered in between songs — like “Them Changes” and “Show You the Way” — that will be full of elastic funk grooves and blistering bass solos. Thundercat, whose birth name is Stephen Bruner, has been improving his vocal chops recently; his singing still has an unpretentious, conversational allure, but now there’s more body and breath behind it.212-475-8592, bluenote.net WING WALKER ORCHESTRA AND BRIAN KROCK’S LIDDLE at Threes Brewing Gowanus (Feb. 12, 8 p.m.). Led by the young multi-reedist Drew Williams, the Wing Walker Orchestra is about to release a remarkable debut album, “Hazel.” The music stays tightly woven, even as Williams switches up the grooves and harmonic palettes constantly; there’s almost always a sharp, biting cadence coming from some part of the band (though not necessarily the rhythm section). The group shares this bill with Liddle, a combo fronted by the alto saxophonist Brian Krock, playing music that draws in equal measure from Charlie Parker, Anthony Braxton and Battles — putting checkered rock rhythms underneath pelting, hard-edge melodies. 718-522-2110, threesbrewing.comGIOVANNI RUSSONELLO "
5c534d323a125f5075c075f3,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/arts/television/comedy-songs.html,"Are you obsessed? The comic Catherine Cohen, 27, frequently asks her audience this question, and the way she swans around the stage tells you she finds the answer self-evident. To be fair, Cohen has earned a pretty obsessed following in part because of her finely sharpened first impression, that of a preposterously preening, rigorously self-regarding, sexually arrogant diva in Lululemon leggings. But it’s when she starts singing that her act deepens, and jokes about buffoonish bravado segue into ones about vulnerability and delusion. “Boys never wanted to kiss me, so now I do comedy,” she sings, smiling. It’s her thesis statement of a song, and the refrain “Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. Look at me!” is accompanied by Norma Desmond eyes and hustling footwork. Cohen is part of a resurgence of young comics making jokes you can hum, the latest to join a long tradition that includes stars from Steve Martin to Weird Al Yankovic. These days, comics are singing almost every night of the week at intimate spaces like Union Hall, Caveat and Club Cumming, packed with the kind of 20-something audiences that New York theater has long courted (mostly unsuccessfully). Frequent programs like “Pop Show,” with the charismatic host Ziwe Fumudoh, dedicated to original comic songs, regularly draw crowds; and traditional cabaret venues like Don’t Tell Mama in Times Square have recently started weekend stand-up nights accompanied by a piano player. In her finest tune, Cohen dreams aloud about leaving the city for an ideal life upstate. It begins meditatively mundane (“Think of the Instagrams I’d take/Think of the four pages of a novel I’d read/upstate”). Then she speeds up, dancing furiously, as she spirals into a yearning moan about the joys of apple picking. Only in song does she reveal the true insecurity of her character, the comic desperation of someone whose boasting hides some conventional aspirations: getting a boyfriend and living in Beacon, which in her fevered fantasy are related. Some of the popularity of these artists, who still fall under the hopelessly vague yet somehow enduring term of alternative comedy, may be a function of the decline of contemporary musical comedy. If you’re a musically inclined comedian who grew up in the past few decades, you are more likely to have laughed at work from Flight of the Conchords or the Lonely Island than at a Broadway show. Many of these young performers appear to be artistic descendants of “Our Hit Parade,” the defunct downtown showcase where dynamic artists like Erin Markey, Cole Escola and Bridget Everett blended comedy, cabaret and the pop charts. Its end in 2012 left a vacuum that has been filled by comedy. Neal Medlyn, one of the founders of that influential show, performs in the outlandish persona of the pink onesie-wearing rapper Champagne Jerry, and at a recent performance at Joe’s Pub, he paused to ask of his own evening: “Is it a comedy show? Is it a music show? Is it a tractor pull?” Younger performers are more likely to just call themselves comics. Larry Owens, a dynamo who appeared later in this show, is a good example. He studied drama and improvisation at the Steppenwolf Theater Company in Chicago and is well versed in Stephen Sondheim. But at the moment, you are most likely to see him on a bill of stand-ups. (This may change in May, when he stars as an aspiring artist in the new musical “A Strange Loop” at Playwrights Horizons.) While Cohen’s act is more like a musical that breaks into song when the characters need to express something more emotional, Owens is at his best when he quickly jumps right into a song. Of all the comedians who sing, he has the most virtuosic voice, a powerful, nimble instrument that can inject a cover of the “Fresh Prince of Bel-Air” theme with an ominous intensity or imbue a ballad to Oprah Winfrey with the kind of gravitas that could make you weep. The pianist Henry Koperski is the connective tissue for many of the artists in this scene, including Owens and Cohen, whom he writes music for and plays alongside on Wednesdays at Club Cumming in the East Village. On a recent Wednesday, when Cohen was performing at Joe’s Pub, Matt Rogers, who also works with Koperski, substituted for her, asking the Club Cumming crowd stuffed into its long hallway of a space: “Any straight people in the audience?” When a few women shouted, he responded wryly: “No, this is like 1912. Women don’t count.” Then the room went quiet. “If you’re a straight, that’s O.K.,” he said. “Some of my best friends are straight.” He delivered a velvety-voiced, soulful breakup tune about his love for Disney World that is the funniest tribute to Orlando since “The Book of Mormon.” His songs lean on a strong premise with a twist, but end not with a hard joke, but on a delicate emotional note. At the same show, Marcia Belsky, who has written a musical version of “The Handmaid’s Tale” set in 2028 Brooklyn, sang about how annoying it is when rich people get really into nature. “Don’t stress because deep down we’re all animals,” she sang, describing a dialogue with a wealthy man. “Yes, but you’re an animal who owns a yacht.” Take away the music, and these songs could be turned into stand-up bits, though not as funny. When the joke leans on an exaggerated reaction to the ordinary, it helps to have some dramatic notes to belt out. Musical comedy may be even more popular among artists who work online since comic songs tend to go viral faster than jokes told at a microphone, which may be why musical segments Leslie Jones’s tribute to the Upper East Side last week are as integral to the mix of sketches on “Saturday Night Live” as ever. It’s also why so many musical comedians work online. Demi Adejuyigbe, an inventive writer for “The Late Late Show With James Corden,” posts pop-culture spoofs, including a spot-on Childish Gambino and an annual and increasingly elaborate re-edit of the Earth, Wind & Fire song “September.” But the artist who captures the low-rent spirit of early Bo Burnham videos best is Matt Buechele, who has a gift for spotting and lampooning musical clichés in only a few seconds at his keyboard. His impressions reflect a perceptive ear, whether for that moment in a musical right before the romantic couple break out into song or how movies remix their hit song for the end credits. Improv comedy has not been immune to this trend. Baby Wants Candy, a musical juggernaut that started in the late 1990s, now has permanent shows in Los Angeles, Chicago and New York. Its alumni have also started their own companies, including North Coast, a hip-hop improv troupe that mounts a “Hamilton”-inspired show called “Anybody” at Caveat that tells the story of a historical figure. But the most impressive improvised musical I have seen is “Your Love, Our Musical,” also at Caveat, a double act in which Rebecca Vigil and Evan Kaufman interview a couple from the audience and turn their romantic origin story into a fluidly structured, tuneful show. On the night I attended, the artists were lucky enough to find a couple who met at a rationalist association and began a polyamorous relationship. And yet, as fertile material as this may be, part of the reason crowds roar at these shows is undeniably the perceived level of difficulty. If you think improvising an entire show seems like a magic trick, doing it with a full band and jokes that rhyme is like making the Statue of Liberty disappear.

But there were literal brass instruments, bells up and held high, at the official opening of the Shed on Friday night. The first public performance — inside the cavernous McCourt space at the new arts center, one of the most ambitious and high-profile additions to New York City’s cultural landscape in years — began with a marching band exuberantly parading through the audience. It was the start of Soundtrack of America, a five-concert series paying homage to the history of African-American music, conceived by the filmmaker and artist Steve McQueen. He and Quincy Jones watched from the sidelines as the instrumentalists made their joyous entrance. Nearby was Alex Poots, the Shed’s artistic director and chief executive, pacing on the periphery. He was witnessing not only the inauguration of an institution more than a decade (and $475 million) in the making, but also of the programming he has been developing since he joined in 2014. [Read more about the Shed’s development.] For the Shed’s first weekend, he had commissioned “Soundtrack for America,” as well as the interdisciplinary “Reich Richter Pärt,” new work by the artist Trisha Donnelly and the play “Norma Jeane Baker of Troy,” starring Ben Whishaw and Renée Fleming. On Wednesday evening, the Shed had opened its doors to mostly donors and industry insiders for a preview party. Mr. Poots and Elizabeth Diller — the architect whose firm, Diller Scofidio + Renfro, designed the building in collaboration with the Rockwell Group — were tapped on the shoulders by a near-constant stream of luminaries offering congratulations. It was a long day for Ms. Diller, who arrived at the building around 8 a.m. and stayed at the party until 10:30 p.m. (To unwind, she said, she and her husband, Ricardo Scofidio, went out for ramen. She was back at her office by 9 a.m.) There was a preview of “Reich Richter Pärt”; afterward, Steve Reich said in an interview that he was happy to finally hear his score with a large crowd, and not in the acoustics of an empty room. He was there again for the piece’s first public performances on Saturday. [Our guide to navigating the Shed and Hudson Yards.] By the weekend, the building was operational, though not fully finished. One crucial escalator wasn’t completely installed; another was in and out of service. A bartender for Cedric’s, the Shed’s not-yet-open restaurant by Danny Meyer’s Union Square Hospitality Group, apologetically handed out free bottles of water and said that it would probably be up and running by late April. But that didn’t stop thousands of visitors from passing through. “Reich Richter Pärt” drew a solemnly attentive audience. “Norma Jeane Baker of Troy” had a full house for its premiere. (A review of that is coming this week.) Part of Trisha Donnelly’s show was treated as an observation gallery; one man asked a Shed employee where the exhibition was, not knowing he was standing in the middle of it. What did our critics think of the opening weekend? Here are their reviews. JOSHUA BARONE Critic’s Pick Through April 14 in the McCourt.  Thundering syncopation and a parade through the audience opened the first part of Soundtrack of America, a five-concert survey of African-American music. The McCourt was configured as a club, with a plywood stage, a dance floor, a D.J. and a seated aerie. Jon Batiste was leading the Howard University “Showtime” Marching Band, the Brooklyn United drumline and his own 369th Experience brass band. Their set commemorated James Reese Europe, a pioneer in bringing African-American music to concert halls — including Carnegie Hall in 1912 — and recordings. During World War I, he served in the segregated 369th Infantry Regiment, known as the Harlem Hellfighters, and directed its regimental band, which introduced ragtime across Europe. Mr. Batiste’s 369th Experience musicians wore military khakis. The roar of massed drums turned into W.C. Handy’s “Memphis Blues,” a Hellfighters favorite. Mr. Batiste paired ragtime tunes with his own “Golden Crown,” rooted in the Mardi Gras Indian music of his hometown, New Orleans. He declared, “We summoning the ancestors tonight!” That’s the mission of Soundtrack of America, conceived by Steve McQueen as a joyful history lesson and advised by Quincy Jones and others. Dedicated to continuity and cultural memory, each concert features five musicians performing songs that inspired them, alongside their own music. Friday’s lineup included performers and songwriters (PJ Morton, Victory, Rapsody and Sheléa) backed by the keyboardist Greg Phillinganes leading a supremely adaptable band. They chose more recent, more familiar musical ancestors — less history, more hits — and were willing to risk having their songs compared with the pantheon. Mr. Morton, a keyboardist in Maroon 5, invoked both the two-fisted New Orleans piano tradition and Stevie Wonder, putting gospel flourishes into the Fats Domino hit “Blueberry Hill” and barreling through Mr. Wonder’s “Higher Ground” on the way to his own ballad, “First Began,” full of Wonder-like chord changes and vocal turns. With her burnished, supple alto, Victory started “Feeling Good,” a Nina Simone showpiece, as a bluesy reflection, then shifted it toward the Caribbean lilt of her own songs calling for self-acceptance. Rapsody, a rapper from North Carolina, emphasized women’s power and self-determination. She declaimed her rhymes with decisive, leaping inflections, linking her material to Nina Simone, Queen Latifah, Lauryn Hill, Roberta Flack and (joined by Victory singing “Strange Fruit”) Billie Holiday. Sheléa juxtaposed her elegantly retro jazz ballad “Love Fell on Me” with crowd-pleasing homages to Sarah Vaughan, Whitney Houston and Aretha Franklin. Mr. Phillinganes and the band added their renditions of songs by Ray Charles, James Brown and Thelonious Monk. On the way out, concertgoers received a poster-size family tree tracing 400 years of interconnected African-American music. For all the major figures that its opening night touched on, Soundtrack of America has plenty of pantheon left. JON PARELES Through June 2 in the Level 2 Gallery. A few minutes after the audience has entered the first of two gallery spaces that make up “Reich Richter Pärt,” chanting begins. It turns out the singers, dressed in street clothes, have been embedded among us — a tired trick of contemporary performance. Members of the Choir of Trinity Wall Street sing, and repeat three times, “Drei Hirtenkinder aus Fátima,” a spirited piece in Arvo Pärt’s neo-Medieval style. When this collaboration between Pärt and the artist Gerhard Richter was new, in England in 2015, “Drei Hirtenkinder” was heard among Richter’s somber “Double Gray” diptychs and “Birkenau,” a series of abstractions concealing photographs of concentration-camp prisoners. Perhaps a little heavy for the Shed’s opening festivities?  Now, amid the cheerful commerce of Hudson Yards, the only history being reflected upon is that of the artists’ collaboration itself. “The History of ‘Reich Richter Pärt,’” the program screams in inch-high capital letters, endowing with epochal import a 50-minute interplay among three octogenarian cultural celebrities. No more concentration camps. The art, lit with reverential spots, is tall columns of wallpaper and a few rectangles of tapestry. The space is perhaps meant to evoke a cathedral: A text claims these Richters “emulate stained glass.” The adjacent room is wrapped in more wallpaper: panoramic pieces printed with the final stage of Richter’s “Patterns,” a 2012 book project that halved and mirrored an earlier abstract painting, over and over, into ever-thinner strips that eventually resolve into long, horizontal bands of color. A film, by Mr. Richter and Corinna Belz, depicts the “Patterns” process, then its reversal, to the live accompaniment of a new score by Steve Reich, played on Saturday by Ensemble Signal, that also undergoes a symmetrical process-based transformation. (The International Contemporary Ensemble will fill in for some performances in the eight-week, four-times-daily run; the Brooklyn Youth Chorus similarly shares the workload for the Pärt.) A two-note motif builds to complex, rhythmically agile brightness, then gradually recedes back into blur as we watch Richter’s bands seem to rush by at light speed, fervently oscillating, at the finale. The music has tender energy, and an undercurrent of melancholy. Its droning tones sometimes seem to be pulling apart — like taffy, or like Richter’s stretching spaghetti stripes of color. The film, by contrast, feels merely self-fascinated. But two masters have been brought together, furthering the reputation of each; in the collaboration-consumed, eminence-obsessed ethos of high-end art-making these days, that’s all that matters. ZACHARY WOOLFE Through May 30 in the Level 4 Gallery.  In choosing the American artist Trisha Donnelly for the Shed’s first solo exhibition, the curators here opted for a tactician and a troublemaker — one whose terse, enigmatic maneuvers stand far from the sparkle and retail of Hudson Yards.  Ms. Donnelly’s page in the Shed’s brochure for its first season is blank. Her show, alone among the inaugural offerings, is not signposted beside the half-finished escalators. And she has bridled against the building’s architecture, forcing spectators through the side entrance of the new gallery into a half-lit space that some will confuse for the back of house.  You wanted an artist who’d push the boundaries of the new institution? Be careful what you ask for. Inscrutability, provisionality, self-effacement: These are the contrivances of Ms. Donnelly, whose untitled exhibition is the only project here that puts the Shed itself in question. In the dim gallery you will see segments of two massive tree trunks, a redwood and a pine, lying like cadavers on simple dollies. Water puddles beneath them (these trees, though blasted, are still alive), and their amputated branches have been dressed with white plastic foam bundles that appear like tourniquets. Dozens of smaller branches, many also bandaged, balance in a corner. A sound system positioned on a dolly as its own sculpture roars a single aria on loop: the Habanera from “Carmen,” sung by Leontyne Price and rattling the speakers. The blaring Bizet, extolling love as “the child of the bohemian,” and the bandaged trees, recalling mutilated soldiers, suggest joys and pains that have no place in Hudson Yards. Yet how these elements inform one another, as easy opposites of nature and culture or of life and death, is less important than whether they together can conjure an atmosphere of whispers, diversions, mistakes, vanishings. When the art world was smaller, Ms. Donnelly’s evanescent, undocumented interventions — most famously, a 2002 performance in which she rode into a gallery on horseback, proclaimed a military surrender, then galloped back out — had the thrill of a runaway rumor. Today, when every exhibition is Instagrammed and hashtagged, that effect has become almost impossible to realize, which Ms. Donnelly has surely acknowledged by leaving a narrow gap in the wall built to block the windows. At the hour I visited, the light passing through it cast a faint camera-obscura gleam of the soon-to-open Equinox Hotel. This artist’s resistance to marketing, and her scrupulous refusal to kludge up her art with paratext, come as salutary aberrations amid all the Hudson Yards hype. But Ms. Donnelly seems to have already accepted that the cultural world we have built over the train tracks may not have space for art like hers. JASON FARAGO "
5c6fba6f3a125f5075c0af74,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/22/arts/what-to-see-in-new-york-city-this-spring.html,"Broadway, Wagner’s “Ring,” the opening of the Shed: what our critics and writers are looking forward to this season. ‘TOOTSIE’ What’s wrong with musical comedy? Generally, the music. And the comedy. Which may be why most of the best musicals of the last decade — “Fun Home,” “Hamilton,” “The Band’s Visit” — have been serious indeed. The art of being funny on the beat is mostly a lost one. But David Yazbek, the songwriter behind the musical comedies “Dirty Rotten Scoundrels” and “The Full Monty,” maintains the magic. Even his score for “The Band’s Visit,” mostly drenched in melancholy, has moments of lyrical hilarity. Let’s just say “marrow” and “pharaoh” never thought of rhyming until he insisted. That’s the top reason (among several) I have high hopes for the stage version of “Tootsie,” arriving at the Marquis Theater on March 29. Based on the 1982 movie about an actor whose stalled career revives only when he pretends to be a woman, it offers both the size and sentiment a musical comedy, in any era, needs for liftoff. JESSE GREEN ‘OKLAHOMA!’ What’s likely to be the freshest, most revolutionary musical on Broadway this season is more than three-quarters of a century old. Its title is “Oklahoma!,” and, yes, that’s the same Rodgers and Hammerstein show about farmers, cowhands and frontier love that was first seen in New York in 1943. But the director Daniel Fish’s revitalizing interpretation, scheduled to open at the Circle in the Square Theater on April 7, asks theatergoers to look at a deeply familiar classic through the eyes of the 21st century. The songs, dialogue and characters remain almost entirely the same. But as it demonstrated during its sold-out run at St. Ann’s Warehouse in Brooklyn last year, Mr. Fish’s version finds provocative depths of darkness amid the prairie sunshine. BEN BRANTLEY ‘INK’ The British actor Bertie Carvel, who wore a dress for his Tony-nominated role as the terrifying schoolmistress Miss Trunchbull in the musical “Matilda” six years ago, is switching to neatly tailored trousers for his return to Broadway. But don’t expect him to be any less intimidating. In James Graham’s “Ink,” which opens in April at the Samuel J. Friedman Theater, Mr. Carvel will be portraying one Rupert Murdoch. And in this London hit about the tabloidization of British journalism, directed by Rupert Goold, any similarities between Mr. Carvel’s character and a certain Australian-born media mogul are definitely not coincidental. BEN BRANTLEY ‘WHAT THE CONSTITUTION MEANS TO ME’ Heidi Schreck’s play about invisible women and the 14th Amendment was electrifyingly topical when it ran Off Broadway last year, amid the national outcry over the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh. Sadly or fortuitously, “What the Constitution Means to Me” is even more urgent as it moves to Broadway, where performances begin on March 14. Its take on abortion as a protected liberty (and a personal turning point) comes smack up against now-Justice Kavanaugh, who signaled, in one of his first opinions, a willingness to reverse Roe v. Wade. But the play is deeper than its timeliness suggests. Though it uses the idea of debate as a touchstone — and ends, deliciously, with a live one — it’s really about how we come to question our most bedrock assumptions about the world. If that makes seeing it almost a civic duty, duty has rarely been so pleasurable. JESSE GREEN ‘THE LEHMAN TRILOGY’ Three Bavarian-born brothers who first set foot on American soil more than 150 years ago are returning to New York next month, accompanied by a centuries-spanning brood of their descendants. Their names are Henry, Emanuel and Mayer, and they — and their seemingly countless kin — will be reincarnated at the Park Avenue Armory in Stefano Massini’s “The Lehman Trilogy,” an epic tale of financial rise and ruin, directed by Sam Mendes. This three-hours-plus production features what is surely the largest cast of characters of any play in town. Yet they are embodied by a mere three, seemingly inexhaustible actors with the power to multiply themselves like amoebas: Simon Russell Beale, Ben Miles and Adam Godley. Though the story they tell — which begins and ends with the world-rocking bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008 — is one of entropy, the play in which they appear promises to be a resounding testament to the regenerative powers of theater. As befits a sprawling, globe-girdling story of historic transformation, “The Lehman Brothers” has an intricate, multinational pedigree. Mr. Massini’s chronicle of a dynasty begun by emigrants to the United States began life as an Italian radio play before making its stage debut in Paris (in French) in 2013. Its Italian premiere was at the fabled Piccolo Teatro in Milan two years later, when it ran a whopping five hours. Ben Power’s English-language adaptation opened at the National Theater in London last summer, overseen by Mr. Mendes, the very busy stage and film director whose gripping production of Jez Butterworth’s “The Ferryman” is a current hit on Broadway. Mr. Power pared Mr. Massini’s trilogy to a sleek and unexpectedly lyrical three hours (not counting two intermissions) to be performed almost entirely by three actors on an elegant but nearly empty rotating set (by the ever-inventive Es Devlin). Otherwise, empty is hardly a word to be applied to this interpretation, as I can attest from seeing it at the National last July. Mr. Beale, Mr. Miles and Mr. Godley fill the stage to repletion, as they assume the varied forms of the dynasty-founding Henry, Emanuel and Mayer — and all subsequent generations of Lehmans. And their friends, lovers, spouses, customers, rivals, ad infinitum, with a variety that continually astonishes. Unlike investors who lost their fortunes on Wall Street a decade ago, no one who leaves this encounter with the brothers Lehman is likely to walk away feeling poor. BEN BRANTLEY ‘MARYS SEACOLE’ Born in 1805 to a free Jamaican mother and a Scottish father, Mary Seacole grew up to become an international businesswoman and freelance nurse, crossing paths with soldiers, royalty and Florence Nightingale. That would be more than enough material for a straight-ahead bio-drama — but not, it seems, for the always surprising and formally ingenious Jackie Sibblies Drury, whose “Fairview” was one of last year’s best plays. In the deliberately plural “Marys Seacole,” playing through March 24 at LCT3’s Claire Tow Theater, everyone in the six-woman cast is a Mary — or a Merry, a Miriam, a Mamie or the like. The indispensable Quincy Tyler Bernstine appears as the historical Mrs. Seacole in this production directed by Lileana Blain-Cruz. The others, whose characters cross continents and time, help raise a central question of nursing even now: Who takes care of the people who take care of others? JESSE GREEN ‘WHITE NOISE’ No American playwright has contributed more to the churning and ever-evolving conversation about race in these United (and divided) States than Suzan-Lori Parks. This prodigiously imaginative writer, who won a Pulitzer Prize for “Topdog/Underdog,” has addressed the toxic legacy of slavery in a rich assortment of theatrical forms and languages, from the surrealism of her early “The America Play” to the Homeric chronicle “Father Comes Home From the Wars.” Now Ms. Parks is focusing her gaze on interracial friendships in the 21st century with the resonantly titled “White Noise,” which begins previews next month at her longtime home, the Public Theater. Oskar Eustis, the Public’s artistic director, oversees a four-member cast, led by Daveed Diggs (the original Marquis de Lafayette in “Hamilton”) as an African-American man forced to reconsider the depth and danger of the gap between black and white. BEN BRANTLEY ‘MRS. MURRAY’S MENAGERIE’ I’m not sure anyone could have imagined a duller setting for a play than a high school faculty meeting, yet in “Miles for Mary,” the theatrical collective called the Mad Ones turned the banality of the break room into a hilarious and ultimately galvanizing Off Broadway hit. As if to top themselves, the Mad Ones return this spring with “Mrs. Murray’s Menagerie,” set in (a) the 1970s; at (b) a focus group; for (c) a children’s television show. That is all we know, and all we need to know. Except that the Ars Nova production, which begins performances on March 26 at the Greenwich House Theater, features a cast of expertly light-touch farceurs under the direction of Lila Neugebauer, who made “Miles for Mary” so moving behind the laughs. If this is banality, let’s have more! JESSE GREEN THE ‘RING’ The Metropolitan Opera’s high-tech, low-energy production of Wagner’s four-opera “Ring,” which returns for three cycles this spring, has been notable mostly for its snafus. At its first performance — “Das Rheingold,” back in 2010 — the set’s massive array of seesaws malfunctioned near the end, spoiling the gods’ climactic ascent across a rainbow bridge. Another time, the Microsoft Windows logo flashed across the stage instead of the sophisticated projections that distinguish the cycle’s many locales. One performance of “Die Walküre” that was being broadcast live to cinemas worldwide was delayed nearly an hour because the “Machine,” as it became known, wouldn’t cooperate. And that’s not counting the loud creaks and whirs that accompanied its every move. But while the Met claims that the costly Machine — conceived by the production’s director, Robert Lepage — has been tamed, the technical troubles always struck me as distractions from the real problem. All of Mr. Lepage’s spending and innovation resulted in a cycle that was dull, and out of touch with Wagner’s intricately drawn characters and plot. The singers seemed genuinely undirected, lost in front of the set’s imposing mass; the production team was scrambling to make the effects work, but it appeared that relatively little attention had been given to the acting. There were no discernible relationships charted onstage, no drama, no attempt to transmit — let alone interpret for our time — complex themes of power, sacrifice and societal collapse. Indeed, though the set design meant that some singers spent long stretches in a kind of trough, the effects, while wonky, may have been the best part. At the beginning of “Das Rheingold,” bathed in blue light, the 20 enormous planks levitated in silence. Wagner’s long, low E flat began. Then, like the music, the machine began undulating — first slowly, then faster. It truly was the river Rhine. The opening storm of “Die Walküre” similarly came to life: We were in a sky full of dark, rushing clouds; then in the middle of a forest during a snowstorm; then inside a hut glowing with firelight. It was sweeping and evocative. A production crowded with visual stimulation, in which the singers seemed to be left to their own devices? This “Ring” reminded me, more than it probably intended to, of the Met’s hyper-realistic Franco Zeffirelli spectacles of the 1980s. Like Mr. Lepage, Mr. Zeffirelli creates grand spaces in which stick figures are moved around. The shows ignite when you have compelling performers and sink when you don’t. This revival — which Peter Gelb, the Met’s general manger, is mounting after many thought the Machine, last seen in 2013, would be mothballed for good — does indeed have some compelling casting. Christine Goerke, as Brünnhilde, promises more vocal confidence than Deborah Voigt had when the production was new; Greer Grimsley and Michael Volle will each make a capable, articulate Wotan; Philippe Jordan returns to the Met for the first time since 2007 to conduct. Things may well go more smoothly this time around. But will this yet be a Wagner we can believe in? ZACHARY WOOLFE ‘PRISONER OF THE STATE’ “How he mocked me,” a villainous official laments, explaining why he locked away the political prisoner he now wants killed. That chilling line rings out in “prisoner of the state,” the new David Lang opera that reimagines Beethoven’s only opera, “Fidelio”; the New York Philharmonic will give its premiere on June 6.Beethoven’s theme feels as resonant as ever in a country grappling with questions about mass incarceration; immigrants separated from their children at the border; whether the president is answerable to the law; and how inmates were quietly kept without heat or light for days in a federal jail in the middle of New York City. The opera, directed by Elkhanah Pulitzer, will serve as the finale of Jaap van Zweden’s first season as the Philharmonic’s music director, and he will conduct a cast that includes the moving bass-baritone Eric Owens. MICHAEL COOPER ECSTATIC MUSIC FESTIVAL Among its other skills, the Bang on a Can organization  is smart about fund-raising. By soliciting fans to help them commission new works, the collective ensures a reliably expanding repertory for its in-house chamber ensemble, the Bang on a Can All-Stars. The latest batch of these “People’s Commissioning Fund” pieces comes to the Ecstatic Music Festival at Merkin Concert Hall on March 6. Fresh music by Nicole Lizée and Pulitzer Prize-winner Henry Threadgill will share a bill with vintage works by Annie Gosfield and Glenn Branca, who died last year. The evening’s theme is music for dancing, which Mr. Threadgill has previously explored with his Society Situation Dance Band. If you can’t make it to the concert, you can tune in for a live webcast, on newsounds.org. SETH COLTER WALLS MITSUKO UCHIDA It’s easy to forget that the piano is a percussion instrument when it’s played by Mitsuko Uchida. She animates it with both symphonic might and enchanting lyricism — a perfect fit for the vast emotional range and singing melodies of Schubert. Ms. Uchida recorded one of the finest cycles of Schubert’ssonatas, and she has been revisiting portions, the late works, in a survey at Carnegie Hall. That comes to an end this spring, with two recitals on April 30 and May 4. Endings are very much part of both programs. They are almost stages of grief: The Sonata No. 20 in A (D. 959) contains an abruptly tumultuous passage, like a petulant tantrum, then the heart-rending Sonata No. 21 in B flat (D. 960) offers bittersweet acceptance. JOSHUA BARONE THE SHED The Shed has a modest name and enormous ambitions. Opening April 5, it’s the cultural component of the gigantic Hudson Yards development on the West Side of Manhattan: an eight-story structure that includes galleries; rehearsal space; a theater that can adapt to seated or standing-room events; and a shell that can enclose an adjacent plaza into a performance space. Its mandate is to commission and present world premieres of new and innovative works, and its artistic director and chief executive, Alex Poots, arrives after a decade as the artistic director of the Manchester International Festival in Britain and, in recent years, of the Park Avenue Armory in New York City. The Shed’s first full-scale offering celebrates the heritage and scope of African-American music. Over five nights from April 5-14, “Soundtrack of America” sets out to explore a “family tree” of American music, from spirituals to hip-hop, with a lineup of 25 young performers to bring out continuities and breakthroughs. “Soundtrack of America” arrives with unquestioned credentials. The series is conceived and directed by the filmmaker and video artist Steve McQueen, whose “12 Years a Slave” won the Oscar for best picture in 2014. His brain trust includes the illustrious producer Quincy Jones; the crate-digging hip-producer No I.D. (a.k.a. Dion Wilson); and the keyboardist Greg Phillinganes, who was Michael Jackson’s musical director and has worked with Stevie Wonder, Eric Clapton and Bruno Mars. The performers announced so far — five each night — include 2019 Grammy winners like Fantastic Negrito and PJ Morton; the genre-meshing New Orleans band Tank and the Bangas; Judith Hill, who sang backup for Prince and Michael Jackson, among many others; the rapper and singer Smino; the eerily idiosyncratic, falsetto-loving songwriters Moses Sumney and serpentwithfeet; and Jon Batiste, who leads the band Stay Human on “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.” The African-American musical family tree gives them a boundless source of potential material. The Shed has also announced another major musical production, May 6-June 1: a premiere from Björk, who introduced her “Biophilia” in 2011 at the Manchester International Festival. Björk describes it as “my most elaborate stage concert yet, where the acoustic and digital will shake hands”; her backup includes a seven-woman Icelandic flute ensemble. The title, promisingly, is “Cornucopia.” JON PARELES ROBYN A Robyn show is a bit different from other pop concerts. It isn’t an over-the-top spectacle of rotating set pieces and wardrobe changes, or a showcase of vocal acrobatics and choreographed backup dancers. It is sweaty and straight-up — pop church and pop group therapy, a place for fans of the Swedish singer and songwriter, who first hit the United States in the late 1990s, to experience Robyn’s transcendent, deeply addictive music beside her. From February to April, including a stop at Madison Square Garden in New York on March 8, she’s touring to support “Honey,” her first full album in eight years, which came after a half-decade of psychoanalysis and a series of personal challenges. Her loyal listeners have been anxiously waiting to share their euphoria and pain. CARYN GANZ MASSIVE ATTACK In 1998, the British trip-hop trio Massive Attack unleashed its third album, “Mezzanine,” a brooding, sensual, chilly, paranoid record of sputtering grooves and gauzy atmospherics that wound its way into popular culture everywhere, from “The Matrix” to the TV show “House.” The band has released two more albums in the 21 years since, but the gravitational pull of “Mezzanine” remains potent, and the group — now a duo consisting of Robert del Naja (known as 3D) and Grant Marshall (Daddy G) — is playing a series of shows marking its (belated) 20th anniversary. The brief tour, which hits Boston on March 14 and wraps in San Diego on April 2, promises to be an enveloping, dynamic visual extravaganza. CARYN GANZ BIG EARS FESTIVAL The Big Ears Festival in Knoxville, Tenn., has become a point of pilgrimage for all sorts of experimental listeners: Indie classical, avant-garde jazz, ambient electronic music and post-rock are all well accounted for here. The festival will celebrate its 10th anniversary, March 21-24, overtaking nearly a dozen spaces across the city’s downtown. All are within walking distance of each other, but each is comfortable and acoustically sound enough that you’ll forget what you’re missing a few doors down. This year’s acts range from the virtuoso vocalist Theo Bleckmann (paying tribute to Kate Bush) to the radical improvisers in the Art Ensemble of Chicago to the psychedelic, soulful explorations of the rock band Spiritualized. Big Ears 2019 doubles as a 50th-anniversary celebration of ECM Records; the influential label will present 20 performances throughout the festival, featuring artists from across its eclectic roster. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO MERCE CUNNINGHAM Merce Cunningham, that marvel of a choreographer, understood that dancing meant different things to different people. In the book “Merce Cunningham: Fifty Years,” he is quoted as saying: “What to some is splendid entertainment, to others is merely tedium and fidgets; what to some seems barren, to others is the very essence of the heroic.” His entire career was a heroic act of vision and persistence. One of the most revered and revolutionary choreographers of the 20th century, Cunningham was a rule breaker who collaborated deeply with many artists, including his life partner, the composer John Cage. Their experiments involved allowing music and dance to exist separately, as well as introducing the concept of chance as a creative device. In 2019, the year of his centennial, Cunningham — who died at 90 in 2009 — is being celebrated all over the world with performances, workshops, talks, screenings and more. “The ideas are still very much alive and relevant and exciting and creative,” Ken Tabachnick, the executive director of the Merce Cunningham Trust, said. “Every time I see something again, I’m just amazed at how relevant it is. It could have been made yesterday.” That is one of the important points that Mr. Tabachnick and Trevor Carlson — a trustee and the producer of the Trust’s celebration of the centennial — hope to impart with the multi-tentacled celebration. Events continue all year and are updated on the Trust’s website, but one highlight is just around the corner: “Night of 100 Solos: A Centennial Event,” on April 16, Cunningham’s birthday. Three cities — London (at the Barbican), New York (at the Brooklyn Academy of Music) and Los Angeles (at the Center for the Art of Performance at U.C.L.A.) — will stage Events, the name that Cunningham gave to performances that featured fragments of works from his repertory. (Events date to 1964.) “We’re looking to continue Merce’s tradition of doing things that hadn’t been done before,” Mr. Carlson said. “We wanted to make the largest Event ever made.” In the spirit of the new, none of the performers — including the New York City Ballet principal Sara Mearns, the Martha Graham dancer PeiJu Chien-Pott and the choreographers Kyle Abraham and Vicky Shick — are former Cunningham dancers. Those dancers are involved, however, in staging the solos. (Cunningham’s company, according to his wishes, disbanded after his death and a legacy tour.) “We wanted to signal that the Cunningham legacy has a future for people who never experienced Cunningham,” Mr. Tabachnick said. “So you’ll see ballet dancers, you’ll see dancers who are not classically or rigorously trained, you’ll see younger dancers and older dancers. And that is to show the diversity and breadth of the possibilities for the legacy.” Events are piling up, and include a Cunningham celebration at the Joyce Theater (April 17-21) featuring Compagnie CNDC-Angers/Robert Swinston, Ballet West and the Washington Ballet. Amid the excitement, Mr. Carlson has a problem. It’s a good one. “It’s wild, but I’m afraid we might have to expand the amount of time of the centennial in order to include everyone who wants to be included,” he said. “I think we’re going to see ourselves extending to what would have been Merce’s 101st birthday.” GIA KOURLAS DANCE THEATER OF HARLEM Dance Theater of Harlem has never been just another ballet troupe. It was created, in 1969, as a hopeful reaction to hope-crushing circumstances. The assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was among the spurs to action, but the principal problem in need of addressing was longstanding and continuing: the dearth of opportunities for ballet dancers who were not white. “You can’t do this,” these dancers were told by the world in many ways. Dance Theater of Harlem told them they could, and then proved it to the world. The survival of this institution for 50 years deserves a big celebration. With the death of its trailblazing founding director, Arthur Mitchell, in September, the anniversary festivities have also become memorials. In recent decades the company has valiantly struggled with diminished funds, and its New York season at City Center (April 10, 12-13) isn’t as grand as one might wish. Such signatures pieces as “Agon,” “Firebird” and “Creole Giselle” return only in excerpts. But it’s appropriate that one of Mr. Mitchell’s works (“Tones”) is being revived, and Robert Garland, the troupe’s underrecognized resident choreographer, is presenting a premiere. However these turn out, the occasion is major. BRIAN SEIBERT PAM TANOWITZ When Emma Portner, known for her video dances, withdrew from a New York City Ballet commission, the company turned to Pam Tanowitz. The circumstances are hardly ideal, but here’s a one-word reaction: Finally. Ms. Tanowitz, whose new ballet will be unveiled at the company’s spring gala on May 2, has been making dances since 1992. Celebrated for her ability to mix classical and contemporary vocabulary within a framework of formal structures, she will expand a piece set to Bartok’s String Quartet No. 5 that she created during a choreographic workshop at American Ballet Theater in 2017. It’s not the prolific Ms. Tanowitz’s only new dance this season: In April, she presents a work at the Martha Graham Dance Company; another commission, from Paul Taylor American Modern Dance, will have its premiere at the Orchestra of St. Luke’s Bach Festival in June, the same month she presents a new work for her company and the City Ballet dancers Sara Mearns and Taylor Stanley at the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council’s River to River Festival. And on March 22, she will land in Cleveland to stage a site-specific work at Pilgrim Congregational Church for her company along with local dancers. “Recital #1 (five small dances for Cleveland)” is an experiment: She’s looking at ways to reimagine her repertory. GIA KOURLAS LIGIA LEWIS Every so often, New Yorkers catch a glimpse of the choreographer Ligia Lewis, who spends much of her time in Berlin. Her brief visits, which in recent years have been high points of the American Realness festival, are not to be missed. Capping the refusal-themed “No Series” at Performance Space New York, Ms. Lewis will present “minor matter” and “Water Will (in Melody),” two parts of a triptych that began in 2014 with the spare and piercing “Sorrow Swag.” Each work in the trilogy corresponds to a color, teasing out its associations: blue, red and white. (“Sorrow Swag” featured a lone male performer enveloped in blue light.) First seen in New York at Abrons Arts Center, where three indefatigable dancers (Ms. Lewis included) seemed almost to topple the theater walls, “minor matter” (red) returns May 21-22. Exploring the space between love and rage — and the relationship between blackness and the black-box theater — it stages a kind of tangled collective struggle, in which the people onstage could be conspiring with or against one another, maybe both at once. The final part, “Water Will (in Melody),” May 28-29, flirts with melodrama and catastrophe, which sounds like a fitting end. SIOBHAN BURKE "
