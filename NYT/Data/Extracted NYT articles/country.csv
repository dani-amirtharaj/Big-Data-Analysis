For those affluent people who feel that a great drive involves a Porsche instead of a tee time, a different breed of country club is eager to cater to their hobby. In a 2017 piece for Automotive News, Robert A. Lutz, the outspoken retired auto executive, lamented the inevitability of driverless cars. “Automotive sport — using the cars for fun — will survive, just not on public highways,” he said. “It will survive in country clubs such as Monticello in New York and Autobahn in Joliet, Ill. It will be the well-to-do, to the amazement of all their friends, who still know how to drive and who will teach their kids how to drive.” The precision of this forecast will take time to establish, but well-to-do collectors do in fact have some deluxe clubs where they can store and drive their cars. Monticello Motor Club in Sullivan County, N.Y., is indeed a country club. Founded in 2008, it has more than 470 members who paid an initiation fee from $60,000 to $95,000, with annual dues of $5,900 to $13,900. Family and corporate memberships for five are $135,000 with dues of $20,700. It’s not for the light of pocketbook. Membership buys access to Monticello’s 4.1-mile racetrack, a karting track and off-road trails. A professional racing instructor — like a country club’s golf pro — is on hand to sharpen skills. The membership includes many families, and children as young as 13 can learn to drive mildly tuned racecars. The club’s website says this makes them better licensed drivers. Gold members get more track time and other perks, including garage rental priority. A service center provides repair and tuning of members’ automobiles. Club activity centers on amateur competition on the racetrack. A five-event racing series concludes with one member being named champion. A clubhouse at trackside offers dining, bar service, locker rooms and more. A helipad is provided for those who like to drop in after a hard day in the corporate boardroom. Lisa and Greg Coakley and their children, Brooke and Brent, are Monticello members and racers. Mr. Coakley is a Porsche Club of America national champion, and he and his wife teamed up to win the Monticello 90-minute enduro last year in their twin Porsche Caymans. That would be quite an achievement for any couple, but for the Coakleys it’s remarkable. Mr. Coakley was born with cystic fibrosis — a condition that is often fatal — and received a double lung transplant in 2013. “Greg’s medical challenges and the gift of life we experienced changed our perspective,” Mrs. Coakley said. “We now live without limits.” She added: “Like the transplant procedure, racing requires a devoted team. In both instances, we’ve been supported by the best of the best.” The children get track time as well. Brooke, 15, drove a Spec Miata for three years and will race a Mazda in Global MX-5 Cup competition this year. Brent has been driving karts but is now 13 and will get behind the wheel of a Spec Miata. The Coakleys travel to the club from the Jersey Shore, but for those who wish to visit with minimal travel, nearby Motor Club Estates offers lavish homes with attached garages that store up to 20 cars. The developer, Michael Watkins, said that many were equipped with lifts and that one had a paint booth and machine shop. A private road takes residents to Monticello. Mr. Watkins, a member, races a Spec Miata and was 2018 club champion. “Monticello is a spectacular place with a country club atmosphere,” he said. The owners, Ari Straus and Paul Queally, he added, “are terrific people who love motorsports and race with us.” While Monticello is among the most expensive of this new breed of automotive country clubs, others are positioned to attract those of slightly more modest means. Just outside Detroit is M1 Concourse, an 87-acre playground for car lovers. Private garages, from 507 to 4,800 square feet, are the main attraction. Sold as deeded condominiums, they’re well insulated, protected with sprinkler systems and wired for cable television and high-speed internet. The garage condos are delivered in basic form, but most owners elaborately finish and equip them. Many include a loft above the garage space with a lounge and a kitchen. Most offer a view of M1’s private racetrack. To gain access to the track, garage condominium owners must join the Motorsports Club. The initiation fee is $20,000, and annual dues are $4,000. Bill Golling owns one of the larger garage condos, and it’s equipped to serve as a home away from home, with storage for 10 of his 25 automobiles, a kitchen, an entertaining area and more. Mr. Golling owns several Fiat Chrysler dealerships, so his cars are largely from that automotive group. Among those garaged at M1 are Vipers, an Alfa Romeo and an 840-horsepower Dodge Demon. Although he has plenty of power on tap and is a Motorsports Club member, Mr. Golling doesn’t drive on the track. He’s more into socializing. “It’s a car community,” he said. “I know my M1 neighbors, and we get together socially. At Halloween, we did ‘trunk or treat’ at the garages for the kids. “I’ve loved cars all my life, so it’s great to be part of a motorsports community, a place where I can play with my hobby and visit friends,” he added. “I have a great view of the track from my garage and can watch all that is going on.” The 1.5-mile racetrack winds its way past the garages and around the site. While it lacks the width and runoffs necessary for wheel-to-wheel racing, M1 stages a race-the-clock event every year. Brad Oleshansky, a co-owner and founder of M1 Concourse, said: “My mission was to have my own garage, something that could be used as a man cave in a community of like-minded enthusiasts. Driving clubs are a trend, and they’ll continue to grow.” Automotive country clubs are at least a mini trend, and they’ve sprung up in other areas where there’s a strong automotive community as well as the right space. In Dawsonville, Ga., the Atlanta Motorsports Park says it is a “motorsports club and motorsports playground where family, friends and businesses come together to share and celebrate their passion for driving.” And drive they do. The facility includes a 16-turn, two-mile road course by Hermann Tilke, a racetrack designer who has built Formula One tracks. The circuit here includes an F1 caution light system and steep elevation changes. Driver training is offered to prepare members for competition. Eight club races for Spec Miatas, BMW E30s and Radical sports cars were held in 2018. A karting circuit provides tamer fun with events open to anyone over 5 years old. Off-road trails provide additional motorized entertainment. Like M1 Concourse and Monticello, the Atlanta park offers luxury garages in various sizes and configurations. They can be purchased finished, or members can design their unit. A variety of membership packages are offered. Initiation fees range from $10,000 to $47,500. Access fees and monthly dues apply at some levels. Mark Basso, the founder and chief executive of the Autobahn Country Club in Illinois, said: “My parents belonged to a golf club. As a young car guy, I wondered why there was nothing like that for people like me.” In the 1990s Mr. Basso decided to do something about it and developed a business plan for what would become the nation’s first purpose-built motorsports country club. After years of searching for a site and a community that would welcome the venture, he opened Autobahn in 2005. About 45 miles southwest of downtown Chicago and with commercial neighbors, it has prospered. Autobahn’s main attraction is a 3.56-mile track that can be subdivided into 2.1-mile and 1.5-mile circuits. A variety of racing series provide wheel-to-wheel fun. Also available are off-road trails and a roughly half-mile kart track. Instructors provide driving lessons, and a service center offers racecar maintenance, repair, tuning and more. Vehicle storage is available in garage condominiums that store six cars on a 1,250-square-foot first floor. A second floor features bedrooms and a party room. Private lots of one-third of an acre surround the site. There, members have built what Mr. Basso calls garage mahals — elaborate structures that combine living quarters and garages. One is owned by Bobby Rahal, the former race car driver. Like other automotive country clubs, Autobahn offers a range of social activities. Membership comes at a price, although it is more modest than at some other clubs. The initiation fee is $40,000, and annual dues are $5,250. Social memberships that don’t include full access to track activities are offered for $4,200 a year with no initiation fee. "
5cafbd0149f0eacbf1f831dc,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/obituaries/earl-thomas-conley-dead.html,"NASHVILLE — Earl Thomas Conley, one of the most popular and prolific country singers of the 1980s, died here on Wednesday. He was 77. Carole Scates, his partner for more than 20 years, said the cause was cerebral atrophy. Mr. Conley had 24 Top 10 country singles in the ’80s, several of which he wrote or co-wrote, including 18 that reached No. 1. Only two artists that decade topped the country charts more times than he did: the vocal group Alabama, which had 27 No. 1 singles, and the singer Ronnie Milsap, who had 23. All but one of Mr. Conley’s No. 1 hits were recorded for RCA, starting with “Somewhere Between Right and Wrong” in 1982. Many of Mr. Conley’s songs, among them “Holding Her and Loving You” and “Don’t Make It Easy for Me,” both No. 1 hits, plumbed the complexity of romantic relationships. Abounding with sincerity, his rich, smoky baritone was well suited to his material, which appealed primarily to adult audiences, much like the vintage country and soul music of the 1960s and ’70s. Mr. Conley’s affinity for soul music was evident on many of his recordings, maybe nowhere as much as on “Too Many Times,” a 1986 duet with Anita Pointer of the Grammy Award-winning Pointer Sisters. That record reached No. 2 on the country chart and earned Mr. Conley an invitation, rare for a country artist, to perform the song with Ms. Pointer on the R&B-themed television show “Soul Train.” “There was such soul in everything he did,” Joe Galante, who was chief executive of RCA Nashville from 1982 to 1990, said in an interview with The Daily Tennessean. “You always talk about finding something unique,” Mr. Galante continued. “His voice certainly was that.” Mr. Conley placed an average of two singles a year on the country charts in the 1980s, on his way to becoming an inspiration to future country hitmakers like Randy Travis and Blake Shelton. By the early ’90s, with the rise of new stars like Garth Brooks and Shania Twain, sales of Mr. Conley’s records had dropped, and he received less and less airplay, prompting him to take an extended break from touring and recording. He resurfaced again in 1998, and, though he never achieved the kind of success he had in the ’80s, he was active into this decade. Earl Thomas Conley, the third of eight children, was born on Oct. 17, 1941, in Portsmouth, Ohio, a small town across the Ohio River from Kentucky, to Ruth (Davis) and Arthur Conley. When his father lost his job with the railroad, Earl, then 14, moved in with one of his older sisters. He was offered a scholarship to attend art school but opted instead to join the Army, where he first began writing songs and singing in public. After his discharge, Mr. Conley worked for the railroad and in steel mills while traveling to and from Ohio and Nashville to write songs with the producer Dick Heard. Their song “Smokey Mountain Memories” became a Top 40 country hit for the honky-tonk singer Mel Street in 1975. The next year Conway Twitty had a No. 1 country hit with Mr. Conley’s “This Time I’ve Hurt Her More Than She Loves Me.” In 1981, after an unproductive stint recording for Warner Bros. Records, Mr. Conley had his first No. 1 hit, a song he wrote called “Fire & Smoke,” released on the independent Sunbird label. In addition to Ms. Scates, Mr. Conley is survived by his brothers, Fred and Steve; his sisters, Ronda Hodges and Becky Miller; a son, Ty, and a daughter, Amy Edmisten, from his marriage to Sandra Smith, which ended in divorce; two younger daughters, Kat Scates and Erinn Scates; and five grandchildren. A versatile stylist, Mr. Conley was as much at home with the Appalachian music of his childhood as with rock- and soul-inflected arrangements. He recorded tradition-steeped duets with Emmylou Harris (“We Believe in Happy Endings”) and Keith Whitley (“Brotherly Love”). “My stuff started with bluegrass music,” Mr. Conley once explained in an interview. “That’s what inspired me, the people that came out of those hills in West Virginia and Kentucky. And, of course, Hank Williams Sr. down in Alabama. “I was born in ’41, and I was raised up on that early stuff,” he went on. “Coming out of those mountains, there’s a different soul and a different feeling and a whole different deal than what it would be like to come from the city.” "
5cacb50949f0eacbf1f81d89,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/09/arts/music/lil-nas-x-old-town-road.html,"A wealth of internet memes plus a viral controversy over race and the sanctity of country music have led to a distinctly 21st century No. 1 song: Lil Nas X’s “Old Town Road,” a sticky genre hybrid that has been the talk of social networks and the music industry alike for weeks. The track, which clocks in at only one minute and 53 seconds, dethroned “7 Rings” by Ariana Grande for the top spot on the industry-standard Hot 100 singles chart, Billboard announced on Monday night. The chart is determined by weighing a combination of digital streams, radio airplay and digital sales data in the United States. “Old Town Road” depended largely on streaming, totaling nearly 47 million plays — over 10 million more than its closest competitor — in the last week of chart eligibility, which ended Friday. The song was also downloaded 22,000 times and received an increase in radio play as it became a cause célèbre this month. Buzz began to grow when “Old Town Road,” which the Atlanta rapper Lil Nas X described as country-trap, arrived on three charts simultaneously: the Hot 100, Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot Country Songs. With silly lyrics delivered in an exaggerated drawl (“cowboy hat from Gucci/Wrangler on my booty”), the track had become an online sensation through memes on social apps like TikTok, where young people made short country-themed videos set to the song. But Billboard soon removed “Old Town Road” from the country chart, calling its initial inclusion a mistake because the song “does not embrace enough elements of today’s country music.” (The song’s beat samples an instrumental number by Nine Inch Nails, which includes a plucked banjo melody.) Many critics of the decision questioned whether race was a factor, and noted modern country’s frequent use of rapping and digital drum sounds from hip-hop. In a savvy chess move, Lil Nas X, who signed to Columbia Records amid the song’s rise, released a remix on Friday featuring the veteran country singer Billy Ray Cyrus, who argued for it to be embraced by the Nashville establishment. Billboard addressed its handling of the song in a statement on Friday, saying that the company would “continue to monitor how it is marketed and how fans respond.” It added: “Our initial decision to remove ‘Old Town Road’ from the Hot Country Songs chart could be revisited as these factors evolve.” (Because of its release date, numbers for the remix will be counted toward the position of “Old Town Road” on next week’s Billboard charts. On Tuesday, the rapper Young Thug also teased a remix.) For Lil Nas X, who turned 20 on Tuesday, the strange trip to No. 1 was well worth it. Regardless of any negativity, he posted on Twitter, “i’m going down in history.” "
5caf8a8249f0eacbf1f82ff8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/arts/music/lil-nas-x-old-town-road-country-rap.html,"Over the last few weeks, “Old Town Road” — a strutting and lightheartedly comedic country-rap tune by the previously unknown 20-year-old rapper Lil Nas X — has lived an improbable number of lives. It began as a Hail Mary pass by a college dropout hoping music might save him from having to go back to school. But in the way that the internet can rapidly make and remake something, morphing meaning in real time, Lil Nas X’s track became something different almost every few days on its path from SoundCloud obscurity to pop ubiquity: a savvy troll, a manipulator of streaming algorithms, a meme theme, a battering ram to genre barriers, a trigger of music-biz discord, a David suffering at the hands of Goliath, a sociocultural rallying point, and eventually, a site of cross-cultural kumbaya. [Listen to a history of country-rap in 29 songs.] And now, it’s likely to be one of the most emblematic songs of the year: On April 8, “Old Town Road” became the No. 1 song in the country, capping a startling ascent that demonstrates what can happen when viral engineering meets lightning-rod controversy meets the pop uncanny. For its first 25 seconds, “Old Town Road” could be any other rural lament, a lonely howl delivered over a plucked ukulele. It’s only when the trap drums kick in and the vocals change from singing to quasi-ironic rapping that the song’s true intentions come to the fore. It’s a genre-hybrid exercise — a hip-hop song with country-themed subject matter, partly rapped and partly sung in an exaggerated honky-tonk accent — and also a comedy sketch. The way Lil Nas X overaccentuates his vowels and makes them wobble is a caricature of stoic drawl, and when he raps “cowboy hat from Gucci, Wrangler on my booty,” it’s both confident boast and funny fantasy. It’s also a neat distillation of how genre is currently lived in American pop music: fluidly, with styles and ideas up for grabs by creators and easily slipped on and off by listeners, with varying degrees of sincerity. Pop, more than ever, is an identity playground. [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] But the particular alchemy of “Old Town Road” also taps something deeper: more than two decades of dialogue between country music and hip-hop, genres that have been slowly but consistently finding common heritage, swapping structural elements and taking comfort in each other’s sounds. But the industry’s gatekeepers are less interested in this mutability. For decades, Nashville has essentially framed and marketed the rural experience as white — despite and in defiance of the deep black roots of country music. So when an artist like Lil Nas X — who is black, and raps, and is from Atlanta, with no ties to the country music business — lays claim to rural aesthetics, even in a way that’s partly tongue in cheek, it causes real disruption. In late March, “Old Town Road” appeared on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart before it was removed for being deemed insufficiently country, causing a furor. But resistance led to embrace: a remix of the song featuring Billy Ray Cyrus, which in turn has been played by some country radio stations, which helped the song land on Billboard’s Country Airplay chart. “Old Town Road” — the original or the remix — is by no means the first country-rap crossover. There have been collaborations across genre lines, like Nelly and Tim McGraw’s “Over and Over”; songs in which country singers rap, like Jason Aldean’s “Dirt Road Anthem” and Blake Shelton’s “Boys ’Round Here”; and performances that are fully genre flexible, like Sam Hunt’s “Take Your Time.” And hip-hop has flirted with country signifiers on and off since the 1980s, whether it was the fringe-outfitted rapper Cowboy from the Furious Five, or Kool Moe Dee’s — and later, Will Smith’s — excursion to the “Wild Wild West.” By the 1990s, Southern rap was flourishing, providing a platform for ideas, accents and sounds that weren’t part of hip-hop from the coasts. Crooked Lettaz from Mississippi, 8Ball & MJG from Tennessee, UGK from Texas and many more emphasized drawling flows and production that leaned toward Southern soul and sometimes blues. Around the turn of the century, a pair of young white rappers, Bubba Sparxxx and Colt Ford, were beginning to work with Shannon Houchins, a producer in the Atlanta rap innovator Jermaine Dupri’s camp. Houchins would go on to produce most of “Dark Days, Bright Nights,” Sparxxx’s independent debut album, which got him signed to the major label Interscope and partnered with the producer Timbaland, who steered country-rap to its first big breakthrough moment: Sparxxx’s single “Ugly,” a hip-hop and pop hit with a video that included a pig sty and a tractor race, and went to No. 15 on the Billboard Hot 100. Sparxxx’s follow-up album, “Deliverance,” was a stunning and elegant cross-genre statement radically unlike anything that had preceded it. It made less of a broad impact, but in the wake of Sparxxx’s innovations came a wave of artists who effectively identified as country rappers focused on rural storytelling and signifiers — growing up far from cities, partying at mud bogs and so on. The seeds were also planted for what was to be Nashville’s first extended flirtation with hip-hop. Kid Rock, an early white rapper, remade himself as a country-rock rapper-singer. Tim McGraw partnered with Nelly on “Over and Over,” a road ballad that went to No. 3 on the Hot 100 in 2004. Kenny Rogers collaborated with both Wyclef Jean and Coolio. Even Willie Nelson appeared on a hip-hop song. And in Nashville, the MuzikMafia emerged, a polyglot group of performers that included the singing duo Big & Rich and the rapper Cowboy Troy, who collaborated on several songs, including the single “I Play Chicken With the Train,” which in 2005 became the first country-rap song to land on the Billboard Country Songs chart. These were outliers, or novelties — brief successes that Nashville tolerated but didn’t wholeheartedly embrace. But at around the same time, Houchins teamed up with Ford to form Average Joes Entertainment, a record label devoted to the intersection of country and rap centered on white rural experiences, with a growing stable of burly gool-ol’-boy rappers — “hick-hop,” it was occasionally called — operating largely outside the country music mainstream, though Ford regularly collaborated with the genre’s stars. [A godfather of country-rap on his 2000s hits and Lil Nas X.] By the early 2010s, Nashville was in search of raw energy. The music became more rural, rougher at the edges and more willing to flaunt a range of influences. These younger singers — Jason Aldean, Luke Bryan — often made it plain that hip-hop was as much of their musical heritage as country or Southern rock. That lineage was cemented when, in 2010, Aldean covered “Dirt Road Anthem,” a song originally recorded by Ford and Brantley Gilbert; his version went to No 1. on the country chart and No. 7 on the Hot 100. It opened the floodgates — Blake Shelton rapped a little, Bryan danced to hip-hop songs onstage, the duo Florida Georgia Line built a career on importing just the faintest hint of hip-hop percussion and slang. Their song “Cruise” became one of the biggest hits of 2013, bolstered by a remix featuring, who else, Nelly. That there’s a splash of hip-hop coursing through country (its male performers, at least) is now fundamentally accepted, but always with the country performer — and the country music business — in control of just how much. Nothing, though, is immune from the force and urgency of the meme economy, and Lil Nas X has demonstrated himself to be a master of how to pachinko his way from the margins to the mainstream. “Old Town Road” began on SoundCloud, where he tagged it as country to avoid competing with the hip-hop heavyweights that dominate the platform. Once it began to get noticed, he pushed it heavily on TikTok, the short-performance-clip app, where it was the soundtrack to thousands of videos. The track also arrived at a fortuitous moment — on the heels of a trickle of Western aesthetics into the high-style universe over the last couple of years, and also following the success of stylistically diverse country performers like Kacey Musgraves, who have demonstrated that a country musician can be a beacon of cool far outside the genre’s walls. Even Kanye West recently took to the countryside, unveiling his last album at a Wyoming cowboy ranch. In another moment, the aesthetic choices of “Old Town Road” might have been perceived as pure kitsch, but now they are kitsch with a side of tastemaker. And though the removal of the song from the country chart reflected an initial resentment, the mood soon switched. Some country singers said they found “Old Town Road” to be country, or country enough. They didn’t want to be on the wrong side of cool. Billy Ray Cyrus, who joined the song’s remix, is not a country insider at the peak of his powers, but he’s still a performer with a great deal of resonance within Nashville thanks to his 1992 pop-country crossover smash “Achy Breaky Heart.” Cyrus’s “Old Town Road” verse is pure glitz, a blend of hip-hop braggadocio and country-boy-in-the-big-city awe: “Spent a lot of money on my brand-new guitar/Baby’s got a habit, diamond rings and Fendi sports bras/Ridin’ down Rodeo in my Maserati sports car.” The performance is effortless, showing a version of country music that’s cosmopolitan, flexible and self-aware. Whether Cyrus’s co-sign will be enough for the industry side of Nashville to embrace “Old Town Road” remains to be seen. That’s because, when it comes to charts and common practices, country isn’t a genre or a set of sounds as much as it is an oligarchy, the product of a limited number of record labels; a media environment that relies heavily on radio (with programmers who can lack imagination, as female country performers have long known); and a profound bottleneck in terms of new talent and new ideas. (To be fair, country is not alone in this: In 2012, the K-pop novelty star Psy went to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Rap Songs chart with “Gangnam Style,” which was — and remains — one of the biggest viral YouTube songs in history, but was by no means a rap song in the American context.) Nashville’s initial resistance suggests some unfortunate things about country as a genre: that it might not be able to make fun of itself; that it might look askance at outsiders, especially black performers; that it understands itself only through the lens of protecting its central ideology, and not as an omnivorous sound in dialogue with the rest of pop, and the rest of America. Country music is preoccupied with borders, and it treats each new incursion as an opportunity for identity crisis. It’s a wild contrast with contemporary hip-hop, which understands itself as music that borrows widely, and experiments with glee. But perhaps the greatest indictment of how the country music leadership handled “Old Town Road” comes from a cursory listen to some other songs on the chart. Take “Look What God Gave Her,” the new single by Thomas Rhett, perhaps the ur-country gentleman of the last few years. It’s a soft soul song with a faint disco undertow, nothing country about it beyond the perceived affiliation of the performer. Elsewhere there are soft-rock ballads and R&B songs, none of them subject to anything like the skepticism that has greeted Lil Nas X, whose reference points might in fact be more classically country (even if refracted through a kitsch lens). Which means that the Lil Nas X controversy boils down to a conversation about who is entitled to lay public claim to Southern tropes that country music believes it has monopolized (but in truth, has been less and less reliant on in recent years). That it’s happening at a moment featuring more black country music performers than any in recent memory — Darius Rucker, Kane Brown, Jimmie Allen, Mickey Guyton and many more — is especially discouraging. On its own terms, “Old Town Road” has been a wild success. And when it comes the music business’s terms, well, that’s being reverse engineered. Following the Cyrus remix, Lil Nas X teased another with Young Thug. In truth, “Old Town Road” isn’t quite fully country or hip-hop, at least not in the ways those genres taxonomize themselves. It’s something far more slippery, slithering between the two spaces and arriving at pop novelty. This is where songs that have been disowned by their ostensible homes but provide uncomplicated pleasure often land — embraced widely even as they’re kept at arms length locally. But it is too potent to remain that way. It certainly won’t be long before some country singers incorporate it into their live sets. Country stations are beginning to play the song, which serves as a kind of proxy for acceptance. And indeed, Billboard recently announced that it might revisit its decision to include “Old Town Road” on its main country chart — after all, country is as country allows itself to be. "
5ca78c2b49f0eacbf1f81370,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/05/business/media/lil-nas-x-billy-ray-cyrus-billboard.html,"Booming beats. A twanging banjo. Is this country music? When Lil Nas X, a young black hip-hop artist from Atlanta, created the surprise hit “Old Town Road,” he did not imagine that it would end up at the center of a debate on race, the Nashville establishment and musical genres. The track marries a beat familiar to hip-hop fans with acoustic sounds and lyrics filled with cowboy imagery. Lil Nas X had no record deal when he made it, and the song bubbled up on the internet before it made three different Billboard charts: the Hot 100, Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot Country Songs. Once it was a success, Billboard removed it from its country chart. On Friday, in what seemed to be a dare to Billboard and Nashville, Lil Nas X released a new version of the song that included the 1990s country star Billy Ray Cyrus as a featured vocalist. Was it country enough for them now? When Billboard banished “Old Town Road” from the country chart, it issued a statement to Rolling Stone claiming the song “does not embrace enough elements of today’s country music to chart in its current version.” With Mr. Cyrus along for the ride, it is possible that country radio stations who ignored it will start playing it. [Listen: Lil Nas X and the long history of country-rap.] Billboard’s decision to drop the song from Hot Country Songs prompted a debate about race and country music itself. White Nashville artists, like Florida Georgia Line and Sam Hunt, have used hip-hop-influenced beats and production techniques for years. Do those performers have more leeway than Lil Nas X? Shane Morris, a former record label executive in Nashville, thinks so. “They said there were compositional problems,” Mr. Morris said of Billboard’s chartmakers, “because they didn’t know how to justify it any other way without sounding completely racist.” Charles Hughes, the director of the Lynne & Henry Turley Memphis Center at Rhodes College, called Billboard’s decision “a bad move,” saying it perpetuated a longstanding racial tension in black music. “Black artists have been influential in country a long, long way back,” Mr. Hughes said, “but country has rewarded white artists that have taken advantage of those influences, without giving black artists the same opportunities.” The rejection of “Old Town Road” by the country establishment, in Mr. Hughes’s view, echoed a time when country radio stations ignored Ray Charles’s groundbreaking 1962 album, “Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music.” Lil Nas X, whose real name is Montero Hill, said he wrote “Old Town Road” last fall, after staying with his sister while avoiding his parents as a college dropout. When his sister finally sent him on his way, he imagined his future. “I felt like a loner cowboy,” he said. “I wanted to take my horse to the Old Town Road and run away. The horse is like a car. The Old Town Road, it’s like a path to success. In the first verse, I pack up, ready to go.” He posted the song online in December along with an observation: “country music is evolving.” It soon became a sensation on TikTok, an app that allows users to make and share short music videos. Young people made video shorts of themselves dressing up in cowboy gear, using the song as a soundtrack. By March, Lil Nas X had nailed down the deal with Columbia. In an interview on Friday, he sidestepped questions about being dropped from the country chart. “I’m still in Billboard — this is amazing,” he said. This week, the song climbed 17 spots, to No. 15, on Billboard’s Hot 100, which measures the popularity of pop songs. The blending of country music and black American forms is certainly nothing new. The white guitarist Jimmie Rodgers, whom many consider the father of country music, built the genre on a foundation of the blues in the 1920s. Ray Charles’s innovations in the early 1960s paved the way for the Nashville success of another black artist, Charley Pride. More recently, Darius Rucker, of the rock band Hootie and the Blowfish, had a No. 1 country hit with “Don’t Think I Don’t Think About It.” Last year, Jimmie Allen, a black performer from Delaware, made Billboard’s country top 10 with his debut single, “Best Shot.” Another African-American singer, Kane Brown, had two No. 1 hits on Billboard’s country chart, one in 2017 and one in 2018. In a statement, Billboard said that its chart decisions were determined by factors including the promotion of a song and its reception at radio and on streaming services, and that it could revisit its decision about “Old Town Road.” So far, the song has gotten little support from country stations. Last week, it was played five times on country stations, according to Nielsen; this week, it was played 62 times by 31 stations. The remixed version of “Old Town Road,” with vocals from Mr. Cyrus, the singer of the 1992 hit “Achy Breaky Heart,” came together two weeks ago, Lil Nas X said. The finishing touches were added on Thursday night, hours before it was released and went viral all over again. The rapper’s collaboration with Mr. Cyrus, the father of the singer Miley Cyrus, may seem unlikely, but Lil Nas X said he had been a fan for years. In December, two days after the song’s initial release, he posted a message on Twitter asking for Mr. Cyrus to join him on the track: “twitter please help me get billy ray cyrus on this.” While the addition of Mr. Cyrus may help the song’s chances on country stations and country charts, the new version makes no substantial change to its core. Mr. Cyrus defended the country bona fides of the original version of “Old Town Road” on Wednesday, adding to the pressure on Billboard and the Nashville establishment by casting Lil Nas X in the role of a beloved country music archetype — the outlaw. “When I got thrown off the charts,” Mr. Cyrus wrote on Twitter, “Waylon Jennings said to me ‘Take this as a compliment’ means you’re doing something great! Only Outlaws are outlawed. Welcome to the club!” "

The track briefly appeared on the Billboard Top Country Songs chart before being removed after it was deemed insufficiently country. (On Friday, Billy Ray Cyrus joined the track on a remix.) The lines are blurry, but this is far from the first time country music and hip-hop have been in dialogue. They’ve been dancing around each other, and sometimes with each other, for more than two decades, whether in the form of deeply Southern rap music, bluegrass-inflected hip-hop, country singers collaborating with rappers or, in some cases, those singers rapping themselves.

5c65589c3a125f5075c09aeb,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/movies/the-unicorn-review.html,"“The Unicorn” takes its title from a 1974 L.P. by an outsider singer-songwriter named Peter Grudzien. Onscreen text describes the record, still a cult favorite, as one of the first openly gay country albums. But by the end of this sustained, frightening immersion in Peter’s private world, the title has acquired a darker connotation. Isabelle Dupuis and Tim Geraghty have made a grim and haunting documentary about what it means to burn bright, then die alone. Grudzien’s Astoria home in Queens belongs to “Grey Gardens” school of housekeeping. Shot mainly from 2005 to 2007, the movie shows Peter living there with his twin sister, Terry, who like him struggles with evident mental illness, and their near-centenarian father, Joseph, who remembers a childhood working in mines. (“For some people, life, it’s not worth it,” Joseph says in a blunt summation of Terry’s demons.) Peter prattles on about the old days, recalling a Nashville where, as he describes it, everyone looked effeminate. He performs at karaoke, sounding like someone who never carried a tune in his life. Even when three cousins try to stage an intervention, it is clear that this household — which Peter voices fear of losing — is a sanctum that can’t be breached. At one point Peter, dressed at his most outlandish, brags that he is wearing the same style of sunglasses worn by the Claude Rains character in “The Invisible Man.” Invisibility is what he achieved, and what this film — by staring so empathetically at squalor and loneliness — so painfully shows.

5c706a113a125f5075c0b17e,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/22/obituaries/fred-foster-dead.html,"NASHVILLE — Fred Foster, the record producer and song publisher who championed the emerging careers of Roy Orbison, Kris Kristofferson and Dolly Parton, died here on Feb. 20. He was 87. His publicist, Martha Moore, said the cause was complications of a stroke. Mr. Foster’s most enduring early success came as the producer of Roy Orbison’s No. 1 singles “Running Scared” and “Oh, Pretty Woman” in the early 1960s. Along with the likes of “Crying” and “Only the Lonely (Know How I Feel),” all of Mr. Orbison’s hits from this period were issued by Monument Records, the label Mr. Foster established in Washington in 1958 (it took its name from the Washington Monument) and moved to Nashville two years later. Before Mr. Foster became involved with his career, Mr. Orbison had released only two minor singles on Sun Records, neither one a big hit. Mr. Foster also provided a boost to the fortunes of the 19-year-old Ms. Parton, whom he signed to Monument in 1965. She recorded her first two Top 40 country hits, “Dumb Blonde” and “Something Fishy,” for the label before going on to become a star on “The Porter Wagoner Show” on television and with RCA Records. “You saw things in me that nobody else did,” Ms. Parton said, referring to Mr. Foster’s willingness to take a chance on her, at the 2016 ceremony at which he was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. “Sometimes you just know — sometimes,” Mr. Foster explained, alluding to his instincts about Ms. Parton in a comment published by the Hall of Fame. “And that makes up for all the times you had to guess.” Maybe even more prescient than his patronage of Mr. Orbison and Ms. Parton was Mr. Foster’s signing of Kris Kristofferson to a songwriting contract with Combine Music, his fledgling publishing company, and later — despite Mr. Kristofferson’s commercially questionable singing voice — to Monument as a recording artist. Mr. Kristofferson’s 1973 single “Why Me” was his only recording for the label to reach the pop Top 40, but “Me and Bobby McGee,” on which he and Mr. Foster share the writing credit, became a posthumous No.1 pop hit for Janis Joplin in 1971. Combine also published Mr. Kristofferson’s “Sunday Morning Coming Down” and “Help Me Make It Through the Night,” a pair of mystical, existential ballads that became enduring crossover hits, “Sunday Morning” for Johnny Cash and “Help Me” for Sammi Smith. They were subsequently recorded by scores of others. Tony Joe White’s compositions “Polk Salad Annie,” a Top 10 hit for him, and “Rainy Night in Georgia,” a Top 10 hit for the soul singer Brook Benton, were also Combine titles, as was the Elvis Presley hit “Burning Love,” written by Dennis Linde. Fred Luther Foster, the youngest of eight children, was born on July 26, 1931, on a farm in Rutherford County, N.C. His father, Vance Hampton Foster, raised cotton and sorghum and played the harmonica. His mother, Clara Marcella (Weaste) Foster, was a homemaker. Enthralled by music at a young age, Mr. Foster moved to Washington when he was 18 to pursue a career in the record business. He worked in various capacities there, including as the supervisor of the country singer Jimmy Dean’s first recording session, which yielded the Top 10 country single “Bumming Around.” Mr. Foster worked as a talent scout for Mercury Records. He later recalled that he had urged his superiors there to bid aggressively for the talents of Elvis Presley, then largely unknown. But his effort was to no avail: Presley signed a contract with RCA instead. In 1963, Mr. Foster established Sound Stage 7, an R&B-oriented subsidiary of Monument. The soul singer Joe Simon’s 1969 recording of “The Chokin’ Kind” for the label became a million-selling pop and R&B hit. Monument also released several influential instrumental recordings in the 1960s, including the saxophonist Boots Randolph’s “Yakety Sax,” a Top 40 pop hit in 1963. Another recorded version of the song served as the opening theme for the long-running British comedy series “The Benny Hill Show.” Mr. Foster is survived by his son, Vance; his daughters, Micki Koenig, Leah Alderman, Brit Rothstein and Kristen Foster; and four grandchildren. Mr. Foster sold Monument and Combine in the 1980s but continued to work as a producer, most notably on “Last of the Breed,” a 2007 album that teamed Willie Nelson, Merle Haggard and Ray Price. The project earned Mr. Price and Mr. Nelson a Grammy Award for best country collaboration with vocals for their performance of the Hank Williams staple “Lost Highway.” In 2016, the Recording Academy presented Mr. Foster with a Trustees Award for lifetime achievement. “I tried to do something time would not be critical of,” Mr. Foster said that year in an interview with The Tennessean, reflecting on his contributions to the music industry. “It’s like Orbison said to me one time, ‘What’s the most important thing we’re going to do?’ I said, ‘We’re going to eliminate every gimmick you come up with. They don’t endure.’ ” "

Let us know at theplaylist@nytimes.com and sign up for our Louder newsletter, a once-a-week blast of our pop music coverage. Maren Morris gets the cursing out of the way right at the top of “Girl,” the first single from her second album, due this year. It’s a reminder she’s a country singer, but not really. “Girl,” which Morris wrote with her “The Middle” collaborator Sarah Aarons, as well as Greg Kurstin, has a bit of Billie Eilish, a little Lana Del Rey, maybe some Alannah Myles. And yet thanks to some meaty guitar, it has a slow-country stubbornness. Morris’s ambivalence extends right to the vocal mix, which obscures her, and the arc of the melody, which gets thickened but never builds or finds resolution. JON CARAMANICA There’s no avoiding it: Dolores O’Riordan’s death a year ago (she died from drowning in a London hotel bathtub after heavy drinking) haunts “All Over Now,” the first song from an album — “In the End,” due April 26 — that the Cranberries completed from demo recordings by O’Riordan and Noel Hogan. In the first verse she sings, “Do you remember, remember the night/at a hotel in London.” It turns out to be a song about seeing a woman trying to pretend she’s not a domestic-violence victim yet not getting involved. Guitars buzz in minor chords over a choppy beat, while O’Riordan’s voice — the demo included vocal harmonies — holds stoic regret. Her death multiplies the sadness of the chorus: “It’s all over now.” JON PARELES Tamaryn, a songwriter originally from New Zealand, has long placed her voice amid washes of reverb-laden guitar, mingling impulses from 1960s girl groups and 1990s shoegaze. “Fits of Rage” snaps her reveries into focus; the guitars still echo, but her voice leaps out from them, demanding accountability from someone who seems about to shrug her off. Her voice grows furious as she declares, “You can’t deny I was so close to you.” Sometimes anger is clarifying. PARELES Here’s a thoroughly convincing period piece: a Phil Spector girl-group beat, three chords and lots of reverb behind Lily & Madeleine singing in unison about passion overriding reason: “I try to keep myself together but I’m losing it anyway.” PARELES Glen Hansard, the Irish songwriter from the Frames, the Swell Season and “Once,” reduces his voice to a depressive, scratchy monotone in the ominous, low-self-esteem love song “I’ll Be You, Be Me,” from an album arriving in April. A ticking snare drum and a skulking bass accompany lines like “My lover is all good things/and I’m the fool whose spell she’s under.” By the end of the song he’s engulfed in a tsunami of strings, choir and feedback, but still too glum to raise his voice. PARELES An adorable video for a pro forma duet from two of Latin music’s rising stars who’ve been playing are-they-or-aren’t-they for months. The song is sweet, a little evanescent. Committed-to-video memories are forever, though. CARAMANICA Dawn (Richard, from Danity Kane) promises a weekend-long sexual marathon in “Sauce,” invoking Rihanna, La Perla and the Kentucky Derby over a slow, undulating trap beat. For nearly the entire track, her lead vocal stays on just two low notes; it couldn’t be more single-minded. But around it, voices and instruments materialize like stray fantasies, and a sweetly unexpected a cappella coda anticipates satisfaction. PARELES In which post-Young Thug fever-pitch syllable squeals finally come full circle and arrive at saccharine-sweet pure-pop accessibility. YNW Melly is one of the most impressive young melodists working — see “Murder on My Mind” — and even though there’s not much material to work with in the verses here, the chorus is bright, effusive and sneakily rich. Kanye is a low-impact accent piece here, singing part of the hook and adding bonus whimsy to the video. CARAMANICA Elena Alexandra Apostoleanu, the Romanian singer who records as Inna, pivots toward pop’s center. A decade ago she was singing in English over house-music beats and EDM synthesizers. But more recently, her high, smiley voice has been heard alongside Latin pop hitmakers like J Balvin, Pitbull and Daddy Yankee, in English and Spanish. In “Sin Ti,” a song about a sudden infatuation, she whispers insistent endearments in a catchy, extremely canny production by David Ciente that hops all over the Latin map: dembow verses and flamenco-tinged acoustic guitar in the chorus, with bits of sampled vocals and fleeting string-section phrases winking in and out of earshot. In a small world, she’s up-to-the-minute. PARELES Echoing the keyboard chords of Bruce Springsteen’s “My Hometown,” the Killers’ “Land of the Free” is a compendium of issues — mass incarceration, immigration, racism, gun control — heading into a gospelly chorus. The video clip, centered on news footage, is by Spike Lee; the Killers’ willingness to face a social-media backlash is as significant as the song. JON PARELES Snarky Puppy might be today’s most popular band whose audience wouldn’t be fazed by a nearly 10-minute-long lead single with no words. “Xavi” is the first thing we’re hearing from “Immigrance,” a forthcoming album from this large ensemble of virtuoso music nerds and studio hotshots. Crunchy guitar slices out a truncated phrase in conversation with an insistent snare drum, and flutes and trumpets drape a humid cloud cover overhead. The tune’s head-nodding six-beat rhythm is based around an antique chaabi groove, which Snarky’s bassist and leader, Michael League, learned from Gnawa musicians while performing in Morocco last year. It accords with “Immigrance’s” overall bent, which considers the role of migration and exchange in shaping our world. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO The alto saxophonist Greg Ward’s new album, “Stomping Off From Greenwood,” has the rusted, resonant sound of so much beat-driven jazz coming from Chicago natives today (Jeff Parker, Makaya McCraven, Marquis Hill). But its instrumentation — alto sax, two guitars, bass, drums — calls to mind another standout album from last year, Logan Richardson’s “Blues People.” Like Richardson on his album, Ward bobs gracefully through a coolly plotted improvisation on “The Contender” as his rhythm section handles a stop-and-start polyrhythm, creating friction and expectation and the illusion of an incline for Ward to climb.

5cab4ea749f0eacbf1f81974,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/08/arts/music/2019-acm-awards-country-music.html,"Country music royalty turned out in force on Sunday for a glittering night of live performances and honors at the 54th annual Academy of Country Music Awards. The show’s host, Reba McEntire — her record 16th time in the job — wasted no time in addressing one of the evening’s touchy subjects: the lack of women nominees in some top categories. Noting recent snow in Las Vegas, where the awards were held in a live, performance-heavy broadcast, McEntire said, “It was so cold it froze us women out of entertainer of the year.” Kacey Musgraves, the winner of four Grammy Awards this year, including album of the year for “Golden Hour,” was absent from the all-male list of nominees in the show’s top category. The honor went to Keith Urban, whose wife, the actress Nicole Kidman, appeared genuinely shocked at his win. But Musgraves took home the awards for both album of the year and female artist of the year. “I’m so thankful for the chance to share my political perspective,” Musgraves said in accepting the female artist of the year prize, dedicating the award to women who felt pressure to silence themselves. “This award goes out to any woman, or girl — or anybody, really — that is maybe being told that her perspective or her style is too different to work,” Musgraves said. “Just stay at it. It’ll work out.” [Watch how Kacey Musgraves turned country music psychedelic.] And women ruled the MGM Grand Garden Arena stage as Chrissy Metz, of hit NBC show “This Is Us,” made her live TV performance debut, alongside the country stars Lauren Alaina, Mickey Guyton and Maddie & Tae, for a stirring rendition of “I’m Standing With You.” Jason Aldean and Florida Georgia Line opened the show with a rousing performance of “Can’t Hide Red,” but some on social media took offense to Tyler Hubbard’s American flag suit. Dan + Shay scored three straight early wins, for song of the year and single of the year for “Tequila,” as well as duo of the year. Male artist of the year went to Thomas Rhett. The star-laden three-hour show marked an upbeat return to celebrating country music after last year’s awards assumed a somber note following the October 2017 mass shooting, also in Las Vegas, that killed 58 people at a country music festival. Aldean, who was performing at that festival when the gunfire broke out, received the ACM artist of the decade award. Other country stars performing included Blake Shelton, Luke Bryan, Chris Stapleton, Urban, Brooks & Dunn, Miranda Lambert, McEntire and George Strait. "
5c87f35a49f0eacbf105cac2,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/12/arts/music/maren-morris-girl-review.html,"In 2016, Maren Morris broke all the country music rules. Her major label debut album, “Hero,” was a vivid indictment of country’s dull masculinist norms — it had wit, creativity, punch and ambition. And as you might expect with all things Nashville, it made Morris … moderately successful. Country music has been clogged with dullish gentlemen for the last few years, and while Morris recorded some of the genre’s most promising music, some good it did her. She had a handful of hits — the cheeky “Rich,” the desperate “I Could Use a Love Song,” the howling “My Church” — that tartly underscored just how ideologically robust the rest of the genre wasn’t. It took sidestepping country altogether for Morris to get something like her due. “The Middle,” her 2018 chunky electro-pop stomper with Zedd and Grey, became the biggest Maren Morris hit — No. 5 on the Hot 100, and Grammy nominated — but also the one least specific to her talents. [See how Zedd, Maren Morris and a 23-year-old songwriter turned a few chords into “The Middle.”] Perhaps the vagueness that oozes throughout her scattershot new album, “Girl,” is attributable to that success. The best songs on “Hero” were disarmingly detailed, and sometimes funny. “Girl,” however, tips away from those strengths in favor of self-help bromides broad enough to exclude no one. Time and again on “Girl,” Morris seeks out wide-open territory. Many songs aim for the universal, the big tent: “The Feels” and “Make Out With Me” are lighthearted looking-for-love fun; “Great Ones” favors abstract image over detail (“You’re the perfect storm/So let it pour down on me”); “Good Woman” and “Shade” feel distant. Even “Flavor,” which is oriented around female empowerment, veers toward the bland: “Yeah I’m a lady, I make my dough/Won’t play the victim, Don’t fit that mold.” “The Middle” revealed that Morris’s voice had a natural home beyond country music, but to be fair, so did her debut album, which showed how versatile her vocal approach is — capable of delivering aspirational pop, novel country and also impressive shades of R&B. Her voice is thin, but it’s not brittle; it cuts through a variety of production styles easily. Many of her most forceful vocal performances on “Girl” are far from country music, like the up-tempo soul number “RSVP,” which with a few tweaks could easily make sense for, say, Monica or SZA. One of the finest moments is “The Bones,” which nods to the Chainsmokers and Daya hit “Don’t Let Me Down,” and features some of this album’s sturdiest songwriting. When Morris does lean in to country music’s past, it’s to lightly echo Dolly Parton’s chipper anthem “9 to 5” on “All My Favorite People,” which features Brothers Osborne singing with an arched eyebrow, as if performing a “Hee Haw” sketch. It’s a disruptive way to pay homage. “All My Favorite People” is one of the more detailed songs on this album, and also the one that most echoes the themes of the 2016 Morris: a nod to weed smoking, an assertion that “we love who we love.” But Kacey Musgraves — a Morris contemporary and peer in jolting country music’s center with the occasional drug reference — is now a Grammy album of the year winner, and even Luke Bryan is slipping notes of tolerance into his songs. These gestures now feel less urgent. What seemed audacious just a few years ago is now pro forma. So in the way “Hero” demonstrated how comfortable Morris was coloring outside country music’s lines, “Girl” instead indicates how well Morris might fill in pre-existing boundaries. One of the downsides of moving the goal posts is that they move for you as well. "
5c74207a49f0eacbf105a0c9,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/25/obituaries/mac-wiseman-dead.html,"Mac Wiseman, the bluegrass balladeer and guitar player known as “the Voice With a Heart,” whose hallmark was crossing musical genre lines, died on Sunday in Nashville. He was 93. The cause was kidney failure, his companion and caregiver, Janie Boyd, said. Mr. Wiseman first made his mark in the 1940s playing with bluegrass legends, first as a founding member of Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs’s Foggy Mountain Boys, and then with Bill Monroe’s Blue Grass Boys. As a sometime lead singer with Monroe’s group, Mr. Wiseman was featured on classics like “Can’t You Hear Me Callin’ ” and “Travelin’ This Lonesome Road.” He appeared as a headlining act on the bluegrass circuit in the 1950s and ’60s. But his musical instincts were always too wide-ranging to rest comfortably within the sometimes hermetic confines of bluegrass. “Not to sound too critical, but the ‘bluegrass’ classification was the worst damned thing ever happened to me,” Mr. Wiseman said, talking about his first decade as a solo artist, in an interview with the roots music magazine No Depression in 2006. “Up until then I was getting as much airplay as Marty Robbins or Ray Price.” Mr. Wiseman’s biggest hits as a solo artist were “The Ballad of Davy Crockett” in 1955 and “Jimmy Brown, the Newsboy” in 1959, both of which reached the Top 10 of the country chart. His other early successes included interpretations of songs like “Love Letters in the Sand,” which had been a No. 1 pop hit for Pat Boone, and “I Wonder How the Old Folks Are at Home,” a parlor favorite recorded by the Carter Family. Mr. Wiseman’s signature song, “ ’Tis Sweet to Be Remembered,” was written in 1902, and his version owed as much to vintage pop and swing music as it did to country or bluegrass. “ ’Tis sweet to be remembered, on a bright or a gloomy day / ’Tis sweet to be remembered, by a dear one far away,” he crooned in a limpid tenor in the song’s waltzing chorus. The record, his first release as a solo artist, was typical of the earnest, reverberating delivery that would sustain him in a seven-decade solo career, in which he released more than 60 albums. Not merely a gifted singer, Mr. Wiseman was also a successful music producer and entrepreneur. He was the founding secretary of the board of the Country Music Foundation in 1958. Before that he spent four years as the creative director of the West Coast office of Dot Records. He also managed the WWVA Jamboree, a weekly barn dance and radio broadcast in Wheeling, W.Va., from 1966 to 1970. Despite feeling hemmed in by the bluegrass label, Mr. Wiseman was elected to the International Bluegrass Music Association’s Hall of Fame in 1993 and was for decades regarded as one of the idiom’s elder statesmen. Robert Shelton of The New York Times, reviewing an appearance by Mr. Wiseman at Carnegie Hall in 1962, wrote that he “used the penetrating, driving idiom of the bluegrass vocal leader in a most winning fashion.” Sharing the bill that evening were Mother Maybelle Carter, Johnny Cash and other popular country and bluegrass entertainers. Malcolm Bell Wiseman was born on May 23, 1925, in Crimora, Va., in the foothills of the Shenandoah Mountains. His parents, Howard Bell Wiseman, a miller, and Myra Ruth (Humphreys) Wiseman, oversaw a musical household; Mac first performed in public as an adolescent. Afflicted with polio at a young age, he went on to win a scholarship from the National Foundation for Polio to study piano, music theory and radio broadcasting at a conservatory in Dayton, Va., in the northwest part of the state. In 1946, after a brief stint as a singer and disc jockey in nearby Harrisonburg, Va., the young Mr. Wiseman moved to Knoxville, Tenn., to work as a harmony vocalist and upright bass player for the country singer Molly O’Day. He appeared both on her popular radio show and on the recordings she made for Columbia that year. In 1947 he began performing on WCYB in Bristol, Va., where he met Lester Flatt. A friendship ensued, and Mr. Wiseman joined the first edition of Flatt & Scruggs’s Foggy Mountain Boys in 1948, with Flatt on guitar and Scruggs on banjo. After that apprenticeship and his subsequent time in Bill Monroe’s band, he formed his own group, the Country Boys, who headlined the Old Dominion Barn Dance in Richmond, Va., from 1953 to 1956. He reunited with Flatt to record three albums for RCA Records in the early 1970s. Mr. Wiseman recorded for Capitol, MGM and a number of other labels after leaving Dot in 1963, creating versions of songs as varied as the New Orleans rhythm-and-blues standard “I Hear You Knockin’ ” and Fleetwood Mac’s “Never Going Back Again.” He performed in venues of all stripes, from college campuses and bluegrass band shells to the Hollywood Bowl. Mr. Wiseman hosted an annual bluegrass festival in Renfro Valley, Ky., from 1970 to 1983. He received a National Heritage Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts in 2008. Survivors include two sons, Scott and Randy; three daughters, Maxine Wiseman, Chris Haynes and Linda Parr; a brother, Kenny; a sister, Virginia Davis; three grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren. Mr. Wiseman was a harbinger of a crossover sensibility in bluegrass, as later heard in the repertoires of artists like the Dillards and Alison Krauss. He recorded with everyone from the big-band leader Woody Herman to the folk iconoclast John Prine. Emotional resonance, rather than the constraints of a particular genre, was his guiding principle when selecting collaborators and material. “I liked all kinds of music,” Mr. Wiseman said in 2006, reflecting on his years growing up in the music-steeped Shenandoah Valley. “I liked Bing Crosby and Montana Slim, and the reason that I mention those two is that they both had network radio shows, two 15-minute programs in the morning, back to back out of New York, when I was 8, 9 years old — and it just struck me that I liked one as well as the other.” "
5c6ac96a3a125f5075c0a44e,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/18/arts/music/kacey-musgraves-grammys.html,"If you ask Kacey Musgraves — the country singer-songwriter who won four Grammy Awards last Sunday, including album of the year — how her week has been, you’ll get a pretty good idea of her default manner. “Mehhh,” she said playfully over the phone Friday evening, after a few days of letting it all sink in. “I’ve had better.” Her tongue-in-cheek deflection spoke to the shock that a progressive, psychedelic-drug-using Nashville misfit from Texas could have beaten Cardi B, Drake and Kendrick Lamar for what remains the highest annual honor in music. [See how Kacey Musgraves made the “Golden Hour” song “Slow Burn.”] “Golden Hour,” Musgraves’s third major label album, was critically beloved, but had barely been embraced by country radio — still the genre’s mainstream driver — and was far from a smash. Ahead of the Grammys, the album had totaled about 310,000 in sales, compared to many millions for the favorites in the top categories. Still, in addition to her first album of the year, Musgraves won Grammys for best country album, best country solo performance (“Butterflies”) and best country song (“Space Cowboy”), bringing her career total to six. In Musgraves’s first interview since her Cinderella moment, the singer reflected on this year’s Grammys, her place in the Nashville scene and what’s to come. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. Congratulations on a big night. How have you been celebrating? Lots of R & R time. Definitely happy moments with the team, but also celebrating with food. Enjoying having some burgers — note the plural nature. My husband and I had some down time together — spa time, which is a way that I like to take a break. But I’m already back to a week of shows. And how did you celebrate that night — did you go hard or just crash at the hotel?  I went really hard at Fatburger. I’m not like, hugely into an after-party scene, usually. I kind of like celebrating on my own terms. But we did stop by. And then afterward, not only did I have a fried chicken sandwich doused in buffalo sauce, but I also had a cheeseburger with jalapeños on it, and I ate both, 100 percent, and fries. I sat there and ate it in the restaurant in my Valentino dress. I went straight from shaking Mick Jagger’s hand to having a fried chicken sandwich in my hand. What do you remember about the moment your name was called for that final award? Disbelief, in general. But weirdly, a sense of calmness. Leading up to an award like that, you have a little hope, I think, that maybe you’ll win. But I was fine with not winning because it was just such a crazy compliment to be nominated alongside such giant albums. Huge albums that garnered lots of attention, lots of sales, lots of radio play. So you can hope that you may have a small chance, but I definitely was nowhere near banking on anything. It was a really beautiful moment, and I was somehow able to find the words to get out what I wanted to say. I don’t think it’s something that you can process until way later. Who’s the funniest person who has contacted you to say congratulations? Any heroes, exes or elementary-school enemies? Definitely some randoms. Nothing too crazy. No exes, for sure. [Laughs] Six Grammys now — where are you going to put them all? Well, I’m a little limited on shelf space at the house — we have a small house! I was thinking maybe I’ll give one to my grandma. One for my parents to keep. Maybe one in the car — on the hood of the car, so everyone knows. Any standout Grammy moments from behind the scenes? If you could’ve seen us quick-changing into my Dolly Parton outfit and giant hair in a matter of seven minutes, that would’ve been something to see. If I would’ve just walked away from that night having just performed with Dolly, that would’ve felt like the win of a lifetime for myself, because she is the ultimate, as far as I’m concerned. Obviously the Grammys got some flak last year about its representation of women, and this year was an attempt at a makeup. How do you think the show did? I think the Grammys definitely made up for last year’s lack of female representation, but the credit also has to go to the women who are the ones making the art. You never want to think that there’s a crazy influx — a 180 from last year — because of [tokenism]. It would be a shame to feel that way. But in this case there were a lot of really beautiful pieces of work released. So I’m not going to think about it that much. You haven’t always been embraced by the Nashville establishment. Were you surprised that you cleaned up in the country categories? Country music itself and the Nashville community have always shown me great support and love from the beginning. When I first moved to town, about 11 years ago, I got a giant education from the Nashville songwriting community. I made a ton of friends, I worked really hard for years there before I was even an artist myself. So I feel really connected to that community, and I feel like they do have my back. That’s a whole different side of Nashville. The other side of it is country radio, which has its own problem with women. Do you expect them to look at you differently now? It’s been really amazing to see “Rainbow” have such a positive response on all genres of radio after the awards. Like I’ve said from day one, this album and none of my albums are created specifically for that end-goal, but if it ends up there, I’m more than grateful. Can we expect a new album in 2019? My goal, in general, is just to be able to stay somewhat inspired by something, and to be able to tap into some kind of creative vein. So I will go poke around and see if I can catch some kind of creative wind, songwise, at some point soon. There are a couple songs that I really like. I have no idea where that’s going to go, but that’s the fun of it — exploring until you can find something to start packing into the next snowball. "
5c535cca3a125f5075c0764d,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/obituaries/harold-bradley-dead.html,"NASHVILLE — Harold Bradley, who played on thousands of country, pop and rock ’n’ roll recordings, including landmark hits like Brenda Lee’s “I’m Sorry,” Patsy Cline’s “Crazy” and Roy Orbison’s “Only the Lonely,” died on Thursday in Nashville. He was 93. His death, at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, was confirmed by his daughter Beverly Bradley. Beginning in the 1940s, Mr. Bradley’s work on six-string bass and guitar was also featured on records by, among many others, Red Foley, Hank Williams, Elvis Presley, Buddy Holly, the Everly Brothers and Loretta Lynn. Mr. Bradley, known for his spare, soulful playing, also played banjo and other instruments. But according to Guitar Player magazine and other sources, he is among the most recorded guitarists in history. The younger brother of the pioneering record producer Owen Bradley, Mr. Bradley also served for decades as the de facto leader of Nashville’s A-Team, the elite circle of first-call session musicians immortalized in the Lovin’ Spoonful’s 1966 Top 10 hit “Nashville Cats.” “Clear as country water” is how that song characterized the intuitive, uncluttered playing of the team under Mr. Bradley’s direction, an expansive ensemble that also included the pianist Floyd Cramer and the pedal steel guitarist Pete Drake. By the late ’60s, the group’s laid-back, no-frills approach drew folk and rock luminaries like Bob Dylan, Joan Baez and the Byrds to Nashville to record with them. “Everything that was happening in the studio — that was my world; that was as big as it got,” Mr. Bradley said, looking back on Nashville’s 1950s and ’60s heyday in a 2013 interview with NPR. “And then one day, my brother came up and he said, ‘We’ve got 25 out of the top 50 songs,’ ” Mr. Bradley continued, referring to the profusion of hit singles that featured Nashville’s A-Team. “All of a sudden I’m thinking, ‘That stuff we did in the studio, people are listening to that all over the world.’ ” Although he was a capable lead guitarist, Mr. Bradley made his mark as a rhythm specialist. His signature style featured a clicking, propulsive figure, often performed on six-string electric bass, that mimicked the lines of the acoustic bass. Known among industry insiders as “tic tac,” Mr. Bradley’s less-is-more approach furnished the supple rhythm bed for both Eddy Arnold’s “Make the World Go Away” and Tammy Wynette’s “Stand by Your Man.” In the process he helped shape not only the pop-inflected “Nashville sound” of singers like Mr. Arnold and Ms. Cline, but also the more soulful “countrypolitan” sound of Ms. Wynette, George Jones and Conway Twitty. As accomplished an entrepreneur as he was a musician, Mr. Bradley, with his brother Owen and Owen’s son Jerry, was among the first to build independent music studios on Nashville’s Music Row. By 1955 the three of them had merged their initial two ventures into Bradley Film and Recordings Studios, a musicians’ haven more commonly known as the Quonset Hut. During its first months of operation, the Quonset Hut produced blockbuster hits like Gene Vincent’s “Be-Bop-a-Lula,” Marty Robbins’s “Singing the Blues” and Sonny James’s “Young Love.” By the time Columbia Records purchased the facility in 1962, the Bradleys, along with visionary record executives like Chet Atkins and Don Law, had established Nashville as a major recording center. Later in his career, as subsequent generations of studio players rose to prominence and he worked fewer sessions, Mr. Bradley became active in the Nashville chapter of the American Federation of Musicians. From 1991 to 2008 he was the union’s president. He was also vice president of the international division for more than a decade. Mr. Bradley was elected to the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2006. He was the first instrumentalist without a significant career as a solo artist to be so honored. Harold Ray Bradley was born on Jan. 2, 1926, in Nashville, one of six children. His father, Vernon, was a salesman for Cumberland Tobacco Works for 46 years. His mother, Letha Maie (Owen) Bradley, was a homemaker. Mr. Bradley first learned to play the tenor banjo, but he switched his focus to guitar after his brother Owen observed that guitarists were in greater demand than banjo players. At 17 he became lead guitarist in Ernest Tubb’s band, the Texas Troubadours. After serving in the Navy from 1944 to 1946, he returned to Nashville and began playing in his brother’s local dance orchestra, which featured the future pop stars Snooky Lanson and Kitty Kallen as vocalists. Mr. Bradley worked his first studio session in Chicago in 1946, recording with the Grand Ole Opry star Pee Wee King and his Golden West Boys. He did not make his Nashville session debut until four years later (the city would not emerge as a recording hub until the 1950s), when he played acoustic guitar on Red Foley’s “Chattanoogie Shoe Shine Boy,” a No. 1 country and pop hit. Mr. Bradley also produced numerous television variety shows and movie soundtracks and made a brief appearance in Robert Altman’s acclaimed 1975 film, “Nashville.” In addition to his daughter Beverly, Mr. Bradley is survived by his wife of 66 years, Eleanor Allen Bradley; another daughter, Bari Bradley Brooks; and two grandchildren. Although he released three instrumental albums under his own name, Mr. Bradley regarded himself primarily as a contributor to the work of others. “We had a setup,” he said, reflecting modestly on his decades as a session musician in Nashville in 2013. “We would work from 10 to 1, 2 to 5, 6 to 9 and 10 to 1 at night,” he continued. “To me, it was like going to a party. A Brenda Lee party in the morning, then a Ray Stevens party in the afternoon. A Bill Monroe party and then end up with Henry Mancini and Patsy Cline and Elvis and just other people. I was just glad to be on board.” "
5c5b3dd13a125f5075c085b2,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/06/us/california-storms-ski-season.html,"In the past week, California has been pummeled by fierce winter storms wreaking havoc from Sacramento to San Diego. Flash floods have damaged an already fragile landscape, as near hurricane-force winds downed power lines along the coast. On Tuesday, mountain highways were closed because of blizzard conditions and the National Weather Service warned about avalanches in the eastern Sierra Nevada range. But for the state’s ski resorts, it’s looking a lot like a boom time. At the Squaw Valley resort near Lake Tahoe, attendance is up 25 percent compared with last year, according to executives there. In Central California, Mammoth Mountain Ski Area said it had record guest attendance at its lodges in December and January, and was on pace to outperform again this month. To be fair, last year wasn’t the best for California skiers. But after a long period of drought that has often left ski slopes bare, with occasional years of heavy snow, the waves of storms that have swept across the state in recent weeks are a welcome respite. Some resorts have reported more than seven feet of new snow over the past several days, with more winter storms forecast for the weekend. “This is what we live for,” said Craig Albright, the senior director of skier services at Mammoth Mountain. “It kind of is our Super Bowl. It’s intense. It’s a little scary outside. You can feel the intensity of the weather.” Snowpack from Oct. 1 to Feb. 5 is up about 134 percent from normal levels in the Tahoe area and throughout the Sierra, according to officials at the National Weather Service office in Reno, Nev. While that’s less than the record set two years ago, when winter storms ravaged the West Coast, it is still welcome news for ski resorts. Tim Bardsley, a hydrologist with the Weather Service, said increased snow and rain would boost the state’s water supply. A cross-country skier, he said the conditions had been great so far. “The back country has been more variable,” he said. “But there has been a lot of powder, which is pretty fabulous.” Of course, getting there can be a challenge. Mike Goar, the vice president and chief operating officer at Heavenly Mountain Resort, near Lake Tahoe, recommended that skiers check road updates before driving into the mountains. This week, 100 miles of Interstate 80, the main artery through the Sierra, was closed because of whiteout conditions. And with the new fallen snow — especially if it is heavy and wet — comes the risk of avalanches. On Tuesday, Squaw Valley posted a warning on its website: “Our 4-day storm total is now over 6 feet! Avalanche conditions exist, please check lift status.” Squaw Valley has reported 341 inches of snow this season, while its sister resort, Alpine Meadows, has reported 277 inches. Ron Cohen, the president of Squaw Valley Alpine Meadows resorts, said his company had recently installed additional Gazex avalanche control systems, which set off controlled slides while a slope is closed so that larger, more destructive avalanches are less likely when skiers are navigating the terrain. (An explosion using Gazex is triggered using a mixture of oxygen and propane.) He said they were safer than other explosive devices used to control avalanches. Some residents have complained about the noise. “You can never eliminate the risk entirely,” he said. While the ski industry has long nervously watched global warming, Mr. Cohen said he could not attribute the swings in California’s snowy weather to climate change. Still, he added, “Climate change has a role in broad weather changes.” This week’s gale-force winds forced many California resorts to close temporarily in the early part of the week. “You can’t operate the chairlifts,” Mr. Albright said. Still, he said Mammoth had been fortunate that the storms had mostly arrived during the middle of the week, making way for weekend skiers. “They hear the hype on the Weather Channel, see it on the news,” he said. “People have dreams of powder,” Mr. Albright added, laughing. “But when they get stuck, it’s not so pleasant.” "
5c6d7a433a125f5075c0a9d6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/20/sports/kikkan-randall-breast-cancer.html,"PENTICTON, British Columbia — Inside the living room of her new home, Kikkan Randall held a wig in her hands. Her own hair is growing back, but it is still a long way from matching the shoulder-length coiffure with the pink streaks that she sported for much of her career to remind her audience that cross-country skiers were “NOT boring.” The blond wig with a pink streak — purchased last year in Anchorage, her home city — was meant to provide a sense of normalcy amid upheaval. “It’s funny,” she said last week as she placed it on her no-longer bald head. “Where we’re at now, I feel like I’m playing dress-up when I wear this.” A year ago, when Randall and Jessie Diggins won the United States’ first Olympic gold medal in cross-country skiing and its first medal of any kind in the sport in 42 years, Randall already had breast cancer. She just did not know it yet. After all the wide-eyed jubilation in Pyeongchang, South Korea, on the night of Feb. 21, 2018, Randall’s realization that something might be wrong came on a much quieter evening — and served as a stark reminder that cancer doesn’t really care if you are an Olympic medalist, an icon in your sport, have no family history of the disease and are more fit than 99.99 percent of the population. It was May 13, Mother’s Day, less than three months after her crowning achievement. The newly retired Randall; her husband, Jeff Ellis; and their 2-year-old son, Breck, had just spent a day in the outdoors near their new home in Penticton, a small Canadian city that sits between two lakes in the Okanagan Valley. They had hiked in the nearby mountains in the sunshine, bought a grill for their yard and shared the feeling that they were finally settling into a rhythm after months of transition and a post-Olympic move from Anchorage. “We’d had the best day,” Randall, 36, said. “I was so psyched on life, psyched to be a mom, psyched to be here starting our life here together. And then I was getting ready for bed and just happened to notice it.” Her fingers brushed across something hard in her right breast. “I thought it was my rib bone at first, but then it was, ‘Hmm, it feels like it’s kind of moving around in there,’” she said. The diagnosis, delivered on May 31 by telephone as she was traveling to a wedding in Sweden, was Stage 2 invasive ductal carcinoma. “Early on, there was definitely a heavy, why-me phase,” Ellis said of Randall’s reaction. “How is this possible? After all these years I finally got my medal and now I can’t enjoy it? So many years of delayed gratification. But Kikkan is pretty indomitable, which means that you are not always up, but that’s the predominant spirit.” Randall and Ellis have been uncommonly open throughout her treatment, particularly on social media — an attempt to connect with Randall’s fan base and to provide others in similar situations with information and inspiration. She has posted from the wig shop, the hospital recovery room, the bathroom mirror and her Penticton couch after chemotherapy and a cold caught from Breck left her drained and miserable for a stretch last year. Randall found the two pea-size tumors in her breast relatively early and received an upbeat prognosis for a common type of cancer.  But as a new arrival in Canada, she did not yet have health insurance. The United States Olympic Committee agreed to continue providing coverage throughout her extensive and expensive treatment, but she was required to receive her primary cancer care in the United States. She chose Anchorage, where her parents and many of her closest friends live and where she remains a local icon after competing in five Olympics. But that meant weeks apart from Jeff and Breck as she shuttled between Canada and Alaska going through six rounds of chemotherapy, a lumpectomy, follow-up surgery and 33 sessions of radiation. Shortly before she finished her final radiation session, on Jan. 25, her mother, Deborah, opened a bottle of Champagne to mark the occasion. The bottle had originally been purchased to celebrate Randall’s long-awaited gold medal. “When cancer happened, my mom decided that bottle had a new meaning,” Randall said. There are, of course, private burdens, none heavier than the reality that Randall’s treatment means she and Ellis must postpone plans to have more children. That made her Mother’s Day discovery all the more poignant. “When I found out I had cancer, it was almost disbelief,” Randall said. “It was like, ‘I did everything right, and I’ve taken really good care of myself.’ I had put all this work in my career and was looking forward to a point where I would get the kind of time to not have to be so disciplined and enjoy the reward of all that effort. But what really has been the most upsetting is the fact we couldn’t try and have another kid right away.” In her mid-30s, with a tight window before she needed to start chemotherapy in July, Randall said she had enough time for one cycle of fertility drugs so the couple could try to have another child later. She and Ellis worked with a clinic in Seattle, which was unable to ship her some of the necessary medication because of import regulations. So Randall drove about 50 miles to the border, picked up the medicine and brought it back to Penticton. She said she produced nine eggs, six of which were viable. Five embryos were then created, but only three made it through the first week. Of those three, Randall said, only one did not have a high risk of leading to a miscarriage. “We would have loved to have three, but we got one, and you have about a 60 percent chance of that becoming a viable pregnancy,” she said. Randall and Ellis have nicknamed the surviving embryo Little Frosty. “He’s hanging out in Seattle in storage, and they can keep embryos up to 10 years,” she said. Randall said she expected to be on anti-hormone medication for at least five years, possibly as long as 10. Pregnancy is not advisable during such treatment, although Randall said she might be able to take a break from the medication to pursue having a child. “If we only ever end up with Breck, he’s amazing,” Randall said. The family moved to Penticton for a job opportunity for Ellis, a former 400-meter hurdler for Canada, who was later an elite cross-country skier. But he said he left his new job in July to play a bigger role with Breck and to have more flexibility to help Randall. After they moved to Canada for Ellis’s career, Randall’s pursuits are again taking precedence.  The couple now work together out of the house, focusing on Randall’s business and charitable opportunities. Her regimen includes training in the small workout room on the ground floor. Last Friday morning, she put herself through a brisk circuit of weight lifting, dips, resistance band work and other exercises that she has tried to maintain since entering what she calls her G.I. Jane phase. She shaved her head after her hair began to fall out in clumps early in chemotherapy. Randall likes to do laundry between sets, and her deep breathing was often drowned out by the sound of a washing machine shifting through its cycles. Bottles of detergent share space on shelves with mementos from her and Ellis’s athletic careers. A photo of the gold medal finish from Pyeongchang, with Diggins’s arms thrust triumphantly skyward, sits atop a baseboard heater where Randall can see it as she sweats. Though there are signs of the strain, such as dark half-circles under her eyes, she looks lean and fit. “Thankfully all the muscles didn’t go away,” she said. She has put them to use: biking to and from her cancer treatments in Anchorage and hopping on skis very soon after her lumpectomy, using only one pole for a time to avoid overworking her right side. In September, she won a 10-kilometer run in Penticton, and last month, while still finishing radiation treatment, she won the women’s event at a duathlon ski race in Anchorage. “I don’t think cancer patients are told enough what they can do,” she said. Randall, who has a port implanted in her chest to continue receiving injections of the drug Herceptin, wants to promote physical activity during treatment. She has taken inspiration from and spoken with Gabriele Grunewald, the 32-year-old American middle-distance runner, who has continued to compete despite dealing with more virulent forms of cancer. Randall has no plans to return to top-level competition and has not skied more than 30 kilometers since her cancer diagnosis, but she will take part in the American Birkebeiner, a 50-kilometer ski marathon in Hayward, Wis., on Saturday. She then heads to China to take part in sprint ski races in the Bird’s Nest stadium as part of the buildup to the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. In November, she intends to run the New York City Marathon. She also has regular meetings as a member of the International Olympic Committee and the board of the U.S.O.C. Those positions don’t come with a salary, so she needs to generate regular income through speaking engagements and sponsorships. The whirlwind, if she stays healthy, will resume soon enough. But last Saturday, with the weather and the agenda clear, she and Ellis packed their minivan with gear and drove about 45 minutes west to the groomed cross-country trails of Nickel Plate Nordic Centre. Ellis clicked into his bindings and towed Breck in a carrier with Randall whooping alongside them as they headed down a gentle slope. Later, as she sprinted across the snow on her own, the rest of her family took a break. “After everything, it’s great to see her out there on skis,” Ellis said. “It’s her happy place.” "
5c462b963a125f5075c058cf,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/21/obituaries/reggie-young-dead.html,"NASHVILLE — Reggie Young, a prolific studio guitarist who appeared on landmark recordings by Elvis Presley and many others and played a prominent role in shaping the sound of Southern popular music in the 1960s and ’70s, died on Thursday at his home in Leipers Fork, Tenn., just outside Nashville. He was 82. His wife, Jenny Young, said the cause was heart failure. Mr. Young played guitar on hundreds of hit recordings in a career that spanned more than six decades. Among his best-known credits are the Box Tops’ “The Letter” and Presley’s “Suspicious Minds,” both No. 1 pop singles in the late ’60s, and Neil Diamond’s 1969 Top 10 hit “Sweet Caroline.” Mr. Young also played the funky chicken-scratch guitar lick on “Skinny Legs and All,” the soul singer Joe Tex’s 1967 Top 10 pop hit. He contributed the reverberating fills and swells that punctuate James Carr’s timeless soul ballad “The Dark End of the Street,” also from 1967. And his bluesy riffing buttressed the sultry, throbbing groove on “Son of a Preacher Man,” a Top 10 single for the British pop singer Dusty Springfield in 1968. Mr. Young appeared on all these recordings, including those associated with Presley’s late-’60s return to the limelight, as a member of the Memphis Boys, the renowned house band for the producer Chips Moman’s American Sound Studio. Living and working in Memphis, where there had long been a fertile cross-pollinization between country music and the blues, was critical to the development of Mr. Young’s down-home style of playing, a muscular yet relaxed mix of rhythmic and melodic instincts. “In Memphis, it’s sort of in between Nashville and the Southern Delta down in Mississippi, so I’m kind of a cross between B. B. King and Chet Atkins,” Mr. Young said in an interview published on the website Soul and Jazz and Funk in 2017. “Most of the soul music back then was in Memphis,” he added. “That’s where I came from.” In addition to playing guitar, Mr. Young added the psychedelic accents of the electric sitar to a handful of influential recordings, among them the Box Tops’ “Cry Like a Baby” and B. J. Thomas’s “Hooked on a Feeling,” both of which reached the Top 10 in 1968. After American Sound Studio closed in 1972, Mr. Young moved to Nashville, where his soulful less-is-more approach graced hits like Dobie Gray’s “Drift Away,” Waylon Jennings’s “Luckenbach, Texas” and Willie Nelson’s “Always on My Mind.” Mr. Young’s Nashville session credits also include Billy Swan’s “I Can Help,” which topped both the country and pop charts in 1974. Mr. Young made an indelible contribution, especially during his years in Memphis, to the Southernization of pop music in the 1960s and early ’70s. This influence was felt not just by the number of records made in the South that were played on AM radio throughout the nation. It was also evident in the procession of artists, among them Aretha Franklin, Paul Simon and the jazz flutist Herbie Mann, who came from outside the region to make records steeped in the Southern musical vernacular. Reggie Grimes Young was born on Dec. 12, 1936, in Caruthersville, Mo., and was raised in Osceola, Ark., and later in Memphis. His father, Reggie, was an accountant who played Hawaiian-style classical guitar and taught his son to play when he was 14. His mother, Thelma (Mayes) Young, was a homemaker. In 1956 Mr. Young joined Eddie Bond and the Stompers, a rockabilly band that had a regional hit with a record called “Rockin’ Daddy” and opened shows for Johnny Cash, Roy Orbison and Carl Perkins. Three years later he joined Bill Black’s Combo, an instrumental quintet led by Presley’s former bass player. He played on two No. 1 R&B singles with the group, “Smokie” and “White Silver Sands,” before joining the Army in 1960, and rejoined after his return to civilian life in the early ’60s. He arrived just in time to travel with Bill Black’s Combo when it opened for the Beatles on their 1964 tour of the United States. During that tour, Mr. Young had the opportunity to introduce George Harrison to the finer points of his Southern style of playing. “George asked me, because I’m a blues player, ‘How do you bend and stretch your strings like that?’ ” Mr. Young recalled in the Soul and Jazz and Funk interview. “I told him, ‘You have to have light-gauge strings,’ and after that I think he went to lighter gauge strings on his guitar.” A compilation album of 24 tracks from sessions on which Mr. Young played, including recordings by Merle Haggard, Jackie DeShannon and Bobby (Blue) Bland, is to be released by the English label Ace Records this week. In addition to his wife, Mr. Young is survived by a son, Reggie III; a daughter, Cindy Evans; a sister, Alice Weatley; five grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren. Mr. Young played with so many luminaries over the course of his career that he said “it was nothing special” for him and his fellow Memphis Boys to be tapped to support Elvis Presley in the studio in the late ’60s. “We played with all the top stars of the time, and Elvis hadn’t had any hits for a while and didn’t have an album on the charts,” he said in a 2013 interview with Premier Guitar magazine. “As he stepped into the studio though — boy,” he continued. “I never met any other person with such charisma. It was very special for me.” "
5c45a63d3a125f5075c057a4,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/21/opinion/nashville-music.html,"NASHVILLE — I am not a musician, or even an aspiring musician, but I moved to Nashville in 1987 because of music. One of my college roommates was in graduate school at Vanderbilt and invited me to visit, and my own grad school boyfriend tagged along. Haywood was, and still is, a picker himself, and he expected to fall in love with Music City; he even packed his résumé. Katy Ginanni, my college friend, lived on 17th Avenue South, in the section called Music Square West. It’s part of a rectangle of streets that collectively form Nashville’s fabled Music Row, which became the heart of Nashville’s music industry — not just country music, but also gospel music and Christian music and, in recent decades, pretty much every other kind of music. Music Row is the very definition of a cultural center, but Nashville’s cultural center didn’t spring from the mind of an urban planner. It grew up organically, as music-related businesses opened in the mid-20th century to capitalize on the growing popularity of country music. Centered on 16th and 17th Avenues, it was originally the site of recording studios (many of which have lately moved elsewhere), music-publishing firms, talent agencies, publicists and booking offices, all nestled among old bungalows and churches and human-scale commercial buildings. B.B. King and Loretta Lynn and Dolly Parton and Elvis Presley and Charley Pride all recorded there, which you probably know, but so did Bob Dylan and Neil Young and Simon & Garfunkel and the Beach Boys, which you might not. In 2015, the National Trust for Historic Preservation designated the whole district “a national treasure.” Tour buses drive up and down the streets of Music Row, their guides telling tourists the stories they came to town to hear. But the city’s explosive growth in the last decade has imperiled its own beating heart, with quaint Music Row houses and historic Music Row studios falling again and again to developers who put up fancy condominiums and trendy restaurants and shiny office buildings in their place, despite concerted efforts by individuals and historic preservation nonprofits to save the Row’s character. In 2014, we even nearly lost the iconic RCA Studio A. Back in 1987, my friend Katy’s apartment was within walking distance of the Country Music Hall of Fame (it has since moved downtown), as well as seemingly innumerable tiny “museums” dedicated to specific stars. Broke as we were, Haywood and I paid to have our picture made with a wax museum version of Dolly Parton, just to have a souvenir of our visit. It was so hot in the building that even Dolly’s wax doppelgänger is sweating in that Polaroid photo. We loved the kitsch, but what really sold us was the music. We had arrived in Nashville in time for a music festival called Summer Lights, an act-after-act marvel of unfathomable talent. Near Katy’s place on Music Row, music and cigarette smoke poured out of the neighborhood bars, and during our visit we stopped in to tap our feet and drink a beer at I don’t know how many of them. We especially loved a shabby little tavern called Bobby’s Idle Hour. Back in those days Bobby’s occupied a trailer, which I remember thinking was like a living stereotype, the kind of place that becomes the center of the story every time you talk about the time you went to Nashville. It’s nothing like the music-themed bars that now line the tourist center known as Lower Broad, where neon and big-hat country hold sway — the part of Nashville that the journalist Steve Cavendish, writing in Rolling Stone, calls the “bar industrial complex.” Bobby’s is an altogether different kind of bar. It began life in 1948 simply as the Idle Hour. By 1978, when Bobby Herald bought it and added his name to the sign, it had already been on the Row for decades, a place where songwriters and neighbors and music scouts and industry regulars gathered. On weekend afternoons, people would bring their kids to hear the music. In 2005, the Idle Hour was evicted from its longtime site — a condominium complex sits there now — and Bobby Herald and his wife, Dianne, moved the bar to its current location on 16th Avenue, eight doors down from the old trailer. Bobby died later that year, but Dianne kept the bar going. It still has autographed head shots of musicians taped to the walls, interspersed with dollar bills signed by guests. Hundreds, maybe thousands, of dollar bills, many yellowed by smoke from the years before the bar banned smoking. Lizard Thom Case, 72, bought the place in 2013 after Dianne retired, but he’d been a regular at the bar there for years before he bought it — so much of a regular that Dianne handpicked him to be Bobby’s “steward,” as Mr. Case calls himself. Even he doesn’t remember how the tradition of taping dollar bills to the walls began: “I don’t know how it started, but it grew like a fungus,” he said. His best guess: “Tourists love this place so much, they just want to leave some part of themselves here.” Visitors still come back years later, he said, and take selfies next to their own signed bills. Last summer Mr. Case’s landlord announced that he was selling the site and four adjacent buildings to a developer. (All five evicted businesses are quintessentially Music City: a clothing store called So Nashville, a guitar repair shop, a music academy, a music publisher, and Bobby’s.) Short of the kind of 11th-hour miracle that saved Studio A, Bobby’s Idle Hour (“The only live music venue on Music Row!” according to its website) would end its seven-decade run, and yet another office building would rise in its place. “Nashville doesn’t have preservation tools that other cities use as a matter of course,” Carolyn Brackett, senior field officer for the National Trust for Historic Preservation, told The Tennessean last summer. “There are practical solutions that would balance development with the preservation of Music Row’s historic fabric and retain the music businesses that fill them. We urge Mayor Briley and Metro Nashville leaders to adopt them before it’s too late.” For the current iteration of Bobby’s Idle Hour, it’s already too late. Last fall Bobby’s was named to the “Nashville 9,” an annual list of the most endangered historic places in Nashville, but this time no miracle was forthcoming. Mr. Case has until the end of the month to clear everything out. It was never his plan to retire: “If we’d been able to stay in this venue, this particular building, I could’ve kept this bar another 10 years,” he said. “I love it. I love nurturing the songwriters. I love setting up these great nights of music. It’s been my life.” I stopped by the bar on Jan. 12, the last day it was open to the public, and spoke with Josh Distad, 29, a songwriter and Minnesota native who’s been tending bar at Bobby’s for the past four years. He and three other investors, all Bobby’s regulars, had just bought the contents of the bar, along with its name, from Lizard Case. They hope to open again at a new location in the summer. Mr. Distad isn’t worried about making Bobby’s a success; Bobby’s is already a success, and he’s been studying what makes it work. But he recognizes the forces that he and his partners are up against, too. They’re considering a site just around the corner from the current Idle Hour, but there may be zoning issues to address there — it’s near a church — and other obstacles to repurposing the building as a tavern. The chief obstacle is Nashville itself. The five-year lease the building’s owner has offered is within the new owners’ price range, but they know they may well be priced out of the neighborhood again as soon as the lease is up, and they can’t afford to buy. “The real estate in this area — real estate in the city, really — is so high now that a small mom-and-pop shop just can’t succeed,” Mr. Distad said. “The lowest property we found on the market in this area is listed for a million dollars.” Even so, he believes the right place will turn up in time. The death of a neighborhood bar in a growing city is in no way a tragedy. There are much more disruptive consequences to poorly planned growth: the loss of affordable work-force housing, the destruction of a vibrant tree canopy that offsets the effects of greenhouse gases, destabilized communities and debilitating strains on aging infrastructure, among others. But cultural continuity does matter. Bobby’s Idle Hour is “part of the fabric of this town,” said Carolyn Lethgo, 29, a Middle Tennessee native and one of Mr. Distad’s co-investors. “We just want to carry on the meaning and the legacy of this place.” It’s quite a legacy. Before you even walk in the door, the big plywood guitar out front tells you that Bobby’s Idle Hour is the place you’ve been looking for, the kind of place that makes you pack up and move to a new city to start your life all over again. In part because of Bobby’s, my husband and I have been here 31 years, our entire adult lives. Jonathan Long, 72, is a songwriter from upstate New York who came here in 1971. He’s also one of the Idle Hour’s longtime bartenders: “I’ve been working here 20 years,” he told me, “but I’ve been drinking here 47.” He plans to be at work at the new Idle Hour, too, wherever it lands, even if that’s not on Music Row. I asked Mr. Long if the Nashville moment had passed, if it’s too late now for a songwriter with a dream to make a life in Nashville. He wasn’t entirely hopeless: “If it’s something you want to do, don’t even bother to come here,” he said. “If it’s something you have to do, you might want to come. But if it’s something you are, get your ass down here. It has to be who you are, or it’s not going to work.” "
5c40c4c43a125f5075c04f51,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/obituaries/bonnie-guitar-dead.html,"Bonnie Guitar, who had hit records as a country singer and guitarist, but whose biggest achievement may have been her work as a businesswoman in the male-dominated music industry, died on Jan. 12 in Soap Lake, Wash. She was 95. Howard Reitzes, a longtime friend, confirmed her death, at a rehabilitation hospital. Ms. Guitar was best known for her recording of “Dark Moon,” a Top 20 country single on the Dot label that crossed over to the pop Top 10 in 1957. The record, a haunting nocturne sung in a clear-toned alto, was, along with Patsy Cline’s “Walkin’ After Midnight” — which reached the pop Top 40 the same year — one of the earliest records by a female country singer to cross over to the pop chart. “Dark Moon,” which also made the pop Top 10 in a subsequent version by Gale Storm, earned Ms. Guitar an invitation to appear on “The Ed Sullivan Show” in June 1957. Later that year she performed “Mister Fire Eyes,” her successful follow-up to “Dark Moon,” on the TV show “American Bandstand.” But the achievement for which Ms. Guitar never really received her due, perhaps because she decided to remain in her native Washington instead of resettling in a major recording center like Los Angeles or Nashville, was her trailblazing work as a studio maven and entrepreneur. Over seven decades she did everything from engineer recordings to scout talent and run a record label. In the late 1950s, returning to Seattle after a brief tenure as a session guitarist for the producer Fabor Robison in Los Angeles, she established Dolphin Records with two local businessmen, Bob Reisdorf and Lou Lavinthal. Under her creative direction, Dolphin — which soon changed its name to Dolton — signed the Fleetwoods, a doo-wop-inspired trio of teenagers from Olympia, Wash., whose gauzy pop recordings “Come Softly to Me” and “Mr. Blue” both topped the pop chart in 1959. Ms. Guitar was credited only as the arranger on the trio’s big hits (Mr. Reisdorf, a refrigerator salesman, was listed as producer), but her role was more than such billing might suggest. “Because they had so much air in their voices, I had to do a lot of different fooling with microphones to get enough sound on the tape to saturate the tape,” Ms. Guitar said of her work with the Fleetwoods in an interview with No Depression magazine in 2006. “I knew that the sound would be interesting to people, because they were so used to the full sound. I wanted it to come out, but I wanted it to be intimate. And I knew also not to use a regular guitar sound. I put nylon strings on my guitar, and I played just little, tinkling notes behind them.” Dolton’s other landmark release under Ms. Guitar’s supervision was “Walk — Don’t Run,” a No. 2 pop hit in 1960 for the instrumental combo the Ventures, which came to be regarded as a surf-rock classic. Ms. Guitar had a minor pop hit as a performer for Dolton with a song she wrote, “Candy Apple Red.” On an album she recorded in 1959 for RCA, which went unreleased at the time but was eventually issued by Bear Family Records in 2013 under the title “Intimate Session — the Velvet Lounge,” she sang in the pop-torch mode of Peggy Lee and Julie London. Backing her on the sessions were her fellow guitarists Billy Strange and Tommy Tedesco and other future members of the famed Los Angeles studio entourage known as the Wrecking Crew. Ms. Guitar and her business partners sold the Dolton label to Liberty Records in 1963. She returned to Dot, as a recording artist, producer and talent scout, two years later. Bonnie Guitar was born Bonnie Buckingham on March 25, 1923, in Seattle. Her parents, Doris and John, raised her and her five siblings on a farm outside Auburn, Wash., some 10 miles east of the Puget Sound. Ms. Guitar’s brothers gave her their flat-top Gibson guitar when she was 13. Soon after that, she started entering local talent contests and performing in a musical revue that appeared throughout the region. She also began using the stage name Bonnie Guitar. In the early 1940s she met and started taking music lessons from the guitar teacher and inventor Paul Tutmarc. They married in 1944 and had a daughter, Paula, before parting ways in 1955. Ms. Guitar released a series of country hits for Dot in the 1960s, including three that reached the country Top 10: “A Woman in Love,” “I’m Living in Two Worlds” and “I Believe in Love.” She was named female vocalist of the year by the Academy of Country Music in 1966. In 1969 Ms. Guitar married Mario DePiano. The couple raised cattle and quarter horses together on an 80-acre ranch in Sumner, Wash., about 30 miles from Seattle. Ms. Guitar had all but retired from music business at that point, releasing only the occasional record, until her husband died in 1983. After that she started performing again, most notably as a regular at the Notaras Lodge near her home in Soap Lake. She is survived by a granddaughter, a great-granddaughter and a great-great-grandson. Her daughter died in 2013. Fewer than 5 percent of producers and engineers working in the music industry today are women, according to Women’s Audio Mission, a nonprofit organization that equips women for careers in creative technology. The number was doubtless a fraction of that when Ms. Guitar was staking her claim to a place at the controls of a recording studio. “I worked in the mixing with the engineer, but I worked as an assistant there,” she recalled to No Depression, referring to her apprenticeship with the producer Fabor Robison in Los Angeles in the 1950s. “I’d keep the records, do the cataloging and things. So I learned to operate the equipment.” “Fabor was difficult to work with,” she added, “but I didn’t care. My whole intent was to learn to produce and learn the studio.” "

Here are 10 more artists our pop music critics will be keeping an eye on in 2019. [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] When she’s gently strumming an acoustic guitar and singing about love in her reedy, tremulous mezzo-soprano, the 21-year-old Jade Bird might seem to fit a soothing, long-established singer-songwriter mold on “Love Has All Been Done Before.” But that’s only until she gets riled. Then her rock band kicks in, her voice gets rough and her words turn pointed and pitiless. And when full fury takes over, she starts spitting lines at rap speed. She’s no pushover. Her debut album is due April 19. JON PARELES This Los Angeles rapper has a quixotic, charismatic flow, spilling words past the end of lines with a pinched, tart voice that recalls the earliest Los Angeles gangster rap. On the recent mixtape “Famous Cryp,” he’s vibrant but protean, still figuring out the boundaries of his skill. But songs like “DM,” “Bleed It” and “Thotiana” are terse, bawdy and infectious. JON CARAMANICA Nicola Cruz is an electronic musician, producer and D.J. from Ecuador who has already made a reputation on the international club circuit. Instead of putting electronic sounds in the foreground, he builds tracks from loops and improvisations that are likely to come from ancient instruments, particularly Andean ones like wood flutes, percussion and small guitars — though he might also try a sitar. The artificial pieces he constructs sound oddly natural. His second album, “Siku” — named after an Andean panpipe — comes out Jan. 25. PARELES Billie Eilish’s debut album is likely to appear this year, and while she’s only 17, she is no unknown. Since her initial SoundCloud postings in 2015, her online releases have drawn hundreds of millions of Spotify streams and have made her a tour headliner. The songs she writes with her brother and producer, Finneas O’Connell, are usually hushed ballads that glance back at Lana Del Rey and Lorde. Her voice is whispery and sweetly tearful with a steely undercurrent, and it stakes out a particular persona: passionate and vulnerable but also vindictive and treacherous. Onstage, she gets thousands of voices singing along. PARELES In current country, Fleetwood Mac and the Eagles loom as large as Hank Williams and Loretta Lynn once did. Lauren Jenkins writes and sings about disappointment, disillusion, drinking and holding on despite it all with a Stevie Nicks rasp in her voice. Her debut album, “No Saint,” is set for March 15, and it surrounds her most bitter tidings with gleaming guitars and bright harmonies. PARELES LeeBrian, a young Puerto Rican rapper, is the first artist signed to the label of Sky, the producer responsible for hits by J Balvin (and others). LeeBrian is a nimble, flexible vocalist — sometimes agitated, sometimes preternaturally relaxed, and often toggling between both, like on the whimsical “Goku Sin El Ki.” CARAMANICA Lil Tjay is an exuberant, sweet-voiced singer-rapper from the Bronx with an easy instinct for melody. What helps him stand out from the current overstuffed class of artists with similar aesthetic approaches is his comfort moving between both light and dark subject matter, as on the hit “Brothers” and “Long Time.” CARAMANICA Over the past few years, this Texas native has found success in Nashville as a songwriter for Brett Eldredge among others. But listening to her recent debut album, the soothing and lovely “Borrowed Heart” — some of which was written with Lori McKenna — that work for others sounds superfluous. She’s got a sturdy, rich voice, and a way of bending a song toward sadness, where she sounds right at home. CARAMANICA The South African songwriter Nakhane Touré is also a novelist and actor whose works deal with a fraught upbringing: He broke away from conservative Christian “conversion therapy” to prize his identity as a gay man. The songs on his album “You Will Not Die” — released in Europe last year and due Feb. 22 in the United States — delve into both trauma and redemption. They ponder faith, pleasure, exile and belonging; they traverse hymns, neo-soul, South African pop and electronic dance music, and Nakhane’s voice crests in a vibrant, androgynous falsetto. Tenacity carries him toward joy. PARELES Of all the members of the YBN hip-hop collective, none shows more promise than YBN Cordae, a North Carolina rapper who specializes in thoughtful, emotionally eloquent and lyrically complex music. On songs like “Kung Fu,” he’s impressively dexterous, and of all the rappers who’ve taken swipes at J. Cole recently, only he handed any blows. CARAMANICA "
5cb4c71149f0eacbf1f8444d,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/15/arts/music/khalid-free-spirit-billboard-chart.html,"Khalid hit No. 1 on the Billboard 200 this week, bumping Billie Eilish from the top slot. Khalid, who was nominated for five Grammys last year, including best new artist, reached No. 1 on Billboard’s album chart for the first time with his second album, “Free Spirit” (Right Hand Music Group/RCA). It sold 85,000 copies as a full album in the United States — helped by a bundling deal that included it with the cost of concert tickets — but also performed well on streaming services, with 147 million streams last week, according to Nielsen. That added up to the equivalent of 202,000 album sales. Eilish, the 17-year-old singer and songwriter who made a splash on last week’s chart, was bumped to No. 2 with “When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?,” and Nipsey Hussle’s year-old “Victory Lap,” which re-entered the chart last week after the rapper was killed at age 33, fell one spot to No. 3. Also this week, Ariana Grande’s “Thank U, Next” is in fourth place, Juice WRLD’s “Death Race for Love” holds at No. 5, and Sara Bareilles’s “Amidst the Chaos” opens at No. 6. Lil Nas X’s song “Old Town Road” holds at No. 1 on Billboard’s Hot 100 pop singles chart, with record-setting streaming numbers. The track, which now includes Billy Ray Cyrus in a remix version, was streamed 142 million times in the United States last week, according to Nielsen. That easily beat the 116 million streams Drake had for “In My Feelings” last July, and it is also nearly four times as many as the No. 2 song on this week’s chart, “Sunflower” by Post Malone and Swae Lee, which had 36.5 million. But “Old Town Road” is still not on Billboard’s Hot Country Songs list, after being removed last month for being insufficiently country. One big reason: The song is largely being ignored by mainstream country radio stations, although it is on many country-themed playlists on streaming services. "
5cb441e849f0eacbf1f8419c,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/15/world/asia/indonesia-election-islam.html,"JAKARTA, Indonesia — Joko Widodo, the Muslim president of Indonesia, is into heavy metal and saving Christians. Earlier in his political career, he helped shelter ethnic Chinese Christians during deadly rioting. And upon winning the presidency in 2014, Mr. Joko filled his cabinet with women and banned a radical Islamic group that calls for Islamic law to replace Indonesia’s democracy. His election was seen as a victory for the moderate Islam that has long flourished in this country. But this time around, as he runs for re-election on Wednesday against a pugnacious former general who has embraced the language of hard-line, Middle Eastern Islam, Mr. Joko is veering rightward. At a Saturday campaign rally, he pointedly gave thanks to Muslim preachers, and on Sunday he visited Mecca. For his vice-presidential running mate, Mr. Joko chose Ma’ruf Amin, the 76-year-old head of the Indonesian Ulema Council, which has issued fatwas against homosexuality and the wearing of Santa hats by Muslims. No hip-gyrating traditional dancing, no premarital sex and certainly no headbanging heavy metal allowed. Nearly 5,000 miles from the birthplace of Islam, Indonesia, the nation with the world’s largest Muslim population, has been widely seen as proof that Islam and democracy can coexist and prosper. “Indonesia is a country with more than 260 million people, with a geographical area of at least 17,000 islands,” Lukman Hakim Saifuddin, Indonesia’s minister of religious affairs, said in an interview. “People still treasure and respect the diversity, the differences.” Yet as the Muslim world has wrestled with Islam’s role in modern society, Indonesia, too, has engaged in a national spiritual reckoning. In recent years, the country’s Muslim majority has embraced more overt signs of religiosity and shifted toward Arab-style devotion: flowing clothes and veils, Arabic names and Middle Eastern devotional architecture. Most of all, a puritanical Salafist interpretation of Islam, which draws inspiration from the age of the Prophet Muhammad, is attracting followers in Indonesia. Bureaucrats steeped in austere Wahhabism draw converts in government prayer halls. Hundreds of Indonesians joined the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, and hundreds of thousands more cheer for the group on social media. Pushed aside are the syncretic traditions that were long the hallmark of Indonesian Islam, a blending with indigenous beliefs that gave the faith its distinct local flavor. “In Indonesia, Salafi ideology has penetrated urban and rural, civil servants and villagers,” said Din Wahid, a theologian at Syarif Hidayatullah State Islamic University. “They see corruption all around them and say that it is only Shariah and restoring a caliphate that will be able to fix society.” Mr. Joko’s opponent in the election on Wednesday, Prabowo Subianto — the European-educated son of a Christian and a connoisseur of fine wines — may seem an unlikely figurehead for hard-line Islam. But he is an astute politician who has shouted for jihad and vowed to welcome home from self-imposed exile Rizieq Shihab, the head of the Islamic Defenders Front, which gained notoriety for attacking nightclubs in Jakarta, the capital, and calling for Shariah law. “Political Islam has strengthened tremendously over the last two decades in Indonesia,” said Andreas Harsono, an Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch and author of the new book “Race, Islam and Power.” “We should be very concerned, because both sides in the campaign have now made human rights and democracy decline.” Faith politics exploded in late 2016 when millions of Indonesians marched in the streets of Jakarta to protest what they considered blasphemous language from Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, a Christian who was then the Jakarta governor. Mr. Ma’ruf, Mr. Joko’s surprising choice of running mate this year, was one of the drivers of those protests. Mr. Basuki, widely known as Ahok, was jailed for 20 months. Mr. Joko declined to defend his former deputy. “Ahok’s downfall was because of populism, like Trump or Brexit,” said Zuhairi Misrawi, a researcher for Nahdlatul Ulama, the world’s largest Islamic social organization, which promotes moderate Islam. “Now, political parties are aiming to get more votes by showing how Islamic they are, and it is changing our Indonesian political identity.” Even Mr. Lukman, the religious affairs minister under Mr. Joko, tries to thread the needle on the role of faith in Indonesian society. “Indonesia is not officially an Islamic state,” he said, sitting in an office decorated solely with Muslim art. “But Indonesia is also not a secular state.” Islam arrived in Indonesia through Arab and Indian merchants. By the 16th century, the faith had displaced or cross-pollinated with Buddhism, Hinduism and animist faiths. Most Muslims here still practice a fusion form of the faith. Traditional Indonesian mosques had thatched or pitched roofs, reminiscent of Hindu temples. Indonesian Muslim festivals feature offerings of flowers to volcanoes. The national dress for women includes a lacy, body-hugging blouse. Beginning in the 1980s, Saudi money began changing the look of Islam in Indonesia. Open-air mosques were replaced by marble, domed edifices. Today, thousands of mosques around the country bear Middle Eastern motifs attesting to their Saudi, Qatari or Kuwaiti funding. Perhaps the most influential Saudi investment in Indonesia is the Institute for the Study of Islam and Arabic, known by the Indonesian acronym, Lipia, where classes are segregated by gender and teach the fundamentalist Wahhabi theology that dominates in Saudi Arabia. “Even though Indonesian Islam is a syncretic, cultural Islam, we are taught that anything from Saudi, the country of Mecca and Medina, must be authentic and good,” said Ulil Abshar Abdalla, the coordinator of the Liberal Islam Network, who studied at Lipia. The university has produced some of Indonesia’s most renowned Islamic scholars. But it has also nurtured militants linked to terrorist attacks across Southeast Asia. Over the past two years, Lipia has expanded across the country, opening at least three new campuses in a country with a shortage of universities. Mainstream Indonesian Muslim leaders resent the inroads that Saudi-inspired Salafism has made here. “Wahhabism is against our culture, and our religion is totally different from the Middle East,” said Mr. Zuhairi of Nahdlatul Ulama, who is helping set up an online presence to compete against the puritanical websites popular with young Indonesians. “Our war is to get moderate Islam to fight for millennial Muslims who are hungry for Islam,” he said. “But people don’t see us as passionate, as charismatic. It’s hard to change this.” The flowering of a more conservative Islam in Indonesia accelerated after the overthrow of Suharto in 1998, after more than three decades of corrupt, dictatorial rule. What followed was a federalist exuberance that gave local governments newfound authority. The province of Aceh, for example, is now under Shariah, with public flogging for adulterers or those who drink alcohol. “Salafism is a magnet for people because it’s very simple and easy to understand,” said Mr. Ulil of the Liberal Islam Network. “It gives the impression that it’s based on prophetic, pure scripture while others, like us, are not authoritative.” When Zaenal Abidin started building a Salafist community on the outskirts of Jakarta in 1998, three families joined him. Now there are 300, many of them middle-class government employees, who send their children to Mr. Zaenal’s Islamic school. “We were colonized for so long by Christians, so we have an inferiority complex,” he said. “But this is a country with the world’s largest number of Muslims, so we must show our true Islamic nature.” As it has elsewhere in the Muslim world, conservative dress has become more common in Indonesia. Polygamy and child marriage are also on the rise here, as democracy has allowed personal freedoms repressed during the Suharto era to prosper. “Radical groups understand that they can use democracy to their advantage,” said Musdah Mulia, a professor of Islamic political thought at Syarif Hidayatullah State Islamic University. “They say that democracy is bad because it allows infidels to have a vote, but then they manipulate it for themselves.” "
5c94c69149f0eacbf105e795,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/22/arts/music/silvana-imam.html,"STOCKHOLM — On a recent Friday night, the Swedish rapper Silvana Imam appeared on stage at Annexet, a concert venue in the south side of Stockholm, dressed like a comic-book villain. Her face hidden by a black mask studded with spikes, she dragged a metal baseball bat across the stage to the loud cheers of her mostly female audience. The menacing display was a theatrical embodiment of the gleefully confrontational role Imam, the lesbian daughter of refugees, has come to play in Swedish pop culture. Imam, whose mother is Lithuanian and father Syrian, is one of the country’s best-known hip-hop artists, and a symbol of the counterreaction to the rise of right-wing populism in Scandinavia’s most populous country. When the mask came off, Imam, 32, launched into “I Min Zon” (“In My Zone”), a languid, withering song from her first EP, in which she rails against racism and sexism in the country. “Fifteen million people in the world are named Mohamed,” she rapped in Swedish, “but whose name do they want to see on the résumé?” Mattias Naxe, 30, a lighting designer in the audience, said that he was drawn to Imam’s music primarily because she was a “very good rapper,” but added that her success was also a reflection of Sweden’s polarized political climate. In last fall’s national election, the right-wing populist Sweden Democrats won 18 percent of the vote, making them the country’s third-largest party. “She came at the right time,” he said, adding that she “very much” represents this particular moment. Although Sweden is known for being one of the world’s premier suppliers of dance-pop, it also has one of Europe’s most vibrant hip-hop scenes. Imam is one of its biggest female stars. In 2014, her breakout single “IMAM,” a political song in which she refers to herself as a “176 centimeter Pussy Riot,” reached number one in the Swedish charts. Since then, she has won numerous awards, including a Swedish Grammi, the country’s equivalent to a Grammy Award, for artist of the year. Her most recent album, “Helig Moder” (“Holy Mother”), released in February, has been widely praised in the Swedish news media, and she was recently announced as the opening act for the main stage of the renowned Roskilde Music Festival in Denmark. In an interview in a coffee shop in the Hornstull neighborhood of Stockholm, where she lives, Imam said she had struggled with the pressure of her success and the fallout from her position as a political provocateur. She explained that her new album was an attempt to come to terms with the “superhero everyone wants me to be, or the one that I’ve become in Scandinavia for a lot of people.” Although Sweden is often seen internationally as a paragon of social liberalism, many of Imam’s songs have highlighted the racism, misogyny and homophobia she believes permeate society here. Her 2015 single “Imam Cobain” included a frequently quoted line instructing the men who “say my love is a crime” to “go and kiss” a “swastika.” Another song called out people offended by the fact that she is a “hybrid,” with Syrian roots. The rise of the Sweden Democrats, she argued, only goes to prove her point. The party, whose slogans include “Keep Sweden Swedish,” has its roots in the neo-Nazi movement and campaigned on severely limiting immigration. “Sweden is finally revealing itself for what it is,” Imam said. The rapper was born in 1986 in communist Lithuania, but her family moved to what was then Czechoslovakia when she was a toddler. When her father, a journalist and lawyer, came under pressure there because of his far-left politics, the family fled to Kiruna, Sweden’s northernmost city, which she described as “very cold” and “with no people of color.” After the family relocated to Stockholm, Imam attended a school in the suburbs where she said there were “neo-Nazis and immigrants, and nothing in between.” A longtime fan of the Fugees and Kanye West, she started performing while completing her degree in English and psychology at the University of Stockholm. Her anger at the far right was galvanized in 2013, when Jimmie Akesson, the leader of the Sweden Democrats, retweeted a photo of her performing at a protest against the far right while wearing a jacket bearing a crossed-out “S.D.,” the party’s initials. The song she performed included the line, “send the pigs to slaughter,” referring to members of the party. Afterward, she received threats from his supporters. “He knew what he was doing. He knew what kinds of followers he had,” she said. The debate around refugees in Sweden, she argued, has become untethered from reality. “The claim that we can’t afford the refugees isn’t fact-based,” Imam said. Tax avoidance by large companies was a bigger drain on the economy, she added. In 2015, one of Imam’s cousins was among the many thousands of migrants attempting to make their way across the Mediterranean into Europe after the outbreak of the Syrian civil war. The incident, she recalled, affected her deeply. “She sent me a photo of her boat, with just water and three sandwiches, and I thought this was crazy,” she said. The cousin and her two children ultimately ended up in Denmark. Ametist Azordegan, a radio host and producer currently writing a book about Swedish hip-hop, described Imam by phone as one of the country’s “top hip-hop artists” and one of the “absolute best” lyricists, and argued that she “has built a space for gay, young women that hasn’t existed in the media in Sweden.” Christina Tsiobanelis, one of the three co-directors of “Silvana,” a documentary about Imam’s early career that played in movie theaters around Europe, said in a phone interview that the rapper’s success coincided with not only the rise of the far right, but also the growth of an increasingly vocal feminist movement in the country. “If she had come up three years earlier, she might not have become that successful,” she said. The film, which won a Guldbagge Award, the Swedish equivalent of an Oscar, for best documentary, also chronicled the beginnings of Imam’s relationship with Beatrice Eli, a Swedish pop singer. The two remain together, and have recorded several duets. In Imam’s view, they are the country’s first prominent lesbian couple to be “cool and young.” She added, after a pause, “and hot.” At Annexet, Eli appeared on stage to perform with Imam in “Magi Som Orlando,” a sexually charged duet. They pressed into each other as the crowd cheered. Then, a few minutes later, the stage turned into a raucous celebration reflecting Imam’s cultural and sexual identities. Two belly dancers and a row of women in traditional Arab costume gyrated on the stage, while another dancer balanced on her head. Silvana jumped up and down, laughing. “Silvana is a symbol for the new Swedish girl,” said Leonora Haag, 20, who watched in the audience. “Swedish people are very much a collective, you don’t stand out. What’s amazing about her is that she just doesn’t care.” "
5c69cf843a125f5075c0a2e8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/17/obituaries/u-tin-dead.html,"U Tin, a slide guitarist who became a global ambassador for Burmese music while working as a plumber under a military dictatorship, died on Feb. 5 in Yangon, Myanmar. He was 87. His daughter Daw Win Win Toe said the cause was complications of diabetes. Mr. Tin was one of several prominent Myanmar musicians who incorporated Western instruments into a diverse canon that spanned folk tunes, classical Burmese music linked to ancient royal courts, and songs from the country’s 1950s-era cinematic golden age. In addition to guitar, he played banjo, mandolin and Burmese harp. Mr. Tin moved to Yangon in 1947, a year before the country, then known as Burma, gained independence from Britain. He found work as a plumber and began studying music. After a military coup in 1962 plunged Myanmar into decades of isolation and extreme poverty, Mr. Tin kept his day job and mostly steered clear of the regime’s state-sponsored traditional music and dance troupes. But he kept playing music, and his reputation as a brilliant slide guitarist grew, thanks partly to people outside Myanmar who invited him to perform around the globe. U Tin was born in the southwestern town of Kyaik Lat on July 8, 1931, to U Ba Aye and Daw Than Yi, both farmers. When World War II broke out, many residents of nearby Yangon, then known as Rangoon, fled to the surrounding countryside as the city came under attack by Japanese bombers. Some of them turned up in Mr. Tin’s town, and they happened to be musicians. “I got the chance to learn from them,” he said years later. Mr. Tin’s main instrument was a steel resonator guitar, similar to one played in American blues and country music by performers like Jerry Douglas and Son House. He played it sitting down, with the fretboard lying over his lap. It is unclear precisely how these guitars, which have roots in Hawaiian music, made it to Myanmar. One influence appears to have been Tau Moe, a Samoan guitarist who had been educated in Hawaii and performed in Yangon in the late 1920s, said Kit Young, a Washington-based scholar of Burmese music and a founder of Gitameit Music Institute, a nonprofit community center and music school in Yangon. But Mr. Tin was not much interested in the American style. Instead, he tuned his guitar to a Burmese scale and played within the rich musical terrain he already knew. Traditional Burmese music, from the country’s Bamar ethnic majority, features gongs, drums, harps, oboes and bamboo xylophones, among other instruments. It typically has syncopated, staggered phrasing and a tonal system unfamiliar to most Western listeners. Over the years, Mr. Tin studied with some of Myanmar’s finest musicians, including the guitarists Weiza Ba Saw Gyi and U Sein Maung and the singer and harpist Daw Saw Mya Aye Kyi, who had herself learned from court musicians for King Thibaw, the country’s last king. He also played with several musicians who had made their name in Yangon’s post-independence cultural heyday. A video from 1961 shows him playing with the Burmese singer U Aunt Gyi (and two Americans) on the lawn of the American ambassador’s residence. “We called him the living music dictionary,” said U Ne Myo Aung, the director of Gitameit Music Institute. In addition to his daughter Daw Win Win Toe, Mr. Tin is survived by his wife, Daw Cho Cho; two other daughters, Daw Win Win Nwe and Daw Myint Myint Nwe; and six grandchildren. His three sons died before him. Mr. Tin won a number of national prizes and played on the Burma Broadcasting Service. But there was never much money in that, and he kept working as a plumber at the Yangon City Development Committee until he was 60. Ms. Young said that Mr. Tin did not “kowtow” to the military junta that ruled the country for decades, and that the regime would not have wanted to send him abroad because the slide guitar was not a traditional Burmese instrument. But in the twilight of his career, Mr. Tin was often invited privately to perform abroad as an ambassador of that very tradition. He performed in Japan, Thailand, Germany, the Philippines and elsewhere. Ms. Young said his performances often received rapturous receptions, including a 2003 concert at the Asia Society in New York City. “Everybody went bananas,” she said. In his later years, Mr. Tin also worked at Gitameit Music Institute. He saw his mission as to somehow keep the old songs he knew alive. But the younger generation was not interested, he told a reporter in 2010, around the time that a half-century of repressive military rule was beginning to ease. “If the music is lost,” he said, “Myanmar will lose a piece of its soul.” "

5c6d3a283a125f5075c0a924,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/20/world/asia/k-pop-identical-korea.html,"HONG KONG — Doe-eyed with delicate features. A sharp jawline and willowy figure. Fair skin so clear it almost glows. With many South Korean pop idols fitting that description in their sleekly produced music videos, their mass appeal has many of the country’s young people wanting to look just like them. But in an effort to tone down their influence in a beauty-obsessed country where plastic surgery is rampant, South Korea’s government is trying to limit the stars’ presence on television, saying they look too much alike. “Are all the singers on television music programs twins?” the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family wrote about the stars of K-pop, as their music is known, in broadcast guidelines released this month, according to The Korea Times. “They seriously look identical,” it said, adding that many pop idol groups’ musical styles were “just as limited as their appearances.” The guidelines drew such criticism from fans that on Tuesday the ministry apologized for “causing unnecessary confusion,” and said that some of the recommendations would be removed or reviewed, the news agency Agence France-Presse reported. Some compared the guidelines to the censorship imposed during the country’s military dictatorship during the latter half of the 20th century. An online petition, calling for the ministry to be dissolved, read, “The ministry has dared to point out female idols for being too pretty, wearing the same clothes and being skinny,” according to the newspaper Korea Joongang Daily. Ha Tae-kyung, a politician from an opposition party, compared the guidelines — which the gender ministry said applied to both female and male performers — to restrictions on hair and skirt lengths during the dictatorship. “There are no objective standards to people’s looks,” he wrote in a Facebook post on Saturday. It wasn’t the first time Mr. Ha had defended influential K-pop band members. Last year, he called for them to be exempt from the county’s military draft, since top classical musicians are given exemptions. The guidelines were intended to make television a more benevolent experience. Ministry officials said on Monday that viewers worried that television shows “exacerbate inequalities and gender stereotypes, rather than fixing it,” the Korea Joongang Daily reported. In the guidelines, officials suggested that shows avoid featuring performers “whose appearances are exceedingly similar” in the same program. One in three South Korean women have undergone cosmetic surgery between the ages of 19 and 29, a  Gallup Korea poll has found — a trend that mirrors the narrow beauty standards epitomized by K-pop stars. Some South Koreans have openly celebrated having cosmetic surgery, documenting their physical transformations as a rite of passage. In a pair of videos called “Getting Pretty Before” and “Getting Pretty After,” members of the K-pop group SixBomb giddily went for manicures between appointments at a plastic surgeon, where their faces were prodded and poked. “Getting Pretty After” showed them wearing pink bodysuits in an operating room, prancing out afterward with altered faces.

Just want the music? Listen to the Playlist on Spotify here (or find our profile: nytimes). Like what you hear? Let us know at theplaylist@nytimes.com and sign up for our Louder newsletter, a once-a-week blast of our pop music coverage. Long before the English-speaking pop mainstream took real notice, BTS were already global pop stars. The successes the K-pop outfit have had in this country happened largely without worrying about how it might or might not fit in. On its new release, “Map of the Soul: Persona,” it showcases its highest-profile collaborations to date in a way that preserves its core strengths. The shimmering “Boy With Luv” features Halsey — but more importantly, it features Halsey singing in Korean, exactly the sort of bilingual exchange that’s all too rare. And “Make It Right” is in part written by Ed Sheeran. It has some of his signature soft-soul gestures, but BTS renders them with complexity. The least comfortable collaborations are the ones in which the balance of power is wildly uneven, where one party badly needs something from the other. But all you hear on these songs is mutual respect. JON CARAMANICA The first new song in two years from Steve Lacy — who plays in the space-soul outfit the Internet and has collaborated with Blood Orange, Vampire Weekend and others — is a narcotically mellow inversion of casually strutting 1970s R&B. On the one hand, it’s about yearning, with Lacy’s vocals aquatically damp; but on the other, Lacy is far too at ease — far too chill — to really break a sweat. CARAMANICA “So Good” is elegantly rendered, built-by-hand disco from Omar Apollo, one of several strong songs from his impressive new EP, “Friends.” For the last two years, he’s been releasing songs that were sharp but felt tentative, as if he was worried about overstepping boundaries. But on “Friends,” he moves toward the upbeat and joyful, and sounds more free than ever. CARAMANICA Lead singers with Sounds of Blackness — Ann Nesby, Big Jim Wright and Lauren Evans — spill over one another with overlapping gospel praise in “Til I Found You,” the first single from a new collection by the producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis with various collaborators. The track is built on an easygoing beat and rippling guitar lines, but the singers turn it into an urgent competition to extol the comforts of faith. JON PARELES “I can make your dreams come true/if you let me listen in on you,” Yeasayer’s Anand Wilder sings, as if he’s Alexa or Siri or some present or near-future authoritarian state. That’s the sweet chorus; the verses are far more paranoid, with no more comfort to offer than, “Don’t look so guilty, you’ve got nothing to hide.” In a lilt with an electronic pulse — glancing back at the Cars — Yeasayer pinpoints where the promise of convenience meets the threat of constant surveillance. PARELES This exuberant romp about the upsides of getting rich quick is effective and fun, but it’s more intriguing for the performers it brings together, a union of singer-rappers of North African heritage: Geko, born in Manchester, England, is of Libyan and Algerian descent; Ay Em, from London, of Egyptian and Moroccan heritage; and French Montana, who grew up in the Bronx but was born in Morocco. Each has a particular take on the blurry line between rapping and melody. To be fair, French Montana mostly phones in his mumbles, but Geko and Ay Em make for a winning tag team. Geko, a strong rapper, sings with a light touch, and Ay Em provides aural and spiritual ballast: “I just did my prayer, then you know it’s back to business.” CARAMANICA In Courtney Barnett’s latest two-chord stomp — well, three in the chorus — she’s even blunter than usual about self-doubt and alienation: “I feel stupid, I feel useless, I feel insane,” she begins. But as she finds a defensive posture — “We’re gonna tell everyone it’s O.K.,” she sings with a laugh — the band cranks up, organ and tambourine pile on and voices join her for a rowdy singalong. She may be insecure and alienated, but she’s far from alone. PARELES With tolling chimes, a growly high-drama vocal, a minor-mode melody, a verse about death and an arena-scale drumbeat, “God’s Country” verges on goth metal, with only a little bit of slide guitar and devout lyrics to qualify it as country. It’s Blake Shelton’s latest paean to rural life, a song about hard-working, churchgoing farmers that’s not cozy and nostalgic, but grimly fatalistic. PARELES The guitarist Bill Frisell and the bassist Thomas Morgan released their first duets album two years ago, a collection of performances that smoldered like warm coals and bespoke an easygoing, simpatico new partnership. Now they’re back with “Epistrophy,” an entire album of covers. It closes with this rendition of “In the Wee Small Hours of the Morning,” honoring the old Sinatra ballad’s melancholy theme but still animated by Frisell’s ebullient warmth. And all the while there is Morgan’s virtuoso flexibility; he’s as responsive as he is grounded and firm. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO With Abrams, a veteran bassist affiliated with Chicago’s broad-minded experimental jazz community, it makes less sense to speak of tracks than to talk about stories. Each of the four lengthy performances on his new album with Natural Information Society unfolds slowly and consequentially, with a sense of abstract narrative. On the nearly 24-minute “In Memory’s Prism,” Abrams keeps the underlying bass line — played on the guembri, and indebted to North African music — almost unchanged while the harmony and instrumentation slowly shift above. (At various times, there’s harmonium and trumpet and autoharp and bass clarinet in there, to name a few.) It all has the implacable momentum of migration, or the feeling of a big new idea just coming into being. At the very least, it will put your mind in a place of peaceful wandering; by the end, you’re likely to wind up deep in your own imagination, remembering or inventing a story of your own. RUSSONELLO If this track is any indication, Josephine Wiggs’s solo album due May 17, “We Fall,” is a far cry from her stint as a founder and bassist in the Breeders. “Time Does Not Bring Relief” is a droney, Minimalist instrumental built on echoing piano figures, a major chord with a recurring dissonance, quiet glitchy sounds and fleeting appearances from string-section lines and a drumbeat. It’s meditative, while it hints at unresolved tensions. PARELES "
5c5b436e3a125f5075c085bd,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/06/arts/music/21-savage-ice-atlanta-rapper.html,"The video for “A Lot,” 21 Savage’s elegiac single, takes place at a formal dinner and party in a cloud-high mansion, a lavish and exuberant celebration of black wealth. But there’s a moving sequence midway through that suggests trouble just beneath the surface. The cuts are quick — warm shots of confident guests at the dinner table interspersed with darker scenes in which they’re suffering: poor health, financial hardship, criminal past, abuse, death of a loved one. The message of the video isn’t exactly that nothing is as it seems, but more that where you end up may be far from where you came from, and that success doesn’t cure all obstacles. When 21 Savage first emerged in 2015, he was a cold brutalist of a rapper whose verses verged on the dead-eyed. But just a few years on, he’s taken a turn to the reflective. Later in the video, he added a ruminative new verse to the song, rapping, “Went through some things, but I couldn’t imagine my kids stuck at the border,” directly addressing the current administration’s divisive immigration policies. [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] On Sunday, just a couple of days after that video’s release, 21 Savage was arrested by agents of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which said he was in this country illegally and placed him into deportation proceedings. As of Wednesday afternoon, he remained in ICE custody. Is 21 Savage American? By any measurement other than citizenship, yes. He was born She’yaa Bin Abraham-Joseph in England in 1992. According to Charles Kuck, one of his immigration attorneys, he came to the United States at age 7 and has been here continuously ever since, apart from a one-month period in 2005. He then re-entered the country on an H-4 visa, which expired in 2006, leaving him without legal status. But the events of the last few days underscore the ways in which the hard power of government authority and soft power of online conversation can align in peculiar and insidious ways. As news began to spread on social media of 21 Savage’s arrest on Sunday, the meme and joke ecosystem that uses trauma as oxygen went into overdrive, reacting with special intensity to the revelation that 21 Savage — one of the titans of Atlanta’s rap scene — was in fact British. As the government put his relationship with this country in peril, thousands of people chirped in online to poke at the unlikeliness, and precariousness, of his situation. That 21 Savage is in fact a British national is, ultimately, not particularly revelatory, or even meaningful. Foreign-born residents made up 13.7 percent of the United States population in 2017, according to the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey, published last year (which includes those in the country legally and illegally). Most of the humor turned on a high-society caricature understanding of England, and the dissonance of locating someone like 21 Savage — a seen-it-all stoicist with a dagger tattooed on his forehead — inside it. By and large, those people overlooked, or didn’t think as far as, the more odious association: that of empire and colonization. (His mother’s family hails from Dominica, a former British colony in the West Indies.) His success, however, is especially American. Growing up in some of Atlanta’s poorest communities, 21 Savage had a troubled childhood. He’s said that he dropped out of school to sell drugs, and has spoken in interviews of a youth marked by violence and crime. But after losing a close friend and a brother to gun violence, he turned to rapping. And within a year, he was one of Atlanta’s most promising prospects. He’s since worked with Drake, Cardi B and Post Malone. His 2017 debut album, “Issa Album,” went gold, and his second studio album, “I Am > I Was,” released in December, debuted at the top of the Billboard album chart. At this Sunday’s Grammy Awards, 21 Savage is nominated in two categories. He has also been maturing in the public eye — advocating for gun control, donating money to educate young people in Atlanta on financial literacy (an announcement made on Ellen DeGeneres’s show, of all places), even walking alongside then-girlfriend Amber Rose in 2017 at her SlutWalk, a women’s empowerment event, carrying a sign that read “I’m a Hoe Too.” This is the American promise, no? To start from nothing and turn it into a bounty. To receive a cruel hand and still emerge victorious. And yet there is this other American promise, or threat, which is that all that comfort can be easily ripped away if it isn’t achieved in the correct fashion. In the case of 21 Savage, whose public image was built on a kind of impenetrable toughness mixed with weary resilience, this moment of vulnerability was destabilizing. Even in his most intimate music, he never presents as anything other than an agent of control. But the immigration system is beyond his jurisdiction, even though, since becoming a public figure, he has taken steps to address his status. According to a statement released by his attorneys on Tuesday, in 2017 he applied for a U visa, which, according to United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, can be issued by the government to crime victims “who have suffered mental or physical abuse and are helpful to law enforcement or government officials in the investigation or prosecution of criminal activity.” 21 Savage has said he was shot in 2013. The statement did not specify whether he cooperated with authorities. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that 21 Savage was arrested at the same time DeKalb County police arrested another rapper, Young Nudy, on unrelated charges. But 21 Savage was detained directly by ICE, Kuck said. 21 Savage also was convicted on felony drug charges in 2014. The conviction record was expunged in September 2018 as part of Georgia’s first-offender program and the files have been sealed, according to Jacoby Hudson, who represented 21 Savage in the matter. (Though expunged convictions have been used in deportation proceedings, 21 Savage would be eligible for removal simply for the overstayed visa.) 21 Savage is now among the highest-profile immigration detainees, his situation instantly becoming a flash point in national conversations about people living in this country without legal status, and in dialogues about the ways in which immigrants contribute to American society. A petition asking for his release started by Black Lives Matter has amassed over 200,000 signatures. A star who built his own success, 21 Savage has in one fell swoop re-emerged as someone in need of protection. But in his recent music and public life, his identity was already becoming more complex and nuanced, delivering tales about the horrors of life at the bottom salted with a fresh understanding of just how slippery it can be at the top. "
5c80210b49f0eacbf105bae8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/06/arts/music/nakhane-you-will-not-die.html,"LONDON — To command stages and mesmerize crowds, musicians often have to be larger than life: a bigger head, a heavier foot. But Nakhane slipped quietly into a grand London hotel late one Sunday last month, soft-stepping even in combat boots, taking up little space in a corner armchair with a feline kind of grace. Nakhane, 31, who was born Nakhane Mavuso and has used Nakhane Touré as an artist name, had shrugged off the opportunity to show off his East End neighborhood, his home since moving from South Africa in 2018. “My life has always been internal,” he said. “Journalists say, ‘Take us to your favorite places,’ and I never had them. I don’t go anywhere except to the coffee shop around the corner.” Nakhane’s music, on the other hand, stretches up and out. His voice — grand, sweeping, choir-trained and soul-stirred — is a trumpet blast. And his new album, “You Will Not Die,” released last year in Europe and Africa and in the United States last month, is an LP of aching contradictions, at once sensual and spiritual, wrestling with faith, love, lust and country. Nakhane’s music has an orchestral grandeur and a quicksilver soul. Raised by an aunt who sang opera, he grew up to a score of Handel, Mozart and Bach, to which his aunt eventually added Marvin Gaye and the O’Jays. But the glamorous spirit of David Bowie hovers over the record, too, and when Nakhane began working with the producer Ben Christophers (Bat for Lashes), the singer told him, “Let’s take the second side of ‘Low’ and write songs with it, but as if it was in the streets of South Africa.” For the moment, though, he has given up South Africa for a life abroad. In his home country, Nakhane, who is queer, has been threatened with both death and damnation. He wrote “You Will Not Die” after leaving his church, for which he had evangelized an anti-gay theology. He ultimately left the country after starring in “The Wound,” a film that set a gay love plot against the backdrop of the traditional initiation ritual for Xhosa boys. The film was a hit on the festival circuit and was South Africa’s submission to the Academy Awards. But it also drew fury for revealing intimate details of the Ulwaluko, the circumcision ceremony he underwent as a young man, and for showing that gayness, far from being a foreign infection as some South Africans prefer to believe, exists among the Xhosa, too. “I still can’t go home to Port Elizabeth,” he said of the city on the Eastern Cape where he grew up. “I know my people. We are very passionate people.” South Africa is relatively permissive on L.G.B.T.Q. issues, but the churches he and his family attended were rigidly doctrinaire. So despite coming out at 17 to his friends and 19 to his family, Nakhane renounced being gay after a chance meeting with a pastor’s son at the record shop where he worked. He threw himself into the church, attending bible studies, singing in the church band and preaching the possibility of conversion. Eventually, buckling under the strain of denying himself — coupled with a growing awareness of the colonialist implications of the church’s teachings, and a racist dynamic he could no longer ignore — he left. “I’m not angry at it anymore,” Nakhane said of his life then. He has removed those he knew in the church from his life, he said, but has less venom for them than the press would wish, he added. “They did love me,” he said. “This is all they knew.” What he knew was the destiny he believed in for himself. “You are going to be one of the most important South African artists to come out of this country,” he recalled telling himself while still a student in Johannesburg. “You don’t know when. You don’t know how. But it’s going to happen. And the work starts now.” The work started with “Brave Confusion,” a folksy 2013 album released in South Africa that performed better critically than commercially. But it was the collapse of all that he knew — his exit from the church after six years, a period of financial hardship and quasi-homelessness — that led to the emotional breakthroughs he explores on “You Will Not Die.” Even for someone who had grown up thinking of songwriting as a form of divine inspiration (“It seemed like such a priestly job. You’ve been chosen to write a song”), being chosen is not an uncomplicated blessing, and Nakhane is not romantic about the alchemy of turning experience in art. His work, as he described it, is taking the “shrapnel” of inspiration and forming it into something. “Songs are dangerous,” he said. “Art is dangerous. And painful. You do it because you have to.” For all its pain and longing, “You Will Not Die” is not bleak: It tracks a long arc toward joy. “Interloper” is dark but up-tempo — self-affirmation to a propulsive beat. “Never live in fear again, no, never again,” is the chorus of “New Brighton,” a single recorded with Anohni, whose music has sonic parallels with Nakhane’s own. The two never met, Anohni said in an email, and completed the track separately. But she called it “exuberant and so heartbreaking,” and Nakhane’s music “very beautiful and soulful and smoldering.” His fearlessness is drawing admirers. Madonna called him one of her favorite artists, and the filmmaker John Cameron Mitchell cast him in his new project, a musical radio-play-by-podcast called “Anthem: Homunculus,” which will debut in late April. “To me, he is some kind of love child of James Baldwin, David Bowie and Grace Jones,” Mitchell said. “He’s the most exciting new renaissance artist I’ve seen this century.” For now, Nakhane is adjusting to his own new horizons: living in London with a boyfriend, touring his music, beginning to write more. (He is at work on what may turn into his second novel.) He is back on good terms with his family, and spiritual, if no longer religious, about the unique privilege of being Nakhane. “Someone like me could never have existed in any other era than now,” he said. “The fact that I have an album being released internationally, being an out, political, queer black person who speaks his mind and makes good music? My existence is miraculous.” "

The same could be said of music. In uncertain times, it is often musicians who are quickest and best able to express our underlying anxieties, and their work is stronger for it. Accordingly, we asked four artists, Stephen Malkmus, Kelsey Lu, Bonnie “Prince” Billy and Meg Baird to write and record original songs that meditate on the theme of America in 2024. Each artist took this prompt in a different direction. From the distorted techno of Malkmus’s track “Airplane Air,” which he envisages as something that might, in the future, be played “on pirate radio in a police state,” to the mournful psych-rock strains of Baird’s song “1,000 Goodbyes x 100 Hellos,” in which she asks, in her words, “whether we can trade our collective environmental, social and economic anxieties for action,” listen to the four tracks below.

5c48f62e3a125f5075c05f76,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/23/arts/music/joes-pub-artists-in-residence.html,"The Public Theater on Wednesday announced the 2019 class of the Joe’s Pub Working Group, supporting five young performing artists whose careers are on the rise. This year’s honorees include the songwriter and performer Migguel Anggelo; the vocalist and composer Trevor Bachman; the comedian, playwright and performance artist Becca Blackwell; the saxophonist Yacine Boulares; and the singer-songwriter Treya Lam. Now in its fifth year, the Working Group functions as a residency for standout artists who have previously played at Joe’s Pub, a small performance space tucked inside the Public Theater in Lower Manhattan. All five artists receive a $4,000 stipend, but because their work ranges widely, additional services vary for each honoree. They include access to rehearsal space, assistance with video production and consultations with industry experts. “Joe’s Pub Working Group was created to help make the business of being an artist in New York a little easier,” Alex Knowlton, the director of Joe’s Pub, said in an email. “We’re interested in the working life of an artist and have seen so many common needs among the huge spectrum of performers here.” “For the last 20 years, we’ve watched communities naturally occur amongst musicians, performers, designers, writers and more, and made it our mission to make space for all voices, collaborations and connections,” he added. Anggelo, who was born in Venezuela, creates multilingual works that combine music, dance and poetry. Bachman often uses field research and interviews to create musicals and performances that reflect the life experiences of people across the country.  Blackwell’s work as a storyteller and actor confronts issues related to the transgender experience. Boulares is a French-Tunisian improviser and composer who combines influences from American jazz and across the globe. And Lam is a classically trained musician fusing elements of chamber music, country and pop. "
5c643f173a125f5075c097da,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/13/arts/supremes-photos-motown-grosse-pointe.html,"It’s a vision of two Detroits that have mostly faded now — the social set born of the American auto industry’s vast wealth and the galvanizing magic of ’60s Motown — together in a room. In June 1965, the Supremes, one of America’s biggest and most glamorous groups, performed at a debutante party at the Country Club of Detroit in Grosse Pointe, Mich., the posh all-white enclave just northeast of the city. It was the debutante party of Christy Cole Wilson, and The New York Times pictures of the event tell a layered story of two groups connected, at least for the evening, by the music of that time and place.  The three elegant darlings of Detroit, led by the 21-year-old Diana Ross, serenade a room of finely attired guests, many of practically the same age. But between the groups were also the realities of race and class — the distance between Grosse Pointe and the Brewster projects where the Supremes grew up, 10 miles and several worlds away. The Times covered the lavish event in avid detail. “It took three days, hundreds of fresh blue irises, thousands of little Italian lights and hundreds of thousands of yellow plastic flowers to turn the club into a French garden,” the story enthused. “Whole walls had disappeared behind Austrian silk panels of gold and mirrors before the 750 guests arrived.” Not until the eighth paragraph did the story mention that “when they were not dancing and being entertained by a rock ‘n’ roll group called the Supremes, the Wilsons and their guests were polishing off 20 cases of French champagne, attempting to create a liquor shortage (the plot failed), and heaping their plates with food from an abundantly stocked buffet table.” The trio hardly needed an identifier at that point. Between August 1964 and June 1965, the Supremes had five No. 1 singles, including “Baby Love,” “Stop! In the Name of Love” and “Back in My Arms Again,” which had gone to the top of the charts just six days before this party. Which is exactly why Ms. Wilson’s parents hired them. “Everyone had very glamorous deb parties when I was growing up,” said Ms. Wilson Hofmann, 72, who now lives in Bristol, R.I. Her father, Ralph C. Wilson Jr., a millionaire insurance scion who had “a stable in Lexington, Ky., and the Buffalo Bills football team,” seemed happy to toast his daughter in such style. The event reportedly cost $85,000, which would be roughly $675,000 today. (This was just the hometown event; the 18-year-old Ms. Wilson had already been formally presented at the Debutante Cotillion and Christmas Ball in New York in December 1964.) It was an era when families of distinction across the country presented their daughters to society, with the intention that suitable men from similar backgrounds would meet their future wives. In Grosse Pointe, it was the “Ford girls,” the great-granddaughters of Henry Ford, who had ramped up the deb-ball arms race. Nat King Cole sang at Charlotte Ford’s storied party in 1959, while Ella Fitzgerald performed at her sister Anne’s soiree in 1961. Racial dynamics were changing in the 1960s, but often in fits and starts. The Supremes performing at a private club in Grosse Pointe, which still had no black residents, reflected this lurching progress.  “Music filtered in,” said Izzy Donnelly, the director of education at the Grosse Pointe Historical Society. “The ’60s were about breaking tradition. Bringing black entertainers to debutante balls and private clubs was putting a big foot in the front door.” It wasn’t an intentional political statement to hire the Supremes to perform at her party, Ms. Wilson Hofmann said. She chose them because she loved their music, and she was from a family that could make her request happen. “I grew up in Grosse Pointe and loved the Supremes and that kind of music, like the Temptations and Marvin Gaye,” said Ms. Wilson Hofmann. “They were extraordinarily popular with white audiences, black audiences and everyone else,” said Dolores Barclay, an author and adjunct professor at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, who collaborated with Diana Ross on the singer’s memoir. “Appearing in white venues was breaking down racial barriers. But it’s a different type of disruption. It’s nonconfrontational. It’s having a platform and saying, ‘Yes, we’re here, we’re great and we’re a part of American music.’” The Supremes were homegrown celebrities in Detroit and received star treatment, but there were black entertainers across the country still entering clubs and performance halls through the kitchen. “Anything in the South was still tenuous,” said Coraleen Rawls, collections manager at the Motown Museum in Detroit. “On one hand, we had artists who were happy to perform because that’s their passion and vocation. But it was also disheartening to be international stars and still be treated differently.” Just two years after Ms. Wilson’s debut, Detroit would experience the devastating unrest of 1967, as the city’s racial and economic disparities exploded into national awareness. And the Motown sound would prove to be a powerful force in the healing process. “It unified people and brought us all together,” Ms. Rawls said. “Where there were ropes between whites and blacks, those ropes started disappearing, as the people on both sides were like, ‘We’re all dancing. Why do we have to have a rope in the middle? You’re dancing, I’m dancing. We’re singing, you’re singing, so why do we have to be separated by some rope because of some thoughts prior to our generation as to how you think we should be?’” The year after the Supremes played Ms. Wilson’s party, the first black family moved to Grosse Pointe, and by 1974, The Times reported that three African-American families called the town home. In 2019, Grosse Pointe Farms, where the Country Club of Detroit is, remains 94 percent white, while the city of Detroit is 79 percent black. The deb parties continued in Grosse Pointe, albeit in a scaled-back fashion. In 1970, The Times covered the celebration for Sheila Ford, another heir of the automobile family. She opted for a short purple dress instead of traditional formal attire, and hired the group Sha-Na-Na, who “played what the listeners called real modern blues music.” "

But the building has changed hands and the club seems safe for now. By Karen Zraick You could say that stepping into Terraza 7, a tiny, eclectic and fiercely beloved music club on the border of Jackson Heights and Elmhurst, Queens, is like taking a trip to Latin America. But that’s not exactly right. Yes, many of the patrons speak Spanish, and the rhythms you’ll hear may have originated in Central or South America. But the bar is a classic New York archetype, a remix that aims to bring together diverse musical traditions and blend them into something new. Freddy Castiblanco, the energetic owner of the bar, sought to foster that syncretism when he opened Terraza 7 in 2002. Its name is a reference to indigenous agricultural practices as well as the 7 train, which rumbles past along Roosevelt Avenue. The bar showcases many types of folk music, jazz, salsa, cumbia and other genres.  But the club’s future had been in doubt since 2016, when the owner of the building at the time announced plans to raze it and build a high-rise. In December of last year, after many months of anxiety, Mr. Castiblanco, 47, received some good news. The building had changed hands again and the new owner said he would keep it as it was. And he would keep the club’s rent low. Mr. Castiblanco is still waiting for a new lease, but he is cautiously optimistic.  Mr. Castiblanco had been a doctor in Colombia, but decided to emigrate amid what he said was a crisis in the country’s health care system in the late 1990s. He arrived in New York in 2000, and as he set about learning English, his father, who already lived in the city, spotted an empty storefront and suggested opening a business there.  Mr. Castiblanco envisioned a bar with live music that would allow his neighbors to celebrate and share their songs and stories.  “I wanted it to be a laboratory,” Mr. Castiblanco said.  On a Saturday in March, the space hosted three events back-to-back-to-back: a Spanish-language poetry reading in honor of Women’s History Month; a wedding of two musicians who met at the bar; and a concert by a Cuban jazz band. “Terraza 7 is a very generous place with all the artists,” said Juana Ramos, a professor at York College, who helped organize the poetry reading. “They always open the door for us.” The bar also serves as a hub for local activists. It hosted a town hall with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez last year when she was running for Congress and a campaign fund-raiser for Jessica Ramos, who won a State Senate seat last November. Mr. Castiblanco has also run for office. Last year, he made a bid to represent the Colombian diaspora in that country's Congress. He lost, but he’s had other types of victories: Mr. Castiblanco introduced Jose Manzano and Lorens Tatiana Barrios, the musicians who ended up getting married at the bar, to each other, and he was among those snapping photos as they said their vows.  “She came through the door and it was like, ‘Oh my God.’ We started talking about music and ever since that night, we didn’t stop seeing each other. After a month, we decided to get married. It just felt right. It feels right.” — Jose Manzano, 34  After the ceremony, the guests watched video messages from the bride’s family in Barranquilla, Colombia, and the couple performed their first dance to a vallenato song, “Mi Novia Mujer,” by Rafa Pérez. Both the bride and groom perform in vallenato bands; he plays the accordion and she sings, often at Terraza 7. Ms. Barrios also tends bar there and coordinates Monday-night karaoke.  “This place is very dear to me,” said Elena Bernal, a wedding guest and a Terraza 7 regular who grew up nearby.  Ms. Bernal, who is 30 and Colombian-American, said she cherished that such a unique venue with so much Spanish-language music existed.  “It helped me embrace my roots,’’ she said, “and showed me how to be in touch with a deeper me.” Illustrations by Julia Wertz "

Cox, said in a statement. Mr. Abraham-Joseph is an “unlawfully present United Kingdom national” who legally entered the United States in 2005 but was supposed to leave the next year, according to the terms of his nonimmigrant visa, Mr. Cox said. [Is 21 Savage American? Our music critic weighs in.] In addition to being in the country unlawfully after 2006, Mr. Abraham-Joseph was convicted of felony drug charges in 2014 in Fulton County, Ga., the statement said. Mr. Abraham-Joseph faces deportation proceedings and was expected to appear before a federal immigration judge. “We are working diligently to get Mr. Abraham-Joseph out of detention while we work with the authorities to clear up any misunderstandings,” Dina LaPolt, Mr. Abraham-Joseph’s lawyer, said in a statement on Sunday night. In a statement on Monday, representatives of Mr. Abraham-Joseph said that he “has never hid his immigration status from the US government.” “As a minor, his family overstayed their work visas,” the statement said, and Mr. Abraham-Joseph “was left without legal status through no fault of his own.” His arrest came after he performed at the Super Bowl Music Fest at the State Farm Arena on Thursday. Mr. Abraham-Joseph has been nominated for a Grammy for Record of the Year for “Rockstar,” a song with the rapper Post Malone. Mr. Abraham-Joseph’s album “I Am > I Was” opened at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in January. He is known for his flat delivery and subdued rap style. Mr. Abraham-Joseph has long maintained that he was from Atlanta. In August, he gave backpacks and games to children in Atlanta during an annual drive called Issa Back 2 School Drive. “Mr. Abraham-Joseph is a role model to the young people in this country, especially in Atlanta,” Ms. LaPolt said. She added that Mr. Abraham-Joseph was “actively working in the community leading programs to help underprivileged youths in financial literacy.” In a 2016 interview with VladTV, an urban news YouTube channel, Mr. Abraham-Joseph was asked where he grew up and he listed all the neighborhoods in Atlanta he had previously lived in. “I grew up on the East Side, Glenwood, Decatur,” Mr. Abraham-Joseph says. “I done grew up in all Atlanta really, everybody know me. If you don’t, you ain’t from this city.” "

Emerging from the alt-country scene of the mid 1990s, he became a prolific and respected singer-songwriter in the 2000s. And he used his growing platform as a tool to be a vocal booster of female talent. Behind that public front, however, was a far darker truth, a recent investigation by The New York Times revealed. According to several women, Adams used the promise of professional help as a lure for sex and emotionally abusive romantic relationships. In one case, he leveraged the adoration of an underage fan and aspiring musician into sexually explicit communications. Adams denies the claims. The F.B.I. is now investigating Adams’s interactions with the underage fan, and since the publication of the article, the release plan for his next album, the first of three LPs planned for this year, has been put on hold.

5c76c79049f0eacbf105a783,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/27/obituaries/dorothy-masuka-dead.html,"Dorothy Masuka, a vocalist and songwriter who blazed a trail for female pop stars in South Africa and became a dogged advocate of the struggle against apartheid, died on Feb. 23 at her home in Johannesburg. She was 83. The South African jazz journalist Gwen Ansell, who knew Ms. Masuka, said the cause was complications of a stroke that Ms. Masuka suffered last year while touring Europe. Ms. Masuka rose to fame in the mid-1950s, becoming one of the first black female recording artists to achieve stardom across southern and eastern Africa. She performed in a jazz-inflected pop style, singing in native African languages, often about politics. Ms. Masuka wrote prolifically, and many of her songs were covered by other South African stars. Miriam Makeba adapted Ms. Masuka’s “Pata Pata” (originally titled “Ei-Yow”), turning it into her signature song. Tunes like “Kulala” and “Hamba Nontsokolo” were covered by Hugh Masekela, Thandiswa Mazwai and others. “A lot of my songs, they talk,” she told The Mail & Guardian, a South African newspaper, in 2014. “The way of my singing is message. You send a message: It’s love, it’s sadness, it’s everything.” Ms. Masuka’s career took off right as a newly cosmopolitan culture was flourishing among young black South Africans. At the same time, the country’s apartheid regime was tightening its repressive policies. From early in her career, she wrote and recorded songs that squarely addressed the racist policies of the South African government and others across the continent. She sang in support of the nonviolent Defiance Campaign, and she denounced the pro-apartheid politician D. F. Malan in “Dr. Malan.” In 1961 she recorded “Lumumba,” addressing the assassination of the Congolese leader Patrice Lumumba. The South African authorities tried to seize all copies of the record, and Ms. Masuka went into exile for more than 30 years. Throughout the 1960s she worked with pro-independence groups across southern and eastern Africa, including the African National Congress, which at the time was a revolutionary party seeking to overthrow the apartheid regime in Pretoria. For a few years she traveled widely, performing on behalf of independence movements in Zimbabwe, Malawi, Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya. She lived briefly in New York and London, supported by A.N.C. sympathizers, before settling down in Zambia with her children. Ms. Masuka was a flight attendant for 15 years while keeping up her musical career, returning to live in Zimbabwe after it gained independence in 1980. She moved back to Johannesburg in 1992, when apartheid was crumbling. Information on her survivors was not immediately available. Dorothy Masuku was born on Sept. 3, 1935, in Bulawayo, Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). Her name was misspelled “Masuka” on some early records, and the mistake stuck. Her father was a chef who worked for rail companies and hotels, and her mother ran a restaurant. Dorothy got her first taste of performing at her mother’s shop, where she sang songs for pennies in the tsaba-tsaba style, a rhythmic dance music popular in the 1940s. She attended Roman Catholic mission schools, first in her hometown and then, after moving at 12, in Johannesburg. In 1952 she played hooky to go on tour with the African Inkspots, a renowned male vocal ensemble based in Johannesburg. The next year she again ditched school to appear in the Rhodes Centenary Exhibition in Bulawayo, where she won first place in the Miss Bulawayo beauty contest. The win helped persuade her family to support her ambitions as a performer. Her mother signed a contract with Troubadour Records on behalf of Dorothy, who was still a minor. She immediately recorded a handful of songs, including her first hit single, “Hamba Nontsokolo.” An upbeat piece guided by a swinging guitar rhythm, it featured her chirruping voice over a bed of vocal harmonies, reflecting the popular sound of South African vocal groups at the time. The song became Ms. Masuka’s calling card, and Nontsokolo became her nickname. In later years, South Africans tended to refer to her affectionately as “Mam Dorothy.” In the late 1950s she performed often in both South Africa and Southern Rhodesia, becoming a top act in both countries. She was a regular on Johannesburg’s thriving club circuit, and toured with the African Jazz and Variety revue, a pioneering traveling show that featured some of South Africa’s finest black musicians and performing artists. Ms. Masuka’s recording of “Into Yam” — the revue’s closing number, and its only song to come from the black townships — became a dance-hall hit. Ms. Masuka did not make a full-length album until 1987, when she recorded “Ingalo” for the Zimbabwean Starplate label. She followed it with “Pata Pata,” in 1990, for the British label Mango, which reinvigorated her career. She followed that with a few more albums in the 1990s and 2000s, including “Mzilikazi” and “Lendaba,” both for South Africa’s Gallo label. Ms. Masuka was inducted into the Afropop Hall of Fame in New York in 2002, and four years later President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa awarded her the Order of Ikhamanga in Silver, a high national honor bestowed upon artists, writers and other cultural figures. Ms. Masuka continued to perform well into her 80s. In 2017 she shared a bill with the pianist Abdullah Ibrahim at Town Hall in New York, and last year she released her final album, “Nginje.” Today she is considered a national hero in both South Africa and Zimbabwe, though she resisted aligning herself with any single country. “I’m a child of every part of this continent,” she said in a 2015 interview at the Zanzibar International Film Festival, when asked about her history of activism. “I’ve been fighting not for a particular area — I’ve been fighting for South Africa, I’ve been fighting for Zimbabwe, Malawi, Tanzania, Congo and all these places. So I feel I don’t belong to one place.” "
5c508c703a125f5075c06eb7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/29/obituaries/oliver-mtukudzi-dead.html,"Oliver Mtukudzi, whose singing and guitar playing harnessed influences from across Southern Africa to create the most popular musical style in Zimbabwe, died on Jan. 23 in Harare, the nation’s capital. He was 66. The cause was heart failure related to diabetes, said Damon Forbes, a record executive and promoter who had worked with Mr. Mtukudzi for more than 20 years. Starting in the late 1970s, Mr. Mtukudzi (pronounced muh-too-KOOD-zie) recorded numerous albums — 67, by his count — and became a hero throughout Africa. The Zimbabwean music journalist Alex T. Magaisa wrote that Mr. Mtukudzi was “arguably Zimbabwe’s finest ambassador.” Though an official figure was not available, conservative estimates suggest that Mr. Mtukudzi sold millions of albums over the past 40 years. He sang anthems of social lament and timeless wisdom, typically in Shona, Zimbabwe’s predominant language, but also in English and Ndebele. His music pulled from traditional Shona rhythms and sounds while incorporating influences from South Africa’s more cosmopolitan, jazz-inflected mbaqanga tradition, as well as African-American dance music. What resulted — a kind of soundtrack to Zimbabwean life in the late 20th century — became known as its own idiom, called “Tuku music,” after Mr. Mtukudzi’s nickname. “I looked for a sound the guitar couldn’t make, in a guitar‚” he told the South African publication TshisaLIVE in an interview shortly before his death, remembering his early years. “Professional guitarists at the time used to laugh at me. I used to look for a mbira on the guitar strings,” he said, referring to a traditional Shona thumb piano. In the 1970s, as a member of the band Wagon Wheels, he played alongside the singer Thomas Mapfumo, who would become the only other Zimbabwean musician with a reputation to rival his. Mr. Mapfumo left the country in the 1990s and became well known in the West. Mr. Mtukudzi stayed, and cemented his status as the country’s most renowned musician. His popularity in Zimbabwe reflects the fact that in a country bitterly divided by political allegiances, he positioned himself as a unifier. While Mr. Mapfumo took a strong political stance in his music — pioneering a genre known as chimurenga (“revolutionary struggle music” in Shona) before the fall of white minority rule, then vigorously criticizing Robert Mugabe, who ruled the country from 1980 to 2017 — Mr. Mtukudzi generally avoided taking a political side. He sang at events for the ruling ZANU-PF party, as well as the wedding and funeral of the opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai. But his songs boldly told the stories of his communities, and he made no effort to avoid social issues. Perhaps his biggest hit was “Todii,” a cautionary song about the perils of H.I.V. from the 1997 album “Tuku Music.” Powered by a melancholy chorus of background singers and the gravelly lament of Mr. Mtukudzi’s lead vocal, it warned listeners of the virus that by then had infected a quarter of Zimbabwe’s population. Another popular song, “Neria,” from 1993, told of a woman thrown into poverty by a law that kept her from inheriting her husband’s property. Written as part of Mr. Mtukudzi’s soundtrack for a feature film, it so impressed the filmmakers that they changed the name of the movie to “Neria.” Nine years later, the same filmmakers made “Shanda,” a documentary about Mr. Mtukudzi that documented him as he toured Zimbabwe. Many of his songs urged government leaders as well as everyday people to focus on the well-being of Zimbabwe’s children. And Mr. Mtukudzi did throw the occasional veiled political swipe. In 2001 he released “Wasakara,” whose title translates to “You are worn out,” a song widely seen as a plea for Mr. Mugabe to step down. “He was a nation builder,” Paul Mangwana, a senior Zimbabwean government official, told The Associated Press. “Where it was necessary to criticize he would, and where it was necessary to praise he would.” Mr. Mtukudzi sought to strengthen his community through deeds as well as music. For the last 15 years, he ran the Pakare Paye Arts Center, an arts complex he founded in 2003 in Norton, a town 25 miles west of Harare. With a recording studio, classrooms and performance spaces, it aims to offer young people a creative and social outlet that would help combat unemployment and listlessness. In 2011 he was named a Unicef regional good-will ambassador for Eastern and Southern Africa. A year before, he had written a song, “Deaf Hear,” in observation of Unicef’s Day of the African Child. President Emmerson Mnangagwa of Zimbabwe acknowledged Mr. Mtukudzi’s death in a statement on Twitter. “Oliver Mtukudzi,” he wrote, “your voice has given us comfort during difficult times, and will remain with us for posterity.” Oliver Dairai Mtukudzi was born on Sept. 22, 1952, in Highfield, a dense, impoverished neighborhood of Harare. (The city was officially known as Salisbury at the time; what would eventually become Zimbabwe was then the British colony of Southern Rhodesia.) His parents had met after singing in a choir group, and they encouraged his blossoming musical interests. His father died just as Oliver was entering adulthood, and to support his family he took a job at a bookstore. But he filled every idle moment practicing on the guitar that a musician had given him after noticing his preternatural ability. He joined Wagon Wheels in 1977. Though it was a short-lived band, it nonetheless raised his and Mr. Mapfumo’s profiles. The next year, during the final days of the Zimbabwean revolution, he released “Ndipeiwo Zano,” his debut album with his own band, the Black Spirits. The title track testified to the experiences and determination of a dispossessed people. Throughout his career, Mr. Mtukudzi kept his family and his work entwined. His brother, Robert, was his keyboard player until he died in 1992. His daughters often sang background vocals and helped him compose. His initial plan in Norton was for his son, Samson, also a successful musician, to run the Pakare Paye center, but Samson died in a car accident in 2010. Mr. Mtukudzi’s survivors include his wife, Daisy; his daughters, Sandra Mtukudzi, Samantha Mtukudzi and Selmor Manatsa; and three sisters. An earlier marriage, to Melody Mtukudzi, ended in divorce. Starting in the 1990s, Mr. Mtukudzi increasingly performed across the globe: at sports stadiums in Africa, at Western festivals like Coachella and Womad, and at the Hollywood Bowl. Bonnie Raitt covered a Mtukudzi composition, “Help Me Lord,” and helped introduce him to Western audiences. He remained active until months before his death, even as he was plagued by complications of diabetes. In October he played for a crowd of more than 20,000 in Bloemfontein, South Africa. Speaking to TshisaLIVE, he defined his approach to music in intimate terms. “According to my mother‚ she believed that I will never come up with a song that surpasses my birth cry. From that‚ I’ve been making music to compare to that first cry,” he said. “What my birth cry meant to my mother — that is the kind of music I make.” "
5c7f60de49f0eacbf105b8d6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/06/world/asia/michael-jackson-radio-stations.html,"WELLINGTON, New Zealand — As the release of a new documentary detailing abuse accusations against the singer Michael Jackson has prompted debate about his legacy, the public response to its contents is also leading radio stations across the globe to stop playing his music. A radio network in Quebec pulled Jackson’s music from its nearly two dozen stations, according to The Canadian Press. In Britain, Variety reported that the BBC was forced to deny imposing such a ban after it was reported that the singer’s music had been “quietly dropped” from one of its stations. And the backlash has led to an almost complete removal of the singer’s music from the airwaves in New Zealand, after the two largest radio networks — which own most of the country’s commercial stations — said Wednesday that they would no longer play Jackson’s songs. In the New Zealand and Canadian cases, radio networks cited a change in public opinion about Jackson that was tied to the documentary “Leaving Neverland,” a two-part mini-series focusing on the accusations of two men who say Jackson abused them as children, as the reason for the ban. The program is scheduled for broadcast in New Zealand on Sunday and Monday. Leon Wratt, the content director of MediaWorks, one of the New Zealand radio companies, said audiences had indicated that they no longer wanted to hear Jackson’s music. “We aren’t deciding whether Michael Jackson is guilty of pedophilia or not,” he said in an interview on one of MediaWorks’ stations, Magic. “We’re just merely trying to make sure that our radio stations are going to play the music that people want to hear.” Mr. Wratt added that the accusations against Jackson had been public for years — the singer was cleared of child molesting charges after a trial in 2005. But viewers have reacted with shock to the new documentary. And its subjects, Wade Robson and James Safechuck, who detail disturbing accusations from their childhoods against Jackson, have received both plaudits and abuse for their part in it. Dean Buchanan, a spokesman for NZME, the other New Zealand radio network to pull Jackson’s music, said by email that the singer’s work was not being played “right now” on its stations. The country’s national public broadcaster, Radio New Zealand — which is primarily a talk station — also said that Jackson’s music currently did not feature in its air play, although a spokesman, John Barr, said that was not the result of a particular editorial decision. A Canadian media company, Cogeco, that told The Canadian Press it had banned Jackson’s music on its 23 stations in Quebec — including three major Montreal stations — cited the public response to “Leaving Neverland” as the reason. Neither NZME nor MediaWorks responded to questions about how long the ban would last, what date it began, or whether the networks planned to pull the songs of other musicians accused of wrongdoing, such as R. Kelly, who has been accused of, and denies, decades of serial misconduct. Mr. Wratt, the MediaWorks spokesman, said Jackson’s music would still be available on streaming services and in record stores for anyone who wanted to hear it. “The difference with radio, of course, is that if we play it you don’t have a choice,” he said. This is not the first time radio stations and streaming services have wrestled with whether to remove the music of artists accused of misconduct: Spotify last May instituted a policy of ceasing to promote or recommend R. Kelly’s music because of the accusations against him, though it rescinded the policy a month later after uproar from some in the music industry. Jackson’s estate in February canceled the Chicago run of a new jukebox musical about the singer three weeks after the Sundance premiere of “Leaving Neverland,” and two weeks before its HBO broadcast. The producers of the musical, “Don’t Stop ’Til You Get Enough,” cited scheduling difficulties caused by a labor dispute as the reason. The estate is seeking $100 million in damages from HBO over the “Leaving Neverland” documentary, which Howard Weitzman, the estate’s lawyer, branded “a disgrace.” "

Last week, “Thank U, Next” (Republic) became Grande’s second No. 1 album in six months, with notably high streaming numbers for a pop album. In its second week out, its totals fell by more than 50 percent, with 169 million streams and 20,000 copies sold as a complete album, according to Nielsen. But that was enough to stay on top. Billboard reported that it was the first time that a solo female artist has had more than one week at No. 1 on the chart since Taylor Swift’s “Reputation” notched four weeks at the end of 2017. (Last October, Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper spent three weeks at the top with “A Star Is Born”; this week, that soundtrack is No. 3.) Also this week, the “Bohemian Rhapsody” soundtrack rose one spot to No. 2; look for it to remain strong on next week’s charts, thanks to the best actor Oscar for its star, Rami Malek.

5c7815a949f0eacbf105aaf6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/28/arts/music/ukraine-eurovision-crimea-maruv.html,"The audience loved her. Her song had all the hallmarks of being a hit at Eurovision, the flamboyant European song contest with a cult following. The tune had romance and easy lyrics, and the singer was accompanied by dancers and had a strobe-lit stage act. The singer, Anna Korsun, whose stage name is Maruv, was on track to represent Ukraine at the Eurovision final in Tel Aviv in May. But now her chances have been derailed in an apparent geopolitical dispute after officials questioned her patriotism and her decision to tour Russia. At the national finals last Saturday in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, Ms. Korsun faced an unusual grilling from the jury. Jamala, the 2016 Eurovision winner from Ukraine whose full name is Susana Jamaladinova, began by questioning Ms. Korsun’s coming tour. Then she pretended to be a journalist in Tel Aviv and asked a surprising question in English: “Crimea is Ukraine?” “Ukraine, of course,” Ms. Korsun answered. (Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, drawing condemnation from around the world. Fighting between Ukrainian forces and separatists in the eastern Donbass region has killed more than 10,000 people.) Ms. Korsun’s answers did not seem to matter. On Tuesday, the Ukrainian national broadcaster announced that even though the public had voted for her, she would not be going to Tel Aviv. On Wednesday, Ukraine withdrew from the contest altogether. The broadcaster said the decision to drop Ms. Korsun was based on a disagreement over her contract. They “had not found common ground in the mission of the representative of Ukraine at the international song contest,” the broadcaster said in a statement. It also said that it had been unable to agree terms with other finalists and would therefore not send anyone to Eurovision 2019. The broadcaster’s decision was backed by officials who questioned Ms. Korsun’s allegiance to Ukraine. The Culture Ministry said that only “patriots who are aware of their responsibility” should be allowed to sing at Eurovision, the BBC reported. And the chairman of Ukraine’s Parliament said that any performers who tour in Russia should be banned from representing the country abroad, according to the  news service UNIAN. Ms. Korsun said she had been ready to cancel her concerts in Russia to perform at Eurovision, and she defended herself in a post on Instagram on Tuesday, writing: “I am a citizen of Ukraine, pay taxes and sincerely love Ukraine. But I am not ready to come up with slogans, turn my taking part in the contest into promotion for our politicians.” Eurovision’s rules officially ban politics from the singing competition. But this wasn’t the first time that Russia’s influence in Ukraine has been evoked in the contest. In “1944,” the song that won the Eurovision competition in 2016, Jamala sang about Soviet abuses under Stalin in her native Crimea. When it was Ukraine’s turn to hold the final, Russia’s contestant, Yulia Samoylova, was barred. Ms. Samoylova had performed in Crimea after the Russian annexation. The European Broadcasting Union, which organizes Eurovision, said it was saddened by Ukraine’s decision to pull its contestant this year. But it said in a statement on Thursday that each broadcaster was responsible for the selection of its act. Catherine Baker, a senior lecturer in 20th-century history at the University of Hull in England, said in an email that debates about whether contestants were fit to represent their country were common around the time of national selection competitions for Eurovision. “But contestants have also had to become ambassadors in a more direct sense because of the publicity responsibilities associated with Eurovision’s growing scale as an international event,” added Ms. Baker, who has studied the role politics plays in the singing contest. According to some observers, the public broadcaster’s move was unlikely to be popular with viewers. “The scandal that has unfolded around Ukraine’s participation in Eurovision will certainly have a negative impact on the image of the Ukrainian authorities,” said Sergei Kozlov, a Russian political scientist, speaking to a radio station affiliated to the news agency RIA Novosti. “The means by which she was removed from participation in the competition caused extremely negative emotions among TV viewers.” Fans of Eurovision criticized the decision to drop Ms. Korsun’s act. “Ukraine’s broadcaster has done itself a total disservice,” William Lee Adams, a journalist and founder of a blog about Eurovision, wrote on Twitter. “MARUV was gonna bring y’all glory!” "
5c4303333a125f5075c0545b,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/19/style/emo-metal-rock-music-nigeria.html,"the look Rock music fans have emerged from the digital underground in Nigeria. Photographs by Jan Hoek and Stephen Tayo Text by Edwin Okolo Produced by Eve Lyons LAGOS, Nigeria — Rock music is often produced and enjoyed under the pressure of social constraints, and the restrictive culture of post-dictatorial Nigeria made for a perfect cooker. In the 1990s and 2000s, teenagers who rejected the country’s politics of restraint in dress, physical appearance and behavior embraced American punk and metal imports.  Footage of Western concertgoers dancing in defiance of any discernible rhythm, alone in a throng of bodies, moving with careless abandon to music, presented a possible escape. Many of these young Nigerians first encountered bands beloved by early 2000s emo kids — Linkin Park, Evanescence, Paramore, Fall Out Boy — online and, through the exchange of music, formed a digital community. They called themselves “Gothics,” shorthand for a composite of binding beliefs and aesthetics from different rock subgenres, including dark clothing, severe makeup and an obsession with death. “The scene’s true beginnings are the MySpace groups from the early 2000s,” said Cheyi Okoaye, 30, who runs the music website Audio Inferno. “MySpace used to let you create and save these playlists, and many of us would sleep over in cyber cafes just to discover new bands.” In the last decade, Nigeria’s Gothics have taken their act offline. Each year they congregate at Rocktoberfest, the only festival in Nigeria dedicated to rock and alternative music. It has become a crucial meeting place for members of the country’s underground rock community. “I’m grounded,” said Kaego Odiah, a 19-year-old student at the University of Lagos who had come to Freedom Park in Lagos for the festival. “I snuck out of the house because I had to be here.” Rocktoberfest presents a rare opportunity for fans to dress un-self-consciously in their gothic uniform of funereal black. At the smaller but more frequent sing-off parties held in karaoke bars around the city, for example, many Gothics come straight from their day jobs, still in dress shirts and ties, and try to avoid meeting anyone they know from their lives outside the community. “We want to take rock music mainstream. That’s why we have the festival,” said Lekan Dada, 30, the co-founder of RockNation Nigeria, which produces the festival and promotes rock bands. “Radio stations are reluctant to play rock music. Nigerian cable stations dedicate one hour a week to rock. If we are going to make this mainstream, we need to create our own ecosystem.” Music has long underpinned Nigerian oral histories, worship songs, state ceremonies and other speech acts. But these traditional songs encourage the expression of joy and hope, and rarely fear, doubt or despair. In rock music, young Nigerians found their range of emotions reflected: Anger, loneliness, grief and insecurity could exist alongside rapture. Some Nigerians have made spreading the gospel of rock music their life’s work. The influx of American rock inspired Nigerian bands with similar sounds, including the Isomers, an alternative rock band reminiscent of Kings of Leon; 1 Last Autograph, whose metalcore sound harks back to Avenged Sevenfold; and Mimido, whose music has Christian rock influences.  Mr. Okoaye’s website Audio Inferno publishes music reviews and interviews of rock bands across Africa. And through RockNation Nigeria, Mr. Dada creates spaces for fans to congregate offline. Meeting up in person has helped Gothics assimilate without diluting their dark style. Henry Uche, who calls himself a vampire and prefers the name GothicHenri, dresses in all black and ties his looks together with chains, studs and a pentagram necklace. He believes that by incorporating a few gothic visual elements into outfits, he and his fellow fans are better able to telegraph a shared love of rock. “In the future, I can see festivals where people who identify with the different subcultures can connect while listening to good music, especially because our country isn’t alternative-friendly,” he said. While the crowds at Nigerian rock shows are mostly female, few women have become community leaders. The alternative singer Bianca Adanna Okorocha, 29, who performs as Clay, is one exception. She considers her perseverance an achievement. “I’m still here when most of the people I got into the scene with have fallen away to assimilate into ‘real life,’” she said. But more notable is her ability to fuse rock music with Afropop, the predominant contemporary sound in Lagos, and the success she has had in doing so. When Ms. Okorocha performs, she is magnetic, coaxing the bodies in her thrall to give in to their baser selves. She was one of the eight acts that headlined Rocktoberfest, along with the aforementioned Mimido. As the night neared its end, some wiped their faces clean of face paint, stuffed their torn tees and jewelry into backpacks and handbags, and headed home. The gothic purists, on the other hand, scattered and swarmed karaoke bars to scream along to death metal and throw back drinks, without a care for how they may appear to onlookers. “I don’t know exactly what it means to be goth,” Yasmin Mbadiwe, 23, said. “Only that other people say I am.” Jan Hoek is an artist and writer in Amsterdam.

5c881f6449f0eacbf105cb55,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/12/arts/music/hal-blaine-drummer-songs.html,"Hal Blaine, who died on Monday at 90, was the greatest and most prolific session drummer during the turbulent Sixties crescendo from pop to psychedelia, keeping the nation’s heartbeat through dozens of No. 1 hits during the Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon administrations. His résumé included ambitious art-rock totems, easy listening schmaltz, TV theme songs, incendiary folk-rock, Phil Spector’s “wall of sound” and Steely Dan’s smooth softscapes. His beats backed a hall of fame of mid-20th century icons, including Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley, the Beach Boys, the Supremes, Simon and Garfunkel, Sam Cooke, Barbra Streisand, Herb Alpert, John Denver and Leonard Cohen. But his most legendary beat is the primordial thump-thump-thump-crack heartbeat in the first four seconds of the Ronettes’ “Be My Baby.” Here’s just a fraction of what Blaine tapped into musical history. The first Phil Spector production that Blaine — the drummer for the producer’s Wrecking Crew session band — drove to No. 1. In the final 30 seconds, you can hear Blaine exploding outward from his steady pulse into a frenzy. “Phil Spector, God bless him, used to let me just go nuts on records,” Blaine told Modern Drummer. “I would go totally bananas on the endings of those songs. Phil has always said that he was going to take all the fades and put them together and put out some records of that.” Blaine wagered the creation of one of the most iconic opening drum beats of all time was “unintentional.” “Be My Baby” was possibly intended to have snare beats breaking up the pulse on 2 and 4 instead of just the big wallop at the end. In any event, its influence can be felt in the many songs that used similar beats in its wake: Billy Joel’s “Say Goodbye to Hollywood,” the Boys’ “Brickfield Nights,” the Jesus and Mary Chain’s “Just Like Honey,” Poison’s “Cry Tough” and Bat for Lashes’ “What’s a Girl to Do” among them. Blaine would eventually be known for his steady backbeats, but he can be heard playing wild fills all over this soul classic. “That was another one with that same drum lick every eight or 16 bars, whatever it was,” Blaine told NPR. “And all these drum licks kind of became the standard for rock ’n’ roll. You know, all the drummers that I’ve spoken with through the years have told me that they grew up listening to the records that I played on, and that’s how they learned.” Naturally, the Who’s Keith Moon was a fan, as was the Rush drummer Neil Peart. “When I was growing up, I played along to the radio,” Peart said in 2011, “so I played along to Simon and Garfunkel, the Beach Boys, the Association and the Byrds, and I was really playing along to Hal Blaine.”  The producer Terry Melcher wasn’t sold on the instrumental prowess of the Byrds so it was the Wrecking Crew session team that anchored the song most responsible for the advent of “folk rock.” Blaine’s brushes on the snare are nuanced and dynamic, but the real iconic element of “A Taste of Honey” is his four-on-the-floor bass drum. This was another happy accident. Blaine said the band was coming in “like a train wreck,” so he provided a pulse. It became the most memorable part of the song. The Beach Boy Mike Love wrote of his bandmate Brian Wilson: “When we’d go to Brian’s house, he would play [“Be My Baby”] over and over again, comparing it to Einstein’s theory of relativity.” Inspired by Spector’s wall of sound techniques, Wilson created “Good Vibrations,” a single that was epochal for its orchestral ambitions, studio-as-instrument techniques and early embrace of electronic music via the whining Electro-Theremin. Who better to anchor it to pop than one of Spector’s drummers of choice? “My particular sound for Brian,” Blaine wrote in his autobiography, “was basically the Phil Spector sound with a few minor changes. … Afterwards, I would overdub percussion effects. I was invited to experiment, and I don’t ever remember Brian telling me not to play anything.” Though this chamber-pop song is mostly forgotten, it still knocked the Monkees’ “Last Train to Clarksville” out of the No. 1 spot in late 1966. Blaine’s high-hat work here — opening, striking, then closing for a pssssshp — has been credited by Drum magazine as integral for moving the sizzling sound from jazz to rock. It has since became a bedrock element of dance music. Blaine plays drums on four of Simon and Garfunkel’s five studio albums, providing the tasteful accompaniment on No. 1 singles “Mrs. Robinson” and “Bridge Over Troubled Water.” But check out the apocalyptic Top 20 hit “A Hazy Shade of Winter,” first released in 1966 before appearing on the 1968 album “Bookends,” for a missing link between Motown and punk rock. Blaine’s work with Nancy Sinatra would yield bigger hits — most notably “These Boots Are Made for Walkin’” and the duet with her father “Somethin’ Stupid,” both No. 1 hits. But this papa-was-a-rolling-stone single allowed the consummate sideman to stretch his legs (and arms) with monstrous tom-tom fills. Blaine brought a massive drum kit to accompany Sinatra for her performance on 1971 TV special “Movin’ With Nancy on Stage.” “I did a solo on the show, which was the first time anyone ever saw that set, so everybody just went crazy,” Blaine told Modern Drummer. “I gave it all to Ludwig. I expected them to call it the Hal Blaine super set or something. But they called it the Octoplus, and it was one of their biggest sellers.” Looped to play three times, Blaine’s funky opening beat (and Jim Gordon’s percussion) on this Monkees classic was the first thing you heard on the first volume of Ultimate Breaks and Beats, the record series that served as an essential D.J. and producer tool in the 1980s. Twenty years after it was recorded, Blaine would end up the unwitting participant in hip-hop records like Run-D.M.C.’s “Mary Mary” (1988), De La Soul’s “Change in Speak” (1989) and Big Daddy Kane’s “Pimpin’ Ain’t Easy.” A song at the crossroads of psychedelia, soul, pop and Broadway, Blaine moves from a deconstructed “Be My Baby,” to locomotive rock to groovy funk. Proving himself ever versatile, Blaine’s last era of chart success and prolific session work was during the late Seventies and early Eighties explosion of pop-country artists like Shelly West (“Jose Cuervo”), John Denver (“I’m Sorry,” “Thank God I’m a Country Boy”) and era-appropriate works by Emmylou Harris and Johnny Cash. On Tanya Tucker’s “Lizzie and the Rainman” — a No. 1 country hit and a Top 40 pop crossover — Tucker says “beat the drum” in the middle of each chorus and Blaine plays a bonkers descending drum fill that pans across the speakers. It sounds like it was pulled from a Rush record instead of something that broke the Adult Contemporary chart. "
5c609f3e3a125f5075c08fb5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/10/arts/music/grammy-awards.html,"• Our critics and writers weigh in on the best and worst moments of the 61st annual Grammy awards. • At a ceremony dominated by female performers and presenters, Kacey Musgraves won album of the year for “Golden Hour,” as well as three other awards. Cardi B became the first woman to win best rap album as a solo artist for “Invasion of Privacy.” • See the full list of winners and the red carpet looks. • Childish Gambino’s “This Is America” won four awards and Lady Gaga’s “Shallow,” from the movie “A Star Is Born,” won two. • This year’s ceremony was perhaps as notable for who didn’t show up — Kendrick Lamar, Childish Gambino, Ariana Grande — as who did. LOS ANGELES — Women took center stage at the 61st annual Grammy Awards on Sunday night, with bold performances and wins in many top categories, a year after the awards came under withering criticism for its track record in gender representation. The controversies of last year, when just one woman won a solo award during the telecast — and the outgoing head of the Recording Academy, the organization behind the awards, remarked that women in music should “step up” to advance their careers — were never far from the surface of the show. Dua Lipa, a 23-year-old British singer who has established herself as a hitmaker, alluded to that when accepting the award for best new artist, saying she was honored to be recognized among so many other female artists. “I guess this year we really stepped up,” Lipa said. Backstage, she told reporters that the message of greater gender equity was immediately clear to her when the nominations were announced in December. [Read about Michelle Obama joining Alicia Keys onstage.] The award for album of the year went to Kacey Musgraves for “Golden Hour,” a collection that stretched the boundaries of country and drew deep respect from critics. She also took home three other prizes in the country field. “Women have a really necessary perspective — to life, to music,” Musgraves told reporters backstage. “It’s really nice to see that getting a chance to be included.” Many of the awards won by men highlighted the Grammys’ fraught history with hip-hop. Both the record and song of the year prizes — the latter awarded for songwriting — were won by Childish Gambino’s “This Is America,” a thumping, confrontational song about racial injustice. It was the first hip-hop song to win either award. But Donald Glover, the actor and musician who performs as Childish Gambino, was absent. He, along with Kendrick Lamar and Drake, the two most powerful and influential young rappers in music, were offered performance spots on the show but turned them down, reflecting the alienation from the Grammys that has taken hold among much of the upper ranks of hip-hop. Drake was there to accept the award for best rap song, for “God’s Plan” from his blockbuster album “Scorpion.” Before his speech was cut off, he alluded to the gulf between the Grammy establishment and hip-hop culture. “This is a business where sometimes it’s up to a bunch of people that might not understand what a mixed-race kid from Canada has to say or a fly Spanish girl from New York, or a brother from Houston,” he said. “But the point is, you’ve already won if you have people who are singing your songs word for word, you don’t need this right here,” he added, holding up the Grammy. Brandi Carlile, an earnest female singer-songwriter in an Americana style, was the dark horse of the show, getting six nominations — more than any other woman — including in the top categories of album, record and song of the year. She gave a powerful, arena-filling performance of her song “The Joke,” and ended up winning three awards, though none in the top categories. She took best American roots performance and song for “The Joke,” and Americana album for “By the Way, I Forgive You.” They were the first Grammys of her career. Lamar and Drake, the two most-nominated artists — with eight and seven nods, respectively — each won only one. Lamar’s “King’s Dead,” from the “Black Panther” soundtrack, tied for best rap performance with Anderson .Paak’s “Bubblin.” Childish Gambino’s “This Is America” won a total of four awards, including rap/sung performance and best music video. The ceremony began with the 21-year-old singer Camila Cabello performing her song “Havana” on a neon-colored city street scene, joined by a white-suited Ricky Martin, J Balvin and Young Thug. But the first moment of major star power came a few minutes later, when Alicia Keys, the host, introduced “my sisters”: Lady Gaga, Jada Pinkett Smith, Michelle Obama and Jennifer Lopez. Each spoke about the inspiring power of music throughout their lives. Obama, drawing a thunderous welcome from the crowd at the Staples Center, was nearly drowned out as she delivered her lines. “From the Motown records I wore out on the South Side,” she said, “to the ‘who run the world’ songs that fueled me through this last decade, music has always helped me tell my story.” One superstar woman after another performed solo routines, as if they were fleshing out different views of diva-hood. Janelle Monáe performed “Make Me Feel” with bits of inspiration from Prince and Michael Jackson, but focused on female sexuality, surrounded by female dancers in tight rubber outfits. [Messages of inspiration and hope prevailed during the show.] With Cooper absent, Lady Gaga took both parts of “Shallow” herself. Dressed in a black sequined suit and high platform heels, she thrashed on the stage like a 1970s arena rocker, as pyrotechnics announced the song’s climax. Jennifer Lopez led a Motown tribute performed as a Vegas-style revue. She was joined by Smokey Robinson and Ne-Yo, with a medley of about 10 songs jammed into six minutes and featuring gymnastic, bottom-shaking, somersaulting dancing. Cardi B won the first Grammy of her career, best rap album for “Invasion of Privacy.” Holding the hand of her husband, the rapper Offset, she joked about struggling for composure — “Maybe I should start smoking weed!” — before talking about the long nights she worked to finish her album and shoot videos while pregnant. She is the first female solo artist to win in the category. Earlier, she performed “Money” dressed in purple and black like a supervillain, while dancers around her moved and spread their legs in synchronous motion like a bawdy Busby Berkeley sequence. In the audience, Offset stuck out his tongue suggestively. [Never miss a pop music story: Sign up for our weekly newsletter, Louder.] H.E.R., the stage name for the 21-year-old singer and songwriter Gabriella Wilson, led a slow-build version of her ballad “Hard Place.” She won two awards, for R&B performance (in the song “Best Part”) and best R&B album, for her self-titled release “H.E.R.” But when accepting R&B album, she seemed almost baffled that it was eligible. “It’s not even an album,” she said. “It’s an E.P.” Lady Gaga won the first award of the telecast, best pop duo/group performance, for “Shallow,” her duet with Bradley Cooper from their movie “A Star Is Born.” Tearful, she said she wished Cooper were with her — he was in London for the Baftas, the British film awards — and addressed a theme in the film, in which Cooper plays a singer struggling with addiction. “I’m so proud to be part of a movie that addresses mental health issues,” she said. “A lot of artists deal with that and we’ve got to take care of each other.” Diana Ross, appearing in a wide, lacy red gown, celebrated her 75th birthday with two hits from her solo career, “The Best Years of My Life” and “Reach Out and Touch (Somebody’s Hand).” Winding up her performance, she ordered those in the crowd to wave their hands, saying: “Together we have no limits. You can learn, dream, unlock new doors. All is possible.” She ended with, “Happy birthday to me!” Dolly Parton had the most cross-generational appeal, singing a five-song medley with Katy Perry, Kacey Musgraves, Miley Cyrus and Maren Morris that had Smokey Robinson and the K-pop group BTS all dancing and singing along in the crowd. It ended with a nostalgic singalong on “9 to 5” that seemed to pull in the whole arena. Shortly thereafter, Musgraves won her third Grammy of the night — best country album for “Golden Hour” — and gushingly doled out thanks to her manager, the Grammys and her fans. “I never dreamed that this record would be met with such love, such warmth, such positivity,” Musgraves said. [Here’s the full list of Grammys winners.] All but nine of the Grammys’ 84 awards were given out in a nontelevised ceremony that was attended by few of the night’s big stars. Carlile led the preshow portion with her three wins in the American roots category. “Americana music is the island of the misfit toys; I am such a misfit,” Carlile said, accepting the second award. “It is the music that has shaped my life and made me who I am, and even given me my family.” Lady Gaga and Musgraves each had two early wins. Lady Gaga’s “Joanne (Where Do You Think You’re Goin’?),” a piano version of a song first released more than two years ago, took best pop solo performance, and “Shallow” took best song written for visual media. Musgraves won best country solo performance for “Butterflies” and her “Space Cowboy” took best country song. The score for “Black Panther” also won an award for its composer, Ludwig Göransson. [Here’s a look at the Grammys red carpet.] The preshow awards may be invisible to most of the general public, but they can set important benchmarks in the industry, and have the power to reshape careers among artists in genres far beyond pop radio. One barrier was broken with the award for best engineered album, nonclassical, which went to Beck’s “Colors.” Among its winners was Emily Lazar, a studio veteran who became the first woman to win as mastering engineer in that category. “I am so grateful to be one of the people,” she said, “that young women see and they can say: ‘I can see it. I can be it. That’s a cool career, I want to go do that.’” Claudia Brant, a seasoned songwriter for Latin artists who won best Latin pop album for “Sincera,” noted that for all the Grammys’ power, it is the daily studio work that matters the most. “Of course it’s going to change my career, because it’s the biggest recognition I’ve ever gotten,” Brant said. “But tomorrow I’ll have a session in the studio with another artist that’s looking for good songs.” The Grammys missed a chance for another milestone in the producer of the year category. The award went to Pharrell Williams. Had it gone to Linda Perry, she would have been the first woman to take home that award. [Here’s the full list of Grammys winners.] "

ANI CORDERO at the David Rubenstein Atrium at Lincoln Center (Jan. 31, 7:30 p.m.). The New York-based singer and instrumentalist uses music to tap into her Puerto Rican heritage, performing traditional music from the island, as well as from around Latin America (she’s worked with the Brazilian ensemble Os Mutantes, among others). Specifically, on her debut solo release in 2014, “Recordar,” Cordero paid tribute to Latin American music’s history of protest songs, offering her rendition of compositions by artists like Mexico’s Chavela Vargas and Chile’s Violeta Parra. This concert is free, and the Puerto Rican pop singer JOATA will open. 212-721-6500, lincolncenter.org RYAN HURD at Bowery Ballroom (Jan. 25, 8 p.m.). Like many artists working to break through in Nashville, Hurd has an impressive roster of songs that he’s co-written for country stars: Darius Rucker, Dierks Bentley, Florida Georgia Line and Tim McGraw. While writing “Last Turn Home” for McGraw, Hurd met his wife, Maren Morris; now he’s guest-starring in her music videos. The songs he writes for himself are charmingly romantic, painting pictures of understated, easy affection. On “Love in a Bar” (which, naturally, is about Morris) he sings about falling hard for someone while sharing a few beers; his latest single, “To a T,” is an ode to a cozy night in. Both show his flair for believable love songs that aren’t cloyingly sweet. 212-260-4700, boweryballroom.com LES SAVY FAV at Junction (Jan. 25, 8 p.m.) and Elsewhere (Jan. 26, 7 p.m.). On Friday and Saturday, this art-punk quintet will perform their first local shows in more than two years. The band members have been experimenting with noise, pop and punk music for over two decades, but at this point — nearly nine years after their last new album, and with two members locked into a regular gig on “Late Night With Seth Meyers” — Les Savy Fav’s raucous, unpredictable live shows remain their calling card. Their gig at Junction in Long Beach, N.Y., is a benefit for Tommy Brull Foundation, an organization dedicated to helping people with special needs on Long Island; the band’s set at Elsewhere is sold out, but tickets are available through resellers. 516-889-1680, junction11561.comelsewherebrooklyn.com KACEY MUSGRAVES at the Beacon Theater (Jan. 25-26, 8 p.m.). A young country singer selling out two nights at one of New York City’s biggest theaters is newsworthy in and of itself; the fact that said country singer, Musgraves, is a woman working at a moment when country radio seems to be hostile to female artists only adds to the significance of this success. Long a critical darling, Musgraves took a pop-oriented swing with her mellow, sweet 2018 release, “Golden Hour,” and with its Grammy nomination for album of the year, she appears to have hit a home run. Tickets for both shows are available on the resale market. 212-465-6000, beacontheatre.com WU-TANG CLAN at Terminal 5 (Jan. 26-27, 8 p.m.). As part of the extended 25th anniversary celebration for their seminal 1993 debut, “Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers),” this Staten Island-bred rap group is performing two rare New York shows. Many of Wu-Tang’s nine founding members, including GZA, RZA, Method Man, Ghostface Killah and Raekwon, have found substantial success outside the group; “36 Chambers,” though, still holds importance. RZA recently told Complex of the release that “each of our lyrics are potent and become more substantiated as time goes on.” Both shows are sold out, but tickets are available through resellers. 212-582-6600, terminal5nyc.com [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] YOUNG DOLPH at Gramercy Theater (Jan. 31, 7 p.m.). Succeeding in rap without first rising through the ranks in one of its hubs — New York, Chicago, Atlanta or Los Angeles — is challenging. Yet Young Dolph’s commitment to representing his hometown, Memphis, remains steadfast. He’s also stayed independent, another unlikely choice for an M.C. who trades in catchy trap beats and streetwise lyrics just slightly more hard edged than the current trends on commercial rap radio. Fresh off his biggest solo success to date with the single “Major,” though, Dolph is starting to reap some rewards. The show is sold out, but tickets are available on the resale market.212-614-6932, thegramercytheatre.comNATALIE WEINER BRAXTON COOK at Baby’s All Right (Jan. 25, 8 p.m.). A gifted young alto saxophonist and vocalist, Cook is both a graduate of Juilliard’s notoriously traditionalist jazz program and a veteran of Christian Scott aTunde Adjuah’s genre-bending ensembles. In his increasingly acclaimed solo projects, Cook builds a contemporary, jazz-pop identity that draws from 1970s fusion, ’80s R&B and contemporary Los Angeles hip-hop. Through it all, he finds a way to let his bebop-rooted saxophone improvisations shine. At this concert, featuring a guest appearance from the trumpeter Theo Croker, he will draw material from “No Doubt,” an album he released late last year.babysallright.com ANTONIO HART QUINTET at Smoke (Jan. 25-26, 7, 9 and 10:30 p.m.). Hart, a stellar alto saxophonist who burst onto the New York scene alongside Roy Hargrove in the early 1990s as part of the Young Lions generation, has always worn his debt to Cannonball Adderley on his cuffs. Here he presents a tribute to Adderley, an iconic hard-bop saxophonist, in a quintet that features Freddie Hendrix on trumpet, Caili O’Doherty on piano, Alex Ayala on bass and Cory Cox on drums.212-864-6662, smokejazz.com VIJAY IYER at Jazz Standard (through Jan. 27, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). Iyer’s sextet has been one of the hottest commodities in jazz since the release of its debut, “Far From Over,” in 2017. A version of that band will play on Friday and Saturday, presenting Iyer’s beaming, rhythmically interleaved original music. Then on Sunday, Iyer will perform with a newer group that features some of his colleagues and students at Harvard University, where he teaches. (He’s also a MacArthur fellow.) That band is called the Ritual Ensemble, and it features Ganavya Doraiswamy on vocals, Yosvany Terry on saxophones and Rajna Swaminathan on mridangam, an Indian percussion instrument.212-576-2232, jazzstandard.com AVA MENDOZA ET AL. at H0L0 (Jan. 31, 7 p.m.). A conclave of young avant-garde improvisers will descend on this darkened basement in Ridgewood, Queens, for a night of free playing. It’s hard to know where things will go; if you go, steel yourself for a wide variety of musical textures and temperaments, most of them liberated from standard time and harmony. The performers include the thrashing, post-metal guitarist Ava Mendoza; the pensive tenor saxophonist Ingrid Laubrock; and the bassist Brandon Lopez, who uses his instrument in a variety of nontraditional ways.h0l0.nyc ‘THE MUSIC OF ANTHONY BRAXTON’ at Roulette (Jan. 25, 8 p.m.). One of the premier — and most prolific — living American composers, Braxton continues to release reams of new music, typically drawing on improvisation and built around his own complex musical systems. On Friday his 12-disc collection titled “GTM (Syntax) 2017,” featuring his Tri-Centric Vocal Ensemble, comes out. Here an 11-person version of that group performs in celebration of the record’s release. Afterward, the electronic musician Carl Testa and the pianist Cory Smythe will play music from a different part of Braxton’s repertoire, using a compositional system of his called Echo Echo Mirror House Music. 917-267-0368, roulette.org WADADA LEO SMITH at the Appel Room (Jan. 26, 7 and 9:30 p.m.). Every recording Smith releases feels apt to be called a “landmark.” It’s the awe-inspiring, wide-screen breadth of his trumpet sound, the slowly accruing power of his compositions, and his way of making even small ensembles sound spacious — and ancient. “America’s National Parks,” his widely acclaimed 2016 release celebrating the natural wonders of North America, stands out in particular for its tumultuous melodic beauty and the bristling, mutating forms of its compositions. At Jazz at Lincoln Center, Smith presents the New York City debut of this work, joined by the personnel from the album: the pianist Anthony Davis, the cellist Ashley Walters, the bassist John Lindberg and the drummer Pheeroan akLaff.212-721-6500, jazz.orgGIOVANNI RUSSONELLO "
5c4febe83a125f5075c06d08,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/29/opinion/italy-claudio-baglioni.html,"MILAN — Politics is a show, and every country has its favorite. The United States is bringing on yet another Hollywood classic (the aging action hero, the desert, the border, the money). France is offering its periodic re-enactment of its Revolution, with gilets jaunes replacing sans-culottes. Germany’s national orchestra is saying goodbye to an exhausted chancellor/conductor. Britain is deep into a Shakespearean tragedy of its own creation: to leave or not to leave Europe…?  And what about Italy? It’s a music festival, of course. The Italian Song Festival (Festival della Canzone Italiana) is held annually in Sanremo, a quaint seaside resort near the French border, and is by far the most popular television event of the year. This year it will be broadcast live between Feb. 5 and Feb. 9. Held since 1951, it is used for picking the Italian entry to the Eurovision Song Contest and today it attracts more than 12 million viewers — more than half of the country’s TV audience. It combines a song contest with some comedy and a few handsomely paid international guests. Advertisers scramble to squeeze their products into five days of prime-time broadcasts.  But Sanremo, as it is known, is far more than a song contest. It’s a national gathering, like the Academy Awards in the United States. It’s a truce in quarrelsome times. It’s predictable and reassuring. The young like to trash it live on social media, but they too watch it, and talk about little else for days. That is why I’ve accepted an invitation to join the festival’s giuria degli esperti (experts jury), which includes writers, actors and film directors (Sanremo’s organizers didn’t know I was planning to write about them, of course). But watching the Barnum from the inside? How could I say no? It’ll be a master’s degree in political science, anthropology and social studies — all in a few days.  Sanremo’s presenter — and artistic director — changes regularly. Last year and again this year both roles have fallen to a soft-spoken pop singer in his 60s, Claudio Baglioni. His 1972 song “Questo Piccolo Grande Amore” (“This Little Great Love”), lamenting a young man’s obsession about his unattainable beloved in her ultrathin T-shirt, is still an unofficial national anthem; every Italian can sing along with it. On Jan. 9, during the preview news conference, Mr. Baglioni answered a question about immigration. It’s a sensitive topic; the populist government is openly fighting it. He complained that the public mood has turned “nasty.” He said that this government, just like the previous ones, is mismanaging immigration, this time allowing a”a farce” by leaving 50 asylum-seekers at sea for 19 days. (They were finally brought to shore the same day by the Maltese Coast Guard and will be distributed across nine European Union nations). All hell broke loose. The director and presenter was crucified on social media, government ministers attacked him and state television executives voiced their disapproval. Matteo Salvini, Italy’s interior minister and leader of the anti-immigration League, said: “I like Claudio Baglioni when he sings, not when he gives political speeches.”  Italy split — not along traditional party lines, but in more imaginative, unexpected ways. Sanremo’s old devotees argued for freedom of expression, even though they had voted for the populist parties, Mr. Baglioni’s fans defended him, and scores of pop singers — rarely heard on these topics — passionately took sides. Political pundits who can’t tell the difference between a refrain and a remix wrote thoughtful columns. For a few days Italy was transformed into a huge debating society. Until everyone got fed up and started arguing about something else. A country where immigration is discussed because of a song contest but not in Parliament? Is that worrying? Actually it’s quite interesting, and somewhat refreshing. Italy is indeed in a new mode. The 2018 election winners — the Five Star Movement and the League — approved a painful budget, after a long hassle with the European Union Commission — and are jockeying for position before the European election (May 23 to 26). They disagree about most things, from self-defense to infrastructure, vaccination to immigration. But the League, which received 17 percent of the vote in the 2018 election, is booming, and is now credited with a stunning 36 percent of public support. By contrast, its governmental partner, Five Star, is losing pace, down from 33 percent to 26 percent, as Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte whispered to Germany’s chancellor, Angela Merkel, in Davos on Jan. 23. Luigi Di Maio, its young leader, is worried and confused. After praising France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, at the end of 2017 (“The Five Star Movement believes deeply, just like you, in Europe’s refoundation”), on Jan. 8 he posted his praise for, and even offered logistical support to, the Yellow Vests in France: “Yours is the same spirit that has animated the Five Star Movement and thousands of Italians since our birth in 2009.”  But, like an embarrassed spouse, his colleague Mr. Salvini was quick to point out that the Italian government is against violence. And so are Italians, it must be said. To many foreigners, Italy may look and sound like an endless festival. But this noisy, messy, passionate discussion actually keeps the nation together, especially at times like this. A new migrants’ crisis is taking place over a boat carrying 47 people that has been prevented from docking in Sicily. People shout and argue and many say unpleasant things. But they don’t clash in the street or hate each other. Social tensions in France, Britain and the United States run higher. We have no Yellow Vests in Italy, no Brexit-like psychodrama, no shutdowns and no walls. To be sure, we are arguing again about boats with migrants. But our national pressure cooker is fitted with a valve so that political steam is slowly and safely released. It’s an orchestra of finely tuned humanity, even if that humanity sometimes rises alarmingly in pitch.  For Italians, even disharmony is a sign of sanity, decency and, most important, joie de vivre. And no populist government can change that.

5c2d391c3a125f5075c02977,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/02/obituaries/ray-sawyer-dead.html,"Ray Sawyer, who cut a distinctive figure as a member of the band Dr. Hook and the Medicine Show thanks to his flamboyant style and attention-drawing eye patch, and who sang lead on one of the group’s best-known songs, “The Cover of Rolling Stone,” died on Monday in Daytona, Fla. He was 81. His wife, Linda Lombardi Sawyer, announced his death on Facebook. She did not give a cause but said in a post a week earlier that he had been hospitalized. Mr. Sawyer and the band rose to prominence in the early 1970s with a country-rock sound that later became more lush and occasionally even displayed a disco influence. Dennis Locorriere usually sang lead, but Mr. Sawyer was the most recognizable band member. His eye patch gave the group its name, a sort of skewing of the Captain Hook character from “Peter Pan.” “I’ve had the eye patch since I was 27,” Mr. Sawyer told The St. Petersburg Times in 2010. “I was in a car accident. Some people still ask if it is a gimmick, something to draw attention, but it’s real.” He sang the lead vocal on “Rolling Stone.” (The label of the original single gave the title as “The Cover of Rolling Stone,” though the lyrics he sings use a “the” before the magazine’s name.) The song, a parody about rock ’n’ roll fame, reached the Top 10 of the Billboard pop chart in March 1973. That same month, the magazine did in fact put the band, or at least a caricature of it, on its cover. Ray Sawyer was born on Feb. 1, 1937, in Chickasaw, Ala. Dr. Hook and the Medicine Show was formed in the late 1960s in New Jersey and caught fire after it joined with Shel Silverstein, the cartoonist and sometime songwriter, and played his songs in the 1971 movie “Who Is Harry Kellerman and Why Is He Saying Those Terrible Things About Me?” (directed by Ulu Grosbard and starring Dustin Hoffman). The movie got the band a contract with Columbia Records. Mr. Silverstein, who died in 1999, wrote “Sylvia’s Mother,” a lament about a pay-phone call that in 1972 became the group’s first big hit. It may or may not have been a parody of country ballads, but “The Cover of Rolling Stone,” also written by Mr. Silverstein, was certainly a gag. “We take all kinds of pills that give us all kind of thrills,” the lyrics went, “but the thrill we’ve never known is the thrill that’ll gitcha when you get your picture on the cover of the Rolling Stone.” By the mid-1970s the band had been derailed by mismanagement and was facing bankruptcy. “Somebody was putting the cash away, and it wasn’t us,” Mr. Sawyer told The Toronto Star in 1991. “The bankruptcy court took everything away from us, even the ‘Medicine Show’ part of our name. I haven’t figured out yet why they did that. It’s like taking the Pips out of Gladys Knight and the Pips.” But by 1976 the band, as simply Dr. Hook, was on the comeback trail with a smoother sound, heard that year on a cover of Sam Cooke’s “Only Sixteen.” Later hits included “When You’re in Love With a Beautiful Woman” in 1979. Mr. Sawyer left the group in 1982, and he and Mr. Locorriere later engaged in a legal tussle over rights to the group’s name. Mr. Sawyer continued to perform into this decade. A full list of survivors was not immediately available. "
5c9fcf6349f0eacbf19fb3e5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/30/arts/music/rolling-stones-mick-jagger.html,"The Rolling Stones said on Saturday that Mick Jagger required medical treatment for an unspecified health problem and that the band would postpone its spring tour in the United States and Canada. Jagger’s doctors advised him not to go on the remaining 17 shows of the tour but expected him to make a “complete recovery,” according to a statement from the band. Jagger, 75, apologized to fans. “I really hate letting you down like this,” he said in a tweet. “I’m devastated for having to postpone the tour but I will be working very hard to be back on stage as soon as I can.” The band, which got its start more than five decades ago, performed the first two legs of its “No Filter” tour in Europe during fall 2017 and spring 2018. The final leg of the tour was scheduled to take the band through American cities including Miami, Houston, Denver and Chicago, as well as a venue north of Toronto. The Stones were scheduled to play at New Orleans Jazz Festival in May. The statement from the band suggested that the shows would be rescheduled and recommended that fans hold on to their tickets. Jagger is not the first 1960s-era music icon to show signs of slowing down in old age. In February, the rock guitarist Peter Frampton announced that he had a degenerative muscle disease that could slow his fingers and his ability to move around; he said he would be staging a farewell tour. And last year, two major figures in the ’60s folk revival, Paul Simon and Joan Baez, played farewell concerts. John Covach, a professor of music at the University of Rochester who has taught a course on the band, said that because the Stones remain a rock institution, they had been able to tour as much as they wanted in recent years and still pack stadiums and arenas. But these demanding and exhausting international tours can take a toll. “Who can tour around the country when they’re 70 or 75 years old?” he said on Saturday. He said that for avid fans of the Stones or other landmark ’60s bands, many of whom are baby boomers, news of farewell tours and rock stars dying of natural causes can remind them of their own mortality. “It forces a lot of fans to come to terms with the fact that this music from their youth, the people who produced it, are passing from the scene,” he said. "
5c6da7843a125f5075c0aa5d,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/20/arts/music/gary-clark-jr-this-land-review.html,"Gary Clark Jr. was born in the wrong era. In the 1960s or ’70s, he could easily have forged a career as a first-rank guitar hero: a Texan blues-rocker who can step on any stage and bring the place down with a searing guitar solo. Prospects are different in the 21st century. The idea of a guitar hero was thoroughly undermined by punk and then pushed aside by increasingly computerized pop, dance music and hip-hop. For decades, vintage-style blues and the flesh-on-strings virtuosity it requires have been shunted toward nostalgia, preservationism and the die-hard realms of Americana. In 2019, Clark is an exceedingly rare figure, a bluesman who has a major-label recording contract and a worldwide audience, one he has built by tearing up stage after stage, show after show. While his songwriting has lagged behind his performing, he’s well aware of his strengths; he has alternated studio albums with live ones. [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] On “This Land,” his third major-label studio album, his songwriting has caught up with his playing. It has something to do with experience; now 35, Clark has been performing since his teens. It has something to do with the power of contrariness: that is, Clark’s determination to deliver the raw, analog, spontaneous opposite of crisply quantized digital content. And it has a lot to do with America in 2019, where division, frustration and seething anger can use an outlet with the historical resonance and emotional depth of the blues. The title song of “This Land,” which also opens the album, has the singer settling in on his new 50-acre ranch “in the middle of Trump country,” facing hostile, racist neighbors who want him to “go back where you came from.” He snarls right back: “I’m America’s son. This is where I come from.” The music isn’t typical blues. It’s a reggae vamp pumped up to rock volume, with blues licks spiraling between the vocal lines. Clark claims what he has earned: righteous, defensive and stand-your-ground belligerent. The sound of the album conjures the impact of Clark’s live band. It’s dense, sweaty, overdriven, bristling and unkempt, full of live-wire loose ends. It’s also, in most songs, a studio illusion. Clark produced the album along with Jacob Sciba, his engineer turned co-producer. And the credits of most songs reveal that Clark not only sings and plays guitar, as he does onstage, but also supplies keyboards and programming, abetted by a drummer and a bassist. His songwriting dips into funk, R&B, reggae, metal, arena-rock and hip-hop, and he often embeds song samples and drum-machine sounds in his mixes. Clark hasn’t tried to dwell in any purist blues past. He doesn’t hide his musical models. He harks back to foot-stomping country blues in “The Governor,” a sardonic take on the justice system, and in the lovelorn “Dirty Dishes Blues,” proving his command of blues essentials. He forges direct links from the Ramones to Chuck Berry to the Rolling Stones in “Gotta Get Into Something,” a burst of insomniac adrenaline. His falsetto vocals in “Feed the Babies” and “Pearl Cadillac” echo Curtis Mayfield and Prince, as he sings about parental responsibility and about his own gratitude to his mother. “I Got My Eyes on You” emerges from a roiling caldron of organ and guitar, like early Santana, to pledge unswerving love. And “Feelin’ like a Million,” which follows its opening lines — “Friday night and I just got paid/I’m out looking for some trouble” — toward an ill-advised fling, turbocharges a reggae beat with stabs of distorted guitar and flickers of trap high-hats. Yet each stylistic choice draws on the spirit of the blues: its strength and tribulation, its defiance and self-questioning, its cantankerousness and pain. “Don’t Wait Til Tomorrow” is a remorseful R&B ballad: a denial of infidelity that leads to a confession and a plea to stay together that comes to realize it’s too late. Latin percussion and a string arrangement pull it back toward the 1970s; power chords reinforce its desperate chorus, and Clark plays only a brief, unflashy guitar solo, a futile appeal. The track is at once classic and contemporary; it’s laced with a pitched-up sample of the words “Baby please!” That sample, however, comes from the Mississippi bluesman Elmore James. It’s one more way Clark insists that the past has everything to do with the present. "
5c61bbe43a125f5075c091df,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/11/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-tourism-music-festival.html,"AL ULA, Saudi Arabia — The new Italian-designed concert hall in the middle of the desert shimmered in the sunset light, its walls of mirror reflecting the golden sandstone hills and cliffs. Inside, a symphony orchestra from China rehearsed a Western classical piece, preparing for a concert featuring the Chinese pianist Lang Lang. The serene and lilting notes floated through the empty hall. The concert was part of a series with performances by Andrea Bocelli, Yanni and Majida El Roumi taking place this winter in Saudi Arabia. From the western desert, Saudi Arabia appears to be a different country than the one that has been under constant criticism from American politicians and other international officials since last October, when Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the 33-year-old de facto ruler, was first accused of ordering the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a Virginia resident and Washington Post columnist. The C.I.A. has since concluded that the Crown Prince was responsible for Mr. Khashoggi’s killing, and its strongest evidence includes intercepted conversations. The Saudi government denies he was involved. Prince Mohammed has also come under international criticism for imprisoning human rights activists and detaining hundreds of people in a hotel, as well as for waging a war in Yemen that has fueled what the United Nations calls the world’s worst man-made humanitarian crisis. But at the same time, officials under his rule are trying to build up Saudi Arabia’s tourism and culture industries by promoting events like the music festival. In past years, an event like this would not have taken place in a remote region of the conservative kingdom. The strategy is in line with Prince Mohammed’s efforts to loosen restrictions on entertainment and expressions of popular culture. In developing a tourism industry, officials are focusing on the ancient caravan town of Al Ula in the Hejaz, a western region that has been a crossroads for traders between Mediterranean empires and ports along the Gulf of Aden. “We call this the place of the future,” said Maher Mazan, a manager at Shaden Resort, a new hotel built among rock canyons outside town, where rooms typically go for $440 per night. “If you come back in one year, it’ll be different.” The area’s rich history and archaeological sites have long captivated King Salman, the crown prince’s father. In 2017, the king established the Royal Commission for Al Ula, with the goal of preserving the striking rock archaeology, despite its pre-Islamic origins, and drawing more tourists. The commission also began looking at holding a concert series. The centerpiece of the area is Mada’in Saleh, or Al Hijr, a collection of more than 100 towering tombs carved into hillsides that take on the glow of burnished gold at sunset. This was the southern reach of the realm of the Nabateans, who carved Petra, the famous sandstone city in Jordan. The tombs date back two millenniums, and many Saudis believe them to be cursed, the abode of jinn. Nearby is a preserved station of the defunct Hejaz Railway, an Ottoman-era line built by German and Turkish engineers. By 1908, it ran 800 miles from Damascus to Medina. One afternoon, a guide led a group of foreign visitors by car first to the train station, then to the Nabatean tombs. A guide, Mohammed al-Anzi, said the region had been dominated in ancient times by four different civilizations. Some people had migrated here from Greece, he said, pointing to a carved eagle above a doorway. “Later, the Romans destroyed the Nabateans,” he said. “Civilizations come, civilizations go. This is life, since the beginning of life.” Among the tourists was a Chinese-British couple who gaped at the structures and took photographs and video to post to a Chinese travel website. Walking into one tomb, they asked about three burial niches. Mr. al-Anzi said the custom then was to wrap the dead in animal skins and adorn them with jewelry. Driving out of the area, the tourists noticed abandoned mud-walled homes. “The people were asked to move after this was designated Saudi Arabia’s first World Heritage Site,” Mr. al-Anzi said, referring to a label given by a United Nations agency. The timeless and austere wonders of Mada’in Saleh contrast with the luxury trappings of the music festival, Winter at Tantora. As of early February, at least 30,000 people total had attended the festival’s weekend events, officials said. The festival began Dec. 20 and ends Feb. 23, after being extended two weeks. Hussein Ibish, a scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington, said the entertainment piece of Prince Mohammed’s vision “is very large, and constitutes the revolutionary reintroduction of ‘fun’ to a society in which public entertainments have been basically eliminated for decades.” But because this plan involves exchanges with the West, that creates a conundrum, Mr. Ibish said. “While you are unleashing socially liberalizing and economically modernizing forces that call on, and appeal to, the West — and which must appeal to the West — you’re trying to contain that with a political crackdown that is completely unacceptable and alienating to most Western audiences,” he said. Winter weekends at Al Ula revolve around the concerts, held on Fridays. There are sometimes other notable events, like hot-air balloon rides. The Winter at Tantora website advertises a range of packages for each weekend. All are expensive. For the weekend of the Yanni concert, the prices ranged from $1,400 for a day-trip package (round-trip flight from Jeddah or Riyadh, the capital, included) to $6,000 for a “diamond” weekend package — prohibitive costs for many Saudis. Pop-up restaurants with outdoor seating open among the canyons on weekends. There is a version of Salt, a popular burger restaurant in Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, and Nozomi, a Saudi-run sushi-and-burger restaurant. The visitors sometimes meet local residents of Al Ula in a weekend tourist market, next to the mud homes of the ancient quarter. The festival “has allowed the people of Al Ula to proudly show their home to the world,” said Abdullah al-Khelawi, the royal commission’s head of economic development. He added that the festival provided seasonal work to 1,000 locals. The headquarters of the royal commission, which runs the festival, are in Riyadh, where 100 full-time employees work. “This can start a tourism industry,” said a local driver, Saleh al-Bilawi, 25, who had recently studied criminal justice at an American university. “They employ a lot of drivers just for the winter festival alone.” Mr. al-Bilawi and his colleagues are aware the work is only temporary. Another driver, Faisal, also a university graduate, said he was paid $36 per day and worked only on weekends, but was grateful for the job. The royal commission and the French government have agreed to send 300 to 1,000 local residents to France for training, mostly in the hospitality industry. In September, the first 68 students arrived at Campus France, a French agency, 32 of them women. On Jan. 31, tourists began flying in for the concert by Mr. Bocelli, who was to perform the next night. Most appeared to be wealthy Saudis, although there were some foreign residents of the country, too. The few coming from outside had managed to get tourist visas with the royal commission’s help; Saudi Arabia generally does not give out such visas. A good number of the visitors appeared to be guests of the commission, which was paying their way. An Italian couple sitting in a restaurant at a farm said they had come to Saudi Arabia at the urging of their friend, the Italian ambassador in Riyadh. “We want to see the country before it is affected by the Western world and looks the same as everywhere else,” said Cinzia Chiari, dressed in black robes. “I hope the Saudis realize their treasure and beauty is in its distinct heritage.” "
5c4711f53a125f5075c05a54,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/22/arts/music/chris-brown-rape-paris-allegation.html,"PARIS — The R&B singer Chris Brown was released without charges on Tuesday after he was questioned by the Paris police over a rape accusation, according to the authorities and his lawyer. Shortly afterward, Mr. Brown said in a message on his Instagram account that the accusations were “false” and that his accuser was “lying.” Mr. Brown, 29, had been taken into custody on Monday for questioning about an accusation of aggravated rape and possible drug infractions. Reports in the French news media said that an investigation had been opened after a woman filed a complaint with the Paris police, accusing him of raping her at his hotel last week after they met at a nightclub in the capital. The Paris prosecutor’s office said on Tuesday evening that Mr. Brown had been released without charges but that the investigation was continuing. Mr. Brown’s lawyer in Paris, Raphael Chiche, confirmed that his client had been released but did not comment further on the allegations against him. On his official Instagram page, Mr. Brown posted a picture on Tuesday evening that said “This b!tch lyin’,” an image he had used before in reference to a previous accusation in the United States. In the caption for the picture, Mr. Brown wrote in all caps that he wanted to “make it perfectly clear” that “this is false.” “For my daughter and my family this is so disrespectful and is against my character and morals,” he wrote. According to the celebrity-news magazine Closer, which first reported Mr. Brown’s detention, his questioning came after a woman in her 20s filed a complaint against him. The woman, who was not identified, accused Mr. Brown of raping her in a Paris hotel room last week, the magazine said. The woman told the police that she met the singer on Jan. 15 at a nightclub near the Champs-Élysées and that later that evening, he invited her and several other women to the upscale Mandarin Oriental hotel, where he was staying, Closer reported. According to the magazine, the woman told the police that she then found herself alone in one of the hotel’s rooms, where she said Mr. Brown raped her. She also accused a friend of the singer and his bodyguard of raping her. The Paris prosecutor’s office said on Tuesday evening that two other people who had been questioned by police in connection with the case had also been released without charges, but it did not identify them or explain their connection to Mr. Brown, who has been attending shows in the city for Paris Men’s Fashion Week. Mr. Brown’s record company, RCA, which said this month that it had signed a new deal with Mr. Brown, did not respond to a request for comment. Last week RCA dropped another of its R&B stars, R. Kelly, after protests that followed the airing of the television documentary “Surviving R. Kelly.” In the documentary, women said that Mr. Kelly had lured them into sexual relationships when they were underage, and had abused them mentally and physically. Mr. Brown has been involved in a string of violent episodes over the past few years. In July, he was arrested in connection with a nightclub dispute from April 2017, when he was accused of punching a photographer in Tampa, Fla. In May, a woman sued him, saying he held her against her will at his Los Angeles house last year while a friend of his raped her. He was arrested in 2016 on a charge of assault with a deadly weapon after a standoff at his home. In 2009, he pleaded guilty to one count of felony assault on his girlfriend at the time, the singer Rihanna. Despite his legal troubles, Mr. Brown has remained popular with an ardent fan base. He has won several industry prizes, including the 2012 Grammy for best R&B album for “F.A.M.E.,” and he performed at that year’s Grammy ceremony. His most recent album, “Heartbreak on a Full Moon,” opened at No. 3 on the Billboard album chart in late 2017. In 2010, according to the BBC, Mr. Brown was forced to postpone a British tour after he was denied a visa to enter the country because of the assault conviction involving Rihanna. In 2015, he was forced to cancel the Australian and New Zealand leg of his “One Hell of a Nite” tour for the same reason. Earlier that year, he was barred from leaving the Philippines for three days because of a fraud complaint stemming from a 2014 New Year’s Eve concert in that country. "
5c840deb49f0eacbf105c3ab,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/09/us/politics/amy-klobuchar-2020-staff-interview.html,"There was no real doubt what the first question to Senator Amy Klobuchar would be. Backstage at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Tex., where Ms. Klobuchar was the first in a series of presidential candidates to be interviewed on Saturday, the interviewer, Kara Swisher, asked: “Do you want to start with the comb or end with the comb?” “We’re going to start with the comb,” Ms. Swisher, the co-founder of the technology news website Recode and a contributing opinion writer for The New York Times, concluded. “The comb” was a reference to a February New York Times article about how Ms. Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat, treats her staff in the Senate. In 2008, The Times reported, an aide bought her a salad in an airport but fumbled the plastic utensils. On the plane, Ms. Klobuchar berated the aide, pulled a comb out of her purse and ate the salad with it. “It was me sort of doing a mom thing,” Ms. Klobuchar responded at Saturday’s event, co-sponsored by The Texas Tribune. “I didn’t have a fork. I used a comb to eat a salad very briefly on a plane in a MacGyver move.” The fact that Ms. Klobuchar ate salad with a comb was not the main conclusion of the Times report. She did not mention on Saturday that, after finishing the salad, she handed the comb to the aide and ordered him to clean it. The article, based on interviews with more than two dozen former aides, also included details about how her Senate office employees who took paid parental leave were expected to stay in their job for three times as many weeks as they had taken off — and that if they didn’t, according to an employee handbook, they would be required to pay back the money earned during their leave. In response to the article, Ms. Klobuchar’s office said it had never enforced that policy and would change the handbook. She did not address that on Saturday, and Ms. Swisher did not ask. Ms. Klobuchar, who has previously said she “can be tough on people,” acknowledged — as she has in past responses to reports on her treatment of her staff — that she was “sometimes too tough.” “I can push them too hard,” she said. “I can always do better.” Ms. Swisher then asked if Ms. Klobuchar felt the coverage of her treatment of staff members was sexist, given that many male politicians act similarly. “I’m not going to go there,” she said, adding, “Whatever it is, I just can’t waste my time analyzing it, because the stakes are too high, and I care too much. That’s why I announced my candidacy in the middle of a blizzard by the Mississippi River.” In the rest of the interview, Ms. Klobuchar and Ms. Swisher had wide-ranging discussions on health care, technology, foreign policy and other issues. Ms. Klobuchar expressed support for several policies to lower drug prices, including importing products from Canada (“In Minnesota, we can see Canada from our porch,” she joked); ending the “pay for delay” practice in which big pharmaceutical companies pay manufacturers not to produce generics; and allowing the government to negotiate drug prices with Medicare, a perennial proposal from Democrats. She criticized the relatively short sentence given to the former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort in his financial fraud case this week, citing her experience prosecuting white-collar crime and declaring, “You can’t have two systems of justice, one for the rich and powerful and one for everyone else.” She denounced President Trump for his attacks on the news media, saying he “tweets whatever he wants in the morning but doesn’t respect the amendment that allows him to do it.” She also said she disagreed with Representative Ilhan Omar’s recent comments about American politicians’ support for Israel, “because I believe you can be true to your country and advocate for another country, whether it is Israel or Canada or Ethiopia” — but condemned Mr. Trump for emboldening intolerance, including anti-Semitism, and noted Ms. Omar’s own background as a refugee. Asked about a recent proposal by Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, another presidential candidate, to break up big tech companies like Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook, Ms. Klobuchar refused to commit to it. But she endorsed antitrust action and the breakup of monopolies broadly as “one of the governing principles for ensuring that we have a capitalist system.” Ms. Warren also appeared at South by Southwest on Saturday, speaking with Anand Giridharadas of Time magazine. Mr. Giridharadas began the interview by telling everyone in the audience who either worked for or hoped to work for one of those tech giants to stand, and then asking Ms. Warren to explain to them why she wanted to break up their companies. Picking Amazon as her example, Ms. Warren condemned the ability of such giants to, essentially, play on a field they control. Amazon not only runs a marketplace, she said, but uses its vast trove of information about consumers’ behavior in the marketplace to create and promote its own products. “You can be an umpire — a platform — or you can own teams. That’s fine. But you can’t be an umpire and own one of the teams that’s in the game,” she said. “Break those things apart and we will have a much more competitive, robust market in America. That’s how capitalism should work.” “The monopolist will make fewer monopoly profits,” she added. “Boo-hoo.” Pressed on what this outlook said about her philosophical differences with Senator Bernie Sanders, who is running on a democratic socialist platform, Ms. Warren said she wanted capitalism to work better. “There’s an enormous amount to be gained from markets,” she said. “But markets have to have rules. They have to have a cop on the beat. Markets without rules are theft.” As in her stump speeches, Ms. Warren also spoke at length about the systemic effects of racism, especially in worsening economic inequality. In the 1960s, she noted, when redlining and other forms of housing discrimination were legal, the homeownership gap between black and white Americans was 27 percentage points. Today, it is 30 percentage points. “Race matters,” she said. “And until we say so and attack the problem head on, we are not going to fix it.” "
5cae0db549f0eacbf1f82589,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/10/arts/music/t-bone-burnett-invisible-light.html,"Joseph Henry Burnett, known as T Bone, has spent most of his long career in music behind the scenes. He has won 13 Grammy Awards as a producer, music supervisor and songwriter for albums including “Raising Sand” by Robert Plant and Alison Krauss and soundtracks for “O Brother, Where Are Thou?,” “Walk the Line,” “The Hunger Games” and “Crazy Heart,” which also brought him an Oscar for collaborating on the best original song. Lately his projects have included producing Sara Bareilles’s new album, composing and choosing the soundtrack for HBO’s “True Detective” and working on the debut of a country singer, Logan Ledger. But every so often, Burnett carves out time to record under his own name. This week he releases “The Invisible Light: Acoustic Space,” the first album of a planned trilogy he recorded with the keyboardist Keefus Ciancia and the drummer Jay Bellerose. On his own and in his collaborations, Burnett has become known for twangy, rootsy, naturalistic rock. But “The Invisible Light” veers into stranger territory. Drumbeats lurch and sputter amid eerie, amorphous electronic sounds; instruments like guitars or pianos are relegated to the far distance. In that setting, Burnett speak-sings his way through free-associative songs that contain biblical allusions, echoes of the blues, tall tales, lovers’ plaints and warnings about disinformation, the cult of personality and the encroachments of technology. (The trilogy’s next installment, Burnett said, “is more rocking, more punk rock, and the third edition gets very, very jazz, pretty out there.”) A conversation with Burnett, 71, easily wanders from musical particulars to philosophical speculations and back. He spoke from his home and studio in Los Angeles, where he makes most of his music; he had been awake, he said, since 4 a.m. The following are edited excerpts from the interview. The songs on “The Invisible Light” revolve around technology and theology, with some very dark tidings. I called it “The Invisible Light” for two reasons. It’s from T.S. Eliot’s “Choruses From ‘The Rock’” — he refers to divinity that way. But also, I’m actually optimistic about humanity’s chances, and in all this darkness some light is also contained. Except you have to really listen into it to hear the mirth and the optimism. You also name-check songs like Delbert McClinton’s “Victim of Life’s Circumstances.” The whole album is full of references, and that’s part of the notion of it. Because artists really do only one thing. Artists say, “I went to this place at this time and I saw this thing and it was good.” And we mark it, we mark the things that we think are important and worthwhile. The material isn’t exactly songs or spoken words. How did it come together? I started writing a play with Marshall Brickman, and the ambition for the play is to get it to Broadway one day. That led me to study Frank Loesser, and Lerner and Loewe, and Stephen Sondheim and all the great Broadway writers. Writing for theater is very different than just writing hillbilly songs or rock ’n’ roll songs. You only have a couple of hours to tell the story, and everything in the song has to be part of the narrative. It takes a great deal of discipline. And so I started getting up at 4 every morning and writing for several hours when everything was quiet. I finished writing the music for the play in about a year. But because I’d gotten in the habit of waking up at 4 in the morning and writing, I’ve continued doing that, for about the last three years. It’s this evolving poem that must be about 5,000 lines now, which I would guess someday I will publish as a poem. That became the sheet music in essence. I would pull a group of lyrics out of this stuff and give it to Keefus and give it to Jay, and we would just start jamming. Melody is really codified inflection. In all of the lyrics there were melodies already hanging around in them, ghost melodies, and some were specific melodies. It’s maybe a form of Beat poetry. I certainly still think of myself as part of the Beat Generation. One song, “A Man Without a Country,” ends with two full minutes of ambient landscape sound, almost silent. Why? One could think of this album as a film that hasn’t been made that we’re scoring. Part of what we’re after is the fact that the electronic universe has been shrinking and fragmenting our attention spans for decades now. I want to create periods of time where people can just sit in pure sound without stimulation, where we can allow ourselves to relax into pure sound. It’s not really that nothing’s happening. It’s something’s happening but we don’t know what it is, so to speak. Musicians praise the drum sound in your productions, and drums are way up front on this album. What’s the secret? There was a time in the 1970s when everybody was dampening down drums and trying to take all the overtones out and focus purely on attack. But all of the most interesting sounds of the drums are the sounds of the overtones that react with one another and create other melodies and other rhythms within the piece. Which are the very things that get covered up by the guitars and the basses and the more normal instruments that are brought forward in a mix. By taking all those away you’re able to hear what the drums actually are doing. We do it by playing very, very softly so that the attack is minimized. The trick, if it’s a trick, or the technique since it is technology, is to place the microphones so that they hear all of the tone and the overtones of the drums and then they also hear the tone and overtones of the adjacent drums. The room we’re recording all these pieces in is a very small bedroom, so you can only play so loud. Yet the sound of the tracks suggests huge spaces. That is the idea, to conjure these open, wild spaces. We wanted it to be an indefinable place, a dangerous place, a dark place, yet within it there’s all this life. There are also a lot of warnings: about a “celebrity-in-chief,” about lies and willful self-deception. There’s an extraordinary experiment in behavioral modification going on now. We live in a time now where leaders emerge from fiction and create the politics of eternity where there are no facts. That’s an extremely dangerous place to live. The “politics of eternity” is from Timothy Snyder’s “The Road to Unfreedom.” I think it’s the most important book of the 21st century so far. It’s a well of sanity. Do you think about who your listeners are? No, other than that the listeners are human beings and I have a love and a caring for humanity, and I hope that comes through. This is anti-anti-human music. There’s a lot going on in the world that is anti-human at the moment, and this is fighting that. Art has to be irresistible. It can’t be pedantic or instruct or preach. I certainly have been accused of preaching in the past, and I hope I’ve overcome any tendencies I’ve had in that direction. More than preaching I’ve been raising the alarm. Hopefully I’ve gotten good enough at it so that I’m not preaching, but just ringing the bell. "
5c65ebe03a125f5075c09cc6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/arts/music/fbi-ryan-adams.html,"The F.B.I. is looking into whether the singer-songwriter Ryan Adams, 44, committed a crime by engaging in sexually explicit communications with an underage fan, according to a law enforcement official with knowledge of the matter. As reported by The New York Times on Wednesday, Adams and a young woman, who said her online communications with the singer began when she was 14 and continued until she was 16, exchanged text messages and conducted video calls that sometimes included nudity. The two never met in person. Adams, through his lawyer, Andrew B. Brettler, has denied that he “ever engaged in inappropriate online sexual communications with someone he knew was underage.” On Thursday, Brettler said that he had not been contacted by law enforcement. He declined to comment further. [Read our report: Ryan Adams dangled success. Women say they paid a price.] In response to The Times’s article, F.B.I. agents in the bureau’s New York office on Thursday took the first steps to open a criminal investigation, according to the official, who declined to be identified because the person was not authorized to discuss it publicly. The agents, from the Crimes Against Children Squad, will seek to interview the woman, the official said, and try to obtain the text messages and any other evidence she may have in her possession. If they find her account credible, they will take other investigative steps, which could include subpoenaing both her cellphone records and those of Adams from their service providers, the official said. Federal law bars the sexual exploitation of children under 18, defining a violator as anyone who “persuades, induces, entices or coerces any minor to engage in” a visual depiction of sexually explicit conduct. Several legal experts said that decisions on whether to prosecute such cases could hinge on whether the adult reasonably believed the minor was of legal age, taking into account context from their conversations. While the inquiry was in its earliest stages, the official said that generally in such cases, agents seek to interview a victim’s friends and family members to determine whether they made contemporaneous statements about the contact. [Ryan Adams’s album release has been canceled amid an F.B.I. inquiry.] A lawyer for the woman, now 20, declined to comment as her family deliberated how to proceed. The Times identified the woman by her middle name, Ava, because she was a minor during these interactions. An F.B.I. spokeswoman, Amy J. Thoreson, declined to comment Thursday when asked about the matter. The Times reviewed extensive communication between Adams and Ava, including direct messages on Twitter that began when she was 14, and more than 3,000 text messages spanning a nine-month period when Ava was 15 and 16. The text messages from late 2014, when Ava was 16, included explicit photographs of her. She said the pair also conducted video calls on Skype, where Adams exposed himself during phone sex. The Times has reviewed screenshots of these interactions. Throughout their communication, Adams asked Ava, a successful bass player since she was 12, repeatedly about her age. “Do me a paranoid favor,” he wrote in November 2014, when he was 40 and she was 16. “Show me you are 18.” He invoked others accused of targeting girls, including R. Kelly. Sometimes, in response to Adams’s prodding, Ava said she was older than she was. More than once Adams asked to see her identification, although she never provided any in the messages reviewed by The Times, and their sexual conversations continued. Brettler said that Adams did not recall these conversations and added that while the singer has corresponded with fans and aspiring musicians online, Adams “does not recall having online communications with anyone related to anything outside of music.” Brettler also provided photos of Ava, in which he said her appearance suggested “that she was in her 20s.” After the publication of the article, Adams posted on Twitter on Wednesday to apologize to “anyone I have ever hurt, however unintentionally,” though he continued to dispute the accuracy of The Times’s reporting. “I would never have inappropriate interactions with someone I thought was underage,” he wrote. “Period.” Ava and other women interviewed by The Times said that Adams often dangled potential career opportunities as he pursued female artists in sexual scenarios. “Music was a point of control for him,” said Adams’s ex-wife, the singer and actress Mandy Moore. Adams, a Grammy-nominated rock singer famous for his contributions to the genre known as alternative country, has released 16 studio albums and announced plans to release three more this year via Blue Note and his own Pax-Am Records. Capitol Music Group, which oversees those labels, declined to comment. The allegations that Adams manipulated and harassed women in the music industry sent ripples through the business. “We’re all fed up,” the singer Vanessa Carlton wrote on Twitter. Bethany Cosentino, the singer of Best Coast, said that the same story “could literally be written about so many dudes in music.” And Tamara Lindeman of the Canadian band the Weather Station added: “Having to perpetually question if a potential collaborator is interested in you musically or personally is an enormous and unspoken barrier for women in music.” Jason Isbell, a country singer who is scheduled to appear on one of Adams’s upcoming albums, wrote on Twitter that he had been unaware of Adams’s alleged behavior. Asked if he believed the women’s accounts, Isbell responded: “Yep.” "
5c40b5c23a125f5075c04f3a,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/arts/music/philharmonia-baroque-richard-egarr.html,"Many orchestras pass their batons from one conductor to another. Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra, based in San Francisco and one of the country’s most respected period-instrument ensembles, will be passing its harpsichord, too. The orchestra announced on Thursday that its next music director would be the conductor (and harpsichordist) Richard Egarr, who will succeed the conductor (and harpsichordist) Nicholas McGegan, stepping down from the post in 2020, after 35 years. Mr. Egarr is currently the music director of the Academy of Ancient Music in Britain, where he took over from its founder, Christopher Hogwood, in 2006. He will step down from that post — where his tenure included performing Purcell’s “Dido and Aeneas” in Libya — in 2021. Mr. Egarr said in a telephone interview that he looks forward to leading the Philharmonia Baroque, which he has conducted three times since 2012 — and which he said that, for all its differences, also bore some resemblances to the Academy of Ancient Music. “What is similar is there is a very free spirit,” said Mr. Egarr, 55, who was born in Lincoln, England, and who now lives in Amsterdam with his family. He will begin in the 2020-21 season as music director designate, and officially assume the title the following season. Mr. Egarr said that he looked forward to exploring a wide array of repertoire — including early-17th-century works by composers including Monteverdi; Bach’s passions and B-minor Mass, which he said he would like to perform with the Philharmonia Chorale; and some Romantic pieces, such as Schumann’s Requiem, a rarity he recently led. “It has had terrible press ever since it was written,” he said, “but it’s actually a little masterpiece.” "

Age: 29 Hometown: Born in Tripoli, Libya, Gashi and his family lived in 24 countries before settling in Brooklyn when he was 11. Now lives: He splits his time between a spacious loft in Beverly Hills, Calif., and a new house in the Kensington area of Brooklyn that he bought for his parents in 2017. Claim to fame: Gashi is a rising rapper and singer who has collaborated with DJ Snake, French Montana and other big industry names. His eclectic style (he sometimes wears a patterned scarf tied on his head) and self-aware lyrics (his song “YouTube Comments” tackles cyberbullying) stem from his worldly upbringing.  “It’s very rare for a kid like me — a refugee — to say things like, ‘I live in L.A.,’ ‘I moved my parents into a bigger home,’ ‘I got my father a car,’” he said. “It doesn’t feel real. I’m afraid if I blink I will miss this moment.” Big break: As a young boy in Munich, Gashi made money for his family by performing Michael Jackson moves on the streets. He hasn’t stopped grooving since. In 2016, a video of him dancing to his breakout single “Disrespectful,” filmed by his mother, blew up online, spurring millions of streams on SoundCloud and a deal with Roc Nation.  During a meeting with RCA Records soon after, he wowed a conference room full of executives with an energetic impromptu performance. They signed him on the spot. “All my life, I can never stand in one place when I’m listening to music,” he said. Latest project: His public persona defies neat labels. In January, he recorded a cover of “Hurt” by Nine Inch Nails at Spotify’s New York Studios. The following month, he made his TV debut on “the Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,” performing his single “My Year,” with G-Eazy and a blizzard of confetti.  “The thing that shocked me was how small the studio was,” Gashi said. “Everything on TV looks super-huge, but in reality it’s like a small elementary school auditorium.” Next thing: His debut album with RCA Records drops this year. “The album is basically about a rapper who is stuck in a time machine and is forced to make ’80s music,” he said. “I am the trap Phil Collins.” His mask: Before his record deal, Gashi made ends meet by helping out his father, who worked as a janitor at his family’s apartment building in Brooklyn. “People would bully me and be like, ‘How can he be a rapper if he’s a garbageman?” he said. “So, my mother said to me, ‘Why don’t you wear a ski mask so they don’t see you?’”  He is now rarely seen without a neon-orange balaclava mask rolled into a tight skull cap. “I wear my ski mask before a performance to get into my zone,” he said.

5ca7904e49f0eacbf1f8137b,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/05/arts/music/phil-the-hall-review.html,"If you genuinely want neighbors who have never been to your house to drop by, you have to make a point of inviting them. This simple act of courtesy is the mission of Phil the Hall, the New York Philharmonic’s new initiative to reach out to a wide array of dedicated New Yorkers, including emergency medical workers, public service professionals and volunteers, and welcome them to special programs offering $5 tickets and general-admission seating. The Philharmonic contacted some 30 organizations, including Coalition for the Homeless, El Centro del Inmigrante, the Bowery Mission, New Women New Yorkers, God’s Love We Deliver and Queens Public Library. So David Geffen Hall was packed for the first concert on Thursday. The New York City Fire Department alone requested more than 1,000 tickets for the combined four performances. In her opening remarks, Deborah Borda, the Philharmonic’s president, welcomed everyone “to our house.” Yet, “from now on,” she said, hopefully, “you feel that this is your house, too.” For the Dutch-born Jaap van Zweden, in his first season as the Philharmonic’s music director, Phil the Hall offers a chance to introduce himself. The program he led, which lasted 75 minutes without intermission, combined works that showed the diversity of classical music, like Steven Stucky’s somberly beautiful “Elegy” from the 2008 oratorio “August 4, 1964,” and a few greatest hits, like the insistent first movement of Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony and Wagner’s exhilarating “Ride of the Valkyries,” performed here to the hilt. The orchestra chose an ideal host for the occasion, Nia Imani Franklin, a former Miss New York and the current Miss America. A trained soprano, Ms. Franklin also has a master’s degree in musical composition and is using her platform to advocate for arts education. [Check out our Culture Calendar here.] It was a great idea to include premieres of shorts works by two participants in the Philharmonic’s Very Young Composers program: Paloma Dineli Chesky and Mack Scocca-Ho, who are both 11 years old. Ms. Chesky’s “Rising,” an inspirational song, was written during a period of family difficulties, she told the audience. The music is meant to show that no matter the challenge, you can rise above it. She sang the soaring melody as the orchestra backed her with swaying strings and glistening percussion. Mr. Scocca-Ho’s “Ociantrose” is named for the capital of a made-up country where unity and order come from the people and are not imposed from above, he said in introducing the work. The music is brassy and industrious, with Baroque-like strands of crisscrossing lines, though the busyness gets interrupted by rhythmic disruptions. Mr. van Zweden led lively accounts of Bernstein’s Overture to “Candide” and Copland’s “Hoe-Down,” from “Rodeo.” The orchestra was joined by the Westminster Symphonic Choir for an ardent performance of Copland’s “The Promise of Living” from the opera “The Tender Land” and also the final work, Beethoven’s “Ode to Joy,” a very truncated version of the finale from the Ninth Symphony. Before conducting the ode, Mr. van Zweden said that Beethoven’s symphony is about “bringing the community together,” which is “what we did with you tonight.” "

PAT GREEN at Terminal 5 (March 2, 7 p.m.). Escape to the Lone Star state at this show, which features four acts whose sound belongs to the Texas-specific country subgenre known as red dirt. Green, who had a string of radio hits in the mid-2000s, is the elder statesman of this lineup. He’ll be joined by the Eli Young Band, who are currently on the country charts with their upbeat single “Love Ain’t,” as well as by Aaron Watson and Kyle Park — two artists who are stalwarts on the rodeo circuit. The common thread is a rough-around-the-edges, rock-tinged take on country music that never strays too far from the genre’s dancehall roots. 212-582-6600, terminal5nyc.com ICE CUBE at Terminal 5 (March 6, 8 p.m.). Gen Z might only know this pioneering Los Angeles-based rapper as an approachable blockbuster star or, most recently, one of the moguls behind the BIG3 basketball league. But this N.W.A. alum still has a rich catalog of songs that were once considered subversive but are now classic. Both in N.W.A. and as a soloist, Ice Cube helped revolutionize rap with his cleareyed lyrics about police brutality, white supremacy and gang life. His unflinching political observations continue on his 2018 release “Everythangs Corrupt,” which includes a song called “Arrest the President.” 212-582-6600, terminal5nyc.com INNOV GNAWA at National Sawdust (March 2, 7:30 p.m.). This collective of Moroccan expatriates makes gnawa, or ritual trance music. It bears some of the same stylistic traits as American blues: call-and-response singing and a stringed instrument (in the case of gnawa, a sintir) that is used to establish harmony. The complicated, endlessly cycling rhythms, though, are distinct to the genre and create a soothing, meditative ambience. This performance is billed not as a concert, but as an “immersive gnawa ritual.” 646-779-8455, nationalsawdust.org [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] LOVE ROCKS NYC at the Beacon Theater (March 7, 8 p.m.). For the third year running, the designer John Varvatos and the real estate broker Greg Williamson have organized an all-star concert to benefit the New York charity God’s Love We Deliver, which provides food and support to people with life-threatening illnesses. This year’s edition will star Robert Plant, Sheryl Crow, Buddy Guy, Grace Potter, Keb’ Mo’, Taj Mahal, Lukas Nelson, Doyle Bramhall II, Bernie Williams, Ivan Neville, Ann and Nancy Wilson, and more, while Whoopi Goldberg and Martin Short host. Even the house band will be filled with music’s A-listers, including Paul Shaffer, the former musical director of “Late Show With David Letterman,” and the prolific drummer Steve Gadd. 212-465-6000, beacontheatre.com THE NEW COLOSSUS FESTIVAL at various locations (March 7-10). For 35 years, the CMJ Music Marathon was New York City’s very own pleasantly overwhelming indie music festival, where up-and-coming artists took over performance spaces every October in the interest of getting heard by myriad journalists and record label reps trolling for talent. But it ended in 2016, and a new festival aims to fill the void it left behind while also catching international artists en route to South by Southwest in Austin, Tex. In its first year as a multiday event, at six different clubs across the Lower East Side, the event will feature over 100 acts, including the Canadian D.I.Y. act Ellis, the Brooklyn-based punk band Thick and the Norwegian alt-pop group Das Body. newcolossusfestival.com KODIE SHANE at S.O.B.’s (March 6, 8 p.m.). At a moment when there are more commercially successful women in rap than there have been at any point since the early 2000s — when, in fact, one of the genre’s biggest and buzziest artists, Cardi B, is a woman — it looks even more foolish than usual to define M.C.s like Chicago’s Kodie Shane by their gender. The 20-year-old rapper, who is based in Atlanta, first drew recognition as a member of Lil Yachty’s Sailing Team collective and favors similarly melodic, AutoTuned verses over trap beats. In place of Yachty’s whimsy, though, on songs like “Sing to Her,” Shane tends toward the undeniably sultry. 212-243-4940, sobs.com SUZANNE VEGA at Café Carlyle (March 5-9, 8:45 p.m.; through March 16). This New York-based singer-songwriter has been composing and performing folk-inspired acoustic tunes since she was a Barnard student in the early 1980s. The venerable cabaret Café Carlyle might be considerably more upscale than Tom’s Restaurant — the Upper West Side student haunt that inspired Vega’s enduring and influential single “Tom’s Diner” — but both offer a glimpse of a bygone New York. A product of the bohemian Greenwich Village folk scene, which has all but disappeared, Vega herself presents an evening of time travel to a completely different period in the city’s history. 800-405-2027, cafecarlylenewyork.com NATALIE WEINER AMBROSE AKINMUSIRE at the Village Vanguard (March 5-10, 8:30 and 10:30 p.m.). A young trumpeter at the top of his game, Akinmusire is coming off the release of last year’s “Origami Harvest,” his stellar fifth album, featuring long-form compositions for voice, string quartet and jazz combo. In the coming week he returns to the Vanguard — a familiar stomping ground — with his quintet, which features Walter Smith III on tenor saxophone, Sullivan Fortner on piano, Harish Raghavan on bass and Justin Brown on drums. Expect original music with a smoky, drifting aesthetic, and group interplay that overflows the formal boundaries of most small-group jazz.212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com KURT ELLING at the Rose Theater (March 1-2, 8 p.m.). An esteemed jazz crooner whose vocal power is matched by his cool sensitivity to each song, Elling presents the premiere of “The Big Blind,” a drama in the format of an old radio musical. Written by Elling and the composer Phil Galdston, it tells of a young jazz singer in midcentury Chicago who’s trying to catch his big break. The show’s cast includes the vocalist Dee Dee Bridgewater (a National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master), the stage actor Ben Vereen, the drummer Ulysses Owens Jr.’s New Century Jazz Orchestra and a Foley artist providing live sound effects.212-721-6500, jazz.org IMPROV NIGHTS at Happylucky No. 1 (March 1-2, 8 p.m.). John Zorn continues to expand the footprint of the Stone, his avant-garde presenting shop, which left behind its spartan digs in Alphabet City last year and moved to the New School’s Glass Box Theater. Now Zorn is planting a flag in central Brooklyn, too: This weekend his new series debuts at Happylucky No. 1, a gallery and event space in Crown Heights. The Stone will be programming concerts there each weekend going forward. (Bookings have already been made through the end of 2019.) Things are kicking off in classic Stone fashion: two nights of round-robin improvisations with some of New York’s leading creative musicians (the cellist Okkyung Lee, the guitarist Mary Halvorson, the percussionist Cyro Baptista and more than a dozen others) performing in randomly thrown-together configurations.www.happyluckyno1.com JULIAN LAGE TRIO at Le Poisson Rouge (March 5, 8:30 p.m.). Lage, a 31-year-old guitar virtuoso, just released a winning new album, “Love Hurts.” It might be the closest thing he’s released to a straight-ahead jazz record. But with the bassist Jorge Roeder and the drummer Dave King — two left-field improvisers a generation ahead of him — at his side, a freewheeling, rock-tinged vibe finds its way in through the seams. Ever the adaptive player, Lage leans into the influences of Pat Martino and John Scofield here, playing his distorted electric guitar in snaky, spiraling lines. The trio’s repertoire ranges from Ornette Coleman to Roy Orbison to some of Lage’s own tunes.212-505-3474, lpr.com ADAM O’FARRILL’S BIRD BLOWN OUT OF LATITUDE AND AARON BURNETT AND THE BIG MACHINE at National Sawdust (March 5, 7 p.m.). A blazing young trumpet talent, O’Farrill will unveil a new nine-piece ensemble that plays original music with a political bent: The tunes he writes for Bird Blown Out of Latitude are inspired by the traumas caused by displacement and forced migration. The tenor saxophonist Burnett is, like O’Farrill, an arresting improviser with an idiosyncratic, confrontational approach to composition. Here he will present material from his recently released album, “Anomaly,” with his combo, the Big Machine.646-779-8455, nationalsawdust.org LINDA MAY HAN OH QUINTET at the Miller Theater (March 2, 8 p.m.). As part of a continuing jazz series at the Miller, Oh, a young bassist, will lead a quintet, showcasing her sturdy, propulsive original compositions, likely drawing from her fine 2017 album, “Walk Against Wind.” Her band at the Miller features the alto saxophonist Greg Ward, the guitarist Matthew Stevens, the pianist Fabian Almazan and the drummer Allan Mednard.212-854-7799, millertheatre.com ALFREDO RODRIGUEZ AND PEDRITO MARTINEZ at Jazz Standard (Feb. 28-March 3, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). Rodriguez, a pianist, and Martinez, a percussionist and vocalist, are masters of Afro-Cuban rhythm who both hail from Havana, though they learned their craft in different settings: Rodriguez at clubs and solares — the housing units where much of Cuba’s African musical inheritance is passed down — and Martinez at various conservatories in the city. On “Duologue,” their new, Quincy Jones-produced album, the pair find plenty of generative energy in the space between their styles. They appear at the Standard in an unadorned duo.212-576-2232, jazzstandard.com GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO "
5c8181bc49f0eacbf105bec0,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/07/arts/music/migrations-the-making-of-america-immigration.html,"What do migrants bring with them? On a one-way trip to an unknown new life, perhaps they might pack money, documents, clothes, some small keepsakes. Invisibly and intangibly, they also carry cultural memories: the lullabies their parents sang, the dances they tried at a wedding, the best way to cook a chicken. On new territory, those memories become a link to home and also, with any luck, something to share with the neighbors. It’s the American story, repeated with countless variations for each new arrival; it’s also a hot-button subject in politics worldwide. And it’s the theme for “Migrations: The Making of America,” a citywide festival that gets into gear this weekend, with Carnegie Hall at its center along with more than 75 partner organizations around the city, including the New-York Historical Society, the Irish Arts Center, Harlem Stage, the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research, El Museo del Barrio and the Vietnam Heritage Center. The festival encompasses dance workshops, panel discussions, and walking tours of Harlem along with concerts large and small. “So many different cultures and so many different ethnicities want to tell their story,” said Clive Gillinson, the executive and artistic director of Carnegie Hall. “It tells you something about the potency of the subject.” Carnegie’s own programs focus on three historical migrations to and within the United States: the Irish and Scottish influx in the 18th and 19th centuries; Jews arriving from Russia and Eastern Europe from the late 19th century until the 1924 National Origins Act set quotas on immigration; and the Great Migration of 6 million African-Americans from the South to northern industrial cities. British Isles immigrants brought a repertoire that seeded Appalachian and country music. The Jewish contingent brought essential songwriters to Tin Pan Alley and Broadway. And the Great Migration disseminated blues, jazz, gospel and the other glories of African-American music. When you consider that “some of the most sublime inspirational art you could ever imagine” came out of appalling situations, Mr. Gillinson said, “I think it tells you a lot about what human beings are able to do in transmuting some of the most painful and hardest things in life into something that can actually uplift everyone.” The far-reaching jazz pianist Jason Moran and the opera-trained mezzo-soprano Alicia Hall Moran, his wife, along with guests from jazz, rock, gospel and classical music, address the Great Migration in a Carnegie Hall concert on March 30 titled “Two Wings.” Its foundation, the Morans said in a phone interview, is the book “The Warmth of Other Suns” by Isabel Wilkerson, who will appear. Songs on the program like the spiritual “Two Wings” and the blues “Route 66,” buoyant as they seem, are nonetheless about escape. “The root is sheer terror,” Jason Moran said. “It’s people having to retreat, people having to hide, people having to gather what few belongings they have and do some real improvisation and go to some other city — only to get to that city and discover some other trials later on.” Jewish heritage and its American evolution will have a flagship concert on April 15. “From Shtetl to Stage: A Celebration of Yiddish Music and Culture,” produced by the author Seth Rogovoy, gathers classical musicians (the violinist Gil Shaham and the pianist Evgeny Kissin), klezmer musicians (the clarinetist David Krakauer and the trumpeter Frank London, the show’s musical director), singers and actors to explore the Yiddish theater and its extensive influence. At Zankel Hall, the klezmer clarinetist and mandolinist Andy Statman will lead his trio on March 14, and Michael Feinstein will perform “The Great American Jewish Songbook: Kern, Berlin, Arlen, Rodgers and More” on March 27. The Scots-Irish facet of the festival begins March 9 with a dedicated segment of “Live From Here,” the American Public Media radio show hosted by the eclectic mandolinist and songwriter Chris Thile. “I was a bizarre choice to host this one, seeing as I’m a Southern California boy with no detectable Scotch-Irish heritage to speak of,” Mr. Thile said by phone. (Most of his ancestry is German.) “But in another way, it makes a lot of sense, because it’s about how much influence those migrations have had on American culture and American life.” He added, “Music and the artistic benefits of an ethnically diverse society are undeniable. This country would be nothing without all of the various peoples who are here. What would we have, musically speaking, had we just kept this place all to our initial selves? To say nothing of the fact that it wasn’t ours to begin with.” On April 6 at Zankel, the festival will present the Gloaming, a quintet of Irish and American musicians who merge deeply traditional Irish fiddling and singing with daring, often luminously introspective harmonies and arrangements. To Martin Hayes, a fiddler from County Clare who founded the group, the Gloaming continues a century-long dialogue between Irish music and its American diaspora, restoring some of the subtleties that were discouraged by the limitations of early recordings and the guitar-strumming enthusiasm of the 1960s folk revival. “There is a thread of unacknowledged, deeper emotional expression that got ironed out of the music in some ways,” Mr. Hayes said. In the Gloaming’s music, “Lots of things can happen, but the only rule is that they actually amplify and develop the innate feeling that happens inside the melodic structure.” Meanwhile, the melting pot continues to simmer. The Migrations festival has embraced a series now in its fifth year at the Flushing Town Hall arts center: Global Mashups, which presents double bills of musicians from disparate traditions for an audience that comes to dance. Dance steps are taught before the performance, and after each group plays its own set, they jam together — an accelerated version of American music’s cross-pollination. “By the end of the night, you’re not a stranger any more,” said Ellen Kodadek, the executive and artistic director of Flushing Town Hall. This year’s lineup begins March 9 with the category-defying Hazmat Modine — a blues-rooted group that can swerve into New Orleans brass-band jazz, ska or klezmer — and Falu, a singer born in Mumbai who will be performing music from vintage Bollywood films and from Holi, a Hindu spring festival of renewal and forgiveness. Falu represents the 11th generation of a family of Hindustani classical musicians; she immigrated to the United States 20 years ago, and studied Western songwriting at Berklee College of Music. Her Indian-rooted children’s album, “Falu’s Bazaar,” was a nominee at the most recent Grammy Awards. “My purpose in making ‘Falu’s Bazaar’ was to keep the tradition living,” she said. “To give everybody who has immigrated, who has a different culture to latch onto, who has some story to tell, to give validation that your song matters, your story matters.” She has no qualms about the cross-cultural jam with Hazmat Modine. “Music is the most unifying power,” she said. “We’re going to bring people together.” "
5c869c2e49f0eacbf105c738,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/11/arts/music/chicago-symphony-orchestra-strike.html,"A new round of labor upheaval hit the classical music world on Sunday night, when the musicians of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, one of the finest ensembles in the nation, went on strike in an effort to preserve their defined-benefit pension plan. The players — who are among the best-paid in the field, earning a minimum annual salary of $159,000 last season, and often more — began walking a picket line outside Orchestra Hall on Monday morning. In recent years, ticket sales have covered an ever-smaller portion of the cost of putting on classical performances. That has put pressure on orchestras to raise more money from donors — but also to try to cut expenses, leading to tensions with their unions. This fall, the Lyric Opera of Chicago’s orchestra went on a brief strike and wound up agreeing to a contract guaranteeing fewer weeks of work. Two seasons ago, the Philadelphia Orchestra, the Pittsburgh Symphony and the Fort Worth Symphony found themselves on strike simultaneously. There are several areas of dispute in the negotiations in Chicago, which have gone on for 11 months without an agreement, but the pension is the main sticking point. The orchestra’s management and board have warned that the growing expense of the current pension plan, which guarantees a set benefit for life after retirement, is unsustainable. They said in a statement that the orchestra contributed $3.8 million into the musicians’ pension fund this year — up from $803,000 just two years ago because of new federal requirements — and that those annual contributions were projected to continue rising sharply. Management’s proposal has called for switching the musicians into a defined-contribution plan, similar to a 401(k), in which the orchestra would put a set amount of money into individual retirement accounts for the players, who could invest it as they chose. Cynthia Yeh, a percussionist on the players’ negotiating committee, said in a statement that the defined-benefit plan “has been the hallmark of the orchestra’s benefits package (and those of other leading orchestras) for over 50 years.” She said the board’s proposal “strips the membership of that guaranteed benefit and shifts the investment risk to the individual member.” Helen Zell, the chairwoman of the orchestra’s board, said in a statement that “it would be irresponsible for the board to continue to authorize a pension program that jeopardizes the orchestra’s future.” While many other industries have shifted to cheaper defined-contribution plans in recent decades, defined-benefit plans remain the norm at the nation’s largest orchestras — and players around the country have made preserving them a priority. But many are underfunded. The American Federation of Musicians and Employers’ Pension Fund, a large multiemployer plan covering thousands of musicians, is currently considered “in critical status,” and if its condition worsens, it could trigger a rare move to cut the benefit payments for those already retired. Last week, as the deadline the Chicago players set for an agreement neared, the orchestra’s eminent music director, Riccardo Muti, wrote a letter supporting the musicians to Ms. Zell and Jeff Alexander, the orchestra’s president. “As music director and a musician of this orchestra, I am with the musicians,” Mr. Muti wrote, urging the management to “remember that theirs is not a job but a mission” and speaking of the performers’ need for “tranquillity and serenity.” Mr. Muti is scheduled to lead the orchestra in a program of Rossini, Vivaldi, Beethoven and Wagner on Thursday.

5cb1e2bc49f0eacbf1f83bc8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/13/arts/music/coachella-guava-island-donald-glover.html,"“Guava Island,” a new 55-minute film starring Donald Glover and Rihanna, was released as a limited-time free stream on Amazon overnight Saturday, during Glover’s headlining set as Childish Gambino at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. The mysterious project, which has been teased for months, features Glover as Deni, a singer hoping to bring the mystical island of Guava together with a music festival, while Rihanna plays his girlfriend, Kofi, and provides voice-over during a fairy-tale-like animated introduction about the fictional location and its valuable blue silk. Nonso Anozie (“Game of Thrones”) and Letitia Wright (“Black Panther”) also appear. With a plot involving exploited workers, the struggles of musicians and a society divided between red and blue, the film incorporates themes present in much of Glover’s recent work, from the hit FX series ""Atlanta"" to his viral, Grammy-winning song and video for “This Is America,” which is interpolated in “Guava Island.” [Read the NYT review of “Guava Island.”] The film was written by Glover’s brother Stephen and directed by his longtime collaborator Hiro Murai, who was also behind the camera for much of “Atlanta” and “This Is America.” Following its premiere on the grounds of Coachella on Thursday, and the Childish Gambino show on Friday night, “Guava Island” was made available for anyone to watch on Amazon for 18 hours starting Saturday at 12:01 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time; it will then be available exclusively to Amazon Prime subscribers. Shot in Cuba and inspired by the Brazilian crime epic “City of God” and Prince’s “Purple Rain,” “Guava Island” does not ultimately feature much new music from Childish Gambino — or any singing from Rihanna. The movie opens with a breezy unreleased number from Glover (“If the world ends/I think I wanna die with you”) and has elements of another song with the lyrics, “Maybe the sky will fall down on tomorrow/but one thing’s for certain baby/we’re running out of time.” It also incorporates alternate versions of recent Childish Gambino singles like “Summertime Magic” and “Feels Like Summer,” along with “Saturday,” which Glover debuted on “Saturday Night Live” last year (“God, this 9 to 5 just keep on killing me,” he sings). In one scene set in a factory, another character tells Deni that he hopes to save enough money to make it to America. “It’s different there,” the man says. “I heard people are their own bosses.” Deni responds: “This is America. Guava’s no different than any other country,” adding, “America is a concept. Anywhere where in order to make yourself rich, you have to make someone else richer is America.” He then leads a choreographed dance to the song that mirrors some of the music video. At Coachella on Friday night, Glover — who has thrown his own festival, Pharos — did not make a show of plugging “Guava Island,” though he did incorporate tropical imagery and sounds into his set. For one unreleased song, he cleared a section in the crowd to scream over a cacophonous burst of complex drum rhythms, bathed in almost-apocalyptic red lights. He also performed the still-unreleased track “Human Sacrifice,” which debuted in a Google ad during the Grammy Awards in February. Glover was overcome by emotion onstage while discussing the deaths of his father and the rappers Mac Miller and Nipsey Hussle. “What I’m starting to realize is all we really have is memories at the end of the day,” he told the crowd. “All we are really is like, data — you pass it on to your kids, you pass it on to your friends, your family.” “While we’re here,” Glover added, “feel something and pass it on.” "
5ca1045549f0eacbf1f7afea,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/31/world/europe/italian-minister-pans-hit-song-by-an-immigrants-son.html,"MILAN — Alessandro Mahmoud recently won a prestigious Italian song contest with his Italian-language rap tune “Money,” tinged with a Middle Eastern flavor. The lyrics recall how his Egyptian father “drank champagne during Ramadan” or beckoned him home from the playground with calls of “waladi habibi ta’aleena” — Arabic for “My son, my love, come here.” But it turns out that Italy’s interior minister, Matteo Salvini, was not a fan of the song. “#Mahmood............... meh............ The most beautiful Italian song?!?” Mr. Salvini wrote on Twitter following the result last month. Soon after, a member of his anti-immigrant League party proposed a law to limit foreign songs on the radio. Since then, Mr. Mahmoud, whose stage name is Mahmood, has been thrust into the center of a national debate about what it means to be Italian at a time when critics say the country’s most powerful politician seems intent on stoking racism and xenophobia — not only against new migrants but also legal immigrants who have lived in Italy for years. To that, Mr. Mahmoud, a 26-year-old of Sardinian and Egyptian ancestry, has an easy answer. “I’m super Italian, 100 percent,” said Mr. Mahmoud, who, in further proof of his nationality, still lives at home with his mother. Enter the venerable Italian pop song, timeless to its fans and stuck in time to its detractors. But music experts say it is ever-changing and has always been influenced by foreign styles. “Now we have to understand what is Italian music,’’ Mr. Mahmoud, dressed in a red corduroy jacket, floral shirt and wide-legged pants, said as he sat in a cafe on a recent day. ‘‘It can’t always be the same. Life moves on. Italian music needs new points of view.” He seemed unbothered by the criticism swirling around his victory and showed a text message that Mr. Salvini, an ever-astute politician, had written to him after the controversy exploded. “Ciao, Matteo Salvini here, notwithstanding the musical tastes — I prefer the other guy — enjoy the success. Here’s my number,” it read. Mr. Mahmoud wrote back that he was “sure there wasn’t anything personal.” But in retrospect, he said of Mr. Salvini’s tweet, “obviously there was something underneath it.” The minister “provoked ignorant comments,” Mr. Mahmoud said, such as people questioning how an Egyptian could win the Sanremo Italian Song contest, a cherished national institution. Mr. Mahmoud was born and raised in a neighborhood outside Milan to a Sardinian mother who met his Egyptian father in one of the coffee bars where she worked. As a young boy, he said he listened to Arabic music with his father until his father left when he was five. “And you can tell those melodies stayed in my head,” he said. He attended elementary school in Milan with Russians, Chinese and kids of many other nationalities. He had his Catholic communion and confirmation, took piano lessons, and listened to Italian singer-songwriters Lucio Dalla and Paolo Conte. He was steeped in the soft piano intros and top-of-the-lungs crescendos of the contemporary Italian melodic tradition. As he grew older, he became more influenced by Italian rap and American R&B stars like Frank Ocean, who challenged stereotypes when he came out as gay. Mr. Mahmoud said he has an aversion to being categorized, when it came to his nationality or sexuality. “I don’t feel part of that Italy that judges,” he said. He walked down the block to rehearse his winning song in a nearby studio with some fellow Italian rappers, who were less forgiving of Mr. Salvini’s tweet. “It’s so explicitly racist,” said Fabio Rizzo, a 39-year-old Sicilian rapper known as Marracash who has played on his being mistaken for a Moroccan by riding camels in a music video. “It’s incredible, no? Not even the hypocrisy to hide it.” The Milanese rapper Cosimo Fini, 38, whose stage name is Gué Pequeno, added of Mr. Salvini, “Unfortunately, for me he is expressing the thought of many Italians. Xenophobia, racism.” Mr. Salvini argues that his political enemies discredit themselves by tagging him as a racist or Fascist for everything he says or does, including his preference for one singer over another. But after he voiced his frustration with the result of the song contest, in which a special jury overturned the vote of the home audience, a lawmaker in his League party, Alessandro Morelli, proposed legislation requiring that at least a third of songs on the radio had to be Italian. Mr. Morelli is the former president of Radio Padania, the in-house League station where Mr. Salvini cut his teeth as a DJ. “If we exclude American music, Italian music is the one that has conquered five continents,” Mr. Morelli said nostalgically. The League proposal had the support of some of the mainstays of an Italian music scene that often seems cryogenically stuck in another century. “In Italy, we have about 80 percent foreign music and maybe 20 percent of Italian music,” said Albano Carrisi, better known as Al Bano, whose love life, including his onetime marriage to the daughter of Tyrone Power, has been a staple of Italian variety shows for a half-century. (Statistics showed nearly half the songs on the radio were Italian.) Mr. Carrisi attributed the longevity of Italian singers like himself on Italian television to the advanced age of the television audience. He put Mr. Mahmoud squarely in his category of Italian singers, but the rapper’s hit song was another matter. “It’s sung in Italian,” Mr. Carrisi said. “But Italian music is another thing. That’s not it.” Mr. Carrisi, who recently sang his 1967 hit with Mr. Salvini at the Interior Ministry, where the singer was promoting his wine company, said that Italian easy listening music was more melodic. The exemplar, he said, was the refrain of ‘‘Volare,’’ the winning song at Sanremo in 1958 — and was uncorrupted by the influence of American rap. Mr. Carrisi, who was blacklisted this month by Ukraine apparently in part for serenading Vladimir Putin in Moscow at a 100th anniversary celebration of the KGB, traced the roots of Italian easy listening back to Gregorian chants and Verdi. But some Italian music experts disagreed. Jacopo Tomatis, author of the new book, “The Cultural History of the Italian Song,” said there was a clear continuity between the songs popularized during Fascism and the postwar hits that Italians built their musical identity around. He pointed out a 1951 bulletin of the Italian state broadcaster that explained how Sanremo began as an effort to protect the Italian song against “the influence of African-American and Latin-American music.” The centrality of “Italianness” to the country’s music was ironic, he said, because “popular Italian music has always been an elaboration of foreign styles.” That foreignness is more explicitly celebrated by Italians such as Mr. Mahmoud and Ghali Amdouni, a rising Italian star of Tunisian ancestry, who is also from outside Milan. In his hit “Dear Italy,” he raps, “When they tell me to go home, I answer I’m already here.” Mr. Amdouni launched his new album at the local prison a few minutes from Mr. Mahmoud’s recording studio. For now though, the moment belonged to Mr. Mahmoud, who will represent Italy in next month’s Eurovision song contest. That same night, a circle of 7-year-old girls sang Mr. Mahmoud’s hit song as they waited in line at a local club. Mr. Mahmoud was there to chat with Milan’s mayor about reaching out to the city’s youth. “In the face of the Salvini’s words, I shrugged, and I thought let me use this opportunity to show a positive example,” the mayor, Giuseppe Sala, said backstage. On stage, the mayor showed a packed room Mr. Mahmoud’s elementary school class picture. Three children of Egyptian parents from the singer’s neighborhood shouted with joy when Mr. Mahmoud sang a couple bars of his song. “He’s such a good singer,” one of them, Habiba Ibrahim, 13, said. “And he’s so cool.” "

[Check out our Culture Calendar here.] The goal, according to Clive Gillinson, Carnegie Hall’s executive and artistic director, is to examine the indelible link between the mass movement of people over the past century and American history. “We are inviting audiences to look more closely at how the migrations of people to and within this country, and the evolution of art forms that they have developed here, have been powerful influences on the creation and development of American culture,” he said in a statement. Carnegie Hall will amplify the musical legacies of three migrations: the arrival of Eastern European and Russian Jews between 1881 and 1924; the Irish and Scottish migrations of the 18th and 19th centuries; and the Great Migration of African-Americans from the rural South to the big cities of the Northeast, Midwest and West between 1917 and the 1970s. Three headlining shows will represent musical culture, with traditional Scots, Irish and American folk music; Yiddish musical theater; and jazz and blues. [Read about Jacob Lawrence’s famous paintings of the Great Migration.]  Six additional musical soirees (two per motif) will offer contemporary takes on the music — like new-fashioned renditions of Irish and Celtic sounds and klezmer rhythms infused with soulful bluegrass — highlighting how immigrants’ artistry often straddles cultures in America’s melting pot. Cultural events presented by partners will be broader in scope. Such interdisciplinary events, from the Museum of the City of New York, El Museo del Barrio and American Irish Historical Society, examine issues surrounding identity, cultural diffusion and what it means to be an American. More than 100 exhibitions, panels, dance performances, concerts and culinary events are planned. For many institutions, the festival provides a welcome platform to draw attention to the distinct experiences of their communities. The YIVO Institute for Jewish Research, for example, has delved into its extensive archives and has organized an exhibition of prescient cartoons published in Der Groyser Kundes, the Lower East Side’s premier Yiddish satirical weekly paper in the early 1920s. The exhibition, “The Door Slams Shut: Jews and Immigration in the Face of American Reaction,” focuses on New York’s idiosyncratic history in welcoming migrants. “Because our collection has such a large number of documents and artifacts relating to immigration, it just seemed like a perfect fit to explore these complex dynamics,” Eddy Portnoy, YIVO’s director of exhibitions, said in a phone interview. The China Institute, a nearly 100-year-old nonprofit organization, will host an immigration-related panel with the award-winning playwright David Henry Hwang (M. Butterfly) and the musician Du Yun on March 13. More information is at carnegiehall.org/migrations.  "
5cb0ffb249f0eacbf1f838dc,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/12/arts/music/coachella-live-stream.html,"Merely headlining Coachella? You’re doing it wrong. These days, the festival’s biggest past and present stars are hacking it. From new films by Donald Glover and Beyoncé to a one-morning-only Easter performance by Kanye West, this year’s fest in Indio, Calif., comes with a shadow billing of bonus, semi-sanctioned content aimed far beyond the main stage.  The extracurricular activity signifies the evolution of one of the country’s largest music festivals from a mostly self-contained arbiter of status — able to confer cultural relevance in a font size on its lineup posters — into something more like an all-purpose tool for today’s globally minded performers, accustomed in the digital age to serving many audiences at once and on their own terms. For fans, more off-platform programming at Coachella means it’s easier than ever to avoid FOMO without coughing up a half-grand and trekking to the desert. Here’s a short guide. The rapper Childish Gambino, alias of the entertainer Donald Glover, is unveiling a new movie and has a headlining set this weekend. A mysterious trailer for the film, called “Guava Island,” had its premiere at Glover’s PHAROS festival in November, crediting the co-stars Rihanna, Letitia Wright, Nonso Anozie and the director Hiro Murai (“Atlanta,” “This Is America”), and sending internet sleuths into overdrive. The secrets of “Guava Island” were revealed Thursday night at an early screening on the Coachella campgrounds, and it debuted during Childish Gambino’s set. The movie is neither a visual album à la “Lemonade,” as some fans predicted, nor a traditional feature, but something in between. Kyle Buchanan of The New York Times attended the screening and described it as “a music-driven fable” set in Cuba that pairs refurbished Gambino hits, including “This Is America” and “Summertime Magic,” with a slight plot concerning love, music and capitalism.  The film will be available to stream free on Amazon for 18 hours, from 3 a.m. to 9 p.m. Eastern on Saturday and will remain available for Prime Video members. Saturday, April 13, 3 a.m. Eastern All year, Kanye West has been hosting a roving, informal, invite-only Sunday morning concert series — Sunday Service — featuring a gospel choir and sanctified renditions of his songs and others.  Guests have reportedly included Katy Perry and David Letterman, but the Coachella crowd (and viewers watching on the live stream) will get to hear the gospel on the second Sunday of the festival, which falls on Easter this year.  In January, Billboard reported that West had originally been set to headline both weekends of the festival, but he pulled out at the last minute because of a dispute over his desire to perform in a custom dome. It’s unsurprising, then, that he’s chosen an equally nontraditional venue for the Sunday Service show — a hill (or “mountain,” as West called it in an announcement video) on land usually reserved for campgrounds. Sunday, April 21, Time T.B.A. (West has said 9 a.m. Pacific.) One of the most disruptive Coachella performances in recent memory took place last year, when Beyoncé — the first African-American woman to headline the festival — transformed her set into a robust, kinetic survey of the collegiate traditions and musical lineage of black America. That show is the subject of “Homecoming,” a new, behind-the-scenes documentary debuting on Netflix the Wednesday between the two weekends of this year’s festival.  The original performance was the most-watched Coachella live stream ever, with more than 458,000 concurrent viewers. Now, the artist will deliver a remixed, 360-degree view of the experience to Netflix’s millions of subscribers. Wednesday, April 17  For the first time, Coachella will live stream its second weekend on YouTube in addition to Weekend 1. Tune in for a special at-home viewing experience featuring short documentaries on, and original commentary from, top-billed performers. April 19-21  "

This week, I’ve looked to my colleague Josh Barone for reports on Yuja Wang’s concert at Zankel Hall with the music-comedy duo Igudesman & Joo, which had sketches and jokes about sex and race that Josh found troubling. He reviewed the program. But we felt there was still more to explore. So he wrote this thoughtful piece about the event and the line between satire and offense. Please read it, and let us know what you think. Coming up this weekend at the Los Angeles Philharmonic is an intriguing small festival devoted to William Grant Still and music of — and inspired by — the Harlem Renaissance. Still’s First Symphony, which will be played on Saturday, gets some play; his Fourth, set for Sunday, very little. Take a listen: Some other things to catch you up on: The conductor Daniel Harding, who’s had trouble with American orchestras, is dipping his toe in this country again. Here’s a playlist of some of his best recordings: The ensemble Blue Heron has made a specialty of nearly vanished music of the English Renaissance. Listen to what it’s uncovered: And “Rigoletto” returned to the Metropolitan Opera, to little effect. Enjoy the weekend! ZACHARY WOOLFE Szymanowski’s First Violin Concerto (1916) was the oldest work on the Boston Symphony Orchestra’s program last Friday. But it felt like the most modern. That isn’t a dig against the other two pieces: Olly Wilson’s 1981 “Lumina,” and Copland’s Third Symphony, which was given its premiere by the Bostonians in 1946. But they seemed conservative compared with the Szymanowski — a restless, single-movement adventure that dances back and forth between lyricism and mayhem. The orchestra, enthusiastically conducted by Andris Nelsons, seemed almost gleeful as the concerto’s hodgepodge sonority was at its most raucous and exotic. Lisa Batiashvili, the soloist, was the calmest person onstage. Yet she was also the most thrilling to watch, and virtually flawless as she navigated her mercurial part’s taxing blend of harsh double stops, screeching high notes and soaring melodies. JOSHUA BARONE The baritone Gerald Finley may be best known for creating the role of the ambitious, tormented J. Robert Oppenheimer in John Adams’s 2005 opera “Doctor Atomic.” His latest appearance at the Met was in the title role of Bartok’s “Bluebeard’s Castle.”  It was chilling to witness Mr. Finley, with his warm, robust voice, bringing such subdued malevolence to the murderous Bluebeard. I was reminded of a completely different triumph for Mr. Finley at the Met, in the title role of Rossini’s masterpiece “Guillaume Tell” in 2016.  Here he is in a poignant excerpt from the Act III aria “Sois immobile,” when Tell, who has been arrested, is ordered to shoot an arrow into an apple balanced on the head of his beloved son. He instructs the young man to stay completely still while calling upon God. Mr. Finlay conveys an aching mix of outward assurance and inner panic. ANTHONY TOMMASINI "
5c60dd433a125f5075c0900b,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/10/arts/music/michelle-obama-grammys.html,"Follow our coverage and analysis of the 2019 Grammy Awards. Those expecting a ho-hum Grammys night were surely jolted awake on Sunday when, just minutes into the show, Michelle Obama walked onto the stage hand-in-hand with Lady Gaga, Jada Pinkett Smith and Jennifer Lopez. They were joined by the host Alicia Keys. In the surprise appearance, which doubled as a moment of female solidarity the Grammys needed, Obama spoke to the crowd as it erupted in applause and cheers. “All right, all right, we got a show to do,” Obama, who wore a loose-fitting shimmering silver jumpsuit, said playfully when the audience wouldn’t settle down. [Here’s the full list of Grammys winners.] “From the Motown records I wore out on the South Side to the ‘who run the world’ songs that fueled me through this last decade, music has always helped me tell my story, and I know that’s true for everybody here,” she continued, referring to the Chicago neighborhood where she was raised. “Whether we like country or rap or rock, music helps us share ourselves, our dignity and sorrows, our hopes and joys. It allows us to hear one another, to invite each other in. Music shows us that all of it matters — every story within every voice, every note within every song. Is that right ladies?” she said as many in the crowd remained standing. The moment could not have come at a better time for the show. Last year, the event, which has struggled to stay relevant, came under fire for a statement made by Neil Portnow, the chief executive of the Recording Academy. Women in music should “step up” to advance their careers, he had said. The academy has since changed its membership and nominations process in efforts to address underlying problems of inequality. On Sunday night, the women onstage with Obama spoke about how music gave them a space to explore who they are. “They said I was weird, that my look, my choices, my sound, that it wouldn’t work,” Lady Gaga said. “But music told me not to listen to them. Music took my ears, took my hands, my voice and my soul, and it led me to all of you and to my Little Monsters who I love so much.” Next, Pinkett Smith spoke. “We express our pain, power, progress through music — whether we’re creating it, or just appreciating it,” she said. “But here’s what I know: Every voice we hear deserves to be honored and respected.” Lopez closed out the segment. “Back in the Bronx, music gave me a reason to dance, from hip-hop to freestyle, pop, soul and salsa,” she said. “It kept me moving from the block to the big stages and even bigger screens. It reminds me where I come from, but it also reminds me of all the places I can go. Music remains the one place we can all feel truly free.” [See all the looks from the Grammys red carpet.] "
5c8ac13249f0eacbf105d234,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/14/arts/music/nyc-this-weekend-pop-rock-jazz.html,"Our guide to pop and rock shows and the best of live jazz happening this weekend and in the week ahead. ANTIBALAS at Brooklyn Bowl (March 15-16, 8 p.m.). This Brooklyn-based Afrobeat band is celebrating 20 years together with a two-night run, during which they will perform the kind of large-ensemble party music — think a vibrant horn section and multiple percussionists — that’s made them so irresistible for the past two decades. Their work incorporates dub, funk and jazz, creating a rich, textured version of the kind of global dance sound that’s become increasingly popular over the course of their career. On Friday, the music collective Innov Gnawa will open, and on Saturday, the hip-hop group Poetic Thrust will kick things off. 718-963-3369, brooklynbowl.com GARY CLARK JR. at the Beacon Theater (March 21-23, 8 p.m.). As a gifted blues guitarist, this Austin, Tex., native could easily stick to traditional sounds. But Clark continues to make songs that are expansive and forward-looking. He channels his remarkable technical ability toward hard-edge, political and genre-bending music that is nevertheless rooted in the blues, or at least its angst and earnestness. On his most recent album, “This Land,” he tackles racism and American politics through tunes that are anything but easy listening — and all the better for it.212-465-6000, beacontheatre.com GUSTER at the Beacon Theater (March 16, 8 p.m.). Since the members of this alternative rock band met during orientation at Tufts University in 1991, they have made consistently upbeat and pleasantly eccentric albums. Their latest, “Look Alive,” is their first release in four years, but their enthusiasm hasn’t dulled — at least if the album’s bright, polished, synth-driven indie-pop track list is any indication. Its sound is as approachable and harmony-rich as that of the songs that earned the still-independent band spots on mainstream soundtracks like “The O.C.” and “Wedding Crashers.”212-465-6000, beacontheatre.com [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] HABIB KOITÉ at Le Poisson Rouge (March 15, 8 p.m.). A virtuosic guitarist, Koité has cultivated his own niche within the string-rich musical culture of his native Mali. He uses unorthodox tunings and incorporates a global mix of flamenco and blues into his interpretation of dansa, a traditional form of Malian music from his hometown, Kayes. The resulting sound has reached international audiences and gained fans like Bonnie Raitt. Perhaps best known for his approachable 1998 album, “Ma Ya,” Koité, 61, continues to act as an ambassador of Mali’s music.212-505-3474, lpr.com LOUDON WAINWRIGHT III at Sony Hall (March 15, 8 p.m.). You might have already seen this show — it’s the live version of Wainwright’s recent Netflix special, “Surviving Twin,” which itself is the filmed version of a one-man set he’s been performing since 2013. “Surviving Twin” takes its title from a Wainwright song of the same name, which is about the singer-songwriter’s relationship with his father, Loudon Wainwright Jr.; the show, though, is about relationships between fathers and sons more broadly, including Wainwright’s son and fellow performer, Rufus.212-997-5123, sonyhall.com DALE WATSON AND KINKY FRIEDMAN at Union Pool (March 16, 7 p.m.). Two Texas titans visit Brooklyn this week to perform a brand of country music that’s so traditional, it has made them outsiders. Watson favors a polished rockabilly shuffle that sounds straight out of the 1960s, while Friedman tempers his irreverent, occasionally profane tunes with twangy guitar and banjos. Both are beloved for their willingness to buck trends (and any chance of mainstream success) and deftly play country music that transports listeners anywhere — even in Williamsburg — to an old-fashioned honky-tonk. 718-609-0484, union-pool.com NATALIE WEINER CARLA BLEY TRIO at Jazz Standard (March 19-20, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). Unlike her compositions — a lovable admixture of American folk songs, avant-garde jazz, soft rock and Romanticism — Bley, at age 82, remains a rather inaccessible figure. She doesn’t tour often, and she has long preferred the scholarly remove of a composer’s identity to the more public one of a bandleader. All of which makes this appearance, featuring her longstanding trio (Bley on piano, Steve Swallow on bass and Andy Sheppard on saxophones), something especially worth seeking out.212-576-2232, jazzstandard.com MARÍA GRAND at Roulette (March 21, 8 p.m.). A dauntless young tenor saxophonist whose concept and ambition seem to grow broader by the week, Grand is unwilling to accept anything as a given — stylistically, culturally, whatever. This concert, which she has titled “Music as a User’s Manual,” is meant to upend the passive relationship between audience and performance. How will she achieve this? That, presumably, depends on you as much as on her. But we know this: The first portion of the night will feature Grand alone, on saxophone and vocals; she’ll then be joined by Ganavya Doraiswamy on vocals, Joel Ross on vibraphone and Rajna Swaminathan on mridangam, for a separate set.917-267-0368, roulette.org LARRY GRENADIER at Zürcher Gallery (March 15, 8 p.m.). A leading jazz bassist since the 1990s, when he was a member of Brad Mehldau’s watershed trio, Grenadier recently put out his first solo-bass recording, “The Gleaners.” The album feels like a peek into a private world, as if you’re discovering the poems of a great writer who was known only for his essays. (In actuality, it’s inspired by film: specifically, Agnes Varda’s famed documentary about potato harvesters, “The Gleaners and I.”) For much of the record Grenadier focuses on arco playing, showing great range: He can use the bow to create spritzed, lively rhythms or a luminous, slow immersion. Abstraction would seem inherent to a solo-jazz-bass performance, but there’s nothing dreamlike about this album; his sound is as direct and powerful as it is elegant.galeriezurcher.com THANDISWA MAZWAI AND NDUDUZO MAKHATHINI at the Africa Center (March 15-16, 8 p.m.). Mazwai is an A-list celebrity in South Africa, where she upholds a long tradition of politically engaged pop singing. She rose to prominence in the 1990s as the lead vocalist in Bongo Maffin, a famed group in the kwaito genre (a kind of house music). In the years since she has become known as a solo artist carrying on the legacies of Miriam Makeba, Brenda Fassie and other vocalists who blended jazz, pop and South African folk music. Here she appears alongside Makhathini, a young pianist with a thriving career as both a sideman and a solo artist, always guided by an attentiveness to music’s potential for healing and renewal. This concert is presented as part of the Salon Africana series, which features performers chosen by the vocalist Somi.salonafricana.com CHARLES TOLLIVER at the Blue Note (March 14-17, 8 and 10:30 p.m.). A trumpeter with a strong, unvarnished attack, Tolliver launched his recording career in 1968 with the release of “Paper Man,” an epochal record reflecting the blend of post-bop, psychedelic rock, salsa and increasingly militant funk being played around New York City at the time. He celebrated the 50th anniversary of the record’s release last year in a triumphant performance at the Charlie Parker Jazz Festival, and this weekend at the Blue Note he will reprise the reprisal once again. In addition to the alto saxophonist Gary Bartz — who was in the quintet that recorded the original album — he will be joined by the pianist Vijay Iyer, the bassist Buster Williams and the drummer Lenny White.212-475-8592, bluenote.net ‘UNFORGETTABLE: THE MAGIC OF NAT KING COLE’ at Flushing Town Hall (March 15, 8 p.m.). The pianist and vocalist Nat King Cole — who died in 1965, at the height of his fame — would have turned 100 on Sunday. In honor of his life and legacy, the svelte and subtly inventive vocalist Sachal Vasandani will interpret songs from Cole’s repertoire with an all-star band: Shai Maestro on piano, Reuben Rogers on bass and Obed Calvaire on drums.718-463-7700, flushingtownhall.orgGIOVANNI RUSSONELLO KAREN O AND DANGER MOUSE at Florence Gould Hall (March 20, 7 p.m.). Jon Pareles, chief pop music critic for The New York Times, hosts an evening of music and conversation with the Yeah Yeah Yeahs frontwoman Karen O and the musician and producer Danger Mouse. On Friday, the duo will release “Lux Prima,” their first-ever collaboration. The audience will get to hear a selection of songs from the album during this discussion.timestalks.com "
5c6352b33a125f5075c095c5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/12/arts/21-savage-released.html,"Lawyers for the Britain-born rapper 21 Savage say he will be released on bond on Wednesday after spending more than a week in the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which said it had arrested him for being in the United States illegally. Kuck Baxter Immigration, the law firm representing the rapper, whose legal name is She’yaa Bin Abraham-Joseph, posted news of his pending release on its Facebook page on Tuesday afternoon. “In the last 24 hours, in the wake of the Grammy Awards at which he was scheduled to attend and perform, we received notice that She’yaa was granted an expedited hearing,” the post said. “Today, 21 Savage was granted a release on bond. He won his freedom.” Mr. Abraham-Joseph, 26, was arrested in the early hours of Feb. 3 during an operation by federal and local law enforcement authorities in Atlanta, Immigration and Customs Enforcement said at the time. The agency said in a statement at the time that he was a British national who had entered the United States on a nonimmigrant visa in 2005 and was supposed to leave the following year. The agency also said that Mr. Abraham-Joseph was convicted of felony drug charges in Fulton County, Ga., in 2014. One of Mr. Abraham-Joseph’s lawyers, Charles Kuck, said that conviction was vacated and the charges were dismissed by prosecutors in 2018. A member of the rapper’s legal team, Dina LaPolt, said in a statement after his arrest that he had been “left without legal status through no fault of his own” because “as a minor, his family overstayed their work visas.” Mr. Kuck said his client was 12 when his immigration status expired. Mr. Abraham-Joseph was nominated for a Grammy Award for record of the year for “Rockstar,” a song with the rapper Post Malone, but did not win at the awards ceremony on Sunday. Known for his flat delivery and subdued rap style, his album “I Am > I Was” opened at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in January. Charles Kuck, another member of Mr. Abraham-Joseph’s legal team, said Tuesday that the rapper had been granted release but would have to spend one more night in custody. “We actually can’t get him out today because ICE stops taking money at 2 o’clock and the judge’s decision came down at around 2:15,” Mr. Kuck said. “He’ll be released in the morning.” Mr. Kuck declined to say what bail had been set at or where his client was being detained, but he said Mr. Abraham-Joseph had been treated well. “The facility where he has been held has been extraordinarily gracious to him, his legal team and his family,” Mr. Kuck said. “They have treated him well and we are grateful for their hospitality, as best as that can be in a jail cell.” A spokesman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. Mr. Abraham-Joseph’s next date in immigration court is set for April 11, Mr. Kuck said. The Facebook post from Mr. Abraham-Joseph’s lawyers on Tuesday said that he wanted to draw attention to immigration detainees who are not as well known as he is. “He will not forget this ordeal or any of the other fathers, sons, family members, and faceless people he was locked up with or that remain unjustly incarcerated across the country,” the post said. “And he asks for your hearts and minds to be with them.” "
5c6a03ed3a125f5075c0a329,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/17/arts/music/21-savage-ice-interview.html,"ALPHARETTA, Ga. — For the last four years, 21 Savage has been one of the stalwarts of Atlanta rap, a rising star who has collaborated with Drake and Cardi B, among many others, and become one of the signature voices in the city. His December album “I Am > I Was” spent two weeks at the top of the Billboard chart, and his collaboration with Post Malone, “Rockstar,” was nominated for two Grammys. With that success has come more visibility. In late January, he performed his single “A Lot” on “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,” adding a new verse in which he rapped about children being separated from their parents at the border. A few days later, early in the morning on Super Bowl Sunday, Feb. 3, 21 Savage (born She’yaa Bin Abraham-Joseph) was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, who said he was an “unlawfully present United Kingdom national” who had overstayed his visa. He remained in ICE custody at the Irwin County Detention Center in South Georgia until Feb. 13, when he was released on $100,000 bond. The next day, he was in a hotel room in a suburb north of Atlanta, surrounded by several members of his legal team. Dressed in somber all-black, he spoke at length about his childhood, his time in detention, the Grammy Awards ceremony he missed and how growing up without legal status shaped the person he became. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. Do you remember first arriving here when you were young? Yeah, everything was like, bigger. I come from the poor side of London. My grandma house is real skinny. So when we first moved here, we was living in the hood still, but it was, like, way bigger. The toilet size, the bathroom size, it was just different. But I fell in love with it. It’s all I know. Did you have a British accent? Yeah, I had a accent, ’cause my first day of school they was making fun of me so I beat somebody up, and they was calling me “taekwondo kid.” My mama whupped me, she made me stay in the house. So I know I had a accent, but I been here 20 years — I don’t know what happened to it. Do you remember when you became aware that your status wasn’t settled? Probably like the age when you start to get your driver’s license. I couldn’t never take driver’s ed, I couldn’t never go get a job. About that age. Was it something you wanted to get taken care of? It felt impossible. It got to the point where I just learned to live without it. ’Cause I still ain’t got it, I’m 26, and I’m rich. So, just learned to live without it. Like a lot of other immigrants. We struggled but we couldn’t get food stamps, we couldn’t get government assistance. I learned how to live without. You know in school, when you get to a certain age, your clothes make you popular? I learned how to be popular without that. People respected me just for me. Do you think the situation taught you to carry yourself a certain way? It made me who I am. I wouldn’t write it no other way if I had the choice. If they said, “Hey, you could start your life over and make yourself a citizen,” I wouldn’t have never did it. I still want to go through this right here ’cause it made me who I am, it made me strong. Were you aware that there was a possibility that at some point you might not be able to stay in the country? Yeah, for sure. It’s like my worst nightmare. That’s why it’s always been trying to get corrected. Even if you got money, it ain’t easy. It ain’t no favoritism, and I respect it, I honestly respect it. It would be kind of messed up if they treated rich immigrants better than poor immigrants, I think. How draining was it being in detention, especially with the uncertainty of how long it was going to last? It really wasn’t jail, it was the possibility of me not being able to live in this country no more that I’ve been living in my whole life. All that just going through your head, like, “Damn, I love my house, I ain’t gonna be able to go in my house no more? I ain’t gonna be able to go to my favorite restaurant that I been going to for 20 years straight?” That’s the most important thing. If you tell me, “I’ll give you 20 million to go stay somewhere you ain’t never stayed,” I’d rather be broke. I’ll sit in jail to fight to live where I’ve been living my whole life. I’m sure you were spending a lot of time in your head. I could have made myself go crazy. I think they really try to break you. It’s like we gonna put you in jail and we gonna make you fight your case the slowest you can fight it so that you just want to go home. Nobody want to sit in jail, especially if they don’t have the money to fight it and they ain’t been to court in three months. What do you think has happened in your life that gave you a different perspective? It was what was at stake. It’s like, I got three kids, my mama, everything that I know is here in Atlanta. I’m not leaving Atlanta without a fight. We gon’ fight all the way till the last day even if that mean I sit in jail for 10 years. Were you upset about missing the Grammys? Nah, I was stressed about getting out. The Grammys is the Grammys, but when you in jail, the Grammys is nothing. I got to watch it. By that time they had put a TV in my room. Was the original plan that you’d be part of the Post Malone performance? Yeah I was supposed to perform. He wore the 21 Savage shirt, so I felt like I was there. I don’t care what nobody say — everybody in that building who’s connected to this culture, I was on their mind in some type of way. That’s all that mattered. They didn’t have to say it ’cause everybody knew it. It was in the air. All the people that was there, they said the words in other places and that matter just as much. All the big artists was vocal about the situation, so I was appreciative. Even the memes. They didn’t stress you out? Some of them was funny — I ain’t gonna lie. I was appreciative of that. I coulda been another person who just, “He locked up? Damn,” and nobody said nothing. Some people, I see why they was mad. It ain’t about the meme, it’s about the bigger picture. But I done been through way worse things in my life than somebody putting me on a meme. I been shot — what is a meme? A meme is nothing. That’s something on the internet that I can do like this [turns over phone] and never see again. I look at bullet scars every day, so it’s like, a meme, bro? Do you feel a responsibility to speak up about your circumstances? Yeah, I feel a responsibility. My situation is important ’cause I represent poor black Americans and I represent poor immigrant Americans. You gotta think about all the millions of people that ain’t 21 Savage that’s in 21 Savage shoes. Do you feel an urge to put some of this experience into music?

5c420db03a125f5075c052a6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/18/arts/music/sabine-devieilhe-review-carnegie-hall.html,"For a coloratura soprano, the Fire Aria from Ravel’s “L’Enfant et les Sortilèges” — high runs and Queen of the Night histrionics — is a perfect showcase for technical wizardry and spunk. So it made sense for Sabine Devieilhe, a rising star in her native France who has won acclaim at the leading opera houses of Europe, to include it in her debut at Carnegie Hall’s Weill Recital Hall on Thursday. But Ms. Devieilhe’s impetuous and sparkling rendition of that showpiece was only the encore — an afterthought, really — for an evening of delicate, nuanced French art songs. It says something about the confidence of this 33-year-old artist that she felt no need to offer a grab bag highlighting her strengths. The program she assembled, songs by Debussy and his circle, was refined and cohesive. And it still held plenty of opportunities to show off her nimble singing and radiant tone. Ms. Devieilhe also had a superb partner in the pianist Mathieu Pordoy, whose artistry helped to make this an evening of first-rate chamber music. His finely contoured playing, especially in numbers by Debussy, stood out for its clarity and light pedal use. He revealed details in music that other pianists tend to dissolve in a reverberant haze. Clarity was also the defining quality of Ms. Devieilhe’s performance, both in her lucid, evenly weighted tone and in her meticulous attention to language. Her program drew heavily on settings of quietly enigmatic texts, whether by Symbolist poets like Paul Verlaine or Sanskrit miniatures filtered through the lenses of Western translators. Ms. Devieilhe embraced the emotional ambiguity of such works using tone color to bring out glints of surreal humor — as in Ravel’s “Sur l’herbe” — or draw a moody veil over an entire song, as in Albert Roussel’s “Le jardin mouillé.” (That song was one of two about rain: While Roussel rendered the irregular patter of drops rolling off leaves, Debussy’s “Il pleure dans mon coeur” captured the regular drum of precipitation on city streets and the rushing of water in gutters.) In Poulenc’s “Fêtes galantes,” with its affectionate portrait of a busy street scene, Ms. Devieilhe found a gossipy, conversational tone close to that of a chanson singer. Debussy’s “Chevaux de bois,” about a carousel on a rural fairground, also drew forth chatty and bright singing. But the most arresting moment, and a taste of Ms. Devieilhe’s virtuosity, came without words or accompaniment. In 1912, the composer Maurice Delage, a student of Ravel’s, traveled through India. While there, he wrote “Four Hindu Poems,” which elegantly reflect that country’s music. “Lahore” is based on a text by Heinrich Heine that imagines a snow-covered fir dreaming of a palm tree “grieving” in the heat. After the poem’s last line, the piano falls silent, and the soprano continues wordlessly in a trancelike sequence of arabesque lines, some sung through closed lips. Ms. Devieilhe conjured an array of colors beginning with a nasal sound that turned into a warm hum before opening into cool brilliance. It was a stunning display of vocal control and proof — in the midst of an all-French recital — of Ms. Devieilhe’s polyglot artistry. "

Just want the music? Listen to the Playlist on Spotify here (or find our profile: nytimes). Like what you hear? Let us know attheplaylist@nytimes.com and sign up for our Louder newsletter, a once-a-week blast of our pop music coverage. “Ill Wind” was a postscript to Radiohead’s 2016 album, “A Moon Shaped Pool,” released on a bonus disc but not, until now, to streaming services. Its very few lyrics counsel isolation and detachment for fear of provoking that “ill wind.” They’re set to one of Radiohead’s morose bossa novas, at first akin to “Knives Out”: a nest of minor-key counterpoint on guitar and bass. But then more layers arrive, fluty sounds and buzzy ones, swallowing the song before prettily fading out. What seemed like a sanctuary was a trap. JON PARELES More seemingly left field but in fact totally harmonious cross-genre collaborations in 2019, please. The young country star Kane Brown brings adds an earthy sincerity to Khalid’s soothing delivery of angst on this remix of “Saturday Nights,” and Juice WRLD drizzles his melodically sweet melancholy on Halsey’s impressively stern scold “Without Me.” JON CARAMANICA Adia Victoria, a songwriter from South Carolina who’s now based in Nashville, offers a terse taxonomy of breakups in “Different Kind of Love,” from her second album due next month. “Some of them I knew it best to hesitate/Some I’ve never seen again,” she notes. The setting seems retro at first: a hypnotic rockabilly shuffle with a hefty backbeat and plenty of reverb on the guitar, soon to be punched up by a saxophone section. But it’s not back-to-basics: extra guitars and other, more elusive sounds thicken the mix, as Victoria gets around to a classic, nonnegotiable demand: “Tell me, who do you love?” PARELES The pop-punk trio Pottymouth, three women who have been working together since their teens, confronts aging with a galloping punk-rock beat in — really, this is not a high number — “22.” Abby Weems sings, “Oh, 22 — I still do what I used to do.” And why not? Their speed and passion haven’t faded. PARELES Two Washington, D.C. trios that aren’t afraid to think and rock at the same time are returning this spring: Ex Hex’s “It’s Real” is due March 22 and Priests’ “The Seduction of Kansas” will be released on April 5. Priests’ title track is like a semiotics class set to an arty dance beat: the singer Katie Alice Greer flings around signifiers of American culture — Superman, Dorothy, Applebee’s — before repeating a vow that teeters between genuine and controlling: “It’s true, I’m the one that loves you.” Ex Hex, led by Helium and Wild Flag’s Mary Timony, start off with a surfy bop that glances back to the Ramones’ interpretation of girl-group pop. Their lips aren’t sealed. CARYN GANZ A stark stunner from Lana Del Rey, narrating as someone who’s “24/7 Sylvia Plath/Writing in blood on your walls/‘Cause the ink in my pen don’t look good in my pad.” The arrangement is minimal piano, haunting as an empty, dark cave. And Del Rey spins into deliciously morbid, almost absurdist lyrics: “Hello, it’s the most famous woman you know on the iPad/Calling from beyond the grave, I just wanna say, ‘Hi, Dad.’” CARAMANICA A random rebound hookup: That’s the premise of “Dancing with a Stranger.” It isn’t much of a duet; it’s more like a pair of solos telling parallel stories. “Look what you made me do/I’m with somebody new,” Sam Smith and Normani sing together, while they head off to separate trysts. PARELES The Weeknd is back to his louche ways on “Lost in the Fire,” the second single from “Hyperion,” the forthcoming album by the gloomy French electro-house producer Gesaffelstein. The mood is overcast 1980s Miami, and the singing blends empathy with eroticism. No one is better than the Weeknd at underscoring the trauma common to both. CARAMANICA The Texas bluesman Gary Clark Jr. announces that he’s “paranoid and pissed-off” as he charges into the title song of his coming album, “This Land,” declaring that he’s bought himself 50 acres “right in the middle of Trump country” and is braced for racist neighbors: “I see you looking out your window/Can’t wait to call the police on me.” All the tones are confrontational and raw: a distorted bass line, Clark’s not-always-in-tune lead guitar, his gruff voice, an underlying blues-meets-reggae riff. The video imagery invokes slavery, lynchings, Confederate flags and cross-burning bonfires. “I’m America’s son,” he taunts. “This is where I come from.” PARELES Here is the #MeToo movement in action, simultaneously methodical and melodic. The midtempo folk-rock behind Stella Donnelly’s voice doesn’t telegraph her fury, but she’s reading a self-defense manual and preparing to execute painful moves against someone — married, prosperous, powerful — who is acting inappropriately. “Are you scared of me old man,” she sings, “or are you scared of what I’ll do?” PARELES Kassa Overall’s new album — the irreverently titled “Go Get Ice Cream and Listen to Jazz” — attests to the diverse musical identity of this drummer, producer and rapper. It’s one of the few genuine-sounding, full-scope amalgams of contemporary hip-hop and jazz to surface in recent years. On “Who’s on the Playlist,” as the pianist Sullivan Fortner traces the chords to Miles Davis and Bill Evans’s “Blue in Green,” Overall, 36, daubs his snare drum with brushes, then adds a splatter of electronic percussion. He starts the track with a mumbly, ironic Master P quote before cracking a window into his heart on a verse that grows tensile and urgent before stopping up short. Judi Jackson, a young British jazz singer, shows that the interdisciplinary spirit is contagious — or at least, generational: She sings in an Erykah Badu purr for most of the song, then rattles off a cold rap verse. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO “Human,” an electronic instrumental by the Swedish composer Tomas Nordmark, has a meditative, nearly ambient foundation: sustained, consonant tones like distant horns. But the foreground is jittery, full of unpredictable, glassy tones that briefly hover, then disappear. Mood: inscrutable. PARELES "
5c2dab2f3a125f5075c02a1b,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/03/world/australia/twisted-sister-clive-palmer.html,"SYDNEY, Australia — It’s the same thrashing guitar and rock music, but the words are different from the lyrics of Twisted Sister’s hit song, and the band is not impressed. The rock band from New Jersey has told an Australian politician to stop using its song “We’re Not Gonna Take It” in his advertising campaign. Clive Palmer, a conservative politician and mining magnate, rolled out a national marketing campaign for his center-right United Australia Party over the holiday period. Ads from the campaign use the music from “We’re Not Gonna Take It,” changing the words to “Australia ain’t gonna cop it.” The ads criticize spending and delays related to the National Broadband Network, an infrastructure project intended to improve the country’s internet speeds. Dee Snider, the lead singer of Twisted Sister, responded on Twitter this week to questions from users who were incensed by the ad’s “butchering” of the song. He said the band was considering legal action. One of the band’s guitarists, Jay Jay French, also said on Twitter that the band had not been informed that its music would be used for political purposes. Mr. Palmer responded by suggesting that the band members were motivated by poor ticket sales. Mr. Snider is scheduled to perform in Sydney and Melbourne this month. “Old rocker who can not sell enough tickets to their last gig need publicity,” Mr. Palmer wrote in a text message to Australia’s ABC News on Wednesday. He, too, threatened to sue. “I wrote the words personally that appear on our promotion and hold the copyright for those words,” The Sydney Morning Herald quoted Mr. Palmer as saying. If members of the band “attempt to use my lyrics in any of their songs, I’ll not hesitate to take legal proceedings against them,” he said. “As foreigners, they should stay out of Australian domestic politics and stay where they are. Aussies are not going to cop it at all!” This is not the first time Twisted Sister has clashed with politicians about the song, which, when it was released in 1984, struck a chord with its themes of rebellion and freedom of choice. Paul D. Ryan, the outgoing speaker of the United States House of Representatives, used it during his vice-presidential run with former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts in 2012. Mr. Snider’s statement at the time denouncing Mr. Ryan’s use of the song included the comment: “There is almost nothing on which I agree with Paul Ryan, except perhaps the use of the P90X,” referring to Mr. Ryan’s workout program. Mr. Snider did, however, allow Donald Trump to use the song in his presidential campaign. Mr. Snider told Newsweek that Mr. Trump was a friend and had asked him for permission, which he gave because Mr. Trump’s “rebelling” was in the song’s spirit. (Mr. Snider has since said that he was “not a fan of Trump’s style,” though he said the president was “not being given a chance.”) Mr. Snider harkened back to the rebellion theme in further Twitter posts regarding Mr. Palmer’s advertisement. “‘We’re Not Gonna Take It’ is a song about EVERYONE’S right to free choice,” he said. Mr. Palmer and his party “are NOT pro choice,” Mr. Snider wrote. “So THIS AIN’T HIS SONG!” "

You get an offer to run one of the most vibrant performing arts organizations on the West Coast. Jeremy Geffen, who has been an important tastemaker in New York during his dozen years on the artistic planning team at Carnegie Hall, is leaving to become the executive and artistic director of Cal Performances, the arts producer and presenter at the University of California, Berkeley. “What appeals to me about Cal Performances is that it’s the intersection of many strands of music, dance and drama, with the intellectual curiosity of one of the world’s top university environments,” Mr. Geffen, 44, said in a telephone interview about his new post, which was announced on Tuesday afternoon. He will start in Berkeley on April 1. The West Coast is increasingly the center of American musical experimentation, with the Los Angeles Philharmonic the most adventurous symphonic ensemble in the country and the San Francisco Symphony having recently named the composer and conductor Esa-Pekka Salonen its next music director. Cal Performances has long been an important music presenter; this season’s lineup includes the cellist Yo-Yo Ma; Daniel Barenboim conducting the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra; and the mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato. But it also features dance companies, including the Mark Morris Dance Group and Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater; theater troupes from around the world; and the creation of new work. One of its most ambitious offerings this season will be “Dreamers,” an oratorio it commissioned about the lives of young, undocumented immigrants by the composer Jimmy López and the playwright Nilo Cruz. Mr. Salonen will conduct the Philharmonia Orchestra and the soprano Ana María Martínez in the premiere on March 17. [Read about how the election of Donald Trump changed the tone of the piece.] Mr. Geffen has taken a leading role in Carnegie’s artistic planning, including its annual citywide festivals in recent years, and its fostering of new work, including its 125 Commissions Project in celebration of the hall’s 125th anniversary. He said that he looked forward to collaborations at Cal Performances that would tap the expertise and energy of the Berkeley campus. “If there is any type of experience that has been meaningful to me, it’s identifying either uncelebrated or unknown talents — whether that’s compositional or performing — and giving them a platform,” he said. “Because almost every time, they have knocked the ball out of the park.” Clive Gillinson, Carnegie Hall’s executive and artistic director, said Mr. Geffen would be missed for his deep knowledge and prodigious memory. “There comes a time in everybody’s life when they want more responsibilities, broader responsibilities, and to run an institution themselves,” he said in a telephone interview. In Berkeley, Mr. Geffen succeeds Matías Tarnopolsky, who left last summer to lead the Philadelphia Orchestra. It will be a return to the West Coast for Mr. Geffen, who was born in South Africa and raised in Orange County, Calif., where he first developed his interest in music. “I would not have been in music at all had not been for being in the public school system, and we had an instrumental music program at my junior high school and high school and that’s where I got my training,” he said, adding, “I want to share those experiences, I want to share those opportunities.” "

SUSANA BACA at Sony Hall (Feb. 12, 8 p.m.). This 74-year-old Peruvian singer-songwriter started her career as an ethnomusicologist, specifically focusing on Afro-Peruvian culture. But when David Byrne featured her recording “Maria Lando” on his 1995 compilation “Soul of Black Peru,” she was thrust upon the international stage. Since, she has recorded six albums for his Luaka Bop label and won two Latin Grammys. Baca’s repertoire includes both traditional Peruvian songs and her own originals, but the sound is consistent thanks to her ensemble’s elegant acoustic instrumentation and her superlative, powerful voice. 212-997-5123, sonyhall.com ANITA BAKER at Radio City Music Hall (Feb. 13-14, 8 p.m.). At 61, this R&B legend concluded what was billed as her farewell tour in 2018 with a star-studded finale in September that included appearances by Stevie Wonder, Lalah Hathaway and Kelly Rowland. Thankfully for fans, she’s back with this two-night run at Radio City. The “Giving You the Best That I Got” singer’s roster of hits may have helped define the quiet storm era, which started in the 1970s, but at recent live shows, she has sounded as vital and captivating as ever. 212-465-6000, radiocity.com TALIB KWELI at the BRIC House Ballroom (Feb. 14, 8 p.m.). A Brooklyn native, this rapper gives an interesting spin to Valentine’s Day concerts: His is a love letter to his home borough. Brooklyn — specifically Park Slope, where Kweli grew up, and Fort Greene, where this concert will take place — has changed dramatically since he first rose to prominence in the late 1990s as half of Black Star, which he formed with the M.C. Yasiin Bey (then known as Mos Def), a fellow Brooklynite. Kweli’s message, though, has remained the same: He’s still using his technical mastery to push for social and political reform in Brooklyn and beyond. 718-683-5600, bricartsmedia.org [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] LIFE AND DEATH X SÓNAR at the Avant Gardner (Feb. 8, 10 p.m.). The influential electronic music label Life and Death is partnering with the Spanish festival Sónar to curate a night of D.J.s from around the world at this multiroom Brooklyn club. The lineup includes Life and Death’s co-founder, D.J. Tennis (a.k.a. Manfredi Romano), who specializes in techno; the Los Angeles-based producer Daedelus, who makes experimental electronic music; the London-based house D.J. Call Super; and the Israeli D.J. Mor Elian, whose recent work skews toward electro and ambient music. 347-987-3146, avant-gardner.com SARAH SHOOK & THE DISARMERS at the Knitting Factory (Feb. 14, 8 p.m.). With a rare combination of deft, classic country sounds and plain-spoken storytelling, Shook bucks both Nashville’s mainstream and the overly self-aware Americana scene. The twist comes from Shook’s unconventionally compelling voice, which is low, steady and a little nasal, recalling Appalachian yodeling but with a grungy edge. Plentiful slide guitar and a reliance on barn-dance-ready shuffle rhythms ground the songs in tradition, and the execution is sharp enough that the band’s old-school approach is convincing, a believable transformation of country’s vintage melancholy. 347-529-6696, knittingfactory.com SHARON VAN ETTEN at the Beacon Theater (Feb. 9, 8 p.m.). Van Etten’s new album, “Remind Me Tomorrow,” is receiving rave reviews, thanks in part to the New Jersey-bred singer-songwriter’s fairly dramatic stylistic shift. On her most recent releases, her confessional, poetic songs are bolstered by a slew of different electronic effects and synths instead of basic rock instrumentation. “I found that I was more drawn to the darkness and the driven synths and the syncopated beats,” she told The New York Times last month. The elaborate production, though, does little to obscure her music’s potent vulnerability.212-465-6000, beacontheatre.comNATALIE WEINER CLAUDIA ACUÑA at the Birdland Theater (through Feb. 9, 7 and 9:45 p.m.). Last week Acuña released “Turning Pages,” her first album in a decade and her first to consist of mostly original tunes. It finds the Chilean-born vocalist luxuriating in the breadth of her powers, whether covering Abbey Lincoln or unveiling her own compositions; she’s equal parts taut rhythm, flowing largess (think Cassandra Wilson in the 1990s) and sky-seeking mountain folk. Acuña performs songs from that album here with her band, featuring Juancho Herrera on guitar, Pablo Vergara on keyboard, Carlos Henderson on bass and Yayo Serka on drums.212-581-3080, birdlandjazz.com ITAMAR BOROCHOV at Nublu 151 (Feb. 13, 9 p.m.). An Israeli-born trumpeter, Borochov plays contemporary jazz that’s easy to enjoy. His melodies are direct and often plangent, his harmonies and rhythms sturdy and repetitious. His latest album, “Blue Nights,” draws together influences from the Middle East and North Africa with jazz-academy thinking. He performs here, using his signature quarter-tone trumpet (a custom instrument that allows him to play more fluidly in Middle Eastern modes), with Rob Clearfield on keyboard, Sam Weber on bass and Jay Sawyer on drums. The North African folk band Innov Gnawa, which was featured on one track on “Blue Nights,” will appear as special guests.nublu.net DEE DEE BRIDGEWATER at 92nd Street Y (Feb. 14, 7:30 p.m.). A recently minted National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master, Bridgewater is one of jazz’s most beloved straight-ahead veterans of the 1970s and ’80s, with a style that’s rooted in theater; she carries forth the storytelling legacies of Dinah Washington and Nancy Wilson. Her most recent album, “Memphis,” is a homage to the soul music of the city where she was born, but at this Valentine’s Day concert — joined by her typical backing trio of the pianist Carmen Staaf, the bassist Tabari Lake and the drummer Tyson Jackson — expect a more standard serving of romantic jazz fare.212-415-5500, 92y.org RUDRESH MAHANTHAPPA’S INDO-PAK COALITION at the Miller Theater (Feb. 9, 8 p.m.). Mahanthappa, an alto saxophonist, has been working with his Indo-Pak Coalition for long enough now that the group is starting to subtly outgrow the initial mission statement. They are no longer simply jazz improvisers combining musical traditions from across the Indian subcontinent. The trio — which also includes the guitarist Rez Abbasi and the drummer and tabla player Dan Weiss — has the restless, unboxable rapport of musicians broadly exploring musical sounds and strategies, with Indian classical as its launchpad.212-854-7799, millertheatre.com THUNDERCAT at the Blue Note (Feb. 12-14, 8 and 10:30 p.m.; through Feb. 17). Thundercat, a six-string-electric-bass wunderkind and merry prankster, might be the most hopelessly enjoyable artist currently making music in jazz’s crossover territory. He will do a six-night run in the coming week, welcoming a range of unannounced special guests throughout. Expect wry, hilarious non sequiturs muttered in between songs — like “Them Changes” and “Show You the Way” — that will be full of elastic funk grooves and blistering bass solos. Thundercat, whose birth name is Stephen Bruner, has been improving his vocal chops recently; his singing still has an unpretentious, conversational allure, but now there’s more body and breath behind it.212-475-8592, bluenote.net WING WALKER ORCHESTRA AND BRIAN KROCK’S LIDDLE at Threes Brewing Gowanus (Feb. 12, 8 p.m.). Led by the young multi-reedist Drew Williams, the Wing Walker Orchestra is about to release a remarkable debut album, “Hazel.” The music stays tightly woven, even as Williams switches up the grooves and harmonic palettes constantly; there’s almost always a sharp, biting cadence coming from some part of the band (though not necessarily the rhythm section). The group shares this bill with Liddle, a combo fronted by the alto saxophonist Brian Krock, playing music that draws in equal measure from Charlie Parker, Anthony Braxton and Battles — putting checkered rock rhythms underneath pelting, hard-edge melodies. 718-522-2110, threesbrewing.comGIOVANNI RUSSONELLO "
5c4a0b3f3a125f5075c06264,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/24/obituaries/rita-vidaurri-dies.html,"Rita Vidaurri, who became famous across Latin America as a ranchera singer in the 1940s and ’50s and stopped performing at the height of her renown, only to rekindle her career when she was nearing 80, died on Jan. 16 in San Antonio. She was 94. Her death, at a care facility, was confirmed by her daughter, Linda Alvarado. Ms. Vidaurri, who was nicknamed La Calandria, or the Lark, belted out songs with a powerful voice, often making risqué wisecracks during her performances. Based in San Antonio, she sang in Mexico, Cuba and other parts of Latin America, performing with artists like Nat King Cole, Eydie Gorme & Los Panchos and Celia Cruz. By the 1950s she was mentioned alongside such famous Tejana entertainers as Eva Garza and Lydia Mendoza. Ranchera, traditional Mexican country music, often features wistful love ballads or boisterous paeans to places in Mexico and Texas. Ms. Vidaurri retired from the stage in the late 1950s at the insistence of her husband and former booking agent, Hillman Edward Eden. (They later divorced.) She performed rarely until 2001, when Graciela Sánchez, director of the Esperanza Peace and Justice Center in San Antonio, invited her to sing at an 85th birthday celebration for Ms. Mendoza. “The people started screaming and hollering,” Ms. Vidaurri told an interviewer for the PBS program “Conversations” in 2011, “and a lot of the ladies came and said: ‘We haven’t heard from you! We thought you were dead or you were still living in Mexico City’ ” — because nobody knew anything about me. So Gracielita told me, ‘Do you think you want to sing again?’ And I said, ‘I guess so, I don’t have Mr. Eden to stop me anymore.’ ” Ms. Vidaurri began performing regularly (in 2007 she sang at Ms. Mendoza’s funeral), and in time connected with three other ranchera singers who had grown up in San Antonio and were famous from the 1940s to the ′60s. She and the three women — Beatriz Llamas, Blanca Rodríguez and Janet Cortez — performed together as Las Tesoros de San Antonio, or the Treasures of San Antonio. (They continued to perform after Ms. Cortez died in 2014.) A documentary film about the group and their lives, “Las Tesoros de San Antonio: A Westside Story,” was released in 2016. Ms. Vidaurri was born in San Antonio on May 22, 1924, to Juan and Maria (Castillo) Vidaurri. Her father was a mechanic who owned a garage, and her mother was a housekeeper. Her mother, who had encouraged her singing, died when Ms. Vidaurri was a teenager, leaving her to care for her siblings. Ms. Vidaurri worked, attended night school and kept singing, and soon developed an audience. She performed on Mexican radio, won local singing contests and became an advertising model for Jax Beer. She went on to perform on stage with Mexican stars like Tín Tan, Jorge Negrete and Cantínflas. A second marriage also ended in divorce. In addition to her daughter, Ms. Vidaurri, who lived in San Antonio, is survived by a sister, Henrietta Rodriguez; four stepsisters, Sofia, Rita, Yvan and Ellena Vidaurri; and a stepbrother, Ruben Vidaurri. She had three sons, all of whom died before she did. Ms. Vidaurri continued to sing until nearly the end of her life. Her final public performance was at the Esperanza center last November. "
5c72bb7e3a125f5075c0b46e,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/24/arts/music/peter-frampton-tour-illness.html,"The rock guitarist Peter Frampton said on Saturday that he was planning to issue a double album this summer, his first release in three years. He hinted at another mysterious project in the works. And he said he was going to go on tour for about 50 dates across the country. Yet Saturday’s most significant news was what Frampton, the British star best known for “Frampton Comes Alive!,” one of history’s best-selling live rock albums, revealed as the sobering motivation for his musical frenzy. In two interviews released on Saturday, one with CBS News and one with Rolling Stone, Frampton, 68, said he had a degenerative muscle disease called inclusion body myositis, also known as I.B.M. The disease causes muscles to weaken over time but generally does not affect life expectancy. His condition will not affect his singing voice, Frampton said, but it could slow his fingers and his ability to move around. “In a year’s time, I might not be able to play,” Frampton told Rolling Stone, adding, “I want to record as much as I can in the shortest space of time.” A publicist for Frampton said he could not be reached Saturday evening. Frampton became the lead singer and guitarist for the Herd at 16, and two years later co-founded Humble Pie. His popularity in the United States skyrocketed after the 1976 release of “Frampton Comes Alive!,” a double album that has sold more than 17 million copies. It features songs like “Baby, I Love Your Way” and “Show Me the Way.” Frampton did not always receive the critics’ praise, but he has played on albums by George Harrison and David Bowie, and in the 1970s he helped popularize the talk box, a device that creates the effect of a “talking” musical instrument. The Musicians Hall of Fame, which inducted Frampton in 2014, has called him “one of the most celebrated artists and guitarists in rock history.” Frampton recounted to Rolling Stone a series of warning signs regarding his health: He noticed tightness in his ankles about eight years ago, and there were times his legs felt weak; four years ago, he fell while trying to kick a beach ball off a concert stage; shortly after, he tripped over a guitar cord onstage; and he could not easily put things in overhead compartments on airplanes. Frampton told Rolling Stone that for four years, his children and his band knew about his diagnosis, but that he did not tell anybody else. He said that there was no traditional medicine to treat inclusion body myositis, but that he was exercising every day and hoped to participate in future drug trials. He said he thought the time was right to reveal his condition to the public because his talents may soon ebb, hence the new album and the announcement of the tour, which he is calling the “Peter Frampton Finale — The Farewell Tour.” He said that he may tour in Europe in the spring of 2020, but that this summer’s tour will most likely be his last. Frampton declined to elaborate much on his double album, and said he probably would not play “Frampton Comes Alive!” straight through on the coming tour. Frampton told Rolling Stone that $1 from every ticket sale on the coming tour would go toward a fund he had started with Johns Hopkins University to research myositis. “Maybe a huge door is closing in my life, but then there’s lots of other doors that open,” he said. He told CBS that the condition had already affected his fingers but that he could still play guitar well. “If I’m going to do a farewell tour, I want to play good,” Frampton said. “I want to rock it. I know that this tour, I will be able to do everything I did last year and the year before. That’s the most important thing to me. I want to go out screaming as opposed to, ‘He can’t play anymore.’” "

BROTHERS OSBORNE at Terminal 5 (Jan. 23, 8 p.m.). For those who appreciate their country music with a healthy dose of roadhouse-ready rock, this Maryland-based duo have released a series of up-tempo, guitar-heavy singles that have earned them both critical acclaim (including five Grammy nods) and a considerable following. Their rough-around-the-edges sound — relative to the slick Nashville aesthetic that’s currently in vogue — has endeared them to those country fans alienated by the genre’s radio-driven conformity. The show is sold out, but tickets are available through the resale market. 212-582-6600, terminal5nyc.com CAM’RON at S.O.B.’s (Jan. 19, 8 p.m.). This Harlem-based M.C. will bring his collection of irresistible, party-starting tracks to this intimate club in SoHo. As a member of the Diplomats, best known for their earthshaking self-titled anthem, Cam’ron helped shape the sound of uptown rap in the late 1990s. Soon after, his solo efforts translated into two massive crossover hits: the indelible “Oh Boy” and “Hey Ma.” Since then, he has remained beloved among rap aficionados for his bombastic, club-ready tracks, but he has enough memorable songs and collaborations to appeal to those newer to the genre. 212-243-4940, sobs.com ANTHONY HAMILTON at Kings Theater (Jan. 19, 8 p.m.). This R&B singer retains the aura of a different time — his rich, smooth voice and defiantly traditional instrumentation have long set him apart from many peers in the genre. His breakthrough in the early 2000s, for example, was fueled by an appearance on the bluesy, rustic Nappy Roots hit “Po’ Folks.” He has continued to draw on everything from classic gospel, with his 2016 single “Amen,” to barbershop harmonies, releasing a series of viral covers of rap hits with his quartet, the Hamiltones. 718-856-5464, kingstheatre.com KING PRINCESS at Warsaw (Jan. 23, 7 p.m.) and Irving Plaza (Jan. 24, 7 p.m.). “I hate it when dudes try to chase me,” sings Mikaela Straus at the opening of her hit single “1950,” which she released under her stage name, King Princess — and somehow that’s not even the song’s most memorable line. Catchy, romantic pop confections are quickly becoming the 20-year-old singer-songwriter’s specialty, despite the fact that she has yet to put out a full-length album. What she has created so far, though, stretches the boundaries of pop norms with titles like “Pussy Is God” and stories about women falling in and out of love with one another. Both shows are sold out, but tickets are available through resellers. 212-777-6800, mercuryeastpresents.com LARAAJI at the Park Church Co-op (Jan. 24, 7 p.m.). Though this septuagenarian’s big break came with the release of his Brian Eno-produced album “Ambient 3: Day of Radiance” in 1980, in recent years he’s garnered a number of new fans thanks in part to a series of reissues from the trendy electronic label Leaving Records. Laraaji makes serene New Age music on an array of instruments including the zither, the hammered dulcimer and the piano. This meditative set will, fittingly, take place in a Brooklyn church. Rachika S, a local ambient electronic composer, opens. eventbrite.com  THIS IS HIP HOP at the Apollo Theater (Jan. 18, 8 p.m.). Hip-hop, with its generally spare instrumentation, has long been a good fit for festival-style concerts that squeeze in a number of acts. The legendary lyricist Rakim and a slew of local rap groups active from the 1980s to the early 2000s — the Lox, E.P.M.D., Black Moon and Brand Nubian — will be sharing the turntables and microphones at this old-school affair. For New York rap fans, it’s a head-nodding trip down memory lane; for those new to the genre, it’s a vital history lesson. 212-531-5305, apollotheater.orgNATALIE WEINER AARON BURNETT AND THE BIG MACHINE at the Cell (Jan. 19, 9 p.m.). Boisterous and urgent, the tenor saxophonist Burnett sounds like he could be living on the jazz avant-garde of the 1970s, or surviving a cyborg apocalypse three decades in the future. His new album with the Big Machine is “Anomaly,” full of original compositions with a weird, seductive darkness — from ballads to scorching, unsettled postbop. Burnett celebrates the disc’s release with an iteration of the Big Machine that includes Joel Ross on vibraphone, Carlos Homs on piano, Nick Jozwiak on bass and Dan Nadeau on drums. 646-861-2253, thecelltheatre.org GEORGE COLEMAN QUINTET at Jazz Standard (though Jan. 20, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). Particularly well known for his stint in Miles Davis’s band during the 1960s, this tenor saxophonist uses a lissome, slippery tone to craft melodies of scattered beauty. Now 83, Coleman appears this weekend in a band of straight-ahead jazz stalwarts: Harold Mabern on piano, Yotam Silberstein on guitar, Gerald Cannon on bass and George Coleman Jr. on drums. 212-576-2232, jazzstandard.com KEYON HARROLD at the Blue Note (Jan. 21-23, 8 and 10:30 p.m.). Harrold is technically gifted enough to have recorded the Miles Davis trumpet parts heard on the soundtrack to the 2016 film “Miles Ahead.” He’s also a ruggedly modern thinker, whose own most recent album draws inspiration from radio hip-hop, classic quiet storm, cinematic scores and contemporary jazz. He has long performed in the backing bands for figures like Maxwell, Jay-Z and Rihanna, but these days he is focusing more squarely on his own bandleading career. A native of Ferguson, Mo., Harrold here will perform a program titled “Jazz for Reflection, Protest, Justice and Unity.” 212-475-8592, bluenote.net  INGRID JENSEN QUINTET at the Birdland Theater (Jan. 23-26, 7 and 9:45 p.m.). A trumpeter who’s as versatile as she is vigorous, Jensen released a standout album last year with the tenor saxophonist Steve Treseler. Titled “Invisible Sounds,” it pays tribute to Kenny Wheeler, an influential trumpeter and composer who died in 2014. Jensen and Treseler reinterpret nine of Wheeler’s compositions, which tend to be lyrical and songlike, whether moving at a quick clip or drifting as slowly as cloud cover. Though Jensen is the nominal bandleader for the gigs on Wednesday and Jan. 24, Treseler will also be there; they’ll be joined by Christine Tobin on vocals, Gary Versace on piano, Martin Wind on bass and Jon Wikan on drums. On Jan. 25 and 26, Jensen will revisit the material from her 2003 disc, “Project O,” with the pianist Gary Versace, the bassist Richie Goods and the drummer Jon Wikan. (The tenor saxophonist Joel Frahm will sit in on Jan. 25 only.)212-581-3080, birdlandjazz.com KASSA OVERALL WITH JASON MORAN at the Jazz Gallery (Jan. 18, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). In December, Overall — a drummer, producer and sometime rapper — launched a monthly residency at the Gallery called “Time Capsule.” He is welcoming a different high-profile pianist each month and will record every performance. The resulting tapes will form a capstone product, a hybrid recording that blends chopped-up elements from different performances. (There’s a visual element, too: Overall is collaborating with the artist Nate Lewis, who will create a work to accompany the record.) For this month’s show, Overall welcomes the eminent pianist Jason Moran. 646-494-3625, jazzgallery.nyc MATANA ROBERTS, HALEY FOHR AND SUZANNE LANGILLE at Issue Project Room (Jan. 19, 7 p.m.). In the first show of Issue’s 2019 season, Roberts, an alto saxophonist and multimedia artist, will perform a new work from her continuing series “I Call America,” using video, text and improvised music to address the intersection of societal concerns and personal frustrations. In a separate set, Haley Fohr — best known for her experimental folk outfit Circuit des Yeux — will perform a solo vocal work titled “Wordless Music.” And Suzanne Langille, another singer, will lead a quartet in an exploration of the overlap between vocal and instrumental expression. 718-330-0313, issueprojectroom.orgGIOVANNI RUSSONELLO For an overview of January and February’s cultural events, click here.

5c69bde43a125f5075c0a2cc,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/17/arts/music/review-concertgebouw-daniel-harding.html,"One way to test a relationship is to travel together. There’s nothing like a change of environment and the odd sudden surprise for revealing the structural flaws in a partnership, or knitting it closer together. When the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra and the conductor Daniel Harding took the stage at Carnegie Hall on Thursday and Friday the maestro and the musicians, touring together, may been wondering: Is this working for me? The Concertgebouw is one of the great orchestras in the world, and used to being wooed by stars. (As if to make the point, Friday’s program included Strauss’s “Ein Heldenleben,” which the composer dedicated to the players of this Dutch orchestra in 1898.) Since its chief conductor, Daniele Gatti, was fired last summer over allegations of sexual impropriety (he denied the accusations), the orchestra has been searching for a new leader.  When it tapped Mr. Harding, 43, an English conductor now mostly butterflying from one prestigious guest gig to another, to lead its American tour, many wondered if this was a first step toward something more lasting. Last week’s performances showed that while the partnership is still far from symbiotic, it can, at its best, make thrilling music. The jitters were mostly felt during Thursday’s program, which included Schumann’s “Manfred” overture, Mozart’s Symphony No. 40 and Brahms’s Fourth. On Friday things came together gloriously in Beethoven’s “Emperor” Concerto with the pianist Pierre-Laurent Aimard, “Heldenleben,” and a new work by Guillaume Connesson. With its well-worn staples, Thursday’s program looked safe on paper. But the orchestra injected it with a dose of unpredictability by inviting members of the National Youth Orchestra of the United States of America to join its ranks. This is part of an initiative the orchestra has developed at home and in European Union’ countries to give young musicians the experience of playing alongside first-rate professionals. It was a lovely gesture to extend on tour, even if it introduced the occasional unevenness into the Schumann. The shakiness of the Mozart was harder to explain. The pops of dynamic contrast in the first movement came across as shrill rather than exuberant and the long arc of the andante’s melody seemed pieced together out of Lego blocks with the seams all too visible. But Mr. Harding led an exciting reading of Brahms’s Symphony No. 4. The opening movement grows out of small motifs, in a way that can sound labored. Mr. Harding’s opening gesture was so expansive that the first sigh in the strings appeared to complete, or perhaps answer, a thought. This was the opening to a burnished performance built on long narrative arcs and juicy color. Brahms’s music proved a perfect vehicle for this orchestra with its plush strings, warm and rounded brass sound and, especially, its impressive horn section. The concluding passacaglia brilliantly tied together the moments of archaic severity and private expression, with a memorable flute solo of deep, increasingly desperate, sadness. “Eirene” is a 10-minute orchestral meditation on the Greek goddess of peace by Connesson, a stylistically omnivorous composer with a knack for scintillating textures. With its impressionistic opening giving way to sweeping melodies, the work has an appealing throwback glamour with touches of Mahlerian Weltschmerz and just a hint of jazzy swing. It was a peaceful opening to a concert centered around celebrations of the heroic, including — in Strauss’s tone poem — a saber-rattling depiction of battle that the Concertgebouw players delivered with ferocious energy. But Mr. Harding and Mr. Aimard, the splendid soloist in the Beethoven concerto, also showed that a certain amount of restraint can lend deeper dignity to valor. Their tempo in the first movement of the Emperor Concerto was sufficiently held back to lend the music a processional majesty. Dynamics were carefully balanced, with a glassy delicacy to the music-box passages and an almost tropical richness to the jubilant fanfares. There was more dazzle to come in the Strauss, and plenty of moments in which individual players and sections took the spotlight. One of the orchestra’s concertmasters, Liviu Prunaru, showed off a magnificently full-bodied sound in his solos. Mr. Harding conducted elegantly, with intelligence and purpose. Even so, I couldn’t help noticing that the musicians’ eyes were often elsewhere. String players often glance at each other, or keep their eyes focused on the concertmaster’s bow. Part of what makes this orchestra play so well is that its members approach the music like chamber musicians. which means that much of the time they don’t look at the conductor at all. "
5c8fe0ca49f0eacbf105db36,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/18/arts/music/review-dreamers-oratorio-jimmy-lopez-nilo-cruz-berkeley.html,"BERKELEY, Calif. — The history of oratorios is populated with great heroes of religion and myth. Bach, Handel and John Adams have written about Jesus. Stravinsky took inspiration from Sophocles; Honegger, from Joan of Arc. Rarely will you find an oratorio about fast-shifting current events. But in “Dreamers,” an ambitious yet bloated new work that had its premiere here at Zellerbach Hall at the University of California, Berkeley, on Sunday, the composer Jimmy López and the librettist Nilo Cruz tell the stories of undocumented immigrants by elevating their experiences to the mythic realm of oratorios past. That was their solution to the problem of writing about the hundreds of thousands of young immigrants, known as “Dreamers,” protected by the Obama-era program Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. This is an ever-changing subject, caught in legislative and judicial limbo: a policy mandated in one president’s term and threatened in the next. To avoid getting caught in breaking news, Mr. López and Mr. Cruz’s 45-minute work — presented by Cal Performances and featuring the soprano Ana María Martínez and the UC Berkeley Chamber Chorus and Volti with the excellent Philharmonia Orchestra of London under Esa-Pekka Salonen — broadens the scope. The creators attempt to look beyond headlines to timeless themes of migration and optimism, beginning in the distant past and ending far beyond our moment of crisis and uncertainty. And what better place than Berkeley? The Bay Area enclave bills itself as the first so-called sanctuary city in the United States; the university touts the support it provides through its Undocumented Students Program. Including Mr. Salonen was serendipitous, since it was announced last fall that he would be the next music director of the San Francisco Symphony. Mr. López is a local composer with a doctorate from Berkeley, and immigrated to the United States from Peru. Mr. Cruz, a Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright and Mr. López’s collaborator on the 2015 opera “Bel Canto,” arrived in this country as a refugee from Cuba. You can’t help but be impressed by the scale and aspiration of “Dreamers.” Which is why I found myself wincing every time Mr. López’s music undercut its own potential. He is clearly a master of writing for orchestra, of exploiting its individual sections and instruments — even the sum of its parts — for maximal effect. But his artistry doesn’t quite match his skill. The music thrills more than it intrigues; it prefers to make blunt declarations, not thoroughly persuasive arguments. Mr. Cruz’s words, however, are poetic and poignant, reminiscent of Alice Goodman’s librettos for the John Adams operas “Nixon in China” and “The Death of Klinghoffer,” which occupy a dreamy realm between historical fact and ethereal enigma. Although Mr. Cruz took his inspiration from conversations with undocumented students at Berkeley, he describes immigration as if were a story as old as time itself: “It came with the yearn / of a leaf, three clouds, / and a woman who dreamt / she was walking / towards the edge / of the world. / And the right / to migrate / was granted.” If only the score matched this poetry. The text often gets the treatment of an action-movie soundtrack — frenetic and epic, rarely softer than fortissimo, occasionally taking a turn for the obvious and gimmicky. At one point, Ms. Martínez is made to sing the line “Who has stopped them,” then shout angrily at the audience: “FROM BEING CHILDREN?” But Ms. Martínez, who had a star turn in “Madama Butterfly” at the Metropolitan Opera in 2016, often rose above the quality of the music, with a sound that penetrated the orchestra and chorus without losing an ounce of its heart. Mr. Salonen and the Philharmonia musicians, too, lifted the score, bringing to this oratorio the same energy and enthusiasm they had in a virtually flawless performance of Schoenberg and Bruckner the evening before, and in Stravinsky’s “Firebird” on the second half of Sunday’s concert. And they did sometimes have rich material to work with. The opening section comes to life slowly: at first with Ms. Martínez alone, then accompanying her with a cosmic glow as she almost ritualistically describes a time “before the divide of lands.” As she later contemplates the children swept up in the border crisis, the orchestra is tense, dissonant and unsettling. Mr. López is most creative — and restrained — in the fourth section, “A Dreamer Who Studied Linguistics,” which begins with an eerie buzz that grows like a swarm and, as it reaches a chaotic climax, cuts to silence for an aria about what it’s like to live in silence “with the secret / that I am landless.” Although the vocal line here is lyrical and direct, stormy orchestral interludes suggest inner turmoil. These moments, though, are short-lived. That passage about children is made unfortunately comical by Ms. Martínez’s shouting, later echoed by the choir to drive home loaded words like “killed” and “harm.” The mention of silence in “A Dreamer Who Studied Linguistics” is followed by singers whispering the word “silence.” (We got it.) In future performances, such as one planned for the Houston Symphony, some heavy-handedness could stand to be pruned. Even with those trims, it would still be possible to get swept up in the oratorio’s glorious finale, an ultimately hopeful vision of a world where migration continues — again and again, forever, in a time beyond “lies,” “deceit” and “walls.” "
5c66d29a3a125f5075c09ebd,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/15/arts/music/ryan-adams-album.html,"The release of a new album by the singer-songwriter Ryan Adams has been canceled amid a report that the F.B.I. is looking into his communications with an underage fan. Following an article published by The New York Times on Wednesday about Adams’s treatment of women, from a teenage fan to his ex-wife, Mandy Moore, F.B.I. agents in the bureau’s New York office took the first steps to open a criminal investigation. They are responding to an accusation that Adams exchanged sexually explicit images with the teenager, who said her communication with the singer began when she was 14 and ended when she was 16. They never met in person, and through a lawyer, Adams has denied ever engaging in sexual conversations with someone he knew was underage. [Read our report: Ryan Adams dangled success. Women say they paid a price.] Adams, a prolific Grammy-nominated rock and alternative country singer, had previously announced plans to release three albums this year via Blue Note Records and his own Pax-Am label. On Thursday, the first of those new albums, “Big Colors,” which had been scheduled for April 19, was put on hold indefinitely, according to music retailers. Bull Moose, a record store chain in Maine and New Hampshire, posted on Twitter a message it had received from a supplier stating the album “has been canceled effectively immediately.” A representative for the store confirmed it had been alerted by a sales representative for Universal Music Group that the album was canceled. Capitol Music Group, a division of Universal Music, which was scheduled to distribute Adams’s new albums, declined to comment. SRCVinyl, another seller, said it was offering refunds for customers who had already purchased “Big Colors,” and a pre-order page on the Pax-Am website was also removed. Two musical equipment companies that worked with the singer also suspended their relationships with him on Thursday. In a statement, Benson Amps said it was “saddened and surprised by the recent allegations” against Adams and would no longer move forward with the development of a Ryan Adams signature model. JHS Pedals, a guitar effects company, said it would cease all collaboration with Adams and discontinue his signature pedal, adding that it would rebrand its current inventory “with a portion of the sale going towards the fight against sexual abuse and misconduct.” [F.B.I. opens inquiry into Ryan Adams’s explicit communications with underage fan.] Adams was also accused in The Times’s article of a pattern of emotional abuse and manipulation, in which he offered career assistance and credibility to young female musicians, only to sometimes turn harassing and retaliatory. Adams denied the characterizations of his behavior as abusive or manipulative and challenged the accuracy of the reporting, though he apologized on Twitter “to anyone I have ever hurt, however unintentionally.” In January, Adams, who has released 16 studio albums and a much-discussed cover version of Taylor Swift’s “1989,” announced a deluge of new music in a nontraditional way: via political reporters. Using well-known staff members from The Washington Post, CBS, NBC and Politico, Adams spread information about his three new albums, including “Big Colors” and a follow-up titled “Wednesdays.” He had also announced 10 European tour dates beginning March 30 in Dublin. As of Friday, tickets were still available for purchase. “Big Colors” was produced by Don Was, the president of Blue Note Records, and was scheduled to feature John Mayer, Bob Mould and Benmont Tench of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. Guest musicians slated for “Wednesdays,” which was not given a release date, included Emmylou Harris and Jason Isbell, who wrote on Twitter this week that he believed the women speaking out against Adams. Other former collaborators have also come forward. The musician and model Karen Elson, who toured with Adams in 2017, said in a post on Instagram that she “also had a traumatizing experience with Ryan Adams.” But she added, “I’m not quite brave enough yet to speak about my specifics.” Asked about the allegations against Adams, the singer-songwriter Liz Phair, with whom Adams said he was working on a double album in 2017, posted on Twitter: “My experience was nowhere near as personally involving, but yes the record ended and the similarities are upsetting.” "
5c6ad6dd3a125f5075c0a46b,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/18/opinion/the-year-jazz-came-into-its-own.html,"The Armistice to end World War I brought elation and a sense of relief to millions of Americans, but also a jolt of reality. The country had only been in the conflict for 19 months, but it had already adjusted to the rhythms and strictures of a society on a total-war footing. When it ended so abruptly, the result was a sudden permissiveness in the culture, a weakening of social rules and an opening for new ideas, creating a fertile atmosphere for America’s new, unruly musical child: jazz.  What was jazz? It had no real definition; it referred to many things. The year 1919 is usually not considered an important marker on the jazz timeline, but that year subtle yet compelling forces took hold that would turn this invasive novelty into something with far more clarity and promise as an art form. It was the year jazz came into its own. Feb. 17, 1919, was a cold, overcast New York day that threatened snow. Tens of thousands of people had come to the streets of Manhattan for a victory parade. At the corner of Fifth Ave. 60th Street, a crowd packed the sidewalks and clustered onto a grandstand, vying for a glimpse of the returning heroes parading northward.  Along the route marched the 369th Infantry, a highly decorated all-black regiment that had just returned from a year in France. The Germans, whom they flushed from their trenches, called them “blutdürstige schwarze Männer,” or “bloodthirsty black men” — or more respectfully, “Hellfighters.” The French government gave the unit the Croix de Guerre for its bravery. On cue, the cheering crowd fell into an abrupt hush, as line upon line of soldiers appeared, proceeding in immaculate precision. “For a moment there was almost complete silence, as the throngs of men and women gazed upon the dark-skinned warriors who had beaten the best regiments of veterans the enemy could send them,” wrote The New York Tribune.  Nearly all accounts of the parade singled out the 369th’s band, under the direction of Lt. James Reese Europe, an immensely successful and well-known African-American musician. The press consistently referred to them as a “jazz band,” whose “jazz music” had become the sensation of France. Even Gen. Henri Gouraud, a staid and dignified French commander, was enthralled, and made his headquarters wherever the band was stationed. Lieutenant Europe was already known as the “Jazz King.” Such praise marked the first time anything associated with jazz had received such glowing approval. In 1919, jazz, or “jass,” as some still called it, was a peculiar word with musical and sexual connotations. It could be noun, verb or adjective, indicating pep, liveliness and noise. Jazz was the new counterculture dance music replacing ragtime — but more dangerous, disorderly and discordant, consisting of random, wrong-sounding musical obstreperousness and percussive turmoil. The music had been considered a scourge on polite society, particularly by whites, even if many of them had no idea what the word meant. Now, thousands — both white and black — cheered Europe’s “jazz” band. They kept the “jazz music” under wraps at first. Marching along, Europe kept his men reined in, playing dignified military music, matching the solemnity and discipline of the moment. But as they passed 60th Street, where the crowd became more and more densely populated with African-Americans, the band let loose with “That Moaning Trombone” and other syncopated numbers. Verve and enthusiasm stood in bold relief.  James Reese Europe was born in 1881 in Mobile, Ala., and raised in Washington, D.C., where he studied violin, piano and composition. In 1903, he relocated to New York, seeking work as a musical director and composer. There he associated with the black musical cognoscenti of Manhattan, including Bert Williams, J. Rosamond Johnson and Bob Cole. He became New York society’s favorite band leader, charming the likes of the Vanderbilts, and was musical director for Vernon and Irene Castle, a popular pair of white dancers. Along the way he mentored a string of future musical stars, like Noble Sissle and Eubie Blake. Although historians often associate Europe with ragtime and jazz, his focus was on neither. He wanted to create music that he believed reflected the artistic temperament and souls of African-Americans, whatever style it took, and to use it to promote the validity and viability of Negro musicians. In 1910 he formed the Clef Club, a union for New York’s black musicians, along with the enormous Clef Club Symphony Orchestra, which emphasized instruments that he felt were commonly used by black musicians: banjo, mandolin, bandora and harp guitar. In interviews, Europe avoided the word “ragtime,” simply calling it “Negro music.” The orchestra performed lavish concerts — several at Carnegie Hall — featuring works by black composers like Will Marion Cook, William H. Tyers and Europe himself. It played marches, concert pieces, tangos and waltzes, with a sprinkling of ragtime. Europe’s reputation as a purveyor of ragtime and “proto jazz” is based on recordings made in 1913 and 1914. Of these, “Castle House Rag,” a Europe composition, captures our imagination today, offering a rare glimpse into black dance music, partly read and partly played by ear. Exciting and edgy, it has hints of “Shortenin’ Bread” and what might be described as “country ragtime.”  Few who heard Europe’s music were acquainted with the dance music then brewing in New Orleans, which some regarded as “ragtime played by ear.” Because it went largely unrecorded during the 1910s, it would be years before the rest of the country could hear the rhythmic drive and hot quality of its pioneers, like King Oliver, Freddie Keppard and Jelly Roll Morton. One exception was the Original Dixieland Jazz Band, who made a recording in 1917 that was listened to from California to New York. Many musicians tried to copy their seemingly discordant approach, and failed. Most couldn’t hear, beneath that mélange, the band’s harmonic and rhythmic order, spontaneous sounding counterpoint and interlocking parts. Musicians copied the effects — the musical veneer. Capturing musical essence was a far more complex task than aping the obvious. And yet 1919 was the year when that began to change. In March, the Original Dixieland Jazz Band sailed for England, to tour British theaters. While there, they rerecorded a number of their old hits, along with two waltzes, unlikely choices for a New Orleans jazz band. Still, those recordings, “Alice Blue Gown” and “I’m Forever Blowing Bubbles,” have the propulsion and lilt that characterized New Orleans. More and more people, far outside New Orleans, were suddenly hearing, and enjoying, jazz. As they did, New York bands began to get the swing of the music. In March 1919, a group from Coney Island called the Original Memphis Five emerged with a streamlined version of the Original Dixieland Jazz Band’s style. They made hundreds of recordings between 1921 and 1929.  Nineteen-nineteen was also the year that a young cornetist named Louis Armstrong, who had been electrifying patrons of New Orleans saloons and honky-tonks with his distinctive sound, began to set his sights beyond his hometown. Armstrong possessed a rare gift for fusing disparate types of music that moved him — he had command over the passion of blues, excitement of ragtime, and the poignancy of operatic and classical melodies. His was the unnamed music of New Orleans: organic, confident and sincere. Playing on Mississippi riverboats, his horn was heard for the first time outside of New Orleans. Inevitably, young musicians like the trombonist Jack Teagarden and the cornetist Bix Beiderbecke heard Armstrong; within a few years, both of these young men would emerge as jazz originals in their own right. Armstrong had received much of his early experience working in the band led by trombonist Edward Ory, known as Kid. Ory's contribution to early jazz was in creating one of the most fundamental voices of the jazz band: a style known as “tailgate trombone,” which became the model for most that followed. Ory left New Orleans in August 1919 for California. He soon settled in Oakland, leading a fine jazz band at the Creole Café. In the summer of 1922, Ory’s band would become the first black New Orleans jazz band to make recordings. Armstrong’s mentor, Joe Oliver, moved to Chicago in 1917. By 1919 he was one of the busiest musicians in town, giving Chicago a taste of the Crescent City’s hot music. In 1922 he sent for Armstrong to join his Creole Jazz Band as the second cornetist. The 1923 King Oliver recordings would spread New Orleans music — some called it “jazz” — throughout the land.  On the very day of the 369th’s parade, 2,900 miles to the west, a struggling dance orchestra leader named Paul Whiteman was recovering from a nervous breakdown. A violinist formerly with the San Francisco Symphony, Whiteman had become fascinated with the sensuous, unpolished sounds he heard from musicians in Barbary Coast saloons. He attempted to notate this strange music, orchestrate it and normalize it. Hiring the best “jazzers” in town, Whiteman formed a dance band to play at the Fairmont Hotel. Taxed by overworked and worry, he collapsed, and soon left music, and San Francisco, behind. But he didn’t stay gone. Whiteman moved east, in 1920, and drew national attention when he signed a contract with the Victor Talking Machine Company. Striving to “make a lady” of jazz led to his fabulous 1924 concert “An Experiment in Modern Music,” which premiered Gershwin’s “Rhapsody in Blue.” Whiteman became known as the “King of Jazz,” a moniker which — while he never took it literally — served him well. He went on to hire Frank Trumbauer, Beiderbecke and others, a dream team of young jazz musicians. By the mid-1920s, jazz was firmly in place as the reigning American popular music style. All that was in the future as Europe and the 369th wrapped up their parade through Manhattan. Soon afterward they were mustered out of the service. For most, there was no question what they would do next: Reforming the band as civilians, they set out to tour the East Coast and Midwest. According to a review of their show in Philadelphia, The Evening Bulletin wrote: “Many ragtime, jazz time and popular air tunes were played with a swing, a swerve and a tempo that lifted the soul as well as the feet of the listener and carried him away to the Land of Shuffling Feet.” Though they were praised for their jazz, Europe and his band ranged widely. He typically programmed light classical overtures, specialties like “Evolution of Dixie,” some ragtime, and medleys of syncopated hits under the rubric “A Potpourri of Jazz.” A recording of a medley they often played on the road, “Plantation Echoes,” contains not a speck of jazz, or ragtime, by anyone’s definition. But the crowds demanded jazz, and Europe gave it to them — not only on the stage, but in interviews, where he tried to explain this new form. As he told The Newark Evening Ledger, “Lots of people think jazz is easy. It’s as hard as anything. The French bandmasters thought we had trick instruments. They’d ask to examine our instruments and then cry in surprise ‘Meme que les autres’ — ‘The same as the others.’ You see we get those special effects with a roll of the tongue and blowing the instrument about twice as hard as usual.” Europe’s comments reflected commonly held beliefs about jazz: It was about effects, such as distorting the embouchure to produce fluttering effects. Europe was a master tactician, and provided good copy. The band’s recording of “Memphis Blues” illustrates their approach to jazz. The final minute displays many of the effects Europe described: crying clarinets, flutter-tongued cornets, trombone glissandos and a “shave and a haircut” ending. There is one exception: a surprise solo “break” by a trombonist who tosses off an insouciant, swinging phrase. That break, only two measures long, speaks volumes: a rarity on such an early recording, signifying the exciting nature of jazz as it was still maturing. On May 9, 1919, the band arrived in Boston, to perform at Mechanic’s Hall. Europe, suffering from a cold and exhaustion, courageously pushed himself through the concert’s first half. During intermission, an altercation erupted when a disgruntled musician entered Europe’s dressing room and attacked him with a penknife. The injury, which seemed at first superficial, was anything but. Europe died a few hours later.   In a flash, James Reese Europe was gone, the band broke up, and postwar excitement and acceptance for jazz were temporarily forgotten. Nevertheless, Europe’s final testament had a lasting legacy. During that final tour, a wide range of Americans had begun to realize that jazz was something of which they could be proud. Photos from the parade, with jazz-playing musicians surrounded by returning soldiers, made it clear that this was a homegrown, even patriotic, art form. The old notion about “jazzing” suddenly seemed quaint. “Jazz” had become a noun. Europe’s dream, to see African-Americans accepted as serious and respected performers, lived on through his two closest associates, Noble Sissle and Eubie Blake. Their 1921 Broadway hit “Shuffle Along” was in a sense, a tribute to their mentor and friend. Looking at 1919 from both sides of a timeline clarifies how pivotal this year was for jazz. On one side there was the diligent, focused work of James Reese Europe, which brought dignity to both African-American musicians and jazz. On the other, Paul Whiteman continued his work legitimizing jazz in the public’s mind. In the middle were the pioneers of the art: Louis Armstrong, his mentors and disciples. Encompassing a span of a decade in a single year, 1919 was the fulcrum of momentous musical activity when jazz — in many forms and many definitions — was nurtured, whether by Europe, Whiteman or the growing number of jazz musicians who understood it. David Sager is a research assistant in the Recorded Sound Research Center at the Library of Congress and a Grammy-nominated jazz historian and jazz trombonist.

5c3f8d473a125f5075c04c4e,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/16/books/review/birth-of-loud-ian-port.html,"THE BIRTH OF LOUD Leo Fender, Les Paul, and the Guitar-Pioneering Rivalry That Shaped Rock ’n’ Roll By Ian S. Port Illustrated. 340 pp. Scribner. $28. Like a lot of paradigm-shifting inventions, the solid-body electric guitar seems inevitable in hindsight. Someone was bound to realize that a steel string could be hugely amplified by a magnetic pickup and an external speaker, blasting an electronic signal. Someone was bound to come up with a design that felt familiar and comfortable to a working musician. And someone would certainly figure out how to manufacture the instrument as an affordable mass-market commodity. But the actual advent of the solid-body electric guitar, sometime in the 1940s, was a tangled tale of tinkerers, craftsmen, musicians and businessmen who hardly realized what they had unleashed. In “The Birth of Loud,” Ian S. Port, a critic and guitarist who was the music editor for The San Francisco Weekly, has sorted out the facts of the electric guitar’s much-mythologized genesis and cultural conquest. He turns them into a hot-rod joy ride through mid-20th-century American history. With appropriately flashy prose, he dismantles some misconceptions and credits some nearly forgotten but key figures. He also summons, exuberantly and perceptively, the look, sound and sometimes smell of pivotal scenes and songs. Port frames his scrupulously sourced narrative with two thoroughly disparate characters who converged on the same idea and have archetypal guitars bearing their names: Les Paul and Leo Fender. “Their personalities and worlds were as far apart as any in music could be: One’s arena was primarily the stage, the other’s, the workbench,” Port writes. Clarence Leo Fender was a perpetually rumpled, unassuming, self-taught radio repairman, an intuitive engineer and non-musician who decided to build guitars and amplifiers. “His enjoyment of the instrument,” Port writes, “stemmed from the precise pattern of harmonics produced by its strings. Where others heard music, Leo Fender heard physics.” Lester Polsfuss, a.k.a. Les Paul, was a world-class guitarist and self-promoting showman who was also a technological visionary, fascinated by electronics and studio production. “Les Paul wrestled with the knowledge that even being a virtuoso on the guitar would not bring the fame he craved,” Port writes. “Les now began to see his guitar playing as one element in a larger project: a whole new sound that would combine his brilliant musicianship, the pure electric guitar tone he wanted, and radical new recording techniques he envisioned.” The electric guitar was no single individual’s invention. Amplified guitars had appeared in the early 1930s, when companies including Gibson and Rickenbacker put pickups inside acoustic guitars to play them through amplifiers. Yet beyond a certain volume, amplified sound waves bouncing around inside a traditional guitar’s hollow body would create screaming feedback. But that problem had been solved by a different instrument: the Hawaiian or steel guitar, distilled down to just strings, a neck and pickups heard through an amplifier. They were played horizontally, as a lap steel guitar, or built into a tabletop with pitch-shifting pedals as country music’s pedal steel guitar. Concentrating on Fender and Paul, Port mentions but doesn’t explore the groundbreaking solid-body lap steel guitar sold by Rickenbacker in the early 1930s or other short-lived, solid-body six-string guitar progenitors. In the mid-1940s, Fender turned his radio repair shop into the Fender Electric Instrument Company, manufacturing steel guitars and amplifiers. Both he and Paul had been thinking about a solid-body electric guitar. Les Paul built one for himself in 1940 out of a 4-by-4 plank and an existing guitar neck. He called it “the Log,” performed with it (adding the sides of a guitar body) and brought it to the Gibson company in the early 1940s as a potential product. “After Les left,” Port writes, “the managers chortled among themselves about that crazy guitar player who wanted Gibson to build a broomstick with pickups on it.” In 1943 Fender and a collaborator put pickups on a solid oak plank and shaped it like a narrow little guitar. They built only one rough model, but for years they rented it out steadily to local musicians who loved the amplified sound. It was, Port writes, “a misfit stepchild of a guitar that extended creative expression past what any other standard model allowed.” Neither Fender nor Paul got past his prototype until the 1950s. While Fender struggled to keep his existing factory in business, Paul was thriving as a musician, backing Bing Crosby and others. Paul had turned his Hollywood garage into a home studio: a magnet for musicians and a place to experiment with recording technique. At Les Paul’s studio, Fender, Paul, and a designer and meticulous custom-instrument craftsman named Paul Bigsby brainstormed a solid-body guitar, consulting with musicians. One was the country music star Merle Travis, a Bigsby client. Travis dared the designer to build him a thin, solid-body electric, sketching it in detail. Bigsby built it in 1948. Fender studied it, but knew it was too luxurious. He came up with something simpler, eliminating fine woodworking and its sculptural glued-on neck; his neck was bolted on and easily replaceable, for a guitar that could be manufactured, affordable and practical. “This was the leap from classical design to modernism; from the age of walnut to the age of celluloid; from the America of brick-and-iron cities to the America of stucco-and-glass suburbs,” Port writes. Fender unveiled a solid-body six-string in 1950 and was backlogged with orders by 1951. That was the year Paul’s pop career skyrocketed. In a duo with his wife, the singer and guitarist Mary Ford, Paul used his multitrack studio to create giddy, futuristic, chart-topping versions of standards like “How High the Moon.” The venerable Gibson company had quietly been developing its own solid-body guitar, with a more elegant shape, advanced pickups and smoother sound than the twangy Fender Telecaster. Although Paul didn’t design it — a myth Gibson cultivated — he tweaked it slightly and lent his mad-scientist credibility to the Les Paul Model, Gibson’s first solid-body electric guitar. Meanwhile, Fender came up with the Stratocaster, a curvy, seductive shape contoured to a player’s body. The competition was on, joined by other companies. Leo Fender had another far-reaching idea, introduced in 1952: an electric bass guitar that was far more portable, louder and crisper than a classic bass fiddle. And as rock ’n’ roll took over popular music, he met the demand for bigger, louder amps — including one that deafened him in one ear while he was repairing it for the surf-rock guitarist Dick Dale — and for effects, like reverb, that separated the electric guitar even further from its acoustic ancestors. Musicians took it from there. Electric guitars increasingly defined rock ’n’ roll, driving out pianos and horn sections. Guitarists cranked up and dirtied up the clean, warm sounds that Fender and Paul had tried to engineer; Jimi Hendrix embraced feedback with a vengeance. (His 1969 Woodstock Festival rendition of “The Star-Spangled Banner” gets its own, climactic chapter of Port’s book.) The synergy of guitars, amplifiers and effects spawned new idioms, while manufacturers’ profits rose and fell with hit makers’ equipment choices. The latter part of “The Birth of Loud” juxtaposes breakthroughs by musicians — Muddy Waters, Eric Clapton, Hendrix, the electric bass players Carol Kaye and James Jamerson — with the up-and-down individual and corporate fortunes of Fender and Paul. Fender sold his company in the mid-1960s, but kept tinkering with other companies. Paul saw his pop style eclipsed by rock ’n’ roll and his namesake Gibson model discontinued, only to have his guitar resuscitated by British blues-rockers and his playing eventually cherished by jazz fans. In the digital era, guitars no longer rule popular music. Port recognizes that Paul left another, perhaps larger legacy: He was “the first player to claim the studio as an instrument, a move so common today that we often forget to remark on it. Les aimed to control not only the music that went onto the canvas of recorded sound, but everything about the canvas itself: the framing, the immaculateness of the background, the depth and layering of the sounds, and where it hung on the viewer’s wall.” But “The Birth of Loud” rightfully celebrates an earlier time, when wood, steel, copper wire, microphones and loudspeakers could redefine reality. Tracing material choices that echoed through generations, the book captures the quirks of human inventiveness and the power of sound. "
5c6e180e3a125f5075c0ab59,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/20/arts/who-is-jussie-smollett.html,"The “Empire” star Jussie Smollett, who was charged on Wednesday with staging a racist and homophobic attack on himself in Chicago last month, has been under a bright spotlight in recent weeks — but perhaps not for reasons that a career actor and singer would prefer. Mr. Smollett, who is black and openly gay, reported in January that he was the victim of an attack during which masked men poured chemicals on him and put a noose around his neck, prompting an outpouring of support from fans, activists and politicians. In a major twist, Mr. Smollett, who is in his mid-30s, was charged Wednesday with a felony count of disorderly conduct in connection with the episode. Mr. Smollett is best known for his acting role on “Empire,” a hip-hop drama on Fox, in which he plays a son vying for the throne of his father’s music empire. Growing up with five siblings pursuing careers in acting, modeling and music, Mr. Smollett first appeared on the big screen in 1992. He has landed supporting roles in several other films and television shows since, while also beginning a career as an R&B singer. [Here’s a timeline of what has transpired since Mr. Smollett reported the attack.] “Empire,” which finished its fifth season last year, follows a former drug dealer turned hip-hop mogul, Lucious Lyon, whose three sons must compete to run his multimillion-dollar company. Mr. Smollett’s character, Jamal Lyon, is a gay singer-songwriter who starts the series estranged from his father because of his sexuality. Mr. Smollett sings in and has written for the soundtrack of the series. As a child, Mr. Smollett landed a role in the family comedy film “The Mighty Ducks,” about a lawyer who must coach a youth hockey team after he was sentenced to community service. Two years later, Mr. Smollett starred with five of his brothers and sisters in an ABC sitcom called “On Our Own,” about siblings who are orphaned after their parents die in a car accident. Mr. Smollett’s younger sister, Jurnee Smollett-Bell, has grown up to make her mark in the acting world as well. She is one of the leads in “Underground,” a WGN America show about a group of slaves who try to escape from their Georgia plantation. Mr. Smollett is a guest star on the show. In 2017, Mr. Smollett appeared in the science-fiction thriller “Alien: Covenant.” That year, he also played Langston Hughes in the film “Marshall,” a biopic about Thurgood Marshall, the first African-American Supreme Court justice. Mr. Smollett and his siblings have been outspoken politically and devoted to causes like H.I.V./AIDS prevention and racial justice. Mr. Smollett sits on the board of four charity organizations, including the Trayvon Martin Foundation and the Black AIDS Institute, according to his website. Mr. Smollett also has a singing career separate from “Empire.” Last March, he released a 10-song R&B album. Days after he reported the attack, Mr. Smollett performed for a sold-out crowd in West Hollywood, Calif., telling his fans that he would not let his attackers win and that he “had to be here tonight.” Mr. Smollett told the police in January that, while walking in downtown Chicago, he had been confronted by masked white men who directed homophobic and racial slurs at him and announced it was “MAGA country,” a reference to President Trump’s campaign slogan. As Mr. Smollett has faced questions about whether his hate crime report was truthful, he has continued to insist that the incident occurred just as he reported it. In a statement released by Fox on Wednesday, before the Chicago police labeled Mr. Smollett a suspect in the case, the network said his character was not being written out of “Empire” in response to the police’s announcement that the trajectory of the investigation had changed, contrary to reports from multiple news outlets. Fox later declined to comment after Mr. Smollett was charged. On Wednesday night, following his indictment, his lawyers said in a statement, “Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked.” "

AMEN DUNES at Warsaw (Feb. 1, 9 p.m.). To rehash bluesy rock in a way that’s genuinely compelling is a serious challenge, but Damon McMahon, frontman of Amen Dunes, has found his own way down that oft-trodden path. Especially on the band’s latest album, “Freedom,” there’s a refreshing restraint to their work, stripping away most of rock’s maximalism in favor of gentle, reverb-laden riffs that spotlight McMahon’s distinctive, ever-so-slightly wavering voice. The result is pleasant, mild chaos with enough familiar sounds to be an easy listen. The electronic artist Arthur opens. 212-777-6800, mercuryeastpresents.com/warsawconcerts TONI BRAXTON at Kings Theater (Feb. 7, 8 p.m.). This R&B titan takes over the cavernous theater in Flatbush, Brooklyn, for a show that has long been sold out (though tickets are available via resellers). Braxton specializes in dramatic, emotional epics, songs that are practically operatic in scope; her most enduring hit is “Un-Break My Heart,” a sweeping power ballad. Most remarkable, though, is that Braxton’s style has remained constant in spite of shifting R&B trends. Her 2018 album “Sex & Cigarettes,” a collection of cathartic, unrelenting songs about infidelity, earned three Grammy nominations. The trio SWV, responsible for chart toppers such as “Weak” and “Right Here,” will also perform. 718-856-5464, kingstheatre.com ESTELLE at Baby’s All Right (Feb. 6, 8 p.m.). This British singer’s 2008 major-label debut is best known for its smash hit “American Boy,” which features Kanye West as her raffish suitor. The release had another minor hit, though: “Come Over,” a pop-reggae song featuring Sean Paul. Estelle, whose father is from Grenada, revisited reggae and dancehall on her most recent record, 2018’s “Lover’s Rock” — a tribute to the buoyant, romantic British reggae subgenre that goes by the same name. The album, released on the legendary reggae label VP Records, features heavy hitters including Chronixx, Tarrus Riley and Konshens. 718-599-5800, babysallright.com SHAMIR at Brooklyn Bazaar (Feb. 2, 8 p.m.). Pinning a genre to this singer-songwriter from Las Vegas is challenging. His 2015 debut, “Ratchet,” is eclectic synth-pop with 1980s flair; his latest, last year’s “Resolution,” is stripped-down indie rock that includes songs like “I Can’t Breathe,” which focuses on police killings, and “The Things You Loved,” which has a folksy twang. There are constants, though: Shamir’s instantly identifiable voice — high and sweet with an acidic edge — and his songwriting. Even as his sound becomes more rough-hewed, his songs remain taut and compelling.bkbazaar.com TIBET HOUSE US BENEFIT CONCERT at Carnegie Hall (Feb. 7, 7:30 p.m.). For the 32nd year in a row, Tibet House US, an organization devoted to preserving Tibetan culture and protecting its refugees, will host an all-star musical benefit. This year’s edition, curated by Philip Glass, a longtime participant, includes Laurie Anderson, Jon Batiste, Debbie Harry, Jason Isbell, Angelique Kidjo, Nathaniel Rateliff, New Order’s Bernard Sumner and the Tibetan artist Tenzin Choegyal. Stephen Colbert will be on hand for comic relief. And surprise one-off collaborations are likely; last year, Patti Smith and Angel Olsen covered the Velvet Underground’s “I Found a Reason.” 212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org TRIBALISTAS at the Hammerstein Ballroom (Feb. 5, 8 p.m.). The singers Arnaldo Antunes, Marisa Monte and Carlinhos Brown were already stars in Brazil before joining forces to record their 2002 album, “Tribalistas.” A collection of lilting songs in the tradition of what’s known as “musica popular brasileira” — a post-bossa-nova movement dedicated to integrating international sounds into Brazilian music — the album boosted the supergroup to international success, selling over three million copies globally. It took 15 years for the trio to release a follow-up, also simply called “Tribalistas”; now, they’re performing in New York for the first time as a group.800-745-3000, mc34.com [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] YOLA at Rockwood Music Hall, Stage 2 (Feb. 6, 7 p.m.). Country-soul seems overdue for some mainstream attention, thanks to the parallel success of old-school singers like Leon Bridges and Charles Bradley, and outlaw-era-inspired country stars like Chris Stapleton and Miranda Lambert. Yola, whose Southern soul sound belies her upbringing in southwest England, is as good a candidate as any to spark such a renaissance. Her rich alto fits in seamlessly alongside the slide guitars, jangling piano and lush arrangements on her upcoming debut, “Walk Through Fire,” produced by the Black Keys’ Dan Auerbach.212-477-4155, rockwoodmusichall.comNATALIE WEINER J. D. ALLEN QUARTET at Smoke (Feb. 1-2, 7, 9 and 10:30 p.m.). One of today’s premier tenor saxophonists, Allen spent the last decade working with a steady trio, developing a sturdy but flexible sound based around minor melodies and bristling postbop rhythms. But he recently assembled a new trio featuring a couple of younger musicians, the bassist Ian Kenselaar and the drummer Nic Cacioppo. The early returns are good: An appearance at Winter Jazzfest, where the new trio was joined by the tenor saxophone luminary David Murray, showed how ably the young players have adapted to Allen’s personal style. This weekend the group performs with another of Allen’s frequent collaborators: the crisply expressive guitarist Liberty Ellman.212-864-6662, smokejazz.com JIMMY COBB at Jazz Standard (Jan. 31-Feb. 3, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). Cobb, a drummer and National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master, will probably be remembered as the drummer whose crackling ride cymbal adorned Miles Davis’s 1959 classic, “Kind of Blue.” But his career is much bigger than that one date: He accompanied Sarah Vaughan and John Coltrane and Freddie Hubbard, playing on countless record dates and remaining in the top tier of New York jazz for over 60 years. Cobb turned 90 in January, and he celebrates this weekend in a quartet featuring Peter Bernstein on guitar, Tadataka Unno on piano and John Webber on bass.212-576-2232, jazzstandard.com PEDRO GIRAUDO TANGO QUARTET AND SOFIA TOSELLO at Joe’s Pub (Feb. 1, 9:30 p.m.). Giraudo is an Argentine bassist and composer who reinforces his love for tango with a mastery of Western classical and jazz vocabulary. He sometimes performs with a full orchestra, but he’s just as dazzling with his quartet — the group that appears on his 2018 album, “Vigor Tanguero,” which won a Latin Grammy for best tango album. Also on the bill is Sofia Tosello, a vocalist whose last album, “Lluvia Fue” (“Chamber Tango”), presents its own distinctive take on the tango tradition, mixing old songs and new.212-967-7555, publictheater.org MARÍA GRAND QUARTET AND JOEL ROSS GOOD VIBES at Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola (Feb. 5, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). Grand, a tenor saxophonist, and Ross, a vibraphonist, are two of the most-buzzed-about young players on the New York jazz scene — each with their own sleek, sanguine take on mainstream jazz. They’re also frequent collaborators, and at Dizzy’s on Tuesday they will split the bill, with Grand’s quartet (the vocalist Fay Victor, the bassist Kanoa Mendenhall and the drummer Savannah Harris) starting things off, and Ross’s group (Mendenhall on bass, Immanuel Wilkins on alto saxophone, Jeremy Corren on piano and Jeremy Dutton on drums) playing the second set. Tickets for each performance are sold separately.212-258-9595, jazz.org/dizzys HYPNOTIC BRASS ENSEMBLE at the Blue Note (Jan. 31-Feb. 3, 8 and 10:30 p.m.). The brass-band tradition is naturally associated with New Orleans, but Hypnotic proudly espouses its Chicago roots. With less marching-band thunder and more hip-hop swagger than, say, New Orleans’s Dirty Dozen Brass Band, this eight-piece ensemble mixes the influence of hip-hop, soul and gospel into a coolly grooving sound. And Chicago’s deep legacy as a cradle of experimental, Afrocentric jazz is never far away: All but one of Hypnotic’s members is a son of Kelan Philip Cohran, a patriarch of Chicago’s creative black music scene, who died in 2017.212-475-8592, bluenote.net EIVIND OPSVIK OVERSEAS AND SNARK HORSE at Nublu 151 (Feb. 6, 9 p.m.). A Norwegian-born bassist with a big, dark tone and precision chops, Opsvik writes music with an irreverent intensity, adhering to no single style and showing little interest in the mannered formality of so much progressive jazz. Much of his latest album, the fifth installment of his “Overseas” series, boasts the rugged conviction of rock music and the tangled melodic momentum of a fugue. At Nublu 151, he shares the bill with Snark Horse, an all-star group of improvisers playing short, nervous melodies that they repeat and deconstruct. Snark Horse appears here in quartet form with Matt Mitchell on piano, Ava Mendoza on guitar, Matt Nelson on tenor saxophone and Kate Gentile on drums.nublu.netGIOVANNI RUSSONELLO "
5c56ee4a3a125f5075c07c94,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/03/arts/jussie-smollett-concert-attack.html,"WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. — Jussie Smollett, the singer and actor who said he was attacked by two men yelling racial and homophobic slurs, struck a defiant tone at a concert Saturday night, his first public appearance since he reported the assault last week. “I have so many words on my heart that I want to say, but the most important thing I can say is thank you so much, and that I’m O.K.,” Smollett, a star of the Fox television show “Empire,” told the sold-out crowd at the Troubadour nightclub in West Hollywood. Smollett said that although he was not yet fully healed, “I had to be here tonight.” He said he couldn’t let his attackers win, referring to them with an expletive. The crowd, which included the “Empire” co-creator Lee Daniels and Representative Maxine Waters of California, roared in approval, though Smollett quickly followed by saying, “Now let’s have a good time.” He began his set with a cover of Stevie Wonder’s “Love’s in Need of Love Today.” Throughout his hourlong performance, Smollett made clear his desire to move on from the assault. “We’re not going to harp on” what happened, he said. Other than a small mark below his right eye, he showed no signs of injury, confidently commanding the stage along with black-clad dancers and a backing band. Smollett, a vocal critic of President Trump, did not perform his most outwardly political song, “F.U.W.,” which includes lyrics like “Who got the popular vote? Was the whole thing just a joke?” The performer, who is black and publicly came out as gay in 2015, told the Chicago police that he was assaulted early Tuesday by two men who tied a rope around his neck, poured a chemical substance on him and shouted “This is MAGA country,” a reference to Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan. The Chicago police are combing through security camera footage and have identified two “potential persons of interest,” but the lack of progress in the investigation has fueled speculation online that the attack did not happen as Smollett described. The police have said they are treating the report as if it occurred and that Smollett has been cooperative. Smollett addressed that speculation on Friday and again during his performance, as well as perceived inconsistencies regarding the severity of his injuries. “There’s been a lot of stuff that’s been said about me that’s absolutely not true,” Smollett said on Saturday, reading from a crumpled piece of paper. “I was bruised, but my ribs were not cracked, they were not broken. I went to the doctor immediately.” Smollett said he was not hospitalized, and that “Above all, I fought back,” inserting an expletive. That line received the loudest cheers of the night, but the crowd was enthusiastic even before the performance began. The line for entry stretched down the street as fans waited in the rain and activists handed out pamphlets. “I don’t know why they’re here for this show,” Marlo McKinley, who bought tickets last month, said of the activists. “But the fact all this is happening, that he’s still performing, is fantastic.” Tickets for Smollett’s show were still available as of Tuesday afternoon, but they sold out within 48 hours of the assault being reported. Though a Friday meet-and-greet with fans was canceled for “security reasons,” there was no enhanced security presence at the show on Saturday aside from a pair of officers from the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department. Several members of the Troubadour’s security team said the venue had not hired additional security for the event. Some attendees said they had bought tickets in a show of solidarity but left feeling energized by Smollett’s message and music. “I don’t watch ‘Empire,’ I hadn’t listened to his music, but I really wanted to support him,” one of them, Chris Katrandjian, said after the show. “The strength he exhibited was not only admirable, it was inspiring.” Another attendee, Royce Johnson, said he had found Smollett’s show uplifting. “As gay men, there is a proclivity to be victimized in many ways, and it’s part of our active narrative,” he said. “But watching what he did tonight, it left me feeling empowered.” "
5ca0debc49f0eacbf1f7afba,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/31/obituaries/david-white-dead.html,"David White, who formed the doo-wop quartet Danny and the Juniors in the mid-1950s, co-wrote their No. 1 hit “At the Hop” and composed their successful follow-up, “Rock and Roll Is Here to Stay,” died on March 16 in Las Vegas. He was 79. His daughter Wendy Adamczyk said the cause was lung and throat cancer. Like many other teenagers in the early days of rock ’n’ roll, Mr. White and his friends Danny Rapp, Frank Maffei and Joe Terranova (also known as Joe Terry), who called themselves the Juvenaires, harmonized in cars and school bathrooms. Their singing on a street corner in Philadelphia in 1957 attracted the attention of John Madara, then a 19-year-old singer, who heard them through his bedroom window. “The next day I asked some friends, ‘I heard this great group. Do you know who they are?’ And he said, ‘Yeah, that was Danny Rapp and the guys,’ ” Mr. Madara recalled in an interview in 2014 with Tom Meros for his online series “Tom TV.” Aware of Mr. Madara’s interest in the group, Mr. White found his way to Mr. Madara’s apartment, where they struck up a friendship and agreed to work together. Mr. Madara suggested they write a song that would play off teenagers dancing the bop on the television show “American Bandstand” and have an infectious beat like Jerry Lee Lewis’s recent rockabilly hit “Whole Lotta Shakin’ Goin’ On.”  With help from Artie Singer, a vocal coach and producer, they made a demo record, “Do the Bop,” with Mr. Madara singing lead and the Juvenaires singing backup. But when Mr. Singer and Mr. Madara brought the demo to Prep Records, it was rejected. “Artie took it to Dick Clark” — then a powerful Philadelphia disc jockey as well as the host of “American Bandstand” — “who suggested the title change to ‘At the Hop,’ ” Mr. White said in an interview in 2013 with the blog Milwaukee Opportunities. The group recorded a new version — only the lyrics needed to be changed — with Mr. Rapp singing lead. Mr. Clark agreed to play the song and gave it a huge boost in late 1957, when he had the group, now renamed Danny and the Juniors, on “Bandstand.” It leapt to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and stayed there for seven weeks. Hoping to repeat the success of “At the Hop,” Mr. White wrote “Rock and Roll Is Here to Stay” in early 1958 while touring with the group in Davenport, Iowa. It was not the hit “At the Hop” was — it peaked at No. 19 — but it acted as an enthusiastic rebuke to adults’ view of rock as a short-lived fad that tore at teenagers’ moral fiber. “Rock and roll is here to stay,” they sang. “It will never die/It was meant to be that way/Though I don’t know why.” David Ernest White was born on Nov. 26, 1939, in Philadelphia. When he was 3 he joined his parents, Frank and Marcia Tricker, in their acrobatic touring act, Barry and Brenda and Company. David showed an early interest in music; he began playing piano, clarinet and trombone in elementary school and was writing songs at 14. The Juvenaires, which Mr. White formed when he was about 15, sang at local parties and other events. Sometimes they practiced in Mr. White’s 1953 Pontiac so that they would not disturb the neighbors. Danny and the Juniors had a few modest hits after “At the Hop” and “Rock and Roll Is Here to Stay,” but none that kept them atop the charts. Mr. White left the group around 1961 and, in partnership with Mr. Madara, wrote many songs, including the Top 10 hits “The Fly” (1961), for Chubby Checker; “You Don’t Own Me” (1963), for Lesley Gore; and “1-2-3” (1965), for Len Barry. In 1965, Mr. White, Mr. Madara and Ray Gilmore formed a short-lived group, the Spokesmen, and together wrote a single, “The Dawn of Correction,” an optimistic corrective to Barry McGuire’s foreboding No. 1 hit, “Eve of Destruction.” It rose to No. 36 on the Hot 100. Mr. White found less success afterward. He broke up with Mr. Madara, released a solo album under the name David White Tricker, which did not do well; lived for a time in a trailer park; worked on various musical and film projects; and wrote a memoir that has not yet been published. He also collected royalties from filmmakers and advertisers eager to license songs from his archive, especially “At the Hop” and “Rock and Roll Is Here to Stay.” In the late 1960s, Mr. Rapp formed an all-new version of Danny and the Juniors, which toured the country; at one point he asked Mr. White to join him. While they never reunited, Mr. White sang a few songs with Mr. Rapp’s group at a lounge near Lake Tahoe in 1982. “He was real up, he was real excited about seeing me,” Mr. White told The Los Angeles Times in 1988. “I came very close to going back with him because he was working like crazy.” It was the last time they saw each other. Mr. Rapp died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in 1983. Mr. Terry and Mr. Maffei continued to perform occasionally as Danny and the Juniors, along with Mr. Maffei’s brother, Bob. In addition to Ms. Adamczyk, Mr. White is survived by his wife, Sandra (Simone) White; another daughter, Jody Conrad, and three grandchildren. A third daughter, Linda White, died in 2013. "
5c753a1549f0eacbf105a33a,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/26/arts/dance/les-arts-florissants-rameau-maitre-a-danser-bam.html,"“A week ago I was dancing a bourrée,” the conductor William Christie said over the phone from Paris, where his baroque ensemble, Les Arts Florissants, is based. “A group of us sang a little song around the fire, and we all danced.” This impromptu dance erupted at the inauguration of a 17th-century fireplace in a house in the Loire that’s part of a complex where the Fondation Les Arts Florissants now resides. But it could almost describe a moment in the program his ensemble is bringing to the Brooklyn Academy of Music this week under the title “Rameau, Maître à Danser.” These works, too, were written to celebrate happy events — in one case, the birth of a king — and involved singing and dancing, in equal measure. The French court loved to dance, a passion that can be traced to Louis XIV, an avid dancer and a supporter of the creation of the Royal Academy of Dance, where the basic positions and movements of ballet were first codified. “Everyone danced in France,” the Baroque dance specialist Catherine Turocy said in a phone interview from her home in Dallas. “The singers danced, the dancers sang, and everyone played instruments. In that sense it was more like today’s musical theater.” All the 17th- and 18th-century French opera forms included dance, from the solemn tragédie lyrique to the lighter opera-ballets, the loose genre to which the works of “Rameau, Maître à Danser” belong. “Daphnis et Eglé” and “La Naissance d’Osiris” were composed for the court of Louis XV, to be performed at the palace of Fontainebleau, where the royal family (and much of the aristocracy) retired each fall in to enjoy the hunt. The two operas were performed in successive seasons — 1753 and 1754 — and seldom since, which is why Mr. Christie decided to revive them in 2014, on the 250th anniversary of the composer’s death. (The Brooklyn Academy’s production is the show’s American premiere.) Each about 45 minutes long, neither of the two works would have taxed the attention of the aristocratic audience with complicated plots or deep subjects. “The plots are essentially nonexistent,” Mr. Christie said. “It’s just exquisitely beautiful music, tender and melancholy, and fabulous for dancing.” There is just a whisper of a plot or, more accurately, a dramatic situation. In “Daphnis et Églé” (1753), a shepherd and a shepherdess approach the Temple of Friendship, only to be turned away, because, as Cupid points out to them, they are actually in love. In “Osiris,” shepherds and shepherdesses (notice a theme) await the birth of the god Osiris. (The piece, called a “ballet allégorique,” was meant to echo the birth of the future Louis XVI.) “It was my idea to make the two works into one story,” the director, Sophie Daneman explained from London, where she lives. “I thought, gosh, they’re very similar: They’re both incredibly pastoral, and in that sense, very human.” While the musical values of the Arts Florissants ensemble are faithful to what is known of the historical style, the dancing, like the staging, is more fluid. “There are elements and suggestions of period style,” Mr. Christie said, “but this has nothing to do with pure period staging.” Ms. Daneman noted that Mr. Christie “doesn’t have a strong philosophy on whether something should be ‘authentic.’ He’s more interested in authenticity of spirit.” In this spirit, the dances are not meant to replicate Baroque styles, though they do make reference to their vocabulary of small jumps, elegant footwork and decorative wrists. Originally choreographed by Françoise Denieau, who died in 2015, the dances are being restaged for this run by her assistant, Gilles Poirier. “For the most part,” Mr. Poirier said from Paris, Ms. Denieau “wanted to use a slightly later style of dance, closer to Noverre,” the ballet master who taught Marie Antoinette and the 19th-century Danish choreographer August Bournonville. (Bournonville enthusiasts will immediately spot the buoyant style.) She even included a moment that is closer to something like contemporary dance, using expansive and stylized gestures that Noverre could not have imagined. “Françoise wanted that part to be in a style that was more undefined,” Mr. Poirier said, “neither classical nor contemporary” as a way to evoke timelessness. In Ms. Daneman’s reimagined staging, the dancers and singers occupy the same world, taking turns at the center of the action. There are times when the dancers and singers interact, communicating through shared glances or touch. Mr. Christie conducts the ensemble of period instruments from the back of the stage, close to the singers and dancers. At one point, a musician becomes part of the action: A French bagpipe player slowly traverses the stage, surrounded by the entire cast. This leads into the final number, a contredanse, the French version of English country dancing. The dancers and singers form concentric circles, executing simple steps, weaving in and out. As in Mr. Christie’s celebratory bourrée by the fireside, everybody dances. Everybody sings. "
5c5ddea83a125f5075c08c79,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/08/arts/music/classical-week-youtube.html,"[Read all of our classical music coverage here.] Hey there! Javier Camarena sang 18 high C’s at the Metropolitan Opera on Thursday evening. Read all about it, and watch: This week the New York Philharmonic announced its 2019-20 season, and we writers came together to make a list of our highlights. Or pre-highlights, perhaps. There’s some good stuff! And Tony Tommasini, our chief critic, offered some lovely memories of working with the American baritone Sanford Sylvan, who died last week: I reviewed an austere but moving revival of Robert Ashley’s opera “Improvement (Don Leaves Linda),” which I’d highly recommend. (It runs through Feb. 16.) Take a listen to the piece: And I’ll leave you with Scriabin’s Piano Concerto, which Daniil Trifonov will play with the New York Phil next season. Here’s a lucid, feeling recording with Pierre Boulez conducting Anatol Ugorski and the Chicago Symphony. Enjoy! ZACHARY WOOLFE Finally, the overlap in the Venn diagram of Arnold Schoenberg and bluegrass music is getting a bit larger, thanks to “(Gimme Some of That) Ol’ Atonal Music,” by the country prankster Merle Hazard. The whole thing made me smile, but it was his high-pitched, Bob Wills-ian “Aha” during the atonal banjo solo that made me crack up. MICHAEL COOPER Instead of watching the State of the Union address on Tuesday, I heard Messiaen’s “Quartet for the End of Time” in the crypt of a church. As part of the Crypt Sessions series at the Church of the Intercession in Harlem, the piece got a mystical and moving performance from a makeshift group: Yoonah Kim, clarinet; Orion Weiss, piano; Stefan Jackiw, violin; and Jay Campbell, cello. They played with the synchronicity of a seasoned ensemble, nailing exposed and dangerous passages like the octave runs in the “Interlude” and “Tangle of Rainbows.” In the extreme intimacy of the crypt, you could hear the click-clack of the clarinet’s keys, and the airy sounds of bows on strings. Up close, the quartet seemed to deal only in disorienting extremes, like the alternating alarms and chirps, both chilling and playful, in “Abyss of the Birds,” a lengthy solo played with inexhaustible virtuosity by Ms. Kim. And proximity lifted “Praise to the Eternity of Jesus,” a duet for cello and piano (heard here in a luxury-casting album from 2017), to the sublime. JOSHUA BARONE Yuja Wang’s regular partnership with the violinist Leonidas Kavakos isn’t the place to hear the sustained stretches of imaginative power that characterize her solo-piano concerts. On their recording of the Brahms violin sonatas — and at their gripping recital at Carnegie Hall on Wednesday — it’s possible to sense Ms. Wang pulling back on the throttle. Which isn’t a bad thing; it can be a revelation to hear this bold pianist in a collaborative setting. That quality of reserve can also make Ms. Wang’s occasional lurch into more demonstrative playing all the more shocking. On Wednesday, her florid energy found a moment for expression during Brahms’s Violin Sonata No. 2. During the middle movement’s “Vivace di più” section, the rhythmic charge Ms. Wang put into select chords made it feel as though she could vault into Stravinsky’s “Petrouchka” transcription at any second. She didn’t, of course — and Mr. Kavakos’s steely sense of purpose kept the performance from losing its overall form. But it was a reminder of how thoroughly Ms. Wang can transform a familiar work. SETH COLTER WALLS Recently, over five days in New York, three pianists at very different stages of their careers gave remarkable recitals. Leon Fleisher celebrated his 90th birthday with musician friends at Zankel Hall. Jeremy Denk, 48 and in his prime, concluded a varied program (literally: he offered theme and variation pieces by Beethoven, Mendelssohn and John Adams) at Carnegie Hall with a magnificent account of Schumann’s Fantasy in C. And Behzod Abduraimov, 28, appeared at the 92nd Street Y. This fast-rising Uzbek pianist, who combines prodigious technique with a feeling for color and youthful temperament, gave a stunning account of Liszt’s formidable Sonata in B minor.  But his overeagerness came through in 10 Pieces from Prokofiev’s “Romeo and Juliet.” There were captivating moments but also passages of slam-bang steeliness. Perhaps he had trouble adjusting to the Y’s intimacy; he has said that he prefers big spaces. Mr. Abduraimov can certainly play with wondrous fleetness, clarity and imagination, as he did in his encore, Liszt’s “La Campanella.” Just listen to him in this excerpt from a 2015 performance in Munich. ANTHONY TOMMASINI "
5cb4d7b049f0eacbf1f844a1,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/15/business/media/pulitzer-prizes.html,"Pulitzer Prizes were awarded on Monday to news organizations that uncovered instances of malfeasance and outright fraud in President Trump’s financial past, recognizing journalists’ perseverance in the face of the president’s ever-sharper attacks on a free press. The New York Times received the explanatory reporting prize for an 18-month investigation that revealed how the future president and his relatives avoided paying roughly half a billion dollars’ worth of taxes. The Wall Street Journal won the national reporting award for disclosing clandestine payoffs made by the president’s associates before the 2016 election to two women who had alleged affairs with Mr. Trump. Threats to journalists, foreign and domestic, provided a backdrop for this year’s prizes, which also honored reporters forced to cover deadly tragedies in their hometowns and, in one case, their own newsroom. In the cultural realm, the Pulitzers recognized the singer Aretha Franklin for her contributions to American music, the first special citation granted to a woman. The South Florida Sun Sentinel won the prize for public service, considered the most prestigious of the Pulitzers, for documenting the massacre of 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., in February. The paper’s in-depth articles revealed a series of failures by local officials and law enforcement that, the paper wrote, contributed to the loss of life. “Feeling overwhelmed and grateful,” a Sun Sentinel reporter, Scott Travis, wrote on Twitter after learning of the honor. “But also sad that we won the greatest journalism award — the Pulitzer — because of a tragedy that never should have happened.” [Here’s the full list of winners.] The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette won for breaking news coverage of a gunman’s spree at the Tree of Life synagogue in October, where 11 people died. The Pulitzer board also recognized The Capital Gazette of Annapolis, Md., where five employees were killed in a shooting in June, with a special citation that included a $100,000 bequest. Dana Canedy, the awards’ administrator, cited The Capital Gazette’s “unflagging commitment to covering news at a time of unspeakable grief.” In honoring The Sun Sentinel, The Post-Gazette and The Capital Gazette, the Pulitzer board underlined the importance of local journalism at a moment when regional papers are struggling to survive. First given in 1917, the Pulitzer Prizes are presented annually by Columbia University for excellence in journalism and letters. Invoking the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, The Washington Post columnist killed in Turkey by Saudi assassins, Ms. Canedy praised this year’s honorees for a willingness to speak truth to power. “This year’s winning work reflects yet again a steely resolve in upholding the principles of this noble profession,” Ms. Canedy said. The Times’s examination of Mr. Trump’s family finances, by the journalists David Barstow, Susanne Craig and Russ Buettner, drew on tens of thousands of pages of confidential records and previously undisclosed tax returns. The award was the fourth Pulitzer win for Mr. Barstow, a record for a reporter. (The news photographer Carol Guzy, the poet Robert Frost, the playwright Eugene O’Neill and the playwright and biographer Robert Sherwood have also won four prizes.) The Times won in the category of editorial writing, for essays by Brent Staples that grappled with questions of race, slavery, and memory in communities across the country. In accepting his award in The Times newsroom on Monday, Mr. Staples, who joined the paper’s editorial board in 1990, thanked his great-great-grandmother, who was born into slavery, saying, “I was channeling my family story.” The complexities of race and class figured in many of the prizewinning works. The award for drama went to Jackie Sibblies Drury for “Fairview,” a play that challenges viewers to confront their prejudices, and which The Times critic Ben Brantley called “dazzling and ruthless.” “Frederick Douglass: Prophet of Freedom,” an examination of the civil rights pioneer by David W. Blight, won the history prize, and the biography award went to Jeffrey C. Stewart for “The New Negro: The Life of Alain Locke,” a portrait of the Harlem Renaissance patron. Darrin Bell, a freelancer artist, became the first African-American to win for editorial cartooning, for a series published in The Washington Post on the experiences of disenfranchised groups under the Trump administration. It was one of three prizes awarded on Monday to The Post, including feature photography — for Lorenzo Tugnoli’s pictures of a famine in Yemen — and criticism, for essays by the paper’s nonfiction book critic, Carlos Lozada. The ProPublica journalist Hannah Dreier received the feature writing award, for capturing the plight of Salvadoran immigrants caught in a federal crackdown on MS-13 gang members on Long Island; one of her pieces was copublished by The New York Times Magazine. The staff of Reuters won the breaking news photography prize for a visual narrative of migrants traveling toward the United States border. The Los Angeles Times won the investigative reporting prize for revealing accusations of sexual abuse against a gynecologist at the University of Southern California. The reporting, by Matt Hamilton, Harriet Ryan and Paul Pringle, led in part to the resignation of the university’s president. Tony Messenger of The St. Louis Post-Dispatch received the commentary prize for columns about rural Missourians faced with unaffordable fines for minor offenses. The Advocate, of Baton Rouge, La., received the prize for local reporting for a critical examination of Louisiana’s criminal justice system. In the international reporting category, the year’s winners included Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, Reuters journalists imprisoned for more than a year in Myanmar. Their reporting, on human rights violations against Rohingya Muslims in the Southeast Asian nation, shared the prize with coverage by The Associated Press of atrocities in Yemen. The journalist Eliza Griswold won the nonfiction writing prize for “Amity and Prosperity: One Family and the Fracturing of America,” the story of an Appalachian family disrupted by an oil fracking company. The fiction prize went to Richard Powers for “The Overstory,” a narrative that entwines the lives of humans and trees. Ellen Reid won the music prize for her operatic work “p ris m,” and the poetry prize went to Forrest Gander for “Be With,” a collection of meditations on grief and loss. At the start of Monday’s ceremony, Ms. Canedy recognized an entry that had not won: 17 obituaries of slain Parkland students and faculty, written by the staff of the school’s student publication, The Eagle Eye. “These budding journalists remind us of the media’s unwavering commitment to bearing witness,” Ms. Canedy said, adding that the students’ work “should give us all hope for the future of journalism in this great democracy.” "
5c91306649f0eacbf105de6c,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/19/obituaries/jh-kwabena-nketia-dead.html,"J. H. Kwabena Nketia, a Ghanaian ethnomusicologist and composer who became the world’s leading scholar on African musical traditions, died on March 13 in Legon, a suburb of Accra, the capital of Ghana. He was 97. His death, at a hospital, was confirmed by the composer Fred Onovwerosuoke, who studied with Dr. Nketia and became a close friend. In a career stretching back to the 1950s and continuing into his 90s, Dr. Nketia wrote hundreds of articles and books in English and Twi, a Ghanaian language, on topics ranging from music theory to folklore, as well as scores of compositions. He held professorships at the University of California, Los Angeles; the University of Pittsburgh; and the University of Ghana, where he helped shape the curriculum after Ghana broke free from British rule. His 1974 book, “The Music of Africa,” is widely considered a definitive historical study, and “Ethnomusicology and African Music,” a collection of his writings published in 2005, is used in classrooms throughout Africa and across the world. As a composer, Dr. Nketia wrote music for choirs, solo voices and instrumental groups that used both African and Western instruments. His music was particularly informed by the sounds of Ghana, but he integrated influences from across the African continent. In his academic work, too, Dr. Nketia espoused a Pan-African ideology even as he insisted on the multiplicity of sub-Saharan cultures. “The most important characteristic of this family of musical traditions is the diversity of expressions it accommodates, a diversity arising from different applications of common procedures and usages,” he wrote. “The music of Africa, like its language, is, so to speak, ‘ethnic-bound.’ Each society practices its own variant.” Dr. Nketia devised ways of using Western techniques to document and analyze African music while preserving its indigenous characteristics. He revolutionized how the rhythms of sub-Saharan African music are transcribed, employing the 6/8 time signature rather than a simple two-beat measure. And his studies went beyond rhythmic analysis. He made a point of championing the diversity of harmonic languages used throughout Africa as well. “He always wanted to ensure that the West knew about the diversity of our harmonic language,” Dr. Onovwerosuoke said. Robert Farris Thompson, a professor emeritus of art history at Yale University, wrote in an email that Dr. Nketia was “one of the finest scholars in all of post-colonial Africa,” adding, “He showed that the African history of music was a sacred tradition revealed.” Joseph Hanson Kwabena Nketia was born on June 22, 1921, in Asante Mampong, Ghana. In the Akan language, Kwabena is the name for boys born on Tuesday. An only child, he was raised by his mother and maternal grandparents after his father died. He credited his grandparents as his first music teachers. He received training in European music theory as a high school student at the Presbyterian Training College in southeastern Ghana. In 1944, he was one of 20 Ghanaians in the first class awarded Britain’s Commonwealth scholarship, which sent him to England to study linguistics at the School of Oriental and African Studies. He also took classes at the Trinity College of Music and Birkbeck College at the University of London. In 1952, back in Ghana, he accepted a research fellowship in African studies at what is now the University of Ghana and traveled the country recording musical performances and festivals. He began developing interdisciplinary programs at the university that explored the intersections of language, dance, music and folklore. Dr. Nketia traveled to the United States for the first time in 1958, on a Rockefeller Foundation fellowship; over the course of a year he studied at Juilliard, Columbia University and Northwestern University, and developed relationships with such prominent American musicians and folklorists as Charles Seeger and Henry Cowell. Dr. Nketia performed “The Republic Suite,” perhaps his defining musical composition, at Ghana’s Republic Day Concert on July 1, 1960, celebrating the election of his friend Kwame Nkrumah as the nation’s first president. The suite’s formal elements aligned it with Western classical music, but many of its melodies were drawn from traditional songs recognizable to Ghanaian listeners. Dr. Nketia became the deputy director of the University of Ghana’s new Institute of African Studies in 1961. Three years later, having attained tenure as a full professor, he became the first African to serve as the institute’s director. Soon after, he became the founding director of what is now the School of Performing Arts, and he filled its faculty and research positions with prominent Ghanaian artists, including the playwright Efua Sutherland, the author Ama Ata Aidoo and the choreographer Albert Mawere Opoku. In 1992 he founded the International Center for African Music and Dance, an archive based at the university. Dr. Nketia was the recipient of many awards and worked with a number of international cultural organizations, including Unesco’s International Commission for a Scientific and Cultural History of Mankind. Tireless in his scholarship, he delivered lectures at universities on five continents well into his later years and published his last book, “Reinstating Traditional Music in Contemporary Contexts,” in 2016, on the eve of his 95th birthday. He is survived by three daughters, Akosua Adoma Perbi, Priscilla Naana Nketia and Adjoa Nketia; seven grandchildren; and nine great-grandchildren. His wife and their two sons, Kwabena Yeboa Nketia and Eric Kwame Gyimah Nketia, died before him. Dr. Nketia’s grandson Kwame Ametepee Tsikata, a famed Ghanaian rapper known as M.anifest, remembered him as “very generous with all his knowledge and his wisdom.” “He had an incredible intellectual curiosity,” Mr. Tsikata said, “until the end.” "
5c618c753a125f5075c0915e,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/11/arts/music/grammys-moments-best-worst.html,"The 61st annual Grammy Awards on Sunday worked to right the wrongs of the past few years’ ceremonies, where the leading narrative was tension over a lack of diversity and poor representation for the most influential young artists in music. Big stars still stayed home — and one of the biggest got cut off mid-speech — but the show corralled a former first lady and delivered many messages of inspirational uplift. Here are the highlights and lowlights as we saw them: Of all the major-category nominees at this year’s Grammys, none were more surprising than Brandi Carlile, the 37-year-old folk-rock — or rockin’ folk — singer and songwriter who earned six nods, including album of the year. But when she appeared on the Grammys stage, things became clear. Her performance of “The Joke,” a defiant anthem about tolerance, was genuinely startling (and vastly superior to the album version). Carlile’s vocals were robust, ragged, full of sneer and hope. On a night curiously light on impressive singing, it was an uncomplicated, genuine, cleansing thrill. JON CARAMANICA [Hear our pop music team break down the Grammy highs and lows.] Drake, who pointedly did not perform on Sunday night, claimed just his fourth Grammy in 42 tries — best rap song for “God’s Plan” — and he deigned to show up to accept it, taking the winner’s podium for the first time. (His previous awards were not televised, and he’s even clowned the show for giving “Hotline Bling” the best rap song trophy in 2017 “maybe because I’ve rapped in the past or because I’m black,” he said.) This time, he pulled a Fiona Apple and told the world it didn’t matter: “We play in an opinion-based sport, not a factual-based sport,” he said, seemingly legitimately nervous. “This is a business where sometimes it’s up to a bunch of people that might not understand, you know, what a mixed-race kid from Canada has to say, or a fly Spanish girl from New York, or anybody else, or a brother from Houston.” It was part motivational speech, part rebuke of gatekeepers, and all Drake, the most famous guidance counselor in the universe. “The point is, you’ve already won if you have people who are singing your songs word for word, if you’re a hero in your hometown,” he added. “You don’t need this right here, I promise you.” But when he gathered his breath to finish the sentiment, the show cut to commercial. Drake was not seen at the Grammys again, and given how hard it was to get him there in the first place, he might not be for a while. JOE COSCARELLI [Want to be heard during the Grammys? Maybe stay home, our critic writes.] If the tensions at last year’s ceremony left the Grammys in knots, Alicia Keys was a CBD oil rubdown: a soothing, self-assured earth mother prepared to “Kumbaya” the show into a place of solidarity and affection. “Do you feel that love in the building?” she announced at the top of the ceremony. “This is love, this is life, this is living, this is light, and all because of music.” She brought out Lady Gaga, Jada Pinkett Smith, Michelle Obama and Jennifer Lopez to speak about music as a vessel for empowerment and empathy. She twirled in a variety of outfits. She joked around with John Mayer and harmonized with Smokey Robinson. She had already logged oodles more screen time than any host in recent memory when she perched on a stool between two grand pianos and played one with each hand in a demonstration of technical badassery, then took a tour through songs she wished she had written (Roberta Flack’s “Killing Me Softly,” Juice WRLD’s “Lucid Dreams,” Kings of Leon’s “Use Somebody”), wrapping on her own Jay-Z collaboration “Empire State of Mind” like a humblebrag come to life. But she still ended the show on a note of grander uplift: “Let’s keep listening and loving each other.” CARYN GANZ [At a ceremony dominated by female performers and presenters, women took center stage.] Flanked by younger admirers for a patchwork tribute, Dolly Parton easily held her own, with her voice still twangy, feathery and persuasive. The start was shaky: Kacey Musgraves too tentative and Katy Perry too vehement before Parton righted the tone of “Here You Come Again.” Miley Cyrus made an admiring rival in “Jolene,” and Cyrus shared three-part a cappella harmony with Parton and Maren Morris in “After the Gold Rush,” a Neil Young song Parton has recorded with Linda Ronstadt and Emmylou Harris. Little Big Town gave Parton an arena-country buildup in the story-song “Red Shoes,” from the 2018 “Dumplin’” soundtrack, before the female-solidarity finale, “9 to 5,” in which Parton made sure to praise her recent songwriting collaborator and producer, Linda Perry, who was leading the band. Parton was all smiles, and all gumption. JON PARELES For a show that has traditionally shunted aside Latin music (leaving it to the Latin Grammys, a separate event altogether) — and has yet to really acknowledge the rising urbano wave — Camila Cabello’s opening number covered a lot of ground. Sure, it was centered around “Havana,” a No. 1 pop hit, but Cabello’s Cuba-via-Miami roots shone through, and she also managed to ground a performance that featured both Young Thug and Ricky Martin. (Guess which one was wearing diamond-encrusted boots.) J Balvin, the pop-reggaeton star from Colombia, popped up for an interlude of his hit “Mi Gente” — and held up a newspaper that read “Build bridges not walls” — while the Cuban-American jazz trumpeter Arturo Sandoval made himself heard throughout. For a show that’s traditionally a ballad-loving affair, the energy was welcome, as was diversity that didn’t just feel like lip service. COSCARELLI [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] Childish Gambino’s “This Is America,” the first-ever hip-hop song to be honored with a Grammy for song and record of the year, is fittingly self-conscious: rapped in clipped, referential phrases, with melodic sections and a smattering of uncredited ad-libs by some of the genre’s true recent innovators (Young Thug, 21 Savage, Quavo, BlocBoy JB). That none of them — including the song’s lead artist and writer, Donald Glover — bothered to show up and accept the trophy for the songwriters was also apt for a show that has long struggled with its handling of hip-hop, dating back to the first-ever rap award in 1989, when a number of the nominees boycotted. (Kendrick Lamar and Drake, the most nominated artists of the night, also declined to perform; the “This Is America” producer Ludwig Goransson accepted the second award.) But the first no-show led to an awkward dead-air moment as the presenters, Alicia Keys and John Mayer, shuffled around the stage, trying to figure out what to do next. One of Childish Gambino’s managers tweeted a shrug emoji. But what really underlined the sharp elbow of a nonappearance was that Glover did appear as part of the Grammys telecast, after all — starring in a cellphone commercial that aired more than once. COSCARELLI “Welcome to the Grammys,” Cardi B proclaimed one hour and 28 minutes into the Grammys, luxuriating atop a jewel-encrusted piano that would make Liberace blink. She started her performance of “Money” in a dramatic cape like a sexy vampire leopard, and ended it sporting a ring of feathers like the baddest peacock on the block. Her set of plush banquets evoked vintage glitz, but 20 dancers doing floor work, four more waving large fans and a flamboyant pianist — Chloe Flower — couldn’t steal attention from the main attraction. When she returned to the stage to accept the award for best rap album, she had switched modes: from swagger to heart. “I can’t breathe,” she said, struggling for a brief moment to organize her thoughts. An entire arena was ready to offer up their lungs. GANZ [See the full winners list.] During the 19-second fingerpicked introduction to the power ballad “Shallow,” Lady Gaga executed two full body hair flips, one side kick and seven exaggerated stabbing motions with her left arm, each punctuating plucks of Mark Ronson’s acoustic guitar. As she sang the verses to the song, the standout from “A Star Is Born,” she acted out seemingly the entire arc of rock stardom: drinking, doing cocaine and torturing a microphone stand. Lady Gaga is one of our most gloriously talented pop stars, and one of the most nerve-racking, because you never know when her tango with good taste will dip into disaster. In her attempt to make this performance of “Shallow” the most everything, she ended up with less. GANZ The first song on Kacey Musgraves’s album of the year winner, “Golden Hour,” is “Slow Burn,” a slightly psychedelic country ballad about how chill she can be — in love, in her career and just in general. Critically respected but largely ignored by the Nashville establishment, Musgraves spent most of Grammys night edging her way, patiently, into the spotlight. Her first appearance, to perform her song “Rainbow,” betrayed some nerves. As part of the Dolly Parton tribute, Musgraves’s hair had gotten bigger but she was still muscled over by a vocally pushy Katy Perry on “Here You Come Again.” By the time she took center stage to accept the show’s final award, though, having won best country album and then beaten out pop stars like Drake, Cardi B and Kendrick Lamar for the top all-genre prize, the Grammys had come to her, and Musgraves delivered a simple, effective moment of gratitude that showed just how easy she is to root for. In a room used to having the air sucked out of it by all sorts of try-hards and egomaniacs, Musgraves just let it breathe. COSCARELLI H.E.R., the shades-wearing singer, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist who won the Grammy for best R&B album, summoned echoes of Prince and “Purple Rain” with reverberating chords from her electric guitar as she sang “Hard Place.” Singers and a string section gathered onstage as the song moved into a gospel-charged crescendo and H.E.R. let loose more expansive, ever more soulful melismas. She wasn’t done until she had flaunted some wailing lead guitar and then eased the song back down, with poised dynamics at every moment — the kind of real-time musicianship the Grammys still hope to reward. PARELES Let’s say up front that Jennifer Lopez is a genuinely versatile talent — a spectacular dancer, an underrated actress, a person who sings. There are numerous ways she could have enlivened any number of parts of the Grammys this year, or any other year. Fronting a Motown tribute, however — yeah, how about no? Lopez did not appear to be singing live at any point during her six-minute-plus performance, to the chagrin of many online, and perhaps also to any of the dozens of R&B singers who could have handled these songs with verve and power. While the dance routines were strong, turning the music of Motown — which featured some of the most vital, urgent vocals in pop music history — into a Busby Berkeley routine was a swing and a miss. CARAMANICA It is nigh impossible to pay full tribute to Aretha Franklin, who had one of the most forceful, nuanced and outrageous voices of the last century. So Yolanda Adams, Andra Day and Fantasia didn’t go over the top on their version of “(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman.” The performance was taut — just three sharp vocalists delivering impassioned singing, paying homage to an icon while silently accepting there are shoes that can never fully be filled. CARAMANICA Miley Cyrus has never won a Grammy. She was not up for one this year. She’s only been nominated once ever. And yet! Cyrus came to play on Sunday, joining Shawn Mendes to make an unnecessary (sleeveless) duet a true power ballad, and then appearing again for a tribute to her godmother, Dolly Parton. Cyrus was loose, but focused; impactful, but not scenery-chewing, and, knowing her nonstop-ness, she probably wanted more. She could’ve torn up that cage with Travis Scott! She could’ve kept “Shallow” earthbound! She could’ve hosted! Bless her. COSCARELLI Some Grammy performances have little to do with music in itself. The recording business owes a lot to Diana Ross, who had dozens of No. 1 hits, turns 75 in March and is still touring this year. What she never got, with the Supremes or solo, was a competitive Grammy award; the Recording Academy came up with a Lifetime Achievement award in 2012. So when she arrived onstage in a regal, gauzy red gown, after being introduced by her grandson, her presence was enough. She got through the retrospective gratitude of “The Best Years of My Life” (despite an ill-advised upward key change) and an arm-waving singalong of “Reach Out and Touch (Somebody’s Hand),” as she strolled through the audience. “Learn, dream, unlock new doors,” she exhorted. “All is possible.” The standing ovation was a cumulative appreciation. PARELES Between a 2014 Super Bowl appearance with Bruno Mars and this Grammy Awards duet with Post Malone, Red Hot Chili Peppers have made themselves symbolic elder statesmen of excess. Excess was the thematic link for a three-part Grammy medley: Post Malone’s acoustic-guitar-strumming ballad “Stay” (recalling a lovers’ quarrel while he was “too drunk to talk”) followed by his singsong, self-censored boasts of overindulgence in “Rockstar” and then the Chili Peppers’ 2016 song “Dark Necessities,” which hints at addiction and self-destructive impulses. Post Malone’s self-satisfied self-pity coupled with the Chili Peppers’ we-can-still-do-this athleticism — the singer Anthony Kiedis ended up shirtless — all played like unintentional parody. Post Malone also made no mention of his collaborator on “Rockstar”: 21 Savage, currently detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. PARELES Janelle Monáe has extensive ideas about cybernetic control vs. sensual abandon; she also has old-school showbiz razzle-dazzle. She combined them all to perform “Make Me Feel,” a song that harks back to the Minneapolis funk of Prince and prime Janet Jackson. Flanked by dancers who were costumed as shiny automatons, she swaggered through the song with robotic twitches, hip-pumping carnality and even some moonwalking, adding a snippet of her gynocentric song “Pynk” and the admonition, “Let the vagina have a monologue!” She earned the mic drop that ended the song. PARELES The Grammys, structurally, still look like they could be filmed in the 1970s. The camera setups are fairly flat, and the performances are tightly controlled. So credit Travis Scott for taking a much-needed wrecking ball to the format. He began his performance with a coolly tempered “Stop Trying to Be God,” backed by James Blake duetting with Philip Bailey (of Earth, Wind and Fire). But then the scene switched: Scott reappeared inside a tall cage rapping “No Bystanders,” and was swarmed by dozens of ecstatic revelers, some of whom began scaling the cage walls. Eventually Scott climbed up, hopped over the top and landed on the outstretched arms of his faithful. For a show that likes to pretend music moves in one direction — from the stage outward — this was a welcome reminder that it can also go up, down, around, and explode in plain sight. CARAMANICA "
5caf67dc49f0eacbf1f82d71,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/arts/music/george-crumb-90th-birthday.html,"MEDIA, Penn. — The sounds that filter into George Crumb’s composition studio here are a typically suburban mix of placid and suddenly brash. The occasional car skulks by on the leafy street outside. Visitors are greeted by vociferous barking from one of the shelter dogs rescued by Mr. Crumb and his wife of 70 years, Elizabeth. She keeps the radio on the classical music station most of the day, while their youngest son, Peter, who lives with them, blasts country in his bedroom upstairs. The music Mr. Crumb has dreamed up in this home studio, a converted garage, over the decades is often peaceful and jolting, like his sonic environment. But his compositions unfold in another world that is dreamlike and sometimes nightmarish. He continues to compose here even as he approaches his 90th birthday, coming in October. On Sunday and Tuesday, the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center gets in early on the celebration, presenting a two-concert tribute to Mr. Crumb at Alice Tully Hall. Included is the premiere of a new piece for percussion ensemble, as well as some of the classic works that have made him one of the most recognizable and beloved voices in contemporary music. Among them are “Vox Balaenae,” which draws whale-like sounds from a flute, and the Vietnam War-haunted “Black Angels” for amplified string quartet, which one critic called “a work of frightening intensity, where Jimi Hendrix and Pierrot Lunaire shake hands with the devil.” In “Music for a Summer Evening,” for two pianos and percussion, the musicians become celebrants in a mesmerizing ritual that requires the pianists to reach deep into the instrument’s strings. The pianist Gilbert Kalish, who has long championed this music and will perform in both concerts, spoke in an interview about Mr. Crumb’s expansion of the piano’s color palette through novel techniques. “It’s like a new instrument he’s invented,” he said. “And it’s really wild.” Mr. Crumb’s compositions inhabit a strange kind of suburbia themselves, a liminal space, rooted in the canon of Western music but venturing out into the world of natural sounds and acoustic phenomena. Echoes abound, whether from the careful manipulation of overtones and resonances or through the discreet halo created by metallic percussion. Mr. Crumb, who grew up in Charleston, W.Va., with the sound of a rushing river ricocheting off the surrounding hills, said early sound memories might have found a way into his music. “There were echoes constantly,” he said on a recent afternoon in his studio, as he sat in an office chair that allowed him to scoot back and forth between a desk piled high with scores and a piano in need of tuning. “I do think that composers inherit a kind of acoustic.” Fragments from other composers float through his works and settle in strange places. “Vox Balaenae” references the optimistic ascending brass fanfare of Strauss’s “Also Sprach Zarathustra,” but in so spectral a manner that it seems like a trick of the listener’s imagination. For much of Mr. Crumb’s career, such quotations were anathema to the reigning modernist ethos. But the battles that raged in the middle of the 20th century between warring aesthetic movements seem to have passed him by. Asked whether he was ever criticized for writing tonal pieces or quoting Chopin, Mr. Crumb replied innocently. “No, I don’t recall anything like that,” he said as his face creased into a smile. “Maybe they spoke about it, and I didn’t hear them.” While much of the respected music in those days was intellectual and a bit airless, “George was a maverick,” Mr. Kalish said. “His music was so appealing and emotional.” That’s not to say Mr. Crumb makes it easy for performers. His scores are known to delight and terrify musicians in equal measure. The hand-drawn staves on his manuscripts sometimes curve into circles or break up into islands in a sea of white paper. The flutist Tara Helen O’Connor, who will perform “Vox Balaenae” on Sunday, said in an interview that the arrangement of notes on the page in a Crumb score is “his way of expressing how the music flows through space, which is really beautiful and unique.” At the same time, she added, “it also leaves some of the magic and creativity up to the performer.” Folded into the elegant design are countless instructions, both exacting and poetic. Some of them read more like stage directions than expressive markings: Under the title “An Idyll for the Misbegotten,” a work for flute and drums, Mr. Crumb wrote “to be heard from afar, over a lake, on a moonlit evening in August.” “It puts the performer into that space,” Ms. O’Connor said. “Now I have a temperature; there’s insects and bugs; and there’s a thunderstorm brewing.” The music becomes an organic process: “It’s based in nature.” For Mr. Crumb, the process of designing his manuscripts and drawing each stave by hand is painstaking, but he wouldn’t have it any other way. “I just don’t like computer notation,” he said. “It all looks alike.” His works are loved by performers and audiences to a degree that few other living composers can match. Mr. Crumb counts over 20 recordings of his piano cycle “Makrokosmos” alone. Last fall, he received three new ones in the mail in the space of six weeks, made by pianists from Spain, Greece and Japan. But it’s not just the notation that’s laborious for Mr. Crumb. Over a long career he has produced just around 50 pieces, a number he compared, with a wistful laugh, with the more than 600 Mozart wrote in a much shorter life. He has said his productivity dipped in the 1980s and into the ’90s as he devoted himself to teaching. “You read about some composers who could write at the speed of wind,” Mr. Crumb said. “It was never that way for me. It’s like groping for something that’s resistant.” He gestured to the stacks of manuscript scores on his desk, with their custom-drawn staves and hand-lettered instructions. “You truly have to believe that you live forever,” he said. “Because it takes time.” "
5c7d2ce049f0eacbf105b3b4,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/04/obituaries/keith-flint-dead.html,"LONDON — Keith Flint, a high-octane founding member of the British dance act the Prodigy, who sang lead vocals on the hits “Firestarter” and “Breathe,” was found dead on Monday in Essex, England. He was 49. His death was announced on the band’s Instagram account. In a post on Monday, Liam Howlett, the band’s main musician, said Flint had killed himself. “I can’t believe I’m saying this but our brother Keith took his own life over the weekend,” Mr. Howlett wrote, adding that he was angry, confused and heartbroken by the news. The Prodigy was scheduled to tour the United States in May, with one show set for Terminal 5 in Manhattan. It has not been announced whether the shows will go ahead. The Prodigy came to prominence in 1997 with “The Fat of the Land,” the group’s third studio album, which went to No. 1 in Britain and the United States and made underground British dance music a hit across the Atlantic. Mr. Flint, with his distinctive double mohawk and endless energy, was one of the main factors behind the band’s appeal, along with the band’s other singer, Maxim Reality (Keith Palmer). Mr. Flint and Maxim Reality were “folk devils” and “emissaries from techno’s psychic underworld,” Ann Powers, a New York Times pop music critic, wrote in 1998 in a review of the band’s live show. Mr. Flint explained his look and onstage antics in a 2009 interview with The Guardian. After wearing his hair in a mohawk at school, he was “chucked out and sent to a special school,” he said. “They had to hypnotize me to settle me down — I just had so much energy.” Being onstage was a release for him, he added. “It gets my mental energy out,” he said. “That’s why I’m really honest onstage. I’m not there for the beauty of my voice or to be the best dancer. I go out to express myself and stir up the audience.” Keith Charles Flint was born on Sept. 17, 1969, in Redbridge, in East London, and grew up in Braintree, a suburb in Essex. He had an unhappy childhood, and his parents split up when he was young. He told The Times of London that he stopped talking to his father entirely in later life. Mr. Flint was bright but had dyslexia. That led to problems at school, and he left at age 15. He then went to work as a roofer, according to the BBC. In 1989, Mr. Flint met Mr. Howlett at a rave and asked the D.J. for a mixtape. Mr. Howlett gave him one featuring some of his own tracks, writing the word “Prodigy” (the name of a synthesizer made by Moog) on the cover. Mr. Flint loved the music and suggested that he and a friend, Leeroy Thornhill, dance onstage as Mr. Howlett played. The band found immediate success in Britain with its debut single, “Charly,” a dance track from 1991 based on a sample from a 1970s public information film about child safety: “Charley says always tell your mummy before you go off somewhere.” Mr. Flint, who had long hair at the time, danced manically throughout the song's video. The band’s popularity grew as the British government tried to clamp down on the country’s rave scene. The Prodigy’s second album, “Music for the Jilted Generation,” with its frenetic beats and defiant lyrics, caught the mood of rebellion as young people continued to stage outdoor parties despite a 1994 law banning them. But the band’s popularity peaked only after Mr. Flint started singing. “Firestarter,” the first single from the Prodigy’s third album, “The Fat of the Land,” marked a change in direction, mixing rave music with rock guitars. “I’m a firestarter, twisted firestarter,” Mr. Flint sneered, playing the role of cartoon villain. “I’m the trouble starter, punking instigator.” Mr. Flint sang on many other Prodigy releases (the band’s seventh album, “No Tourists,” was released last year), although none found as much success as “Firestarter” and “Breathe.” “Baby’s Got a Temper,” a 2002 single, featured Mr. Flint singing in praise of Rohypnol, a drug associated with date rape. It was widely criticized and caused Mr. Howlett to rethink the band’s direction. Mr. Flint was dropped from singing on the band’s next album in favor of guest singers, although he continued to perform at live concerts and returned for “Invaders Must Die” in 2009. Mr. Flint’s life sometimes involved problems with depression and prescription drugs. In 2009, he told The Times of London that he had once been suicidal. His high-energy onstage antics were reflected in other interests, too. Mr. Flint was a lover of motorbikes and owned a successful motorcycle racing team. He also ran a pub in Essex for several years. In 2015, he told The Guardian that the bar had an open fireplace, and that every time he went to light it, somebody would make a “Firestarter” joke. “I’m like, ‘That’s very funny, you owe me a pound,’ ” he recalled saying. He gave all the money collected to charity, he said. Mr. Flint’s death prompted many tributes online, including from dance music stars and fans of the band. “He did what all music stars are meant to do,” Kathy Burke, a British comedian and actress, wrote on Twitter. “He frightened your mums and dads.” "
5c5795f33a125f5075c07d67,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/03/arts/music/super-bowl-halftime-show.html,"Maroon 5 — a quasi-soul, quasi-rock, utterly funkless band — was the main attraction at the Super Bowl halftime show at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, likely the third or eighth or maybe 14th choice for a headliner. In a year in which the Super Bowl halftime show has become a referendum on political mindfulness, in which the N.F.L. has become a staging ground for conversations about racial justice in America, Maroon 5 was a cynically apt choice. It is neutral, inoffensive, sleek without promising too much. For nearly two decades, it has been wildly popular without leaving much of a musical mark, as easy to forget as mild weather. And the band did no better during its 13 and a half minutes onstage, in a performance that was dynamically flat, mushy at the edges, worthy of something much worse than derision: a shrug. It was an inessential performance from a band that might have lost some moral authority if it had any moral authority to lose. Perhaps for the N.F.L., which probably sought to make the halftime performance as anodyne as possible, this was a victory. But what saddles Maroon 5 as a band — its propensity to pretend lithe things are thumping, its commitment to thinning out the soul and rock of the 1970s and 1980s until they’re so brittle they might snap — doomed this performance, which blithely skated through a half-dozen of the band’s hits. [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] And in a year in which the political valence of the halftime show mattered more than ever, the band’s stubborn resistance was glaring. The N.F.L. canceled the traditional news conference for performers this year, looking to avoid a fiasco. But the frontman Adam Levine did do an interview with “Entertainment Tonight” in which he suggested that the choice to perform at the halftime show triggers in some an “insatiable urge to hate a little bit.” “No one thought about it more than I did,” he added, not very reassuringly. “I’m not in the right profession if I can’t handle a little bit of controversy.” Efforts to blunt Maroon 5’s dullness, and its political aversion, were being made for weeks before the formal announcement that it would be the headliner. In December, Variety reported that the band had approached a half-dozen black artists to appear as part of the performance. But the decision of whether to perform was now oriented around the protests of Colin Kaepernick and other N.F.L. players, who in 2016 began taking a knee during the national anthem (or otherwise not standing at attention) as a means of drawing attention to the systemic oppression of black people in this country. The halftime show — one of the biggest stages in pop, and also an unpaid performance on behalf of the N.F.L. — became radioactive. Perform, and be perceived as a shill for the league. (Kaepernick is pursuing a grievance against the N.F.L., accusing team owners of colluding to keep him from playing in the league.) Ultimately, Maroon 5 — a band that hasn’t had a Top 20 hit without a black or Latina guest performer in four years — was joined by Travis Scott, hip-hop’s most energetic performer, but not one much troubled by political concerns. (Last month, Scott announced he would, in partnership with the N.F.L., donate $500,000 to a nonprofit organization, Dream Corps.) Also added to the performance was Big Boi — one half of Outkast, and an Atlanta rap elder — which felt like an attempt at moral cover. Online petitions requested all of the performers take a knee in support of Kaepernick and his goals. No one did. For what it’s worth, the toxicity of being associated with the Super Bowl didn’t appear to extend beyond the halftime performance. Chance the Rapper performed in a Doritos commercial (with the Backstreet Boys); 2 Chainz was entertaining in an ad for Expensify; Cardi B and Lil Jon tag-teamed in a Pepsi ad. Both of the pregame performances were by black artists: a taut, controlled reading of “America the Beautiful” by Chloe x Halle and an impressive, if Disney-saccharine, national anthem from Gladys Knight, who before the game criticized Kaepernick for making the anthem a site of protest. In this context, Maroon 5 was a dead band walking: a base coat destined to be painted over. Three years ago, Beyoncé effectively hijacked Coldplay’s performance for one of the most rousing and politically savvy halftime performances ever. But nothing even remotely on that scale happened here. Scott and Big Boi were ushered on and offstage quickly, boxes that had been checked off. Scott bark-rapped his way through “Sicko Mode,” and at the end of his moment, fell backward onto the crowd, as close to his mayhem-filled live shows as circumstances allowed. Big Boi emerged in a Cadillac wearing a fur coat — the most exciting moment of the whole show — and did a casual pass at Outkast’s “The Way You Move,” with Sleepy Brown. When Levine joined them for a synchronized two-step, it took him a second or two to catch the groove. "
5c4e117b3a125f5075c0695b,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/27/arts/music/juilliard-focus-festival-review.html,"Think of the great patrons of music, and some resonant names come to mind: Nikolaus, Prince Esterhazy, for instance, who for three decades employed Joseph Haydn; or Cardinal Pietro Ottoboni, who funded Italian baroque luminaries. But cast around for their successors — the most important commissioners of living composers — and you encounter a string of initials: BBC, WDR, SWR. The fertile generosity of these public broadcasters (the latter two are Westdeutscher Rundfunk and Südwestrundfunk, regional radio entities with headquarters in Cologne and Stuttgart) is the subject of this year’s Focus Festival at the Juilliard School. It opened on Friday with a stimulating concert by the New Juilliard Ensemble in the Peter Jay Sharp Theater in Manhattan. Under the banner “On the Air! A Salute to 75 Years of International Radio Commissioning,” the festival presents five more programs, through Feb. 1, that reveal how much of a lifeline noncommercial radio has become to composers since the end of World War II. The conductor Joel Sachs, who designed the festival and led Friday’s concert, said in a phone interview that a British composer had told him bluntly: “We’d all starve without the BBC.” While the festival draws attention to the wealth of opportunities created by international broadcasters, it also points a finger at the glaring absence of similar initiatives in the United States. “The problem with commercial radio is that it doesn’t want to do anything as esoteric as classical music,” Mr. Sachs said, “let alone commission contemporary music.” Mr. Sachs said that in his research he had learned of a handful of new works commissioned by isolated American broadcasters, including stations in Minnesota and Cincinnati. But these numbers paled next to the statistics he gathered of radio commissions from Europe and Canada in the postwar era. The BBC supplied a list, possibly incomplete, of nearly 1,600 compositions. Radio France listed 2,300 titles. German regional broadcasters were each responsible for hundreds of works. Canadian composers have benefited from the robust support of the CBC, which commissioned some 1,200 pieces. These broadcasters are cultural powerhouses, and not just on the airwaves. Most have their own ensembles, including symphony orchestras and choirs, and run festivals like the Witten Days for New Chamber Music, organized by the WDR, or the Donaueschingen Festival, a storied engine of avant-garde music that is now under the auspices of the SWR. Each summer the BBC Proms whip up public enthusiasm and draw huge crowds with televised concerts that include new commissions. Some countries make a point of targeting their commissioning largess toward their own composers. One example is Finnish Radio, which sees fostering new Finnish music as part of its mission. That’s how a Modernist gem like Jouni Kaipainen’s “Trois Morceaux de l’Aube” came into being. It received a superb performance on Friday by the cellist Sasha Scolnik-Brower and the pianist Michalis Boliakis. A radio commission gave life to this darkly ruminative work, shot through with flashes of rhythmic exuberance, in 1981, when the composer was 25. In Germany, where the postwar occupying powers designed a decentralized broadcasting landscape free of government control, the mission is broader. In a phone interview, Harry Vogt, who has headed the new music program at the WDR for decades, said he sees it as his responsibility “to produce things, far from commercial considerations, that wouldn’t come into being on their own.” The balancing act there lies in staying accountable to the public through programs — “you don’t want to do things that interest nobody,” he said — while granting composers the creative freedom to develop their art away from the pressures of the market. Mr. Vogt said his commissions also extend beyond the concert hall to sound installations in public and industrial spaces in order to reach new listeners. “There is always an educational component, too,” he said, “though you try to avoid it reeking of pedagogy.” Friday’s concert proved that, in casting the net wide, the patronage of the broadcasters reels in works of varying quality. I was underwhelmed by Colin Matthews’s “A Voice to Wake,” with its vocal line that felt somehow both sibylline and mechanical. The Korean-German composer Younghi Pagh-Paan’s “U-MUL (The Well),” commissioned by WDR, relied a little too heavily on watery sound painting. On the other hand, listeners are indebted to Radio France for Akira Nishimura’s beguiling “Corps d’Arc-en-Ciel,” with its brilliant play on density and light. And, in this context, it was instructive to hear Salvatore Sciarrino’s “Archeologia del Telefono,” an instrumental work infused with his trademark fragility, in which brittle sounds hover on the edge of imperceptibility, carrying subtle charges of humor. In concert, Sciarrino’s music fascinates in part because of the odd techniques used to draw sounds from the instrument. I couldn’t help but wonder how a radio listener would interpret the dry flutter produced by a violinist bowing what looked like a Post-it note tacked to her instrument. The esoteric sound world of such works requires an even more intense concentration on the part of the radio listener who, unlike the audience in the room, is literally all ears. "
5c7043073a125f5075c0b101,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/22/arts/music/pretty-yende-la-fille-du-regiment-met-opera.html,"It is a brief, charming moment — and subtle enough that some audience members may miss it. But it speaks loudly as a symbol: the distinctive clicks of Zulu, the African language, echoing from the stage of the Metropolitan Opera. It comes during Donizetti’s comedy “La Fille du Régiment.” Pretty Yende, the bel canto soprano singing the title role — Marie, an orphan raised by an army regiment — ad-libs a brief spoken monologue as her character gives vent to overwhelming, conflicting emotions of love and frustration as she deals with laundry and peels potatoes. In this production, by the director Laurent Pelly, the moment has always been an opportunity for singers to depart from the French libretto in a rush of words and sounds, flights of verbiage that leave subtitles in the dust. When Ms. Yende, 33, made the part her own in the current revival, she decided to incorporate Zulu, which she grew up speaking in South Africa. As the broader field of classical music lags in diversity — and as opera companies have sometimes struggled to preserve what is great about works like “Aida,” “Otello,” “Madama Butterfly” and “Turandot” while jettisoning their outdated, often offensive portrayals of non-European cultures — it sends a powerful message. Ms. Yende, an international star who is on the cover of this month’s Opera News, spoke about how she came up with her Zulu moment for “Fille,” which will be broadcast live in cinemas worldwide on March 2. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation. Could tell me a little bit about how this came about? It started in one of the rehearsals, when I was doing the debut in Seville, Spain — instinctively, because it’s not scripted. I couldn’t find the vocabulary for what I truly wanted to say, that emotional part of Marie. And so I just started speaking Zulu. The whole room, they were like, “We weren’t expecting that!” I wasn’t expecting it, either, but somehow, emotionally, I went that route. I didn’t want to plan it, because it’s one part in the show where she doesn’t know what she’s saying. She’s in so many emotional states. She’s in love, and she’s afraid, and she wants everything. And so when I started doing it in Zulu, the director was then like: “That’s interesting. It actually works. Do you want to keep it?” I was like, “Sure!” What are you saying? It happens just after the man you love visits you at the regiment and is dragged off. Well it’s different every night. The rough translation is: “Oh, my goodness, I really wanted to kiss him more, but what can I do? I have to work, now he’s gone! O.K., fine, I have to do what I need to do. This doesn’t have to be here, it has to be here! So that I can work properly. And then, of course, what can one do? It’s the military: left, right, left, right!” But one thing that you probably heard was the clicks when I say “ingqondo,” which is “mind.” What does it feel like to be able to speak Zulu at the Met? It feels so wonderful because I never thought of having this kind of possibility to be able to literally have a piece of my true self onstage. We embody these characters, and we go through their emotional journeys. And we are somewhat restricted to their texts, and the music of course, and sometimes the production as well. But somehow this production has allowed me this incredible privilege to actually show literally that a part of me is in the music, too. Saying that this is Pretty, and she’s playing Marie. And these two human beings are meeting together to express a common human emotional state. Because I, too, when I am crushing on a boy, don’t have words sometimes. That happens; it’s a human experience, which is truly wonderful. When you were studying in Cape Town, were there Zulu operas that you sang?  No, unfortunately not. Composers have just recently started to really show interest in composing South African stories and operas. So who knows? Maybe next time at the Metropolitan Opera I wouldn’t have to improvise — it would actually be written down. It seems like the South African opera scene is growing, with singers like you and the bass-baritone Musa Ngqungwana and the soprano Golda Schultz, who is currently in the Met’s “Falstaff,” appearing around the world.  There’s incredible talent in my country, and if you think I’m the only one that can do what I do, it’s a big mistake. You’ll find 10, 20 people able to do that. The beauty is that each and every person, of course, they have their own unique gifts and the way they use it. But as far as talent is concerned, and opportunities — especially when it comes to black artists — it has really enhanced them and made them believe that they too can be able to express themselves this way. Because many others, before Mandela was released, were never given that opportunity. So we are just enjoying this time. And the operatic world has truly opened its doors for us. In a sense, I think that music, as we’re dealing with harmony, is teaching the world that truly there shouldn’t be barriers. We can live in harmony and express our humanness together, through the arts. "
5c4052263a125f5075c04df7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/well/live/a-cancer-rap-with-thanks-to-nina-simone.html,"Two women in my cancer support group died last year; both were considerably younger than I am. Furious at the disease, I’m starting the new year with a yowl. Survivors of patients who have not survived, people dealing with a terminal condition, and their caregivers are generally advised to seek acceptance. However, great artists of anger have taught us how cathartic a rousing roar can be, especially when the object of rage is not a conjured scapegoat but a clear and present danger. One of the greatest of those artists in living memory — the singer, pianist, composer Nina Simone — lambasted the disasters of American racism. Does she have something to teach those of us dealing with cancer-related tragedies? In 1963, after the killings of Medgar Evers and of four little girls in the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Ms. Simone began producing a number of anthems for the civil rights and black power movements. One of her most powerful songs continues to be all too relevant. The lyrics of “Mississippi Goddam,” I thought, might serve me while cancer’s casualties stun me. By tweaking Nina Simone’s words, would I implicitly be comparing rampant racism to metastatic disease or vice versa? I could live with that analogy, as Susan Sontag — the public intellectual who rejected all metaphors of illness — once did. Ms. Simone reinvented other refrains created by writers of many different ethnicities and nations, shaping them to her purposes. In doing so, she has emboldened me to recycle some of her stanzas for people from diverse backgrounds who live with cancer. When borrowing is acknowledged, after all, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. Here, then, is a homage to Nina Simone that I hope will lead you to listen to her terrific rendition of “Mississippi Goddam.” In an aside within this edgy elegy of damaged lives, she calls it “a show tune, but the show hasn’t been written for it yet.” I also feel as if I have been watching a show that hasn’t been written yet. After too many cancer-related setbacks and deaths of relatives, friends, and correspondents — you readers could not be more moving about your own bereavements — I started belting Nina Simone’s protest with new words, invigorated by her spirit of indignant fury. When cancer feels like an epidemic, it may be easier to rage than to mourn, as all of us undoubtedly will, over rending losses. Carcinoma Goddam Myeloma’s got me so upsetLeukemia’s made me lose my rest And everybody knows about carcinoma goddam. Metastatic breast has gotten me upset Mesothelioma made me lose my rest And everybody knows about pancreatic goddam. Can’t you see it? Can’t you feel it? It’s all in the air I can’t stand the pressure much longer Somebody say a prayer. Prostatic got me all upsetGlioblastoma’s made me lose my restAnd everybody knows about ovarian goddam. Scans and tests on my trailKids cry and mates flail. White cat crossed my path I think every day’s gonna be my last. Lord have mercy on this land of mine Will we all get it in due time? People gone here, People gone there, I’ve even stopped believing in prayer. Don’t tell meI’ll tell you — Me and my tribe are just about due. I’ve been there so I submit They keep on saying “Beat it!” But that’s just the trouble “Beat it!”Taking the chemo “Beat it!” Hospital city “Beat it!” It’s just plain misery “Beat it!” You’re too damned hazy “Beat it!” The thinking’s crazy “Beat it!” Where am I going?What am I doing? I don’t know I don’t know. Bankruptcy Insurance holdups — Trying to say they’re just mix-ups. All I want is equality For my sister, my brother, my people and me. Oh this whole country’s full of lies. Are we all gonna die and die like flies? I’ve been there so I’m in a snit They keep on saying “Beat it!” But that’s just the trouble “Beat it!” Reoperations “Beat it!” Focused radiations “Beat it!” Frozen ablations “Beat it!” Do things gradually “Beat it!” But bring more tragedy. “Beat it!” Why don’t you see it?

5c800d2a49f0eacbf105ba93,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/06/arts/music/john-adams-thomas-ades-piano.html,"After 250 years or so, the piano concerto has some life in it yet. This week alone, two piano concertos by two eminent composers, Thomas Adès and John Adams, will have their premieres on the same evening. They follow close on the heels of another, by the Pulitzer Prize-winner Caroline Shaw, presented by the Seattle Symphony earlier this year. On the East Coast, Mr. Adès will conduct the Boston Symphony Orchestra in his unambiguously titled Concerto for Piano and Orchestra, featuring Kirill Gerstein. On the other side of the country, the Los Angeles Philharmonic, under Gustavo Dudamel, will play Mr. Adams’s “Must the Devil Have All the Good Tunes?” with Yuja Wang. (No need to despair if you’re not in Boston or Los Angeles: Mr. Adès’s work travels to Carnegie Hall on March 20, and “Must the Devil” comes to Lincoln Center this fall, with a long list of future performances planned around the world through at least 2020.) In their own postmodern ways, these concertos acknowledge the genre’s long and wide-ranging history, while also searching for what else it is capable of. Here are previews of both. If this piece has a predecessor, it’s Mr. Adès’s “In Seven Days” (2008), a work that moves fluidly between concerto and tone poem. Mr. Gerstein was performing it with the Boston Symphony in 2012 when he gathered the courage to ask the composer to write something for him. “I remember saying that I knew I had to stand in line for a while,” Mr. Gerstein said. “And Tom charmingly said, ‘Does it have to be a solo piece?’” (Mr. Gerstein later learned from Mr. Adès’s publisher that he had “skipped the line,” by a lot.) Mr. Adès, 48, wanted to write, he recalled, “a proper piano concerto.” And in Mr. Gerstein he found a muse to explore the form’s tradition and the idea of virtuosity itself. The two met in the mid-2000s while performing Stravinsky’s “Les Noces,” and have since become friends with the kind of mutual admiration that leads to new music: Mr. Adès arranged a Berceuse from his opera “The Exterminating Angel” for Mr. Gerstein, who gave its premiere last month in Vienna. They’ve also embarked on a two-piano recital tour that will stop at Zankel Hall in New York on March 13. Mr. Adès’s nod to tradition begins with the title of the piece — unadorned and unpoetic. And, like nearly every concerto throughout history, it is in three movements, opening with the statement of a theme from both the piano and the orchestra. But there is always a twist with Mr. Adès. He revels in homage and quotation — just listen to his delightful Belle Époque pastiche score for the film “Colette” — and here he finds ways to adhere to convention while at the same time breaking free with surprising melodies and dizzying demands on the pianist. “I’ve really asked this piece what it wanted to do,” Mr. Adès said. “What it wanted to do was speak along traditional lines, the way a tree is a traditional form: It will always have a trunk. But I suppose part of me feels that the most freshness can be found in revisiting the tradition.” While preparing for the premiere, Mr. Gerstein — who with this week’s performances is reuniting with the Boston Symphony after recording Busoni’s colossal Piano Concerto in C with the orchestra — has often checked in with Mr. Adès, sending cellphone videos and asking interpretive questions in text messages. “I feel like I don’t have any anxiety,” Mr. Adès said. “Kirill seems to absorb it, and it speaks through him. It’s nice not to have any worry.” “I can’t play the piano,” Mr. Adams, 72, confessed in an interview. “I have never even taken a piano lesson.” That hasn’t stopped him from writing some of the most spellbinding contemporary music for the instrument, like “Phrygian Gates” or the joyous and sweeping “Grand Pianola Music”; or the duet “Hallelujah Junction,” which was inspired by the name of a truck stop and was a case, he has often said, of a title looking for a piece. His new concerto has a similar origin story. While working on his oratorio “The Gospel According to the Other Mary,” he said, he came across an old New Yorker article that included a phrase begging to be a title: “Must the Devil Have All the Good Tunes?” Mr. Adams hoped the quote came from Chuck Berry, but found out later it was Martin Luther’s. The words also suggested, Mr. Adams said, the Totentanz, or danse macabre. You can hear a similarity between Liszt’s “Totentanz” and “Must the Devil”: Both pieces begin with a low and lumbering piano part over the orchestra. But whereas Liszt opens with a Dies Irae melody, Mr. Adams aims for something funky and distinctly American. (The orchestration calls for a honky-tonk piano and a bass guitar.) What follows is a concerto that more or less adheres to fast-slow-fast convention but within a sui generis, single-movement form (as opposed to three, like the Adès) — similar to the way Mr. Adams has written symphony-length works without identifying them as such, like “Harmonielehre” and “Naïve and Sentimental Music.” “We live in a time when there are no templates,” he said. “Mozart was a genius but he didn’t have to find a new template for each piece. Each of us, when we write a new piece now, whether it’s a 22-year-old composer or someone my age, we have to decide its form.” The piano part, though it will be played by other soloists including Jeremy Denk and Vikingur Olafsson in the future, was written specifically for Ms. Wang — a superstar who delivers blurry-handed dazzle in showy standards but nuanced readings in more quietly demanding works, like Robert Schumann’s Piano Concerto in A minor. “She’s in there a lot,” Mr. Adams said of “Must the Devil.” He recalled being impressed by a video of Ms. Wang playing Prokofiev with the conductor Claudio Abbado, but found “real depth” in a recording of Rachmaninoff’s Études-Tableaux. “I thought: There’s something there besides the flash.” "
5c2bbf163a125f5075c02770,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/01/obituaries/norman-gimbel-dies-at-91.html,"Norman Gimbel, the wildly versatile Brooklyn-born lyricist who won a Grammy Award for a blues hit, “Killing Me Softly With His Song”; an Oscar for a folk ballad, “It Goes Like It Goes” (from “Norma Rae”); and television immortality for the bouncy series themes to “Happy Days” and “Laverne and Shirley,” died on Dec. 19 at his home in Montecito, Calif. He was 91. The death was confirmed by his son Tony, managing partner of his father’s music publishing company, Words West. Any attempt to categorize the elder Mr. Gimbel’s musical leanings would be complicated. He was famous for the English lyrics of “The Girl From Ipanema,” Antonio Carlos Jobim’s 1964 bossa nova hit originally written in Portuguese. He also wrote English lyrics for Michel Legrand’s music from Jacques Demy’s romantic 1964 French film “The Umbrellas of Cherbourg,” most notably “I Will Wait for You” (“Till you’re here beside me, till I’m touching you”) and for what became “I Will Follow Him,” a solid hit about teenage adoration sung by Little Peggy March (age 15) in 1963. Among his early hits, “Sway” (“When marimba rhythms start to play”) was clearly Latin-accented, even when Dean Martin sang it, and “Canadian Sunset,” recorded by Andy Williams, became a jazz standard. “Ready to Take a Chance Again” (from “Foul Play,” 1978), which earned an Oscar nomination, was a wistfully hopeful love song. Jim Croce’s 1973 hit “I Got a Name” (“Movin’ me down the highway, rollin’ down the highway, movin’ ahead so life won’t pass me by”) was quintessential folk rock. Mr. Gimbel worked with David Shire on “Norma Rae,” but his most frequent collaborator may have been Charles Fox. “Killing Me Softly,” which brought Mr. Gimbel and Mr. Fox the song-of-the-year Grammy after Roberta Flack released it in 1973, had a conflict-ridden back story. Lori Lieberman, a California bistro singer, had recorded the song first (Mr. Fox and Mr. Gimbel were her producers and managers) and she said that the lyrics (among them, “I felt he found my letters and read each one out loud”) had been based on a poem she had written about attending an emotionally stirring Don McLean concert. The song, which became a hit again with the Fugees’ hip-hop cover in the 1990s, is now sometimes listed as written “in collaboration with” Ms. Lieberman. Norman Gimbel was born in Brooklyn on Nov. 16, 1927. His parents — Morris Gimbel, who was in the restaurant business, and Lottie (Nass) Gimbel — were Jewish immigrants from Austria. Norman, who studied English at Baruch College and Columbia University, began his career working for the music publisher David Blum and for Edwin H. Morris & Company. His first hit was “Ricochet,” written with Larry Coleman and Joe Darion and recorded by Teresa Brewer in 1953. The saucy, country-tinged pop song (“If you’re careless with your kisses, find another turtle dove”) rose to No. 2 on the charts. Mr. Gimbel soon moved to Los Angeles, where he worked more widely in television and film, teaming up with Mr. Fox on the themes to the hit sitcoms “Laverne and Shirley” (“Schlemiel, schlimazle, Hassenpfeffer Incorporated”) and “Happy Days” (“Sunday, Monday, happy days”) and the 1970s series “Wonder Woman” and “The Paper Chase.” He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1984. Back in New York, Mr. Gimbel wrote lyrics for two Broadway musicals, “Whoop-Up” (1958) and “The Conquering Hero” (1961), working with the composer Moose Charlap. The first show, set on an American Indian reservation, earned two Tony nominations; the second, starring Tom Poston as a fake war hero, had a book by Larry Gelbart. Despite positive reviews, both musicals flopped at the box office and closed early. Both of Mr. Gimbel’s marriages, to the fashion model Elinor Rowley and to Victoria Carver, a lawyer, ended in divorce. In addition to his son Tony, survivors include another son, Peter; two daughters, Nelly Gimbel and Hannah Gimbel Dal Pozzo; and four grandchildren. Mr. Gimbel gave relatively few interviews. In a six-minute segment as a contestant (alongside Burt Bacharach and Jerry Leiber) on “Play Your Hunch,” an early Merv Griffin game show, he spoke only three words. That verbal reticence, though, served him well professionally. “Norman had the extraordinary ability with his lyrics to capture the human condition with never an excessive word to describe a feeling or an action,” Mr. Fox, the composer, said in a statement after his writing partner’s death. He went on to praise Mr. Gimbel’s ability to conjure an entire song with its first line, and he offered examples: “Tall and tan and young and lovely.” “Strumming my pain with his fingers.” “If it takes forever, I will wait for you.” "
5c6d53813a125f5075c0a96b,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/20/arts/music/breunion-boys-brexit-band.html,"LIVERPOOL, England — On a recent Saturday, the Breunion Boys — a Dutch boy band set up in response to Britain’s planned departure from the European Union — stood in a dressing room in the basement of Liverpool University doing final warm-ups for their first show in Britain. The five members stared into one another’s eyes and kicked their legs in time to orders from Flavia Faas, the band’s songwriter and dance coach. They tried not to laugh as the exercises got quicker and quicker, so much so it was silly. “This is what we came here for!” Faas shouted as the group finished. A few moments later, they took the stage at the “Rock for Europe” event. The audience in the student union hall was only about 60 people, and decades older than the crowd at a typical boy band gig. Most stood or sat at the back, looking tired after listening to hours of pro-European Union speeches. “We don’t bite,” said Joshua Alagbe, 24, one of the band’s members, encouraging people forward. “We just want to show the real love between Britain and Europe.” The group then launched into a cover of the Backstreet Boys’ “I Want It That Way.” “Ain’t nothing but a heartbreak,” they sang. “Ain’t nothing but a mistake.” In the audience, David Murtagh, 69, a part-time roadside assistance coordinator, made a face to show it wasn’t his kind of music. “But I do like their shirts,” he said later. The Breunion Boys may sound like a stunt, but the group has grabbed more attention than most activists in the bitter debate around Brexit, as Britain’s departure from the European Union is known, including in British media outlets that support the withdrawal. Since posting the clip for their debut song, “Britain Come Back,” online in December, they have appeared on daytime television and in tabloid newspapers. The video for the song has also appeared on several comedy TV shows, especially a part when Seyed Hosseini, 22, raps “look at what you leave behind” while showing his abs. (John Oliver showed it on HBO’s “Last Week Tonight” then called the band “a pretty solid argument for leaving the E.U. on any terms necessary.”) The Liverpool show was billed as the first of a British tour, although the only other stop scheduled so far is in London on March 29, the date Britain is scheduled to leave the bloc. The woman behind the group, Julia Veldman, 30, an animator from the Netherlands, said in an interview that she genuinely believed the Breunion Boys could have an impact. “I’m very sincere,” she said. “People have tried a lot of facts and arguments and they haven’t moved the debate one inch. So we can but try with emotion.” “We know this is funny,” she added. “But that’s the strength of it. There’s no light or air anywhere in the Brexit debate. Now people talk about us, and then we can say how we feel. We’re a bit like a Trojan horse.” Veldman was living in New York when she heard the result of the 2016’s Brexit referendum. “That was literally the first time I realized there were people who didn’t like the European Union, which is stupid of course,” she said. She started crying when she heard the news, she said, adding, “We’ve had peace and opportunity in Europe for so long, and I don’t want to lose that.” The idea of using a boy band to deliver her message came quickly, Veldman said. There is nothing more British than a boy band, she added, mentioning groups like Take That and One Direction. “Being vulnerable and asking someone to reconsider can be pathetic,” she said. “But when it’s young boys who can dance and sing and are hot, it’s different.” Finding guys who could do that as well as discuss the intricacies of Brexit was difficult, Veldman added. Her search lasted a year. “There’s many people with political views,” she said. “They don’t all have sex appeal.” Before the show in Liverpool, the group talked about sometimes feeling like a real boy band. They have several hard-core fans, they said, including a group of schoolgirls that regularly sends them drawings. But they also get the online abuse — including death threats and accusations they are funded by Russia or George Soros, the financier who is often villainized by many on the far right. (“I wish,” Veldman said, laughing.) But all the members insisted they are doing this because they care about Brexit. Pablo Ramos, 25, the band’s best dancer and a hotel receptionist in Amsterdam, said he had been able to move to the Netherlands from Spain only because European Union citizens have the right to live and work in any member country. “Why make a limit, a border between us?” he said. The Breunion Boys have only two original songs. (The second, “The Real Deal,” features lyrics like, “Oh, the treaties we have together / No one’s going to treat you better.”) But more songs will emerge as Brexit unfolds, Veldman said. She wants the band to sing about the potential return of a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, but is concerned about getting the right tone. At the Liverpool show, it was clear that even if the Breunion Boys cannot change the course of Brexit, their efforts were entertaining people. Within two songs, more than half the audience had moved near the stage. Most were swaying — and laughing — along. Between numbers, the band asked the audience how they felt about Brexit. A student, who said he was originally from Germany, looked as if he were about to cry when he said he feared having to leave Britain. The boys jumped down from the stage and hugged him; the audience sighed. But the biggest cheer came a few minutes later, as the group finished “Britain Come Back.” It came just after Hosseini lifted his top and pointed to his abs. "
5ca751b949f0eacbf1f81266,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/05/arts/music/avicii-tim-bergling-new-music.html,"STOCKHOLM — For the last six months, the music producer Carl Falk has been venturing into his dark and cloistered recording studio in central Stockholm to collaborate with a ghost. “I was trying to produce through someone else’s eyes and ears — someone who’s not here,” he said with vexed intensity, while sitting at his control board. “It was really hard not to criticize yourself the whole time. Would he like this? What would he have done?” The “he” Falk referred to — Tim Bergling, a.k.a. Avicii, the genre-redefining dance-pop songwriter and producer of global hits like “Levels” and “Wake Me Up” — died last April 20 at the age of 28 during a vacation in Muscat, Oman. A statement from his family at the time stated, “He could not go on,” and while they still decline to go into the details of his death, they are publicly acknowledging the death was a suicide. The family, still very much grieving, is also breaking its nearly yearlong silence with two announcements: the arrival of newly completed Avicii music and the formation of a charitable organization called the Tim Bergling Foundation that will support groups involved with mental health and suicide prevention. A full album, titled simply “Tim,” is due out in June, and its first track, “SOS,” arrives on April 10. “Tim,” which counts Falk among its core production and writing team, is not a posthumous collection of musical leftovers. Instead, it concentrates on songs the artist was far into writing and producing during the last three months of his life, songs which, his friends say, he very much wanted released. Together, the sounds and sentiments they offer represent a cohesive and striking leap ahead for a musician already known as one of the most impactful innovators in electronic pop of the last decade. “This was a different Tim,” said Falk. “A Tim that wanted to say something.” To illuminate the origins of Avicii’s final songs, and to speak more candidly about his suicide, his father sat for his first formal interview since his son’s death. Avicii’s oldest friends spoke, too, as did his most trusted songwriting and production partners in the studios where they have just completed work on the project. All 12 who spoke were in agreement about one thing above all: Not only did they not see Avicii’s death coming, they insisted that in the months before it happened, he was in the best spirits they had seen him in for well over a year. “He had so many plans,” said Lucas Von Bahder, a close friend since middle school. “There were things he wanted to do, places he was going to go.” Albin Nedler, a collaborator who was staying in Avicii’s Los Angeles home when he left on his trip, recalled his saying he was “ in a really good place.” Another creative partner, Vincent Pontare, communicated with Avicii when he was on the plane to Oman. “He was super excited,” he said. “We talked about doing the album after this.” Their testimony stands in dramatic contrast to the image of the star presented by the documentary “Avicii: True Stories,” which debuted on Netflix in Sweden directly after his death and in the United States this past December. The film, which friends say had the musician’s enthusiastic approval, portrayed an artist who seemed to be having a slow-motion nervous breakdown brought on by the relentless pressures of success and a brutal touring schedule. “My life is all about stress,” he says at one point in the film. “It will kill me.” The movie also chronicled Avicii’s struggles with alcohol, which led to an 11-day hospital stay in New York in 2012 for pancreatitis; in 2014, his gall bladder and appendix were removed. Afterward, doctors gave him pills for his pain, which he later said were grossly overprescribed. With an unflinching honesty that his friends considered one of his finest traits, Avicii spoke in the film about his social anxiety, lifelong shyness and profound discomfort with fame. “He worked way too much and looked too thin,” Pontare said about that period. “I said to myself, ‘What happened with him?’” Though the fast-rising star was at the peak of his career then, playing before hundreds of thousands of fans at gigs commanding $250,000 a night, the pressure, and milieu, of the hard-partying world of electronic dance music encouraged his most destructive habits. “It’s very easy to become too attached to partying,” he told Rolling Stone of that period. “You become lonely and get anxieties. It becomes toxic.” Worse, Von Bahder said, “the more famous he got, the more amplified his social anxiety got.” By the end of 2016, Avicii made a bold choice. He quit his highly lucrative touring career to concentrate solely on his greatest love: making music in the studio. Friends and associates say he quickly began to heal. In his adopted home of Los Angeles, he hired a personal trainer, started to meditate and began a writing renaissance. “He was looking super good,” noted Pontare. “We said, ‘the fire is back in him.’” At the same time, the lyrics he was writing in this fertile period had a dark side. They referred repeatedly to “fading away,” being “low down” and “broken.” They also angrily dismissed “the party life” — ironically, the very scene for which Avicii created one of recent pop’s most rousing soundtracks. For the new single, “SOS,” he wrote lines that Aloe Blacc, the vocalist on “Wake Me Up,” sings with special urgency: “Can you hear me, S.O.S./help me put my mind to rest.” None of the people who heard those lyrics at the time found special meaning in them. To confuse matters, darkness had been an element in Avicii’s music from the opening song on his debut album, “True.” “Wake Me Up,” a No. 1 smash in nine countries and a Top 5 hit in America, finds its narrator experiencing the precise inverse of the redemptive refrain from “Amazing Grace” — believing he’s found, only to discover that he is, in fact, lost. “Tim always mixed the dark and the light,” said Per Sundin, an executive at Universal Music, Nordic, who signed a deal with Avicii when the musician was still recording under the name Tim Berg. Hearing the new lyrics now, however, “You go, ‘Oh, is this a metaphor?’ You can interpret the songs in different ways.”  AVICII’S EARLIEST SONGS invited little such interpretation. As a teenager, he began his career by making simple beats on his own. But he developed quickly as a songwriter and, by 2010, created the fully melodic pop/dance gem “Seek Bromance,” a Top 15 hit in Britain. Things really ignited, however, after he took what some felt was a Dylan-goes-electric-style risk at the key electronic music festival Ultra in 2013, where he debuted “Wake Me Up,” which injected elements of folk and country into E.D.M., aided by live musicians. “First, it was shock, then people started booing,” said Johnny Tennander, Avicii’s publisher at Sony/ATV. The young crowd was more taken aback when Avicii brought out a co-songwriter, Mac Davis, who had written hits for Elvis Presley. “On the internet, the comments were ‘rest in peace, Avicii’s career,’” Sundin of Universal Music said. Later, the company tried to recover, and seed interest, by issuing a prerelease SoundCloud mix of the album, one bold enough to also include a song like “Hey Brother,” sung by the bluegrass star Dan Tyminski, and another penned by the avant-gardist Antony Hegarty (now Anohni). At that point, “People said, ‘hold up, this is something new,’” Tennander recalled. “He’s writing music history.” “True” hit No. 5 on the Billboard 200; its 2015 follow-up, “Stories,” reached No. 17. “Tim,” which will be Avicii’s third album, advances his legacy of exploration by embracing psychedelia, Arabian music, sounds of the Caribbean and more. The lyrics, too, show significant growth. “The album felt coherent and personal,” said Tennander. While the new music presents many new angles, the executives overseeing it insisted that they eschew the more commercial route of recruiting superstar guest stars to, instead, use only longtime Avicii collaborators, including Kristoffer Fogelmark and Nedler, Salem Al Fakir and Pontare. Even the top name involved, Chris Martin of Coldplay — who sang a new song that leaked last year, “Heaven” — had sung and helped write a 2015 Avicii track, “True Believer.” The second mandate for the record was to keep as close to the demos the artist left as possible. One track planned for the album got pulled at the last minute because, Sundin said, “it had developed too far from Tim’s vision.” The producers say most songs were 75 to 80 percent done by the time of Avicii’s death. To fill in the rest, they relied on detailed notes he left on his phone and computer, some of which were written in his final days. It fell to Christopher Thordson, from the artist’s management team, to search all his devices for information. “He wrote very specific things about the music,” Thordson said. Conversations about what, if anything, they’d do with that information, and with the music, began among the executives mere days after the star’s death. They received an encouraging response from Avicii’s father, Klas Bergling, who controls the estate. “It should be released,” he said in our interview. “No question about it.”  BERGLING, 73, who ran a successful office supply business before retiring, and his wife, Anki Liden, a well-known actress in Sweden, live in the same apartment they moved to when their musical son was 7. (He stayed there with them, and his three siblings, until his late teens.) Dotting their tastefully designed home are pictures of their youngest son, mostly childhood scenes at the beach. In the kitchen there’s a handsome portrait of a serious-looking Avicii that was used at his memorial gathering; his mother has tempered the intensity of the photo by placing in front of it a snapshot of him smiling widely while playing music with Nile Rodgers. Standing in the kitchen, his mother indicated the shirt, pants and watch she was wearing. “Tim, Tim, Tim,” she said, pointing to each in succession. “They were his. He’s with me.” In the living room, Bergling sat under a giant painting of Stockholm created by his father, who had designed sets for the city’s opera, including one production directed by Ingmar Bergman. He spoke slowly and intently, staring down at the floor for long periods, meeting a reporter’s eye only when he finished speaking. He described his son as very shy growing up, a deep thinker who felt comfortable socially only with his closest friends. They spent countless hours in this apartment playing video games and watching the “The Lord of the Rings” film series and “Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me.” Music came to him later, as a midteen, after his blues-loving, guitar-playing father gave him a guitar of his own. “Tim advanced quickly from my quality,” Bergling said with a smile. His skill at computer games fed into a passion for creating sounds on music programs. After a few years of honing his style, he adopted the stage name Avicii, from a Buddhist term for a realm of hell. “It sounded tough,” Bergling said. “That’s super for a teenager.” As his son’s career progressed, and then exploded, Bergling noticed in Avicii an increasing stage fright, though he loved that his music was being received so resoundingly. Bergling feels the documentary portrait of his son as troubled captured much of the truth from that period, but he believes the timing of the film’s wider release, so close to Avicii’s death, left people unaware of the happier, final phase of his life, after he got off the road. Which leads to a difficult question: Why, 16 months into a brighter phase of his life, did Avicii end it? Bergling said flatly that he does not know. “There is no letter,” he said. He likened his son’s death to “an accident on the motor road” with “several cars.” “Nothing points in the direction that he was planning it.” He would not talk about the method of his son’s death. “It’s not even a year since it happened,” he said. “The family is very traumatized. We want peace.” To help achieve it, he and his wife take “Tim timeouts” from dwelling on their grief. “It sounds a bit military, but you have to be military to handle this,” he said. “We are very vulnerable.” He said it helps, as well, to speak the word “suicide,” something he could not do before. “I use the word as often as I remember to use it,” he said. “I have to get used to the word.” The next day, three of Avicii’s closest friends gathered to offer their own memories. They visited the middle school where they all met, pointing out where they used to sneak cigarettes and alcohol. They talked, too, about the computer games that obsessed them. “We were nerds,” Von Bahder said. “We went into music to interest girls. It didn’t work.” Strolling the neighborhood, the friends advanced to Ciao Ciao Grande, a favorite spot for pizzas over the years. Directly across the street from their table lies the musician’s final resting place. “He didn’t have far to go,” Von Bahder joked. It’s on the grounds of Hedvig Eleonora Church, where the name Tim Bergling appears on a plain plaque not much bigger than a playing card, one of 48 such demarcations on a grid hung on a wall. The star’s exact burial spot isn’t indicated, to stress modesty and to maintain privacy. “It’s very Tim,” Frederik Boberg, another friend, said. The friends didn’t linger long. In that same vein, they have chosen not to speculate much on the motivations behind his death. And while they’ve heard the new lyrics, they’re loath to look too closely at them for clues. Falk, on the other hand, remains haunted by them. “Now, when I listen, I hear a lonely person with a lot of big emotions that he didn’t have enough people to talk to about,” he said. “I feel this music was his way of getting some of that out. That makes this a really important record. Whatever Tim wanted to say is here.” "

He started out as a fan of my music, and I was a fan, too, because I loved ‘Nashville.’ We came to each other with mutual respect.” She continued: “Not to be morose, but my mother passed away, I got a divorce and my life kind of fell apart. And then I began seeing Will, and right off the bat it was good.” Living together has been similarly fine. “Wunderbar,” you might say, to quote one of Mr. Chase’s numbers from “Kiss Me Kate.”  Soon after getting together in 2015, the couple moved into a three-floor spread in a rental building in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn. And perhaps as a nod to Ms. Michaelson’s obsession with the Yuletide season — don’t get her going on her musical Christmas clock, a gift from Hallmark — they quickly planted a dozen evergreens on one of the apartment’s two terraces. Ms. Michaelson’s brother, Charlie, and his wife and toddler daughter are right upstairs, in the building’s only other unit. “Ingrid and her brother are very tight, and we get to see them every day, which is a plus of being here,” Mr. Chase said. “And we’re the insta-babysitters.” Keeping to the all-in-the-family theme, one of Mr. Chase’s daughters from his first marriage has lately been in residence as well, on a gap year before starting college. Occupations: He’s an actor; she’s a pop composer and singer who did a stint on Broadway as a replacement in “Natasha, Pierre & the Great Comet of 1812.” Getting away from it all: “I know a lot of theater people say this, but I like living tucked away from the theater district,” Mr. Chase said. “It’s very familial in Brooklyn. I like to be here and veg.” Ms. Michaelson has taken the lead in outfitting the apartment. This is partly because she is hip, Mr. Chase said, and knows that a certain object “will look great in the place by the thing, which I just can’t visualize.”  And it is partly because she had many pieces to contribute, several from the Victorian house in Nyack, N.Y., that she owned with her former husband: bedside lamps, side tables, chests, a mirror and a dining table that she adored but worried might be too big for the space.  “We just measured it,” she said. “It’s 82 inches and I’m like, ‘Should we get a smaller table?’ But I do love it.” But really, it comes down to this: Ms. Michaelson has her stuff, and she loves her stuff. Mr. Chase is not a material guy. He accumulates little and cares less, although he is very tender on the subject of the vinyl classical records he inherited from Ms. Michaelson’s father. “I’m like, ‘Don’t you want to keep that chair or whatever from your family?’ And he’s like, ‘Not really.’ Will’s very easygoing. I admire that he doesn’t get sentimental about too many objects,” Ms. Michaelson said. “I, on the other hand, hold on to things,” she added, pointing to the chest from her family’s Staten Island house that held her childhood arts and crafts supplies, and to two spindle-backed antique chairs, the sole survivors of a set that belonged to her grandmother. When Ms. Michaelson does let something go, she tries very hard to avoid regret. This is not always possible. It was absolutely not possible in the case of the antique egg incubator she bought at the Brooklyn shop Sterling Place.  “It was my first big furniture purchase, and it cost $500,” she said. “I used it as a side table, but it was really too big for a side table and too small for anything else. So I ended up selling it.” She added: “I still think about it.” “Note to self: Christmas present,” her boyfriend said. Whatever his indifference to how his space is filled, Mr. Chase would prefer that the space be big. Never mind that more often than not he and Ms. Michaelson can be found nestled on the very puffy sectional in a corner of the living room watching “Game of Thrones.”  He likes room to roam. He’s got it. The living room — heavy on the wood and earth tones, and heavily dependent on Restoration Hardware and West Elm — is cozy and welcoming, but betrays nothing about the professional lives of the inhabitants. All is revealed in the studio/office where, surrounded by family photos and theater posters and caricatures, Mr. Chase memorizes his lines and Ms. Michaelson writes. (She is working on the score for a musical adaptation of “The Notebook.”) “It’s kind of our accomplishments in here, mixed with bizarre things,” she said.  Bizarre: the lion’s head she bought at a rest stop while on tour. Bizarre (but sweet): the Grimace sponge she bought for Mr. Chase on eBay.  The accomplishments include Mr. Chase’s Tony Award nomination certificate (for his performance in the 2012 revival of “The Mystery of Edwin Drood”) and Ms. Michaelson’s two platinum singles (for 2007’s “The Way I Am” and 2014’s “Girls Chase Boys”). “But it’s not ‘Look at us.’ It’s not, like, showcasing us,” Mr. Chase insisted. “And then we joke, ‘It’s not like we have that many awards.’” For weekly email updates on residential real estate news, sign up here.

Its resulting legacy has been mixed — from slickly produced multiday affairs to unmitigated disasters, like the Fyre Festival — but the wildfire-spread of festivals since has led to an increasing number of exciting, smaller-scale events organized each year.  These eight U.S.-based music festivals are notable for their stunning settings, extracurricular programming and highly curated, alternative lineups. Marfa Myths is a collaboration between Ballroom Marfa, a nonprofit cultural arts space, and the Brooklyn-based record label Mexican Summer. Since it began four years ago, in a West Texas town internationally recognized for its art and culture, Marfa Myths has showcased a diverse roster of under-the-radar talent. Expect the same this year, with acts like Khruangbin and Cass McCombs. And don’t miss the art exhibitions around town. PRO TIP “Bring boots, and hydrate!” advises Sarah Melendez, the Ballroom Marfa program director. Booking accommodations and meal reservations in advance is a must, too. April 25-28 in Marfa, Tex. $220 for an all-access pass; tickets available for individual shows $15-$55 “Everyone is a creative,” is the philosophy of FORM, to be held for its sixth year in Arcosanti, in Arizona, an “urban laboratory” established in the 1970s. FORM utilizes the striking desert landscape in programming its weekend full of music, poetry, wellness and advocacy. Musical acts including Anderson .Paak and Florence and the Machine play in Arcosanti’s intimate outdoor amphitheater. Enjoy the workshops and the music; relaxing by the pool is an option too. EQUAL ACCESS This festival offers different levels of camping, from D.I.Y. tent sites to all-inclusive glamping. But those differences stop at accommodations; No V.I.P. sections or access are available otherwise. May 10-12 in Arcosanti, Az. $379 for a weekend pass, basic camping included; glamping add-ons start at $349 It’s the 10th anniversary of this scrappy festival organized by Gundlach Bundschu winery, Eric D. Johnson of the Fruit Bats and FolkYeah!, a Northern California music promoter. Held on the winery grounds, Huichica keeps attendance tight — just 600-800 people are there at any given time. (No worries: Additional festivals are planned later this year for the Hudson Valley and Washington state). Musical highlights this year include Love, Kelly Stoltz, and Lee Fields and the Expressions. It’s an intimate environment: Expect to see musicians watching the show, not hiding out backstage. KIDS WELCOMED While Huichica is not a children’s festival, it’s decidedly family-friendly, with a dedicated kid zone that makes it easy for parents to start them young. June 7-8 in Sonoma, Calif. From $155 for a weekend pass; children under 12 attend free Wilco lovers unite at this festival highlighting Jeff Tweedy and company’s current musical favorites. This year, Courtney Barnett, The Feelies and Tortoise will join Wilco, plus band members’ solo work. The musical performances are integrated within Mass MoCA’s expansive grounds and contemporary art collection. Not into art? Festival goers can attend an axe-throwing workshop, or for a more sedate activity, attend a panel featuring Jon Hamm and John Hodgman. EARLY BIRD GETS THE ART Attendees are advised to arrive before the shows to best explore the museum; you’ll be better equipped to seek out last-minute musician pop-ups, which are often announced on Twitter. June 28-30 in North Adams, Mass. From $189 for a weekend pass; day passes from $74-$129 With a zero-waste ethos, the Pickathon festival combines art, architecture, food and music. Its Treeline Stage is designed annually by architecture students using sustainable materials (last year’s stage was later used to build homeless shelters). This year, the lineup includes Nathaniel Rateliff and the Night Sweats, Phil Lesh, and The Preservation Hall Jazz Band, and will be bracketed by morning yoga, late-night dance parties and a street art showcase. EAT UP Join a Curation Series dinner, a communal, sit-down dinner party for 100 that pairs cuisine from top Pacific Northwest chefs and live music (tickets on sale in April). Aug. 2-4 in Happy Valley, Ore. From $325 for an adult weekend pass; early entry add-on for $90 The interactive artists’ collective Meow Wolf organized Taos Vortex last year to bring mind-bending art installations and musical performances to Kit Carson Park, walking distance from downtown Taos. Year two boasts more acts reflecting New Mexico’s diverse population (the full lineup will be announced April 2) and no shortage of art you can touch. Camping is available for 1,000 (out of 6,000 expected attendees) and Max Beck-Keller of Meow Wolf encourages all to “inhabit the space, make it your home.” ADVENTURE TIME To highlight the beauty of Taos, the festival organizes outdoor adventures including balloon rides and paddle boarding on the Rio Grande.  Aug. 16-18 in Taos, N.M. From $199 for a three-day pass with camping, $179 without; day passes from $79 Afropunk Brooklyn is entering its 20th year celebrating black culture. With a musical lineup ranging from jazz to hard-core hip-hop, the two-day festival also boasts the Spinthrift Market, a destination for art, fashion and hair products, plus the live Solutions Sessions talks featuring likes of Ava Duvernay and Terence Nance. Despite having grown in scope and size — the weekend sees 60,000 attendees — the co-founder Matthew Morgan notes that positive vibes have persisted. STRAIGHT FROM THE LOWER LATITUDES Expect to hear acts from Johannesburg and other areas of South Africa thanks to an Afropunk expansion into that country. Aug. 24-25 in Brooklyn. From $110 for a weekend pass; from $60 for single day According to the co-founder Melissa Auf der Maur, the eclectic nature of Soundscape (which can range “from grindcore to poetry”) is largely dictated by the venue. A factory turned art space, Basilica Hudson offers a striking canvas for Soundscape’s blend of music, visual art and readings. The venue and the limited crowd (capped at 1,200 people) are meant to capture the feeling of musical and artistic discovery in a pre-Internet age. UPSTATE OF MIND Attendees are encouraged to take the train (book early) and leave room for exploring Hudson. The Half Moon, a local bar, hosts a festival after-party each night. Sept. 13-15 in Hudson, N.Y. From $80 for a weekend pass "
5c89321c49f0eacbf105cdb0,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/13/arts/music/french-british-hip-hop-afrobeats-afrotrap.html,"LONDON — Britain can be an insular place. A parlor game here involves trying to list as many famous Belgians as possible, on the basis that few people know any. An equivalent exercise with French rappers would be even tougher. France is one of the world’s largest rap music markets, but its neighbor on the other side of the English Channel pays little attention. The lack of interest is reciprocated. French rap is full of borrowed English words: The F-bomb is often detonated in lyrics, especially in “le rap hard-core.” But the prevailing influence is American; British rappers struggle to command attention. Stormzy, probably Britain’s highest-profile M.C., topped the British charts when he released his debut album in 2017. In France, he did not even make the top 200. Can the differences between these opposing citadels of European rap be bridged? The answer lies not just in Britain and France, but also in Europe’s former colonies in Africa. West and Central Africa contain numerous English- and French-speaking nations that reflect the presence of Britain, France and Belgium as colonial powers until the 1960s. Imported styles of pop music from sub-Saharan Africa have been adopted and transformed by British and French musicians who have roots there. Omo Frenchie is a London-based rapper who toggles between English and French in his songs. “Rapping in French is a lot harder,” he said in a telephone interview. “It’s the language and the pronunciation. In French, they’ll go the long way around saying even simple things. But the good thing is that when you do find a nice line, it sounds amazing.” Frenchie, who would not give his real name or age, is actually a trilingual performer. He also uses Lingala, one of the languages of the Democratic Republic of Congo, a country that emerged from Belgian colonial rule in 1960. Frenchie was born there but moved to London with his family as a baby. The first time he used French and Lingala in a song was in 2013. The occasion was a guest appearance on a track by the musician Afro B, another Londoner with a Francophone African background. After it came out, Frenchie noticed a surge of interest on Twitter, with people asking: Who’s this guy that’s speaking French? “From then on, I knew that that was my niche,” Frenchie said. He is not alone. Yxng Bane (pronounced Young Bane) is an up-and-coming rapper from London with a clutch of British chart hits under his belt. Like Frenchie, he has Congolese ancestry. The 22-year-old, real name Larry Kiala, grew up speaking English and French at home, before later learning Lingala. Last year, he teamed up with a French rapper called Franglish for the song “Makasi,” which was recorded in Paris. His linkup with Franglish — a hybrid name to strike fear in the hearts of the Académie Française, the zealous gatekeepers of the French language — was forged through their shared African heritage. The French rapper also has a Congolese family background (“makasi” is the Lingala word for “strong”). Their collaboration illustrates the growing influence of African music on British and French rap. The shift is partly driven by demographic change. The proportion of Britons from a black African background doubled between 2001 and 2011, when the last national census took place. (France does not record the ethnicity of its citizens.) The strong influence of African music on British rap derives from the popularity of Afrobeats, a blend of West African, Caribbean and American urban music, which originated in the 2000s in Nigeria and Ghana, former British colonies. It crossed over into British urban music in the early 2010s. The first Afrobeats hit in Britain’s top 10 came in 2012 with D’Banj’s “Oliver Twist.” (The song’s video featured Kanye West, who signed D’Banj to his record label.) Since then, numerous variants have sprung up, a dizzying profusion of subgenres with names like Afroswing and Afrobashment. The proliferation is partly a fad. “I feel like if you’re going to put the word Afro in it, there has to be that African element,” Omo Frenchie said. “A lot of it is watered down,” he added. “It deserves a little bit more.” But the overall hybrid style, moving easily between Chicago drill, Drake’s sing-rapping, Caribbean dance hall and West African urban pop, is more than a trend. It has taken root in the mainstream as a newly dominant mode of urban music in Britain. Its geographically profuse sound is epitomized by a rising star of British rap, Octavian, who was born in France to African parents before moving to London as a child. The equivalent genre across the Channel is Afrotrap. It was pioneered by MHD, a musician from Paris who is one of the best-known rappers in France. He created Afrotrap in 2015 when he posted a video of himself on social media freestyling a rap over a song by the Nigerian Afrobeats band P-Square. Last year, he became the first French rapper to play the Coachella festival in California. But MHD’s career hangs in the balance. In January, he was arrested on charges relating to a man’s violent death in Paris. MHD denies any involvement. Nonetheless, the genre that he created has become embedded in French hip-hop. The rapper Niska drew on Afrotrap in his album “Commando,” the No. 3 most-streamed album in France in 2017. In an email exchange before his arrest in December, MHD, 24, whose real name is Mohamed Sylla, said that his ambition was “to export my music to an international audience.” “In France, this kind of mixture was new,” he said, referring to Afrotrap. He felt an affinity, he added, with his British peers: “The English have this ability to mix things up and fuse genres. They are lucky to have a public that is hyper-open to these blended sounds.” Afrotrap draws on Coupé-Décalé, a dance music style from the Ivory Coast. It is harder and faster than the British Afrobeats and its offshoots. “The African music sound in France is different,” Frenchie said. “No one in the U.K. has jumped on a beat like that. It’s predominantly an African sequence.” But there are areas of overlap as well as divergence. MHD has bolstered his profile in English-speaking markets by collaborating with Afrobeats singers such as the Nigerian star Wizkid. Last year, he played shows in London. Niska followed in his footsteps in February. Traffic across the English Channel is building in volume. “I feel like there’s a big wave with the Afrotrap music coming from France,” Yxng Bane said. “I feel that it’s getting highly recognized.” And his own efforts at an Anglo-French rapprochement in rap will continue, he added. “Just keep your eyes open,” Yxng Bane said. “Got some more Francophone for them. It’s coming, it’s coming.” "
5c86b05d49f0eacbf105c7a7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/11/arts/music/carnegie-hall-vienna-philharmonic.html,"Say the phrase “classical music” and many will imagine a renowned symphony orchestra playing masterpieces of the distant past at Carnegie Hall. Last week, you could live that fantasy again and again at Carnegie, probably the most famous concert space in the world. The Vienna Philharmonic played towering works by Mozart, Beethoven, Brahms and Mahler over four programs. The Philadelphia Orchestra played Schubert’s Ninth Symphony. But music is about more than big symphonies, and it’s about more than the past. I went to nine concerts over seven days at Carnegie, a dizzying musical marathon, and it was a concentrated reminder that what is special about this art form is its variety — its intimacy and its grandeur, its capacity to draw inspiration from the past yet speak to the present. How to foster new music, support emerging composers and connect classical music — that inadequate term — to today, while also maintaining the legacy of major ensembles performing the great works of the past? And how to preserve that legacy? Faithfully honor historical performance styles? Jolt timeless scores with new approaches? Last week was just a random one at the hall, but it showed how Carnegie manages to engage all sides of these debates — the vast sprawl of the classical field in the 21st century — better than almost anywhere else. The hall’s three spaces make this range of repertory and experience possible. Sleek and modern Zankel Hall, down in the basement, hosted the premiere of a powerful multimedia piece dealing with racial profiling and a prison system that inordinately targets young African-American men. Zankel was small enough for the Chiaroscuro Quartet’s period instruments and mellow gut strings to be heard in a lean, dusky-toned account of Schubert’s “Death and the Maiden.” Snug, politely classic-looking Weill Recital Hall practically vibrated from the hip French harpsichordist Jean Rondeau’s concert, a walk on the wilder side of Bach and Scarlatti, while the master pianist Andras Schiff played Janacek and Schumann in the main auditorium. A single piano on that huge stage remains one of the most dramatic images in music. The tension between innovation and tradition was on display during the Vienna Philharmonic’s first program, on March 2, when Adam Fischer led a robust, majestic account of Beethoven’s “Eroica” Symphony. As always, you could bask in this magnificent orchestra’s resplendent sound — the warmth and body of the strings, the reedy tang of the woodwinds, the dark richness of the brass. Even during intense passages, the transparency of the playing was marvelous. Yet, for all its splendors, there was a slightly self-important quality to the performance that kept me a little distant, as if the orchestra was claiming ownership of a work from the glory days of Viennese classicism and showing an American audience how it’s played at home. That the Vienna Philharmonic, so beholden to tradition, can discover Beethoven anew was triumphantly proved a few nights later, when the pianist Igor Levit was the soloist in the Third Piano Concerto, with Michael Tilson Thomas conducting. In Mr. Levit’s hands, a probing performance can seem excitingly dangerous. A telling example was the extended development section of the first movement. This episode, lasting a few minutes, is marked to be played softly. At first, the movement’s stern main theme is recalled by the piano — but mysteriously, quietly, in octaves. Then, supported by the orchestra, the piano elongates the theme and takes exploratory excursions into genial-sounding passages of spiraling triples. But there was nothing genial about Mr. Levit’s approach. He played the whole episode not just softly, but as if whispered. Crucial notes were given just enough extra nudge to make them startling. The music-making was ruminative yet purposeful, unsettling yet assured. The next evening, Mr. Thomas led Mahler’s 85-minute Ninth Symphony, a work given its premiere in 1912 by, yes, the Vienna Philharmonic. As a musician who revels in the stylistic melting pot that is American musical culture, Mr. Thomas embraced the deliberate mix of the sublime and the banal, the hints of church chorales and country dances that run though Mahler’s symphonies, especially the Rondo-Burleske movement of this one. Yet he also conveyed the elaborate structure of the score. Here was a performance that drew upon the orchestra’s great heritage while pushing it to take risks. On Thursday, alas, I had to leave Mr. Rondeau’s recital early to make it to Mr. Schiff’s concert downstairs. Mr. Rondeau, with his long hair, scraggly beard and rumpled shirt, exuded wild-eyed charisma and channeled it into his performance. Dispatching Baroque passagework with impeccable clarity, even at breakneck tempos, he brought improvisational flair to his playing — he also plays jazz — especially an impetuous account of Bach’s Fantasia in C minor. It was a different mood in the main auditorium, where Mr. Schiff, wearing a three-piece suit, looked every bit the distinguished master as he bowed to the audience. Once he began Janacek’s episodic suite “On the Overgrown Path,” he played with searching insight, rhapsodic freedom and uncompromising musical integrity. And talk about bringing freshness to familiar repertory: The immensely gifted pianist Jan Lisiecki practically kick-started Mendelssohn’s youthful Piano Concerto in G minor into action on Friday with the Philadelphia Orchestra, led by Yannick Nézet-Séguin. But it was the raw, cry from the soul new work, “The Just and the Blind,” that has stayed with me from my marathon. Part of Carnegie’s 125 Commissions Project, begun in honor of the hall’s 125th birthday in 2016, it’s a 60-minute piece by the spoken-word poet Marc Bamuthi Joseph, with music by Daniel Bernard Roumain. Though it includes a dancer (Drew Dollaz), a vocalist (Somi) and projected animations and videos, the work is driven by Mr. Joseph’s stinging, brilliant words and is structured as a series of vignettes. Mr. Joseph voices the thoughts of a black father who admits to being afraid when, at night, he walks past young black men who look the same age as his son. Every day, he tells his son, the boy’s main mission in life is “to come home to me.” Stretches of Mr. Roumain’s score, which he mostly plays on piano and violin, are alternately jazzy and modernist. A rhythmically frenetic section will segue into a breezily cool passage. But Mr. Roumain knows when to pull the music back so Mr. Joseph’s searing words can do their work. Is this classical music? Perhaps not by traditional definitions. But it speaks to where Carnegie has come that it fit in at the hall just as well as the Vienna Philharmonic. "
5c44bc753a125f5075c05659,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/20/arts/music/review-esa-pekka-salonen-san-francisco.html,"SAN FRANCISCO — After leading his first concert as the San Francisco Symphony’s next music director here on Friday, Esa-Pekka Salonen said he had some advice for young conductors. His feet wrapped in impossibly glossy black leather as he spoke in a talkback interview on stage, he almost audibly winced: “Don’t conduct a concert in new shoes.” Even a veteran like Mr. Salonen, 60, couldn’t resist dressing up for the first day of school. The announcement last month that he would be this ensemble’s next conductor has been the talk of the music world, both because Mr. Salonen is one of the field’s only universally admired figures and because no one thought that he was in the market for a new job. Indeed, leaving in 2009 after 17 years as music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, he kept wriggling out when orchestras approached him, saying he wanted time to compose. I and many others hoped he would succeed Alan Gilbert at the New York Philharmonic a couple of years ago; it didn’t pan out. What did, and do, we see in him? Both a steward of music’s traditions and an explorer of the future. A vibrant interpreter of the music of others and a creator of his own. An artist who can star more than plausibly in an Apple commercial without seeming a sellout — one who’s thoughtful, even analytical, without ever seeming to try too hard. Almost no one else in classical music so completely satisfies our polarized demands for old and new, innovation and tradition, head and heart. As Mr. Salonen prepared to leave Los Angeles, Alex Ross wrote in The New Yorker that he’d become “a fixed point of cerebral cool in a city of spectacle and flux.” But if his persona has a certain wry distance to it, there is heat in his presence on the podium, and in his effect on orchestras. His connection to the San Francisco Symphony seemed close, confident and charged on Friday, just his fourth time leading the ensemble. (Classical marriages can be shotgun.) If his feet were bothering him, there was no betraying it in the music-making. That he was able to come here for a visit so soon after the announcement last month was happenstance. This weekend of concerts at Davies Symphony Hall was supposed to be conducted by Mirga Grazinyte-Tyla, who has canceled a spread of dates this season (including her debut with the New York Philharmonic) after giving birth in August. Mr. Salonen, who happened to be free, kept the second half of her program — Sibelius’s “Four Legends from the Kalevala” — and preceded it with Anna Thorvaldsdottir’s “Metacosmos” and Strauss’s “Also Sprach Zarathustra.” The message was clear: No soloist; no concerto (Ms. Grazinyte-Tyla was to have conducted the pianist Gabriela Montero in Tchaikovsky’s First); just the orchestra and its next leader. The results had polish and energy. Michael Tilson Thomas, stepping down as music director here after 25 years, has built an ensemble that plays with clean, versatile shine. (It can feel, in its agreeably open versatility, not so far from the Los Angeles Philharmonic.) The San Francisco string sound, in particular, is glistening yet full-bodied, never hysterical but with a lovely glitter to the tone. Russ deLuna played the crucial English horn solo in Sibelius’s “Swan of Tuonela” movement with self-effacing eloquence. Indeed, solos throughout the concert were alert yet unshowy, always with a sense that the big picture was more important than stealing a star moment. Mr. Salonen conducted the premiere of “Metacosmos” in April with the New York Philharmonic, and it makes a clever companion to “Also Sprach Zarathustra.” Both begin with the same low growl — though, as Ms. Thorvaldsdottir’s orchestra begins to rouse itself into a Strauss-style fanfare, it dolefully falls apart. This cycle of expansion and collapse defines the piece; lush, even cinematic gestures are pulled at by sickly downward moans. This was a powerful, logical “Zarathustra,” lithe and bombast-avoidant in a thrillingly controlled opening and airy in the lilting passages later on. Mr. Salonen’s Sibelius was lean and fevered. This isn’t an orchestra that does spectacular soft atmosphere, but moments like the stillness of the second movement, “Lemminkäinen in Tuonela,” when the barest shiver of violins is frosted by the barest shiver of rat-a-tat drum, were finely controlled. It was a performance not of effects or jarring contrasts, but of sustained force and focus. The classical field is now waiting to see what Mr. Salonen will do in his career’s full maturity. He has announced a benevolent little think-tank army of artists who will be helping him, including Nico Muhly, Esperanza Spalding and Julia Bullock, and their plans will germinate through next year, as the orchestra turns to celebrating Mr. Thomas’s final season. There is room for a refresh here. Mr. Thomas gained a reputation for fostering overlooked 20th-century American works, but on the calendar in Friday’s playbill, listing the orchestra’s programs through March 9, there’s a whole lot of Beethoven, Schumann, Mendelssohn and Mozart, as there is throughout the country. Mr. Salonen’s innovations shouldn’t stop at concert programming. My hope is that he manages, as no one really has, to do even more with the American orchestra than smart repertory selections and commissions — that he makes it a clearinghouse of cultural and intellectual activities that extends beyond just music. As the loud reception for him on Friday shows, he has the audience behind him on this new adventure. "

Just want the music? Listen to the Playlist on Spotify here (or find our profile: nytimes). Like what you hear? Let us know at theplaylist@nytimes.com and sign up for our Louder newsletter, a once-a-week blast of our pop music coverage. The fuzztone is cranked way up on “Lo/Hi,” the first Black Keys song since 2014. It’s the kind of garage-boogie stomp that the band never left behind. Singing about desperate loneliness and 180-degree mood swings, the Black Keys reach back to a late-1960s combination of primordial three-chord simplicity (hinting at Norman Greenbaum’s “Spirit in the Sky”) and overdubs galore. Between the group handclaps, a gang of guitars and the whooping, wailing backup vocals, it’s a far cry from the early Black Keys’ two-man-band austerity — but with the old wallop intact. JON PARELES A folky waltz tells the story of an adolescent romance, deploying details with a concision akin to Paul Simon: “Morrissey apologists, amateur psychologists, serial monogamists, we went to different colleges.” There’s no happy ending, and Phoebe Bridgers’s production surrounds the acoustic guitars with distant, shadowy strings that hint at the song’s higher stakes. PARELES Lauren Mayberry, frontwoman of the Scottish band Chvrches, has a voice that’s tart, serrated and soaring — it cleanly pierces through everything around it. That makes it a sleek, albeit unexpected, complement to the production of Marshmello, whose music is restlessly and relentlessly dopey. On “Here With Me,” Mayberry is a beacon of reason, singing with ramrod posture while the song wiggles and wobbles behind her. JON CARAMANICA “And I haven’t lost my mind thinking about you/And I haven’t lost my breath shouting all the things we’re about to do,” sings Helado Negro — Roberto Carlos Lange — in “Pais Nublado” (“Clouded Nation”), a subdued bossa nova with an electronic penumbra from his new album “This Is How You Smile.” His songs are often bilingual in English and Spanish and built on electronic underpinnings, though “This Is How You Smile” welcomes acoustic guitar as well. The album muses on desire, Latinx identity, change and rhythm, hinting at places where history and politics have intimate repercussions. PARELES The drummer and composer Kendrick Scott will release an album next month titled “A Wall Becomes a Bridge,” featuring his long-running quintet Oracle (plus the turntablist Jahi Sundance on about half the tracks). Scott invests seriously in the ancient ideal of music as a healing force, and the notion that through focus and attunement, he might create sounds that resonate with our particular moment. He’s one of more consistent bandleaders in instrumental music today, with original music that feels consequential and distinguished in spite of its adherence to an airtight, contemporary-jazz aesthetic. With Joe Sanders on bass, Mike Moreno on guitar, Taylor Eigsti on Fender Rhodes and John Ellis on soprano saxophone, Oracle douses your ear in textures that are thick but aerodynamic, and on “‘>>>>>>>>>>>Mocean” Ellis’s liquid melody cuts against Scott’s constant patter, feeding the band two different kinds of fuel. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO Why wouldn’t the guitar on “Who Shot Cupid?” rest somewhere between flamenco, new age and early emo? Juice WRLD has become one of the most promising figures in hip-hop by almost completely dismantling the genre’s usual structures. That’s plain throughout his new album “Death Race for Love,” but the thickly layered moaning vocals on this song — “All the drugs I did, they weren’t worth it/now I'm worthless/I hope my new lady thinks I'm perfect” — show just how far Juice WRLD is able to bend hip-hop, turning it into something soft, interior and elegiac. CARAMANICA An album of newly unearthed recordings by the Texan songwriter Townes Van Zandt (1944-1997) rightfully makes “Sky Blue,” a previously unknown song, its title track. It’s a terse, low-fi, solo, fingerpicked glimpse of chronic despair: “No good reason to be livin’/Been lookin’ high and low,” he sings. PARELES In his decade-long country music career, Justin Moore has been rabble-rousing and retrograde, a stern guy and a goof. Finally, he’s found a song that captures both sides of his duality. “Jesus and Jack Daniels” is delivered with a smear of Randy Travis stoicism — mom parents via the good book, and dad via the bottle: “When we messed up she’d fill us up/with the scripture and a Baptist hymn/and she’d pray we’d be a little more like her and a whole lot less like him.” CARAMANICA The music is an elegantly melancholy bolero. But the words to “Temes” (“You Fear”) are a challenge, defying a machismo that pretends to be romantic but is actually about maintaining power, sometimes violently. “If my freedom is your dispossession/and my body is the recipient of your whim/If my shadow is behind your figure/Why do you fear me?” iLe (Ileana Mercedes Cabra Joglar) sings. And in the desolate video clip, she pulls herself together after a sexual assault. PARELES Backed by Soundwalk Collective, Patti Smith recites dire words by Antonin Artaud about how “A mortal folly comes over the world.” Her tone is steadfast, as if partaking in a ritual; she sings like a stoic lullaby when she reaches the lines, “Here where the mother eats her sons/Power eats Power: Short of war, no stability.” Around her, Sound Collective constructs a pyre of creaky, echoey fiddle lines and drumbeats that build to an apocalyptic rumble. PARELES Like many of Carla Bley’s melodies, the tune to “Ida Lupino” is a simple, songlike thread, snaking through a set of chord changes that gradually tweak the pressure around it, thickening the air and then letting things go slack again. On this version, by the young jazz combo Lioness, Amanda Monaco daubs at single notes on her guitar, painting little shapes around the alto saxophonist Alexa Tarantino’s dewy, unhurried treatment of the melody. Underneath, the drummer Allison Miller keeps a steady beat going, hardly deviating from her cool, eighth-note pattern, even when sparks momentarily start to fly. RUSSONELLO "
5c7ef21149f0eacbf105b800,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/05/obituaries/joseph-flummerfelt-dead.html,"Joseph Flummerfelt, the pre-eminent American choral conductor of his generation and a collaborator with some of the nation’s most renowned orchestras and maestros, died on Friday in Indianapolis. He was 82. The cause was a stroke, according to the Spoleto Festival U.S.A. in Charleston, S.C., where he was the director of choral activities for 37 years until retiring in 2013. Mr. Flummerfelt played an outsize, if not always highly visible, role in American classical music. He prepared choruses for hundreds of concerts by the New York Philharmonic and a host of other famous orchestras and maestros, and he trained generations of singers and conductors at Westminster Choir College in Princeton N.J. He often readied choirs behind the scenes, then handed them off to more famous conductors, who would lead them onstage for the final rehearsals and performances. He was the de facto chorus master of the New York Philharmonic for decades, preparing nearly 600 choral performances with the orchestra from 1971 through 2016. And when other top orchestras and conductors — a pantheon that included Claudio Abbado, Leonard Bernstein, Pierre Boulez, Carlo Maria Giulini and Riccardo Muti — needed choruses for their requiems, masses and choral symphonies, they often turned to Mr. Flummerfelt. Along the way, he became the best-known American choral conductor since Robert Shaw, the great chorus-builder and conductor, who had been a friend and mentor. Mr. Flummerfelt conducted the Westminster Choir, the larger Westminster Symphonic Choir and the New York Choral Artists, which he founded in 1979. His choirs were featured on some 45 recordings, several of which won Grammy Awards, including one of Mahler’s Symphony No. 3, conducted by Bernstein, and another of John Adams’s “On the Transmigration of Souls,” a work commissioned after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, with Lorin Maazel conducting the Philharmonic. Mr. Flummerfelt played key roles as well at the Spoleto Festival U.S.A. and the Festival dei Due Mondi in Spoleto, Italy. He often spoke of a need for flexibility in performance — warning that trying to “machine-in every detail” could “straitjacket” performers and stifle creativity. “At a certain point, you have to let go and trust that the technical aspects will hold,” he told his friend and former student Donald Nally, who became an esteemed choral conductor and teacher himself, for Mr. Nally’s book “Conversations With Joseph Flummerfelt: Thoughts on Conducting, Music, and Musicians” (2010). “You need to just let it sing and, in a very real sense, to let the performance evolve organically and spontaneously.” Joseph Ross Flummerfelt was born on Feb. 24, 1937, in Vincennes, Ind., where his father, John Ross Flummerfelt, was a funeral director and his mother, Mavorette (McGinnis) Flummerfelt, was a piano teacher. When he was about 5, he recalled, he came home from hearing her play the organ at the First Baptist Church, sat down at the family piano and picked out the hymn “Stand Up for Jesus” by ear. He had found music. His family bought its first record player when he was 12, and it came with a free recording of Handel’s “Messiah,” stirring in him dreams of conducting. “I remember spending hours in front of our living room mirror conducting that recording,” Mr. Flummerfelt was quoted as saying in Mr. Nally’s book. “Having seen only our local church choir and high school band directors at work (remember, this was before television), I didn’t really know what I was doing; yet responding to the music with some sort of gesture seemed to come naturally.” After graduating from DePauw University in Indiana, where he studied organ and church music, he studied under a number of influential figures, including Nadia Boulanger. It was his mentor Shaw who first sounded him out about going to teach at Westminster Choir College. Mr. Flummerfelt became a sought-after teacher and conductor at the college for 33 years. One of his summer students was a teenage Yannick Nézet-Séguin, who went on to become the music director of the Metropolitan Opera and the Philadelphia Orchestra. In 2009 Mr. Nézet-Séguin told The New York Times that his sessions with Mr. Flummerfelt had been the only significant conducting lessons he ever received. “Flummerfelt had a such a relaxed way of approaching the sound, with relaxed gestures and breathing,” Mr. Nézet-Séguin said. “Today I regard those things as my fundamentals, as much for orchestral work as for opera and choral music.” Mr. Nally, who conducts the Crossing, a Grammy-winning professional chamber choir in Philadelphia, and directs choral organizations at Northwestern University’s Bienen School of Music, said in a telephone interview, “The country is absolutely populated with people who studied with Joe.” At Westminster, Mr. Flummerfelt broadened its repertory and performance opportunities, said Joe Miller, who succeeded him. “He was kind of the artistic visionary behind the school,” Mr. Miller said by phone. (The college made headlines recently for another reason: It is being sold by Rider University to a Chinese company, but the sale is being challenged in court.) Mr. Flummerfelt was brought to the Spoleto festivals in Italy and then Charleston by their founder, the composer Gian Carlo Menotti. When Menotti left the Charleston festival in a dispute in 1993, he made it clear that any artist who continued to work there would not be welcome at his Italian festival. Mr. Flummerfelt became the only artistic leader to give up Italy’s Spoleto — and give up working with Menotti — so that he could remain in Charleston, said Nigel Redden, who later became general director of the American festival. “It is impossible to overemphasize how important that decision was to the preservation of Spoleto Festival U.S.A.,” Mr. Redden wrote in an email. Mr. Flummerfelt’s survivors include a brother, Kent, and two sisters, Pam Flummerfelt Rappaport and Carol Flummerfelt Helmling. In the Nally book of conversations, he spoke of the transcendent nature of conducting “I do long for those moments where everything is in place, where everything is flowing, and then the real truth comes from the source — whatever that is: God, the creative impulse, it doesn’t matter what you call it. And suddenly, things happen, which you couldn’t have planned. Real beauty is being created because all of the forces are perfectly lined up and a profound innermost connection is manifested.” "
5c3008a03a125f5075c02ef0,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/obituaries/pegi-young-dead.html,"Pegi Young, a late-blossoming folk-rock musician who was a founder of a school for children with severe physical and speech impairments, like her son from her marriage to the singer-songwriter Neil Young, a performer at its many star-studded benefit concerts, died on Tuesday in Mountain View, Calif. She was 66. Her brother Paul Morton said the cause was cancer. By the early 1980s, Ms. Young had grown frustrated with the special education programs available for her son, Ben, who was born with cerebral palsy in 1978. She began thinking about starting a school to better address his needs and those of other children who had largely lost the ability to speak. That inspiration led in 1987 to the Bridge School, an innovative institution in Hillsborough, Calif., that has since achieved global reach. Ms. Young founded it with the speech and language pathologist Marilyn Buzolich and Jim Forderer, who had adopted many special-needs children. At the school, about 17 miles south of San Francisco, children from ages 3 to 12 use augmentative and alternative communication techniques, including speech generators and manual communication boards, to help them articulate their thoughts and prepare to complete their educations in their local school districts. Vicki R. Casella, the executive director, said in a telephone interview that Ms. Young had a “determination to ensure that children like Ben have the opportunity to become active participants in their communities.” Dr. Buzolich added that Ms. Young’s experience as the parent of a child with special needs had been critical to the school. “Professionals often diss parental input, but the parent sees the whole child,” Dr. Buzolich said by telephone. “You can imagine the parents at the Bridge School saying to themselves, ‘She understands me, she knows what it’s like, she’s been there.’ ” The school runs an international teacher training program; implements its curriculum in developing countries; organizes conferences; and conducts research to measure the effectiveness of its educational strategies. “I take a tremendous amount of satisfaction with the knowledge that we’re changing lives for the better,” Ms. Young said in 2017 in an interview with AXS, a ticketing website. “It’s truly having a global impact.” The annual benefit concerts have been the source of much of the school’s funding. Over three decades, headliners have included Mr. Young, Bruce Springsteen, David Bowie, Emmylou Harris, Pearl Jam, the Who, Lucinda Williams and Metallica. The last concert was in 2016. Margaret Mary Morton was born on Dec. 1, 1952, in San Mateo, Calif. Her father, Thomas, was an investment manager. Her mother, Margaret Jean (Foley) Morton, was a homemaker and a hospital auxiliary volunteer. Pegi wrote poetry in high school and played guitar for pleasure, but she did not consider a career in music. She attended community colleges in Northern California but did not graduate. When she met Mr. Young, in 1974, she was working as a waitress near his ranch and living in a tepee with her dog. In his 1992 song “Unknown Legend,”  Mr. Young sang, “She used to work in a diner / Never saw a woman look finer / I used to order just to watch her float across the floor.” They married in 1978. She occasionally sang backup for Mr. Young, most notably at the 1994 Academy Awards telecast, when he sang his Oscar-nominated song, “Philadelphia.” But it was not until she was in her 50s that she recorded her first album, “Pegi Young” (2007). She followed it with four more. The most recent, “Raw” (2017) — credited, like the previous two, to Pegi Young and the Survivors — was in response to her divorce from Mr. Young in 2014. He had begun a relationship with the actress Daryl Hannah, and they married last year. In one song, “Why,” Ms. Young sings: “Why’d you have to ruin my life? Why’d you have to be so mean? Why’d you have to tell me such lies? Why not be straight with me?” After the album’s release, Ms. Young said on NPR that she hoped the songs could help people get through difficult life passages. “It could be, you know, late-in-life divorce,” she said. “It could be death.” She added, “Loss and heartbreak are pretty universal.” In his review of “Raw” in Glide magazine, Lee Zimmerman wrote, “With songwriting assistance from guitarist Kelvin Holly and Spooner Oldham, Young creates a stunning story line, one that taps into feelings that are both bitter and unbridled.” In addition to her son and her brother Paul, Ms. Young is survived by her daughter, Amber Jean Young; her stepson, Zeke Young; two grandchildren; her sisters, Sally Morton and Judith Davidson; two other brothers, Michael and Brian Morton; her stepsister, Mary Ann Wolkomir; and her stepbrother, Kevin Kleczka. Although she had found her way in music, Ms. Young nonetheless viewed the Bridge School as her life’s work. “Three or four of our students now have graduated from college,” she told Speakers in Code, a music website, in 2016, “and I’ve been to every one of their graduations with huge pride of a mother hen for seeing the success that these students have enjoyed — that once they have left Bridge, there is continuum of success.” Ben Young became a successful organic egg farmer. “You know when you buy eggs in a grocery store, and even when you buy them from a good organic source, you notice the yolks are kind of pale?” she said with pride. “Ben’s eggs are nuclear orange.” "
5c6d72033a125f5075c0a9bc,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/20/arts/music/marc-martel-queen-freddie-mercury-bohemian-rhapsody.html,"There are three things Marc Martel says he won’t do to impersonate Freddie Mercury. He won’t wear Mercury’s trademark yellow jacket. He won’t go onstage wielding Mercury’s favored half microphone stand. And he won’t grow a full mustache. Here’s the one thing Martel needs to do: open his mouth. Through genetics and musical aptitude, the 42-year-old singer is a vocal doppelgänger for the Queen frontman. That’s a gift that has led Martel, formerly the leader of a Christian band in Canada, to a lucrative second career in recent years — and a prominent but invisible role in “Bohemian Rhapsody,” the hit biopic nominated for five Academy Awards at the Oscars on Sunday. It’s not the life Martel planned, but it’s landed him on “American Idol” and in front of crowds of thousands worldwide. “I keep realizing how weird a situation I’m in,” Martel said in a phone interview. “I’m trying to keep a good head about it.” Rami Malek embodies Mercury onscreen, but as he told The New York Times last year, “No one wants to hear me sing.” During the performance sequences in “Bohemian Rhapsody,” the movie sometimes employs Mercury’s actual vocals from the Queen archives, but that wasn’t always practical — some scenes demanded a stunt vocal-cord performer. [Relive one of Freddie Mercury’s great moments: when Queen took “Bohemian Rhapsody” to Live Aid.] The film’s creators have conceded that the sung vocals in the movie are largely by Mercury and Martel, although they haven’t broken down the specifics of who contributed what; doing so might distract from Malek’s performance. Martel, who received a fleeting “additional vocals” billing, acknowledged that he worked on the movie, but citing his nondisclosure agreement, would not go into detail. That leaves him with a ghostly status much like that of Marni Nixon, who provided the singing voices both of Maria in the movie of “West Side Story” (for Natalie Wood) and Eliza in the movie of “My Fair Lady” (for Audrey Hepburn), without credit. Even though Martel doesn’t get the awards-show glamour that Malek is enjoying, he’s proud of his contributions to “Bohemian Rhapsody.” The first time he saw it wasn’t at a red-carpet event: He caught it in Cool Springs, Tenn., with his wife and manager, wearing “our comfy clothes.” He had wanted to enjoy the movie as a spectator, but “I couldn’t help waiting for the next scene where I was going to hear my own voice,” he said. So the Martels bought out a movie theater showing, invited 80 of their closest friends and treated it like a party. Martel grew up in Montreal listening to pop (George Michael was a favorite) and Christian music (his parents worked at a church as pastor and choir director). All he knew of Queen was the scene in the 1992 comedy “Wayne’s World” where the characters rock out to “Bohemian Rhapsody” in an AMC Pacer. He started a Christian rock band called Downhere with some friends in college; in 2001, they signed a record deal and moved to Nashville. He believes that the first person to tell him he sounded like Freddie Mercury was the Downhere bassist Glenn Lavender. It was a compliment, given how Mercury was one of the great singers in rock history, possessing a pellucid tone, a three-octave range and an operatic quality that could make even paeans to bicycle riding sound emotional. But Martel didn’t initially take it as praise. “That’s cool — I sound unoriginal,” he recalled thinking. But he checked out Queen’s greatest hits, hoping to learn something from Mercury (who died in 1991 of AIDS-related pneumonia): “I never thought it would amount to anything more than a fun karaoke trick.” In 2011, however, with Downhere having run its course after seven studio albums, Martel heard that the Queen drummer Roger Taylor was putting together an authorized tribute band called the Queen Extravaganza and won a spot on vocals with an audition video of “Somebody to Love” that went viral. Martel sounds close enough to Mercury that he can itemize the subtle differences: “I’m not British, so I don’t usually sing with an accent. I don’t have extra teeth like he did, so my Ss come out normally — his were very piercing,” he said. “But even if I don’t try to sing like Freddie Mercury, people still hear him in my voice, no matter what I do. I have this weird unique thing where I can sound like him, so why wouldn’t I?” Martel now steadily tours with his own Ultimate Queen Celebration and also does shows with the Black Jacket Symphony and Symphonic Queen. He said the Queen catalog has made him a better singer and inspired him to take better care of his voice — while he felt comfortable backing off a high note in one of his own songs when necessary, he doesn’t like to disappoint Queen fans who expect to hear a song the way they know it from the radio. Last year he released an album of Queen covers, “Thunderbolt & Lightning,” and his YouTube covers of Queen classics have become popular enough that he finds himself recognized in public — especially outside the United States, which was never the band’s biggest market. Martel, who has concerts booked in 14 countries this year, from Ukraine to New Zealand, notes that American crowds generally don’t know the arm movements and clapping that traditionally accompany “Radio Ga Ga,” while international audiences will do it unprompted. Although Queen has been a part of his life for nearly a decade, Martel is still figuring out “what being a tribute artist means,” he said. “For some reason, there’s a stigma around it.” A little defensively, he cited Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley and classical musicians as interpreters of other people’s work. Martel records an annual Christmas EP and still writes songs, but he doesn’t currently have an outlet for them; he dreams of a day when he can throw just one original into a set of Queen covers. He recalled a recent conversation with his manager, who told him, “I’d like you to consider your songwriting the way I view my golf game — I love playing golf, but it’s not what’s paying the bills right now.” That was hard for Martel to hear, but he ultimately accepted its wisdom. “The next five years, there’s going to be a lot of Queen,” he said, and chuckled. “But at the same time, I’m going to work on my golf game.” "
5c33ce4b3a125f5075c033be,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/07/arts/globalfest-world-music-copacabana.html,"They showed up in Mardi Gras headdresses, fedoras and tutus paired with combat boots. They drummed on darbukas, djembes and congas. And many of the performers at Sunday’s GlobalFest also brought grievances with them along with their costumes and instruments: against occupation, the erasure of indigenous voices, walls. GlobalFest, which took over the Copacabana nightclub near Times Square for the first time this year, is an annual showcase of music from all corners of the earth. This year 12 acts performed overlapping sets on three stages in what proved a joyful and often raucous celebration of diversity and culture’s uncanny knack for slipping through borders and stretching out roots underneath walls. As such, the festival is an inherent act of defiance against any attempt to cement hierarchies. At the same time, it complicates the notion of identity politics by demonstrating the composite nature of style. While the musicians’ art was always fueled by tradition, their distinct sounds were almost invariably shaped by the clash — or serendipitous kiss — of difference. Sometimes it was the fusion of geographically far-flung styles that yielded new musical alloys. Indian ragas took on a flirtatious shimmer in the hands of Debashish Bhattacharya, who infused them with strains of Flamenco and Hawaiian music and performed them on a new breed of Indian slide guitar of his own devising. The result was a heady mix of languid Polynesian sounds caffeinated by the rhythmic fireworks of the tabla of Subhasis Bhattacharya, Debashish’s brother. The members of 47Soul are drawn from the Palestinian diaspora, but the group’s musical roots reach even wider, encompassing Middle Eastern dabke drumming, fuzzy synth beats and reggae to eminently danceable effect. Politics are never far from the surface in lyrics that speak of dispossession and in the label — “Shamstep” — the band has given its music, which voices dreams of Arab unity across the Levant. In fact, new labels were often needed to capture new hybrids: “Southern Gothic.” “Freak cabaret.” “Afropsychedelic.” “Afrofuturist global bass” is how the members of Gato Preto describe their combustible blend of rap, funk and Senegalese drumming. The band is fronted by the explosively charismatic Gata Misteriosa, from Mozambique, who teamed up with the Ghanaian-German producer Lee Bass and Moussa Diallo, an incandescent djembe master from Senegal. Their set had a steamy carnival energy, with the relentless drive of the machine-made pulse amplified by heart-quickening flurries of live drumming. Pulses were also set racing by BCUC, a South African group that brings punk-rock energy and hypnotic rhythms to social activism, and by the Orquesta Akokán, a Cuban-American big band uniting dazzling talent and midcentury polish in simmering mambos. A very different spell was cast by Amythyst Kiah — a self-described “Southern Gothic” singer of “alt-country blues” — who gave a standout performance in the evening’s only solo act. Her razor-sharp guitar picking alone guarantees her a place among blues masters, but it’s her deep-hued voice that can change on a dime from brushed steel to melted toffee that commands attention. In performance she comes across as both uncompromising and generous. She introduced a song, the traditional “Darling Cora,” by pointing out its shared roots in English and West African folk. When she sang it, accompanying herself on banjo, the instrument’s dry warmth seemed to carry echoes of the African stringed kora. Jeremy Dutcher, a Canadian who is a member of a Wolastoq community in New Brunswick, showed that artistic dialogue can be just as fruitful when conducted, not across cultures, but between generations. Mr. Dutcher, who won the coveted Polaris Music Prize last year, draws on wax cylinder recordings from the early 1900s of songs in Wolastoqiyik — a language that is now in danger of extinction. His lyrical compositions layer the ghostly frayed voices of his ancestors with jazzy arpeggios on the piano, keening cellos lines and arching phrases sung in his own voice, which is powered by classical training and colored here and there by the tremor and guttural catch of traditional chant. Classical strains also filtered into the elegant set by Magos Herrera, a Mexican vocalist with a feline, smoky voice, who teamed with the string quartet Brooklyn Rider and the percussionist Mathias Kunzli for her new album “Dreamers.” Her songs are drawn from across Latin America, united by delight in melody and storytelling, supported by the string quartet as it seamlessly morphs from rhythm section to silver-screen swooning. And classical instruments appeared — and were sometimes abused — in what was perhaps the most extraordinary show of the evening. Dakh Daughters is born out of Kiev’s theater scene and features seven women who bring equal parts musical and theatrical chops to performances that are witty, subversive and brash. Dressed in tutus and combat boots with their faces painted white, the Daughters stalked the stage like conquerors taking possession of an alien territory. Texts (in Ukrainian, English and French) were delivered in shouts, hisses and yelps, with the voices sometimes coming together in exquisitely vocalized folk harmonies. Individually, the voices belonged to wildly disparate worlds including heavy metal, punk, and the glassy plangency of Balkan folk singing. They handled instruments like found objects: a violin propped against a hip, a cello tilted at a rakish angle. The bassist mostly drew sound from her instrument by spanking it; the drummer stomped the foot pedal of her bass drum as if it were vermin. A signature song of the Daughters is “Rozy/Donbass,” referring to a region contested by Russia, once known to Ukrainians for its rose gardens. It begins with a mournful setting of lines by Shakespeare delivered almost mechanically, with shouts of “Donbass” flung out with raw aggression. Eventually the music takes on a ritualistic whirl until it screeches to a halt with just the word “rozy” — roses — intoned as if by zombies. The song, like the Daughters’ performance, is darkly seductive and alienating at once — a powerful expression of the tensions endured by women in conflict zones, and a reminder that identity often means fighting on multiple battle lines.

5c8c237849f0eacbf105d5e4,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/15/arts/television/iggy-pop-punk-epix.html,"Over the years, the Michigan-born rocker James Osterberg Jr. — better known by his stage persona, Iggy Pop — has earned a reputation as “the Godfather of Punk.” This is thanks mostly to his tenure as the frontman of the proto-punk band the Stooges, but also because his reckless, sui generis stage presence embodied a gleeful but slightly scary abandon that became synonymous with the genre. His presence looms over “Punk,” a four-part documentary series about the fashion, politics and musical influences that defined punk rock, which debuted this week on Epix. Osterberg (credited as Iggy Pop) is an executive producer of the series, along with the fashion designer John Varvatos — which might raise eyebrows given that Varvatos put what some would say was the final nail in punk’s coffin in 2007 by buying CBGB, the hallowed punk club at 315 Bowery, and replacing it with one of his boutiques. In a phone interview, Osterberg defended Varvatos and also discussed the Sex Pistols, drugs and his favorite music critics. These are edited excerpts from that conversation. Punk, in its original form, was nothing if not iconoclastic. How do you feel when critics, fans or other musicians call you the “Godfather of Punk”? Once it gets into reverence, does that bother me? Yeah. I was, initially, but now I don’t mind being called “Godfather of Punk;” I suppose I’ve grown into the suit! There are occasional personal feelings that come from one-on-one interactions, when someone lets me know something genuine about the role that my work played in their life. When any type of music is still enjoying its vitality — that’s a social influence. And then, as people carry on that style and figure out how to further produce it, the style becomes academic, by really imperceptible steps. Even in country music: There is a hell of a big stretch going from Hank Williams to Garth Brooks, buddy! That process of change happens in all genres. Rock ‘n’ roll sort of took a beating and is now basically irrelevant, because it got mined to death. But whatever anybody wants to call me is O.K. I’ve been called worse things than the “Godfather of Punk”! You’ve said that the Sex Pistols were honest with their fans because they always told their fans that they shouldn’t be trusted.  I said “They always thought they were honest.” I don’t remember applauding anybody for saying “Don’t trust me.” I was much more impressed with their onstage ability than whether they were swindled out of thousands of dollars by their manager [Malcolm McLaren]. I just don’t care. But that doesn’t mean [McLaren] was not an effective Barnum-type showman. He was, you know? And that’s fine. The group, as a whole, had a lot of flair. Johnny Lydon is very good at the things you’re supposed to be good at when you front a group. And [the guitarist Steve Jones] was a really good foil for Johnny, especially when it came to doing publicity. Everybody contributed something musically, or in terms of image, to the group. In “Punk,” the deaths of the Sex Pistols bassist Sid Vicious and his girlfriend Nancy Spungen are presented as examples of how drugs essentially killed the punk movement. There was a lot of that stuff around the music business as I experienced it, as a punky type. And it was the hard stuff, so there was always a price to be paid. LSD and marijuana were the stuff being pushed in 1966 and 1967. And taking those drugs has a way of breaking down some barriers that people need to hold themselves together. But while those barriers are being broken down, you also get insights about life and the world around you, especially if you’ve grown up as a milk-fed American lamb to the slaughter, as we all were when we were told, “Go to Vietnam, but don’t ask why.” All that. Cocaine came in next. And it seemed like a good drug because, after a while, the weed and the LSD weren’t doing it anymore. Some people were getting into speed, but cocaine was a more upscale stimulant that, in effect, kept the party going. Eventually, people’s nerves were shot, their patience had worn thin, and many turned to opioid drugs, as well as Valium and other soporifics. Those are very subtle, dangerous drugs. Are there books or critics about either your music or punk music that you think are especially valuable? Lester Bangs and Nick Kent are two people I can think of, off the top of my head. Both of them, in sort of a flailing, wild, highly subjective way. But why not! At least the two of them were treating what they write about like it’s actually important. I read the stuff Lester Bangs wrote about me and thought: “Oh no, I’m a buffoon! But wait: I am a salient blowtorch of nihilism. Cool! Wait, am I cool or not? I’m not sure!” I have one of his books in hardback. I’ve had it for a long, long time. It’s sitting on the shelf along with “The Andy Warhol Diaries,” the collected works of Allen Ginsberg and a few other books. I look at their spines and think: “O.K., this is what’s important!” In “Punk,” you talk about your work without retrospectively judging yourself. What kind of questions were you asked and how did they make you feel? I knew and had worked for John Varvatos before I accepted both the interview and the fairly basic responsibilities that come with being listed as an executive producer. He loves and is genuinely interested in music. I once saw, in one of his stores, a book about the 100 greatest rock albums or something; at the time, I was modeling for him, so I was picking up some free swag. The book was thoughtful; it was a work of “soulful commerce,” I would say. So I knew that was where this show’s interview questions were going to be coming from. Like, there would inevitably be questions like: “So, you became a junkie … ” and that sort of thing. Whereas, a critic — who’s concerned with arcana and “pure art” — is going to have different questions. In those cases, you listen to the question and try to answer it inasmuch as it can be respected. And then you try to insert something of your own that has nothing to do with the question, so that you get in your own licks. You try to twist the thing over a little bit to your own point-of-view. What would you say to people who remain outraged that CBGB was turned into a Varvatos boutique? What would I say to people who think, “It all happened at CBGB, man”? There was something about that room that was conducive to a range of musical approaches that centered on a kind of detail-oriented, reference-oriented, intellectually-tinted art-rock. Like Talking Heads and many aspects of the Ramones, which was stylized in many ways. And Blondie, though that’s not as obvious in Blondie: [The lead singer Debbie Harry] seemed to learn how to sing out of nowhere. I don’t know how she could have done that without a club she could go to over and over while she was learning. And then Patti Smith’s group, obviously, even though I think “The Piss Factory” was recorded in the Nightingale. That was a little dive bar, smaller than CBGB, where they kept sawdust on the floor because people were going to puke, pee and spit, right? But she was also playing at CBGB, too. You could develop in that room. It was small in a particular way. "
5c9c7f5f49f0eacbf105f783,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/28/arts/music/hudson-yards-the-shed-arts-center.html,"On opening night at Lincoln Center, in 1962, Leonard Bernstein and the New York Philharmonic, joined by opera singers and a choir, performed music by Beethoven, Mahler, Copland and Vaughan Williams for an audience in tuxedos and gowns. The atmosphere should be decidedly more funky at the concerts that inaugurate the Shed, the 21st-century arts complex devoted to presenting new work, which is just two miles from Lincoln Center. Its first concert series, Soundtrack of America, will celebrate not the European classical sphere but the heritage of African-American music across a broad historical and stylistic spectrum, from spirituals to hip-hop. Most of the crowd will share a dance floor. It’s a statement of purpose, though it also promises to be a party. It signals that the Shed, a $475 million arts center within the Hudson Yards development of luxury retail, name-brand architecture and multimillion-dollar residences, will welcome cultural events and audiences well outside the economic elite. As with all of its programs, some tickets — spread across the room — will be only $10. “Because we’re starting from scratch, we’re trying to customize every decision to being inclusive,” said Alex Poots, the Shed’s artistic director and chief executive. He added: “We commission work across all platforms with parity between performing arts, visual arts and pop. They’re all equal, and there’s no poor relation either in terms of investment or in terms of space, in terms of facilities or in terms of brainpower.” Soundtrack of America, a five-concert series from April 5-14, is directed by the visual artist and film director Steve McQueen (“12 Years a Slave”) and will feature 25 up-and-coming musicians, five per night, playing roughly 15-minute sets. The performers’ mandate is to view the past from the present, placing songs of their own alongside music that influenced them. Their individual artistic paths are intended to add up to an expansive musical constellation. At first, Mr. McQueen said, he had imagined presenting an orderly linear musical progression, from the African rhythms that survived in Congo Square in New Orleans to the present. But America’s musical history made him reconsider. “It’s not linear,” he said. “It goes back on itself, it goes left, and it goes right. Is the wind linear? Sometimes it blows back and forth. It’s like a garden more than anything else. Things are sprouting up all over the place.” The opening-night roster includes Jon Batiste, the bandleader for “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert,” and PJ Morton, the Grammy-winning keyboardist from Maroon 5; other nights feature the rapper Smino; the Grammy-winning blues-rocker Fantastic Negrito; the blues-rooted guitarist Melanie Faye; and the idiosyncratic R&B songwriters Moses Sumney and Eryn Allen Kane. The Shed sought out musicians who are thoroughly conscious of forebears and possibilities. Serpentwithfeet — the self-described “pagan gospel” songwriter Josiah Wise — is on the bill April 9. “This show holds a different place in my heart,” he said. “I’ve always been a fan of not just black music itself, but of the narrative of black music. I’m thinking about the music of today, and how does that relate to the music of the 1940s, or the 1870s. I’m constantly thinking about it. I don’t have the privilege not to. Black music isn’t just decorative. It always has a lot of legwork.” The musicians will be backed by a house band — including horns and strings when needed — led by Greg Phillinganes, the prolifically recorded session keyboardist who has been the musical director for Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder onstage, among many others. The music, Mr. Phillinganes said, will be unmistakably live. “This is an Auto-Tune-free zone,” he said. Mr. McQueen intends the staging to focus on musicians at work. “We want to get as close to the bone as possible, to get to the idea of performance rather than any idea of spectacle,” he said. “I want to see the sweat. I want to see the tears. I don’t need glitter. I don’t need smoke.” The brain trust choosing and advising the performers also includes the history-making producer Quincy Jones, along with two younger producers, Dion Wilson (better known as No I.D., who produced Jay-Z’s album “4:44” and tracks for Kanye West, Drake, Common and Nas) and Tunji Balogun, an executive producer for H.E.R. and Khalid. Building Soundtrack of America was a labyrinthine process. To program the Shed, Mr. Poots cast a wide net of ideas — to, among others, Mr. McQueen, with whom he had curated projects in England. One day Mr. McQueen “phoned me out of the blue,” Mr. Poots recalled at an interview in the Shed’s temporary New York City offices. “He said: ‘Imagine hearing the history of African-American music. Imagine a family tree, and you hear from when the boats arrive, and African-American music starts happening all over the country, right up to now.” Mr. Poots immediately wanted to make that the Shed’s grand opening project, forthrightly declaring that African-American music was central to modern culture. “The minute the idea was hatched, this was going to be it,” he said. “I had absolutely no idea how to do it, and Steve really didn’t, but he said, ‘Let’s just start.’” Instead of a gala opening featuring superstars, Soundtrack of America will present emerging musicians. “We didn’t think it was strange,” Mr. Poots said. “But people have pointed out, ‘Who launches a new arts center with 25 pretty much unknown musicians?’ To me, it was a logical conclusion to the idea and the goal that Steve had set down.” Mr. McQueen and Mr. Poots, who are both British, knew they needed American perspectives and solid academic underpinnings, so they called on an expert: Maureen Mahon, a cultural anthropologist and associate professor at N.Y.U. who concentrates on African-American music. She oversaw a “family tree” — intended as a suggestion, not a canon — of music: from unrecorded African-American music through work songs, spirituals, blues, jazz, swing, bebop, R&B, rock ’n’ roll, hip-hop and onward. A panel of other advisers included the journalist Nelson George and musicologists with specialties ranging from current trap back to little-documented slavery-era music.  The family tree went out to the performers, but beyond that tree, musicians didn’t receive assignments; they defined their own musical genealogy. “It’s hard to pick fruit from such an amazing tree, but no matter which one I pick, I know it’s going to be sweet,” said Tarriona Ball, a.k.a. Tank, the frontwoman of New Orleans poetry-funk-jazz band Tank and the Bangas. “Or maybe even a little bitter, because the history isn’t always so clean.” PJ Morton, who grew up in New Orleans, plans to incorporate prime New Orleans R&B and Stevie Wonder in his set. “It’s a beautiful thing that we can be influenced by everything now,” he said. “But I do think it’s important to know that these are real people and real things, and to understand how we got here.”  The jazz-soul singer and songwriter Sy Smith is hoping to dovetail her father’s doo-wop, her classical music studies, the go-go music she heard while attending Howard University, the mixtape culture of early hip-hop and her current jazz-tinged mode. “I want people to appreciate that we all come from different places to end up where we are,” she said.  The initial five concerts may not be the end of Soundtrack of America. It will be filmed in a five-camera shoot; it could spin off an educational app. And given the infinitude of African-American music old and new, it could lead to additional concerts in many formats as the Shed welcomes culture without tuxedos. “I don’t view our first five concerts as the endgame,” Mr. Poots said. “That's the starting point. We could do this for years.” "
5c35f05a3a125f5075c03867,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/09/arts/music/woodstock-50th-anniversary-festival.html,"WOODSTOCK, N.Y. — When the first Woodstock music festival was held in 1969, bringing around 400,000 people to a muddy field in Bethel, N.Y., it focused the world’s attention on pop music’s power to shape the culture. Half a century later, in a music market already jammed with big-ticket festivals, could another Woodstock muster the same impact? Michael Lang, one of the producers of the original event, is betting that it can. From Aug. 16 to 18 — almost exactly 50 years after the first Woodstock — he will present an official anniversary festival, Woodstock 50, in Watkins Glen, N.Y., with ambitions to not only attract a huge multigenerational audience but to rally those fans around a message of social activism. Mr. Lang, who at 74 still has some of the cherubic look seen in the 1970 documentary “Woodstock” — though his curls are threaded with gray — said in an interview at the festival office in Woodstock that he is still booking the acts for the new show; he is hoping for a mixture of legacy bands, current pop and rap stars and, possibly, some news-making combinations. But his vision for Woodstock’s 50th, he said, is clear: a large-scale camping weekend combining music with a program of films, speakers and partnerships with organizations like Head count, which registers young voters.  “Coachella’s got its thing, as does Bonnaroo and Lollapalooza,” Mr. Lang said. “But I think they’re all missing an opportunity to make a difference in the world. They’re all perfect places for social engagement and for fostering ideas, and I think that’s lost.” “We want this to be more than just coming to a concert,” he added. “And hopefully a lot of the bands will become part of this effort to get people to stand up and make themselves heard, to get and out vote. And if they don’t have a candidate that represents their feelings, to find one — or to run themselves.” Yet activism plays a significant part in a number of festivals. Environmental sustainability is central to Bonnaroo, for example, and this year Jay-Z’s Made in America Festival, in Philadelphia, has “Cause Village,” with some 56 charitable and activist organizations represented.  Woodstock 50 will be held in the fields surrounding the Watkins Glen International racetrack, where the Summer Jam in 1973 drew an estimated 600,000 people for the Grateful Dead, the Allman Brothers and the Band; more recently, it has been the site of two festivals by Phish.  For Woodstock, three main stages will be supplemented by three smaller “neighborhoods,” as Mr. Lang described them, with their own food and programming.  Tickets? Mr. Lang and his team are still working on that. But they envision selling a maximum of around 100,000 three-day passes, with most attendees camping on site. As with its other anniversary years, Woodstock’s 50th will be widely celebrated and exploited in the media, with books, albums and a PBS documentary among the projects planned. But unlike the last Woodstock anniversary concerts, in 1994 and 1999, which Mr. Lang presented along with partners, the event now faces severe competition from large-scale festivals around the country.  Coachella, Lollapalooza and Bonnaroo, the three biggest, are now highly developed brand names, with the drawing power to sell out well in advance; tickets for Coachella’s two weekends, for example, sold out in a matter of hours last week. There is even a competing Woodstock: the Bethel Woods Music and Culture Festival, over the same anniversary weekend — which will also feature “TED-style talks” — will be held on the same grounds as the original, around 60 miles from the town of Woodstock. (The Watkins Glen site is further afield, about 30 miles west of Ithaca.) For many concertgoers, another issue is whether the Woodstock name itself was damaged by the 1999 festival, which was marred by fires, rioting and reports of sexual assault.  “It’s not tainted,” Mr. Lang said. “’99 was more like an MTV event than a Woodstock event, really. I take some responsibility for that. It was also kind of an angry time in music.” And then there is the corporate consolidation of the concert business, which has grown especially intense over the last few years as two companies, Live Nation and AEG, compete to book major tours. Live Nation is a partner in the Bethel Woods event. “The industry has completely changed since 1999,” said John Scher, the veteran concert promoter who was a partner with Mr. Lang on Woodstock ’94 and ’99. “The entrepreneurial spirit of 1969 doesn’t exist anymore.” Mr. Lang declined to discuss the budget for Woodstock 50, but festivals of its size typically spend tens of millions on talent alone. “We paid $135,000 for all of our talent in 1969,” Mr. Lang said. “Times have changed.” The festival is being financed by the Dentsu Aegis Network, a unit of the Japanese advertising giant Dentsu; agencies within the Dentsu Aegis Network will be involved in marketing and selling sponsorships.  One advantage for Woodstock 50 is that it is “official.” Mr. Lang remains a partner in Woodstock Ventures, the company that controls the trademark rights, and licenses it for various products. The one Mr. Lang has been closest to is Woodstock Cannabis.  “Cannabis has always been in our DNA,” Mr. Lang said with a smile; his first commercial venture, in 1966, was a head shop in the Coconut Grove neighborhood of Miami. Of the other young men on the team that created Woodstock — Joel Rosenman, John Roberts and Artie Kornfeld — Rosenman is a partner in Woodstock Ventures, along with the family of Roberts, who died in 2001. Kornfeld will return as a consultant and “spiritual adviser,” Mr. Lang said.  Merchandise sales — particularly featuring the original Woodstock bird-and-guitar logo — provide one proxy for gauging the continuing appeal of the Woodstock brand. Dell Furano, the chief executive of Epic Rights, who has handled official Woodstock merchandise for 15 years, said that he is expecting over $100 million in retail sales of Woodstock licensed products in 2019 — four or five times that of non-anniversary years. “There’s every type of tie-dye. Children’s products. Dog products. Speakers, wine, cannabis,” Mr. Furano said in an interview. “The appeal is multigenerational.” In 1969, the mud, the tie-dye and the idealism were all catalysts in creating what the original festival had promised: three days of peace and music. Mr. Lang said that the divisiveness of the current political climate called for that once again. “It just seems like it’s a perfect time,” he said, “for a Woodstock kind of reminder.” "

Just want the music? Listen to the Playlist on Spotify here (or find our profile: nytimes). Like what you hear? Let us know at theplaylist@nytimes.com and sign up for our Louder newsletter, a once-a-week blast of our pop music coverage. Quiet, nightmarish and nursery-rhyme catchy, Billie Eilish’s “Bury a Friend” is matter-of-fact about mourning’s connection to death wish: “Bury a friend/I want to end me.” The video, her creepiest yet, is not for the needle-phobic; the song on its own is unflappably ominous. Its beat is a muffled but brisk electronic shuffle; her voice, moving in and out of electronic effects, is detached and crisply rhythmic, as she wonders, “Why aren’t you scared of me/Why do you care for me?” Another line from the song supplies the title of the debut album she just announced: “When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?” JON PARELES YBN Cordae is one of the most promising young technicians in hip-hop. It’s little surprise, then, that his song celebrating women from various parts of the country (and the world) — his own version of Ludacris’s “Area Codes” — is lighthearted and a little crude, but also lyrically clever, just sharp enough to make the bawdiest moments go down easy. JON CARAMANICA Perky turns menacing — and “fashionista” becomes a three-syllable word — in “Fashionista” by the Japanese group Chai; its first album was “Pink” in 2017, and this is from its coming one, “Punk.” Sing-chanting over a strutting bass line — like the Spice Girls, but switching between English and Japanese — Chai’s voices rattle off thoughts on applying makeup to “get it all sexy” before declaring, in a cloud of backup vocals, “We are fashionista!” By the end of the song, dissonant guitar chords have surfaced, the beat is crashing and ricocheting around, and that cloud of voices has turned into a typhoon: a party out of bounds, or a consumer revolt? PARELES Here’s a track that thumps, blips and hisses its way toward the limbic system, while a filtered voice urges, “Get loose to the rhythm of the drum.” Paradoxically, amid all those programmed beats and swoops, I don’t hear an actual drum. PARELES A hard smack of good cheer from the Lil Peep archives, which still hold a bounty of collaborations with his good friend, the D.I.Y. sing-rap innovator iLoveMakonnen. Much like iLoveMakonnen’s underappreciated 2017 single “Love,” “I’ve Been Waiting” has some 1950s guilelessness at its core, blended with 1980s pop optimism. What’s striking here is how intuitive a melodist iLoveMakonnen is — Lil Peep smear-sings the chorus, while iLoveMakonnen sounds jubilant even though the sentiment leans dark. Patrick Stump of Fall Out Boy, the guest of honor, finds a welcome home for his tight yelps — he sounds anxious, as always, but also happy to be here. CARAMANICA The South African rapper Yugen Blakrok, who made a quick appearance on the “Black Panther” soundtrack album, has a full album out today, “Anima Mysterium.” In “Picture Box,” she confronts media distortion and “horrific daily news” that’s “spewing words without content/spoken out of context,” and she summons mystical remedies. Her voice is low and insistent, in a thick, trudging, orchestral track that faces burdens with tenacity. PARELES “Despacito” taught Luis Fonsi to breathe. For almost two decades, he’d been among the more powerful vocalists in Latin pop, but he rarely allowed himself to find a pocket, a groove, and reside there peacefully. So what’s notable about “Vida,” his new album, is how he leans back from his vocal authority and finds ways to dole it out carefully, like on the lilting guitar caresser (with extremely light EDM flickers) “Poco A Poco.” “Vida” is, shockingly, Fonsi’s first album following the globe-smashing success of “Despacito,” released two years ago. Both versions are here — the original, and the remix with Justin Bieber — and, it should be said, they still go hard. CARAMANICA Allison Miller was aboard the New York subway while she wrote most of the tunes on “Glitter Wolf,” her fifth album with Boom Tic Boom, something that shows through in the music. These pieces have the sturdy, thwacking power of so much of Miller’s drumming — which is equally informed by punk and jazz — and the jostling momentum of an M.T.A. car on the move. Miller writes melodies with purpose, and many of the tunes on the LP seem destined to stick with you, perhaps none more than “Daughter and Sun.” It starts off as a romp, its swinging melody nodding to Ornette Coleman in one moment, and Middle Eastern maqam in the next. The sextet slowly dissolves until all we’ve got left is Miller alone. She picks up the pieces, playing a drum solo that coheres into a powerful rumble, and sends us back to that joyful melody. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO White Denim, a long-running band from Austin, loves the impact of garage rock, the melodies of pop and the musical and verbal intricacies of prog rock. “NY Money” is nearly seven minutes of perpetual motion, semi-sequiturs and two-chord (the intro has three) Minimalist obsessiveness. It hurtles through thoughts of drugs, death, self-renewal, disappearance, a gaptoothed waitress and high finance without ever losing its limber momentum. PARELES Paul Webb, who was the bassist in the 1980s band Talk Talk, first recorded as Rustin Man in 2002, on a duo album with Beth Gibbons of Portishead. The sequel, 17 years later, is the Rustin Man album “Drift Code,” and it’s a throwback to the post-psychedelic British prog rock of the late 1960s and early 1970s — particularly Soft Machine and its bemused, melancholy singer, Robert Wyatt. “Judgment Train” is a bluesy, jammy, wah-wah-loving railroad ride toward an unknowable afterlife. PARELES Two sound-worlds meet on this track from “An Attempt to Lift the Veil,” a duet album by Jim Jarmusch, on electric guitar, and Jozef van Wissem, on lute. One is a loud, constantly evolving yet somehow meditative feedback drone; the other is a handful of laconic, minor-key motifs on lute. One is clangorous, amorphous, psychedelic, the other consonant, neatly contained and semiclassical. Somehow, they harmonize. PARELES "
5c7047743a125f5075c0b10d,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/22/arts/music/r-kelly-charged-indicted.html,"For more than two decades, the R&B singer R. Kelly has been trailed by allegations of sexual misconduct. He was married to a young singer who turned out to be 15 years old. There were claims that he controlled women in a cultlike atmosphere. He was linked to an infamous sex tape. None of it meaningfully stood in his way. Then, on Friday in Chicago, after weeks of renewed scrutiny, Mr. Kelly was indicted. The authorities accused him of aggravated criminal sexual abuse involving four victims, three of whom were underage, according to the Cook County state’s attorney, Kim Foxx. Aggravated criminal sexual abuse can carry a sentence of three to seven years in prison for each count. Mr. Kelly, whose real name is Robert Kelly, faces 10 of them. “This was 30 years in the making,” said Jim DeRogatis, the music journalist who was among the first to document allegations against Mr. Kelly. The singer, 52, was tried on 14 counts of child pornography and ultimately acquitted in 2008. But in the intervening years, the world around him has changed. The #MeToo movement has washed across the country. As the fallout from abuse by Catholic priests unspooled, statutes of limitations on the sexual acts involving children have been raised or, in states like Illinois, abolished altogether. Women who were afraid to come forward or who were not believed are increasingly being heard. Ms. Foxx said the events related to Mr. Kelly’s charges spanned from 1998 to 2010. Three of the victims were between the ages of 13 and 16 at the time of the events. [Meet the Chicago prosecutor asking R. Kelly’s accusers to come forward.] Mr. Kelly is accused of ejaculating on one victim, identified by the initials L.C., in a forcible encounter, an attempted criminal sexual assault. Court documents said she reported the offense to law enforcement officials within two years of its occurrence. Prosecutors said that Mr. Kelly had oral sex and intercourse with the other three victims, all of whom were less than 17 years old, too young to legally consent. Mr. Kelly, who turned himself in to the police in Chicago on Friday night, is due in court on Saturday for a bail hearing. After Mr. Kelly surrendered, his lawyer, Steven Greenberg, spoke to reporters for several minutes, fiercely maintaining Mr. Kelly’s innocence and blasting the state’s attorney for what he characterized as succumbing to public pressure by bringing charges against him. At one point he claimed that all of the women accusing Mr. Kelly are lying. “Mr. Kelly is strong, he’s got a lot of support and he’s going to be vindicated on all of these charges,” he said. “One by one, if it has to be.” After so many years of accusations, Mr. Kelly became the focus of scrutiny after the documentary “Surviving R. Kelly” was broadcast on Lifetime in January. The six-part series included testimony from several women who accused the singer of abuse dating back to the 1990s. The celebrity lawyer Michael Avenatti said last week that he had obtained a video showing Mr. Kelly having sex with a 14-year-old girl, and had given it to the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office in Chicago. He has said that Mr. Kelly and the girl refer to her age multiple times in the video, which is more than 40 minutes long. On Friday, Mr. Avenatti said that the video depicted oral, vaginal and anal sex, and that Mr. Kelly urinates on the girl. At one point in the footage, Mr. Avenatti said, Mr. Kelly has the girl watch a pornographic video on a screen, which depicts Mr. Kelly with another young woman. [What we know about R. Kelly’s two-decade trail of sexual abuse accusations.] On Thursday, two additional women came forward at a news conference in New York organized by their lawyer, Gloria Allred, to accuse Mr. Kelly of sexual abuse and misconduct when they were minors. The women, Latresa Scaff, 40, and Rochelle Washington, 39, said they met the singer after a concert in the mid-1990s when they were 16 and 15; they said he asked for a threesome and had sex with Ms. Scaff. “This may not be the only prosecution of Mr. Kelly, because we are aware of other open investigations in other jurisdictions,” Ms. Allred said on Friday. Ms. Allred said that two of her clients had been interviewed by federal investigators in Brooklyn. Federal investigators in Manhattan were also looking at Mr. Kelly’s conduct, although the circumstances were not immediately clear. “We’re glad to see the allegations against R. Kelly are being taken seriously and hope that these charges empower victims to come forward,” Rainn, the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network, said in a statement. “The survivors who shared their stories showed admirable courage and strength.” Mr. Kelly was acquitted in 2008, but allegations of sexual misconduct have followed him for much of his career. More than 20 years ago, Vibe magazine questioned a marriage certificate that said the singer Aaliyah was 18 when she and Mr. Kelly were wed. She was, in fact, 15 at the time and the marriage was annulled. Mr. Greenberg has said Mr. Kelly did not know she was underage at the time. Aaliyah died in a plane crash in 2001. [The lonely, and risky pursuit of R. Kelly: Meet the journalists who followed the case.]  Now a legacy act selling concert tickets largely on the strength of his catalog, Mr. Kelly was a powerful hitmaker when he was arrested on child pornography charges in 2002 over a tape prosecutors said showed him having sex with and urinating on an underage girl. He continued to release hits as his lawyers filed motion after motion, delaying the trial for six years. The girl from the video never testified, and though 14 witnesses identified her, Mr. Kelly’s lawyers argued successfully that her identity could not be proven. He was acquitted on all 14 counts he faced. In 2017, the allegations picked up again when Mr. DeRogatis, the music journalist, wrote articles for BuzzFeed News that described Mr. Kelly keeping women in a “cult,” in which he separated them from their families and exerted tremendous control over their lives. Last year, the social media campaign #MuteRKelly gained momentum, seeking to put pressure on the companies involved with Mr. Kelly’s career, including the streaming services Spotify and Apple Music; Ticketmaster, which sells tickets to his concerts; and RCA Records, a division of Sony Music that released his last four albums. While Mr. Kelly seemed impervious to the accusations, things appeared to take a turn in January, after “Surviving R. Kelly” caused a stir. Law enforcement authorities in Illinois and Georgia, where he has lived, began looking into his conduct. And after tremendous public pressure from activists, Mr. Kelly was dropped by RCA, just two weeks after the program aired. The fact that the alleged victim did not participate in Mr. Kelly’s 2008 trial was a significant problem for the prosecution, jurors said. “All of us felt the grayness of the case,” one juror told reporters at the time. On Friday, Ms. Foxx read off the charges against Mr. Kelly at a news conference and left without taking questions. Mr. DeRogatis was in the room. “The first girl, who I met,” he said, “it was 1991. She was 15. Thirty years the system has failed. I’d like to be optimistic today. I don’t know if I am.” "
5c2ff71c3a125f5075c02eda,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/arts/music/surviving-r-kelly.html,"For more than two decades, the R&B singer Robert Kelly, who performs as R. Kelly, has faced accusations of sexual misconduct and abuse. This week, a six-part documentary on Lifetime is taking an expansive look at the allegations against Mr. Kelly, a chart-topping artist whose history has invited extra scrutiny in recent years. The series, “Surviving R. Kelly,” includes testimony from several women who accuse the singer of abuse, as well as commentary from Mr. Kelly’s critics, including the founder of the #MeToo movement, Tarana Burke, and the singer John Legend. The six episodes, each an hour long, cover the long history of allegations against Mr. Kelly. They feature women who described being controlled or abused by him, often when they were teenagers, as well as associates and relatives of the singer. Mr. Kelly has continuously denied the allegations against him. The documentary has become the subject of widespread attention and fierce debate on social media, with many expressing gratitude to the women who continue to tell their stories. “I wish that he would experience a kind of social death, and that people who still vociferously declare him innocent — or their favorite artist, or worthy of having his work separated from who he is — that they are denied that,” said dream hampton, an executive producer of the documentary. The six parts of the series were scheduled over three days of broadcast, from Thursday through Saturday. The third and fourth episodes focused on Mr. Kelly’s 2008 child pornography trial and the sex tape at its center. The fifth and sixth episodes examine more recent allegations and follow parents who were trying to free their daughters from Mr. Kelly’s influence, Ms. hampton said. While some fans of Mr. Kelly still defend him, many critics say that he has escaped the consequences of his actions for far too long. “No one cared because we were black girls,” the writer Mikki Kendall said in the documentary. [Here is a timeline of the accusations against Mr. Kelly.] Ms. hampton agreed that race was an integral part of this story. She added that black boys and girls in the United States were often perceived as older than they are, and mentioned Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old boy who was shot and killed by a police officer in Cleveland in 2014. “We know black boys are perceived to be older than they are by police, and we absolutely do an equivalent thing to black girls,” Ms. hampton said in an interview Friday. “We perceive them to be more sexual at an early age. We perceive them to be older. And that is rooted — there is no other way to say it, and it’s not hyperbole to say — it’s absolutely rooted in this country’s history of slavery, which has gone on longer than it hasn’t.” Mr. Kelly was still featured as an artist on the RCA website on Saturday. The label did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and a representative for Sony Music, which oversees RCA Records, declined to comment. Mr. Kelly’s management also declined to comment. His team has previously said it would “vigorously resist this attempted public lynching of a black man who has made extraordinary contributions to our culture.” Mr. Kelly is not currently facing criminal charges. In 1994, when Mr. Kelly was 27, he married Aaliyah Haughton, who was 15 but was listed as 18 on a wedding certificate, according to Vibe Magazine. The marriage was annulled in 1995. Ms. Haughton, who was a popular singer in her own right, died in a plane crash in 2001. Mr. Kelly was accused of having sex with a teenager in a lawsuit in 1996, and again in 2001. Both lawsuits were settled, but the music critic Jim DeRogatis, who reported on them, continued to investigate the accusations against Mr. Kelly. [Here is a New York Times Popcast interview with Mr. DeRogatis.] In the documentary, people who knew R. Kelly claim that during the 1990s and 2000s, associates of the famous singer knew that he liked to prey on underage girls. In 2002, a video that appeared to show Mr. Kelly having sex with a teenage girl and urinating in her mouth was sent to Mr. DeRogatis at The Chicago Sun-Times, which reported that the footage was being investigated by the Chicago police. Later that year, Mr. Kelly was indicted by a grand jury in Chicago for child pornography. He pleaded not guilty, and for more than five years his case did not make it to trial. During that time he released albums including “Chocolate Factory,” which contained the chart-topping song “Ignition (Remix).” Arguments in the 2008 trial centered on whether the man shown in the video was indeed Mr. Kelly, and whether the girl’s identity or her age could be verified. The jury decided that the girl, who did not testify, could not be identified, and Mr. Kelly was found not guilty. In the documentary, one juror was asked about the women who had said, during the trial, that they also were victimized by Mr. Kelly when they were young. “I just didn’t believe them, the women,” the juror answered. “I know it sounds ridiculous. The way they dress, the way they act — I didn’t like them.” For years after the trial, Mr. Kelly continued to perform. In 2017, an article by Mr. DeRogatis in BuzzFeed News reported on allegations that the singer was controlling several young women by taking away their phones and limiting contact with their families. That same year, a campaign of protests, in person and on social media under the hashtag #MuteRKelly, began to pick up steam. In 2018, Spotify announced that it would remove Mr. Kelly from its official playlists, though his music would remain on the streaming platform. A screening of the Lifetime documentary in Manhattan last month was called off after anonymous threats were called in to the venue, CNN reported. The documentary’s producers include Ms. hampton, Tamra Simmons, Brie Miranda Bryant, Joel Karsberg and Jesse Daniels, according to Lifetime. Some of the people featured in the documentary, including Mr. Legend and the columnist Jamilah Lemieux, have pointed people to organizations like A Long Walk Home, a Chicago-based nonprofit working to end violence against girls and women; and Girls for Gender Equity, a nonprofit that has created a guide for viewers of the documentary, including those who are survivors of sexual assault.

Just want the music? Listen to the Playlist on Spotify here (or find our profile: nytimes). Like what you hear? Let us know at theplaylist@nytimes.com and sign up for our Louder newsletter, a once-a-week blast of our pop music coverage. The first original song Sky Ferreira has released since 2013 veers sharply away from the armor-clad pop that filled her first album. But in a way, it’s a segue from that record’s ominous (and atypical) title song, “Night Time, My Time,” by way of the latter-day “Twin Peaks”; she produced the song with the music supervisor for “Twin Peaks,” Dean Hurley. A full minute of a dirgelike string-section instrumental — keening and quivering above, pulsating below — opens “Downhill Lullaby” before Ferreira comes in, singing a chantlike verse in a low, ragged voice: “You leave me open when you hit me/No one can hear you, then you hurt me.” She announced back in 2015 that her next album would be called “Masochism”; this makes clear why. JON PARELES From 1969-72, Joseph Jefferson led a Philadelphia funk band called the Nat Turner Rebellion, which released a few singles — including “Tribute to a Slave” in 1969 — and left an album’s worth of unreleased music in the vaults of Sigma Sound Studios. The first full Nat Turner Rebellion album, “Laugh to Keep from Crying,” has now been compiled by independent archivists and music-business students at Drexel University, which received thousands of tapes from Sigma Sound as a donation. “Tribute to a Slave,” a greeting across eras to the rebel slave Nat Turner, is vintage socially conscious, tambourine-shaking funk. Amid wah-wah guitars and assertive horns, it proclaims, “We ain’t slaves no more.” PARELES Cage the Elephant and Beck made a Twenty One Pilots song. (A good thing!) CARYN GANZ Recently, Lil Uzi Vert announced online that his career was on hold, if not over. What appeared to be a disagreement with his label seemed to be imperiling the release of any new music, including the long-awaited album “Eternal Atake.” In the last couple of days, however, there’s been some movement amid the uncertainty. “Free Uzi” — which his label said was not an official release — made its way to SoundCloud and YouTube, and displayed Uzi at his frenetic best: rapping about a woman “back on my team/ ’cause my neck wet like a squeegee”; alluding to issues with his finances; and confessing to watching “The Big Bang Theory.” JON CARAMANICA Rosalía’s first release since last year’s vivid and clever nu-flamenco album “El Mal Querer” is “Con Altura,” a sweetly melodic reggaeton number featuring a tart and restrained guest verse from J Balvin. The song is impressive, and the video, by Director X, is a riot of colorful outfits, flexible dance, and the confidence that comes with knowing every step you’ve chosen is the right one. CARAMANICA “Hustle” couldn’t bang any more bluntly; it’s three minutes of tightly packed pop escalation. “Don’t hustle me,” Pink berates a guy who “took my love/mistook it for weakness.” Then she restates the line with a blunter word that radio stations and this newspaper won’t use. The swinging beat harks back to rockabilly, and so does Pink’s belted-with-a-grin vocal, but the production expects a minuscule 21st-century attention span, springing a new sound — handclaps, backup voices, gunshots, bell tones, synthetic horns — every four bars if not sooner. It’s as meticulous as it is brash. PARELES Kelly Clarkson and Pink have been working in parallel for almost two decades. In 2017, when both artists had new albums (“Meaning of Life” and “Beautiful Trauma”) they teamed for a cover of R.E.M.’s “Everybody Hurts” at the American Music Awards. Now they’ve collaborated — along with Marshmello and Ed Sheeran’s “Shape of You” team of Johnny McDaid and Steve Mac — on a classic empowerment anthem either of them could have sung. It’s from the forthcoming animated movie “UglyDolls,” in which Clarkson plays a plush toy seeking self-acceptance. Perhaps in the future this duo of powerhouse vocalists and electric live performers will seek a co-headlining arena tour. GANZ As the influence of Nigerian highlife and American funk stretched across West Africa in the 1970s, different cultural traditions found their own ways in. In Benin, Sir Victor Uwaifo became known for rendering the ekassa — a rhythm and dance associated with the coronation of a new king — as a modern sound. On “IIziegbe (Ikassa No. 70),” horns and voices call back to him from across a bed of buoyant bass drum, played on every off-beat. This is one of 12 recently dug-up tracks, all from different artists, released Friday in the latest installment of Strut Records’ “Nigeria 70” series. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO “Put your makeup on, girl, stand up straight/Your face will take you farther than your brain”: The mother figure that haunts “Pretty Shiny Things,” the harrowing and beautiful new single from the country singer Kassi Ashton, is vicious and unapologetic. Ashton paints her with the savage acuity of Miranda Lambert and the lonely sorrow of Julie Roberts, which is to say she’s painful to listen to, but hard to ignore. CARAMANICA Bluesy, fingerpicked electric guitar, and not much else, accompanies Pink Sweats in “I Know,” from the new EP “Vol. 2.” It’s a love song with a streak of desperation — “There must a reason that you’re stealing my soul” — and with a high, mournful vocal, Pink Sweats resigns himself to obsession. PARELES This year’s carnival season in Colombia has ended, but two top Colombian bands extend the party with this collaboration that pools their strengths: deep dancehall-like growls from Systema Solar and the tart lead vocals of Liliana Saumet from Bomba Estéreo, entwined guitars that hint at both cumbia and Congolese pop, busily arpeggiating synthesizers and deep-dive bass lines, even some traditionalist Afro-Colombian drumming. “There will always be Carnival,” the song insists, working to make it true. PARELES Secret Machines, one of the best trios of the aughts, released a live album this week that was recorded in 2006 at the Garage in London. “Nowhere Again” is from the group’s thundering, ominous 2004 debut, “Now Here Is Nowhere,” but the band played it a bit poppier at this show shortly before the release of its second LP, “Ten Silver Drops.” A year later, the guitarist Benjamin Curtis left the band to focus on another project, School of Seven Bells. He died from lymphoma in 2013 and documents of his time in Secret Machines with his brother, the keyboardist and singer Brandon, and the drummer Josh Garza are very valuable. GANZ A tenacious 5/4 pulse propels “Crow’s Perch” through a slew of post-punk transformations in just four minutes: from muffled bass line through sparse, almost jazzy ballad, through brittle patterns and strangulated one-syllable vocal lines, through a briefly restrained spoken-word passage on the way to a crashing, shouting, dissonant peak. It’s math-rock confronting a world of chaos. PARELES Betty Carter was jazz’s quintessential modernist: She liked to tease and stretch a classic melody until it was almost misshapen, testing her elastic instinct against the structure of a piece. In this live recording, captured at Lincoln Center in 1992 during the heady final years of her career, Carter sings “If I Should Lose You” in duet with the young pianist Geri Allen. The accompanist treats the song with her own sense of passionate restraint, collapsing its harmonies at the center, as if to represent the song’s fraught, nearly fatalist romanticism. A record of the concert has just been released on CD by Blue Engine Records, Jazz at Lincoln Center’s in-house label. RUSSONELLO "
5c82b4d349f0eacbf105c1b3,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/arts/music/piano-concertos-thomas-ades-john-adams.html,"The attention of classical music in America on Thursday was divided between the opposite coasts. By coincidence, new piano concertos by two of the most important composers of our time had their premieres: Thomas Adès’s in Boston and John Adams’s in Los Angeles. [Read more about the dueling premieres.] There is a deep and rich tradition in the meeting between a solo pianist and a symphony orchestra. The results can be thunderous battle, delicate sympathy, genial play — sometimes all in the same piece. Mr. Adès, 48, and Mr. Adams, 72 — both with strongly individual voices, both keenly aware of what’s come before — are ideally suited to take on this looming history, and to contribute to it. David Allen, on the East Coast, and Zachary Woolfe, in the West, heard the results. BOSTON — Mr. Adès has written a piano concerto before, but not a Piano Concerto. Aside from a brief “Concerto Conciso” (1997) for piano and chamber ensemble, his main foray in the genre to this point has been “In Seven Days” (2008), a depiction of the Creation in seven movements, with optional video installation. His new and quite wonderful Concerto for Piano and Orchestra, which Kirill Gerstein played on Thursday with the composer leading the Boston Symphony Orchestra, is different. As Mr. Adès has put it, it’s a “proper piano concerto,” along the lines of Mozart or Bartok. It has no title. It has whistle-worthy themes. It has three movements, fast-slow-fast, marked only by their tempos. It has an opening in sonata form, with a first subject, a second subject, a development section, a recapitulation and a cadenza. It has a poignant, melodic second movement. It has a slithering, cascading finale, with a coda that ends with a cadential sequence Beethoven might have been proud of. It’s refreshingly, even radically, normal. Surely it can’t be so? Even if his style is relatively approachable, Thomas Adès still is Thomas Adès, the once-iconoclastic composer of mischievous, sardonic works like “Powder Her Face” (1995), “Totentanz” (2013) and “The Exterminating Angel” (2016). So you might expect me to point to some ironies I heard running as caustic undercurrents, tugging the whole thing down. Perhaps Mr. Adès is actually dismantling the concerto from within? Perhaps he’s offering a blistering, subversive take on what a frankly modern piano concerto can be, as he did more than 20 years ago for the symphony with “Asyla” (1997)? If he is, I didn’t hear it. Instead, Mr. Adès’s 20-minute work comes off as an affectionate, joyous, remarkably uncomplicated tribute to tradition. The writing is labyrinthine, to be sure, but this is a composer so sure of his abilities and influences that there is no sense in this concerto of history as a burden or as something to be thrown off. It is, rather, something to be approached as an equal. And while plenty of composers talk about how they have thought about the tradition when they write a new concerto, few have placed themselves in it with such breathtaking ease as Mr. Adès does here. As ever, the craft is astounding, the orchestration ceaselessly brilliant. The voice is wholly his own — dissonant, offbeat, whiplash, wry — even as it whispers to musics past. Something of the angular, unnerving opening theme bears an uncanny resemblance to the upward, four-note motif that George Gershwin used for the words “I got rhythm.” Something about the slow movement, which pulls at the heart with an open directness that’s unusual in this composer’s music, can be traced to the atmosphere of Beethoven’s Fourth Concerto, its powerful brass and wind chorale answered with placid wonder by the piano, at least at first. There’s a funny wink to hyper-Romantic excess when a glockenspiel tinkles above the fray at the end of the finale. The way a phrase will end, a mood shift, brings Rachmaninoff fluttering into mind. The technical demands are Lisztian and worse. Not that anything seems to daunt  Mr. Gerstein, the pianist who asked for the new work while rehearsing “In Seven Days” in Boston seven years ago. He dispatched this concerto with his customary virtuosity and commitment, but for all his double-octave flash, it was his tender voicing of the cluster chords that halo the melody of the slow movement that lingers in the ears. He played as if the concerto had been a friend for years. These two artists have struck quite the partnership; they play piano duos at Zankel Hall on March 13 and bring the new concerto to Carnegie on March 20. Also on the bill then will be the same pieces performed here in Boston: Liszt’s “Mephisto Waltz No. 1,” given a raunchy if not quite fluent reading, and a loud, bombastic, thrillingly crude take on Tchaikovsky’s Symphony No. 4. Be there. DAVID ALLEN LOS ANGELES — After Yuja Wang had finished playing the premiere of Mr. Adams’s concerto at Walt Disney Concert Hall here, and the applause wouldn’t stop, she returned to the stage for an encore. She played a piece by — who else? — John Adams. Dating back to 1977, “China Gates” is one of his earliest works, a short solo that’s a calm, steady precipitation of eighth notes: sometimes a smiling sunshower, sometimes a melancholy drizzle. Coming right after the new concerto, “Must the Devil Have All the Good Tunes?,” it gave a moving summary of how far Mr. Adams has come over 40 years, in musical complexity and emotional nuance. And also how much his preoccupations of those long-ago days — tension between rhythmic regularity and tremors of instability; simultaneous propulsion and reflection — still interest him today. Given its premiere by Gustavo Dudamel and the Los Angeles Philharmonic, which will tour it widely, “Must the Devil” is an uneasy experience: restless — indeed, relentless — but uncertain, pensive even when it’s peppy. Written during a period in which Mr. Adams also made a new opera, “Girls of the Golden West,” about the dark side of the California Gold Rush, the concerto comes across as a companion work. Another gloomy, even bitter, study in Americana, its most distinctive bit of orchestration is a part for honky-tonk piano (ideally a detuned upright, but on Thursday conjured electronically, and far too weakly) that evokes the saloons — and, implicitly, the chauvinistic illusions — of Hollywood westerns, while coming across as a devilish shadow of the “real” solo piano. In three parts, played as a single movement of not quite half an hour, “Must the Devil” begins in a sudden surge and chugs along industriously but with stumbles — a machine that fails to find its groove. The music builds in intricacy but remains oddly reticent, with unsettling snaps and buzzes (“gritty, funky, but in strict tempo,” Mr. Adams indicates for this first section) from the double basses and an electric bass, located on opposite sides of the orchestra. Relaxing into the second part with a lulling motif for bassoon and strings — you might think of Ravel — “Must the Devil” troubles the piano’s serenity with a sustained low tremble in the basses, and a disturbing plunk of honky-tonk. There’s early Adams (and the process Minimalism that preceded him) in the melodic thread forming in repeated fits and starts, trying to emerge and complete itself. In passages, the soloist seems to be trying out a kind of rag, but while the rhythm has a gentle, low-slung swing, the piano never finds its footing. The orchestra gently eggs the soloist on into the third section, inaugurated with frosty Adamsian fragments of trumpet fanfare. But there’s little sense of the triumph — or, at least, the reveling in extravagance and difficulty — of earlier finales by this composer. I found this conclusion much like the rest of the piece: anxious, fascinating, sad. The ending comes all at once: The hubbub suddenly drops away, leaving a single toll of a bell. Has someone died? Something? A culture? A country? Ms. Wang was an unfailing, cool to the touch, detailed soloist. Each note, even in a fast run, was precisely considered: a slippery smooth note followed by a diamond-hard one. The almost ominously immaculate quality of her playing was well suited to Mr. Adams’s dark fantasia, which offers virtuosity while staying — intentionally, I think — wary of its, and any, thrills. (There’s tellingly no cadenza to speak of.) After intermission, Mr. Dudamel’s interpretation of Mahler’s First Symphony recalled aspects of “Must the Devil”: the off-kilter quality and troubled lyricism of the first movement, the ruefully swirling third. But, in its straightforward — even bland — healthy-mindedness, this Mahler more than anything acted as a kind of peace offering after Mr. Adams’s beautifully disconcerting concerto. ZACHARY WOOLFE "

TONY BENNETT at Radio City Music Hall (April 13, 8 p.m.). For the better part of a century, this decorated singer from Astoria, Queens, has championed the great American songbook, bewitching audiences with renditions of pop and jazz standards by Cole Porter, Irving Berlin and others. More recently, the 20-time Grammy Award winner introduced himself to younger generations with a series of “Duets” albums, on which he sang alongside contemporary artists like Lady Gaga, John Legend and Amy Winehouse. Bennett still actively tours at the age of 92 and, per the title of his most recent book, is “just getting started.”212-465-6000, radiocity.com LAURA JANE GRACE & THE DEVOURING MOTHERS at Bowery Ballroom (April 18, 7 p.m.). This trio is a side project of Grace’s, whose work as the frontwoman of the Florida punk band Against Me! has highlighted her experiences as a transgender woman, particularly on albums like “Transgender Dysphoria Blues” and “Shape Shift With Me.” Alongside her Devouring Mothers — the drummer Atom Willard (also in Against Me!) and the bassist Marc Jacob Hudson — Grace writes more restrained songs that retain hints of her punkish invective. At this Lower East Side club, the trio will receive support from the New Jersey-based rock group Mercy Union and the Philadelphia-based noise-punk band Control Top. 212-260-4700, mercuryeastpresents.com ‘LIVE FROM HERE’ at the Town Hall (April 13, 5:45 p.m.). The mandolinist Chris Thile had already taken over hosting duties on the weekly radio variety show “A Prairie Home Companion” before its original host, Garrison Keillor, fell from grace. This rebranded program, like its predecessor, is recorded before a live audience, often traveling from its home base in St. Paul to theaters around the country. Among the guests at this week’s taping in Midtown is Sara Bareilles, the pop singer behind radio hits like “Love Song” and  “King of Anything.” She shares the bill with the folk duo Milk Carton Kids and the comedian Aparna Nancherla. 212-997-6661, thetownhall.org NATALIE PRASS at Bowery Ballroom (April 17, 8 p.m.). As this singer-songwriter from Richmond, Va., knows, creating art with a political point of view can be risky. Her second album, last year’s “The Future and the Past,” was written largely in response to the 2016 presidential election; finding a label willing to release it took her longer than she had hoped. In the past year, Prass has toured the album tirelessly, as both a headliner and a supporting artist on Kacey Musgraves’s “Oh, What a World” Tour. On this stop, she’ll perform funk-flavored pop songs like “Oh My” and “Short Court Style,” as well as more orchestral holdovers from her 2015 debut. 212-260-4700, mercuryeastpresents.com [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] PRETTY LOU’S THIRD ANNUAL CHARITY CONCERT at Irving Plaza (April 16, 6 p.m.). The New York hip-hop community rallied around the Brooklyn-based D.J., nightlife personality and Fat Joe affiliate Pretty Lou Ortega (not to be confused with the member of the 1990s rap group Lost Boyz, whose moniker he shares) after he learned he had the rare blood condition aplastic anemia, which has since developed into leukemia. In its third year, this annual showcase benefiting leukemia and A.L.S. research will feature Fat Joe and his fellow Terror Squad member Remy Ma, as well as Raekwon and Ghostface Killah of the Wu-Tang Clan, the Diplomats and others. 212-777-6800, mercuryeastpresents.com PRIESTS at Elsewhere (April 16, 8 p.m.). The members of this trio from Washington have long pushed back on the “political punk” label that critics often affix to their work; still, how they earned it is clear. The debut record from these firebrands is colored by brash guitars and the muscular vocals of their frontwoman, Katie Alice Greer, whose lyrics broach subjects like consumerism and free will. Riffing on the name of Thomas Frank’s 2004 book on the rise of populist conservatism, Priests titled their just-released follow-up “The Seduction of Kansas.” This album is similarly concerned with American politics and identity; this time, though, their sound is more polished. elsewherebrooklyn.comOLIVIA HORN EMMET COHEN TRIO at Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola (April 16, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). Cohen, 28, has a breezy, phlegmatic command at the keyboard, and a deep well of historical jazz references at his fingertips. He has worked as a side musician for such luminaries as Christian McBride and Herlin Riley, and has recorded with the elder statesmen Ron Carter and Jimmy Cobb. If he wasn’t already an obvious heir apparent to the neo-traditional jazz mantle, his win at last weekend’s 2019 American Pianists Awards ought to make it official. At Dizzy’s, he will be joined by the bassist Philip Norris and the drummer Kyle Poole. They will draw some of the night’s material from Cohen’s recent trio album, “Dirty in Detroit.”212-258-9595, jazz.org/dizzys MIHO HAZAMA AND M_UNIT at Jazz Standard (April 17, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). The crossbreeding of classical and jazz has a long history, stretching back to the Third Stream movement of the 1960s. And new approaches to this amalgam have been thick on the ground of late: Just try to count how many young jazz musicians are writing for string quartet these days. One of the boldest thinkers and most delightful composers in this vein is Hazama, who studied Western classical music in Japan before making the jump to jazz. Her chamber orchestra, m_unit, blends strings and horns and mallet percussion in service of her resplendent, highly singable compositions. At the Standard, the group will be playing selections from the recently released “Dancer in Nowhere.”212-576-2232, jazzstandard.com BEN MONDER, TONY MALABY AND TOM RAINEY at Public Records (April 17, 8 p.m.). This newly opened music club, cafe and bar in Gowanus, Brooklyn, has a high-fidelity sound setup in two different rooms. In the back, which is laid out like a typical nightclub, electronic and experimental shows run throughout the week. Every Wednesday going forward, the barroom hosts a weekly jazz series. The group playing this Wednesday is a trio featuring three esteemed, New York-based improvisers with a long history of collaboration: the dark-toned, harmonically sophisticated guitarist Ben Monder, the undersung saxophone titan Tony Malaby and the roving, idiosyncratic drummer Tom Rainey.publicrecords.nyc BRANDON ROSS’S PHANTOM STATION at the Jazz Gallery (April 12, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). Ross, a guitarist best known for his work in the jazz-rock power trio Harriet Tubman, doesn’t just play a slew of different instruments (banjo, soprano guitar, regular old electric guitar, etc.), he also ranges freely from sweet and lyrical playing to wavy, confrontational distortion. Phantom Station is not a band; it’s an opportunity for him to embrace his proclivity for newness and change. He performs under this name with a wide variety of collaborators and formations. On Friday, the ensemble will include Graham Haynes on cornet and electronics, J. T. Lewis (also a member of Harriet Tubman) on drums and Hardedge on sound design. 646-494-3625, jazzgallery.nyc STRETCH MUSIC FESTIVAL at Harlem Stage Gatehouse (April 12, 7:30 p.m.). The trumpeter Christian Scott aTunde Adjuah is about to close the book on a three-year residency at Harlem Stage. As part of that, since 2017 he has convened an annual Stretch Music Festival, comprising educational events, discussions of art and activism, and performances. (The event’s title is a reference to the way Scott refers to his own music; it’s an effort to wriggle free from the limitations of genre.) He is coming off the release last month of “Ancestral Recall,” an impressive album on which West African-derived rhythms and whispery synthesizers fortify his bristling trumpet playing and the strident, subversive poetry of Saul Williams. Friday’s festival will include performances by Scott, the saxophonist Logan Richardson and Freelance, a band that fuses contemporary R&B with backpacker hip-hop and jazz.212-281-9240, harlemstage.org JOHN ZORN’S NEW MASADA QUARTET at the Village Vanguard (April 14, 3 p.m.). Last year, Zorn, the eminent alto saxophonist and downtown arts organizer, released “The Book Beriah,” the final portion of his 613-song epic, “Masada,” a collection of experimental, often lovely compositions based in Jewish folk song, klezmer and free jazz (613 is the number of commandments, or mitzvot, in the Torah). As is the wont of this serial collaborator, Zorn featured a different ensemble on each of “Beriah’s” 10 CDs (11, including the bonus disc). Here he plays material from “Masada” in a new quartet featuring three talented improvisers: Julian Lage on guitar, Jorge Roeder on bass and Kenny Wollesen on drums. 212-255-4037, villagevanguard.comGIOVANNI RUSSONELLO "
5cadf74049f0eacbf1f82559,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/10/arts/music/tayla-parx-ariana-grande-thank-u-next.html,"For 15 weeks since the fall, the top spot on the Billboard singles chart has been occupied by one of two Ariana Grande mega-smashes — “Thank U, Next” and “7 Rings” — that drip with the mettle and coquettish swagger of a pop diva, while borrowing from hip-hop beats and cadences. That winsome formula, though particularly compelling from Grande, can be traced back through recent pop history on a global scale: There are elements of the sound in a K-pop track by the girl group Red Velvet from 2015; a JoJo kiss-off from 2016; a Fifth Harmony single from 2017; and a Grammy-nominated Christina Aguilera number from last year. Even “High Hopes,” the sugary comeback hit from the pop-punk survivors Panic! at the Disco, which peaked at No. 4 in January, shares some of that DNA in its ecstatic vocal runs and melodic precision. The common link comes via the songwriter Taylor Parks, an ebullient 25-year-old former child actress with a brightly dyed bob and an air of benevolent mischief, who was credited on each. Known in the industry as a top-liner, Parks, who performs as Tayla Parx, contributes melodic and lyrical ideas to some of the biggest artists in the world, and those aspiring to be. For the last few years, she has done so quietly, cutting a meticulous yet low-key warpath through popular music on a personal quest to land a No. 1 single on every genre chart — a lofty goal that’s no longer far-fetched. “I only have a few more to go,” Parx said recently, while putting the finishing touches on her own debut album. “I need a country, I need a gospel, and I need a hip-hop.” She tackled Latin pop back in 2016, before its crossover explosion, and Nashville was already in her sights, she teased, after recent interest from Kacey Musgraves and Keith Urban. They are not the only ones to take notice. Parx was credited as a co-writer on half of Grande’s blockbuster “Thank U, Next” album, which rebooted the pop singer’s sound and public narrative. For Parx, the release worked as a springboard from workaday writer to A-list studio presence and, ideally, viable solo artist — an elusive final hurdle for many young female songwriters, from Ester Dean and Jessie J to Julia Michaels and Starrah. “Most songwriters fail to become an artist the same size they were a songwriter,” acknowledged Richie Kipp, one of Parx’s managers. “But I’ve never seen anyone wired like Tayla.” A Texas-born protégée of the actress and choreographer Debbie Allen, Parx moved with her family — a mother who worked in software and a father in mortgage underwriting — to Los Angeles to pursue show business. She played Little Inez Stubbs in the 2007 film adaptation of “Hairspray” before landing a few small television parts, including on Nickelodeon shows where she first crossed paths with Grande. Though they kept in touch intermittently on AOL Instant Messenger — and Parx helped write the title track for Grande’s second album, “My Everything,” in 2014 — the women did not really reconnect in person until the making of “Thank U, Next” late last year. In the meantime, Parx had clocked studio time with Babyface, contributed to a Mariah Carey divorce anthem while still a teenager and become a voice actor on “The Sims” and “The Walking Dead” video games. (Parx’s song “Me vs. Us” has a Simlish version, sung entirely in the fictional language.) Now, with Grande in her corner and on her résumé, Parx is trying to balance studio sessions for hit-seeking artists like Sam Smith, Haim and Dua Lipa with signing artists and producers of her own, going on acting auditions, working on a screenplay for an animated film, conceiving a clothing brand and promoting her Atlantic Records release, “We Need to Talk.” The new album, like Parx’s best hits, is playful and conversational, blending pop, R&B and traces of rap with plenty of Grande-esque high notes. “It’s been nuts,” Parx said. “I really had to jump through all the hoops of fire. First of all, being black, and then being a woman, and then being a young black woman. But we got through all of them.” (A recent study by the University of Southern California Annenberg Inclusion Initiative found that of the 633 songs to chart from 2012 through 2018, just 12.3 percent included female songwriters.) In addition to her contagious pluck and facility across genres, Parx credited her listening skills and discretion as crucial to endearing her to major artists. “There are a lot of things in my vault from the biggest stars in the world,” she said. “I would never betray them or take advantage of that trust.” Her acting background helps, too. “When I write these songs after having conversations with artists,” she said, “I’m embodying that and becoming them in that moment.” Aguilera compared Parx to a little sister, one who introduced her to “Black Mirror” and Instagram stories, while also gamely battling Aguilera’s children with Nerf guns. “She just has this natural personable quality that makes you feel at ease,” Aguilera said. “You want to be in a room with her.” As a former child performer herself, Aguilera said she was thrilled with the recognition now heading Parx’s way after her work with Grande. “I can hear Tayla in those songs, for sure,” Aguilera said, praising Parx’s ability to collaborate with “another young artist and really take them to that next place in their career, where you’re like: ‘Oh, wait, who is this again? Ariana Grande!?’” Parx was brought into the “Thank U, Next” sessions in October by her longtime friends and collaborators Victoria Monét, another top-liner, and the producer Tommy Brown, or TB Hits, who had both worked on Grande’s four previous albums. Grande had just released a full-length, “Sweetener,” that August, but with the death of her ex-boyfriend, the rapper Mac Miller, and the flame out of her high-profile romance with Pete Davidson of “Saturday Night Live,” she had plenty more material to work through. “We were kind of there through the breakup and the makeup and the breakup again,” Parx said, “which is why records like ‘NASA’ and ‘Make Up’ came.” The group wrote about nine songs in a week, six of which ended up making the “Thank U, Next” album. But none were as crucial as the title track, which existed in multiple versions, including the internet-melting one where Grande addressed her exes by name. “They all felt like the one until we got to ‘Thank U, Next,’ and then we were like, ‘This is the one one!’” Parx said. Brown recalled Parx as an advocate for specificity. “She was a big supporter of using the names,” he said, citing her tendency to speak her mind. “All big stars need people who are honest with them,” Brown added. “Too many times these people are lied to or just agreed with. Tayla’s not going to that.” Parx noted that she, Monét and Grande were not only collaborators but also peers and friends. “For me to connect to a young female is a completely different perspective than when you have a Max Martin talking to a young female,” she said, referring to the longtime pop hitmaker. As for the criticism that Grande received about appropriating black music and style, Parx brushed it off, noting that many critics failed to recognize the pop star’s black collaborators. “She’s actually supporting the black producers and writers that she works with more than some of the black artists that I’ve worked with,” Parx said. “I think the free exchange is important for the evolution of music,” she added. “If we didn’t take from each other, genre-wise, everything would sound the same. As long as the proper credit is given, that’s the most important thing.” Parx’s technical skills, like a knack for arranging and producing vocals, also help set her apart. “I might find a breath or a word that I like — it’s like surgery,” she said of the process, which can include coaching singers toward certain emotional registers and chopping up different takes into fine-tuned final versions. As she spoke, Parx was using one ear to track the progress of her own vocals on a song that needed to be finished for her album. In the editing process, a line that should have been “teach me” had morphed into “tease me.” “It sounds like I have a lisp,” she told her audio engineer, barely missing a beat in conversation. Seeming genuinely sated by all of the success coming her way, Parx was typically buoyant about the possibility that “We Need to Talk” may not be her own commercial breakthrough, but merely another baby step in an atypical career. “That would be very ungrateful of me to look at the records that I’ve broken, the career that I’ve had from 9 until now, and measure my success against someone else’s,” she said, flashing her disarmingly confident grin. “There’s a lot of things that the biggest artists in the world haven’t done that I’ve done.” "
5c5c90823a125f5075c088d3,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/07/arts/music/grammy-awards-diversity.html,"The Grammy Awards are supposed to be music’s biggest party. But in recent years the show has also become a piñata for critics, activists and even major artists over a host of issues like race and gender — and, oh yes, music. The 61st annual show, to be hosted by Alicia Keys and broadcast live by CBS on Sunday night, should be no different. After a bruising time last year, when the show came under fire after just one woman won a solo award on the air — and the chief executive of the Recording Academy, Neil Portnow, commented that women in music should “step up” to advance their careers — the Grammys made a series of changes in their membership and nominations process that were meant to address their underlying problems. But in many ways the Grammys still walk a tightrope. And as the show tries to stay culturally relevant, while also balancing the demands of race and gender representation, it may be impossible to please everybody at once. “That moment kind of shed a light on an issue that needed attention, and that is a lack of diversity in the industry,” Portnow said in an interview this week. “And if the light that was shed becomes a catalyst for change, then you can feel that it had a reason and a value.” To viewers, one of the clearest changes will be that eight, instead of five, acts will now compete in the four major categories: album, record and song of the year, and best new artist. That change satisfied many critics by adding more women to the mix, but it also has made the contests harder to handicap. For album of the year, Drake and Kendrick Lamar, two deities of contemporary hip-hop, are up against Post Malone, who has topped the charts with a mellow style between rapping and singing; the boisterous rap of Cardi B; the adventurous R&B of Janelle Monáe and H.E.R.; and two singer-songwriters in the country and folk spheres, Kacey Musgraves and Brandi Carlile. If Carlile prevails, she would be the award’s first openly gay winner. But as an artist with minimal sales, would her victory make the Grammys seem out of touch with the masses? Will a rapper win, or will they cancel one another out on the ballot? There is also a chance that the award could go to Drake or Lamar only to have the winner not show up. That has become a growing risk for the Grammys as the show has alienated more and more hip-hop and R&B stars — like Drake, Kanye West, Jay-Z and Frank Ocean — by failing to give them the most prestigious prizes. “The fact of the matter is, we continue to have a problem in the hip-hop world,” said Ken Ehrlich, the longtime producer of the show. “When they don’t take home the big prize, the regard of the academy, and what the Grammys represent, continues to be less meaningful to the hip-hop community, which is sad.” Ehrlich said that this year he offered performance slots on the show to Drake, Lamar and Childish Gambino — whose song “This Is America” is up for four awards, including record and song of the year — but they all declined. Representatives of those three artists declined to comment on whether they would attend the show. More bad news for the Grammys arrived on Thursday afternoon, when Ariana Grande confirmed reports that she had pulled out after clashing with producers — apparently Ehrlich himself — over which song to perform. “I’ve kept my mouth shut but now you’re lying about me,” Grande wrote on Twitter, responding to an Associated Press interview in which Erhlich said that she “felt it was too late for her to pull something together.” “I can pull together a performance over night and you know that, Ken,” she wrote. “It was when my creativity & self expression was stifled by you, that i decided not to attend. I hope the show is exactly what you want it to be and more.” Last year was another flash point in the troubled history of the Grammys and hip-hop, as Jay-Z, the most nominated artist, with eight nods — including album, record and song of the year — went home empty-handed, and Lamar, while winning all five awards in the rap field, lost out on album of the year, to Bruno Mars. Three months later, Lamar won the Pulitzer Prize for music. “For the Pulitzers to get it right and the Grammys to get it wrong says a lot,” said Troy Carter, an artist manager and former Spotify executive. Portnow said he believed the Grammys had made good-faith efforts to reach out to artists, but the tensions have shown no signs of letting up. “We would hope that all nominees attend the show and be there as their own achievements are celebrated,” Portnow said, “because that’s really what it’s about.” But while race has been a growing problem for years, the Grammys’ most urgent issue is over gender. Last year, a report by the University of Southern California, released days before the show, found dismal numbers about the representation of women in the music industry and at the Grammys. Lorde, the only woman nominated for album of the year in 2018, was not offered a solo performance slot. After the show, Portnow’s “step up” comment drew an immediate outcry, with some women music executives calling for his resignation. (Portnow said at the time that his words had been taken out of context, and later announced that would leave his position at the expiration of his contract in July.) In response, the Recording Academy appointed a task force, led by Tina Tchen, a former chief of staff to Michelle Obama, to “identify the various barriers and unconscious biases faced by underrepresented communities” at the academy and in the wider industry. Working with the task force, the academy has tried to make its voting pool more diverse, inviting 900 new people, from a variety of backgrounds, to be members; of those, 22 percent accepted in time to vote this year, according to Laura Segura Mueller, the academy’s vice president of membership and industry relations. Last week the task force challenged the music industry to hire more women producers and engineers, two jobs that are overwhelmingly male. Even with these steps, this year’s nominations show just how much work is left to achieve real gender parity. On the eight songs up for record of the year, a total of 48 producers and engineers were credited, and only two were female. One of them is Lady Gaga, as a producer of “Shallow,” her song with Bradley Cooper from “A Star Is Born,” which is a strong contender for both record and song of the year. Lady Gaga is scheduled to perform, but that night Cooper will be at the Baftas, the British film awards. (Taylor Swift, who is up for just one award, pop vocal album, is also in London, filming an adaptation of “Cats,” and is not expected to attend the show.) And this week U.S.C. released an updated version of its report, showing that the numbers for women working in music have not improved. Looking at Billboard’s year-end Hot 100 list for the last seven years — a total of 633 songs, after removing duplicates — the report found that of 1,455 artists credited on those songs, only 17.1 percent were women. In another finding, only three of those 633 songs were credited solely to female songwriters. “This report really solidifies what we saw last year,” said Stacy L. Smith, the founder of U.S.C.’s Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, and the leader of the study, “and confirms that females are still facing an inclusion crisis in prominent positions in the music space.” Portnow said he viewed last year’s criticism as an opportunity to address important issues, and for the academy to take a leadership role in the industry. Not everyone will be happy, he said, but that’s O.K. “The underlying factors of what makes people happy or unhappy changes from year to year,” he said. “It might be something musical, or it might be something sociological, which is what we’re seeing more of in today’s climate. But that’s appropriate, because that’s the time in history we are living in.” "

A-TRAK at Marquee (March 22, 11 p.m.). A touring D.J. for Kanye West in the early 2000s, this Canadian turntablist quickly graduated from trusted collaborator to label boss: In 2007, he co-founded Fool’s Gold, a Brooklyn-based record company that has championed artists like Danny Brown and Kid Cudi. He has also released his own work through the label, including 2016’s “In the Loop: A Decade of Remixes,” a box set compiling a selection of his 200-plus credited remixes (most notably, his version of “Heads Will Roll” by the Yeah Yeah Yeahs). A-Trak celebrates his birthday with a guest set at this trendy West Chelsea nightclub. 646-473-0202, marqueeny.com MARIAH CAREY at Radio City Music Hall (March 25, 8 p.m.). Since the early 1990s, this powerhouse has put the full might of her five-octave voice behind radio hits that straddle genres, from the honeyed daze of “Always Be My Baby” to the hip-hop flair of her “Fantasy” remix featuring Ol’ Dirty Bastard. Currently, Carey is on the road touring her 15th studio album, “Caution” — a record graced by collaborators like Ty Dolla Sign and Dev Hynes. It prioritizes a more subdued, of-the-moment R&B sound over the vocal theatrics for which Carey is known. Still, expect the singer to dust off the showstoppers for her hometown crowd.  212-465-6000, radiocity.com FLOHIO at Baby’s All Right (March 22, 8 p.m.). This Nigeria-born, British-bred rapper makes her way to Brooklyn this weekend to perform hard-charging songs that draw together elements of grime, trap and techno. An energetic M.C., Flohio — whose given name is Funmi Ohiosuma — floods her music with a brashness that she attributes to her South London upbringing. Ohiosuma recently told The Guardian, “Rap isn’t meant to be too happy; there’s meant to be grit in there.” That attitude guides her recent EP, “Wild Yout,” on which she touts her authenticity and taunts her detractors. Released in November, it was the culminating effort of her breakout year. 718-599-5800, babysallright.com JOSÉ GONZÁLEZ at the Apollo Theater (March 21-22, 8 p.m.). In his solo work, this Swedish-Argentinian songwriter is a practiced minimalist, painting pictures with just his fingerpicked guitar and soft vocals. But González transforms in the company of collaborators. His sound expands whether he’s recording with the folk-rock group Junip or touring with the String Theory, an experimental orchestra from Berlin and Gothenburg with whom he released a live album last month. The String Theory will join him for his two-night run at the Apollo, performing new arrangements of songs from González’s three solo albums. 212-531-5305, apollotheater.org [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] KAIA KATER AND KARINE POLWART at Carnegie Hall (March 23, 9 p.m.). This double bill showcases a range of folk traditions, embraced by two distinctly contemporary artists. For Quebec-born Kater, the Canadian folk songs of her childhood and the Appalachian music she studied while attending college in West Virginia serve as touchstones; Polwart, meanwhile, draws from the musical heritage of her native Scotland. The noted political dimension in the songwriting of both women makes this a natural pairing: Kater has sung about the Black Lives Matter movement and political strife in her father’s home country of Grenada, and Polwart’s 2018 album, “Laws of Motion,” addresses Trumpism and the experiences of migrants. 212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org TORRES at Le Poisson Rouge (March 22, 8 p.m.). In the six years since she released her debut album, the Brooklyn-based singer Mackenzie Scott (a.k.a. Torres) has made the journey from quiet, confessional songwriter to adventurous, often boisterous rocker. On her most recent album, 2017’s “Three Futures,” Scott textured her guitar work with industrial and electronic sounds, aiming to create something that engaged all five senses. For her show at this Manhattan multimedia club, expect sensory engagement, beginning with her ritual preshow burning of palo santo sticks. Annie Hart, of the trio Au Revoir Simone, will open, setting the stage with lush, synth-driven pop songs. lpr.comOLIVIA HORN ALTERNATIVE GUITAR SUMMIT at various locations (March 21, 25 and 27-28, 7:30 p.m.). Organized by the guitarist Joel Harrison, the annual Alternative Guitar Summit gathers some of the most talented six-string improvisers in jazz, post-rock and world music. This year’s festival begins on Thursday with a 50th-anniversary celebration of the music of Woodstock, at Le Poisson Rouge in Greenwich Village. Harrison will play music from the Richie Havens and the Grateful Dead songbooks alongside the Everett Bradley Choir. The guitarist Ben Monder and the vocalist Jo Lawry will collaborate on music by John Sebastian and the Band. And the guitarist Nels Cline, who’s best known for his work in Wilco, will revisit Santana’s iconic Woodstock performance. The summit’s second concert takes place on Monday, when Cline, Leni Stern and others will pay tribute to the esteemed guitarist (and multi-instrumentalist) Ralph Towner at Drom, in the East Village. It concludes on Wednesday and Thursday at Jazz Standard with solo shows from Towner himself. (On the last two nights, there will be second sets at 9:30 p.m.) alternativeguitarsummit.com AARON DIEHL TRIO at the Baruch Performing Arts Center (March 28, 8 p.m.). Diehl’s piano playing has the same courtly, dapper flare as his wardrobe (he’s usually attired in a crisp, dark suit, sometimes topped off with a pair of thick-framed glasses). Picking up the mantle of midcentury greats like Bud Powell, Barry Harris and Cedar Walton, he espouses the ideal of jazz as America’s classical music, whether he’s performing standards or his own neo-traditionalist compositions. He may be best known for his work alongside Cécile McLorin Salvant, an eminent young vocalist, but at Baruch the spotlight will fall squarely on Diehl and his trio, which features the bassist David Wong and the drummer Aaron Kimmel. They will be playing music from his most recent album, “Space, Time, Continuum,” as well as some new pieces.212-352-3101, baruch.cuny.edu/bpac FIRE! AND MADALYN MERKEY at the Clemente Soto Vélez Cultural Center (March 28, 8 p.m.). The tenor saxophonist Mats Gustafsson, one of Europe’s most uncompromising free improvisers, angles toward the void in Fire!, a trio that includes the bassist Johan Berthling and the drummer Andreas Werliin. Whether scrawling an illegible smear of notes across the top of a pounding beat or erupting in fury as the rhythm dissolves beneath him, Gustafsson keeps the intensity high and your ears alight — even when his tone skews murky and dark. Fire! shares the bill here with Merkey, whose semi-ambient electronic music guides listeners into a kind of dreamlike state. This concert — Fire!’s first ever in New York — is presented by the nonprofit organization Blank Forms.blankforms.org DEREK GRIPPER at Roulette (March 23, 8 p.m.). Gripper, a South African guitarist, has developed a virtuoso approach to playing Malian music that was originally composed for instruments such as the kora (a 21-string instrument, somewhere between a harp and a guitar) and the ngoni (a possible progenitor of the banjo). He fingerpicks his classical guitar in percussive swirls, producing a sound that’s as enlivening as it is hypnotic. His repertoire includes music by the kora master Toumani Diabaté and the guitarist Ali Farka Touré, as well as folk songs from South Africa’s Western Cape. This concert kicks off the fifth annual A World in Trance festival, which spotlights music from around the world with explicitly spiritual overtones.917-267-0368, roulette.org MANUEL VALERA AND THE NEW CUBAN EXPRESS BIG BAND at Terraza 7 (March 28, 9 p.m.). Valera, a Cuban-born pianist with a blazingly fluent right hand and a mellifluous compositional style, has long led the New Cuban Express, a midsize band that integrates elements of contemporary New York jazz with Afro-Cuban forms. On Thursday he will premiere a big-band iteration of the ensemble, featuring the vocalist Sofía Rei and the alto saxophonist Román Filiú, plus 16 other instrumentalists.347-808-0518, terraza7.com WEBBER/MORRIS BIG BAND at the Jazz Gallery (March 22, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). The tenor saxophonist and flutist Anna Webber recently put out “Clockwise,” an album full of atonality and friction and discomfited momentum — not to mention, some of New York’s premier improvising musicians. Angela Morris, a fellow saxophonist, shares some of Webber’s style, while also drawing more heavily on the influence of Impressionist composers and jazz’s most ancient styles. They have been playing their ambitious original compositions in this big band for a few years, and supposedly there’s an album on the way — but so far all we have to show for it are a few YouTube clips and a bit of buzz on the scene. To really hear the Webber/Morris Big Band, you’ve got to go in person.646-494-3625, jazzgallery.nyc GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO "

Let us know at theplaylist@nytimes.com and sign up for our Louder newsletter, a once-a-week blast of our pop music coverage. Offset’s marital troubles with Cardi B sent him to the celebrity doghouse, but he’s lately re-emerged in search of a public rebrand — devoted husband, committed father and newly introspective rapper. The title track of his solo album, “Father of 4,” is a plea for understanding directed toward his young children. He lists them off, explains how he’s done them wrong, then promises to do better. CARAMANICA The Haitian band Lakou Mizik, which was formed after Haiti’s catastrophic 2010 earthquake, has remade the New Orleans standard “Iko Iko,” a pop hit (for the Dixie Cups and others) based on half-understood Mardi Gras Indian chants that may have Haitian roots. Lakou Mizik added lyrics in Haitian Kreyol proclaiming the Haiti-New Orleans connection; the 79rs Gang, a Mardi Gras Indian alliance, sings the New Orleans chants. Hooting horns from Haiti’s rara carnival tradition mix with the Preservation Hall Jazz Band; there’s percussion from all sides and an earth-moving bass. Mardi Gras is March 5; the cultural cross-pollination, and the party, continue. PARELES The Oscars are Sunday, which means you only have a few days to absorb all the covers of “Shallow” from “A Star Is Born,” including this sharp late entry from Jimmie Allen and Abby Anderson, young country singers with R&B inclinations, who harness the song’s raw power and shellac it with a layer of controlled cool. CARAMANICA The music in “The Barrel” is folky and straightforward, circling through four chords fingerpicked on an acoustic guitar behind Aldous Harding’s demure voice. The words are the conundrum: cryptic, imagistic and distinctly wary of some undefined commitment: “Looks like a date is set/Show the ferret to the egg/I’m not getting led along.” And the video clip, with some surprises near the end, gives nothing away. PARELES On her new album, “Intuition: Songs from the Minds of Women,” the vocalist Alicia Olatuja chose a wide range of songs written by female artists — from Joni Mitchell to Angela Bofill to Imogen Heap — and set about making a new imprint on each. Her album-closing rendition of “This Woman’s Work,” by Kate Bush, features nothing but Olatuja’s luminous, classically trained voice overdubbed a handful of times, wound together in an airy, a cappella arrangement. Bush’s version was an intimate mash-up of ’80s pop and folk song and musical theater; Olatuja has found a way to honor what made it so distinctive, while creating a whole new sound. RUSSONELLO Michael Rother, the guitarist from the 1970s Krautrock trailblazers Neu! (and briefly before that, Kraftwerk), has collected a boxed set of his solo work, including previously unreleased tracks like this one from the score for the 2015 film “The Robbers.” It unfolds methodically, with an octave-bouncing line somewhere between bass riff and mantric melody; three-and-a-half minutes in, some clanking, chattering electronics arrive to give it precisely the lift it needs. PARELES The hypnosis continues. Gunna remains the most clever and intuitive rapper of the post-Young Thug generation, and on “Baby Birkin” — a standout from his new “Drip or Drown 2” — he circles again and again to a rhyme scheme that bleeds across the conventional bar structure, making the final syllable of each phrase into a de facto leadoff rhyme. The result is you never quite know if you’re coming or going, if the end is in front of you or just behind. It’s intoxicating. CARAMANICA Norah Jones has been collaborating widely lately, flexing genre boundaries; this track will be on an album collecting those experiments. “Just a Little Bit” leans toward jazz and Minimalism, with the meticulous Brian Blade on drums carrying a syncopated pulse as Jones sustains a drone on organ and ornaments it sporadically on piano. Her voice is approachable as always, but what she is singing is more confrontational. “I’m not the one you can refuse/I’m not your plaything, I’m not your muse.” Rightfully: This is not a time to take women for granted. PARELES One of the great disappointments of the tail end of the SoundCloud rap boom is how thoroughly its anarchic instincts have been all but wrung out of it. Sometimes, when you hear Lil Pump rap, he sounds like … a regular rapper. Which is fine, of course, if less fun. “Harverd Dropout” is his first full-length album, and while it features successful collaborations with Kanye West, Lil Uzi Vert, YG, 2 Chainz, Quavo and others, it’s most impressive when an awareness of the rest of the world is filtered out. Take “Vroom Vroom Vroom,” an agglomeration of interjections, sound effects, bass throbs and more, slapped atop each other chaotically. It’s exuberant fun, a return to the moment when what Lil Pump and others proposed was a new idea, a radical notion, an essential urge. CARAMANICA Contemplating the optimism of space travel and discord on Earth, Bruce Hornsby delivers a swinging, Minimalistic chamber-pop hoedown, an Aaron Copland-tinged romp with yMusic’s horns and strings ricocheting all around Hornsby’s percussive piano clusters. It’s genial and upbeat, but far from complacent. PARELES The tenor saxophonist Chris Potter, the drummer Eric Harland and the keyboardist James Francies lock into a big-boned, contemporary-jazz groove about a minute into “Hold It,” and you start to hear voices crowding the room. It’s almost all Potter, overdubbed on top of himself, before the dubs drop out and he launches into one of his characteristically herculean solos. This track is from “Circuits,” a new album announcing a fresh band, but one that harkens to the electrified, funk-fusion group Underground, which Potter led about a decade ago. Nowadays, jaw-dropping technical displays are the norm for Potter, but this band can still get something new out of him. RUSSONELLO This full-length song from Tierra Whack keeps things minimal, as she sings and raps over a two-bar, two-chord loop, plus or minus a drumbeat. In an assortment of voices, none of them all that perturbed, she severs her ties to a guy who’s selfish, stingy, dishonest, unfaithful and distracting her from her career. “I don’t wanna work it out,” she informs him, “so cancel our gym membership.” PARELES Here's the thought process behind a breakup, telescoped into five minutes by the three sisters in Teen. It's exposed at the start — a piano, a beat, a voice — with lyrics like “I don’t know why I still pretend that you could still be, maybe, my man.” Then, as details emerge about past conflicts and current letdowns, synthesizers join the chords and the sisters add harmonies to conclude, “I can’t pretend any more.” It's heartsick and triumphal at the same time. PARELES On his new album, “Preminger Plays Preminger,” the tenor saxophonist Noah Preminger honors his great-uncle, the director Otto Preminger, whose noir films were often known for their use of poignant, haunting music. (Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn famously scored “Anatomy of a Murder.”) With help from a stellar, acoustic-jazz quartet, Noah covers pieces from the old movies’ soundtracks, as well as some original compositions inspired by them. “For the Man with the Golden Arm” — an outtake left off the album, which was released on Friday to Newvelle Records subscribers — falls into the latter category; the saxophonist channels the circumspection and the longing of the 1955 film’s original soundtrack into a watery, wandering melody. Preminger overdubs multiple tenor saxophone parts, which paddle around each other and rest gently on Jason Moran’s rippling piano accompaniment. RUSSONELLO "
5c51bbf63a125f5075c071bf,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/30/arts/music/grammy-awards-music-video.html,"Another year, another persistent worry that the Grammy Awards will once again fail to recognize boundary-pushing black performers. The nominations  are led by Kendrick Lamar, Drake and a crop of female artists — a promising shift after years of complaints about a lack of diversity at the music industry’s big night. However, nominations don’t necessarily turn into wins: Two years ago, Beyoncé was snubbed in the major categories; in 2018, Jay-Z received the most nominations of any artist and walked away empty-handed. But at this year’s ceremony, which will take place Feb. 10, there is one category in which the Recording Academy has nominated a surprisingly sophisticated set of performers, all of whom are black: best music video. (In addition to the artist, this Grammy is awarded to the video’s director and producer.) In the Grammy context, the music video category — No. 83 out of 84 on the official list — is generally an afterthought. It was instituted in 1984, the same year MTV inaugurated its Video Music Awards, just as the medium was becoming central to star-making. At this moment — when artists are as likely to develop their audiences on YouTube as on any audio-only platform, and in which expertise in self-presentation and self-promotion is mandatory — the category feels essential. The nominations recognize clips that shaped conversation as much as the songs they illustrate. Some of these videos are wholesale pieces of art in which the visuals and music are fundamentally inseparable; sometimes the importance of the video itself trumps that of the song. Childish Gambino’s “This Is America” and Joyner Lucas’s “I’m Not Racist” present competing narratives about the state of black life in this country. “Apes**t,” by Jay-Z and Beyoncé (recording as the Carters), is a lush fantasia about dismantling old power hierarchies. Janelle Monáe’s “Pynk” is a wild, psychedelic tour of female amorousness. And Tierra Whack’s “Mumbo Jumbo” serves a strong dose of surrealism. Of these nominees, “This Is America” was the most influential and revelatory last year, a stark, violent, ecstatic and darkly comic statement of intent from Childish Gambino, the musical alter ego of the actor Donald Glover. It was also the first music project from Glover that embodied the tension and savvy of his work in other mediums, particularly the television show “Atlanta.” In the video, Glover saunters, slides, shimmies and bolts his way through a warehouse. His body movements careen from the sensual to the frustrated — he is a performer, a pleaser, but one at war with those impulses, torn between delivering joy and extinguishing it. Sometimes he’s nailing dances from the Instagram Explore page or the video-sharing app Triller, but then he brakes hard, finds a gun and kills fellow performers offering less fraught forms of musical healing. “This is America/Don’t catch you slippin’ up,” he raps, setting terms for negotiating a white society that leaves barely any margin for black error. At the end of the video, as Young Thug sings, “You just a black man in this world/You just a bar code,” Glover runs directly at the camera — first in darkness, only the whites of his eyes and teeth visible. Then he emerges into the light, frantic, no longer in control. This burst of dystopian pessimism has a dim contrast in “I’m Not Racist,” which is almost grotesquely earnest and naïvely optimistic. It, too, takes place in a warehouse, where an aggrieved, bearded MAGA-hat-wearing white man faces off against a skeptical black man. The 30-year-old Massachusetts rapper Lucas (who is black) performs both verses, first from the perspective of the white conservative (with an abundance of racial epithets), and later, from that of the black man who can’t bear to listen anymore. As music, it is onerous agitpop — an egregious case of bothsidesism. As video, it’s unintentionally comic, mawkish passing for sober. Throughout the clip, the tension grows; the white man stands up and hovers over his counterpart, pointing and yelling. Eventually, the black man stands up, flips the table, knocks the MAGA hat off his sparring partner’s head. It seems like there will be resolution, that the guy who insists he’s not racist will finally come to the realization that he is. But then the men face each other and hug, a hilarious conclusion that pretends problems can be solved by simply airing grievances, not addressing them. It feels antiquated and childishly hopeful, as if it had been released in a less tumultuous time — like, say, the early 2010s. Both of these videos are premised on the anxiety that’s born of systemic misunderstanding, confrontation and racism. For a recalibration of that dynamic, there is “Apes**t,” the audacious Jay-Z and Beyoncé video filmed in the Louvre, which proposes that black beauty and creativity belong in museums, too, and that no exclusively white space should remain that way. It is a lavish affair, aesthetically and conceptually, energized by the fact that, on a basic level, the art on the Louvre walls is static, but the performers in the space are not. When a passel of dancers, lying prone atop the Daru staircase, begins to convulse and come to life, it feels like watching birth. Throughout the clip, Beyoncé and Jay-Z hold the screen with intensity and confidence, as natural in this hallowed space as in their home(s). In this, the later stage of their respective careers, engagement with high art has emerged as a crucial signifier, one beyond music, or fashion or other more conventional displays of material wealth. While “Apes**t” doesn’t feel as fully formed or thoughtfully executed as Beyoncé’s “Formation,” which won in this category in 2017, its near-casualness is a loud statement. All three of these videos are designed as provocations of a sort, thinkpiece-bait event releases designed to cut through online clutter. Put out a song on streaming services, and it might be swallowed whole by the ocean. In this crowded climate, creating a vivid video is a survival strategy, especially with no tastemaker outlet (à la MTV) directly promoting/privileging the format. That is how the most effective music videos function today: as time-stopping conversation pieces. But this category also recognizes artists who understand how crucial video is to image formation, and who build it into their output from the earliest stages of their careers. Monáe’s “Pynk” is excerpted from a short film called “Dirty Computer” that accompanied her 2018 album of the same name. Since her early days, Monáe has excelled at character development, and her music functions best as part of an audiovisual whole. “Pynk” is a frothy, playful celebration of sexual openness, straightforward in narrative but inventive in presentation. It was part of a broader story she told last year, in art and in public life, about coming out as queer. The 23-year-old rapper Tierra Whack is a natural visual eccentric and fantastical inheritor of Monáe, as well as of Missy Elliott, Busta Rhymes, the director Chris Cunningham and others. Her excellent 2018 debut album, “Whack World,” was 15 minutes long, one minute per song, and released as one long video full of Whack inhabiting various oddball characters. Strangely, she’s nominated here for “Mumbo Jumbo,” a single that predated that album. Where “Whack World” feels like an extended art project, “Mumbo Jumbo” scans as a micro horror film. Whack is in a dentist’s chair, singing through a mouth retractor. At the end of her surgery, her smile has been exaggerated into an overblown grin. She walks out onto the street, which is as decrepit as Glover’s warehouse, and is surrounded by suffering people saddled with the same false grin — almost an echo of the hollow-eyed sunken place victims in “Get Out.” The song is fine, sort of an extended melodic mumble. But for Whack, perhaps more than any of her fellow nominees, the video is the story. Inventive videos have won in this category before: Janet and Michael Jackson’s “Scream” in 1996, Missy Elliott’s “Lose Control” in 2006, and “Formation.” But more frequently it has gone to the just-fine-enough (or just-expensive-enough) video for an otherwise very popular song, or to an artist so famous (say, the Beatles, in 1997) that Grammy voters tick their box reflexively. But moving forward, this category should be seen as an opportunity to embrace a whole new breed of musician, one who reflects what has long been true but rarely acknowledged at the Grammys: that the job of a recording artist has changed, and that those now making the most vivid impact are as careful about how they look as how they sound. "
5c4c417d3a125f5075c0674b,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/26/obituaries/michel-legrand-dead.html,"Michel Legrand, the invariably romantic pianist, arranger and composer of hundreds of film scores and songs that have became pop hits and love anthems, died on Saturday. He was 86. His death was confirmed on the artist’s official Facebook page by his management team. Over a career of more than 60 years, Mr. Legrand collaborated onstage, onscreen and in the studio with dozens of celebrated musicians of his era, from Miles Davis to Perry Como, Stéphane Grappelli to Liza Minnelli. A three-time Academy Award winner and five-time Grammy winner — he was nominated for a total of 13 Oscars and 17 Grammys — Mr. Legrand made the love song his métier. Among his better-known compositions are “The Windmills of Your Mind” from “The Thomas Crown Affair” (1968), which won the Oscar for best song; “The Summer Knows,” the theme from “Summer of ’42” (1971) (Mr. Legrand won an Oscar for the movie’s score); and the Oscar-nominated “What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?” from the film “The Happy Ending” (1969). All three were written with the lyricists Alan and Marilyn Bergman. His recording of “Brian’s Song,” his theme from the TV movie of the same name, made the Billboard pop chart in 1972, peaking at No. 56. Other standards of the Legrand canon include “I Will Wait for You” and “Watch What Happens,” both from “The Umbrellas of Cherbourg” (1964), the writer-director Jacques Demy’s musical tale of star-crossed love. (Norman Gimbel wrote the English lyrics.) A pop opera whose entire story was sung, “Umbrellas” first brought Mr. Legrand’s talents to the attention of American moviegoers and earned him a devoted following in the United States. He also scored Mr. Demy’s follow-up, “The Young Girls of Rochefort,” which included spoken dialogue as well as songs and which, like “Umbrellas,” starred the up-and-coming Catherine Deneuve. On the occasion of the 2009 British rerelease of “Rochefort,” Mr. Legrand told Time Out London of meeting Mr. Demy. “I just finished scoring a François Reichenbach movie called ‘America as Seen by a Frenchman,’” he recalled. “Demy loved the score, so we met and he wanted me to score his first movie, which was called ‘Lola.’ So then I scored ‘Lola’ and we became friends and we came to know, appreciate and love each other, and we stayed friends until the very last.” Mr. Demy, who died in 1990, was married to the filmmaker Agnès Varda, with whom Mr. Legrand also worked extensively. He even appeared onscreen, as a pianist, in her 1962 film, “Cleo From 5 to 7.” Among Mr. Legrand’s other notable compositions was “Papa, Can You Hear Me?” from the Barbra Streisand film “Yentl” (1983), also written with the Bergmans. He received three Oscar nominations for his work on that film, and won for its score. In 2018, he composed music for “The Other Side of the Wind,” a lost film by Orson Welles, whose “F for Fake” he had scored in 1973. Although Mr. Legrand composed far less for the theater than he did for film and television, he was nominated for Tony and Drama Desk awards for the show “Amour,” although it ran for only 17 performances on Broadway in 2002. He also wrote the music for “Marguerite,” a musical that had a brief run in London in 2008 whose creative team also included the writers and lyricists of “Les Misérables” and “Miss Saigon.” Mr. Legrand recorded more than 100 albums, with such disparate stars as Maurice Chevalier (for whom he worked as an accompanist early in his career), Kiri Te Kanawa, Sarah Vaughan, Lena Horne and Barbra Streisand. Others who recorded his music ranged from Frank Sinatra to Sting. Mr. Legrand celebrated over 50 years in show business in 2010 with a concert at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas that featured Dionne Warwick, George Benson, Melissa Manchester, Patti Page and Jennifer O’Neill (the star of “Summer of ’42”). He observed his 80th birthday in 2012 by beginning a world tour that included performances in France, Ireland, Japan, Argentina, Brazil, Russia, Denmark and the Netherlands. His schedule last year included performances in London, New York and Tokyo, and he was planning to tour again in 2019. Michel Jean Legrand was born on Feb. 24, 1932, in Bécon-les-Bruyères, a suburb of Paris, to a French father, Raymond Legrand, a composer and actor, and an Armenian mother, the former Marcelle der Mikaelian. From 1942 to 1949, he studied at the Conservatoire de Paris, where his teachers included the celebrated pianist Nadia Boulanger, before becoming an in-demand arranger, working for French stars like Édith Piaf and Yves Montand. In 1947, Mr. Legrand recalled in a 2011 interview, he became interested in jazz when he saw the trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie in concert in Paris (“I was ecstatic”). He would eventually work with Mr. Gillespie and other jazz greats, on albums like “Dizzy Digs Paris” (1953) and, most notably, his own “Legrand Jazz” (1958), for which he arranged well-known jazz compositions for three different groups of established musicians, one of which included Miles Davis, John Coltrane and Bill Evans. Mr. Legrand worked as an arranger with artists in various genres, including the opera singers Natalie Dessay and Anne Sofie von Otter. “While I was studying in Paris I decided that I wanted to touch on and exist within every possible musical discipline,” Mr. Legrand told Time Out London in 2009. “Concerts, records, radio, playing piano, conducting, singing, composing, classical, playing jazz. So when I started to work, it was really on that decision.” Mr. Legrand became an international sensation in 1954 with “I Love Paris,” a collection of well-known French songs, followed by “Holiday in Rome” and “Michel Legrand Plays Cole Porter.” All were hits. He was invited to the Festival of Youth and Students in Moscow in 1958, and aboard the ship from Paris to Moscow he met his future wife, Christine Bouchard, an Yves Saint Laurent model. They had three children. He would eventually marry three times, most recently in 2014 to the actress Macha Méril. Back in Paris, he began composing for film, working notably for New Wave directors like Jean-Luc Godard and later for Mr. Demy, whose “Umbrellas” earned Mr. Legrand his first three Oscar nominations. “The Young Girls of Rochefort” followed, and in 2009 Mr. Legrand was asked if that was a film of which he was particularly proud. “Yes,” he said, “but I must tell you, I’m not ashamed of anything I’ve done. All the films that I’ve done — and I’ve worked on about 250 — are like my children. So they are all special for different reasons. “But I like everything that I’ve done, and why not? I always did it with pleasure, and I did it because I wanted to do it. There is always a reason, and that is important for me.” In 1966 Mr. Legrand moved to Hollywood, where his friends and fellow composers Quincy Jones and Henry Mancini introduced him to the Bergmans. The first of his many collaborations with them was “The Thomas Crown Affair.” On the occasion of a 2010 concert at Olympia Hall in Paris, Mr. Legrand was asked by French radio whether any of his dreams had gone unfulfilled. “Off the top of my head,” he said, “I regret that I didn’t learn more languages, visit certain countries and listen to music that I don’t yet know about. In other words, there’s a whole cultural process that it’s been difficult for me to undertake because I’ve written a lot, worked, traveled, played around. So I haven’t had time to read some of the extraordinary books that I still think about.” “And then,” he added, “I would have liked to work with Judy Garland, who I nurture a mad passion for. But I was born too late. So no regrets.” "

The Tom Petty archives keep yielding more, like this previously unreleased song about media posturing that rings true in 2019. Tersely and unhurriedly, he rejects posing for magazines or video — and by extension, if he were still alive, social media — to insist, “It was all that rang true/I did it for real and I did it for you.” The arrangement, even though it’s with a full band, is clearly preliminary. If Petty, who died in 2017, had finished it for an album, it would have had more gleam and filigree. But the emotion is irrevocable. JON PARELES Alicia Keys has recorded indelible women’s empowerment songs like “Girl on Fire” and “Superwoman.” But she also understands that changes in gender roles are complicated and constantly in flux — particularly for the mother of two sons. “Raise a Man,” whose co-writers include Terius Nash (The-Dream), is deliberately blurred in every way. It shuns crisp hooks for rippling, improvisational vocal lines; it loops through unresolved chords played by a cloudy string section. It’s a confession of love as vulnerability and connection: “Is it O.K. that I’m not independent?” she sings, “Is it O.K. that I show weakness?” But it’s also clear that she expects equal openness and respect from her partner: “I want what’s coming to me: perfection, protection.” PARELES Pomp and camp, all rolled into one barnstormer. The title track from Lizzo’s forthcoming album is ecstatic, comedic, bawdy and tragic, toggling between powerful blues-soul singing and jubilant, swinging rapping to convey emotion that’s serious and also so unexpected it can’t help but be sort of a laugh, too. JON CARAMANICA “Please Me” begins with all of the R&B from 1990 to 1993 compressed into a rock-hard diamond — signature Bruno Mars nostalgia. Then Cardi B arrives, fresh off her best rap album Grammy win, with her customary saucy salaciousness. Mars grooves and flirts, and Cardi barks demands; even though they had success last year with their first collaboration, the remix of Mars’s “Finesse,” they’re an unlikely pair. Mars is about precision, and Cardi expands to fill the space she’s given, and then some. On this song, the mood is a tug-of-war: breathe fast, then relax, then breathe fast again, then relax. And then it’s done. CARAMANICA Post-punk thrust, math-rock patterns and splintered lyrics mirror the daily dystopian media barrage in “On the Luna,” from “Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost — Part 1,” due March 8, the first of two Foals albums promised this year. Guitar and synthesizer parts overlap in dizzying stereo counterpoint as the 9/4 meter keeps things off-balance; Yannis Philippakis casts himself as a baby boomer singing about childhood memories and present-day regrets. “We had it all and we didn’t stop to think about it,” he realizes. PARELES Les Claypool, from Primus, and Sean Lennon reclaim Beatles (and Monty Python) psychedelia to set out the biography of Jack Parsons, a rocket-science luminary (at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory) who was also a devotee of Aleister Crowley’s Ordo Templi Orientis and its “sex magick” rituals. “Better be careful boys,” Lennon sings. “You just might set the world on fire.” The keyboard tones echo “Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds,” while the extended vocal-harmony coda (singing Crowley’s precepts “Do what thou wilt” and “Love is the law”) hints at “I Want You (She’s So Heavy).” And the video, paying homage to Terry Gilliam’s animations, makes clear just how phallic rockets are. PARELES Nubiyan Twist, a 12-piece band of young Londoners, sources its inspiration widely, from the Caribbean to the Bronx to Central Africa. The group’s guest on “Addis to London” is Mulatu Astatke, the pioneering Ethiopian vibraphonist, another eclectic thinker, who has studied music around the world, and was never content to espouse the traditional sounds or popular music of his homeland. At the start of this track he’s heard explaining the West African roots of the rhythm the band’s about to play. But the sounds of his native country are in there, too, particularly in the tilted minor mode of the harmonies. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO Mortality looms patiently over the folk-rock of “Time Is the Killer.” Rain Phoenix, the sister of the actors Joaquin and River Phoenix, sounds artlessly natural as she sings “Everybody’s lying when we say we’re not afraid,” over a modestly strummed acoustic guitar and a brushed-drums, reverb-laden folk-rock band. Michael Stipe’s occasional backup vocals arrive with fatherly sympathy. The tranquillity is stoic, far from oblivious. PARELES Most likely, you’ll go into a Sons of Kemet show looking forward to Shabaka Hutchings’s tenor saxophone, and you’ll leave buzzing about Theon Cross’s tuba. More than Hutchings, more than its double drummers, it is Cross’s thick, molten playing that pumps life into the upstart British jazz group. Now he is releasing his own album, “Fyah,” full of slamming, dancehall-influenced club tracks, driven by the fireworks between Cross and the drummer Moses Boyd. One piece that sticks out is the chiller “Ciya” — with Cross creating a seductive loop underneath as the alto saxophonist Nubya Garcia and the trombonist Nathaniel Cross, the bandleader’s brother, whisper a gentle sough of a melody. RUSSONELLO Working toward self-forgiveness after a divorce, “Moral of the Story” seesaws between fragility and pomp: from Ashe’s quavery high voice and parlor-song piano tinkling to a hefty, lurching beat and a massed chorus. “People fall in love with the wrong people sometimes,” she tells her mother and her lawyer in the verses. Behind the brave face, there’s still some regret. PARELES The new Avril Lavigne song “Dumb Blonde” — full of blunt horns, hard-slap percussion and lyrics sung in a voice that sounds computer generated — is so chaotic, cluttered and unnatural that when Nicki Minaj arrives two minutes in, she’s a calming force. That said, Minaj’s verse is tepid and tossed-off — perhaps as a reaction to the mayhem that precedes it, or perhaps because she knows well enough when a song will fade into the ether, and no one will remember anyway. CARAMANICA No. Just: no. PARELES Wadada Leo Smith rarely plays the trumpet on “Rosa Parks: Pure Love. An Oratorio of Seven Songs,” a 72-minute suite he composed for an ensemble that’s really many groups in one: three vocalists, four stringed instruments, four trumpets (including Smith), and a duo featuring drums and electronics. On “Rosa Parks: Mercy, Music for Double Quartet,” the strings and brass come together, stretching paper-thin but steely melodies across a lot of open space. Smith states in the press materials that the oratorio is dedicated to a woman “of exceptional courage and wisdom, who made the right move of resistance at the right time.” In that sentence you can almost hear Smith’s music: His slow, deliberate horn playing often sounds like a practice of resistance, and he always knows the right time to act. RUSSONELLO It’s easy for Matthew Shipp’s pelting, centrifugal piano improvisations — full of hard dashes, often in contradictory directions — to feel strident and strong. It’s a bigger feat when he plays toward an emotional middle-range, and on “Flying Saucer” (from a new album, “Signature”) he achieves it, staying around the center of the keyboard, sounding impatient but unruffled. It’s a joy to follow his ardent, two-handed flow, unfolding like a well-told surrealist narrative, and his joyful interactions with the bassist Michael Bisio and the drummer Newman Taylor Baker.

5c476ccf3a125f5075c05b7a,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/22/obituaries/kaye-ballard-dead.html,"Kaye Ballard, whose long career as a comedian, actress and nightclub performer included well-regarded runs in “The Golden Apple” and “Carnival!” on Broadway and a classic turn as a television mother-in-law, died on Monday at her home in Rancho Mirage, Calif. She was 93. Her death was announced by her lawyer, Mark Sendroff. Ms. Ballard wasn’t a top-flight singer, an Oscar-caliber actress or a drop-dead beauty — she once played one of Cinderella’s ugly stepsisters — but she made up for any shortcomings with determination and a sheer love of performing. Even after she became well known, Ms. Ballard was not above taking parts in touring shows and regional theaters, and she rode the nightclub circuit for years, though she found the pace exhausting. In 2000, in her mid-70s, she brought a cabaret show to Arci’s Place in Manhattan called “Another Final Farewell Appearance,” but there was nothing final about it: Later in the decade she was still hard at work, including in tours of “The Full Monty” and “Nunsense.” For the last 40 years or so of her performing career, wherever she was appearing people would mention one particular item from her lengthy résumé: “The Mothers-in-Law,” an NBC sitcom in which she and Eve Arden played neighbors whose children married, turning the newly minted mothers-in-law into partners in meddling. Ms. Arden’s character was a haughty upper-crust type; Ms. Ballard’s was brassy and very Italian. The show made its debut in 1967, and, as with many sitcoms in that era of only three networks, its characters seared their way into the public consciousness with a disproportionate vigor: The series lasted only two seasons, but the mother-in-law personas acquired a certain immortality. “The show was on just long enough to typecast me as a loudmouth Italian actress, but not long enough to ensure that I would earn the kind of money where I wouldn’t have to worry about being typecast,” Ms. Ballard said in “How I Lost 10 Pounds in 53 Years,” a memoir written with Jim Hesselman and published in 2006. Ms. Ballard was born Catherine Gloria Balotta in Cleveland on Nov. 20, 1925, the second of four children. Her father, Vincenzo, and her mother, Lena (Nacarato) Balotta, had both immigrated from Italy. Her father laid concrete sidewalks for a living. “He used to take me all over Cleveland showing me his work,” Ms. Ballard wrote. Even as a child she wanted to be an entertainer, and she passed up a scholarship to Cleveland Art College to pursue that goal. She got her first laughs doing impressions, a skill that served her well for decades in her nightclub acts. (She did a pretty good Bette Davis. She and a second impressionist once appeared on the TV game show “To Tell the Truth” along with Davis herself; four masked panelists asked questions and tried to guess which of the three was the real thing. Davis received three votes, but Ms. Ballard got the other.) Ms. Ballard found an agent in Cleveland and played some local spots, calling herself Kay Ballad; the first name soon acquired an E and the last an R. Then, not yet 20, she was booked on a burlesque tour, doing impressions and skits, which led to a job in Detroit at the Bowery Room, whose owner knew the bandleader Spike Jones and spoke highly of her to him. She hopped a plane to Los Angeles to try to talk her way into Jones’s show and succeeded, winding up singing and also, using her high school band skills, playing flute and tuba. Ms. Ballard toured the vaudeville circuit with Jones for almost two years, but when their show hit New York she was captivated by musical theater; in 1946 she was offered a part in “Three to Make Ready,” a Broadway revue that was about to go on tour, and she took it. Stage appearances all over the country followed in the next several years. Then, in 1954, she won the part of Helen (as in “of Troy”) in “The Golden Apple,” an unusual musical with book and lyrics by John Latouche and music by Jerome Moross that drew on “The Iliad” to tell a story set in early-20th-century Washington State. The show opened at the Phoenix Theater in the East Village and, riding strong reviews, moved to Broadway soon after, running there for 125 performances. Ms. Ballard’s part included the song “Lazy Afternoon,” which Brooks Atkinson, in The New York Times, called “a triumphant number and the high point of the show.” The song was later recorded by many artists, including Barbra Streisand, but Ms. Ballard was the first to release it as a single; on the flip side of that record she introduced another song later made far more famous by others (including, memorably, Peggy Lee and Frank Sinatra), Bart Howard’s “Fly Me to the Moon” (then called “In Other Words”). Her next Broadway role, in 1961, was also in an atypical musical: “Carnival!,” with music and lyrics by Bob Merrill and a book by Michael Stewart. Unlike “The Golden Apple,” though, this one enjoyed a sustained Broadway run, lasting almost two years. Ms. Ballard was the Incomparable Rosalie, a magician’s assistant. For one song, “Always, Always You,” she was in a basket into which her boss, Marco the Magnificent (James Mitchell), kept thrusting swords. Ms. Ballard also appeared in two Broadway flops, “The Beast in Me” in 1963 and “Molly” in 1973, a musical using Gertrude Berg’s characters from the television show “The Goldbergs” and the radio show that preceded it. (For “Molly,” in which Ms. Ballard played the title character, she dropped the E from “Kaye” in her billing. “Let’s just say that I will never go to a numerologist again for advice!” she wrote in her book by way of explanation.) And she was in one television special with a noteworthy theatrical pedigree: Rodgers and Hammerstein’s “Cinderella,” created for CBS. It featured Julie Andrews in the lead; Ms. Ballard and Alice Ghostley played the stepsisters. Its one broadcast, on March 31, 1957, drew an estimated audience of 107 million, a record at the time. After that, Ms. Ballard began turning up on television in guest spots and on variety shows. Desi Arnaz, the executive producer of “The Mothers-in-Law,” eventually picked her for the show after deciding that Ann Sothern, who was originally slated for the role, did not provide enough of a contrast to Ms. Arden’s character. In the early 1970s Ms. Ballard also had a recurring role on “The Doris Day Show,” and her résumé came to include guest appearances on shows like “The Love Boat” and “Trapper John, M.D.” While working regularly in television and making the occasional film, Ms. Ballard toured nightclubs (Arthur Siegel was her longtime pianist) and made the rounds with “Hey, Ma … Kaye Ballard,” a one-woman show recounting her career and her clashes with her mother. Breast cancer, diagnosed in 1994, slowed her down only briefly. Her successes after that included an appearance in a widely acclaimed revival of “Follies” at the Paper Mill Playhouse in New Jersey in 1998. Ms. Ballard, who never married but said she had been engaged four times, leaves no immediate survivors. Last week, a new documentary about her career by Dan Wingate, “Kaye Ballard — The Show Goes On!,” was screened at the Palm Springs International Film Festival. Despite her name recognition, Ms. Ballard knew that she was never an A-list star. Instead, she viewed herself as being in the honorable second tier of performers who work hard but might not achieve lasting fame. Another was Billy De Wolfe, a character actor and friend who died in 1974, and whom she honored with a brief chapter in her book. “He’s yet another performer who falls into the category of brilliant ‘supporting players’ who I feel left the public’s consciousness much too soon after they passed away,” she wrote. “Who knows, perhaps I have a fear that the same thing will happen to me.” "
5ca7278449f0eacbf1f811d6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/05/arts/music/george-walker-sinfonia-visions-seattle-symphony.html,"SEATTLE — Last fall, the Smithsonian’s National Portrait Gallery began to display, among its recent acquisitions, a photograph of the composer George Walker. It shows him close up, his right index finger and thumb bearing down on a pencil with the precision of a surgeon, at work on the manuscript score of his Sinfonia No. 5. The image of Dr. Walker, who died last summer at the age of 96, was captured by the photographer and filmmaker Frank Schramm, a close friend. They had known each other since Mr. Schramm heard a broadcast of Dr. Walker’s Sinfonia No. 3 in 2004 and, he said, “immediately gravitated to his work.” Living within a couple of miles of Dr. Walker in New Jersey, Mr. Schramm would pay regular visits to his house in Montclair — helping out with errands and at the same time using his camera to document his life and work, right up to the end. “George was 81 when I met him, so there was already a sense of time running out,” Mr. Schramm said. “But he was so focused. We would listen to and discuss music. It became like an unsolicited master class for me.” Just two months before his death, Dr. Walker had been keenly anticipating the opportunity to experience Sinfonia No. 5, “Visions,” in a concert hall, Mr. Schramm recalled. He was looking forward to the first live performance, which will be given by the Seattle Symphony Orchestra on April 11. (A studio recording, made in 2017, is available on Albany Records.) The piece, which was completed in 2016, in part conveys Mr. Walker’s response to the 2015 shooting at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C. “He looked back and saw the other work he had done and thought this could be the last one,” said Gregory Walker, the older of Dr. Walker’s two sons. “And he felt an urgency about getting it out there.” “Visions” crowns a long career in which Dr. Walker produced more than 90 compositions, including intimate pieces for solo piano (his primary instrument), and large-scale orchestral and choral works. It was the last score he completed; at the time of his death, he had embarked on a piece commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Amid impassioned debates about the canon and its exclusion of historically marginalized voices, his remarkably individual and intricately crafted musical voice is long overdue for discovery. “George was very proficient,” Mr. Schramm said. “His house became his think-tank, with his work at the center. He knew what he had.” But it was frustrating, he added, for Dr. Walker to repeatedly face difficulty in getting orchestras to program his work. A longtime passionate advocate has been Peter Kermani, a former chairman of what is now the League of American Orchestras and the founder of Albany Records. In the mid-1980s, when he first encountered Dr. Walker’s music, he was attracted to “the lack of sweetness and treacle that a lot of American works had.” “Right from the beginning, that was a distinguishing feature of George’s music,” Mr. Kermani added. “I think he was breaking new ground. I felt he should be given every opportunity on the planet to get his music performed and heard.” The Seattle Symphony’s performance may signal the beginning of a fresh wave of interest. In 2016, Mr. Schramm recalled, Dr. Walker was encouraged by a meeting with the conductor Simon Rattle, who expressed interest in performing his music in Europe. Dr. Walker’s early “Lyric for Strings” became his first piece to be programmed at the BBC Proms when the Chineke! Orchestra performed it shortly after his death last year. During the past two decades, Mr. Kermani has released a multivolume series of Dr. Walker’s orchestral works on the Albany label, along with albums documenting the composer’s earlier career as a concert pianist. He introduced Dr. Walker to the English-born conductor and pianist Ian Hobson, a specialist in mid-20th-century American orchestral music who had made numerous recordings with the Sinfonia Varsovia of Poland. Mr. Hobson described Dr. Walker as “a composer of great integrity: uncompromising in the best sense of the word, who doesn’t pander to anything.” While still trying to place “Visions” with an orchestra, Dr. Walker arranged to have it recorded by Mr. Hobson and the Varsovia Symphony — the final installment of Mr. Hobson’s cycle of his Sinfonias, each of which is a compact, single-movement composition. (“Visions,” with a duration of about 18 minutes, is the longest of them.) “Visions” Mr. Hobson said, is “complex and built of small cells of harmonic patterns and melodic groupings,” adding that “sometimes the detail is knotty and gnarly — and deliberately so — and sometimes unexpected beauties emerge from his extremely sensitive ear for color.” Dr. Walker’s son Gregory — a teacher at the University of Colorado, Boulder, and a former concertmaster of the Boulder Philharmonic Orchestra — said that the piece, which includes spoken text, is striking for the new ground it breaks in orchestral writing. “He wasn’t worried about whether it would be comprehensible immediately,” Gregory Walker said. “It’s an idealistic vision of what this combination of music and text and imagery could achieve.” George Walker was born in 1922, into an arts-loving family in Washington. His father, an immigrant from Jamaica, ran a medical practice from their home and organized his own research groups with colleagues. (At the time, the American Medical Association didn’t grant membership to black doctors.) His mother, a singer, encouraged his precocious talent for music with piano lessons — and did the same for his younger sister, Frances Walker-Slocum, who became the first black woman granted tenure at Oberlin College. Dr. Walker started attending Oberlin at 14, focusing on piano and organ before beginning graduate studies at the Curtis Institute of Music. He envisioned a career as a concert pianist and made his debut in 1945 at Town Hall in New York, as the first black instrumental soloist there. A few weeks later, he achieved the same milestone with the Philadelphia Orchestra as the soloist in Rachmaninoff’s Third Piano Concerto. Despite critical acclaim, Dr. Walker was able to secure only a fraction of the number of engagements that came readily to his white peers. He turned instead to an academic career, while at the same time channeling his creative drive into composition. To improve his keyboard skills at Curtis, he undertook composition studies. (The title of his memoir, “Reminiscences of an American Composer and Pianist,” reflects how fundamental both identities remained for him.) Dr. Walker studied with the storied mentor Rosario Scalero, who also taught Samuel Barber, and spent a period in Paris with Nadia Boulanger. She encouraged him, and with a new focus on composition, he cultivated a distinctively laconic style purged of excess and meticulously designed from meaningful gestures. In 1996, Dr. Walker won the Pulitzer Prize for “Lilacs,” a commission from the Boston Symphony Orchestra that set portions of Walt Whitman’s Lincoln elegy “When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom’d.” But the recognition that came with that and other honors did not erase his experience of struggling to get his music heard by the public. Responding to The New York Times about the Pulitzer news, Dr. Walker revealed the boldly self-reliant attitude he had used to cope with the constant institutional roadblock of racism: “I strongly felt if I continued to press for what I hoped to achieve, I would achieve it.” Being the first black composer to win the music Pulitzer became something of a double-edged sword. Invariably, like a Homeric epithet, it has become the phrase regularly used to introduce him as a composer. “He has been advertised as this African-American statesman who is supposed to be representing all the potential that has been neglected in the black community,” Gregory Walker said, “yet doesn’t follow the trends or fit cleanly into any category of contemporary music.” George Walker’s guiding philosophy, his son added, was that everyone is an individual, and his music was “proof of how individual things can be.” “He saw himself as an extension of great artists of the past, using their compositional techniques, idioms, instruments and aesthetics — and his love of Beethoven and Romantic-era composers,” Gregory Walker said. “He transformed all of that into something that was himself.” Not a programmatic composer by inclination, George Walker began work on “Visions” before the Charleston massacre occurred. But, when he learned what had happened, he became determined to introduce a layer that pays tribute to the victims. Brief, elliptical texts he wrote are assigned to five solo speakers; even though they are not sung parts, the score specifies their approximate ranges (a soprano, a tenor, two baritones and a bass). Along with these textual elements, the music includes several brief — and, in typical fashion, rather hidden — quotations from famous songs like “Drink to Me Only With Thine Eyes” and “I Dream of Jeannie,” as well as the hymn “Rock of Ages” and the spiritual “Swing Low, Sweet Chariot”). The texts are elusive, acquiring disquieting ambiguity when juxtaposed with a video that Mr. Schramm created at Dr. Walker’s request. The video, which begins about midway through “Visions,” contains images of ocean scenes filmed on the Atlantic Coast along with close-ups of photographs documenting the slave trade in Charleston. “It emphasizes the mystery that this was the same ocean that brought the slaves over,” Mr. Schramm said, “and of the past, present and future of the water, which is very dark.” During what turned out to be Dr. Walker’s final year, Elena Dubinets, the vice president of artistic planning and creative projects at the Seattle Symphony, came across interviews in which he had discussed “Visions.” When arrangements for the premiere elsewhere fell through, she expressed interest in having it in Seattle. She found a place for the piece on a program with Dvorak’s “New World” Symphony, conducted by the orchestra’s new music director, Thomas Dausgaard. “We wanted to juxtapose two very different views on our country,” Ms. Dubinets said, “a romanticized European perspective on the American culture combining different worlds into a new one that suited Euro-American colonizers, and an internal perspective coming from an African-American composer terrified by the shocking massacre in Charleston more than 120 years later.” "
5c9ded1349f0eacbf105fb86,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/29/opinion/janet-jackson.html,"America, and the music world at large, has spent a significant portion of the past month grappling with the implications of “Leaving Neverland,” the haunting HBO documentary that revisits highly credible pedophilia allegations against Michael Jackson. But on Friday, good news will emerge about a member of the Jackson family that runs the risk of being overlooked.  Mr. Jackson’s younger sister, Janet Jackson, who has been one of the world’s brightest and most influential pop stars in her own right, will finally be inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame — 15 years after the “Nipplegate” fiasco at the Super Bowl halftime show that threatened her career, and 30 years after the release of her groundbreaking album “Rhythm Nation 1814.” Unlike most of her contemporaries in a comparable stratum, Ms. Jackson has found her entry into music’s most recognizable house of prestige elusive until now. She has been eligible since 2007, and there has been no shortage of whispers or indignant blogging, insisting she has been left out of the hall’s induction classes until now by the same entertainment industry forces that marginalized her after the infamous “wardrobe malfunction.”  In February 2004 — when phones weren’t smart, Twitter didn’t exist, The Facebook was days away from birth, LeBron James was still a teenager and Donald Trump was still a Democrat with a reality show — Janet Jackson had a nightmare unfold, in the space of a second, as she headlined the MTV-produced halftime show of Super Bowl XXXVIII. Before a crowd of over 71,000 and 90 million more watching on TV, Ms. Jackson performed a medley of her hits across three decades. She was then joined for a finale by a bearded yet still baby-faced Justin Timberlake to perform “Rock Your Body,” a catchy, dance-inducing number from his solo debut. The song, which threw the crowd into a happy frenzy, briefly became a duet. Then, in a cinematic shock — as the duo spun apart for what was meant as a final “costume reveal” in the choreography — Mr. Timberlake ripped off a portion of Ms. Jackson’s top, exposing her right breast on live television, just after he’d delivered the song’s last line: “Bet I’ll have you naked by the end of this song.” By the time heads quit spinning, “wardrobe malfunction” had been coined, and what was meant to be a crowning moment for Ms. Jackson was reduced to a meme. They both said it was an accident. But conspiracy theories abounded, and still do.  Parent groups, major advertisers (their parent companies) and the White House all condemned the incident. CBS was handed a fine by the Federal Communications Commission for indecency, which was ultimately voided. And Mr. Timberlake — who, accidentally or not, did the ripping — largely avoided public rebuke. Ms. Jackson, absent from the Grammys that year under unclear circumstances, after being scheduled to appear, experienced a newfangled, online-enabled public taunting analogous only to that faced by Monica Lewinsky at the millennium’s turn. She lost countless endorsement and touring opportunities. (She’ll have her highest-profile return to the limelight when she begins a residency in Las Vegas in May.) But, of course, the five-time Grammy Award winner is being honored because her cultural influence and career, while dotted with distress, has been anything but tragic, taken as a whole. The youngest child in the Jackson family, she had seen her brothers already gain fame as the Jackson 5 before she was a teenager. The 1986 album “Control,” produced by the icons Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, would be her own, noncoincidentally titled breakthrough. She had fired her notoriously domineering father as her manager, and her quest for independence powered the project’s vocal energy, which was matched by bombastic synths and carefree drum-heavy beats.  “Nasty,” a defiant, feminine power anthem protesting unwanted male attention and disrespect, featured a video subtly ahead of its time in its messaging about consent. (The snare drums drop, pointedly, after she shouts at a grabby pursuer, “Stop!”) “Control” topped the charts and established Ms. Jackson as a pioneer of genre-bending New Jack Swing and the modern music video: self-referential quirks and extended dance breakdowns paired with film-like production and narrative. The visual companions to lasting singles like the exasperated yet ebullient “What Have You Done for Me Lately” and the dance number “Pleasure Principle” (legendary back flip and all) helped break MTV’s gendered color line. Where “Control” focused on self-actualization, “Rhythm Nation 1814” (1989) aimed to address the world and her country, with its simmering social divides, and offer a salve. “Join forces in protest to social injustice/A generation full of courage, come forth with me,” she declared over the up-tempo, industrial grind of the title track. The progressivism embedded in the album managed to be simultaneously cool and civic-minded at a time when such a feat was considered nearly impossible for a pop star. Not only did all seven singles from “Rhythm Nation 1814” land in the top five of the Billboard 100, it had No. 1 hits in three separate years — with different songs topping the chart from 1989 through 1991. A long-form video medley of the album, shot in black and white, won a Grammy. Ms. Jackson’s global popularity and the indescribable coolness of her perch in American popular culture at the time is hard to capture in hindsight, or to compare with our digitally Balkanized era. She continued to flourish with her fifth album, 1993’s “Janet.,” embracing her femininity and sexuality with more confident ease than in any of her previous work. Writing about the album on its 25th anniversary for Rolling Stone, Brittany Spanos noted how “Janet.” inspired artists like Beyoncé, Rihanna, SZA and Janelle Monáe, all of whom openly testify to how her example helped them incorporate “power, intimacy and assertiveness” into their own work.  For many women of color growing up in the ’80s and ’90s, Ms. Jackson was the first “triple threat” superstar who looked like them to reach, or fully “cross over,” to the mainstream. It was “Janet” whom they danced to in front of their mirrors and imitated in dress, not Michael. As she entered her 30s and her career steadied to a cruise of experiments and radio hits, Michael Jackson’s had become increasingly weighed down by his questionable relations with children. Mr. Jackson was first accused of molestation in 1993. The case was settled for over $20 million in 1994 and the charges were ultimately dropped after the boy refused to cooperate with the investigation. Janet Jackson was resolute in support of her brother during the episode and after it. Footage from a documentary released in 2016 shows her denouncing the 1993 allegations. “Now, if this really went on, do you think a father would accept money?” she asks the interviewer. “Do you think that would make everything O.K.? It doesn’t make any sense.” Ms. Jackson hasn’t spoken up since “Leaving Neverland” aired. Her nephew Taj Jackson told CBS News’s Gayle King that she feared addressing the film would just “put more energy” into the matter, but he insisted that she, too, believed Michael was innocent. However, her radio silence now, after a previous vociferous defense, seems at best a convenient tactic of avoidance by the family’s second-most-famous member and at worst a tacit acknowledgment that she was most likely wrong all along. Still, whereas Mr. Jackson’s career never quite recovered from a scandal of his own making, Janet Jackson’s career was derailed by a bizarre moment over which she had little agency. (In an extra, queasy layer of coincidence, “Rock Your Body,” the song playing during the Super Bowl nudity flash, is a tune that Mr. Jackson had reportedly turned down for his 2001 album, according to Billboard’s Jason Lipshutz.) The public rebuke she received wasn’t all organic. A 2018 HuffPost report revealed that the CBS chairman Les Moonves, who was ousted last year as evidence of his own sexual misconduct mounted, was determined to ruin Ms. Jackson’s career because of the Super Bowl incident. Convinced it was a stunt and enraged with Ms. Jackson, according to the report, he demanded that Viacom radio stations, as well as VH1 and MTV, which she helped integrate in prior decades, stop playing her music. Ms. Jackson and Mr. Timberlake both offered apologies. But Ms. Jackson, a black woman, was almost exclusively shamed.  For uncertain reasons, despite initial plans, she wasn’t at the Grammys. He was still welcome to attend and won two awards. His career flourished, even as it waxed and waned (see his return to the halftime show of the Super Bowl last year). Hers was arguably suffocated — and at a time before millions of fans could crowdsource their cultural capital for backlash. There was no Black Twitter — with its mix of influential literati, activists and humorists — to have Janet Jackson’s back. The moment lasted just nine-sixteenths of a second but carried centuries of subtext, something Mr. Timberlake himself pointed out after time passed. “I probably got 10 percent of the blame,” he admitted. “I think America's probably harsher on women, and I think America is, you know, unfairly harsh on ethnic people.” “Nipplegate” is, in some ways, textbook proof that “intersectionality” — the term coined by Kimberlé Crenshaw, the same year “Rhythm Nation” was released, to describe the overlapping forms of discrimination — is not an abstract “ism” but a reality that can negatively manifest itself in culture-altering ways. When Madonna kissed Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards, there were guffaws and temporary scoldings. But she was once again celebrated as a provocateur, then shortly afterward inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2008 — by Mr. Timberlake, no less. Ms. Jackson, who became eligible for the hall in 2007 didn’t receive a nomination until 2016. Although Janet Jackson’s legacy certainly doesn’t need the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame’s validation, its lack of recognition was threatening to become a glaring omission. Now, at long last, the oversight will be corrected — and Ms. Jackson can take her bow.

5c667fee3a125f5075c09dd7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/15/arts/music/magic-flute-berlin.html,"BERLIN — In a rehearsal room at the State Opera in Berlin, a few weeks before the opening of the company’s first new production of Mozart’s “Die Zauberflöte” (“The Magic Flute”) in 25 years, pleasant anarchy reigned. The director, Yuval Sharon, giggled, skipped over a set piece, and untangled some ropes dangling from the ceiling. Dancers stretched and laughed. Florian Teichtmeister, the Austrian stage and television actor who has been drafted as Papageno, his first operatic role, had just run through his mock-suicide scene with Lotte Lenya-style speak-singing and a sad clown’s face. He turned to the conductor, Alondra de la Parra, and began to apologize: “I know I couldn’t hold a tune if —.” “Stop it!,” she interrupted him, with a smile. “Focus on the diction. But you’re in pitch, you’re very musical. You’re going to be great.” Relieved, he took a drink of water, and Mr. Sharon — who runs the Industry, an experimental opera company in Los Angeles, and who last year became the first American to direct at the Bayreuth Wagner Festival in Germany — strolled over to discuss the suicide scene with Ms. de la Parra. “This is the part I can never explain to my son,” she said. “It’s a game,” Mr. Sharon said. “But suddenly the game is deadly serious.” The game of presenting a new production of “Die Zauberflöte” is deadly serious, indeed — especially in Germany, where the piece is particularly beloved and performed dozens of times annually in virtually all the country’s plethora of opera houses. Many families make annual pilgrimages to see the State Opera’s storybook 1994 “Zauberflöte,” directed by August Everding using sets and costumes based on 1816 designs by the architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel. (Schinkel, a local hero, also designed many of the buildings surrounding the company’s theater.) For this reason, the company’s new general manager, Mathias Schulz, decided to keep the old production in its repertory and run it alongside Mr. Sharon’s new one, which has been given a gloriously magical infusion of marionette theater and flying effects. The new staging opens Feb. 17 and runs through March 16, and the old one returns for four performances, with a different cast, at the end of April. It’s as if the Metropolitan Opera were to offer a fresh staging of “La Bohème” and then trot out its classic Zeffirelli production a month later. While opera houses will sometimes keep old sets and costumes in storage in case a new production turns out to be a disaster, it is highly unusual for a new show to be introduced with the explicit understanding that it will be presented alongside its predecessor. “With Schinkel there is a historic link that’s very important for this institution,” Mr. Schulz said in an interview. “At the same time, there is the possibility to show that different approaches and different concepts are valid.” Mr. Sharon’s first response was concern, he said of the plans to keep the old version around: “As though the optics of this were that they don’t trust that this is going to work, so they’re holding the other one in reserve. But I learned that was 100 percent not the case.” In fact, he added, knowing that the house will keep the Everding production — which is easy to revive with star singers who might not have time for the weeks of rehearsal needed to make the flying work safely — enabled him to realize his vision unimpeded. “I don’t think any theater would allow me to do this if it was meant to be the standard repertoire version they bring out every year for 20 performances,” he said, adding that the old production “is such a part of the spirit of the house that I understand why they wouldn’t want to let it go.” The soprano Anna Prohaska started her “Flute” career at the State Opera as Papagena in the Everding production before graduating to Pamina, which she will play in the premiere of Mr. Sharon’s show. “The Everding production is beautiful for the freedom it gives to singers,” she said in an interview, but she ribbed how traditional it is: “It’s a little bit patriarchy-washed.” If asked to return to the old production, she added, she’d attempt to integrate the rich characterization of Pamina she’s developed over weeks of work with Mr. Sharon. “The great thing about all this flying and this acrobatics and athletics,” she said, “is that you actually forget your nervousness about singing because you’re so focused on everything else.” With three major opera houses in Berlin, the new staging will therefore be the fourth version in a single city. In such a crowded market, how do you reinterpret a classic opera with fresh eyes? “I wanted to bring the piece to life in a new way without feeling like it gets suffocated through my narrow view,” Mr. Sharon said. He identified two main challenges. First, “Zauberflöte” has surprisingly large quantities of spoken dialogue, which in the mouths of non-acting singers can quickly become deadly. Second, he said, “it needs to have an almost childlike sense of wonder and also a sense of philosophical depth, because the productions that favor one or the other always feel like they’re only telling half the story.” Marionette theater occurred to Mr. Sharon as a general solution. The singers will sometimes be strapped into flying harnesses and sometimes move freely around the stage, but always be attached to visible ropes, as though they’re being manipulated by invisible child puppeteers. The costumes, by the Belgian avant-garde fashion designer Walter van Beirendonck, and the sets, by Mimi Lien, who won a Tony Award for “Natasha, Pierre & the Great Comet of 1812,” allude to both the Mozartean marionettes of Salzburg, Austria, and the Bauhaus-era ballets of Oskar Schlemmer. The dialogues will be replaced by the recorded voices of child actors. The magic — just like the magic flute — will be provided by Mozart’s music: While the singers will move jerkily and expressionlessly through the spoken dialogue, they will come to life, move freely, and sing with their own voices during the music. The one exception will be Papageno, who, content in his role as a puppet, will always move fluidly and speak with his own voice. Mr. Teichtmeister is following the tradition of the 1791 premiere, in which Papageno was played by Mozart’s librettist, Emanuel Schikaneder. A third set of problems with “Die Zauberflöte” seems more and more glaring: the specters of racism and misogyny. Audiences are offered no reason other than distrust of powerful women to believe the first-act switcheroo that reveals that the Queen of the Night, first presented as the hero’s savior, is evil, and that the slave-owning magician Sarastro is genuinely devoted to the search for love and light. Sarastro’s slave Monostatos is black, and his blackness is presented as the reason for his lust, sloth and rage. For Mr. Sharon, it was important not to ignore these parts of the piece, but to point out the ways in which the opera’s overarching message — in his view one of universal liberation, in which the puppets’ move toward self-awareness mirrors the human search for free will and a consciously, collectively shaped future — overcomes its blind spots. The only change to the dialogue, other than shortening some of the longer sections, will be the addition of comments from the voices of the children playing with the puppets, critiquing the racialized characterization of Monostatos. “There are these critical moments,” Mr. Sharon said, “where they stop and question it and say, ‘Well, why are we telling this story?’ and saying, ‘This doesn’t seem right, you don’t tell stories like this today, why are we telling ourselves this story?’ And I think finally one of them says, ‘Well, this must be a very, very old text.’ So then it just becomes part of the play, but it’s not a comfortable part of the play.” Crucially, in Mr. Sharon’s interpretation of the piece’s final trials, which induct Tamino and Pamina into Sarastro’s masonic order, it will be Pamina who leads the transformation. Having spent the opera gradually developing self-awareness as a puppet, she will show Tamino that he is attached to strings, show him how to remove them, and then learn with him how to walk unaided. After the conductor Franz Welser-Möst, who originally suggested Mr. Sharon for the production, dropped out three weeks before the premiere because of urgently needed knee surgery, Ms. de la Parra was given the task of coordinating flying singers and coaching an actor unfamiliar with opera through one of the piece’s central roles. “We all need a medium, a therapist and a masseur,” she said in an interview. But she seemed game. Asked if she was challenged by the flying, she showed a video on her phone from rehearsals for a recent, also acrobatic, staging she led of Mozart’s rarity “Thamos, King of Egypt.” Eager to find out what the singers had to go through, she had herself strapped into a harness and hoisted high above the stage. Ms. Prohaska, quick to stress the help of the flying team and Mr. Sharon, mentioned one entrance in which she will descend from above while the stage floor is dropped to the basement level, leaving her dangling almost 60 feet above the nearest surface for one nerve-racking moment. “I’ve been reading in the middle of the night about falls, even though I shouldn’t,” she said. “And I found a story about a stewardess for a Serbian airline in the 1970s who fell 10,000 meters and could still walk. So I figure, O.K., I’ll probably survive.” "
5c2d2d623a125f5075c0295a,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/02/movies/bohemian-rhapsody-a-star-is-born.html,"I was waiting for a subway last month in Mexico City when I figured out what’s wrong with the Queen movie. I mean, I knew what was wrong. “Bohemian Rhapsody” is scared of tapping into the imagination that made the band so innovative and powerfully, addictively strange. But that’s not what hit me waiting for the subway. The platform entertainment system was playing a concert video of “Another One Bites the Dust.” I don’t know what year the clip was from or what city Queen was in. I just know that the lighting is warm, the groove is skintight (you could feel it on the platform), and that Freddie Mercury is wearing — is packed into — white short-shorts and almost nothing else. No shoes, no shirt yet all service. The towel he’s whipping around gets an almost immediate, theatrical toss into the crowd. The red wristband and red bandanna tied round his neck bring out the red in his Montreal Canadiens trucker’s cap. Mercury does all his Mercurial moves — the side gallop, the chug-a-lug, the duck strut, the steed swipe, the rewind, the vroom-vroom, the Wimbledon Final frozen pirouette, the one where he kind of dries his tushy with the microphone stand in a full march. And he does them while belting out this uppercut of a song (with some shockingly forceful assistance from the drummer Roger Taylor). Commuters, tourists, kids: we looked up at this thing, mesmerized, in jeopardy of missing a train. That’s right about when I figured out what was wrong with the Queen movie: There’s nothing in it remotely like this. “Bohemian Rhapsody” plods, explains, obscures, speculates and flattens. It does not mesmerize. I mean, I wouldn’t miss a train for this. We learn how “We Will Rock You” allegedly sprang from a fit of personal protestation. But it’s news we can’t use. The movie won’t stop telling us things — about the music business and the songs, about Mercury’s tortured sex life. And it fails to show you anything close to what that clip on the subway platforms makes you feel: sweaty. The musical biography has an impossibly high degree of alchemical difficulty. One performer has to become a totally different performer, and not any performer, just this one star the whole world knows, and it has to be done in a way that makes you believe you’re seeing either the impersonated star or something quintessential about them. Val Kilmer made you believe you were seeing something vitally true about Jim Morrison. Joaquin Phoenix did the same with Johnny Cash. And Jamie Foxx became Ray Charles. Angela Bassett convinced you that if you were seeing if not Tina Turner, then Turner’s indestructibility; and Marion Cotillard, the brittle incandescence of Edith Piaf. For my money, one of the triumphs of this type of acting is Chadwick Boseman’s James Brown in “Get On Up.” Boseman pumps Brown full of edginess and spite while having to reconstruct Brown as a stage specimen, and part of that reconstruction involves learning to lip sync to Brown. You sense that you’re watching an actor who’s done more than homework. He’s written himself a little dissertation. It’s not an impression of Brown. It’s an interpolation. Some movies pivot and omit the musical performance altogether. That’s the approach Todd Haynes applied to Bob Dylan in “I’m Not There” and John Ridley took in having Andre 3000 play Jimi Hendrix in “Jimi: All Is by My Side.” But the alchemy is a reason to dislike the genre. It’s hard to get the proportions right. It takes some work in, say, “Cadillac Records” to figure out where Beyoncé ends and Etta James is supposed to begin. Rami Malek has a different challenge in “Bohemian Rhapsody.” He’s not a superstar playing another superstar. He just has to become the superstar Freddie Mercury was. Just. And yet because the movie is mostly scenes of recording sessions, squabbling and self-pity, Mercury’s stardom is made beside the point — it’s assumed — so Malek gets to play a charismatic sufferer, -quipster and, eventually, proud brown gay man. It’s just that this version of Mercury isn’t terribly exciting without the reward of seeing him vroom-vroom in short-shorts. The movie rides the roller coaster of biographical cliché. What’s missing are musical numbers that showcase his showmanship and eternal capacity for self-delight. This means more time watching Malek struggle with dental effects meant to bring his mouth into more realistic alignment with Mercury’s. Maybe Malek has done the best anyone could with the teeth. But they wind up bringing something vampiric out of Mercury that I don’t know was ever there. Either way, the alchemy is off.  WE’RE IN A HAPPY MOMENT for musical-movie excitement. “Mary Poppins” has returned with new songs. And despite that lie of a title, “The Greatest Showman” is the most impressive phenomenon nobody saw coming or took seriously once it came. “Bohemian Rhapsody” is now the musical biopic’s biggest hit. We can have the argument later about the difference between a classical movie musical and a movie where people get on stage and do music, but you could also add to the mix this latest incarnation of “A Star Is Born,” which was a smash too. It’s the story of how a waitress became a Grammy winner. And because the tale is essentially a fantasy — of love, fame and ruin; biography as mythology — its casting is the inverse of the rock bio. A musician does the acting. In Bradley Cooper’s version, the musician is Lady Gaga. She starts off as Ally the restaurant grunt. But when Cooper’s beloved alt-country pill guzzler sees her belt “La Vie en Rose” in a drag parlor, he hauls her into stardom, which Gaga knows well. But the surprise of her acting comes in the first hour when the movie is closer to earth and requires her to be more like you and me — daughter, employee, listener. There’s a lovely hesitance to her here, not in the camera-shy way singers tend to get when it’s time to act. Reluctance is a performance strategy for her in this movie. Again, she’s like you and me, she can’t believe Bradley Cooper’s happening to her, either. Some of what’s great about the first hour is how it gets you thinking about the kind of career Gaga could have in movies they haven’t made in, like, 30 years. The scenes at home with Ally, her chauffeur father and his fellow drivers are loud, funny and warm in a way that reminded me of “Moonstruck.” And some of the pleasure I had watching Gaga in them is how she reminded me of another singer who acts: Cher. A friend points out that she could have Cher’s career if the movies were still interested in normal people. I, at least, would love to see Gaga in a “Mask” or a “Suspect.” She and Malek are both near the top of the heap for Oscar nominations. And she’s got an alchemical advantage over Malek’s Freddie Mercury. When Ally’s career takes off, Gaga winds up playing a pop star not unlike herself. And you realize she has the opposite problem that Malek does. You’re less interested in her as a singer — but only because we’ve seen her do huge, stadium-size razzle-dazzle before. And yet she’s indifferent to playing the fame stuff. It doesn’t seem to interest Ally or Gaga. If the movie loses Ally a bit in the second half, Gaga never appears lost. She’s giving a serious, considered, committed performance of a person she seems to know. Malek’s commitment is to a movie committed in the wrong proportions. It doesn’t know who it wants Freddie Mercury to be. “Bohemian Rhapsody” doesn’t fixate on the showmanship until the finale, which restages their electric, legendary Live-Aid performance at Wembly Stadium and passes for showstopping. Yet you exit hungry for a movie that gets closer to the bottom of a man who renamed himself after both an element and a planet. If someone dares take another crack (and someone really should), I know the perfect Freddie. Her first name is Lady. And her last name comes straight from a Queen song. "

COLONIZED DREAMS: A MIPSTERZ EVENT at the Knockdown Center (March 9, 6:30 p.m.). Mipsterz, a collective whose name merges “Muslim” and “hipsters,” is led by the filmmaker Abbas Rattani, the illustrator Sara Alfageeh and the musician Yusuf Siddiquee and promotes the work of Muslim artists across genres. For this showcase, the group has curated a lineup of Muslim musicians, writers and artists who are mostly from New York. Humeysha, the musical alias of the Brooklyn-based singer-songwriter Zain Alam, blends spacey indie rock with more traditional Indian sounds from instruments like the tabla and puja bells. The D.J. Ayes Cold connects bhangra music with hip-hop and R&B, while the Lebanese-American percussionist Adam Maalouf performs mostly on the pantam, an instrument created from the Trinidadian steel pan and southern India’s ghatam drum. 718-489-6285, knockdown.center MATTHEW DEAR at Elsewhere (March 8, 7 p.m.). A founding artist of the trendy electronic music label Ghostly International, Dear is better known as a bandleader, producer and D.J. whose work is steeped in Detroit techno. He has remixed songs for the likes of the XX and Spoon, and as a soloist, his work has long incorporated nearly equal parts electronic effects and live performance. On his latest album, 2018’s “Bunny,” which features Tegan and Sara and Greg Ahee from Protomartyr, Dear’s voice and songwriting give a more personal dimension to his reliably left-of-center yet dance-floor-ready beats.elsewherebrooklyn.com LITTLE FEAT at the Beacon Theater (March 8, 8 p.m.). At the half-century mark, a number of the musicians behind Little Feat’s best-known songs are still with the group, including the co-founder and pianist Bill Payne, the guitarist Paul Barrere, the percussionist Sam Clayton and the bassist Kenny Gradney. For this celebration of their 50 years onstage, expect a career-spanning retrospective that shows the range of this tricky-to-pin-down band, whose work spans country, funk, R&B and more. Regardless of what they’re playing, though, Little Feat have long been celebrated for their live act. 212-465-6000, beacontheatre.com [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] MEEK MILL at Hammerstein Ballroom (March 12-13, 8 p.m.). This Philadelphia-born rapper’s rise could hardly be more antithetical to 2019’s standard rap narrativeof getting discovered on SoundCloud by a major label, and then steering toward viral fame with the label’s help. Instead, Meek Mill took the long way to the top, first gaining credibility as a battle rapper and flirting with mainstream success, which was derailed by protracted legal battles and stints in prison. The strength of the work from the early years of his career, though — especially “Dreams and Nightmares,” the album cut that has become every underdog’s anthem, and the rapper’s best-known song — helped him push through. Finally, he is back in the world and back on the road. Both shows are sold out, but tickets are available through the resale market. 212-279-7740, mc34.com ROBYN at Madison Square Garden (March 8, 7 p.m.). “I was like, I’m not going to write one single sad love song,” this Swedish pop singer told The New York Times of her latest album, “Honey.” “And then when I started writing, it was sad love song, sad love song, sad love song. But it’s in a different way.” Robyn has spent over two decades turning those sad love songs into nightclub gold, in iterations that have made her both a Billboard hit maker (“Show Me Love” and “Do You Know (What It Takes)” and a cult favorite (“Call Your Girlfriend” and “Dancing on My Own”). 212-465-6741, msg.com WEEZER AND PIXIES at Madison Square Garden (March 12, 7 p.m.). These joint headliners offer some of the most enduring indie rock of the 1980s and ’90s — and TV on the Radio, who are opening, will represent the 2000s. Weezer have continued to release albums at a fairly prolific clip and still own a significant chunk of the alt-rock canon, from “Say It Ain’t So” to “Hash Pipe.” Their most recent brushes with the mainstream, though, have been less expected — namely, a viral cover of Toto’s “Africa.” After playing three nights at the comparatively cozy Brooklyn Steel last November, Pixies are bringing their unorthodox noise pop back to one of the city’s biggest stages.212-465-6741, msg.com NATALIE WEINER EZRA COLLECTIVE at Rough Trade NYC (March 9, 8:30 p.m.). Afrobeat from the 1970s, woozy new R&B, dub reggae and classic backpacker hip-hop all help define the sound of this London-based band’s new disc, “You Can’t Steal My Joy,” due next month. They have become something of a sensation, and the album is likely to be one of the year’s most-talked-about releases from Britain’s thriving contemporary jazz scene. The group — which features the brothers T. J. and Femi Koleoso on bass and drums, respectively; Joe Armon-Jones on keyboards; Dylan Jones on trumpet; and James Mollison on saxophone — will play material from the coming disc at this Brooklyn rock club.roughtradenyc.com VIJAY IYER AND CRAIG TABORN at Roulette (March 12, 8 p.m.). Two leading jazz pianists in their late 40s, Iyer and Taborn each have their own specific formulas, but both are built on a mix of studious abstraction and propulsive weight. Next week they will release their first album as a duo, the expansive, richly improvised “The Transitory Poems,” on ECM Records. The crystalline scatter of Taborn’s playing meets Iyer’s slightly thicker articulation in a sympathetic repartee; the pair seem to constantly divert their own path. They celebrate the album’s arrival at this concert, playing on two grand pianos.917-267-0368, roulette.org ‘IDENTITY: FREEDOM’ at the Kitchen (March 7-9, 8 p.m.). The nonprofit organization Arts for Art organized this series of concerts to highlight some of free jazz’s most respected elders, all of whom are presenting suite-length original works here. The festival begins on Thursday with “Trail of Tears Continuum (1492-2019),” a 90-minute piece composed by the bassist William Parker (a founder of Arts for Art) featuring singers, poets and a five-piece instrumental group, as well as a film component. On Friday, the pianist Dave Burrell debuts “Harlem Renaissance,” a response to the life and work of the dancer Josephine Baker; Burrell’s sextet will play in conversation with two dancers, Marguerite Hemmings and J’royce Jata. The series concludes on Saturday with a presentation of Andrew Cyrille’s “Haitian Fascination” project, in which this storied drummer fuses the music of Haiti — his ancestral home — with avant-garde jazz.212-255-5793, thekitchen.org MIYA MASAOKA at the Park Avenue Armory (March 13, 7 and 9 p.m.). Masaoka’s style on the koto, a long, stringed instrument from Japan, bespeaks deep equanimity: She is comfortable allowing vast amounts of open space — playing quietly, just a few notes at a time — but within that serene composure she strategically builds a feeling of tensile anticipation. You can lie down and stretch out inside her music, but you can’t ever get completely comfortable. An eclectic collaborator across the worlds of traditional and avant-garde music, at the armory she debuts “The Long Arc of Time,” a work inspired by traditional Japanese Buddhist chants and by the poetry of Tracie Morris. The performance will feature Masaoka alongside fellow Japanese and American musicians and the soprano Kamala Sankaram.212-616-3930, armoryonpark.org OMAR SOSA AND SECKOU KEITA at Merkin Hall (March 9, 7:30 p.m.). Sosa, a Cuban pianist of great percussive power and fluid grace, released a collaborative album in 2017 with Keita, a Senegalese master of the kora (a West African stringed instrument typically used to create spiraling layers of rhythm), and the Venezuelan percussionist Gustavo Ovalles. Here the trio will perform some of the pristine, soothing music from that release. All three of these musicians now live in Europe, so a New York sighting is rare — especially featuring all of them together.212-501-3330, kaufmanmusiccenter.org KAMAAL WILLIAMS at Le Poisson Rouge (March 9, 7:30 p.m.). This young keyboardist crafts tightly woven grooves that are equally influenced by the cosmic soul-jazz of the 1970s as they are by the broken-beat and nu-jazz traditions of his native London. Partly thanks to his work in the short-lived but widely acclaimed duo Yussef Kamaal, Williams finds himself at the front of a crowded pack of young keyboardists on the busy British scene. Here he’s likely to draw heavily on the material from his debut solo album, last year’s Herbie Hancock-indebted “The Return.”212-505-3474, lpr.com MIGUEL ZENÓN at the Village Vanguard (March 12-17, 8:30 and 10:30 p.m.). One of the most casually prodigious alto saxophonists of today, Zenón devotes most of his creative energy to exploring the music of his native Puerto Rico, always through a vigorously intellectual lens. Last year he released a striking album, “Yo Soy La Tradición,” featuring music sourced largely from Puerto Rican folk traditions, retrofitted for saxophone and string quartet. And later this month, he will join up again with his longstanding jazz quartet to record a new album devoted to the music of Ismael Rivera, a heroic popular vocalist in Puerto Rico during the late 1960s and the ’70s. At this Vanguard run, the group — featuring Luis Perdomo on piano, Hans Glawischnig on bass and Henry Cole on drums — will set about breaking in this new material.212-255-4037, villagevanguard.comGIOVANNI RUSSONELLO LOU REED DRONES at the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine (March 13, 6:30 p.m.). Physics and music nerds, unite and rejoice! The moment you have been collectively awaiting has arrived: A handful of Lou Reed’s guitars, curated by his technician Stewart Hurwood, will be arranged against a stack of amplifiers and tuned to create a glorious noise that will morph as you wander about in this acoustically splendid cathedral. Holy feedback! It should be glorious.stjohndivine.org/calendarDANIELLE DOWLING "
5c3d9ee23a125f5075c04708,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/15/arts/music/yannick-nezet-seguin-met-opera-gay.html,"It wasn’t love at first sight when Yannick Nézet-Séguin, the new music director of the Metropolitan Opera, and his partner, Pierre Tourville, met as students at the Montreal Conservatory almost 25 years ago. “I felt I needed to emancipate, to get out of my parents’ place, as one does at 20,” Mr. Nézet-Séguin said recently at Julius’, the West Village gay bar. “And so we were just roommates.” “You and your best friend,” he said, turning to Mr. Tourville, “she and you were looking, and I said, ‘I’m going to be your roommate.’” Mr. Tourville, a violist, was dating, he admitted with a laugh, “many people at the same time.” Mr. Nézet-Séguin was in a four-year relationship — with a woman. But did Mr. Tourville seriously think Mr. Nézet-Séguin was straight? “Not for very long,” Mr. Tourville deadpanned. “It became pretty clear. Quickly.” It’s not unusual to share meet-cute stories over cheap cocktails at Julius’, one of the oldest and coziest gay bars in the city. But it was an extraordinary conversation to be having with the music director of the nation’s largest performing arts institution. While culture — particularly high culture — is indelibly associated with gay tastemakers, audiences and creators, it’s a sign of how outmoded our conception of authority is that remarkably few major performing arts leaders have been openly gay. In classical music and opera, even New York, the city that gave rise to the modern gay rights movement with the Stonewall riots 50 years ago this June, has been dominated since then by two conductors: Leonard Bernstein and James Levine, who both kept sexual relationships with men hidden. So chatting casually about coming out, bullying and Celine Dion with Mr. Nézet-Séguin and Mr. Tourville was a sign that a new generation is coming to power, one for which sexual orientation is far less fraught. And it adds to the sense that Mr. Nézet-Séguin, 43, who is conducting Debussy’s “Pelléas et Mélisande” at the Met through Jan. 31, represents a milestone, and not just for opera. Despite gay pioneers like Michael Tilson Thomas (at the San Francisco Symphony) and Marin Alsop (in Baltimore), conducting remains an overwhelmingly straight (and male, and white) profession. As throughout society — business, politics, sports — music has struggled to produce and promote leaders outside of the traditional mold. It doesn’t help that the field is by its nature past-loving and has major centers in countries like Italy and Russia, where reactionary values still reign. “Orchestras and opera companies are microcosms of our society and our world, and this is a representation of it,” said Deborah Borda, the president and chief executive of the New York Philharmonic, and the partner of Coralie Toevs, the Met’s development chief. “If you think about Western society, the epitome of leadership — and people go around teaching courses on this — is a conductor. And the model is Toscanini: a man who stands on the podium, has total authority and simply tells people what to do. He is grand, and white, and fully patriarchal.” Mr. Levine, Mr. Nézet-Séguin’s predecessor at the Met, was fired last year after a company investigation found evidence of sexual misconduct. He has denied the accusations, but no one disputes that he has always been fiercely guarded about his personal life. The contrast with Mr. Nézet-Séguin — who has been openly gay for his entire professional career and nonchalant enough about it to post a smiling partners’ beach selfie on Instagram — is impossible to miss. “The fact that he’s so comfortable with who he is is part of what makes him a powerful, effective artistic leader,” Peter Gelb, the Met’s general manager, said in an interview. “Because he is proud of who he is, and that’s very important.” While he hasn’t wanted to make what he called “a big fuss” about his relationship, Mr. Nézet-Séguin sees himself and Mr. Tourville as symbolic of a widening conception of what a conductor can be. “It’s becoming more important for me,” he said, “to just realize that both of us, we can be examples, in a way, to inspire young musicians who fear that this is going to be a problem in their profession and career advancement. And I want to embrace that role more and more.” “Just by being, and by living our life,” he added, “this is hopefully something that breaks the preconceived ideas.” The two men both grew up in Quebec, Mr. Nézet-Séguin in Montreal and Mr. Tourville in Trois-Rivières. Even if it was perhaps unusual to declare, at 10, that he wanted to be a conductor, Mr. Nézet-Séguin said he was spared teasing. But Mr. Tourville was bullied so badly that he changed high schools in his second year. Sexual orientation, Mr. Tourville said, isn’t “clear at that age, but they feel you’re different. It was more about: I played music, I was good at school. I was different, more sensitive.” Mr. Nézet-Séguin recalled the transition from long-term heterosexual relationship to openly dating his male roommate in the mid-1990s as reasonably smooth. “There was no crisis with it,” he said, waiting a beat: “I mean, there was some surprise.” When they announced to both pairs of parents that they were a couple, the news was well received, though Mr. Nézet-Séguin allowed that “I can’t say it was necessarily only easy.” Mr. Tourville interjected that perhaps it wasn’t “the happiest moment of their life.” But, Mr. Nézet-Séguin added, “in both cases it didn’t affect the connection.” (His mother still handles his website and his schedule in Canada; his father manages the finances.) In those early years, Mr. Tourville was the breadwinner, with checks coming in as a freelance violist, while Mr. Nézet-Séguin toiled as a piano accompanist. They fondly recalled a $20 all-you-can-eat pasta deal on Tuesday nights at a local restaurant. “We had these dinners where we said: Oh, one day we’re going to go to Vienna, one day we’re going to go to Paris,” Mr. Nézet-Séguin said. “That was part of the dream.” They started a Baroque music ensemble, corralling players and pasting together scores in all-night marathons. Mr. Nézet-Séguin began to build his conducting career in Canada. In 2000, he became music director of the Orchestre Métropolitain in Montreal — and, in 2003, Mr. Tourville’s boss there. (Yes, it’s a bit awkward and stressful for your partner to try out for a viola seat in the orchestra you conduct, even if the audition is blind. “Of course, as soon as he did one note I recognized it,” Mr. Nézet-Séguin said.) Both of them still have their positions with the orchestra, and the arrangement has proved an ideal one: The ensemble is part-time, allowing Mr. Tourville to travel with Mr. Nézet-Séguin. “It’s kind of a package deal, I guess,” Mr. Tourville said. “When Yannick is there, most of the time I’m there, too.” They have been pleasantly surprised at having Mr. Tourville mentioned in the public ceremonies that introduced Mr. Nézet-Séguin as music director of the Rotterdam Philharmonic (a position he held through last year) and the Philadelphia Orchestra (where his contract has been extended until 2026). Mr. Tourville was an important factor in Mr. Nézet-Séguin’s decision to concentrate on Philadelphia, New York and Montreal, and to curtail his work in Europe for the time being. “There’s a lot of difference between, door to door, three and a half hours and no jet lag, compared to, like, 10 hours and you arrive and can’t do anything for three days,” Mr. Tourville said. “It was becoming a little crazy.” With much of their furniture from Rotterdam — including a Zaha Hadid “moon” sofa — en route to their rental apartment near Lincoln Center, things will be a lot less crazy in the coming years. “I think we’re more and more jealous of our very private time,” Mr. Tourville said. “And we like to have just cozy nights at home with a good meal, a cooked meal, and watching HGTV. That’s the ideal night.” Mr. Tourville referred with a laugh to the trope of “conductor wives,” who imperiously attend even rehearsals. He sticks to performances. “I think I know him well enough,” he said of Mr. Nézet-Séguin, “to know when he’s trying something or being unnatural, musically.” And is Mr. Tourville right when he intervenes? Mr. Nézet-Séguin smiled: “Always.” So Mr. Tourville will be an important adviser as Mr. Nézet-Séguin turns the page on the Levine era, not just symbolically but also musically. “The basic presence of the orchestral sound is not exactly what I imagine it can be,” Mr. Nézet-Séguin said, in his most detailed public comments yet about his intentions for the Met’s orchestra. “I think it’s a little too dry and lifeless in piano, and I think that in forte it’s just maybe unbalanced internally.” For the company’s recent new production of “La Traviata,” he said, he worked with the ensemble on “a much richer sound, resonant, pizzicato, bass-oriented. Cellos and basses: I’m a lot about what they need to do. Not because they’re not good, but because for years they’ve been asked to be as short and light as possible.” “That was the conception of sound of my predecessor,” he added. “I just have a totally different idea, and we miss very often the fundamental of the harmony. Whenever it’s a little bit longer and richer and with more vibrato, it changes completely the aural spectrum.” A wholly different kind of aural spectrum — and a spectacle that was queer even by opera standards — was on display in October, when Mr. Nézet-Séguin was featured on the Canadian national television show “En Direct de l’Univers,” a kind of “This Is Your Life” told through the people and music you love. His nieces and nephews were on, as were his parents and trainer. Rufus Wainwright sang a few songs. But the climax was a duet: the Jacques Brel number “Quand On N’a Que L’Amour” (“When Love Is All You Have”), with Mr. Tourville joined remotely by none other than Celine Dion. Mr. Nézet-Séguin cried — mostly, he said, “because I was watching Pierre sing a duet with his idol.” The couple is not married, but for a gay union, there could hardly have been a more sacred ceremony. “It made an impact,” Mr. Nézet-Séguin said. “We did not realize that, and yet it made an impact. Hey, two guys sang their love, with Celine blessing it.” "
5c351f133a125f5075c036b7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/08/t-magazine/steve-gunn-sachiko-kanenobu.html,"The American musician Steve Gunn first heard of Sachiko Kanenobu a few years ago, when, at the advice of friends, he listened to her debut album “Misora,” recorded in Tokyo in 1972. Gunn, 41, is best known for his neo-folk guitar playing (and as a former member of Kurt Vile’s backing band, the Violators) and has more recently moved into producing albums for like-minded artists. He was instantly taken with Kanenobu’s lush guitar playing and multilayered psychedelic melodies, joining the singer-songwriter’s small but devoted fan base. Born in Osaka in 1948, Kanenobu started to garner attention in her late teens within her country’s burgeoning folk scene. But the year of her album’s release — and before her fame took hold — she quietly moved to New York City with Paul Williams, the music journalist and founder of Crawdaddy magazine, to start a family. Now based in California, she makes music on and off, both solo and with groups, returning periodically to Japan to perform. In 2017, Gunn rediscovered Kanenobu by chance when he heard an interview with her on WFMU radio in New York City, where he’s based; ultimately, a mutual friend connected the two musicians and a creative relationship flourished by text message. Next month, Kanenobu will perform songs from “Misora” for the first time in the States, opening a handful of Gunn’s tour dates tied to the release of his upcoming album, “The Unseen in Between.” Written in the wake of his father’s passing, the songs are sweeping, with intricate finger picking and rich instrumentation, the lyrics meditative and intimate. Gunn also pushed for the reissue of “Misora,” which is slated for next year.  Ahead of all of this, the pair sat down at the kitchen table in Kanenobu’s home in Northern California to discuss their origins, the writing process and their varied inspirations. Steve Gunn: Sachiko, you just came back from Japan. Sachiko Kanenobu: Yes, it was a very special performance. I performed my “Misora” album in Japan, and I’ve never played that album before in public — and it’s 46 years after it was released. I went back to do this concert. It sold out the same month it was announced. I thought, “Wow there are going to be lots of gray-haired people,” but there were so many young people. I was shocked. To me, it’s like I rose from death, like they are seeing a ghost or something. [Laughs] I’m so excited to perform from that album with you — it’s one of my dreams. You really inspired me to play my guitar again. Each time before I play now, I put on your YouTube videos. Your music is just so calm. I’m 70 years old now, and I need that calm energy. Gunn: I do, too, it’s a big part of my music. Kanenobu: You also have a kind of psychedelic quality. That’s what really got me, because I grew up with that type of music, like the Beatles and such. I’ve been in California since 1976, and I lived in New York before that. I got there in 1972. Gunn: You were so steeped in music because of your relationship with Paul Williams. Kanenobu: Paul brought Bruce Springsteen to come see us in New York — it was very early on. He sang two songs for us with an acoustic guitar, that’s an amazing memory. Also, I met Bob Dylan — much later, though, when I was living in California. It was at a ball field in San Francisco, around 1980. Gunn: Had he known Paul? Kanenobu: Yes — and it was a very special concert because Bob Dylan was like a born-again Christian. He had these wonderful backup singers. However, the audience didn’t like it. It was terrible. They booed him. Paul and I went to see him at the end and we talked. I said, “Why do people do that?” And Bob Dylan said, “Change your style and they don’t like it.” Gunn: When I had met you in Sonoma last year and we were kind of becoming friends — and I started talking to you about this label, Light in the Attic, which is going to reissue “Misora” — I told my record-nerd friends that we hung out. And they were like, “Wait, what?” No one really believed me. I don’t think a lot of people knew that you were living in California or in the States. Kanenobu: In 1972, when I first moved to New York, I wasn’t making music because I had two babies, you know. I was mostly taking care of the kids. But Paul played music all the time and I was getting into that. Gunn: When did you start writing music again? Kanenobu: Really when I met Philip K. Dick. He changed my life and got me to play music again. Paul took me to meet Phil when he was living in Sonoma with his girlfriend. He asked, “Are you still writing songs?” I said, “No, I’m very busy, you know?” And he said, “You shouldn’t stop writing, you have a gift.” He made my eyes all jumbly. I was so touched, and felt so deeply. He really illuminated my heart and soul. T: Is it true he started producing one of your records before he died? Kanenobu: He did. He did one single record, “Fork in the Road / Tokyo Song.” At one point, Paul and I drove all the way to see Phil in Santa Ana, where he lived and brought him an older record of mine — he had this big fancy player — but when we tried to put it on, it didn’t work. Phil was really angry. He said, “I’m going to throw this whole system out the window,” and he really started picking it up, but we stopped him. Later, we played him the album and he loved it.  I wrote some new English songs after Phil had told me I should, instead of in Japanese. He started talking about making an album together — he would produce it and he’d be in the studio this time. That was 1982, around February. I was so excited, and then he died in March. It was so sad, the darkest time in my life. He was like my muse. He always called me and encouraged me and read me short stories and made me laugh. I am actually writing a book about the whole thing.  Steve, what was it like working on your new album? Gunn: Well, my producer, James Elkington, is someone that I’ve been playing music with for a bunch of years now, he and I became fast friends. I met him on the road. He’s from England and lived in London in the ’80s, so he’s kind of steeped in this English punk tradition, but he also knows a lot about the folk traditions from England. I’m a pretty idiosyncratic player, and I’ve got my own kind of self-taught style. I think if I was thrown into certain situations people might not really understand where I’m coming from. Jim really understood, he knew exactly what I wanted to do with the album, which was basically record it like the albums that I admire from the ’60s and ’70s, where you kind of hear the band playing live. I wanted this sort of live spontaneity to it. We also had the bassist Tony Garnier — he plays with Bob Dylan — and Daniel Schlett, the owner of the studio. We’re all sort of Dylan fanatics. Kanenobu: Steve, what inspires you? Gunn: I studied art history in college, and when I ended up moving to New York, I worked at a lot of art galleries and was kind of an art handler — I ended up moving a ton of artists’ works and in the process became educated in a lot of minimal artists from the ’60s. Some of them were very interested in music and also were musicians themselves. And a lot of their philosophies correlated with some of the things that I was exploring. Kanenobu: When I was in high school, I used to listen to this album by Donovan, and I actually tried to imitate him. [Laughs] Gunn: Do you remember what album? Kanenobu: The first one, I think. I tried copying it, but it was so difficult, and so I just created my songs out of attempting to play like that. In Japan around 1967, it was all folk and pop music — Peter, Paul and Mary, Pete Seeger, bands like that. Later, I got into the Okinawa scale, which is a unique scale, and not very Japanese in style. And then Takashi Nishioka from the band Five Red Balloons said, “Why don’t you come over and listen to this record? Don’t you feel like it’s kind of what you’re doing?” And it was Joni Mitchell. Then I got influenced by Bob Dylan, of course — I love his words. I started reading his song book and it was kind of like my bible. I also got into the group Pentangle. Gunn: Another favorite of mine. Kanenobu: I got into the guitar, more than the singing. I’m still not a great singer. Gunn: For me, I didn’t sing until later. At first, I was practicing guitar and learning different things and improvising. I got really into playing long-form meditative-style pieces. Also classical Indian music was influential to me. I was trying to figure out how to use that influence and I knew that people in the ’60s used that style, particularly a guitar player named Sandy Bull. When I heard his piece called “Blend,” I kind of emulated that for a number of years and was playing with different kinds of open tunings. T: Are you currently working on new music? Kanenobu: Yes, I’m working on new songs and it’s so exciting because, you know, I thought, “Wow, I’m dead.” Gunn: When “Misora” came out, did you play any shows, or did it just come out and you had already moved on from that? Kanenobu: I’d been playing for a few years before that came out. It’s interesting with that album because everyone said, “Oh, it’s a woman.” You know, back then, there were no women singing with an acoustic guitar. I remember in particular a performance I did in Germany in the late ’80s with my band Culture Shock. I can’t describe it, it was really amazing — everybody was one. I said “I love you” and everyone in the room said back, “I love you.” [Laughs] To me, when you play, it’s very important to give people goodness. Gunn: What’s also interesting for me, with your story, is all of the connections you’ve made throughout your life and how music particularly played a role in it. You can link these experiences because you picked up a guitar when you were a teenager. Kanenobu: If you’re curious and love something, when you get into it and express yourself, that’s what life is about. This interview has been edited and condensed. "
5c2e4da63a125f5075c02b59,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/03/arts/music/sharon-van-etten-remind-me-tomorrow-interview.html,"On a late November morning, the laid-back version of Sharon Van Etten serving coffee from a thermos at a quiet kitchen table was both a miracle and an illusion. Toys piled in a corner and a rocking chair from her own childhood revealed the momentary absence of a toddler, but little else betrayed the mix of chaos and ambition swirling just below the surface of Van Etten’s picturesque Brooklyn life. In a few hours, she would fly to Los Angeles to film a quick scene for the second season of “The OA,” the Netflix show that became her first professional acting job in 2016. On the way, she would use the quiet hours away from her young son to study for the final exams that loomed as she continued to pursue an undergraduate degree in psychology. There was also a new script that needed reading and an experimental film score in the works, but those were just the side gigs. At the same time, Van Etten, 37, was in the midst of returning to her day job as a singer-songwriter, plotting a music video shoot, getting ready for a tour set to begin in February and awaiting the imminent delivery of the finished vinyl for her fifth studio LP, out Jan. 18 via Jagjaguwar. Though typically understated, the album’s title, “Remind Me Tomorrow,” nods at Van Etten’s current juggling act — a tongue-in-cheek mantra for a multitasking mother who also happens to run the small business that is an independent band. [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] “Crazy, crazy, crazy,” Van Etten said, taking in the scope of her hectic but life-affirming last three years, which, ironically enough, began when she tried to press pause on her music career. “I can’t even believe we’ve done what we’ve done.” It’s Van Etten’s now-frequent use of we and our in conversation that best mark her transition from a solitary, searching singer, known for her languid, almost gothic breakup songs, to something fuller and less fragile — someone to be counted on, someone in charge of things. Together with her romantic partner, Zeke Hutchins, who was once her drummer and now works as her manager, Van Etten has undertaken what the couple characterizes as various adventures — acting, school, scoring, parenthood — each of which adds to her ongoing project: becoming a more well-rounded, more empathetic artist. “So much of creative work today is all about like, the solitary genius and sudden rise,” said Zal Batmanglij, who directed Van Etten in “The OA,” the Netflix sci-fi series. “But it’s the people who actually do the work, day in and day out, that are special. They’re after something deeper, their work gets better — things that aren’t necessarily super-fashionable right now. They last the test of time. That’s everyone’s reaction to Sharon.” “Remind Me Tomorrow” represents the singer’s journal on the path to getting whole. Nearly a decade on from her spare 2009 debut, “Because I Was in Love” — powerfully sad funeral dirges for the ghosts of toxic relationships — the new album embraces optimism, even when it sounds like end times. Written initially as love songs to Hutchins, the tracks only intensified as Van Etten finished the lyrics after giving birth, often working with headphones while staring at her napping son, who turns 2 in the spring. “It’s about my love and my fear and about me wanting to be better, but doubting myself a little bit,” said Van Etten, who has an easy, disarming manner that quickly brings people close. “It’s my job to be strong and positive so that he feels safe and protected, even given the state of the world.” (Van Etten, who was pregnant during the election of President Trump, recalled “trying not to cry because I didn’t want the baby to absorb my emotions.”) As she has expanded her artistic endeavors and emotional registers, Van Etten also found a fresh musical palette. While her early, softly strummed guitar songs were often gorgeous despite their brokenness, “Remind Me Tomorrow,” an album of hope, intimacy and perseverance, has jagged edges and a brooding swagger, built around droning synths and a propulsive rhythm section of studio musicians. “I just wanted to do something different,” she said. “And the band setup bored me so much: ‘This is where the bass comes in, this is where the drums kick in …’” She continued: “I love the slow build — that’s what I do. But I found that I was more drawn to the darkness and the driven synths and the syncopated beats.” Much of Van Etten’s recent evolution can be traced back to Nick Cave. She cited the Australian rock singer’s drone-heavy “Skeleton Tree,” from 2016, along with avant-garde and electronic acts like Suicide and Portishead, while seeking her new sound. But Cave had a less direct impact, as well: It was on tour opening for him in 2013 that she and Hutchins became something more than collaborators. “When we realized we fell in love, we were like, O.K., we have to go home and figure out our lives and then make this record and we’ll come back to this and see how we feel,” she said, referring to “Are We There,” her previous release, from 2014. “It was the most adult thing. And the most torturous thing we could’ve done to ourselves.” On that same tour with Cave, Van Etten was noticed by a casting director who would later swoop in to disrupt her life further. Following many months on the road in support of “Are We There,” Van Etten began feeling detached from her music and exhausted by the constant grind of performing heartbreak professionally. But inspired by her immediately intimate rapport with often-wounded fans after shows, she decided to take a moment away from music to finish her bachelor’s degree with the hope of becoming a licensed mental health counselor. As she and Hutchins settled into their new relationship, Van Etten enrolled at Brooklyn College, alive with the possibility of a new life chapter. Two weeks into her first semester, she got a call asking her to audition for “The OA.” “I almost didn’t take it,” Van Etten recalled. “I was doing this big dramatic pause with my band to go back to school and now I’m going to act? I’m such a phony!” She’d been in “West Side Story” in high school in New Jersey, where she grew up the middle child of five. But distant dreams of Broadway aside, Hollywood was never a goal. To Hutchins, however, the show sounded like an adventure. In the script, the role of Rachel, one of four damaged captives kept in glass cages by a mysterious scientist, called for “the voice of an angel.” Brit Marling, who stars in “The OA” and created the show with Batmanglij, recalled being floored by a video of Van Etten’s audition, in which she delivered a dramatic monologue and then sang a cappella, opting for “I Wish I Knew,” the opening song from her first album. “When you watched her do the monologue what you felt is that she was not acting — and that’s the highest compliment you can pay an actor,” Marling said. “She’s an incredible artist and thinker and feels everything viscerally. It comes out in her music and in how she acts. There’s just no phoniness. It’s all real.” Batmanglij added of Van Etten: “She could tap into something — these deep reservoirs of empathy. She can make herself vulnerable.” She took the role, agreeing to defer her college enrollment. But the detours just kept coming. In addition to eventually getting pregnant and performing on an episode of David Lynch’s “Twin Peaks” revival, Van Etten signed on to compose the score for the filmmaker Katherine Dieckmann’s “Strange Weather,” working out of a practice space that she shared with the actor and musician Michael Cera. It was there, Van Etten was comforted to discover, that she could not help but write songs. “It’s still an outlet for me,” she said. “It’s my therapy.” Van Etten found herself gravitating to Cera’s Roland Jupiter 4 synthesizer, and writing more on keys when not working on the film. By 2017, she had a folder of more than 40 demos, including what she described as a whole country album and another of only piano ballads. But the batch that became “Remind Me Tomorrow” was the most experimental, with sonic references that were “the sort of things you don’t think of when you think of Sharon Van Etten,” said the producer John Congleton, who would go on to oversee the recording sessions in Los Angeles. “She seemed particularly excited that I was going for it,” said Congleton, who likened the new songs to abstract tone poems. “I wasn’t trying to make it Americana, or normalize it,” he added. “I wasn’t trying to wrangle her — I was embracing the wildness.” That allowed a churning track like “Jupiter 4” — with plain-spoken romantic lyrics like “I’ve been waiting, waiting, waiting/my whole life for someone like you” — to come with a musical layer of dread, the kind that encapsulates how terrifying it is to fall in love and put down roots. (Van Etten’s composition was also recorded as “Jupiter,” an ’80s-ish pop jam, by the singer Donna Missal.) Other love songs on the album, like “Comeback Kid” and “Seventeen,” feel aimed at Van Etten’s younger self. While much of her songwriting output has been viewed through the lens of her earliest public origin story — an abusive relationship with a man who tried to stamp out her creative impulses — Van Etten’s new work is less about picking at tender scabs than the faded scars that served as a road map to now. “I think reflection is important,” she said, “but taking those experiences and moving forward is how I’ve gotten to be here.” She added: “It’s because of everything I’ve gone through that I’m a stronger person and was open and ready enough to accept the right kind of love into my life.” On the almost-Springsteen-esque “Seventeen,” she sings: Down beneath the ashes and stone,Sure of what I’ve lived and have known.I see you so uncomfortably alone. Wish I could show you how much you’ve grown. A few days after our first meeting, Van Etten was facing that nostalgia head-on as she scouted locations from her past for the track’s upcoming music video shoot. There were long-closed clubs on the Lower East Side, where she played some of her first shows, along with her early New York apartments sourced on Craigslist and too close to the rattling subway. Van Etten laughed about seeing her “hazy past in daylight,” but the stroll through memories was also something of a goodbye, as she and Hutchins had agreed that a move to Los Angeles in the new year was probably best for raising a child. “I’ve worked so hard to live here and now I can’t afford it,” she said. “The New York story.” But it wasn’t a tragedy. Van Etten said she was open to more acting following her forthcoming appearance in the second season of “The OA,” and has been working on writing comedy, including a personal project about a mother’s relationship with her babysitters. She even recently tried stand-up. And though she would most likely not have time to return to school until 2020, Van Etten added that she’s sticking to her plan to become a therapist by the age of 50. “By then,” she said, “I’ll want to settle down.” "
5c6fba6f3a125f5075c0af74,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/22/arts/what-to-see-in-new-york-city-this-spring.html,"Broadway, Wagner’s “Ring,” the opening of the Shed: what our critics and writers are looking forward to this season. ‘TOOTSIE’ What’s wrong with musical comedy? Generally, the music. And the comedy. Which may be why most of the best musicals of the last decade — “Fun Home,” “Hamilton,” “The Band’s Visit” — have been serious indeed. The art of being funny on the beat is mostly a lost one. But David Yazbek, the songwriter behind the musical comedies “Dirty Rotten Scoundrels” and “The Full Monty,” maintains the magic. Even his score for “The Band’s Visit,” mostly drenched in melancholy, has moments of lyrical hilarity. Let’s just say “marrow” and “pharaoh” never thought of rhyming until he insisted. That’s the top reason (among several) I have high hopes for the stage version of “Tootsie,” arriving at the Marquis Theater on March 29. Based on the 1982 movie about an actor whose stalled career revives only when he pretends to be a woman, it offers both the size and sentiment a musical comedy, in any era, needs for liftoff. JESSE GREEN ‘OKLAHOMA!’ What’s likely to be the freshest, most revolutionary musical on Broadway this season is more than three-quarters of a century old. Its title is “Oklahoma!,” and, yes, that’s the same Rodgers and Hammerstein show about farmers, cowhands and frontier love that was first seen in New York in 1943. But the director Daniel Fish’s revitalizing interpretation, scheduled to open at the Circle in the Square Theater on April 7, asks theatergoers to look at a deeply familiar classic through the eyes of the 21st century. The songs, dialogue and characters remain almost entirely the same. But as it demonstrated during its sold-out run at St. Ann’s Warehouse in Brooklyn last year, Mr. Fish’s version finds provocative depths of darkness amid the prairie sunshine. BEN BRANTLEY ‘INK’ The British actor Bertie Carvel, who wore a dress for his Tony-nominated role as the terrifying schoolmistress Miss Trunchbull in the musical “Matilda” six years ago, is switching to neatly tailored trousers for his return to Broadway. But don’t expect him to be any less intimidating. In James Graham’s “Ink,” which opens in April at the Samuel J. Friedman Theater, Mr. Carvel will be portraying one Rupert Murdoch. And in this London hit about the tabloidization of British journalism, directed by Rupert Goold, any similarities between Mr. Carvel’s character and a certain Australian-born media mogul are definitely not coincidental. BEN BRANTLEY ‘WHAT THE CONSTITUTION MEANS TO ME’ Heidi Schreck’s play about invisible women and the 14th Amendment was electrifyingly topical when it ran Off Broadway last year, amid the national outcry over the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh. Sadly or fortuitously, “What the Constitution Means to Me” is even more urgent as it moves to Broadway, where performances begin on March 14. Its take on abortion as a protected liberty (and a personal turning point) comes smack up against now-Justice Kavanaugh, who signaled, in one of his first opinions, a willingness to reverse Roe v. Wade. But the play is deeper than its timeliness suggests. Though it uses the idea of debate as a touchstone — and ends, deliciously, with a live one — it’s really about how we come to question our most bedrock assumptions about the world. If that makes seeing it almost a civic duty, duty has rarely been so pleasurable. JESSE GREEN ‘THE LEHMAN TRILOGY’ Three Bavarian-born brothers who first set foot on American soil more than 150 years ago are returning to New York next month, accompanied by a centuries-spanning brood of their descendants. Their names are Henry, Emanuel and Mayer, and they — and their seemingly countless kin — will be reincarnated at the Park Avenue Armory in Stefano Massini’s “The Lehman Trilogy,” an epic tale of financial rise and ruin, directed by Sam Mendes. This three-hours-plus production features what is surely the largest cast of characters of any play in town. Yet they are embodied by a mere three, seemingly inexhaustible actors with the power to multiply themselves like amoebas: Simon Russell Beale, Ben Miles and Adam Godley. Though the story they tell — which begins and ends with the world-rocking bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008 — is one of entropy, the play in which they appear promises to be a resounding testament to the regenerative powers of theater. As befits a sprawling, globe-girdling story of historic transformation, “The Lehman Brothers” has an intricate, multinational pedigree. Mr. Massini’s chronicle of a dynasty begun by emigrants to the United States began life as an Italian radio play before making its stage debut in Paris (in French) in 2013. Its Italian premiere was at the fabled Piccolo Teatro in Milan two years later, when it ran a whopping five hours. Ben Power’s English-language adaptation opened at the National Theater in London last summer, overseen by Mr. Mendes, the very busy stage and film director whose gripping production of Jez Butterworth’s “The Ferryman” is a current hit on Broadway. Mr. Power pared Mr. Massini’s trilogy to a sleek and unexpectedly lyrical three hours (not counting two intermissions) to be performed almost entirely by three actors on an elegant but nearly empty rotating set (by the ever-inventive Es Devlin). Otherwise, empty is hardly a word to be applied to this interpretation, as I can attest from seeing it at the National last July. Mr. Beale, Mr. Miles and Mr. Godley fill the stage to repletion, as they assume the varied forms of the dynasty-founding Henry, Emanuel and Mayer — and all subsequent generations of Lehmans. And their friends, lovers, spouses, customers, rivals, ad infinitum, with a variety that continually astonishes. Unlike investors who lost their fortunes on Wall Street a decade ago, no one who leaves this encounter with the brothers Lehman is likely to walk away feeling poor. BEN BRANTLEY ‘MARYS SEACOLE’ Born in 1805 to a free Jamaican mother and a Scottish father, Mary Seacole grew up to become an international businesswoman and freelance nurse, crossing paths with soldiers, royalty and Florence Nightingale. That would be more than enough material for a straight-ahead bio-drama — but not, it seems, for the always surprising and formally ingenious Jackie Sibblies Drury, whose “Fairview” was one of last year’s best plays. In the deliberately plural “Marys Seacole,” playing through March 24 at LCT3’s Claire Tow Theater, everyone in the six-woman cast is a Mary — or a Merry, a Miriam, a Mamie or the like. The indispensable Quincy Tyler Bernstine appears as the historical Mrs. Seacole in this production directed by Lileana Blain-Cruz. The others, whose characters cross continents and time, help raise a central question of nursing even now: Who takes care of the people who take care of others? JESSE GREEN ‘WHITE NOISE’ No American playwright has contributed more to the churning and ever-evolving conversation about race in these United (and divided) States than Suzan-Lori Parks. This prodigiously imaginative writer, who won a Pulitzer Prize for “Topdog/Underdog,” has addressed the toxic legacy of slavery in a rich assortment of theatrical forms and languages, from the surrealism of her early “The America Play” to the Homeric chronicle “Father Comes Home From the Wars.” Now Ms. Parks is focusing her gaze on interracial friendships in the 21st century with the resonantly titled “White Noise,” which begins previews next month at her longtime home, the Public Theater. Oskar Eustis, the Public’s artistic director, oversees a four-member cast, led by Daveed Diggs (the original Marquis de Lafayette in “Hamilton”) as an African-American man forced to reconsider the depth and danger of the gap between black and white. BEN BRANTLEY ‘MRS. MURRAY’S MENAGERIE’ I’m not sure anyone could have imagined a duller setting for a play than a high school faculty meeting, yet in “Miles for Mary,” the theatrical collective called the Mad Ones turned the banality of the break room into a hilarious and ultimately galvanizing Off Broadway hit. As if to top themselves, the Mad Ones return this spring with “Mrs. Murray’s Menagerie,” set in (a) the 1970s; at (b) a focus group; for (c) a children’s television show. That is all we know, and all we need to know. Except that the Ars Nova production, which begins performances on March 26 at the Greenwich House Theater, features a cast of expertly light-touch farceurs under the direction of Lila Neugebauer, who made “Miles for Mary” so moving behind the laughs. If this is banality, let’s have more! JESSE GREEN THE ‘RING’ The Metropolitan Opera’s high-tech, low-energy production of Wagner’s four-opera “Ring,” which returns for three cycles this spring, has been notable mostly for its snafus. At its first performance — “Das Rheingold,” back in 2010 — the set’s massive array of seesaws malfunctioned near the end, spoiling the gods’ climactic ascent across a rainbow bridge. Another time, the Microsoft Windows logo flashed across the stage instead of the sophisticated projections that distinguish the cycle’s many locales. One performance of “Die Walküre” that was being broadcast live to cinemas worldwide was delayed nearly an hour because the “Machine,” as it became known, wouldn’t cooperate. And that’s not counting the loud creaks and whirs that accompanied its every move. But while the Met claims that the costly Machine — conceived by the production’s director, Robert Lepage — has been tamed, the technical troubles always struck me as distractions from the real problem. All of Mr. Lepage’s spending and innovation resulted in a cycle that was dull, and out of touch with Wagner’s intricately drawn characters and plot. The singers seemed genuinely undirected, lost in front of the set’s imposing mass; the production team was scrambling to make the effects work, but it appeared that relatively little attention had been given to the acting. There were no discernible relationships charted onstage, no drama, no attempt to transmit — let alone interpret for our time — complex themes of power, sacrifice and societal collapse. Indeed, though the set design meant that some singers spent long stretches in a kind of trough, the effects, while wonky, may have been the best part. At the beginning of “Das Rheingold,” bathed in blue light, the 20 enormous planks levitated in silence. Wagner’s long, low E flat began. Then, like the music, the machine began undulating — first slowly, then faster. It truly was the river Rhine. The opening storm of “Die Walküre” similarly came to life: We were in a sky full of dark, rushing clouds; then in the middle of a forest during a snowstorm; then inside a hut glowing with firelight. It was sweeping and evocative. A production crowded with visual stimulation, in which the singers seemed to be left to their own devices? This “Ring” reminded me, more than it probably intended to, of the Met’s hyper-realistic Franco Zeffirelli spectacles of the 1980s. Like Mr. Lepage, Mr. Zeffirelli creates grand spaces in which stick figures are moved around. The shows ignite when you have compelling performers and sink when you don’t. This revival — which Peter Gelb, the Met’s general manger, is mounting after many thought the Machine, last seen in 2013, would be mothballed for good — does indeed have some compelling casting. Christine Goerke, as Brünnhilde, promises more vocal confidence than Deborah Voigt had when the production was new; Greer Grimsley and Michael Volle will each make a capable, articulate Wotan; Philippe Jordan returns to the Met for the first time since 2007 to conduct. Things may well go more smoothly this time around. But will this yet be a Wagner we can believe in? ZACHARY WOOLFE ‘PRISONER OF THE STATE’ “How he mocked me,” a villainous official laments, explaining why he locked away the political prisoner he now wants killed. That chilling line rings out in “prisoner of the state,” the new David Lang opera that reimagines Beethoven’s only opera, “Fidelio”; the New York Philharmonic will give its premiere on June 6.Beethoven’s theme feels as resonant as ever in a country grappling with questions about mass incarceration; immigrants separated from their children at the border; whether the president is answerable to the law; and how inmates were quietly kept without heat or light for days in a federal jail in the middle of New York City. The opera, directed by Elkhanah Pulitzer, will serve as the finale of Jaap van Zweden’s first season as the Philharmonic’s music director, and he will conduct a cast that includes the moving bass-baritone Eric Owens. MICHAEL COOPER ECSTATIC MUSIC FESTIVAL Among its other skills, the Bang on a Can organization  is smart about fund-raising. By soliciting fans to help them commission new works, the collective ensures a reliably expanding repertory for its in-house chamber ensemble, the Bang on a Can All-Stars. The latest batch of these “People’s Commissioning Fund” pieces comes to the Ecstatic Music Festival at Merkin Concert Hall on March 6. Fresh music by Nicole Lizée and Pulitzer Prize-winner Henry Threadgill will share a bill with vintage works by Annie Gosfield and Glenn Branca, who died last year. The evening’s theme is music for dancing, which Mr. Threadgill has previously explored with his Society Situation Dance Band. If you can’t make it to the concert, you can tune in for a live webcast, on newsounds.org. SETH COLTER WALLS MITSUKO UCHIDA It’s easy to forget that the piano is a percussion instrument when it’s played by Mitsuko Uchida. She animates it with both symphonic might and enchanting lyricism — a perfect fit for the vast emotional range and singing melodies of Schubert. Ms. Uchida recorded one of the finest cycles of Schubert’ssonatas, and she has been revisiting portions, the late works, in a survey at Carnegie Hall. That comes to an end this spring, with two recitals on April 30 and May 4. Endings are very much part of both programs. They are almost stages of grief: The Sonata No. 20 in A (D. 959) contains an abruptly tumultuous passage, like a petulant tantrum, then the heart-rending Sonata No. 21 in B flat (D. 960) offers bittersweet acceptance. JOSHUA BARONE THE SHED The Shed has a modest name and enormous ambitions. Opening April 5, it’s the cultural component of the gigantic Hudson Yards development on the West Side of Manhattan: an eight-story structure that includes galleries; rehearsal space; a theater that can adapt to seated or standing-room events; and a shell that can enclose an adjacent plaza into a performance space. Its mandate is to commission and present world premieres of new and innovative works, and its artistic director and chief executive, Alex Poots, arrives after a decade as the artistic director of the Manchester International Festival in Britain and, in recent years, of the Park Avenue Armory in New York City. The Shed’s first full-scale offering celebrates the heritage and scope of African-American music. Over five nights from April 5-14, “Soundtrack of America” sets out to explore a “family tree” of American music, from spirituals to hip-hop, with a lineup of 25 young performers to bring out continuities and breakthroughs. “Soundtrack of America” arrives with unquestioned credentials. The series is conceived and directed by the filmmaker and video artist Steve McQueen, whose “12 Years a Slave” won the Oscar for best picture in 2014. His brain trust includes the illustrious producer Quincy Jones; the crate-digging hip-producer No I.D. (a.k.a. Dion Wilson); and the keyboardist Greg Phillinganes, who was Michael Jackson’s musical director and has worked with Stevie Wonder, Eric Clapton and Bruno Mars. The performers announced so far — five each night — include 2019 Grammy winners like Fantastic Negrito and PJ Morton; the genre-meshing New Orleans band Tank and the Bangas; Judith Hill, who sang backup for Prince and Michael Jackson, among many others; the rapper and singer Smino; the eerily idiosyncratic, falsetto-loving songwriters Moses Sumney and serpentwithfeet; and Jon Batiste, who leads the band Stay Human on “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.” The African-American musical family tree gives them a boundless source of potential material. The Shed has also announced another major musical production, May 6-June 1: a premiere from Björk, who introduced her “Biophilia” in 2011 at the Manchester International Festival. Björk describes it as “my most elaborate stage concert yet, where the acoustic and digital will shake hands”; her backup includes a seven-woman Icelandic flute ensemble. The title, promisingly, is “Cornucopia.” JON PARELES ROBYN A Robyn show is a bit different from other pop concerts. It isn’t an over-the-top spectacle of rotating set pieces and wardrobe changes, or a showcase of vocal acrobatics and choreographed backup dancers. It is sweaty and straight-up — pop church and pop group therapy, a place for fans of the Swedish singer and songwriter, who first hit the United States in the late 1990s, to experience Robyn’s transcendent, deeply addictive music beside her. From February to April, including a stop at Madison Square Garden in New York on March 8, she’s touring to support “Honey,” her first full album in eight years, which came after a half-decade of psychoanalysis and a series of personal challenges. Her loyal listeners have been anxiously waiting to share their euphoria and pain. CARYN GANZ MASSIVE ATTACK In 1998, the British trip-hop trio Massive Attack unleashed its third album, “Mezzanine,” a brooding, sensual, chilly, paranoid record of sputtering grooves and gauzy atmospherics that wound its way into popular culture everywhere, from “The Matrix” to the TV show “House.” The band has released two more albums in the 21 years since, but the gravitational pull of “Mezzanine” remains potent, and the group — now a duo consisting of Robert del Naja (known as 3D) and Grant Marshall (Daddy G) — is playing a series of shows marking its (belated) 20th anniversary. The brief tour, which hits Boston on March 14 and wraps in San Diego on April 2, promises to be an enveloping, dynamic visual extravaganza. CARYN GANZ BIG EARS FESTIVAL The Big Ears Festival in Knoxville, Tenn., has become a point of pilgrimage for all sorts of experimental listeners: Indie classical, avant-garde jazz, ambient electronic music and post-rock are all well accounted for here. The festival will celebrate its 10th anniversary, March 21-24, overtaking nearly a dozen spaces across the city’s downtown. All are within walking distance of each other, but each is comfortable and acoustically sound enough that you’ll forget what you’re missing a few doors down. This year’s acts range from the virtuoso vocalist Theo Bleckmann (paying tribute to Kate Bush) to the radical improvisers in the Art Ensemble of Chicago to the psychedelic, soulful explorations of the rock band Spiritualized. Big Ears 2019 doubles as a 50th-anniversary celebration of ECM Records; the influential label will present 20 performances throughout the festival, featuring artists from across its eclectic roster. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO MERCE CUNNINGHAM Merce Cunningham, that marvel of a choreographer, understood that dancing meant different things to different people. In the book “Merce Cunningham: Fifty Years,” he is quoted as saying: “What to some is splendid entertainment, to others is merely tedium and fidgets; what to some seems barren, to others is the very essence of the heroic.” His entire career was a heroic act of vision and persistence. One of the most revered and revolutionary choreographers of the 20th century, Cunningham was a rule breaker who collaborated deeply with many artists, including his life partner, the composer John Cage. Their experiments involved allowing music and dance to exist separately, as well as introducing the concept of chance as a creative device. In 2019, the year of his centennial, Cunningham — who died at 90 in 2009 — is being celebrated all over the world with performances, workshops, talks, screenings and more. “The ideas are still very much alive and relevant and exciting and creative,” Ken Tabachnick, the executive director of the Merce Cunningham Trust, said. “Every time I see something again, I’m just amazed at how relevant it is. It could have been made yesterday.” That is one of the important points that Mr. Tabachnick and Trevor Carlson — a trustee and the producer of the Trust’s celebration of the centennial — hope to impart with the multi-tentacled celebration. Events continue all year and are updated on the Trust’s website, but one highlight is just around the corner: “Night of 100 Solos: A Centennial Event,” on April 16, Cunningham’s birthday. Three cities — London (at the Barbican), New York (at the Brooklyn Academy of Music) and Los Angeles (at the Center for the Art of Performance at U.C.L.A.) — will stage Events, the name that Cunningham gave to performances that featured fragments of works from his repertory. (Events date to 1964.) “We’re looking to continue Merce’s tradition of doing things that hadn’t been done before,” Mr. Carlson said. “We wanted to make the largest Event ever made.” In the spirit of the new, none of the performers — including the New York City Ballet principal Sara Mearns, the Martha Graham dancer PeiJu Chien-Pott and the choreographers Kyle Abraham and Vicky Shick — are former Cunningham dancers. Those dancers are involved, however, in staging the solos. (Cunningham’s company, according to his wishes, disbanded after his death and a legacy tour.) “We wanted to signal that the Cunningham legacy has a future for people who never experienced Cunningham,” Mr. Tabachnick said. “So you’ll see ballet dancers, you’ll see dancers who are not classically or rigorously trained, you’ll see younger dancers and older dancers. And that is to show the diversity and breadth of the possibilities for the legacy.” Events are piling up, and include a Cunningham celebration at the Joyce Theater (April 17-21) featuring Compagnie CNDC-Angers/Robert Swinston, Ballet West and the Washington Ballet. Amid the excitement, Mr. Carlson has a problem. It’s a good one. “It’s wild, but I’m afraid we might have to expand the amount of time of the centennial in order to include everyone who wants to be included,” he said. “I think we’re going to see ourselves extending to what would have been Merce’s 101st birthday.” GIA KOURLAS DANCE THEATER OF HARLEM Dance Theater of Harlem has never been just another ballet troupe. It was created, in 1969, as a hopeful reaction to hope-crushing circumstances. The assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was among the spurs to action, but the principal problem in need of addressing was longstanding and continuing: the dearth of opportunities for ballet dancers who were not white. “You can’t do this,” these dancers were told by the world in many ways. Dance Theater of Harlem told them they could, and then proved it to the world. The survival of this institution for 50 years deserves a big celebration. With the death of its trailblazing founding director, Arthur Mitchell, in September, the anniversary festivities have also become memorials. In recent decades the company has valiantly struggled with diminished funds, and its New York season at City Center (April 10, 12-13) isn’t as grand as one might wish. Such signatures pieces as “Agon,” “Firebird” and “Creole Giselle” return only in excerpts. But it’s appropriate that one of Mr. Mitchell’s works (“Tones”) is being revived, and Robert Garland, the troupe’s underrecognized resident choreographer, is presenting a premiere. However these turn out, the occasion is major. BRIAN SEIBERT PAM TANOWITZ When Emma Portner, known for her video dances, withdrew from a New York City Ballet commission, the company turned to Pam Tanowitz. The circumstances are hardly ideal, but here’s a one-word reaction: Finally. Ms. Tanowitz, whose new ballet will be unveiled at the company’s spring gala on May 2, has been making dances since 1992. Celebrated for her ability to mix classical and contemporary vocabulary within a framework of formal structures, she will expand a piece set to Bartok’s String Quartet No. 5 that she created during a choreographic workshop at American Ballet Theater in 2017. It’s not the prolific Ms. Tanowitz’s only new dance this season: In April, she presents a work at the Martha Graham Dance Company; another commission, from Paul Taylor American Modern Dance, will have its premiere at the Orchestra of St. Luke’s Bach Festival in June, the same month she presents a new work for her company and the City Ballet dancers Sara Mearns and Taylor Stanley at the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council’s River to River Festival. And on March 22, she will land in Cleveland to stage a site-specific work at Pilgrim Congregational Church for her company along with local dancers. “Recital #1 (five small dances for Cleveland)” is an experiment: She’s looking at ways to reimagine her repertory. GIA KOURLAS LIGIA LEWIS Every so often, New Yorkers catch a glimpse of the choreographer Ligia Lewis, who spends much of her time in Berlin. Her brief visits, which in recent years have been high points of the American Realness festival, are not to be missed. Capping the refusal-themed “No Series” at Performance Space New York, Ms. Lewis will present “minor matter” and “Water Will (in Melody),” two parts of a triptych that began in 2014 with the spare and piercing “Sorrow Swag.” Each work in the trilogy corresponds to a color, teasing out its associations: blue, red and white. (“Sorrow Swag” featured a lone male performer enveloped in blue light.) First seen in New York at Abrons Arts Center, where three indefatigable dancers (Ms. Lewis included) seemed almost to topple the theater walls, “minor matter” (red) returns May 21-22. Exploring the space between love and rage — and the relationship between blackness and the black-box theater — it stages a kind of tangled collective struggle, in which the people onstage could be conspiring with or against one another, maybe both at once. The final part, “Water Will (in Melody),” May 28-29, flirts with melodrama and catastrophe, which sounds like a fitting end. SIOBHAN BURKE "
