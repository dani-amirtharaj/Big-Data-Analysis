For its 34th annual induction ceremony on Friday night, at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, the hall opened the pantheon to Janet Jackson, Stevie Nicks, Radiohead, Def Leppard, the Cure, Roxy Music and the Zombies — a crop of respected acts that have each had a palpable impact on pop culture, and who arrived at the institution with a notable lack of controversy or internecine squabbles. But it was the women who left the strongest impression this year, and who made the most powerful statements at the microphone. Nicks, the first woman to be inducted twice — she was already in as a member of Fleetwood Mac — kicked off the ceremony with a rundown of her solo hits like “Stand Back” and “Edge of Seventeen,” and was joined by Don Henley for “Leather and Lace” and by Harry Styles for “Stop Dragging My Heart Around,” taking on Tom Petty’s vocals while strumming a Telecaster. True to her style persona, Nicks’s black-and-gold shawl flowed behind her, as her right hand clutched a microphone with a lacy glove. “What I am doing is opening up the door for other women to go, like, ‘Hey man, I can do it,” Nicks proclaimed in her speech. Before she came to the microphone, Styles — wearing a sky-blue double-breasted velvet suit — called her “the magical Gypsy godmother who occupies the in-between.” Jackson — introduced by the singer and actress Janelle Monáe as “the legendary queen of black girl magic” — did not perform. But she drew roars from throughout the arena as she described staking her own path apart from the dynasty of her famous brothers. “As the youngest in the family, I was determined to make it on my own,” Jackson said. “I wanted to stand on my own two feet. But never in a million years did I expect to follow in their footsteps. Tonight, your baby sister has made it in.” While Jackson spoke at length about her family, she didn’t mention one of the hottest topics of the past few months — “Leaving Neverland,” an HBO documentary about two men who say Michael Jackson sexually abused them as children; she never said Michael’s name. [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] And the boys? Def Leppard thanked their parents. Robert Smith of the Cure cut short his own speech to get to its performance. Bryan Ferry was apologetic for using his time at the microphone to name so many, many names, from fellow musicians to mastering engineers. “Quite a long list of bass players, I’m afraid,” Ferry said. And Radiohead was only partly present. Its leaders, the singer Thom Yorke and the guitarist Jonny Greenwood, have barely disguised their disinterest at the institution of the Rock Hall — “I don’t care,” Greenwood once said when Rolling Stone asked him about getting in — and so the five-man group was represented only by one of its guitarists, Ed O’Brien, and its drummer, Philip Selway. “We may not be the greatest musicians around, and we’re certainly not the most media friendly of bands,” Selway said. “But we have become very adept at being Radiohead, and when that connects with people it feels amazing.” In performance, Def Leppard played bad-boy pop-metal anthems like “Hysteria” and “Pour Some Sugar on Me” like a well-oiled machine, matching the musical strength of the band’s 1980s heyday, but without the strutting and stage leaps of its old videos. (But Phil Collen, the guitarist, looked like a toned street fighter as he played shirtless and with thick chains around his neck.) The Cure, representing the post-punk and 1980s indie-rock era, kept the crowd in rapt attention with a playlist that spanned hits like “Lovesong” and “Boys Don’t Cry,” as well as oddities like the song “A Forest” that are just as important to the group’s identity. In his speech introducing the band, Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails called the Cure his gateway to alternative and underground music in the ’80s, and marveled that Smith had used his “singular vision to create the rarest of things: a completely self-contained world with its own rules.” The night ended with a jam session featuring members of Def Leppard, the Zombies, Brian May of Queen (who inducted Def Leppard), Susanna Hoffs of the Bangles (who inducted the Zombies) and Ian Hunter of Mott the Hoople (who appeared to just be in the arena) singing along to that band’s 1972 hit “All the Young Dudes,” written by David Bowie. Highlights from the ceremony will be broadcast by HBO on April 27. In past years, the Rock Hall induction ceremony has often been marked by complaints and rants from artists; three years ago, Steve Miller called the induction process “unpleasant” and said he felt disrespected. This year the artists maintained a polite decorum, even when explaining their ambivalence about the institution. Speaking to reporters backstage, Smith said he was “not quite sure about the whole thing” and that his band had, in a way, “been subsumed into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.” But at the same time, Smith said, “there are so many people who have done this that I admire so hugely, who have inspired me so much, that it would be really, really wrong of me to be anything other than delighted.” The sharpest criticism was also the most encouraging, addressing the Rock Hall’s poor record of including women. According to one count, of the 888 people who have been inducted over the hall’s history, just 69 of them, or less than 8 percent, have been women. Wrapping up her speech, Jackson gave the hall a nudge. “Rock & Roll Hall of Fame,” she said, “2020 — please induct more women.” "
5cafa87649f0eacbf1f83123,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/arts/music/music-exhibitions-leonard-cohen-instruments-punk.html,"A man’s voice recites lines from a poem as fantastical low-resolution images of cityscapes are projected on a screen in a darkened room. “When I couldn’t sleep/I learned to write,” we hear him say. “I learned to write/what might be read/on nights like this/by one like me.” The lines come from Leonard Cohen’s “The Only Poem,” and the visuals, by Jon Rafman, are a collection of processed found photos and landscapes from video games that take the words somewhere far away and transform Cohen’s crisp verse into the narration of a dream. This piece can be found in “Leonard Cohen: A Crack in Everything,” an exhibition celebrating the life and work of the singer-songwriter, who died in 2016. It comes to the Jewish Museum on Friday after a run in Montreal.  The lines from “The Only Poem” speak to the almost mystical bond between those who create art and those who consume it. When a transmission like the one described in the poem happens in pop music, particularly fertile ground for intense longing of all kinds, we might hear a fan say, “That song saved my life.” This emotional identification is, to varying degrees, the animating force behind four current museum shows that center on music, including “A Crack in Everything” and exhibitions at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Arts and Design and the Museum of Sex. Each has something to say about how pop music fits into our lives, how we absorb its history, what it means to present the pop experience in an institutional setting, and how people use music to find themselves. At the Met, “Play It Loud: Instruments of Rock & Roll,” which opened Monday, seeks to enrich what you already know, telling a familiar narrative through objects that seem like stars in their own right. Presented in collaboration with the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, “Play It Loud” offers a vision of history in which the rock music that flowered in the 1960s and ’70s sits firmly at the center. The format of the rock band provides the structure of the show, with one room given over to the rhythm section (here we see a double bass from the low-end legend James Jamerson, whose playing provides the rhythmic drive for dozens of Motown hits, as well as drum kits from the Beatles and Metallica) and another showcasing “Guitar Gods,” featuring instruments from Eric Clapton, Jerry Garcia and many more. Another room has a display highlighting the guitar’s destruction, with pieces of instruments trashed by Kurt Cobain and Pete Townshend. To the extent that it shifts focus toward the tools of the rock trade, the show is illuminating. Of particular interest is the room set aside for “Creating a Sound,” which focuses on the sonic possibility of electronics and includes beautiful objects like the first Moog modular synthesizer owned by Keith Emerson of the progressive rock band Emerson, Lake & Palmer. Emerson’s instrument is a towering monolith with patch cords hanging off it like an automaton’s viscera, and it highlights how the story of popular music is bound to technology. The Moog presents itself as a roadie’s worst nightmare — it’s almost impossible to imagine a crew packing up a machine of such complexity and loading it onto a truck for the next show. The lighting in “Play It Loud” is dim, perhaps reflecting rock music as the sound of the night. Each individual instrument shines like a beacon, as if it’s catching the glint of an onstage spotlight. It makes the space between audience member and musician seem vast, but that doesn’t diminish the wonder of browsing the tools once used by pop royalty. One of the defining principles of punk, in contrast, is that this gap should be much narrower. “Too Fast to Live, Too Young to Die: Punk Graphics, 1976-1986,” which opened Tuesday at the Museum of Arts and Design, adheres to this stricture. The presentation, curated by Andrew Blauvelt, director of the Cranbrook Art Museum in Michigan, is modest, befitting the humble beginnings of the images on display, and the show offers a fascinating look at how punk and new wave music met the eye. Many of the objects on display in “Too Fast to Live” were first hung in record stores or in the bedrooms of teenagers. Posters promoting new albums, tours and shows are mixed in with album art, zines, buttons and other miscellany. Most of the pieces are affixed to the walls with magnets and are not framed, and almost all show signs of wear. The presentation reinforces that this was commercial art meant for wide consumption, and the ragged edges and prominent creases in the works make the history feel alive. That enduringly ragged aesthetic extends to the design itself. Punk as an idea has never left the conversation and retains its aura of cool. Peter Saville’s iconic image for Joy Division’s “Unknown Pleasures” album, for example, seen here in a promotional poster, could just as easily be found on the T-shirt of a current high school student. Early on, punk’s cheap, trash-culture aesthetic bumped up against the art world, and the mix of high and low makes “Too Fast to Live” a rich show. One room focuses on the influence of comics, as seen in posters for the Angry Samoans and the Damned, while large and beautiful Stiff Records tour posters, designed by Barney Bubbles, bring to mind Warhol’s screen prints. But while the range of style and aesthetics on display is striking, almost everything here was created for a specific commercial purpose, and directed squarely at those who loved (and might one day love) these bands. The display of buttons that once decorated book bags and jean jackets drives this home. “Too Fast to Live” ultimately feels like a celebration of record culture and fandom. Through these objects, most of which were very inexpensive, a subset of music fans defined themselves as part of a tribe. The Museum of Sex has a show that comes at punk from another angle, illustrating the visceral core lurking beneath these iconic images. “Punk Lust: Raw Provocation 1971-1985” essays a secret history of this music, one based on the presentation of desire. In the exhibition, which opened in the fall, chain-link fencing surrounds mannequins adorned with fetish gear, and between that and the rivet-studded steel floors, you feel like you’re inside one of the trash-strewn early 1980s downtown New York clubs on display in films like Slava Tsukerman’s “Liquid Sky” or Martin Scorsese’s “After Hours.” As music movements go, punk rock, which, at its extremes, can be nihilistic or politically didactic, isn’t necessarily associated with sex. But “Punk Lust” suggests that carnal energy throbs at the music’s core. The show begins with imagery from the Velvet Underground: the 1963 paperback of that title, an exploration of what was then called deviant sexual behavior and gave the band its name, is one of the first objects on display. Working through photos, album art and fliers by artists like Iggy Pop, the New York Dolls, Patti Smith, and, yes, the Sex Pistols, the exhibition demonstrates how punk offered a space for sexual expression outside the mainstream. In the story told by “Punk Lust,” much of it laid out in placards by the writer and musician Vivien Goldman, one of the show’s curators, graphic sexual imagery is a tool for shock that frightens away the straight world and offers comfort to those who remain inside. While some of the power dynamic is typical — underage groupies cavorting with rock stars — images from female, queer and nonbinary artists like Jayne County and the Slits make a strong case for sex as an essential source of punk liberation. That sexual expression in music can encompass both crude pornographic fliers created by Adam Ant, which are on display in “Punk Lust,” and also the cool and elegant sensuality coursing through the work of Cohen, says something about how vast the subject is. The erotic side of Cohen’s catalog is one focus among many in “A Crack in Everything,” an exhibition that shows rather than tells. The curators of the show, John Zeppetelli of the Musée d’Art Contemporain de Montréal, and Victor Shiffman, commissioned artists of various disciplines to develop pieces inspired by Cohen. Some are simple and quiet, like “Ear on a Worm” from the film artist Tacita Dean, a small image playing on a loop high in the space that shows a perched bird, a reference to “Bird on the Wire” from Cohen’s 1969 album “Songs From a Room.” Some are closer to traditional documentary, like George Fok’s “Passing Through,” which intercuts performances by Cohen throughout his career with video that surrounds the viewer, suggesting the songs are constant and eternal while the performer’s body changes with time. Candice Breitz’s installation “I’m Your Man (A Portrait of Leonard Cohen)” gathers video portraits of 19 men over the age of 65 singing and humming Cohen’s songs. Each is life-size and high resolution, and the effect of walking through the room is as if the men were present. It’s a breathtaking meditation on fandom, aging and impermanence. (Cohen remained fully immersed in the last two subjects. His final album, “You Want It Darker,” a meditation on his own mortality, was released a month before his death at 82, after a fall in the night.) Taken together, the layered work on display in “A Crack in Everything” has a lot to offer on Cohen, but even more to say about how we respond to music, bring it into our lives, and use it as both a balm and an agent for transformation.

5ca4c90a49f0eacbf1f80947,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/03/obituaries/gerry-stickells-dead.html,"Gerry Stickells was a car mechanic in southeast England who drove local rock groups to their engagements in his van when, in 1966, he met Chas Chandler, Jimi Hendrix’s manager. Mr. Chandler made him an offer: If he could get Hendrix’s gear out of customs at Heathrow Airport, he could join him on the road in Europe. The errand completed, Mr. Stickells soon became part of rock ’n’ roll history as the roadie, and then tour manager, for Hendrix, the transcendent electric guitarist who was about to release his first single, “Hey Joe,” in Britain. It became a four-year assignment: Mr. Stickells handled the Jimi Hendrix Experience’s gear, drove the band to gigs, fixed the van when it broke down and organized its tours. Some shows were more memorable than others: At the Denver Pop Festival in 1969, he brought Hendrix and his bandmates, the bassist Noel Redding and the drummer Mitch Mitchell, to safety in a U-Haul truck at Mile High Stadium after tear gas had enveloped them onstage during a riot. After the Experience dissolved in 1969, Mr. Stickells stayed with Hendrix, accompanying him most notably to Woodstock, where Hendrix played a jarring, feedback-heavy version of  “The Star Spangled Banner.” When Hendrix died the next year in London, Mr. Stickells identified his body at a hospital and accompanied it to Seattle for burial. What Mr. Stickells learned on the road with Hendrix laid the foundation for the business that he developed over more than 30 years: He became a top road and production manager for musicians at a time when the logistics of touring and performing were growing increasingly elaborate and concerts were turning into ever more lavish extravaganzas. He was best known for his years on the road with Queen, but he also worked with a star-studded cadre of other artists, including Paul McCartney, Elton John, Abba, Fleetwood Mac, Bette Midler and Madonna. Mr. Stickells died on March 6 at his home in Los Angeles. He was 76. His wife, Sylvia (Reed) Stickells, said the cause was complications of a skull base meningioma, a brain tumor that grows in the bones that form the bottom of the skull. It was discovered in 2003 and could not be fully removed, she said. Gerald Richard Stickells was born on July 22, 1942, in Lydd, a town in Kent, England. He was one of 10 children of Thomas and Doris (Coleman) Stickells, farm laborers in a wetland area called the Romney Marsh. At 15, Gerry quit school to become an apprentice mechanic in a garage in nearby New Romney, riding eight miles each way on his bicycle. It would be nearly a decade before he left to join Hendrix. “His parents couldn’t understand why he’d leave this good job, with jobs hard to come by down on the marsh,” Sylvia Stickles said in an email. “They never really got the music thing.” Mr. Stickells had no musical background, but he appreciated Hendrix’s musicianship and his skill as a performer. “When you’re close to the audience, they become more involved in some way; it all feels more alive,” he said in an interview in the 1990s that is posted on Crosstown Torrents, a website devoted to Hendrix. He recalled the “voltage” of a Hendrix show at a “sweaty pub gig.” After Hendrix died, Mr. Stickells managed his Manhattan recording studio, Electric Lady, and then moved to Los Angeles, where he turned the roles of tour and production manager into a global business. He teamed with Chris Lamb to form G.L.S. Productions, which handled every aspect of live music touring and production, including staffing, travel, trucking, ticketing, lighting and stage rigging. “We met on an Elton John tour, and he was the most experienced guy I had ever encountered,” Mr. Lamb said in an interview with Projection Lights and Staging News, an industry publication, in 2015, when it gave him its life achievement award. (Mr. Stickells had received the same honor eight years earlier.) “He knew how to handle every situation.” Through Elton John’s manager, John Reid, Mr. Stickells and Mr. Lamb found another client in Queen, in the 1970s. They helped fulfill the group’s ambitions for the lavish stage spectacles it became known for. “The hardest thing is dealing with the personalities involved, but once you become used to artists’ moods, you can usually stay a step ahead,” Mr. Stickells said in 1980 in an interview with the Philadelphia newspaper The Bulletin. “And I don’t spend too much time listening to the music. I’m too wrapped up in the practical matters.” In a statement posted on Queen’s website after Mr. Stickells’s death, Roger Taylor, the band’s drummer, called him “father figure, great friend and teacher, and an island of calm in the midst of chaos.” Peter Hince, who worked on Queen’s road crew from 1975 to 1986 and wrote the book “Queen Unseen” (2011), said Mr. Stickells had a productive relationship with the band’s lead singer, Freddie Mercury. “He was probably the only person able to get Freddie to change his mind, or convince him otherwise, when Fred chose to be difficult and play the diva,” Mr. Hince said in an email. Mr. Stickells was also credited with helping to crack the market for rock concerts in South America in the early 1980s; Queen proved to be an early success in Argentina and Brazil in 1981. His organizational and diplomatic skills were particularly helpful in dealing with military regimes. In 1985, he and Mr. Lamb built the infrastructure for the first Rock in Rio festival in Rio de Janeiro, where the lineup included Queen, James Taylor, AC/DC, George Benson, Yes, Ozzy Osbourne and Iron Maiden. “Rod Stewart showed up with his personal armed mini-military,” Mr. Stickells told Projection Lights and Staging News in 2007. “Death squads were the norm, and it was pretty intense, but Queen got along O.K. down there because they were able to just get with the local flavor.” Just before the Rio festival, Mr. Stickells reflected on how much the concert business had changed since the 1960s. Recalling the Monterey International Pop Festival in 1967, he told United Press International: “I was traveling with Hendrix, and we got all our sound equipment and the drum kit into one station wagon. Now I’m dealing with millions and tractor-trailer rigs and helicopters.” Mr. Stickells continued to work until 2003, when he had a seizure while on tour with Paul McCartney in Moscow. He learned he had a brain tumor when he returned to Los Angeles. He last worked in 2006, as a production consultant for a Rolling Stones concert in Rio. In addition to his wife, Mr. Stickells is survived by his sisters, Kathleen Evenden, Lilian Else and Muriel Green. Mr. Stickells recently watched “Bohemian Rhapsody” (2018), the film about Queen that won four Oscars, including one for Rami Malek for his portrayal of Mr. Mercury. Mr. Stickells was fragile and could barely speak. “The part that really caught his attention was the Live Aid performance,” Ms. Stickells said, referring to the re-enactment of the 1985 benefit concert that featured a memorable performance by Queen. “That was a huge highlight of his career, and he definitely recognized it, suddenly pointing and smiling, ‘It’s Fred.’ ” "
5c4608ec3a125f5075c0589d,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/21/theater/school-of-rock-jill-valentine.html,"Jill Valentine is pretty sure the kids have a nickname for her: Fun Killer. For nearly four years, Ms. Valentine has been the head guardian of “School of Rock,” which played its last performance on Sunday at the Winter Garden Theater. Guardians care for child actors during rehearsals and before and after performances, making sure they’re fed, watered and rested. Ms. Valentine distributes children’s pain relievers, she runs science flashcards, she confiscates contraband. She doesn’t have children of her own — “I have two cats and a boyfriend, that’s enough!” she said — but 63 have come into and out of her care since she joined “School of Rock” for pre-Broadway rehearsals in 2015. Thirteen children, age about 8 to 13, star in every performance, with four more waiting backstage. Thirty-six alumni joined them for Sunday’s show-closing jam session. Before the Saturday evening performance, Ms. Valentine met me at the show’s rehearsal space, now mostly denuded and bubble wrapped. She talked about the responsibilities of the job, the hectic schedule and why there are no children showmances. Her feelings about the show’s ending were bittersweet, but not so bittersweet that she hadn’t booked a 5 a.m. Miami-bound flight for Monday. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation. What exactly is a guardian? It’s the responsible person for the child actor. We are responsible for their safety, health, well-being from the time that they walk into the stage door until the time they walk out. I will be in two hours before the curtain goes up. Then we pick up the kids about an hour and 15 minutes before curtain. There are 17 of them. It’s a lot. They’ll go upstairs, drop their stuff, do a physical and vocal warm-up in our green room and then we are off to the races — hair calls, costumes, mic check, all that stuff. Once the kids go downstairs for the show, we don’t have any breaks. They’re onstage all the time and we’re backstage. They go upstairs for intermission — quick snack, water break, bathroom break, game of cards. And then right back downstairs again until the end of the show. What’s the popular snack these days? Their tastes are not what you would think of as kid tastes. They like poke bowls. They’re into Maison Kayser. They don’t eat kid food. They’re like very short adults. But if there’s a birthday and we have birthday cake, everyone is in. What do you do to bond with them?  If you ask them real questions about what their life is like and then follow up, they know that you care. We spend 40 hours a week together; that’s an incredible amount of time. They really do become like family. How do you reassure the parents? When we start rehearsal, I do a parent orientation. I have an eight-page packet that I send out. Like, so your child’s in a Broadway show, here’s what you need to know, a step-by-step guide. They have my cellphone number. I get texts, I get phone calls, I get emails. What emergencies have you handled? We’ve certainly had bloody noses, we’ve stood offstage with trash cans. We say, if you think you’re going to be sick, please walk off the stage, we will be there with a trash can for you. I have to ask the kids, do you need to stop? Can you finish the show? It has to be the actors’ choice. Do you handle a lot of stage fright? There’s usually a little bit of nervousness for the first or even the second show. We try really hard to encourage parents to maybe hold off on inviting everyone you’ve ever met to see your child perform for like a week. Do you have ways of celebrating when someone leaves the show? We do. We call it graduation. The audience gets to cheer and afterward we do a graduation ceremony, everybody sings “Pomp and Circumstance.” They get a little mortar board, they sign the back of the set, they get a little diploma. Are they sad to leave? Yeah, they are. And sometimes it’s really hard to watch them go. It’s also pretty great. We have a lot of alumni come back. They can come in and go to warm up and sit with the other kids. They’re all coming back tomorrow! So many of them! It’s going to be nuts. [Check out our Culture Calendar here.] So Fun Killer, how do you kill the fun? If we’re having a tough day I’m one who comes in and is like: “What are you, crazy? We’re doing a show. You cannot throw a football backstage. You just can’t.” I’ve definitely taken away a basketball, a skateboard. Do you have a favorite group of kids? I try very hard not to have favorites. Kids know and it doesn’t really suit what we’re trying to teach them, which is professionalism. Have there been any kid showmances? Not really. Our age group tends to be before that kicks in. Mostly boys and girls have cooties. Plus we have no time! What’s the hardest part of the job? I think the hardest thing is to be consistent. It doesn’t matter how tired I am. Or if it’s Sunday night of a five-show weekend and all I want to do is go home. Because when the stuff hits the fan [Ms. Valentine used a more colorful term], I need those kids to turn to me and to trust me. Is it sad to leave the show? A little. It’s my sixth Broadway show. I know what this is. I’m O.K. But in packing up the office, I’m going through paperwork and old schedules, drawings the kids have made. Which is like, Oh, right. Remember that? We’ve done so much! If anything, my overwhelming feeling is not sorrow, but pride. "
5cafab3249f0eacbf1f8314c,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/arts/music/nyc-this-weekend-pop-rock-jazz.html,"Our guide to pop and rock shows and the best of live jazz happening this weekend and in the week ahead. TONY BENNETT at Radio City Music Hall (April 13, 8 p.m.). For the better part of a century, this decorated singer from Astoria, Queens, has championed the great American songbook, bewitching audiences with renditions of pop and jazz standards by Cole Porter, Irving Berlin and others. More recently, the 20-time Grammy Award winner introduced himself to younger generations with a series of “Duets” albums, on which he sang alongside contemporary artists like Lady Gaga, John Legend and Amy Winehouse. Bennett still actively tours at the age of 92 and, per the title of his most recent book, is “just getting started.”212-465-6000, radiocity.com LAURA JANE GRACE & THE DEVOURING MOTHERS at Bowery Ballroom (April 18, 7 p.m.). This trio is a side project of Grace’s, whose work as the frontwoman of the Florida punk band Against Me! has highlighted her experiences as a transgender woman, particularly on albums like “Transgender Dysphoria Blues” and “Shape Shift With Me.” Alongside her Devouring Mothers — the drummer Atom Willard (also in Against Me!) and the bassist Marc Jacob Hudson — Grace writes more restrained songs that retain hints of her punkish invective. At this Lower East Side club, the trio will receive support from the New Jersey-based rock group Mercy Union and the Philadelphia-based noise-punk band Control Top. 212-260-4700, mercuryeastpresents.com ‘LIVE FROM HERE’ at the Town Hall (April 13, 5:45 p.m.). The mandolinist Chris Thile had already taken over hosting duties on the weekly radio variety show “A Prairie Home Companion” before its original host, Garrison Keillor, fell from grace. This rebranded program, like its predecessor, is recorded before a live audience, often traveling from its home base in St. Paul to theaters around the country. Among the guests at this week’s taping in Midtown is Sara Bareilles, the pop singer behind radio hits like “Love Song” and  “King of Anything.” She shares the bill with the folk duo Milk Carton Kids and the comedian Aparna Nancherla. 212-997-6661, thetownhall.org NATALIE PRASS at Bowery Ballroom (April 17, 8 p.m.). As this singer-songwriter from Richmond, Va., knows, creating art with a political point of view can be risky. Her second album, last year’s “The Future and the Past,” was written largely in response to the 2016 presidential election; finding a label willing to release it took her longer than she had hoped. In the past year, Prass has toured the album tirelessly, as both a headliner and a supporting artist on Kacey Musgraves’s “Oh, What a World” Tour. On this stop, she’ll perform funk-flavored pop songs like “Oh My” and “Short Court Style,” as well as more orchestral holdovers from her 2015 debut. 212-260-4700, mercuryeastpresents.com [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] PRETTY LOU’S THIRD ANNUAL CHARITY CONCERT at Irving Plaza (April 16, 6 p.m.). The New York hip-hop community rallied around the Brooklyn-based D.J., nightlife personality and Fat Joe affiliate Pretty Lou Ortega (not to be confused with the member of the 1990s rap group Lost Boyz, whose moniker he shares) after he learned he had the rare blood condition aplastic anemia, which has since developed into leukemia. In its third year, this annual showcase benefiting leukemia and A.L.S. research will feature Fat Joe and his fellow Terror Squad member Remy Ma, as well as Raekwon and Ghostface Killah of the Wu-Tang Clan, the Diplomats and others. 212-777-6800, mercuryeastpresents.com PRIESTS at Elsewhere (April 16, 8 p.m.). The members of this trio from Washington have long pushed back on the “political punk” label that critics often affix to their work; still, how they earned it is clear. The debut record from these firebrands is colored by brash guitars and the muscular vocals of their frontwoman, Katie Alice Greer, whose lyrics broach subjects like consumerism and free will. Riffing on the name of Thomas Frank’s 2004 book on the rise of populist conservatism, Priests titled their just-released follow-up “The Seduction of Kansas.” This album is similarly concerned with American politics and identity; this time, though, their sound is more polished. elsewherebrooklyn.comOLIVIA HORN EMMET COHEN TRIO at Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola (April 16, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). Cohen, 28, has a breezy, phlegmatic command at the keyboard, and a deep well of historical jazz references at his fingertips. He has worked as a side musician for such luminaries as Christian McBride and Herlin Riley, and has recorded with the elder statesmen Ron Carter and Jimmy Cobb. If he wasn’t already an obvious heir apparent to the neo-traditional jazz mantle, his win at last weekend’s 2019 American Pianists Awards ought to make it official. At Dizzy’s, he will be joined by the bassist Philip Norris and the drummer Kyle Poole. They will draw some of the night’s material from Cohen’s recent trio album, “Dirty in Detroit.”212-258-9595, jazz.org/dizzys MIHO HAZAMA AND M_UNIT at Jazz Standard (April 17, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). The crossbreeding of classical and jazz has a long history, stretching back to the Third Stream movement of the 1960s. And new approaches to this amalgam have been thick on the ground of late: Just try to count how many young jazz musicians are writing for string quartet these days. One of the boldest thinkers and most delightful composers in this vein is Hazama, who studied Western classical music in Japan before making the jump to jazz. Her chamber orchestra, m_unit, blends strings and horns and mallet percussion in service of her resplendent, highly singable compositions. At the Standard, the group will be playing selections from the recently released “Dancer in Nowhere.”212-576-2232, jazzstandard.com BEN MONDER, TONY MALABY AND TOM RAINEY at Public Records (April 17, 8 p.m.). This newly opened music club, cafe and bar in Gowanus, Brooklyn, has a high-fidelity sound setup in two different rooms. In the back, which is laid out like a typical nightclub, electronic and experimental shows run throughout the week. Every Wednesday going forward, the barroom hosts a weekly jazz series. The group playing this Wednesday is a trio featuring three esteemed, New York-based improvisers with a long history of collaboration: the dark-toned, harmonically sophisticated guitarist Ben Monder, the undersung saxophone titan Tony Malaby and the roving, idiosyncratic drummer Tom Rainey.publicrecords.nyc BRANDON ROSS’S PHANTOM STATION at the Jazz Gallery (April 12, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). Ross, a guitarist best known for his work in the jazz-rock power trio Harriet Tubman, doesn’t just play a slew of different instruments (banjo, soprano guitar, regular old electric guitar, etc.), he also ranges freely from sweet and lyrical playing to wavy, confrontational distortion. Phantom Station is not a band; it’s an opportunity for him to embrace his proclivity for newness and change. He performs under this name with a wide variety of collaborators and formations. On Friday, the ensemble will include Graham Haynes on cornet and electronics, J. T. Lewis (also a member of Harriet Tubman) on drums and Hardedge on sound design. 646-494-3625, jazzgallery.nyc STRETCH MUSIC FESTIVAL at Harlem Stage Gatehouse (April 12, 7:30 p.m.). The trumpeter Christian Scott aTunde Adjuah is about to close the book on a three-year residency at Harlem Stage. As part of that, since 2017 he has convened an annual Stretch Music Festival, comprising educational events, discussions of art and activism, and performances. (The event’s title is a reference to the way Scott refers to his own music; it’s an effort to wriggle free from the limitations of genre.) He is coming off the release last month of “Ancestral Recall,” an impressive album on which West African-derived rhythms and whispery synthesizers fortify his bristling trumpet playing and the strident, subversive poetry of Saul Williams. Friday’s festival will include performances by Scott, the saxophonist Logan Richardson and Freelance, a band that fuses contemporary R&B with backpacker hip-hop and jazz.212-281-9240, harlemstage.org JOHN ZORN’S NEW MASADA QUARTET at the Village Vanguard (April 14, 3 p.m.). Last year, Zorn, the eminent alto saxophonist and downtown arts organizer, released “The Book Beriah,” the final portion of his 613-song epic, “Masada,” a collection of experimental, often lovely compositions based in Jewish folk song, klezmer and free jazz (613 is the number of commandments, or mitzvot, in the Torah). As is the wont of this serial collaborator, Zorn featured a different ensemble on each of “Beriah’s” 10 CDs (11, including the bonus disc). Here he plays material from “Masada” in a new quartet featuring three talented improvisers: Julian Lage on guitar, Jorge Roeder on bass and Kenny Wollesen on drums. 212-255-4037, villagevanguard.comGIOVANNI RUSSONELLO "

THE CACTUS BLOSSOMS at Bowery Ballroom (April 11, 8 p.m.). Because of their tightly woven harmonies and rockabilly influences, this band of brothers from Minneapolis has racked up comparisons to two of music’s most celebrated siblings: the Everlys. This year, the group, comprising Page Burkum and Jack Torrey, released “Easy Way,” a record that ever-so-slightly mussed up the clean-cut sound of their 2016 label debut, but maintained a sunny outlook and retro coziness. One highlight, “Got a Lotta Love,” was written with Dan Auerbach from the Black Keys. With its heart-on-its-sleeve lyrics, it illustrates their songwriting strategy. As Torrey told Rolling Stone, singing about love is “more attractive than singing about divisive subjects.”212-260-4700, mercuryeastpresents.com ELLA VOS at Brooklyn Steel (April 10, 8 p.m.). Many women’s careers are hindered by pregnancy; this pop singer’s was propelled by it. Her best-known song, the moody, R&B-tinged track “White Noise,” centers on her experience with postpartum depression, and she has said that becoming pregnant is what gave her the courage to pursue music in the first place. The anonymity granted by Vos’s stage name (her chosen moniker roughly translates from Spanish to “she you”) further boosts her confidence, empowering her to tackle difficult material in her songs. “You Don’t Know About Me,” from her debut album, addresses women’s lack of bodily agency, and “Empty Hands,” from an EP released in January, documents the cancer treatment she recently underwent.888-929-7849, bowerypresents.com HAND HABITS at Bowery Ballroom (April 10, 8 p.m.). Meg Duffy, the songwriter behind this indie-rock project, is a musician’s musician. A product of New York’s Hudson Valley D.I.Y. community, Duffy gained a reputation in Los Angeles for shredding on demand as a go-to session guitarist and a member of Kevin Morby’s touring band. Duffy’s solo work is more restrained and reflective, as evinced on Hand Habits’ recent sophomore album, “Placeholder,” which features a softened guitar tone and raw lyrics about anxiety. After supporting Japanese Breakfast at two New York shows in January, Hand Habits return as a headliner.212-260-4700, mercuryeastpresents.com [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] HONEY DIJON at 99 Scott (April 5, 11 p.m.). “House music for me was never just about tracks,” this D.J., transgender activist and fashion darling told Vice. “It was really about creating something that was too black, too queer and too gay.” Coming of age in Chicago during the heyday of house, Honey Dijon was mentored by Derrick Carter, a pioneer of the genre. Her own style grew to be more eclectic, drawing on techno and sampling soul and pop hits, but it honors her house roots. As a performer, she strives to foster human connection through sound, channeling the sense of liberation she found in her own formative musical experiences, like sneaking into Chicago nightclubs as a teenager. tixr.com SOUNDTRACK OF AMERICA at the Shed (April 5 and 7, 8 p.m.; April 9, 8:30 p.m.; through April 14). For its opening, this flashy new interdisciplinary arts space — a cultural counterweight to the surrounding commercial development in Hudson Yards — will host five nights of concerts honoring the influence of African-American musicians. Developed by the filmmaker Steve McQueen, the series aims to explore the story of black music in America from early spirituals to today’s diverse forms. To that end, the performances in the coming week feature artists such as the jazz pianist and bandleader Jon Batiste, the rappers Smino and Rapsody, the avant-pop cellist Kelsey Lu and the R&B singer Emily King.646-455-3494, theshed.org Y LA BAMBA AND HABIBI at BRIC House Ballroom (April 11, 8 p.m.). Luz Elena Mendoza’s Mexican heritage has long informed her songwriting: As the frontwoman of Y La Bamba, she sings in both Spanish and English, taking cues from traditional musica mexicana as well as American folk songs and dream pop. Her band’s most recent album, “Mujeres,” grapples with what it means to be Mexican in the current political climate, and with the machismo entrenched in Mexican society. At this Brooklyn arts center, Y La Bamba share a bill with Habibi, another group for whom multicultural identity is a central concern. Their “Cardamom Garden” EP from last year was recorded partly in Farsi, celebrating their lead singer’s Iranian roots, and cultivated a distinctly American surf-rock vibe.718-683-5600, bricartsmedia.orgOLIVIA HORN MICHAËL ATTIAS at Greenwich House Music School (April 6, 7:30 p.m.). On Friday, Attias will release “Échos la Nuit,” an album of slow, ruminative solo recordings on which he plays both the alto saxophone (his primary instrument) and the piano. Hearing these 12 tracks is like inspecting the mysterious line drawings of a beloved artist. Sometimes you’ll almost discern the contour of a landscape or the dark shading of a limb, but ultimately the shapes all drift back into a desolate, spacious abstraction. At Greenwich House, Attias will perform solo and in a quartet.212-242-4770, greenwichhouse.org AMIR ELSAFFAR AND TWO RIVERS WITH HAMID AL-SAADI at Pioneer Works (April 8, 7 p.m.). ElSaffar, a lauded Iraqi-American trumpeter, leads bands mostly comprising jazz musicians, but he gets them to use the trundling rhythms and maqam-based melodies of Middle Eastern music, rather than the typical tools of contemporary jazz. Recently he has been performing with Al-Saadi, a singer and scholar of traditional maqam. Here Al-Saadi will join ElSaffar’s sextet, Two Rivers.pioneerworks.org JONATHAN FINLAYSON at the Stone (April 10-13, 8:30 p.m.). Last year, Finlayson, a young trumpeter with an appetite for tangled rhythm and lithe, fugacious melody, released a compelling album, “3 Times Round,” with his sextet. In the coming week at the Stone, across four evenings, he gathers a different band each night: On Wednesday and Thursday, there are trios (featuring the bassist Mark Helias and the drummer Tom Rainey on the first night, then the saxophonist Brian Settles and the drummer Chad Taylor on the second). On April 12, he presents a quintet that includes the alto saxophone phenom Immanuel Wilkins, and on April 13, he closes the run with a septet, playing a new suite of music called “The Odyssey of Big Boy.”thestonenyc.com SULLIVAN FORTNER TRIO at the Village Vanguard (through April 7, 8:30 and 10:30 p.m.). Fortner is just 32, but the New Orleans-born pianist — who’s often clad in a loose smoking jacket and fedora — carries himself with the wizened, avuncular comportment of a jazz elder. When he sits down at the piano, though, youthful energy comes spilling off him like sweat from an athlete’s back. He plays bracing, mile-a-minute postbop, often tangling up his arpeggios and using both hands to create layers of rhythm. At the Vanguard he is joined by Ameen Saleem on bass and Jeremy Clemons on drums; the group will likely draw some repertoire from Fortner’s most recent release, “Moments Preserved.”212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com OLIVER LAKE at Roulette (April 5, 8 p.m.). An avant-garde alto saxophonist and multimedia artist, Lake has been at the top of his class since the early 1970s, when he arrived in New York from St. Louis, where he had helped establish the influential Black Artists Group. In 1976 he and three other saxophonists formed the World Saxophone Quartet, an all-sax combo that became one of the most successful, if unorthodox, jazz groups of the following decade. At Roulette, he presents Alto Madness, a similar ensemble featuring three fellow alto saxophonists — Bruce Williams, Darius Jones and Michaël Attias — as well as the drummer Pheeroan AkLaff. The band will play “Tone Poem for J. A. H.,” a piece Lake originally wrote 12 years ago for the World Saxophone Quartet.917-267-0368, roulette.org ‘A TRIBUTE TO DAVE VALENTIN’ at the Hostos Center for the Arts and Culture (April 6, 7:30 p.m.). Valentin, a Grammy-winning flutist and a fixture of New York’s salsa and Latin jazz scenes, died in 2017 at 64, cutting short a career that encompassed the release of almost two dozen of his own albums, as well as stints with McCoy Tyner’s Latin All-Stars and Tito Puente’s Golden Latin Jazz All-Stars. The pianist Bill O’Connell was the musical director of Valentin’s final band, and here he presents an hommage to his former boss, playing songs from Valentin’s repertoire with a quintet that includes the flutist Andrea Brachfeld. After an intermission, O’Connell will retake the stage with a new 10-piece group, Bill O’Connell’s Afro-Caribbean Ensemble, featuring the master percussionist Roman Díaz. 718-518-4455, hostos.cuny.edu/culturearts MCCOY TYNER AND CHARLES MCPHERSON WITH THE JAZZ AT LINCOLN CENTER ORCHESTRA at the Rose Theater (April 5-6, 8 p.m.). Two jazz giants, Tyner and McPherson will celebrate their 80th birthdays together in a performance with Wynton Marsalis’s Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra. (Tyner reached the milestone late last year; McPherson will turn 80 in July.) The large ensemble will play Tyner’s and McPherson’s compositions, which have been newly arranged for orchestra by members of the group.212-721-6500, jazz.orgGIOVANNI RUSSONELLO "

BILAL at National Sawdust (March 29, 8 p.m.). A onetime member of the Soulquarians, this Philadelphia-born singer, songwriter and producer is well known as a collaborator: He has won a Grammy for his work with Kendrick Lamar and lent his vocals to the likes of Jay-Z and Mac Miller. Bilal himself took a circuitous path as a solo artist after his sophomore album was shelved in 2006. Disenchanted with the industry, he parted ways with his label and began experimenting with jazz and electronic sounds, rejecting the “neo-soul” billing that has followed him for much of his career. The result, heard on recent albums “A Love Surreal” and “In Another Life,” is fluid and inviting. 646-779-8455, nationalsawdust.org BROADLY PRESENTS EUPHORIA at Villain (March 30, 8 p.m.). This Vice-owned event space hosts a celebration of International Transgender Day of Visibility, organized by the media company’s female-focused internet channel. Following an afternoon fair for transgender-centered businesses, the evening session will culminate with a dance party hosted by the D.J. Bronze Goddess and the House of LaBeija, one of New York’s oldest drag houses. A performance by Big Freedia — the New Orleans-based rapper and an ambassador of the city’s distinctive bounce style, known for her high-profile collaborations with Beyoncé and Drake — is sure to be a highlight.eventbrite.com EARL SWEATSHIRT at Irving Plaza (March 30, 8 p.m.). For years, the rapper Thebe Kgositsile has been fighting against his own founding myth. Kgositsile, who performs as Earl Sweatshirt, got his start with the California collective Odd Future, gaining a following in 2010 as a viral teenage provocateur with an affinity for shock value and gore. Following his first mixtape, Kgositsile’s music started to show more vulnerability. His latest album, an exploratory set titled “Some Rap Songs,” considers family: A standout track, “Playing Possum,” incorporates sampled audio from his mother and recently deceased poet father. Kgositsile’s performance is sold out, but tickets are available through the resale market.212-777-6800, mercuryeastpresents.com [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] EX HEX at Bowery Ballroom (April 4, 8 p.m.). Technically skilled and wildly inventive, the rock nomad Mary Timony is routinely held up as a guitar god. With Ex Hex, the Washington-based trio she has led since 2014, Timony’s style pulls back from the experimentalism she embraced as the frontwoman of the riot-grrrl-adjacent group Helium in the 1990s. Rounded out by the bassist Betsy Wright and the drummer Laura Harris, Ex Hex play more straight-ahead garage rock; their second full-length recording, “It’s Real,” is packed with power chords, revved-up guitar solos and layered vocals — perfect fodder for the group’s notoriously fun live show.212-260-4700, mercuryeastpresents.com MATMOS AND KEITH FULLERTON WHITMAN at Pioneer Works (April 4, 7 p.m.). Both acts on this double bill work with experimental hybrids of electronic and organic sound. Since coming together in 1997, Matmos — the duo of Martin Schmidt and Drew Daniel — have obsessed over the materiality of music. They compose by gathering samples from diverse sources, like washing machines, animal cages or amplified nerve tissue; their new record, “Plastic Anniversary,” cleverly comments on the impending environmental crisis by drawing from all-plastic source material. Expect to hear selections from that album at this art center in Red Hook, Brooklyn, as well as the highly technical experiments in ambient and drone from the Brooklyn-based performer Whitman.pioneerworks.org DEEM SPENCER at Baby’s All Right (April 3, 8 p.m.). On his earliest releases, this soft-spoken rapper from Queens delivered a sound that might have been described as half-whispered, and half-finished, poetry. Last month’s “Pretty Face” — his first full-length recording — is built on the same melancholy lyricism and lo-fi production that defined previous projects, but it feels more resolute, nudging up the intensity on his heartsick ruminations. Spencer’s performance at this fittingly intimate club in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, is two milestones in one: his first headlining show in New York and the live debut of tracks from “Pretty Face.”718-599-5800, babysallright.comOLIVIA HORN BACHIR AND MUSTAPHA ATTAR at Roulette (March 30, 8 p.m.). The Master Musicians of Jajouka, a heritage band from a small village in Morocco, have become an influence on the rest of the world thanks to their work with Western stars such as Ornette Coleman, Bernardo Bertolucci and even the Rolling Stones. They’re defined by the sharp scrawl of the ghaita, a double-reed instrument, and the resounding pound of the tebel drum, which is made of goatskin and struck with wooden sticks. Bachir and Mustapha Attar are the sons of Hadj Abdesalam Attar, who led the Master Musicians when they made their first recordings in the 1960s. At this concert, part of the continuing A World in Trance festival, the Attar brothers will perform alongside three improvising musicians based in the United States: the saxophonist and clarinetist Ned Rothenberg; the saxophonist, vocalist and visual artist Arrington de Dionyso; and the percussionist Ben Bennett.917-267-0368, roulette.org BROKEN SHADOWS at the Village Vanguard (through March 31, 8:30 and 10:30 p.m.). The alto saxophonist Tim Berne, an outré doyen of the New York music scene, writes runic, sharp-edged, fiercely desiccated tunes. They’re a lot of fun if you’re the type who likes to question the entire phenomenology of “tunes” or, better yet, “fun.” Broken Shadows, his new band, which is about to release an album on the subscription-only Newvelle Records imprint, is more immediately rambunctious. This music is easy to sing along with, and to move to, partly because the group mostly plays the compositions of Ornette Coleman, and partly because of the personnel: the underappreciated tenor saxophonist Chris Speed, the wily bassist Reid Anderson and the gallivanting drummer Dave King.212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com EDDIE HENDERSON at Smoke (March 28-30, 7, 9 and 10:30 p.m.). In big-band jazz and bebop, a trumpeter was often responsible for adding a flare of percussive energy to the upper reaches of a group’s sound. In later forms of jazz, more heavily influenced by funk and soul, the instrument sometimes played more of a steadying role — holding sultry tones, projecting calm — while the rhythm section addressed questions of impact more directly. Eddie Henderson is comfortable in both circumstances, though he is more commonly associated with the jazz-funk movement of the 1970s, when he was known for work in his own bands and those led by Herbie Hancock. He performs here with Donald Harrison on alto saxophone, Peter Zak on piano, Essiet Okon Essiet on bass and Mike Clark on drums — most of whom appeared on “Be Cool,” Henderson’s strong album from 2018.212-864-6662, smokejazz.com SUSIE IBARRA at H0L0 (March 31, 7 p.m.). Ibarra plays the drums with cool precision and a sense of architectural awareness that befits a great composer. After all, she’s that too. Always blazing a new creative trail, she will present at H0L0 a fresh project, “Bird Songs,” featuring original music inspired by bird calls, with Jake Landau on guitar and keyboards and Jean-Luc Sinclair on electronics. The cellist Leila Bordreuil and the vocalist and performance artist Lauren Tosswill will open the show with separate solo performances.h0l0.nyc MARCUS MILLER at the Rose Theater (March 29-30, 8 p.m.). During the 1980s, Miller was the bassist and musical director in some of Miles Davis’s final bands; he wrote and produced almost every tune on “Tutu,” Davis’s Grammy-winning jazz-pop album from 1986. Here Miller will present a concert surveying the panorama of Davis’s electric period, which stretches back to the late 1960s, in an octet featuring Brett Williams on keyboards, Alex Han on saxophone, Marquis Hill and Russell Gunn on trumpet, Vernon Reid on guitar, Alex Bailey on drums and Mino Cinelu on percussion. Each night’s concert will be preceded by a discussion with Miller at 7 p.m.212-721-6500, jazz.org ‘TWO WINGS: THE MUSIC OF BLACK AMERICA IN MIGRATION’ at the Stern Auditorium (March 30, 8 p.m.). The operatic mezzo-soprano Alicia Hall Moran and the pianist Jason Moran, a MacArthur fellow, like to think beyond the idea of multimedia performance. In 2012, with “Bleed,” they transformed a floor at the Whitney Museum of American Art into a zone of convergence and exchange, inviting dozens of performers, scholars and healers to collaborate over a period of days. And on Saturday they will debut “Two Wings,” a community-crafted project that uses the Morans’ own family lore to interrogate the history of America’s Great Migration. The Morans’ fellow performers will include the vocalists Pastor Smokie Norful, Toshi Reagon and Hilda Harris, and the Imani Winds quintet. The historian Isabel Wilkerson will read portions of her definitive account of the Great Migration, “The Warmth of Other Suns.” The concert is part of “Migrations: The Making of America,” a continuing festival produced by Carnegie Hall.212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO "

ANTIBALAS at Brooklyn Bowl (March 15-16, 8 p.m.). This Brooklyn-based Afrobeat band is celebrating 20 years together with a two-night run, during which they will perform the kind of large-ensemble party music — think a vibrant horn section and multiple percussionists — that’s made them so irresistible for the past two decades. Their work incorporates dub, funk and jazz, creating a rich, textured version of the kind of global dance sound that’s become increasingly popular over the course of their career. On Friday, the music collective Innov Gnawa will open, and on Saturday, the hip-hop group Poetic Thrust will kick things off. 718-963-3369, brooklynbowl.com GARY CLARK JR. at the Beacon Theater (March 21-23, 8 p.m.). As a gifted blues guitarist, this Austin, Tex., native could easily stick to traditional sounds. But Clark continues to make songs that are expansive and forward-looking. He channels his remarkable technical ability toward hard-edge, political and genre-bending music that is nevertheless rooted in the blues, or at least its angst and earnestness. On his most recent album, “This Land,” he tackles racism and American politics through tunes that are anything but easy listening — and all the better for it.212-465-6000, beacontheatre.com GUSTER at the Beacon Theater (March 16, 8 p.m.). Since the members of this alternative rock band met during orientation at Tufts University in 1991, they have made consistently upbeat and pleasantly eccentric albums. Their latest, “Look Alive,” is their first release in four years, but their enthusiasm hasn’t dulled — at least if the album’s bright, polished, synth-driven indie-pop track list is any indication. Its sound is as approachable and harmony-rich as that of the songs that earned the still-independent band spots on mainstream soundtracks like “The O.C.” and “Wedding Crashers.”212-465-6000, beacontheatre.com [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] HABIB KOITÉ at Le Poisson Rouge (March 15, 8 p.m.). A virtuosic guitarist, Koité has cultivated his own niche within the string-rich musical culture of his native Mali. He uses unorthodox tunings and incorporates a global mix of flamenco and blues into his interpretation of dansa, a traditional form of Malian music from his hometown, Kayes. The resulting sound has reached international audiences and gained fans like Bonnie Raitt. Perhaps best known for his approachable 1998 album, “Ma Ya,” Koité, 61, continues to act as an ambassador of Mali’s music.212-505-3474, lpr.com LOUDON WAINWRIGHT III at Sony Hall (March 15, 8 p.m.). You might have already seen this show — it’s the live version of Wainwright’s recent Netflix special, “Surviving Twin,” which itself is the filmed version of a one-man set he’s been performing since 2013. “Surviving Twin” takes its title from a Wainwright song of the same name, which is about the singer-songwriter’s relationship with his father, Loudon Wainwright Jr.; the show, though, is about relationships between fathers and sons more broadly, including Wainwright’s son and fellow performer, Rufus.212-997-5123, sonyhall.com DALE WATSON AND KINKY FRIEDMAN at Union Pool (March 16, 7 p.m.). Two Texas titans visit Brooklyn this week to perform a brand of country music that’s so traditional, it has made them outsiders. Watson favors a polished rockabilly shuffle that sounds straight out of the 1960s, while Friedman tempers his irreverent, occasionally profane tunes with twangy guitar and banjos. Both are beloved for their willingness to buck trends (and any chance of mainstream success) and deftly play country music that transports listeners anywhere — even in Williamsburg — to an old-fashioned honky-tonk. 718-609-0484, union-pool.com NATALIE WEINER CARLA BLEY TRIO at Jazz Standard (March 19-20, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). Unlike her compositions — a lovable admixture of American folk songs, avant-garde jazz, soft rock and Romanticism — Bley, at age 82, remains a rather inaccessible figure. She doesn’t tour often, and she has long preferred the scholarly remove of a composer’s identity to the more public one of a bandleader. All of which makes this appearance, featuring her longstanding trio (Bley on piano, Steve Swallow on bass and Andy Sheppard on saxophones), something especially worth seeking out.212-576-2232, jazzstandard.com MARÍA GRAND at Roulette (March 21, 8 p.m.). A dauntless young tenor saxophonist whose concept and ambition seem to grow broader by the week, Grand is unwilling to accept anything as a given — stylistically, culturally, whatever. This concert, which she has titled “Music as a User’s Manual,” is meant to upend the passive relationship between audience and performance. How will she achieve this? That, presumably, depends on you as much as on her. But we know this: The first portion of the night will feature Grand alone, on saxophone and vocals; she’ll then be joined by Ganavya Doraiswamy on vocals, Joel Ross on vibraphone and Rajna Swaminathan on mridangam, for a separate set.917-267-0368, roulette.org LARRY GRENADIER at Zürcher Gallery (March 15, 8 p.m.). A leading jazz bassist since the 1990s, when he was a member of Brad Mehldau’s watershed trio, Grenadier recently put out his first solo-bass recording, “The Gleaners.” The album feels like a peek into a private world, as if you’re discovering the poems of a great writer who was known only for his essays. (In actuality, it’s inspired by film: specifically, Agnes Varda’s famed documentary about potato harvesters, “The Gleaners and I.”) For much of the record Grenadier focuses on arco playing, showing great range: He can use the bow to create spritzed, lively rhythms or a luminous, slow immersion. Abstraction would seem inherent to a solo-jazz-bass performance, but there’s nothing dreamlike about this album; his sound is as direct and powerful as it is elegant.galeriezurcher.com THANDISWA MAZWAI AND NDUDUZO MAKHATHINI at the Africa Center (March 15-16, 8 p.m.). Mazwai is an A-list celebrity in South Africa, where she upholds a long tradition of politically engaged pop singing. She rose to prominence in the 1990s as the lead vocalist in Bongo Maffin, a famed group in the kwaito genre (a kind of house music). In the years since she has become known as a solo artist carrying on the legacies of Miriam Makeba, Brenda Fassie and other vocalists who blended jazz, pop and South African folk music. Here she appears alongside Makhathini, a young pianist with a thriving career as both a sideman and a solo artist, always guided by an attentiveness to music’s potential for healing and renewal. This concert is presented as part of the Salon Africana series, which features performers chosen by the vocalist Somi.salonafricana.com CHARLES TOLLIVER at the Blue Note (March 14-17, 8 and 10:30 p.m.). A trumpeter with a strong, unvarnished attack, Tolliver launched his recording career in 1968 with the release of “Paper Man,” an epochal record reflecting the blend of post-bop, psychedelic rock, salsa and increasingly militant funk being played around New York City at the time. He celebrated the 50th anniversary of the record’s release last year in a triumphant performance at the Charlie Parker Jazz Festival, and this weekend at the Blue Note he will reprise the reprisal once again. In addition to the alto saxophonist Gary Bartz — who was in the quintet that recorded the original album — he will be joined by the pianist Vijay Iyer, the bassist Buster Williams and the drummer Lenny White.212-475-8592, bluenote.net ‘UNFORGETTABLE: THE MAGIC OF NAT KING COLE’ at Flushing Town Hall (March 15, 8 p.m.). The pianist and vocalist Nat King Cole — who died in 1965, at the height of his fame — would have turned 100 on Sunday. In honor of his life and legacy, the svelte and subtly inventive vocalist Sachal Vasandani will interpret songs from Cole’s repertoire with an all-star band: Shai Maestro on piano, Reuben Rogers on bass and Obed Calvaire on drums.718-463-7700, flushingtownhall.orgGIOVANNI RUSSONELLO KAREN O AND DANGER MOUSE at Florence Gould Hall (March 20, 7 p.m.). Jon Pareles, chief pop music critic for The New York Times, hosts an evening of music and conversation with the Yeah Yeah Yeahs frontwoman Karen O and the musician and producer Danger Mouse. On Friday, the duo will release “Lux Prima,” their first-ever collaboration. The audience will get to hear a selection of songs from the album during this discussion.timestalks.com "

A-TRAK at Marquee (March 22, 11 p.m.). A touring D.J. for Kanye West in the early 2000s, this Canadian turntablist quickly graduated from trusted collaborator to label boss: In 2007, he co-founded Fool’s Gold, a Brooklyn-based record company that has championed artists like Danny Brown and Kid Cudi. He has also released his own work through the label, including 2016’s “In the Loop: A Decade of Remixes,” a box set compiling a selection of his 200-plus credited remixes (most notably, his version of “Heads Will Roll” by the Yeah Yeah Yeahs). A-Trak celebrates his birthday with a guest set at this trendy West Chelsea nightclub. 646-473-0202, marqueeny.com MARIAH CAREY at Radio City Music Hall (March 25, 8 p.m.). Since the early 1990s, this powerhouse has put the full might of her five-octave voice behind radio hits that straddle genres, from the honeyed daze of “Always Be My Baby” to the hip-hop flair of her “Fantasy” remix featuring Ol’ Dirty Bastard. Currently, Carey is on the road touring her 15th studio album, “Caution” — a record graced by collaborators like Ty Dolla Sign and Dev Hynes. It prioritizes a more subdued, of-the-moment R&B sound over the vocal theatrics for which Carey is known. Still, expect the singer to dust off the showstoppers for her hometown crowd.  212-465-6000, radiocity.com FLOHIO at Baby’s All Right (March 22, 8 p.m.). This Nigeria-born, British-bred rapper makes her way to Brooklyn this weekend to perform hard-charging songs that draw together elements of grime, trap and techno. An energetic M.C., Flohio — whose given name is Funmi Ohiosuma — floods her music with a brashness that she attributes to her South London upbringing. Ohiosuma recently told The Guardian, “Rap isn’t meant to be too happy; there’s meant to be grit in there.” That attitude guides her recent EP, “Wild Yout,” on which she touts her authenticity and taunts her detractors. Released in November, it was the culminating effort of her breakout year. 718-599-5800, babysallright.com JOSÉ GONZÁLEZ at the Apollo Theater (March 21-22, 8 p.m.). In his solo work, this Swedish-Argentinian songwriter is a practiced minimalist, painting pictures with just his fingerpicked guitar and soft vocals. But González transforms in the company of collaborators. His sound expands whether he’s recording with the folk-rock group Junip or touring with the String Theory, an experimental orchestra from Berlin and Gothenburg with whom he released a live album last month. The String Theory will join him for his two-night run at the Apollo, performing new arrangements of songs from González’s three solo albums. 212-531-5305, apollotheater.org [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] KAIA KATER AND KARINE POLWART at Carnegie Hall (March 23, 9 p.m.). This double bill showcases a range of folk traditions, embraced by two distinctly contemporary artists. For Quebec-born Kater, the Canadian folk songs of her childhood and the Appalachian music she studied while attending college in West Virginia serve as touchstones; Polwart, meanwhile, draws from the musical heritage of her native Scotland. The noted political dimension in the songwriting of both women makes this a natural pairing: Kater has sung about the Black Lives Matter movement and political strife in her father’s home country of Grenada, and Polwart’s 2018 album, “Laws of Motion,” addresses Trumpism and the experiences of migrants. 212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org TORRES at Le Poisson Rouge (March 22, 8 p.m.). In the six years since she released her debut album, the Brooklyn-based singer Mackenzie Scott (a.k.a. Torres) has made the journey from quiet, confessional songwriter to adventurous, often boisterous rocker. On her most recent album, 2017’s “Three Futures,” Scott textured her guitar work with industrial and electronic sounds, aiming to create something that engaged all five senses. For her show at this Manhattan multimedia club, expect sensory engagement, beginning with her ritual preshow burning of palo santo sticks. Annie Hart, of the trio Au Revoir Simone, will open, setting the stage with lush, synth-driven pop songs. lpr.comOLIVIA HORN ALTERNATIVE GUITAR SUMMIT at various locations (March 21, 25 and 27-28, 7:30 p.m.). Organized by the guitarist Joel Harrison, the annual Alternative Guitar Summit gathers some of the most talented six-string improvisers in jazz, post-rock and world music. This year’s festival begins on Thursday with a 50th-anniversary celebration of the music of Woodstock, at Le Poisson Rouge in Greenwich Village. Harrison will play music from the Richie Havens and the Grateful Dead songbooks alongside the Everett Bradley Choir. The guitarist Ben Monder and the vocalist Jo Lawry will collaborate on music by John Sebastian and the Band. And the guitarist Nels Cline, who’s best known for his work in Wilco, will revisit Santana’s iconic Woodstock performance. The summit’s second concert takes place on Monday, when Cline, Leni Stern and others will pay tribute to the esteemed guitarist (and multi-instrumentalist) Ralph Towner at Drom, in the East Village. It concludes on Wednesday and Thursday at Jazz Standard with solo shows from Towner himself. (On the last two nights, there will be second sets at 9:30 p.m.) alternativeguitarsummit.com AARON DIEHL TRIO at the Baruch Performing Arts Center (March 28, 8 p.m.). Diehl’s piano playing has the same courtly, dapper flare as his wardrobe (he’s usually attired in a crisp, dark suit, sometimes topped off with a pair of thick-framed glasses). Picking up the mantle of midcentury greats like Bud Powell, Barry Harris and Cedar Walton, he espouses the ideal of jazz as America’s classical music, whether he’s performing standards or his own neo-traditionalist compositions. He may be best known for his work alongside Cécile McLorin Salvant, an eminent young vocalist, but at Baruch the spotlight will fall squarely on Diehl and his trio, which features the bassist David Wong and the drummer Aaron Kimmel. They will be playing music from his most recent album, “Space, Time, Continuum,” as well as some new pieces.212-352-3101, baruch.cuny.edu/bpac FIRE! AND MADALYN MERKEY at the Clemente Soto Vélez Cultural Center (March 28, 8 p.m.). The tenor saxophonist Mats Gustafsson, one of Europe’s most uncompromising free improvisers, angles toward the void in Fire!, a trio that includes the bassist Johan Berthling and the drummer Andreas Werliin. Whether scrawling an illegible smear of notes across the top of a pounding beat or erupting in fury as the rhythm dissolves beneath him, Gustafsson keeps the intensity high and your ears alight — even when his tone skews murky and dark. Fire! shares the bill here with Merkey, whose semi-ambient electronic music guides listeners into a kind of dreamlike state. This concert — Fire!’s first ever in New York — is presented by the nonprofit organization Blank Forms.blankforms.org DEREK GRIPPER at Roulette (March 23, 8 p.m.). Gripper, a South African guitarist, has developed a virtuoso approach to playing Malian music that was originally composed for instruments such as the kora (a 21-string instrument, somewhere between a harp and a guitar) and the ngoni (a possible progenitor of the banjo). He fingerpicks his classical guitar in percussive swirls, producing a sound that’s as enlivening as it is hypnotic. His repertoire includes music by the kora master Toumani Diabaté and the guitarist Ali Farka Touré, as well as folk songs from South Africa’s Western Cape. This concert kicks off the fifth annual A World in Trance festival, which spotlights music from around the world with explicitly spiritual overtones.917-267-0368, roulette.org MANUEL VALERA AND THE NEW CUBAN EXPRESS BIG BAND at Terraza 7 (March 28, 9 p.m.). Valera, a Cuban-born pianist with a blazingly fluent right hand and a mellifluous compositional style, has long led the New Cuban Express, a midsize band that integrates elements of contemporary New York jazz with Afro-Cuban forms. On Thursday he will premiere a big-band iteration of the ensemble, featuring the vocalist Sofía Rei and the alto saxophonist Román Filiú, plus 16 other instrumentalists.347-808-0518, terraza7.com WEBBER/MORRIS BIG BAND at the Jazz Gallery (March 22, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). The tenor saxophonist and flutist Anna Webber recently put out “Clockwise,” an album full of atonality and friction and discomfited momentum — not to mention, some of New York’s premier improvising musicians. Angela Morris, a fellow saxophonist, shares some of Webber’s style, while also drawing more heavily on the influence of Impressionist composers and jazz’s most ancient styles. They have been playing their ambitious original compositions in this big band for a few years, and supposedly there’s an album on the way — but so far all we have to show for it are a few YouTube clips and a bit of buzz on the scene. To really hear the Webber/Morris Big Band, you’ve got to go in person.646-494-3625, jazzgallery.nyc GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO "

COLONIZED DREAMS: A MIPSTERZ EVENT at the Knockdown Center (March 9, 6:30 p.m.). Mipsterz, a collective whose name merges “Muslim” and “hipsters,” is led by the filmmaker Abbas Rattani, the illustrator Sara Alfageeh and the musician Yusuf Siddiquee and promotes the work of Muslim artists across genres. For this showcase, the group has curated a lineup of Muslim musicians, writers and artists who are mostly from New York. Humeysha, the musical alias of the Brooklyn-based singer-songwriter Zain Alam, blends spacey indie rock with more traditional Indian sounds from instruments like the tabla and puja bells. The D.J. Ayes Cold connects bhangra music with hip-hop and R&B, while the Lebanese-American percussionist Adam Maalouf performs mostly on the pantam, an instrument created from the Trinidadian steel pan and southern India’s ghatam drum. 718-489-6285, knockdown.center MATTHEW DEAR at Elsewhere (March 8, 7 p.m.). A founding artist of the trendy electronic music label Ghostly International, Dear is better known as a bandleader, producer and D.J. whose work is steeped in Detroit techno. He has remixed songs for the likes of the XX and Spoon, and as a soloist, his work has long incorporated nearly equal parts electronic effects and live performance. On his latest album, 2018’s “Bunny,” which features Tegan and Sara and Greg Ahee from Protomartyr, Dear’s voice and songwriting give a more personal dimension to his reliably left-of-center yet dance-floor-ready beats.elsewherebrooklyn.com LITTLE FEAT at the Beacon Theater (March 8, 8 p.m.). At the half-century mark, a number of the musicians behind Little Feat’s best-known songs are still with the group, including the co-founder and pianist Bill Payne, the guitarist Paul Barrere, the percussionist Sam Clayton and the bassist Kenny Gradney. For this celebration of their 50 years onstage, expect a career-spanning retrospective that shows the range of this tricky-to-pin-down band, whose work spans country, funk, R&B and more. Regardless of what they’re playing, though, Little Feat have long been celebrated for their live act. 212-465-6000, beacontheatre.com [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] MEEK MILL at Hammerstein Ballroom (March 12-13, 8 p.m.). This Philadelphia-born rapper’s rise could hardly be more antithetical to 2019’s standard rap narrativeof getting discovered on SoundCloud by a major label, and then steering toward viral fame with the label’s help. Instead, Meek Mill took the long way to the top, first gaining credibility as a battle rapper and flirting with mainstream success, which was derailed by protracted legal battles and stints in prison. The strength of the work from the early years of his career, though — especially “Dreams and Nightmares,” the album cut that has become every underdog’s anthem, and the rapper’s best-known song — helped him push through. Finally, he is back in the world and back on the road. Both shows are sold out, but tickets are available through the resale market. 212-279-7740, mc34.com ROBYN at Madison Square Garden (March 8, 7 p.m.). “I was like, I’m not going to write one single sad love song,” this Swedish pop singer told The New York Times of her latest album, “Honey.” “And then when I started writing, it was sad love song, sad love song, sad love song. But it’s in a different way.” Robyn has spent over two decades turning those sad love songs into nightclub gold, in iterations that have made her both a Billboard hit maker (“Show Me Love” and “Do You Know (What It Takes)” and a cult favorite (“Call Your Girlfriend” and “Dancing on My Own”). 212-465-6741, msg.com WEEZER AND PIXIES at Madison Square Garden (March 12, 7 p.m.). These joint headliners offer some of the most enduring indie rock of the 1980s and ’90s — and TV on the Radio, who are opening, will represent the 2000s. Weezer have continued to release albums at a fairly prolific clip and still own a significant chunk of the alt-rock canon, from “Say It Ain’t So” to “Hash Pipe.” Their most recent brushes with the mainstream, though, have been less expected — namely, a viral cover of Toto’s “Africa.” After playing three nights at the comparatively cozy Brooklyn Steel last November, Pixies are bringing their unorthodox noise pop back to one of the city’s biggest stages.212-465-6741, msg.com NATALIE WEINER EZRA COLLECTIVE at Rough Trade NYC (March 9, 8:30 p.m.). Afrobeat from the 1970s, woozy new R&B, dub reggae and classic backpacker hip-hop all help define the sound of this London-based band’s new disc, “You Can’t Steal My Joy,” due next month. They have become something of a sensation, and the album is likely to be one of the year’s most-talked-about releases from Britain’s thriving contemporary jazz scene. The group — which features the brothers T. J. and Femi Koleoso on bass and drums, respectively; Joe Armon-Jones on keyboards; Dylan Jones on trumpet; and James Mollison on saxophone — will play material from the coming disc at this Brooklyn rock club.roughtradenyc.com VIJAY IYER AND CRAIG TABORN at Roulette (March 12, 8 p.m.). Two leading jazz pianists in their late 40s, Iyer and Taborn each have their own specific formulas, but both are built on a mix of studious abstraction and propulsive weight. Next week they will release their first album as a duo, the expansive, richly improvised “The Transitory Poems,” on ECM Records. The crystalline scatter of Taborn’s playing meets Iyer’s slightly thicker articulation in a sympathetic repartee; the pair seem to constantly divert their own path. They celebrate the album’s arrival at this concert, playing on two grand pianos.917-267-0368, roulette.org ‘IDENTITY: FREEDOM’ at the Kitchen (March 7-9, 8 p.m.). The nonprofit organization Arts for Art organized this series of concerts to highlight some of free jazz’s most respected elders, all of whom are presenting suite-length original works here. The festival begins on Thursday with “Trail of Tears Continuum (1492-2019),” a 90-minute piece composed by the bassist William Parker (a founder of Arts for Art) featuring singers, poets and a five-piece instrumental group, as well as a film component. On Friday, the pianist Dave Burrell debuts “Harlem Renaissance,” a response to the life and work of the dancer Josephine Baker; Burrell’s sextet will play in conversation with two dancers, Marguerite Hemmings and J’royce Jata. The series concludes on Saturday with a presentation of Andrew Cyrille’s “Haitian Fascination” project, in which this storied drummer fuses the music of Haiti — his ancestral home — with avant-garde jazz.212-255-5793, thekitchen.org MIYA MASAOKA at the Park Avenue Armory (March 13, 7 and 9 p.m.). Masaoka’s style on the koto, a long, stringed instrument from Japan, bespeaks deep equanimity: She is comfortable allowing vast amounts of open space — playing quietly, just a few notes at a time — but within that serene composure she strategically builds a feeling of tensile anticipation. You can lie down and stretch out inside her music, but you can’t ever get completely comfortable. An eclectic collaborator across the worlds of traditional and avant-garde music, at the armory she debuts “The Long Arc of Time,” a work inspired by traditional Japanese Buddhist chants and by the poetry of Tracie Morris. The performance will feature Masaoka alongside fellow Japanese and American musicians and the soprano Kamala Sankaram.212-616-3930, armoryonpark.org OMAR SOSA AND SECKOU KEITA at Merkin Hall (March 9, 7:30 p.m.). Sosa, a Cuban pianist of great percussive power and fluid grace, released a collaborative album in 2017 with Keita, a Senegalese master of the kora (a West African stringed instrument typically used to create spiraling layers of rhythm), and the Venezuelan percussionist Gustavo Ovalles. Here the trio will perform some of the pristine, soothing music from that release. All three of these musicians now live in Europe, so a New York sighting is rare — especially featuring all of them together.212-501-3330, kaufmanmusiccenter.org KAMAAL WILLIAMS at Le Poisson Rouge (March 9, 7:30 p.m.). This young keyboardist crafts tightly woven grooves that are equally influenced by the cosmic soul-jazz of the 1970s as they are by the broken-beat and nu-jazz traditions of his native London. Partly thanks to his work in the short-lived but widely acclaimed duo Yussef Kamaal, Williams finds himself at the front of a crowded pack of young keyboardists on the busy British scene. Here he’s likely to draw heavily on the material from his debut solo album, last year’s Herbie Hancock-indebted “The Return.”212-505-3474, lpr.com MIGUEL ZENÓN at the Village Vanguard (March 12-17, 8:30 and 10:30 p.m.). One of the most casually prodigious alto saxophonists of today, Zenón devotes most of his creative energy to exploring the music of his native Puerto Rico, always through a vigorously intellectual lens. Last year he released a striking album, “Yo Soy La Tradición,” featuring music sourced largely from Puerto Rican folk traditions, retrofitted for saxophone and string quartet. And later this month, he will join up again with his longstanding jazz quartet to record a new album devoted to the music of Ismael Rivera, a heroic popular vocalist in Puerto Rico during the late 1960s and the ’70s. At this Vanguard run, the group — featuring Luis Perdomo on piano, Hans Glawischnig on bass and Henry Cole on drums — will set about breaking in this new material.212-255-4037, villagevanguard.comGIOVANNI RUSSONELLO LOU REED DRONES at the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine (March 13, 6:30 p.m.). Physics and music nerds, unite and rejoice! The moment you have been collectively awaiting has arrived: A handful of Lou Reed’s guitars, curated by his technician Stewart Hurwood, will be arranged against a stack of amplifiers and tuned to create a glorious noise that will morph as you wander about in this acoustically splendid cathedral. Holy feedback! It should be glorious.stjohndivine.org/calendarDANIELLE DOWLING "

EL GRAN COMBO AND LA SONORA PONCEÑA at Radio City Music Hall (Feb. 16, 8 p.m.). That two of the world’s most enduring and renowned salsa bands are booked at a theater with permanent seats is a bit of a head scratcher, but few performance spaces are large enough to accommodate the legions of fans both El Gran Combo and La Sonora Ponceña have accrued during their decades of performance. Both bands hail from Puerto Rico; the former was founded in 1962 by Rafael Ithier, who still leads it today, while the latter was established in 1954 — eight years after its current leader, Enrique Lucca Jr., was born. Expect plenty of dancing in the aisles. 212-465-6225, radiocity.com INTERPOL at Madison Square Garden (Feb. 16, 8 p.m.). This show is a homecoming for these indie stalwarts, who met at N.Y.U. and started making dark, stripped-down rock music in the late 1990s. Fifteen years after their breakthrough album “Antics” and on the heels of their 2018 release “Marauder,” Interpol is back at the Garden with a remarkable opening lineup that provides a good snapshot of alternative rock music today. You’ll want to get to the arena early to catch Snail Mail, the name under which the buzzy singer-songwriter Lindsey Jordan performs, and the breezy indie favorites Car Seat Headrest. 212-465-6741, msg.com METRIC AND ZOÉ at Kings Theater (Feb. 18, 7 p.m.). The brash, synth-driven, dance-inspired rock of Toronto’s Metric has remained relatively constant over the 16 years since the band’s first studio album, “Old World Underground, Where Are You Now?” — the zeitgeist, though, has shifted dramatically. When they came onto the scene, Metric was surrounded by like-minded alternative rockers such as TV on the Radio and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. But even as Metric’s music veers from the trend, they appear indefatigable; 2018’s “Art of Doubt” is a testament to their artistic vitality. The Mexican rock band Zoé, who have shown similar endurance over their nearly two decades at the forefront of their genre, co-headline this Brooklyn show. 718-856-5464, kingstheatre.com BOB MOULD BAND at Brooklyn Steel (Feb. 21, 8 p.m.). As the frontman for the bands Hüsker Dü and Sugar, this singer and guitarist found his niche with cathartic yet approachable rock jams. Hüsker Dü, who were active through most of the 1980s, have attained considerable retroactive renown for the way their blend of punk and alternative rock anticipated grunge. Their niche acclaim stands in stark contrast with Sugar, Mould’s band in the early 1990s, which had a brighter sound and hits on Billboard’s alternative charts. His latest release, “Sunshine Rock,” is almost like a blend of these two styles, combining the fierceness of Hüsker Dü with the optimism of Sugar. 888-929-7849, bowerypresents.com PANDA BEAR at Pioneer Works (Feb. 14-15, 7 p.m.). Animal Collective’s co-founder Noah Lennox has released six solo albums under this zoological alias, stretching out the band’s signature experimental, reverb-heavy dance music to include even more unexpected sounds and forms. Lennox’s most recent album, “Buoys,” eschews some of those ornate layers of synths and chaotic postproduction effects that have made his work so psychedelic and instead embraces straightforward songs that put his own, relatively unobscured voice front and center. Where his last album, “Panda Bear Meets the Grim Reaper,” had a harder edge, “Buoys” features gentle, acoustic songs that still have some unconventional filigree. 718-596-3001, pioneerworks.org [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] THE ’70S SOUL JAM VALENTINE’S CONCERT at the Beacon Theater (Feb. 16, 3 and 8 p.m.). It’s hard to think of a genre more explicitly associated with romance than the R&B and soul of the 1970s, with the lush arrangements and seductively slow tempos. Fittingly, some of the artists behind the era’s date-night-appropriate hits will gather for two Valentine’s Day-themed shows on the Upper West Side. Featured artists include the Philadelphia-based soul groups the Stylistics (“You Are Everything”), the Delfonics (“La-La Means I Love You”) and Blue Magic (“Sideshow”); the funk-inflected band Bloodstone (“Natural High”); and the quiet storm pioneers the Manhattans (“Kiss and Say Goodbye”). 212-465-6085, beacontheatre.com VINCE STAPLES at the Hammerstein Ballroom (Feb. 21, 8 p.m.). At 25 years old, this rapper from Long Beach, Calif., has made three critically acclaimed albums that flirt with rap’s avant-garde while retaining mainstream credibility. His music and his public persona — the sardonic Twitter star who wears his gang affiliation (Crips) and his Sprite endorsement on his sleeve with equal aplomb — suggest that this praise has not skewed his lucidity regarding the streets he grew up on and still uses as source material. His latest release, “FM!,” is a concise 22 minutes of songs that are as fun to listen to as they are thought-provoking. 212-279-7740, mc34.comNATALIE WEINER ETHNIC HERITAGE ENSEMBLE at Nublu 151 (Feb. 21, 8 p.m.). A master percussionist and eminence of Chicago’s creative music scene, Kahil El’Zabar channels a deep sense of history into his music, coming away with something timeless and universal and enchanted. For over 40 years, he has led the Ethnic Heritage Ensemble, usually as a trio featuring a rotating cast of horn players and flutists. But he recently expanded it into a quartet, with Alex Harding on baritone saxophone, Corey Wilkes on trumpet and Ian Maksin on cello. At Nublu the band celebrates the release of “Be Heard,” which will be out in March on the audiophile Spiritmuse Records.nublu.net MORGAN GUERIN QUINTET at the Jazz Gallery (Feb. 15-16, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). Though still in his early 20s, Guerin has already started to accrue a reputation as a jaw-dropping musical polymath. On Friday, he will play drums and bass in a quintet performing new, original music; on Saturday, he will again perform his own tunes with a five-piece band, but this time he will be on a saxophone, an electronic wind instrument and a synthesizer. If the music is anything like his two releases thus far (“The Saga” and “The Saga II”), it will be a broadly sourced form of contemporary electric fusion, centered on luminous, morphing textures and elegantly lyrical songwriting.646-494-3625, jazzgallery.nyc KIRK KNUFFKE TRIO at Zinc Bar (Feb. 20, 7:30 and 9 p.m.). A cornetist, Knuffke has a strong sense of his instrument’s history and expressive range, but his playing seems always tinged with a playful optimism. He has been one of the most compelling sidemen on the New York scene for at least a decade now, and more recently he’s been quietly releasing a series of fascinating albums of his own. The most recent, “Witness,” found Knuffke teaming up with the operatic baritone Steven Herring, plus two fellow jazz improvisers. It was unlike any other album in recent memory — and at times utterly transporting. Here Knuffke appears in a trio featuring the bass guitarist Stomu Takeishi and the drummer Bill Goodwin.212-477-9462, zincjazz.com JOE LOVANO, DAVE LIEBMAN AND GREG OSBY at Birdland (Feb. 19-23, 8:30 and 11 p.m.). Three of the best saxophonists in straight-ahead jazz and its affiliated territories, Lovano (tenor saxophone), Liebman (soprano) and Osby (alto) join up this week with a trio of all-star side musicians: the pianist Phil Markowitz, the bassist Cecil McBee and the drummer Billy Hart. All six of these players have been among jazz’s most respected figures since at least the 1980s, and all continue to barrel forward creatively.212-581-3080, birdlandjazz.com DIANNE REEVES at the Rose Theater (Feb. 15-16, 8 p.m.). For the eighth year in a row, Reeves will headline Jazz at Lincoln Center’s main stage during Valentine’s Day weekend. She became a National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master last year, adding a punctuation mark to a career already known to be one of the most distinguished in jazz. Her voice has the power and clarity of Sarah Vaughan’s, and her repertoire only continues to expand: Her most recent album, “Beautiful Life,” from 2014, which won a Grammy, included riveting, personalized renditions of tunes by Fleetwood Mac, Bob Marley and Esperanza Spalding, as well as some Reeves originals.212-721-6500, jazz.org DAYNA STEPHENS QUARTET at the Village Vanguard (Feb. 19-24, 8:30 and 10:30 p.m.). A tenor saxophonist of svelte articulation and beaming tone, Stephens plays contemporary jazz with an emphasis on emotive clarity. His improvisations hold your attention thanks to careful, smart pacing, and Stephens’s willingness to sprinkle moments of simple beauty into his counterintuitive flights. This week is the 40-year-old saxophonist’s debut as a bandleader at the Village Vanguard, where he’s joined by Aaron Parks on piano, Ben Street on bass and Gregory Hutchinson on drums.212-255-4037, villagevanguard.comGIOVANNI RUSSONELLO "

LIZ COOPER & THE STAMPEDE at Rough Trade (Feb. 27, 9 p.m.). This lilting Nashville rock trio gives new meaning to the label “easy listening” with their tempered, dreamy psychedelia. Gentle grooves and softly arpeggiated guitars take the place of sprawling, climactic jams, yet their songwriting is taut enough that the audience is never in danger of being lulled to sleep. The band has made refining their live show a priority, touring their songs for three years — including as support for Bermuda Triangle, the side project of the Alabama Shakes frontwoman Brittany Howard — before heading into the studio. Their 2018 debut, “Window Flowers,” is summery and bright, well suited to mitigating New York’s winter chill.718-388-4111, roughtradenyc.com THE DREAM at the Bowery Ballroom (Feb. 26, 8 p.m.). Praising this producer, singer and songwriter for fidelity to his artistic vision might seem odd. After all, he is responsible for some of the biggest pop hits of the past 15 years, including Rihanna’s “Umbrella” and Beyoncé’s “Single Ladies.” In his work as a solo artist, though, the Dream remains steadfast in his commitment to achingly slow, explicitly bedroom-ready R&B jams. Combining his high, often-AutoTuned voice with layers of synths and understated beats, he has made himself into a new model of R&B maestro. 212-260-4700, boweryballroom.com JULIA HOLTER at Warsaw (Feb. 22, 9 p.m.). To call Holter a singer-songwriter feels reductive, given the wide-ranging abstract soundscapes she creates with a nearly endless array of instruments and electronic tools. In her compositions, this California native finds common ground between the baroque and the futuristic, the ancient (her latest album, “Aviary,” includes a musical interpretation of a poem by Sappho) and the modern (another track was inspired by Alice Coltrane’s “Universal Consciousness”). The one thing listeners won’t find in Holter’s music is compromise: It’s about as unusual and boundary pushing as anything labeled pop music can get, and all the more exciting for it. 212-777-6800, warsawconcerts.com JOHN MELLENCAMP at the Beacon Theater (Feb. 25-27, 8 p.m.). This legendary rock singer and songwriter is best known for his ability to capture the heartland — as he describes in his biggest hit, “Jack & Diane” — in accessible, catchy songs. But since his 1980s heyday, Mellencamp has shed most of the trappings of commercial rock (including his myriad stage names) in favor of more straightforward blues arrangements courtesy of the super-producer T Bone Burnett. For his latest album, 2018’s “Other People’s Stuff,” Mellencamp produces and performs, revisiting a number of covers he had previously recorded in the rootsy style that is now his signature.212-465-6000, beacontheatre.com SON LITTLE at BRIC House Ballroom (Feb. 28, 8 p.m.). The folksy blues put forth by this Philadelphia-based singer-songwriter, who has also written songs for Mavis Staples and collaborated with the Roots, can be intimate, acoustic and mostly unadorned, or up-tempo and groovy, as it is on his most recent album “New Magic.” A deep understanding of classic American roots music ties his records together, lending them old-school credibility even as the occasional unorthodox production choice gives his work a contemporary feel. The Canadian singer-songwriter Melissa Laveaux and the folk singer Christopher Paul Stelling open. 718-683-5600, bricartsmedia.org SON LUX at the Appel Room (Feb. 28, 8:30 p.m.). The art music composer Ryan Lott, the experimental drummer and percussionist Ian Chang and the jazz-schooled guitarist Rafiq Bhatia have forged their talents to create airy, unconventional pop under the name Son Lux. Incredibly active as soloists, these artists channel their more esoteric skills into this project, which attracts alternative rock and electronic music audiences as well as aficionados of contemporary composition. In 2018, the trio released their fifth album, “Brighter Wounds,” which puts seemingly incongruous sounds — like screeching, dissonant strings and bluesy guitar riffs — adjacent to one another for a compelling, unpredictable result.212-721-6500, lincolncenter.orgNATALIE WEINER BRITTANY ANJOU at Le Poisson Rouge (Feb. 25, 8 p.m.). This pianist just released “Enamigo Reciprokataj,” a debut album with a double meaning: Translated from Esperanto, its title can mean “Reciprocal Love” or “Mutual Breakdown.” It makes sense that Anjou would speak in double-entendre, in a language that’s at once universal and abstruse. The album is full of broadly sourced melodies that are bright and lyrical and quick, and work by their own clever logic. (She has studied jazz in New York, Western classical in Prague, and gyil music in Ghana; she’s currently an artist in residence at Kuwait’s Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad Cultural Center opera house.) Anjou celebrates the release of “Enamigo Reciprokataj” with Greg Chudzik on bass and Shirazette Tinnin on drums. The bassist Ari Folman-Cohen will participate as a special guest.212-505-3474, lpr.com BRENT BIRCKHEAD at Nublu 151 (Feb. 22, 8 p.m.). When he’s not on the road with Lauryn Hill’s band, this alto saxophonist is often found in the basement of Smalls, partaking of late-night jam sessions with other young jazz improvisers. Struck with bluesy warmth and the relentless swing of Cannonball Adderley, Birckhead’s playing has lately established him as one of the most riveting young improvisers in New York. On his impressive debut album, “Birckhead,” his R&B sojourns and his straight-ahead jazz background come to bear, resulting in a sound that skates the divide between svelte swagger and cutting passion. The record finds the young bandleader meditating on romance, personal growth and the travails of his native Baltimore; he will celebrate its release at Nublu with Corey Wallace on trombone, Marc Cary on piano, Jon Michel on bass and Curtis Nowosad on drums.nublu.net PETER EVANS WITH MAZZ SWIFT AND RON STABINSKY at National Sawdust (Feb. 27, 7 p.m.). An unassailable young virtuoso on trumpet, Evans uses extended technique to create some of the most darkly inscrutable music around. At National Sawdust as part of John Zorn’s monthly Commissioning Series, Evans presents two sets of original music: a solo trumpet work, and a series of compositions for violin and piano, performed by Swift and Stabinsky.646-779-8455, nationalsawdust.org LOUIS HAYES at the Iridium (Feb. 22, 8 p.m.). This 81-year-old drummer plays straight-ahead jazz with a big, broad swing feel, and a built-in sense of the Afro-Latin underpinnings of jazz rhythm. His mix of nuanced syncopation and raw power helped define some quintessential hard-bop groups of the 1960s, led by figures such as Cannonball Adderley and Oscar Peterson. His most recent album as a leader is “Serenade for Horace,” from 2017, a tribute to the pianist Horace Silver. He appears here with Vincent Herring on alto saxophone, David Hazeltine on piano and Dezron Douglas on bass.212-582-2121, theiridium.com IRREVERSIBLE ENTANGLEMENTS, AMINA CLAUDINE MYERS AND NICOLE MITCHELL at Merkin Hall (Feb. 28, 7:30 p.m.). This concert brings together some of the most deeply rooted and wildly inventive storytellers in improvised music. A pianist and vocalist, Myers, 76, was an early member of Chicago’s Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians; she writes and performs music with hard-bound connections to gospel and blues, and an expansive approach to improvising. Mitchell, a flutist, became the association’s first female chair 10 years ago; her music often deals in grand themes of science fiction and heroism. The group Irreversible Entanglements is a scalding, free-improvising quintet featuring the young performance poet Camae Ayewa (known as Moor Mother in her solo work), who draws connections across epochs of African and American history, making sense of trauma and gathering power to take action today. At this Ecstatic Music Festival show, these three acts will perform together for the first time.212-501-3330, kaufmanmusiccenter.org ARUAN ORTIZ AND DON BYRON at Mezzrow (Feb. 27, 8 and 9:30 p.m.). Two ecumenical improvisers with a mix of jazz vocabulary and classical precision, Ortiz, a Cuban-born pianist, and Byron, an American clarinetist, released a powerful album of duets last year, “Random Dances and (A)tonalities.” It included takes on pieces by Duke Ellington, Johann Sebastian Bach and Geri Allen, as well as a few twisty, centrifugal original tunes. At Mezzrow, an intimate basement club, they will play repertoire from that album.646-476-4346, mezzrow.com KAMASI WASHINGTON at the Apollo Theater (Feb. 23, 8 p.m.). Over the past four years, Washington has made greater inroads into the mainstream than any jazz musician of his generation. He’s done it by threading together opposing traditions from his native Los Angeles, each with its own surprising resonance today: grooving, dance-inflected jazz-funk from the 1970s and ’80s, and the looser, more expressionistic music of avant-garde artists such as Horace Tapscott and Bobby Bradford. At the Apollo, leading a 10-piece iteration of his band, the Next Step, Washington will play selections from his hit albums, “The Epic” (2015) and “Heaven and Earth” (2018).212-531-5305, apollotheater.orgGIOVANNI RUSSONELLO REMEMBERING JONAS: A TRIBUTE TO JONAS MEKAS at City Winery (Feb. 21, 8 p.m.). If you desire another opportunity to honor Mekas’s life, Patti Smith, John Zorn, Lee Renaldo, Richard Barone, David Amram and Glenn Mercer are getting together to give you a musical one. Along with the film critic Amy Taubin and other special guests, these musicians are gathering tonight to pay homage to the pioneering filmmaker through song and spoken word. Proceeds will benefit Anthology Film Archives, Mekas’s dream home for avant-garde cinema that he made real with the help of Jerome Hill, P. Adams Sitney, Peter Kubelka and Stan Brakhage in 1970. 212-608-0555, citywinery.comDANIELLE DOWLING "

PAT GREEN at Terminal 5 (March 2, 7 p.m.). Escape to the Lone Star state at this show, which features four acts whose sound belongs to the Texas-specific country subgenre known as red dirt. Green, who had a string of radio hits in the mid-2000s, is the elder statesman of this lineup. He’ll be joined by the Eli Young Band, who are currently on the country charts with their upbeat single “Love Ain’t,” as well as by Aaron Watson and Kyle Park — two artists who are stalwarts on the rodeo circuit. The common thread is a rough-around-the-edges, rock-tinged take on country music that never strays too far from the genre’s dancehall roots. 212-582-6600, terminal5nyc.com ICE CUBE at Terminal 5 (March 6, 8 p.m.). Gen Z might only know this pioneering Los Angeles-based rapper as an approachable blockbuster star or, most recently, one of the moguls behind the BIG3 basketball league. But this N.W.A. alum still has a rich catalog of songs that were once considered subversive but are now classic. Both in N.W.A. and as a soloist, Ice Cube helped revolutionize rap with his cleareyed lyrics about police brutality, white supremacy and gang life. His unflinching political observations continue on his 2018 release “Everythangs Corrupt,” which includes a song called “Arrest the President.” 212-582-6600, terminal5nyc.com INNOV GNAWA at National Sawdust (March 2, 7:30 p.m.). This collective of Moroccan expatriates makes gnawa, or ritual trance music. It bears some of the same stylistic traits as American blues: call-and-response singing and a stringed instrument (in the case of gnawa, a sintir) that is used to establish harmony. The complicated, endlessly cycling rhythms, though, are distinct to the genre and create a soothing, meditative ambience. This performance is billed not as a concert, but as an “immersive gnawa ritual.” 646-779-8455, nationalsawdust.org [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] LOVE ROCKS NYC at the Beacon Theater (March 7, 8 p.m.). For the third year running, the designer John Varvatos and the real estate broker Greg Williamson have organized an all-star concert to benefit the New York charity God’s Love We Deliver, which provides food and support to people with life-threatening illnesses. This year’s edition will star Robert Plant, Sheryl Crow, Buddy Guy, Grace Potter, Keb’ Mo’, Taj Mahal, Lukas Nelson, Doyle Bramhall II, Bernie Williams, Ivan Neville, Ann and Nancy Wilson, and more, while Whoopi Goldberg and Martin Short host. Even the house band will be filled with music’s A-listers, including Paul Shaffer, the former musical director of “Late Show With David Letterman,” and the prolific drummer Steve Gadd. 212-465-6000, beacontheatre.com THE NEW COLOSSUS FESTIVAL at various locations (March 7-10). For 35 years, the CMJ Music Marathon was New York City’s very own pleasantly overwhelming indie music festival, where up-and-coming artists took over performance spaces every October in the interest of getting heard by myriad journalists and record label reps trolling for talent. But it ended in 2016, and a new festival aims to fill the void it left behind while also catching international artists en route to South by Southwest in Austin, Tex. In its first year as a multiday event, at six different clubs across the Lower East Side, the event will feature over 100 acts, including the Canadian D.I.Y. act Ellis, the Brooklyn-based punk band Thick and the Norwegian alt-pop group Das Body. newcolossusfestival.com KODIE SHANE at S.O.B.’s (March 6, 8 p.m.). At a moment when there are more commercially successful women in rap than there have been at any point since the early 2000s — when, in fact, one of the genre’s biggest and buzziest artists, Cardi B, is a woman — it looks even more foolish than usual to define M.C.s like Chicago’s Kodie Shane by their gender. The 20-year-old rapper, who is based in Atlanta, first drew recognition as a member of Lil Yachty’s Sailing Team collective and favors similarly melodic, AutoTuned verses over trap beats. In place of Yachty’s whimsy, though, on songs like “Sing to Her,” Shane tends toward the undeniably sultry. 212-243-4940, sobs.com SUZANNE VEGA at Café Carlyle (March 5-9, 8:45 p.m.; through March 16). This New York-based singer-songwriter has been composing and performing folk-inspired acoustic tunes since she was a Barnard student in the early 1980s. The venerable cabaret Café Carlyle might be considerably more upscale than Tom’s Restaurant — the Upper West Side student haunt that inspired Vega’s enduring and influential single “Tom’s Diner” — but both offer a glimpse of a bygone New York. A product of the bohemian Greenwich Village folk scene, which has all but disappeared, Vega herself presents an evening of time travel to a completely different period in the city’s history. 800-405-2027, cafecarlylenewyork.com NATALIE WEINER AMBROSE AKINMUSIRE at the Village Vanguard (March 5-10, 8:30 and 10:30 p.m.). A young trumpeter at the top of his game, Akinmusire is coming off the release of last year’s “Origami Harvest,” his stellar fifth album, featuring long-form compositions for voice, string quartet and jazz combo. In the coming week he returns to the Vanguard — a familiar stomping ground — with his quintet, which features Walter Smith III on tenor saxophone, Sullivan Fortner on piano, Harish Raghavan on bass and Justin Brown on drums. Expect original music with a smoky, drifting aesthetic, and group interplay that overflows the formal boundaries of most small-group jazz.212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com KURT ELLING at the Rose Theater (March 1-2, 8 p.m.). An esteemed jazz crooner whose vocal power is matched by his cool sensitivity to each song, Elling presents the premiere of “The Big Blind,” a drama in the format of an old radio musical. Written by Elling and the composer Phil Galdston, it tells of a young jazz singer in midcentury Chicago who’s trying to catch his big break. The show’s cast includes the vocalist Dee Dee Bridgewater (a National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master), the stage actor Ben Vereen, the drummer Ulysses Owens Jr.’s New Century Jazz Orchestra and a Foley artist providing live sound effects.212-721-6500, jazz.org IMPROV NIGHTS at Happylucky No. 1 (March 1-2, 8 p.m.). John Zorn continues to expand the footprint of the Stone, his avant-garde presenting shop, which left behind its spartan digs in Alphabet City last year and moved to the New School’s Glass Box Theater. Now Zorn is planting a flag in central Brooklyn, too: This weekend his new series debuts at Happylucky No. 1, a gallery and event space in Crown Heights. The Stone will be programming concerts there each weekend going forward. (Bookings have already been made through the end of 2019.) Things are kicking off in classic Stone fashion: two nights of round-robin improvisations with some of New York’s leading creative musicians (the cellist Okkyung Lee, the guitarist Mary Halvorson, the percussionist Cyro Baptista and more than a dozen others) performing in randomly thrown-together configurations.www.happyluckyno1.com JULIAN LAGE TRIO at Le Poisson Rouge (March 5, 8:30 p.m.). Lage, a 31-year-old guitar virtuoso, just released a winning new album, “Love Hurts.” It might be the closest thing he’s released to a straight-ahead jazz record. But with the bassist Jorge Roeder and the drummer Dave King — two left-field improvisers a generation ahead of him — at his side, a freewheeling, rock-tinged vibe finds its way in through the seams. Ever the adaptive player, Lage leans into the influences of Pat Martino and John Scofield here, playing his distorted electric guitar in snaky, spiraling lines. The trio’s repertoire ranges from Ornette Coleman to Roy Orbison to some of Lage’s own tunes.212-505-3474, lpr.com ADAM O’FARRILL’S BIRD BLOWN OUT OF LATITUDE AND AARON BURNETT AND THE BIG MACHINE at National Sawdust (March 5, 7 p.m.). A blazing young trumpet talent, O’Farrill will unveil a new nine-piece ensemble that plays original music with a political bent: The tunes he writes for Bird Blown Out of Latitude are inspired by the traumas caused by displacement and forced migration. The tenor saxophonist Burnett is, like O’Farrill, an arresting improviser with an idiosyncratic, confrontational approach to composition. Here he will present material from his recently released album, “Anomaly,” with his combo, the Big Machine.646-779-8455, nationalsawdust.org LINDA MAY HAN OH QUINTET at the Miller Theater (March 2, 8 p.m.). As part of a continuing jazz series at the Miller, Oh, a young bassist, will lead a quintet, showcasing her sturdy, propulsive original compositions, likely drawing from her fine 2017 album, “Walk Against Wind.” Her band at the Miller features the alto saxophonist Greg Ward, the guitarist Matthew Stevens, the pianist Fabian Almazan and the drummer Allan Mednard.212-854-7799, millertheatre.com ALFREDO RODRIGUEZ AND PEDRITO MARTINEZ at Jazz Standard (Feb. 28-March 3, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). Rodriguez, a pianist, and Martinez, a percussionist and vocalist, are masters of Afro-Cuban rhythm who both hail from Havana, though they learned their craft in different settings: Rodriguez at clubs and solares — the housing units where much of Cuba’s African musical inheritance is passed down — and Martinez at various conservatories in the city. On “Duologue,” their new, Quincy Jones-produced album, the pair find plenty of generative energy in the space between their styles. They appear at the Standard in an unadorned duo.212-576-2232, jazzstandard.com GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO "
5c64698d3a125f5075c09891,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/13/books/review/walk-this-way-geoff-edgers.html,"WALK THIS WAY Run-DMC, Aerosmith, and the Song That Changed American Music Forever By Geoff Edgers In 2017 Nielsen Music reported that hip-hop and R & B had officially surpassed rock as America’s most-consumed genre. The news elicited international headlines, but for many of us it elicited a yawn. Who didn’t know by then that hip-hop was not just — to cite the rapper Nas, the comedian Katt Williams and countless pundits of the past decade — “as American as apple pie,” but one of America’s greatest exports: a music, culture and ethos that lives and breathes from California to Cape Town, New York to New Delhi? It wasn’t always so, of course. Such is the premise of Geoff Edgers’ “Walk This Way: Run-DMC, Aerosmith, and the Song That Changed American Music Forever,” which argues that before the July 4, 1986, release of the hit in his title — one of the first rap songs played on mainstream radio, the genre’s first in the Billboard Top 10 — almighty hip-hop was merely “a small underground community of independent labels and scrappy promoters.” As Edgers, the national arts reporter for The Washington Post, tells it, the crossover rap-rock tune “made it safe to be black and mainstream,” “proved that hip-hop, dismissed by many as a fad, had legs” and became “so many things to so many different people, from bar mitzvah boys in Westchester County to Ice-T.” It accomplished that, essentially, by being “hip-hop’s Trojan horse, the music camouflaged enough to give timid programmers permission to play”; this fomented a movement like the Harlem Renaissance and San Francisco’s Summer of Love, one that “crossed geographical, economic and, most important, racial lines.” All of this is well-trod territory. There has been no dearth of ink spilled about Run-DMC, Aerosmith or hip-hop’s rise to cultural domination. So in a book that is occasionally hyperbolic yet fastidiously thorough — sometimes too thorough: “Walk This Way” grew from a long-form article and often feels better suited as one, unless you’re enthralled by the nitty-gritty of industry insider-ness — Edgers carves out a niche by creating in narrative fashion the very mash-up he’s documenting, merging two racial and spatial histories just as Run-DMC and Aerosmith’s hit fused disparate sounds and scenes. On the one hand, there’s the sex, drugs and rock ’n’ roll story of Bronx-raised Steven Tallarico, joining forces with Joe Perry in ’70s-era Boston to become Steven Tyler of Aerosmith. Edgers pegs the two as polar opposites: While “Perry has his personality knob set on permanent mumble,” Tyler “blasts into a conversation. He makes up words and phrases and draws on entire waiting rooms of personalities. He dances across decades, cities and relationships.” They made an electrifying onstage duo — until they fell victim to the clichés of rock stardom, battling addiction and going from filling stadiums to grasping at straws for a hit. Meanwhile, over in early-’80s New York — Hollis, Queens, to be exact: far from the white college bars of Boston but still “an urban oasis compared to the burned-out brick buildings of the Bronx” — Joseph Simmons (Run) and Darryl McDaniels (DMC) joined forces with Jason Mizell, a.k.a. Jam Master Jay, to garner fame as Run-DMC. Hip-hop was still, as the music mogul Lyor Cohen says, “a powerful little secret running through America,” but it was bubbling to the surface — Blondie’s 1981 hit “Rapture” name-checked the hip-hop pioneer Fab 5 Freddy and featured him in its video; a popular trio of white kids called the Beastie Boys endearingly wedded hip-hop mettle with adolescent impishness; and Run-DMC released the first rap album to go gold — before falling prey to internal battles incited by the myriad hustles of an underground industry. Into this mix — “a pair of pale-faced rockers itching for a fix, a trio of black kids still trying to figure out why they were there” — enters the producer Rick Rubin: hip-hop’s unlikely poster child. The Long Island-raised Rubin was a proud suburbanite blithe about street cred; “his drug of choice,” Edgers writes, “was the General Tso’s chicken that flowed into his dorm room” at N.Y.U. Thinking of hip-hop as black punk rock, Rubin partnered with Russell Simmons (Run’s brother) to form the iconic label Def Jam. The mission was to capture the genre’s live-show energy on record, and also to transform a hit rock song released by Aerosmith in 1975 into a strange-bedfellows crossover duet. Edgers gives us the hyper-amusing blow-by-blow of just how this duet came alive, from the back-and-forth of lyrical expletives in the studio — Run called Tyler’s lyrics “hillbilly gibberish” — to the recording of a music video that is both harbinger and metaphor for the song’s legacy: Here were the two groups literally breaking down the wall between them so they could rock out — rap out? — together. And the rest is hip-hop history. Or is it? After “Walk This Way,” Aerosmith’s ninth studio album sold five million copies and returned them to stadium-show status. Rubin was crowned “King of Rap” on the cover of The Village Voice. Run-DMC, however, found themselves embroiled in more in-house battles and lawsuits, and though their legacy as hip-hop godfathers is well enshrined, their 1988 “Tougher Than Leather” album was not the commercial smash that Aerosmith’s release was. There is an elephant in the room here, one that Edgers signals toward but ought to face squarely. What does it say about American culture that for an African-American art form to receive its due it had to not just seek white validation but cloak itself in the trappings of whiteness? How is it that the biggest immediate winners in the story were not the black rappers but the white rockers and the white producer? These are rhetorical questions; anyone mildly familiar with American cultural history knows the dynamics at play here. When Edgers casually compares “Walk This Way” to the “historic” moment when “Elvis thrust his pelvis on ‘The Milton Berle Show’ 30 years earlier,” there’s that elephant again: Is anyone more representative of the long legacy of white appropriation of black art forms than Elvis? In rock ’n’ roll it was a shameless, easy process: white artists covering songs by black artists, then earning the money and credit. But wait, you say. In hip-hop it has not been so shameless and easy. Scores of black originators in the genre then and now continue to earn their due. And anyway, hip-hop is not simply “black” but creole: Latinos were vital to its inception; broadly speaking, hip-hop culture was, as Fab 5 Freddy says to Edgers, akin to American pop culture itself: “a collaborative effort between blacks, Jews and Italians, particularly in New York.” This is true. But it is also why hip-hop narratives, like the “Walk This Way” saga, continue to hold so much appeal, almost as America’s national fable: They reinforce the myth of the American dream. The myth that an empire of wealth can grow from dorm rooms (but never mind the price tag on those dorm rooms and thus the color and class of most people inhabiting them). The myth that America is a melting pot of hybrid peoples coming together to produce beautiful cultures (but never mind that such a process has been governed by racist, capitalist-driven power dynamics that continue to benefit some more than others). There is something anachronistic, especially in a Black Lives Matter era, about recounting hip-hop history without more than a nod to these realities. Edgers tells the story with incredulity — behold how one song changed American music! — but in the context of American history the ending is actually an inevitability: If it hadn’t been hip-hop it would have been something else, because as Ralph Ellison pointed out in his famed Time magazine essay “What America Would Be Like Without Blacks,” American culture is African-American culture and vice versa. How this process has played out and for whose benefit, how its reality has been negated by whole swaths of America — including a current president who omits hip-hop from his inauguration because it’s not right for the “typically and traditionally American event” — these are the issues demanding the attention of hip-hop historians of the here and now.

AMEN DUNES at Warsaw (Feb. 1, 9 p.m.). To rehash bluesy rock in a way that’s genuinely compelling is a serious challenge, but Damon McMahon, frontman of Amen Dunes, has found his own way down that oft-trodden path. Especially on the band’s latest album, “Freedom,” there’s a refreshing restraint to their work, stripping away most of rock’s maximalism in favor of gentle, reverb-laden riffs that spotlight McMahon’s distinctive, ever-so-slightly wavering voice. The result is pleasant, mild chaos with enough familiar sounds to be an easy listen. The electronic artist Arthur opens. 212-777-6800, mercuryeastpresents.com/warsawconcerts TONI BRAXTON at Kings Theater (Feb. 7, 8 p.m.). This R&B titan takes over the cavernous theater in Flatbush, Brooklyn, for a show that has long been sold out (though tickets are available via resellers). Braxton specializes in dramatic, emotional epics, songs that are practically operatic in scope; her most enduring hit is “Un-Break My Heart,” a sweeping power ballad. Most remarkable, though, is that Braxton’s style has remained constant in spite of shifting R&B trends. Her 2018 album “Sex & Cigarettes,” a collection of cathartic, unrelenting songs about infidelity, earned three Grammy nominations. The trio SWV, responsible for chart toppers such as “Weak” and “Right Here,” will also perform. 718-856-5464, kingstheatre.com ESTELLE at Baby’s All Right (Feb. 6, 8 p.m.). This British singer’s 2008 major-label debut is best known for its smash hit “American Boy,” which features Kanye West as her raffish suitor. The release had another minor hit, though: “Come Over,” a pop-reggae song featuring Sean Paul. Estelle, whose father is from Grenada, revisited reggae and dancehall on her most recent record, 2018’s “Lover’s Rock” — a tribute to the buoyant, romantic British reggae subgenre that goes by the same name. The album, released on the legendary reggae label VP Records, features heavy hitters including Chronixx, Tarrus Riley and Konshens. 718-599-5800, babysallright.com SHAMIR at Brooklyn Bazaar (Feb. 2, 8 p.m.). Pinning a genre to this singer-songwriter from Las Vegas is challenging. His 2015 debut, “Ratchet,” is eclectic synth-pop with 1980s flair; his latest, last year’s “Resolution,” is stripped-down indie rock that includes songs like “I Can’t Breathe,” which focuses on police killings, and “The Things You Loved,” which has a folksy twang. There are constants, though: Shamir’s instantly identifiable voice — high and sweet with an acidic edge — and his songwriting. Even as his sound becomes more rough-hewed, his songs remain taut and compelling.bkbazaar.com TIBET HOUSE US BENEFIT CONCERT at Carnegie Hall (Feb. 7, 7:30 p.m.). For the 32nd year in a row, Tibet House US, an organization devoted to preserving Tibetan culture and protecting its refugees, will host an all-star musical benefit. This year’s edition, curated by Philip Glass, a longtime participant, includes Laurie Anderson, Jon Batiste, Debbie Harry, Jason Isbell, Angelique Kidjo, Nathaniel Rateliff, New Order’s Bernard Sumner and the Tibetan artist Tenzin Choegyal. Stephen Colbert will be on hand for comic relief. And surprise one-off collaborations are likely; last year, Patti Smith and Angel Olsen covered the Velvet Underground’s “I Found a Reason.” 212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org TRIBALISTAS at the Hammerstein Ballroom (Feb. 5, 8 p.m.). The singers Arnaldo Antunes, Marisa Monte and Carlinhos Brown were already stars in Brazil before joining forces to record their 2002 album, “Tribalistas.” A collection of lilting songs in the tradition of what’s known as “musica popular brasileira” — a post-bossa-nova movement dedicated to integrating international sounds into Brazilian music — the album boosted the supergroup to international success, selling over three million copies globally. It took 15 years for the trio to release a follow-up, also simply called “Tribalistas”; now, they’re performing in New York for the first time as a group.800-745-3000, mc34.com [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] YOLA at Rockwood Music Hall, Stage 2 (Feb. 6, 7 p.m.). Country-soul seems overdue for some mainstream attention, thanks to the parallel success of old-school singers like Leon Bridges and Charles Bradley, and outlaw-era-inspired country stars like Chris Stapleton and Miranda Lambert. Yola, whose Southern soul sound belies her upbringing in southwest England, is as good a candidate as any to spark such a renaissance. Her rich alto fits in seamlessly alongside the slide guitars, jangling piano and lush arrangements on her upcoming debut, “Walk Through Fire,” produced by the Black Keys’ Dan Auerbach.212-477-4155, rockwoodmusichall.comNATALIE WEINER J. D. ALLEN QUARTET at Smoke (Feb. 1-2, 7, 9 and 10:30 p.m.). One of today’s premier tenor saxophonists, Allen spent the last decade working with a steady trio, developing a sturdy but flexible sound based around minor melodies and bristling postbop rhythms. But he recently assembled a new trio featuring a couple of younger musicians, the bassist Ian Kenselaar and the drummer Nic Cacioppo. The early returns are good: An appearance at Winter Jazzfest, where the new trio was joined by the tenor saxophone luminary David Murray, showed how ably the young players have adapted to Allen’s personal style. This weekend the group performs with another of Allen’s frequent collaborators: the crisply expressive guitarist Liberty Ellman.212-864-6662, smokejazz.com JIMMY COBB at Jazz Standard (Jan. 31-Feb. 3, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). Cobb, a drummer and National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master, will probably be remembered as the drummer whose crackling ride cymbal adorned Miles Davis’s 1959 classic, “Kind of Blue.” But his career is much bigger than that one date: He accompanied Sarah Vaughan and John Coltrane and Freddie Hubbard, playing on countless record dates and remaining in the top tier of New York jazz for over 60 years. Cobb turned 90 in January, and he celebrates this weekend in a quartet featuring Peter Bernstein on guitar, Tadataka Unno on piano and John Webber on bass.212-576-2232, jazzstandard.com PEDRO GIRAUDO TANGO QUARTET AND SOFIA TOSELLO at Joe’s Pub (Feb. 1, 9:30 p.m.). Giraudo is an Argentine bassist and composer who reinforces his love for tango with a mastery of Western classical and jazz vocabulary. He sometimes performs with a full orchestra, but he’s just as dazzling with his quartet — the group that appears on his 2018 album, “Vigor Tanguero,” which won a Latin Grammy for best tango album. Also on the bill is Sofia Tosello, a vocalist whose last album, “Lluvia Fue” (“Chamber Tango”), presents its own distinctive take on the tango tradition, mixing old songs and new.212-967-7555, publictheater.org MARÍA GRAND QUARTET AND JOEL ROSS GOOD VIBES at Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola (Feb. 5, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). Grand, a tenor saxophonist, and Ross, a vibraphonist, are two of the most-buzzed-about young players on the New York jazz scene — each with their own sleek, sanguine take on mainstream jazz. They’re also frequent collaborators, and at Dizzy’s on Tuesday they will split the bill, with Grand’s quartet (the vocalist Fay Victor, the bassist Kanoa Mendenhall and the drummer Savannah Harris) starting things off, and Ross’s group (Mendenhall on bass, Immanuel Wilkins on alto saxophone, Jeremy Corren on piano and Jeremy Dutton on drums) playing the second set. Tickets for each performance are sold separately.212-258-9595, jazz.org/dizzys HYPNOTIC BRASS ENSEMBLE at the Blue Note (Jan. 31-Feb. 3, 8 and 10:30 p.m.). The brass-band tradition is naturally associated with New Orleans, but Hypnotic proudly espouses its Chicago roots. With less marching-band thunder and more hip-hop swagger than, say, New Orleans’s Dirty Dozen Brass Band, this eight-piece ensemble mixes the influence of hip-hop, soul and gospel into a coolly grooving sound. And Chicago’s deep legacy as a cradle of experimental, Afrocentric jazz is never far away: All but one of Hypnotic’s members is a son of Kelan Philip Cohran, a patriarch of Chicago’s creative black music scene, who died in 2017.212-475-8592, bluenote.net EIVIND OPSVIK OVERSEAS AND SNARK HORSE at Nublu 151 (Feb. 6, 9 p.m.). A Norwegian-born bassist with a big, dark tone and precision chops, Opsvik writes music with an irreverent intensity, adhering to no single style and showing little interest in the mannered formality of so much progressive jazz. Much of his latest album, the fifth installment of his “Overseas” series, boasts the rugged conviction of rock music and the tangled melodic momentum of a fugue. At Nublu 151, he shares the bill with Snark Horse, an all-star group of improvisers playing short, nervous melodies that they repeat and deconstruct. Snark Horse appears here in quartet form with Matt Mitchell on piano, Ava Mendoza on guitar, Matt Nelson on tenor saxophone and Kate Gentile on drums.nublu.netGIOVANNI RUSSONELLO "

SUSANA BACA at Sony Hall (Feb. 12, 8 p.m.). This 74-year-old Peruvian singer-songwriter started her career as an ethnomusicologist, specifically focusing on Afro-Peruvian culture. But when David Byrne featured her recording “Maria Lando” on his 1995 compilation “Soul of Black Peru,” she was thrust upon the international stage. Since, she has recorded six albums for his Luaka Bop label and won two Latin Grammys. Baca’s repertoire includes both traditional Peruvian songs and her own originals, but the sound is consistent thanks to her ensemble’s elegant acoustic instrumentation and her superlative, powerful voice. 212-997-5123, sonyhall.com ANITA BAKER at Radio City Music Hall (Feb. 13-14, 8 p.m.). At 61, this R&B legend concluded what was billed as her farewell tour in 2018 with a star-studded finale in September that included appearances by Stevie Wonder, Lalah Hathaway and Kelly Rowland. Thankfully for fans, she’s back with this two-night run at Radio City. The “Giving You the Best That I Got” singer’s roster of hits may have helped define the quiet storm era, which started in the 1970s, but at recent live shows, she has sounded as vital and captivating as ever. 212-465-6000, radiocity.com TALIB KWELI at the BRIC House Ballroom (Feb. 14, 8 p.m.). A Brooklyn native, this rapper gives an interesting spin to Valentine’s Day concerts: His is a love letter to his home borough. Brooklyn — specifically Park Slope, where Kweli grew up, and Fort Greene, where this concert will take place — has changed dramatically since he first rose to prominence in the late 1990s as half of Black Star, which he formed with the M.C. Yasiin Bey (then known as Mos Def), a fellow Brooklynite. Kweli’s message, though, has remained the same: He’s still using his technical mastery to push for social and political reform in Brooklyn and beyond. 718-683-5600, bricartsmedia.org [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] LIFE AND DEATH X SÓNAR at the Avant Gardner (Feb. 8, 10 p.m.). The influential electronic music label Life and Death is partnering with the Spanish festival Sónar to curate a night of D.J.s from around the world at this multiroom Brooklyn club. The lineup includes Life and Death’s co-founder, D.J. Tennis (a.k.a. Manfredi Romano), who specializes in techno; the Los Angeles-based producer Daedelus, who makes experimental electronic music; the London-based house D.J. Call Super; and the Israeli D.J. Mor Elian, whose recent work skews toward electro and ambient music. 347-987-3146, avant-gardner.com SARAH SHOOK & THE DISARMERS at the Knitting Factory (Feb. 14, 8 p.m.). With a rare combination of deft, classic country sounds and plain-spoken storytelling, Shook bucks both Nashville’s mainstream and the overly self-aware Americana scene. The twist comes from Shook’s unconventionally compelling voice, which is low, steady and a little nasal, recalling Appalachian yodeling but with a grungy edge. Plentiful slide guitar and a reliance on barn-dance-ready shuffle rhythms ground the songs in tradition, and the execution is sharp enough that the band’s old-school approach is convincing, a believable transformation of country’s vintage melancholy. 347-529-6696, knittingfactory.com SHARON VAN ETTEN at the Beacon Theater (Feb. 9, 8 p.m.). Van Etten’s new album, “Remind Me Tomorrow,” is receiving rave reviews, thanks in part to the New Jersey-bred singer-songwriter’s fairly dramatic stylistic shift. On her most recent releases, her confessional, poetic songs are bolstered by a slew of different electronic effects and synths instead of basic rock instrumentation. “I found that I was more drawn to the darkness and the driven synths and the syncopated beats,” she told The New York Times last month. The elaborate production, though, does little to obscure her music’s potent vulnerability.212-465-6000, beacontheatre.comNATALIE WEINER CLAUDIA ACUÑA at the Birdland Theater (through Feb. 9, 7 and 9:45 p.m.). Last week Acuña released “Turning Pages,” her first album in a decade and her first to consist of mostly original tunes. It finds the Chilean-born vocalist luxuriating in the breadth of her powers, whether covering Abbey Lincoln or unveiling her own compositions; she’s equal parts taut rhythm, flowing largess (think Cassandra Wilson in the 1990s) and sky-seeking mountain folk. Acuña performs songs from that album here with her band, featuring Juancho Herrera on guitar, Pablo Vergara on keyboard, Carlos Henderson on bass and Yayo Serka on drums.212-581-3080, birdlandjazz.com ITAMAR BOROCHOV at Nublu 151 (Feb. 13, 9 p.m.). An Israeli-born trumpeter, Borochov plays contemporary jazz that’s easy to enjoy. His melodies are direct and often plangent, his harmonies and rhythms sturdy and repetitious. His latest album, “Blue Nights,” draws together influences from the Middle East and North Africa with jazz-academy thinking. He performs here, using his signature quarter-tone trumpet (a custom instrument that allows him to play more fluidly in Middle Eastern modes), with Rob Clearfield on keyboard, Sam Weber on bass and Jay Sawyer on drums. The North African folk band Innov Gnawa, which was featured on one track on “Blue Nights,” will appear as special guests.nublu.net DEE DEE BRIDGEWATER at 92nd Street Y (Feb. 14, 7:30 p.m.). A recently minted National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master, Bridgewater is one of jazz’s most beloved straight-ahead veterans of the 1970s and ’80s, with a style that’s rooted in theater; she carries forth the storytelling legacies of Dinah Washington and Nancy Wilson. Her most recent album, “Memphis,” is a homage to the soul music of the city where she was born, but at this Valentine’s Day concert — joined by her typical backing trio of the pianist Carmen Staaf, the bassist Tabari Lake and the drummer Tyson Jackson — expect a more standard serving of romantic jazz fare.212-415-5500, 92y.org RUDRESH MAHANTHAPPA’S INDO-PAK COALITION at the Miller Theater (Feb. 9, 8 p.m.). Mahanthappa, an alto saxophonist, has been working with his Indo-Pak Coalition for long enough now that the group is starting to subtly outgrow the initial mission statement. They are no longer simply jazz improvisers combining musical traditions from across the Indian subcontinent. The trio — which also includes the guitarist Rez Abbasi and the drummer and tabla player Dan Weiss — has the restless, unboxable rapport of musicians broadly exploring musical sounds and strategies, with Indian classical as its launchpad.212-854-7799, millertheatre.com THUNDERCAT at the Blue Note (Feb. 12-14, 8 and 10:30 p.m.; through Feb. 17). Thundercat, a six-string-electric-bass wunderkind and merry prankster, might be the most hopelessly enjoyable artist currently making music in jazz’s crossover territory. He will do a six-night run in the coming week, welcoming a range of unannounced special guests throughout. Expect wry, hilarious non sequiturs muttered in between songs — like “Them Changes” and “Show You the Way” — that will be full of elastic funk grooves and blistering bass solos. Thundercat, whose birth name is Stephen Bruner, has been improving his vocal chops recently; his singing still has an unpretentious, conversational allure, but now there’s more body and breath behind it.212-475-8592, bluenote.net WING WALKER ORCHESTRA AND BRIAN KROCK’S LIDDLE at Threes Brewing Gowanus (Feb. 12, 8 p.m.). Led by the young multi-reedist Drew Williams, the Wing Walker Orchestra is about to release a remarkable debut album, “Hazel.” The music stays tightly woven, even as Williams switches up the grooves and harmonic palettes constantly; there’s almost always a sharp, biting cadence coming from some part of the band (though not necessarily the rhythm section). The group shares this bill with Liddle, a combo fronted by the alto saxophonist Brian Krock, playing music that draws in equal measure from Charlie Parker, Anthony Braxton and Battles — putting checkered rock rhythms underneath pelting, hard-edge melodies. 718-522-2110, threesbrewing.comGIOVANNI RUSSONELLO "

MARC COHN at City Winery (Jan. 6, 7:30 p.m.). For those who prefer their rock on the softer side and with a healthy dose of blues, singer-songwriter Marc Cowhn — best known for his hit “Walking In Memphis” — is headlining a near-ideal evening of music. Also performing are John Oates and his Good Road Band, who recently released “Arkansas,” a rootsy album designed in part as a tribute to legendary bluesman Mississippi John Hurt, and then Cohn will get vocal support from legendary harmonists the Blind Boys of Alabama. 212-608-0555, citywinery.com MDOU MOCTAR at Baby’s All Right (Jan. 4, 8 p.m.). The robust rock tradition among the Tuareg people — a Berber group with origins around the southern Sahara — has long been represented internationally by artists like Bombino and Tinariwen. Moctar, a singer-songwriter, offers a subtler, more intimate variation on their desert blues with his most recent album “Sousoume Tamachek.” Translated from the Tuareg dialect in which he sings, the title of the soothing, stripped-down release fittingly translates to something like “calm down.” He’s responsible for every note on the album, layering electric and acoustic guitar, percussion, and singing with mesmerizing results. 718-599-5800, babysallright.com NEW POWER GENERATION at Sony Hall (Jan. 4, 7:30 p.m.). Prince’s backing band for over 20 years, the New Power Generation reunited shortly after his death in 2016. While the Revolution, who are also currently touring, were the primary support for Prince’s 1980s output, the New Power Generation — whose long tenure belied a much less consistent personnel — played behind his 1990s and 2000s compositions and performances. Their setlists span the singer’s career, though, for fans new and old who want to hear Prince’s music in as close to its original form as is still possible live.212-997-5123, sonyhall.com NONAME at Brooklyn Steel (Jan. 5-6, 8 p.m.). Upon first listen, the Chicago rapper’s music sounds laid-back and understated. “I make lullaby rap music,” she explained recently on Twitter, a description as concise and apt as most of her rapid-fire yet still conversational verses. But even though her volume rarely goes above piano, Noname has attitude and depth to spare as she raps over asymmetrical grooves that have a live, unprocessed sound. On her recent full-length debut “Room 25,” there are lines salacious enough to garner their own headlines alongside philosophical manifestos, as on “No Name”: “’Cause when we walk into heaven, nobody’s name’s gonna exist/Just boundless movement for joy, nakedness radiance.” Both shows are sold out, but tickets are available via the secondary market.888-929-7849, bowerypresents.com/brooklyn-steel OZOMATLI at Sony Hall (Jan. 5, 7:30 p.m.). The Los Angeles band’s goal has long been to capture that they see as a melange of genres: cumbia, salsa, rock, hip-hop, reggae and funk. This past year was the 20th anniversary of their self-titled debut album, which earned them a spot opening for Santana on the 1999 “Supernatural” tour. Since, they’ve been among the most reliable purveyors of Latin rock, often foregrounding issues around immigration, social justice and worker’s rights (the band’s members first met while trying to unionize a community center). 212-997-5123, sonyhall.com CL SMOOTH at S.O.B.’s (Jan. 10, 8 p.m.). When the rapper released his best-known single “They Reminisce Over You (T.R.O.Y.)” alongside producer Pete Rock, he was just 23. Over two decades later, the song’s carefully crafted bars and jazz-sampling beat remain etched in hip-hop history, giving its titular reminiscence new meaning. In a recent interview, CL Smooth reflected on how the music has evolved since the duo’s heyday during what’s often called hip-hop’s golden age. “I wouldn’t change anything.”212-243-4940, sobs.com NATALIE WEINER GLOBALFEST at the Copacabana (Jan. 6, 7 p.m.). As always, the 16th annual Globalfest features a broad range of acts from across the world. Highlights this year include the Calcutta-based Pandit Debashish Bhattacharya, who plays Indian ragas on the slide guitar, in a style descended of the sitar; the Cuban mambo revivalists of Orquesta Akokán; and Gato Preto, an electronic duo exploring music from across the African diaspora. All told, the evening boasts performances from a dozen bands across three stages at the Copacabana, one of Manhattan’s most storied nightclubs. globalfest.org CRAIG HARRIS at Nublu 151 (Jan. 6, 7 p.m.). Harris, a trombonist, is celebrating the release of “Brown Butterfly,” an ambitious album paying homage to the legacy of Muhammad Ali. The suite laces gnarled horn arrangements and spoken tributes to Ali over protean rhythms, drawing on influences as varied as Count Basie’s big band and the drum-and-bass of 1990s London; the music emulates the rugged grace and mercurial power of Ali in the ring. Harris’s band includes Kahlil Kwame Bell on percussion, Calvin Jones on bass, Adam Klipple on piano, Tony Lewis on drums and Jay Rodriguez on saxophone. nublu.net CHRISTIAN SANDS at Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola (Jan. 5-6, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). A 29-year-old pianist and bandleader of increasing renown, Sands is aligned with jazz’s straight-ahead mainstream, but he’s got an unbounded inquisitive instinct. He sounds like he listens to Oscar Peterson, Jason Moran and Eddie Palmieri in about equal doses. He performs this Saturday with a quartet including the guitarist Caio Afiune, the bassist Yasushi Nakamura and the drummer David Rosenthal; that group will likely draw heavily from Sands’s most recent album, “Facing Dragons.” On Sunday, he returns with a trio featuring the bassist Luques Curtis and the drummer Terreon Gully. The latter show is a tribute to Erroll Garner; Sands serves as the creative ambassador for the Erroll Garner Jazz Project, a group dedicated to furthering the canonical pianist’s legacy. 212-258-9595, jazz.org/dizzys JEN SHYU AND JADE TONGUE at the Jazz Gallery (Jan. 9, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). A vocalist, poet and movement artist, Shyu is equally devoted to open-ended abstraction and absorptive storytelling. Here she presents “In Healing/Zero Grasses,” a new project with her longstanding group, Jade Tongue, that features a characteristically radical admixture of song, spoken poetry and outré improvisation, all aimed at healing humanity’s relationship with the natural environment. Jade Tongue includes Ambrose Akinmusire on trumpet, Mat Maneri on viola, Thomas Morgan on bass and Dan Weiss on drums. 646-494-3625, jazzgallery.nyc BEN WENDEL HIGH HEART AND KENDRICK SCOTT ORACLE at ShapeShifter Lab (Jan. 6, 7 p.m.). Wendel and Scott are two of the most admired composer-bandleaders among today’s young music students and devotees of jazz’s modern mainstream. Here Wendel, a saxophonist, will present the debut of High Heart, a new acoustic-electric ensemble with the vocalist Michael Mayo, the keyboardists Shai Maestro and Gerald Clayton, the bassist Joe Sanders and the drummer Nate Wood. Scott, a drummer, will perform with Oracle, a vessel for his shimmering, gently propulsive compositions; in its current iteration, the group includes Sanders on bass, John Ellis on saxophone, Taylor Eigsti on piano and Mike Moreno on guitar. shapeshifterlab.com WINTER JAZZFEST (Jan. 4-12). Now in its 15th year, the Winter Jazzfest has never had a more bountiful lineup of contemporary jazz talent. Its beloved weekend marathon — featuring simultaneous shows at venues across Lower Manhattan — will now stretch across two weekends: a “Half Marathon” will set the pace this Saturday, with a fuller, two-night marathon taking place a week later, on Jan. 11-12. In the week between, one-off concerts will be held nearly every night at a variety of venues. Highlights include Sunday’s New York debut of the pianist Arturo O’Farrill’s “Fandango at the Wall,” a suite he first performed at the United States-Mexican border this past spring, with a multinational federation of musicians; and a concert on Thursday with the saxophone luminaries Pharoah Sanders and Gary Bartz performing together. Both of those shows, and many others at the festival, will take place at Le Poisson Rouge. winterjazzfest.comGIOVANNI RUSSONELLO "
5c7fe0cf49f0eacbf105ba0f,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/06/arts/music/karen-o-danger-mouse-lux-prima.html,"Every great partnership has to begin somewhere. For Karen O and Danger Mouse, it was a drunk dial in 2008. At least, that’s how half of this duo featuring the queen of the aughts rock revival and the versatile Grammy-winning producer remembers it. Karen O drew a blank when Danger Mouse (born Brian Burton) brought it up late last month at Electric Lady Studios in Greenwich Village, where they worked on their new album, “Lux Prima.” “I got this phone call, and you were like, it’s Karen O. I was like, what?” Burton said. His flummoxed collaborator at the other end of the couch slowly recalled what had happened: After years of saying they wanted to work together but only meeting briefly, Karen O had seized the moment. “I get excited about things after a couple of drinks — then I’m like, yeah, I’m going to call him now!” she said. “That’s so me, too,” she added and let out the Karen O cackle, a high, sharp peal of laughter. Sipping tea in an upstairs studio at the storied recording complex, both musicians were in Clark Kent mode, Zen and studious. (To be fair, this is Burton’s forever mode.) Since 2001, Karen O — short for her last name, Orzolek — has been best known as the frontwoman for the trio Yeah Yeah Yeahs, a stage-devouring, beer-spraying punk who can swing a microphone around her head while nailing every note with an ecstatic grin on her face. Burton was a cross-genre producer searching for his niche when “The Grey Album” — his unauthorized mash-up of Jay-Z’s “The Black Album” and the Beatles record known as the White Album — became a cause célèbre (and almost ended his career before it started) in 2004. He went on to form Gnarls Barkley with CeeLo Green; work with Gorillaz, Beck, the Black Keys and U2; and collaborate with James Mercer of the Shins in a group called Broken Bells. [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] They’ve both recently entered their 40s: not old enough to be old, but old enough to question what’s coming next. It’s something that was on their minds as they began their journey into “Lux Prima,” an album of sprawling, soulful, cinematic psych rock filled with astral bass lines, gauzy strings and Karen O-isms like “You’re not coming for me/I’m coming for you.” “I’m on a vision quest of sorts: What does it mean to be a woman artist in her 40s? And how can I lay it down so that’s like, something [expletive] awesome,” Karen O said a few days later at a tony Lower East Side hotel that sprouted up two blocks from the tiny Mercury Lounge, where Yeah Yeah Yeahs played their first show, opening for the White Stripes. “It’s not a paved road, it’s not a well-beaten path,” she added. It’s “find your way through that wilderness and write us a postcard.”  THOUGH THEY MET AROUND 2005, had that fateful phone call in 2008 and ran into each other again in 2012, the Karen O and Danger Mouse project didn’t get moving until 2016, a year after Karen O gave birth to her son, Django. Yeah Yeah Yeahs had last put out an album in 2013 — “Mosquito,” which concluded their contract with Interscope — and the singer followed up with an indie release called “Crush Songs,” a quiet series of meditations on romance she’d written alone in her New York apartment around 2007. She was relishing her newfound freedom. “On the one hand,” she said, “Yeah Yeah Yeahs have had the great fortune of the label not meddling in our process. But there’s expectations for singles and the trajectory that you have to hit.” She added, “Until I was out of that deal, I didn’t realize the subtle psychic weight that I’d been carrying for like a decade.” Nick Zinner, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs guitarist who did a little playing on “Lux Prima,” said the pressures of the band were “something that you can spend a lot of energy trying to not think about,” and he knew this kind of independence was something Karen O “was yearning for.” Karen O compared working with Burton to when she wrote her “psycho opera,” a decidedly noncommercial art project called “Stop the Virgens,” in 2005 (it was staged in Brooklyn and Sydney, Australia, in 2011 and 2012): There were no expectations from the outside and no limits. Before they got started, Burton played her Michael Kiwanuka’s “Cold Little Heart,” the beautiful, shape-shifting 10-minute song that kicks off the London artist’s 2016 album, “Love & Hate,” which he produced, and it struck a nerve. “That’s what made me want to make music when I first heard Pink Floyd in college,” said Burton, who easily switches between his roles as a producer and a musician. “I had always thought music was entertainment, and I didn’t want to be an entertainer, I wanted to be an artist.” He referenced his days in Athens, Ga., when he became immersed in the ’90s psych-rock scene anchored by the Elephant 6 Recording Company. “I was like, people make 15-minute songs? You’re taking yourself out of competition or pop or any of that stuff, you’re just making something. That’s what I want to do.” Karen O chimed in: “That’s what I want to do. After all these years.” So the first thing they did was make a 12-minute song, the lush, groovy “Lux Prima” (it later got a haircut to nine minutes), following Burton’s process: Come in with nothing and make something. They worked five-hour, two-week shifts in Burton’s Los Angeles studio so Karen O could stick to Django’s schedule. (While she defines downtown cool for a generation of New Yorkers, Karen O now lives in L.A., where she doesn’t have to schlep a stroller up subway steps. And Burton, a longtime L.A. resident, has relocated to New York.) Because the “Lux Prima” material was the first original music Karen O had written since giving birth, “I was really wondering what would be streaming out of me after that experience,” she said. “I felt more deeply connected to the cycles of life and like, consciousness. And I had a deep sense of love that was different.” Zinner said he saw his longtime collaborator wrestling with a new set of concerns. “Whatever Karen does, she’s working through something that’s happening with her,” he said, adding there was a “different element” in the mix this time. “Definitely being a mom. And being a woman in the age of Trump.” Burton was struck by Karen O’s process — she writes lyrics in the studio, which they both called torturous. But Karen O likes it because it helps her find an arc for the full album. And the primacy of the album was critical. “There were only a couple of times we were like, ‘Should there be a single in this?’” Karen O said. “There’s plenty of hooks and melodies in the record, but as far as like a single in 2019, what does that sound like, especially in alternative music?” Burton quickly added, “Don’t even try.” The nine tracks on “Lux Prima” unspool grandly, from the ominous lullaby “Ministry” to the stomping girl-group squall of “Woman” to the compact psych-funk groove of “Leopard’s Tongue.” The duo will present the album as a “multisensory art installation” in April at the Marciano Art Foundation in Los Angeles. The event, overseen by the creative director Barnaby Clay (Karen O’s husband), will use lighting, projections and other stimuli to creative an immersive experience — the antidote to the kind of glance-listening that dominates pop’s current era of distraction. Holding people’s attention isn’t easy in 2019. Danger Mouse later shared the advice he gives the young artists on his label, 30th Century Records: “Just have faith that if you’re doing the stuff you want to do, it will be heard at some point.” Dan Auerbach, the Black Keys singer and guitarist, admires Burton’s ability to pull the best from his collaborators. Burton, who has worked on four albums with the band, was the first outside producer the duo let into their world. “I think we just liked how drum-heavy his stuff was, kind of dusty and funky and always so rhythmic,” Auerbach added. “He just has a sixth sense with melody.” Despite having worked with some of the most successful artists in music, including Adele and Red Hot Chili Peppers, Burton’s guiding ethos remains heart over trends. “Usually when I work with somebody I tell them, ‘This is probably going to be your least-selling record, and if we make a couple of accidents that work out, it could be your best-selling record,’” he said. “‘But it’s probably not going to be anywhere in between.’” James Mercer, the Shins leader who teamed with Burton in Broken Bells, said his band was listening to “The Grey Album” backstage in Copenhagen the night Burton showed up unannounced to meet them. “That’s the type of person he is, he’s that brave and gregarious,” Mercer said. “He’s very good at being open to new ideas, so he definitely has stuff he learned from working with U2 and the Chili Peppers.” Mercer wasn’t surprised when Burton joined forces with Karen O, saying they’d listened to Yeah Yeah Yeahs together in the past: “He’s a fan of female singers, and she’s kind of the best.” Burton’s admiration for Karen O is obvious. “She has a voice I believe,” he said. “My whole thing was making sure that one of the coolest chicks in the world likes what we’re doing.”  KAREN O HAS BEEN KNOWN as a rock ’n’ roll badass for so many years that many of the nuances of her personality and art have been blasted away. For starters, she has a deep appreciation for soul music, particularly from the 1960s. As a kid, she would listen to her father’s collection of anthologies on repeat, “And I think they really imprinted songwriting into my brain,” she said. In early August, Karen O randomly pulled out a compilation featuring Aretha Franklin that she’d leaned on during her 20s, and wrote on Instagram that the Queen of Soul “broke the mold.” Ten days later, Franklin was dead. “That was a bit weird,” Karen O said at the hotel, her tight bob of hair hugging her face. Thoughts about the irreplaceable artists of her youth and the idea of legacy started to gnaw at her as she approached 40 last year. What happens when “even the biggest people in the arts just eventually fade away?” she wondered, and what would she herself leave behind? “She is a rock musician who’s idling in a genre that is currently completely undervalued,” the singer Shirley Manson of Garbage, a friend of Karen O’s, said in a phone interview. “People laugh at us, the rockers. Karen and I have spoken about this. We’re like, ‘We’re the [expletive] rockers, and we love it, because there’s no one else in our pool. We’re still swimming around like sharks.’” Manson turned her attention to the music industry, which she called “a really staunch patriarchal system” that devalues women as they get older. “You have to walk through the valley of death yourself and figure out who you will be. Karen’s going to have to find out for herself what Karen O will be, and she’ll figure it out fine.” Karen O tends to look to the left when she’s talking, and her gaze remained fixed as she described that midlife crisis. “I felt those cliché things,” she said. “Like, wow, maybe I’m not going to get around to doing all those things I wanted to do. I’ve just been wildly ambitious and idealistic and actually quite optimistic about making stuff.” Suddenly she was struck by how hard it felt to create, and how fleeting and impermanent everything can seem. She said she turned to a friend who was a punk rocker in the late ’70s and early ’80s for advice, “And she said to me: ‘Yeah, ashes to ashes, man, isn’t it great? Once you realize that, you’re free.’ And I was like, wow. I can’t process that quite yet, but once I do, that’s going to be [expletive] good times.” "

BROTHERS OSBORNE at Terminal 5 (Jan. 23, 8 p.m.). For those who appreciate their country music with a healthy dose of roadhouse-ready rock, this Maryland-based duo have released a series of up-tempo, guitar-heavy singles that have earned them both critical acclaim (including five Grammy nods) and a considerable following. Their rough-around-the-edges sound — relative to the slick Nashville aesthetic that’s currently in vogue — has endeared them to those country fans alienated by the genre’s radio-driven conformity. The show is sold out, but tickets are available through the resale market. 212-582-6600, terminal5nyc.com CAM’RON at S.O.B.’s (Jan. 19, 8 p.m.). This Harlem-based M.C. will bring his collection of irresistible, party-starting tracks to this intimate club in SoHo. As a member of the Diplomats, best known for their earthshaking self-titled anthem, Cam’ron helped shape the sound of uptown rap in the late 1990s. Soon after, his solo efforts translated into two massive crossover hits: the indelible “Oh Boy” and “Hey Ma.” Since then, he has remained beloved among rap aficionados for his bombastic, club-ready tracks, but he has enough memorable songs and collaborations to appeal to those newer to the genre. 212-243-4940, sobs.com ANTHONY HAMILTON at Kings Theater (Jan. 19, 8 p.m.). This R&B singer retains the aura of a different time — his rich, smooth voice and defiantly traditional instrumentation have long set him apart from many peers in the genre. His breakthrough in the early 2000s, for example, was fueled by an appearance on the bluesy, rustic Nappy Roots hit “Po’ Folks.” He has continued to draw on everything from classic gospel, with his 2016 single “Amen,” to barbershop harmonies, releasing a series of viral covers of rap hits with his quartet, the Hamiltones. 718-856-5464, kingstheatre.com KING PRINCESS at Warsaw (Jan. 23, 7 p.m.) and Irving Plaza (Jan. 24, 7 p.m.). “I hate it when dudes try to chase me,” sings Mikaela Straus at the opening of her hit single “1950,” which she released under her stage name, King Princess — and somehow that’s not even the song’s most memorable line. Catchy, romantic pop confections are quickly becoming the 20-year-old singer-songwriter’s specialty, despite the fact that she has yet to put out a full-length album. What she has created so far, though, stretches the boundaries of pop norms with titles like “Pussy Is God” and stories about women falling in and out of love with one another. Both shows are sold out, but tickets are available through resellers. 212-777-6800, mercuryeastpresents.com LARAAJI at the Park Church Co-op (Jan. 24, 7 p.m.). Though this septuagenarian’s big break came with the release of his Brian Eno-produced album “Ambient 3: Day of Radiance” in 1980, in recent years he’s garnered a number of new fans thanks in part to a series of reissues from the trendy electronic label Leaving Records. Laraaji makes serene New Age music on an array of instruments including the zither, the hammered dulcimer and the piano. This meditative set will, fittingly, take place in a Brooklyn church. Rachika S, a local ambient electronic composer, opens. eventbrite.com  THIS IS HIP HOP at the Apollo Theater (Jan. 18, 8 p.m.). Hip-hop, with its generally spare instrumentation, has long been a good fit for festival-style concerts that squeeze in a number of acts. The legendary lyricist Rakim and a slew of local rap groups active from the 1980s to the early 2000s — the Lox, E.P.M.D., Black Moon and Brand Nubian — will be sharing the turntables and microphones at this old-school affair. For New York rap fans, it’s a head-nodding trip down memory lane; for those new to the genre, it’s a vital history lesson. 212-531-5305, apollotheater.orgNATALIE WEINER AARON BURNETT AND THE BIG MACHINE at the Cell (Jan. 19, 9 p.m.). Boisterous and urgent, the tenor saxophonist Burnett sounds like he could be living on the jazz avant-garde of the 1970s, or surviving a cyborg apocalypse three decades in the future. His new album with the Big Machine is “Anomaly,” full of original compositions with a weird, seductive darkness — from ballads to scorching, unsettled postbop. Burnett celebrates the disc’s release with an iteration of the Big Machine that includes Joel Ross on vibraphone, Carlos Homs on piano, Nick Jozwiak on bass and Dan Nadeau on drums. 646-861-2253, thecelltheatre.org GEORGE COLEMAN QUINTET at Jazz Standard (though Jan. 20, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). Particularly well known for his stint in Miles Davis’s band during the 1960s, this tenor saxophonist uses a lissome, slippery tone to craft melodies of scattered beauty. Now 83, Coleman appears this weekend in a band of straight-ahead jazz stalwarts: Harold Mabern on piano, Yotam Silberstein on guitar, Gerald Cannon on bass and George Coleman Jr. on drums. 212-576-2232, jazzstandard.com KEYON HARROLD at the Blue Note (Jan. 21-23, 8 and 10:30 p.m.). Harrold is technically gifted enough to have recorded the Miles Davis trumpet parts heard on the soundtrack to the 2016 film “Miles Ahead.” He’s also a ruggedly modern thinker, whose own most recent album draws inspiration from radio hip-hop, classic quiet storm, cinematic scores and contemporary jazz. He has long performed in the backing bands for figures like Maxwell, Jay-Z and Rihanna, but these days he is focusing more squarely on his own bandleading career. A native of Ferguson, Mo., Harrold here will perform a program titled “Jazz for Reflection, Protest, Justice and Unity.” 212-475-8592, bluenote.net  INGRID JENSEN QUINTET at the Birdland Theater (Jan. 23-26, 7 and 9:45 p.m.). A trumpeter who’s as versatile as she is vigorous, Jensen released a standout album last year with the tenor saxophonist Steve Treseler. Titled “Invisible Sounds,” it pays tribute to Kenny Wheeler, an influential trumpeter and composer who died in 2014. Jensen and Treseler reinterpret nine of Wheeler’s compositions, which tend to be lyrical and songlike, whether moving at a quick clip or drifting as slowly as cloud cover. Though Jensen is the nominal bandleader for the gigs on Wednesday and Jan. 24, Treseler will also be there; they’ll be joined by Christine Tobin on vocals, Gary Versace on piano, Martin Wind on bass and Jon Wikan on drums. On Jan. 25 and 26, Jensen will revisit the material from her 2003 disc, “Project O,” with the pianist Gary Versace, the bassist Richie Goods and the drummer Jon Wikan. (The tenor saxophonist Joel Frahm will sit in on Jan. 25 only.)212-581-3080, birdlandjazz.com KASSA OVERALL WITH JASON MORAN at the Jazz Gallery (Jan. 18, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). In December, Overall — a drummer, producer and sometime rapper — launched a monthly residency at the Gallery called “Time Capsule.” He is welcoming a different high-profile pianist each month and will record every performance. The resulting tapes will form a capstone product, a hybrid recording that blends chopped-up elements from different performances. (There’s a visual element, too: Overall is collaborating with the artist Nate Lewis, who will create a work to accompany the record.) For this month’s show, Overall welcomes the eminent pianist Jason Moran. 646-494-3625, jazzgallery.nyc MATANA ROBERTS, HALEY FOHR AND SUZANNE LANGILLE at Issue Project Room (Jan. 19, 7 p.m.). In the first show of Issue’s 2019 season, Roberts, an alto saxophonist and multimedia artist, will perform a new work from her continuing series “I Call America,” using video, text and improvised music to address the intersection of societal concerns and personal frustrations. In a separate set, Haley Fohr — best known for her experimental folk outfit Circuit des Yeux — will perform a solo vocal work titled “Wordless Music.” And Suzanne Langille, another singer, will lead a quartet in an exploration of the overlap between vocal and instrumental expression. 718-330-0313, issueprojectroom.orgGIOVANNI RUSSONELLO For an overview of January and February’s cultural events, click here.

ANI CORDERO at the David Rubenstein Atrium at Lincoln Center (Jan. 31, 7:30 p.m.). The New York-based singer and instrumentalist uses music to tap into her Puerto Rican heritage, performing traditional music from the island, as well as from around Latin America (she’s worked with the Brazilian ensemble Os Mutantes, among others). Specifically, on her debut solo release in 2014, “Recordar,” Cordero paid tribute to Latin American music’s history of protest songs, offering her rendition of compositions by artists like Mexico’s Chavela Vargas and Chile’s Violeta Parra. This concert is free, and the Puerto Rican pop singer JOATA will open. 212-721-6500, lincolncenter.org RYAN HURD at Bowery Ballroom (Jan. 25, 8 p.m.). Like many artists working to break through in Nashville, Hurd has an impressive roster of songs that he’s co-written for country stars: Darius Rucker, Dierks Bentley, Florida Georgia Line and Tim McGraw. While writing “Last Turn Home” for McGraw, Hurd met his wife, Maren Morris; now he’s guest-starring in her music videos. The songs he writes for himself are charmingly romantic, painting pictures of understated, easy affection. On “Love in a Bar” (which, naturally, is about Morris) he sings about falling hard for someone while sharing a few beers; his latest single, “To a T,” is an ode to a cozy night in. Both show his flair for believable love songs that aren’t cloyingly sweet. 212-260-4700, boweryballroom.com LES SAVY FAV at Junction (Jan. 25, 8 p.m.) and Elsewhere (Jan. 26, 7 p.m.). On Friday and Saturday, this art-punk quintet will perform their first local shows in more than two years. The band members have been experimenting with noise, pop and punk music for over two decades, but at this point — nearly nine years after their last new album, and with two members locked into a regular gig on “Late Night With Seth Meyers” — Les Savy Fav’s raucous, unpredictable live shows remain their calling card. Their gig at Junction in Long Beach, N.Y., is a benefit for Tommy Brull Foundation, an organization dedicated to helping people with special needs on Long Island; the band’s set at Elsewhere is sold out, but tickets are available through resellers. 516-889-1680, junction11561.comelsewherebrooklyn.com KACEY MUSGRAVES at the Beacon Theater (Jan. 25-26, 8 p.m.). A young country singer selling out two nights at one of New York City’s biggest theaters is newsworthy in and of itself; the fact that said country singer, Musgraves, is a woman working at a moment when country radio seems to be hostile to female artists only adds to the significance of this success. Long a critical darling, Musgraves took a pop-oriented swing with her mellow, sweet 2018 release, “Golden Hour,” and with its Grammy nomination for album of the year, she appears to have hit a home run. Tickets for both shows are available on the resale market. 212-465-6000, beacontheatre.com WU-TANG CLAN at Terminal 5 (Jan. 26-27, 8 p.m.). As part of the extended 25th anniversary celebration for their seminal 1993 debut, “Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers),” this Staten Island-bred rap group is performing two rare New York shows. Many of Wu-Tang’s nine founding members, including GZA, RZA, Method Man, Ghostface Killah and Raekwon, have found substantial success outside the group; “36 Chambers,” though, still holds importance. RZA recently told Complex of the release that “each of our lyrics are potent and become more substantiated as time goes on.” Both shows are sold out, but tickets are available through resellers. 212-582-6600, terminal5nyc.com [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] YOUNG DOLPH at Gramercy Theater (Jan. 31, 7 p.m.). Succeeding in rap without first rising through the ranks in one of its hubs — New York, Chicago, Atlanta or Los Angeles — is challenging. Yet Young Dolph’s commitment to representing his hometown, Memphis, remains steadfast. He’s also stayed independent, another unlikely choice for an M.C. who trades in catchy trap beats and streetwise lyrics just slightly more hard edged than the current trends on commercial rap radio. Fresh off his biggest solo success to date with the single “Major,” though, Dolph is starting to reap some rewards. The show is sold out, but tickets are available on the resale market.212-614-6932, thegramercytheatre.comNATALIE WEINER BRAXTON COOK at Baby’s All Right (Jan. 25, 8 p.m.). A gifted young alto saxophonist and vocalist, Cook is both a graduate of Juilliard’s notoriously traditionalist jazz program and a veteran of Christian Scott aTunde Adjuah’s genre-bending ensembles. In his increasingly acclaimed solo projects, Cook builds a contemporary, jazz-pop identity that draws from 1970s fusion, ’80s R&B and contemporary Los Angeles hip-hop. Through it all, he finds a way to let his bebop-rooted saxophone improvisations shine. At this concert, featuring a guest appearance from the trumpeter Theo Croker, he will draw material from “No Doubt,” an album he released late last year.babysallright.com ANTONIO HART QUINTET at Smoke (Jan. 25-26, 7, 9 and 10:30 p.m.). Hart, a stellar alto saxophonist who burst onto the New York scene alongside Roy Hargrove in the early 1990s as part of the Young Lions generation, has always worn his debt to Cannonball Adderley on his cuffs. Here he presents a tribute to Adderley, an iconic hard-bop saxophonist, in a quintet that features Freddie Hendrix on trumpet, Caili O’Doherty on piano, Alex Ayala on bass and Cory Cox on drums.212-864-6662, smokejazz.com VIJAY IYER at Jazz Standard (through Jan. 27, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). Iyer’s sextet has been one of the hottest commodities in jazz since the release of its debut, “Far From Over,” in 2017. A version of that band will play on Friday and Saturday, presenting Iyer’s beaming, rhythmically interleaved original music. Then on Sunday, Iyer will perform with a newer group that features some of his colleagues and students at Harvard University, where he teaches. (He’s also a MacArthur fellow.) That band is called the Ritual Ensemble, and it features Ganavya Doraiswamy on vocals, Yosvany Terry on saxophones and Rajna Swaminathan on mridangam, an Indian percussion instrument.212-576-2232, jazzstandard.com AVA MENDOZA ET AL. at H0L0 (Jan. 31, 7 p.m.). A conclave of young avant-garde improvisers will descend on this darkened basement in Ridgewood, Queens, for a night of free playing. It’s hard to know where things will go; if you go, steel yourself for a wide variety of musical textures and temperaments, most of them liberated from standard time and harmony. The performers include the thrashing, post-metal guitarist Ava Mendoza; the pensive tenor saxophonist Ingrid Laubrock; and the bassist Brandon Lopez, who uses his instrument in a variety of nontraditional ways.h0l0.nyc ‘THE MUSIC OF ANTHONY BRAXTON’ at Roulette (Jan. 25, 8 p.m.). One of the premier — and most prolific — living American composers, Braxton continues to release reams of new music, typically drawing on improvisation and built around his own complex musical systems. On Friday his 12-disc collection titled “GTM (Syntax) 2017,” featuring his Tri-Centric Vocal Ensemble, comes out. Here an 11-person version of that group performs in celebration of the record’s release. Afterward, the electronic musician Carl Testa and the pianist Cory Smythe will play music from a different part of Braxton’s repertoire, using a compositional system of his called Echo Echo Mirror House Music. 917-267-0368, roulette.org WADADA LEO SMITH at the Appel Room (Jan. 26, 7 and 9:30 p.m.). Every recording Smith releases feels apt to be called a “landmark.” It’s the awe-inspiring, wide-screen breadth of his trumpet sound, the slowly accruing power of his compositions, and his way of making even small ensembles sound spacious — and ancient. “America’s National Parks,” his widely acclaimed 2016 release celebrating the natural wonders of North America, stands out in particular for its tumultuous melodic beauty and the bristling, mutating forms of its compositions. At Jazz at Lincoln Center, Smith presents the New York City debut of this work, joined by the personnel from the album: the pianist Anthony Davis, the cellist Ashley Walters, the bassist John Lindberg and the drummer Pheeroan akLaff.212-721-6500, jazz.orgGIOVANNI RUSSONELLO "

BIG FREEDIA at Brooklyn Bowl (Jan. 11-12, 11:59 p.m.). The latest EP, “3rd Ward Bounce,” from New Orleans’s best-known bounce ambassador surges with a high-energy vibe, which concertgoers can expect to be in full force at these shows. And the late hour should enhance the performances, loosening the audience’s inhibitions and encouraging people from all backgrounds to twerk to the irresistible rap-dance blend. Bounce has had a notable influence on a number of recent pop hits, including Drake’s “Nice for What” and Beyoncé’s “Formation,” both of which feature Freedia.718-963-3369, brooklynbowl.com KATE BOLLINGER at Trans-Pecos (Jan. 12, 8 p.m.). This singer-songwriter from Charlottesville, who hasn’t yet graduated from the University of Virginia, makes delicate, R&B-tinged pop; her most recent song, “Tests,” sounds like a lullaby, but nearly imperceptible electronic percussion gives it some unexpected flair. She is joined on the bill by two other similarly minded artists, each abstractly confessional with guitars in tow: Caroline Schuck is a local who sings compellingly about  identity crises; Grace Ludmila veers more toward dream pop. The bill’s gritty foil to these three performers is the experimental banjo player Gouox. thetranspecos.com DJ LOGIC at Brooklyn Bowl (Jan. 17, 8 p.m.). Growing up in the Bronx, this turntablist was surrounded by rap’s earliest experiments with jazz via sampling. His music, though, puts the two genres in conversation in a far different way: He uses his turntable as an instrument, going far beyond the flourishes meant to add streetwise flair. Instead, he improvises through spinning, scratching and sampling with bands that span jazz, funk and R&B. On Thursday, he’ll be joined by guests such as the jazz bassist Christian McBride and Living Colour’s Vernon Reid, who has long been his mentor.718-963-3369, brooklynbowl.com LADY MOON & THE ECLIPSE at National Sawdust (Jan. 11, 8 p.m.). There’s a lunar eclipse happening on Jan. 20, so the Brooklyn R&B collective named after that astronomical event is going on tour — a ritual they’ve developed over the past few years. The group specializes in neosoul with a cross-genre bent that manifests through Afrobeat, gospel and funk. The result is charmingly retro, with rich harmonies and an emphasis on live instrumentation. Harsh Armadillo, a funk band from New Hampshire, and the Nigeria-born saxophonist and D.J. Eli Fola open.646-779-8455, nationalsawdust.org MUNYA at Elsewhere (Jan. 16, 8 p.m.). Making nostalgic French pop that isn’t overwhelmingly cloying is a feat in itself, but the Montreal singer-songwriter Josie Boivin, who records under the name Munya, has even more to offer. Her breathy soprano, layers of synths and a band that can go from understated groove to maximalist jam in the space of a chorus merge to create songs that are engaging, even as they create an easy ambience. “I don’t justify/Everything comes and goes,” she sings on “Some More,” lyrics that are reassuringly laissez-faire.elsewherebrooklyn.com SLICK RICK at Brooklyn Bowl (Jan. 11, 8:30 p.m.). The hip-hop legend is hosting what’s billed as his “9th annual” birthday celebration — which means he’s turning 54 on Monday. And his debut, “The Great Adventures of Slick Rick,” reached an important milestone in November: its 30th anniversary. The album includes “Children’s Story,” familiar to most through Montell Jordan’s “This Is How We Do It” and the lyric “Once upon a time, not long ago,” a catchphrase in mainstream hip-hop. Much of his music has had a similarly long tail: Even those who’ve never listened to it will likely hear something familiar.718-963-3369, brooklynbowl.comNATALIE WEINER DARCY JAMES ARGUE’S SECRET SOCIETY at the Jazz Gallery (Jan. 11-12, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). Maybe you’ve heard: New York’s big-band scene is quietly roaring again (not that it ever went completely silent). If you’re trying to find the action, the Gallery is a good place to start, and to understand where a lot of today’s young composer-bandleaders draw their inspiration, Darcy James Argue’s long-running Secret Society ensemble is a good bet. This weekend the sophisticated, space-rock-tinged, 18-piece band will perform works from across its three-disc catalog, as well as some unrecorded numbers. (On Thursday, the Gallery will also host its 12th Jazz Composers’ Showcase, organized by Miho Hazama, with a house big band playing compositions by three young composers.)646-494-3625, jazzgallery.nyc EMMET COHEN TRIO WITH RON CARTER at the Village Vanguard (Jan. 15-20, 8:30 and 10:30 p.m.). Cohen is a young piano virtuoso with a delicate touch and an assured, swaggering swing feel; he has endeared himself to some of the most imposing figures in straight-ahead jazz, and plays in bands led by the bassist Christian McBride and the drummer Herlin Riley. But there may be no living jazz musician with more cachet than Ron Carter, the 81-year-old bassist and National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master — and technically Cohen counts him as a side musician. On the album that Cohen, Carter and the drummer Evan Sherman released in 2018, Carter’s slippery bass and Cohen’s debonair flow are all sorts of simpatico.212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com THEO CROKER at Ginny’s Supper Club (Jan. 11-12, 7 and 9 p.m.). A young trumpeter who’s equal parts insouciance and fleet command, Croker recently unveiled a new ensemble: the Big Brother Big Band. That group will cram onto the stage at Ginny’s on Friday, giving uptown listeners their first glimpse at Big Brother’s soul-and-hip-hop-infused take on the large-ensemble tradition. On Saturday, Croker returns to Ginny’s with a smaller group.212-421-3821, ginnyssupperclub.com ORRIN EVANS QUINTET at Smoke (Jan. 11-13, 7, 9 and 10:30 p.m.). Evans, a daring Philadelphia pianist, is as deeply rooted in bebop tradition as he is versatile and incursive. His Captain Black Big Band (which used to hold down a weekly residency at Smoke) released one of last year’s best large-ensemble records, but he’s equally enthralling as a leader of small groups. Here Evans, 43, presents a quintet featuring powerful players from across generations with the upstarts Josh Lawrence on trumpet and Caleb Curtis on alto saxophone, plus the bassist Ben Wolfe and the drummer Ralph Peterson, both respected veterans in their mid-50s.212-864-6662, smokejazz.com JAZZ AT LINCOLN CENTER ORCHESTRA AND NATIONAL SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA OF ROMANIA at the Rose Theater (Jan. 11-12, 8 p.m.). Wynton Marsalis is Jazz at Lincoln Center’s artistic director and the lead composer for its large ensemble. The New York Philharmonic commissioned him to write a piece it could perform in collaboration with Marsalis’s Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra, and he came up with “The Jungle (Symphony No. 4),” an ode to the urban frenzy of New York City, which premiered in 2016. (It is apparently not a reference to Upton Sinclair’s working-class novel of the same name, which is set in Chicago.) Here the Jazz at Lincoln Center ensemble will perform the work with the visiting National Symphony Orchestra of Romania.212-721-6500, jazz.org JUSTICE IS COMPASSION at Nublu 151 (Jan. 16-21, 7:30 p.m.). Arts for Art, the organization behind the annual Vision Festival and presenters of and advocates for free jazz, is back this year with a souped-up version of this wintertime festival. Started in January 2016, it has become an annual Trump-era tradition for a group committed to strengthening the ties that bind radical music and social justice. This year, the festival has been wisely pared down to six days, and has moved into the nicely outfitted room at Nublu 151, a step up from the small gallery space it formerly used. Things kick off Wednesday night with a trio featuring the bassist Michael Bisio, the trumpeter Kirk Knuffke and the cellist Fred Lonberg-Holm and a quartet including the trumpeter Jaimie Branch and the alto saxophonist Darius Jones. Each subsequent night appears promising; a full schedule is at artsforart.org.nublu.net GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO For an overview of January and February’s cultural events, click here. "
5c2dab2f3a125f5075c02a1b,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/03/world/australia/twisted-sister-clive-palmer.html,"SYDNEY, Australia — It’s the same thrashing guitar and rock music, but the words are different from the lyrics of Twisted Sister’s hit song, and the band is not impressed. The rock band from New Jersey has told an Australian politician to stop using its song “We’re Not Gonna Take It” in his advertising campaign. Clive Palmer, a conservative politician and mining magnate, rolled out a national marketing campaign for his center-right United Australia Party over the holiday period. Ads from the campaign use the music from “We’re Not Gonna Take It,” changing the words to “Australia ain’t gonna cop it.” The ads criticize spending and delays related to the National Broadband Network, an infrastructure project intended to improve the country’s internet speeds. Dee Snider, the lead singer of Twisted Sister, responded on Twitter this week to questions from users who were incensed by the ad’s “butchering” of the song. He said the band was considering legal action. One of the band’s guitarists, Jay Jay French, also said on Twitter that the band had not been informed that its music would be used for political purposes. Mr. Palmer responded by suggesting that the band members were motivated by poor ticket sales. Mr. Snider is scheduled to perform in Sydney and Melbourne this month. “Old rocker who can not sell enough tickets to their last gig need publicity,” Mr. Palmer wrote in a text message to Australia’s ABC News on Wednesday. He, too, threatened to sue. “I wrote the words personally that appear on our promotion and hold the copyright for those words,” The Sydney Morning Herald quoted Mr. Palmer as saying. If members of the band “attempt to use my lyrics in any of their songs, I’ll not hesitate to take legal proceedings against them,” he said. “As foreigners, they should stay out of Australian domestic politics and stay where they are. Aussies are not going to cop it at all!” This is not the first time Twisted Sister has clashed with politicians about the song, which, when it was released in 1984, struck a chord with its themes of rebellion and freedom of choice. Paul D. Ryan, the outgoing speaker of the United States House of Representatives, used it during his vice-presidential run with former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts in 2012. Mr. Snider’s statement at the time denouncing Mr. Ryan’s use of the song included the comment: “There is almost nothing on which I agree with Paul Ryan, except perhaps the use of the P90X,” referring to Mr. Ryan’s workout program. Mr. Snider did, however, allow Donald Trump to use the song in his presidential campaign. Mr. Snider told Newsweek that Mr. Trump was a friend and had asked him for permission, which he gave because Mr. Trump’s “rebelling” was in the song’s spirit. (Mr. Snider has since said that he was “not a fan of Trump’s style,” though he said the president was “not being given a chance.”) Mr. Snider harkened back to the rebellion theme in further Twitter posts regarding Mr. Palmer’s advertisement. “‘We’re Not Gonna Take It’ is a song about EVERYONE’S right to free choice,” he said. Mr. Palmer and his party “are NOT pro choice,” Mr. Snider wrote. “So THIS AIN’T HIS SONG!” "
5c8f04e649f0eacbf105d964,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/17/obituaries/dick-dale-dead.html,"Dick Dale, who was known as the King of the Surf Guitar and recorded the hit song “Misirlou,” which was revived on the “Pulp Fiction” film soundtrack, died on Saturday in Loma Linda, Calif. He was 81. His death, at Loma Linda University Medical Center, was confirmed by Joseph Gieniec, a longtime friend, who said Mr. Dale had been in treatment for heart and kidney failure. Mr. Dale was a surfer, sound pioneer and guitarist whose unusual, percussive playing style and thick, thunderous music earned him the nickname the Father of Heavy Metal. He influenced the Beach Boys, the Cure, Eddie Van Halen and Jimi Hendrix, among others. Sam Bolle, a bassist who played with Mr. Dale’s namesake band, Dick Dale, for about 15 years, described him as an “aggressive and ferocious” musician who played like one of the lions Mr. Dale raised at his home. “I played a gig with him about a month ago,” Mr. Bolle said. “He was still slaughtering people with volume.” Mr. Dale was born Richard Monsour in Boston on May 4, 1937, to Sophia (Danksewicz) Monsour, known as Fern, and James Monsour. After learning how to play the ukulele, Mr. Dale developed a musical signature influenced by the traditions of his father, who was Lebanese, and his mother, who was from Eastern Europe, and by the flamboyant big-band drummer Gene Krupa. After the family moved to Southern California in around 1955, Mr. Dale’s father quit his job at an aerospace and defense company to manage his son’s career. Mr. Monsour booked him in talent shows and movies, including a cameo as an Elvis Presley impersonator in the Marilyn Monroe movie “Let’s Make Love.” But Mr. Dale became known for defining the sound of surf guitar as a musical expression of the elemental surge of the ocean, with its savage waves, its volatile crosscurrents and its tidal undertow. He played melodies that crisscrossed the beat with the determination of a surfer riding through choppy waves, forging a triumphant path above deep turbulence. “Surf music is a heavy machine-gun staccato picking style to represent the power of Mother Nature, of our earth, of our ocean,” he told The New York Times in 1994. His almost constant tremolo created friction so intense that it melted his guitar picks and strings as he played. “The staccato is so fast it heat-treats the strings,” he said. “They turn purple and black and they snap. And when I play, you’ll see a flurry of plastic — it just falls down like snow. I used to think it was dandruff. But I grind so hard that the guitar picks just melt down.” His quest for a sonic impact to match what he had felt while surfing also led to innovations that would change the technology of electric guitars and amplification. Leo Fender, one of the electric guitar’s trailblazers, worked with Mr. Dale to create a guitar sturdy enough to withstand his style — Mr. Dale called it the Beast — and an 85-watt amplifier that could crank up loud enough to fill a dance hall. “Leo and I went to Lansing Speaker,” Mr. Dale said in 1994, “and we said, ‘We need a speaker that will not burn, will not flex, will not twist, will not break.’ ” In the fast-changing 1960s, instrumental surf rock reigned briefly on the charts, and the Beach Boys used it as one foundation of their pop songs. Mr. Dale’s brash playing also found fans in Jimi Hendrix and many other guitarists, and, decades later among a generation of indie-rockers, who prized his untamed sound. Chris Darrow, a multi-instrumentalist who has been in the music industry for more than 50 years, first saw Mr. Dale perform at the Rendezvous Ballroom in Newport Beach, Calif., in the early 1960s. “The intensity and volume of the performances were such that the wooden building seemed to lift off the ground when he played,” Mr. Darrow said in an interview with the music journalist Harvey Kubernik. “Until the Beatles came along, there was nothing that drove the audiences as wild like Dick Dale and the Del-Tones. He was boss.” “The only real surf guitarist for me is Dick Dale,” he added. “All the rest are imitators.” In 1963, Mr. Dale’s music was catapulted onto a national stage when he performed “Misirlou,” an adaptation of a traditional Arabic song, on “The Ed Sullivan Show.” The song re-entered the mainstream in 1994 as the opening anthem for Quentin Tarantino’s blockbuster film “Pulp Fiction.” The drummer Dusty Watson, who performed with Mr. Dale for more than a decade, said that Mr. Dale had been sick for a while but that “he’s such a bull,” he thought he would “power through it.” “He’s an incredible loss for music,” he said. Mr. Dale’s survivors include his wife and manager, Lana Dale; his son, Jimmy; and his sister, Shirley Rudolph. His marriage to Jill Blackwill ended in divorce. For years, Mr. Dale struggled with health issues, including bouts with rectal cancer and renal failure. But he performed through the illnesses. “Don’t worry about yesterday and don’t worry about tomorrow,” Mr. Dale told California Rocker, an online music publication, in 2015. “Don’t worry about yesterday because it’s used. It’s either good or it leaves you feeling bad. And don’t waste time or energy worrying about tomorrow. “I could have a stroke and be dead. That’s why they call it the present. It’s a present.” "
5c375d1d3a125f5075c03bcc,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/10/arts/music/rat-boy-internationally-unknown.html,"CHELMSFORD, England — On a farm 15 minutes north of downtown Chelmsford, a smallish Essex commuter city 30 minutes by train from London, Jordan Cardy has begun turning his 1990s dreams into reality. A couple of months ago, the 22-year-old musician who records as Rat Boy rented a huge empty warehouse a short walk to a lovely little stream and a slightly longer walk to a small black sign leaning against a decayed wall that reads FARM TOILET. Here, slowly, he, his father, and brother have been building out the raw space into a place — inspired by the Beastie Boys’ old G-Son Studios in Los Angeles — where he can work, and also play. A few days before Christmas, it was mostly empty save for a roughly fashioned studio. On one wall was a Public Enemy “Fear of a Black Planet” poster. On a shelf was an autographed vinyl copy of the Beastie Boys’ “Hello Nasty.” On the center table, an old issue of the Beasties’ publication Grand Royal and some obscure graffiti magazines. Up against the wall, a small-scale screen printing rig and several of Cardy’s ghoulishly realistic illustrations. Sitting on a pallet under a blanket was an Amek Einstein console, the same kind that the Dust Brothers used to work on, that Cardy bought for about 6,000 pounds on the internet from Peru. It’s the most money he’s ever spent on anything, he said, but he still wasn’t sure it worked. This month Cardy will release the second Rat Boy album, “Internationally Unknown,” a high-energy collision of punk convulsion and hip-hop storytelling full of raucously fun, sharp-tongued songs about slackerdom, resistance and disorderly joy. It’s shaped by late 1970s punk with flickers of dub, nods to 1990s hip-hop (and also the early 2000s English rapper the Streets), and embraces the musical exuberance of 2000s pop-punk. Which is to say, it is an extremely of-the-moment amalgam, refusing to draw distinctions between genres. It’s also part of a long continuum of British punk that looks for kinship in black music and part of a wider re-engagement with the 1990s as source material. [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] The 1990s are the leading touchstone for Cardy, who has studied the era with loving devotion and built a specific, refined aesthetic from it: “It’s a bunch of people that are around my age making something for themselves. I love the way stuff looks — making their own magazines, the music, being motivated to put stuff out,” he said, slumped in a chair wearing a Supreme bottle cap T-shirt, his hair pink and scraggly. “They did everything right, but did they know they were doing it right?” “I kind of see Jordan as the nexus of what was happening in the ’90s when punk and hip-hop were blowing up,” said Brett Gurewitz, the founder and chief executive of Epitaph Records, which is releasing “Internationally Unknown” via its Hellcat imprint. “Rat Boy is the embodiment of that time.” Similarly, Cardy, too, has been figuring things out by trial and error. For a young person gravitating toward art and music, Chelmsford — he grew up in this city of around 100,000, and hasn’t lived elsewhere — was an unremarkable place to be. Mostly, Cardy hung out with friends at the city’s lone skate park. When he became curious about music, YouTube was his university. “I used to watch thousands of videos,” he said. Cardy’s natural artistic curiosity was buttressed by a creeping sense of outsiderness. “When I was in school when I was a kid, I did feel like there were not, like, people that were into the same stuff,” he said. “Everyone was into what was happening around here, and I’m just liking [expletive] that happened 20 years ago.” He became increasingly inspired after seeing the early success of King Krule, the London singer and songwriter who, in the early 2010s, when he was still a teenager, broke through with a fascinating punk-jazz hybrid: “It really motivated me to see someone like that doing it at that age.” When Cardy finally began posting his self-produced songs to SoundCloud, he began emailing the links as widely as he could. One of the first people in the music business he met was Drew McConnell, who plays bass in the British band Babyshambles (which is fronted by Pete Doherty) and was introduced to Cardy’s music by an intern at his publishing company. Before long, McConnell was setting up management and label meetings for Cardy, who was sleeping on his sofa. [Here are 10 more artists to watch in 2019.] “He had obviously listened to a lot of records,” McConnell said. “The way he would sing would remind me of Elvis Costello, or Robert Smith from the Cure. But at the same time he’s a huge hip-hop fan.” Cardy signed to Parlophone — home to Babyshambles and also Coldplay — and began working on his first album, “Scum,” a loose and exciting collection of songs that range from punk to dub to hip-hop. (An early version of one of them was sampled on Kendrick Lamar’s “Lust,” from his 2017 album “DAMN.”) “That’s what I thought a first record is, I thought like it’s all over the place,” Cardy said. “It was just guessing.” On the album’s deluxe version, the songs are interwoven with skits, in part because Cardy felt like the songs themselves didn’t tell a consistent story. “When the record was done it was kind of like, ‘You need to have a single’ at the end,” he said. And while he obliged, “I released two songs as singles that are [expletive] in my opinion, trying to write a pop song.” McConnell joked that a mainstream record label signing Cardy was like the government capturing a disruptive hacker “and being like, ‘you work for us now.’” For his second album, Cardy knew he wanted to tell a more consistent story, and was introduced to Tim Armstrong, of the California street-punk legends Operation Ivy and Rancid and the punk-hip-hop hybrid pioneers Transplants, and also Gurewitz’s partner in Hellcat. When they first spoke on the phone, the first thing they agreed on was tempo: 170 bpm, fast enough for punk mayhem but also, at half time, a comfortable in-the-pocket pace for rapping. Cardy went to Los Angeles and spent six weeks working with Armstrong at the Boat, once the studio of the Dust Brothers. (John King of the Dust Brothers also worked on the new album.) They recorded live takes, then chopped up and sampled the results. The guitars are hard-charging and dirty, and the rapping and singing is delivered with a blend of sneer and ennui: On “I Wanna Skate,” he’s yelling in the most casual manner, “You want it now? I wanna wait!/You want a Benz? I wanna skate!” In person, Cardy is gentle and soft-edged. But on both his first and second records, his attitude is consistent: a permanently extended middle finger to authority, and a robust sense of working class agitation. His best songwriting is in a narrative style that he learned listening to hip-hop: Slick Rick’s “Children’s Story,” Prince Paul’s “A Prince Among Thieves,” Too Short. AFTER TALKING FOR a while in his new studio, Cardy hopped in a van driven by his guitar tech, Tuck. (Chelmsford is a small enough city that it was Tuck who sold 12-year-old Cardy his first guitar.) They headed over to Cardy’s family’s house, where the yard overflowed with half-finished projects belonging to his dad, Brett, who does fabrication work on automobiles and other vehicles. It was Brett who introduced a 6-year-old Cardy to the first Transplants album. And it was Brett’s example of making something from nothing that Cardy identifies as the germ of his own D.I.Y. instincts. Until he was around 18, Cardy assumed he’d become a graphic designer, or maybe a tattoo artist. Some of his earliest art — inspired by the cars his father worked on, and the ones they raced on weekends — was in the style of Ed Roth, the hot rod artist. When he was young, art and music were always commingled; he’d have Myspace pages for bands with song art but no songs. He still does all the artwork for his projects — “I always thought you do everything yourself,” he said — films wild CKY-style videos with his friends, and also has a budding streetwear line, Scum. His father wasn’t home, so Cardy arranged to meet him at the local garage where he was working for the day. On the way, he pointed out a lone Rat Boy graffiti tag on the back of a road sign near a roundabout. A few minutes later he found his father jawing away with a couple of car-customizer friends. Brett is salty, profane, thick-skinned — a bruiser to Cardy’s anxious artist. But Brett also supports Cardy’s flights of creative fancy. The Burberry tartan-painted car from Cardy’s early music videos was done by Brett (and part of it is in Cardy’s warehouse, along with some other vehicles Brett chopped-and-remixed). Their conversation was amiable, a little punchy. Cardy recalled how Brett never pushed him to pursue things he didn’t feel strongly about, like schoolwork: “It’s always been, like, do what you want to do.” They spoke about Cardy’s music and the unlikeliness of his performance intensity, joked about living in close quarters and celebrated hating authority. Recalling when Cardy was first learning to race cars, Brett explained his hands-off parenting philosophy, which felt like the foundation for all of Cardy’s subsequent life choices. “Just let him crash,” Brett said. “He ain’t going to do it twice.” "
5c2fd22b3a125f5075c02e89,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/obituaries/honey-lantree-dead.html,"Anne Lantree’s life changed after a chance encounter with a drum kit in 1963. She was working in a hair salon in London owned by her friend Martin Murray. Mr. Murray moonlighted as the rhythm guitarist in an amateur rock ’n’ roll band called the Sheratons, whose drummer had recently quit. His drum kit was still set up at the group’s rehearsal space, and Ms. Lantree, who was there for a guitar lesson, asked if she could try it. Mr. Murray acquiesced, he said in an interview on Thursday, “not giving any thought that she would jump on these drums and play like she had her whole life.” “She was just a born, natural drummer; she hadn’t played before and just went for it,” Mr. Murray continued. “I was aghast, staring at her, and said, ‘All right, you’re our new drummer.’ ” Ms. Lantree’s impromptu solo was the start of a whirlwind career as one of the few women to play drums in a 1960s rock group. The Sheratons soon became the Honeycombs, with Ms. Lantree billed as Honey, and released “Have I the Right?,” a bouncy love song that reached No. 1 on the British pop charts and No. 5 in the United States. Ms. Lantree died on Dec. 23 at her home in Great Bardfield, Essex, England. She was 75. Her son Matthew Coxall said the cause was breast cancer. Female drummers are rare in rock music, and were even rarer in the 1960s. That did not stop Ms. Lantree, who soon began performing with the band. The group, which also featured Dennis D’Ell as lead singer, Allan Ward on lead guitar and John Lantree, her brother, on bass, performed nightly at a local pub that quickly became swamped with admirers. At one show the band met Alan Blaikley and Ken Howard, two aspiring songwriters, and they offered the group “Have I the Right?” (the title is sometimes rendered without the question mark) and many of the other songs that would make up its first album. The band used its new material to audition for the record producer Joe Meek, who immediately saw their potential. They recorded “Have I the Right?” in Mr. Meek’s studio. Featuring twanging guitars and thumping drums augmented by stomping feet, the song was released as a single by Pye Records, whose managing director suggested that Ms. Lantree go by Honey and that the group become the Honeycombs. The Honeycombs appeared on television and released their first album, called simply “The Honeycombs,” in 1964. Some journalists accused the group of using Ms. Lantree, who dressed stylishly and sported a beehive hairdo, as a gimmick. Some even questioned whether she had actually played the drums on “Have I the Right?” “We couldn’t do nothing about it,” Mr. Murray said, “just deny it, which is the truth.” In late 1964, Peter Pye replaced Mr. Murray, and in 1965 the Honeycombs set off on a tour of Scandinavia, Australia and parts of Asia. That same year the group reached No. 12 on the British pop charts with “That’s the Way,” in which Ms. Lantree sang with Mr. D’Ell, and released a second album, “All Systems Go!” But the Honeycombs’ greatest success was already behind them, and the band broke up in 1967. “It was very traumatic,” Ms. Lantree told an Australian newspaper in 1991. “I was still living at home with my parents, and I went back to hairdressing. People still recognized me, and it was hard to get on with a new life.” Anne Margot Lantree was born on Aug. 28, 1943, in Hayes, Middlesex, England, to John and Nora (Gould) Lantree. Her father owned a sign-making business, and her mother was a homemaker. The family moved to Highams Park, in Northeast London, and Ms. Lantree attended high school there before she started working in Mr. Murray’s salon. Ms. Lantree married David Coxall, a pensions administrator, in 1969. He died in 2018. In addition to her son Matthew, she is survived by another son, Simon; a brother, John; and five grandchildren. Ms. Lantree’s time at the top of the charts was fleeting, but she was not finished with music. Beginning in the 1980s she played with different versions of the Honeycombs. She stopped only when Mr. D’Ell died in 2005. "
5c3d1c5c3a125f5075c04623,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/obituaries/clydie-king-dead.html,"Clydie King, whose peppery but plain-spoken backing vocals helped define hits like the Rolling Stones’ “Tumbling Dice,” Linda Ronstadt’s “You’re No Good” and — despite her reservations about it — Lynyrd Skynyrd’s “Sweet Home Alabama,” died on Jan. 7 in Monrovia, Calif. She was 75. Tony Collins, her former husband, said her death, at Monrovia Memorial Hospital, was caused by complications of a blood infection that she had acquired during dialysis treatment. Ms. King joined Bob Dylan’s band in 1980, when he was in the midst of his Christian-rock phase, beginning a long association with him. Mr. Dylan had recently converted to evangelical Christianity, and the two bonded over music and faith. She became a central part of his ensemble, and they started a romantic relationship that lasted through the mid-’80s. In a statement to the news media on the occasion of Ms. King’s death, Mr. Dylan said: “She was my ultimate singing partner. No one ever came close. We were two soul mates.” Ms. King recorded dozens of songs under her own name in the 1960s, and in the next decade she released a smattering of solo albums on independent labels. But she never scored a breakthrough hit. Instead, by the mid-’70s she had established herself as a first-call backing vocalist, working with B. B. King, Joe Cocker, Odetta, Steely Dan and many others. Starting in 1966 she spent three years as a core member of Ray Charles’s famed backing vocal troupe, the Raelettes. Another member was Merry Clayton, who also went on to become a top-tier background singer and collaborated frequently with Ms. King over the coming decade. In the early 1970s, Ms. King was a leader of the Blackberries, a soul- and disco-oriented group that recorded for Motown’s West Coast affiliate, Mowest. She released three solo albums for small labels in the ’70s: “Direct Me,” a sparky soul-funk effort, in 1971; “Brown Sugar,” in 1973; and “Rushing to Meet You,” with a disco bent, in 1976. She stepped away from performing in the mid-’80s for health reasons, and never made a full comeback. Ms. King is survived by a sister, Enober Green; a brother, Willie King; two sons, Christopher and Randy Hale, from her marriage to Robin Hale; and a number of grandchildren. A third son from that marriage, Magge Hale, died before her, as did a daughter, Delores Collins, from her marriage to Mr. Collins. Both marriages ended in divorce. Clydie Mae King was born in Dallas on Aug. 21, 1943. Her mother died when she was 2 years old, and she was raised primarily by her older sister, Lula Mae Crittendon. Ms. King sang in her church choir as a child, and she stood out early. At age 8, she appeared on a national television show hosted by Art Linkletter. Soon after, her family moved to Los Angeles, where Ms. King started her recording career at 13, fronting a doo-wop group called Little Clydie and the Teens. Over the succeeding years she recorded frequently as a leader, mostly in a classic doo-wop or soul style, for the Specialty, Philips, Minit and Imperial labels. One day in June 1973, at a time when she was working constantly as a background vocalist, she called Ms. Clayton and asked her to participate in the recording of “Sweet Home Alabama.” Ms. Clayton initially resisted, offended by the song’s lyrics. The irony was not lost on Ms. King, either, that two black women might contribute to a song seen by many as celebrating the conservative backlash against civil rights. But she persuaded Ms. Clayton to do the session anyway, and together their boisterous voices helped define what became a smash hit. “We really wanted nothing to do with any type of Alabama at that time in our lives,” Ms. Clayton recalled in an interview shortly after the release in 2013 of “20 Feet From Stardom,” Morgan Neville’s Oscar-winning documentary about backup singers. (That film helped bring Ms. Clayton’s career out of the shadows, but it did not feature Ms. King.) “That was a part of our protest, you know?” Ms. Clayton told  Rolling Stone. “We couldn’t stand on the front lines, but we could certainly sing ‘Sweet Home Alabama’ with all of our hearts and souls — a song that will live in infamy.” Ms. King first worked with Mr. Dylan on the sessions for “Saved” (1980), his second of three religious albums. She is also heard with him on “Shot of Love” (1981), his final Christian album; “Infidels” (1983); and the 2018 archival collection “The Bootleg Series Vol. 13: Trouble No More 1979–1981.” Ms. King and Mr. Dylan made a wealth of recordings as a duo, which have yet to be released. “There must be at least an album’s worth. We would often go into the studios and do little things,” Ms. King said in a 2007 interview with In the Basement, a British music magazine. “I don’t know why nothing was ever issued. I expect it had to do with record company politics.” The 2017 concert film “Trouble No More,” centering on footage from Mr. Dylan’s 1980 tours, features Ms. King prominently. It closes with her and Mr. Dylan seated together at the piano, singing a tender duet on “Abraham, Martin and John.” Alongside Ms. King, Mr. Dylan’s famously mercurial voice becomes clear and well pitched, and the two harmonize with ease. They appear to be playing to a largely empty arena, presumably during a sound check — but they seem unconcerned about who is or isn’t listening, lost as they are inside the music. "
5c35f05a3a125f5075c03867,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/09/arts/music/woodstock-50th-anniversary-festival.html,"WOODSTOCK, N.Y. — When the first Woodstock music festival was held in 1969, bringing around 400,000 people to a muddy field in Bethel, N.Y., it focused the world’s attention on pop music’s power to shape the culture. Half a century later, in a music market already jammed with big-ticket festivals, could another Woodstock muster the same impact? Michael Lang, one of the producers of the original event, is betting that it can. From Aug. 16 to 18 — almost exactly 50 years after the first Woodstock — he will present an official anniversary festival, Woodstock 50, in Watkins Glen, N.Y., with ambitions to not only attract a huge multigenerational audience but to rally those fans around a message of social activism. Mr. Lang, who at 74 still has some of the cherubic look seen in the 1970 documentary “Woodstock” — though his curls are threaded with gray — said in an interview at the festival office in Woodstock that he is still booking the acts for the new show; he is hoping for a mixture of legacy bands, current pop and rap stars and, possibly, some news-making combinations. But his vision for Woodstock’s 50th, he said, is clear: a large-scale camping weekend combining music with a program of films, speakers and partnerships with organizations like Head count, which registers young voters.  “Coachella’s got its thing, as does Bonnaroo and Lollapalooza,” Mr. Lang said. “But I think they’re all missing an opportunity to make a difference in the world. They’re all perfect places for social engagement and for fostering ideas, and I think that’s lost.” “We want this to be more than just coming to a concert,” he added. “And hopefully a lot of the bands will become part of this effort to get people to stand up and make themselves heard, to get and out vote. And if they don’t have a candidate that represents their feelings, to find one — or to run themselves.” Yet activism plays a significant part in a number of festivals. Environmental sustainability is central to Bonnaroo, for example, and this year Jay-Z’s Made in America Festival, in Philadelphia, has “Cause Village,” with some 56 charitable and activist organizations represented.  Woodstock 50 will be held in the fields surrounding the Watkins Glen International racetrack, where the Summer Jam in 1973 drew an estimated 600,000 people for the Grateful Dead, the Allman Brothers and the Band; more recently, it has been the site of two festivals by Phish.  For Woodstock, three main stages will be supplemented by three smaller “neighborhoods,” as Mr. Lang described them, with their own food and programming.  Tickets? Mr. Lang and his team are still working on that. But they envision selling a maximum of around 100,000 three-day passes, with most attendees camping on site. As with its other anniversary years, Woodstock’s 50th will be widely celebrated and exploited in the media, with books, albums and a PBS documentary among the projects planned. But unlike the last Woodstock anniversary concerts, in 1994 and 1999, which Mr. Lang presented along with partners, the event now faces severe competition from large-scale festivals around the country.  Coachella, Lollapalooza and Bonnaroo, the three biggest, are now highly developed brand names, with the drawing power to sell out well in advance; tickets for Coachella’s two weekends, for example, sold out in a matter of hours last week. There is even a competing Woodstock: the Bethel Woods Music and Culture Festival, over the same anniversary weekend — which will also feature “TED-style talks” — will be held on the same grounds as the original, around 60 miles from the town of Woodstock. (The Watkins Glen site is further afield, about 30 miles west of Ithaca.) For many concertgoers, another issue is whether the Woodstock name itself was damaged by the 1999 festival, which was marred by fires, rioting and reports of sexual assault.  “It’s not tainted,” Mr. Lang said. “’99 was more like an MTV event than a Woodstock event, really. I take some responsibility for that. It was also kind of an angry time in music.” And then there is the corporate consolidation of the concert business, which has grown especially intense over the last few years as two companies, Live Nation and AEG, compete to book major tours. Live Nation is a partner in the Bethel Woods event. “The industry has completely changed since 1999,” said John Scher, the veteran concert promoter who was a partner with Mr. Lang on Woodstock ’94 and ’99. “The entrepreneurial spirit of 1969 doesn’t exist anymore.” Mr. Lang declined to discuss the budget for Woodstock 50, but festivals of its size typically spend tens of millions on talent alone. “We paid $135,000 for all of our talent in 1969,” Mr. Lang said. “Times have changed.” The festival is being financed by the Dentsu Aegis Network, a unit of the Japanese advertising giant Dentsu; agencies within the Dentsu Aegis Network will be involved in marketing and selling sponsorships.  One advantage for Woodstock 50 is that it is “official.” Mr. Lang remains a partner in Woodstock Ventures, the company that controls the trademark rights, and licenses it for various products. The one Mr. Lang has been closest to is Woodstock Cannabis.  “Cannabis has always been in our DNA,” Mr. Lang said with a smile; his first commercial venture, in 1966, was a head shop in the Coconut Grove neighborhood of Miami. Of the other young men on the team that created Woodstock — Joel Rosenman, John Roberts and Artie Kornfeld — Rosenman is a partner in Woodstock Ventures, along with the family of Roberts, who died in 2001. Kornfeld will return as a consultant and “spiritual adviser,” Mr. Lang said.  Merchandise sales — particularly featuring the original Woodstock bird-and-guitar logo — provide one proxy for gauging the continuing appeal of the Woodstock brand. Dell Furano, the chief executive of Epic Rights, who has handled official Woodstock merchandise for 15 years, said that he is expecting over $100 million in retail sales of Woodstock licensed products in 2019 — four or five times that of non-anniversary years. “There’s every type of tie-dye. Children’s products. Dog products. Speakers, wine, cannabis,” Mr. Furano said in an interview. “The appeal is multigenerational.” In 1969, the mud, the tie-dye and the idealism were all catalysts in creating what the original festival had promised: three days of peace and music. Mr. Lang said that the divisiveness of the current political climate called for that once again. “It just seems like it’s a perfect time,” he said, “for a Woodstock kind of reminder.” "
5c6e77043a125f5075c0ac21,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/reader-center/ryan-adams-investigation.html,"Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together. For nearly five months, Joe Coscarelli and Melena Ryzik, culture reporters for The New York Times, collected accounts from dozens of sources, who detailed troubling behavior by Ryan Adams, the Grammy Award-nominated singer-songwriter. They outlined a spectrum of inappropriate acts, including emotional abuse of romantic partners and explicit text-message and video-chat exchanges with a minor Mr. Adams never met in person.  In response to The Times’s investigation, several high-profile artists who had worked with Mr. Adams reacted online. Karen Elson, the model and musician, wrote on Instagram, “I also had a traumatizing experience with Ryan Adams.” (She later deleted the post.) Todd Wisenbaker, a guitarist who has worked extensively with Mr. Adams, posted a statement on Instagram with the caption: “This is incredibly hard for me to do, but Ryan, please get help.” The pop star Mandy Moore, who was once married to Mr. Adams, repeated her own allegations against him on Marc Maron’s “WTF” podcast. “We’ve seen a number of musicians or people who are in that world say, yes, I’ve had a bad experience with Ryan Adams,” said Ms. Ryzik. In the days since the article ran on Feb. 13, the reporters said they have received at least a dozen additional direct tips. On Feb. 14, the F.B.I. opened an inquiry into whether Mr. Adams’s communications with the underage fan constitute a crime. Through his lawyer, he has denied the allegations. Mr. Coscarelli and Ms. Ryzik started their reporting after two nearly simultaneous events early last October: a discussion with a source who alluded to misconduct by a musician who turned out to be Mr. Adams, and an anonymous tip delivered through The Times’s tip line that suggested looking into his treatment of women.  Mr. Coscarelli and Ms. Ryzik reached out to women known to have dated or otherwise been associated with Mr. Adams — touring with him as a supporting act, for example.  With the women who had firsthand experiences and decided that they may want to come forward as sources, “the initial interview was always an hour and a half long, at a minimum,” Ms. Ryzik said.  Over the next few months, they were in contact with those women multiple times, making several trips to Los Angeles and Ohio to speak with them in person. In some cases, sources put them in touch with other women who had stories to share. There were, Mr. Coscarelli said, “many official interviews and then hundreds of texts, emails, check-ins, quick phone calls.” In the days after publication, Ms. Ryzik estimated that she had texted with Ms. Moore six times. As they listened to the women’s experiences and gathered corroborating information from other sources, they discovered certain patterns of behavior. In relationships, Mr. Adams could be controlling: insisting that one partner, the musician Phoebe Bridgers, prove her whereabouts, for example, and threatening suicide if a woman didn’t respond to his messages immediately. In the case of the young woman who was a teenager when she developed a texting relationship with Mr. Adams, several details stuck out as especially disturbing: video calls on Skype in which he exposed himself; nicknames for her body parts. Mr. Coscarelli and Ms. Ryzik have worked on several articles about sexual abuse, separately and together. One thing they’ve learned about addressing such a delicate subject is that the women involved know their experiences best. “They know what the most damaging and damning parts of their accounts are,” Ms. Ryzik said. “If something sticks out to them as, ‘This really shows what the problem is,’ then that’s the kind of detail that you want in the story.” It has been more than 500 days since The New York Times published its first article detailing the film producer Harvey Weinstein’s yearslong record of sexual harassment and assault allegations. The reporting set off a sea change both for Mr. Weinstein, who was arrested last May and is awaiting trial, and for culture at large. The #MeToo movement has unseated titans in industries including media, restaurants, politics and business, in many cases as a direct result of Times reporting that has continued to expose abuses of power and created ripple effects for those involved. One reason Mr. Coscarelli and Ms. Ryzik, as well as their editors, Caryn Ganz and Ian Trontz, felt the Ryan Adams story was important to tell was it provided a window into the complicated power arrangements that undergird the world of pop music. “The music industry isn’t like Hollywood; it doesn’t operate in the same kind of power structure,” Ms. Ganz said. “An artist can wield just as much power as a large executive; it’s just a matter of their influence and connections.” Mr. Coscarelli said the Ryan Adams case is an example of a complex spectrum of behavior that includes subtler abuses of power that have been harder to document — but are much more common.  “I think as we’re moving into Year 2 of #MeToo reporting, often it’s not the R. Kellys and the Harvey Weinsteins of the world,” he said, referring to two men who have been accused of rape or sexual abuse by many women, “but people who are abusing their power in more complex, but equally pernicious ways.” Follow the @ReaderCenter on Twitter for more coverage highlighting your perspectives and experiences and for insight into how we work.

5ca0debc49f0eacbf1f7afba,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/31/obituaries/david-white-dead.html,"David White, who formed the doo-wop quartet Danny and the Juniors in the mid-1950s, co-wrote their No. 1 hit “At the Hop” and composed their successful follow-up, “Rock and Roll Is Here to Stay,” died on March 16 in Las Vegas. He was 79. His daughter Wendy Adamczyk said the cause was lung and throat cancer. Like many other teenagers in the early days of rock ’n’ roll, Mr. White and his friends Danny Rapp, Frank Maffei and Joe Terranova (also known as Joe Terry), who called themselves the Juvenaires, harmonized in cars and school bathrooms. Their singing on a street corner in Philadelphia in 1957 attracted the attention of John Madara, then a 19-year-old singer, who heard them through his bedroom window. “The next day I asked some friends, ‘I heard this great group. Do you know who they are?’ And he said, ‘Yeah, that was Danny Rapp and the guys,’ ” Mr. Madara recalled in an interview in 2014 with Tom Meros for his online series “Tom TV.” Aware of Mr. Madara’s interest in the group, Mr. White found his way to Mr. Madara’s apartment, where they struck up a friendship and agreed to work together. Mr. Madara suggested they write a song that would play off teenagers dancing the bop on the television show “American Bandstand” and have an infectious beat like Jerry Lee Lewis’s recent rockabilly hit “Whole Lotta Shakin’ Goin’ On.”  With help from Artie Singer, a vocal coach and producer, they made a demo record, “Do the Bop,” with Mr. Madara singing lead and the Juvenaires singing backup. But when Mr. Singer and Mr. Madara brought the demo to Prep Records, it was rejected. “Artie took it to Dick Clark” — then a powerful Philadelphia disc jockey as well as the host of “American Bandstand” — “who suggested the title change to ‘At the Hop,’ ” Mr. White said in an interview in 2013 with the blog Milwaukee Opportunities. The group recorded a new version — only the lyrics needed to be changed — with Mr. Rapp singing lead. Mr. Clark agreed to play the song and gave it a huge boost in late 1957, when he had the group, now renamed Danny and the Juniors, on “Bandstand.” It leapt to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and stayed there for seven weeks. Hoping to repeat the success of “At the Hop,” Mr. White wrote “Rock and Roll Is Here to Stay” in early 1958 while touring with the group in Davenport, Iowa. It was not the hit “At the Hop” was — it peaked at No. 19 — but it acted as an enthusiastic rebuke to adults’ view of rock as a short-lived fad that tore at teenagers’ moral fiber. “Rock and roll is here to stay,” they sang. “It will never die/It was meant to be that way/Though I don’t know why.” David Ernest White was born on Nov. 26, 1939, in Philadelphia. When he was 3 he joined his parents, Frank and Marcia Tricker, in their acrobatic touring act, Barry and Brenda and Company. David showed an early interest in music; he began playing piano, clarinet and trombone in elementary school and was writing songs at 14. The Juvenaires, which Mr. White formed when he was about 15, sang at local parties and other events. Sometimes they practiced in Mr. White’s 1953 Pontiac so that they would not disturb the neighbors. Danny and the Juniors had a few modest hits after “At the Hop” and “Rock and Roll Is Here to Stay,” but none that kept them atop the charts. Mr. White left the group around 1961 and, in partnership with Mr. Madara, wrote many songs, including the Top 10 hits “The Fly” (1961), for Chubby Checker; “You Don’t Own Me” (1963), for Lesley Gore; and “1-2-3” (1965), for Len Barry. In 1965, Mr. White, Mr. Madara and Ray Gilmore formed a short-lived group, the Spokesmen, and together wrote a single, “The Dawn of Correction,” an optimistic corrective to Barry McGuire’s foreboding No. 1 hit, “Eve of Destruction.” It rose to No. 36 on the Hot 100. Mr. White found less success afterward. He broke up with Mr. Madara, released a solo album under the name David White Tricker, which did not do well; lived for a time in a trailer park; worked on various musical and film projects; and wrote a memoir that has not yet been published. He also collected royalties from filmmakers and advertisers eager to license songs from his archive, especially “At the Hop” and “Rock and Roll Is Here to Stay.” In the late 1960s, Mr. Rapp formed an all-new version of Danny and the Juniors, which toured the country; at one point he asked Mr. White to join him. While they never reunited, Mr. White sang a few songs with Mr. Rapp’s group at a lounge near Lake Tahoe in 1982. “He was real up, he was real excited about seeing me,” Mr. White told The Los Angeles Times in 1988. “I came very close to going back with him because he was working like crazy.” It was the last time they saw each other. Mr. Rapp died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in 1983. Mr. Terry and Mr. Maffei continued to perform occasionally as Danny and the Juniors, along with Mr. Maffei’s brother, Bob. In addition to Ms. Adamczyk, Mr. White is survived by his wife, Sandra (Simone) White; another daughter, Jody Conrad, and three grandchildren. A third daughter, Linda White, died in 2013. "
5c46d2743a125f5075c059a9,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/22/arts/music/tour-laundry-hans-juergen-topf.html,"BERLIN — One afternoon in November, Hans-Jürgen Topf walked through the backstage area of the Mercedes-Benz Arena, where dozens of crew members were unloading the equipment for the final stop of U2’s “Experience + Innocence” tour. After enthusiastically greeting and hugging several of the workers, Topf, 62, came to a sweltering room filled with humming washing machines and dryers. “This is my life,” he said. “The artists live their life, and I live my laundry life.” The world’s top specialist for tour laundry, Topf has traveled with many of the world’s biggest music acts, including Madonna, Pink and Beyoncé. As tours have become bigger and more professionalized, their logistics have become increasingly daunting. The U2 tour, which lasted about seven months and spanned two continents, included roughly 150 people, all of whom needed food, housing and clean clothes. That’s where “der Topf,” as he likes to call himself, comes in. His company, Rock ’n’ Roll Laundry, provides equipment and laundry staff for touring productions. Although Topf didn’t join the U2 tour because of a back injury, he was in Berlin to pick up machines he had rented to the crew. (He mostly stays within Germany these days, because of his back, but previous tours have taken him as far as South America and Australia.) “My reputation precedes me,” Topf said, adding that, in the music world, “nobody tackled the subject of laundry, nobody wanted to learn it, until I developed a system for it.” “He is a pioneer,” Jake Berry, the tour’s production director, said by phone. Twenty years ago, Berry said, most tour laundry had to be done quickly during tour stops at a local laundromat. He said the clothes would come back wet, or, “you’d find a girl’s thong in there.” In the early 2000s, Berry said, a “little man” — Topf — began appearing outside German venues with a van, offering to pick up, wash and return the production’s clothes. Berry said that the items were returned “pristine and folded.” Soon after that, he invited Topf to join him on tour. “It’s very hard to find someone who is passionate about laundry,” Berry added. “He is passionate.” [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] A few weeks after the U2 concert, Topf, who has a gray beard and wears metal-rimmed glasses, was in the basement at the Max-Schmeling-Halle, another venue in Berlin, helping his son Achim, 31, do laundry for Die Fantastischen Vier, a popular German rap act. The biggest challenge of doing tour laundry, Topf explained, was the volume, which can vary unpredictably, and the need to work without fixed facilities. He often had to work outside or wherever he could find running water, he said, including, at one point, in empty holding cells intended for disorderly fans in a South African stadium. “I know every disabled bathroom in every German football stadium,” he said. When he is on tour, Topf begins almost every day by washing the performers’ clothes, which usually have to be air-dried with a small fan. The most soiled garments he ever handled, he said, were coveralls worn by the metal band Slipknot that had been sprayed with beer, cream and fake blood, and left in garbage bags for three days. The most common stains on performers’ clothes, he said, were sweat and aluminum dust from truck ramps carried onstage by equipment-case wheels. The dust gets on the clothes when performers throw themselves on their knees or roll around onstage. The best solution, he said, was for crew members to put down mats: “It’s better for the pants.” Washing artists’ clothing involves high stakes. Topf recalled one incident, in which Joe Cocker grew furious after a discolored line appeared in pants that Topf had washed. “I haven’t forgotten that my whole life,” he said. He also once shrank a golden pair of pants that belonged to David Hasselhoff, and a mistake by a dry cleaner Topf had hired once ruined a $3,000 vest belonging to Janet Jackson, he said. But he is quick to point out that mishaps are rare: “Der Topf is mega-reliable.” When on tour, he often spends three to four hours every afternoon ironing the performers’ clothing, his least favorite part of the job, while simultaneously washing the crew’s garments. On some tours, he spends up to 20 hours a day doing laundry, he said. After a show, the machines go into specially built rolling cases, so they can be loaded onto trucks and brought to the next location. Topf pointed out that the touring business has become much more professional and business-oriented since he began. He used to find drugs in the clothes all the time, he said, adding, “These days, I’m more likely to find an herbal tea bag.” Joe Pomponio, a stage manager for numerous festivals in Europe who has worked frequently with Topf, said by phone that, for many acts that have spent years on the road, comforts like professionally done laundry have become vital. He added that he did not know anybody who offered services comparable to Topf’s, and that Rock ’n’ Roll Laundry was a fixture on the European festival circuit. “Der Topf is everywhere,” he said. Topf was born in 1956 to a family of East German refugees. In the communist G.D.R., his father worked as a smuggler, secreting people across the Iron Curtain in potato shipments. After he was caught by the East German secret police, Topf’s father escaped with his wife to Ludwigshafen, then in West Germany, where they founded a laundry. Topf is still based there. One evening in 1982, while making a delivery for his parents’ business, Topf noticed Ted Nugent’s tour bus, seemingly lost. After giving the driver directions, he was given free tickets to the concert, and later that evening, offered to clean the band’s clothes. When Nugent’s manager encouraged him to continue his services, he began standing outside concert venues “like a groupie” and offering same-day laundry services to visiting music acts, including Elton John and Blue Öyster Cult. He eventually bought a small truck, loaded in two washers and two dryers, and drove alongside touring bands. At night, he would sleep on top of his machines, doing laundry during the day for the Bee Gees, among others. Today, Topf’s business makes much of its income by renting out machines to touring productions, and it recently partnered with a businessman who has started an American version of Rock ’n’ Roll Laundry. Topf also runs a laundry business in Ludwigshafen catering to businesses and restaurants. The laundry in Ludwigshafen, he said, features an extensive collection of photographs of his favorite customers, including Phil Collins and Harry Belafonte. Topf said that Belafonte had signed his photo, “Thanks for taking the rocks out of my pants.” “I have no idea what that means,” Topf said, “but that’s the kind of thing you keep.” "
5cae0db549f0eacbf1f82589,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/10/arts/music/t-bone-burnett-invisible-light.html,"Joseph Henry Burnett, known as T Bone, has spent most of his long career in music behind the scenes. He has won 13 Grammy Awards as a producer, music supervisor and songwriter for albums including “Raising Sand” by Robert Plant and Alison Krauss and soundtracks for “O Brother, Where Are Thou?,” “Walk the Line,” “The Hunger Games” and “Crazy Heart,” which also brought him an Oscar for collaborating on the best original song. Lately his projects have included producing Sara Bareilles’s new album, composing and choosing the soundtrack for HBO’s “True Detective” and working on the debut of a country singer, Logan Ledger. But every so often, Burnett carves out time to record under his own name. This week he releases “The Invisible Light: Acoustic Space,” the first album of a planned trilogy he recorded with the keyboardist Keefus Ciancia and the drummer Jay Bellerose. On his own and in his collaborations, Burnett has become known for twangy, rootsy, naturalistic rock. But “The Invisible Light” veers into stranger territory. Drumbeats lurch and sputter amid eerie, amorphous electronic sounds; instruments like guitars or pianos are relegated to the far distance. In that setting, Burnett speak-sings his way through free-associative songs that contain biblical allusions, echoes of the blues, tall tales, lovers’ plaints and warnings about disinformation, the cult of personality and the encroachments of technology. (The trilogy’s next installment, Burnett said, “is more rocking, more punk rock, and the third edition gets very, very jazz, pretty out there.”) A conversation with Burnett, 71, easily wanders from musical particulars to philosophical speculations and back. He spoke from his home and studio in Los Angeles, where he makes most of his music; he had been awake, he said, since 4 a.m. The following are edited excerpts from the interview. The songs on “The Invisible Light” revolve around technology and theology, with some very dark tidings. I called it “The Invisible Light” for two reasons. It’s from T.S. Eliot’s “Choruses From ‘The Rock’” — he refers to divinity that way. But also, I’m actually optimistic about humanity’s chances, and in all this darkness some light is also contained. Except you have to really listen into it to hear the mirth and the optimism. You also name-check songs like Delbert McClinton’s “Victim of Life’s Circumstances.” The whole album is full of references, and that’s part of the notion of it. Because artists really do only one thing. Artists say, “I went to this place at this time and I saw this thing and it was good.” And we mark it, we mark the things that we think are important and worthwhile. The material isn’t exactly songs or spoken words. How did it come together? I started writing a play with Marshall Brickman, and the ambition for the play is to get it to Broadway one day. That led me to study Frank Loesser, and Lerner and Loewe, and Stephen Sondheim and all the great Broadway writers. Writing for theater is very different than just writing hillbilly songs or rock ’n’ roll songs. You only have a couple of hours to tell the story, and everything in the song has to be part of the narrative. It takes a great deal of discipline. And so I started getting up at 4 every morning and writing for several hours when everything was quiet. I finished writing the music for the play in about a year. But because I’d gotten in the habit of waking up at 4 in the morning and writing, I’ve continued doing that, for about the last three years. It’s this evolving poem that must be about 5,000 lines now, which I would guess someday I will publish as a poem. That became the sheet music in essence. I would pull a group of lyrics out of this stuff and give it to Keefus and give it to Jay, and we would just start jamming. Melody is really codified inflection. In all of the lyrics there were melodies already hanging around in them, ghost melodies, and some were specific melodies. It’s maybe a form of Beat poetry. I certainly still think of myself as part of the Beat Generation. One song, “A Man Without a Country,” ends with two full minutes of ambient landscape sound, almost silent. Why? One could think of this album as a film that hasn’t been made that we’re scoring. Part of what we’re after is the fact that the electronic universe has been shrinking and fragmenting our attention spans for decades now. I want to create periods of time where people can just sit in pure sound without stimulation, where we can allow ourselves to relax into pure sound. It’s not really that nothing’s happening. It’s something’s happening but we don’t know what it is, so to speak. Musicians praise the drum sound in your productions, and drums are way up front on this album. What’s the secret? There was a time in the 1970s when everybody was dampening down drums and trying to take all the overtones out and focus purely on attack. But all of the most interesting sounds of the drums are the sounds of the overtones that react with one another and create other melodies and other rhythms within the piece. Which are the very things that get covered up by the guitars and the basses and the more normal instruments that are brought forward in a mix. By taking all those away you’re able to hear what the drums actually are doing. We do it by playing very, very softly so that the attack is minimized. The trick, if it’s a trick, or the technique since it is technology, is to place the microphones so that they hear all of the tone and the overtones of the drums and then they also hear the tone and overtones of the adjacent drums. The room we’re recording all these pieces in is a very small bedroom, so you can only play so loud. Yet the sound of the tracks suggests huge spaces. That is the idea, to conjure these open, wild spaces. We wanted it to be an indefinable place, a dangerous place, a dark place, yet within it there’s all this life. There are also a lot of warnings: about a “celebrity-in-chief,” about lies and willful self-deception. There’s an extraordinary experiment in behavioral modification going on now. We live in a time now where leaders emerge from fiction and create the politics of eternity where there are no facts. That’s an extremely dangerous place to live. The “politics of eternity” is from Timothy Snyder’s “The Road to Unfreedom.” I think it’s the most important book of the 21st century so far. It’s a well of sanity. Do you think about who your listeners are? No, other than that the listeners are human beings and I have a love and a caring for humanity, and I hope that comes through. This is anti-anti-human music. There’s a lot going on in the world that is anti-human at the moment, and this is fighting that. Art has to be irresistible. It can’t be pedantic or instruct or preach. I certainly have been accused of preaching in the past, and I hope I’ve overcome any tendencies I’ve had in that direction. More than preaching I’ve been raising the alarm. Hopefully I’ve gotten good enough at it so that I’m not preaching, but just ringing the bell. "
5c881f6449f0eacbf105cb55,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/12/arts/music/hal-blaine-drummer-songs.html,"Hal Blaine, who died on Monday at 90, was the greatest and most prolific session drummer during the turbulent Sixties crescendo from pop to psychedelia, keeping the nation’s heartbeat through dozens of No. 1 hits during the Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon administrations. His résumé included ambitious art-rock totems, easy listening schmaltz, TV theme songs, incendiary folk-rock, Phil Spector’s “wall of sound” and Steely Dan’s smooth softscapes. His beats backed a hall of fame of mid-20th century icons, including Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley, the Beach Boys, the Supremes, Simon and Garfunkel, Sam Cooke, Barbra Streisand, Herb Alpert, John Denver and Leonard Cohen. But his most legendary beat is the primordial thump-thump-thump-crack heartbeat in the first four seconds of the Ronettes’ “Be My Baby.” Here’s just a fraction of what Blaine tapped into musical history. The first Phil Spector production that Blaine — the drummer for the producer’s Wrecking Crew session band — drove to No. 1. In the final 30 seconds, you can hear Blaine exploding outward from his steady pulse into a frenzy. “Phil Spector, God bless him, used to let me just go nuts on records,” Blaine told Modern Drummer. “I would go totally bananas on the endings of those songs. Phil has always said that he was going to take all the fades and put them together and put out some records of that.” Blaine wagered the creation of one of the most iconic opening drum beats of all time was “unintentional.” “Be My Baby” was possibly intended to have snare beats breaking up the pulse on 2 and 4 instead of just the big wallop at the end. In any event, its influence can be felt in the many songs that used similar beats in its wake: Billy Joel’s “Say Goodbye to Hollywood,” the Boys’ “Brickfield Nights,” the Jesus and Mary Chain’s “Just Like Honey,” Poison’s “Cry Tough” and Bat for Lashes’ “What’s a Girl to Do” among them. Blaine would eventually be known for his steady backbeats, but he can be heard playing wild fills all over this soul classic. “That was another one with that same drum lick every eight or 16 bars, whatever it was,” Blaine told NPR. “And all these drum licks kind of became the standard for rock ’n’ roll. You know, all the drummers that I’ve spoken with through the years have told me that they grew up listening to the records that I played on, and that’s how they learned.” Naturally, the Who’s Keith Moon was a fan, as was the Rush drummer Neil Peart. “When I was growing up, I played along to the radio,” Peart said in 2011, “so I played along to Simon and Garfunkel, the Beach Boys, the Association and the Byrds, and I was really playing along to Hal Blaine.”  The producer Terry Melcher wasn’t sold on the instrumental prowess of the Byrds so it was the Wrecking Crew session team that anchored the song most responsible for the advent of “folk rock.” Blaine’s brushes on the snare are nuanced and dynamic, but the real iconic element of “A Taste of Honey” is his four-on-the-floor bass drum. This was another happy accident. Blaine said the band was coming in “like a train wreck,” so he provided a pulse. It became the most memorable part of the song. The Beach Boy Mike Love wrote of his bandmate Brian Wilson: “When we’d go to Brian’s house, he would play [“Be My Baby”] over and over again, comparing it to Einstein’s theory of relativity.” Inspired by Spector’s wall of sound techniques, Wilson created “Good Vibrations,” a single that was epochal for its orchestral ambitions, studio-as-instrument techniques and early embrace of electronic music via the whining Electro-Theremin. Who better to anchor it to pop than one of Spector’s drummers of choice? “My particular sound for Brian,” Blaine wrote in his autobiography, “was basically the Phil Spector sound with a few minor changes. … Afterwards, I would overdub percussion effects. I was invited to experiment, and I don’t ever remember Brian telling me not to play anything.” Though this chamber-pop song is mostly forgotten, it still knocked the Monkees’ “Last Train to Clarksville” out of the No. 1 spot in late 1966. Blaine’s high-hat work here — opening, striking, then closing for a pssssshp — has been credited by Drum magazine as integral for moving the sizzling sound from jazz to rock. It has since became a bedrock element of dance music. Blaine plays drums on four of Simon and Garfunkel’s five studio albums, providing the tasteful accompaniment on No. 1 singles “Mrs. Robinson” and “Bridge Over Troubled Water.” But check out the apocalyptic Top 20 hit “A Hazy Shade of Winter,” first released in 1966 before appearing on the 1968 album “Bookends,” for a missing link between Motown and punk rock. Blaine’s work with Nancy Sinatra would yield bigger hits — most notably “These Boots Are Made for Walkin’” and the duet with her father “Somethin’ Stupid,” both No. 1 hits. But this papa-was-a-rolling-stone single allowed the consummate sideman to stretch his legs (and arms) with monstrous tom-tom fills. Blaine brought a massive drum kit to accompany Sinatra for her performance on 1971 TV special “Movin’ With Nancy on Stage.” “I did a solo on the show, which was the first time anyone ever saw that set, so everybody just went crazy,” Blaine told Modern Drummer. “I gave it all to Ludwig. I expected them to call it the Hal Blaine super set or something. But they called it the Octoplus, and it was one of their biggest sellers.” Looped to play three times, Blaine’s funky opening beat (and Jim Gordon’s percussion) on this Monkees classic was the first thing you heard on the first volume of Ultimate Breaks and Beats, the record series that served as an essential D.J. and producer tool in the 1980s. Twenty years after it was recorded, Blaine would end up the unwitting participant in hip-hop records like Run-D.M.C.’s “Mary Mary” (1988), De La Soul’s “Change in Speak” (1989) and Big Daddy Kane’s “Pimpin’ Ain’t Easy.” A song at the crossroads of psychedelia, soul, pop and Broadway, Blaine moves from a deconstructed “Be My Baby,” to locomotive rock to groovy funk. Proving himself ever versatile, Blaine’s last era of chart success and prolific session work was during the late Seventies and early Eighties explosion of pop-country artists like Shelly West (“Jose Cuervo”), John Denver (“I’m Sorry,” “Thank God I’m a Country Boy”) and era-appropriate works by Emmylou Harris and Johnny Cash. On Tanya Tucker’s “Lizzie and the Rainman” — a No. 1 country hit and a Top 40 pop crossover — Tucker says “beat the drum” in the middle of each chorus and Blaine plays a bonkers descending drum fill that pans across the speakers. It sounds like it was pulled from a Rush record instead of something that broke the Adult Contemporary chart. "
5c9fcf6349f0eacbf19fb3e5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/30/arts/music/rolling-stones-mick-jagger.html,"The Rolling Stones said on Saturday that Mick Jagger required medical treatment for an unspecified health problem and that the band would postpone its spring tour in the United States and Canada. Jagger’s doctors advised him not to go on the remaining 17 shows of the tour but expected him to make a “complete recovery,” according to a statement from the band. Jagger, 75, apologized to fans. “I really hate letting you down like this,” he said in a tweet. “I’m devastated for having to postpone the tour but I will be working very hard to be back on stage as soon as I can.” The band, which got its start more than five decades ago, performed the first two legs of its “No Filter” tour in Europe during fall 2017 and spring 2018. The final leg of the tour was scheduled to take the band through American cities including Miami, Houston, Denver and Chicago, as well as a venue north of Toronto. The Stones were scheduled to play at New Orleans Jazz Festival in May. The statement from the band suggested that the shows would be rescheduled and recommended that fans hold on to their tickets. Jagger is not the first 1960s-era music icon to show signs of slowing down in old age. In February, the rock guitarist Peter Frampton announced that he had a degenerative muscle disease that could slow his fingers and his ability to move around; he said he would be staging a farewell tour. And last year, two major figures in the ’60s folk revival, Paul Simon and Joan Baez, played farewell concerts. John Covach, a professor of music at the University of Rochester who has taught a course on the band, said that because the Stones remain a rock institution, they had been able to tour as much as they wanted in recent years and still pack stadiums and arenas. But these demanding and exhausting international tours can take a toll. “Who can tour around the country when they’re 70 or 75 years old?” he said on Saturday. He said that for avid fans of the Stones or other landmark ’60s bands, many of whom are baby boomers, news of farewell tours and rock stars dying of natural causes can remind them of their own mortality. “It forces a lot of fans to come to terms with the fact that this music from their youth, the people who produced it, are passing from the scene,” he said.

Using an internet-first approach, Eilish has amassed a powerful teen following by adhering only to her most specific, and often strangest, musical whims, earning more than a billion total song streams already, before the release of her debut album last Friday. Her songs mix elements of electronic pop and hip-hop with an alternative bent, and are written and recorded solely with her older brother Finneas, 21, usually in the small bedrooms of their parents’ Los Angeles home. But “Bury a Friend,” one of Eilish’s darkest and most successful songs to date, came together from more disparate sources, including a rare visit to a proper studio and a dentist’s chair, where Eilish captured the horrendous whirring of a drill that was later added to the track. Despite its horror-movie sound effects, odd structure and nightmare lyrics, “Bury a Friend” peaked this year at No. 14 on the Billboard Hot 100, and its grisly video has been viewed more than 100 million times. The song is also currently rising at alt-rock radio, as Eilish ascends to further mainstream heights with her first full-length, “When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?,” which is dominating streaming services and expected to hit No. 1 on next week’s album chart. In the video above, featuring a cameo from the siblings’ mother, Maggie, see how Eilish and her brother are reinventing teen-pop stardom with tracks like “Bury a Friend.” “Diary of a Song” pulls back the curtain on how pop music is made today, using archival material — voice memos, demo versions, text messages, emails, interviews and more — to tell the story behind the track.

5c3f8d473a125f5075c04c4e,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/16/books/review/birth-of-loud-ian-port.html,"THE BIRTH OF LOUD Leo Fender, Les Paul, and the Guitar-Pioneering Rivalry That Shaped Rock ’n’ Roll By Ian S. Port Illustrated. 340 pp. Scribner. $28. Like a lot of paradigm-shifting inventions, the solid-body electric guitar seems inevitable in hindsight. Someone was bound to realize that a steel string could be hugely amplified by a magnetic pickup and an external speaker, blasting an electronic signal. Someone was bound to come up with a design that felt familiar and comfortable to a working musician. And someone would certainly figure out how to manufacture the instrument as an affordable mass-market commodity. But the actual advent of the solid-body electric guitar, sometime in the 1940s, was a tangled tale of tinkerers, craftsmen, musicians and businessmen who hardly realized what they had unleashed. In “The Birth of Loud,” Ian S. Port, a critic and guitarist who was the music editor for The San Francisco Weekly, has sorted out the facts of the electric guitar’s much-mythologized genesis and cultural conquest. He turns them into a hot-rod joy ride through mid-20th-century American history. With appropriately flashy prose, he dismantles some misconceptions and credits some nearly forgotten but key figures. He also summons, exuberantly and perceptively, the look, sound and sometimes smell of pivotal scenes and songs. Port frames his scrupulously sourced narrative with two thoroughly disparate characters who converged on the same idea and have archetypal guitars bearing their names: Les Paul and Leo Fender. “Their personalities and worlds were as far apart as any in music could be: One’s arena was primarily the stage, the other’s, the workbench,” Port writes. Clarence Leo Fender was a perpetually rumpled, unassuming, self-taught radio repairman, an intuitive engineer and non-musician who decided to build guitars and amplifiers. “His enjoyment of the instrument,” Port writes, “stemmed from the precise pattern of harmonics produced by its strings. Where others heard music, Leo Fender heard physics.” Lester Polsfuss, a.k.a. Les Paul, was a world-class guitarist and self-promoting showman who was also a technological visionary, fascinated by electronics and studio production. “Les Paul wrestled with the knowledge that even being a virtuoso on the guitar would not bring the fame he craved,” Port writes. “Les now began to see his guitar playing as one element in a larger project: a whole new sound that would combine his brilliant musicianship, the pure electric guitar tone he wanted, and radical new recording techniques he envisioned.” The electric guitar was no single individual’s invention. Amplified guitars had appeared in the early 1930s, when companies including Gibson and Rickenbacker put pickups inside acoustic guitars to play them through amplifiers. Yet beyond a certain volume, amplified sound waves bouncing around inside a traditional guitar’s hollow body would create screaming feedback. But that problem had been solved by a different instrument: the Hawaiian or steel guitar, distilled down to just strings, a neck and pickups heard through an amplifier. They were played horizontally, as a lap steel guitar, or built into a tabletop with pitch-shifting pedals as country music’s pedal steel guitar. Concentrating on Fender and Paul, Port mentions but doesn’t explore the groundbreaking solid-body lap steel guitar sold by Rickenbacker in the early 1930s or other short-lived, solid-body six-string guitar progenitors. In the mid-1940s, Fender turned his radio repair shop into the Fender Electric Instrument Company, manufacturing steel guitars and amplifiers. Both he and Paul had been thinking about a solid-body electric guitar. Les Paul built one for himself in 1940 out of a 4-by-4 plank and an existing guitar neck. He called it “the Log,” performed with it (adding the sides of a guitar body) and brought it to the Gibson company in the early 1940s as a potential product. “After Les left,” Port writes, “the managers chortled among themselves about that crazy guitar player who wanted Gibson to build a broomstick with pickups on it.” In 1943 Fender and a collaborator put pickups on a solid oak plank and shaped it like a narrow little guitar. They built only one rough model, but for years they rented it out steadily to local musicians who loved the amplified sound. It was, Port writes, “a misfit stepchild of a guitar that extended creative expression past what any other standard model allowed.” Neither Fender nor Paul got past his prototype until the 1950s. While Fender struggled to keep his existing factory in business, Paul was thriving as a musician, backing Bing Crosby and others. Paul had turned his Hollywood garage into a home studio: a magnet for musicians and a place to experiment with recording technique. At Les Paul’s studio, Fender, Paul, and a designer and meticulous custom-instrument craftsman named Paul Bigsby brainstormed a solid-body guitar, consulting with musicians. One was the country music star Merle Travis, a Bigsby client. Travis dared the designer to build him a thin, solid-body electric, sketching it in detail. Bigsby built it in 1948. Fender studied it, but knew it was too luxurious. He came up with something simpler, eliminating fine woodworking and its sculptural glued-on neck; his neck was bolted on and easily replaceable, for a guitar that could be manufactured, affordable and practical. “This was the leap from classical design to modernism; from the age of walnut to the age of celluloid; from the America of brick-and-iron cities to the America of stucco-and-glass suburbs,” Port writes. Fender unveiled a solid-body six-string in 1950 and was backlogged with orders by 1951. That was the year Paul’s pop career skyrocketed. In a duo with his wife, the singer and guitarist Mary Ford, Paul used his multitrack studio to create giddy, futuristic, chart-topping versions of standards like “How High the Moon.” The venerable Gibson company had quietly been developing its own solid-body guitar, with a more elegant shape, advanced pickups and smoother sound than the twangy Fender Telecaster. Although Paul didn’t design it — a myth Gibson cultivated — he tweaked it slightly and lent his mad-scientist credibility to the Les Paul Model, Gibson’s first solid-body electric guitar. Meanwhile, Fender came up with the Stratocaster, a curvy, seductive shape contoured to a player’s body. The competition was on, joined by other companies. Leo Fender had another far-reaching idea, introduced in 1952: an electric bass guitar that was far more portable, louder and crisper than a classic bass fiddle. And as rock ’n’ roll took over popular music, he met the demand for bigger, louder amps — including one that deafened him in one ear while he was repairing it for the surf-rock guitarist Dick Dale — and for effects, like reverb, that separated the electric guitar even further from its acoustic ancestors. Musicians took it from there. Electric guitars increasingly defined rock ’n’ roll, driving out pianos and horn sections. Guitarists cranked up and dirtied up the clean, warm sounds that Fender and Paul had tried to engineer; Jimi Hendrix embraced feedback with a vengeance. (His 1969 Woodstock Festival rendition of “The Star-Spangled Banner” gets its own, climactic chapter of Port’s book.) The synergy of guitars, amplifiers and effects spawned new idioms, while manufacturers’ profits rose and fell with hit makers’ equipment choices. The latter part of “The Birth of Loud” juxtaposes breakthroughs by musicians — Muddy Waters, Eric Clapton, Hendrix, the electric bass players Carol Kaye and James Jamerson — with the up-and-down individual and corporate fortunes of Fender and Paul. Fender sold his company in the mid-1960s, but kept tinkering with other companies. Paul saw his pop style eclipsed by rock ’n’ roll and his namesake Gibson model discontinued, only to have his guitar resuscitated by British blues-rockers and his playing eventually cherished by jazz fans. In the digital era, guitars no longer rule popular music. Port recognizes that Paul left another, perhaps larger legacy: He was “the first player to claim the studio as an instrument, a move so common today that we often forget to remark on it. Les aimed to control not only the music that went onto the canvas of recorded sound, but everything about the canvas itself: the framing, the immaculateness of the background, the depth and layering of the sounds, and where it hung on the viewer’s wall.” But “The Birth of Loud” rightfully celebrates an earlier time, when wood, steel, copper wire, microphones and loudspeakers could redefine reality. Tracing material choices that echoed through generations, the book captures the quirks of human inventiveness and the power of sound. "

The same could be said of music. In uncertain times, it is often musicians who are quickest and best able to express our underlying anxieties, and their work is stronger for it. Accordingly, we asked four artists, Stephen Malkmus, Kelsey Lu, Bonnie “Prince” Billy and Meg Baird to write and record original songs that meditate on the theme of America in 2024. Each artist took this prompt in a different direction. From the distorted techno of Malkmus’s track “Airplane Air,” which he envisages as something that might, in the future, be played “on pirate radio in a police state,” to the mournful psych-rock strains of Baird’s song “1,000 Goodbyes x 100 Hellos,” in which she asks, in her words, “whether we can trade our collective environmental, social and economic anxieties for action,” listen to the four tracks below.

5ca60e4249f0eacbf1f80e24,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/04/theater/titus-andronicus.html,"A Shakespeare play is a dangerous place. Swords can kill you. So can poison, grief and bears. Eleven corpses crowd the stage in “Richard III.” “King Lear” does away with 10 characters. But at 14 deaths, “Titus Andronicus” — with its beheadings, live burial and disgustful approach to pastry-making — takes the Shakespearean cake. T.S. Eliot called “Titus Andronicus” “one of the stupidest and most uninspired plays ever written.” That doesn’t mean it hasn’t inspired others. The image of a mother made to eat her children was hard to shake, and a couple of decades after its 1594 premiere, artists had already begun to appropriate — O.K., fine, cannibalize — its plot for uses comic, tragic and savagely satirical. Directors have staged it with almost no gore and with nothing but gore. It has been modernized, musicalized, performed by puppets and adapted to Kabuki. Stephen K. Bannon sent it into space. Its blood has spattered everything from bootleg Dutch tragedies to Japanese anime to “Game of Thrones.” “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt” gifted us the character Titus Andromedon, played by Tituss Burgess. (His rival: Coriolanus Burt.) Now comes Taylor Mac’s “Gary: A Sequel to Titus Andronicus,” which picks up, figuratively and literally, after the final murders. It opens on April 21 at Broadway’s Booth Theater. But before audiences tally whether Mac outdoes Shakespeare on the body count, let’s look back at some of the play’s more memorable appearances in culture, pop and otherwise. In the mid 19th century, the African-American actor Ira Aldridge and the English playwright C.A. Somerset collaborated on a new version that transformed Aaron, a Moor and the lover of the barbarian queen Tamora, from villain to hero, subverting racial stereotype. Aldridge and Somerset cut out most of the carnage and interpolated at least one scene from a contemporary melodrama that Aldridge had also starred in. Aldridge’s opinion: “I will venture to say that there is not a play on the stage with a more powerful climax.” A Scottish critic praised Aldridge’s performance as Aaron as “remarkable for energy, tempered by dignity and discretion.” A British horror comedy beloved of theater reviewers and the people who hate them. “Theater of Blood” stars Vincent Price as Edward Kendal Sheridan Lionheart, a depraved classical actor, bad in every sense. After faking his death Lionheart revenges himself on his critics, with murders inspired by Shakespeare. After executing six critics and convincing a seventh to kill his wife Othello-style, Lionheart turns to “Titus Andronicus” to snuff the eighth. Meredith Merridew (Robert Morley), who refers to his poodles as babies, is invited onto a cooking show and served a pie. No prizes for guessing the filling. Lionheart suffocates him with the crust. Stephen Sondheim’s Tony-winning chiller, written with Hugh Wheeler, doesn’t directly descend from Shakespeare. An adaptation of Christopher Bond’s 1973 play, its key source is a gristly 19th-century penny dreadful, “The String of Pearls: A Romance,” which describes a homicidal barber and the baker Mrs. Lovett, his unsavory accomplice. Still, the revenge plot, with its abductions and threats of rape, echoes “Titus Andronicus” and the use of human mincemeat as the symbol of ultimate inhumanity smacks of homage. As Mrs. Lovett sings, “It’s man devouring man, my dear/And who are we to deny it here.” Heiner Müller, the experimental German playwright who specialized in grimly absurdist Shakespeare rewrites, refashioned “Titus Andronicus” as a postmodern, postcolonial debauch. His version lays bare the violence of the original (arguably pretty bare already) while reframing it as a political allegory of how wealthier nations exploit impoverished ones. Drawing on the 1973 Chilean coup and a divided Berlin, Müller explores the failure of culture and human progress to make the world a less brutalized place. As one character says, “Poetry is murder.” Before Mr. Bannon became Donald J. Trump’s chief strategist, he fell for another populist leader, albeit one with more military experience: Titus. The play obsessed him and in the early ’90s, he and the screenwriter Julia Jones collaborated on an interplanetary adaptation of “Titus Andronicus.” Here, Titus is the leader of the Andronicii, incorporeal beings who come to earth and take on human form. Shakespeare never included erotic scenes of ectoplasmic sex. Mr. Bannon did. Shockingly, studios passed. He and Ms. Jones also rewrote “Coriolanus” as a rap musical set during the Los Angeles riots. Though Mr. Bannon’s space guignol wouldn’t fly, he is listed as an executive producer on Julie Taymor’s 1999 film version of the tragedy, which reset the play in a Rome both ancient and modern. Anthony Hopkins said that his Titus referenced both King Lear and Hannibal Lecter, another character with outré taste in fine dining. Reviews were generally positive, with a Times critic writing that the movie “makes the best possible argument for a cautionary drama that contemplates the absolute worst in us.” But not only Rome loses big in “Titus.” The movie cost $25 million and made back just $2 million at the box office. In the 69th episode of “South Park,” a middle schooler, Scott Tenorman, convinces Cartman to buy his pubic hair. When his friends set Cartman straight on how puberty actually works, Cartman asks for his money back. Then he vows revenge. After various plans fail, including one involving guest stars Radiohead, Cartman arranges for the murder of Scott’s parents, lures Scott to a Chile Con Carnival and feeds him a dastardly bowl of chili. “Nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah, I made you eat your parents,” Cartman gloats. Founded in 2005, Titus Andronicus, which now styles itself +@, is a post-punk Brooklyn outfit led by Patrick Stickles. The name celebrates Shakespeare’s crowd-pleasing appeal and if serving a mother the pastry-encased corpses of her children isn’t punk rock, I mean what even is? The band’s first song on their debut album, 2008’s “The Airing of Grievances,” quotes liberally from Aaron’s Act V speech. Their fourth album, 2015’s “The Lamentable Tragedy,” a 29-song rock opera about Mr. Stickles’s manic depression, name-checks the “Titus Andronicus” title page in the 1623 folio, though honestly quarto editions are way more rock ’n’ roll.

5c51e5ad3a125f5075c07251,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/30/arts/music/cherry-glazerr-stuffed-and-ready-review.html,"Clementine Creevy, the songwriter, singer and guitarist who leads Cherry Glazerr, has unabashedly grown up in public, claiming allegiances and postures on the way to finding herself. On the band’s third album, that means having far more quandaries than answers but making the struggles mean something. As a teenager, Creevy was a proud representative of a do-it-yourself Los Angeles rock scene, which had somehow preserved the scrappy idealism of the punk era from decades before she was born. Now, 22 years old and three albums into a career that has also included television exposure (with a recurring role leading the band Glitterish on “Transparent”) and modeling (for the designer Emma Mulholland), she sounds less guarded and more direct than ever, owning up to confusion and insecurity even as her guitar riffs counterattack. On Cherry Glazerr’s “Apocalipstick,” in 2017, she juggled misgivings alongside bravado, sass and bohemian solidarity in songs like “Trash People” and “Told You I’d Be With the Guys.” But with the band’s new “Stuffed & Ready,” she is decidedly on her own. “I don’t wanna try to pretend like I know what’s happening,” she sings in “Stupid Fish,” one of the album’s grungy manifestoes, then adds, “Maybe I’m mad ‘cause I see myself in you.” [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] Creevy was 15 when she uploaded home-recorded songs to SoundCloud in 2012, under the name Clembutt. They caught the attention of the independent label Burger, which initially released them on the cassette “Papa Cremp” in 2013. The band remade some of those first songs for Cherry Glazerr’s official debut album, “Haxel Princess” in 2014, followed by the more professionally produced “Apocalipstick” and now “Stuffed & Ready.” The band lineup has changed around her with each album; there’s no question who’s in charge. While Creevy’s music has stayed grounded in 1980s and 1990s alternative rock — bands like the Breeders, Siouxsie and the Banshees and the Cure — she has expanded her sounds and dynamics with each album. Live, Cherry Glazerr is a guitar-bass-drums trio, but in the studio, the band uses layers of guitars and occasional dollops of synthesizer to make each song evolve from within: fragile or eerie at one moment, ironclad the next. Creevy’s voice is high and thin but determined, and bolstered by the studio; her melodies take unexpected, angular leaps, while her guitar parts underline her solitude or blast it away. Throughout the album, the songs negotiate intimacy and independence, responsibility and personal needs. In “Daddi,” she grapples with her own reflex of deferring to a man. The verses are high, hesitant, whispery lines — “Where should I go Daddi/What should I say” — but a drum stomp and a blaring guitar take over for the chorus: “Don’t hold my hand, don’t be my man.” She worries about her cultural role in “That’s Not My Real Life,” a barreling punk rocker: “The suits, they don’t want me to go/They just want me to bear it all for all the women.” At the album’s midpoint, she slows down to ballad speed and guiltily craves time for herself in “Self Explained” and “Isolation.” But by the end, she’s back in the fray. In “Distressor,” she moves from home and seclusion — hollow, circular guitar-picking patterns — to the powerful mask of performing onstage: “I just wanna drown in my own noise,” she sings, with a drumbeat looming under her voice and, soon, a titanic, heaving guitar riff. At the end, she’s shouting: “So I can just be!” "
5ca4f79849f0eacbf1f80a6f,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/03/arts/music/khalid-free-spirit-review.html,"With his 2017 debut, “American Teen,” Khalid (whose last name is Robinson) arrived as a teenager from El Paso, speaking for fellow teens, with a peer group of “young dumb broke high school kids” — a little proud, a little humble and mostly just dazedly matter-of-fact. With his long-breathed croon floating over unassuming low-fi production, he sang about circumscribed but smartphone-connected lives, misfiring romances and looming life choices. The immediacy of his melodies, the Everyteen sensibility of his lyrics and the direct yearning in his voice quickly found a wide audience. More than a billion streams, five Grammy nominations (though no wins) and a 2018 EP (“Suncity”) later, Khalid’s second full-length album, “Free Spirit,” grapples with a more singular, more isolated experience: coming to terms with fame, wealth, broader horizons and lingering insecurity. “Is this heaven or Armageddon?” he wonders in “Free Spirit.” He has moved from “we” to “I.” The music cushions his unease. It’s a generous album — 17 songs — that rolls along smoothly for nearly an hour, one leisurely midtempo groove after another, while Khalid’s voice conveys far more longing than agitation. He has upper-echelon producers now (among them John Hill, Digi, Charlie Handsome and Hit-Boy), and he’s separating himself from the twitchy, narrow-band approach of the SoundCloud rap crowd. He’s also learning from R&B’s more distant past. On the new album, Khalid embraces a fuller sound that often harks back to the 1980s and 1990s, with pillowy synthesizers, tickling guitars and multiple layers of his own vocal harmonies. In “Self,” Khalid strives to balance self-doubt — “The man that I’ve been running from is inside of me” — and self-preservation; the track, produced by Hit-Boy, lurches forward on a boom-bap beat and surrounds Khalid with glimmering keyboards and echoey vocals. In “Twenty One” — his current age — Khalid woos someone while he confesses his own turmoil: “I’m in pain/But I’m to blame/To end this fight/I have to change.” Yet there are handclaps, pop-rock guitars and layered vocals to bolster him and make sure he gets through. Success hasn’t made Khalid sleazy or arrogant. He doesn’t take partners for granted; he also understands the pop potential of respectful flirting. “Talk,” produced and co-written by the English duo Disclosure, is a male analogue of Janet Jackson’s “Let’s Wait Awhile,” telling an eager partner that slowing things down a little will bring them closer. “Can’t we just talk/figure out where we’re going,” Khalid requests, ever so politely, as syncopated synthesizers tick and blip around him. “Better,” which includes production by the Norwegian duo Stargate, celebrates the sensual bliss of a secret affair: “Just hold me in the dark/No one’s gotta know what we do,” he urges, amid floating piano chords and a swirl of his own naturalistic and sampled vocals. “Nothing feels better than this,” he exults. But Khalid can’t stay cocooned in romance. For much of the album, he’s out on his own, coping with internal anxieties and external pressures. On “American Teen” he had high school classmates who shared his fun and frustrations; on “Free Spirit,” they’ve been replaced by business associates with their own motives. “Bad Luck” glides along on gently ticking drums and a lacework of guitars, distantly suggesting Marvin Gaye’s “Sexual Healing,” yet it’s anything but reassuring. All Khalid sees around him is shallowness and duplicity: “No one really means it when they’re wishing you well/I got no one to call, no one/and people only love you when they’re needing your wealth,” he sings in a sweet, sad falsetto. And in “Hundred,” he marches through countless obligations and glances at the dubious “friends” who surround him: “Everybody wants a favor, everybody needs me/But I’m too busy trying to fight away all of my demons.” He doesn’t conquer those demons on “Free Spirit”; nor does he succumb to them. Instead, he suspends them in melody and rhythm, recognizing them and staring them down. He doesn’t pretend to be a hero or an antihero — just a young man alone, trying to get through life with some honest grace. "
5c4303333a125f5075c0545b,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/19/style/emo-metal-rock-music-nigeria.html,"the look Rock music fans have emerged from the digital underground in Nigeria. Photographs by Jan Hoek and Stephen Tayo Text by Edwin Okolo Produced by Eve Lyons LAGOS, Nigeria — Rock music is often produced and enjoyed under the pressure of social constraints, and the restrictive culture of post-dictatorial Nigeria made for a perfect cooker. In the 1990s and 2000s, teenagers who rejected the country’s politics of restraint in dress, physical appearance and behavior embraced American punk and metal imports.  Footage of Western concertgoers dancing in defiance of any discernible rhythm, alone in a throng of bodies, moving with careless abandon to music, presented a possible escape. Many of these young Nigerians first encountered bands beloved by early 2000s emo kids — Linkin Park, Evanescence, Paramore, Fall Out Boy — online and, through the exchange of music, formed a digital community. They called themselves “Gothics,” shorthand for a composite of binding beliefs and aesthetics from different rock subgenres, including dark clothing, severe makeup and an obsession with death. “The scene’s true beginnings are the MySpace groups from the early 2000s,” said Cheyi Okoaye, 30, who runs the music website Audio Inferno. “MySpace used to let you create and save these playlists, and many of us would sleep over in cyber cafes just to discover new bands.” In the last decade, Nigeria’s Gothics have taken their act offline. Each year they congregate at Rocktoberfest, the only festival in Nigeria dedicated to rock and alternative music. It has become a crucial meeting place for members of the country’s underground rock community. “I’m grounded,” said Kaego Odiah, a 19-year-old student at the University of Lagos who had come to Freedom Park in Lagos for the festival. “I snuck out of the house because I had to be here.” Rocktoberfest presents a rare opportunity for fans to dress un-self-consciously in their gothic uniform of funereal black. At the smaller but more frequent sing-off parties held in karaoke bars around the city, for example, many Gothics come straight from their day jobs, still in dress shirts and ties, and try to avoid meeting anyone they know from their lives outside the community. “We want to take rock music mainstream. That’s why we have the festival,” said Lekan Dada, 30, the co-founder of RockNation Nigeria, which produces the festival and promotes rock bands. “Radio stations are reluctant to play rock music. Nigerian cable stations dedicate one hour a week to rock. If we are going to make this mainstream, we need to create our own ecosystem.” Music has long underpinned Nigerian oral histories, worship songs, state ceremonies and other speech acts. But these traditional songs encourage the expression of joy and hope, and rarely fear, doubt or despair. In rock music, young Nigerians found their range of emotions reflected: Anger, loneliness, grief and insecurity could exist alongside rapture. Some Nigerians have made spreading the gospel of rock music their life’s work. The influx of American rock inspired Nigerian bands with similar sounds, including the Isomers, an alternative rock band reminiscent of Kings of Leon; 1 Last Autograph, whose metalcore sound harks back to Avenged Sevenfold; and Mimido, whose music has Christian rock influences.  Mr. Okoaye’s website Audio Inferno publishes music reviews and interviews of rock bands across Africa. And through RockNation Nigeria, Mr. Dada creates spaces for fans to congregate offline. Meeting up in person has helped Gothics assimilate without diluting their dark style. Henry Uche, who calls himself a vampire and prefers the name GothicHenri, dresses in all black and ties his looks together with chains, studs and a pentagram necklace. He believes that by incorporating a few gothic visual elements into outfits, he and his fellow fans are better able to telegraph a shared love of rock. “In the future, I can see festivals where people who identify with the different subcultures can connect while listening to good music, especially because our country isn’t alternative-friendly,” he said. While the crowds at Nigerian rock shows are mostly female, few women have become community leaders. The alternative singer Bianca Adanna Okorocha, 29, who performs as Clay, is one exception. She considers her perseverance an achievement. “I’m still here when most of the people I got into the scene with have fallen away to assimilate into ‘real life,’” she said. But more notable is her ability to fuse rock music with Afropop, the predominant contemporary sound in Lagos, and the success she has had in doing so. When Ms. Okorocha performs, she is magnetic, coaxing the bodies in her thrall to give in to their baser selves.

5c7719a049f0eacbf105a883,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/27/obituaries/mark-hollis-dies.html,"Mark Hollis, the frontman for the British band Talk Talk, which had synth-pop hits in the early 1980s before veering into a more experimental sound that influenced a generation of musicians, has died. Mr. Hollis, about whom personal details are scarce, was widely reported to have been 64. A Facebook page devoted to the group confirmed the death, citing Keith Aspden, Mr. Hollis’s former manager, but provided no further details. Talk Talk was formed in London in 1981, when new wave and synth-pop groups like A Flock of Seagulls and Duran Duran were beginning to receive heavy airplay. Talk Talk’s biggest hits, among them “It’s My Life” and “Such a Shame,” were typical of the style: buoyant songs built on catchy, danceable beats and Mr. Hollis’s plaintive lyrics. The band at first consisted of Mr. Hollis on vocals, guitar and piano, Lee Harris on drums, Paul Webb on bass and Simon Brenner on keyboards. Mr. Brenner left after the group released its first album, “The Party’s Over,” on EMI in 1982, and Tim Friese-Greene became the band’s producer and unofficial fourth member. Talk Talk toured with Duran Duran and broadened its American audience with videos on MTV. But its songs never quite attained the mainstream popularity of other synth-pop groups. “It’s My Life,” the group’s highest-charting single in America, peaked at No. 31 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1984. The success of the album, also titled “It’s My Life,” that featured that song gave Talk Talk free rein to experiment. On its next albums, “The Colour of Spring” (1986) and “Spirit of Eden” (1988), the band drifted away from synth-pop into music that defied easy description. The languid songs on “Spirit of Eden” included elements of free jazz, blues, contemporary classical, industrial and ambient music as well as rock, with Mr. Hollis’s quavering vocals floating over it all. Later critics hailed the album as a precursor of post-rock, which became widespread in the 1990s. In a  video interview, Mr. Hollis said of “Spirit of Eden”: “Everyone who comes and plays on this album is given absolute freedom, has no direction at all in what they play.” He added, “And then you assemble an arrangement from that so you end up with something which is very tightly constrained.” The new sound was groundbreaking, and some critics were enthusiastic about it, but it was far from the marketable pop that EMI wanted, and the label eventually dropped the band. Talk Talk released another album, “Laughing Stock” (1991), on Polydor, then disbanded. Mr. Hollis largely receded from view after that. His last album was “Mark Hollis” (1998), an intimate, mostly acoustic offering that ended with nearly two minutes of silence. Nigel Reeve, a record executive and friend of Mr. Hollis’s, told The Guardian in 2012 that Mr. Hollis had no regrets about walking away from his rock star life. “In all the conversations I have with him, he says: ‘I did it. Full stop.’ He got to where he wanted to go,” Mr. Reeve said. Talk Talk’s influence outlasted the band: Aspects of its sound are echoed in music by groups like Radiohead and Sigur Rós. No Doubt reached No. 5 on the Billboard chart in 2004 with a cover of “It’s My Life,” and Sean Carey of the popular indie group Bon Iver described Mr. Hollis as “a hero of ours.” Mr. Hollis said little about his past, but the music website Pitchfork and other outlets reported that he was born in London in 1955. No information about his survivors was available. By most accounts he studied to become a child psychologist, then worked as a laboratory technician. His brother Ed, a disc jockey who managed punk groups, helped Mark get the attention of record labels after Mark formed a short-lived band called the Reaction in the 1970s. The group broke up when Mr. Hollis met the musicians who would join him as Talk Talk. "
5c6d72033a125f5075c0a9bc,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/20/arts/music/marc-martel-queen-freddie-mercury-bohemian-rhapsody.html,"There are three things Marc Martel says he won’t do to impersonate Freddie Mercury. He won’t wear Mercury’s trademark yellow jacket. He won’t go onstage wielding Mercury’s favored half microphone stand. And he won’t grow a full mustache. Here’s the one thing Martel needs to do: open his mouth. Through genetics and musical aptitude, the 42-year-old singer is a vocal doppelgänger for the Queen frontman. That’s a gift that has led Martel, formerly the leader of a Christian band in Canada, to a lucrative second career in recent years — and a prominent but invisible role in “Bohemian Rhapsody,” the hit biopic nominated for five Academy Awards at the Oscars on Sunday. It’s not the life Martel planned, but it’s landed him on “American Idol” and in front of crowds of thousands worldwide. “I keep realizing how weird a situation I’m in,” Martel said in a phone interview. “I’m trying to keep a good head about it.” Rami Malek embodies Mercury onscreen, but as he told The New York Times last year, “No one wants to hear me sing.” During the performance sequences in “Bohemian Rhapsody,” the movie sometimes employs Mercury’s actual vocals from the Queen archives, but that wasn’t always practical — some scenes demanded a stunt vocal-cord performer. [Relive one of Freddie Mercury’s great moments: when Queen took “Bohemian Rhapsody” to Live Aid.] The film’s creators have conceded that the sung vocals in the movie are largely by Mercury and Martel, although they haven’t broken down the specifics of who contributed what; doing so might distract from Malek’s performance. Martel, who received a fleeting “additional vocals” billing, acknowledged that he worked on the movie, but citing his nondisclosure agreement, would not go into detail. That leaves him with a ghostly status much like that of Marni Nixon, who provided the singing voices both of Maria in the movie of “West Side Story” (for Natalie Wood) and Eliza in the movie of “My Fair Lady” (for Audrey Hepburn), without credit. Even though Martel doesn’t get the awards-show glamour that Malek is enjoying, he’s proud of his contributions to “Bohemian Rhapsody.” The first time he saw it wasn’t at a red-carpet event: He caught it in Cool Springs, Tenn., with his wife and manager, wearing “our comfy clothes.” He had wanted to enjoy the movie as a spectator, but “I couldn’t help waiting for the next scene where I was going to hear my own voice,” he said. So the Martels bought out a movie theater showing, invited 80 of their closest friends and treated it like a party. Martel grew up in Montreal listening to pop (George Michael was a favorite) and Christian music (his parents worked at a church as pastor and choir director). All he knew of Queen was the scene in the 1992 comedy “Wayne’s World” where the characters rock out to “Bohemian Rhapsody” in an AMC Pacer. He started a Christian rock band called Downhere with some friends in college; in 2001, they signed a record deal and moved to Nashville. He believes that the first person to tell him he sounded like Freddie Mercury was the Downhere bassist Glenn Lavender. It was a compliment, given how Mercury was one of the great singers in rock history, possessing a pellucid tone, a three-octave range and an operatic quality that could make even paeans to bicycle riding sound emotional. But Martel didn’t initially take it as praise. “That’s cool — I sound unoriginal,” he recalled thinking. But he checked out Queen’s greatest hits, hoping to learn something from Mercury (who died in 1991 of AIDS-related pneumonia): “I never thought it would amount to anything more than a fun karaoke trick.” In 2011, however, with Downhere having run its course after seven studio albums, Martel heard that the Queen drummer Roger Taylor was putting together an authorized tribute band called the Queen Extravaganza and won a spot on vocals with an audition video of “Somebody to Love” that went viral. Martel sounds close enough to Mercury that he can itemize the subtle differences: “I’m not British, so I don’t usually sing with an accent. I don’t have extra teeth like he did, so my Ss come out normally — his were very piercing,” he said. “But even if I don’t try to sing like Freddie Mercury, people still hear him in my voice, no matter what I do. I have this weird unique thing where I can sound like him, so why wouldn’t I?” Martel now steadily tours with his own Ultimate Queen Celebration and also does shows with the Black Jacket Symphony and Symphonic Queen. He said the Queen catalog has made him a better singer and inspired him to take better care of his voice — while he felt comfortable backing off a high note in one of his own songs when necessary, he doesn’t like to disappoint Queen fans who expect to hear a song the way they know it from the radio. Last year he released an album of Queen covers, “Thunderbolt & Lightning,” and his YouTube covers of Queen classics have become popular enough that he finds himself recognized in public — especially outside the United States, which was never the band’s biggest market. Martel, who has concerts booked in 14 countries this year, from Ukraine to New Zealand, notes that American crowds generally don’t know the arm movements and clapping that traditionally accompany “Radio Ga Ga,” while international audiences will do it unprompted. Although Queen has been a part of his life for nearly a decade, Martel is still figuring out “what being a tribute artist means,” he said. “For some reason, there’s a stigma around it.” A little defensively, he cited Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley and classical musicians as interpreters of other people’s work. Martel records an annual Christmas EP and still writes songs, but he doesn’t currently have an outlet for them; he dreams of a day when he can throw just one original into a set of Queen covers. He recalled a recent conversation with his manager, who told him, “I’d like you to consider your songwriting the way I view my golf game — I love playing golf, but it’s not what’s paying the bills right now.” That was hard for Martel to hear, but he ultimately accepted its wisdom. “The next five years, there’s going to be a lot of Queen,” he said, and chuckled. “But at the same time, I’m going to work on my golf game.” "
5c9ded1349f0eacbf105fb86,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/29/opinion/janet-jackson.html,"America, and the music world at large, has spent a significant portion of the past month grappling with the implications of “Leaving Neverland,” the haunting HBO documentary that revisits highly credible pedophilia allegations against Michael Jackson. But on Friday, good news will emerge about a member of the Jackson family that runs the risk of being overlooked.  Mr. Jackson’s younger sister, Janet Jackson, who has been one of the world’s brightest and most influential pop stars in her own right, will finally be inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame — 15 years after the “Nipplegate” fiasco at the Super Bowl halftime show that threatened her career, and 30 years after the release of her groundbreaking album “Rhythm Nation 1814.” Unlike most of her contemporaries in a comparable stratum, Ms. Jackson has found her entry into music’s most recognizable house of prestige elusive until now. She has been eligible since 2007, and there has been no shortage of whispers or indignant blogging, insisting she has been left out of the hall’s induction classes until now by the same entertainment industry forces that marginalized her after the infamous “wardrobe malfunction.”  In February 2004 — when phones weren’t smart, Twitter didn’t exist, The Facebook was days away from birth, LeBron James was still a teenager and Donald Trump was still a Democrat with a reality show — Janet Jackson had a nightmare unfold, in the space of a second, as she headlined the MTV-produced halftime show of Super Bowl XXXVIII. Before a crowd of over 71,000 and 90 million more watching on TV, Ms. Jackson performed a medley of her hits across three decades. She was then joined for a finale by a bearded yet still baby-faced Justin Timberlake to perform “Rock Your Body,” a catchy, dance-inducing number from his solo debut. The song, which threw the crowd into a happy frenzy, briefly became a duet. Then, in a cinematic shock — as the duo spun apart for what was meant as a final “costume reveal” in the choreography — Mr. Timberlake ripped off a portion of Ms. Jackson’s top, exposing her right breast on live television, just after he’d delivered the song’s last line: “Bet I’ll have you naked by the end of this song.” By the time heads quit spinning, “wardrobe malfunction” had been coined, and what was meant to be a crowning moment for Ms. Jackson was reduced to a meme. They both said it was an accident. But conspiracy theories abounded, and still do.  Parent groups, major advertisers (their parent companies) and the White House all condemned the incident. CBS was handed a fine by the Federal Communications Commission for indecency, which was ultimately voided. And Mr. Timberlake — who, accidentally or not, did the ripping — largely avoided public rebuke. Ms. Jackson, absent from the Grammys that year under unclear circumstances, after being scheduled to appear, experienced a newfangled, online-enabled public taunting analogous only to that faced by Monica Lewinsky at the millennium’s turn. She lost countless endorsement and touring opportunities. (She’ll have her highest-profile return to the limelight when she begins a residency in Las Vegas in May.) But, of course, the five-time Grammy Award winner is being honored because her cultural influence and career, while dotted with distress, has been anything but tragic, taken as a whole. The youngest child in the Jackson family, she had seen her brothers already gain fame as the Jackson 5 before she was a teenager. The 1986 album “Control,” produced by the icons Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, would be her own, noncoincidentally titled breakthrough. She had fired her notoriously domineering father as her manager, and her quest for independence powered the project’s vocal energy, which was matched by bombastic synths and carefree drum-heavy beats.  “Nasty,” a defiant, feminine power anthem protesting unwanted male attention and disrespect, featured a video subtly ahead of its time in its messaging about consent. (The snare drums drop, pointedly, after she shouts at a grabby pursuer, “Stop!”) “Control” topped the charts and established Ms. Jackson as a pioneer of genre-bending New Jack Swing and the modern music video: self-referential quirks and extended dance breakdowns paired with film-like production and narrative. The visual companions to lasting singles like the exasperated yet ebullient “What Have You Done for Me Lately” and the dance number “Pleasure Principle” (legendary back flip and all) helped break MTV’s gendered color line. Where “Control” focused on self-actualization, “Rhythm Nation 1814” (1989) aimed to address the world and her country, with its simmering social divides, and offer a salve. “Join forces in protest to social injustice/A generation full of courage, come forth with me,” she declared over the up-tempo, industrial grind of the title track. The progressivism embedded in the album managed to be simultaneously cool and civic-minded at a time when such a feat was considered nearly impossible for a pop star. Not only did all seven singles from “Rhythm Nation 1814” land in the top five of the Billboard 100, it had No. 1 hits in three separate years — with different songs topping the chart from 1989 through 1991. A long-form video medley of the album, shot in black and white, won a Grammy. Ms. Jackson’s global popularity and the indescribable coolness of her perch in American popular culture at the time is hard to capture in hindsight, or to compare with our digitally Balkanized era. She continued to flourish with her fifth album, 1993’s “Janet.,” embracing her femininity and sexuality with more confident ease than in any of her previous work. Writing about the album on its 25th anniversary for Rolling Stone, Brittany Spanos noted how “Janet.” inspired artists like Beyoncé, Rihanna, SZA and Janelle Monáe, all of whom openly testify to how her example helped them incorporate “power, intimacy and assertiveness” into their own work.  For many women of color growing up in the ’80s and ’90s, Ms. Jackson was the first “triple threat” superstar who looked like them to reach, or fully “cross over,” to the mainstream. It was “Janet” whom they danced to in front of their mirrors and imitated in dress, not Michael. As she entered her 30s and her career steadied to a cruise of experiments and radio hits, Michael Jackson’s had become increasingly weighed down by his questionable relations with children. Mr. Jackson was first accused of molestation in 1993. The case was settled for over $20 million in 1994 and the charges were ultimately dropped after the boy refused to cooperate with the investigation. Janet Jackson was resolute in support of her brother during the episode and after it. Footage from a documentary released in 2016 shows her denouncing the 1993 allegations. “Now, if this really went on, do you think a father would accept money?” she asks the interviewer. “Do you think that would make everything O.K.? It doesn’t make any sense.” Ms. Jackson hasn’t spoken up since “Leaving Neverland” aired. Her nephew Taj Jackson told CBS News’s Gayle King that she feared addressing the film would just “put more energy” into the matter, but he insisted that she, too, believed Michael was innocent. However, her radio silence now, after a previous vociferous defense, seems at best a convenient tactic of avoidance by the family’s second-most-famous member and at worst a tacit acknowledgment that she was most likely wrong all along. Still, whereas Mr. Jackson’s career never quite recovered from a scandal of his own making, Janet Jackson’s career was derailed by a bizarre moment over which she had little agency. (In an extra, queasy layer of coincidence, “Rock Your Body,” the song playing during the Super Bowl nudity flash, is a tune that Mr. Jackson had reportedly turned down for his 2001 album, according to Billboard’s Jason Lipshutz.) The public rebuke she received wasn’t all organic. A 2018 HuffPost report revealed that the CBS chairman Les Moonves, who was ousted last year as evidence of his own sexual misconduct mounted, was determined to ruin Ms. Jackson’s career because of the Super Bowl incident. Convinced it was a stunt and enraged with Ms. Jackson, according to the report, he demanded that Viacom radio stations, as well as VH1 and MTV, which she helped integrate in prior decades, stop playing her music. Ms. Jackson and Mr. Timberlake both offered apologies. But Ms. Jackson, a black woman, was almost exclusively shamed.  For uncertain reasons, despite initial plans, she wasn’t at the Grammys. He was still welcome to attend and won two awards. His career flourished, even as it waxed and waned (see his return to the halftime show of the Super Bowl last year). Hers was arguably suffocated — and at a time before millions of fans could crowdsource their cultural capital for backlash. There was no Black Twitter — with its mix of influential literati, activists and humorists — to have Janet Jackson’s back. The moment lasted just nine-sixteenths of a second but carried centuries of subtext, something Mr. Timberlake himself pointed out after time passed. “I probably got 10 percent of the blame,” he admitted. “I think America's probably harsher on women, and I think America is, you know, unfairly harsh on ethnic people.” “Nipplegate” is, in some ways, textbook proof that “intersectionality” — the term coined by Kimberlé Crenshaw, the same year “Rhythm Nation” was released, to describe the overlapping forms of discrimination — is not an abstract “ism” but a reality that can negatively manifest itself in culture-altering ways. When Madonna kissed Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards, there were guffaws and temporary scoldings. But she was once again celebrated as a provocateur, then shortly afterward inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2008 — by Mr. Timberlake, no less. Ms. Jackson, who became eligible for the hall in 2007 didn’t receive a nomination until 2016. Although Janet Jackson’s legacy certainly doesn’t need the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame’s validation, its lack of recognition was threatening to become a glaring omission. Now, at long last, the oversight will be corrected — and Ms. Jackson can take her bow.

5c87bbc349f0eacbf105c9ff,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/12/theater/britney-spears-musical.html,"Britney Spears, meet Betty Friedan. The theater owner James L. Nederlander announced Tuesday that he is producing a new musical featuring the song catalog of Ms. Spears — one of the best-selling pop artists of all time — that explores an alternative arc for some classic fairy tale princesses. The show, a musical comedy called “Once Upon a One More Time,” is scheduled to have a production this fall in Chicago and then seek to transfer to Broadway. Unlike many jukebox musicals, this show will not be about Ms. Spears’s life (which has not been a fairy tale), but instead will offer a revisionist look at some legendary characters. In the show, a fortnightly book club whose members include Snow White, Cinderella, Rapunzel and Sleeping Beauty, is working its way through a collection of the Grimms’ fairy tales — the only book they have. But when the women wish for new reading material, a fairy godmother brings them Ms. Friedan’s feminist classic, “The Feminine Mystique,” and their lives are altered in unexpected ways. “Cinderella is having an existential crisis, and she has a posse of famous princesses, and her stepmother is the main antagonist, and there’s also Prince Charming and a dwarf we’ve never met — the eighth dwarf — and a narrator who is unhappy his system is being dismantled before his eyes,” said the bookwriter, Jon Hartmere, who wrote the screenplay for “The Upside” and was one of the writers of “Bare,” a musical about gay Christian teenagers. “These women have been in this hermetically sealed world, and then they start to get deeper into modern ideas — second and third-wave feminism — and also explore how stories are passed down to us, and where we get our norms from. But it’s also superfun and funny.” The director will be Kristin Hanggi (“Rock of Ages”) and the choreographers Keone & Mari Madrid (Justin Bieber’s “Love Yourself”; “World of Dance”). The project has already had several readings — one of them attended by Ms. Spears — and will have a developmental workshop next month, Mr. Hartmere said. He said the score currently includes 23 songs from Ms. Spears’s catalog, including most of her big hits, as well as “a couple of deep album cuts.” The show is scheduled to start previews Oct. 29, to open Nov. 13, and to run until Dec. 1 at the James M. Nederlander Theater in Chicago. Those are the same dates, and the same theater, that had been set aside for “Don’t Stop ’Til You Get Enough,” a Michael Jackson jukebox musical that canceled its Chicago plans on the eve of an HBO documentary detailing abuse allegations against the pop star. That show’s producers say they are still hoping to come to Broadway. "
5ca7446c49f0eacbf1f8123a,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/05/arts/music/kurt-cobain-nirvana-death.html,"Twenty-five years ago, on April 5, 1994, Kurt Cobain died at the age of 27, a victim of suicide. He left behind the epochal rock music he made as the singer and guitarist for Nirvana, piles of journals and artwork, and a final note that didn’t clear up the contradictions of his short life. Which was probably how he wanted it: The previous year, he had painted on the wall of his rented Seattle home, in large red block letters, “None of You Will Ever Know My Intentions.” Many Nirvana biographies rehash the basics of Cobain’s story or peddle conspiracy theories that he was murdered, but there are also plenty of ways to go deeper. Here’s what to read, listen to, watch and explore: ‘Journals’ (Riverhead) With nearly 300 pages of photo replicas of Cobain’s personal journals and letters (and doodles, sketches and song lists), this 2002 book is funny, painful and shockingly intimate: a guided tour of the singer’s own churning psyche. “Its hard to decipher the difference between a sincere entertainer and an honest swindler,” Cobain wrote. Here’s what The New York Times’s Neil Strauss wrote when the book came out. ‘Come as You Are’ (Three Rivers) This deeply reported 1993 biography by Michael Azerrad, first published while Cobain was alive, was the original bible for Nirvana fans. Its strongest passages evoke the life of young Cobain in Aberdeen, Wash., a child of divorce who would sometimes spend the weekend killing time at a local logging company where his father worked: “He would get into his dad’s van and listen to Queen’s ‘News of the World’ over and over again on the eight-track. Sometimes he’d listen so long that he’d drain the battery and they’d have to find someone to jump-start the engine.” ‘Heavier Than Heaven’ (Hachette) Charles R. Cross, formerly the editor of the Seattle music paper The Rocket, covered the Nirvana story from early on — and conducted over 400 interviews for this thorough, definitive 2001 biography. Cobain’s widow, the musician Courtney Love, granted Cross extensive interviews and access to Cobain’s archives, including arcana such as a visual assignment he completed during his final stay in rehab: “For ‘surrender,’ he drew a man with a bright light emanating from him. For ‘depressed,’ he showed an umbrella surrounded by ties.” Read The New York Times review. ‘Takeoff: The Oral History of Nirvana’s Crossover Moment’ (Cuepoint) When Nirvana’s “Nevermind” hit No. 1 soon after its 1991 release, it shocked the band members and their grunge cohort, who had assumed that at best, the group would be underground heroes. Its multiplatinum success also opened the doors for many Nirvana-bes. This oral history by Nick Soulsby tells that story from the viewpoint of Nirvana’s college-rock peers, such as Gary Floyd of opening act Sister Double Happiness remembering Nirvana’s “road manager telling everyone backstage one night the CD had hit 1 million sales that day. They seemed almost embarrassed.” ‘The Dark Side of Kurt Cobain’ (The Advocate) Cobain loudly and frequently declared himself as an ally of gay people (and women, and people of color), so it was fitting that he gave one of his best interviews in this 1993 cover story with The Advocate, telling Kevin Allman, “I’ve always been a really sickly, feminine person anyhow, so I thought I was gay for a while because I didn’t find any of the girls in my high school attractive at all.” ‘Kurt Cobain, The Rolling Stone Interview: Success Doesn’t Suck’ (Rolling Stone) In Cobain’s last major interview, he informed David Fricke that he had wanted to call Nirvana’s “In Utero” album “I Hate Myself and I Want to Die,” “but I knew the majority of the people wouldn’t understand.” He insisted that the suicidal sentiment was only a joke: “I’m a much happier guy than a lot of people think I am.” ‘Never More’ (The Village Voice) After Cobain’s death, Ann Powers filed a raw dispatch from Seattle, reporting how the tragedy affected his friends and the neighbors who had never met him. “The kids I found who did mourn Cobain, hovering behind police lines at the house where he’d died or building shrines from candles and Raisin Bran boxes at the Sunday night vigil organized by three local radio stations, seemed to think of him more as a lost friend than as a candidate for that dreaded assignment, role model.” ‘Nirvana — The Moon, New Haven 1991’ On Sept. 26, 1991, just two days after the release of “Nevermind,” Nirvana played a great, sweaty show at a tiny club in New Haven — and miraculously, it was captured on this remarkably high-quality amateur video. The set featured just a few songs from the unfamiliar “Nevermind,” leaning heavily on the band’s 1989 debut, “Bleach.” Cobain, the bassist Krist Novoselic, and the drummer Dave Grohl all performed with joy and abandon, looking more at home in a filthy black room with a low ceiling than they ever did in arenas. ‘Live at Reading’ In the summer of 1992, when Nirvana played this storied U.K. festival, the band was divided by arguments over royalties and reports of Cobain’s heroin habit. Responding to the mood, Cobain came onstage in a wheelchair, wearing a hospital gown and a blond wig, and began the set with an out-of-tune cover of Bette Midler’s “The Rose.” At the end of the show, the group systematically destroyed its equipment. In between, almost as an afterthought, it delivered an hour and a half of full-blast rock. ‘Drain You’ When Jimmy McDonough, the author of the 2002 book “Shakey: Neil Young’s Biography,” wanted to show Young a live Nirvana performance after Cobain died, this 1993 clip from an MTV “Live and Loud” concert was the one he chose. “When you see the way he was,” an impressed Young said, “there’s no way he could ever get through the other end of it. Because there was no control to the burn. That’s why it was so intense. He was not holding back at all.” ‘Nirvana — Munich, Germany’ Nirvana’s last concert, on March 1, 1994, at a cavernous airport terminal that had been converted into a club, was an ordeal for a burned-out Cobain: He wanted to end the band, he wanted to divorce Love, he wanted to score drugs at the Munich train station. But the show (rendered here with just the first 10 minutes of video but a full 80 minutes of audio) was one final scream of pain, ending with “Heart-Shaped Box.” “Hey, wait, I got a new complaint,” Cobain sang, never meaning it more. ‘Kurt Cobain — Different Vocals’ This video collects live moments when Cobain dramatically altered his usual performances of familiar songs for various punk-rock reasons such as needing to shout over out-of-tune instruments (on “Come as You Are”) or just wanting to mess with a TV countdown show that was forcing him to mime playing his guitar (on “Smells Like Teen Spirit”). ‘MTV Unplugged in New York’ Playing acoustically for 44 minutes, Nirvana paid tribute to influences ranging from David Bowie to the Meat Puppets, and showed the delicate beauty behind its distorted guitars. And with the final song, a cover of Leadbelly’s “Where Did You Sleep Last Night,” Cobain gave one of his greatest vocal performances; it felt powerful enough to bring the curtain down on all of human existence. ‘Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck’ (Amazon) Cobain’s daughter, Frances Bean Cobain, served as executive producer on this authorized documentary feature directed by Brett Morgen. Mike Hale wrote in his Times review in 2015, “Mr. Morgen was given access to Cobain’s archives — ‘art, music, journals, Super 8 films and audio montages’ — and his exhilarating, exhausting, two-hour-plus film, both an artful mosaic and a hammering barrage, reflects years of rummaging through that trove.” ‘One of Kurt Cobain’s Final Interviews’ In this 26-minute WatchMojo interview from 1993, filmed with the Seattle waterfront as a backdrop, Cobain was bearded and scabby, smoking one cigarette after another. He was also relaxed and thoughtful, laughing at questions about his rock-star status that on a different day would have made him bristle. He explained, “Either I’ve accepted it or I’ve gone beyond insane.” ‘8 Fragments for Kurt Cobain’ The poet Jim Carroll, famous for the autobiographical book “The Basketball Diaries” and the autobiographical song “People Who Died,” wrote and performed this poem after Cobain’s death, trying to make sense of the senseless. It begins, “Genius is not a generous thing/In return it charges more interest than any amount of royalties can cover/And it resents fame/With bitter vengeance.” ‘About a Boy’ (Penguin) The death of Cobain haunts Nick Hornby’s second novel, shattering some of its characters and binding some of them together. The 12-year-old Marcus tries to make sense of the news he sees plastered all over the front pages of the evening papers: “He wondered if his mum was O.K., even though he knew there was no connection between his mum and Kurt Cobain because his mum was a real person and Kurt Cobain wasn’t; and then he felt confused, because the newspaper headline had turned Kurt Cobain into a real person somehow.” ‘Skip to the End’ (Insight) This evocative 2018 science-fiction graphic novel by the writer Jeremy Holt and the artist Alex Diotto tells the story of a grunge band called Samsara (clearly inspired by Nirvana) and a guitar that functions as a time-travel device. The metaphor works not only because of the urge Nirvana fans have to create an alternate timeline where Cobain survived, but because recorded music is itself a time-travel device, teleporting people both to the moment when it was made and the moment when it first touched a listener’s soul. ‘Last Days’ (Streaming Services) The filmmaker Gus Van Sant was a kindred spirit to Cobain: an independent artist from the Pacific Northwest who somehow wandered into the cultural mainstream. So it seemed natural in 2005 when he made a movie about (a thinly fictionalized version of) Cobain, played by Michael Pitt. In her Times review, Manohla Dargis called the movie a “mesmerizing dream” and said “Mr. Van Sant’s refusal to root around in Cobain’s consciousness, to try to explain why and how he created, suffered and died, is a radical gesture, both in aesthetic and in moral terms.” In 1991, Karen Schoemer was supposed to interview Cobain; he didn’t show up, so she wrote about “Nevermind” instead. Novoselic provided a few quotes: “We just want to play,” he said, “and put out what we consider good records.” A few months later, Simon Reynolds dissected some of the album’s songs: “‘Smells Like Teen Spirit’ could be this generation’s version of the Sex Pistols’ 1976 single, ‘Anarchy in the U.K.,’ if it weren’t for the bitter irony that pervades its title.” In 1992, Schoemer mused on Nirvana’s set on “Saturday Night Live,” a performance that she said “showed an astounding lack of musicianship” while later acknowledging that the band had released “quite simply, one of the best alternative rock albums produced by an American band in recent years.” Also in 1992, The Times was fooled by a former Sub Pop receptionist when a reporter called to talk about grunge culture. The resulting glossary of terms she provided — “harsh realm,” “lamestain” and “swingin’ on the flippity-flop” — did enter the pop-culture lexicon, but not the way The Times had planned. The receptionist, Megan Jasper, is now the label’s chief executive. A year later, Jon Pareles interviewed Nirvana on the cusp of releasing “In Utero,” as Cobain complained about “Nevermind” sounding too “clean.” “Ugh,” he said. “I’ll never do that again. It already paid off, so why try to duplicate that? And just trying to sell that many records again, there’s no point in it.” Pareles also reviewed Nirvana at the Roseland Ballroom, the band’s first New York show in two years. When Cobain died, Timothy Egan wrote our obituary and Pareles wrote an appraisal that discussed how “Nirvana was the band that brought punk-rock kicking and screaming into the mass market.” Neil Strauss later wrote about the songs written about Cobain: “Perhaps the most touching song about Cobain was written by a 10-year-old friend of his, Simon Fair Timony. Titled ‘I Love You Anyway,’ it is performed with the former Nirvana members Dave Grohl and Krist Novoselic joining Timony’s band, the Stinky Puffs.” In 2004, Thurston Moore wrote a first-person piece about his relationship with Cobain and Nirvana’s rise.

5c6c40b63a125f5075c0a709,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/19/obituaries/guy-webster-dead.html,"Guy Webster was smoking pot with the Mamas & the Papas in the group’s rented house in Los Angeles in 1966 when he had an idea about how to photograph them for the cover of their debut album. He told them to head into a bathroom, where all four squeezed, fully clothed, into the tub: John Phillips sat in the foreground, and behind him were Cass Elliot, Denny Doherty and Michelle Phillips, her legs stretched across the others’ laps. (Mr. Doherty told a slightly different story: that they had been hiding from Mr. Webster in the tub.) “You can see how stoned they were,” Mr. Webster said when he showed the picture to an audience attending an exhibition about his career at the Annenberg Space for Photography in Los Angeles in 2012. But the picture had a flaw: It included the toilet — an image, he said, that would have limited sales of the album, “If You Can Believe Your Eyes and Ears,” in family-oriented chain stores. “So Lou Adler,” he continued, referring to the producer of the album and the president of Dunhill Records, “came up with the idea that when we put shrink wrap over the album, and put a sticker on it that says, ‘Including “California Dreamin’,” we can sell it at Sears. And when the kids take it off, there’s the toilet.” “If You Can Believe Your Eyes and Ears” rose to No. 1 on the Billboard album chart and enhanced Mr. Webster’s growing reputation as one of the top rock ’n’ roll photographers of his time. Over a frenetic period between the mid-1960s and the early ’70s, Mr. Webster shot album covers for the Rolling Stones, the Doors, Simon & Garfunkel, Captain Beefheart, the Byrds, the Beach Boys, Tim Buckley and Nico, as well as continuing to work with the Mamas & the Papas. “He knew about the power and longevity of music,” Harvey Kubernik, who, with his brother, Kenneth, wrote “Big Shots: Rock Legends and Hollywood Icons: The Photography of Guy Webster” (2014), said by telephone. “He treated music as an art form that would be around for the next century.” Mr. Webster died on Feb. 5 in Ojai, Calif. He was 79. His wife, Leone (James) Webster, said the cause was liver cancer. Several months after that bathtub session, Mr. Webster invited the Doors to his small studio behind his parents’ house in Beverly Hills to photograph them for their first album, which would be released in early 1967. “In walked Jim Morrison, and he said, ‘Guy!’ ” Mr. Webster recalled in an interview in “Big Shots.” He did not recognize this longhaired lead singer, but Mr. Morrison reminded him that they had been in the same philosophy class at U.C.L.A. After removing his cheap beribboned shirt at Mr. Webster’s request, Mr. Morrison became the focus of the cover photo, his face much larger than those of Ray Manzarek, Robby Krieger and John Densmore, who looked more like satellites than bandmates. “I’m sure they hated me for this cover because they weren’t equal in size,” Mr. Webster said at the Annenberg lecture. “The songwriter is the guy on the far right — Krieger wrote ‘Light My Fire,’ Morrison didn’t.” But, he added, “I’m happy I went with it, because it was so popular.” Guy Michael Webster was born on Sept. 14, 1939, in Los Angeles. His father, Paul Francis Webster, was a lyricist who shared Academy Awards for best original song for “The Shadow of Your Smile,” “Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing” and “Secret Love.” His mother, Gloria (Benguiat) Webster, was a homemaker. After graduating from Beverly Hills High School, Guy attended Whittier College and then entered the Army, stationed at Ford Ord in California. When asked whether he knew anything about photography, he pretended that he did and quickly began studying photograph books in the base’s library. He eventually became the head of its photo department. After his discharge, he disappointed his parents by telling them he would study photography at Art Center College of Design in Pasadena rather than attend Yale. They refused to pay for his education, fearing he would become no more than a paparazzo. While he was at Art Center, his ambition to be a fine-art photographer was derailed by his friend Terry Melcher, Doris Day’s son, who was a producer for Columbia Records. Mr. Melcher introduced him to Mr. Adler, who was intrigued by Mr. Webster’s portfolio and hired him at Dunhill. One early project was Barry McGuire’s third album, named for his apocalyptic hit single, “Eve of Destruction” (1965). For the cover, in black and white, he photographed Mr. McGuire in a manhole. Columbia asked Mr. Webster to work with Simon & Garfunkel on their album “Sounds of Silence” (1966). He brought the duo to the shady grasslands of Franklin Canyon in Los Angeles, where he posed them on a dirt road looking as if they were walking into an unknown future. He also brought them to meet his father, who had collaborated with Johnny Mercer, Hoagy Carmichael and others. “Paul Simon said, ‘Hey, you want to hear our new song?’ ” Mr. Webster recalled in “Big Shots.” “And he pulled out his guitar in the living room in Beverly Hills, and my dad was sitting there, who is not a rock and roller, and he listened to ‘Sounds of Silence’ for the first time. ‘Oh, my God, you guys, what a brilliant song.’ ” By the early 1970s, Mr. Webster, burned out by the pace of his rock work, moved to Europe for several years. In Italy, he studied art history at the University of Florence and started building a large collection of vintage Italian motorcycles. Returning to the United States, he began photographing Hollywood stars like Jack Nicholson, Dennis Hopper, Candice Bergen and Jane Fonda. He also photographed actors for publicity shots and movie productions on location. “He had an ability to make celebrities feel very safe,” Leone Webster said in a telephone interview. “He also had these adorable pictures of the Kardashian girls growing up — he was like their family photographer.” In addition to his wife, Mr. Webster is survived by his daughters, Sarah, Merry, Jessie and Erin Webster; a son, Michael; two grandchildren; and a brother, Roger, who is also known as Mona. His marriage to Bettie Beal ended in divorce. Mr. Webster’s work with the Rolling Stones — including the photo for the bucolic cover of the United States release of the anthology “Big Hits (High Tide and Green Grass)” (1966) — began with an unusual offer in 1965 from Andrew Loog Oldham, their producer and manager: Take photographs, but don’t expect to be paid because it’s an honor simply to work with the band. “And I said, ‘Well, it’s an honor for you that I take these pictures,’ ” Mr. Webster said at the Annenberg event. “He paid me for one album cover. Three of them came out during the years using my photographs.” "
5c8c237849f0eacbf105d5e4,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/15/arts/television/iggy-pop-punk-epix.html,"Over the years, the Michigan-born rocker James Osterberg Jr. — better known by his stage persona, Iggy Pop — has earned a reputation as “the Godfather of Punk.” This is thanks mostly to his tenure as the frontman of the proto-punk band the Stooges, but also because his reckless, sui generis stage presence embodied a gleeful but slightly scary abandon that became synonymous with the genre. His presence looms over “Punk,” a four-part documentary series about the fashion, politics and musical influences that defined punk rock, which debuted this week on Epix. Osterberg (credited as Iggy Pop) is an executive producer of the series, along with the fashion designer John Varvatos — which might raise eyebrows given that Varvatos put what some would say was the final nail in punk’s coffin in 2007 by buying CBGB, the hallowed punk club at 315 Bowery, and replacing it with one of his boutiques. In a phone interview, Osterberg defended Varvatos and also discussed the Sex Pistols, drugs and his favorite music critics. These are edited excerpts from that conversation. Punk, in its original form, was nothing if not iconoclastic. How do you feel when critics, fans or other musicians call you the “Godfather of Punk”? Once it gets into reverence, does that bother me? Yeah. I was, initially, but now I don’t mind being called “Godfather of Punk;” I suppose I’ve grown into the suit! There are occasional personal feelings that come from one-on-one interactions, when someone lets me know something genuine about the role that my work played in their life. When any type of music is still enjoying its vitality — that’s a social influence. And then, as people carry on that style and figure out how to further produce it, the style becomes academic, by really imperceptible steps. Even in country music: There is a hell of a big stretch going from Hank Williams to Garth Brooks, buddy! That process of change happens in all genres. Rock ‘n’ roll sort of took a beating and is now basically irrelevant, because it got mined to death. But whatever anybody wants to call me is O.K. I’ve been called worse things than the “Godfather of Punk”! You’ve said that the Sex Pistols were honest with their fans because they always told their fans that they shouldn’t be trusted.  I said “They always thought they were honest.” I don’t remember applauding anybody for saying “Don’t trust me.” I was much more impressed with their onstage ability than whether they were swindled out of thousands of dollars by their manager [Malcolm McLaren]. I just don’t care. But that doesn’t mean [McLaren] was not an effective Barnum-type showman. He was, you know? And that’s fine. The group, as a whole, had a lot of flair. Johnny Lydon is very good at the things you’re supposed to be good at when you front a group. And [the guitarist Steve Jones] was a really good foil for Johnny, especially when it came to doing publicity. Everybody contributed something musically, or in terms of image, to the group. In “Punk,” the deaths of the Sex Pistols bassist Sid Vicious and his girlfriend Nancy Spungen are presented as examples of how drugs essentially killed the punk movement. There was a lot of that stuff around the music business as I experienced it, as a punky type. And it was the hard stuff, so there was always a price to be paid. LSD and marijuana were the stuff being pushed in 1966 and 1967. And taking those drugs has a way of breaking down some barriers that people need to hold themselves together. But while those barriers are being broken down, you also get insights about life and the world around you, especially if you’ve grown up as a milk-fed American lamb to the slaughter, as we all were when we were told, “Go to Vietnam, but don’t ask why.” All that. Cocaine came in next. And it seemed like a good drug because, after a while, the weed and the LSD weren’t doing it anymore. Some people were getting into speed, but cocaine was a more upscale stimulant that, in effect, kept the party going. Eventually, people’s nerves were shot, their patience had worn thin, and many turned to opioid drugs, as well as Valium and other soporifics. Those are very subtle, dangerous drugs. Are there books or critics about either your music or punk music that you think are especially valuable? Lester Bangs and Nick Kent are two people I can think of, off the top of my head. Both of them, in sort of a flailing, wild, highly subjective way. But why not! At least the two of them were treating what they write about like it’s actually important. I read the stuff Lester Bangs wrote about me and thought: “Oh no, I’m a buffoon! But wait: I am a salient blowtorch of nihilism. Cool! Wait, am I cool or not? I’m not sure!” I have one of his books in hardback. I’ve had it for a long, long time. It’s sitting on the shelf along with “The Andy Warhol Diaries,” the collected works of Allen Ginsberg and a few other books. I look at their spines and think: “O.K., this is what’s important!” In “Punk,” you talk about your work without retrospectively judging yourself. What kind of questions were you asked and how did they make you feel? I knew and had worked for John Varvatos before I accepted both the interview and the fairly basic responsibilities that come with being listed as an executive producer. He loves and is genuinely interested in music. I once saw, in one of his stores, a book about the 100 greatest rock albums or something; at the time, I was modeling for him, so I was picking up some free swag. The book was thoughtful; it was a work of “soulful commerce,” I would say. So I knew that was where this show’s interview questions were going to be coming from. Like, there would inevitably be questions like: “So, you became a junkie … ” and that sort of thing. Whereas, a critic — who’s concerned with arcana and “pure art” — is going to have different questions. In those cases, you listen to the question and try to answer it inasmuch as it can be respected. And then you try to insert something of your own that has nothing to do with the question, so that you get in your own licks. You try to twist the thing over a little bit to your own point-of-view. What would you say to people who remain outraged that CBGB was turned into a Varvatos boutique? What would I say to people who think, “It all happened at CBGB, man”? There was something about that room that was conducive to a range of musical approaches that centered on a kind of detail-oriented, reference-oriented, intellectually-tinted art-rock. Like Talking Heads and many aspects of the Ramones, which was stylized in many ways. And Blondie, though that’s not as obvious in Blondie: [The lead singer Debbie Harry] seemed to learn how to sing out of nowhere. I don’t know how she could have done that without a club she could go to over and over while she was learning. And then Patti Smith’s group, obviously, even though I think “The Piss Factory” was recorded in the Nightingale. That was a little dive bar, smaller than CBGB, where they kept sawdust on the floor because people were going to puke, pee and spit, right? But she was also playing at CBGB, too. You could develop in that room. It was small in a particular way. "
5c6da7843a125f5075c0aa5d,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/20/arts/music/gary-clark-jr-this-land-review.html,"Gary Clark Jr. was born in the wrong era. In the 1960s or ’70s, he could easily have forged a career as a first-rank guitar hero: a Texan blues-rocker who can step on any stage and bring the place down with a searing guitar solo. Prospects are different in the 21st century. The idea of a guitar hero was thoroughly undermined by punk and then pushed aside by increasingly computerized pop, dance music and hip-hop. For decades, vintage-style blues and the flesh-on-strings virtuosity it requires have been shunted toward nostalgia, preservationism and the die-hard realms of Americana. In 2019, Clark is an exceedingly rare figure, a bluesman who has a major-label recording contract and a worldwide audience, one he has built by tearing up stage after stage, show after show. While his songwriting has lagged behind his performing, he’s well aware of his strengths; he has alternated studio albums with live ones. [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] On “This Land,” his third major-label studio album, his songwriting has caught up with his playing. It has something to do with experience; now 35, Clark has been performing since his teens. It has something to do with the power of contrariness: that is, Clark’s determination to deliver the raw, analog, spontaneous opposite of crisply quantized digital content. And it has a lot to do with America in 2019, where division, frustration and seething anger can use an outlet with the historical resonance and emotional depth of the blues. The title song of “This Land,” which also opens the album, has the singer settling in on his new 50-acre ranch “in the middle of Trump country,” facing hostile, racist neighbors who want him to “go back where you came from.” He snarls right back: “I’m America’s son. This is where I come from.” The music isn’t typical blues. It’s a reggae vamp pumped up to rock volume, with blues licks spiraling between the vocal lines. Clark claims what he has earned: righteous, defensive and stand-your-ground belligerent. The sound of the album conjures the impact of Clark’s live band. It’s dense, sweaty, overdriven, bristling and unkempt, full of live-wire loose ends. It’s also, in most songs, a studio illusion. Clark produced the album along with Jacob Sciba, his engineer turned co-producer. And the credits of most songs reveal that Clark not only sings and plays guitar, as he does onstage, but also supplies keyboards and programming, abetted by a drummer and a bassist. His songwriting dips into funk, R&B, reggae, metal, arena-rock and hip-hop, and he often embeds song samples and drum-machine sounds in his mixes. Clark hasn’t tried to dwell in any purist blues past. He doesn’t hide his musical models. He harks back to foot-stomping country blues in “The Governor,” a sardonic take on the justice system, and in the lovelorn “Dirty Dishes Blues,” proving his command of blues essentials. He forges direct links from the Ramones to Chuck Berry to the Rolling Stones in “Gotta Get Into Something,” a burst of insomniac adrenaline. His falsetto vocals in “Feed the Babies” and “Pearl Cadillac” echo Curtis Mayfield and Prince, as he sings about parental responsibility and about his own gratitude to his mother. “I Got My Eyes on You” emerges from a roiling caldron of organ and guitar, like early Santana, to pledge unswerving love. And “Feelin’ like a Million,” which follows its opening lines — “Friday night and I just got paid/I’m out looking for some trouble” — toward an ill-advised fling, turbocharges a reggae beat with stabs of distorted guitar and flickers of trap high-hats. Yet each stylistic choice draws on the spirit of the blues: its strength and tribulation, its defiance and self-questioning, its cantankerousness and pain. “Don’t Wait Til Tomorrow” is a remorseful R&B ballad: a denial of infidelity that leads to a confession and a plea to stay together that comes to realize it’s too late. Latin percussion and a string arrangement pull it back toward the 1970s; power chords reinforce its desperate chorus, and Clark plays only a brief, unflashy guitar solo, a futile appeal. The track is at once classic and contemporary; it’s laced with a pitched-up sample of the words “Baby please!” That sample, however, comes from the Mississippi bluesman Elmore James. It’s one more way Clark insists that the past has everything to do with the present. "
5c66ee4f3a125f5075c09f1c,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/15/style/christian-tierney-music-photographer-dublin.html,"Age: 22 Hometown: Dublin Now Lives: in a three-bedroom house in Lucan, a suburb of Dublin, and on various tour buses. Claim to Fame: Mr. Tierney is a self-taught photographer and videographer who has toured with Niall Horan (a former member of One Direction) and Hailee Steinfeld, and has photographed top music acts including Drake, the Weeknd, Demi Lovato, Kendrick Lamar and the 1975.  In January, Mr. Tierney was nominated for an iHeartRadio Music Award for tour photography. “I just try to understand people,” he said. “Every time I shoot somebody new, I take a different approach. You have to work out how to show their personality in a visual way.” Big Break: At 15, Mr. Tierney started a YouTube channel on which he interviewed and showcased live sessions with emerging Irish musicians and others. “I always had a good ear for picking who the next big artists were going to be,” he said.  To book talent, he would cold-email managers whose artists were touring in Dublin. Macklemore and Ryan Lewis, then an unknown hip-hop act from Seattle, were among the first to say yes. When their 2012 hit, “Thrift Shop,” made them famous, it was easier for Mr. Tierney to book other artists, like James Bay, who recorded a video for “Let It Go” on the channel. Latest Project: Mr. Tierney spent much of last year traveling in Europe and America for Mr. Horan’s “Flicker” tour. During the summer, he photographed Ms. Steinfeld’s shows. Though touring may seem glamorous from afar, there’s little time for sightseeing.  “When you wake up, you’re on tour, and you’re working until you go to bed that night,” he said. “Technically I’ve been to Sweden, but I haven’t seen anywhere except the inside of the venue.” Next Thing: Next month, Mr. Tierney will join Hozier, an Irish crooner best known for the song “Take Me to Church,” on his American tour. “His show is very rock- and blues-based, which is quite different from the pop tours I did with Hailee and Niall,” Mr. Tierney said. “I saw him play six years ago in Dublin to a small audience, so to see his journey has been amazing.” After the tour, Mr. Tierney plans to move to Los Angeles. On the Pulse: Though he no longer produces live sessions for YouTube, Mr. Tierney still has an eye for breakout talent. This year, he hopes to hear more of Dermot Kennedy, who mixes hip-hop production with traditional Irish songwriting, and Rosalía, a modern flamenco artist from Catalonia, Spain, who has been nominated for six Latin Grammys.  “She has such a unique creative vision and aesthetic that is very much her own,” he said. “I don’t think there’s anybody else who’s doing what she’s doing.” "
5c8bd29149f0eacbf105d4b4,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/15/arts/music/playlist-anderson-paak-sean-paul-j-balvin.html,"Every Friday, pop critics for The New York Times weigh in on the week’s most notable new songs and videos. Just want the music? Listen to the Playlist on Spotify here (or find our profile: nytimes). Like what you hear? Let us know at theplaylist@nytimes.com and sign up for our Louder newsletter, a once-a-week blast of our pop music coverage. The music struts while the lyrics bristle in “King James,” from Anderson .Paak’s album due in April, “Ventura.” The springy bass line and jazzy chords reach back to the analog exuberance of 1970s Stevie Wonder, and like Wonder, Anderson .Paak fuses an optimistic sound with a spirit of determined resistance, alluding to a jumping over wall, Colin Kaepernick and deep-seated racial hostility. As party whistles blow, an exuberant chorus joins him to sing, “O.K. now, just don’t stay down/Let’s go shake down until we get what we need.” JON PARELES A conceptual tour-de-force that lands with the force of a dance track, Holly Herndon’s “Eternal” is as propulsive as it is disorienting. She built it with other human singers and with artificial-intelligence software that manipulated her own vocals all over the place. A choir of women’s voices, harmonizing and ricocheting in counterpoint that could be Balkan or extraterrestrial, heaves above a booming drumbeat and bursts of synthesizer, landing hard together and then veering apart, with barely intelligible lyrics that clear for phrases like “too much to be contained.” The video shows Herndon crowned in motion-capture sensors and other women’s faces flickering in and out of focus, as software struggles to digitize and contain the complexities of flesh. PARELES Sean Paul, from Jamaica, and J Balvin, from Colombia, are both masters of the crossover-building strategic alliance. “Contra la Pared” (“Against the Wall”) is a canny, skeletal, all-hook production (by Tainy) that puts Paul squarely on Balvin’s turf. It tops a lean reggaeton beat with flute sounds from Colombia’s Andean traditions, as the two men take turns — with Balvin’s smooth croon and Paul’s rough declamation — exulting in how irresistible he is to a certain woman. Paul switches between English and Spanish; he’s got an eye on changing pop demographics. PARELES Angelique Kidjo’s next album, due April 19, will be “Celia,” a tribute to the Afro-Cuban singer Celia Cruz, and she’s not shying away from any challenges. “Quimbara” was one of Cruz’s signature songs in the 1970s, with high-speed, tongue-twisting lyrics. Backed by Michelle Ndegeocello on bass, the Afrobeat pioneer Tony Allen on drums, Dominic James on guitars and the Gangbe Brass Band, Kidjo reconnects the salsa original to West Africa, layering the song with a tumbling six-beat rhythm, a brass-band undertow and a tangle of scurrying guitar lines while she belts with enough grit to rival Cruz herself. PARELES RuthAnne Cunningham, an Irish singer and songwriter credited on hits from JoJo, Britney Spears and Westlife, uses vintage soul materials for “Love Again.” She tops the sturdy gospel chords from “People Get Ready” (and countless other songs) with a familiar pop premise: that her love can rescue a man from his heartbroken misery. There’s an aching, unpredictable rawness in her voice that makes the classic plea work one more time. PARELES Dwight Trible’s big, open baritone might sound to you like a wake-up call, or an entire universe yawning. (You won’t be yawning yourself.) He sings spiritual jazz with a light redolence of Andy Bey, and a heap of gospel’s influence. By now he’s considered an elder on the Los Angeles jazz scene, and in addition to running one of the city’s most influential community venues he has figured prominently into both of Kamasi Washington’s most recent albums; he’s also a member of in Pharoah Sanders’ band. Trible’s 2017 solo album, “Inspirations,” was unjustly overlooked — hopefully the same won’t be true of “Mothership,” out Friday. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO Kindly sentiments — “I never want to see you cry/I only want to see you shine” — arrive amid frantic rhythms in “Frens” by Obongjayar, a Nigerian singer and songwriter based in England whose voice puts a hoarse urgency atop a gentle core. Rooted in Afrobeat, the track pulls drums, bells, guitars, horns and more into a feverish affirmation that ends too soon. PARELES Charli XCX’s 2014 album “Sucker” was a fistful of sassy, punky pop. And while the British singer and songwriter has been steadily moving away from that sound in her own work, there’s still a spot for it in her heart — and on her Vroom Vroom Recordings label imprint. Enter Nasty Cherry, a four-piece band whose first track, “Win,” was co-written by Charli and produced by Justin Raisen, who contributed to “Sucker” as well as Sky Ferreira’s like-minded 2013 LP “Night Time, My Time.” The vibe is ’90s angst rock welded to a Sia-esque chorus, and it is indeed a winner. CARYN GANZ A chronicle of multiple romances and/or obsessions, from childhood crush to high-school infatuation to post-breakup rationalizations, “Never (Let You Go)” is two or three songs in five minutes by Deanté Hitchcock, an Atlanta rapper who sometimes slips into singing. Behind him, a slinky trap track segues into an even slower vamp that carries breathlessly accelerating but crafty rhymes: “Can’t waste my time thinkin’ ’bout all the time wasted.” His lyrics conclude, “I learned to let you go,” followed by an instrumental coda on solo piano, a quiet elegy to all the tumult. PARELES Frankie Cosmos is releasing two tracks each week from her digital album “Haunted Items,” beginning with “Dancing” and “Tunnel.” They are miniatures, less than two minutes each, and decidedly bare-bones: just her voice, elementary piano parts and an occasional overdubbed harmony vocal. Obliquely and then with startling directness, both songs consider a broken relationship: “I cry more times a day/than you did in five years,” she suddenly reveals in “Dancing.” PARELES A “duet” for a hologram world: Here’s an exhumed recording of Nat King Cole, who would have been 100 this week, with Gregory Porter’s voice dubbed in. The track begins with the two trading lines over a simple, two-beat rhythm — nice enough — but when Porter tries to weave new harmonies and ad-libs into Cole’s solo part, it all comes undone. RUSSONELLO Vijay Iyer and Craig Taborn represent two different kinds of musical progressives. Both are pianists associated with the avant-garde, but Taborn, whose playing is more ephemeral, is a spectral figure, rarely spotted around the scene unless he’s playing a gig. Iyer seems constantly in the world, leading new bands and curating concert series, snapping up awards, teaching at Harvard and Banff. Each pianist, in his own way, has become about as respected as one can get in jazz. On a new disc, “The Transitory Poems,” they balance each other’s styles, Iyer playing the naturalist and the system-builder to Taborn’s fleeting, fugitive poet. On “Clear Monolith,” a sparse and jittery start gives way to a halting dance before a blues feeling steals in and pulls the two players together. By about the 5:30 mark, they’re playing more notes but sounding more serene. Then it all drops down again, and a new cycle begins. RUSSONELLO "

And to celebrate, the library is issuing 6,000 limited-edition library cards featuring an image of Reed taken by Mick Rock in 1972. The library acquired the archive — a large collection of notes, photographs, and more than 600 hours of recordings — after the rocker’s wife, Laurie Anderson, decided to share it with an institution that could preserve and showcase it. Before Reed died in 2013, he had never discussed what to do with his belongings, Anderson said in a phone interview. A part of her wanted to hold onto them, but another part of her thought those traces of Reed should be accessible to young musicians and anyone interested in the history of the man behind the sunglasses. Plus, there were so many books and profiles out there that had tried to define the musician. “It’s very important to be able to present raw material and let people make up their own minds,” Anderson said. [Read more about treasures at the New York Public Library.] Fans may rush to concert posters or his personal collection of LPs, but Anderson said his drawings about tai chi are particularly interesting. “A lot of people don’t actually realize the importance of that in his life,” she added. New York always found its way into the musician’s songs. And with this archive, Anderson said, “He’s become a part of the city, in a way.” "
5c3f770b3a125f5075c04c03,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/16/arts/music/james-blake-assume-form-review.html,"Love is a murky, uncertain, only sporadically blissful thing on James Blake’s fourth album, “Assume Form.” But sometimes it manages to break through his chronic melancholy. He needs the changeup, because echoes of his own past are his toughest competition. Since the release of his self-titled debut album in 2011, Blake’s style has made a thoroughly improbable conquest of pop’s commercial mainstream, seeping into hip-hop, R&B and rock. Beyoncé, Frank Ocean, Kanye West, Kendrick Lamar and Anderson .Paak chose him as a collaborator, and streaming blockbusters like Post Malone, Future and Juice WRLD have clearly learned from his vocabulary of oozy, slow-motion chords, electronically wobbled vocals and transitions that crumble and lurch into new configurations. Before his debut album, Blake had made a reputation as a club D.J. playing and producing fractured, aggressively disorienting British dubstep tracks. But “James Blake” turned his music radically inward. He constructed ballads around sparse keyboard chords and his sustained, doleful, androgynous voice, hovering in imaginary space and punctuated by tense silences. He was, he told The Guardian in 2016, “copying dubstep rhythms but using gospel-tinged, classically tinged keyboard playing.” But he was doing more than that. For all his debts to British dubstep and to the moody desolation of hip-hop auteurs like RZA (who was a guest on Blake’s 2013 album, “Overgrown”), Blake had found a way to create a charged stillness, a forsaken fortress of solitude. His music suited an era of disembodied digital interactions, at once instantaneous and physically distant. With “Assume Form,” Blake wants to get closer. His previous albums were suffused with loneliness; this one, tentatively and almost incredulously, ponders intimacy. In the album’s title song, Blake sings about choosing to become embodied: “I’ll leave the ether/I will assume form,” he croons. “I will be touchable by her/I will be reachable.” The track fluctuates gorgeously, juxtaposing loops of piano that are soothing and vaguely ominous, and only settling into a beat about halfway through, like a ghost gradually solidifying. [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] The album is full of gratitude and affectionate apologies. “Into the Red” marvels at a woman’s financial generosity, over a track that dwindles from a string-ensemble arrangement to tiny, plinking tones. “Can’t Believe the Way We Flow,” built on a rapturous sample from the R&B vocal group the Manhattans and produced with Oneohtrix Point Never, revels in sensuality that makes the singer “waive my fear of self.” In “Power On,” he lists his delusions of separateness and self-sufficiency — “I thought you were second place to every song” — only to return to a refrain: “I was wrong.” Blake rarely lets his music feel too secure. He still makes pitches waver and rhythms dissolve; he switches texture with sudden, surreal edits. In two songs, he collaborates with the producer Metro Boomin and guest vocalists: Travis Scott in “Mile High” and Moses Sumney in “Tell Them.” But he calmly destabilizes Metro Boomin’s trap rhythms, entangling them with flute sounds in “Mile High” and fitfully swapping them for flamenco handclaps in “Tell Them.” Well aware of how widely imitated he is, Blake offers some other surprises; if it were in a different musical guise, the borderline stalker-ish “I’ll Come Too” could almost be a Tin Pan Alley ballad. Like the rest of Blake’s albums, “Assume Form” opens into haunted, rewarding depths. All that’s missing is one luminous, fully focused pop chorus, like “Retrograde” on Blake’s 2013 “Overgrown” or “My Willing Heart” on his 2016 “The Colour in Anything.” This album comes closest in “Barefoot in the Park,” a duet with the Spanish singer Rosalía that, despite its minor key and somber descending chords, celebrates togetherness and how “You start rubbing off on me.” Perhaps Blake couldn’t bring himself to write something as clichéd as a hit-seeking pop love song. "
5c9ccde649f0eacbf105f878,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/28/arts/music/billie-eilish-debut-album.html,"LOS ANGELES — Even before she turned 17 in December, the singer Billie Eilish had accomplished nearly all of the modern prerequisites for pop stardom and then some: Her homemade songs, written only with her older brother, had been streamed more than a billion times on digital platforms; she’d played increasingly large sold-out concerts to delirious fans (and their patient parents); appeared with Ellen DeGeneres and Jimmy Fallon; and collected some 15 million followers on Instagram. Among those legions, many had already started to adopt the musician’s striking visual aesthetic: performatively dead eyes (bored, at best), hair dyed in shades of electric blue and pale purple, an all-baggy anti-silhouette — a collective middle finger to the strictures of teen-pop sex appeal. While still drawing befuddled stares from those outside of her demographic, Eilish’s mere presence has been known to get a certain subset of teenager hyperventilating — and spending hundreds of dollars on merchandise Eilish designed herself. What the musician didn’t have along the way — and, to her credit, didn’t need — was the lightning strike of a memeable moment or a megahit, the most surefire ways to get noticed (and, potentially, soon forgotten) in today’s avalanche of content. In fact, only now, three years after the music industry caught a whiff of Eilish’s extremely fresh blood, was she even getting around to releasing her debut album. [“When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?” redefines teen-pop stardom. Read the NYT review.] “When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?,” out Friday via Darkroom/Interscope, marks the latest apex in Eilish’s fairy tale career, and it’s likely to cement her growing reputation as a 21st century music business unicorn who embodies all the creative and commercial promise of online youth culture. It might also make her a household name. To speak to her business team and label bosses is to hear the phrase “the biggest artist in the world” repeatedly, and in earnest, as a near-term goal. Dave Grohl, whose daughters are obsessed with Eilish, could only compare her to his old band: “The same thing is happening with her that happened with Nirvana in 1991,” he told a music business conference recently, holding up Eilish’s tough-to-categorize music as proof that “rock ’n’ roll is not even close to being dead.” The hip-hop producer Timbaland called this year, and next, hers for the taking. “I do not see a ceiling,” said Brandon Goodman, one of Eilish’s managers. No pressure. “I can’t even tell you how anxious I’ve been to get this album out,” Eilish said in her parents’ tiny kitchen earlier this month. Self-possessed but entirely a teenager, with one ASAP Rocky shoe propped on the table and gothic rings on every finger, Eilish talks like an Instagram caption come to life — everything is “fire” or “trash,” bro, and she is always “deadass.” Her look is Hot Topic by way of hypebeast; in photos, a smile is rare, though searing eye contact from her ice-blue alien saucers is common. Ahead of her album, Eilish was taking stock of her atypical adolescence, and acknowledging the fact that for all of the attention she’d garnered thus far, her ride into the mainstream was about to kick into a new gear. “For a minute, I could go somewhere nobody knew who I was — maybe at Costco or something,” she said. “I would go places and try to convince myself I wasn’t faaamous or whatever.” But the last bits of her anonymity have been fading; the day prior, she’d been recognized four times while walking two blocks home, forcing her to come to terms with a fast-approaching reality. “There’s no other choice for me,” she said. “I literally have to.” What Eilish and her cadre of surrounding adults hope will differentiate her from decades-worth of precocious, fast-burning teen stars before her is twofold: autonomy and familial support. [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] Building on the paths cut not just by Lorde, Lana Del Rey and Halsey, but Brockhampton, Odd Future and the Weeknd, Eilish is an artist-as-creative director, building her own layered universe for fans to obsess over through a unified flow of music, videos, social media and staging. Musically, she combines most of the internet-first ideas of this century — EDM drops, sad-girl bedroom confessions, SoundCloud rap abandon — into an edgy, genre-agnostic (but playlist-friendly) fusion that sounds like pop and streams like hip-hop. (Instead of one runaway single, Eilish has eight different songs with more than 140 million plays on Spotify.) She insists on near-complete control. “I could easily just be like, you know what, you’re going to pick out my clothes, someone else will come up with my video treatments, someone else will direct them and I won’t have anything to do with them,” Eilish said. “Someone else write my music, someone else produce it, and I won’t say anything about it. Someone else run my Instagram.” “Everything could be easier if I wanted it to,” she continued. “But I’m not that kind of person and I’m not that kind of artist. And I’d rather die than be that kind of artist.” Billie Eilish is also, in many ways, a family business. The songs are written and produced by Eilish and her 21-year-old brother, Finneas, who often opens for her and plays as her backing band. The pair record almost exclusively in their comfortably cluttered childhood bedrooms, never far from their parents, Maggie Baird and Patrick O’Connell, long-toiling actors who pieced together bit parts, regional theater and voice-over work. These days, Baird tours as Eilish’s assistant, but is really more like her chief of staff, all mom and part manager (but without the commission). O’Connell, who also did handiwork and carpentry, is now part of the tour crew, and has gone from driving the van in the leaner days to lighting director. Yet somehow, the cloud of stage-parent oppression seems absent, which isn’t to say that this Partridge Family for the Instagram age wasn’t partially by design. The children were home-schooled, O’Connell said, in part because Finneas was born the same year as the smash hit “MMMBop” by Hanson, a trio of brothers. “I was completely swept away by these kids,” O’Connell recalled. “They were religious Oklahoma home-schooled, but nonetheless. Clearly what had happened was they’d been allowed to pursue the things that they were interested in.” Though not much of a musician herself, Baird eventually taught both children in a beginner’s songwriting class, using touchstones like the Beatles, and the kids were generally encouraged to follow their passions; college was never the goal. (They were also raised vegetarian and slept in a four-person family bed until Finneas was about 10; more recently, the parents took the living room of their two-bedroom, one-bath nest.) Eilish was initially drawn to dance, horseback riding and singing in the Los Angeles Children’s Chorus. But she was primarily a D.I.Y. aesthete, building costumes and crafts from scratch and rallying friends for her elaborate projects. “I was unbelievably bossy,” Eilish said. (Her lifelong friend Zoe Donahoe chimed in from nearby: “She just knew what she wanted.”) Finneas committed to music first, but when he enlisted a 13-year-old Eilish to sing “Ocean Eyes,” a song he’d written for his band, the family’s lives were forever altered. The siblings uploaded the track to SoundCloud for Eilish’s dance teacher to choreograph to, but it took off, fueled by unofficial remixes and algorithm magic, drumming up industry intrigue. By the summer of 2016, Eilish had signed to Darkroom, a marketing company-turned-boutique label run by 28-year-old Justin Lubliner, in partnership with Interscope Records. John Janick, the chief executive of Interscope, recalled of Eilish: “Her sense of style, how she thinks, the way she talks — everything about her was just different. She had such a strong point of view, especially for being 14 years old.” Lubliner envisioned her as “a new breed of pop star,” and was unconcerned with competition from more traditional singers like Selena Gomez and Camila Cabello. Instead of pushing “Ocean Eyes,” which goes down easy as vaguely R&B indie-pop, to Top 40 radio, Eilish’s team vowed to move slower and more deliberately. “We didn’t want it to be about a song,” said Goodman, who with Danny Rukasin manages Eilish and Finneas. “We never wanted anything to be bigger than Billie the artist.” The label released a nine-track EP, “Don’t Smile at Me,” the next summer, in addition to a steady stream of one-off songs, and watched as each grew exponentially. Although rappers frequently break online, leaving radio to catch up (or not), the holistic, streaming-first path was largely unprecedented for an aspiring pop heavyweight at the time. “For the past two years, people have been like, ‘Whoa, this came out of nowhere overnight!’” said Goodman. Along the way, Eilish has developed into a much stranger, more unique artist than initially promised. Though her voice is pure, her lyrical themes are angsty and bleak — serial killers, domination, monsters under the bed — and on her new album, she favors wobbly beats, jarring turns and creepy sound effects, which flow seamlessly with her visual aesthetic on social media and in her videos. Veering sharply into abject, “American Horror Story” aesthetics, Eilish has bled jet-black liquid from her eye sockets, let a tarantula crawl across her face, and been manhandled and stabbed with needles by disembodied hands, invoking shock artists like Nine Inch Nails and Marilyn Manson more than Taylor Swift or Katy Perry. Crucially, Eilish has also absorbed an at times cartoonish, outlaw essence from the world of rap — without actually trying to rap. Eilish cites Tyler, the Creator, Childish Gambino and the influencer Bloody Osiris as her guiding lights of self-presentation, and her music incorporates now-ubiquitous elements of trap production without feeling forced. “Everyone needs to give hip-hop credit — everyone in the world right now,” Eilish said. “Whatever you’re doing, you’ve been influenced by hip-hop.” Still, she’s a well-adjusted teenager and her core audience remains young women, offering them an original vantage on the rebellions du jour. “Xanny,” a standout from Eilish’s new album, takes on the SoundCloud generation’s dependency of choice — benzos and opioids — with concern and scorn: “I don’t need a xanny to feel better,” she sings. “Don’t give me a xanny now or ever.” She was matter-of-fact about already being a role model. “I completely recognize the responsibility, and I do think about it,” Eilish said. “But it’s not going to change the way that I am.” So far, she has largely managed to avoid the trapdoors of internet controversy that often accompany viral notoriety — something Eilish said she has had nightmares about. But with the increasing heat of fame comes more micro-scrutiny, as Eilish got a taste of recently with the release of the song “Wish You Were Gay.” (Lyrics: “To give your lack of interest an explanation/don’t say I’m not your type/just say that I’m not your preferred sexual orientation.”) “I really tried hard, dude,” she said, responding to the small-scale backlash. “I thought it was so clear that it wasn’t meant as an insult. But I understand it’s a sensitive word for people.” She bristled more at mention of her friendship with the young rapper XXXTentacion, who was murdered last year but previously drew condemnation for allegations of domestic abuse. In the kitchen at home, her mother called, half-jokingly, for Eilish’s publicist in the other room. “I want to be able to mourn, I don’t want to be shamed for it,” said Eilish, who performed a tribute song following XXXTentacion’s death. “I don’t think I deserve getting hate for loving someone that passed.” No one chimed in to coach her. Flanked at all times by her family, Eilish felt sturdy, if a bit jaded, in anticipation of the ways her life would continue to change in the coming months — harder questions, greater expectations, less privacy. Earlier, her brother had described the surreality of Eilish’s rise as “an autonomous thing, and it’s moving forward really fast, and we’re all on it.” Her father chimed in: “It’s a train, or a river, or a vortex, and we’re all flying down.” Finneas added: “But traveling it safely feels much easier than trying to bail out.” Eilish agreed, and said she was working on being in the moment while also keeping perspective, motivated especially by the promise of larger and larger concerts, which have become near-religious experiences for her fans. She flicked nervously at a lighter, singeing a cactus on the table in front of her. “I’m realizing the place I’m in right now is kind of my time, though — my moment,” she said. “These are the good old days.” "
5c2d391c3a125f5075c02977,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/02/obituaries/ray-sawyer-dead.html,"Ray Sawyer, who cut a distinctive figure as a member of the band Dr. Hook and the Medicine Show thanks to his flamboyant style and attention-drawing eye patch, and who sang lead on one of the group’s best-known songs, “The Cover of Rolling Stone,” died on Monday in Daytona, Fla. He was 81. His wife, Linda Lombardi Sawyer, announced his death on Facebook. She did not give a cause but said in a post a week earlier that he had been hospitalized. Mr. Sawyer and the band rose to prominence in the early 1970s with a country-rock sound that later became more lush and occasionally even displayed a disco influence. Dennis Locorriere usually sang lead, but Mr. Sawyer was the most recognizable band member. His eye patch gave the group its name, a sort of skewing of the Captain Hook character from “Peter Pan.” “I’ve had the eye patch since I was 27,” Mr. Sawyer told The St. Petersburg Times in 2010. “I was in a car accident. Some people still ask if it is a gimmick, something to draw attention, but it’s real.” He sang the lead vocal on “Rolling Stone.” (The label of the original single gave the title as “The Cover of Rolling Stone,” though the lyrics he sings use a “the” before the magazine’s name.) The song, a parody about rock ’n’ roll fame, reached the Top 10 of the Billboard pop chart in March 1973. That same month, the magazine did in fact put the band, or at least a caricature of it, on its cover. Ray Sawyer was born on Feb. 1, 1937, in Chickasaw, Ala. Dr. Hook and the Medicine Show was formed in the late 1960s in New Jersey and caught fire after it joined with Shel Silverstein, the cartoonist and sometime songwriter, and played his songs in the 1971 movie “Who Is Harry Kellerman and Why Is He Saying Those Terrible Things About Me?” (directed by Ulu Grosbard and starring Dustin Hoffman). The movie got the band a contract with Columbia Records. Mr. Silverstein, who died in 1999, wrote “Sylvia’s Mother,” a lament about a pay-phone call that in 1972 became the group’s first big hit. It may or may not have been a parody of country ballads, but “The Cover of Rolling Stone,” also written by Mr. Silverstein, was certainly a gag. “We take all kinds of pills that give us all kind of thrills,” the lyrics went, “but the thrill we’ve never known is the thrill that’ll gitcha when you get your picture on the cover of the Rolling Stone.” By the mid-1970s the band had been derailed by mismanagement and was facing bankruptcy. “Somebody was putting the cash away, and it wasn’t us,” Mr. Sawyer told The Toronto Star in 1991. “The bankruptcy court took everything away from us, even the ‘Medicine Show’ part of our name. I haven’t figured out yet why they did that. It’s like taking the Pips out of Gladys Knight and the Pips.” But by 1976 the band, as simply Dr. Hook, was on the comeback trail with a smoother sound, heard that year on a cover of Sam Cooke’s “Only Sixteen.” Later hits included “When You’re in Love With a Beautiful Woman” in 1979. Mr. Sawyer left the group in 1982, and he and Mr. Locorriere later engaged in a legal tussle over rights to the group’s name. Mr. Sawyer continued to perform into this decade. A full list of survivors was not immediately available. "
5caf8a8249f0eacbf1f82ff8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/arts/music/lil-nas-x-old-town-road-country-rap.html,"Over the last few weeks, “Old Town Road” — a strutting and lightheartedly comedic country-rap tune by the previously unknown 20-year-old rapper Lil Nas X — has lived an improbable number of lives. It began as a Hail Mary pass by a college dropout hoping music might save him from having to go back to school. But in the way that the internet can rapidly make and remake something, morphing meaning in real time, Lil Nas X’s track became something different almost every few days on its path from SoundCloud obscurity to pop ubiquity: a savvy troll, a manipulator of streaming algorithms, a meme theme, a battering ram to genre barriers, a trigger of music-biz discord, a David suffering at the hands of Goliath, a sociocultural rallying point, and eventually, a site of cross-cultural kumbaya. [Listen to a history of country-rap in 29 songs.] And now, it’s likely to be one of the most emblematic songs of the year: On April 8, “Old Town Road” became the No. 1 song in the country, capping a startling ascent that demonstrates what can happen when viral engineering meets lightning-rod controversy meets the pop uncanny. For its first 25 seconds, “Old Town Road” could be any other rural lament, a lonely howl delivered over a plucked ukulele. It’s only when the trap drums kick in and the vocals change from singing to quasi-ironic rapping that the song’s true intentions come to the fore. It’s a genre-hybrid exercise — a hip-hop song with country-themed subject matter, partly rapped and partly sung in an exaggerated honky-tonk accent — and also a comedy sketch. The way Lil Nas X overaccentuates his vowels and makes them wobble is a caricature of stoic drawl, and when he raps “cowboy hat from Gucci, Wrangler on my booty,” it’s both confident boast and funny fantasy. It’s also a neat distillation of how genre is currently lived in American pop music: fluidly, with styles and ideas up for grabs by creators and easily slipped on and off by listeners, with varying degrees of sincerity. Pop, more than ever, is an identity playground. [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] But the particular alchemy of “Old Town Road” also taps something deeper: more than two decades of dialogue between country music and hip-hop, genres that have been slowly but consistently finding common heritage, swapping structural elements and taking comfort in each other’s sounds. But the industry’s gatekeepers are less interested in this mutability. For decades, Nashville has essentially framed and marketed the rural experience as white — despite and in defiance of the deep black roots of country music. So when an artist like Lil Nas X — who is black, and raps, and is from Atlanta, with no ties to the country music business — lays claim to rural aesthetics, even in a way that’s partly tongue in cheek, it causes real disruption. In late March, “Old Town Road” appeared on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart before it was removed for being deemed insufficiently country, causing a furor. But resistance led to embrace: a remix of the song featuring Billy Ray Cyrus, which in turn has been played by some country radio stations, which helped the song land on Billboard’s Country Airplay chart. “Old Town Road” — the original or the remix — is by no means the first country-rap crossover. There have been collaborations across genre lines, like Nelly and Tim McGraw’s “Over and Over”; songs in which country singers rap, like Jason Aldean’s “Dirt Road Anthem” and Blake Shelton’s “Boys ’Round Here”; and performances that are fully genre flexible, like Sam Hunt’s “Take Your Time.” And hip-hop has flirted with country signifiers on and off since the 1980s, whether it was the fringe-outfitted rapper Cowboy from the Furious Five, or Kool Moe Dee’s — and later, Will Smith’s — excursion to the “Wild Wild West.” By the 1990s, Southern rap was flourishing, providing a platform for ideas, accents and sounds that weren’t part of hip-hop from the coasts. Crooked Lettaz from Mississippi, 8Ball & MJG from Tennessee, UGK from Texas and many more emphasized drawling flows and production that leaned toward Southern soul and sometimes blues. Around the turn of the century, a pair of young white rappers, Bubba Sparxxx and Colt Ford, were beginning to work with Shannon Houchins, a producer in the Atlanta rap innovator Jermaine Dupri’s camp. Houchins would go on to produce most of “Dark Days, Bright Nights,” Sparxxx’s independent debut album, which got him signed to the major label Interscope and partnered with the producer Timbaland, who steered country-rap to its first big breakthrough moment: Sparxxx’s single “Ugly,” a hip-hop and pop hit with a video that included a pig sty and a tractor race, and went to No. 15 on the Billboard Hot 100. Sparxxx’s follow-up album, “Deliverance,” was a stunning and elegant cross-genre statement radically unlike anything that had preceded it. It made less of a broad impact, but in the wake of Sparxxx’s innovations came a wave of artists who effectively identified as country rappers focused on rural storytelling and signifiers — growing up far from cities, partying at mud bogs and so on. The seeds were also planted for what was to be Nashville’s first extended flirtation with hip-hop. Kid Rock, an early white rapper, remade himself as a country-rock rapper-singer. Tim McGraw partnered with Nelly on “Over and Over,” a road ballad that went to No. 3 on the Hot 100 in 2004. Kenny Rogers collaborated with both Wyclef Jean and Coolio. Even Willie Nelson appeared on a hip-hop song. And in Nashville, the MuzikMafia emerged, a polyglot group of performers that included the singing duo Big & Rich and the rapper Cowboy Troy, who collaborated on several songs, including the single “I Play Chicken With the Train,” which in 2005 became the first country-rap song to land on the Billboard Country Songs chart. These were outliers, or novelties — brief successes that Nashville tolerated but didn’t wholeheartedly embrace. But at around the same time, Houchins teamed up with Ford to form Average Joes Entertainment, a record label devoted to the intersection of country and rap centered on white rural experiences, with a growing stable of burly gool-ol’-boy rappers — “hick-hop,” it was occasionally called — operating largely outside the country music mainstream, though Ford regularly collaborated with the genre’s stars. [A godfather of country-rap on his 2000s hits and Lil Nas X.] By the early 2010s, Nashville was in search of raw energy. The music became more rural, rougher at the edges and more willing to flaunt a range of influences. These younger singers — Jason Aldean, Luke Bryan — often made it plain that hip-hop was as much of their musical heritage as country or Southern rock. That lineage was cemented when, in 2010, Aldean covered “Dirt Road Anthem,” a song originally recorded by Ford and Brantley Gilbert; his version went to No 1. on the country chart and No. 7 on the Hot 100. It opened the floodgates — Blake Shelton rapped a little, Bryan danced to hip-hop songs onstage, the duo Florida Georgia Line built a career on importing just the faintest hint of hip-hop percussion and slang. Their song “Cruise” became one of the biggest hits of 2013, bolstered by a remix featuring, who else, Nelly. That there’s a splash of hip-hop coursing through country (its male performers, at least) is now fundamentally accepted, but always with the country performer — and the country music business — in control of just how much. Nothing, though, is immune from the force and urgency of the meme economy, and Lil Nas X has demonstrated himself to be a master of how to pachinko his way from the margins to the mainstream. “Old Town Road” began on SoundCloud, where he tagged it as country to avoid competing with the hip-hop heavyweights that dominate the platform. Once it began to get noticed, he pushed it heavily on TikTok, the short-performance-clip app, where it was the soundtrack to thousands of videos. The track also arrived at a fortuitous moment — on the heels of a trickle of Western aesthetics into the high-style universe over the last couple of years, and also following the success of stylistically diverse country performers like Kacey Musgraves, who have demonstrated that a country musician can be a beacon of cool far outside the genre’s walls. Even Kanye West recently took to the countryside, unveiling his last album at a Wyoming cowboy ranch. In another moment, the aesthetic choices of “Old Town Road” might have been perceived as pure kitsch, but now they are kitsch with a side of tastemaker. And though the removal of the song from the country chart reflected an initial resentment, the mood soon switched. Some country singers said they found “Old Town Road” to be country, or country enough. They didn’t want to be on the wrong side of cool. Billy Ray Cyrus, who joined the song’s remix, is not a country insider at the peak of his powers, but he’s still a performer with a great deal of resonance within Nashville thanks to his 1992 pop-country crossover smash “Achy Breaky Heart.” Cyrus’s “Old Town Road” verse is pure glitz, a blend of hip-hop braggadocio and country-boy-in-the-big-city awe: “Spent a lot of money on my brand-new guitar/Baby’s got a habit, diamond rings and Fendi sports bras/Ridin’ down Rodeo in my Maserati sports car.” The performance is effortless, showing a version of country music that’s cosmopolitan, flexible and self-aware. Whether Cyrus’s co-sign will be enough for the industry side of Nashville to embrace “Old Town Road” remains to be seen. That’s because, when it comes to charts and common practices, country isn’t a genre or a set of sounds as much as it is an oligarchy, the product of a limited number of record labels; a media environment that relies heavily on radio (with programmers who can lack imagination, as female country performers have long known); and a profound bottleneck in terms of new talent and new ideas. (To be fair, country is not alone in this: In 2012, the K-pop novelty star Psy went to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Rap Songs chart with “Gangnam Style,” which was — and remains — one of the biggest viral YouTube songs in history, but was by no means a rap song in the American context.) Nashville’s initial resistance suggests some unfortunate things about country as a genre: that it might not be able to make fun of itself; that it might look askance at outsiders, especially black performers; that it understands itself only through the lens of protecting its central ideology, and not as an omnivorous sound in dialogue with the rest of pop, and the rest of America. Country music is preoccupied with borders, and it treats each new incursion as an opportunity for identity crisis. It’s a wild contrast with contemporary hip-hop, which understands itself as music that borrows widely, and experiments with glee. But perhaps the greatest indictment of how the country music leadership handled “Old Town Road” comes from a cursory listen to some other songs on the chart. Take “Look What God Gave Her,” the new single by Thomas Rhett, perhaps the ur-country gentleman of the last few years. It’s a soft soul song with a faint disco undertow, nothing country about it beyond the perceived affiliation of the performer. Elsewhere there are soft-rock ballads and R&B songs, none of them subject to anything like the skepticism that has greeted Lil Nas X, whose reference points might in fact be more classically country (even if refracted through a kitsch lens). Which means that the Lil Nas X controversy boils down to a conversation about who is entitled to lay public claim to Southern tropes that country music believes it has monopolized (but in truth, has been less and less reliant on in recent years). That it’s happening at a moment featuring more black country music performers than any in recent memory — Darius Rucker, Kane Brown, Jimmie Allen, Mickey Guyton and many more — is especially discouraging. On its own terms, “Old Town Road” has been a wild success. And when it comes the music business’s terms, well, that’s being reverse engineered. Following the Cyrus remix, Lil Nas X teased another with Young Thug. In truth, “Old Town Road” isn’t quite fully country or hip-hop, at least not in the ways those genres taxonomize themselves. It’s something far more slippery, slithering between the two spaces and arriving at pop novelty. This is where songs that have been disowned by their ostensible homes but provide uncomplicated pleasure often land — embraced widely even as they’re kept at arms length locally. But it is too potent to remain that way. It certainly won’t be long before some country singers incorporate it into their live sets. Country stations are beginning to play the song, which serves as a kind of proxy for acceptance. And indeed, Billboard recently announced that it might revisit its decision to include “Old Town Road” on its main country chart — after all, country is as country allows itself to be. "
5c882fcb49f0eacbf105cb6a,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/12/obituaries/hal-blaine-dead.html,"Hal Blaine, the ubiquitous drummer whose work in the 1960s and ’70s with Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, Barbra Streisand, the Beach Boys, Simon & Garfunkel, the Ronettes and many others established him as one of the top session musicians of all time, died on Monday at his home in Palm Desert, Calif. He was 90. His son-in-law, Andy Johnson, confirmed the death. Mr. Blaine, who played on at least 40 singles that reached No. 1 on the Billboard pop chart, was a reliable and adaptable musician, able to offer delicate brushwork on a ballad or a booming beat on records produced by Phil Spector, who was known for his so-called Wall of Sound. Mr. Blaine brought drama to a song’s transitions, often telegraphing a big moment with a flurry of strokes on a snare drum or tom-tom. If he had a signature moment on a record, it was on the Ronettes’ 1963 hit, “Be My Baby,” produced by Mr. Spector. The song opened cold, with Mr. Blaine playing — and repeating — the percussive earworm “Bum-ba-bum-BOOM!” But the riff came about accidentally. “I was supposed to play more of a boom-chicky-boom beat, but my stick got stuck and it came out boom, boom-boom chick,” he told The Wall Street Journal in 2011. “I just made sure to make the same mistake every few bars.” Three years later, he used the same beat, but in a softer way, on Frank Sinatra’s “Strangers in the Night.” Mr. Blaine was part of a loosely affiliated group of session musicians who in the early 1960s began dominating rock ’n’ roll recording in Los Angeles. Along with guitarists like Glen Campbell and Tommy Tedesco, bassists like Carol Kaye and Joe Osborn, and keyboardists like Leon Russell and Don Randi, Mr. Blaine played on thousands of recordings through the mid-1970s. He famously said he gave the group its name, the Wrecking Crew, although Ms. Kaye has insisted that he did not start using that term until years after the musicians had stopped working together. His skills led producers to use Mr. Blaine as the drummer for various groups’ studio work, replacing their credited drummers. The drummer heard on the Beach Boys’ records was often Mr. Blaine and not the drummer the group’s fans knew, Dennis Wilson, whose brother Brian was the band’s creative force. “I must tell you, first of all, Dennis was not really a drummer,” Mr. Blaine told Modern Drummer magazine in 2005. “I mean, they had bought him drums because they needed drums in the group. So he learned as they went on.” Asked if Mr. Wilson was angry that he was replaced in the studio, Mr. Blaine said he was not. “He was thrilled,” he said, “because while I was making Beach Boy records, he was out surfing or riding his motorcycle. During the day, when I was making $35 or $40, that night he was making $35,000” performing live. Mr. Blaine’s other studio credits include Presley’s “Can’t Help Falling in Love,” Simon & Garfunkel’s “Mrs. Robinson,” the 5th Dimension’s “Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In,” the Byrds’ “Mr. Tambourine Man,” Ms. Streisand’s “The Way We Were,” the Crystals’ “Da Doo Ron Ron” and Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass’s “A Taste of Honey.” In 2000, Mr. Blaine was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame with four other studio musicians, including the drummer Earl Palmer, who had helped introduce him to session work. The Recording Academy gave Mr. Blaine a lifetime achievement Grammy Award last year. Hal Blaine was born Harold Simon Belsky on Feb. 5, 1929, in Holyoke, Mass., to Meyer Belsky, who worked in a leather factory, and Rose (Silverman) Belsky. When he was 7 the family moved to Hartford, where he was inspired to learn drumming by watching the fife and drum corps of the Roman Catholic school across the street from his Hebrew school. “One of the priests noticed I was watching, and before long I was playing with these kids,” he told The Hartford Courant in 2000. On Saturdays, he regularly went to a theater in Hartford to watch big bands, singers and vaudeville acts, and he grew to admire virtuoso drummers like Buddy Rich and Gene Krupa. When he was 14, he moved with his family to Southern California. He attended high school in San Bernardino while his parents opened a delicatessen in Santa Monica. After serving as an Army cartographer during the Korean War, Mr. Blaine attended a drum school in Chicago run by Roy C. Knapp, who had been Mr. Krupa’s teacher. He began to play drums in strip clubs, and by the late 1950s he was working with a jazz quartet. He then worked with the teenage idol Tommy Sands and the pop singer Patti Page. He also played briefly with Count Basie’s big band at the Waldorf Astoria in New York, filling in when Mr. Basie’s regular drummer, Sonny Payne, was sick. Until the early 1960s, Mr. Blaine thought of himself as a jazz drummer. But his work in the Los Angeles studios identified him, almost exclusively, as pop music’s go-to session drummer. Once he established himself in the studios, Mr. Blaine rarely performed live. One exception came in the 1960s, when Nancy Sinatra persuaded him to work with her at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas; she put his name on the marquee and arranged for a nanny for his daughter, Michelle. And in the mid-1970s, John Denver brought him on tour. “His favorite time was with John,” Mr. Johnson, Mr. Blaine’s son-in-law, said in a telephone interview. “They were like brothers, and he was really torn up when John passed.” Mr. Denver died in 1997 when the single-engine airplane he was piloting crashed into Monterey Bay in California. Mr. Blaine is survived by his daughter, Michelle Blaine, and seven grandchildren. He was married and divorced five times. Mr. Blaine was far less busy in studios in the 1980s. By then producers were increasingly relying on drum machines, and more self-contained bands insisted on playing their own instruments. He started giving drum clinics and worked on commercial jingles. He played most recently at a party for his 90th birthday at a Los Angeles nightclub. Jim Keltner, a drummer who also became known for his session work, recalled the first time he saw Mr. Blaine play, in the 1960s. “I can hardly describe the effect it had on me,” Mr. Keltner wrote in the foreword to “Hal Blaine & the Wrecking Crew” (1990), an autobiography written with David Goggin. “He was playing a beat I’d heard thousands of times but was giving it a certain kind of sophisticated funk that I’d never heard before.” “How was he able to do these things with his drums?” "
5c2fc4553a125f5075c02e66,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/obituaries/christine-mcguire-dead.html,"Christine McGuire, the eldest of the singing McGuire Sisters, who struck gold on the pop charts in the 1950s with “Sincerely,” “Sugartime” and other close-harmony hits that won young American hearts not quite ready for rock ′n’ roll, died on Dec. 28 at her home in Las Vegas. She was 92. Ms. McGuire’s family confirmed her death in a statement released on Friday. No cause was given. With their identical dresses and hairdos, synchronized movements and sweetly innocent voices, the McGuire Sisters — Christine, Dorothy and Phyllis — were the musical embodiment of popular culture in their day, singing for audiences who watched “Your Hit Parade” on television and listened to Perry Como, Patti Page and the lingering postwar strains of the big band era. After appearing on “Arthur Godfrey’s Talent Scouts” in 1952, the McGuire Sisters soared to national fame. They were regulars on Mr. Godfrey’s morning shows for six years and remained one of the nation’s most popular vocal groups into the 1960s, singing on television, in nightclubs and on records that sold millions, even as teenage rebellion, Elvis Presley and rock ′n’ roll transformed the music world. The fashion-conscious Christine chose the sisters’ matching wardrobes, Dorothy kept track of finances, and Phyllis did most of the talking for the trio. Their million-selling records included two No. 1 hits, “Sincerely” in 1955 and “Sugartime” in 1958. Like other white performers of their generation, they recorded what critics called blander (but often better-selling) covers of rhythm-and-blues hits by black artists. In 1965, Phyllis McGuire’s idealized image was shattered by a grand jury appearance that exposed her longtime affair with a Chicago mobster, Sam Giancana. By then, the sisters’ popularity had begun to fade, and in 1968 the trio broke up, Christine and Dorothy to raise families and Phyllis to perform solo. But they made a successful comeback in 1985, and went on to perform for almost two decades at casinos and clubs in Las Vegas, Atlantic City and elsewhere, capitalizing on the nostalgia of fans who aged with them. Their last gig was a 2004 PBS special, “Magic Moments: The Best of ’50s Pop.” Ruby Christine McGuire was born in Middletown, Ohio, on July 30, 1926, to Asa and Lillie (Fultz) McGuire. Her father was a steelworker and her mother a minister of the First Church of God in Miamisburg, Ohio. Christine, who rarely used her original first name, took piano lessons for eight years. She and her sisters began singing for weddings and other services at their mother’s church in 1935. They later sang at hospitals and military bases. Discovered on local television, they went to New York City and climbed to fame on Mr. Godfrey’s popular TV shows. They had their first Top 10 record, “Good Night, Sweetheart, Goodnight,” in 1954. Christine McGuire was married five times. Her marriage to Harold Ashcraft in 1942 ended in divorce in 1950. They had two sons, Harold and Asa. In 1952 she married John Teeter. They were divorced in 1962. Her 1967 marriage to Robert H. Spain, a financier, also ended in divorce. In 1993 she married George Rosenfeld, a restaurateur, who died in 1996. In 2002 she married David Mudd, a Long Island vintner, who died in 2011. Asa Ashcraft died at 68 in 2015. Dorothy McGuire died in 2012. Ms. McGuire is survived by her son, Harold Ashcraft; her sister, Phyllis; and many grandchildren and great-grandchildren. One grandchild, Cpl. Evan Asa Ashcraft, was killed in the Iraq war in 2003 when an Army vehicle he was in was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade near the northern city of Mosul. The McGuire Sisters performed for Presidents Richard M. Nixon, Gerald R. Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush and for Queen Elizabeth II. They entered the National Broadcasting Hall of Fame in 1994, the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2001 and the Hit Parade Hall of Fame in 2009. "

Let us know at theplaylist@nytimes.com and sign up for our Louder newsletter, a once-a-week blast of our pop music coverage. The Tom Petty archives keep yielding more, like this previously unreleased song about media posturing that rings true in 2019. Tersely and unhurriedly, he rejects posing for magazines or video — and by extension, if he were still alive, social media — to insist, “It was all that rang true/I did it for real and I did it for you.” The arrangement, even though it’s with a full band, is clearly preliminary. If Petty, who died in 2017, had finished it for an album, it would have had more gleam and filigree. But the emotion is irrevocable. JON PARELES Alicia Keys has recorded indelible women’s empowerment songs like “Girl on Fire” and “Superwoman.” But she also understands that changes in gender roles are complicated and constantly in flux — particularly for the mother of two sons. “Raise a Man,” whose co-writers include Terius Nash (The-Dream), is deliberately blurred in every way. It shuns crisp hooks for rippling, improvisational vocal lines; it loops through unresolved chords played by a cloudy string section. It’s a confession of love as vulnerability and connection: “Is it O.K. that I’m not independent?” she sings, “Is it O.K. that I show weakness?” But it’s also clear that she expects equal openness and respect from her partner: “I want what’s coming to me: perfection, protection.” PARELES Pomp and camp, all rolled into one barnstormer. The title track from Lizzo’s forthcoming album is ecstatic, comedic, bawdy and tragic, toggling between powerful blues-soul singing and jubilant, swinging rapping to convey emotion that’s serious and also so unexpected it can’t help but be sort of a laugh, too. JON CARAMANICA “Please Me” begins with all of the R&B from 1990 to 1993 compressed into a rock-hard diamond — signature Bruno Mars nostalgia. Then Cardi B arrives, fresh off her best rap album Grammy win, with her customary saucy salaciousness. Mars grooves and flirts, and Cardi barks demands; even though they had success last year with their first collaboration, the remix of Mars’s “Finesse,” they’re an unlikely pair. Mars is about precision, and Cardi expands to fill the space she’s given, and then some. On this song, the mood is a tug-of-war: breathe fast, then relax, then breathe fast again, then relax. And then it’s done. CARAMANICA Post-punk thrust, math-rock patterns and splintered lyrics mirror the daily dystopian media barrage in “On the Luna,” from “Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost — Part 1,” due March 8, the first of two Foals albums promised this year. Guitar and synthesizer parts overlap in dizzying stereo counterpoint as the 9/4 meter keeps things off-balance; Yannis Philippakis casts himself as a baby boomer singing about childhood memories and present-day regrets. “We had it all and we didn’t stop to think about it,” he realizes. PARELES Les Claypool, from Primus, and Sean Lennon reclaim Beatles (and Monty Python) psychedelia to set out the biography of Jack Parsons, a rocket-science luminary (at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory) who was also a devotee of Aleister Crowley’s Ordo Templi Orientis and its “sex magick” rituals. “Better be careful boys,” Lennon sings. “You just might set the world on fire.” The keyboard tones echo “Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds,” while the extended vocal-harmony coda (singing Crowley’s precepts “Do what thou wilt” and “Love is the law”) hints at “I Want You (She’s So Heavy).” And the video, paying homage to Terry Gilliam’s animations, makes clear just how phallic rockets are. PARELES Nubiyan Twist, a 12-piece band of young Londoners, sources its inspiration widely, from the Caribbean to the Bronx to Central Africa. The group’s guest on “Addis to London” is Mulatu Astatke, the pioneering Ethiopian vibraphonist, another eclectic thinker, who has studied music around the world, and was never content to espouse the traditional sounds or popular music of his homeland. At the start of this track he’s heard explaining the West African roots of the rhythm the band’s about to play. But the sounds of his native country are in there, too, particularly in the tilted minor mode of the harmonies. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO Mortality looms patiently over the folk-rock of “Time Is the Killer.” Rain Phoenix, the sister of the actors Joaquin and River Phoenix, sounds artlessly natural as she sings “Everybody’s lying when we say we’re not afraid,” over a modestly strummed acoustic guitar and a brushed-drums, reverb-laden folk-rock band. Michael Stipe’s occasional backup vocals arrive with fatherly sympathy. The tranquillity is stoic, far from oblivious. PARELES Most likely, you’ll go into a Sons of Kemet show looking forward to Shabaka Hutchings’s tenor saxophone, and you’ll leave buzzing about Theon Cross’s tuba. More than Hutchings, more than its double drummers, it is Cross’s thick, molten playing that pumps life into the upstart British jazz group. Now he is releasing his own album, “Fyah,” full of slamming, dancehall-influenced club tracks, driven by the fireworks between Cross and the drummer Moses Boyd. One piece that sticks out is the chiller “Ciya” — with Cross creating a seductive loop underneath as the alto saxophonist Nubya Garcia and the trombonist Nathaniel Cross, the bandleader’s brother, whisper a gentle sough of a melody. RUSSONELLO Working toward self-forgiveness after a divorce, “Moral of the Story” seesaws between fragility and pomp: from Ashe’s quavery high voice and parlor-song piano tinkling to a hefty, lurching beat and a massed chorus. “People fall in love with the wrong people sometimes,” she tells her mother and her lawyer in the verses. Behind the brave face, there’s still some regret. PARELES The new Avril Lavigne song “Dumb Blonde” — full of blunt horns, hard-slap percussion and lyrics sung in a voice that sounds computer generated — is so chaotic, cluttered and unnatural that when Nicki Minaj arrives two minutes in, she’s a calming force. That said, Minaj’s verse is tepid and tossed-off — perhaps as a reaction to the mayhem that precedes it, or perhaps because she knows well enough when a song will fade into the ether, and no one will remember anyway. CARAMANICA No. Just: no. PARELES Wadada Leo Smith rarely plays the trumpet on “Rosa Parks: Pure Love. An Oratorio of Seven Songs,” a 72-minute suite he composed for an ensemble that’s really many groups in one: three vocalists, four stringed instruments, four trumpets (including Smith), and a duo featuring drums and electronics. On “Rosa Parks: Mercy, Music for Double Quartet,” the strings and brass come together, stretching paper-thin but steely melodies across a lot of open space. Smith states in the press materials that the oratorio is dedicated to a woman “of exceptional courage and wisdom, who made the right move of resistance at the right time.” In that sentence you can almost hear Smith’s music: His slow, deliberate horn playing often sounds like a practice of resistance, and he always knows the right time to act. RUSSONELLO It’s easy for Matthew Shipp’s pelting, centrifugal piano improvisations — full of hard dashes, often in contradictory directions — to feel strident and strong. It’s a bigger feat when he plays toward an emotional middle-range, and on “Flying Saucer” (from a new album, “Signature”) he achieves it, staying around the center of the keyboard, sounding impatient but unruffled. It’s a joy to follow his ardent, two-handed flow, unfolding like a well-told surrealist narrative, and his joyful interactions with the bassist Michael Bisio and the drummer Newman Taylor Baker. RUSSONELLO "

Future’s new album, “The Wizrd” (Freebandz/Epic) — its full title is “Future Hndrxx Presents: The Wizrd” — opened with the equivalent of 126,000 sales in the United States, which includes 144 million streams and 15,000 copies sold as a full album, according to Nielsen. Since Future’s album “DS2” in July 2015, all six albums he has released — including “Evol,” “Future,” “Hndrxx” and “What a Time to Be Alive,” with Drake — have gone to No. 1. According to Billboard, that matches a feat last seen on the chart with John’s six albums from “Honky Château” in spring 1972 through “Rock of the Westies” in fall 1975. Also this week, Maggie Rogers, the former New York University student whose work went viral while still in the classroom, opened at No. 2 with her major-label debut, “Heard It in a Past Life” (Capitol). Although the album’s streaming numbers were modest, at 14 million, a ticket bundle deal helped her move 37,000 copies of the full album. Last week’s top album, A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie’s “Hoodie SZN” — which two weeks ago reached the top with a historically low sales number — fell to No. 3, while the “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse” soundtrack is No. 4, and 21 Savage’s “I Am > I Was” is in fifth place.

5c3451d33a125f5075c03491,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/08/science/volcanos-explosions-lava.html,"When lava meets water, the results are often explosive. Last year, lava from Hawaii’s Kilauea volcano flowed into the ocean, creating bombs of molten rock that were flung into the sky and then smashed into a nearby tourist boat, injuring 23 people.  In 2010, a glacier-covered volcano in Iceland called Eyjafjallajökull erupted and spewed a plume of ash 30,000 feet into the air, causing hundreds of flights in Europe to be grounded. Scientists want to better understand these violent reactions to help prepare communities near volcanoes and bodies of water or groundwater. But doing so at active sites can be impractical. Instead, a team of researchers recently brewed their own backyard lava. “We are not just crazy people mixing and seeing what happens,” said Ingo Sonder, a volcanologist at the University at Buffalo. “We are scientists and we want to quantify, and we do have an idea of what we are doing here.” First, Dr. Sonder and his colleagues got black chunks of ancient solidified lava, called basalt, from a quarry in Texas. They poured about 120 pounds of basalt into a crucible inside a furnace. Over four hours, with a few occasional stirs, the furnace heated the rocks to about 2,400 degrees Fahrenheit, until the basalt became a bubbling molten mix. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] Donning silver thermal suits to protect against the intense heat and radiation, the researchers then poured 10 gallons of glowing goop into a series of insulated steel boxes. The containers varied in size: Some were long and flat, while others were tall and narrow, like a chimney, in order to replicate the types of magma columns found in nature. The walls of the steel containers had injectors designed to spray pressurized water into the piping hot lava. After each contraption was moved a safe distance from the shed that housed the furnace, the scientists initiated a countdown on their computers. Often, the instant the water hit the lava, it exploded, sending a blazing blob about six feet into the air, and a few lava bombs as high as 15 feet. But other times nothing happened, so the researchers used a remotely controlled sledgehammer to knock the container and trigger the blast. The team used high-speed cameras to catch video of the explosions and published the first of their results, still preliminary, last month in the journal JGR-Solid Earth. They plan to continue brewing lava, carrying out the experiment with differently shaped containers and varying amounts of water. “If we have a better idea of what conditions cause these violent lava-water explosions,” said Greg Valentine, a volcanologist at the University at Buffalo and an author on the paper, “then we can do a better job of kind of warning people and mitigating the hazard.” "
5c6ac85a3a125f5075c0a44b,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/18/arts/music/popcast-ryan-adams.html,"For more than two decades, Ryan Adams has been a particular kind of indie-rock tastemaker. Emerging from the alt-country scene of the mid 1990s, he became a prolific and respected singer-songwriter in the 2000s. And he used his growing platform as a tool to be a vocal booster of female talent. Behind that public front, however, was a far darker truth, a recent investigation by The New York Times revealed. According to several women, Adams used the promise of professional help as a lure for sex and emotionally abusive romantic relationships. In one case, he leveraged the adoration of an underage fan and aspiring musician into sexually explicit communications. Adams denies the claims. The F.B.I. is now investigating Adams’s interactions with the underage fan, and since the publication of the article, the release plan for his next album, the first of three LPs planned for this year, has been put on hold.

5cb43a5b49f0eacbf1f84192,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/15/lens/altamont-1969-bill-owens.html,"A half-century ago, 1969 capped a radical, idealistic decade that saw the rise of the hippie generation and the assassinations of John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Woodstock, perhaps the most famous concert ever, happened that summer, with free love and drugs serving as backdrops to sets by Jimi Hendrix, Santana, Richie Havens and others. But another large, raucous rock festival that year became notorious for very different reasons: Altamont. That December, the Rolling Stones and the Grateful Dead organized an impromptu concert at Altamont Speedway, in the golden hills of Northern California’s East Bay, that drew an estimated 300,000 people. Four people died, including a man who was killed by members of the Hells Angels who had been hired to provide “security” for the event. So much for peace and love. The concert was featured in the documentary film “Gimme Shelter,” and a few photojournalists captured the experience. Among them was Bill Owens, who would soon rise to photographic fame for his seminal early 1970s project “Suburbia,” which cheekily documented the rise of the suburbs in California. In December 1969, he was working as a photographer for The Independent, a newspaper in nearby Livermore, Calif., when his friend Beth Bagby and her boyfriend, Robert, who worked for The Associated Press, called to see if he wanted to shoot the concert. His editors gave him the day off as long as he let them publish a photo of the gathering. “The concert was going to be on a Saturday morning,” he recalled. “For some reason I had a motorcycle, probably because it was $85. So I drove my motorcycle out, and I went on the back roads. People were abandoning their cars, so pretty soon I had to ditch the motorcycle, because there was a barbed-wire fence there, and I couldn’t take it up this hill.” He got there early with two cameras, three lenses, film and a jar of water. He climbed up the sound tower to get a bird’s-eye view, which gave him a sense of the concert’s sprawling scale. Several hours later, a Hells Angels biker climbed the tower and threatened to bash his head with a pipe wrench and toss him off the tower if he didn’t come down. Since he’d used up all his film by then, Mr. Owens happily obliged and slowly made his way back to his motorcycle to go home. As he later wrote: “People fighting on sound towers only happens in the movies, and the good guy wins. Reality is different.” Mr. Owens didn’t even like rock concerts as he was a few years older than the hippies surrounding him, and he wasn’t interested in “dope.” He just wanted to go home to his family, put on the TV and watch Walter Cronkite.  Ms. Bagby stayed into the night, and photographed a Hells Angels member stabbing an African-American man, Meredith Hunter, near the stage as the Stones played. Mr. Owens didn’t know anything had gone horribly wrong until the following day. In addition to pictures of Mick Jagger making his way through the crowd, and Jefferson Airplane and Santana on stage, Mr. Owens managed to capture images of the Hells Angels beating people with pool cues, and feared his family might be at risk. Not taking any chances, he published his images under a pseudonym. “When the images appeared in Rolling Stone and Esquire all over the world, I had two or three different aliases on different images,” he said. “I would not publish my name, because my name is in the phone book, and I don’t want anybody associated with the Hells Angels to come looking for me and shoot me thinking I was the one who shot the photographs of the guy being murdered. “I’ve got a wife and a kid, and a second kid coming along. You want to be watching TV in the night time. You don’t want to be sitting there with a gun trying to protect yourself. I don’t want anything to do with that culture.” After the images were published, Mr. Owens and Ms. Bagby lent their negatives to a young couple who planned to include them in a book, but their house was burglarized and the thieves took all the negatives. Mr. Owens blames the Hells Angels, who he suspects weren’t interested in evidence remaining at large. The few pictures that survived have been collected in a new photo book, “Altamont 1969,” that was recently published in Italy by Damiani Books. It’s a fascinating collection of photographs, in addition to being an important document of a turbulent chapter in American cultural history. It’s also a surprising series to those who know Mr. Owens for his funny, warmhearted projects from the 1970s, and perhaps also to those who know him only as one of the founders of the craft beer brewing and craft distilling movements in the United States. Mr. Owens also served in the Peace Corps and took a hitchhiking trip around the world. The Altamont project, which relied so heavily on being present at a particular moment, seems an outlier compared to the rest of his work. In 1978, he published a manual about how to become a documentary photographer, in which he wrote: “Each year prizes are given to photographers who were at the right disaster at the right time: a shot of someone falling to his death, or better yet, a photograph of someone holding a gun on a hostage, and being blasted at by the cops. My photographs of violence are not a source of personal pride.” But at 80, having lived a rich and varied life, Bill Owens is thrilled the book will be a part of the cultural conversation. And he’s glad it’s happening now. “I know now, at age 80, God can take you,” he said. “Within three months, I can go. A lot of people have gone already. I read the obits. When you’re ready, something can be cooking inside of you, and you’re gone, and I’ve got this legacy to take care of.” Follow @nytimesphoto and @jblauphoto on Twitter.

Toys piled in a corner and a rocking chair from her own childhood revealed the momentary absence of a toddler, but little else betrayed the mix of chaos and ambition swirling just below the surface of Van Etten’s picturesque Brooklyn life. In a few hours, she would fly to Los Angeles to film a quick scene for the second season of “The OA,” the Netflix show that became her first professional acting job in 2016. On the way, she would use the quiet hours away from her young son to study for the final exams that loomed as she continued to pursue an undergraduate degree in psychology. There was also a new script that needed reading and an experimental film score in the works, but those were just the side gigs. At the same time, Van Etten, 37, was in the midst of returning to her day job as a singer-songwriter, plotting a music video shoot, getting ready for a tour set to begin in February and awaiting the imminent delivery of the finished vinyl for her fifth studio LP, out Jan. 18 via Jagjaguwar. Though typically understated, the album’s title, “Remind Me Tomorrow,” nods at Van Etten’s current juggling act — a tongue-in-cheek mantra for a multitasking mother who also happens to run the small business that is an independent band. [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] “Crazy, crazy, crazy,” Van Etten said, taking in the scope of her hectic but life-affirming last three years, which, ironically enough, began when she tried to press pause on her music career. “I can’t even believe we’ve done what we’ve done.” It’s Van Etten’s now-frequent use of we and our in conversation that best mark her transition from a solitary, searching singer, known for her languid, almost gothic breakup songs, to something fuller and less fragile — someone to be counted on, someone in charge of things. Together with her romantic partner, Zeke Hutchins, who was once her drummer and now works as her manager, Van Etten has undertaken what the couple characterizes as various adventures — acting, school, scoring, parenthood — each of which adds to her ongoing project: becoming a more well-rounded, more empathetic artist. “So much of creative work today is all about like, the solitary genius and sudden rise,” said Zal Batmanglij, who directed Van Etten in “The OA,” the Netflix sci-fi series. “But it’s the people who actually do the work, day in and day out, that are special. They’re after something deeper, their work gets better — things that aren’t necessarily super-fashionable right now. They last the test of time. That’s everyone’s reaction to Sharon.” “Remind Me Tomorrow” represents the singer’s journal on the path to getting whole. Nearly a decade on from her spare 2009 debut, “Because I Was in Love” — powerfully sad funeral dirges for the ghosts of toxic relationships — the new album embraces optimism, even when it sounds like end times. Written initially as love songs to Hutchins, the tracks only intensified as Van Etten finished the lyrics after giving birth, often working with headphones while staring at her napping son, who turns 2 in the spring. “It’s about my love and my fear and about me wanting to be better, but doubting myself a little bit,” said Van Etten, who has an easy, disarming manner that quickly brings people close. “It’s my job to be strong and positive so that he feels safe and protected, even given the state of the world.” (Van Etten, who was pregnant during the election of President Trump, recalled “trying not to cry because I didn’t want the baby to absorb my emotions.”) As she has expanded her artistic endeavors and emotional registers, Van Etten also found a fresh musical palette. While her early, softly strummed guitar songs were often gorgeous despite their brokenness, “Remind Me Tomorrow,” an album of hope, intimacy and perseverance, has jagged edges and a brooding swagger, built around droning synths and a propulsive rhythm section of studio musicians. “I just wanted to do something different,” she said. “And the band setup bored me so much: ‘This is where the bass comes in, this is where the drums kick in …’” She continued: “I love the slow build — that’s what I do. But I found that I was more drawn to the darkness and the driven synths and the syncopated beats.” Much of Van Etten’s recent evolution can be traced back to Nick Cave. She cited the Australian rock singer’s drone-heavy “Skeleton Tree,” from 2016, along with avant-garde and electronic acts like Suicide and Portishead, while seeking her new sound. But Cave had a less direct impact, as well: It was on tour opening for him in 2013 that she and Hutchins became something more than collaborators. “When we realized we fell in love, we were like, O.K., we have to go home and figure out our lives and then make this record and we’ll come back to this and see how we feel,” she said, referring to “Are We There,” her previous release, from 2014. “It was the most adult thing. And the most torturous thing we could’ve done to ourselves.” On that same tour with Cave, Van Etten was noticed by a casting director who would later swoop in to disrupt her life further. Following many months on the road in support of “Are We There,” Van Etten began feeling detached from her music and exhausted by the constant grind of performing heartbreak professionally. But inspired by her immediately intimate rapport with often-wounded fans after shows, she decided to take a moment away from music to finish her bachelor’s degree with the hope of becoming a licensed mental health counselor. As she and Hutchins settled into their new relationship, Van Etten enrolled at Brooklyn College, alive with the possibility of a new life chapter. Two weeks into her first semester, she got a call asking her to audition for “The OA.” “I almost didn’t take it,” Van Etten recalled. “I was doing this big dramatic pause with my band to go back to school and now I’m going to act? I’m such a phony!” She’d been in “West Side Story” in high school in New Jersey, where she grew up the middle child of five. But distant dreams of Broadway aside, Hollywood was never a goal. To Hutchins, however, the show sounded like an adventure. In the script, the role of Rachel, one of four damaged captives kept in glass cages by a mysterious scientist, called for “the voice of an angel.” Brit Marling, who stars in “The OA” and created the show with Batmanglij, recalled being floored by a video of Van Etten’s audition, in which she delivered a dramatic monologue and then sang a cappella, opting for “I Wish I Knew,” the opening song from her first album. “When you watched her do the monologue what you felt is that she was not acting — and that’s the highest compliment you can pay an actor,” Marling said. “She’s an incredible artist and thinker and feels everything viscerally. It comes out in her music and in how she acts. There’s just no phoniness. It’s all real.” Batmanglij added of Van Etten: “She could tap into something — these deep reservoirs of empathy. She can make herself vulnerable.” She took the role, agreeing to defer her college enrollment. But the detours just kept coming. In addition to eventually getting pregnant and performing on an episode of David Lynch’s “Twin Peaks” revival, Van Etten signed on to compose the score for the filmmaker Katherine Dieckmann’s “Strange Weather,” working out of a practice space that she shared with the actor and musician Michael Cera. It was there, Van Etten was comforted to discover, that she could not help but write songs. “It’s still an outlet for me,” she said. “It’s my therapy.” Van Etten found herself gravitating to Cera’s Roland Jupiter 4 synthesizer, and writing more on keys when not working on the film. By 2017, she had a folder of more than 40 demos, including what she described as a whole country album and another of only piano ballads. But the batch that became “Remind Me Tomorrow” was the most experimental, with sonic references that were “the sort of things you don’t think of when you think of Sharon Van Etten,” said the producer John Congleton, who would go on to oversee the recording sessions in Los Angeles. “She seemed particularly excited that I was going for it,” said Congleton, who likened the new songs to abstract tone poems. “I wasn’t trying to make it Americana, or normalize it,” he added. “I wasn’t trying to wrangle her — I was embracing the wildness.” That allowed a churning track like “Jupiter 4” — with plain-spoken romantic lyrics like “I’ve been waiting, waiting, waiting/my whole life for someone like you” — to come with a musical layer of dread, the kind that encapsulates how terrifying it is to fall in love and put down roots. (Van Etten’s composition was also recorded as “Jupiter,” an ’80s-ish pop jam, by the singer Donna Missal.) Other love songs on the album, like “Comeback Kid” and “Seventeen,” feel aimed at Van Etten’s younger self. While much of her songwriting output has been viewed through the lens of her earliest public origin story — an abusive relationship with a man who tried to stamp out her creative impulses — Van Etten’s new work is less about picking at tender scabs than the faded scars that served as a road map to now. “I think reflection is important,” she said, “but taking those experiences and moving forward is how I’ve gotten to be here.” She added: “It’s because of everything I’ve gone through that I’m a stronger person and was open and ready enough to accept the right kind of love into my life.” On the almost-Springsteen-esque “Seventeen,” she sings: Down beneath the ashes and stone,Sure of what I’ve lived and have known.I see you so uncomfortably alone. Wish I could show you how much you’ve grown. A few days after our first meeting, Van Etten was facing that nostalgia head-on as she scouted locations from her past for the track’s upcoming music video shoot. There were long-closed clubs on the Lower East Side, where she played some of her first shows, along with her early New York apartments sourced on Craigslist and too close to the rattling subway. Van Etten laughed about seeing her “hazy past in daylight,” but the stroll through memories was also something of a goodbye, as she and Hutchins had agreed that a move to Los Angeles in the new year was probably best for raising a child. “I’ve worked so hard to live here and now I can’t afford it,” she said. “The New York story.” But it wasn’t a tragedy. Van Etten said she was open to more acting following her forthcoming appearance in the second season of “The OA,” and has been working on writing comedy, including a personal project about a mother’s relationship with her babysitters. She even recently tried stand-up. And though she would most likely not have time to return to school until 2020, Van Etten added that she’s sticking to her plan to become a therapist by the age of 50. “By then,” she said, “I’ll want to settle down.” "
5c9ef95d49f0eacbf1370096,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/30/fashion/pavements-limestone-lisbon-portugal.html,"LISBON — As Portugal lost its colonies around the globe, the country’s nearly six centuries of influence ensured a legacy of distinctive decorative style: delicate filigree jewelry, colorful azulejo tiles, intricate wrought iron work and black-and-white patterned stone sidewalks and praças, or plazas. Those limestone surfaces are pedestrian objects in more ways than one: made to be trampled on, day in and day out, in places like Macau and Rio de Janeiro. “They are a carpet that people don’t always notice,” said Luísa Dornellas, director of the Escolas de Jardinagem e Calceteiros, the schools of gardeners and stone pavers. But in Lisbon, the heart of Portuguese culture, the pavements are considered works of art. Since the City Council established the paving school in 1986, it has trained 224 calceteiros, or pavers, to maintain the limestone surfaces in the city as well as create new ones. The school also provides another benefit: It has codified the technique and archived its history. Stone paving had been a skill handed from generation to generation, taught “through oral tradition. Nothing was written down,” said Ana Baptista, a staff member who handles public relations for the school. “We want to preserve these skills.” Patterned pavements are as much a part of Portugal’s heritage as an after-dinner glass of port. The school’s information sheet says that, in 1842, the first patterned calçada, or pavement, was laid by a group of prisoners under the direction of Lt. Gen. Eusébio Cândido Cordeiro Furtado at the Castelo de São Jorge, the Moorish castle overlooking the city. The paving no longer exists but, at the time its black and white zigzag motif was a big hit. “The people of Lisbon enjoyed so much the pavement,” Ms. Dornellas said, that soon after much of the central Praça de Dom Pedro IV, commonly known as the Praça do Rossio, was paved in waves (about 64,600 square feet of the paving still delights residents and tourists). Within years, many of the city sidewalks and plazas, as well as those in its colonies, were carpeted in small pieces of limestone, some laid in patterns but others just in white stone. It took manpower. “Up until the 1990s there were 400 pavers” in Lisbon, Ms. Dornellas said. Then, as concrete and asphalt began to replace stone, the number dwindled to just a handful. The creation of the paving school reflected the city’s concern for the artistic heritage, but it also provided hope of jobs in an era of high unemployment in Portugal. Ms. Dornellas, describing the school’s history, told a success story of a man in his 50s, out of work, who studied at the school and then last year set up his own thriving paving business. Other graduates are hired by the city to maintain the public calçadas, which today continue to decorate much of the city; the school also has had trainees in many other countries. It can take 18 months to complete the school’s course of study and receive a certificate marking graduates as professional stone pavers. “We now have about 20 students each year,” Ms. Donellas said, and they invariably are men: “We did have two women, but one dropped out.” The work is physically demanding. Jorge Duarte, the school’s master paver and trainer (in Portuguese, mestre calceteiro e formador da escola de calceteiros) demonstrated how it is done. Outside the school walls, blazingly white in the strong Portuguese sun, Mr. Duarte had been working on a perfectly flat area of about 22 square feet that had been prepared for paving. A kind of stencil, which the school and its students call a mold, lay on the ground. It was in the shape of a butterfly, about three feet wide; its exterior edges were lined with limestone pieces and then the mold removed so the empty spaces could be filled with stone of a different color. The students create molds from sheets of laminate-like material; “they are used a few times and discarded,” Ms. Baptista said. Molds used on public projects, however, are made of wood or metal, which can be used repeatedly. The molds are archived, and the city has stored more than 7,000 in a warehouse. When it comes to the patterns that can be created, a paver’s imagination is the only limit. One of the most common is waves, which pay homage to Portugal’s maritime past: “our Golden Age in the 15th and 16th centuries,” Ms. Dornellas said. Ships and dolphins abound, as do references to nature — birds, stars, sunflowers — and motifs such as rosettes and the cross of Christ. After surrounding the butterfly mold with white stones, Mr. Duarte lifted the mold and began filling in the empty spaces with black stones. Each stone was a little less than a couple of inches in size, and he had chipped each and every one on all sides to fit precisely. Machines can do that work but Mr. Duarte prefers to prepare the stones himself. “Some master pavers like to feel the stone,” Ms. Baptista explained. “The creativity flows from the head into the arm and the hand that breaks the stone.” So Mr. Duarte sat on his low stool — every calceteiros has his own — and went to work with a small hammer. Its metal head is sharp on one end, to chip the stone, and flat on the other, to tamp it down, once in place, tightly against its neighbor. For the school’s work, the stones arrive from quarries as small pieces (in earlier years, Ms. Dornellas said, it used to arrive in huge chunks). White and black stones, the most popular colors, along with the less common gray, are from the Serras de Aire e Candeeiros region of central Portugal. The rare yellow and pink are mostly quarried in the southern Alentejo region. The small stones create a mosaic, with plenty of cracks, or seams, that allow drainage when it rains. “And they are elastic,” Ms. Baptista said, able to shift and adjust when, say, a tree root grows underneath. Once Mr. Duarte had all the stones in place, he picked up a heavy wooden maço, which looks like a small butter churn and can weigh as much as 45 pounds, and pounded them until they were level. Then, using a shovel, he dug into a mound of limestone that had been pulverized in the chipping process, deposited it on the pavement, swept it into the cracks with a broom, and then watered it to create what, once it dried, would be a porous mortar. The smaller the stones, and the more complicated the pattern, the longer the work takes; for plain pavements, an artisan can create almost 110 square feet a day, Ms. Dornellas said. But if the pattern is more elaborate, only about 10 square feet a day is possible. Somewhere in every pavement is the paver’s signature mark; Mr. Duarte’s is a heart. Several feet from his current project was a section of pavement with a stylized black spider design recently laid by three young men from Latvia under Mr. Duarte’s tutelage. At its center was his mark, a cluster of hearts. And on this particular day, with his hammer in one hand and chunk of limestone in the other, he swiftly chipped the piece into the shape of a heart and handed it, as a memento, to a visitor. Portuguese calçada can be found “all across the world, in Rio, Angola, Macau, Mozambique,” Ms. Dornellas said. The United States has some examples, perhaps most notably in the John Lennon memorial in Central Park in New York. The school’s staff members, including Isabel Polonia, coordinator of the paving students’ studies, are eager to keep paving relevant in a modern world, and artists have been called upon to create new designs. For example, the street artist Alexandre Manuel Dias Farto, whose tag name is Vhils, created one in 2015 in the Alfama, Lisbon’s old town, to commemorate the fado singer Amália Rodrigues, who died in 1999. “The pavement starts on the ground and climbs a wall,” Ms. Baptista said. “When it rains it’s like she’s crying, recreating the emotion of fado.” There even is a city monument to the pavers: Two bronze figures, one crouched and chipping at a stone in his hand, the other using a maço to tamp the surface. The statues, created by Sérgio Stichini in 2006, used to be tucked away on a side street, but in 2017 they were moved to a more prominent place, next to the grand Hotel Avenida Palace in the central Praça dos Restauradores. A plaque at the site reads: “Tribute from the city of Lisbon to the Pavers who build the ground we tread.” "
5c66d29a3a125f5075c09ebd,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/15/arts/music/ryan-adams-album.html,"The release of a new album by the singer-songwriter Ryan Adams has been canceled amid a report that the F.B.I. is looking into his communications with an underage fan. Following an article published by The New York Times on Wednesday about Adams’s treatment of women, from a teenage fan to his ex-wife, Mandy Moore, F.B.I. agents in the bureau’s New York office took the first steps to open a criminal investigation. They are responding to an accusation that Adams exchanged sexually explicit images with the teenager, who said her communication with the singer began when she was 14 and ended when she was 16. They never met in person, and through a lawyer, Adams has denied ever engaging in sexual conversations with someone he knew was underage. [Read our report: Ryan Adams dangled success. Women say they paid a price.] Adams, a prolific Grammy-nominated rock and alternative country singer, had previously announced plans to release three albums this year via Blue Note Records and his own Pax-Am label. On Thursday, the first of those new albums, “Big Colors,” which had been scheduled for April 19, was put on hold indefinitely, according to music retailers. Bull Moose, a record store chain in Maine and New Hampshire, posted on Twitter a message it had received from a supplier stating the album “has been canceled effectively immediately.” A representative for the store confirmed it had been alerted by a sales representative for Universal Music Group that the album was canceled. Capitol Music Group, a division of Universal Music, which was scheduled to distribute Adams’s new albums, declined to comment. SRCVinyl, another seller, said it was offering refunds for customers who had already purchased “Big Colors,” and a pre-order page on the Pax-Am website was also removed. Two musical equipment companies that worked with the singer also suspended their relationships with him on Thursday. In a statement, Benson Amps said it was “saddened and surprised by the recent allegations” against Adams and would no longer move forward with the development of a Ryan Adams signature model. JHS Pedals, a guitar effects company, said it would cease all collaboration with Adams and discontinue his signature pedal, adding that it would rebrand its current inventory “with a portion of the sale going towards the fight against sexual abuse and misconduct.” [F.B.I. opens inquiry into Ryan Adams’s explicit communications with underage fan.] Adams was also accused in The Times’s article of a pattern of emotional abuse and manipulation, in which he offered career assistance and credibility to young female musicians, only to sometimes turn harassing and retaliatory. Adams denied the characterizations of his behavior as abusive or manipulative and challenged the accuracy of the reporting, though he apologized on Twitter “to anyone I have ever hurt, however unintentionally.” In January, Adams, who has released 16 studio albums and a much-discussed cover version of Taylor Swift’s “1989,” announced a deluge of new music in a nontraditional way: via political reporters. Using well-known staff members from The Washington Post, CBS, NBC and Politico, Adams spread information about his three new albums, including “Big Colors” and a follow-up titled “Wednesdays.” He had also announced 10 European tour dates beginning March 30 in Dublin. As of Friday, tickets were still available for purchase. “Big Colors” was produced by Don Was, the president of Blue Note Records, and was scheduled to feature John Mayer, Bob Mould and Benmont Tench of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. Guest musicians slated for “Wednesdays,” which was not given a release date, included Emmylou Harris and Jason Isbell, who wrote on Twitter this week that he believed the women speaking out against Adams. Other former collaborators have also come forward. The musician and model Karen Elson, who toured with Adams in 2017, said in a post on Instagram that she “also had a traumatizing experience with Ryan Adams.” But she added, “I’m not quite brave enough yet to speak about my specifics.” Asked about the allegations against Adams, the singer-songwriter Liz Phair, with whom Adams said he was working on a double album in 2017, posted on Twitter: “My experience was nowhere near as personally involving, but yes the record ended and the similarities are upsetting.” "
5c7d2ce049f0eacbf105b3b4,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/04/obituaries/keith-flint-dead.html,"LONDON — Keith Flint, a high-octane founding member of the British dance act the Prodigy, who sang lead vocals on the hits “Firestarter” and “Breathe,” was found dead on Monday in Essex, England. He was 49. His death was announced on the band’s Instagram account. In a post on Monday, Liam Howlett, the band’s main musician, said Flint had killed himself. “I can’t believe I’m saying this but our brother Keith took his own life over the weekend,” Mr. Howlett wrote, adding that he was angry, confused and heartbroken by the news. The Prodigy was scheduled to tour the United States in May, with one show set for Terminal 5 in Manhattan. It has not been announced whether the shows will go ahead. The Prodigy came to prominence in 1997 with “The Fat of the Land,” the group’s third studio album, which went to No. 1 in Britain and the United States and made underground British dance music a hit across the Atlantic. Mr. Flint, with his distinctive double mohawk and endless energy, was one of the main factors behind the band’s appeal, along with the band’s other singer, Maxim Reality (Keith Palmer). Mr. Flint and Maxim Reality were “folk devils” and “emissaries from techno’s psychic underworld,” Ann Powers, a New York Times pop music critic, wrote in 1998 in a review of the band’s live show. Mr. Flint explained his look and onstage antics in a 2009 interview with The Guardian. After wearing his hair in a mohawk at school, he was “chucked out and sent to a special school,” he said. “They had to hypnotize me to settle me down — I just had so much energy.” Being onstage was a release for him, he added. “It gets my mental energy out,” he said. “That’s why I’m really honest onstage. I’m not there for the beauty of my voice or to be the best dancer. I go out to express myself and stir up the audience.” Keith Charles Flint was born on Sept. 17, 1969, in Redbridge, in East London, and grew up in Braintree, a suburb in Essex. He had an unhappy childhood, and his parents split up when he was young. He told The Times of London that he stopped talking to his father entirely in later life. Mr. Flint was bright but had dyslexia. That led to problems at school, and he left at age 15. He then went to work as a roofer, according to the BBC. In 1989, Mr. Flint met Mr. Howlett at a rave and asked the D.J. for a mixtape. Mr. Howlett gave him one featuring some of his own tracks, writing the word “Prodigy” (the name of a synthesizer made by Moog) on the cover. Mr. Flint loved the music and suggested that he and a friend, Leeroy Thornhill, dance onstage as Mr. Howlett played. The band found immediate success in Britain with its debut single, “Charly,” a dance track from 1991 based on a sample from a 1970s public information film about child safety: “Charley says always tell your mummy before you go off somewhere.” Mr. Flint, who had long hair at the time, danced manically throughout the song's video. The band’s popularity grew as the British government tried to clamp down on the country’s rave scene. The Prodigy’s second album, “Music for the Jilted Generation,” with its frenetic beats and defiant lyrics, caught the mood of rebellion as young people continued to stage outdoor parties despite a 1994 law banning them. But the band’s popularity peaked only after Mr. Flint started singing. “Firestarter,” the first single from the Prodigy’s third album, “The Fat of the Land,” marked a change in direction, mixing rave music with rock guitars. “I’m a firestarter, twisted firestarter,” Mr. Flint sneered, playing the role of cartoon villain. “I’m the trouble starter, punking instigator.” Mr. Flint sang on many other Prodigy releases (the band’s seventh album, “No Tourists,” was released last year), although none found as much success as “Firestarter” and “Breathe.” “Baby’s Got a Temper,” a 2002 single, featured Mr. Flint singing in praise of Rohypnol, a drug associated with date rape. It was widely criticized and caused Mr. Howlett to rethink the band’s direction. Mr. Flint was dropped from singing on the band’s next album in favor of guest singers, although he continued to perform at live concerts and returned for “Invaders Must Die” in 2009. Mr. Flint’s life sometimes involved problems with depression and prescription drugs. In 2009, he told The Times of London that he had once been suicidal. His high-energy onstage antics were reflected in other interests, too. Mr. Flint was a lover of motorbikes and owned a successful motorcycle racing team. He also ran a pub in Essex for several years. In 2015, he told The Guardian that the bar had an open fireplace, and that every time he went to light it, somebody would make a “Firestarter” joke. “I’m like, ‘That’s very funny, you owe me a pound,’ ” he recalled saying. He gave all the money collected to charity, he said. Mr. Flint’s death prompted many tributes online, including from dance music stars and fans of the band. “He did what all music stars are meant to do,” Kathy Burke, a British comedian and actress, wrote on Twitter. “He frightened your mums and dads.” "

Just want the music? Listen to the Playlist on Spotify here (or find our profile: nytimes). Like what you hear? Let us know at theplaylist@nytimes.com and sign up for our Louder newsletter, a once-a-week blast of our pop music coverage. Quiet, nightmarish and nursery-rhyme catchy, Billie Eilish’s “Bury a Friend” is matter-of-fact about mourning’s connection to death wish: “Bury a friend/I want to end me.” The video, her creepiest yet, is not for the needle-phobic; the song on its own is unflappably ominous. Its beat is a muffled but brisk electronic shuffle; her voice, moving in and out of electronic effects, is detached and crisply rhythmic, as she wonders, “Why aren’t you scared of me/Why do you care for me?” Another line from the song supplies the title of the debut album she just announced: “When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?” JON PARELES YBN Cordae is one of the most promising young technicians in hip-hop. It’s little surprise, then, that his song celebrating women from various parts of the country (and the world) — his own version of Ludacris’s “Area Codes” — is lighthearted and a little crude, but also lyrically clever, just sharp enough to make the bawdiest moments go down easy. JON CARAMANICA Perky turns menacing — and “fashionista” becomes a three-syllable word — in “Fashionista” by the Japanese group Chai; its first album was “Pink” in 2017, and this is from its coming one, “Punk.” Sing-chanting over a strutting bass line — like the Spice Girls, but switching between English and Japanese — Chai’s voices rattle off thoughts on applying makeup to “get it all sexy” before declaring, in a cloud of backup vocals, “We are fashionista!” By the end of the song, dissonant guitar chords have surfaced, the beat is crashing and ricocheting around, and that cloud of voices has turned into a typhoon: a party out of bounds, or a consumer revolt? PARELES Here’s a track that thumps, blips and hisses its way toward the limbic system, while a filtered voice urges, “Get loose to the rhythm of the drum.” Paradoxically, amid all those programmed beats and swoops, I don’t hear an actual drum. PARELES A hard smack of good cheer from the Lil Peep archives, which still hold a bounty of collaborations with his good friend, the D.I.Y. sing-rap innovator iLoveMakonnen. Much like iLoveMakonnen’s underappreciated 2017 single “Love,” “I’ve Been Waiting” has some 1950s guilelessness at its core, blended with 1980s pop optimism. What’s striking here is how intuitive a melodist iLoveMakonnen is — Lil Peep smear-sings the chorus, while iLoveMakonnen sounds jubilant even though the sentiment leans dark. Patrick Stump of Fall Out Boy, the guest of honor, finds a welcome home for his tight yelps — he sounds anxious, as always, but also happy to be here. CARAMANICA The South African rapper Yugen Blakrok, who made a quick appearance on the “Black Panther” soundtrack album, has a full album out today, “Anima Mysterium.” In “Picture Box,” she confronts media distortion and “horrific daily news” that’s “spewing words without content/spoken out of context,” and she summons mystical remedies. Her voice is low and insistent, in a thick, trudging, orchestral track that faces burdens with tenacity. PARELES “Despacito” taught Luis Fonsi to breathe. For almost two decades, he’d been among the more powerful vocalists in Latin pop, but he rarely allowed himself to find a pocket, a groove, and reside there peacefully. So what’s notable about “Vida,” his new album, is how he leans back from his vocal authority and finds ways to dole it out carefully, like on the lilting guitar caresser (with extremely light EDM flickers) “Poco A Poco.” “Vida” is, shockingly, Fonsi’s first album following the globe-smashing success of “Despacito,” released two years ago. Both versions are here — the original, and the remix with Justin Bieber — and, it should be said, they still go hard. CARAMANICA Allison Miller was aboard the New York subway while she wrote most of the tunes on “Glitter Wolf,” her fifth album with Boom Tic Boom, something that shows through in the music. These pieces have the sturdy, thwacking power of so much of Miller’s drumming — which is equally informed by punk and jazz — and the jostling momentum of an M.T.A. car on the move. Miller writes melodies with purpose, and many of the tunes on the LP seem destined to stick with you, perhaps none more than “Daughter and Sun.” It starts off as a romp, its swinging melody nodding to Ornette Coleman in one moment, and Middle Eastern maqam in the next. The sextet slowly dissolves until all we’ve got left is Miller alone. She picks up the pieces, playing a drum solo that coheres into a powerful rumble, and sends us back to that joyful melody. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO White Denim, a long-running band from Austin, loves the impact of garage rock, the melodies of pop and the musical and verbal intricacies of prog rock. “NY Money” is nearly seven minutes of perpetual motion, semi-sequiturs and two-chord (the intro has three) Minimalist obsessiveness. It hurtles through thoughts of drugs, death, self-renewal, disappearance, a gaptoothed waitress and high finance without ever losing its limber momentum. PARELES Paul Webb, who was the bassist in the 1980s band Talk Talk, first recorded as Rustin Man in 2002, on a duo album with Beth Gibbons of Portishead. The sequel, 17 years later, is the Rustin Man album “Drift Code,” and it’s a throwback to the post-psychedelic British prog rock of the late 1960s and early 1970s — particularly Soft Machine and its bemused, melancholy singer, Robert Wyatt. “Judgment Train” is a bluesy, jammy, wah-wah-loving railroad ride toward an unknowable afterlife. PARELES Two sound-worlds meet on this track from “An Attempt to Lift the Veil,” a duet album by Jim Jarmusch, on electric guitar, and Jozef van Wissem, on lute. One is a loud, constantly evolving yet somehow meditative feedback drone; the other is a handful of laconic, minor-key motifs on lute. One is clangorous, amorphous, psychedelic, the other consonant, neatly contained and semiclassical. Somehow, they harmonize. PARELES "
5c9941f149f0eacbf105ef73,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/25/arts/music/big-ears-festival-best-music.html,"KNOXVILLE, Tenn. — The Big Ears Festival started 10 years ago, disappeared, returned, reorganized as a nonprofit and has quietly grown year by year, filling theaters, clubs and galleries in downtown Knoxville. About 18,000 people attended this year’s festival from March 21-24. Rejecting musical genre classifications and spurning descriptions like “avant-garde” or “experimental,” Big Ears has never spelled out its aesthetic guidelines, and by now it doesn’t have to. It draws an audience that’s curious and ready to listen intently. The Big Ears lineup this year encompassed rock (Spiritualized, Mercury Rev), jazz (the Art Ensemble of Chicago, Bill Frisell, Mary Halvorson, Tim Berne), contemporary classical music (Bryce Dessner, Anna Thorvaldsdottir), string-band music (Punch Brothers, Bela Fleck), free improvisation (Evan Parker, Susie Ibarra), a folk opera (Rachel Grimes’s “The Way Forth”), a ballet (“Lucy Negro Redux”), silent films with live scores and a midnight-to-noon drone marathon that changed performers every half-hour. It featured multiple concerts of music by the pioneering Minimalist composers Alvin Lucier and Harold Budd; it celebrated the unconventional vocal techniques of the singers Joan La Barbara and Meredith Monk. It honored the 50th anniversary of the jazz-and-beyond label ECM Records and it gathered luminaries from Chicago’s “Great Black Music” collective, the Association for the Advancement of Creative Music. Instead of sales metrics or star power, Big Ears contemplates the perceptual properties of music: shades of dissonance and consonance, the particular qualities of a drone, the ever-changing applications of subtlety and brute force. There was music to soothe, music to jolt, music to ponder and music to dance to. Here are 15 of the most intriguing performers and performances. The English musician Shabaka Hutchings brought two of his groups to Big Ears, both of them built around his fat-toned, indefatigable tenor saxophone with beats derived from dance music and — his far-from-secret resource — carnival rhythms (he has Barbadian roots). He allows himself an extended solo now and then, but most of the time he pumps out short, hard riffs, all sinew and drive. Sons of Kemet is a four-piece band: just Hutchings, two drummers, and a tuba player who occupies the entire low register. It was muscular enough, but a late-night club set by The Comet Is Coming — Hutchings, a drummer, and a keyboardist who cranked up distorted rave bass lines — was so forceful it set off a mosh pit. The Canadian composer Kara-Lis Coverdale has released diverse albums of electronic music; she has also worked since her teens as a church organist. She used the pipe organ at the Church Street United Methodist Church for an eerie 47-minute piece that started with one of the very highest notes of the organ, alone: a keening whistle from somewhere far out of reach. Much of the piece stayed in those distant realms, sustaining tones beyond the power of human breath and letting tentative melodies hang in midair. She barely touched upon the earthy heft available in the organ’s lower register; this was an elevated, disembodied contemplation, patiently celestial. When punk had barely dawned, This Heat was already post-punk. From its start in 1976, This Heat was a contrarian band, dispensing corrosive noise, intricate math-rock patterns and cryptic, often politically charged lyrics. Two of its founders, Charles Bullen (on guitar) and Charles Hayward (on drums), revived the band’s repertoire in 2016 with This Is Not This Heat. Its Big Ears set was utterly precise in its cantankerousness, from the electronic screeching that ushered the band onstage to songs that blared and stopped cold, droned steadily or crashed and flailed, and set the Declaration of Independence to Arab-tinged reggae (in “Independence”); the songs’ bristling cynicism defies obsolescence. Big Ears, the group announced, would be its next-to-last show. Strictly speaking, Artifacts Trio — Nicole Mitchell on flute, Tomeka Reid on cello and Mike Reed on drums — started as a cover band. In 2015, the 50th anniversary of the Association for the Advancement of Creative Music, the trio revived compositions from the multitude of albums the association’s members have released: some swinging, some introspective, some textural. The lean, straightforward trio format and the tricky but frisky repertoire made an ideal showcase for Mitchell’s prodigious, playful virtuosity and Reid’s double duties of propulsion and melodic counterpoint. Playing solo classical guitar in ways that blur easy classifications of folk or jazz, Ralph Towner makes it seem as if his music were inventing itself on the spot. Phrases of melody appear in fluctuating tempos, as if they just occurred to him, soon followed by knotty chords that instantly recast the tune; swinging rhythms arise, take over for a while, then melt away. Each detail arrives as a discovery, though it’s clear that Towner has deep structure behind his spontaneity. He unveiled some brand-new pieces, and he cheerfully noted his recovery from triple-bypass surgery by playing a standard: “My Foolish Heart.” The methodical turns exhilarating in the music of Nik Bärtsch and his quartet, Ronin. Bärtsch starts with patterns — often a terse little riff in an odd meter — that get stacked up in countless ways, ricocheting from keyboard to bass clarinet to drums to electric bass, getting subdivided or having multiple instruments suddenly pile on. The repetition comes from Minimalism, the rhythmic flair from jazz and the unabashed impact from rock as all the parts click into place. Since the 1960s, Richard Thompson has been writing songs that face the bleak realities of mortality and hard luck. Backed by a string orchestra, he performed “K.I.A.: Killed in Action,” a set of songs about World War I based on letters and diaries from the era. It was somber, detailed and unflinching, with the strings as full participants. When Thompson sang “Gas,” about soldiers confronting poison gas for the first time, sustained strings switched to brittle pizzicato, conveying the sudden feeling of being unable to breathe. Lonnie Holley, a widely collected sculptor and painter from Alabama, started recording music in 2006 and released his first album in 2012, when he was 62. His voice is a bluesy, otherworldly moan with a hint of Sam Cooke and an occasional growl; his songs are verbal and musical improvisations, ruminating on the state of the world and the state of his soul. The Messthetics backed him on Friday afternoon with leisurely vamps topped by echoey keyboard and guitar as he sang about a fallen angel and about trying to reach the doorknob to heaven. His family once hoped Holley would be a preacher; between songs, he warned about a digital landscape where the “playground of foolishness” soon leads to the “quicksand field of stupidity.” All dressed in white, Meredith Monk and her four-woman ensemble of singers, dancers and musicians performed “Cellular Songs,” a collection of pieces that contemplates both biological cells and musical ones: the little cyclical figures that Monk assembles into compositions. With wordless syllables and occasional lyrics, and vocal styles suggesting a world of allusions, the songs hinted at games and rituals, with hints of comedy, and a group embrace at the end became an affirmation of solidarity. For decades, the Art Ensemble of Chicago was a close-knit quintet, until the deaths of some founding members. But at Big Ears, the Art Ensemble — still including its founder Roscoe Mitchell on alto saxophone and its longtime drummer, Famoudou Don Moye — appeared with more than a dozen musicians, including strings, brass, theremin, a singer (Rodolfo Cordova-Lebron) and a poet (Moor Mother). Its set was just as sprawling, touching on improvisational orchestral squall, dissonant chamber-jazz, a kind of parlor song and a musical jungle full of birdcalls. Its best moments were its most focused ones: swinging vamps propelled by Moye’s drumming, pointedly political poetry declaimed by Moor Mother — her “We Are on the Edge” is the title of an Art Ensemble album due April 26 — and a perpetual-motion tour-de-force by Mitchell, using circular breathing for a stretch of nonstop piping and squealing and scurrying that insisted, without a word, that after 50 years the Art Ensemble isn’t finished. Harold Budd’s compositions are often sparse and meditative, contemplating a handful of notes reverberating into silence. In a concert featuring new pieces, a small ensemble of instruments including harp, orchestral chimes, keyboard and cymbal shared momentary clusters of notes or fleeting motifs, like bits of crystal briefly catching the light. How would Josiah Wise, who records as serpentwithfeet, turn his studio-constructed, intricately overdubbed, often mournful and tormented songs into live performances? Two ways: with impassioned live vocals over prerecorded tracks and in solo piano versions. The canned music barely impeded the emotional power of his more drum-driven songs, and when he was at the piano, the songs shaded in and out of droll, spoken-sung monologues. As he courted singalongs, self-questioning turned into self-acceptance. A composer who has been working with electronics and samples since the 1970s, Carl Stone delivered a disorienting barrage from his laptop: bristling, relentlessly repetitive, stereo-hopping, rhythmic but dance-defying tracks that were so densely layered they seemed to raise the atmospheric pressure in the club. The new-music string quartet Brooklyn Rider has been collaborating for a decade with Kayhan Kalhor, who was born in Iran and plays the classical Persian spike fiddle called the kamancheh. They’ve learned from each other, with Brooklyn Rider picking up Persian inflections and bowing techniques and Kalhor adapting a traditional solo style to move in and out of the string ensemble. Their shared pieces orchestrated the kamancheh’s bite, and its echoes of ancient melodies, with harmonies and arrangements that extend and stoke the drama. No one can say Nils Frahm didn’t have enough equipment. He had two nests of multiple keyboards onstage for a solo show, and he used them all strategically: starting with toy-piano sounds and escalating through track upon track of keyboards and electronics, little melodies and blipping rhythm loops, showily adding each layer. When he settled down to a piano, the music drooped into new-age territory, but his hyperactive one-man-band act kept things popping. "
5c2d2d623a125f5075c0295a,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/02/movies/bohemian-rhapsody-a-star-is-born.html,"I was waiting for a subway last month in Mexico City when I figured out what’s wrong with the Queen movie. I mean, I knew what was wrong. “Bohemian Rhapsody” is scared of tapping into the imagination that made the band so innovative and powerfully, addictively strange. But that’s not what hit me waiting for the subway. The platform entertainment system was playing a concert video of “Another One Bites the Dust.” I don’t know what year the clip was from or what city Queen was in. I just know that the lighting is warm, the groove is skintight (you could feel it on the platform), and that Freddie Mercury is wearing — is packed into — white short-shorts and almost nothing else. No shoes, no shirt yet all service. The towel he’s whipping around gets an almost immediate, theatrical toss into the crowd. The red wristband and red bandanna tied round his neck bring out the red in his Montreal Canadiens trucker’s cap. Mercury does all his Mercurial moves — the side gallop, the chug-a-lug, the duck strut, the steed swipe, the rewind, the vroom-vroom, the Wimbledon Final frozen pirouette, the one where he kind of dries his tushy with the microphone stand in a full march. And he does them while belting out this uppercut of a song (with some shockingly forceful assistance from the drummer Roger Taylor). Commuters, tourists, kids: we looked up at this thing, mesmerized, in jeopardy of missing a train. That’s right about when I figured out what was wrong with the Queen movie: There’s nothing in it remotely like this. “Bohemian Rhapsody” plods, explains, obscures, speculates and flattens. It does not mesmerize. I mean, I wouldn’t miss a train for this. We learn how “We Will Rock You” allegedly sprang from a fit of personal protestation. But it’s news we can’t use. The movie won’t stop telling us things — about the music business and the songs, about Mercury’s tortured sex life. And it fails to show you anything close to what that clip on the subway platforms makes you feel: sweaty. The musical biography has an impossibly high degree of alchemical difficulty. One performer has to become a totally different performer, and not any performer, just this one star the whole world knows, and it has to be done in a way that makes you believe you’re seeing either the impersonated star or something quintessential about them. Val Kilmer made you believe you were seeing something vitally true about Jim Morrison. Joaquin Phoenix did the same with Johnny Cash. And Jamie Foxx became Ray Charles. Angela Bassett convinced you that if you were seeing if not Tina Turner, then Turner’s indestructibility; and Marion Cotillard, the brittle incandescence of Edith Piaf. For my money, one of the triumphs of this type of acting is Chadwick Boseman’s James Brown in “Get On Up.” Boseman pumps Brown full of edginess and spite while having to reconstruct Brown as a stage specimen, and part of that reconstruction involves learning to lip sync to Brown. You sense that you’re watching an actor who’s done more than homework. He’s written himself a little dissertation. It’s not an impression of Brown. It’s an interpolation. Some movies pivot and omit the musical performance altogether. That’s the approach Todd Haynes applied to Bob Dylan in “I’m Not There” and John Ridley took in having Andre 3000 play Jimi Hendrix in “Jimi: All Is by My Side.” But the alchemy is a reason to dislike the genre. It’s hard to get the proportions right. It takes some work in, say, “Cadillac Records” to figure out where Beyoncé ends and Etta James is supposed to begin. Rami Malek has a different challenge in “Bohemian Rhapsody.” He’s not a superstar playing another superstar. He just has to become the superstar Freddie Mercury was. Just. And yet because the movie is mostly scenes of recording sessions, squabbling and self-pity, Mercury’s stardom is made beside the point — it’s assumed — so Malek gets to play a charismatic sufferer, -quipster and, eventually, proud brown gay man. It’s just that this version of Mercury isn’t terribly exciting without the reward of seeing him vroom-vroom in short-shorts. The movie rides the roller coaster of biographical cliché. What’s missing are musical numbers that showcase his showmanship and eternal capacity for self-delight. This means more time watching Malek struggle with dental effects meant to bring his mouth into more realistic alignment with Mercury’s. Maybe Malek has done the best anyone could with the teeth. But they wind up bringing something vampiric out of Mercury that I don’t know was ever there. Either way, the alchemy is off.  WE’RE IN A HAPPY MOMENT for musical-movie excitement. “Mary Poppins” has returned with new songs. And despite that lie of a title, “The Greatest Showman” is the most impressive phenomenon nobody saw coming or took seriously once it came. “Bohemian Rhapsody” is now the musical biopic’s biggest hit. We can have the argument later about the difference between a classical movie musical and a movie where people get on stage and do music, but you could also add to the mix this latest incarnation of “A Star Is Born,” which was a smash too. It’s the story of how a waitress became a Grammy winner. And because the tale is essentially a fantasy — of love, fame and ruin; biography as mythology — its casting is the inverse of the rock bio. A musician does the acting. In Bradley Cooper’s version, the musician is Lady Gaga. She starts off as Ally the restaurant grunt. But when Cooper’s beloved alt-country pill guzzler sees her belt “La Vie en Rose” in a drag parlor, he hauls her into stardom, which Gaga knows well. But the surprise of her acting comes in the first hour when the movie is closer to earth and requires her to be more like you and me — daughter, employee, listener. There’s a lovely hesitance to her here, not in the camera-shy way singers tend to get when it’s time to act. Reluctance is a performance strategy for her in this movie. Again, she’s like you and me, she can’t believe Bradley Cooper’s happening to her, either. Some of what’s great about the first hour is how it gets you thinking about the kind of career Gaga could have in movies they haven’t made in, like, 30 years. The scenes at home with Ally, her chauffeur father and his fellow drivers are loud, funny and warm in a way that reminded me of “Moonstruck.” And some of the pleasure I had watching Gaga in them is how she reminded me of another singer who acts: Cher. A friend points out that she could have Cher’s career if the movies were still interested in normal people. I, at least, would love to see Gaga in a “Mask” or a “Suspect.” She and Malek are both near the top of the heap for Oscar nominations. And she’s got an alchemical advantage over Malek’s Freddie Mercury. When Ally’s career takes off, Gaga winds up playing a pop star not unlike herself. And you realize she has the opposite problem that Malek does. You’re less interested in her as a singer — but only because we’ve seen her do huge, stadium-size razzle-dazzle before. And yet she’s indifferent to playing the fame stuff. It doesn’t seem to interest Ally or Gaga. If the movie loses Ally a bit in the second half, Gaga never appears lost. She’s giving a serious, considered, committed performance of a person she seems to know. Malek’s commitment is to a movie committed in the wrong proportions. It doesn’t know who it wants Freddie Mercury to be. “Bohemian Rhapsody” doesn’t fixate on the showmanship until the finale, which restages their electric, legendary Live-Aid performance at Wembly Stadium and passes for showstopping. Yet you exit hungry for a movie that gets closer to the bottom of a man who renamed himself after both an element and a planet. If someone dares take another crack (and someone really should), I know the perfect Freddie. Her first name is Lady. And her last name comes straight from a Queen song. "
5c94966149f0eacbf105e701,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/22/arts/music/band-name-reunions.html,"The singer Ian Hunter recently announced a reunion tour of Mott the Hoople, the British band that recorded some memorable hits in the early 1970s. But, Hunter tacitly acknowledged, it wasn’t quite a reunion. Of Hunter’s four bandmates from Mott’s defining 1972 album, “All the Young Dudes,” two are dead and one is incapacitated from a stroke. Multiple deaths are rarely the end of great rock bands. So Hunter will tour with the guitarist and keyboard player who joined Mott for its anticlimactic 1974 swan song, “The Hoople.” Displaying a level of honesty rarely embraced by those trying to sell concert tickets, he called this band not Mott the Hoople, but Mott the Hoople ’74. It’s possible that Hunter could have picked some musicians from a Craigslist ad and legally presented the group as Mott the Hoople. (He declined an interview request.) Increasingly, calculated misrepresentations are part of an older band’s repertoire. Once a band name turns into a brand name, there’s a strong incentive to continue on, even with a lineup that makes fans ask, “Who are these guys?” As rock approaches its eighth decade, partially intact bands are more the rule than the exception. If you’re a purist who wants to see only bands with their full original lineups, you’d better love U2. Kiss is on a farewell tour featuring half of its original lineup, Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley. (The other half, Peter Criss and Ace Frehley, are alive). Ditto for the Who, touring this spring with Roger Daltrey and Pete Townshend. (The other half, John Entwistle and Keith Moon, are dead.) Yes and Journey march on, as did Boston for a while, despite not having their original singers. Styx tours without Dennis DeYoung, who wrote and sang its biggest hits. Lynyrd Skynyrd, currently on its own farewell tour, is down to one original member, as is Eagles. Foreigner tours with only one founding member, the guitarist and songwriter Mick Jones, and when Jones became ill a few years ago, the band continued without even him. This fractious dynamic isn’t limited to classic-rock bands: The punk groups Dead Kennedys and the Undertones have long toured without their original singers. Bikini Kill’s shows this spring won’t feature the band’s first guitarist, Billy Karren. Recent tours by Pixies, Smashing Pumpkins and the Replacements, who each lacked one or more key band members, prompted social-media arguments about whether fans were seeing the “real” band. “IF IT’S ME and your granny on bongos, it’s the Fall,” the singer Mark E. Smith, who peremptorily hired and fired dozens of members of the Fall, once said. But only a few musicians can carry off such lordly “l’état, c’est moi” proclamations. Mick Jones might be on that short list. Over the years, Foreigner has shed every main member of its early lineups until only Jones was left. But, argued Phil Carson, the band’s manager, “There’s only been one original member, ever. Mick handpicked everyone. We’ve had five or six keyboard players, almost countless drummers. If Mick Jones says it’s Foreigner, it’s Foreigner.” In August 2011, the group was playing a show at Jones Beach on Long Island when Jones felt too ill to continue. He was diagnosed with cardiovascular problems, but tour dates had been booked, so Foreigner continued on without the one man who’s synonymous with it. Jones still sometimes misses shows, depending on his health. Last year, when he was forced to skip a show at a 10,000-seat arena in Tel Aviv, a fan told The Jerusalem Post he felt the night was “tainted with con.” (Foreigner is huge in Israel. Who knew?) But Carson says fans enjoy Foreigner just as much whether Jones is onstage or in his slippers at home: “I’d say 90 percent of people at the shows have no clue who was in Foreigner.” For each fan, there’s an invisible emotional calculus involved in deciding whether a band is or isn’t still “real.” That accounting can seem arbitrary to others. I loved seeing the Replacements in 2014 with only two of its four original members, yet I would not see Pixies, who are touring through mid-April, because they’re missing the bassist Kim Deal, one of its original quartet. If it’s weird to care that much about a bassist, well, being a rock fan is often weird. Brian Koppelman, a former record executive and current pop-culture maven who co-created the Showtime series “Billions,” saw Van Halen play in 2006 without its longtime bassist Michael Anthony, and felt it wasn’t “the real Van Halen.” And despite the magnetism of Robin Zander, he refuses to see Cheap Trick now that the drummer Bun E. Carlos isn’t in the band. “His playing and attitude, the way he held a cigarette, that’s Cheap Trick to me,” he said. “I want to know that we don’t have to die. When I’m with my favorite bands, I can forget mortality for a minute. But I can’t if they’ve been affected by time and the vagaries of the world.” Koppelman believes there’s a “purely romantic ideal” to loving a band, especially one whose set list can summon feelings from days you often can’t remember. He and I are not the only reunion truthers prone to dramatic feelings about bass players. Briony Edwards, the editor of the music site Louder, loved Smashing Pumpkins when she was “an angsty teenager,” and she especially cherished the bassist, D’arcy Wretzky. Last year, Smashing Pumpkins reunited for a tour that purportedly celebrated its legacy, but Wretzky wasn’t in the band. “People say D’arcy wasn’t important, she didn’t write songs,” Edwards said, “but my enjoyment of their music is based on the relationship I had with them when I was a teenager.” Edwards saw the D’arcy-devoid Pumpkins at London’s Wembley Arena, and felt cheated: “As a fan, you come preloaded with ridiculous opinions you’re willing to die for.” Rock music constantly asks the question, “What’s real and make believe?” Strict constructionists like Koppelman, Edwards and I may scoff at some incomplete band reunions, but for less skeptical fans, including apparently many people who adore Foreigner, there’s a simpler, ontological litmus test. If you have as grand an emotional experience seeing Journey without Steve Perry as you would with him, how is your experience not real? Because if Journey won’t perform with Perry, your choice isn’t Fake Journey or Real Journey, it’s Semi-Journey or No Journey at All. WHILE FANS MIGHT feel joy at seeing a band that’s missing a key member, there are few happy feelings for the spurned exes. DeYoung, for instance, has not gone to see Styx play with a lineup that doesn’t include him. “I saw them plenty in the first 20 years,” he wisecracked. When Styx began to perform in 1999 without DeYoung, who was ill with a virus that left him sensitive to bright lights, he was one of four partners in the band who jointly owned the name. He sued, claiming misuse of the Styx trademark, and his ex-bandmates countersued. “We came to a settlement,” DeYoung said. “I can’t divulge the details, but I won’t have to sit on a street corner and sell cookies.” He is currently on tour with a show billed as Dennis DeYoung and the Music of Styx, and Styx still tours with Lawrence Gowan, a keyboardist who sings DeYoung’s hits in an imitative tenor. “I’m not in the band I helped make famous,” DeYoung said with a mix of frustration and resignation. “I wish I was in Styx, but I’m powerless.” Disputes over the rights to a band’s name are thorny because they combine elements of trademark law and contract law, said Loren Chodosh, an entertainment attorney whose clients have included Nada Surf and TV on the Radio. Band names typically qualify as trademarks, and trademarks can be assigned by contract. “A band agreement, in a lot of ways, is like a prenup,” Chodosh said. “It’s about what will happen if things go wrong and somebody leaves, which nobody wants to talk about. Bands don’t start to hate each other until they’re successful.” Most bands, Chodosh said, never establish contractually how the band trademark is owned. In the absence of a contract, she added, “Trademark law prevails. And because trademark law is not uncomplicated, it’s difficult to say who owns that trademark.” Before there was an internet where fans could find up-to-date information, bands engaged in outright chicanery. When the Velvet Underground played England in 1971 with the drummer Maureen Tucker as the only original member, a Melody Maker reviewer deemed it “a travesty, a masquerade.” Then Tucker quit, and the group continued. One of the faux Velvet Underground’s tours of England was arranged by Clifford Davis, the manager of Fleetwood Mac, who in 1974 fabricated an all-time deceit. The band had canceled tour dates after the drummer Mick Fleetwood discovered his wife was in love with one of his bandmates, but Davis was unwilling to return the advances promoters had paid, so he cobbled together a sham band while claiming that he owned the name. “He can put four dogs barking on a leash and call it Fleetwood Mac,” the singer Bob Welch quipped in Rolling Stone. Band ownership isn’t about what’s right or fair, but about what’s legal. In 1954, Clyde McPhatter of the Drifters sold his half-share of the vocal group to its manager, George Treadwell, who signed new members to personal services contracts, then hired and fired them at his whim. After he died, the trademark passed on to his wife, and then their daughter, as though it were an ancestral quilt. Chuck Negron, a founding member of Three Dog Night who sang several of its biggest hits, including “Joy to the World,” said that bandmates had him sign a contract — which stipulated that any member fired from the group would have no further right to use the name — while he was a heroin addict. Negron was later fired for missing shows. His attempt to bill himself as “Chuck Negron, formerly of Three Dog Night” led to a legal battle that the two parties resolved by agreeing that he could use the “formerly” designation, provided that in all print advertisements, the words Three Dog Night were no larger than half the size of the words Chuck Negron. After his former bandmate Cory Wells died in 2015, Negron listened to a current version of Three Dog Night and felt it was “a rip off. Not to say the people in the band aren’t good, but they just aren’t the same ilk.” Though bitter, he’s also proud that the music is still meaningful to people. “There are people who just want to hear that music and relive that time of their lives, and don’t care if two cats and an elephant are singing it.” IF YOU’RE ONE of those people who can enjoy a band even if most of the founding members are gone, consider two cases of groups with zero original musicians. The drummer Bobby Colomby co-founded the New York jazz-rock group Blood, Sweat & Tears, which grew to eight by the time of its 1968 debut. Band members left and were replaced, and by 1974, Colomby was the only original member in the group. “We had an agreement: Last man standing owns it,” he said. While Colomby took a less itinerant job, as an executive at CBS Records, he leased the Blood, Sweat & Tears name to David Clayton-Thomas, who sang the group’s signature hits, including “Spinning Wheel,” but was not an original member. After a 20-year lease, Clayton-Thomas formed a new band in 2004, so Colomby hired musicians to tour as his salaried employees. “As far as I’m concerned, as long as I’m the guy behind it, it’s still the original band,” he said, adding that if his 1960s bandmates still played in the group, “you’d see guys with walkers onstage.” Blood, Sweat & Tears still play 55 to 65 shows a year, according to its manager, Larry Dorr. In a phone interview with Dorr and Colomby, neither could name all current members of the band. But Colomby likens it to a franchise: “When you go to a Yankees game, what do you see? There’s no Babe Ruth, no Mickey Mantle. But you’re going to see the pinstripes, a tradition, a style.” Blood, Sweat & Tears, he insists, isn’t a group of specific people, “it’s a musical concept.” Soft rock bands are not exempt from legal feuds. Wayne Nelson, a bassist who joined the Little River Band in time for the successful group’s sixth album in 1981, said with a laugh, “We fought as much as a metal band, but it was all passive-aggressive.” Nelson was a paid employee first, and then was made a partner via LRB Proprietary Ltd., the group’s unit trust. When singer Glenn Shorrock left, he was paid $85,000 to turn over his shares, Nelson said. Eventually, the name was owned by the guitarist Stephen Housden, who had joined for the group’s seventh album, and stopped touring in 2006. Now, Nelson effectively licenses the trademark from Housden, who earns tour income without ever leaving his home. Shorrock and two other founding members tried to perform as the Original Little River Band, but Housden forced them to change the name. Since then, the band’s ex-members have called the current lineup “a tribute band” and “a joke.” No musician grows up dreaming of fighting in court and parrying insults, but, Nelson concluded, “That’s the life of a band in these times.” "
5c6484563a125f5075c098db,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/13/fashion/courtney-love-batsheva-fashion-week.html,"A model in a print Batsheva dress appeared at a microphone on a balcony on West Broadway and solemnly declaimed. “I am doll parts,” she said. “Bad skin. Doll heart.” If you knew these words, you really knew them. This was the rallying cry of an angry slice of a generation: one that had blossomed into fury with Hole, who screamed along with its lead singer, Courtney Love, on records like “Live Through This” and at frenetic live shows.  Model after model stepped to the mic and chanted snatches of Hole songs, alternately angry, bruised, fearsome and mocking. Beneath their wigs and braids, a few were recognizable: Christina Ricci, Veronica Webb, Annabelle Dexter-Jones, Theodora Richards. Below, on a couch that was the space’s only seating, sat Ms. Love herself, gazing upward, Instagramming. Batsheva Hay found fame designing what were popularly referred to as prairie dresses, modest little frocks in Laura Ashley fabrics. She has often played up the sweetness inherent in the premise, as she did last season, when she staged a fashion presentation as old diner, with model-waitresses bearing French fries. Now her models were picking up the darker undercurrent and spitting Love-isms — “Hooker-waitress, model-actress / Oh, just go nameless” — as a small battalion of sewing machines whirred below. Ms. Hay has cited Ms. Love and her “Kinderwhore aesthetic” as an inspiration before, part of a lineage that includes Cindy Sherman and other chroniclers of the restless feminine divine. Her look, she wrote in a note after the presentation, “was so of that time but she was also so ahead of her time.”  Ms. Hay’s circle includes friends of Ms. Love’s, like the psychoanalyst Jamieson Webster and the former Hole bassist Melissa Auf der Maur, who produced the music for the show and came up with the idea of having the models read the lyrics.  Eventually, Ms. Hay and Ms. Love ended up direct messaging on Instagram. Despite her much publicized baby-doll dresses, Ms. Love had her Laura Ashley moments, too. “That Laura Ashley green corduroy jumpsuit with yellow flowers?” she said. “I had that in the ’90s. I wore it till the wheels fell off. I wore it traveling so people wouldn’t know it was me. The persona was always ahead. Wearing a ripped dress, whatever. I actually flew with Sheryl Crow to Canada where she was doing Lilith, and I was doing a dark edge fest. I was dressed like a housewife, and she was wearing all leather and Fly Shades.” Ms. Love had an inkling there would be some tribute to her at the show, but she hadn’t anticipated the reading or the final performance of “Miss World” by Esther Rose McGregor, one of Ewan McGregor’s daughters. She was wearing a veil and a wedding dress on which Ms. Hay had invited Ms. Love to scribble whatever she wanted in red Sharpie.  The dress came back with words from Hole’s “Good Sister/ Bad Sister”: “Better watch your back, sister.” In her earlier scribbling days, Ms. Love was sometimes seen with words like “slut” and “witch” written in lipstick on her forearms. “It really moved me,” she said of the performance, though she said she hadn’t known what to do with her hands during it. Being confronted with a specter of one’s younger self is a surrealism most of us won’t know. But the lyrics, Ms. Love said, held up. “Some of them I really, really love,” she said. “Some of them are too out there and commercial, and everyone knows them. The important thing for me, then and now, is it has to look good on the page. I mean, you can love Led Zeppelin and not love their lyrics sort of thing, but I made a big effort in my career to have what’s on the page mean something.” Their sense of righteous female rage hasn’t dated much, a reporter said, in rock or outside of it.  “It certainly hasn’t,” Ms. Love said. On a trip to Scotland with her daughter, Frances Bean Cobain, she bought what she called “little niche rock magazines that are still out”: Mojo, Q, Classic Rock.  “Frances was like, You’re like the granny with her hobby,” she said. “Throwing them, yelling. The only women who were in ’em were Joan and Debbie and maybe some Patti. I was like, what, what? Slash on every page! They’re all cool. But where are the chicks? It’s like it didn’t happen.” “But for Batsheva,” she added, “I thought it was juxtaposed really well.” "
5c40987c3a125f5075c04ec9,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/arts/music/maggie-rogers-heard-it-in-a-past-life.html,"LOS ANGELES — A few Tuesdays ago, the 24-year-old singer-songwriter Maggie Rogers’s single “Light On” displaced Mumford & Sons’ “Guiding Light” at the top of the first Billboard adult alternative songs chart of 2019 — one of the publication’s niche charts, but something she could get jazzed about all the same, if she let herself. “My parents are really excited,” she said hours after the news broke, huddled beneath a heat lamp on the back patio of a restaurant on Silver Lake Boulevard. “But they don’t know what it means either. They were like, ‘Are you excited? We don’t know if we’re supposed to be excited.’” Rogers wasn’t quite sure either. She started out as a banjo-slinging folkie, but broke through with songs like “Alaska” and “On + Off,” whose sonic textures reflected her growing interest in electronic dance music and mainstream pop. Perhaps appropriately, she has both a folkie’s suspicion of airplay charts and No. 1 hits as markers of artistic success and a pop star’s understanding of self-promotion as a job requirement. After some internal debate about whether to note the news on social media at all, she posted a tweet that included a string of exclamation points but began with the word “WHAAAAATTT” — celebratory, yet noncommittal. [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] In photographs, Rogers brings to mind a millennial version of Sissy Spacek circa “Badlands” crossed with Lana Del Rey; what the pictures don’t capture is the articulate intensity she exhibits in conversation, especially when she talks about re-establishing control over her career after an unexpected brush with viral fame — a moment that led to labels knocking down her door, but one she ultimately found quite destabilizing. Her third album and first on a major label, “Heard It in a Past Life,” is due on Friday. Rogers grew up in rural Easton, Md. Her father is a now-retired Ford dealer; her mother, a former nurse who introduced Rogers to Erykah Badu and Alanis Morissette, now works as an end-of-life doula. Rogers was writing songs by age 13; at 17, she produced and self-released her debut album, “The Echo,” which channeled the pastoral spirit of early Bon Iver and Sufjan Stevens. The demos for that record helped her secure admission to the Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music at New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts. In New York, she played in multiple bands and “overdosed on live music”; during a semester abroad, she visited clubs in Paris and Berlin and fell in love with house and techno. During this time, she also found herself unable to write songs, even as graduation loomed and her music-production classes demanded it. “All my teachers were really frustrated with me,” she said. She began seriously considering a career in music journalism as a fallback; she interned at Spin and Elle and worked as an editorial assistant to the writer Lizzy Goodman, transcribing hundreds of hours of interviews with the leading lights of the early 2000s New York indie-rock boom for Goodman’s oral history “Meet Me in the Bathroom.” Then in March 2016, during the second semester of Rogers’s senior year, Pharrell Williams — an artist-in-residence at N.Y.U. at the time — visited her music-production class to critique student work. Rogers brought a demo of “Alaska,” on which her supple soprano bobs and weaves over a sparse shuffle beat that brings to mind Williams’s own work with producing partner Chad Hugo as the Neptunes. In a video that subsequently blew up online Rogers plays her demo for Williams, whose face contorts in surprise and delight while he listens. “I’ve never heard anyone like you before,” he tells her afterward. “That’s a drug for me.” Coming from Williams — a category-killing industry icon who’s worked with Migos and Ed Sheeran, indelibly stamping his imprint on 2000s pop as well as hip-hop — this was a career-making endorsement. But it wasn’t one Rogers had sought out, and she says now that she was unprepared for the attention that came with it. “As a producer, as a songwriter, I’ve spent a lot of time either in my bedroom or in studios, alone,” she says. “Suddenly I was in the public eye in this way that I had absolutely no control over. It was really scary.” She compared processing that video with a more recent broadcast moment: her early November appearance previewing her new album on “Saturday Night Live,” which was met with a mixed response. “This thing happens when you’re like grossly overstimulated, your memory changes,” she said. “It’s the same reason why I haven’t watched any of my S.N.L. performances. It’s just, like, I want to keep that for me. And I realized from the Pharrell stuff when you watch it back it changes your memory. And I want to really protect the way I’m remembering things.” “Heard It in a Past Life” is a collection of buoyant electronic pop songs, but the lyrics are unmistakably the work of an introvert struggling to recalibrate. “Oh, I couldn’t stop it,” she sings on “Light On.” “Tried to slow it all down/Crying in the bathroom, had to figure it out/With everyone around me saying ‘You must be so happy now.’” The first line of the opening song, “Give a Little,” is “If I was who I was before”; the last track is a triumphant ballad called “Back in My Body.” Rogers is not coy about the work’s autobiographical component; she describes the album as an attempt to process everything she’s experienced since 2016 and take back control of the narrative around her career. “Part of success is having a good story, and as a journalist I totally understand,” she said. “But it meant that my many, many years of focus and hard work got kind of prepackaged into a Cinderella story. I’m super grateful that it happened, but it left me feeling like I never got to be a full human in the experience.” After the Pharrell video caught fire, Rogers quickly found herself the focus of an old-fashioned record-company bidding war; one prospective label wooed her with her a first edition of Virginia Woolf’s “To the Lighthouse.” Rogers took a hard-nosed approach to this courtship process. Many of the executives hoping to sign her were industry veterans who had been mentioned or interviewed in Goodman’s book; before meeting them, Rogers cross-referenced their names in her database of transcripts. “I would show up with ammo,” she said. “Really minute stories from their lives, like where they were on 9/11, or that time they tried to sign the Killers in 2007. And during these interviews, inevitably, when I was the only woman in the room and these men started talking over me, I would pull out these stories and people would look at me like they’d seen a ghost.” Rogers eventually signed to Capitol and an EP, “Now That the Light Is Fading,” appeared in 2017. But she did insist on taking a bit more time with a full-length album — a decision that challenged, but didn’t discourage, her new label home. “Ultimately we trusted her, because nobody knows her better than herself,” said Michelle Jubelirer, the chief operating officer of Capitol Music Group. “It became very clear early on that there was a lot more to her than a viral moment — that she was an artist with a real soul, and something to say, and a modern pop star with a strong female point of view.” Rogers found promoting the EP psychologically draining. She’d studied branding and marketing at N.Y.U., but branding and marketing herself was a different challenge. Even when interviewers complimented “Alaska” by telling her “I love that song Pharrell made for you,” Rogers felt obligated to be polite. She remembers feeling like she’d allowed a “cocktail party version of myself” to take over. “I became pleasant,” she said, which was not the goal. “The only thing I wanted to do in my music is be human, and communicate all the aspects of that, which often means being vulnerable. Those are the kinds of artists I’ve looked up to and the kinds of artists I’ve worked really hard to be like. Being pleasant is great, but it’s not the whole picture.” “The Pharrell video cut my body and soul in half,” she added. (Her tone suggested that this experience had been painful, but also on some level fascinating.) “I felt such an intense sense of displacement, and I’m only now to a place where I can like breathe normally again and start to relax and remember who I was before this.” "

Its very few lyrics counsel isolation and detachment for fear of provoking that “ill wind.” They’re set to one of Radiohead’s morose bossa novas, at first akin to “Knives Out”: a nest of minor-key counterpoint on guitar and bass. But then more layers arrive, fluty sounds and buzzy ones, swallowing the song before prettily fading out. What seemed like a sanctuary was a trap. JON PARELES More seemingly left field but in fact totally harmonious cross-genre collaborations in 2019, please. The young country star Kane Brown brings adds an earthy sincerity to Khalid’s soothing delivery of angst on this remix of “Saturday Nights,” and Juice WRLD drizzles his melodically sweet melancholy on Halsey’s impressively stern scold “Without Me.” JON CARAMANICA Adia Victoria, a songwriter from South Carolina who’s now based in Nashville, offers a terse taxonomy of breakups in “Different Kind of Love,” from her second album due next month. “Some of them I knew it best to hesitate/Some I’ve never seen again,” she notes. The setting seems retro at first: a hypnotic rockabilly shuffle with a hefty backbeat and plenty of reverb on the guitar, soon to be punched up by a saxophone section. But it’s not back-to-basics: extra guitars and other, more elusive sounds thicken the mix, as Victoria gets around to a classic, nonnegotiable demand: “Tell me, who do you love?” PARELES The pop-punk trio Pottymouth, three women who have been working together since their teens, confronts aging with a galloping punk-rock beat in — really, this is not a high number — “22.” Abby Weems sings, “Oh, 22 — I still do what I used to do.” And why not? Their speed and passion haven’t faded. PARELES Two Washington, D.C. trios that aren’t afraid to think and rock at the same time are returning this spring: Ex Hex’s “It’s Real” is due March 22 and Priests’ “The Seduction of Kansas” will be released on April 5. Priests’ title track is like a semiotics class set to an arty dance beat: the singer Katie Alice Greer flings around signifiers of American culture — Superman, Dorothy, Applebee’s — before repeating a vow that teeters between genuine and controlling: “It’s true, I’m the one that loves you.” Ex Hex, led by Helium and Wild Flag’s Mary Timony, start off with a surfy bop that glances back to the Ramones’ interpretation of girl-group pop. Their lips aren’t sealed. CARYN GANZ A stark stunner from Lana Del Rey, narrating as someone who’s “24/7 Sylvia Plath/Writing in blood on your walls/‘Cause the ink in my pen don’t look good in my pad.” The arrangement is minimal piano, haunting as an empty, dark cave. And Del Rey spins into deliciously morbid, almost absurdist lyrics: “Hello, it’s the most famous woman you know on the iPad/Calling from beyond the grave, I just wanna say, ‘Hi, Dad.’” CARAMANICA A random rebound hookup: That’s the premise of “Dancing with a Stranger.” It isn’t much of a duet; it’s more like a pair of solos telling parallel stories. “Look what you made me do/I’m with somebody new,” Sam Smith and Normani sing together, while they head off to separate trysts. PARELES The Weeknd is back to his louche ways on “Lost in the Fire,” the second single from “Hyperion,” the forthcoming album by the gloomy French electro-house producer Gesaffelstein. The mood is overcast 1980s Miami, and the singing blends empathy with eroticism. No one is better than the Weeknd at underscoring the trauma common to both. CARAMANICA The Texas bluesman Gary Clark Jr. announces that he’s “paranoid and pissed-off” as he charges into the title song of his coming album, “This Land,” declaring that he’s bought himself 50 acres “right in the middle of Trump country” and is braced for racist neighbors: “I see you looking out your window/Can’t wait to call the police on me.” All the tones are confrontational and raw: a distorted bass line, Clark’s not-always-in-tune lead guitar, his gruff voice, an underlying blues-meets-reggae riff. The video imagery invokes slavery, lynchings, Confederate flags and cross-burning bonfires. “I’m America’s son,” he taunts. “This is where I come from.” PARELES Here is the #MeToo movement in action, simultaneously methodical and melodic. The midtempo folk-rock behind Stella Donnelly’s voice doesn’t telegraph her fury, but she’s reading a self-defense manual and preparing to execute painful moves against someone — married, prosperous, powerful — who is acting inappropriately. “Are you scared of me old man,” she sings, “or are you scared of what I’ll do?” PARELES Kassa Overall’s new album — the irreverently titled “Go Get Ice Cream and Listen to Jazz” — attests to the diverse musical identity of this drummer, producer and rapper. It’s one of the few genuine-sounding, full-scope amalgams of contemporary hip-hop and jazz to surface in recent years. On “Who’s on the Playlist,” as the pianist Sullivan Fortner traces the chords to Miles Davis and Bill Evans’s “Blue in Green,” Overall, 36, daubs his snare drum with brushes, then adds a splatter of electronic percussion. He starts the track with a mumbly, ironic Master P quote before cracking a window into his heart on a verse that grows tensile and urgent before stopping up short. Judi Jackson, a young British jazz singer, shows that the interdisciplinary spirit is contagious — or at least, generational: She sings in an Erykah Badu purr for most of the song, then rattles off a cold rap verse. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO “Human,” an electronic instrumental by the Swedish composer Tomas Nordmark, has a meditative, nearly ambient foundation: sustained, consonant tones like distant horns. But the foreground is jittery, full of unpredictable, glassy tones that briefly hover, then disappear. Mood: inscrutable. PARELES "
5c81719b49f0eacbf105be7d,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/07/books/review/mark-synnott-impossible-climb-alex-honnold.html,"THE IMPOSSIBLE CLIMB Alex Honnold, El Capitan and the Climbing Life By Mark Synnott When he was 10, Mark Synnott asked his father what happens when you die. “You’re worm food,” his dad replied. The horror of nothingness! The absence of anything! Cue an adolescent obsession with what Synnott calls “risk-taking as an existential salve.” As a teenager in New Hampshire, he organized his ski-racing buddies and led them up cliffs and into half-frozen water, assigning prizes and ranks as motivation in his own invented game of institutionalized chicken. He’s compelled less by death itself, it seems, than by taunting the moment when death becomes inevitable: after you’ve fallen, before you hit the ground. Fast forward, and it’s no surprise that the daredevil teenager became a full-time rock climber. Climbing allows him to enter “the now” — what Buddhists might call mindfulness — not just while clinging to rocks in midair but while “strolling down a fairway or looking out the window at a birch tree swaying in the breeze. That’s … when I knew I had found my calling, the reason I was alive — to seek out and climb the great big walls of the world.” Synnott’s new book, “The Impossible Climb” — part memoir, part exploration of the climbing culture — gives context for Alex Honnold’s historic unroped ascent of El Capitan, Yosemite’s 3,000-foot slab of “glacier-polished granite” (a climb that was recently documented in the film “Free Solo”). Synnott lays out a series of generational portraits of climbing communities, chronicling the rise and fall of progressive dirtbag cultures along with the waves of ethical debate that have characterized each generation. Is it cool to put bolts in walls? What about, like, a lot of bolts? How about “spraying” — a climber’s term for gossiping about private accomplishments — or climbing in vulnerable ecosystems? If you fall while climbing and get caught by a rope, do you have to start over at the bottom? If Synnott’s own generation has an enduring question, it’s how to balance the solitary ethos of climbing with the demands of an audience hungry for coverage, particularly in the first years of internet storytelling. After Synnott’s 1999 ascent of Trango in northern Pakistan, heavily documented by the now-defunct sports website Quokka, a climbing purist wrote in The American Alpine Journal that the ascent was “business climbing” — a sick burn if there ever was one. “Were their accomplishments equitable with the amount of publicity it garnered?” the critic asks. They were not. But do they need to be? Synnott grapples with these questions even as he takes sponsorships that place him in the cross hairs of the discussion. When the North Face hires its first team of professional climbers in 1994 — a heretofore unheard-of position that introduces the politics of corporate alignment to daredevils on the fringes — Synnott isn’t among them, but he does make the team in a subsequent year, further enabling both his quest for adventure and his corporate allegiance. “Sellout” is an insult, sure, but it’s also a code word for success, and money makes adventures happen. Enter Alex Honnold, wunderkind and weirdo, another North Face athlete who’s assigned to a trek in Borneo with Synnott. Honnold is a self-proclaimed “total loser,” a World of Warcraft aficionado who sometimes goes months without talking to other people — and his climbs are so extraordinary that when he posts one to a climbing chat room on April 1, 2008, people think it’s a hoax. Honnold is volatile, dorky and self-absorbed; he eschews helmets, reads New Yorker articles while driving and harasses climbing partners about how much salt they put on their food. He falls into crevasses and crawls out giggling. He’s selfish, a mutual friend reports, “in the way that a psychopath is selfish” — but as he grows famous, as “close to being a household name in America as any climber had ever been,” he starts an eponymous foundation for renewable energy, funneling a third of his income into it each year. Being broke, living in his van, isn’t risky to Honnold. It’s not like falling off a cliff, or perhaps going through life without finding a community where misfits can shine and excel. The tensions and friendship between the two men propel the latter half of “The Impossible Climb,” both in and between the lines. A chapter about studies of Honnold’s brain (his amygdala, which regulates psychological response to fear, seems less active than other people’s) is loaded with Synnott’s implicit question: Why can’t I be like that? Can I be like that? [ Read our review of “Free Solo,” the Academy Award-winning documentary about Honnold’s El Capitan feat. ] “The Impossible Climb” is an accomplished portrait of two remarkable lives — but its major weakness, of both style and imagination, lies in Synnott’s depictions of women. Professional climbing is largely a man’s world, but rather than examine this dynamic as he does countless others, Synnott uses descriptions that further diminish and objectify the women he encounters. Consider one whom the men meet in Borneo: She has a name, but we don’t know it, because the men dub her Hello Kitty. What do we learn about Hello Kitty? She’s petite, she has big breasts and — in a moment that clearly looms large in Synnott’s memory — she goes braless at breakfast one morning. Other women are “feisty,” “effervescent,” “sexy,” “voluptuous” or have a “smile that would make most men melt.” The top-ranked climber Emily Harrington is “spunky and quite attractive.” These lazy descriptions are startling given Synnott’s nuanced treatment of even incidental male characters, but the contrast is no coincidence. Like a jazz record or a dog-eared book by Dostoyevsky, the women here are simply another tool for characterizing the men around them — as well as vehicles for Synnott’s fascination with the younger Honnold’s sex life. This fascination is shameless and enduring, fitting into themes of aging that build throughout the book. Aging is, after all, what happens if you don’t die, and after decades of risk-taking, Synnott is finally forced to grapple with the consequences of survival. Nearing 40, he begins to age out of his calling. Many of his friends have died in the field. He has been frequently apart from his four children (in the acknowledgments, he writes that he hopes the book will help them understand the sport that has drawn him away from the “responsibilities of being a husband and a father”). Perhaps this is why, in later chapters, Synnott’s descriptions of Honnold seem saturated with longing and insecurity. Synnott wants what Honnold has: acclaim, sex, relative youth, apparent fearlessness, long lines for autographs at public events. Honnold — in an evaluation that would horrify Synnott’s younger self — calls his older friend, who grows ever more square, “Mr. Safety.” The book concludes with a white-knuckle account of its titular climb, Honnold’s groundbreaking ascent of El Capitan. Before his first attempt, surrounded by media who see Honnold as a superhero, Synnott wants to ask him, “Do you feel trapped by who you have become?” But he bites his tongue. Maybe he doesn’t want to know the answer. Maybe he’s afraid that the answer is no. The famous climb, when it happens, isn’t just a triumph over gravity; it’s a triumph over the author. If Honnold is peaking as an athlete, it means that Synnott’s time of climbing glory, like those of so many before him, is finally coming to an end. "
5c5795f33a125f5075c07d67,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/03/arts/music/super-bowl-halftime-show.html,"Maroon 5 — a quasi-soul, quasi-rock, utterly funkless band — was the main attraction at the Super Bowl halftime show at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, likely the third or eighth or maybe 14th choice for a headliner. In a year in which the Super Bowl halftime show has become a referendum on political mindfulness, in which the N.F.L. has become a staging ground for conversations about racial justice in America, Maroon 5 was a cynically apt choice. It is neutral, inoffensive, sleek without promising too much. For nearly two decades, it has been wildly popular without leaving much of a musical mark, as easy to forget as mild weather. And the band did no better during its 13 and a half minutes onstage, in a performance that was dynamically flat, mushy at the edges, worthy of something much worse than derision: a shrug. It was an inessential performance from a band that might have lost some moral authority if it had any moral authority to lose. Perhaps for the N.F.L., which probably sought to make the halftime performance as anodyne as possible, this was a victory. But what saddles Maroon 5 as a band — its propensity to pretend lithe things are thumping, its commitment to thinning out the soul and rock of the 1970s and 1980s until they’re so brittle they might snap — doomed this performance, which blithely skated through a half-dozen of the band’s hits. [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] And in a year in which the political valence of the halftime show mattered more than ever, the band’s stubborn resistance was glaring. The N.F.L. canceled the traditional news conference for performers this year, looking to avoid a fiasco. But the frontman Adam Levine did do an interview with “Entertainment Tonight” in which he suggested that the choice to perform at the halftime show triggers in some an “insatiable urge to hate a little bit.” “No one thought about it more than I did,” he added, not very reassuringly. “I’m not in the right profession if I can’t handle a little bit of controversy.” Efforts to blunt Maroon 5’s dullness, and its political aversion, were being made for weeks before the formal announcement that it would be the headliner. In December, Variety reported that the band had approached a half-dozen black artists to appear as part of the performance. But the decision of whether to perform was now oriented around the protests of Colin Kaepernick and other N.F.L. players, who in 2016 began taking a knee during the national anthem (or otherwise not standing at attention) as a means of drawing attention to the systemic oppression of black people in this country. The halftime show — one of the biggest stages in pop, and also an unpaid performance on behalf of the N.F.L. — became radioactive. Perform, and be perceived as a shill for the league. (Kaepernick is pursuing a grievance against the N.F.L., accusing team owners of colluding to keep him from playing in the league.) Ultimately, Maroon 5 — a band that hasn’t had a Top 20 hit without a black or Latina guest performer in four years — was joined by Travis Scott, hip-hop’s most energetic performer, but not one much troubled by political concerns. (Last month, Scott announced he would, in partnership with the N.F.L., donate $500,000 to a nonprofit organization, Dream Corps.) Also added to the performance was Big Boi — one half of Outkast, and an Atlanta rap elder — which felt like an attempt at moral cover. Online petitions requested all of the performers take a knee in support of Kaepernick and his goals. No one did. For what it’s worth, the toxicity of being associated with the Super Bowl didn’t appear to extend beyond the halftime performance. Chance the Rapper performed in a Doritos commercial (with the Backstreet Boys); 2 Chainz was entertaining in an ad for Expensify; Cardi B and Lil Jon tag-teamed in a Pepsi ad. Both of the pregame performances were by black artists: a taut, controlled reading of “America the Beautiful” by Chloe x Halle and an impressive, if Disney-saccharine, national anthem from Gladys Knight, who before the game criticized Kaepernick for making the anthem a site of protest. In this context, Maroon 5 was a dead band walking: a base coat destined to be painted over. Three years ago, Beyoncé effectively hijacked Coldplay’s performance for one of the most rousing and politically savvy halftime performances ever. But nothing even remotely on that scale happened here. Scott and Big Boi were ushered on and offstage quickly, boxes that had been checked off. Scott bark-rapped his way through “Sicko Mode,” and at the end of his moment, fell backward onto the crowd, as close to his mayhem-filled live shows as circumstances allowed. Big Boi emerged in a Cadillac wearing a fur coat — the most exciting moment of the whole show — and did a casual pass at Outkast’s “The Way You Move,” with Sleepy Brown. When Levine joined them for a synchronized two-step, it took him a second or two to catch the groove. "
5c535cca3a125f5075c0764d,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/obituaries/harold-bradley-dead.html,"NASHVILLE — Harold Bradley, who played on thousands of country, pop and rock ’n’ roll recordings, including landmark hits like Brenda Lee’s “I’m Sorry,” Patsy Cline’s “Crazy” and Roy Orbison’s “Only the Lonely,” died on Thursday in Nashville. He was 93. His death, at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, was confirmed by his daughter Beverly Bradley. Beginning in the 1940s, Mr. Bradley’s work on six-string bass and guitar was also featured on records by, among many others, Red Foley, Hank Williams, Elvis Presley, Buddy Holly, the Everly Brothers and Loretta Lynn. Mr. Bradley, known for his spare, soulful playing, also played banjo and other instruments. But according to Guitar Player magazine and other sources, he is among the most recorded guitarists in history. The younger brother of the pioneering record producer Owen Bradley, Mr. Bradley also served for decades as the de facto leader of Nashville’s A-Team, the elite circle of first-call session musicians immortalized in the Lovin’ Spoonful’s 1966 Top 10 hit “Nashville Cats.” “Clear as country water” is how that song characterized the intuitive, uncluttered playing of the team under Mr. Bradley’s direction, an expansive ensemble that also included the pianist Floyd Cramer and the pedal steel guitarist Pete Drake. By the late ’60s, the group’s laid-back, no-frills approach drew folk and rock luminaries like Bob Dylan, Joan Baez and the Byrds to Nashville to record with them. “Everything that was happening in the studio — that was my world; that was as big as it got,” Mr. Bradley said, looking back on Nashville’s 1950s and ’60s heyday in a 2013 interview with NPR. “And then one day, my brother came up and he said, ‘We’ve got 25 out of the top 50 songs,’ ” Mr. Bradley continued, referring to the profusion of hit singles that featured Nashville’s A-Team. “All of a sudden I’m thinking, ‘That stuff we did in the studio, people are listening to that all over the world.’ ” Although he was a capable lead guitarist, Mr. Bradley made his mark as a rhythm specialist. His signature style featured a clicking, propulsive figure, often performed on six-string electric bass, that mimicked the lines of the acoustic bass. Known among industry insiders as “tic tac,” Mr. Bradley’s less-is-more approach furnished the supple rhythm bed for both Eddy Arnold’s “Make the World Go Away” and Tammy Wynette’s “Stand by Your Man.” In the process he helped shape not only the pop-inflected “Nashville sound” of singers like Mr. Arnold and Ms. Cline, but also the more soulful “countrypolitan” sound of Ms. Wynette, George Jones and Conway Twitty. As accomplished an entrepreneur as he was a musician, Mr. Bradley, with his brother Owen and Owen’s son Jerry, was among the first to build independent music studios on Nashville’s Music Row. By 1955 the three of them had merged their initial two ventures into Bradley Film and Recordings Studios, a musicians’ haven more commonly known as the Quonset Hut. During its first months of operation, the Quonset Hut produced blockbuster hits like Gene Vincent’s “Be-Bop-a-Lula,” Marty Robbins’s “Singing the Blues” and Sonny James’s “Young Love.” By the time Columbia Records purchased the facility in 1962, the Bradleys, along with visionary record executives like Chet Atkins and Don Law, had established Nashville as a major recording center. Later in his career, as subsequent generations of studio players rose to prominence and he worked fewer sessions, Mr. Bradley became active in the Nashville chapter of the American Federation of Musicians. From 1991 to 2008 he was the union’s president. He was also vice president of the international division for more than a decade. Mr. Bradley was elected to the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2006. He was the first instrumentalist without a significant career as a solo artist to be so honored. Harold Ray Bradley was born on Jan. 2, 1926, in Nashville, one of six children. His father, Vernon, was a salesman for Cumberland Tobacco Works for 46 years. His mother, Letha Maie (Owen) Bradley, was a homemaker. Mr. Bradley first learned to play the tenor banjo, but he switched his focus to guitar after his brother Owen observed that guitarists were in greater demand than banjo players. At 17 he became lead guitarist in Ernest Tubb’s band, the Texas Troubadours. After serving in the Navy from 1944 to 1946, he returned to Nashville and began playing in his brother’s local dance orchestra, which featured the future pop stars Snooky Lanson and Kitty Kallen as vocalists. Mr. Bradley worked his first studio session in Chicago in 1946, recording with the Grand Ole Opry star Pee Wee King and his Golden West Boys. He did not make his Nashville session debut until four years later (the city would not emerge as a recording hub until the 1950s), when he played acoustic guitar on Red Foley’s “Chattanoogie Shoe Shine Boy,” a No. 1 country and pop hit. Mr. Bradley also produced numerous television variety shows and movie soundtracks and made a brief appearance in Robert Altman’s acclaimed 1975 film, “Nashville.” In addition to his daughter Beverly, Mr. Bradley is survived by his wife of 66 years, Eleanor Allen Bradley; another daughter, Bari Bradley Brooks; and two grandchildren. Although he released three instrumental albums under his own name, Mr. Bradley regarded himself primarily as a contributor to the work of others. “We had a setup,” he said, reflecting modestly on his decades as a session musician in Nashville in 2013. “We would work from 10 to 1, 2 to 5, 6 to 9 and 10 to 1 at night,” he continued. “To me, it was like going to a party. A Brenda Lee party in the morning, then a Ray Stevens party in the afternoon. A Bill Monroe party and then end up with Henry Mancini and Patsy Cline and Elvis and just other people. I was just glad to be on board.” "
5c9a79fa49f0eacbf105f280,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/26/obituaries/scott-walker-dead.html,"Scott Walker, who with his American pop group, the Walker Brothers, became a teenage idol in Britain in the 1960s, but who later immersed himself in experimental music that influenced artists like David Bowie and Radiohead, died on Friday in London. He was 76. His record label, 4AD, said the cause was cancer. He had been living in England since the 1960s. The Walker Brothers arrived in England in early 1965, reversing the earlier British invasion of America. There, the group — made up of Mr. Walker (his real name was Noel Scott Engel), a dramatic baritone who played bass; John Maus, a guitarist and vocalist; and Gary Leeds, the drummer, all of whom used the surname Walker — found the success that had eluded them in the United States. Though their popularity never reached Beatlemania levels, their fans, like those of the Beatles, would scream during their performances — and, in one harrowing incident, turned over a van taking them from a concert in Dublin. Evoking the blue-eyed soul of the Righteous Brothers, the Walker Brothers had several hits, two of which rose to No. 1 on the British charts: “Make It Easy on Yourself,” a ballad by Burt Bacharach and Hal David, and “The Sun Ain’t Gonna Shine Anymore,” which had first been recorded by Frankie Valli of the Four Seasons. Both songs also rose to the Top 20 of the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States. Mr. Walker left the group in 1967 to start a solo career that became a rejection of his rock-star phase. In one iteration he recorded songs by the Belgian singer and songwriter Jacques Brel. But his most critical period was a retreat into the studio to create avant-garde music that was hard to categorize: ominous and clangorous, existential and electronic, with big blocks of sound, his baritone voice now used to almost operatic effect. For many years, he did not appear in concert. Reviewing a recording on which Mr. Walker collaborated with the metal band Sunn O))) in 2014, Ben Ratliff of The New York Times described his music as “intricate puzzles of shock, indiscretion, non-resolution, theatrical uses of text and extended technique, often with a 40-piece orchestra.” He added that Mr. Walker was always looking for a “whoops factor”— “a moment of incomprehension from the listener.” In a message on Twitter, Thom Yorke, the lead singer and main songwriter of Radiohead, wrote that Mr. Walker had shown him “how I could use my voice and words.” “Met him once at Meltdown,” he added, referring to the annual music and art festival in England, “such a kind gentle outsider.” Noel Scott Engel was born on Jan 9, 1943, in Hamilton, Ohio, about 30 miles north of Cincinnati, the only child of Noel and Elizabeth Marie (Fortier) Engel. His father was an oil company geologist whose job took the family to various cities. When Scott was about 6 his parents divorced, and he went to live in Denver with his mother. They subsequently moved to New York, where in the mid-1950s Scott, still a schoolboy, began his entertainment career. He had small roles in the Broadway musicals “Plain and Fancy” and “Pipe Dream” and recorded singles, including “When Is a Boy a Man?” (1957), as Scotty Engel — hoping, without success, to break through as a teenage idol. Many of those songs were later released in the compilation album “Looking Back With Scott Walker” (1968). Around 1960 he and his mother moved to Los Angeles, where he attended high school and the Chouinard Art Institute. He also played in various music groups, worked as a session bassist and, in 1964, formed the Walker Brothers with Mr. Maus (who had already been using John Walker as a pseudonym). They played at the Whisky a Go Go and other clubs along the Sunset Strip. Although the best-known songs of his Walker Brothers period did not portend how radical his music would become, Mr. Walker began to demonstrate a willingness to free himself from the conventions of pop and rock as early as 1967, when he began releasing a series of solo albums — “Scott,” “Scott 2,” Scott 3” and “Scott 4.” He did so again on “Nite Flights” (1978), an album made during a brief reunion of the Walker Brothers. Along the way, he found an admirer in David Bowie. Mr. Bowie, a transcendent musical experimenter, was in a relationship with a woman who had dated Mr. Walker and kept his albums. Mr. Bowie listened to the music and became so enamored that he later took the role of executive producer of  “Scott Walker: 30 Century Man” (2007), a documentary directed by Stephen Kijak. “I like the way he can paint a picture with what he says,” Mr. Bowie said in the film. “I had no idea what he was singing about. And I didn’t care.” Mr. Walker, who worked on his albums slowly and meticulously, continued his musical evolution with “Climate of Hunter” (1984). With “Tilt” (1995) and “The Drift” (2006), he drew closer to matching his ambition to his creative visions — and to those that crept into his mind while he slept. “I have a very nightmarish imagination,” he said in the documentary, which focuses on the recording of “The Drift.” He added: “I’ve had bad dreams all my life. Everything in my life is big, it’s out of proportion.” “Clara,” a song on “The Drift,” reimagines the executions of  Benito Mussolini and his mistress, Claretta Petacci, at the hands of Italian partisans in 1945. (It was inspired by newsreels Mr. Walker had seen as a child.) Another song, “Jesse,” imagines a conversation between Elvis Presley and Jesse, his stillborn twin brother, as a vehicle to write about the destruction of the World Trade Center. In a plaintive, eerie vocal reminiscent of Mr. Bowie, Mr. Walker sings: Fame is a tall, tall tower A building left in the night Jesse, are you listening? It casts ruins in shadows Under Memphis moonlight Jesse, are you listening? Howard Kaylan, a founding member of the Turtles, said in a 2013 interview that he had been listening to Mr. Walker since the 1960s. He was a fan of the Walker Brothers, he said, but thought of Mr. Walker’s solo music as the work of genius. “My jaw hit the ground when I heard ‘Tilt,’ ” Mr. Kaylan told the newspaper Record Collector News. “And by the time he got to ‘Drift,’ I understood what he was doing: He is doing the most conventional pop music I ever heard. He is just doing it as if he was observing it from outer space and then trying to tell you what he saw as an alien.” Mr. Walker’s survivors include his partner, Beverly; his daughter, Lee; and a granddaughter. Mr. Maus died in 2011. Some of Mr. Walker’s lyrics were published last year in the book “Sundog,” with an introduction by the Irish novelist Eimear McBride, who compared Mr. Walker to James Joyce. “Walker’s work, as Joyce’s before it, is a complex synesthesia of thought, feeling, the doings of the physical world and the weight of foreign objects slowly ground together down into diamond,” Ms. McBride wrote. “This is not art for the passive. It does not impart comfort or ease. Tempests will not be reconciled by the final bars, and no one is going home any more.” "
5c87d23149f0eacbf105ca2e,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/12/world/asia/seungri-prostitution-south-korea.html,"HONG KONG — A leading K-pop singer has been formally named as a suspect in an investigation into accusations of prostitution and sexual misconduct at nightclubs in South Korea. The police in Seoul, South Korea, said that the singer, Lee Seung-hyun, 28, who performs under the name Seungri and is a member of the boy band Big Bang, was suspected of “offering sexual services” in 2015. Local news reports, citing what they said were leaked posts from a messaging app, said Mr. Lee was accused of arranging for investors to receive sexual favors at a nightclub called Arena. Mr. Lee has denied the accusations against him, but said that he would nonetheless retire from the entertainment scene to protect the reputation of his band and of the talent agency that manages it, YG Entertainment. “I will take the investigation seriously to clear all the allegations,” he wrote in an Instagram post on Monday. Mr. Lee is not in custody, and YG Entertainment said he would begin his mandatory military service on March 25. The police said they had made arrangements for the investigation to continue after he enlisted. The investigation appears to have begun after video circulated online that was said to have shown a man being assaulted by employees at another nightclub, Burning Sun, which Mr. Lee has promoted. According to local media reports, the man said he was trying to defend a woman who had been molested at the club. Lee Moon-ho, the head of Burning Sun, was questioned by the police for 10 hours, according to local news reports. In a statement he posted to Instagram before deleting his personal account, he said that many unfounded rumors were circulating about misconduct at the club — he cited claims of police collusion, drugging and sexual assault of women, and drug sales — but that the alleged assault on the man was the only confirmed episode. “On the cases related to Burning Sun that I did not know about, I will actively participate in the investigations to ensure that the truth is quickly uncovered and I am making efforts to prevent these issues from arising again,” he wrote. Prostitution is illegal in South Korea, but businessmen are thought to sometimes arrange illicit sexual encounters in exchange for deals. As Seungri, Lee Seung-hyun has an outsize presence in Seoul’s night life and music scene, and also has his own chain of ramen restaurants. He has cultivated an image evoking F. Scott Fitzgerald’s Jay Gatsby, with a solo tour and album under the title “The Great Seungri.” Representatives from Arena declined to comment. Spokesmen for Burning Sun could not be reached for further comment; a representative was quoted in the South Korean daily Kyunghyang Shinmun as saying that Seungri was part of its management, but not its owner. The chief executive of YG Entertainment said in a statement that Seungri was no longer executive director at the club, and that he would be resigning from his business roles before he enlisted in the military. The accusations have rocked fans from South Korea and abroad. Some defended the star and lamented his downfall, while more than 200,000 others signed a petition calling for the police to punish him, and to act on other allegations of corruption and drug crimes against women at adult entertainment venues. “We demand self-reflection among male celebrities who are the perpetrators and abettors of rape culture; who saw women as sexual tools rather than human beings to be respected, actively participated in crime or condoned, assisted or enjoyed it,” Digital Sexual Crime Out, a feminist activist group, said in a statement. “We also demand self-reflection among men who related to these male celebrities and consumed the case as simple gossip.” "
5cae2ec449f0eacbf1f8268c,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/10/arts/music/bruce-hornsby-absolute-zero-review.html,"One way for a songwriter to invigorate a long career is to keep breaking routines, to change up methods and parameters and solve different puzzles with every album. It’s a modus operandi that has carried Bruce Hornsby from radio hits in the 1980s through bluegrass, jazz, a stint in the Grateful Dead and, lately, collaborations with a younger-generation fan, Justin Vernon of Bon Iver. “Absolute Zero,” his 21st album, is one more daring, rewarding turn in his catalog: 10 knotty, thoughtful yet rambunctious songs that juggle scientific concepts, history and human relationships. “Absolute Zero” makes a 180-degree pendulum swing from Hornsby’s 2016 album, “Rehab Reunion.” On that record, Hornsby set aside the piano for songs built around the dulcimer, with basic folky harmonies and string-band-centered arrangements. “Absolute Zero,” in contrast, doubles down on piano virtuosity and musical intricacies: odd meters, polytonality, bustling counterpoint. In the new songs, Hornsby addresses a complex, distressing world with complex music, offering not an escape but a cleareyed recognition of 21st-century pressures and longings. In 2019, “Absolute Zero” is decisively untrendy. Its songs are dense, literate, hand-played and largely acoustic (though a collaboration with Vernon, a forlorn lover’s plaint titled “Cast-Off,” does slip in some electronics). Rather than build productions with synthetic sounds, for half of the album Hornsby brought in yMusic, the contemporary chamber sextet that has also worked lately with Paul Simon, and its violinist and arranger Rob Moose; other songs use string orchestras. Hornsby then juxtaposed the disembodied classical ensembles with sinewy little studio bands that can kick and swing in any meter. One of the puzzles Hornsby seems to have set for himself is seeing just how many pointillistic motifs he can set in motion without getting in the way of his voice. Ambition and exuberance merge in songs like “The Blinding Light of Dreams,” with pensive lyrics flung into complicated motion. “The Blinding Light of Dreams” reflects on the history of racism in the South, racing along on an insistent 13-note piano pattern and dodging dissonant interjections from yMusic. And “Voyager One” is a kind of multidimensional hoedown, with piano and yMusic meshing in overlapping riffs while Hornsby sings about space exploration and wonders if humanity will destroy itself before Voyager makes contact with other life-forms. “Let’s break out of our orbits, fix the world we all neglect/We share this little planet, our neighbors need respect,” he sings. Hornsby draws on science terms to get personal. In the title song of “Absolute Zero,” he imagines being cryogenically preserved for a century, awaiting “Another chance, maybe better next time”; sparse piano and sustained woodwinds suspend his voice as the drummer Jack DeJohnette pinpoints time still passing. In “Fractals,” Hornsby maps the infinitely replicating, mathematically generated chaos of fractals onto a romance: “Our love is a fractal/Curves and shapes irregular,” he sings. But first comes a brittle, two-handed, stop-start piano part that doesn’t quite establish a key or a beat. While he sings, percussion pecks at offbeats before settling into 4/4, while piano and pizzicato strings continue to pelt him with syncopation. Amid all the musical antics, Hornsby doesn’t lose perspective. The grain of his voice and his folky sense of melody still hold together all of the songs’ odd machinations. And midway through the album, he touches down on the kind of cozy, empathetic song that established him in the 1980s and continue to dot his albums. “Never in This House,” written with Chip DeMatteo, yearns for a stable family home where “all our problems disappear.” The piano is rich and hymnlike, the chamber ensemble is a supportive mini-orchestra; the music fulfills what the refrain — never in this house” — will not. It’s a brief point of repose on an album that thrives on its own restlessness. "
5c4f09c23a125f5075c06b01,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/28/arts/television/rent-live-review.html,"A longstanding superstition holds that saying the title of William Shakespeare’s “Macbeth” while inside a theater — unless you are rehearsing or performing the play itself — will bring about a terrible curse. The notion is based on an unfounded legend, but it makes you wonder what people were saying in the studio where “Rent: Live” was rehearsing the past few weeks. On Sunday, not long before the 8 p.m. curtain for the musical’s live broadcast on Fox, the network announced that Brennin Hunt, the actor playing Roger, seriously injured his foot while performing during the previous day’s dress rehearsal. Unlike on Broadway (and in most professional theater productions), the show did not have understudies for its leads. The solution? Much of what viewers would see would be Saturday’s recorded performance, the cast noted in a statement during an early commercial break. The final 15 minutes or so were live; Hunt was at a table, his foot in a cast and propped on a chair. (Hashtags like #RentNotLive and #RentKindaLive trended during the broadcast.) [Read more about the barely live “Rent: Live.”] It feels a bit weird to critique what was almost entirely a recorded dress rehearsal. How do you measure three hours of chaotic visuals and middling audio most of us were never meant to see and hear? Mostly in disappointment, I guess, though this is what Fox gave us. “Rent,” Jonathan Larson’s musical about a ragtag bunch of young squatters who self-righteously equate their refusal to pay their landlord to sticking it to The Man, debuted at New York Theater Workshop in 1996 and went on to become a Broadway juggernaut. But it’s a curious choice for a major network production. It’s not family friendly in the way that “The Sound of Music” or “The Wiz” are, or “Grease” sort of is. It’s a show so of its time (garage rock filtered through a Broadway sensibility!) that it can be easy to play down the impact it had as a daring, wildly progressive musical prominently featuring characters of color, queer romance and people living with (and dying from) AIDS, at a time when the disease and its victims were rarely front and center in pop culture. [See photos from the original production of “Rent.”] Few moments from “Rent: Live” evoked what made the show so special. The sound mixing was rough — characters’ voices were sometimes too soft, too loud or just too muddled to comprehend. It didn’t help that the overzealous crowd, perhaps primed from years of “American Idol” and the like, chimed in to “woo” and cheer whenever an actor belted a long note — which, if you aren’t familiar with “Rent,” occurs a lot.  In the case of “Today 4 U,” a musical showcase for the larger-than-life optimist Angel (Valentina, a star of “RuPaul’s Drag Race”), the audience was so hyped it drowned out much of her vocals. Also too muddled to comprehend: the frantic, overwrought camerawork. “Rent: Live” was directed by Michael Greif, who oversaw the original Broadway production, and Alex Rudzinski, but they both seemed to be channeling Baz Luhrmann. The cameras swooped around the sprawling stage erratically, without any ostensible purpose other than to distinguish this from feeling like a theater production. During “Will I?,” a simple melody sung by the chorus in a round, the focus shifted dizzily from one character to another, effectively dulling the moment’s emotional resonance. As with network TV’s other recent live musicals, the cast was a mix of stage and screen performers, along with a couple of pop stars. The results were all over the place: The R&B singers Tinashe and Mario, playing Mimi and Benny, did fine, but they weren’t standouts. Jordan Fisher’s Mark was lithe and fun to watch while dancing, particularly during “La Vie Boheme.” The highlights included Vanessa Hudgens as the flighty performance artist and activist Maureen and Kiersey Clemons as her uptight lawyer girlfriend, Joanne, performing “Take Me or Leave Me.” It’s a fun duet brimming with flirtations and frustrations, a favorite song of countless high school theater nerds (like me) and karaoke enthusiasts — and Hudgens and Clemons nailed it in the dress rehearsal, convincingly playing the feverish couple at a crossroads while hitting those notes. As Collins, the Broadway actor Brandon Victor Dixon (who played Judas in last spring’s live TV broadcast of “Jesus Christ Superstar”) also gave a towering performance during the number “I’ll Cover You (Reprise).” He brought soul and the pangs of grief and loss into every lyric, and when the chorus joined in, it was haunting. Around 10:45 p.m., the would-be live show finally became live. Unfortunately, the last few songs of “Rent” are some of the musical’s most unremarkable, as the story hurtles awkwardly toward its jarring ending. [Read The Times’s original review of “Rent.”] Yet in those moments, as the characters comforted one another during the final song and cast members from the original Broadway production, including Idina Menzel, Taye Diggs and Anthony Rapp, appeared onstage for “Seasons of Love,” I regretted that these hard-working performers didn’t get to put on the show that they had signed up for (even if the fully live “Rent” probably would have suffered from the same maddening camera whiplash and bad sound). Yes, it was disappointing. But clearly there was love in this production, too. "
5c76e81249f0eacbf105a7e5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/27/arts/music/adia-victoria-silences.html,"Adia Victoria, a 32-year-old songwriter who grew up in rural South Carolina and is based in Nashville, likes to call herself a “modern blues woman.” In her music, the blues is a baseline and a frame of mind, not a genre boundary; it pushes her to take risks. “I want to make the blues dangerous again,” she said in an interview a few days ago, sharing the back seat of a car-service van crawling through rush-hour traffic to visit Eastern Parkway in Brooklyn, where she lived in the early 2000s. Over a black outfit she wore a sleek, vivid red overcoat, a $5 find at Goodwill. “The blues isn’t just a sound,” she said. “I think that’s something that white people have really gone and goofed on, thinking that they’ve pegged down the blues and they can package it. When you do that, then some wily black woman is going to come and subvert you every single time, and here I am. The blues needs to move.” There’s nothing antiquarian or purist about Victoria’s new second album, “Silences.” She produced it with Aaron Dessner, from the majestically pensive indie-rock band the National, and its tracks deploy orchestral arrangements and synthesizers along with bluesy shuffles and a soul horn section. In a show last Friday at Rough Trade NYC in Brooklyn, Victoria’s set included songs from both the foundational Delta bluesman Robert Johnson and the English trip-hop band Portishead. “She’s a very strong conceptual artist and thinker,” Dessner said by telephone from Hudson, N.Y., where he has his studio. “It was less about song forms and melody and harmony and some of the things you usually think about when producing, and more about the story.” Victoria has always been ambitious. On “Silences,” she sings about fear, love, death, salvation, the devil, artistic compromise, a woman’s self-determination, the allure of the city and solitude as a refuge. Her reference points are literary as well as musical. The title of her 2016 debut album, “Beyond the Bloodhounds,” came from an 1861 memoir, “Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl,” by Harriet Jacobs. “Silences” shares its title with a book by Tillie Olsen about women whose creativity was stifled by domestic burdens. In Nashville, she is collaborating with two poets, Caroline Randall Williams and Ciona Rouse, on a book and spoken-word project imagining a blues woman named Rosie. “She’s channeling the ancestors through a very intentionally and carefully crafted filter,” Williams said by phone from Nashville. “She is so rigorous about surrounding herself with art that shakes her and moves her and has an emotional and cultural context, whether she is sitting and reading new wave French poetry or practicing relentlessly — make-up-free and exhausted at the crack of dawn — Mississippi John Hurt scales. All of that is her weaving the mesh of her filter. She’s thinking about what work the blues is meant to do.” Victoria’s music is simultaneously rooted and restless, reflecting a peripatetic life. Adia Victoria Paul — her full name — was raised in a strictly religious Seventh-day Adventist family that imbued her with biblical teachings and thoughts of mortality. She dropped out of high school and started to embark on impulsive journeys. Because she loved the movie “Amélie,” she bought a plane ticket to visit Paris on the day George W. Bush was re-elected in 2004. Back in the United States, she decided to move to Brooklyn because she loved songs by the Strokes. In 2008 she moved to Atlanta, where she started playing guitar and delving into the blues while she made a good living as a cable-service telemarketer. “I learned how to talk to people for the first time,” she said. “That was like my charm school.” She relocated to Nashville, where generations of her family are settled, and briefly enrolled in college. She also started performing at open-mic nights and put together a band. After a gig in 2013, a noted producer, Roger Moutenot, invited her to work in his studio. “I was like, O.K., and the next week I dropped out of college,” she recalled. “That’s how I operate.” In 2014, she released a bluesy single: “Stuck in the South,” a song weighted with personal and regional history. “Don’t know nothin’ bout Southern belles/But I can tell you somethin’ about Southern hell,” she sang. It was a striking statement that she wrote after Trayvon Martin, the unarmed Florida teenager shot in 2012, was killed. “The days following that, I was so sick with grief and rage, and his death changed something for me,” she said. “It made me realize that I wasn’t safe. That kids that come from ‘good wholesome middle-class backgrounds’ aren’t safe. Like you are still a threat, and you’re still in danger and the South will eat you. That’s terrifying, to be young and to grow up in a black body in the South and have to reckon with that.” But the song is first-person, not finger-pointing or preachy. “I’m just witnessing,” she said. “I’m a voice in the void. I don’t want to proselytize to people. That’s not what I’m here for. Because that’s not what the blues did to me. The blues wasn’t, like, ‘Lift yourself up, young Negro.’ The blues meets you where you’re at.” She added: “I don’t believe that there’s any apolitical music. When people say things like, your music is political — all music, all art is political. You’re taking a stance, you’re making an observation about the way the world works or you think it should work. You’re doing that to sway public opinion.” Victoria completed her debut album gradually; it took three years. The record revealed a voice that could be girlish or grizzled, teasing or wrathful. “When I sing, I don’t know what that voice is,” she said. “My sister says I sound like an old lady singing in an attic. I studied videos of Victoria Spivey performing on YouTube and I love the way that she sings with her eyes. But I think that the voice is just this young woman inside of me that’s just this creepy little woman with huge eyes who’s watching the world. And it’s her chance to speak through me.” Atlantic Records released “Beyond the Bloodhounds” in 2016 and Victoria toured internationally, to the point of exhaustion. “I came home and I had no inner life left,” she said. “I had given it all away. I bottomed out in Nashville. I think that it was probably one of the darkest times of my life.” But she had an idea about a sound she wanted. When she talked with Dessner in 2017 about producing her second album, she said, “‘I wonder what it would sound like if Billie Holiday got lost in a Radiohead song?’ And he was, just, ‘We’re going to find out.’” She said she’s inspired by how Radiohead uses sonic techniques to tell a story. The goal was to blend those elements into the blues. “Nothing was out of bounds.” The songs on “Silences” stay mercurial, alluding to old styles only to have them melt down and mutate into something stranger. “There was a heavy focus in Adia’s mind on improvisation and allowing space for weird experiments and futuristic alchemy to happen,” Dessner said. “She tends to have a real subversive approach. She’s not really seeking for something to be perfect or beautiful. She’s focused on an aesthetic goal that’s more transgressive and forward-thinking. I was encouraged to pursue ugly tones and more jagged things at times.” In the studio, Victoria put up pictures of women who had inspired her: Holiday, Nina Simone, Fiona Apple, the Ethiopian pianist Emahoy Tsegué-Maryam Guèbrou. She also kept with her a book by the Surrealist poet Joyce Mansour. “She’ll start a line in a certain way, and by the end of the line she’s taking you in a completely different, unexpected direction,” she said. “I wanted to bring that into my music. I never want you to know how I’m going to finish a phrase. I always want to remain aloof, dangerous, unsettling, disorienting.” She smiled. “In a groovy way.” "
5cadf74049f0eacbf1f82559,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/10/arts/music/tayla-parx-ariana-grande-thank-u-next.html,"For 15 weeks since the fall, the top spot on the Billboard singles chart has been occupied by one of two Ariana Grande mega-smashes — “Thank U, Next” and “7 Rings” — that drip with the mettle and coquettish swagger of a pop diva, while borrowing from hip-hop beats and cadences. That winsome formula, though particularly compelling from Grande, can be traced back through recent pop history on a global scale: There are elements of the sound in a K-pop track by the girl group Red Velvet from 2015; a JoJo kiss-off from 2016; a Fifth Harmony single from 2017; and a Grammy-nominated Christina Aguilera number from last year. Even “High Hopes,” the sugary comeback hit from the pop-punk survivors Panic! at the Disco, which peaked at No. 4 in January, shares some of that DNA in its ecstatic vocal runs and melodic precision. The common link comes via the songwriter Taylor Parks, an ebullient 25-year-old former child actress with a brightly dyed bob and an air of benevolent mischief, who was credited on each. Known in the industry as a top-liner, Parks, who performs as Tayla Parx, contributes melodic and lyrical ideas to some of the biggest artists in the world, and those aspiring to be. For the last few years, she has done so quietly, cutting a meticulous yet low-key warpath through popular music on a personal quest to land a No. 1 single on every genre chart — a lofty goal that’s no longer far-fetched. “I only have a few more to go,” Parx said recently, while putting the finishing touches on her own debut album. “I need a country, I need a gospel, and I need a hip-hop.” She tackled Latin pop back in 2016, before its crossover explosion, and Nashville was already in her sights, she teased, after recent interest from Kacey Musgraves and Keith Urban. They are not the only ones to take notice. Parx was credited as a co-writer on half of Grande’s blockbuster “Thank U, Next” album, which rebooted the pop singer’s sound and public narrative. For Parx, the release worked as a springboard from workaday writer to A-list studio presence and, ideally, viable solo artist — an elusive final hurdle for many young female songwriters, from Ester Dean and Jessie J to Julia Michaels and Starrah. “Most songwriters fail to become an artist the same size they were a songwriter,” acknowledged Richie Kipp, one of Parx’s managers. “But I’ve never seen anyone wired like Tayla.” A Texas-born protégée of the actress and choreographer Debbie Allen, Parx moved with her family — a mother who worked in software and a father in mortgage underwriting — to Los Angeles to pursue show business. She played Little Inez Stubbs in the 2007 film adaptation of “Hairspray” before landing a few small television parts, including on Nickelodeon shows where she first crossed paths with Grande. Though they kept in touch intermittently on AOL Instant Messenger — and Parx helped write the title track for Grande’s second album, “My Everything,” in 2014 — the women did not really reconnect in person until the making of “Thank U, Next” late last year. In the meantime, Parx had clocked studio time with Babyface, contributed to a Mariah Carey divorce anthem while still a teenager and become a voice actor on “The Sims” and “The Walking Dead” video games. (Parx’s song “Me vs. Us” has a Simlish version, sung entirely in the fictional language.) Now, with Grande in her corner and on her résumé, Parx is trying to balance studio sessions for hit-seeking artists like Sam Smith, Haim and Dua Lipa with signing artists and producers of her own, going on acting auditions, working on a screenplay for an animated film, conceiving a clothing brand and promoting her Atlantic Records release, “We Need to Talk.” The new album, like Parx’s best hits, is playful and conversational, blending pop, R&B and traces of rap with plenty of Grande-esque high notes. “It’s been nuts,” Parx said. “I really had to jump through all the hoops of fire. First of all, being black, and then being a woman, and then being a young black woman. But we got through all of them.” (A recent study by the University of Southern California Annenberg Inclusion Initiative found that of the 633 songs to chart from 2012 through 2018, just 12.3 percent included female songwriters.) In addition to her contagious pluck and facility across genres, Parx credited her listening skills and discretion as crucial to endearing her to major artists. “There are a lot of things in my vault from the biggest stars in the world,” she said. “I would never betray them or take advantage of that trust.” Her acting background helps, too. “When I write these songs after having conversations with artists,” she said, “I’m embodying that and becoming them in that moment.” Aguilera compared Parx to a little sister, one who introduced her to “Black Mirror” and Instagram stories, while also gamely battling Aguilera’s children with Nerf guns. “She just has this natural personable quality that makes you feel at ease,” Aguilera said. “You want to be in a room with her.” As a former child performer herself, Aguilera said she was thrilled with the recognition now heading Parx’s way after her work with Grande. “I can hear Tayla in those songs, for sure,” Aguilera said, praising Parx’s ability to collaborate with “another young artist and really take them to that next place in their career, where you’re like: ‘Oh, wait, who is this again? Ariana Grande!?’” Parx was brought into the “Thank U, Next” sessions in October by her longtime friends and collaborators Victoria Monét, another top-liner, and the producer Tommy Brown, or TB Hits, who had both worked on Grande’s four previous albums. Grande had just released a full-length, “Sweetener,” that August, but with the death of her ex-boyfriend, the rapper Mac Miller, and the flame out of her high-profile romance with Pete Davidson of “Saturday Night Live,” she had plenty more material to work through. “We were kind of there through the breakup and the makeup and the breakup again,” Parx said, “which is why records like ‘NASA’ and ‘Make Up’ came.” The group wrote about nine songs in a week, six of which ended up making the “Thank U, Next” album. But none were as crucial as the title track, which existed in multiple versions, including the internet-melting one where Grande addressed her exes by name. “They all felt like the one until we got to ‘Thank U, Next,’ and then we were like, ‘This is the one one!’” Parx said. Brown recalled Parx as an advocate for specificity. “She was a big supporter of using the names,” he said, citing her tendency to speak her mind. “All big stars need people who are honest with them,” Brown added. “Too many times these people are lied to or just agreed with. Tayla’s not going to that.” Parx noted that she, Monét and Grande were not only collaborators but also peers and friends. “For me to connect to a young female is a completely different perspective than when you have a Max Martin talking to a young female,” she said, referring to the longtime pop hitmaker. As for the criticism that Grande received about appropriating black music and style, Parx brushed it off, noting that many critics failed to recognize the pop star’s black collaborators. “She’s actually supporting the black producers and writers that she works with more than some of the black artists that I’ve worked with,” Parx said. “I think the free exchange is important for the evolution of music,” she added. “If we didn’t take from each other, genre-wise, everything would sound the same. As long as the proper credit is given, that’s the most important thing.” Parx’s technical skills, like a knack for arranging and producing vocals, also help set her apart. “I might find a breath or a word that I like — it’s like surgery,” she said of the process, which can include coaching singers toward certain emotional registers and chopping up different takes into fine-tuned final versions. As she spoke, Parx was using one ear to track the progress of her own vocals on a song that needed to be finished for her album. In the editing process, a line that should have been “teach me” had morphed into “tease me.” “It sounds like I have a lisp,” she told her audio engineer, barely missing a beat in conversation. Seeming genuinely sated by all of the success coming her way, Parx was typically buoyant about the possibility that “We Need to Talk” may not be her own commercial breakthrough, but merely another baby step in an atypical career. “That would be very ungrateful of me to look at the records that I’ve broken, the career that I’ve had from 9 until now, and measure my success against someone else’s,” she said, flashing her disarmingly confident grin. “There’s a lot of things that the biggest artists in the world haven’t done that I’ve done.” "
5c2fdae23a125f5075c02e98,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/obituaries/dean-ford-dead.html,"Dean Ford, vocalist for the Scottish band the Marmalade, whose voice was heard around the world on the group’s biggest hit, “Reflections of My Life,” died on Monday in Los Angeles. He was 72. His daughter, Tracey McAleese Gorman, said the cause was complications of Parkinson’s disease. Mr. Ford had a heady decade in the 1960s and early ’70s as the Marmalade (which eventually dropped its “the”) had hits in Britain and elsewhere in Europe, then grew even bigger with “Reflections,” a somber ballad in which the singer examines the world around him with dismay but also a glimmer of something positive. “The world is a bad place, a bad place, a terrible place to live,” sang Mr. Ford, who wrote “Reflections” with his bandmate Junior Campbell. “Oh, but I don’t want to die.” The song reached Billboard’s Top 10 in May 1970 after achieving even greater success in Britain. Fame, though, proved hard to handle for Mr. Ford, who left the group in the mid-1970s and struggled with alcoholism. In 1986 he sought help from Alcoholics Anonymous. One of his subsequent jobs was driving a limousine in Los Angeles, and his passengers included celebrities like Jane Wyman, Michael Jackson and Bob Dylan. But, he told The Scottish Mail in 2015, he never told passengers that he was once a celebrity too. “You’re not supposed to do that when you’re driving,” he said. “They don’t want to hear it. If it gets back to the guy who owns the company, you’re gone.” Mr. Ford, though, never lost his desire to perform. A subdued version of “Reflections of My Life” recorded in 2014 has been viewed more than two million times on YouTube. Last year Mr. Ford released “This Scottish Heart,” a 30-track, two-disc album. “Music was his life, music inspired him, music was everything to him,” his daughter said in a telephone interview. “He wasn’t just a lead singer; he loved playing the guitar, and he played it to my son, and at family gatherings, barbecues. He wouldn’t go anywhere without it.” Dean Ford was his stage name. He was born Thomas McAleese on Sept. 5, 1946, in Airdrie, Scotland, to Thomas and Elizabeth McAleese (although sources say he was born in 1945). He grew up in neighboring Coatbridge and left school at 16 to join a band called the Cravats. In 1963 he was recruited to front another band, the Gaylords, but decided his name needed sprucing up. “I thought about Dean Martin and Tennessee Ernie Ford,” he told The Mail, “and put them together.” The group became Dean Ford and the Gaylords. Known for close harmonies, the band, renamed the Marmalade at the suggestion of its record company, had modest success in 1967 with “I See the Rain,” then hit it big the next year with a cover of the Beatles’ “Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da” that went to the top of the British charts. The group toured with the Who and other leading acts of the day, immersed in the wild side of rock ’n’ roll. Mr. Ford said he avoided drugs for the most part but was derailed by alcohol. He had married Janeanne McBaine in 1968, but the marriage broke up. In addition to his daughter, he is survived by a sister, Liz Carson. After leaving Marmalade, Mr. Ford also left Britain for the United States. “I wanted to start over,” he said in a 1998 interview. “I wanted a new life. The trouble was, I brought myself with me.” At one of his favorite watering holes, another regular was a woman who often arrived at the bar beaten and bloody. One day she stopped coming, and he assumed the worst. “But then she turned up, and the change in her was stunning,” he said. She told her old drinking partners that she had gone to A.A. for help. “I think God sends us a message when we’re ready to hear it,” Mr. Ford said. “I was ready to hear it then.” "
5c2d52db3a125f5075c029ae,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/02/obituaries/daryl-dragon-dead.html,"Daryl Dragon, the “Captain” half of the pop duo the Captain and Tennille, whose string of soft-rock hits in the 1970s included “Love Will Keep Us Together” and “Muskrat Love,” died on Wednesday in Prescott, Ariz. He was 76. His former wife and singing partner, Toni Tennille, announced his death through a publicist, who said the cause was renal failure. The Captain and Tennille, whose specialty was romantic ballads featuring Ms. Tennille’s silky voice, reached the Top 10 seven times from 1975 to 1979. “He was a brilliant musician with many friends who loved him greatly,” Ms. Tennille said in a statement. “I was at my most creative in my life when I was with him.” Mr. Dragon’s stage name came from his days as a backup musician with the Beach Boys in the 1960s and early ’70s, when he often wore a captain’s hat onstage. Mike Love, one of the group’s leaders, would introduce him to audiences as the “captain of the keyboards.” He had been performing with the Beach Boys for several years before the hat made its fateful appearance. “I just picked it up one night on the spur of the moment,” he told The Boston Globe in 1976, “and that night they spotlighted me in ‘Help Me Rhonda.’ It made a big hit, and I’ve been wearing it ever since.” Daryl Dragon was born on Aug. 27, 1942, in Los Angeles. His father, Carmen, was a composer and conductor, and his mother, Eloise (Rawitzer) Dragon, was a soprano who sang on radio programs. Mr. Dragon was trained in classical piano but didn’t take to it. “I seemed to be at war with myself in my musical tastes,” he told The Globe. “I could appreciate the great compositions, but I also liked the boogie beat.” He played in several bands in the 1960s before signing on with the Beach Boys. He met Ms. Tennille in 1971, when he was brought in to play keyboards for the San Francisco run of an ecology-themed musical, “Mother Earth,” which she had co-written and in which she was performing with South Coast Repertory, a theater company from Orange County, Calif. He in turn brought her onto a Beach Boys tour as a backup singer and pianist. The two began performing together in nightclubs, and after self-financing a demo, they landed a record contract. Their cover of “Love Will Keep Us Together,” a song that Neil Sedaka and Howard Greenfield wrote and that Mr. Sedaka recorded in 1973, became a worldwide hit in 1975, reaching No. 1 on the Billboard singles chart and winning the Grammy Award for record of the year. The Captain and Tennille kept turning out hits for the rest of the 1970s. They also landed a television variety show on ABC as the network tried to duplicate the success that Sonny and Cher had enjoyed with their own show earlier in the decade. But the series, which had its premiere in September 1976, lasted only one season. Mr. Dragon found the whole experience distasteful. “Television is a great garbage disposal,” he said at the time. “It keeps grinding up artists like us and throwing them away.” Mr. Dragon produced all 10 of the duo’s 10 albums. They continued to perform after their hit-making run ended in 1979 — “Do That to Me One More Time” was their last gold record — and Mr. Dragon produced other artists. Ms. Tennille, meanwhile, increasingly pursued solo projects. The couple divorced in 2014. In 2016, Ms. Tennille published a memoir in which she wrote that their marriage had not been the idyllic partnership it had been made to seem. Their record company, she wrote, falsely announced that they had married on Valentine’s Day 1975; to satisfy expectations, they married for real not long after. “I can say without exaggeration that he showed no physical affection for me during our very long marriage,” she wrote. Mr. Dragon is survived by a brother, Doug. "

Just want the music? Listen to the Playlist on Spotify here (or find our profile: nytimes). Like what you hear? Let us know at theplaylist@nytimes.com and sign up for our Louder newsletter, a once-a-week blast of our pop music coverage. After a six-year gap, Vampire Weekend has re-emerged with a song that wraps misgivings in three-chord elation: first with folksy acoustic-guitar picking, then with gospel-rock piano and congas, later with jammy hints of the Grateful Dead. It all feels jovial until Ezra Koenig’s words register a not-so-oblique dread: “Anybody with a worried mind could never forgive the sight/Of wicked snakes inside a place you thought was dignified/I don’t wanna live like this, but I don’t wanna die.” Meanwhile, anyone seeking meditative sanctuary can click on “120 Minutes of Harmony Hall Guitar” — the opening acoustic guitars simply looping away, adding a modest drone for the second hour. JON PARELES The lyrics are cryptic, and so is the video, with images of armed men, surveillance screens, captive women and lessons in violence. But there’s no mistaking the urgency of Sam Fender’s desperate vocal, the rising refrain “He will play God” and the syncopated, reverberating guitar note that persists throughout the song, keeping things tense. PARELES Fresh from boygenius, her collaboration with Julien Baker and Lucy Dacus, Phoebe Bridgers has teamed up with Conor Oberst (Bright Eyes) as Better Oblivion Community Center, suddenly releasing a full album. It’s folk rock all the way, harking back to the Byrds, Bob Dylan and Ian and Sylvia, with shared lead vocals, intertwined acoustic and electric guitars and, often, a tambourine shaking along. Electric guitars surge and spill over in “Dylan Thomas,” as Bridgers and Oberst sing about power, entertainment and the elusiveness of truth. PARELES For this movie theme, Dua Lipa honors the plot of “Alita: Battle Angel,” a film based on a post-apocalyptic manga about a human brain resurrected as a cyborg warrior: “This is not a swan song,” she sings, “It’s a new life.” But she also ties it in to the female self-assertion of the rest of her catalog: “I won’t stay quiet,” she sings, her voice swelling, “ ’Cause staying silent’s the same as dying.” Backup chants sound like remnants of past civilizations; the beat is mechanized, cybernetic. The song puts human aspiration in electronic armor. PARELES Yes, that Snow. “Con Calma” underscores the endless cycles of borrowing that nourish pop music, messy and unlikely as they may be. In 1992, “Informer,” by the white, Canadian dancehall performer Snow, spent seven weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100. This was an outlier for many reasons, some less obvious than others — Snow had cut his musical teeth in Toronto’s Jamaican community. Over the years, “Informer” has remained, despite occasional mockery, the rare durable, credible example of a song by a white reggae performer. Now, in 2019, reggaeton titan Daddy Yankee, well into the neutralized-pop portion of his career, has built atop it a new song, which is enthusiastic and lighthearted, squeezing something just a little bit too tepid out of something which, in its day, had been the little-bit-too-tepid thing. JON CARAMANICA Agonized and serrated, the new song from Call Me Karizma revives mid-to-late-2000s Warped Tour electro-punk, blends it with emo instincts as refracted through SoundCloud rap, adds in heaping gobs of Marilyn Manson, and tops it off with, hiding in plain sight, a flicker of Yung Joc’s “It’s Goin’ Down.” CARAMANICA “Ecstasy” is an anti-manifesto from Sneaks, the singer, songwriter and producer Eva Moolchan. “I don’t wanna explain,” she whisper-sings, almost as if she’s humming to herself. But meanwhile she’s assembling blips, plinks, a buzzing bass riff, hovering electronic tones and casually intersecting vocal lines into a teasingly enticing track: she’s doing, not telling. PARELES Florence and the Machine almost — but not entirely — separate two threads of her music with a yin-yang pair of new songs. “Moderation” goes for a hand-clapping, room-shaking Motown-flavored rock-soul stomp — think Martha and the Vandellas — as Florence Welch scoffs at the whole notion of moderation in love. “Haunted House” turns inward instead. It starts and ends something like a parlor song, a piano waltz sung by Welch at her most decorous. But when the chorus arrives and she confesses “I’m not free yet,” she doesn’t hold back the buildup; moderation is, indeed, a struggle. PARELES As a collaborator and on her own, Julia Michaels has typecast herself as the queen of neurosis, and she’s true to that brand throughout her latest EP, “Inner Monologue Part 1.” In “Happy,” she sings, “Sometimes I think I kill relationships for art,” and adds, “I pay my bills with it.” A reggae-ish beat heaves and slams below her and a backup chorus joins her in her misery, but at the end, as she quietly moans “I just want to be happy,” there are crickets in the mix. PARELES A tsk-tsk masquerading as a chest puff, J. Cole’s “Middle Child” is the beginning of what he’s suggested is a coming onslaught of new music this year. The themes, however, are familiar: Cole’s love-em-but-needle-em relationship with younger rappers is present in full force. But unlike most elders, he’s also willing to paint himself as a student — hence, middle child. Which is why even though this song echoes mid-2010s Drake triumphalism (and also mentions Drake, for good measure), Cole cuts the arrogance with commitment to granular, almost mundane narrative. All tell, no show. CARAMANICA The saxophonist, flutist and bass clarinetist Eric Dolphy led just five studio sessions in his brief lifetime, yet he’s seen as one of jazz history’s great possibility-expanders — an improviser who squirreled away his masterful abilities under layers of evocative idiosyncrasy, packing his notes with more breath than they could fit, letting them bloom and quiver well beyond their natural pitch. Dolphy’s second-to-last recording session took place in New York in July 1963, with a midsize band, across two days, less than a year before his death at 36. It resulted in a pair of well-reputed albums, “Conversations” and “Iron Man,” but many assumed the complete session recordings were lost. The flutist James Newton — who had held onto a trove of tapes and papers that Dolphy left behind — recently turned them over to Resonance Records, which released 18 of the finest tracks from those 1963 dates on “Musical Prophet: The Expanded 1963 New York Studio Sessions.” Half were previously unissued, including this alternate take of “Jitterbug Waltz,” a Fats Waller classic with a frisky, twirling melody that’s oddly befitting of Dolphy. And mark the trumpeter: It’s the future jazz eminence Woody Shaw, age 18, sounding phenomenal in one of his first professional recording dates. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO Last year’s most awe-inspiring jazz release was “Emanon,” Wayne Shorter’s three-disc masterstroke, much of which he recorded live with his quartet joined by the London Chamber Orchestra. But unless you shelled out for the full boxed set, you probably haven’t heard it yet. Now the digital wait is over — on Friday, Blue Note released the album on streaming platforms. On “Prometheus Unbound,” we hear how skillfully Shorter marshals a string section; he uses the orchestra not only to add strength and harmonic layers, but also to give his wide, intervallic leaps a new dynamic momentum. RUSSONELLO Hearing “Trio Tapestry,” the first album from this all-star group, it’s hard not to think back on Joe Lovano’s work in the Paul Motian Trio, another bass-free combo whose history was entwined with ECM Records. Like Motian’s, the new trio’s music drifts slowly into the space around it, gently filling a room with worried air. But the biggest difference between the bands is in the tumbling, unsettled piano of Marilyn Crispell and the warmer, more diatonic guitar of Bill Frisell (the third member of Motian’s trio). On “Rare Beauty,” Lovano’s trio treats his sharp modal melody with a sense of unfettered freedom, moving loosely in and out of step with each other. RUSSONELLO Que Vola brings together three Afro-Cuban percussionists — all members of the Osain del Monte Orchestra — and seven French jazz musicians. The lead single from the group’s self-titled debut is “Calle Luz,” a quick, pattering original that reshapes a rumba rhythm around its jagged, four-horn arrangement. The West African roots of rumba come through in various ways here; amid all the rhythmic and harmonic complexity, you might even hear echoes of Fela Kuti’s Africa ’70 band in the sound of the Rhodes, bass and drums. RUSSONELLO Sage Fisher, who records as Dolphin Midwives, uses loops of harp and electronic sounds, and sometimes (though not on this track) her voice, to construct tracks that evolve from ambient Minimalism to something considerably more volatile. “Junglespell” starts out pretty and vaguely Asian, with rippling, overlapping harp motifs. But halfway through, an electronic vortex takes shape, in rhythm-disrupting clusters and miniature alarm bells; a pretty coda can’t soothe everything. PARELES "
5ca7b13649f0eacbf1f813e2,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/05/arts/music/mick-jagger-surgery.html,"Mick Jagger, the lead singer of the Rolling Stones, has successfully undergone medical treatment that had forced the band to postpone the final leg of its current tour, a spokeswoman said on Friday. “He is doing very well and is expected to make a full recovery,” the spokeswoman, Fran Curtis, said in a statement. Jagger, 75, confirmed the news in a tweet, thanking fans and hospital employees. While Curtis declined to comment further, NBC News reported that Jagger had received “transcatheter aortic valve replacement” in New York. The band had announced last Saturday that the 17 remaining shows of its “No Filter” tour would be postponed on advice from Jagger’s doctors. Fans were told to hold on to their tickets, which would be valid for the rescheduled dates. “I really hate letting you down like this,” Jagger said on Twitter that day. The Rolling Stones, which formed in 1962, had already completed the first two legs of the tour in Europe in 2017 and 2018. The final leg, originally scheduled to kick off on April 20, would have taken the band to cities in the United States and Canada. The band was first introduced to the American public 55 years ago on the variety show “The Red Skelton Hour.” "

Let us know at theplaylist@nytimes.com and sign up for our Louder newsletter, a once-a-week blast of our pop music coverage. Tame Impala — Kevin Parker playing everything he can in the studio — aligns multiple eras, but mostly the 1970s, in “Patience,” his first single since 2015. “Has it really been that long?” he sings. Pounding major-seventh piano chords like Todd Rundgren, using conga drums to punch up and punctuate synthesizer arpeggios, and hinting at Michael Jackson in his melodies, he comes to the realization that he’s “growing up in stages/living life in phases.” It’s an honest part of a long-term evolution. JON PARELES Lizzo continues to stake out turf as one of this year’s most versatile pop breakouts — a sturdy singer, a limber rapper and always rich with lighthearted thirst. On “Tempo,” she goes bump for bump with Missy Elliott on an electro-hip-hop thumper teeming with arched-eyebrow come-ons. It’s pure, infectious joy. JON CARAMANICA Cowbells clink, the wah-wah guitar cackles, synthesizer lines wriggle and horns punch terse little riffs in the latest single from Ibibio Sound Machine, a London band whose lead singer, Eno Williams, is from Nigeria; the band releases its album “Doko Mien” on Friday. “Wanna Come Down” is a snappy funk track that owes more to Prince than to Nigeria’s own Afrobeat or juju. Williams splits her lyrics between English and the African language Ibibio but the video clip, alas, offers no subtitles. PARELES It makes some sense that the Last Poets — who, in the late 1960s, did more to augur the rise of hip-hop than any band of their generation — would find relevance today by looking back. This group was always guided by ancient practices, and the last few years have demonstrated that America’s troubled racial history remains close at hand. On “For the Millions,” from an album due in May, the bassist Jamaaladeen Tacuma offers a buoyant accompaniment that recalls the poets’ 1972 record, “Chastisment.” And Abiodun Oyewole reaches further back, rapping a remembrance of black lives lost over the years, and a call to continue the fight. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO Justin Vernon of Bon Iver has been citing Bruce Hornsby as an influence since the beginning of his career, and over the last few years, the two performers have been inching toward each other. This jagged but soothing collaboration was recorded at Vernon’s Eau Claire studio. Vernon’s singing is characteristically pastel, while Hornsby’s has a heavy, urgent grounding. Their hymnal give and take owes something to folk and roots music, and something to jazz, and it’s surprising, given how different their vocal approaches are, just how much their words appear to be hugging each other, balms in an emotional storm. CARAMANICA Nature abhors a vacuum, so with Ed Sheeran largely missing in action, the Australian singer Dean Lewis has stepped into the void. Last year, Lewis’s single “Be Alright” was a savvy slice of mournful folk-pop. He’s just released his debut album, “A Place We Knew,” which includes “Stay Awake,” an impressively dynamic number about the hope of love that nods to both Sheeran’s crisp melodies and his irrepressible urge toward rhythm. CARAMANICA A breezy cross-generational Mexican-American love song featuring two of the most prominent and long-running Chicano rappers — MC Magic, from Phoenix, and Lil Rob, from San Diego — and Cuco, the rising indie soul-pop singer from South Los Angeles. “Search” moves slowly and with warmth, in the manner of the slow-jam oldies played for decades on Los Angeles radio by Art Laboe, whom MC Magic name-checks here. Like those molasses-thick grooves, this song is almost guilelessly sweet: In the video, the two young protagonists don’t even so much as kiss. CARAMANICA The Doobie Brothers of nü-trap play tug-of-war with unexpected sweetness over light piano and lighter drums. Nav, as ever, is a font of melancholy and mistrust, and Young Thug … well, Young Thug remains a master of free-associative madness, concluding with a flirtatious riff that begins, “You look just like my rich auntie” and goes on to express sentiments that, for most, would be verboten, but which in his signature wail sound like vivid confession. CARAMANICA Burrow into “Hungry Ghost,” the new album by the guitar-bass-drums trio Typical Sisters, and you might start to notice what isn’t there. This is improvisation-driven music, right at the corner of jazz and post-rock, but there are none of the showy, full-band misdirections that have become so typical of jazz today. And while the album’s title refers to Chinese Buddhism, these aren’t slow, numinous, incantatory sounds, either. Instead, what you get is happily in the middle and something increasingly rare today: group exploration with little flexing or hurry, electric guitar melodies that sound like open promises — a reminder that it’s O.K. to listen with no expectation of a payoff.

5c65ebe03a125f5075c09cc6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/arts/music/fbi-ryan-adams.html,"The F.B.I. is looking into whether the singer-songwriter Ryan Adams, 44, committed a crime by engaging in sexually explicit communications with an underage fan, according to a law enforcement official with knowledge of the matter. As reported by The New York Times on Wednesday, Adams and a young woman, who said her online communications with the singer began when she was 14 and continued until she was 16, exchanged text messages and conducted video calls that sometimes included nudity. The two never met in person. Adams, through his lawyer, Andrew B. Brettler, has denied that he “ever engaged in inappropriate online sexual communications with someone he knew was underage.” On Thursday, Brettler said that he had not been contacted by law enforcement. He declined to comment further. [Read our report: Ryan Adams dangled success. Women say they paid a price.] In response to The Times’s article, F.B.I. agents in the bureau’s New York office on Thursday took the first steps to open a criminal investigation, according to the official, who declined to be identified because the person was not authorized to discuss it publicly. The agents, from the Crimes Against Children Squad, will seek to interview the woman, the official said, and try to obtain the text messages and any other evidence she may have in her possession. If they find her account credible, they will take other investigative steps, which could include subpoenaing both her cellphone records and those of Adams from their service providers, the official said. Federal law bars the sexual exploitation of children under 18, defining a violator as anyone who “persuades, induces, entices or coerces any minor to engage in” a visual depiction of sexually explicit conduct. Several legal experts said that decisions on whether to prosecute such cases could hinge on whether the adult reasonably believed the minor was of legal age, taking into account context from their conversations. While the inquiry was in its earliest stages, the official said that generally in such cases, agents seek to interview a victim’s friends and family members to determine whether they made contemporaneous statements about the contact. [Ryan Adams’s album release has been canceled amid an F.B.I. inquiry.] A lawyer for the woman, now 20, declined to comment as her family deliberated how to proceed. The Times identified the woman by her middle name, Ava, because she was a minor during these interactions. An F.B.I. spokeswoman, Amy J. Thoreson, declined to comment Thursday when asked about the matter. The Times reviewed extensive communication between Adams and Ava, including direct messages on Twitter that began when she was 14, and more than 3,000 text messages spanning a nine-month period when Ava was 15 and 16. The text messages from late 2014, when Ava was 16, included explicit photographs of her. She said the pair also conducted video calls on Skype, where Adams exposed himself during phone sex. The Times has reviewed screenshots of these interactions. Throughout their communication, Adams asked Ava, a successful bass player since she was 12, repeatedly about her age. “Do me a paranoid favor,” he wrote in November 2014, when he was 40 and she was 16. “Show me you are 18.” He invoked others accused of targeting girls, including R. Kelly. Sometimes, in response to Adams’s prodding, Ava said she was older than she was. More than once Adams asked to see her identification, although she never provided any in the messages reviewed by The Times, and their sexual conversations continued. Brettler said that Adams did not recall these conversations and added that while the singer has corresponded with fans and aspiring musicians online, Adams “does not recall having online communications with anyone related to anything outside of music.” Brettler also provided photos of Ava, in which he said her appearance suggested “that she was in her 20s.” After the publication of the article, Adams posted on Twitter on Wednesday to apologize to “anyone I have ever hurt, however unintentionally,” though he continued to dispute the accuracy of The Times’s reporting. “I would never have inappropriate interactions with someone I thought was underage,” he wrote. “Period.” Ava and other women interviewed by The Times said that Adams often dangled potential career opportunities as he pursued female artists in sexual scenarios. “Music was a point of control for him,” said Adams’s ex-wife, the singer and actress Mandy Moore. Adams, a Grammy-nominated rock singer famous for his contributions to the genre known as alternative country, has released 16 studio albums and announced plans to release three more this year via Blue Note and his own Pax-Am Records. Capitol Music Group, which oversees those labels, declined to comment. The allegations that Adams manipulated and harassed women in the music industry sent ripples through the business. “We’re all fed up,” the singer Vanessa Carlton wrote on Twitter. Bethany Cosentino, the singer of Best Coast, said that the same story “could literally be written about so many dudes in music.” And Tamara Lindeman of the Canadian band the Weather Station added: “Having to perpetually question if a potential collaborator is interested in you musically or personally is an enormous and unspoken barrier for women in music.” Jason Isbell, a country singer who is scheduled to appear on one of Adams’s upcoming albums, wrote on Twitter that he had been unaware of Adams’s alleged behavior. Asked if he believed the women’s accounts, Isbell responded: “Yep.” "

Whichever way it went, the timeline was something approaching finite. Nothing dies anymore, though. Boy bands go away, and then they stage comebacks, sometimes after not all that much time. In the last few months alone, the Backstreet Boys have released a new album, the Jonas Brothers put out a new single, New Kids on the Block released a new single and video (about boy bands, as it happens), B2K went out on reunion tour and ’N Sync was sampled on the most recent Ariana Grande album. Add to that the continued relevance of boy bands in the K-pop ecosystem, and also the emergence of a new wave of young American groups, and the boy band is as resilient as ever.

5c54f7403a125f5075c07a93,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/01/arts/television/russian-doll-netflix-harry-nilsson-gotta-get-up.html,"Spoilers ahead for the first season of “Russian Doll.”  In the new Netflix series “Russian Doll,” Nadia (Natasha Lyonne), a cynical video game programmer with commitment issues, finds herself caught in a never-ending cycle of death and resurrection on the night of her 36th birthday party. No matter what Nadia does, she eventually dies and awakens in the same bathroom on that same night at that same party. And with almost every reset, the staccato piano chords of a nearly 50-year-old pop tune kick in. [Read our critic’s review of “Russian Doll.”] That song is “Gotta Get Up,” the opening track from the late singer-songwriter Harry Nilsson’s 1971 album “Nilsson Schmilsson,” and its bright, infectious instrumentation belies melancholy, wistful lyrics about growing older. “We used to carry on and drink and do the rock ’n’ roll,” he sings. “We never thought we’d get older/We never thought it’d grow cold.” Lyonne, who created “Russian Doll” with Amy Poehler and Leslye Headland, was struck by the “buoyant doomsday quality” of Nilsson’s famously troubled life, as chronicled in the 2010 documentary “Who Is Harry Nilsson (And Why Is Everybody Talkin’ About Him)?” (An alcoholic, Nilsson filed for bankruptcy toward the end of his life and died at 52, of heart failure, in 1994.) “There was always a kind of ending that was unpleasant,” Lyonne said this week, “that was percolating under the surface of his songs, even at their most upbeat and certainly at their darkest.” Lyonne also wanted to “touch something that was out of time, and a New York and East Village that was out of time” while simultaneously evoking the present; at one point they questioned whether the characters should even have cellphones, she said. The Brooklyn-born Nilsson — whose legacy didn’t endure to the extent one might have expected in his ’70s heyday, which was distinguished by songs like “Everybody’s Talkin’” and the respect of celebrated peers like John Lennon — was the “perfect marriage of all those ideas.” Early on, there were other contenders for Nadia’s reset song, including Lou Reed’s “Crazy Feeling,” the Stooges’s “No Fun” and Lil’ Kim’s “Not Tonight.” But though they may have fit the tone, the creative team kept coming back to “Gotta Get Up” — as Lyonne put it, the other artists “didn’t pack the guttural punch” of Nilsson. Obtaining the rights to the song was another matter. The plan to reuse it many times, à la “I Got You Babe” in “Groundhog Day,” the show’s most obvious antecedent, ate into most of the music budget. Nilsson’s estate also limited the production to a certain amount of uses. As editing progressed, uncertainty about the song’s availability hung over the show like a “daily albatross,” Lyonne said, and the creators pondered which songs they might be willing to give up in order to afford “Gotta Get Up.” Because “Gotta Get Up” had become the song — if there was a Plan B, neither Lyonne or Headland, who discussed the topic in a separate interview, recall what it was. Fortunately, approval finally arrived late in the editing process. In an email, Brienne Rose, the show’s music supervisor, did not specify the terms of the licensing deal, citing confidentiality. But she did note that the team was able “to find a balance between the maximum number of uses, and what the budget would allow.” The constraints contributed to the varying ways in which “Gotta Get Up” is employed for Nadia’s resets — in the second episode, she dies several times within a four-minute montage, while the song continues to loop underneath, uninterrupted. In the pivotal fifth episode, in which Nadia begins to question her own goodness and morality, the song doesn’t appear at all. “We were able to kind of straddle that line and put you in a particular head space as you were watching the rest of the loop,” Headland said. “It’s the kind of thing you probably don’t notice, but your brain did.” (For the record, the theme song for Alan, the show’s other oft reanimated character, played by Charlie Barnett, was Beethoven’s “Piano Concerto No. 4 In G Major.” For both Headland and Lyonne, the composer is inextricably linked with Stanley Kubrick’s “A Clockwork Orange” — Headland views Beethoven primarily through the lenses of “pent-up energy” and “violence,” she said, themes that are found throughout “Russian Doll.”) The reset song technique does “more heavy lifting than just marking where you are in time,” Headland said, noting a scene from Episode 4 where, in a departure from the other sequences, “Gotta Get Up” intrudes on Alan’s reset. “Russian Doll” is about being haunted, she added. “So that music — what happened with Nilsson in his own personal life, and all those things — it’s just so obvious to me that he’s one of the many ghosts that are in that story.” "

Eilish, 17, has spent the last few years establishing herself as the negation of what a female teen-pop star used to be. She doesn’t play innocent, or ingratiating, or flirtatious, or perky, or cute. Instead, she’s sullen, depressive, death-haunted, sly, analytical and confrontational, all without raising her voice. [Billie Eilish is not your typical 17-year-old pop star. Get used to her.] On singles and EPs, like her 2017 EP “Don’t Smile at Me,” Eilish’s songs have treated love as a power struggle, an absurd game, and a destructive obsession, racking up more than a billion streams from listeners who apparently share her sentiments. On her Instagram page, which has more than 15 million followers, she is brusquely anti-fashion, swaddling herself in shapeless, oversized, boldly colored clothes and making silly or ghoulish faces. “I do what I want when I’m wanting to/My soul so cynical,” she notes in “Bad Guy.” But that’s just her starting point. While Eilish’s previous releases have featured her flinty, defensive side, her debut album also admits to sorrows and vulnerabilities. In some ways the album arrives as a continuation, not an introduction. Like her previous releases, it’s the work of a very small, decidedly innovative family team. Eilish writes and records her songs with her older brother, Finneas O’Connell, working largely at home. The sound they have built for her is sparse with instrumentation and large with implication. A typical track uses just a handful of parts, nearly all of them electronic: a bass line, a beat, only enough keyboard notes to sketch a harmony. Eilish sings barely above a whisper, a signal of intimacy. But at any moment, the tracks are likely to flaunt their artificiality: adding samples or sound effects, distorting her voice, suddenly deploying a big bass drop. “Wish You Were Gay” — a guy is ignoring her, and she wishes he was indifferent to her gender rather than her in particular — starts with just acoustic-guitar chords and her voice, tokens of pop sincerity. But the mix also includes a tittering audience and applause at the end, insisting that the song is archly theatrical. In Eilish’s digital-native universe, it’s impossible to pretend that anything is unobserved or unmediated; everything is self-conscious. While albums in the streaming era aren’t always made to be heard as a whole, “When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?” traces a clear arc: from bravado to melancholy. Early in the album are songs like “You Should See Me in a Crown” — an ominously assured, sustained and then slamming claim to power — and the mocking, music-hall flavored “All the Good Girls Go to Hell,” as well as “Xanny,” a ballad that disdains the trendy overuse of the anti-anxiety drug Xanax. But with a stretch of songs near the end of the album, Eilish turns to thoughts of grief, suicide and loneliness. “Bury a Friend,” with a pulsing, nervous undercurrent and sampled screams, veers between mourning, lashing out and self-destructive thoughts. “Ilomilo” has a briskly plinking, near-ska beat, but it worries over a suicidal friend: “I might break/If you’re gonna die not by mistake.” In “Listen Before I Go,” a glacial piano ballad with looming reverberations, the narrator herself is suicidal; “Sorry, can’t save me,” she warns, and sirens at the end suggest the worst. It’s followed by the whispery “I Love You,” a hovering, hesitant confession: “I don’t want to, but I love you.” Eilish began her career establishing what kind of pop star she doesn’t intend to be. With her debut album, she’s even tougher: tough enough to show some heart. "

Here are 10 more artists our pop music critics will be keeping an eye on in 2019. [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] When she’s gently strumming an acoustic guitar and singing about love in her reedy, tremulous mezzo-soprano, the 21-year-old Jade Bird might seem to fit a soothing, long-established singer-songwriter mold on “Love Has All Been Done Before.” But that’s only until she gets riled. Then her rock band kicks in, her voice gets rough and her words turn pointed and pitiless. And when full fury takes over, she starts spitting lines at rap speed. She’s no pushover. Her debut album is due April 19. JON PARELES This Los Angeles rapper has a quixotic, charismatic flow, spilling words past the end of lines with a pinched, tart voice that recalls the earliest Los Angeles gangster rap. On the recent mixtape “Famous Cryp,” he’s vibrant but protean, still figuring out the boundaries of his skill. But songs like “DM,” “Bleed It” and “Thotiana” are terse, bawdy and infectious. JON CARAMANICA Nicola Cruz is an electronic musician, producer and D.J. from Ecuador who has already made a reputation on the international club circuit. Instead of putting electronic sounds in the foreground, he builds tracks from loops and improvisations that are likely to come from ancient instruments, particularly Andean ones like wood flutes, percussion and small guitars — though he might also try a sitar. The artificial pieces he constructs sound oddly natural. His second album, “Siku” — named after an Andean panpipe — comes out Jan. 25. PARELES Billie Eilish’s debut album is likely to appear this year, and while she’s only 17, she is no unknown. Since her initial SoundCloud postings in 2015, her online releases have drawn hundreds of millions of Spotify streams and have made her a tour headliner. The songs she writes with her brother and producer, Finneas O’Connell, are usually hushed ballads that glance back at Lana Del Rey and Lorde. Her voice is whispery and sweetly tearful with a steely undercurrent, and it stakes out a particular persona: passionate and vulnerable but also vindictive and treacherous. Onstage, she gets thousands of voices singing along. PARELES In current country, Fleetwood Mac and the Eagles loom as large as Hank Williams and Loretta Lynn once did. Lauren Jenkins writes and sings about disappointment, disillusion, drinking and holding on despite it all with a Stevie Nicks rasp in her voice. Her debut album, “No Saint,” is set for March 15, and it surrounds her most bitter tidings with gleaming guitars and bright harmonies. PARELES LeeBrian, a young Puerto Rican rapper, is the first artist signed to the label of Sky, the producer responsible for hits by J Balvin (and others). LeeBrian is a nimble, flexible vocalist — sometimes agitated, sometimes preternaturally relaxed, and often toggling between both, like on the whimsical “Goku Sin El Ki.” CARAMANICA Lil Tjay is an exuberant, sweet-voiced singer-rapper from the Bronx with an easy instinct for melody. What helps him stand out from the current overstuffed class of artists with similar aesthetic approaches is his comfort moving between both light and dark subject matter, as on the hit “Brothers” and “Long Time.” CARAMANICA Over the past few years, this Texas native has found success in Nashville as a songwriter for Brett Eldredge among others. But listening to her recent debut album, the soothing and lovely “Borrowed Heart” — some of which was written with Lori McKenna — that work for others sounds superfluous. She’s got a sturdy, rich voice, and a way of bending a song toward sadness, where she sounds right at home. CARAMANICA The South African songwriter Nakhane Touré is also a novelist and actor whose works deal with a fraught upbringing: He broke away from conservative Christian “conversion therapy” to prize his identity as a gay man. The songs on his album “You Will Not Die” — released in Europe last year and due Feb. 22 in the United States — delve into both trauma and redemption. They ponder faith, pleasure, exile and belonging; they traverse hymns, neo-soul, South African pop and electronic dance music, and Nakhane’s voice crests in a vibrant, androgynous falsetto. Tenacity carries him toward joy. PARELES Of all the members of the YBN hip-hop collective, none shows more promise than YBN Cordae, a North Carolina rapper who specializes in thoughtful, emotionally eloquent and lyrically complex music. On songs like “Kung Fu,” he’s impressively dexterous, and of all the rappers who’ve taken swipes at J. Cole recently, only he handed any blows. CARAMANICA "
5c643f173a125f5075c097da,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/13/arts/supremes-photos-motown-grosse-pointe.html,"It’s a vision of two Detroits that have mostly faded now — the social set born of the American auto industry’s vast wealth and the galvanizing magic of ’60s Motown — together in a room. In June 1965, the Supremes, one of America’s biggest and most glamorous groups, performed at a debutante party at the Country Club of Detroit in Grosse Pointe, Mich., the posh all-white enclave just northeast of the city. It was the debutante party of Christy Cole Wilson, and The New York Times pictures of the event tell a layered story of two groups connected, at least for the evening, by the music of that time and place.  The three elegant darlings of Detroit, led by the 21-year-old Diana Ross, serenade a room of finely attired guests, many of practically the same age. But between the groups were also the realities of race and class — the distance between Grosse Pointe and the Brewster projects where the Supremes grew up, 10 miles and several worlds away. The Times covered the lavish event in avid detail. “It took three days, hundreds of fresh blue irises, thousands of little Italian lights and hundreds of thousands of yellow plastic flowers to turn the club into a French garden,” the story enthused. “Whole walls had disappeared behind Austrian silk panels of gold and mirrors before the 750 guests arrived.” Not until the eighth paragraph did the story mention that “when they were not dancing and being entertained by a rock ‘n’ roll group called the Supremes, the Wilsons and their guests were polishing off 20 cases of French champagne, attempting to create a liquor shortage (the plot failed), and heaping their plates with food from an abundantly stocked buffet table.” The trio hardly needed an identifier at that point. Between August 1964 and June 1965, the Supremes had five No. 1 singles, including “Baby Love,” “Stop! In the Name of Love” and “Back in My Arms Again,” which had gone to the top of the charts just six days before this party. Which is exactly why Ms. Wilson’s parents hired them. “Everyone had very glamorous deb parties when I was growing up,” said Ms. Wilson Hofmann, 72, who now lives in Bristol, R.I. Her father, Ralph C. Wilson Jr., a millionaire insurance scion who had “a stable in Lexington, Ky., and the Buffalo Bills football team,” seemed happy to toast his daughter in such style. The event reportedly cost $85,000, which would be roughly $675,000 today. (This was just the hometown event; the 18-year-old Ms. Wilson had already been formally presented at the Debutante Cotillion and Christmas Ball in New York in December 1964.) It was an era when families of distinction across the country presented their daughters to society, with the intention that suitable men from similar backgrounds would meet their future wives. In Grosse Pointe, it was the “Ford girls,” the great-granddaughters of Henry Ford, who had ramped up the deb-ball arms race. Nat King Cole sang at Charlotte Ford’s storied party in 1959, while Ella Fitzgerald performed at her sister Anne’s soiree in 1961. Racial dynamics were changing in the 1960s, but often in fits and starts. The Supremes performing at a private club in Grosse Pointe, which still had no black residents, reflected this lurching progress.  “Music filtered in,” said Izzy Donnelly, the director of education at the Grosse Pointe Historical Society. “The ’60s were about breaking tradition. Bringing black entertainers to debutante balls and private clubs was putting a big foot in the front door.” It wasn’t an intentional political statement to hire the Supremes to perform at her party, Ms. Wilson Hofmann said. She chose them because she loved their music, and she was from a family that could make her request happen. “I grew up in Grosse Pointe and loved the Supremes and that kind of music, like the Temptations and Marvin Gaye,” said Ms. Wilson Hofmann. “They were extraordinarily popular with white audiences, black audiences and everyone else,” said Dolores Barclay, an author and adjunct professor at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, who collaborated with Diana Ross on the singer’s memoir. “Appearing in white venues was breaking down racial barriers. But it’s a different type of disruption. It’s nonconfrontational. It’s having a platform and saying, ‘Yes, we’re here, we’re great and we’re a part of American music.’” The Supremes were homegrown celebrities in Detroit and received star treatment, but there were black entertainers across the country still entering clubs and performance halls through the kitchen. “Anything in the South was still tenuous,” said Coraleen Rawls, collections manager at the Motown Museum in Detroit. “On one hand, we had artists who were happy to perform because that’s their passion and vocation. But it was also disheartening to be international stars and still be treated differently.” Just two years after Ms. Wilson’s debut, Detroit would experience the devastating unrest of 1967, as the city’s racial and economic disparities exploded into national awareness. And the Motown sound would prove to be a powerful force in the healing process. “It unified people and brought us all together,” Ms. Rawls said. “Where there were ropes between whites and blacks, those ropes started disappearing, as the people on both sides were like, ‘We’re all dancing. Why do we have to have a rope in the middle? You’re dancing, I’m dancing. We’re singing, you’re singing, so why do we have to be separated by some rope because of some thoughts prior to our generation as to how you think we should be?’” The year after the Supremes played Ms. Wilson’s party, the first black family moved to Grosse Pointe, and by 1974, The Times reported that three African-American families called the town home. In 2019, Grosse Pointe Farms, where the Country Club of Detroit is, remains 94 percent white, while the city of Detroit is 79 percent black. The deb parties continued in Grosse Pointe, albeit in a scaled-back fashion. In 1970, The Times covered the celebration for Sheila Ford, another heir of the automobile family. She opted for a short purple dress instead of traditional formal attire, and hired the group Sha-Na-Na, who “played what the listeners called real modern blues music.” "
5c2bbf163a125f5075c02770,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/01/obituaries/norman-gimbel-dies-at-91.html,"Norman Gimbel, the wildly versatile Brooklyn-born lyricist who won a Grammy Award for a blues hit, “Killing Me Softly With His Song”; an Oscar for a folk ballad, “It Goes Like It Goes” (from “Norma Rae”); and television immortality for the bouncy series themes to “Happy Days” and “Laverne and Shirley,” died on Dec. 19 at his home in Montecito, Calif. He was 91. The death was confirmed by his son Tony, managing partner of his father’s music publishing company, Words West. Any attempt to categorize the elder Mr. Gimbel’s musical leanings would be complicated. He was famous for the English lyrics of “The Girl From Ipanema,” Antonio Carlos Jobim’s 1964 bossa nova hit originally written in Portuguese. He also wrote English lyrics for Michel Legrand’s music from Jacques Demy’s romantic 1964 French film “The Umbrellas of Cherbourg,” most notably “I Will Wait for You” (“Till you’re here beside me, till I’m touching you”) and for what became “I Will Follow Him,” a solid hit about teenage adoration sung by Little Peggy March (age 15) in 1963. Among his early hits, “Sway” (“When marimba rhythms start to play”) was clearly Latin-accented, even when Dean Martin sang it, and “Canadian Sunset,” recorded by Andy Williams, became a jazz standard. “Ready to Take a Chance Again” (from “Foul Play,” 1978), which earned an Oscar nomination, was a wistfully hopeful love song. Jim Croce’s 1973 hit “I Got a Name” (“Movin’ me down the highway, rollin’ down the highway, movin’ ahead so life won’t pass me by”) was quintessential folk rock. Mr. Gimbel worked with David Shire on “Norma Rae,” but his most frequent collaborator may have been Charles Fox. “Killing Me Softly,” which brought Mr. Gimbel and Mr. Fox the song-of-the-year Grammy after Roberta Flack released it in 1973, had a conflict-ridden back story. Lori Lieberman, a California bistro singer, had recorded the song first (Mr. Fox and Mr. Gimbel were her producers and managers) and she said that the lyrics (among them, “I felt he found my letters and read each one out loud”) had been based on a poem she had written about attending an emotionally stirring Don McLean concert. The song, which became a hit again with the Fugees’ hip-hop cover in the 1990s, is now sometimes listed as written “in collaboration with” Ms. Lieberman. Norman Gimbel was born in Brooklyn on Nov. 16, 1927. His parents — Morris Gimbel, who was in the restaurant business, and Lottie (Nass) Gimbel — were Jewish immigrants from Austria. Norman, who studied English at Baruch College and Columbia University, began his career working for the music publisher David Blum and for Edwin H. Morris & Company. His first hit was “Ricochet,” written with Larry Coleman and Joe Darion and recorded by Teresa Brewer in 1953. The saucy, country-tinged pop song (“If you’re careless with your kisses, find another turtle dove”) rose to No. 2 on the charts. Mr. Gimbel soon moved to Los Angeles, where he worked more widely in television and film, teaming up with Mr. Fox on the themes to the hit sitcoms “Laverne and Shirley” (“Schlemiel, schlimazle, Hassenpfeffer Incorporated”) and “Happy Days” (“Sunday, Monday, happy days”) and the 1970s series “Wonder Woman” and “The Paper Chase.” He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1984. Back in New York, Mr. Gimbel wrote lyrics for two Broadway musicals, “Whoop-Up” (1958) and “The Conquering Hero” (1961), working with the composer Moose Charlap. The first show, set on an American Indian reservation, earned two Tony nominations; the second, starring Tom Poston as a fake war hero, had a book by Larry Gelbart. Despite positive reviews, both musicals flopped at the box office and closed early. Both of Mr. Gimbel’s marriages, to the fashion model Elinor Rowley and to Victoria Carver, a lawyer, ended in divorce. In addition to his son Tony, survivors include another son, Peter; two daughters, Nelly Gimbel and Hannah Gimbel Dal Pozzo; and four grandchildren. Mr. Gimbel gave relatively few interviews. In a six-minute segment as a contestant (alongside Burt Bacharach and Jerry Leiber) on “Play Your Hunch,” an early Merv Griffin game show, he spoke only three words. That verbal reticence, though, served him well professionally. “Norman had the extraordinary ability with his lyrics to capture the human condition with never an excessive word to describe a feeling or an action,” Mr. Fox, the composer, said in a statement after his writing partner’s death. He went on to praise Mr. Gimbel’s ability to conjure an entire song with its first line, and he offered examples: “Tall and tan and young and lovely.” “Strumming my pain with his fingers.” “If it takes forever, I will wait for you.” "
5c91625749f0eacbf105defc,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/19/arts/music/tamaryn-dreaming-the-dark.html,"LOS ANGELES — On a rainy March evening, the singer-songwriter Tamaryn waited for a gnostic priest to begin his lecture on the transformative power of tarot at a small lodge in the Hollywood Hills. “This is the gothest night,” she whispered. A first-name-only artist who has been steadily releasing music for the past decade, Tamaryn, 37, appreciated Mother Nature’s cooperative stage direction: Between claps of thunder, lightning illuminated the stained-glass windows and the candlelit altar bearing a dagger and a single pink rose. “It’s not my religion,” she explained. “This is a journey I’m learning about. In 10 years, I might say it’s hocus-pocus.” Tamaryn’s fascination with mysticism largely stems from her fourth album, “Dreaming the Dark,” which is due on Friday and finds her confronting childhood memories in unexpected ways. Raised by her mother and godmother, both Jungian psychologists, along with a nomadic group of bohemian types who moved around New Zealand and, later, the western United States, Tamaryn said she frequently witnessed a form of therapy involving ritual theater. Participants would inhabit roles from the tarot deck’s Major Arcana — the 22 pictorial cards (like the Empress and the Devil) that in certain interpretations overlap with Carl Jung’s notion of archetypes and the collective unconscious. “I don’t think I ever thought it was normal,” she said over dinner a few days later during an intense conversation that spanned several hours. A lace maroon top covered her black bustier, and a glow-in-the-dark cross dangled from one ear. “But they basically instilled the idea that creativity is a route to heal,” she continued, “and that applies in such a huge way to my life now.” Since leaving home at 13, Tamaryn, born Tamaryn Brown, has spoken only sporadically to her mother. (She never met her late father, but knows he was a competitive bridge player.) Before settling in Los Angeles three years ago, she lived in San Francisco and New York. Denizens of the Lower East Side in the rapidly gentrifying early aughts might have bumped into her at Mondo Kim’s on St. Marks Place, where she was a salesclerk (“I would sit there and listen to Lydia Lunch really loud,” she said), or behind the bar at the similarly defunct club Tonic, where she also performed one-off shows with various outfits. “Dreaming the Dark” is her first album since the 2015 LP “Cranekiss,” both of which were written and produced alongside Jorge Elbrecht, known for his collaborations with Ariel Pink. Driven by lushly orchestrated synths and emotionally intense vocals, the record’s nine songs invoke a range of influences, including Sisters of Mercy, the composer Angelo Badalamenti and Kanye West circa “808s & Heartbreak.” (She said she specifically wanted to mimic “the whipping sounds” from Depeche Mode’s “Master and Servant” for the industrial number “Victim Complex.”) The intentionally low-budget music videos that she’s been directing have, in psychoanalytic parlance, unlocked her subconscious. She realized she was relying heavily on tarot imagery — for instance, casting herself as the Moon upon a crescent-shaped swing for “Angels of Sweat.” “I didn’t come up with this concept,” she said. “It revealed itself to me.” She acknowledged that her approach might sound “woo-woo,” but she doesn’t care. From an early age, Tamaryn was encouraged to be wary of the mainstream. “When I was 7, my godmother saw me dancing super sexy in front of the TV to the ‘Solid Gold’ dancers,” she said. “She was like, ‘That’s not the only way to dance.’ She took me into her room, put on Kate Bush’s ‘The Dreaming,’ and was like, ‘No one’s watching you, move any way that makes sense to the music.’” Despite attracting critically positive notices since her 2010 debut LP “The Waves,” Tamaryn hasn’t had a breakout moment and has supplemented her income with various jobs. For a spell in 2013, she helped the Dum Dum Girls with general creative direction, scoring the interstitial music to a video written by Bret Easton Ellis for their song “Are You Okay?” She has also built step-and-repeats for red-carpet events and worked in the shipping department of a perfume company. “There’s this myth that you’re a failure if you have to have a job,” she said, casually tugging at the fringed bangs of her crimson-red hair. “I kind of feel the opposite. I feel you should keep your creativity as uncompromised as you can.” “The Waves” and its 2012 follow-up, “Tender New Signs,” both recorded with the guitarist Rex John Shelverton, proudly embraced the atmospheric soundscapes and washed-out vocals of their shoegaze roots. But eventually, according to Tamaryn, “I could have put out a straight-up disco song, and somebody would say that it was pushing the boundaries of shoegaze.” She laughed. She intended “Cranekiss” to be the “first statement that I’m no longer a band working within certain parameters.” She switched up her collaborators, bringing in Elbrecht, a member of the art collective Lansing-Drieden, and Shaun Durkan from the Bay Area noise-pop band Weekend. “She was really precise with what she wanted,” said Elbrecht. “It’s pretty crucial to her to have a certain melancholic feeling.” The “Cranekiss” centerpiece “Hands All Over Me” earned her a fan in Sky Ferreira, who Tamaryn said later asked her to do some writing. The album also impressed the musician Mariqueen Maandig Reznor, who praised Tamaryn’s “talent and good taste” in an email, adding that she has played the LP “every other day for the last four years. I was unsure if I would ever stop consistently listening to it, but now I have ‘Dreaming the Dark,’ and have it on rotation obsessively.” But following “Cranekiss,” she took a break from music. Craving stability — a quest that, as a child, led her to figure skate competitively, she said — she went to school to be hair colorist. She ended up traveling to Japan as a hair model, donning rainbow-colored extensions and performing David Bowie songs at various events. “I thought I was quitting touring to settle down and get a trade and then it’s like, no, I’m literally dressed as a mermaid singing ‘Life on Mars,’” she said. At the same time, she was mourning her friend, the celebrity photographer Matt Irwin, who died by suicide in 2016. “The last conversation I had with him was about a toxic relationship that he couldn’t get over,” she said. “It was a wake-up call.” “Dreaming the Dark” is dedicated to him. Sensing it was time to return to music, Tamaryn connected with a young Vegas-based musician named Jordan Collins through Instagram who inspired her to write some demos with him about her own unhealthy relationships. “A lot of things on this record I can’t say to other people, because I shouldn’t talk to those people,” she said. And in early 2018, she reconvened with Elbrecht, who pushed her to explore “the pop quality” of her vocal range, he said. “She could really get up high and project.” As a result, many of her new songs, like the standout “Path to Love,” share a similar theatricality with her formative inspiration, Kate Bush. “It could be emotionally draining to listen to it all the way through,” she said, with a laugh. She is already at work on a follow-up EP, and will spend the spring touring South America and Europe. Tamaryn does not expect to quit her latest day job — a freelance gig narrating erotic audiobooks — at the moment, but that’s O.K. “I just want to look back and be able to mark the different eras of my life by the records I made,” she said. “That’s the only real goal.” "
5c5af6773a125f5075c084d9,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/06/arts/music/grammy-awards-preview.html,"Year after year, I have dutifully watched the Grammy Awards. And the next morning, year after year, I have wondered why. I’ll be watching on Sunday, when the Grammys air on CBS, but with thoroughly limited expectations. The Grammy show strives each year to keep up with what just happened in music and to ameliorate its past errors. But after a while, blundering along just isn’t funny anymore. Awards shows are thankless at best; there are invariably complaints about omissions and honest disagreements over winners. Meanwhile, the demands of network television are by no means aligned with the dozens of Grammy Awards that recognize music’s less commercial genres along with the grunt work of making recordings. (The vast majority of the 84 Grammys are handed out in a live-streamed ceremony before the prime-time television spectacle, which only squeezes in about a dozen awards between live performances.) This year, the Recording Academy is atoning for an unforced error by its outgoing president, Neil Portnow, who ends his term in July. In 2018, he responded to a question about the lack of women receiving televised awards on the show, in line with harsh statistics about the Grammys’ historical lack of recognition for women, by saying that women need to “step up” — apparently oblivious to systemic barriers for women’s careers, not to mention overt harassment. (He later said he regretted his choice of words.) Sunday’s reparations include having the impeccable Alicia Keys as host and a performance by Diana Ross — who turns 75 on March 26 and who, in Grammy annals, was given a lifetime achievement award in 2012 after exactly zero wins either with the Supremes or in her solo career. Women also dominate the lineup of the show’s other announced performers and are well represented among the nominees for major awards. However, several of those are collaborations with men, like the Bradley Cooper-Lady Gaga duet “Shallow,” Maren Morris’s lead vocal on “The Middle” with Zedd and Grey, and Cardi B with Bad Bunny and J Balvin in “I Like It.” The top categories — record (for the artist, producers and engineers), song (for songwriters) and album of the year, along with best new artist — have also been expanded from five nominees to eight, an easy way for the Grammys to claim more diversity. Selections like those should make the statistics look more equitable in, perhaps, a few decades. Music is the most nimble of mass-audience art forms. Now it can be recorded alone on a computer and released immediately online, and it evolves fast, constantly pulling in ideas from the cultural margins, whether that’s beats from Caribbean sound systems or murky, disconsolate SoundCloud rap. The Grammys’ mandate is to sift through the welter of music released every year, rewarding merit and recognizing innovation (though not, strictly speaking, from the past year, but from the preceding Oct. 1 to Sept. 30, which can make some nominations seem ancient). The Recording Academy, the organization behind the Grammys, was modeled after the Oscars’ Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences: tabulating votes from industry pros, both artists and technicians, presumably to add up to informed choices. But history has not been kind to the Grammys’ winners for album of the year. In 1967, Frank Sinatra’s “A Man and His Music” beat the Beatles’ “Revolver.” In 1985, Lionel Richie’s “Can’t Slow Down” was chosen over Prince’s “Purple Rain,” Bruce Springsteen’s “Born in the U.S.A.,” Tina Turner’s “Private Dancer” and Cyndi Lauper’s “She’s So Unusual.” And last year, Bruno Mars won the top prize over more adventurous albums by Kendrick Lamar, Lorde, Jay-Z and Childish Gambino. Recording Academy voters have been reliably stodgy and ballad-loving, at best befuddled and at worst wrongheaded. It often seems that the Tin Pan Alley holdouts whose Grammy votes regularly pushed back against rock — as late as 1995, when Tony Bennett’s “MTV Unplugged” was album of the year (leading to ridicule and the creation of a “traditional pop” category) — have been replaced by rock holdouts who are still suspicious of hip-hop. The Grammys have recognized undeniable blockbusters by black performers, like Michael Jackson’s “Thriller” and Lauryn Hill’s “The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill.” But they have snubbed paradigm-shifters like Beyoncé’s “Lemonade” (which lost album of the year in 2017 to a more conventional pop megahit, Adele’s “25”). In 2014, Macklemore & Ryan Lewis won best new artist and best rap album over the clearly superior Kendrick Lamar. (Besieged by criticism, the Grammys repented; Lamar has gotten multiple awards and nominations since then, including this year for the “Black Panther” soundtrack album, and he was the show’s incendiary live opening performer in 2018.) The 61-year history of the Grammys is tied to the idea of network TV as a monoculture, and the show once presented a rare chance for millions of people to share a live musical performance. Assured of an audience, the Grammys of yesteryear often presented classical music and jazz — non-popular genres — that have disappeared from more current, metrics-driven iterations of the awards. The show is flashier now, and more determined to offer end-to-end pop-star power. But in the era of on-demand music video and proliferating cable channels, the Grammys have lost any clear role as America’s TV musical centerpiece. And if the initial idea of a prime-time network Grammy show was that multiple generations could share the full spectrum of music, it hasn’t worked out that way. Instead, the Grammys come off as the older generation scolding the young, the entrenched trying to rein in the newcomers. I have long had a rule of thumb that the album that includes the oldest songs wins: Norah Jones’s debut album, Herbie Hancock’s “River: The Joni Letters,” Natalie Cole’s “Unforgettable … With Love,” Eric Clapton’s “Unplugged,” the “O Brother, Where Art Thou?” soundtrack. (This year, Cardi B could benefit from the oldest-song effect; “I Like It” is built on a 1967 Pete Rodriguez boogaloo, “I Like It Like That.”) In recent years, the show has touted unique collaborations, “Grammy Moments,” that try to suggest musical and historical continuity between eras; this year promises Post Malone with the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Too often, though, Grammy Moments have meant fading elders performing alongside up-and-comers who learned their “influences” on the TelePrompTer. The Grammys still have some redeeming features. In the non-prime-time, non-pop categories, a Grammy win can help sustain a career. The broadcast provides glimpses of music history in its lifetime-achievement tributes — its version of community service. And even in an era when musicians play on television from morning shows into late nights, Grammy slots hold a little drama; ask Adele, who was sabotaged by tech ineptitude in 2016. Music-business strategists have long understood that a memorable prime-time performance pays off while award snubs are soon forgotten, and this year’s Grammys should be a bonanza for H.E.R., a slow-burn R&B singer who’s an unexpected contender for top prizes and who will be performing. So yes, I’ll be watching. I’ll even click onto the preshow awards, which will be punctuated by an international lineup of live music including Fatoumata Diawara and Natalia Lafourcade. Just don’t talk to me the morning after. "

Just want the music? Listen to the Playlist on Spotify here (or find our profile: nytimes). Like what you hear? Let us know at theplaylist@nytimes.com and sign up for our Louder newsletter, a once-a-week blast of our pop music coverage. The first original song Sky Ferreira has released since 2013 veers sharply away from the armor-clad pop that filled her first album. But in a way, it’s a segue from that record’s ominous (and atypical) title song, “Night Time, My Time,” by way of the latter-day “Twin Peaks”; she produced the song with the music supervisor for “Twin Peaks,” Dean Hurley. A full minute of a dirgelike string-section instrumental — keening and quivering above, pulsating below — opens “Downhill Lullaby” before Ferreira comes in, singing a chantlike verse in a low, ragged voice: “You leave me open when you hit me/No one can hear you, then you hurt me.” She announced back in 2015 that her next album would be called “Masochism”; this makes clear why. JON PARELES From 1969-72, Joseph Jefferson led a Philadelphia funk band called the Nat Turner Rebellion, which released a few singles — including “Tribute to a Slave” in 1969 — and left an album’s worth of unreleased music in the vaults of Sigma Sound Studios. The first full Nat Turner Rebellion album, “Laugh to Keep from Crying,” has now been compiled by independent archivists and music-business students at Drexel University, which received thousands of tapes from Sigma Sound as a donation. “Tribute to a Slave,” a greeting across eras to the rebel slave Nat Turner, is vintage socially conscious, tambourine-shaking funk. Amid wah-wah guitars and assertive horns, it proclaims, “We ain’t slaves no more.” PARELES Cage the Elephant and Beck made a Twenty One Pilots song. (A good thing!) CARYN GANZ Recently, Lil Uzi Vert announced online that his career was on hold, if not over. What appeared to be a disagreement with his label seemed to be imperiling the release of any new music, including the long-awaited album “Eternal Atake.” In the last couple of days, however, there’s been some movement amid the uncertainty. “Free Uzi” — which his label said was not an official release — made its way to SoundCloud and YouTube, and displayed Uzi at his frenetic best: rapping about a woman “back on my team/ ’cause my neck wet like a squeegee”; alluding to issues with his finances; and confessing to watching “The Big Bang Theory.” JON CARAMANICA Rosalía’s first release since last year’s vivid and clever nu-flamenco album “El Mal Querer” is “Con Altura,” a sweetly melodic reggaeton number featuring a tart and restrained guest verse from J Balvin. The song is impressive, and the video, by Director X, is a riot of colorful outfits, flexible dance, and the confidence that comes with knowing every step you’ve chosen is the right one. CARAMANICA “Hustle” couldn’t bang any more bluntly; it’s three minutes of tightly packed pop escalation. “Don’t hustle me,” Pink berates a guy who “took my love/mistook it for weakness.” Then she restates the line with a blunter word that radio stations and this newspaper won’t use. The swinging beat harks back to rockabilly, and so does Pink’s belted-with-a-grin vocal, but the production expects a minuscule 21st-century attention span, springing a new sound — handclaps, backup voices, gunshots, bell tones, synthetic horns — every four bars if not sooner. It’s as meticulous as it is brash. PARELES Kelly Clarkson and Pink have been working in parallel for almost two decades. In 2017, when both artists had new albums (“Meaning of Life” and “Beautiful Trauma”) they teamed for a cover of R.E.M.’s “Everybody Hurts” at the American Music Awards. Now they’ve collaborated — along with Marshmello and Ed Sheeran’s “Shape of You” team of Johnny McDaid and Steve Mac — on a classic empowerment anthem either of them could have sung. It’s from the forthcoming animated movie “UglyDolls,” in which Clarkson plays a plush toy seeking self-acceptance. Perhaps in the future this duo of powerhouse vocalists and electric live performers will seek a co-headlining arena tour. GANZ As the influence of Nigerian highlife and American funk stretched across West Africa in the 1970s, different cultural traditions found their own ways in. In Benin, Sir Victor Uwaifo became known for rendering the ekassa — a rhythm and dance associated with the coronation of a new king — as a modern sound. On “IIziegbe (Ikassa No. 70),” horns and voices call back to him from across a bed of buoyant bass drum, played on every off-beat. This is one of 12 recently dug-up tracks, all from different artists, released Friday in the latest installment of Strut Records’ “Nigeria 70” series. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO “Put your makeup on, girl, stand up straight/Your face will take you farther than your brain”: The mother figure that haunts “Pretty Shiny Things,” the harrowing and beautiful new single from the country singer Kassi Ashton, is vicious and unapologetic. Ashton paints her with the savage acuity of Miranda Lambert and the lonely sorrow of Julie Roberts, which is to say she’s painful to listen to, but hard to ignore. CARAMANICA Bluesy, fingerpicked electric guitar, and not much else, accompanies Pink Sweats in “I Know,” from the new EP “Vol. 2.” It’s a love song with a streak of desperation — “There must a reason that you’re stealing my soul” — and with a high, mournful vocal, Pink Sweats resigns himself to obsession. PARELES This year’s carnival season in Colombia has ended, but two top Colombian bands extend the party with this collaboration that pools their strengths: deep dancehall-like growls from Systema Solar and the tart lead vocals of Liliana Saumet from Bomba Estéreo, entwined guitars that hint at both cumbia and Congolese pop, busily arpeggiating synthesizers and deep-dive bass lines, even some traditionalist Afro-Colombian drumming. “There will always be Carnival,” the song insists, working to make it true. PARELES Secret Machines, one of the best trios of the aughts, released a live album this week that was recorded in 2006 at the Garage in London. “Nowhere Again” is from the group’s thundering, ominous 2004 debut, “Now Here Is Nowhere,” but the band played it a bit poppier at this show shortly before the release of its second LP, “Ten Silver Drops.” A year later, the guitarist Benjamin Curtis left the band to focus on another project, School of Seven Bells. He died from lymphoma in 2013 and documents of his time in Secret Machines with his brother, the keyboardist and singer Brandon, and the drummer Josh Garza are very valuable. GANZ A tenacious 5/4 pulse propels “Crow’s Perch” through a slew of post-punk transformations in just four minutes: from muffled bass line through sparse, almost jazzy ballad, through brittle patterns and strangulated one-syllable vocal lines, through a briefly restrained spoken-word passage on the way to a crashing, shouting, dissonant peak. It’s math-rock confronting a world of chaos. PARELES Betty Carter was jazz’s quintessential modernist: She liked to tease and stretch a classic melody until it was almost misshapen, testing her elastic instinct against the structure of a piece. In this live recording, captured at Lincoln Center in 1992 during the heady final years of her career, Carter sings “If I Should Lose You” in duet with the young pianist Geri Allen. The accompanist treats the song with her own sense of passionate restraint, collapsing its harmonies at the center, as if to represent the song’s fraught, nearly fatalist romanticism. A record of the concert has just been released on CD by Blue Engine Records, Jazz at Lincoln Center’s in-house label. RUSSONELLO "
5c80210b49f0eacbf105bae8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/06/arts/music/nakhane-you-will-not-die.html,"LONDON — To command stages and mesmerize crowds, musicians often have to be larger than life: a bigger head, a heavier foot. But Nakhane slipped quietly into a grand London hotel late one Sunday last month, soft-stepping even in combat boots, taking up little space in a corner armchair with a feline kind of grace. Nakhane, 31, who was born Nakhane Mavuso and has used Nakhane Touré as an artist name, had shrugged off the opportunity to show off his East End neighborhood, his home since moving from South Africa in 2018. “My life has always been internal,” he said. “Journalists say, ‘Take us to your favorite places,’ and I never had them. I don’t go anywhere except to the coffee shop around the corner.” Nakhane’s music, on the other hand, stretches up and out. His voice — grand, sweeping, choir-trained and soul-stirred — is a trumpet blast. And his new album, “You Will Not Die,” released last year in Europe and Africa and in the United States last month, is an LP of aching contradictions, at once sensual and spiritual, wrestling with faith, love, lust and country. Nakhane’s music has an orchestral grandeur and a quicksilver soul. Raised by an aunt who sang opera, he grew up to a score of Handel, Mozart and Bach, to which his aunt eventually added Marvin Gaye and the O’Jays. But the glamorous spirit of David Bowie hovers over the record, too, and when Nakhane began working with the producer Ben Christophers (Bat for Lashes), the singer told him, “Let’s take the second side of ‘Low’ and write songs with it, but as if it was in the streets of South Africa.” For the moment, though, he has given up South Africa for a life abroad. In his home country, Nakhane, who is queer, has been threatened with both death and damnation. He wrote “You Will Not Die” after leaving his church, for which he had evangelized an anti-gay theology. He ultimately left the country after starring in “The Wound,” a film that set a gay love plot against the backdrop of the traditional initiation ritual for Xhosa boys. The film was a hit on the festival circuit and was South Africa’s submission to the Academy Awards. But it also drew fury for revealing intimate details of the Ulwaluko, the circumcision ceremony he underwent as a young man, and for showing that gayness, far from being a foreign infection as some South Africans prefer to believe, exists among the Xhosa, too. “I still can’t go home to Port Elizabeth,” he said of the city on the Eastern Cape where he grew up. “I know my people. We are very passionate people.” South Africa is relatively permissive on L.G.B.T.Q. issues, but the churches he and his family attended were rigidly doctrinaire. So despite coming out at 17 to his friends and 19 to his family, Nakhane renounced being gay after a chance meeting with a pastor’s son at the record shop where he worked. He threw himself into the church, attending bible studies, singing in the church band and preaching the possibility of conversion. Eventually, buckling under the strain of denying himself — coupled with a growing awareness of the colonialist implications of the church’s teachings, and a racist dynamic he could no longer ignore — he left. “I’m not angry at it anymore,” Nakhane said of his life then. He has removed those he knew in the church from his life, he said, but has less venom for them than the press would wish, he added. “They did love me,” he said. “This is all they knew.” What he knew was the destiny he believed in for himself. “You are going to be one of the most important South African artists to come out of this country,” he recalled telling himself while still a student in Johannesburg. “You don’t know when. You don’t know how. But it’s going to happen. And the work starts now.” The work started with “Brave Confusion,” a folksy 2013 album released in South Africa that performed better critically than commercially. But it was the collapse of all that he knew — his exit from the church after six years, a period of financial hardship and quasi-homelessness — that led to the emotional breakthroughs he explores on “You Will Not Die.” Even for someone who had grown up thinking of songwriting as a form of divine inspiration (“It seemed like such a priestly job. You’ve been chosen to write a song”), being chosen is not an uncomplicated blessing, and Nakhane is not romantic about the alchemy of turning experience in art. His work, as he described it, is taking the “shrapnel” of inspiration and forming it into something. “Songs are dangerous,” he said. “Art is dangerous. And painful. You do it because you have to.” For all its pain and longing, “You Will Not Die” is not bleak: It tracks a long arc toward joy. “Interloper” is dark but up-tempo — self-affirmation to a propulsive beat. “Never live in fear again, no, never again,” is the chorus of “New Brighton,” a single recorded with Anohni, whose music has sonic parallels with Nakhane’s own. The two never met, Anohni said in an email, and completed the track separately. But she called it “exuberant and so heartbreaking,” and Nakhane’s music “very beautiful and soulful and smoldering.” His fearlessness is drawing admirers. Madonna called him one of her favorite artists, and the filmmaker John Cameron Mitchell cast him in his new project, a musical radio-play-by-podcast called “Anthem: Homunculus,” which will debut in late April. “To me, he is some kind of love child of James Baldwin, David Bowie and Grace Jones,” Mitchell said. “He’s the most exciting new renaissance artist I’ve seen this century.” For now, Nakhane is adjusting to his own new horizons: living in London with a boyfriend, touring his music, beginning to write more. (He is at work on what may turn into his second novel.) He is back on good terms with his family, and spiritual, if no longer religious, about the unique privilege of being Nakhane. “Someone like me could never have existed in any other era than now,” he said. “The fact that I have an album being released internationally, being an out, political, queer black person who speaks his mind and makes good music? My existence is miraculous.” "
5ca6228249f0eacbf1f80e6d,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/04/style/beyonce-adidas-collaboration.html,"After Kanye and Adidas, and Rihanna and Puma; after Questlove and Nike, and Kendrick Lamar and Reebok, it was only a matter of time. And on Thursday, the first lady of Everything, Beyoncé Knowles, entered the sneaker wars. Adidas announced that it would collaborate with Ms. Knowles on several endeavors, including a signature collection with Adidas and an expansion of the singer’s active-wear brand, Ivy Park. She will be a creative partner at Adidas. In a statement, Ms. Knowles called the coming collaboration the “partnership of a lifetime” and touted a shared philosophy “that puts creativity, growth and social responsibility at the forefront of business.” The pop star and entrepreneur will retain ownership of Ivy Park, which was introduced in 2016 in partnership with Topshop and sells comfort wear and athleisure at retailers including Nordstrom. In 2018, Ms. Knowles acquired full ownership of the company after Sir Philip Green, Topshop’s owner, was accused of racial abuse and sexual harassment. Little financial information about Ivy Park is available, and it is unclear how successful the brand has been. It was immediately popular upon its release in 2016. On Thursday, its website had been altered to broadcast the Adidas partnership. The Beyoncé/Adidas collaboration is perhaps the most notable partnership between a superstar and a sports brand yet, and it indicates the consumer and social power that can be derived from such cross-branding. It is also a tribute to the lane Rihanna paved in 2014 when she became a creative director and global ambassador at Puma, back when it was still a novel idea that an entertainer might lend her name to a company best known for athletic apparel. (Rihanna parted ways with Puma and is now said to be working with LVMH on her own luxury brand.) Championing women and girls has become a key part of Adidas’s public relations strategy. This month, the company announced a new phase of its “She Breaks Barriers” initiative, which highlights the lack of equal media coverage for women’s sports in the United States.  Ms. Knowles has positioned herself as a political voice for black Americans and for women, including through her musical examination of her marriage and her 2018 Coachella performance, which gave a platform to historically black colleges. She will amplify these messages, and those Adidas has already pushed, by giving the company her imprimatur. “Beyoncé is an iconic creator but also a proven business leader, and together, we have the ability to inspire change and empower the next generation of creators,” said Eric Liedtke, a member of the executive board of Adidas AG. Adidas’s “multilayered” partnership with Ms. Knowles will include a program whose resources will be given over to “the next generation of athletes, creators and leaders.” Last July, Forbes estimated that Ms. Knowles was worth $355 million, citing her most recent solo album, “Lemonade,” her million-dollar-grossing tour with her husband Jay-Z and the value of her stake in his streaming service, Tidal.

5c943e7b49f0eacbf105e63b,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/21/theater/aint-too-proud-review-the-temptations.html,"As befits a show about the Temptations, the most infectiously rhythmic of chart-topping R&B groups, “Ain’t Too Proud” keeps time in style. I don’t mean that solely in terms of a beat that makes you feel like dancing. Of course, as you watch this latest entry in Broadway’s ever-expanding jukebox musical sweepstakes, you will no doubt find your legs twitching, as if from muscle memory. That’s the urge being translated with such sublime grace by those five natty men on the stage, Platonic ideals of stepping high and looking fine. But it is also true that time, unforgiving and unstoppable, is cannily presented as the shaping element in “Ain’t Too Proud: The Life and Times of the Temptations,” which opened on Thursday under the shrewd direction of Des McAnuff, with sensational choreography by Sergio Trujillo. As the show charts the changing fortunes of men who became synonymous with Motown’s glory days, the years keep moving forward with the relentlessness of a conveyor belt in an auto-making assembly line. [Read about Cholly Atkins, the real-life choreographer for the Temptations.]  It’s enough to wear a strong man down. And more than any of the (oh so many) pop-songbook shows that have befallen Broadway since the Abba-spouting behemoth “Mamma Mia!” opened in 2001, “Ain’t Too Proud” is a story of attrition. We watch as the core lineup of the original Temptations is whittled down to the last man standing. That’s the group’s leader and show’s narrator, Otis Williams, played with anchoring gravity by Derrick Baskin. Ultimately, though, it’s the music that’s the sole survivor. And that’s what’s being celebrated here — the collective miracle of a blissfully silken sound forged out of clashing egos, many misfires and life-wrecking hard work into numbers that keep playing in our memories. While honoring all the expected biomusical clichés, which include rolling out its subjects’ greatest hits in brisk and sometimes too fragmented succession, this production refreshingly emphasizes the improbable triumph of rough, combustible parts assembled into glistening smoothness. Dominique Morisseau, who wrote the show’s book, is the gifted author of a cycle of smart, tough-minded plays based in her native Detroit, where much of “Ain’t Too Proud” is also set. Her script, adapted from Otis Williams’s 1988 memoir, reminds us that the Detroit-based Motown Records — the crossover label run by Berry Gordy (Jahi Kearse) that revolutionized pop music — was indeed a factory of sorts, one that rigorously processed and refined raw talent for mass consumption. This means that unlike such current fare as “Beautiful” (about Carole King), and “The Cher Show,” “Ain’t Too Proud” isn’t focused on a single star, with the attendant by-the-numbers psychology. Instead, we have a study in group dynamics, in which the balance shifts in ways big and small, as the component parts keep changing. As Otis observes early on, after the firing of the group’s original lead singer, Al Bryant (Jarvis B. Manning Jr.), “Sometimes Temp stood for temporary.” This sense of interchangeability (and expendability) is given witty visual life in the second act, when a cavalcade of identically dressed Temptations, past and present fills the front of the stage. (Paul Tazewell did the delicious costumes.) [What’s new onstage and off: Sign up for our Theater Update newsletter.] Not that the audience is ever likely to confuse one Temp for another. The five-member group that most people know as the Temptations is embodied with piquantly detailed individuality by charismatic, supple-voiced actors who astutely convey the imbalanced equations of ego and accommodation in their characters. They are, in addition to Mr. Baskin, James Harkness (as Paul Williams), Jawan M. Jackson (as a Melvin Franklin who talks as well as sings in a thundering bass), Jeremy Pope (late of “Choir Boy,” who here plays Eddie Kendricks) and a smoking hot Ephraim Sykes (as David Ruffin). We meet them first as a team, singing “The Way You Do the Things You Do,” the Temptations hit from 1964, before Otis shepherds us back to the group’s starting point. That segue follows the formula established by “Jersey Boys,” the long-running Broadway hit from 2005 about the Four Seasons, also directed by Mr. McAnuff and generally considered the gold standard for jukebox biographies. (It has been reincarnated Off Broadway at New World Stages.) Like “Jersey Boys,” “Ain’t Too Proud” rapidly follows a fairly straightforward timeline through some pretty rough terrain. So in addition to seeing the Temps on (and back) stage, and in the recording studio — with mentors that include Smokey Robinson (Christian Thompson) and Norman Whitfield (Mr. Manning) — we are given quick-sketch glimpses of the grim personal and social problems that derail them. (Robert Brill’s set, lighted by Howell Binkley with projections by Peter Nigrini, neatly balances grit and glamour throughout.) Some of these synoptic moments can seem bizarrely perfunctory, as in a crack-smoking sequence and, worse, a party scene that portrays Ruffin’s abusive relationship with the singer Tammi Terrell (Nasia Thomas). And the attempts to portray the dawning social consciences of the singers — who became famous at the height of the civil rights movement — can feel strained. (On the other hand, I enjoyed the brief encounters with the women in the men’s lives, including the Supremes, led by Candice Marie Woods in a pitch-perfect evocation of Diana Ross, and Rashidra Scott makes the most of her onstage time as Otis’s neglected wife, Josephine.) Mercifully, the show mostly avoids the usual jukebox pitfall of jimmying in songs to reflect the plot in literal ways. Instead, the musical numbers generally register as a rippling, liquid mirror of societal and personal flux, especially in the ways they show the Temptations’ sound being calibrated to suit a mainstream (i.e., white) audience. As for the performance of those songs, orchestrated by Harold Wheeler with musical direction and arrangements by Kenny Seymour, they’re pretty close to perfection. They’re not entirely mimetic, which is a relief. These Temps (whose later additional members are ably incarnated by Saint Aubyn, E. Clayton Cornelious and Mr. Thompson) sound enough like their prototypes to satisfy hard-core fans. But the fabulous standards, which include “Cloud Nine” and “Papa Was a Rollin’ Stone,” have been reimagined with a heightened Broadway flair that stops short of pandering. This is especially true of the sinuous synchronicity of Mr. Trujillo’s choreography, in which everyone is often doing the same moves, but with a subtle, stylish edge that sets each member apart. (Or not so subtle, though still highly stylish, in the case of Mr. Sykes’s spectacular scissor splits.) You’re always aware of the component parts in this well-oiled music machine. As its title suggests, “Ain’t Too Proud” promotes the virtue of humility, at least when it comes to keeping a team together. But it also makes sure that these men never become ciphers. The happy paradox of this group portrait is that everybody gets to be a star. "

Rogers became a phenomenon while riding a wave beyond her control. Her first full-length album, “Heard It in a Past Life,” debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard album chart this week, and it is largely the product of her trying to outrun the expectations that came on the heels of that clip. Her music has roots in folk, but is very familiar with contemporary electronic pop — a modern hybrid that places her squarely near pop’s aesthetic center even as she tries to maintain an outsider’s perspective. There are a few parallels between Rogers, still in the early stages of her career, and Sharon Van Etten, whose fifth studio album, “Remind Me Tomorrow,” marks a shift away from the cold, aching folk of her early releases into something more contemporary without losing its emotional intelligence.

At age 6, she spied a “magical ring” on the finger of her grandmother, the aristocratic Silvia Rodríguez de Rivas, which turned out to be a black opal surrounded by diamonds — a gift from the heiress Barbara Hutton. De Castellane has been collecting the stones since 1995, mostly from Australia, where many of the world’s best opals are found. In their surfaces, she sees “nature and the sea.” Now celebrating the 20th anniversary of her first jewelry line for Dior, de Castellane has dozens of opal pendants, rings and bracelets in her personal collection; some are her own design, others are vintage pieces. She wears them with everything from her signature Alaïa flared dresses to Liberty prints. “They’re like something out of a fantasy, like my own personal treasure,” she says — stones for all seasons.

They’re a mix of Australian and Ethiopian stones.” Ethiopian pinfire opal ring. “I bought this in Venice in 2015. The transparency of Ethiopian opals looks like water lit with fluorescent lights.” Opal bracelet. “I love to embellish the black opal’s natural colors with lacquer, as I did here with the silver and gold leaf.

I especially love black opals, which aren’t really black, just dark.” Australian boulder opal bracelet. “This stone reminds me of the Mediterranean, where I spent summers as a child.

5c94c08b49f0eacbf105e782,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/22/movies/the-dirt-review.html,"Mötley Crüe’s first gig, as dramatized in Jeff Tremaine’s Netflix adaptation of the band’s memoir, “The Dirt,” does not go well. The drummer, Tommy Lee, knocks over a cymbal before anyone plays a note; the crowd’s heckling turns into a full-on brawl. But when that fight is over, a guy in the back punctures the silence to scream, “[Expletive] yeah, Mötley Crüe!” And that sentiment is an apt summation of the approach and complexity of this tepid, incompetent biopic. The book version, attributed to all four members and the writer Neil Strauss, was a notorious tell-all, reveling in the group’s bad behavior and self-mythologizing. But Tremaine and the screenwriters Rich Wilkes and Amanda Adelson have sanded it down to a junior varsity “Bohemian Rhapsody,” complete with many of the same crude devices: embarrassingly bad wigs, hilariously on-the-nose needle drops (the band plays “Take Me to the Top” as they go … to the top) and declamatory, subtext-free dialogue. As with “Bohemian,” the result is the kind of paint-by-numbers storytelling that “Walk Hard” should have smothered in its crib over a decade ago. Tremaine’s staging is as convincing as an ’80s-themed party at an insurance office, and the film is shot with all the visual punch of a period Bud Light commercial. The nonstop preening and partying of the first half is exhausting, but the comedown, in which Tremaine attempts to rearrange the film into a serious character drama, is downright painful. The filmmakers try desperately to have it both ways, flipping from cheerful hedonism to “Reefer Madness”-style moralizing. The complexities of addiction seems out of their grasp. Biopics love to dazzle us with their try-hard verisimilitude, and this one gives us nearly 10 minutes of end-credit split-screen comparisons between the real Crüe and the movie Crüe, presumably so we can marvel at the skill of the duplication. But that’s cosplay, not moviemaking. Until then, “The Dirt” plays like an ill-advised remake of “This Is Spinal Tap” — one in which all the laughs are unintentional. "
5c91405d49f0eacbf105de9a,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/19/business/media/ariana-grande-7-rings-rodgers-hammerstein.html,"This week, Ariana Grande’s “7 Rings” hit No. 1 on Billboard’s singles chart for the sixth time, the latest victory for a song that broke records when it was released in January and has since been streamed more than a billion times around the world. But when it comes to royalties for “7 Rings,” the biggest winner may be two songwriters who died decades ago: Rodgers and Hammerstein. Ms. Grande’s song is an extended reinterpretation of “My Favorite Things” from “The Sound of Music,” with Ms. Grande changing the original’s lyrics about innocent joys — “raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens” — to an anthem of empowerment through conspicuous consumption. “Breakfast at Tiffany’s and bottles of bubbles,” she sings, over a bass-heavy beat. “Buy myself all of my favorite things.” The song is credited to a total of 10 writers. But two of them — Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II — control 90 percent of the songwriting royalties, a remarkable split that reflects the value of evergreen song catalogs, and of the negotiating leverage their owners have when pop stars come seeking permission. In an especially speedy turnaround, the deal for “7 Rings” was decided a few weeks before the song’s release in January, when representatives for Ms. Grande and her label, Republic, brought the completed song to Concord, the music company that has owned the Rodgers and Hammerstein catalog since 2017. Concord requested 90 percent of Ms. Grande’s song, and her representatives accepted without further negotiation. Ms. Grande’s song “wouldn’t exist in its current form were it not for ‘My Favorite Things,’” Jake Wisely, Concord’s chief publishing executive, said in an interview. The deal means that Concord stands to make millions of dollars from the song, while Ms. Grande and her seven co-writers will each get just a fraction of what Concord makes. (The songwriting royalties are separate from the earnings Ms. Grande will make as the recording artist. Through her label, she declined to comment.) Theodore S. Chapin, the executive who has managed Rodgers and Hammerstein’s copyrights for decades, said he was initially taken aback by Ms. Grande’s song. But he quickly saw its value as a reinterpretation, and as a way of keeping the original’s legacy alive among Ms. Grande’s young fans. He also thought that Mary Rodgers, Richard Rodgers’s composer daughter, who died in 2014, “would have thought this is pretty kick-ass.” Although it has long had a conservative reputation for protecting its copyrights, the Rodgers and Hammerstein Organization has a distinct history of making commercial deals. Rodgers, who died in 1979, even approved a Clairol ad that changed a famous lyric from “South Pacific”: “I’m gonna wash that gray right outa my hair.” “The fact that Rodgers had agreed to that in his lifetime,” Mr. Chapin said, “gave all of us a little license to feel that we should keep an open mind on these kinds of things.” Yet the license for “7 Rings” is especially favorable to Rodgers and Hammerstein. When Gwen Stefani used some of the yodeling “Lonely Goatherd” (also from “The Sound of Music”) for a 2006 song, “Wind It Up,” Rodgers and Hammerstein received only 50 percent of the royalties. The difference between the two deals could reflect Concord’s greater negotiating power. Or, according to Lisa Alter, a lawyer who specializes in music copyright, it could just be that “My Favorite Things” is a more precious property. “It probably implies that more of the song is being used, or how iconic the original song is,” said Ms. Alter, who was not involved with the “7 Rings” deal. And what might Rodgers and Hammerstein themselves have thought of Ms. Grande’s song? Todd S. Purdum, the author of “Something Wonderful: Rodgers and Hammerstein’s Broadway Revolution,” said the masters of musical theater enjoyed being in the thick of popular culture. But most important, he said, they were never ashamed of commercial success. “They would love the ka-ching of it,” Mr. Purdum said. "
5c489c373a125f5075c05e41,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/23/arts/music/alice-merton-mint-review.html,"Alice Merton closes her debut album, “Mint,” with “Why So Serious,” a song full of questions like “When did we get like this?” It’s a wish for a more carefree, less calculating spirit, sung by her overdubbed, call-and-response posse of female voices over a bouncing bass line. And it’s the counterbalance, in some small part, to an album that takes everything extremely seriously, from career ambitions and lovers’ quarrels to the placement of every hook. Merton has a hearty, natural voice that stays plush while echoing the power of singers like Adele and Florence Welch. It’s a voice made for larger-than-life declarations; the first lines she sings on “Mint,” in “Learn to Live,” are “They’ve got fire/Well, I’ve got lightning bolts.” In more than one song, she sings about her fears and inhibitions, even as her voice leaves no question that she will conquer them. [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] Merton, 25, was born in Germany, grew up mostly in Canada and moved back to Germany in her teens, and she has also lived in England and the United States. Now based in Berlin, she has had a dozen addresses in 24 years. She propelled her pop career in Germany with a single released in 2016, the partly autobiographical “No Roots,” a song about constant relocation that speaks, perhaps, to listeners whose connections are digital, not terrestrial. “I’ve got memories and travel like Gypsies in the night,” she exults over a 4/4 thump, a stop-start bass line and clanky rhythm-guitar chops hinting at 1980s hits by INXS. “I’ve got no roo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-oots,” Merton sings, with the kind of nonsense-syllable hook she also brings to other choruses on the album. “No Roots” reached No. 2 in Germany and was a hit elsewhere in Europe, leading to an EP and singles released over the past two years. Recorded with Merton’s songwriting collaborator and producer, Nicolas Rebscher, “Mint” gathers most of the singles alongside newer songs, and every one sets out to be a tour de force. Each verse layers on another instrument, a countermelody, an electronic effect, dabs of backup vocals. Then the choruses land squarely in place, promising forthrightness and honesty. Merton insists on her fidelity in “Funny Business,” warns that she’s going to lose her temper in “Lash Out,” demands explanations from a lover in “Speak Your Mind” and gives up on a no-show partner in “I Don’t Hold a Grudge.” Although Merton was born in the ’90s, most of her music’s reference points are from the MTV 1980s: not just INXS but Michael Jackson, Eurythmics, Heart, Duran Duran and late Queen, along with touches of house-music piano. (The non-1980s exception is the album’s dud, “Honeymoon Heartbreak,” an attempt at Lana Del Rey angst that borrows its best melodic phrase from Green Day’s “Boulevard of Broken Dreams.”) The songs on “Mint” are designed to leap out from a playlist, with Merton’s immediately appealing voice, the sounds of physical instruments and the craftsmanship that Merton and Rebscher bring to each segment of a song. But listening to the album as a whole, there are diminishing returns from the certainty that a new gimmick is coming every eight bars. Pop songs live by their hooks; it’s no wonder that Merton’s debut album piles them on, eager to please. But for the follow-up, suspense and spontaneity — even if it’s an illusion — would go a long way. "
5c6d53813a125f5075c0a96b,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/20/arts/music/breunion-boys-brexit-band.html,"LIVERPOOL, England — On a recent Saturday, the Breunion Boys — a Dutch boy band set up in response to Britain’s planned departure from the European Union — stood in a dressing room in the basement of Liverpool University doing final warm-ups for their first show in Britain. The five members stared into one another’s eyes and kicked their legs in time to orders from Flavia Faas, the band’s songwriter and dance coach. They tried not to laugh as the exercises got quicker and quicker, so much so it was silly. “This is what we came here for!” Faas shouted as the group finished. A few moments later, they took the stage at the “Rock for Europe” event. The audience in the student union hall was only about 60 people, and decades older than the crowd at a typical boy band gig. Most stood or sat at the back, looking tired after listening to hours of pro-European Union speeches. “We don’t bite,” said Joshua Alagbe, 24, one of the band’s members, encouraging people forward. “We just want to show the real love between Britain and Europe.” The group then launched into a cover of the Backstreet Boys’ “I Want It That Way.” “Ain’t nothing but a heartbreak,” they sang. “Ain’t nothing but a mistake.” In the audience, David Murtagh, 69, a part-time roadside assistance coordinator, made a face to show it wasn’t his kind of music. “But I do like their shirts,” he said later. The Breunion Boys may sound like a stunt, but the group has grabbed more attention than most activists in the bitter debate around Brexit, as Britain’s departure from the European Union is known, including in British media outlets that support the withdrawal. Since posting the clip for their debut song, “Britain Come Back,” online in December, they have appeared on daytime television and in tabloid newspapers. The video for the song has also appeared on several comedy TV shows, especially a part when Seyed Hosseini, 22, raps “look at what you leave behind” while showing his abs. (John Oliver showed it on HBO’s “Last Week Tonight” then called the band “a pretty solid argument for leaving the E.U. on any terms necessary.”) The Liverpool show was billed as the first of a British tour, although the only other stop scheduled so far is in London on March 29, the date Britain is scheduled to leave the bloc. The woman behind the group, Julia Veldman, 30, an animator from the Netherlands, said in an interview that she genuinely believed the Breunion Boys could have an impact. “I’m very sincere,” she said. “People have tried a lot of facts and arguments and they haven’t moved the debate one inch. So we can but try with emotion.” “We know this is funny,” she added. “But that’s the strength of it. There’s no light or air anywhere in the Brexit debate. Now people talk about us, and then we can say how we feel. We’re a bit like a Trojan horse.” Veldman was living in New York when she heard the result of the 2016’s Brexit referendum. “That was literally the first time I realized there were people who didn’t like the European Union, which is stupid of course,” she said. She started crying when she heard the news, she said, adding, “We’ve had peace and opportunity in Europe for so long, and I don’t want to lose that.” The idea of using a boy band to deliver her message came quickly, Veldman said. There is nothing more British than a boy band, she added, mentioning groups like Take That and One Direction. “Being vulnerable and asking someone to reconsider can be pathetic,” she said. “But when it’s young boys who can dance and sing and are hot, it’s different.” Finding guys who could do that as well as discuss the intricacies of Brexit was difficult, Veldman added. Her search lasted a year. “There’s many people with political views,” she said. “They don’t all have sex appeal.” Before the show in Liverpool, the group talked about sometimes feeling like a real boy band. They have several hard-core fans, they said, including a group of schoolgirls that regularly sends them drawings. But they also get the online abuse — including death threats and accusations they are funded by Russia or George Soros, the financier who is often villainized by many on the far right. (“I wish,” Veldman said, laughing.) But all the members insisted they are doing this because they care about Brexit. Pablo Ramos, 25, the band’s best dancer and a hotel receptionist in Amsterdam, said he had been able to move to the Netherlands from Spain only because European Union citizens have the right to live and work in any member country. “Why make a limit, a border between us?” he said. The Breunion Boys have only two original songs. (The second, “The Real Deal,” features lyrics like, “Oh, the treaties we have together / No one’s going to treat you better.”) But more songs will emerge as Brexit unfolds, Veldman said. She wants the band to sing about the potential return of a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, but is concerned about getting the right tone. At the Liverpool show, it was clear that even if the Breunion Boys cannot change the course of Brexit, their efforts were entertaining people. Within two songs, more than half the audience had moved near the stage. Most were swaying — and laughing — along. Between numbers, the band asked the audience how they felt about Brexit. A student, who said he was originally from Germany, looked as if he were about to cry when he said he feared having to leave Britain. The boys jumped down from the stage and hugged him; the audience sighed. But the biggest cheer came a few minutes later, as the group finished “Britain Come Back.” It came just after Hosseini lifted his top and pointed to his abs. "

How he’s filling at least part of that downtime? Video games. A fan of the Red Dead Redemption series, he was nudged into contributing an original song to Red Dead Redemption 2. “Unshaken” is lonely cowboy-western soul, produced by Daniel Lanois — an incantation for those with bleary eyes and unswerving defiance. JON CARAMANICA A chorus of “oohs” and “ahs” in jazzy chords, circling without resolution, accompanies the Chicago rapper Noname as she calmly zooms down her latest stream of consciousness. Syncopating her rhymes rapidly and precisely over the tricky beat, Noname touches on her success without a record label, African-American representation on TV, mass incarceration, Christmas and all the direct messages she has ignored, among other things. “I sell pain for profit, not propaganda,” she declares. Her producer, Phoelix, also shows up as a singer with an enigmatic, equally unresolved chorus. JON PARELES A fine mist of guitar-pop, “Promise” — the new solo single from Jimin, of the K-pop juggernaut BTS — runs in the opposite direction of the familiar BTS maximalism. Here he sounds tender and sweet, and the song never moves quicker than a saunter. In the broader BTS oeuvre, it’s something of an afterthought, casual and unobtrusive. But that hardly matters: It broke the SoundCloud record for most plays in a song’s first 24 hours. CARAMANICA Post Malone’s farewell to 2018 is far more exuberant than anything he released last year. “Wow.” is boastful but not melancholy — “I got a lot of toys/720S bumpin’ Fall Out Boy” — and he’s largely rapping, with only a flimsy skin of melody. After a year in which his album “Beerbongs & Bentleys” helped set the framework for pop’s full-molt evolution, this is a chipper cherry on top, unconcerned with formal innovation and blithely cheerful. CARAMANICA A lurching beat, somewhere in the vicinity of reggae, and a psychedelic-orchestral blur of instruments accompany the high, singsong vocals of Neshma Friend, who records as Micropixie. “How could we ever win the game of life/When all we ever knew was pain and strife/Every day,” she muses. She admits to the hopes that a holiday can raise, then ambles off her own way. PARELES This quartet from New York writes songs spiked with humorous asides, ska guitar and riot grrrl attitude (so it doesn’t sound anything like T. Rex, or the Marc Bolan tribute act from England that shares its name). The group started when its members were still in high school and its second album, “Prehysteria,” delivers more scrawny indie rock with an extra helping of eye roll. Over the Sleater-Kinney-ish backdrop of “Maddy’s Got a Boyfriend,” Lyris Faron nurses a wounded heart: “She leaves me crying in the sand/she said she never liked my band.” CARYN GANZ “I love you baby but my lips are turning blue,” Ursula Rose raps, deadpan, shattering the male self-pity and metronomic electro-pop that Bear Hands concocted for the rest of this track. She’s centered; the guys are a mess. PARELES It has been six years between albums for the Danish songwriter and classical composer Nanna Oland Fabricius, who made her debut album as Oh Land in 2008. “Human Error” merges her early dance-pop electronics with skeletal piano and unfurling orchestral arrangements as she sings about the difference between calculated planning and real life: “No missing digits, no real mistakes/Just human errors make human hearts break,” she realizes. PARELES Steph Richards composes in ways that standard notation could never document. To make “Brooklyn Machine,” she yanked out one of her trumpet’s valves — some air escapes where it ought to be, making the muffled, sometimes warping sound you hear in your right speaker. The tinnier tone coming from the left emerges when Richards covers the valve and air passes through the horn’s bell, like usual. The bell, in turn, is covered with a mute, helping her create the fuzzy mumble at the beginning of the track. “Brooklyn Machine” appears on “Take the Neon Lights,” her forthcoming album, but the performance in the video above — featuring abstracted urban scenes animated by Andrea Yasco — is a separate take, just under a minute and a half of haunting trumpet surgery and jostling play with her piano-bass-drums quartet. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO Paul McCartney, that Paul McCartney, uses Auto-Tune — yes, Auto-Tune — to sing about lost, lifelong love. “It was a time we were all full of hope/Saw the future burning bright,” he sings. “Do you remember?” Now it’s the future. And all you can remember is when the Beatles wouldn’t use anyone else’s sounds, and when an unprocessed voice was enough. PARELES "
5c6492ba3a125f5075c09914,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/13/arts/music/ryan-adams-women-sex.html,"For nearly two decades, Ryan Adams, one of the most prolific singer-songwriters of his generation, has been heralded as a mercurial creative genius and a respected industry tastemaker. Equal parts punk-rock folk hero and romantic troubadour, Adams, 44, has 16 albums and seven Grammy nominations to his name. He has overseen music by Willie Nelson, written a Tim McGraw hit and recorded with John Mayer. He has also taken a special interest in the trajectory of female artists, especially younger ones, championing them onstage, across social media and in the studio, where his stamp of approval can jump-start careers. [The F.B.I. has opened an inquiry into Ryan Adams’s explicit communications with an underage fan.] Some now say that Adams’s rock-star patronage masked a darker reality. In interviews, seven women and more than a dozen associates described a pattern of manipulative behavior in which Adams dangled career opportunities while simultaneously pursuing female artists for sex. In some cases, they said, he would turn domineering and vengeful, jerking away his offers of support when spurned, and subjecting women to emotional and verbal abuse, and harassment in texts and on social media. The accounts have been corroborated by family members or friends who were present at the time, as well as by correspondence from Adams reviewed by The New York Times. From a teenager living in a small town to his ex-wife, the singer and actress Mandy Moore, these artists said Adams exploited and then stifled their ambitions. “Music was a point of control for him,” Moore said. When Adams began corresponding online with a fan, Ava, in 2013, she was a 14-year-old bass player already forging a career. But their correspondence about music turned into graphic texting. Eventually, Ava said, they conducted video calls on Skype, where Adams exposed himself during phone sex. The Times has reviewed extensive communication between the two, including 3,217 text messages they exchanged over a nine-month period when Ava was 15 and 16. (The Times is identifying Ava, now 20, by her middle name because she was a minor during their online relationship. They never met in person.) In the texts, Adams questioned Ava repeatedly about her age, and sometimes she said she was older than she was. Though he did not seem convinced, their sexual conversations continued. “i would get in trouble if someone knew we talked like this,” Adams wrote to her in November 2014. [Ryan Adams’s album release has been canceled amid an F.B.I. inquiry.] Andrew B. Brettler, Adams’s lawyer, said that the singer did not recall these exchanges. “Mr. Adams unequivocally denies that he ever engaged in inappropriate online sexual communications with someone he knew was underage,” Brettler said. Through Brettler, Adams said that he did not have the power to make or break careers and categorically denied the “extremely serious and outlandish accusations” in The Times’s reporting. Adams recalled the interactions with the women differently, his lawyer said, referring to some of the allegations as “grousing by disgruntled individuals” who blamed Adams for personal or professional disappointments and were now out to harm him. After this article was published online, Adams posted a series of tweets in which he apologized “to anyone I have ever hurt, however unintentionally.” But he also continued to dispute the accuracy of the reporting. With the album “Heartbreaker” and beloved songs like “New York, New York,” Adams became a solo star in the early 2000s, even as he struggled with well-publicized addiction and mental health issues. He later gained mainstream attention with a cover of Taylor Swift’s “1989” album, released through his own Pax-Am label. Adams was an early adopter in communicating directly with listeners, responding to fans and critics on Myspace and then Twitter and Instagram. He also used social media to scout and meet artists. It was on Twitter that he found Ava, who excitedly messaged him to say hello after she followed him and he followed her back. “I was really alone,” Ava said in an interview, “and he was really friendly and cool.” She had been a gifted bassist since the age of 9. By 12, she was road-tripping with her family to Manhattan for gigs with established musicians. At home, however, Ava was isolated, home-schooled because of bullying. At 13, her father died. Adams represented the creative future she dreamed of. The star floated big ideas about her career prospects in their earliest messages, eventually suggesting that she and another teenager start a band that he could produce. Their conversations were on and off, but a constant theme was Adams fretting about Ava’s age — and asking to keep their exchanges secret — while also indulging in sexual scenarios. “I never see pics of you anymore,” Adams wrote in November 2014, when he had just turned 40 and Ava was newly 16. “You were blowing my mind.” He had pet names for her body parts. Days later, Adams expressed anxiety: “If people knew they would say I was like R Kelley lol,” he wrote. Yet within 10 minutes, the conversation again turned explicit. “I just want you to touch your nipple,” he texted, before again asking about her age. “And tell me that your mom is not gonna kill me if she finds out we even text.” In response to Adams’s repeated pleas that she tell him she was 18 — “You have to convince me,” he wrote — Ava at times said she was. Sometimes he asked to see identification — “in the hottest way that has ever been done Lol.” She never showed him any ID. Adams, through his lawyer, said that while he “has communications online with various fans and aspiring musicians,” he “does not recall having online communications with anyone related to anything outside of music.” The lawyer added that “if, in fact, this woman was underage, Mr. Adams was unaware.” He pointed to her performances in clubs and provided photos of Ava from that time, saying she looked “approximately 20.” Laws regarding explicit digital communication with a minor vary from state to state and are separate from age of consent laws, which encompass physical contact. In Ohio, where Ava lived, it is a felony to solicit, exchange or possess any material that shows a person under 18 engaging in sexual activity. New York, where Adams was during some of these exchanges, has similar laws regarding children younger than 17, and federal statutes use 18 as the age of adulthood. Several legal experts said that prosecuting such cases could involve disputes over jurisdiction and whether the adult reasonably believed the minor was of legal age, taking into account context from their conversations. Ava said that as her communication with Adams went on, she grew uneasy about their unequal dynamic. Once, she said, the two agreed to video chat, but when they connected on Skype, Adams was already naked. “It was just sexual power,” Ava said. As their relationship waned, Adams returned to the possibility of recording together. But for Ava, the idea that she would be objectified or have to sleep with people to get ahead “just totally put me off to the whole idea” of being a musician, she said. She never played another gig. The music world, in which a culture of late nights and boundary-pushing behavior has been normalized, hasn’t been as roiled by the #MeToo movement as other sectors of media and entertainment. But many in the business say that harassment and inequitable treatment of women is pervasive and that the “sex, drugs and rock ’n’ roll” ethos has shielded men from being held to account. In an industry where musicians are often the most trusted gatekeepers, Adams was more than just a singer. His Pax-Am label was connected to Capitol Music Group, a major conglomerate, and an opening slot on one of his sold-out tours could introduce an emerging artist to fans and business partners. For more than a decade, until last year, Adams was managed by John Silva, who has worked with Nirvana, Beck and St. Vincent. (Silva and Capitol, which is scheduled to release three albums by Adams this year, declined requests for comment.) Other women in music said they, too, were subjected to Adams’s intense flattery and a bait and switch in which professional opportunities would be commingled with sexual come-ons. The musician Phoebe Bridgers was 20 when Adams invited her to the Pax-Am studio one night in fall 2014. “There was a mythology around him,” she said. “It seemed like he had the power to propel people forward.” Adams had her perform a song and said he was blown away, comparing her to Bob Dylan, Bridgers recalled. Adams gave her a pricey vintage guitar, she said, and told her to return to record with him the next day. Beguiled by Adams’s energy and enthusiasm, Bridgers brought her best songs. Adams proposed putting them out as a 7-inch vinyl single on his label, setting her on a professional path. But as they discussed the record, Adams started sending Bridgers flirty texts, she said, and a whirlwind romance commenced. Bridgers said the singer began discussing marriage less than a week into their relationship, and insisted that she open for him on his European tour in a few weeks — “a golden pillar of success,” she recalled. Adams told Bridgers’s mother that it was a “once-in-a-lifetime opportunity” to have someone like him looking out for her. Yet in the weeks that followed, Adams’s attention turned obsessive and emotionally abusive, Bridgers said. He began barraging her with texts, insisting that she prove her whereabouts, or leave social situations to have phone sex, and threatening suicide if she didn’t reply immediately. When she broke off the relationship, Bridgers said, Adams became evasive about releasing the music they had recorded together and rescinded the offer to open his upcoming concerts. When three songs by Bridgers were eventually released by Pax-Am in April 2015, bringing her serious industry attention, the media gave Adams credit for her nascent career. Through his lawyer, Adams contested how Bridgers described their relationship, calling it “a brief, consensual fling,” though he did not recall any flirty texts. He never told Bridgers he would withhold her songs, he said. Bridgers said that after their breakup, Adams continued to tease opportunities while pursuing her. He offered her a few dates opening for him on tour in 2017, and after much discussion with her manager about Adams’s behavior, Bridgers said she accepted because it was a big opportunity before the release of her debut album. “Then, the first day, he asked me to bring him something in his hotel room,” she said. “I came upstairs and he was completely nude.” (Adams, through his lawyer, denied this incident.) Two additional female singer-songwriters, who declined to be identified for fear of retribution, described a similar pattern of behavior from Adams: raving about their work and offering tour spots amid aggressive romantic pursuit, followed by harassing messages and threats of professional retaliation when the relationships did not progress as he wanted. Another artist, Courtney Jaye, who was then 35 and not signed to a label, got a direct message from Adams on Twitter in 2013 with immediate offers to collaborate. “You are a psychedelic Ronstadt hybrid,” he gushed. “Come let’s make some music.” They exchanged messages about what her next album should sound like, and Adams offered to produce it, she said. But when they got together days later to work on ideas, Adams began remarking on Jaye’s appearance and moving in on her — “Hurricane Ryan,” as she described him. She said she tried to deflect his attention, and failed; having been victimized before, Jaye added, “I just shut myself off.” They wound up in bed, but didn’t have sex. Jaye felt shaken by how smoothly Adams had taken advantage of her, she said, and that night expressed her dismay to him over the phone. Adams maintained that he still wanted to collaborate, and though the pair continued to correspond for a time, they never recorded anything. Adams’s lawyer said that the singer and Jaye “never had a writing session where they ended up in bed,” and denied that the call afterward took place. Jaye said: “Something changed in me that year. It made me just not want to make music.” Even for an artist like Moore, now a star of the hit series “This Is Us,” Adams could wield his influence in damaging ways. When they met in 2007, she was 23, he a decade older. Professionally, Moore was at a turning point: She was exiting her teen-pop years, and his reputation as a sensitive, authentic voice provided the artistic credibility she craved. In 2010, Adams offered to work on her next album; when she parted ways with her music manager, Adams discouraged her from working with other producers or managers, she said, effectively leaving him in charge of her music career. They wrote songs together regularly that Adams promised to record, but never did. He booked them time at his studio, only to replace her with other female artists, she said. And he lashed out in ways that Moore came to consider psychologically abusive. Adams lorded his artistic accomplishments over her, she said. “He would always tell me, ‘You’re not a real musician, because you don’t play an instrument.’” Through his lawyer, Adams called Moore’s characterization of their time together “completely inconsistent with his view of the relationship,” adding that he was supportive of her “well-deserved professional success.” The lawyer said Adams had been happy to help her career and had not prevented her from working with others. She released her sixth LP, completed before their marriage, shortly after they wed in 2009, and has released no albums since. “His controlling behavior essentially did block my ability to make new connections in the industry during a very pivotal and potentially lucrative time — my entire mid-to-late 20s,” she said. Their divorce was finalized in 2016. Megan Butterworth, Adams’s ex-fiancée, also described him as a controlling and emotionally abusive partner, who later targeted her with digital harassment. During their relationship, he isolated her socially and professionally, she said, trying to dictate who she saw or worked with. And he could turn rageful, smashing things and physically intimidating her, she said, though he never hit her. When she left him in 2018, Butterworth said, he inundated her with hundreds of text messages, phone calls and emails, oscillating between emotional pleas and vitriol, and also threatened suicide and lawsuits. The Times has reviewed dozens of these messages. (Adams, through his lawyer, disputed Butterworth’s account of his behavior as controlling, abusive, or physically intimidating.) Adams also posted images of Butterworth to his Instagram account, tagging her friends and even a family member: “Get it while it’s hot folks,” one read. “[Butterworth] IS SINGLE.” Only recently did the women discover that their experiences overlapped. And in the last few months, Moore and several others who said they were scarred by their relationships with Adams have found one another, creating a support system. “What you experience with him — the treatment, the destructive, manic sort of back and forth behavior — feels so exclusive,” Moore said. “You feel like there’s no way other people have been treated like this.” Realizing they were not alone, the women chose to speak out about their experiences in the hopes of protecting others and moving forward, they said. “I want to make music,” Moore said. “I’m not going to let Ryan stop me.” "
5c7d550249f0eacbf105b421,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/04/arts/music/morrissey-broadway-residency.html,"Morrissey, the celebrated British singer who once fronted the Smiths, is coming to Broadway. He will play a seven-night engagement at the Lunt-Fontanne Theater from May 2-11, becoming the latest high-profile musician to take the Broadway stage since Bruce Springsteen last year. According to a news release on Monday, the shows will serve as a career retrospective for Morrissey, and will come weeks before the release of a new record, “California Son,” an album of covers. Broadway stages have become increasingly friendly to pop music, particularly jukebox musicals featuring songs with already built-in popularity. Cher, Donna Summer, the Go-Go’s and Jimmy Buffett are just some recent examples of artists whose music has been featured recently on Broadway. “Ain’t Too Proud: The Life and Times of the Temptations” will officially open later this month. “Springsteen on Broadway,” a show mixing songs and storytelling, earned an honorary Tony Award and was filmed for a Netflix special. Tickets for the Morrissey shows will go on sale Friday, and many fans will have two hopes: that they will be able to get seats, and that the performances actually happen. The singer has had a penchant for canceling shows on short notice; in late 2017, the music site Consequence of Sound counted more than 120 that he had scrapped or postponed since 2012. (In one particularly infamous example, Morrissey canceled a 2017 performance in Paso Robles, Calif., because it was too cold.) Last year, Morrissey, 59 — whose real name is Steven Patrick Morrissey — postponed European tour dates following inflammatory comments he made in an interview posted on his own website. Multiple quotes from the interview were thought too Islamophobic, including: “Halal slaughter requires certification that can only be given by supporters of ISIS,” and “This is the Mayor of London! And he cannot talk properly!” referring to Sadiq Khan, the city’s first Muslim mayor. Morrissey’s team said at the time that the tour was canceled for “logistical reasons,” but anti-racism protests were being planned to coincide with the singer’s shows in Manchester, where he is from. He has expressed support for right-wing figures in Britain such as Tommy Robinson, the founder of the English Defense League. "

There’s an amazing little wooden tiger in the American Folk Art Museum’s teaching collection. Made around 1980 in Oaxaca by Manuel Jimenez, the piece is at once so simply shaped and so brightly painted that it comes across less as a depiction of any specific animal than as a vivid realization of the very idea of tigerness.  Starting Jan. 16, you’ll be able to visit it, along with a spotted pig, a yellow fox and a green dog, in the lobby of the Citigroup Building in Long Island City as part of “A Kingdom in Pieces,” where they’ll be keeping company with contemporary animal-focused paintings by artists associated with the nearby Fountain House Gallery. WILL HEINRICH January 17 and 18; bowerypresents.com. There’s a comforting nostalgia to much of the music by Japanese Breakfast, the solo project of the singer-songwriter Michelle Zauner. Her polished sophomore album, “Soft Sounds From Another Planet,” is a lush, sweet take on ’90s shoegaze and dream pop, with hazy layers of reverb-heavy guitar and synths that give her music an organic-sounding richness. But her retro aesthetic sounds fresh, in part thanks to its sharp songwriting and focus on contemporary anxieties. The soothing vibe belies the familiar existential dread in the poetic lyrics. “All of our celebrities keep dying/While the cruel men continue to win,” Zauner sings in “Till Death,” a song she has said is about love. The music, which can be heard live during Zauner’s two-night run at Brooklyn Steel, rewards those who pay close attention. Even her artist name is a way to distinguish who’s a true fan and who’s just along for the ride: She’s Korean-American, not Japanese, and has made her relationship with her identity an important part of her work. As she told Teen Vogue last year, “I think that right now there are a lot of young kids that are pushing marginalized voices to the front, and I think I feel kind of a part of that.” NATALIE WEINER Through Jan. 20, labtheater.org. There are new works, and then there are scripts so fresh from the playwright’s fingertips that they reach the stage with no time for rehearsal. That’s what happened last year at Labyrinth Theater Company’s Barn Series, a festival of new-play readings, the night that the Pulitzer Prize winner Stephen Adly Guirgis presented some fragments of a work in progress. In the minutes before the reading, from his adaptation of the movie “Dog Day Afternoon,” Guirgis stood onstage with a dozen actors, quietly explaining to each of them who they were playing and the circumstances of their scenes. The resulting performance was exhilarating — huge energy packed into the tiny studio space at the Cherry Lane Theater in Greenwich Village, where the free festival is back this week. Elizabeth Canavan’s “Ladies in Waiting,” Brett C. Leonard‘s “Papo” and Mariana Carreño King’s “The Red Gene” are among the plays in this year’s series, which wraps up Jan. 20 with three Guirgis works. One of the plays will get a full Labyrinth production this summer. LAURA COLLINS-HUGHES Through Jan. 20; joyce.org. In the winter, live dance warms you up. The Joyce Theater provides some necessary heat with its Cuba Festival 2019, which features two returning groups. Malpaso Dance Company (through Jan. 13) presents works by Ohad Naharin, Merce Cunningham and up-and-coming Cuban choreographers, while Compañía Irene Rodríguez (Jan. 18-20) offers “Mas Que Flamenco,” a program of short pieces.  Wedged in between is the United States debut of the intriguingly named contemporary company Los Hijos del Director, or The Children of the Director (Jan. 15-16). In “The Last Resource,” choreographed by George Céspedes, who formed the troupe in Havana in 2013, dancers explore the obstacles that Cubans face. Alienation, uncertainty, change — it’s starting to sound all too familiar, in or out of Cuba. But this work, with music ranging from heavy metal and electronica to pieces by Cuban singer-songwriters, promises to be anything but. GIA KOURLAS Jan. 13 and 20; pbs.org. Charles and Diana. William and Kate. Harry and Meghan. But without Victoria and Albert, that phenomenon forever after known as the royal wedding might not exist. In “Victoria & Albert: The Wedding,” airing on Sundays, Jan. 13 and 20, on PBS (check local listings), the British historian Lucy Worsley breathlessly details the first cousins’ path to the altar: the conspiracy to marry them from their births and their fizzled introduction on her 17th birthday (he was plump and had dreadful diarrhea; she liked her gift of a parrot more). Then came their second meeting, when Albert, by then a frog transformed, ignited in the young queen a sensation of “pure, beautiful, gobsmacking love,” as one expert puts it. Get that girl her fan. Worsley then reimagines their 1840 nuptials, devised as the P.R. coup of the century — the better to herald the modern constitutional monarchy — down to Victoria’s white wedding dress, which popularized the color for brides, and a breakfast feast resplendent with skinned hares, taxidermied pigeons (adorning pigeon pies) and a 300-pound fruitcake. The pomp and passion continues as Season 3 of “Victoria,” also starting Jan. 13, finds revolution sweeping across Europe — and the plucky monarch (Jenna Coleman) confronting a crisis that could end her reign. KATHRYN SHATTUCK Jan. 16; filmforum.com. Chela (Ana Brun) and Chiquita (Margarita Irún), the descendants of wealthy families in Asunción, Paraguay, have been partners for 30 years. But in the first frames of “The Heiresses” — opening Jan. 16 at the Film Forum and coming to theaters in other major cities — strangers rifle through their once-opulent apartment as the couple sell off cherished belongings now that their money has run out. So, apparently, has their luck: Chiquita has been accused of fraud and sent to prison, leaving Chela mired in loneliness and encroaching poverty. When a gossipy older neighbor (María Martins) asks Chela for a lift to her card game, she reluctantly begins a sort of taxi service, finding an unfamiliar freedom behind the wheel of her vintage Mercedes. Then Angy (Ana Ivanova) — younger, brash, sexy — climbs into the passenger seat. And something in Chela stirs. Brun, in a fine debut, won the Silver Bear for best actress at the 2018 Berlin Film Festival. And the director Marcelo Martinessi, who says he was inspired by the romance between Paraguay’s petite bourgeoisie and authoritarian regimes, captured the Alfred Bauer Prize for a feature “that opens new perspectives.” KATHRYN SHATTUCK Jan. 16-17; metmuseum.org. The soprano Julia Bullock is in the midst of a hotly anticipated and now widely celebrated five-event residency at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where she has already performed traditional slave songs, settings of poetry by Langston Hughes, a new version of John Adams’s oratorio “El Niño,” and a bevy of other contemporary works.  On Wednesday and Thursday at the Met, she will inhabit the part of Josephine Baker in composer Tyshawn Sorey’s “Perle Noire: Meditations for Joséphine.” Described by The New York Times upon its 2016 debut as “one of the most important works of art yet to emerge from the era of Black Lives Matter,” the work melancholically reimagines songs by this complex icon, with texts by the poet Claudia Rankine. It has continued to evolve in performances by Bullock and the International Contemporary Ensemble, and remains powerfully relevant. As Sorey told The Times, “The lyrical content is timeless, and I wanted to create something musically to reflect what we’re experiencing now.” WILLIAM ROBIN "
5c3639c23a125f5075c0393d,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/09/arts/music/alex-lilly-2-percent-milk-review.html,"Through heartache, rejection, workplace harassment and pervasive disillusionment, Alex Lilly’s songs keep their cool on her debut album, “2% Milk.” Her voice is supple and relaxed; she often sounds like a smile is tugging at the corners of her mouth. And she brings a wry, analytical skepticism even to matters of the heart. In “Boomerang,” about giving an ex another chance, she sings, “I’ve tried to find someone new/Believe me though it’s hard to, they’re all worse than you.” Lilly, who is based in Los Angeles, has been writing songs while working as a keyboardist and backup singer on tour with Beck, Lorde and others, including a longtime spot in the suavely devious pop band the Bird and the Bee; “2% Milk” arrives on the label founded by Inara George, who leads the Bird and the Bee with the producer Greg Kurstin. And like the Bird and the Bee, Lilly delivers structural and emotional complexity with deceptive nonchalance. Lilly’s songs are full of musicianly gamesmanship. They’re synth-pop built around a decidedly human protagonist; they use hopscotching melody lines, shifty meters, subtly intricate counterpoint and spongy, unconventional synthesizer tones. But Lilly isn’t just showing off. Her convolutions also tell stories. In “Distracting Me,” she breaks away from workaholic concentration to realize, gratefully, “I love it when you are distracting me.” For that one line, she adds a beat, cheerfully disrupting her 4/4 routine. The album’s title song, with some lyrics by the poet Jacqueline Suskin, treats “2% Milk” as a symbol of a diminished life. “All that was rich/All that was whole/Used to be mine,” Lilly sings in an angular melody, while the beat lurches and cello-like countermelodies tug her further into malaise. “Cold Snap” turns post-breakup despair into an almost perverse triumph. The chords in the verses descend from undulating serenity into dissonance, but then the chorus swells as it proclaims, “Spring has come so I’m told/But I’ve become permanently cold.” “Pornographic Mind” — about a co-worker who’s all too eager to misread friendly conversation — observes, “There’s a delicate balance between work and play.” It begins with Lilly repeating “porno-pornographic” in a cascade of vocal harmonies suggesting Philip Glass, at once pretty and mathematical. That leads to a verse with melting synthesizer chords and a fidgety bass line: a sonic equivalent of the murky area between chatting and creepiness. Eventually, she decides, “All I know is, I don’t need this,” and, more luckily than some women, she makes her escape. Lilly is proud to overthink things. She stress-tests a relationship in “Hypothetical,” positing, “Let’s say we broke up today” and later explaining, “I like a love that doubts itself” and “I trust the heart that’s clinical.” Meanwhile, however, the underlying beat hints at girl-group romance. And subtly but surely throughout the album, Lilly makes clear that cool doesn’t mean cold. She’s thinking and composing her way through disappointment, loneliness and uncertainty. In the stately, shimmery closing song, “Firefly,” she mourns a romance that didn’t happen: “Almost a miracle, but it all came undone.” The smile in her voice isn’t oblivious or naïve; it’s a matter of will.

5c2fc6a13a125f5075c02e6d,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/arts/music/britney-spears-cancels-vegas-residency.html,"The veteran pop singer Britney Spears announced “an indefinite work hiatus” on Friday, canceling her new Las Vegas residency, “Britney: Domination,” that was set to run at the Park MGM resort beginning in February. “I don’t even know where to start with this, because this is so tough for me to say,” Spears, 37, wrote on social media. “I will not be performing my new show Domination.” She cited the health of her father, Jamie Spears, who she said “almost died” two months ago. Representatives for Spears said her father’s colon spontaneously ruptured, causing him to spend 28 days in the hospital. “We’re all so grateful that he came out of it alive, but he still has a long road ahead of him,” the singer wrote. “We have a very special relationship and I want to be with my family at this time just like they have always been there for me.” Jamie Spears has played an outsize role in his daughter’s music and merchandising career since 2008, after she suffered an infamous and prolonged public breakdown. Since then, her father and a lawyer, Andrew Wallet, have overseen Spears’s life and finances via a court-approved conservatorship, known sometimes as a guardianship, designed for people who cannot take care of themselves — typically the old, the infirm and the mentally disabled. (Though much of Spears’s arrangement is kept private in a Los Angeles probate court because of her fame, filings have cited an undisclosed mental illness and substance abuse as the reasons for the decade-long conservatorship.) Spears, one of the best-selling artists of all time, last released an album, “Glory,” in 2016. Though she has also toured and appeared on television since the conservatorship took effect, Spears’s primary project in recent years has been a tightly controlled, greatest hits Las Vegas residency. Beginning in 2013, “Britney: Piece of Me” ran for four years at the Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino, grossing a reported $138 million across nearly 250 shows. Traditionally the domain of performers in the twilight of their careers, Vegas residencies have become a more common revenue source for pop acts since the success of shows by Spears and Celine Dion, with similar productions in recent years from Jennifer Lopez, Gwen Stefani and the Backstreet Boys. Lady Gaga’s “Enigma” residency will run at the Park MGM throughout this year. Representatives for Spears said “Domination” was “on hold until further notice,” but added that Jamie Spears was expected to make a full recovery. In October, Wallet, the lawyer and co-conservator, cited the expected success of the new Vegas show as he requested his fee for overseeing Spears’s business be raised to $426,000 a year. He said in court filings that the singer’s estate, which had been “nearly out of funds,” had raised its worth to at least $20 million since 2014, because of the singer’s “increased well being and her capacity to be engaged.” He added, “The next several years promise to be very lucrative.” "
5c3008a03a125f5075c02ef0,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/obituaries/pegi-young-dead.html,"Pegi Young, a late-blossoming folk-rock musician who was a founder of a school for children with severe physical and speech impairments, like her son from her marriage to the singer-songwriter Neil Young, a performer at its many star-studded benefit concerts, died on Tuesday in Mountain View, Calif. She was 66. Her brother Paul Morton said the cause was cancer. By the early 1980s, Ms. Young had grown frustrated with the special education programs available for her son, Ben, who was born with cerebral palsy in 1978. She began thinking about starting a school to better address his needs and those of other children who had largely lost the ability to speak. That inspiration led in 1987 to the Bridge School, an innovative institution in Hillsborough, Calif., that has since achieved global reach. Ms. Young founded it with the speech and language pathologist Marilyn Buzolich and Jim Forderer, who had adopted many special-needs children. At the school, about 17 miles south of San Francisco, children from ages 3 to 12 use augmentative and alternative communication techniques, including speech generators and manual communication boards, to help them articulate their thoughts and prepare to complete their educations in their local school districts. Vicki R. Casella, the executive director, said in a telephone interview that Ms. Young had a “determination to ensure that children like Ben have the opportunity to become active participants in their communities.” Dr. Buzolich added that Ms. Young’s experience as the parent of a child with special needs had been critical to the school. “Professionals often diss parental input, but the parent sees the whole child,” Dr. Buzolich said by telephone. “You can imagine the parents at the Bridge School saying to themselves, ‘She understands me, she knows what it’s like, she’s been there.’ ” The school runs an international teacher training program; implements its curriculum in developing countries; organizes conferences; and conducts research to measure the effectiveness of its educational strategies. “I take a tremendous amount of satisfaction with the knowledge that we’re changing lives for the better,” Ms. Young said in 2017 in an interview with AXS, a ticketing website. “It’s truly having a global impact.” The annual benefit concerts have been the source of much of the school’s funding. Over three decades, headliners have included Mr. Young, Bruce Springsteen, David Bowie, Emmylou Harris, Pearl Jam, the Who, Lucinda Williams and Metallica. The last concert was in 2016. Margaret Mary Morton was born on Dec. 1, 1952, in San Mateo, Calif. Her father, Thomas, was an investment manager. Her mother, Margaret Jean (Foley) Morton, was a homemaker and a hospital auxiliary volunteer. Pegi wrote poetry in high school and played guitar for pleasure, but she did not consider a career in music. She attended community colleges in Northern California but did not graduate. When she met Mr. Young, in 1974, she was working as a waitress near his ranch and living in a tepee with her dog. In his 1992 song “Unknown Legend,”  Mr. Young sang, “She used to work in a diner / Never saw a woman look finer / I used to order just to watch her float across the floor.” They married in 1978. She occasionally sang backup for Mr. Young, most notably at the 1994 Academy Awards telecast, when he sang his Oscar-nominated song, “Philadelphia.” But it was not until she was in her 50s that she recorded her first album, “Pegi Young” (2007). She followed it with four more. The most recent, “Raw” (2017) — credited, like the previous two, to Pegi Young and the Survivors — was in response to her divorce from Mr. Young in 2014. He had begun a relationship with the actress Daryl Hannah, and they married last year. In one song, “Why,” Ms. Young sings: “Why’d you have to ruin my life? Why’d you have to be so mean? Why’d you have to tell me such lies? Why not be straight with me?” After the album’s release, Ms. Young said on NPR that she hoped the songs could help people get through difficult life passages. “It could be, you know, late-in-life divorce,” she said. “It could be death.” She added, “Loss and heartbreak are pretty universal.” In his review of “Raw” in Glide magazine, Lee Zimmerman wrote, “With songwriting assistance from guitarist Kelvin Holly and Spooner Oldham, Young creates a stunning story line, one that taps into feelings that are both bitter and unbridled.” In addition to her son and her brother Paul, Ms. Young is survived by her daughter, Amber Jean Young; her stepson, Zeke Young; two grandchildren; her sisters, Sally Morton and Judith Davidson; two other brothers, Michael and Brian Morton; her stepsister, Mary Ann Wolkomir; and her stepbrother, Kevin Kleczka. Although she had found her way in music, Ms. Young nonetheless viewed the Bridge School as her life’s work. “Three or four of our students now have graduated from college,” she told Speakers in Code, a music website, in 2016, “and I’ve been to every one of their graduations with huge pride of a mother hen for seeing the success that these students have enjoyed — that once they have left Bridge, there is continuum of success.” Ben Young became a successful organic egg farmer. “You know when you buy eggs in a grocery store, and even when you buy them from a good organic source, you notice the yolks are kind of pale?” she said with pride. “Ben’s eggs are nuclear orange.” "
5c76b45e49f0eacbf105a73d,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/27/opinion/grateful-dead-dark-star-anniversary.html,"It was a slow winter day, and I had just left the Anthology Film Archives in New York after a screening of “Andy Warhol’s Frankenstein.” It had seemed like a long afternoon, what with the beheadings and the orgies and whatnot. Curiously, Baron von Frankenstein insisted on calling his creature’s nose its “nasum.” Also, he observed that “in order to know death, you have to” — let’s paraphrase here — “know life in the gallbladder.”  I stood there on Second Avenue, more than a little discombobulated. And then, from an open window, I heard Jerry Garcia singing, like the voice of an old friend. “Dry your eyes on the wind,” he sang. Garcia’s mother took him to see “Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein” when he was 6 years old, he once said in an interview. “My father had just died the previous year. That was my first sense that there are things in this world that are really weird, and there are people who are concerned with them. I think that sounds like fun.” It was fun. And it was 50 years ago today — Feb. 27, 1969 — that Garcia and the Grateful Dead stood onstage at the Fillmore West and recorded the live version of “Dark Star,” a song that is still about as fun, and as weird, as American rock ’n’ roll can be. Lou Reed, the heart of Andy Warhol’s house band, the Velvet Underground, didn’t have much patience for the Dead. “All those people are the most untalented bores that ever lived,” he said of the San Francisco scene. “It’s a joke.” But the Velvets and the Dead had a lot in common, and by this I mean more than the fact that they were both originally called The Warlocks. Both liked to stretch tunes out into long improvisations; both had band members (John Cale and Phil Lesh, respectively) with roots in avant-garde music. Cale described the Velvets’ music this way: “It was an attempt to control the unconscious with the hypnotic.” Who else does that sound like? [For a track list of Jennifer Finney Boylan’s favorite performances of the Grateful Dead’s “Dark Star,” scroll to the bottom.] “Dark Star,” the Dead’s most hypnotic tune, began with the band rehearsing at the Rio Nido in Sonoma County in the summer of 1967. Listening to the music from the next room, the poet Robert Hunter wrote down its first verse: “Dark star crashes, pouring its light into ashes. Reason tatters, the forces tear loose from the axis. Searchlight casting for faults in the clouds of delusion.” And then, the Prufrockian chorus: “Shall we go? You and I while we can, through the transitive nightfall of diamonds.” After the lyric, in most performances, the song turns catty-wompus. There is ambient warping and woofing. There is electronic weeping. Sometimes this part of the tune gives way to something else — jazz riffs, dance music, cowboy songs, the ballad “St. Stephen.” You never know what you’ll get. It’s that uncertainty that I’ve always loved best in the composition, its sense of infinite possibility. Of the nearly 250 times the band played the song live, no two versions are the same. But it’s more than the tune that keeps changing. Usually, the thing that has changed between each listening is me. I heard it as a young hippie thing sitting in a friend’s bedroom in Merion, Pa. I heard it the night my daughter was born, in Maine. I listened to it this summer as my wife and I, celebrating 30 years of marriage, hiked the Cinque Terre in Italy. There are versions of it in which the audience is clapping along, like it’s a dance tune. There are versions of it that sound a lot like a half-hour of musique concrete, or as my mother described it, “like someone left the vacuum cleaner on.” Some nights the band did only the first verse, and things devolved from there. This happened during the very last performance of the song, in fact — on March 30, 1994, in Atlanta. Now and again I imagine a world in which Jerry Garcia is alive once more, and the band comes together, to finish what they started that night, and we are all young again. But Jerry Garcia is gone, of course, as is Andy Warhol, as is Lou Reed, and the world in which they created art has been largely eclipsed by commerce. At the gift shop of the Warhol show at the Whitney right now you can buy a set of Warhol-themed skateboards for $1,750. But we still have “Dark Star,” in all its beautiful, terrifying weirdness. Bob Dylan once described folk music this way: “It’s the only music where it isn’t simple. It’s weird, full of legend, myth, Bible and ghosts, chaos, watermelons, clocks, everything. “ If you haven’t listened to the tune for a long time — or if you’ve never heard it — the 50th anniversary today is a good excuse. There are a lot of strange things to uncover in “Dark Star”; ghosts and chaos and watermelons and clocks may be the least of them. As Warhol’s Frankenstein observed, there are a lot of ways to know life. Music is one of them. Turn and face the strange. It’s fun. Twelve Classic Performances of “Dark Star” by the Grateful Dead Before checking out these 12 performances, it’s worth reading Robert Hunter’s lyrics here; this version includes the final coda, never performed live. He composed the first verse lying on his bed, listening to the band in a rehearsal space nearby.  “I don’t have any idea what the ‘transitive nightfall of diamonds’ means,” he wrote. “It sounded good at the time. It brings up something you can see.” The chorus echoes T.S. Eliot’s “Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock.”  Several weeks later, Garcia requested a second verse. As he wrote it in Golden Gate Park, a stranger passed by. “In case anything ever comes of it,” Hunter told him, “this is called ‘Dark Star.’” I asked David Lemieux, the band’s official archivist, how he would describe the significance of the song within the band’s catalog. “It’s a song with endless possibilities,” he said, “and in true Dead fashion, they explored every possibility the ‘Dark Star’ musical landscape allowed. Although there are consensus ‘best versions,’ every single performance is worth exploring.” Here are 12 classic performances, starting with the best known version, performed 50 years ago today. The next three versions were selected by Mr. Lemieux, the rest by me. 1. Fillmore West, San Francisco, Feb. 27, 1969. From the 1969 “Live Dead” album. On the original vinyl, “Dark Star” jammed into “St. Stephen,” and “The Eleven” and “Turn On Your Lovelight.” The live version of the song that began this sequence, “Mountains of the Moon,” was not released until the full four-night run of the Fillmore shows was made available in 2005. Running time: 23:17. 2. Fillmore East, New York City, Feb. 13, 1970. Mr. Lemieux: “This was the first version of ‘Dark Star’ I heard after ‘Live/Dead,’ the highlight of the first box of cassettes I received in 1984. Its melodic upbeat coda is in stark contrast to the primal, psychedelic, orchestrated chaos of 2/27/69 and shows where the Dead were heading. In the age of the Grateful Dead’s foray into Americana, ‘Dark Star’ from 2/13/70 demonstrated that they were still able to pull off improvised, psychedelic/melodic bliss.” Running time: 29:42. 3. Veneta, Ore., Aug. 27, 1972. “On a hot, sunny day near Eugene, Ore., playing in a field to their tribe, the Dead played a ‘Dark Star’ that is about as dynamic as they ever got with this song in this era,” Mr. Lemieux said. “From the smoothness of the opening section of the song to the meltdown, drum-and-bass duet, and its rising-from-the-ashes triumphant return to light, this ‘Dark Star’ is one of the most deep and joyous journeys the Dead ever took.” Running time: 31:40. 4. The Spectrum, Philadelphia, Penn., Sept. 21, 1972. “Similar in structure to 4/8/72, this ‘Dark Star’ has it all, from the psychedelic depths of its earlier incarnations to the jazz-inflected introspective moments, to an ending that is all bouncing and smiles,” Mr. Lemieux said. “It’s versions like this that make me think the band must have even surprised themselves. This is not composed music, but rather improvisation that is as structured as though they’d played this closing a hundred times.” Running time: 37:08. 5. The Family Dog at the Great Highway, San Francisco, Calif., Nov. 2, 1969. Nine months after the “Live Dead” version, the song has become quieter and more reflective. Organist Tom Constanten, known as T.C., is particularly inventive this night; note how he takes the song in a curious direction at about 6:45. Running time: 30:16 6. Fillmore East, New York City, Sept. 19, 1970. This recording begins mournfully. It was the day after the death of Jimi Hendrix. Mid-song, however, things change. Running time: 25:23. 7. Capitol Theatre, Port Chester, N.Y., Feb. 18, 1971. The Dead played a number of legendary shows at this venue; this one jams into the song “Wharf Rat” before evolving again into something later simply described as the “Beautiful Jam.” Running time: 21:42. 8. Wembley Empire Pool, London, April 8, 1972. The band’s spring 1972 tour of Europe was a triumph. This version of the song features the delicate piano of the keyboardist Keith Godchaux. Running time 32:09. 9. Miami Arena, Miami, Oct. 26, 1989. Brent Mydland joined the band as keyboardist in 1979 and gave the Dead a jolt of new energy. This “Dark Star” captures that version of the band, and of the song. Running time: 26:40. 10. Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum, Oakland, Calif., Oct. 31, 1991. The band performed on Halloween, in the wake of the death of their friend, the concert promoter Bill Graham. On that occasion, they were joined onstage by the author Ken Kesey, who was himself in mourning over the loss of his son. Midway into the tune, Kesey reads the e e cummings poem “Buffalo Bill’s Defunct.” Running time: 11:06. 11. The Omni, Atlanta, March 30, 1994. The last performance. Garcia sings only the first of the two verses, leaving the song forever unfinished. The weariness in his voice is heartbreaking. Garcia would die of a heart attack 17 months later, on Aug. 9, 1995. Running time: 10:29. 12. No compendium of “Dark Star”s is complete without a version of the original “single” of the song, from 1968. Garcia considered this short version a flop. It’s historically interesting for the banjo riff at the very end, along with the only recording of the lyricist Robert Hunter’s voice on a Grateful Dead record, performing what he called a “word salad” in the final seconds.

5c9bb20049f0eacbf105f59d,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/27/arts/music/marie-ulven-girl-in-red.html,"OSLO — One evening in December, Marie Ulven was riding a tram through Oslo, remarking on just how unremarkable she hoped her music might someday be. “We need queer art to make it normal,” she said. “We need protagonists who are just, like, living their best life and gay — that’s just part of their character.” For the last couple of years, Ulven, 20, has made spiky, emotionally tactile indie-pop songs about the panting urgency of new love, and the sharp pain of when it’s unachievable, under the name girl in red. In short order, she’s emerged as one of the most astute and exciting singer-songwriters working in the world of guitar music, with a laserlike melodic instinct that verges on the primal and lyrics that capture the sweat of real life. “Some people are just like ‘How did you dare to do this?’” Ulven said of the fact that she’s singing about women. “And it’s like, I’m just out here being a [expletive] normal human being, falling in love and writing a song about it, just like that other straight girl writing a song about love.” In the last year, girl in red’s music has bubbled up from sporadic uploads on SoundCloud and Bandcamp into a growing phenomenon; Ulven has more than a million monthly listeners on Spotify despite having only 10 songs posted there. She’s opened for the bedroom electro-pop singer Clairo in Europe and is currently on her first American tour, warming up crowds for Conan Gray, a 20-year-old esoteric pop singer who has over a million subscribers on YouTube and is signed to Republic, a division of Universal. (They play this week in New York, at Bowery Ballroom on Wednesday and Music Hall of Williamsburg on Thursday.) On May 14, she’ll return as a headliner for a sold-out show at Baby’s All Right. In part, she said, that rapid success has been aided by a more welcoming pop music climate for gay artists, a radical shift in recent years that has seen the ascent of mainstream stars like Sam Smith, longtime gay performers like Tegan and Sara, and rising artists like Troye Sivan, Hayley Kiyoko and King Princess, among many others. (“#20gayteen is real,” Ulven said, referring to Kiyoko’s term for last year’s cultural moment.) But also, Ulven’s songs are sinisterly effective, with echoes of the D.I.Y. punk of the last few years, crisp Scandinavian pop and dry early 1990s shoegaze. “I Wanna Be Your Girlfriend” pulses with desperation: “I don’t wanna be your friend, I wanna kiss your lips/I wanna kiss you ’til I lose my breath.” “Girls” and “Watch You Sleep” are ethereally sweet, and “Say Anything” posits her as a romantic antihero: “You’ll be the good girl/I’ll be the guy to change your mind.” Growing up about 50 miles south of Oslo, in Horten, where her father was a police officer and her mother worked in technology, Ulven, who’s naturally boisterous and exuberant, “suppressed my feelings for a really long time,” she said. “I used to have dreams about girls, wake up and be super guilty.” Moreover, she didn’t see herself reflected in the art of the time: “I didn’t have a me back then.” “The dream scenario is that you don’t have to come out and that coming out, that’s just an outdated word,” she said. “The fact that we still say that we have to come out of something means that we can’t live as something from Day 1, just like a straight person.” Last summer, she relocated from Horten to Oslo, moving in with her sister in a fourth-floor walk-up in the artsy Grunerlokka district and attending Westerdals, a college where she studied music production and songwriting. But her career soon outpaced her schoolwork. In December, she’d just completed her first semester (with a paper on the era-defining Swedish songwriter and producer Max Martin) and was spending a day perusing thrift stores — “I don’t know why but I always like grandpa stuff” — and upgrading her personal technology. At the cellphone store, she was recognized by the salesman, who’d seen her perform on Norwegian television when she won Urort, a national juried music competition. (Though when Ulven first made music, it was in Norwegian, she now sings in English.) Throughout 2018 and the early part of this year, Ulven released a handful of songs on her own, without a label. She eventually gathered the best of them on an EP, “Chapter 1,” and she expects to do something similar, a “Chapter 2,” this year before committing to a full-length album. “Let’s see what girl in red is,” she said. “Let’s see what we have here.” Indeed, the project is evolving in real time. Her earliest songs were punchy and urgent, but some more recent ones, like “Watch You Sleep,” have an elegiac, dreamlike quality. She produces her own songs, and films and edits her own videos, and recently bought herself both a cello and an OP-1 synthesizer/sampler, which she’s planning on teaching herself to play. At times, her songs change midway — she arrived at the melody for “Girls” while working on a different song, about an accident her father suffered a few years ago: “Someone I love died today/When he came back home he was not the same.” But a bright melody kept forcing its way to the front, and Ulven grabbed it and remade it as a proud anthem for loudly claiming who you love. It’s that directness that has earned her particularly fervent fans, many of whom are looking to Ulven for guidance and understanding. The night before the interview, she’d spent an hour or so on Instagram Live, eating guacamole and talking with several fans: “I appreciate you appreciating me appreciating you guys!” Their reactions ranged from ecstatic cool to speechless awe. Ulven is in several group chats with her fans, with names like “Girls in Red” and “Your Children” — she pops in frequently, encouraging them but also answering silly questions. “I can’t help everyone come out — I’m not some gay sensei who can help everyone out,” she said. “But, to an extent, I feel like some of them are my responsibility.” Being direct about her feelings in her songs has been crucial for her but also sets an example that Ulven herself didn’t have when she was younger. “Even though I can’t be there for everyone as, like, a shrink,” she said, “the music can be.” "
5c87f35a49f0eacbf105cac2,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/12/arts/music/maren-morris-girl-review.html,"In 2016, Maren Morris broke all the country music rules. Her major label debut album, “Hero,” was a vivid indictment of country’s dull masculinist norms — it had wit, creativity, punch and ambition. And as you might expect with all things Nashville, it made Morris … moderately successful. Country music has been clogged with dullish gentlemen for the last few years, and while Morris recorded some of the genre’s most promising music, some good it did her. She had a handful of hits — the cheeky “Rich,” the desperate “I Could Use a Love Song,” the howling “My Church” — that tartly underscored just how ideologically robust the rest of the genre wasn’t. It took sidestepping country altogether for Morris to get something like her due. “The Middle,” her 2018 chunky electro-pop stomper with Zedd and Grey, became the biggest Maren Morris hit — No. 5 on the Hot 100, and Grammy nominated — but also the one least specific to her talents. [See how Zedd, Maren Morris and a 23-year-old songwriter turned a few chords into “The Middle.”] Perhaps the vagueness that oozes throughout her scattershot new album, “Girl,” is attributable to that success. The best songs on “Hero” were disarmingly detailed, and sometimes funny. “Girl,” however, tips away from those strengths in favor of self-help bromides broad enough to exclude no one. Time and again on “Girl,” Morris seeks out wide-open territory. Many songs aim for the universal, the big tent: “The Feels” and “Make Out With Me” are lighthearted looking-for-love fun; “Great Ones” favors abstract image over detail (“You’re the perfect storm/So let it pour down on me”); “Good Woman” and “Shade” feel distant. Even “Flavor,” which is oriented around female empowerment, veers toward the bland: “Yeah I’m a lady, I make my dough/Won’t play the victim, Don’t fit that mold.” “The Middle” revealed that Morris’s voice had a natural home beyond country music, but to be fair, so did her debut album, which showed how versatile her vocal approach is — capable of delivering aspirational pop, novel country and also impressive shades of R&B. Her voice is thin, but it’s not brittle; it cuts through a variety of production styles easily. Many of her most forceful vocal performances on “Girl” are far from country music, like the up-tempo soul number “RSVP,” which with a few tweaks could easily make sense for, say, Monica or SZA. One of the finest moments is “The Bones,” which nods to the Chainsmokers and Daya hit “Don’t Let Me Down,” and features some of this album’s sturdiest songwriting. When Morris does lean in to country music’s past, it’s to lightly echo Dolly Parton’s chipper anthem “9 to 5” on “All My Favorite People,” which features Brothers Osborne singing with an arched eyebrow, as if performing a “Hee Haw” sketch. It’s a disruptive way to pay homage. “All My Favorite People” is one of the more detailed songs on this album, and also the one that most echoes the themes of the 2016 Morris: a nod to weed smoking, an assertion that “we love who we love.” But Kacey Musgraves — a Morris contemporary and peer in jolting country music’s center with the occasional drug reference — is now a Grammy album of the year winner, and even Luke Bryan is slipping notes of tolerance into his songs. These gestures now feel less urgent. What seemed audacious just a few years ago is now pro forma. So in the way “Hero” demonstrated how comfortable Morris was coloring outside country music’s lines, “Girl” instead indicates how well Morris might fill in pre-existing boundaries. One of the downsides of moving the goal posts is that they move for you as well. "
5c48a5303a125f5075c05e62,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/23/theater/michael-jackson-musical-chicago.html,"The Michael Jackson musical is taking its first steps onto the dance floor. The show’s producers announced Wednesday that the project, now titled “Don’t Stop ’Til You Get Enough,” will have an initial production this fall in Chicago, running Oct. 29 to Dec. 1 at the James M. Nederlander Theater. The musical will focus on the period of time leading up to Jackson’s “Dangerous World Tour,” which began in 1992, according to a spokesman, confirming details first reported by The Chicago Tribune. It will feature a book by Lynn Nottage, a two-time Pulitzer winner for the plays “Ruined” and “Sweat,” and direction and choreography by Christopher Wheeldon, who won a Tony Award for the choreography of “An American in Paris.” The musical is being produced by the Michael Jackson Estate and Columbia Live Stage, and the producers said they are aiming to bring it to Broadway next year. Jackson’s life has been the subject of numerous examinations, some less flattering than others. Up next: “Leaving Neverland,” a documentary about abuse allegations against the pop star, which is screening at Sundance, and which the Jackson estate has denounced. "
5c7eed0849f0eacbf105b7f1,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/05/t-magazine/stone-facial-tools.html,"There are high-tech beauty devices — flashing LED-light firming masks, pH-measuring patches — and then there are the antitheses: simple stone tools that can stimulate circulation and impart a rested, youthful effect simply by being glided across the face (no plug required). Often cut from minerals such as jade and quartz, these implements have been used for centuries in Chinese medicine and represent the most basic form of natural skin care, says the New York City-based dermatologist Dr. Patricia Wexler. Lately, the options have expanded beyond the ubiquitous jade roller to include tools for gua sha, an ancient form of manual massage that involves “scraping” the edges of a flat stone along the meridians of the face with slow, firm movements. Doing so “can increase circulation, improve lymphatic drainage, de-puff eyes — and provide a calming effect,” says Dr. Wexler. Without an on-off switch or any visual cues, though, these implements require a bit of practice. Here, a quick guide to stone-tool facial massage. Novices should start with Angela Caglia’s Rosebud Eye Treatment Set ($65), hand-held rose-quartz orbs designed for massaging the eye area and temples (a gentler alternative to gua sha). For more advanced lifting, look to gua sha stones or boards — which are typically flat with curved edges for sculpting and breaking up fascia, the connective tissue around muscles that can hinder circulation. Kora Organics’ Rose Quartz Heart Facial Sculptor ($58) and Georgia Louise’s Lift & Sculpt Butterfly Stone ($75) both have helpful indents for getting under cheekbones and the chin while Hayo’u’s Beauty Restorer ($40) has long sides for covering more expansive areas, such as your neck, in single strokes. Shiffa’s FaSha Crystal Clear Quartz Tool ($40) goes further with a serrated edge for deeper toning massages. There are many gua sha methods, but the basic principle is to lift muscles and stimulate lymphatic drainage to clear out excess fluid. Most experts agree that a hydrating serum or face oil should be applied first to provide slip and seal in moisture. Start with your neck and gently run the smooth edge of the stone up and down with firm but not aggressive pressure. Repeat this five to 10 times, then move on to your face, slowly working from the center outward in zones (chin, cheeks, forehead), repeating each motion five to 10 times: “You cannot rush work with stones,” says the New York City-based dermatologist Dr. Macrene Alexiades. Sadie Adams, the founder of Take Care Face & Body spas in New York and Los Angeles, recommends doing gua sha massages twice a day — once in the morning, to bring down puffiness and redness, and again at night, for longer sculpting sessions. Some stones like Make’s Marble Eraser ($150) are multifunctional and “can even be used as an applicator for applying creams as well as massage,” she says. Store your stones in the fridge — the coldness helps further reduce inflammation — and put off using them if you have active acne or just had a laser treatment or peel, which can leave skin tender. Even if you practice gua sha regularly, the “long-term, sustaining benefits are not known,” says Dr. Wexler. But Dr. Alexiades, who often uses gems and stones on her skin, contends that “they hold special value because of the temperature, hardness, metallic ions and other properties.” The New York-based medical aesthetician Jordana Mattioli, meanwhile, believes that technique matters more than material: “I think the overall benefit from the tool is what it’s doing — not what it’s made from.” In the end, if gua sha leaves you relaxed and glowing, you might not care.

5cb4c71149f0eacbf1f8444d,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/15/arts/music/khalid-free-spirit-billboard-chart.html,"Khalid hit No. 1 on the Billboard 200 this week, bumping Billie Eilish from the top slot. Khalid, who was nominated for five Grammys last year, including best new artist, reached No. 1 on Billboard’s album chart for the first time with his second album, “Free Spirit” (Right Hand Music Group/RCA). It sold 85,000 copies as a full album in the United States — helped by a bundling deal that included it with the cost of concert tickets — but also performed well on streaming services, with 147 million streams last week, according to Nielsen. That added up to the equivalent of 202,000 album sales. Eilish, the 17-year-old singer and songwriter who made a splash on last week’s chart, was bumped to No. 2 with “When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?,” and Nipsey Hussle’s year-old “Victory Lap,” which re-entered the chart last week after the rapper was killed at age 33, fell one spot to No. 3. Also this week, Ariana Grande’s “Thank U, Next” is in fourth place, Juice WRLD’s “Death Race for Love” holds at No. 5, and Sara Bareilles’s “Amidst the Chaos” opens at No. 6. Lil Nas X’s song “Old Town Road” holds at No. 1 on Billboard’s Hot 100 pop singles chart, with record-setting streaming numbers. The track, which now includes Billy Ray Cyrus in a remix version, was streamed 142 million times in the United States last week, according to Nielsen. That easily beat the 116 million streams Drake had for “In My Feelings” last July, and it is also nearly four times as many as the No. 2 song on this week’s chart, “Sunflower” by Post Malone and Swae Lee, which had 36.5 million. But “Old Town Road” is still not on Billboard’s Hot Country Songs list, after being removed last month for being insufficiently country. One big reason: The song is largely being ignored by mainstream country radio stations, although it is on many country-themed playlists on streaming services. "

Those numbers gave Eilish the second-largest sales week of the year so far, behind only Ariana Grande, whose “Thank U, Next” debuted with 360,000 units in February. Eilish’s album succeeded across formats: Its streaming total was the third-highest ever for a female artist (behind Grande and Cardi B), while the LP also sold 15,000 copies on vinyl, Billboard reported, the best sales week in that format this year. [Watch how Billie Eilish is redefining teen-pop stardom.] At No. 2 on the Billboard 200 chart is Nipsey Hussle, the Los Angeles rapper who was shot and killed on March 31.

5ca751b949f0eacbf1f81266,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/05/arts/music/avicii-tim-bergling-new-music.html,"STOCKHOLM — For the last six months, the music producer Carl Falk has been venturing into his dark and cloistered recording studio in central Stockholm to collaborate with a ghost. “I was trying to produce through someone else’s eyes and ears — someone who’s not here,” he said with vexed intensity, while sitting at his control board. “It was really hard not to criticize yourself the whole time. Would he like this? What would he have done?” The “he” Falk referred to — Tim Bergling, a.k.a. Avicii, the genre-redefining dance-pop songwriter and producer of global hits like “Levels” and “Wake Me Up” — died last April 20 at the age of 28 during a vacation in Muscat, Oman. A statement from his family at the time stated, “He could not go on,” and while they still decline to go into the details of his death, they are publicly acknowledging the death was a suicide. The family, still very much grieving, is also breaking its nearly yearlong silence with two announcements: the arrival of newly completed Avicii music and the formation of a charitable organization called the Tim Bergling Foundation that will support groups involved with mental health and suicide prevention. A full album, titled simply “Tim,” is due out in June, and its first track, “SOS,” arrives on April 10. “Tim,” which counts Falk among its core production and writing team, is not a posthumous collection of musical leftovers. Instead, it concentrates on songs the artist was far into writing and producing during the last three months of his life, songs which, his friends say, he very much wanted released. Together, the sounds and sentiments they offer represent a cohesive and striking leap ahead for a musician already known as one of the most impactful innovators in electronic pop of the last decade. “This was a different Tim,” said Falk. “A Tim that wanted to say something.” To illuminate the origins of Avicii’s final songs, and to speak more candidly about his suicide, his father sat for his first formal interview since his son’s death. Avicii’s oldest friends spoke, too, as did his most trusted songwriting and production partners in the studios where they have just completed work on the project. All 12 who spoke were in agreement about one thing above all: Not only did they not see Avicii’s death coming, they insisted that in the months before it happened, he was in the best spirits they had seen him in for well over a year. “He had so many plans,” said Lucas Von Bahder, a close friend since middle school. “There were things he wanted to do, places he was going to go.” Albin Nedler, a collaborator who was staying in Avicii’s Los Angeles home when he left on his trip, recalled his saying he was “ in a really good place.” Another creative partner, Vincent Pontare, communicated with Avicii when he was on the plane to Oman. “He was super excited,” he said. “We talked about doing the album after this.” Their testimony stands in dramatic contrast to the image of the star presented by the documentary “Avicii: True Stories,” which debuted on Netflix in Sweden directly after his death and in the United States this past December. The film, which friends say had the musician’s enthusiastic approval, portrayed an artist who seemed to be having a slow-motion nervous breakdown brought on by the relentless pressures of success and a brutal touring schedule. “My life is all about stress,” he says at one point in the film. “It will kill me.” The movie also chronicled Avicii’s struggles with alcohol, which led to an 11-day hospital stay in New York in 2012 for pancreatitis; in 2014, his gall bladder and appendix were removed. Afterward, doctors gave him pills for his pain, which he later said were grossly overprescribed. With an unflinching honesty that his friends considered one of his finest traits, Avicii spoke in the film about his social anxiety, lifelong shyness and profound discomfort with fame. “He worked way too much and looked too thin,” Pontare said about that period. “I said to myself, ‘What happened with him?’” Though the fast-rising star was at the peak of his career then, playing before hundreds of thousands of fans at gigs commanding $250,000 a night, the pressure, and milieu, of the hard-partying world of electronic dance music encouraged his most destructive habits. “It’s very easy to become too attached to partying,” he told Rolling Stone of that period. “You become lonely and get anxieties. It becomes toxic.” Worse, Von Bahder said, “the more famous he got, the more amplified his social anxiety got.” By the end of 2016, Avicii made a bold choice. He quit his highly lucrative touring career to concentrate solely on his greatest love: making music in the studio. Friends and associates say he quickly began to heal. In his adopted home of Los Angeles, he hired a personal trainer, started to meditate and began a writing renaissance. “He was looking super good,” noted Pontare. “We said, ‘the fire is back in him.’” At the same time, the lyrics he was writing in this fertile period had a dark side. They referred repeatedly to “fading away,” being “low down” and “broken.” They also angrily dismissed “the party life” — ironically, the very scene for which Avicii created one of recent pop’s most rousing soundtracks. For the new single, “SOS,” he wrote lines that Aloe Blacc, the vocalist on “Wake Me Up,” sings with special urgency: “Can you hear me, S.O.S./help me put my mind to rest.” None of the people who heard those lyrics at the time found special meaning in them. To confuse matters, darkness had been an element in Avicii’s music from the opening song on his debut album, “True.” “Wake Me Up,” a No. 1 smash in nine countries and a Top 5 hit in America, finds its narrator experiencing the precise inverse of the redemptive refrain from “Amazing Grace” — believing he’s found, only to discover that he is, in fact, lost. “Tim always mixed the dark and the light,” said Per Sundin, an executive at Universal Music, Nordic, who signed a deal with Avicii when the musician was still recording under the name Tim Berg. Hearing the new lyrics now, however, “You go, ‘Oh, is this a metaphor?’ You can interpret the songs in different ways.”  AVICII’S EARLIEST SONGS invited little such interpretation. As a teenager, he began his career by making simple beats on his own. But he developed quickly as a songwriter and, by 2010, created the fully melodic pop/dance gem “Seek Bromance,” a Top 15 hit in Britain. Things really ignited, however, after he took what some felt was a Dylan-goes-electric-style risk at the key electronic music festival Ultra in 2013, where he debuted “Wake Me Up,” which injected elements of folk and country into E.D.M., aided by live musicians. “First, it was shock, then people started booing,” said Johnny Tennander, Avicii’s publisher at Sony/ATV. The young crowd was more taken aback when Avicii brought out a co-songwriter, Mac Davis, who had written hits for Elvis Presley. “On the internet, the comments were ‘rest in peace, Avicii’s career,’” Sundin of Universal Music said. Later, the company tried to recover, and seed interest, by issuing a prerelease SoundCloud mix of the album, one bold enough to also include a song like “Hey Brother,” sung by the bluegrass star Dan Tyminski, and another penned by the avant-gardist Antony Hegarty (now Anohni). At that point, “People said, ‘hold up, this is something new,’” Tennander recalled. “He’s writing music history.” “True” hit No. 5 on the Billboard 200; its 2015 follow-up, “Stories,” reached No. 17. “Tim,” which will be Avicii’s third album, advances his legacy of exploration by embracing psychedelia, Arabian music, sounds of the Caribbean and more. The lyrics, too, show significant growth. “The album felt coherent and personal,” said Tennander. While the new music presents many new angles, the executives overseeing it insisted that they eschew the more commercial route of recruiting superstar guest stars to, instead, use only longtime Avicii collaborators, including Kristoffer Fogelmark and Nedler, Salem Al Fakir and Pontare. Even the top name involved, Chris Martin of Coldplay — who sang a new song that leaked last year, “Heaven” — had sung and helped write a 2015 Avicii track, “True Believer.” The second mandate for the record was to keep as close to the demos the artist left as possible. One track planned for the album got pulled at the last minute because, Sundin said, “it had developed too far from Tim’s vision.” The producers say most songs were 75 to 80 percent done by the time of Avicii’s death. To fill in the rest, they relied on detailed notes he left on his phone and computer, some of which were written in his final days. It fell to Christopher Thordson, from the artist’s management team, to search all his devices for information. “He wrote very specific things about the music,” Thordson said. Conversations about what, if anything, they’d do with that information, and with the music, began among the executives mere days after the star’s death. They received an encouraging response from Avicii’s father, Klas Bergling, who controls the estate. “It should be released,” he said in our interview. “No question about it.”  BERGLING, 73, who ran a successful office supply business before retiring, and his wife, Anki Liden, a well-known actress in Sweden, live in the same apartment they moved to when their musical son was 7. (He stayed there with them, and his three siblings, until his late teens.) Dotting their tastefully designed home are pictures of their youngest son, mostly childhood scenes at the beach. In the kitchen there’s a handsome portrait of a serious-looking Avicii that was used at his memorial gathering; his mother has tempered the intensity of the photo by placing in front of it a snapshot of him smiling widely while playing music with Nile Rodgers. Standing in the kitchen, his mother indicated the shirt, pants and watch she was wearing. “Tim, Tim, Tim,” she said, pointing to each in succession. “They were his. He’s with me.” In the living room, Bergling sat under a giant painting of Stockholm created by his father, who had designed sets for the city’s opera, including one production directed by Ingmar Bergman. He spoke slowly and intently, staring down at the floor for long periods, meeting a reporter’s eye only when he finished speaking. He described his son as very shy growing up, a deep thinker who felt comfortable socially only with his closest friends. They spent countless hours in this apartment playing video games and watching the “The Lord of the Rings” film series and “Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me.” Music came to him later, as a midteen, after his blues-loving, guitar-playing father gave him a guitar of his own. “Tim advanced quickly from my quality,” Bergling said with a smile. His skill at computer games fed into a passion for creating sounds on music programs. After a few years of honing his style, he adopted the stage name Avicii, from a Buddhist term for a realm of hell. “It sounded tough,” Bergling said. “That’s super for a teenager.” As his son’s career progressed, and then exploded, Bergling noticed in Avicii an increasing stage fright, though he loved that his music was being received so resoundingly. Bergling feels the documentary portrait of his son as troubled captured much of the truth from that period, but he believes the timing of the film’s wider release, so close to Avicii’s death, left people unaware of the happier, final phase of his life, after he got off the road. Which leads to a difficult question: Why, 16 months into a brighter phase of his life, did Avicii end it? Bergling said flatly that he does not know. “There is no letter,” he said. He likened his son’s death to “an accident on the motor road” with “several cars.” “Nothing points in the direction that he was planning it.” He would not talk about the method of his son’s death. “It’s not even a year since it happened,” he said. “The family is very traumatized. We want peace.” To help achieve it, he and his wife take “Tim timeouts” from dwelling on their grief. “It sounds a bit military, but you have to be military to handle this,” he said. “We are very vulnerable.” He said it helps, as well, to speak the word “suicide,” something he could not do before. “I use the word as often as I remember to use it,” he said. “I have to get used to the word.” The next day, three of Avicii’s closest friends gathered to offer their own memories. They visited the middle school where they all met, pointing out where they used to sneak cigarettes and alcohol. They talked, too, about the computer games that obsessed them. “We were nerds,” Von Bahder said. “We went into music to interest girls. It didn’t work.” Strolling the neighborhood, the friends advanced to Ciao Ciao Grande, a favorite spot for pizzas over the years. Directly across the street from their table lies the musician’s final resting place. “He didn’t have far to go,” Von Bahder joked. It’s on the grounds of Hedvig Eleonora Church, where the name Tim Bergling appears on a plain plaque not much bigger than a playing card, one of 48 such demarcations on a grid hung on a wall. The star’s exact burial spot isn’t indicated, to stress modesty and to maintain privacy. “It’s very Tim,” Frederik Boberg, another friend, said. The friends didn’t linger long. In that same vein, they have chosen not to speculate much on the motivations behind his death. And while they’ve heard the new lyrics, they’re loath to look too closely at them for clues. Falk, on the other hand, remains haunted by them. “Now, when I listen, I hear a lonely person with a lot of big emotions that he didn’t have enough people to talk to about,” he said. “I feel this music was his way of getting some of that out. That makes this a really important record. Whatever Tim wanted to say is here.” "
5c6d3a283a125f5075c0a924,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/20/world/asia/k-pop-identical-korea.html,"HONG KONG — Doe-eyed with delicate features. A sharp jawline and willowy figure. Fair skin so clear it almost glows. With many South Korean pop idols fitting that description in their sleekly produced music videos, their mass appeal has many of the country’s young people wanting to look just like them. But in an effort to tone down their influence in a beauty-obsessed country where plastic surgery is rampant, South Korea’s government is trying to limit the stars’ presence on television, saying they look too much alike. “Are all the singers on television music programs twins?” the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family wrote about the stars of K-pop, as their music is known, in broadcast guidelines released this month, according to The Korea Times. “They seriously look identical,” it said, adding that many pop idol groups’ musical styles were “just as limited as their appearances.” The guidelines drew such criticism from fans that on Tuesday the ministry apologized for “causing unnecessary confusion,” and said that some of the recommendations would be removed or reviewed, the news agency Agence France-Presse reported. Some compared the guidelines to the censorship imposed during the country’s military dictatorship during the latter half of the 20th century. An online petition, calling for the ministry to be dissolved, read, “The ministry has dared to point out female idols for being too pretty, wearing the same clothes and being skinny,” according to the newspaper Korea Joongang Daily. Ha Tae-kyung, a politician from an opposition party, compared the guidelines — which the gender ministry said applied to both female and male performers — to restrictions on hair and skirt lengths during the dictatorship. “There are no objective standards to people’s looks,” he wrote in a Facebook post on Saturday. It wasn’t the first time Mr. Ha had defended influential K-pop band members. Last year, he called for them to be exempt from the county’s military draft, since top classical musicians are given exemptions. The guidelines were intended to make television a more benevolent experience. Ministry officials said on Monday that viewers worried that television shows “exacerbate inequalities and gender stereotypes, rather than fixing it,” the Korea Joongang Daily reported. In the guidelines, officials suggested that shows avoid featuring performers “whose appearances are exceedingly similar” in the same program. One in three South Korean women have undergone cosmetic surgery between the ages of 19 and 29, a  Gallup Korea poll has found — a trend that mirrors the narrow beauty standards epitomized by K-pop stars. Some South Koreans have openly celebrated having cosmetic surgery, documenting their physical transformations as a rite of passage. In a pair of videos called “Getting Pretty Before” and “Getting Pretty After,” members of the K-pop group SixBomb giddily went for manicures between appointments at a plastic surgeon, where their faces were prodded and poked. “Getting Pretty After” showed them wearing pink bodysuits in an operating room, prancing out afterward with altered faces.

Nav’s “Bad Habits,” released through Republic Records and the Weeknd’s label, XO, opened with the equivalent of 82,000 sales in the United States, including 79 million streams and 24,000 copies sold as a full album, according to Nielsen. Nav’s numbers were helped by bundling deals that offered his fans copies of “Bad Habits” along with tickets to his upcoming tour, and also by the release of a deluxe version of the album, as Billboard noted. Also this week, Ariana Grande’s “Thank U, Next” holds at No. 2, Juice WRLD’s “Death Race for Love” fell to third place after two weeks at No. 1, and the Atlanta rapper Rich the Kid opened at No. 4 with “The World Is Yours 2.” XXXTentacion’s year-old album “?” jumped 22 spots to No. 5, thanks to sales of merchandise bundles connected to the album’s anniversary; XXXTentacion, whose real name was Jahseh Onfroy, was killed last year at age 20. Mötley Crüe’s soundtrack to “The Dirt,” a drama based on a proudly debauched tell-all book on the band, opened at No. 10, the first time Mötley Crüe has reached the Top 10 since its last studio album, “Saints of Los Angeles,” went to No. 4 in 2008. Next week, the 17-year-old pop artist Billie Eilish is expected to have one of the biggest No. 1 openings of the year with her debut album, “When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?” "
5c49fd603a125f5075c0623c,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/24/arts/music/desolation-center-punk-desert-concert-film.html,"Under the first full moon of 1985, the psychedelic punk band Meat Puppets shredded in the depths of the Mojave Desert, powered by a generator and surrounded by incandescent cactuses. Some 500 pink-haired, leather-clad punks had traveled — many in a caravan of yellow school buses — from downtown Los Angeles to what was advertised only as a “remote desert location.” Those who came to the gig, called the Gila Monster Jamboree, in cars were given hand-drawn maps directing them to a checkpoint in Victorville, Calif., where they received a second guide, pointing three miles down a dirt road to a dry lake bed. Many were on acid. “It all seemed like a cartoon,” the Meat Puppets guitarist Curt Kirkwood said in an interview. “It was someplace no one was supposed to be.” In her memoir, the Sonic Youth bassist and singer Kim Gordon called her band’s performance that day — its first on the West Coast — one of her “favorite shows ever.” [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] The spectacle was a part of Desolation Center, a series of guerrilla punk shows in Southern California that set an adventurous precedent that lingers today. Fifteen years before the world’s highest-grossing festival started, Gary Tovar, the founder of Goldenvoice, which produces Coachella, attended a Desolation Center gig. Perry Farrell, who helped mastermind Lollapalooza, played the Jamboree with his pre-Jane’s Addiction group Psi Com. These anarchic desert happenings didn’t last long — they ran from 1983 to 1985 — and have rarely been celebrated, but now their history is chronicled in a documentary called “Desolation Center” that premieres this week at the Slamdance Film Festival in Park City, Utah. Its director is the Desolation Center organizer Stuart Swezey, who began booking shows in 1982 as a 21-year-old college dropout. Growing up amid incendiary late-70s L.A. punk, Swezey was galvanized by the self-starting ethos of underground zines and labels. A self-described autodidact who “found out about Nietzsche from Adam Ant,” he followed the great question mark of punk where it led. “What about venues?” he recalled wondering. “How could we question the assumptions of how you see music performed?” “I felt this compulsion to take music out of nightclubs,” he said in a phone interview, explaining that he preferred the community and spontaneity of unconventional spaces like the Hong Kong Cafe in Los Angeles — a former Chinese restaurant that was loudly overtaken by bands including Black Flag and the Bags — or an Elks Lodge. “It feels more authentic when it’s somewhere it shouldn’t be happening. You’re taken out of your everyday reality.” Swezey was in Mexico, traversing the Sonoran Desert and listening to the L.A. post-punk band Savage Republic, when he decided to book shows in the desert. Like his favored permutations of punk, the landscape was austere, spatial and extraterrestrial. Better still, the desert location would dodge the L.A.P.D., who had shut down Swezey’s earlier efforts at booking downtown warehouse shows. He and the Savage Republic guitarist Bruce Licher tracked down the owner of the remote dry lake-bed property, but did not get in touch. “We looked at each other and said, ‘No one’s going to say yes to us doing this,’” Swezey said. With the San Pedro band Minutemen on board, Swezey advertised $12.50 tickets with photocopied fliers and sold 115. He found a sound person with a generator; arranged the buses, which added “a performance art aspect,” he said; and the “Mojave Exodus” journeyed out on April 24, 1983. Fearing that he might repeat himself after two desert outings — the 1984 event included the imposing German industrial band Einstürzende Neubauten and the terrifying Bay Area machine artists Survival Research Labs — Swezey sought out the complete opposite: He booked Meat Puppets and Minutemen to play on a whaling boat. With the sound system tied to the guard rails, they cruised the shadowy San Pedro and Long Beach harbors after dark. “The barrier between participant and performer blurred,” Swezey said. “We were all part of this bigger thing.” The Jamboree returned to the desert the next year, and Thurston Moore, writing by email, described the mood as “one of complete joy and wonder at being together in a place that might as well have been another planet.” He said the most radical attribute of Desolation Center was that “it asked no permission,” and he called the show “one of the great moments” in the history of Sonic Youth. Swezey’s film illustrates the eclecticism of his early ’80s Southern California scene: the trilling art punks Suburban Lawns, the guitar-less Screamers, the savage performance art of Johanna Went. He interviews Desolation Center musicians including Moore and the Einstürzende Neubauten vocalist Blixa Bargeld, as well as enthusiastic concertgoers (one identified as “sorceress,” another, “failed visionary”). Crucially, Swezey illuminates the necessity of taking the counterculture further underground, as punk continued to clash with the L.A.P.D. under its chief, Daryl Gates. “The L.A.P.D. freaked out about punk rock,” the Germs drummer Don Bolles says in one scene, “and they were gonna squash that stuff.” The film shows the authorities turning up at a Ramones show in riot gear, inciting what the attendee Linda Kite calls “tactical violence on children.” Punk shows were effectively outlawed; punks hid to keep going. This anti-authoritarian impulse thrilled the Burning Man co-founder John Law in 1990, who had heard of Desolation Center’s myth. “It really stuck in my mind,” he said in an interview. “I thought it would be great to do something crazy in the desert.” Law was inspired by Swezey to book early Burning Man locations at the intersection of three separate counties, where, he said, “the evil cops couldn’t get at you.” Free as the desert’s sprawl can be, it was unkind to the glam punks Redd Kross, who got lost for hours in a cramped beater car when they played the Jamboree. “We thought we were going to die,” said the bassist Stephen McDonald, who was 16 at the time of the gig. “I wasn’t much on navigation. Now I am obsessed with navigation.” After their Jamboree, Meat Puppets did not linger: “It started to sink in: ‘Oh, we shouldn’t be here,’” Kirkwood said. Swezey eventually paid $400 in trespassing fees to the federal government, then ceased organizing shows to helm the bookshop and publisher AMOK, and work in television. “Desolation Center” is his first film as a director. “Maybe it’s a good thing, watching a movie about people making something out of nothing in a nowhere place,” the Minutemen bassist Mike Watt said in an interview. He began to recite something of an impromptu beat poem: “No cookie cutter, no sleepwalk, no rubber stamp, no cruise control. You gotta feel the bumps in the road.” Swezey took those ideas to heart. “D.I.Y. is now a shorthand for a lot of things,” he said. “But the idea that you can have a wacky idea and get a bunch of people to go along with it, and make it happen even with very limited resources — that was life-affirming.” "
5c40c4c43a125f5075c04f51,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/obituaries/bonnie-guitar-dead.html,"Bonnie Guitar, who had hit records as a country singer and guitarist, but whose biggest achievement may have been her work as a businesswoman in the male-dominated music industry, died on Jan. 12 in Soap Lake, Wash. She was 95. Howard Reitzes, a longtime friend, confirmed her death, at a rehabilitation hospital. Ms. Guitar was best known for her recording of “Dark Moon,” a Top 20 country single on the Dot label that crossed over to the pop Top 10 in 1957. The record, a haunting nocturne sung in a clear-toned alto, was, along with Patsy Cline’s “Walkin’ After Midnight” — which reached the pop Top 40 the same year — one of the earliest records by a female country singer to cross over to the pop chart. “Dark Moon,” which also made the pop Top 10 in a subsequent version by Gale Storm, earned Ms. Guitar an invitation to appear on “The Ed Sullivan Show” in June 1957. Later that year she performed “Mister Fire Eyes,” her successful follow-up to “Dark Moon,” on the TV show “American Bandstand.” But the achievement for which Ms. Guitar never really received her due, perhaps because she decided to remain in her native Washington instead of resettling in a major recording center like Los Angeles or Nashville, was her trailblazing work as a studio maven and entrepreneur. Over seven decades she did everything from engineer recordings to scout talent and run a record label. In the late 1950s, returning to Seattle after a brief tenure as a session guitarist for the producer Fabor Robison in Los Angeles, she established Dolphin Records with two local businessmen, Bob Reisdorf and Lou Lavinthal. Under her creative direction, Dolphin — which soon changed its name to Dolton — signed the Fleetwoods, a doo-wop-inspired trio of teenagers from Olympia, Wash., whose gauzy pop recordings “Come Softly to Me” and “Mr. Blue” both topped the pop chart in 1959. Ms. Guitar was credited only as the arranger on the trio’s big hits (Mr. Reisdorf, a refrigerator salesman, was listed as producer), but her role was more than such billing might suggest. “Because they had so much air in their voices, I had to do a lot of different fooling with microphones to get enough sound on the tape to saturate the tape,” Ms. Guitar said of her work with the Fleetwoods in an interview with No Depression magazine in 2006. “I knew that the sound would be interesting to people, because they were so used to the full sound. I wanted it to come out, but I wanted it to be intimate. And I knew also not to use a regular guitar sound. I put nylon strings on my guitar, and I played just little, tinkling notes behind them.” Dolton’s other landmark release under Ms. Guitar’s supervision was “Walk — Don’t Run,” a No. 2 pop hit in 1960 for the instrumental combo the Ventures, which came to be regarded as a surf-rock classic. Ms. Guitar had a minor pop hit as a performer for Dolton with a song she wrote, “Candy Apple Red.” On an album she recorded in 1959 for RCA, which went unreleased at the time but was eventually issued by Bear Family Records in 2013 under the title “Intimate Session — the Velvet Lounge,” she sang in the pop-torch mode of Peggy Lee and Julie London. Backing her on the sessions were her fellow guitarists Billy Strange and Tommy Tedesco and other future members of the famed Los Angeles studio entourage known as the Wrecking Crew. Ms. Guitar and her business partners sold the Dolton label to Liberty Records in 1963. She returned to Dot, as a recording artist, producer and talent scout, two years later. Bonnie Guitar was born Bonnie Buckingham on March 25, 1923, in Seattle. Her parents, Doris and John, raised her and her five siblings on a farm outside Auburn, Wash., some 10 miles east of the Puget Sound. Ms. Guitar’s brothers gave her their flat-top Gibson guitar when she was 13. Soon after that, she started entering local talent contests and performing in a musical revue that appeared throughout the region. She also began using the stage name Bonnie Guitar. In the early 1940s she met and started taking music lessons from the guitar teacher and inventor Paul Tutmarc. They married in 1944 and had a daughter, Paula, before parting ways in 1955. Ms. Guitar released a series of country hits for Dot in the 1960s, including three that reached the country Top 10: “A Woman in Love,” “I’m Living in Two Worlds” and “I Believe in Love.” She was named female vocalist of the year by the Academy of Country Music in 1966. In 1969 Ms. Guitar married Mario DePiano. The couple raised cattle and quarter horses together on an 80-acre ranch in Sumner, Wash., about 30 miles from Seattle. Ms. Guitar had all but retired from music business at that point, releasing only the occasional record, until her husband died in 1983. After that she started performing again, most notably as a regular at the Notaras Lodge near her home in Soap Lake. She is survived by a granddaughter, a great-granddaughter and a great-great-grandson. Her daughter died in 2013. Fewer than 5 percent of producers and engineers working in the music industry today are women, according to Women’s Audio Mission, a nonprofit organization that equips women for careers in creative technology. The number was doubtless a fraction of that when Ms. Guitar was staking her claim to a place at the controls of a recording studio. “I worked in the mixing with the engineer, but I worked as an assistant there,” she recalled to No Depression, referring to her apprenticeship with the producer Fabor Robison in Los Angeles in the 1950s. “I’d keep the records, do the cataloging and things. So I learned to operate the equipment.” “Fabor was difficult to work with,” she added, “but I didn’t care. My whole intent was to learn to produce and learn the studio.” "

5c7fcdb549f0eacbf105b9d3,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/06/arts/music/solange-when-i-get-home-review.html,"Solange’s breakthrough 2016 album, “A Seat at the Table,” was a sweet-voiced, multilayered manifesto: the sound of one black woman finding her path forward and confronting the ways systemic racism and sexism affect personal struggles. Its successor, “When I Get Home,” is something different: a reverie, a meditation, a therapeutic retreat, a musicians’ playground. “With ‘A Seat at the Table,’ I had so much to say,” Solange said in an interview streamed from Houston on Sunday night. “And with this album, I have so much to feel.” For Solange, 32, “When I Get Home” is one more step away from ordinary pop expectations. Even before “A Seat at the Table,” she spiked her more conventional R&B albums with songs insisting she was different. Now she has nearly let go of the pop structures that undergirded “A Seat at the Table” and kept its songs catchy. “When I Get Home” is built for gentle, repeated immersion, not instant gratification. Its tracks prize mantras over hooks, and wander in structure and tempo, taking improvisational tangents. Although the album is punctuated by spoken-word interludes — bits of poetry, self-help, comedy and tribute — it is designed to flow as a whole, gradually infusing a room like incense or the smells of home cooking. The opening song, “Things I Imagined,” makes clear that Solange is offering floaters, not bangers. She sings, “I saw things I imagined” more than a dozen times, repeating the line or parts of it while continuously toying with the music: different melodies, different speeds, different chords, everything in a dreamlike flux. A labyrinthine transition leads to the optimistic, vaguely spiritual refrain that will also close the album: “Takin’ on the light.” The production, like nearly the entire album, uses layers of keyboards with improvisational tendrils and puffy, quavery, analog-sounding tones that hark back to 1970s Stevie Wonder, particularly “Journey Through the Secret Life of Plants.” And Solange’s voice is sure-footed and playful, confident that the music will follow her every whim. On nearly all of the full-length songs, Solange is credited as the sole composer and lyricist. She has a long list of guests — among them Playboi Carti, Gucci Mane, Earl Sweatshirt, The-Dream, Dev Hynes, Sampha, Scarface and Panda Bear from Animal Collective — but outside a few prominent guest raps, Solange and her musicians slip the collaborators into the background. This is her space, her sanctuary. As its title suggests, “When I Get Home” contemplates returning home and making a refuge there, reconnecting with memories and everyday surroundings that were once taken for granted. The black solidarity that was Solange’s strongest message on “A Seat at the Table” is still there in “Stay Flo” and in “Almeda,” where she praises “Black skin, black braids, black waves, black days” and insists, “These are black-owned things” over rattlesnake drum-machine accents. But most of the album has her musing on more private, domestic matters and looking inward. The home she invokes is the Third Ward in Houston, where Solange grew up. She returned there to work on this album following a period of upheaval. After a tour that was a model of abstract, starkly choreographed precision, Solange had severe health problems. As 2017 ended, she canceled a New Year’s Eve show because she was coping with an autonomic nerve disorder. Some tracks on “When I Get Home” are named after Houston streets, and Solange’s lyrics (as they were in “Scales” on “A Seat at the Table”) are dotted with references to the city’s idiosyncratic status symbols like grills (extravagantly jeweled dental caps) and “slab” (slow, low and bangin’) cars with reflective “candy paint.” Solange — echoing the artistic playbook of her sister, Beyoncé — paired the release of “When I Get Home” with an online film, which she directed and unveiled as an Apple Music exclusive. It’s a slightly abridged version of the entire album, accompanying non-narrative scenes of, among other things, black cowboys doing rodeo feats, a circular white arena holding group rituals in the desert, and dancers claiming Houston’s urban spaces. At the beginning and end of the film, Solange, in a glittering dress, dances alongside a mysteriously hooded Holy Ghost, revealed at the end as a black man. “The film is an exploration of origin, asking the question how much of ourselves do we bring with us versus leave behind in our evolution,” Solange said in a statement. The film visualizes “Sound of Rain” as a computer-animated extravaganza: a stadium full of dancers that turns into a garden, a burning man, people riding flying machines. The song is one of the album’s closest approaches to pop-R&B, with an ingenious beat, terse melodies and abundant countermelodies; the lyrics are cryptic and sunken into the mix, but at the end Solange reveals, “Sound of rain/helps me let go of the pain.” Another near-pop song is “Jerrod,” a promise of intimacy — “Give you all the depths of my wanting” — that Solange coos with the airy tenacity of Janet Jackson. For much of the album, Solange dissolves verse-chorus-verse into meditations and vamps. Keyboards supply rich chords that offer plenty of places to alight harmoniously; the beat is often an implied pulse that can and does leave behind 4/4 convention. In the chromatic haze, Solange ponders questions and considers life lessons in a few ambiguous words. In “Beltway,” she sings “don’t, don’t, don’t,” pauses, and continues, “you love me”; it’s impossible to tell where the couple stand. In “Dreams,” she recalls growing up with dreams and advises patience: “Dreams, they come a long way — not today.” She teeters on the verge of a relationship in “Time (is)” — “I was getting to feel/All the way” Solange sings — before its six-beat meter changes to five beats and Solange and Sampha each repeatedly sing an enigmatic line: “You’ve got to know.” And with hovering piano chords and hissing cymbal, “Down With the Clique” hints at the anticipation of Herbie Hancock’s “Maiden Voyage” as Solange reminisces, “We were rollin’ up the street/Chasing the divine.” In the interlude “Can I Hold the Mic,” Solange explains, rhapsodically: “I can’t be a singular expression of myself. There’s too many parts, too many spaces, too many manifestations, too many lines, too many curves, too many troubles, too many journeys, too many mountains, too many rivers, so many …” A keyboard follows each syllable of that speech, soon joined by chords to harmonize. The lilt of her voice alone could have carried these few seconds of content, but she and her musicians made the effort to match the rhythm and find its song. Because Houston is not her only home on this album; music is. "

Let us know at theplaylist@nytimes.com and sign up for our Louder newsletter, a once-a-week blast of our pop music coverage. Long before the English-speaking pop mainstream took real notice, BTS were already global pop stars. The successes the K-pop outfit have had in this country happened largely without worrying about how it might or might not fit in. On its new release, “Map of the Soul: Persona,” it showcases its highest-profile collaborations to date in a way that preserves its core strengths. The shimmering “Boy With Luv” features Halsey — but more importantly, it features Halsey singing in Korean, exactly the sort of bilingual exchange that’s all too rare. And “Make It Right” is in part written by Ed Sheeran. It has some of his signature soft-soul gestures, but BTS renders them with complexity. The least comfortable collaborations are the ones in which the balance of power is wildly uneven, where one party badly needs something from the other. But all you hear on these songs is mutual respect. JON CARAMANICA The first new song in two years from Steve Lacy — who plays in the space-soul outfit the Internet and has collaborated with Blood Orange, Vampire Weekend and others — is a narcotically mellow inversion of casually strutting 1970s R&B. On the one hand, it’s about yearning, with Lacy’s vocals aquatically damp; but on the other, Lacy is far too at ease — far too chill — to really break a sweat. CARAMANICA “So Good” is elegantly rendered, built-by-hand disco from Omar Apollo, one of several strong songs from his impressive new EP, “Friends.” For the last two years, he’s been releasing songs that were sharp but felt tentative, as if he was worried about overstepping boundaries. But on “Friends,” he moves toward the upbeat and joyful, and sounds more free than ever. CARAMANICA Lead singers with Sounds of Blackness — Ann Nesby, Big Jim Wright and Lauren Evans — spill over one another with overlapping gospel praise in “Til I Found You,” the first single from a new collection by the producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis with various collaborators. The track is built on an easygoing beat and rippling guitar lines, but the singers turn it into an urgent competition to extol the comforts of faith. JON PARELES “I can make your dreams come true/if you let me listen in on you,” Yeasayer’s Anand Wilder sings, as if he’s Alexa or Siri or some present or near-future authoritarian state. That’s the sweet chorus; the verses are far more paranoid, with no more comfort to offer than, “Don’t look so guilty, you’ve got nothing to hide.” In a lilt with an electronic pulse — glancing back at the Cars — Yeasayer pinpoints where the promise of convenience meets the threat of constant surveillance. PARELES This exuberant romp about the upsides of getting rich quick is effective and fun, but it’s more intriguing for the performers it brings together, a union of singer-rappers of North African heritage: Geko, born in Manchester, England, is of Libyan and Algerian descent; Ay Em, from London, of Egyptian and Moroccan heritage; and French Montana, who grew up in the Bronx but was born in Morocco. Each has a particular take on the blurry line between rapping and melody. To be fair, French Montana mostly phones in his mumbles, but Geko and Ay Em make for a winning tag team. Geko, a strong rapper, sings with a light touch, and Ay Em provides aural and spiritual ballast: “I just did my prayer, then you know it’s back to business.” CARAMANICA In Courtney Barnett’s latest two-chord stomp — well, three in the chorus — she’s even blunter than usual about self-doubt and alienation: “I feel stupid, I feel useless, I feel insane,” she begins. But as she finds a defensive posture — “We’re gonna tell everyone it’s O.K.,” she sings with a laugh — the band cranks up, organ and tambourine pile on and voices join her for a rowdy singalong. She may be insecure and alienated, but she’s far from alone. PARELES With tolling chimes, a growly high-drama vocal, a minor-mode melody, a verse about death and an arena-scale drumbeat, “God’s Country” verges on goth metal, with only a little bit of slide guitar and devout lyrics to qualify it as country. It’s Blake Shelton’s latest paean to rural life, a song about hard-working, churchgoing farmers that’s not cozy and nostalgic, but grimly fatalistic. PARELES The guitarist Bill Frisell and the bassist Thomas Morgan released their first duets album two years ago, a collection of performances that smoldered like warm coals and bespoke an easygoing, simpatico new partnership. Now they’re back with “Epistrophy,” an entire album of covers. It closes with this rendition of “In the Wee Small Hours of the Morning,” honoring the old Sinatra ballad’s melancholy theme but still animated by Frisell’s ebullient warmth. And all the while there is Morgan’s virtuoso flexibility; he’s as responsive as he is grounded and firm. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO With Abrams, a veteran bassist affiliated with Chicago’s broad-minded experimental jazz community, it makes less sense to speak of tracks than to talk about stories. Each of the four lengthy performances on his new album with Natural Information Society unfolds slowly and consequentially, with a sense of abstract narrative. On the nearly 24-minute “In Memory’s Prism,” Abrams keeps the underlying bass line — played on the guembri, and indebted to North African music — almost unchanged while the harmony and instrumentation slowly shift above. (At various times, there’s harmonium and trumpet and autoharp and bass clarinet in there, to name a few.) It all has the implacable momentum of migration, or the feeling of a big new idea just coming into being. At the very least, it will put your mind in a place of peaceful wandering; by the end, you’re likely to wind up deep in your own imagination, remembering or inventing a story of your own. RUSSONELLO If this track is any indication, Josephine Wiggs’s solo album due May 17, “We Fall,” is a far cry from her stint as a founder and bassist in the Breeders. “Time Does Not Bring Relief” is a droney, Minimalist instrumental built on echoing piano figures, a major chord with a recurring dissonance, quiet glitchy sounds and fleeting appearances from string-section lines and a drumbeat. It’s meditative, while it hints at unresolved tensions. PARELES "

5c45982b3a125f5075c05788,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/21/world/asia/teresa-teng-china-beijing-taiwan.html,"BEIJING — A beer in one hand, a microphone in the other, Meng Xiaoli stood in a crowded restaurant and began to sing. Your smile is as sweet as honey, Just like flowers blooming in the spring breeze. I wonder where I’ve seen you. During the workweek, Mr. Meng, 53, a strait-laced budget analyst who wears a red Chinese Communist Party pin on his lapel, spends his days shuttling between meetings and poring over reports as a budget analyst for a state-owned firm. But on weekends, he retreats to what he calls his “spiritual home,” a two-story restaurant and museum in Beijing that is a shrine to the woman he considers a goddess: the Taiwanese pop singer Teresa Teng, one of Asia’s most celebrated artists. “She knows what it’s like to be human — to find love and to make mistakes,” Mr. Meng said. Ms. Teng, who died suddenly in 1995 at age 42, was renowned for turning traditional Taiwanese and Chinese folk songs into maudlin Western-style hits. She was once banned in the mainland, her music denounced by the authorities as “decadent” and “pornographic.” But she never lost her base of rabid fans here, even as tensions have escalated between China and Taiwan, the self-ruled island that Beijing considers part of its territory. Her most ardent followers now gather at the Teresa Teng Music-Themed Restaurant in a sprawling residential neighborhood in western Beijing, near liquor stores, barbecue joints and hot pot restaurants. An enormous portrait of Ms. Teng, smiling as she holds a white rose, graces its front door. Inside, singers dressed in elegant gowns perform renditions of her signature ballads like “The Moon Represents My Heart” and “Sweet as Honey.” Customers sample dishes inspired by Ms. Teng’s music, including “moon pancakes” and fried pumpkin with honey sauce. More than two decades after her death, Ms. Teng’s mainland fans say her sugary voice and gentle personality are still one of a kind. “She’s a storyteller,” said Zheng Rongbin, the media executive who opened the restaurant in 2011. “She looks like the girl next door.” At a recent lunchtime performance, Wu Yingwei, 30, watched as her daughter, Muyao, 2, danced to a performance of “Ask Yourself,” a song that is a staple of karaoke bars in Asia. Ms. Wu said her daughter liked listening only to Ms. Teng’s songs and could sing several of her hits, including “Sweet as Honey.” “Teresa Teng’s style never gets old,” she said. “Her songs are very gentle and make me feel really warm.” Ms. Teng is claimed by many mainlanders as one of their own, even though she was born in Taiwan. Her father, who grew up in the mainland in the northern province of Hebei, was part of the Nationalist forces that fought Mao Zedong’s Communists in the Chinese Civil War. He retreated to Taiwan in 1949, four years before Ms. Teng’s birth. Ms. Teng was one of the first foreign singers whose music flowed into China after it began opening its economy to the world in the late 1970s. But her music was quickly banned as part of a campaign by the Communist government to block “spiritual pollution” from the West. The Taiwanese government used her music as a psychological weapon, blasting it from loudspeakers positioned near the mainland. Tapes of Ms. Teng’s music circulated on a black market in the mainland, and her popularity was clear. Because of her surname, which in Chinese uses the same character as the Communist leader Deng Xiaoping’s, she was sometimes referred to as Little Deng, reflecting her hold on the public imagination. Ms. Teng occasionally veered into politics, holding concerts to show solidarity with the pro-democracy protesters who gathered at Tiananmen Square in Beijing in 1989. She never performed in the mainland. In recent years, however, the government has warmed to her music, and the state-run media has celebrated her mainland roots. In 2011, officials opened a memorial hall in honor of Ms. Teng in her father’s hometown, Daming, where fans now converge on the anniversary of her death. The mainland has at least two restaurants devoted to Ms. Teng, including the one in Beijing, which is at the center of a struggling cultural development known as Taiwan Street. Mr. Zheng, the owner, said Ms. Teng’s music was still popular in the mainland because it reminded people of hearing her songs for the first time in the years after the chaos of Mao’s Cultural Revolution. “For many people, it was a very new experience and very different from what they had heard in the Cultural Revolution,” he said. “Now when people hear it, they remember what it was like to be young.” Ms. Teng has been hailed as a symbol of commonality between China and Taiwan at a time when relations have deteriorated, with President Xi Jinping of China recently warning that efforts by Taiwan to assert independence could be met by armed force. But Mr. Zheng said he did not have politics in mind when he opened the restaurant. “Music has no sense of borders,” he said. The Beijing restaurant, which is officially recognized by Ms. Teng’s family in Taiwan, also includes a museum, on the first floor, displaying some of Ms. Teng’s dresses, pianos and clocks. On the second floor is the performance hall, with a chandelier and a disco ball. On busy nights, hundreds of people pack into the hall, gathering around tables covered with red-checkered tablecloths. Some guests opt for private rooms, where they sing karaoke versions of Ms. Teng’s songs. On a recent night, Wang Liang, 36, paid $15 to request a live performance of “I Only Care About You” for his wife and daughter. “Ever since I was a child, I’ve always liked Teresa Teng’s songs,” Mr. Wang said. “Her songs aren’t as flippant as pop songs now, and they really stick in your memory.” One of the singers at the restaurant, Wang Xin, 25, who was trained as a classical pianist, said Ms. Teng’s supple singing style, rich with vibrato, is difficult to imitate. “The emotions are hard to capture,” she said. “It’s very hard to find the right tone.” She practices by listening to Ms. Teng’s songs on repeat on her phone. At a recent show, Ms. Wang, wearing fake eyelashes and red lipstick to evoke Ms. Teng, approached the microphone to sing one of the pop star’s tougher standards, “What Do You Have to Say?”: I waited for more than a year, Three-hundred sixty-five days isn’t easy, You simply don’t have me in your heart, Give me my love back!

Romeo Santos’s “Utopia” is a luscious new album of collaborations with bachata stars of various generations (though notably, none who emerged after Santos became a solo phenomenon). But while there are standout performances from Raulin Rodriguez and Monchy & Alexandra, among others, the most anticipated song is “Inmortal,” on which Santos reunites with his bandmates in Aventura, the foursome that modernized bachata in the 2000s and hasn’t released new music in eight years. “Inmortal” is lithe and lovely — the group’s taut dynamic is still rooted in the formidable pair of Lenny Santos on guitar and Max Santos on bass. (Henry Santos dips in and out on background vocals.) Romeo sings like a matador — commanding but also sly, weaving in and out of the forefront at will. Like the rest of this album, “Inmortal” argues that even as the music Aventura spawned mutates ever faster, there is still comfort in how it used to be. JON CARAMANICA Gil Scott-Heron, the visionary poet and musician who died in 2011, would have turned 70 this week. In commemoration, the Archives — a reggae band based in Scott-Heron’s onetime home of Washington, D.C. — has released the first single from a forthcoming album devoted to his repertoire. This version of “Home Is Where the Hatred Is,” a testimonial of bleak addiction, trades in the edgy anxiety of Scott-Heron’s scurrying original for a sedate, dub-reggae flow. But Puma Ptah, a vocalist hailing from the U.S. Virgin Islands, holds onto the lyric’s core sense of pathos and frustration. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO It’s more important that this exists than that it’s great. That said, it’s almost great. Conor Oberst takes the Jackson Maine part and aggressively deflates it — he turns the searching lyrics morose, and you sense he wants to yank the cadence down into the mud but doesn’t let himself. Perhaps that’s because Phoebe Bridgers is on deck, and she’s in ferocious form. If Oberst is stubbing the song out, she’s lifting it over her head in triumph. CARAMANICA Blissed-out but not blissful synth-pop from the Australian singer Hatchie, “Stay With Me” is viscous and shimmering, but also so lush it verges on the suffocating. Maybe that’s by design: “It’s no better now you’re gone/I feel nothing, I feel numb,” she sings, wallowing in ache as the dreamy music takes up all the air in the room. CARAMANICA “Titanic Rising,” the album released on Friday by Weyes Blood — the songwriter Natalie Mering — takes refuge from present-day dread in vintage sounds, reaching back to the late 1960s and the early 1970s. “Everyday,” a song about longing and fear of loneliness, moves from Beatles-style piano bounce and bass countermelodies to a chorus full of exultant vocal harmonies recalling the Mamas and the Papas. An orchestral buildup sounds supportive but then falls apart, leaving her unfulfilled once again. The video, directed by Mering, becomes a horror movie. JON PARELES “When the last tree has fallen and the rivers are poison/You cannot eat money,” the Norwegian songwriter Aurora warns in “The Seed,” an environmental anthem that seesaws between hopeful and baleful. She summons an orchestra and a multitracked choir to juxtapose the growth of a seed — “Feed me sunlight/feed me air” — with the forces arrayed against it. The outcome isn’t guaranteed. PARELES Composure on the surface, passion and turbulence flaring within: That’s what happens in the songs on Ioanna Gika’s new album “Thalassa,” released on Friday. In “Out of Focus,” stately electric-piano chords pace a sustained but odd-angled melody: “All I was, was wanting you,” she confesses as it begins. But nervous, double-time drums and electronics are already creeping in, soon to swell with voices and instruments, as she realizes this romance is crumbling: “Holding on to history/love, the absentee.” The melody stays clear and aloft; the hope plummets. PARELES “The Who Sell Out” was a 1967 concept album, an imaginary pirate-radio broadcast that placed new Who songs between the band’s own mock commercials. Now it’s a just throwaway reference — “Im’a sell out like the Who” — for Barrington DeVaughn Hendricks, the rapper and utterly unpredictable producer who records as Jpegmafia. His casual boasts are by far the most commonplace part of this track, a glimmering assemblage of looping keyboards, comic interruptions and plaintive melodic fragments of song from the electronic-pop singer Eyas: “I’ll dream again, or will I?,” she muses, in promising non sequiturs. PARELES In just two and a half minutes, “Tirata Tiratata” demonstrates the depth of Anat Fort’s talents as a pianist, and the synergetic range of her trio (Gary Wang on bass and Roland Schneider on drums), which is celebrating its 20th year together. Fort skids around the keyboard in quick, truncated lines, using jagged chords in the left hand to slice up her momentum even as the group’s energy continues to rise. With the trio tumbling toward a release, Fort remains governed by a deep sense of poise and a luminous touch. RUSSONELLO The 12-minute title track of Christian Fennesz’s new album, “Agora,” his first solo release in five years, conjures elemental forces in limitless space: vast washes of sound that materialize slowly out of nowhere and transform themselves from noise to tone and back again, perceptible sometimes as chords and sometimes as abstract sound. They work on their own time frame, hinting at something that dwarfs mere human scale. PARELES "
5c42732c3a125f5075c053bf,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/18/obituaries/lorna-doom-dead.html,"Teresa Ryan, who played bass in the proudly extreme 1970s Los Angeles punk band Germs under the name Lorna Doom, died on Wednesday in Thousand Oaks, Calif. She was 61. Her death, in a hospital, was announced on Facebook by the band’s drummer, Don Bolles, and confirmed by her cousin Beth Bergman, who said the cause was cancer. Ms. Ryan would stand calmly onstage with her bass lines propelling the music along with Mr. Bolles’s beat, while Germs’ leader, Darby Crash, delivered the songs with anarchic, often bloodily self-mutilating intensity: confronting audience members, lighting matches, smashing glasses on his head. Germs shows often sparked riots in the audience. The band made one album and lasted until 1980, when Darby Crash (born Jan Paul Beahm) killed himself with a heroin overdose. He had often spoken of a five-year plan to create a notorious cult band, record one album and then commit suicide to make himself legendary. Germs formed in 1976 with an initial lineup of Darby Crash, Lorna Doom, Pat Smear (born Georg Albert Ruthenberg) on guitar (he later toured with Nirvana and became a member of Foo Fighters) and Belinda Carlisle on drums (she was replaced by Mr. Bolles). Ms. Carlisle, who went on to be the lead singer of the Go-Go’s, wrote on Twitter on Thursday that Ms. Ryan “was a visionary and a trailblazer” who “never compromised.” Teresa Marie Ryan was born on Jan. 4, 1958, in Dallas and grew up in Southern California and Nebraska. Her father, James Patrick Ryan, was a lumber store manager; her mother, Betty Marie (Bruenecke) Ryan, was a homemaker. Ms. Ryan and Ms. Carlisle, who were high school friends, were recruited into Germs through an ad placed by the other two original members calling for “two untalented girls” to join a band. Darby Crash renamed them — Ms. Carlisle became Dottie Danger — and, true to early punk style, musical skill didn’t matter. Ms. Ryan learned her instrument while in the band, although she earned praise from musicians like Mike Watt, the bassist for the Minutemen, who said on Twitter, “Good people, I love LOVE germs bass lines!” Germs played its first show in April 1977, and six months later released the single “Forming”/”Sexboy,” which is often cited as the first Los Angeles punk record. Germs became a resident band at the Los Angeles club the Masque and thrived on shock value. At some shows, Darby Crash would cut into his chest a symbol that he called “circle one”; Germs fans showed loyalty by giving one another cigarette burns. Laura Jane Grace of the band Against Me! posted on Twitter, “I can still see the ‘Germs burn’ on my wrist from when I was 14 years old.” Germs’ only album, “(GI),” was produced by Joan Jett and released in 1979. Its lyric sheet revealed the poetic intelligence of the words that Darby Crash would drunkenly yowl, slur or skip during performances. The band also recorded six songs for the William Friedkin film “Cruising,” although only one, “Lion’s Share,” was used. During the late-1970s punk era, Germs shows grew tumultuous. “It all got terribly violent and extremely frightening towards the end,” Ms. Ryan told The Guardian in 2008. “There was this influx of punks from Southern California who latched on to our gigs and basically made it impossible for us to play without a riot happening. That was the beginning of the end.” By 1980, most promoters were unwilling to book the band. “Now we can’t play anywhere,” Darby Crash complained in Penelope Spheeris’s 1981 punk documentary, “The Decline of Western Civilization.” He started another band, but regrouped Germs for a final show on Dec. 3, 1980. Four days later, he was dead. Ms. Ryan moved to New York City with her boyfriend, who was the bassist in Joan Jett’s band, the Blackhearts. Born Gary Moss, he took Ms. Ryan’s last name as a stage name when he joined the band in 1979, performing as Gary Ryan. They were married in the early 1980s and divorced in the 1990s. Ms. Ryan is survived by her brother, Richard Ryan. In New York City, Ms. Ryan worked for art galleries. She returned to California in the early 2000s to help care for her ailing father, and worked there as a personal assistant and a bookkeeper. She lived in Agoura Hills, Calif. Ms. Ryan was an adviser for “What We Do Is Secret,” a 2007 movie about Germs that featured Shane West as Darby Crash and Bijou Phillips as Lorna Doom. After singing with the reunited Germs at a party for the film, Mr. West went on to tour as lead singer with the surviving band members. In clubs, and on the Warped Tour in 2006 and 2008, Germs performed for a younger, more well-behaved generation of punk fans. “It was totally surprising to get the band together again,” Ms. Ryan told The Guardian, “but it’s also the most comfortable thing in the world.” "

Last week, “Thank U, Next” (Republic) became Grande’s second No. 1 album in six months, with notably high streaming numbers for a pop album. In its second week out, its totals fell by more than 50 percent, with 169 million streams and 20,000 copies sold as a complete album, according to Nielsen. But that was enough to stay on top. Billboard reported that it was the first time that a solo female artist has had more than one week at No. 1 on the chart since Taylor Swift’s “Reputation” notched four weeks at the end of 2017. (Last October, Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper spent three weeks at the top with “A Star Is Born”; this week, that soundtrack is No. 3.) Also this week, the “Bohemian Rhapsody” soundtrack rose one spot to No. 2; look for it to remain strong on next week’s charts, thanks to the best actor Oscar for its star, Rami Malek. The duo Florida Georgia Line opened at No. 4 with “Can’t Say I Ain’t Country,” and in fifth place is Drake’s mixtape “So Far Gone,” which first came out 10 years ago but was not commercially released until last week.

The song, which exorcised his grief in a torrent of fidgety guitars, frantic beats and haunted vocals, has been streamed more than 3.5 million times on Spotify, and its video has about 850,000 views on YouTube. In December, he won the Critics’ Choice 2019 Brit Award (Britain’s equivalent to the Grammys). While writing the song, Mr. Fender learned that 84 British men commit suicide each week; another friend killed himself after he finished recording the song. Mr. Fender blames those losses, in part, on “a world where men don’t feel they can talk about their problems, no matter how bad they are,” he said. “I started to question all the archaic ideas of what a bloke is supposed to be.”  On that score, he has plenty of musical company.  In recent months, a number of male rock musicians and hip-hop artists have released songs that rail against the most suffocating notions of what it can mean to be a man. And they’re finding a significant audience by doing so.  The new album by the brutalist British band Idles, “Joy as an Act of Resistance,” uses toxic masculinity as a sustained theme. It was a top 5 hit in Britain and has garnered some of the most awed reviews of the year. The Guardian ranked it No. 6 on its list of best 50 albums of 2018, writing that listening to it “often feels like purging yourself of the year’s toxicity in one pent-up blizzard of drums and guitars.” As It Is, a neo-emo band from Brighton, England, released a single last June, “The Stigma (Boys Don’t Cry),” that attacks traditional male restrictions. The band’s current album, “The Great Depression,” has been streamed more than 13 million times on Spotify.  American artists have tackled the issue as well, including Tiny Moving Parts, an emo group from Minnesota, who released the album “Swell” last year. And Henry Jamison, 30, a singer-songwriter in Vermont, addresses what Rolling Stone magazine calls “violent interpretations of masculinity” in “Gloria Duplex,” an album due out next month.  The men, who all identify as heterosexual, say their writing is a direct result of the #MeToo movement and the dialogue about gender identity. “All these norms that we see aren’t normal at all,” said Joe Talbot, the lead singer and writer of Idles. “It’s a giant lie.” For Mr. Talbot, 33, personal tragedy also brought the issues home. In 2017, his wife gave birth to a stillborn girl. “It was the most traumatic experience I will ever go through,” he said. “But I kept myself detached from my emotions. I thought it was stoicism. That’s not stoicism. It’s ignorance.” It took months of therapy, and reading Grayson Perry’s 2016 book dissecting male tropes, “The Descent of Man,” before Mr. Talbot said he could “connect with other people and finally feel less lonely.”  Jordan Stephens, 26, a British hip-hop musician and actor, underwent a similar journey after a sudden breakup. “I had never experienced a loss of control like that,” Mr. Stephens said. “I was crying about stuff that had nothing to do with the breakup, stuff that I had put away for years, like my grandma dying.” “I thought, something is wrong with men’s relationships to emotion,” he said. The experience moved him to write an essay in The Guardian in October titled “Toxic masculinity is everywhere. It’s up to us men to fix this.”  “For years, I had been a finger-pointing feminist,” he said. “I would call out every guy but myself. But the breakup and what happened around it put up a mirror to my own issues.” The fact that music has become a key way for these men to explore these themes has deep antecedents. Elvis Presley blew away traditional gender roles by presenting himself as a hip-swinging sex symbol, a role more commonly reserved for women at the time. Transgressive stars of the 1960s, like Mick Jagger, and glam-rockers of the ’70s, like David Bowie, used androgyny to push back against gender constraints.  That dynamic has remained part of popular music ever since, though it has often been expressed just by teasing implication or as an act of provocation for commercial gain. See: hair metal bands like Mötley Crüe and Poison.  The current crop of maverick musicians takes a more earnest approach. One of their boldest precursors is Henry Rollins. Starting in the ’80s, his hard-core music, confrontational spoken-word pieces, and he-man persona consciously used virility to attack itself — something that Idles now does just as avidly.  Mr. Rollins, 57, sees significant change between many of today’s musicians and those of his early days. “The entire scene is so less testosterone loaded,” he said. Younger musicians “have broken with the past. It’s a more open and truthful conversation we’re having now. I went to an all-boys school. We had gay teachers. Couldn’t talk about it. Gay students. Never mentioned.” “The conversation about gender fluidity makes me feel old,” he said, but “I see I have to continually evolve.”  Indeed, musicians in their 30s already feel a cultural rift with peers in their 20s on matters of gender identity. “When I was in college 10 years ago, we were just horrible,” Mr. Jamison said. “People in their 20s are examining these issues in a way that feels very natural. They’re not going to have trouble if someone takes on a different pronoun.” Still, the men worry that airing their issues may be seen as yet another case of men seizing the mic from women. “I don’t want to in any way belittle the struggles of other people while talking about the struggles of a straight man,” said Patty Walters, 27, the lead singer of As It Is. “At the same time, toxic masculinity is real.” "
5c3953953a125f5075c04085,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/11/crosswords/daily-puzzle-2019-01-12.html,"SATURDAY PUZZLE —  I’ll get to the clues quickly today because I thought there were so many sticklers, but this puzzle was very twinny, or crossy, for me — lots of paired entries. Some of them had something in common, some were nigh impossible to complete, some combined to aid me greatly, but this facet was one of the takeaways for me today. As always, I loved Sam Trabucco’s style and got a kick out of his cluing and most of today’s nine debuts. (The meh ones were I COULDN’T and HOME CARE, not that there’s anything wrong with either one, they just weren’t remarkable. Certainly not a constructor’s fault.) The first clues that delighted me were VILA and VANILLI, which I would call a personal reverse Natick, since I was able to ink them in with total confidence. I misremembered Bob Vila as a character on a sitcom, “Home Improvement,” not an educational show, “Home Again,” but I’m still a little afraid to get on a ladder — no D.I.Y. expert here. I also misremembered the whole Milli Vanilli story, which turned very tragic, but their music is very embedded in my mind with my college experience, so any mention makes me pleasantly nostalgic (this is only the second time we’ve seen VANILLI, and it’s been more than 20 years). My college memories are free of PEP BANDS, by the way, which was also a debut.  After picking through much of the upper right, my letters spread south and west, petering out at the lower left corner, which stumped me most. There was tough stuff, though, throughout this whole grid. A couple of misdirections I was fond of were clues for ESP and GLAND, and there were fun clues galore. ARIE, clued as such, made me grimace for a second, but I didn’t dwell on it. 13A: I thought “overrode” had to be the thing here, for “Domineered,” and rolled my eyes a little at OVERBORE, which doesn’t strike me as a word. Wrong! It has even been in the puzzle before, multiple times. I was not overbored by this grid today, Mr. Trabucco, I feel you went quite overboard to amuse us.  15A: I am pre-nostalgic for the group in question here, the modern and still-existent GORILLAZ. This is one of those very insidery double clues, by the way; one of the founders of GORILLAZ is Damon Albarn, who is also in Blur, one of the bands mentioned in the crossing clue at 4D. I actually knew this, but I didn’t think of him as a poster child for BRITPOP (even though he is, as I learned once I consulted the world); I also had always assumed that GORILLAZ was a hipster misspelling of “guerrillas,” not anything to do with the Monkees. So there’s another bit of critical life information we’ve acquired today. I had never actually seen the humans behind the band in question, because they are often represented by cartoon characters, even when I’ve seen videos of them performing live. 16A: Right after a 21st-century pop music reference, bam! An abstruse compendium of world literary figures like Jeppe Aakjaer, a novelist who “was intensely concerned with social misery and the need for reform.” BENET’S Reader’s Encyclopedia was first edited, in 1948, by William Rose Benét, older brother of Stephen Vincent. There was an edition in 2008; there may be one in the works right now. 44A: In a rebuttal to the old “Plus ça change” argument, some aficionados among you may find it bemusing that this word, LICTORS, and its singular variant, were considered entries for early in the week, including a Monday puzzle back in 1954 (clued as “Fasces bearer in ancient Rome”). I was inordinately stumped by this entry and hit a dead end at its crossing with 45D, too, as I knew nothing of California’s Fort ORD. That little filler word is usually clued as an airport.  7D: It felt as if the four 12-letter entries in this puzzle split into pairs, with this one, the punnily clued DRAMA COACHES, crossing IM SPEECHLESS. 8D, which referenced the top entry on a Sports Illustrated list that I had certainly heard about but never examined, was one half of the other pair of 12-letter entries. The entry here is MIRACLE ON ICE — the unlikely 1980 Olympic hockey victory that was all rife with Cold War gravitas and rah rah United States patriotism. I’m just not familiar, except that I worked with one of the Times reporters who covered it, the perspicacious Craig Whitney, and he was still telling pretty riveting stories 25 years later in the newsroom. (It looks as if he took some part in a documentary, in case this event is also your No. 1 and you want more, more, more.) As far as 27A, the 12-letter entry crossing the above, this idiom made me think of my No. 1 “moment in sports history,” which was at 13 on the Sports Illustrated list. Can a horse PUT ON A CLINIC? It’s not like we could ask any of the rivals he left far, far behind in the dust; they would just shake their heads and murmur “neigh.” Is it silly that I get a little teary whenever I see Secretariat looking as if he could have soared 10 more miles with a sack of potatoes on his back? It took me forever to get the middle of this grid to work, to the point where I’m thrilled with how it turned out (ARIE and EERO notwithstanding). Often with this sort of design, though, you get the middle to work and then find that one of the corners won’t cooperate — I was happy to skate by here, though I’m not exactly in love with the SW (it’s certainly less colorful than I’d hope for, and LICTORS is a bit of a deep cut). I’m not one to include a ton of sports stuff in a crossword, so consider this grid with its skiing, hockey, football and ESPN references to be an anomaly. Sports are more my dad’s speed, so it’s a fun coincidence that it’s his birthday today! Happy birthday! I hope this crossword puzzle makes up for all the sports I quit during elementary school. Subscribers can take a peek at the answer key.  Trying to get back to the puzzle page? Right here.  What did you think? "
5c6ad51a3a125f5075c0a465,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/18/arts/music/ariana-grande-thank-u-next-billboard-chart.html,"Less than six months after a No. 1 album, the pop singer Ariana Grande is back with an even bigger smash: “Thank U, Next” (Republic) tops the Billboard chart this week with 307 million song streams and 116,000 in sales for a total of 360,000 album equivalent units, according to Nielsen Music. Grande’s fourth career No. 1 album comes during a prolific, artistically redefining period for the singer, whose last release, “Sweetener,” debuted atop the chart in late August with 231,000 units sold. Since then, Grande has used the fuel of her tabloid moments for music, earning her first No. 1 single on the Billboard Hot 100 (“Thank U, Next”) and then another with “7 Rings” last month. This week, the singer is attempting to top the Hot 100 for a third time with the song “Break Up With Your Girlfriend, I’m Bored.” Grande’s craftily dedicated fans even instituted a #Boycott7Rings campaign in the hopes of getting listeners to give more streams and sales to its follow-up. According to Billboard, the 307 million on-demand streams for songs from “Thank U, Next” mark the highest-ever one-week total for a pop album; of the Top 20 largest streaming weeks, “Thank U, Next” is No. 9 and the only non-hip-hop album on the list. Also on this week’s chart, No. 2 and No. 3 are both movie soundtracks: “A Star Is Born,” featuring Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper, is in second place ahead of the Academy Awards on Sunday, while “Bohemian Rhapsody” is right behind it. Last week’s No. 1, A Boogie Wit da Hoodie’s “Hoodie SZN” is No. 4 and Post Malone’s “Beerbongs & Bentleys” is No. 5. The album of the year winner at last week’s Grammy Awards — Kacey Musgraves’s “Golden Hour” — re-entered the chart entirely, landing at No. 9 with 35,000 units, including 20,000 in album sales. "
5c618c753a125f5075c0915e,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/11/arts/music/grammys-moments-best-worst.html,"The 61st annual Grammy Awards on Sunday worked to right the wrongs of the past few years’ ceremonies, where the leading narrative was tension over a lack of diversity and poor representation for the most influential young artists in music. Big stars still stayed home — and one of the biggest got cut off mid-speech — but the show corralled a former first lady and delivered many messages of inspirational uplift. Here are the highlights and lowlights as we saw them: Of all the major-category nominees at this year’s Grammys, none were more surprising than Brandi Carlile, the 37-year-old folk-rock — or rockin’ folk — singer and songwriter who earned six nods, including album of the year. But when she appeared on the Grammys stage, things became clear. Her performance of “The Joke,” a defiant anthem about tolerance, was genuinely startling (and vastly superior to the album version). Carlile’s vocals were robust, ragged, full of sneer and hope. On a night curiously light on impressive singing, it was an uncomplicated, genuine, cleansing thrill. JON CARAMANICA [Hear our pop music team break down the Grammy highs and lows.] Drake, who pointedly did not perform on Sunday night, claimed just his fourth Grammy in 42 tries — best rap song for “God’s Plan” — and he deigned to show up to accept it, taking the winner’s podium for the first time. (His previous awards were not televised, and he’s even clowned the show for giving “Hotline Bling” the best rap song trophy in 2017 “maybe because I’ve rapped in the past or because I’m black,” he said.) This time, he pulled a Fiona Apple and told the world it didn’t matter: “We play in an opinion-based sport, not a factual-based sport,” he said, seemingly legitimately nervous. “This is a business where sometimes it’s up to a bunch of people that might not understand, you know, what a mixed-race kid from Canada has to say, or a fly Spanish girl from New York, or anybody else, or a brother from Houston.” It was part motivational speech, part rebuke of gatekeepers, and all Drake, the most famous guidance counselor in the universe. “The point is, you’ve already won if you have people who are singing your songs word for word, if you’re a hero in your hometown,” he added. “You don’t need this right here, I promise you.” But when he gathered his breath to finish the sentiment, the show cut to commercial. Drake was not seen at the Grammys again, and given how hard it was to get him there in the first place, he might not be for a while. JOE COSCARELLI [Want to be heard during the Grammys? Maybe stay home, our critic writes.] If the tensions at last year’s ceremony left the Grammys in knots, Alicia Keys was a CBD oil rubdown: a soothing, self-assured earth mother prepared to “Kumbaya” the show into a place of solidarity and affection. “Do you feel that love in the building?” she announced at the top of the ceremony. “This is love, this is life, this is living, this is light, and all because of music.” She brought out Lady Gaga, Jada Pinkett Smith, Michelle Obama and Jennifer Lopez to speak about music as a vessel for empowerment and empathy. She twirled in a variety of outfits. She joked around with John Mayer and harmonized with Smokey Robinson. She had already logged oodles more screen time than any host in recent memory when she perched on a stool between two grand pianos and played one with each hand in a demonstration of technical badassery, then took a tour through songs she wished she had written (Roberta Flack’s “Killing Me Softly,” Juice WRLD’s “Lucid Dreams,” Kings of Leon’s “Use Somebody”), wrapping on her own Jay-Z collaboration “Empire State of Mind” like a humblebrag come to life. But she still ended the show on a note of grander uplift: “Let’s keep listening and loving each other.” CARYN GANZ [At a ceremony dominated by female performers and presenters, women took center stage.] Flanked by younger admirers for a patchwork tribute, Dolly Parton easily held her own, with her voice still twangy, feathery and persuasive. The start was shaky: Kacey Musgraves too tentative and Katy Perry too vehement before Parton righted the tone of “Here You Come Again.” Miley Cyrus made an admiring rival in “Jolene,” and Cyrus shared three-part a cappella harmony with Parton and Maren Morris in “After the Gold Rush,” a Neil Young song Parton has recorded with Linda Ronstadt and Emmylou Harris. Little Big Town gave Parton an arena-country buildup in the story-song “Red Shoes,” from the 2018 “Dumplin’” soundtrack, before the female-solidarity finale, “9 to 5,” in which Parton made sure to praise her recent songwriting collaborator and producer, Linda Perry, who was leading the band. Parton was all smiles, and all gumption. JON PARELES For a show that has traditionally shunted aside Latin music (leaving it to the Latin Grammys, a separate event altogether) — and has yet to really acknowledge the rising urbano wave — Camila Cabello’s opening number covered a lot of ground. Sure, it was centered around “Havana,” a No. 1 pop hit, but Cabello’s Cuba-via-Miami roots shone through, and she also managed to ground a performance that featured both Young Thug and Ricky Martin. (Guess which one was wearing diamond-encrusted boots.) J Balvin, the pop-reggaeton star from Colombia, popped up for an interlude of his hit “Mi Gente” — and held up a newspaper that read “Build bridges not walls” — while the Cuban-American jazz trumpeter Arturo Sandoval made himself heard throughout. For a show that’s traditionally a ballad-loving affair, the energy was welcome, as was diversity that didn’t just feel like lip service. COSCARELLI [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] Childish Gambino’s “This Is America,” the first-ever hip-hop song to be honored with a Grammy for song and record of the year, is fittingly self-conscious: rapped in clipped, referential phrases, with melodic sections and a smattering of uncredited ad-libs by some of the genre’s true recent innovators (Young Thug, 21 Savage, Quavo, BlocBoy JB). That none of them — including the song’s lead artist and writer, Donald Glover — bothered to show up and accept the trophy for the songwriters was also apt for a show that has long struggled with its handling of hip-hop, dating back to the first-ever rap award in 1989, when a number of the nominees boycotted. (Kendrick Lamar and Drake, the most nominated artists of the night, also declined to perform; the “This Is America” producer Ludwig Goransson accepted the second award.) But the first no-show led to an awkward dead-air moment as the presenters, Alicia Keys and John Mayer, shuffled around the stage, trying to figure out what to do next. One of Childish Gambino’s managers tweeted a shrug emoji. But what really underlined the sharp elbow of a nonappearance was that Glover did appear as part of the Grammys telecast, after all — starring in a cellphone commercial that aired more than once. COSCARELLI “Welcome to the Grammys,” Cardi B proclaimed one hour and 28 minutes into the Grammys, luxuriating atop a jewel-encrusted piano that would make Liberace blink. She started her performance of “Money” in a dramatic cape like a sexy vampire leopard, and ended it sporting a ring of feathers like the baddest peacock on the block. Her set of plush banquets evoked vintage glitz, but 20 dancers doing floor work, four more waving large fans and a flamboyant pianist — Chloe Flower — couldn’t steal attention from the main attraction. When she returned to the stage to accept the award for best rap album, she had switched modes: from swagger to heart. “I can’t breathe,” she said, struggling for a brief moment to organize her thoughts. An entire arena was ready to offer up their lungs. GANZ [See the full winners list.] During the 19-second fingerpicked introduction to the power ballad “Shallow,” Lady Gaga executed two full body hair flips, one side kick and seven exaggerated stabbing motions with her left arm, each punctuating plucks of Mark Ronson’s acoustic guitar. As she sang the verses to the song, the standout from “A Star Is Born,” she acted out seemingly the entire arc of rock stardom: drinking, doing cocaine and torturing a microphone stand. Lady Gaga is one of our most gloriously talented pop stars, and one of the most nerve-racking, because you never know when her tango with good taste will dip into disaster. In her attempt to make this performance of “Shallow” the most everything, she ended up with less. GANZ The first song on Kacey Musgraves’s album of the year winner, “Golden Hour,” is “Slow Burn,” a slightly psychedelic country ballad about how chill she can be — in love, in her career and just in general. Critically respected but largely ignored by the Nashville establishment, Musgraves spent most of Grammys night edging her way, patiently, into the spotlight. Her first appearance, to perform her song “Rainbow,” betrayed some nerves. As part of the Dolly Parton tribute, Musgraves’s hair had gotten bigger but she was still muscled over by a vocally pushy Katy Perry on “Here You Come Again.” By the time she took center stage to accept the show’s final award, though, having won best country album and then beaten out pop stars like Drake, Cardi B and Kendrick Lamar for the top all-genre prize, the Grammys had come to her, and Musgraves delivered a simple, effective moment of gratitude that showed just how easy she is to root for. In a room used to having the air sucked out of it by all sorts of try-hards and egomaniacs, Musgraves just let it breathe. COSCARELLI H.E.R., the shades-wearing singer, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist who won the Grammy for best R&B album, summoned echoes of Prince and “Purple Rain” with reverberating chords from her electric guitar as she sang “Hard Place.” Singers and a string section gathered onstage as the song moved into a gospel-charged crescendo and H.E.R. let loose more expansive, ever more soulful melismas. She wasn’t done until she had flaunted some wailing lead guitar and then eased the song back down, with poised dynamics at every moment — the kind of real-time musicianship the Grammys still hope to reward. PARELES Let’s say up front that Jennifer Lopez is a genuinely versatile talent — a spectacular dancer, an underrated actress, a person who sings. There are numerous ways she could have enlivened any number of parts of the Grammys this year, or any other year. Fronting a Motown tribute, however — yeah, how about no? Lopez did not appear to be singing live at any point during her six-minute-plus performance, to the chagrin of many online, and perhaps also to any of the dozens of R&B singers who could have handled these songs with verve and power. While the dance routines were strong, turning the music of Motown — which featured some of the most vital, urgent vocals in pop music history — into a Busby Berkeley routine was a swing and a miss. CARAMANICA It is nigh impossible to pay full tribute to Aretha Franklin, who had one of the most forceful, nuanced and outrageous voices of the last century. So Yolanda Adams, Andra Day and Fantasia didn’t go over the top on their version of “(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman.” The performance was taut — just three sharp vocalists delivering impassioned singing, paying homage to an icon while silently accepting there are shoes that can never fully be filled. CARAMANICA Miley Cyrus has never won a Grammy. She was not up for one this year. She’s only been nominated once ever. And yet! Cyrus came to play on Sunday, joining Shawn Mendes to make an unnecessary (sleeveless) duet a true power ballad, and then appearing again for a tribute to her godmother, Dolly Parton. Cyrus was loose, but focused; impactful, but not scenery-chewing, and, knowing her nonstop-ness, she probably wanted more. She could’ve torn up that cage with Travis Scott! She could’ve kept “Shallow” earthbound! She could’ve hosted! Bless her. COSCARELLI Some Grammy performances have little to do with music in itself. The recording business owes a lot to Diana Ross, who had dozens of No. 1 hits, turns 75 in March and is still touring this year. What she never got, with the Supremes or solo, was a competitive Grammy award; the Recording Academy came up with a Lifetime Achievement award in 2012. So when she arrived onstage in a regal, gauzy red gown, after being introduced by her grandson, her presence was enough. She got through the retrospective gratitude of “The Best Years of My Life” (despite an ill-advised upward key change) and an arm-waving singalong of “Reach Out and Touch (Somebody’s Hand),” as she strolled through the audience. “Learn, dream, unlock new doors,” she exhorted. “All is possible.” The standing ovation was a cumulative appreciation. PARELES Between a 2014 Super Bowl appearance with Bruno Mars and this Grammy Awards duet with Post Malone, Red Hot Chili Peppers have made themselves symbolic elder statesmen of excess. Excess was the thematic link for a three-part Grammy medley: Post Malone’s acoustic-guitar-strumming ballad “Stay” (recalling a lovers’ quarrel while he was “too drunk to talk”) followed by his singsong, self-censored boasts of overindulgence in “Rockstar” and then the Chili Peppers’ 2016 song “Dark Necessities,” which hints at addiction and self-destructive impulses. Post Malone’s self-satisfied self-pity coupled with the Chili Peppers’ we-can-still-do-this athleticism — the singer Anthony Kiedis ended up shirtless — all played like unintentional parody. Post Malone also made no mention of his collaborator on “Rockstar”: 21 Savage, currently detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. PARELES Janelle Monáe has extensive ideas about cybernetic control vs. sensual abandon; she also has old-school showbiz razzle-dazzle. She combined them all to perform “Make Me Feel,” a song that harks back to the Minneapolis funk of Prince and prime Janet Jackson. Flanked by dancers who were costumed as shiny automatons, she swaggered through the song with robotic twitches, hip-pumping carnality and even some moonwalking, adding a snippet of her gynocentric song “Pynk” and the admonition, “Let the vagina have a monologue!” She earned the mic drop that ended the song. PARELES The Grammys, structurally, still look like they could be filmed in the 1970s. The camera setups are fairly flat, and the performances are tightly controlled. So credit Travis Scott for taking a much-needed wrecking ball to the format. He began his performance with a coolly tempered “Stop Trying to Be God,” backed by James Blake duetting with Philip Bailey (of Earth, Wind and Fire). But then the scene switched: Scott reappeared inside a tall cage rapping “No Bystanders,” and was swarmed by dozens of ecstatic revelers, some of whom began scaling the cage walls. Eventually Scott climbed up, hopped over the top and landed on the outstretched arms of his faithful. For a show that likes to pretend music moves in one direction — from the stage outward — this was a welcome reminder that it can also go up, down, around, and explode in plain sight. CARAMANICA "
5c646f493a125f5075c098a0,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/13/arts/music/ariana-grande-thank-u-next-review.html,"No current pop star is more adept at stoking and channeling swells of online fan curiosity than Ariana Grande. In the past year, she navigated a tumultuous relationship with the comedian Pete Davidson; the death of an ex-boyfriend, the rapper Mac Miller; a public row with the Grammys; and more. In the process, she has become a master of the Easter egg, the clapback, the strategic tweet-and-delete. In the middle of a storm, Grande is cool and collected, hands firmly on the wheel. This comes through in her use of social media, and also in her music and videos. “Sweetener,” an optimistic love-song album released last August, was hot on the heels of her high-octane short-duration romance with Davidson. And the singles leading up to her new album, “Thank U, Next,” aggressively fed the gossip machine, ensuring that just as Grande’s music was reaching its peak popularity, she was also the subject of continuous meta-musical conversation. It is savvy gamesmanship, and an appropriately modern approach to pop superstardom in the age of social media and streaming. And yet that flirtation with tabloid ubiquity is the least interesting aspect of “Thank U, Next,” Grande’s fifth album, which has some hiccups but is still her most musically flexible and au courant release to date. [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] A pure vocal talent who early in her career excelled with songs that gave her singing generous room to breathe, Grande hasn’t always been in close dialogue with the rest of pop music. That has changed now. “Thank U, Next” was reportedly made in around two weeks, and it shows, but in the right ways — there is less deadening polish on the vocal production, and Grande demonstrates a new comfort toying with style and approach. That’s clearest on the album standout, “Bloodline,” which communicates a cruel sentiment — “don’t want you in my bloodline” — with disarming casualness. Produced by the pop hitmaker Max Martin, “Bloodline” has rocksteady breeze, electro sternness and some of Grande’s most in-the-pocket singing. “Thank U, Next” can be split between the songs produced by Martin, both alone and with his regular collaborator Ilya Salmanzadeh, and the rest. The Martin songs are crisp, as always: “Bad Idea” has the urgency and cool of late 1980s pop. “Break Up With Your Girlfriend, I’m Bored” — which includes a riff on ‘N Sync’s most snide anthem, “It Makes Me Ill” — is so bulbous and tart that it sounds jolly. (The other Martin contribution, “Ghostin,” is the album’s only real dud.) It’s in the other songs, however, that Grande takes her most intriguing leaps, largely because of the new fluidity she brings to her singing. As the pop music landscape has shifted to take in the dominance of streaming, it was inevitable that R&B, and also older-fashioned pop, would find their way toward hip-hop. And not in a platitudinous, quick-handshake-while-pinching-your-nose way, but a serious integration — the rhythmic and attitudinal choices that have long been central to hip-hop are becoming essential to artists far outside the genre. And so it has gone for Grande, who has learned to contort her huge voice into the clipped cadences that have defined the hip-hop mainstream over the last couple of years. On “7 Rings,” she’s so convincing with her flow that there was wild disagreement online as to which rapper she was ripping off. (2 Chainz, most likely, but maybe Soulja Boy.) “Fake Smile” takes a different approach to the same idea, opening with the same melancholy soul sample used in the Wu-Tang Clan’s “Tearz”; its rough-hewed urgency is threaded throughout the rest of the song. There are other curious musical choices, as well — the jubilation and saccharine taste of the hook of “NASA” recalls K-pop. And Grande hasn’t totally disconnected from the clarity and spaciousness of her early music, heard here on the pristine “Make Up,” which sounds naïve from a distance but roars with mature desire. That these varying choices all sound comfortable together is the real sign of progress on this album. Its mild disorganization isn’t dissimilar to the direction Rihanna was moving on “Anti.” That was the first moment in which she truly stepped out into uncharted territory, showing off unexpected strengths that had long been hidden. “Thank U, Next” proves that Grande, too, has many other places to roam.

5c61b4fb3a125f5075c091cd,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/11/arts/music/a-boogie-21-savage-billboard-chart.html,"It was a very quiet sales week in the music industry ahead of the Grammy Awards on Sunday night. With no major releases, and no debuts making it to the Top 15, the Bronx rapper A Boogie Wit da Hoodie’s “Hoodie SZN” (Highbridge/Atlantic) returned to No. 1 for its third nonconsecutive week atop the Billboard chart. Driven by steady streams, the album moved a total of 47,000 equivalent units, according to Nielsen Music, combining 68 million digital on-demand song plays and just 398 in traditional sales — a record low in sales for a No. 1 album, beating its own bottom-water mark of 823 from last month. (Neither of the album’s trips to No. 1 in January came during its debut week on the Billboard 200, a rarity on today’s charts.) “I Am > I Was,” the former chart-topper by the Atlanta rapper 21 Savage, climbed back to No. 2 from No. 8, following his arrest on Super Bowl Sunday by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. 21 Savage, whose album added another 40,000 units — with just 839 in sales — in its seventh week out, remains in ICE custody and is facing potential deportation proceedings because the government says he is in the United States illegally. Future’s “The Wizrd,” another recent No. 1, fell one spot to No. 3 this week, with 51 million streams and 1,600 in sales for a total of 40,000 units, while Travis Scott’s “Astroworld” is No. 4 in its 27th week on the chart. The soundtrack for “A Star Is Born,” another chart fixture in recent months, is No. 5 with 38,000 units as the film and album continue their path through awards season. Business should pick up next week: Ariana Grande, who has had two No. 1 hit songs so far this year, released “Thank U, Next,” her second album in six months last Friday, and is poised for another blockbuster debut. And then there’s the Grammys stimulus, which could lead to sales bumps for Sunday night’s stars, like Kacey Musgraves, Brandi Carlile, H.E.R. and Cardi B. Musgraves won album of the year for “Golden Hour,” which peaked at No. 4 last April. "
5c5c90843a125f5075c088d9,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/07/arts/music/jack-white-eurovision-toy-netta.html,"Jack White, the former frontman of the White Stripes, has won many things in his career, including Grammys and MTV Video Music Awards. But this week, he added another, somewhat grander, title to the list: Eurovision winner. Well, sort of. White, 43, was added to the list of composers of Netta Barzilai’s “Toy,” an infectious pop anthem about female empowerment, accompanied by a chicken dance, that won the 2018 Eurovision Song Contest for Israel. “Toy” was widely praised for bringing a fresh direction to the contest. The Guardian said it “reignited Girl Power for the #MeToo generation.” But some pointed out that its chorus had a certain resemblance to the White Stripes’ “Seven Nation Army,” whose main riff is widely used in sports chants. “Let’s hope Jack White doesn’t hear this song before the Eurovision Song Contest” Ben Shalev, the music critic for the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, wrote last March. “He may sue.” In June, weeks after the contest in Lisbon, Universal Music Group wrote to Doron Medalie and Stav Beger, the writers credited for “Toy,” asking them about the resemblance. KAN, the Israeli state radio broadcaster, revealed that an agreement had now been reached, and White had been added to the song’s credits, according to Haaretz. White did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday. Amnon Szpektor, who was head of media for Israel’s entry in 2018, said the agreement included a confidentiality clause, and so neither Medalie nor Beger could comment. Netta was also unavailable, he said. “That’s a hole she would not want to fall in,” he added. This year’s Eurovision is scheduled to be held in Tel Aviv in May, and there are already calls for a boycott from some supporters of Palestinians, especially members backers of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, known as B.D.S.

5c5876873a125f5075c07f0f,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/04/arts/music/backstreet-boys-dna-billboard-chart.html,"The last time the Backstreet Boys had a No. 1 album, in fall 2000, CD sales were at their commercial peak and iTunes did not exist; even “American Idol” was still two years away. Since then, of course, the music business has been transformed. CDs are now a mere niche, and positions on Billboard’s weekly album chart are largely determined by billions of clicks on streaming services, each worth just a fraction of a penny. But this week, the Backstreet Boys — its five members now well into their 30s and 40s — benefited from the music industry’s last-ditch strategy to move CDs: concert-ticket sales bundles. Following in the footsteps of Ariana Grande, Travis Scott, Bon Jovi and the Dave Matthews Band, the Backstreet Boys offered fans copies of their latest album, “DNA” (K-BAHN/RCA), with tickets to their summer tour. That deal helped sell 227,000 copies of “DNA” in the United States last week, according to Nielsen. Back in 2000 that amount would have barely made a dent; the Backstreet Boys’ “Black & Blue” sold 1.6 million copies in its first week on sale that November. But in the chart’s new math, sales of complete albums now carry far greater weight than any single click. So even though “DNA” had just 6.6 million streams, the album sales put it far ahead of any other release this week, with 234,000 total “equivalent” album sales — a measurement that factors in complete album sales as well as streams and downloads of individual tracks. By comparison, the latest album by the rapper Future, “The Wizrd,” had a healthy 69 million streams in its second week out, yet only 3,000 sales as a full album, yielding an equivalent number of just 56,000. “The Wizrd,” last week’s chart-topper, fell to No. 2. Also this week, A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie’s “Hoodie SZN” holds at No. 3, Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper’s “A Star Is Born” soundtrack is No. 4, and Weezer’s latest untitled album — this one known as the “teal” album, with covers like Toto’s “Africa” and TLC’s “No Scrubs” — is No. 5.

Let us know at theplaylist@nytimes.com and sign up for our Louder newsletter, a once-a-week blast of our pop music coverage. The fuzztone is cranked way up on “Lo/Hi,” the first Black Keys song since 2014. It’s the kind of garage-boogie stomp that the band never left behind. Singing about desperate loneliness and 180-degree mood swings, the Black Keys reach back to a late-1960s combination of primordial three-chord simplicity (hinting at Norman Greenbaum’s “Spirit in the Sky”) and overdubs galore. Between the group handclaps, a gang of guitars and the whooping, wailing backup vocals, it’s a far cry from the early Black Keys’ two-man-band austerity — but with the old wallop intact. JON PARELES A folky waltz tells the story of an adolescent romance, deploying details with a concision akin to Paul Simon: “Morrissey apologists, amateur psychologists, serial monogamists, we went to different colleges.” There’s no happy ending, and Phoebe Bridgers’s production surrounds the acoustic guitars with distant, shadowy strings that hint at the song’s higher stakes. PARELES Lauren Mayberry, frontwoman of the Scottish band Chvrches, has a voice that’s tart, serrated and soaring — it cleanly pierces through everything around it. That makes it a sleek, albeit unexpected, complement to the production of Marshmello, whose music is restlessly and relentlessly dopey. On “Here With Me,” Mayberry is a beacon of reason, singing with ramrod posture while the song wiggles and wobbles behind her. JON CARAMANICA “And I haven’t lost my mind thinking about you/And I haven’t lost my breath shouting all the things we’re about to do,” sings Helado Negro — Roberto Carlos Lange — in “Pais Nublado” (“Clouded Nation”), a subdued bossa nova with an electronic penumbra from his new album “This Is How You Smile.” His songs are often bilingual in English and Spanish and built on electronic underpinnings, though “This Is How You Smile” welcomes acoustic guitar as well. The album muses on desire, Latinx identity, change and rhythm, hinting at places where history and politics have intimate repercussions. PARELES The drummer and composer Kendrick Scott will release an album next month titled “A Wall Becomes a Bridge,” featuring his long-running quintet Oracle (plus the turntablist Jahi Sundance on about half the tracks). Scott invests seriously in the ancient ideal of music as a healing force, and the notion that through focus and attunement, he might create sounds that resonate with our particular moment. He’s one of more consistent bandleaders in instrumental music today, with original music that feels consequential and distinguished in spite of its adherence to an airtight, contemporary-jazz aesthetic. With Joe Sanders on bass, Mike Moreno on guitar, Taylor Eigsti on Fender Rhodes and John Ellis on soprano saxophone, Oracle douses your ear in textures that are thick but aerodynamic, and on “‘>>>>>>>>>>>Mocean” Ellis’s liquid melody cuts against Scott’s constant patter, feeding the band two different kinds of fuel. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO Why wouldn’t the guitar on “Who Shot Cupid?” rest somewhere between flamenco, new age and early emo? Juice WRLD has become one of the most promising figures in hip-hop by almost completely dismantling the genre’s usual structures. That’s plain throughout his new album “Death Race for Love,” but the thickly layered moaning vocals on this song — “All the drugs I did, they weren’t worth it/now I'm worthless/I hope my new lady thinks I'm perfect” — show just how far Juice WRLD is able to bend hip-hop, turning it into something soft, interior and elegiac. CARAMANICA An album of newly unearthed recordings by the Texan songwriter Townes Van Zandt (1944-1997) rightfully makes “Sky Blue,” a previously unknown song, its title track. It’s a terse, low-fi, solo, fingerpicked glimpse of chronic despair: “No good reason to be livin’/Been lookin’ high and low,” he sings. PARELES In his decade-long country music career, Justin Moore has been rabble-rousing and retrograde, a stern guy and a goof. Finally, he’s found a song that captures both sides of his duality. “Jesus and Jack Daniels” is delivered with a smear of Randy Travis stoicism — mom parents via the good book, and dad via the bottle: “When we messed up she’d fill us up/with the scripture and a Baptist hymn/and she’d pray we’d be a little more like her and a whole lot less like him.” CARAMANICA The music is an elegantly melancholy bolero. But the words to “Temes” (“You Fear”) are a challenge, defying a machismo that pretends to be romantic but is actually about maintaining power, sometimes violently. “If my freedom is your dispossession/and my body is the recipient of your whim/If my shadow is behind your figure/Why do you fear me?” iLe (Ileana Mercedes Cabra Joglar) sings. And in the desolate video clip, she pulls herself together after a sexual assault. PARELES Backed by Soundwalk Collective, Patti Smith recites dire words by Antonin Artaud about how “A mortal folly comes over the world.” Her tone is steadfast, as if partaking in a ritual; she sings like a stoic lullaby when she reaches the lines, “Here where the mother eats her sons/Power eats Power: Short of war, no stability.” Around her, Sound Collective constructs a pyre of creaky, echoey fiddle lines and drumbeats that build to an apocalyptic rumble. PARELES Like many of Carla Bley’s melodies, the tune to “Ida Lupino” is a simple, songlike thread, snaking through a set of chord changes that gradually tweak the pressure around it, thickening the air and then letting things go slack again. On this version, by the young jazz combo Lioness, Amanda Monaco daubs at single notes on her guitar, painting little shapes around the alto saxophonist Alexa Tarantino’s dewy, unhurried treatment of the melody. Underneath, the drummer Allison Miller keeps a steady beat going, hardly deviating from her cool, eighth-note pattern, even when sparks momentarily start to fly. RUSSONELLO "
5c51d6153a125f5075c0721e,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/30/movies/peter-jackson-beatles-film.html,"The director Peter Jackson, known for the “Lord of the Rings” and “Hobbit” trilogies and the new WWI documentary, “They Shall Not Grow Old,” has a new project on his hands: an archival documentary on the Beatles. The film, which is still untitled, will cull from roughly 55 hours of never-released footage of the band’s 1969 studio sessions that led to their final album, “Let It Be.” The announcement of the movie comes on the 50th anniversary of the Beatles’ final show, that much loved performance on a windswept roof in London. [How Peter Jackson Made WWI Footage Seem Astonishingly New With “They Shall Not Grow Old.”] “This movie will be the ultimate ‘fly on the wall’ experience that Beatles fans have long dreamt about,” Jackson said in a statement. “It’s like a time machine transports us back to 1969, and we get to sit in the studio watching these four friends make great music together.” The footage of the new film will be restored with the same techniques Jackson and his producers used during the making of “They Shall Not Grow Old.” The project has been approved by the former band members Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr, as well as Yoko Ono Lennon and Olivia Harrison, the widows of John Lennon and George Harrison. The “Let It Be” recording sessions were captured in an accompanying 1970 documentary by Michael Lindsay-Hogg, which highlighted the group’s tenuous relations leading to their breakup. Once Jackson’s movie is released, the Beatles’ management company, Apple Corps Ltd., will also rerelease the original 1970 film. "

There’s an insistent, syncopated pulse — but no drumbeat — behind “Jerrod,” an invitation to a timid lover from Solange’s new album, “When I Get Home.” She offers openness, intimacy and sharing: “Give you all the things that I want,” she promises, her voice nestling amid chromatic chords that refuse to resolve; her vocal phrases ride directly atop the bass line, then pull away. Nothing feels solid until the song segues into the next track, “Binz,” and the drums arrive. JON PARELES Like the birds returning from down south and the trees finding new color, the first Drake verse of 2019 heralds the coming of spring and, with it, the hope of new options on the horizon. Not the forced choices of cold-weather confinement, but the chance to seek out what you really want. On the original “Girls Need Love,” Summer Walker sang about her cravings with lethargic swing. On this remix, Drake arrives, the recent 10-year anniversary of his genre-reframing mixtape “So Far Gone” on his mind and on his tongue, to try to make amends on behalf of the less sensitive sex. “Arched back, deep stroke, white wine, weed smoke/that’s my best combination” he starts the flirt rapping, then downshifts into cooing. And this is the real spring awakening: a performance reminiscent of when his rejection of the boundaries between tender and tough was still raw. JON CARAMANICA A blur can be more tantalizing than something fully legible. Jackie Mendoza’s “Seahorse,” from an album due April 26, melts the edges of her vocals with echoes, reverb and stereo panning, while keyboards and guitars float in and drift around her. There’s a pop song near the surface, but it stays just out of reach. PARELES Angst wrapped in mockery surrounded by pop-history allusions with deniable lyrics bonded to endearing melodies — yes, Weezer has released a new album called “Weezer” with a parenthetical color (The Black Album). “High as a Kite” treats its cliché title seriously: “Miles above it’s so serene/I’m letting go of all the troubles that I’ve seen,” Rivers Cuomo sings, putting a yearning tone in his voice. The track summons the orchestral stateliness of late-1960s Beatles and Beach Boys alongside bird calls and distorted lead guitar, flaunting craft and keeping its attitude guarded. PARELES Justin Faulkner has a thrashing, teeming style on the drums — he attacks them — yet he exudes a reassurance that basically all the best drummers have. In striking that balance, he’s like Art Blakey and Elvin Jones. It might have something to do with the fact that Faulkner has effectively been taking a seminar in the music’s lineage for the past 10 years as the youngest member of the pre-eminent saxophonist Branford Marsalis’s quartet (he’s still only 27). On “The Secret Between the Shadow and the Soul,” the group’s third album featuring Faulkner, he shows he’s gone from being the most startling thing about this quartet to the best thing about it. RUSSONELLO Four banjo-wielding songwriters — Rhiannon Giddens, Amythyst Kiah, Leyla McCalla and Allison Russell — reckon with the history of slavery, particularly women’s slavery, on the album “Songs of Our Native Daughters,” drawing on slave chronicles and minstrel songs as well as contemporary perspectives. In “Moon Meets the Sun,” they harmonize in a song of tenacity, cultural survival and willed optimism: “Ah, you put the shackles on our feet but we’re dancing,” Giddens sings. “Ah, you steal our very tongue but we’re dancing.” PARELES This is going to sound meaner than intended but: think Wilson Phillips meets the Chainsmokers. CARYN GANZ “Footsteps,” the song that opens Kehlani’s new mixtape “While We Wait,” holds the lingering afterthoughts of a breakup, with apologies, justifications and regrets from both sides. The underlying beat is slow enough to make room for fitful, asymmetrical vocal lines, while backup vocals arrive to multiply the second guesses. “When I walked away I left footsteps in the mud so you could follow me,” Kehlani and Musiq Soulchild sing at the end, even as their melodies diverge like separate paths. PARELES The latest high-concept album from the electronic duo Matmos, arriving March 15, is “Plastic Anniversary,” which derives all of its sounds from plastic: tapped, plucked, rubbed, scraped, flexed, blown through like horns. “Breaking Bread” is constructed from samples of breaking and broken LPs by the group Bread. It goes for the comic, with a steady syncopated bounce, Caribbean-tinged riffs and an artificial zoo-full of squeaks, chirps, scrapes and plunks. Another track from the album, “Thermoplastic Riot Shield” — played on a clear shield emblazoned “Police” — is far more ominous. PARELES In May the first album from L7 in 20 years, the first album from Sebadoh in six years and the first album from Bad Religion in six years will all be released. All three bands started putting out music in the late 1980s, hit creative peaks in the 1990s and were never beholden to the record industry. Good news: Everyone remembers how to sound like themselves. GANZ “The Creator Has a Master Plan” is spiritual jazz’s signature piece, a glistening two-chord chant that’s like a warm aloe cleanse. Its own creator, the nonpareil tenor saxophonist Pharoah Sanders, has been performing “Master Plan” for the past 50 years. When Joey DeFrancesco decided to venture into spiritual-jazz terrain on his new album, “In the Key of the Universe,” the virtuoso organist was wise enough to enlist Sanders. All of this album is good, but most of it keeps contact with DeFrancesco’s bop comfort zone. Not “Master Plan.” It becomes the album’s highlight, almost inevitably. RUSSONELLO Jason Palmer’s “Rhyme and Reason” is the first release from Giant Step Arts, a nonprofit dedicated to giving underappreciated but visionary jazz musicians the support they need to make quality live albums. Palmer is a perfect first subject for this: He’s a thrifty improviser with a vast dynamic range and an ambitious composer, but he’s hardly known. On “Herbs in a Glass,” the album’s opener, he propels his band mates (the tenor saxophonist Mark Turner, the bassist Matt Brewer and the drummer Kendrick Scott) through a squirrelly nine-beat rhythm; the odd, open-ended meter ends up pushing his intense melody into the plain air, giving it a billowy freedom. RUSSONELLO Sitting at the Jazz Gallery recently as Anna Webber led a septet through the tunes from her latest album, “Clockwise,” I wrote down a lot. Here’s a little of it: splitting and scraping her tones … descended from hocketing and Western choral music and the World Saxophone Quartet and Battle Trance … Teutonic syncopation. Webber is a composer, saxophonist, flutist and more, with big ears and a bustling career underway. “Clockwise” is her first release for Pi Recordings, and a convincing one. It’ll certainly speed your mind up. RUSSONELLO "
5ca7d93449f0eacbf1f8144c,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/05/obituaries/kim-english-dead.html,"Kim English, whose melismatic vocals and spiritual perspective anchored more than a dozen house-music hits that reverberated in dance clubs beginning in the 1990s, died on Tuesday in Chicago. She was 48. Ms. English’s longtime manager, Vickie Markusic, confirmed the death. The specific cause was unknown, she said, but Ms. English had kidney failure and had been on dialysis for years. Dance music’s euphoria and church music’s rapture have been conceptual relatives for years, but Ms. English’s joyful 12-inch singles often made the connection explicit, speaking plainly about her Christianity and soaring with the fervor of gospel music. Like house music itself — a form of electronic dance music that emerged in the early 1980s — Ms. English was born in Chicago. But she became best known through her relationship with New York garage, a strain of dance music that embraced lush production and melodies more amenable to gospel and soul. Her breakthrough was “Nite Life,” a 1994 12-inch disc given a luxurious mix by the New York garage producers Masters at Work and a harder-edged remix by Armand Van Helden. It became an enduring club staple, with Ms. English singing like Dorothy Gale back in Kansas but still dreaming of Oz: “I’m trying hard to find this place again/Lord knows, I’m glad at least I’ve been.” From 1999 to 2007, with singles like “Unspeakable Joy” and “Everyday,” Ms. English scored eight No. 1 hits on Billboard’s club/dance chart, more than chart-topping dance notables like Daft Punk, Calvin Harris and New Order. Ms. English was born on Sept. 6, 1970, to Annie (Herron) English, a schoolteacher, and Ronald English, a corrections officer. She went to high school at Kenwood Academy in Chicago, studying under the famed vocal teacher Lena McLin, whose students have also included the opera baritone Mark Rucker and R. Kelly. On the list of more than 20 influences on Ms. English’s Facebook page, Ms. McLin appears first. In the early 1990s, the Chicago house D.J. Gershon Jackson brought Ms. English to the attention of the vocalist Byron Stingily of Ten City, a Chicago trio of vocalists, songwriters and producers that combined house and R&B. “Her voice actually reminded me, very much so, of Anita Baker’s voice,” Mr. Stingily said in an interview. “And to hear that smoky alto voice on a dance song, it was just so unique and so different at the time.” Her career as a dance diva took off when Mr. Stingily gave a copy of the Ten City/English collaboration “Nite Life” to Little Louie Vega of Masters at Work, who passed it along to the New York club label Nervous Records. “I did know right away the song had something special,” Mike Weiss, a founder of the label, said in an interview. “And once I knew that Masters at Work were going to be doing the remix, then it really was an automatic for me.” Masters at Work (Mr. Vega and Kenny Gonzalez, known as Kenny Dope) were in-demand remixers, and “Nite Life” was licensed to Polydor in Britain, where it hit the Top 40. In America, where house music was still an underground phenomenon, it was played at Mr. Vega’s small but influential Underground Network party at the Sound Factory Bar in Manhattan. Mr. Weiss said that Ms. English’s first live performance was there, in 1994. “And she did it in front of the key individuals and all the key tastemakers in the house music community,” he added. “She really wasn’t so comfortable onstage, and it was really putting someone in the spotlight without having had any experience in the New York community — but she did great. The song was so strong that as soon as she sang the chorus, everyone started singing along.” The Armand Van Helden remix took “Nite Life” to another level in Europe, according to Mr. Weiss. Soon, thanks to mixes and remixes, Ms. English’s voice was being matched with house heavyweights like David Morales, Mood II Swing, François K and Todd Edwards. Ms. Markusic said that once Ms. English’s production deal with Ten City was over, she wrote more of her own songs. Her first No. 1 club hit, in 1999, was a song she co-wrote, “Unspeakable Joy,” a Maurice Joshua production full of church organs and gospel-choir harmonies. In it, Ms. English testified, “When I wake up, in the morning, gets me out of bed/Keeps me running, skipping, jumping like a little kid.” “As her career and her writing got more developed, she did push more and more toward the religious base,” Mr. Weiss said. “She also wanted to have the word ‘God’ in the songs. I’m very open-minded when it comes to religion, but I did feel like having ‘God’ in a song all of a sudden, you might limit the audience a little bit.” Ms. Markusic said that for Ms. English, religion had been inseparable from music: “Every single one of the songs that she’s ever put out, whether people know it or not, they’re all related to God.” Ms. English is survived by her parents; her son, Christopher Raymond; and her brothers, Eric, Richard and Ronald. Her marriage to Kevin Raymond ended in divorce. After her last No. 1 single, “My Destiny,” in 2007, Ms. English became a full-time student at Purdue University. She earned a bachelor’s degree in child and family services and joined the historically black sorority Zeta Phi Beta. She remained active in both music and church, singing in the choir of the Family Christian Center megachurch in Munster, Ind. She was performing her own music live as recently as last year. “Kim’s mission has always been to minister to people through music,” Ms. Markusic said. “I’ve seen some amazing stories. I’ve been in situations where I’ve been in a club and had one of the club kids come up crying to Kim about how she saved her life from suicide.” Mr. Stingily put it this way: “She didn’t want to do any music that was not uplifting.” "

Offset’s marital troubles with Cardi B sent him to the celebrity doghouse, but he’s lately re-emerged in search of a public rebrand — devoted husband, committed father and newly introspective rapper. The title track of his solo album, “Father of 4,” is a plea for understanding directed toward his young children. He lists them off, explains how he’s done them wrong, then promises to do better. CARAMANICA The Haitian band Lakou Mizik, which was formed after Haiti’s catastrophic 2010 earthquake, has remade the New Orleans standard “Iko Iko,” a pop hit (for the Dixie Cups and others) based on half-understood Mardi Gras Indian chants that may have Haitian roots. Lakou Mizik added lyrics in Haitian Kreyol proclaiming the Haiti-New Orleans connection; the 79rs Gang, a Mardi Gras Indian alliance, sings the New Orleans chants. Hooting horns from Haiti’s rara carnival tradition mix with the Preservation Hall Jazz Band; there’s percussion from all sides and an earth-moving bass. Mardi Gras is March 5; the cultural cross-pollination, and the party, continue. PARELES The Oscars are Sunday, which means you only have a few days to absorb all the covers of “Shallow” from “A Star Is Born,” including this sharp late entry from Jimmie Allen and Abby Anderson, young country singers with R&B inclinations, who harness the song’s raw power and shellac it with a layer of controlled cool. CARAMANICA The music in “The Barrel” is folky and straightforward, circling through four chords fingerpicked on an acoustic guitar behind Aldous Harding’s demure voice. The words are the conundrum: cryptic, imagistic and distinctly wary of some undefined commitment: “Looks like a date is set/Show the ferret to the egg/I’m not getting led along.” And the video clip, with some surprises near the end, gives nothing away. PARELES On her new album, “Intuition: Songs from the Minds of Women,” the vocalist Alicia Olatuja chose a wide range of songs written by female artists — from Joni Mitchell to Angela Bofill to Imogen Heap — and set about making a new imprint on each. Her album-closing rendition of “This Woman’s Work,” by Kate Bush, features nothing but Olatuja’s luminous, classically trained voice overdubbed a handful of times, wound together in an airy, a cappella arrangement. Bush’s version was an intimate mash-up of ’80s pop and folk song and musical theater; Olatuja has found a way to honor what made it so distinctive, while creating a whole new sound.

(and briefly before that, Kraftwerk), has collected a boxed set of his solo work, including previously unreleased tracks like this one from the score for the 2015 film “The Robbers.” It unfolds methodically, with an octave-bouncing line somewhere between bass riff and mantric melody; three-and-a-half minutes in, some clanking, chattering electronics arrive to give it precisely the lift it needs. PARELES The hypnosis continues. Gunna remains the most clever and intuitive rapper of the post-Young Thug generation, and on “Baby Birkin” — a standout from his new “Drip or Drown 2” — he circles again and again to a rhyme scheme that bleeds across the conventional bar structure, making the final syllable of each phrase into a de facto leadoff rhyme. The result is you never quite know if you’re coming or going, if the end is in front of you or just behind. It’s intoxicating. CARAMANICA Norah Jones has been collaborating widely lately, flexing genre boundaries; this track will be on an album collecting those experiments. “Just a Little Bit” leans toward jazz and Minimalism, with the meticulous Brian Blade on drums carrying a syncopated pulse as Jones sustains a drone on organ and ornaments it sporadically on piano. Her voice is approachable as always, but what she is singing is more confrontational. “I’m not the one you can refuse/I’m not your plaything, I’m not your muse.” Rightfully: This is not a time to take women for granted. PARELES One of the great disappointments of the tail end of the SoundCloud rap boom is how thoroughly its anarchic instincts have been all but wrung out of it. Sometimes, when you hear Lil Pump rap, he sounds like … a regular rapper. Which is fine, of course, if less fun. “Harverd Dropout” is his first full-length album, and while it features successful collaborations with Kanye West, Lil Uzi Vert, YG, 2 Chainz, Quavo and others, it’s most impressive when an awareness of the rest of the world is filtered out. Take “Vroom Vroom Vroom,” an agglomeration of interjections, sound effects, bass throbs and more, slapped atop each other chaotically. It’s exuberant fun, a return to the moment when what Lil Pump and others proposed was a new idea, a radical notion, an essential urge. CARAMANICA Contemplating the optimism of space travel and discord on Earth, Bruce Hornsby delivers a swinging, Minimalistic chamber-pop hoedown, an Aaron Copland-tinged romp with yMusic’s horns and strings ricocheting all around Hornsby’s percussive piano clusters. It’s genial and upbeat, but far from complacent. PARELES The tenor saxophonist Chris Potter, the drummer Eric Harland and the keyboardist James Francies lock into a big-boned, contemporary-jazz groove about a minute into “Hold It,” and you start to hear voices crowding the room. It’s almost all Potter, overdubbed on top of himself, before the dubs drop out and he launches into one of his characteristically herculean solos. This track is from “Circuits,” a new album announcing a fresh band, but one that harkens to the electrified, funk-fusion group Underground, which Potter led about a decade ago. Nowadays, jaw-dropping technical displays are the norm for Potter, but this band can still get something new out of him. RUSSONELLO This full-length song from Tierra Whack keeps things minimal, as she sings and raps over a two-bar, two-chord loop, plus or minus a drumbeat. In an assortment of voices, none of them all that perturbed, she severs her ties to a guy who’s selfish, stingy, dishonest, unfaithful and distracting her from her career. “I don’t wanna work it out,” she informs him, “so cancel our gym membership.” PARELES Here's the thought process behind a breakup, telescoped into five minutes by the three sisters in Teen. It's exposed at the start — a piano, a beat, a voice — with lyrics like “I don’t know why I still pretend that you could still be, maybe, my man.” Then, as details emerge about past conflicts and current letdowns, synthesizers join the chords and the sisters add harmonies to conclude, “I can’t pretend any more.” It's heartsick and triumphal at the same time. PARELES On his new album, “Preminger Plays Preminger,” the tenor saxophonist Noah Preminger honors his great-uncle, the director Otto Preminger, whose noir films were often known for their use of poignant, haunting music. (Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn famously scored “Anatomy of a Murder.”) With help from a stellar, acoustic-jazz quartet, Noah covers pieces from the old movies’ soundtracks, as well as some original compositions inspired by them. “For the Man with the Golden Arm” — an outtake left off the album, which was released on Friday to Newvelle Records subscribers — falls into the latter category; the saxophonist channels the circumspection and the longing of the 1955 film’s original soundtrack into a watery, wandering melody. Preminger overdubs multiple tenor saxophone parts, which paddle around each other and rest gently on Jason Moran’s rippling piano accompaniment. RUSSONELLO "
5c40f20d3a125f5075c04fdf,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/arts/television/masked-singer-costume-designer.html,"A peacock, a hippo, a monster and a unicorn each take to the stage, performing choreographed moves while belting pop tunes like “Don’t Stop Me Now” and “Oops … I Did It Again.” No, you didn’t eat one too many edibles. You’re watching “The Masked Singer,” Fox’s new competition series that pits 12 extravagantly costumed celebrities against each other. An adaptation of a South Korean series called “The King of Mask Singer,” the American version debuted earlier this month to an audience of more than nine million viewers. Because the identity of each famous participant is kept secret until the contestant is voted off the show, “The Masked Singer” can’t rely on the spectacle of their star power. (The host Nick Cannon, along with the celebrity panelists that include Jenny McCarthy and Robin Thicke, are low-wattage at best.) That’s where costume designer Marina Toybina comes in. A four-time Emmy winner, Toybina got her big break working on Britney Spears’s 2007 music video, “Piece of Me,” and has since collaborated with other A-list pop stars, including Ariana Grande, Taylor Swift and Miley Cyrus. And remember when Katy Perry was famously upstaged by two anthropomorphic dancing sharks during her 2015 Super Bowl halftime show? Toybina deserves much of the credit for the joy that Left Shark brought to our lives. Toybina spoke to The New York Times about her knack for idiosyncratic animal outfits and creating full-body costumes that won’t suffocate the person inside. (Hint: hidden fans.) These are edited excerpts from the conversation. If you saw what I was wearing right now, you’d probably die. I work from home. Girl, I just had a newborn. I’m in, like, two robes. I feel you. You seem to have carved out a niche for yourself as a creator of elaborate viral animal costumes. First, the infamous sharks for Katy Perry’s Super Bowl halftime show; and there were a couple of designs you did for Pink’s 2018 tour that involved some very realistic animal masks that look somewhat like the ones on “The Masked Singer.” Somehow, they’re all coincidences. Going back to the Super Bowl, that was a pretty incredible experience. It was the first time I’d ever dealt with puppetry, so we had to figure out how to start from scratch and learn the entire process day by day. Then in the beginning of last year, I did the costumes for Pink’s tour, and the idea was to have this very avant-garde forest scene where it’s like, half human, half animal. So there were masks involved there, which was like my trial-and-error before “The Masked Singer.” After designing Pink’s tour, two months later I got a call from one of the producers of the show and she sent me the original concept. I watched a few episodes and I was like, “Oh my gosh, we just did this.” Everything I’ve learned in the past five, 10 years led me to figure out how to do this show. So you don’t have a secret animal fetish. No, not at all! To be honest when I got the call I was just like, “What is happening with all these animals?” The costumes almost reminded me of Julie Taymor’s animals in the Broadway version of “The Lion King” — it’s almost just a suggestion of the animal, rather than a literal rendering. The idea was always to combine the elements of fashion with costume. So the costume part of it becomes the mask, and the fashion part of it became the outerwear. It wasn’t so literal. The deer that I created almost looks like a soldier. We put a lot of details into aging the jacket and creating the elements of this character. Every character had some sort of world that they lived in. I’m such a big fan of movies and the one thing I haven’t really done in my career is film. I was able to introduce everything that I was inspired by — “Donnie Darko” and “Edward Scissorhands” had a huge influence on the rabbit costume. The whimsical side of Narnia had a little bit of an influence on the lion and the unicorn. How did you conceive of the designs for the show? Did you first come up with the costumes and then the contestants chose which ones they liked? Or did they have more input? All the artwork was done before the casting, and once we were working with the casting, the producers and I we were able to figure out which 12 we wanted to keep. From there it was more collaborating, letting some of the cast members possibly choose their own costume or us hearing who’s being cast and thinking, “This would be a perfect costume for this person.” Somehow it just magically worked, even though it was trial and error. It sounds like you have really good karma! Usually when you sketch a 2D design, you do a lot of alterations to it when you start building the costume. If you look at the original sketches for the show versus the costumes that are onstage, we barely had any changes. I think it gave our celebrities, the famous behind-the-mask personas, a little bit of freedom to play around and become these characters because what they saw on paper is exactly what they look like onstage. It almost became like an inner-child experience for a lot of these people, an alter ego — to go out, cover their faces and become this character and truly have fun with it. I think that’s what made this show come to life. How do your designs differ from those on the Korean version? The one difference is how anime some of the [Korean-designed] masks were. I wanted to bring something that was a little bit more of a 360[-degree] mask that really hid our talent and embodied all these characters. A lot of the Korean elements had this extravagant mask and extravagant shoulder piece but then everything else was kind of toned down. We created fuller costumes, head-to-toe characters. One of my favorite designers is [Alexander] McQueen and I made sure the lion and the unicorn had this couture-y drape work that you don’t even see anymore. I think both fashion and costuming, the art of it is slowly going away. You see more and more digital work in film, in music videos. It was important for me to design this show the old-school way. It was important to do it all by hand. Does anyone ever complain that their costume is too heavy or difficult to move around in? Of course — you know, a costume is a costume. The difference between the stuff you buy at the store and a costume [is] you are going to have weight. You are going to have extra protection, extra seams, extra material, extra linings. But we were able to adapt different ways for the costumes to be removed so they can breathe. Everything from the way they were constructed was considered — breathing mechanisms, putting fans inside of masks, putting fans inside of the monster costume. Just making sure that we can circulate oxygen. Do you have a favorite costume? It’s hard to choose one but as far as intricacy I think the lion would probably be the one that took the longest to figure out, and a lot of heart and soul went into that one. What is your ultimate career goal as a designer? My biggest dream is to do film. I would absolutely love to work with someone like Tim Burton. Looking at movies like “Mary Poppins [Returns]” or “The Nutcracker [and the Four Realms],” that’s something I would love to do. So, a trippy adaptation of a beloved classic.  If these characters on the show could be part of Marvel, that would be amazing. "
5c3cf5a33a125f5075c045cf,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/arts/music/a-boogie-wit-da-hoodie-billboard-chart.html,"How many albums do you need to sell to reach No. 1 on Billboard’s chart? This week, the number is 823 — along with 83 million streams, that is. Those are the numbers for “Hoodie SZN” (Highbridge/Atlantic), by the New York rapper A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie, the latest and most extreme example of the disparity that now exists in the music industry between the still-rapid growth of streaming and the cratering business of old-fashioned album sales. Billboard and Nielsen credit “Hoodie SZN” with the equivalent of 58,000 sales in the United States last week, a number that incorporates streams and downloads of individual tracks, as well as sales of the full album. But the vast majority of that composite number is from streaming — so much so that the sales number represents a new low on the chart. The 823 copies of “Hoodie SZN” that were sold last week — all as downloads, since that title has not been released on any physical formats — is the least number of copies that any album has sold in the week it went to No. 1. It tops a record set just the week before by 21 Savage’s “I Am > I Was,” which sold 3,481 copies and had 84 million streams. These numbers reflect a business that has become so dominated by streaming that CD sales are all but disappearing, except with a handful of superstars like Taylor Swift and Adele, or when they are bundled with concert tickets. The Recording Industry Association of America reported that for the first half of 2018 (the most recent figures it has published), streaming represented 75 percent of all retail sales revenue in the United States, while physical formats were just 10 percent. During those six months, only 18.6 million CDs were sold in the United States, a decline of 47 percent from the first half of 2017. Before Billboard began to incorporate streaming numbers in its album chart, in 2014, the lowest sales number for a No. 1 album was 40,478, set by Amos Lee’s “Mission Bell” in February 2011. The rest of this week’s Top 10 is, for the most part, just slightly reshuffled from the week before. 21 Savage’s “I Am > I Was” fell to No. 2, the “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse” soundtrack is No. 3, Meek Mill’s “Championships” is No. 4, and Post Malone’s “Beerbongs & Bentleys” is in fifth place. After the Queen biopic “Bohemian Rhapsody” won best drama at the Golden Globes, Queen’s “Platinum Collection” rose 127 spots to No. 10. "

5c6ac96a3a125f5075c0a44e,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/18/arts/music/kacey-musgraves-grammys.html,"If you ask Kacey Musgraves — the country singer-songwriter who won four Grammy Awards last Sunday, including album of the year — how her week has been, you’ll get a pretty good idea of her default manner. “Mehhh,” she said playfully over the phone Friday evening, after a few days of letting it all sink in. “I’ve had better.” Her tongue-in-cheek deflection spoke to the shock that a progressive, psychedelic-drug-using Nashville misfit from Texas could have beaten Cardi B, Drake and Kendrick Lamar for what remains the highest annual honor in music. [See how Kacey Musgraves made the “Golden Hour” song “Slow Burn.”] “Golden Hour,” Musgraves’s third major label album, was critically beloved, but had barely been embraced by country radio — still the genre’s mainstream driver — and was far from a smash. Ahead of the Grammys, the album had totaled about 310,000 in sales, compared to many millions for the favorites in the top categories. Still, in addition to her first album of the year, Musgraves won Grammys for best country album, best country solo performance (“Butterflies”) and best country song (“Space Cowboy”), bringing her career total to six. In Musgraves’s first interview since her Cinderella moment, the singer reflected on this year’s Grammys, her place in the Nashville scene and what’s to come. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. Congratulations on a big night. How have you been celebrating? Lots of R & R time. Definitely happy moments with the team, but also celebrating with food. Enjoying having some burgers — note the plural nature. My husband and I had some down time together — spa time, which is a way that I like to take a break. But I’m already back to a week of shows. And how did you celebrate that night — did you go hard or just crash at the hotel?  I went really hard at Fatburger. I’m not like, hugely into an after-party scene, usually. I kind of like celebrating on my own terms. But we did stop by. And then afterward, not only did I have a fried chicken sandwich doused in buffalo sauce, but I also had a cheeseburger with jalapeños on it, and I ate both, 100 percent, and fries. I sat there and ate it in the restaurant in my Valentino dress. I went straight from shaking Mick Jagger’s hand to having a fried chicken sandwich in my hand. What do you remember about the moment your name was called for that final award? Disbelief, in general. But weirdly, a sense of calmness. Leading up to an award like that, you have a little hope, I think, that maybe you’ll win. But I was fine with not winning because it was just such a crazy compliment to be nominated alongside such giant albums. Huge albums that garnered lots of attention, lots of sales, lots of radio play. So you can hope that you may have a small chance, but I definitely was nowhere near banking on anything. It was a really beautiful moment, and I was somehow able to find the words to get out what I wanted to say. I don’t think it’s something that you can process until way later. Who’s the funniest person who has contacted you to say congratulations? Any heroes, exes or elementary-school enemies? Definitely some randoms. Nothing too crazy. No exes, for sure. [Laughs] Six Grammys now — where are you going to put them all? Well, I’m a little limited on shelf space at the house — we have a small house! I was thinking maybe I’ll give one to my grandma. One for my parents to keep. Maybe one in the car — on the hood of the car, so everyone knows. Any standout Grammy moments from behind the scenes? If you could’ve seen us quick-changing into my Dolly Parton outfit and giant hair in a matter of seven minutes, that would’ve been something to see. If I would’ve just walked away from that night having just performed with Dolly, that would’ve felt like the win of a lifetime for myself, because she is the ultimate, as far as I’m concerned. Obviously the Grammys got some flak last year about its representation of women, and this year was an attempt at a makeup. How do you think the show did? I think the Grammys definitely made up for last year’s lack of female representation, but the credit also has to go to the women who are the ones making the art. You never want to think that there’s a crazy influx — a 180 from last year — because of [tokenism]. It would be a shame to feel that way. But in this case there were a lot of really beautiful pieces of work released. So I’m not going to think about it that much. You haven’t always been embraced by the Nashville establishment. Were you surprised that you cleaned up in the country categories? Country music itself and the Nashville community have always shown me great support and love from the beginning. When I first moved to town, about 11 years ago, I got a giant education from the Nashville songwriting community. I made a ton of friends, I worked really hard for years there before I was even an artist myself. So I feel really connected to that community, and I feel like they do have my back. That’s a whole different side of Nashville. The other side of it is country radio, which has its own problem with women. Do you expect them to look at you differently now? It’s been really amazing to see “Rainbow” have such a positive response on all genres of radio after the awards. Like I’ve said from day one, this album and none of my albums are created specifically for that end-goal, but if it ends up there, I’m more than grateful. Can we expect a new album in 2019? My goal, in general, is just to be able to stay somewhat inspired by something, and to be able to tap into some kind of creative vein. So I will go poke around and see if I can catch some kind of creative wind, songwise, at some point soon. There are a couple songs that I really like. I have no idea where that’s going to go, but that’s the fun of it — exploring until you can find something to start packing into the next snowball. "
5c72bb7e3a125f5075c0b46e,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/24/arts/music/peter-frampton-tour-illness.html,"The rock guitarist Peter Frampton said on Saturday that he was planning to issue a double album this summer, his first release in three years. He hinted at another mysterious project in the works. And he said he was going to go on tour for about 50 dates across the country. Yet Saturday’s most significant news was what Frampton, the British star best known for “Frampton Comes Alive!,” one of history’s best-selling live rock albums, revealed as the sobering motivation for his musical frenzy. In two interviews released on Saturday, one with CBS News and one with Rolling Stone, Frampton, 68, said he had a degenerative muscle disease called inclusion body myositis, also known as I.B.M. The disease causes muscles to weaken over time but generally does not affect life expectancy. His condition will not affect his singing voice, Frampton said, but it could slow his fingers and his ability to move around. “In a year’s time, I might not be able to play,” Frampton told Rolling Stone, adding, “I want to record as much as I can in the shortest space of time.” A publicist for Frampton said he could not be reached Saturday evening. Frampton became the lead singer and guitarist for the Herd at 16, and two years later co-founded Humble Pie. His popularity in the United States skyrocketed after the 1976 release of “Frampton Comes Alive!,” a double album that has sold more than 17 million copies. It features songs like “Baby, I Love Your Way” and “Show Me the Way.” Frampton did not always receive the critics’ praise, but he has played on albums by George Harrison and David Bowie, and in the 1970s he helped popularize the talk box, a device that creates the effect of a “talking” musical instrument. The Musicians Hall of Fame, which inducted Frampton in 2014, has called him “one of the most celebrated artists and guitarists in rock history.” Frampton recounted to Rolling Stone a series of warning signs regarding his health: He noticed tightness in his ankles about eight years ago, and there were times his legs felt weak; four years ago, he fell while trying to kick a beach ball off a concert stage; shortly after, he tripped over a guitar cord onstage; and he could not easily put things in overhead compartments on airplanes. Frampton told Rolling Stone that for four years, his children and his band knew about his diagnosis, but that he did not tell anybody else. He said that there was no traditional medicine to treat inclusion body myositis, but that he was exercising every day and hoped to participate in future drug trials. He said he thought the time was right to reveal his condition to the public because his talents may soon ebb, hence the new album and the announcement of the tour, which he is calling the “Peter Frampton Finale — The Farewell Tour.” He said that he may tour in Europe in the spring of 2020, but that this summer’s tour will most likely be his last. Frampton declined to elaborate much on his double album, and said he probably would not play “Frampton Comes Alive!” straight through on the coming tour. Frampton told Rolling Stone that $1 from every ticket sale on the coming tour would go toward a fund he had started with Johns Hopkins University to research myositis. “Maybe a huge door is closing in my life, but then there’s lots of other doors that open,” he said. He told CBS that the condition had already affected his fingers but that he could still play guitar well. “If I’m going to do a farewell tour, I want to play good,” Frampton said. “I want to rock it. I know that this tour, I will be able to do everything I did last year and the year before. That’s the most important thing to me. I want to go out screaming as opposed to, ‘He can’t play anymore.’” "

But now, once those holiday playlists stop streaming, it becomes just another slow week on the charts. The rapper 21 Savage has the No. 1 spot on Billboard’s album chart for a second time with “I Am > I Was,” with the equivalent of about 65,000 sales in the United States, according to Nielsen. That includes 84 million streams and a little more than 3,000 copies sold as a full album. Overall, the album lost 51 percent of its momentum from its opening week. With no major new releases last week, A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie holds at No. 2 with “Hoodie SZN,” while most of the rest of the Top 10 is also filled with recent rap hits: Meek Mill’s “Championships” is No. 3, Post Malone’s “Beerbongs & Bentleys” is No. 4, and the “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse” soundtrack — featuring Post Malone, Lil Wayne, Juice WRLD and others — is No. 5. Michael Bublé’s “Christmas,” which had reached as high as No. 3 this season, fell to No. 148 with a 91 percent decline in streams, while Mariah Carey’s “Merry Christmas” fell 173 spots to No. 181.

Just want the music? Listen to the Playlist on Spotify here (or find our profile: nytimes). Like what you hear? Let us know at theplaylist@nytimes.com and sign up for our Louder newsletter, a once-a-week blast of our pop music coverage. A couple of months ago, Ariana Grande explained her new strategic philosophy to Billboard: “My dream has always been to be — obviously not a rapper, but, like, to put out music in the way that a rapper does.” Which is to say not on a traditional tightly-controlled pop star rollout, but in the drip-drip-drip fashion of the streaming era, in which artists bombard listeners with music in rapid succession, barely leaving room to reflect. And yet the period leading up to the release of “Thank U, Next,” Grande’s fifth album, which was released on Friday, hasn’t been quite that radical. There were singles, and videos, and now an album — nothing to fear here. The latest single is “Break Up With Your Girlfriend, I’m Bored,” a satisfying thumper with an astral-trap beat and Grande deciding that, in fact, she’d like to be the other kind of rapper as well. Not to say that she’s purely rapping on this song, but rather that rapping as an act has melted so thoroughly that the chasm between what it currently is and what Grande is doing here isn’t very vast. So much so that when she belts out a few lines near the song’s end it sounds like someone else altogether has arrived. (Grande spends the whole video stalking a couple made up of a handsome young man and a Grande doppelgänger. She keeps urging them to split, up until she inserts herself between them, and then she chooses … herself.) JON CARAMANICA “We don’t touch anymore/But we talk all the time so it’s fine,” sings Amber Bain, who records her solo, intricately produced pop as the Japanese House. She’s assessing the later stages of a romance: “Somebody tell me what I want/‘cause I keep on changing my mind.” She surrounds herself with synthesizers and vocal harmonies that can reflect the dizzying swirl of remembered infatuation or the steady trudge of everyday partnership; when the song ends, she still hasn’t figured things out. PARELES A path to solace is indirect and uncertain in “Noise,” the first release from the Brooklyn-rooted songwriter Zsela (whose father is Marc Anthony Thompson, a.k.a Chocolate Genius). Her voice is sumptuous and her phrasing is curvaceous and conversational in “Noise,” a hushed ballad that moves with the rhythm of breathing, not machines. Its backdrop subtly shifts from the sparsity of a lone electric piano to subdued orchestral instruments, and its chords start out unresolved and move in and out of hymnlike uplift, as she ponders the breakups of others and her own: “Cannot count the ways you used to love me,” she muses. “But I can count the ways you used to try.” JON PARELES How sensitive can a guy be? This sensitive. “Can’t we just talk/figure out where we’re going?,” Khalid pleads. There’s a tryst, with “flowers in the room,” but also a reckoning; whatever happens will have to be consensual. The loop has hi-hat sounds and syncopated synthesizers — from Disclosure — as Khalid hops between tenor and falsetto. The result of this negotiation isn’t guaranteed. PARELES Cool-kid pop made by the kids hiding out under the bleachers, “Homework” is a soothing, crypto-melancholy anthem about reflecting on young love. Kim Petras has a warmly synthetic voice, and lil aaron raps in a reassuring tone — together, they’re a sweet, effective pair, delivering teen-flick coming-of-age sparkle with little flickers of gone-too-far darkness. CARAMANICA This ghostly whisper of a waltz is from “Quiet Signs,” the new album by Jessica Pratt. Like the rest of the album, the backup is minimal — acoustic guitar picking, a few notes from a piano — and the production’s low-fi hiss makes Pratt’s soprano even wispier. She sings about singing in “Crossing,” with words dissolving into wordless syllables, turning into an elusive lullaby. PARELES The trumpeter Christian Scott aTunde Adjuah’s pieces often feel like something more than songs, or at least outside of them. They’re like a film composed only of long and powerful shots: The music starts intense and grows more so — comfortable at a steadfast medium tempo, not needing a lot of harmonic movement to swell and push onward. On “Ancestral Recall,” the title track from Scott’s forthcoming album, the focus is squarely on the drums and percussion, which maintain a rabbling, six-beat groove adorned by little more than a ghostly synthesizer and Scott’s scorching trumpet. Then there’s the poet Saul Williams, uttering lines that unpack the tune’s title: “Earth as my hard drive, sky as my witness/There’s no such thing as small spirits, ancestral minorities/Take breath through nature’s hidden forces.” GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO Bassekou Kouyate, from Mali, plays the ngoni, a West African lute that’s a likely ancestor of the banjo, and he leads Ngoni Ba, featuring ngonis of various sizes down to a bass ngoni. “Miri” (“Dream”), the title track of his new album, is an instrumental reverie based, the liner notes say, on worries about Mali’s Islamist insurgency and about climate change. Its fingerpicked vamp carries insistent minor-key melodies and a little bit of ngoni shredding. PARELES A New Orleans jazz band — clarinet, trombone, her own banjo — backs Leyla McCalla in the title song of her new album. The wryly old-fashioned slow-drag setting belies the hardheaded economic realism of “The Capitalist Blues,” a theme statement for an album full of songs about trying to get by in a ruthlessly market-based world. “I am swimming in an ocean of sharks,” McCalla sings, graceful but resigned. PARELES More cheerily melodic tragedy from the Savannah, Ga., rapper Quando Rondo, who is signed to the imprint of the Baton Rouge realist YoungBoy Never Broke Again. In its production, “Gun Powder” has some of the lighthearted toughness of the early T.I./Young Jeezy era, but the real amusement is in how Quando Rondo almost smirk-shrugs his way through some very bitter words: “Send a text to all the opps like, yeah, we want all the smoke/We up by 6, they down by 2, they need to go fix the scope.” CARAMANICA Miho Hazama, a Japanese-born, classically trained composer, is starting to make waves in New York. On Friday she released “Dancer in Nowhere,” her latest album with m_unit, an ensemble combining typical elements of a jazz big band with strings, vibraphone and French horn. The title track starts with the violins in a tentative, prickly dance, before the tenor saxophonist Jason Rigby alights, playing a repetitive melody — unresolved but deeply satisfying — over a bed of strings and horns. A heavier, more percussive section barrels in, with a melody derived from the original line. The song ends back on that soaring first passage, the band playing faster now and Rigby improvising into the beyond. RUSSONELLO With the slow, misty grace of a requiem, “Memories of Nanzenji” finds the keyboardist and crossover-jazz guru Mark de Clive-Lowe reflecting on a visit to the historic temple and gardens in Kyoto, Japan. Featuring a quintet that includes the whirling alto saxophone of Josh Johnson, this tune appears on “Heritage,” a new album out on Friday. It was largely recorded during a run of shows at the Blue Whale in Los Angeles, then de Clive-Lowe augmented the recordings in the studio, adding layers of synthesizer and more. RUSSONELLO I’m old enough to remember when 5 Seconds of Summer was a punk band! I’m old enough to remember when the Chainsmokers were … well, not quite good, but not this bad! If you are less old than I am, here is a song to order Sweetgreen to. CARAMANICA "
5c893a9349f0eacbf105cde7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/13/science/moon-rocks-nasa.html,"Later this year, NASA will reveal never-before-seen morsels of the moon, the agency announced on Monday. The astronauts of the Apollo missions that landed on the moon from 1969 to 1972 collected 842 pounds worth of lunar rocks, core samples, pebbles, sand and dust. Many of those samples were later opened on the ground. But three have remained sealed — their contents stashed away for nearly 50 years. They were intentionally saved for a time when more advanced technology would allow planetary scientists on Earth to delve deeper into the moon’s mysteries. “The technology available in the ’60s and ’70s wasn’t able to do what we can do now,” said Jessica Barnes, an astronomer soon to join the University of Arizona’s Lunar and Planetary Laboratory. “Now we can go to a mineral and we can look at the very fine details, down to almost the width of a human hair.” [Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar.] In a year marking the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 landing, and with American space priorities shifting toward a return to the moon, NASA has at last decided that it’s time to open the long-locked samples. The agency selected nine teams to study the moon rocks in detail. For the past decade, Charles Shearer, a scientist at the University of New Mexico, has pressed NASA to unseal the rocks. He was thrilled by the news: “We are completing the Apollo mission adventure after 50 years, using new types of measurements and new views of our moon.”  Darby Dyar, a scientist at Mount Holyoke College, agreed. She first studied lunar samples in 1979, as an undergraduate, and has come full circle as a leader of one of the selected teams. Dr. Dyar and her colleagues will scour materials from Apollo 15, 16, and 17, searching for yellow, orange and green glass beads roughly the size of a grain of salt. Those beads formed when the droplets within fire fountains — picture an Old Faithful of lava — hit the lunar atmosphere and cooled. “Imagine spraying a squirt gun of hot lava,” Dr. Dyar said. “Because the droplets are so tiny, they cool immediately.” And those cooled droplets, or glass beads, are a treasure trove for scientists. They provide a window into the interior of the moon, and could answer fundamental questions about how our nearest neighbor evolved. The moon’s history is a common theme in many of the selected projects. Kees Welten, a scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, and his team will study a core collected by Harrison Schmitt and Gene Cernan, the Apollo 17 astronauts, in order to better gauge the impact history of the moon. That can be used as a proxy for other planets in the solar system (including Earth) whose craters long-ago disappeared. Other teams are looking toward the future. Dr. Barnes and her colleagues will analyze four rocks collected from the same site where Apollo 17 landed. Chemically, the samples are very similar to one another — except one was chilled to -20 degrees Celsius within a month of return. It has remained in cold storage ever since. But scientists are unsure whether freezing the samples is a better storage method than keeping samples at ambient laboratory temperatures. By comparing the chilled sample with the room-temperature samples, the team will be able to assess the frozen curation technique for the first time. “We’ve never had the opportunity to do this kind of study,” Dr. Barnes said. “It’s a unique chance to get at a currently unanswered question that’s really important for future sample return missions.” Those missions include a Japanese spacecraft, Hayabusa2, which currently is collecting samples from the Ryugu asteroid; an American spacecraft, Osiris-Rex, which will collect samples from the Bennu asteroid; and future missions to the moon and Mars. Clive Neal, a scientist at the University of Notre Dame who will work with Dr. Shearer on another team, said that preparing for future missions to the moon makes it important to open the lunar samples now. “We did have the technology 10 years ago, but we didn’t have the drive,” Dr. Neal said. “Now, we’re going back to the moon and we need to use lunar resources in order to do it sustainably.” That was made possible in 2008, when scientists discovered that the moon was not bone dry, but contained water. With water, future astronauts might be able to quench their thirst, and they also will be able to split its molecules into oxygen, to breathe, and liquid hydrogen, to refill their fuel tanks — thus helping sustain a lunar outpost. But scientists can’t yet pinpoint how much water is on the moon, Dr. Neal said: “That starts with this particular project of these unopened Apollo samples.” "
5cb210ba49f0eacbf1f83c5a,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/13/movies/guava-island-review-donald-glover.html,"Even as details were finally released earlier this week about “Guava Island,” the secret project that Donald Glover debuted at Coachella in advance of its Amazon Prime premiere Saturday, there was some confusion as to what exactly it would be. It’s not a “visual album,” in the style of Beyoncé’s “Lemonade” or Janelle Monáe’s “Dirty Computer,” nor is it a feature-length jukebox narrative, à la “Purple Rain.” (It runs just shy of an hour.) But if we learned anything from Glover and the director Hiro Murai’s previous collaborations on the FX series “Atlanta,” it’s that they don’t mind if their work is difficult to classify — if anything, they seem to revel in it. Dubbed a “tropical thriller” by Amazon, “Guava Island” has the formal ingenuity and freewheeling tonality of “Atlanta,” but Glover and Murai are playing in a very different key here. If anything, it’s an expansion, musically and stylistically, of “This Is America,” the much-seen and much-discussed Murai-directed music video for Glover’s musical alter ego, Childish Gambino. (The song is remixed and restaged here.) But the overall approach is lighter and poppier, appropriate to the tropical setting. Glover’s co-star, Rihanna, narrates the opening sequence, an animated history of the island framed as a folk legend and bedtime story, with a dash of fairy tale: she explains how young Deni (Glover) would come to her window every night to sing to her, as if she were some kind of Caribbean Rapunzel. Now a struggling musician, Deni dreams of writing a song that will unite his people, though they seem a fairly close-knit community already — it’s the kind of place where everyone bids him a cheerful good morning as he hustles to the first of his many jobs, singing jingles on the radio. But it’s not all a fairy tale; the ruthless Red Cargo (Nonso Anozie, from “Game of Thrones”) rules the island with an iron fist, and machine gun-slinging men patrol his factory floors. The plot of “Guava Island” is as thin as the Judy Garland-Mickey Rooney musicals of its distant heritage: Deni has planned a secret all-night music festival (not unlike, say, a secret musical film), but its attendees would consequently not work on Sunday, which is deeply unacceptable to Red Cargo. He offers Deni $10,000 to cancel the event, explaining, “I’m in charge of the people of this island. I have to do what’s best for everyone.” No prizes for guessing whether the show goes on, though the consequences of that decision carry more weight than usual. Thus, it’s one of those stories where the musical numbers are “realistic” (kinda, sorta) because the protagonist is a musician, and Murai takes thankful pains to work the songs into the fabric of the narrative. Yet there’s not as much music as one might expect, considering the pedigrees of its stars. Aside from Deni’s radio songs, there are only a handful of musical numbers, most of them reworking existing Gambino tracks. (Rihanna, even more surprisingly, doesn’t sing at all.) But there’s real juice to those sequences, which include a lovely, beachside rendering of “Summertime Magic” and a concert performance of “Saturday” that manages to stage the kind of joy that’s spontaneously captured in the best concert documentaries, like “Wattstax” and “Dave Chappelle’s Block Party.” Onstage, Deni frames his event as “a celebration of life — I want everyone here to feel as free as you possibly can tonight,” and above all else, “Guava Island” is a paean to the pleasures of taking it easy. “We live in paradise,” Deni fumes, “but none of us have time or means to actually live here!” Glover has pinpointed “Purple Rain” and “City of God” as the film’s key influences, but it’s also filled with echoes of the 1973 Jimmy Cliff vehicle “The Harder They Come,” another story of an island musician’s brushes with the criminal underworld. The casually gorgeous, sun-soaked photography apes that film’s grainy, 16-millimeter aesthetic (the cinematographer is Christian Sprenger, who also shoots “Atlanta”), and delivers a timeless, throwback quality; if not set in the past, the picture is rooted in a world that’s stuck there, where no one has a smartphone and everyone still listens to the radio. The film’s primary shared attribute with “Atlanta” is its cockeyed, eccentric worldview, a matter-of-fact acceptance of everyday absurdity. (When Deni is kidnapped and taken to see Red Cargo, he’s sternly told to make a nametag.) That approach proves adaptable to the thriller elements, particularly considering Glover’s gift for reactive comedy — he can get a laugh with something as simple as a shifted gaze or even a dumbfounded deadpan. Rihanna, rather depressingly, has little more to do than to be “the girl”: inspire Deni with her beauty, worry about his safety, and (the oldest and moldiest of tropes) try to decide when and how to tell him she’s pregnant. It’s a dispiriting waste of such a fiery, complicated performer. But she and Glover have movie-star chemistry and charisma to burn, and Murai knows to lean into the glorious, off-the-cuff moment when she succumbs to her love’s pleas and dances, ever so briefly, alongside him. Letitia Wright, so frisky and engaging in “Black Panther,” likewise doesn’t get much to do, but the chillingly affable Anozie makes the most of his minimal screen time. “Guava Island” was made in Cuba, and a remote, location shoot with a chummy, insular crew could have resulted in an Adam Sandler-style throwaway, merely an excuse for a paid vacation in a sunny locale. But in this light, playful effort, the offhanded breeziness is a feature, not a bug. The script is by Glover’s brother Stephen, also of “Atlanta,” but the story is credited to both men and three more “Atlanta” writers. And that tracks; it feels very much like a movie a bunch of friends thought up late one night, perhaps while sharing a blunt, as a party was winding down. This is meant as a compliment. "
5cb066b549f0eacbf1f8349d,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/12/movies/guava-island-movie.html,"When Donald Glover and the director Hiro Murai collaborate on a new project, expectations are naturally sky high. After all, Murai has directed many of the key episodes of Glover’s Emmy-winning series, “Atlanta,” as well as the music video for “This Is America,” the Grammy-winning song Glover recorded as his musical alter ego, Childish Gambino. But with their first feature-length effort, “Guava Island,” you had the sense that Glover and Murai were trying to play down those expectations. The film, which comes in at a brisk 54 minutes, was shot in Cuba last year and kept under wraps until this week. That isn’t easy to do when your star is so famous and his love interest is played by Rihanna. [“Guava Island” was released after Donald Glover’s Coachella set as Childish Gambino.] And though any film festival in the world would have coveted Murai’s first feature, “Guava Island” instead debuted Thursday night at the Coachella campgrounds in California, where Glover will headline the site’s music festival as Childish Gambino. Shortly after his set concludes on Friday night, the film is to begin streaming on Amazon, starting Saturday at 12:01 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time. So what is this mystery project about? “Guava Island” is a music-driven fable that follows Deni (Glover), a happy-go-lucky singer who believes that music has the power to unite the squabbling citizens of his tiny island. He promises his girlfriend, Kofi (Rihanna), that he can write a song as beautiful as she is, though Kofi is skeptical. “No song is that beautiful,” she boasts. (Letitia Wright, a.k.a. Shuri in “Black Panther,” also appears, but she doesn’t have many lines.) The plot is slight: A shady island tycoon named Red (Nonso Anozie) tries to prevent Deni from putting on a music festival, reasoning that if people go see the young man perform that night, they’re liable to skip work at Red’s sweatshops the next day. And though Rihanna doesn’t have much to do as Glover’s girlfriend, the two at least share a spiky chemistry: Glover is eager to please, while Rihanna remains ever hard to impress. [Read the NYT review of “Guava Island.”] But the main attraction here is something that had been kept secret until Thursday night’s screening: Glover uses “Guava Island” to restage and remix some of his biggest recent songs. “America is a concept,” Deni tells his fellow workers before leading them in a rendition of “This Is America” that finds new context for many of the video’s familiar, unsettling dance moves. Other musical sequences are set to Childish Gambino songs like “Saturday” and “Summertime Magic,” which is repurposed as a beachside serenade for Rihanna. (Alas, she is a mere spectator instead of Glover’s duet partner.) Glover has said that “Guava Island” was inspired by films as disparate as “Purple Rain” and “City of God,” though it also shares a restless creative ambition with recent visual albums from Janelle Monáe and Beyoncé. Monáe will perform just before Glover on the Coachella stage Friday night, while Beyoncé dominated the festival last year with a career-spanning performance captured for her coming Netflix documentary “Homecoming.” For top-tier artists looking to make a grand statement, there remains no place like Coachella. But as “Guava Island” shows, sometimes you can say just as much about your intentions by springing a sly surprise on the way. "

The actor and musician, who performs as Childish Gambino, will also release “Guava Island,” a long-rumored movie that Glover and Rihanna filmed over four weeks in Cuba. [Read about our first look at the project.] Directed by Hiro Murai, a frequent collaborator with Glover on the series “Atlanta” and the Grammy-winning video for “This Is America,” “Guava Island” will debut at Coachella on Thursday in a specially constructed theater, according to a news release. It will be available to stream for free on Amazon for 18 hours, from 3 a.m. to 9 p.m. Eastern on Saturday, and will then remain available for Prime Video members. It will also stream on Twitch at 8 p.m. on Saturday and will continue to be shown at Coachella throughout the festival, the release said. “Guava Island” also stars Nonso Anozie (“Game of Thrones”) and Letitia Wright (Shuri in “Black Panther”) and was written by Glover’s brother, Stephen. The secretive project has been the subject of speculation since last summer, when a photo of Glover and Rihanna was posted online. Other than another image posted by Glover and Amazon’s short trailer, little is known about the movie’s contents; a report in Vanity Fair described it as “an hourlong, music-driven film” inspired by the 2003 movie “City of God,” set in Brazil, and by Prince’s “Purple Rain.” “I’m really humbled having the opportunity to present something this timely and timeless,” Glover said in the release. Murai called the shoot a “crazy fever dream of a production” over “four incredible weeks spent in Cuba,” the release said. "
5cad171949f0eacbf1f821b7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/09/movies/amazing-grace-aretha-franklin-sydney-pollack.html,"Late in 1971, some unlikely news spread among the Southern California Community Choir in Los Angeles. Aretha Franklin was coming to town to record a live gospel album in January, and 25 of its members would be backing her up. The group was led by one of the most famous gospel figures of the era, the Rev. James Cleveland, but its singers were local churchgoing Angelenos. Mary Hall, an alto, was 22. “The reverend just said, ‘You be at rehearsal, and you be at rehearsal,’” she said in an interview last month. “I couldn’t believe I was getting ready to sing with the Queen of Soul. It’s still one of the greatest moments in my life.” That moment — an electrifying two-night session before live audiences at the New Temple Missionary Baptist Church in Watts — resulted in Franklin’s “Amazing Grace,” the best-selling gospel record in history, featuring now-canonical arrangements of gospel standards like “How I Got Over” and “What a Friend We Have in Jesus.” Less known until recently was that the performances were also filmed: a collaboration as ambitious and as bungled as only Hollywood could manage, buried for decades by red tape and a monster technical error. But with last weekend’s wide theatrical release of “Amazing Grace,” fans can finally immerse themselves in the full cinematic experience. [Read our review, in which Wesley Morris calls “Amazing Grace” “one of the great music films.”] The project sprouted at the confluence of several cultural currents at the beginning of the 1970s. Edwin Hawkins’s R&B crossover hit “Oh Happy Day” had helped bring gospel into mainstream in 1969. And by 1971, Franklin, who had grown up as a touring gospel singer, was one of the biggest stars in pop music, with a list of hit singles including “Respect,” “Think” and “Chain of Fools.” If anyone could capitalize on that moment, it was Franklin, then 29. Having signed a few years earlier with Atlantic Records, she teamed with one of the label’s star producers, Jerry Wexler, who had helped catapult the careers of artists like Ray Charles and Wilson Pickett. The plan was to make a double album. “Jerry was smart enough to understand that it would be a statement as to her imprimatur as an artist,” said the producer Alan Elliott, who worked for years to resurrect the film. “And he empowered her by making her his co-producer.” Plans for a concert film were also underway: Documentaries like “Monterey Pop,” by D.A. Pennebaker (1968), and “Woodstock,” by Michael Wadleigh (1970), had become cultural phenomena. Executives at Warner Bros., which had purchased Atlantic in 1967, hoped an “Amazing Grace” documentary might help do for gospel what Woodstock had done for pop, Elliott said. To film it, Warner hired the director Sydney Pollack, a rising star still riding the success of his 1969 movie “They Shoot Horses, Don’t They?” Pollack was between projects and had campaigned with executives for the job. Joe Boyd, who had been hired by Warner to pair Atlantic artists with Warner film projects, had already been tasked with putting together a 16 mm film crew. He shared his misgivings with executives about using Pollack. “Shooting a concert film is a very different kettle of fish from shooting a drama,” Boyd said in an interview, relating what he told Warner. “And it’s a very different skill.” But Pollack’s star power won out. Boyd took his cue. “I kind of stood back and let it happen,” he said. [Read more about why the film lay buried for nearly a half-century.] Franklin and her team busied themselves with the music. Rehearsals started a month in advance at Cornerstone Institutional Baptist Church, in Los Angeles, where James Cleveland, a childhood mentor of Franklin’s, ran the show. Franklin was to provide a rhythm section, flown in from New York, many of whom had been members of King Curtis’s band, including the drummer Bernard Purdie, the bassist Chuck Rainey and the guitarist Cornell Dupree. Cleveland was to provide his choir and accompany Franklin on piano. He hired a charismatic 27-year-old named Alexander Hamilton to direct the choir. Hamilton said that Cleveland had hired him in part for his “steel trap” memory. “I would ask Aretha what she was definitely trying to get in the song — certain licks that she wanted to do,” he said. “She would say where she wanted the licks, and when, and I would make sure that it happened.” The resulting performance was transporting, Pollack’s footage a visceral, unmediated document of a music freighted with suffering and bursting with joy. Sweat and tears stream down Franklin’s face. Cleveland sobs. Old women bolt from their seats, convulsing in the aisles. As word of Franklin’s presence spread, the modestly sized audience of Night 1 swelled past capacity inside the sweltering church on Night 2, spilling into the aisles. The Rev. C.L. Franklin, her father, hurried to Los Angeles for a front-row seat — and to deliver a lengthy speech. The renowned gospel singer Clara Ward sat next to him in a sequin dress. Mick Jagger and Charlie Watts of the Rolling Stones, who shared a label with Aretha Franklin and were in town working on “Exile on Main Street,” also stopped by, inching their way toward the front as the session progressed. But just as Boyd feared, Pollack and his crew made a critical error. They failed to use clapperboards, according to multiple people involved in the production, which meant the footage couldn’t be synchronized with the sound. Pollack hired Hamilton to lip-read the footage in attempts to match it. But not even Hamilton could sync more than a small percentage. The team gave up after about six weeks, Hamilton said. “They hadn’t prepared for it to be what it turned out to be,” he said. The session had simply become too chaotic. “The place became electric.” Elliott, who had worked as a music producer under Wexler, first learned about the footage from him in 1990 and had never forgotten about it. In search of a new project, Elliott acquired the assets from Warner Bros. Films in 2008, with Pollack’s blessing. Pollack, who died that same year, never saw the film completed. With advances in digital technology, Elliott was soon able to synchronize the footage. But there was another roadblock: Franklin herself. Publicly, she said she loved the film. But she sued multiple times to prevent its being seen. Rainey, the bassist, who said that he talked to Franklin twice a year by phone until she died last year, said she told him that she didn’t like the film at all. He thought her resistance derived from a feeling that the film wound up being more about style and celebrity than about the music or the worship — or even about Franklin. “The film, to me, is all about James Cleveland, her father, Clara Ward,” he added. “It was like she was wallpaper.” As the legal complications persisted, Elliott appealed to Franklin’s niece Sabrina Owens, the executor of Franklin’s estate, in search of support inside Franklin’s family. Owens was enthusiastic. After Franklin’s death, a path was cleared, and the film received a limited release in late 2018. “The moment I saw the film for the first time three years ago, I knew others needed to see it,” Owens said. Hall, the choir singer, had always thought so. “This shows how we sang in our churches,” she said. “And for young people that never got to hear Aretha and see Aretha — to know the quality of how masterful she was in her gift, and to know how she loved God — it’s very important for people to see that.” "
5c545f153a125f5075c078f1,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/01/arts/television/kelly-rowland-gladys-knight-bet.html,"Kelly Rowland has been hearing it for almost as long as she’s been singing. “Always, when I meet somebody, they’re like, ‘Oh man, you look like a young Gladys Knight,’” she recounted. “Well, she’s lovely to me — a beautiful woman. So I definitely love the comparison.” And so apparently does Knight. “It’s no secret that I love my @kellyrowland,” Knight posted on Instagram in October 2016. “So many people have said that Kelly would be the perfect person to star in my biopic.” So when Rowland was asked to portray Knight in “American Soul” — a new BET drama about the evolution of Don Cornelius’s “Soul Train” — “I wondered if somebody was creeping through Gladys’s comments,” Rowland said. “I was beyond flattered because she had such an illustrious career, and I just wanted to soak her up.” Starting last fall, Rowland pored over vintage YouTube clips to help capture Knight’s essence for “American Soul,” debuting Feb. 5, which follows Cornelius as he hitches his wagon to her star in preparation for the show’s syndication on Oct. 2, 1971. The result is a groove down the “Soul Train” line as Rowland channels Knight, swaying in a glittering black evening gown alongside the fast-stepping Pips, in “I Heard It Through the Grapevine”; wrapped in gold knee-high gladiator sandals for “Friendship Train,” which the group performed on that inaugural episode; and seated alone at a piano in a poignant rendition of Knight’s signature song, “Midnight Train to Georgia.” Rowland’s own career skyrocketed in her teens alongside Beyoncé in Destiny’s Child, which in 1998 displayed its own coordinated outfits and synchronized moves on “Soul Train.” And she hasn’t left music behind: In November she released the self-love single “Kelly” as a teaser to a promised album, her first since “Talk a Good Game” in 2013. In a phone interview from Los Angeles, where she lives with her husband, Tim Weatherspoon, a talent manager, and Titan, their 4-year-old son, Rowland, 37, spoke about channeling a legend and the politics of the Super Bowl. Here are edited experts from the conversation. Did you grow up watching “Soul Train”? Oh, I absolutely did. “Soul Train” was one of my first memories of watching all these different beautiful black people dancing and having a good time, and that was just a moment for me. I remember wanting to dress like the women who had expressions of self and freedom. I remember watching so many different girl groups — was it En Vogue or SWV? — and them just making it look so fun. And I would emulate the dancers, whether it was pop locking or jumping from that one platform and landing in the splits. How intimidating was it playing the Empress of Soul? It wasn’t intimidating until I remember watching one performance of her doing “Midnight Train to Georgia.” And it was of course with the Pips, and they’re on a dark stage and she has a beautiful dress on, and it’s just so effortless. From all of her movements to the different inflections in her face, I sat there and just studied it for days and days and days. She’s an effortless voice, an effortless talent, and I think that’s what people have always loved about Gladys. Did you try to mimic her voice? There is only one Gladys Knight, and I completely love and respect her, and there is no voice in the world that sounds like hers. What I did do — because I wanted to have a little bit more rasp to my voice — I would take shots of whiskey and I would scream really loud to try to get it as scratchy as possible or be around people who were smoking in a cloud of smoke and inhale. And all of that still didn’t work. [Laughs] When I finally got a cold and my voice got raspy, I was like, “Oh my God, it’s so exciting!” What’s it like interpreting the classic “Midnight Train to Georgia”? Like, I can’t even say [starts to sing] “L.A.” [Pause] Oh my gosh, the very first verse literally gets me choked up. I think it’s one of the deepest love songs ever written, and it’s extremely personal to me now. It was personal before, because I am an Atlanta girl and Gladys is an Atlanta girl. But now I can’t wait to have a conversation with her to ask exactly what this song is about. I want to know where she was singing from. Are you nervous about her reaction to your performance? Yes, yes, I’m so nervous to have her watch me, for sure! Knight has been getting blowback for her decision to sing the national anthem at the Super Bowl. You appeared as part of Beyoncé’s halftime show in 2013. Is performing at the Super Bowl a political act? I think the interesting times that we’re in right now, in politics and opinions, make it very touchy. And I’ll keep my answer right there. Because it’s really unfortunate that we’re in this place where even having your opportunity … she probably wanted to do the national anthem her whole career, and here we are at a moment where you make one decision, and some people are excited and some people are really, really upset about it. [Sighs] It really is a tough one. Michelle Williams, your former Destiny’s Child collaborator, is playing Diana Ross in “American Soul.” Was there any competition about who could better recreate a diva? When she told me she got the role, I was excited and couldn’t wait to see her performance. We just didn’t have that competition moment and we probably should have! Any plans for another Destiny’s Child reunion? Everybody is like, “Oh my God, when’s it going to …” Our kids have play dates, and we hang out for girls’ nights, but it hasn’t been anything that we’ve talked about. And … yeah! Do you feel any extra pressure raising a boy in such turbulent times? I feel like it’s a great responsibility to raise a good man, respectful, with integrity, honest, a great sense of self-assurance. That’s the pressure that I feel ever since he was in my womb. My gosh, I think Mike Brown had just been killed, and it was a series of killings of black boys back-to-back. And I remember holding my belly, weeping, because I was thinking, I have a black boy and he’s going to come into this world and how do I protect him from ignorance? How do I protect him from any and everything — when they fall, when they’re learning to meet friends, when they’re going to have a job interview. Of course, God’s bigger than me, and he was just like, “You’ve got this.” I feel like God was like, “I created woman on purpose. I’ve created you this way for a reason, and you have everything it is that you need to raise this child.” RCA dropped R. Kelly after a documentary resurrected sexual-misconduct allegations. Last month, Mathew Knowles, Beyoncé’s father, spoke about keeping him away from Destiny’s Child. You went on to record songs with him. Any thoughts in hindsight? No, I’d honestly rather not say. I will keep my comments to myself at this moment because I’m still downloading all of this like everybody else is. You’ve vowed to finally release an album this year. What should we expect from your music-making?  I’m at the point where I feel like as long as I’m having fun making music, I can do whatever I want to do. Not follow anybody else’s standards, only my own. And music that I’m excited about, that I want to share with people, that I want them to be inspired by. On this next album, I want people to actually meet me. “Kelly,” your latest, very danceable single, feels like a proclamation of where you are in life. So what do you mean when you sing, “Kelly ain’t humble no mo’”? What I mean is, usually I let so many different things slide and it’s, “Oh, it’s so sweet, Kelly, it’s sweet.” I’m so sick of that word. “She’s sweet.” [Laughs] Because I am a kind person, but what I’m saying is: Don’t take my kindness for weakness.

5c81604a49f0eacbf105be3b,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/07/arts/music/popcast-michael-jackson.html,"Earlier this week, HBO aired the two-part documentary “Leaving Neverland,” which details accusations of child sexual abuse against Michael Jackson from two men, Wade Robson and James Safechuck. The allegations contained in the film are specific, and devastating. Both Robson and Safechuck say that after meeting Jackson as children in professional contexts, he took advantage of his stature to groom them for abuse, and continued to molest them for years. (The Michael Jackson estate has denied the claims, and is seeking $100 million in damages from HBO.) The film has had deep reverberations. Oprah Winfrey came out in support of the accusers, interviewing them for a television special. And the conversation around the film has placed Jackson in the cross hairs of several ongoing conversations about how culture made by people accused of heinous crimes will be dealt with in the future. The film is likely to have an impact on the value of his estate, and the way any future Jackson projects unfold. At the same time, Michael Jackson superfans have been pushing back against the film, suggesting it amounts to little more than rumor. To discuss the film and its likely impact, this week’s Popcast guests are: Joe Coscarelli, the pop music reporter for The New York Times Aisha Harris, an assistant television editor for The New York Times Ben Sisario, the music business reporter for The New York Times "
5c7b82d649f0eacbf105b162,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/03/business/media/leaving-neverland-michael-jackson-estate.html,"Michael Jackson’s damaged reputation began to recover the day he died. The lurid accusations of child molestation that had dogged him for years fell to the background as fans around the world celebrated the entertainer who had gone from pop prodigy to global superstar over a four-decade career. Flash mobs from Stockholm to the Philippines re-enacted his video scenes, and his music sales again broke chart records. Now, nearly 10 years after his death, the dark side of Mr. Jackson’s legend has returned through a documentary that rocked the Sundance Film Festival and is being championed by Oprah Winfrey. In addition to delivering a hit to his mended reputation, the film poses a significant risk to the Jackson estate, which has engineered a thriving posthumous career, including a Broadway-bound jukebox musical. The four-hour documentary, “Leaving Neverland,” to be broadcast on HBO in two parts on Sunday and Monday, focuses on the wrenching testimony of two men, Wade Robson and James Safechuck, who say Mr. Jackson abused them for years, starting when they were young boys. While the accusations are not new, their revival in the #MeToo era, with its momentum of accountability for figures like R. Kelly, Harvey Weinstein and Bill Cosby, gives them new meaning. “There has always been this shadow or cloud about Michael,” said Charles Koppelman, a longtime music executive who once served as a financial adviser to Mr. Jackson. “With this documentary about to be shown to millions and millions of people, and all the notoriety that it’s now getting, I think it will have a detrimental effect to the legacy and the estate.” The estate has already begun its war on “Leaving Neverland.” It issued a series of fiery statements around the time of the film’s Sundance debut in January and has filed a petition in Los Angeles County Superior Court for arbitration, seeking $100 million in damages from HBO. In making its case, the estate — whose beneficiaries are Mr. Jackson’s mother and three children, as well as children’s charities — portrays Mr. Robson and Mr. Safechuck as “serial perjurers” for whom HBO has become “just another tool in their litigation playbook.” The debate over the film is likely to be intense in black communities, where figures like Mr. Jackson and Mr. Kelly have their strongest defenders, said Yaba Blay, a professor at North Carolina Central University whose specialty is black racial and cultural identities. “If you think R. Kelly tore black America apart, this is going to destroy us,” Dr. Blay said. On Monday night, after the conclusion of “Leaving Neverland,” HBO and the Oprah Winfrey Network plan to broadcast Ms. Winfrey’s interview with Mr. Robson, Mr. Safechuck and the film’s director, Dan Reed. In “Leaving Neverland,” Mr. Robson, 36, and Mr. Safechuck, 41, tell parallel stories of being drawn into Mr. Jackson’s inner circle as boys. Mr. Robson met Mr. Jackson on tour in Australia at age 5 and moved to the United States two years later to be near his idol. Mr. Safechuck was 8 when he was cast in a Pepsi commercial and met Mr. Jackson. Both men say Mr. Jackson abused them while charming their families at his 2,600-acre Neverland compound in Los Olivos, Calif. He also warned them to keep their sexual relationship secret, the men say. “He told me if they ever found out what we were doing,” Mr. Robson says in the film, “he and I would go to jail for the rest of our lives.” Complicating the men’s accounts are their histories as Mr. Jackson’s defenders. Both gave sworn testimony at different times denying that any abuse had taken place, and Mr. Robson was the first witness called by Mr. Jackson’s defense team at his 2005 criminal trial on molestation charges involving another boy. Members of the men’s families say in the film that they knew nothing of the alleged abuse at the time, nor suspected any. No corroborating testimony or evidence for their accounts is presented. In the film, the men say the change of heart had to do with their becoming fathers. After Mr. Jackson died at 50 on June 25, 2009, they filed separate lawsuits against the estate, making their accusations of abuse public for the first time. Those cases were thrown out for being filed too late, but remain under appeal. The estate has seized on the men’s past defense of Mr. Jackson to attack their credibility. It also accuses the director, Mr. Reed, whose previous documentaries include “Three Days of Terror: The Charlie Hebdo Attacks” and “The Paedophile Hunter,” of flouting standard journalistic practice by failing to contact the estate for a response. “It is a disgrace,” Howard Weitzman, the estate’s lawyer, wrote in a 10-page public letter to HBO last month. In an interview, Mr. Reed noted that “Leaving Neverland” includes footage of blanket denials from Mr. Jackson and his lawyers, and he argued that the opinions of the estate and Jackson family members are irrelevant. “I do not think that interviewing a member of the Jackson family saying what a nice guy Michael was has any bearing on the credibility of someone who claims that Michael Jackson abused him behind a locked door,” Mr. Reed said. Born in Gary, Ind., Mr. Jackson became famous as the preternaturally talented lead singer of the Jackson 5, whose first four singles on the Motown record label — “I Want You Back,” “ABC,” “The Love You Save” and “I’ll Be There” — went to No. 1 in 1970. Joe Jackson, the boys’ domineering father, controlled the group, and it became part of Michael’s mythos that he never had a normal childhood. With later solo albums like “Off the Wall” and “Thriller,” both produced with Quincy Jones, Mr. Jackson reached superstardom, breaking sales records around the world as the tabloids chronicled his offstage life. In 1993, he was accused of child molestation for the first time. Early the next year, he paid a reported $23 million to settle a civil case. During that time, prosecutors in Los Angeles and Santa Barbara, Calif., built a criminal case against Mr. Jackson, only to drop it when the main accuser — the boy from the civil case — decided against cooperating. Aside from a No. 1 single in 1995, “You Are Not Alone” — written by Mr. Kelly — Mr. Jackson never achieved the level of success he had attained earlier in his career. Criminal charges were brought against him in 2003, when he was accused of using alcohol and pornography to seduce and molest a boy. In 2005, a jury acquitted Mr. Jackson, but his reputation seemed beyond repair. In the trial’s wake, he left Neverland for Bahrain, where he was spotted in shopping malls wearing black robes and veils. After his return to the United States, mired in debt, he made plans for a comeback tour, only to die in a rented mansion in Los Angeles, having succumbed to a combination of drugs provided to him by his personal physician, who was later found guilty of involuntary manslaughter. His estate, led by John G. Branca, Mr. Jackson’s longtime lawyer and deal maker, and John McClain, a music executive, struck an array of lucrative deals, including film and record contracts. It also approved two Jackson-related shows by the dance-theater troupe Cirque du Soleil. One of those, “Michael Jackson: One,” has been a Las Vegas staple since 2013. Since 2009, the estate has brought in more than $2 billion, according to Billboard. Half of that came from the sale of its stakes in major song catalogs: Sony/ATV, which contained more than 200 songs written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, and EMI, whose vast holdings include most Motown hits. A test of Mr. Jackson’s market appeal may be “Don’t Stop ’Til You Get Enough,” the musical produced by the estate and Columbia Live Stage, a division of Sony Pictures. Planned for a 2020 Broadway premiere, it has a highbrow creative team: Lynn Nottage, a two-time Pulitzer Prize winner, is writing the book, and Christopher Wheeldon, a ballet luminary, is the choreographer. Since “Leaving Neverland” made its debut at Sundance, the fate of the musical has caused talk in theater circles. A Chicago tryout run was canceled; producers blamed scheduling conflicts after an actors’ strike. A spokesman for the show said the production remained on schedule. The larger question, said Stacy Wolf, a Princeton theater professor, is whether Ms. Nottage, who is known for her politically charged work, has the freedom to stray from a sanitized account of Mr. Jackson’s life story. The show, which will incorporate Mr. Jackson’s songs, was announced as being based on the period leading up to his “Dangerous” tour of 1992 and 1993 — a tour cut short when allegations of abuse surfaced. “The question is, can she figure out, as a dramatist, how to tell the story she wants to tell, without compromising her politics, and dealing with this very difficult estate?” Ms. Wolf said. Through the show’s spokesman, the producers and Ms. Nottage declined to comment. In its petition for arbitration, the Jackson estate accused HBO of being in breach of a 1992 agreement it had made with the singer to broadcast a concert from Bucharest, Romania. The estate said the contract had contained a nondisparagement clause that HBO was violating with “Leaving Neverland.” The filing — which begins, “Michael Jackson is innocent. Period.” — also targets the credibility of Mr. Robson and Mr. Safechuck. Both men, the filing says, are “pursuing claims against the Jackson estate for hundreds of millions of dollars,” through appeals of their suit. (In response, HBO has said it plans to broadcast “Leaving Neverland” as announced, “despite the desperate lengths taken to undermine the film.”) In the #MeToo era, aggressive statements against accusers may not be effective, said Matthew Hiltzik, whose firm, Hiltzik Strategies, handles crisis management for celebrities and corporations. “It’s understandable that an estate would want to fight back in any way possible because of the unique challenges of trying to refute claims against someone who has been dead for 10 years,” Mr. Hiltzik said. “But it may backfire based on the contents of the documentary and the current climate.” "
5c462b963a125f5075c058cf,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/21/obituaries/reggie-young-dead.html,"NASHVILLE — Reggie Young, a prolific studio guitarist who appeared on landmark recordings by Elvis Presley and many others and played a prominent role in shaping the sound of Southern popular music in the 1960s and ’70s, died on Thursday at his home in Leipers Fork, Tenn., just outside Nashville. He was 82. His wife, Jenny Young, said the cause was heart failure. Mr. Young played guitar on hundreds of hit recordings in a career that spanned more than six decades. Among his best-known credits are the Box Tops’ “The Letter” and Presley’s “Suspicious Minds,” both No. 1 pop singles in the late ’60s, and Neil Diamond’s 1969 Top 10 hit “Sweet Caroline.” Mr. Young also played the funky chicken-scratch guitar lick on “Skinny Legs and All,” the soul singer Joe Tex’s 1967 Top 10 pop hit. He contributed the reverberating fills and swells that punctuate James Carr’s timeless soul ballad “The Dark End of the Street,” also from 1967. And his bluesy riffing buttressed the sultry, throbbing groove on “Son of a Preacher Man,” a Top 10 single for the British pop singer Dusty Springfield in 1968. Mr. Young appeared on all these recordings, including those associated with Presley’s late-’60s return to the limelight, as a member of the Memphis Boys, the renowned house band for the producer Chips Moman’s American Sound Studio. Living and working in Memphis, where there had long been a fertile cross-pollinization between country music and the blues, was critical to the development of Mr. Young’s down-home style of playing, a muscular yet relaxed mix of rhythmic and melodic instincts. “In Memphis, it’s sort of in between Nashville and the Southern Delta down in Mississippi, so I’m kind of a cross between B. B. King and Chet Atkins,” Mr. Young said in an interview published on the website Soul and Jazz and Funk in 2017. “Most of the soul music back then was in Memphis,” he added. “That’s where I came from.” In addition to playing guitar, Mr. Young added the psychedelic accents of the electric sitar to a handful of influential recordings, among them the Box Tops’ “Cry Like a Baby” and B. J. Thomas’s “Hooked on a Feeling,” both of which reached the Top 10 in 1968. After American Sound Studio closed in 1972, Mr. Young moved to Nashville, where his soulful less-is-more approach graced hits like Dobie Gray’s “Drift Away,” Waylon Jennings’s “Luckenbach, Texas” and Willie Nelson’s “Always on My Mind.” Mr. Young’s Nashville session credits also include Billy Swan’s “I Can Help,” which topped both the country and pop charts in 1974. Mr. Young made an indelible contribution, especially during his years in Memphis, to the Southernization of pop music in the 1960s and early ’70s. This influence was felt not just by the number of records made in the South that were played on AM radio throughout the nation. It was also evident in the procession of artists, among them Aretha Franklin, Paul Simon and the jazz flutist Herbie Mann, who came from outside the region to make records steeped in the Southern musical vernacular. Reggie Grimes Young was born on Dec. 12, 1936, in Caruthersville, Mo., and was raised in Osceola, Ark., and later in Memphis. His father, Reggie, was an accountant who played Hawaiian-style classical guitar and taught his son to play when he was 14. His mother, Thelma (Mayes) Young, was a homemaker. In 1956 Mr. Young joined Eddie Bond and the Stompers, a rockabilly band that had a regional hit with a record called “Rockin’ Daddy” and opened shows for Johnny Cash, Roy Orbison and Carl Perkins. Three years later he joined Bill Black’s Combo, an instrumental quintet led by Presley’s former bass player. He played on two No. 1 R&B singles with the group, “Smokie” and “White Silver Sands,” before joining the Army in 1960, and rejoined after his return to civilian life in the early ’60s. He arrived just in time to travel with Bill Black’s Combo when it opened for the Beatles on their 1964 tour of the United States. During that tour, Mr. Young had the opportunity to introduce George Harrison to the finer points of his Southern style of playing. “George asked me, because I’m a blues player, ‘How do you bend and stretch your strings like that?’ ” Mr. Young recalled in the Soul and Jazz and Funk interview. “I told him, ‘You have to have light-gauge strings,’ and after that I think he went to lighter gauge strings on his guitar.” A compilation album of 24 tracks from sessions on which Mr. Young played, including recordings by Merle Haggard, Jackie DeShannon and Bobby (Blue) Bland, is to be released by the English label Ace Records this week. In addition to his wife, Mr. Young is survived by a son, Reggie III; a daughter, Cindy Evans; a sister, Alice Weatley; five grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren. Mr. Young played with so many luminaries over the course of his career that he said “it was nothing special” for him and his fellow Memphis Boys to be tapped to support Elvis Presley in the studio in the late ’60s. “We played with all the top stars of the time, and Elvis hadn’t had any hits for a while and didn’t have an album on the charts,” he said in a 2013 interview with Premier Guitar magazine. “As he stepped into the studio though — boy,” he continued. “I never met any other person with such charisma. It was very special for me.” "
5c6ee8d13a125f5075c0ad83,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/obituaries/peter-tork-dead.html,"Peter Tork, a struggling musician who became an overnight teenage idol in the 1960s with the Monkees, died on Thursday at a family home in eastern Connecticut. He was 77. His son, Ivan Iannoli, said the cause was complications from a rare form of cancer that was first diagnosed in 2009. Mr. Tork, who grew up in Connecticut, lived in Mansfield, east of Hartford, according to The Hartford Courant. The Monkees were an unabashedly manufactured band, created by Hollywood producers in the 1960s to capitalize on the astounding popularity of the Beatles. The members — Mr. Tork (the oldest, at 24), Davy Jones, Micky Dolenz and Mike Nesmith — were cast as the stars of an NBC sitcom, “The Monkees” (1966-68), in which they performed and dealt with comic situations with a childlike irreverence, much as the Beatles had in their hit films “A Hard Day’s Night” and “Help!” Mr. Tork was positioned as the goofy one, the court jester. The director Bob Rafelson, one of the show’s creators, compared him to Harpo Marx. Because they were created for television, did not write their own songs (that was left to professionals like Gerry Goffin, Carole King and others) and did not play their own instruments (they mimed playing on camera), the Monkees were disdained by many; if the Beatles were the Fab Four, the Monkees quickly earned the derisive nickname the Prefab Four. But they surprised many in the music industry, and perhaps themselves as well, when they became popular both on television and on the charts. Their show won the Emmy Award for outstanding comedy series in 1967, and the band’s many hit records — including “Last Train to Clarksville,” “Daydream Believer,” “Pleasant Valley Sunday” and the infectious if simplistic “(Theme From) The Monkees” (“Hey, hey, we’re the Monkees / And people say we Monkee around … ”) — for a while earned them sales on the same stratospheric level as the Beatles’. Both Mr. Tork and Mr. Nesmith were accomplished musicians — Mr. Tork played several instruments — and Mr. Dolenz and Mr. Jones were seasoned singers. (As a child, Mr. Jones had played the Artful Dodger in “Oliver!” on Broadway.) But because studio musicians did the playing on the first two Monkees albums, the notion that they were not a real band persisted. That began to change in 1967, when the group released what came to be considered its signature album, “Headquarters,” on which they played most of the instruments themselves and wrote several of the songs. Mr. Tork co-wrote some of them, and he shared lead vocals with Mr. Jones on the wistful ballad “Shades of Gray.” (Peter Tork vocals were a rarity on Monkees albums — he was by far the group’s weakest singer — but he had some memorable ones, often laced with humor, beginning with “Your Auntie Grizelda” on the band’s second album, “More of the Monkees.”) The Monkees recorded for only three years before disbanding; their popularity faded after their TV show was canceled, and Mr. Tork left the band in 1969. But the group enjoyed a revival in the 1980s and reunited for numerous concerts and tours, although usually without Mr. Nesmith. Mr. Tork recorded his first solo album, “Stranger Things Have Happened,” in 1994. He later formed a blues band, Shoe Suede Blues, with which he continued to perform and record until recently. The band’s latest album, “Relax Your Mind,” was released last year. “The blues is about community,” Mr. Tork told The Courant, explaining his genre switch. “Not about how lonely I am, but everybody’s been lonely.” Peter Halsten Thorkelson was born on Feb. 13, 1942, in Washington, the son of Halsten John Thorkelson, an economics professor, and Virginia Hope (Straus) Thorkelson. The family moved to Connecticut, where Peter graduated from high school in Storrs. He attended Carleton College in Minnesota, but left before graduating and moved to New York, where he performed in folk clubs in Greenwich Village and met another up-and-coming musician, Stephen Stills. In California, where both had relocated, Mr. Stills tried out for the Monkees. When that didn’t work out — some sources say Mr. Stills was rejected because he had bad teeth; Mr. Stills himself said that he rejected the job because he wanted to write songs for the show but that would have meant surrendering his music publishing — he recommended Mr. Tork, because people had always told the two that they looked alike. Mr. Tork left show business shortly after leaving the Monkees and at one point taught high school in Santa Monica, Calif. There were financial problems, and personal ones as well; he dealt with alcoholism and drug abuse, and served a short prison sentence for hashish possession in 1972. Later in his career he made guest appearances on a handful of television series, including “The King of Queens” and “7th Heaven.” His last movie role was in “I Filmed Your Death,” a horror drama yet to be released. Mr. Tork reunited with his fellow Monkees for a world tour in 2011 and with Mr. Dolenz and Mr. Nesmith in 2012 for a tour that included a tribute to Mr. Jones, who died that year. In recent years the surviving Monkees released two albums. Mr. Nesmith and Mr. Dolenz went back on the road last year, without Mr. Tork, for a tour billed as “The Monkees Present: The Mike & Micky Show.” (That tour was interrupted when Mr. Nesmith underwent heart surgery but resumed this year.) Mr. Tork’s marriages to Jody Babb, Reine Stewart and Barbara Iannoli ended in divorce. In addition to his son, he is survived by his fourth wife, Pamela Grapes, whom he married in 2014; two daughters, Hallie Iannoli and Erica Thorkelson; a sister, Anne Thorkelson; a brother, Nick Thorkelson; and three grandchildren. His brother, Christopher Thorkelson, died before him. Like many artists, Mr. Tork concluded that happiness came simply from doing the work. “It’s about getting to play the music full time,” he told The Los Angeles Times in 1992. “It’s not about the following anymore, the fame game. A little bit of fame is fun, but I’ve had enough, thank you.” "

Maren Morris gets the cursing out of the way right at the top of “Girl,” the first single from her second album, due this year. It’s a reminder she’s a country singer, but not really. “Girl,” which Morris wrote with her “The Middle” collaborator Sarah Aarons, as well as Greg Kurstin, has a bit of Billie Eilish, a little Lana Del Rey, maybe some Alannah Myles. And yet thanks to some meaty guitar, it has a slow-country stubbornness. Morris’s ambivalence extends right to the vocal mix, which obscures her, and the arc of the melody, which gets thickened but never builds or finds resolution. JON CARAMANICA There’s no avoiding it: Dolores O’Riordan’s death a year ago (she died from drowning in a London hotel bathtub after heavy drinking) haunts “All Over Now,” the first song from an album — “In the End,” due April 26 — that the Cranberries completed from demo recordings by O’Riordan and Noel Hogan. In the first verse she sings, “Do you remember, remember the night/at a hotel in London.” It turns out to be a song about seeing a woman trying to pretend she’s not a domestic-violence victim yet not getting involved. Guitars buzz in minor chords over a choppy beat, while O’Riordan’s voice — the demo included vocal harmonies — holds stoic regret. Her death multiplies the sadness of the chorus: “It’s all over now.” JON PARELES Tamaryn, a songwriter originally from New Zealand, has long placed her voice amid washes of reverb-laden guitar, mingling impulses from 1960s girl groups and 1990s shoegaze. “Fits of Rage” snaps her reveries into focus; the guitars still echo, but her voice leaps out from them, demanding accountability from someone who seems about to shrug her off. Her voice grows furious as she declares, “You can’t deny I was so close to you.” Sometimes anger is clarifying. PARELES Here’s a thoroughly convincing period piece: a Phil Spector girl-group beat, three chords and lots of reverb behind Lily & Madeleine singing in unison about passion overriding reason: “I try to keep myself together but I’m losing it anyway.” PARELES Glen Hansard, the Irish songwriter from the Frames, the Swell Season and “Once,” reduces his voice to a depressive, scratchy monotone in the ominous, low-self-esteem love song “I’ll Be You, Be Me,” from an album arriving in April. A ticking snare drum and a skulking bass accompany lines like “My lover is all good things/and I’m the fool whose spell she’s under.” By the end of the song he’s engulfed in a tsunami of strings, choir and feedback, but still too glum to raise his voice. PARELES An adorable video for a pro forma duet from two of Latin music’s rising stars who’ve been playing are-they-or-aren’t-they for months. The song is sweet, a little evanescent. Committed-to-video memories are forever, though. CARAMANICA Dawn (Richard, from Danity Kane) promises a weekend-long sexual marathon in “Sauce,” invoking Rihanna, La Perla and the Kentucky Derby over a slow, undulating trap beat. For nearly the entire track, her lead vocal stays on just two low notes; it couldn’t be more single-minded. But around it, voices and instruments materialize like stray fantasies, and a sweetly unexpected a cappella coda anticipates satisfaction. PARELES In which post-Young Thug fever-pitch syllable squeals finally come full circle and arrive at saccharine-sweet pure-pop accessibility. YNW Melly is one of the most impressive young melodists working — see “Murder on My Mind” — and even though there’s not much material to work with in the verses here, the chorus is bright, effusive and sneakily rich. Kanye is a low-impact accent piece here, singing part of the hook and adding bonus whimsy to the video. CARAMANICA Elena Alexandra Apostoleanu, the Romanian singer who records as Inna, pivots toward pop’s center. A decade ago she was singing in English over house-music beats and EDM synthesizers. But more recently, her high, smiley voice has been heard alongside Latin pop hitmakers like J Balvin, Pitbull and Daddy Yankee, in English and Spanish. In “Sin Ti,” a song about a sudden infatuation, she whispers insistent endearments in a catchy, extremely canny production by David Ciente that hops all over the Latin map: dembow verses and flamenco-tinged acoustic guitar in the chorus, with bits of sampled vocals and fleeting string-section phrases winking in and out of earshot. In a small world, she’s up-to-the-minute. PARELES Echoing the keyboard chords of Bruce Springsteen’s “My Hometown,” the Killers’ “Land of the Free” is a compendium of issues — mass incarceration, immigration, racism, gun control — heading into a gospelly chorus. The video clip, centered on news footage, is by Spike Lee; the Killers’ willingness to face a social-media backlash is as significant as the song. JON PARELES Snarky Puppy might be today’s most popular band whose audience wouldn’t be fazed by a nearly 10-minute-long lead single with no words. “Xavi” is the first thing we’re hearing from “Immigrance,” a forthcoming album from this large ensemble of virtuoso music nerds and studio hotshots. Crunchy guitar slices out a truncated phrase in conversation with an insistent snare drum, and flutes and trumpets drape a humid cloud cover overhead. The tune’s head-nodding six-beat rhythm is based around an antique chaabi groove, which Snarky’s bassist and leader, Michael League, learned from Gnawa musicians while performing in Morocco last year. It accords with “Immigrance’s” overall bent, which considers the role of migration and exchange in shaping our world. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO The alto saxophonist Greg Ward’s new album, “Stomping Off From Greenwood,” has the rusted, resonant sound of so much beat-driven jazz coming from Chicago natives today (Jeff Parker, Makaya McCraven, Marquis Hill). But its instrumentation — alto sax, two guitars, bass, drums — calls to mind another standout album from last year, Logan Richardson’s “Blues People.” Like Richardson on his album, Ward bobs gracefully through a coolly plotted improvisation on “The Contender” as his rhythm section handles a stop-and-start polyrhythm, creating friction and expectation and the illusion of an incline for Ward to climb.

5c93c55949f0eacbf105e501,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/21/fashion/ariana-grande-law-roach-zendaya.html,"When Ariana Grande stepped on stage at the Times Union Center in Albany for the start of her 80-date Sweetener World Tour this week and began to belt “God Is a Woman,” she did so wearing a mix of haute and street wear, Versace and the independent Los Angeles designer Oscar Utierrè, that signaled the next stage in her professional evolution from Nickelodeon star to global sensation. Her longtime stylist Law Roach said the point was that she can no longer be put in any single box.  Neither, as it happens, can he. A thoughtful 30-something (he is evasive about his age) who has been helping Ms. Grande define and refine her image since 2015, Mr. Roach has in the process become something of a lightning rod and activist in an industry that has struggled with issues of size-ism, racism and #MeToo. “I like to grow with my clients,” he said by phone on a break from tour rehearsals in Pennsylvania. Ms. Grande, he said, “went through so much these last two years: the bombing at the concert, the death of what could have been one of the loves of her life, the breakup with Pete.”  Mr. Roach was referring to the singer’s former fiancé, Pete Davidson; her late boyfriend, Mac Miller; and the suicide bombing that killed 22 people in Manchester, England, during her 2017 Dangerous Woman Tour. “It’s just, she has 148 million people on Instagram alone watching her go through it,” he said. In helping Ms. Grande make the leap from teenage kitten to adult woman-with-a-cause, Mr. Roach is staying true to a career marked by evolution: Celine Dion emerging from grief to become a viral sensation in an $885 Vetements “Titanic” hoodie during Paris couture week in 2016; Tiffany Haddish famously re-wearing Alexander McQueen for the third time to present at the MTV Movie & TV Awards in 2018.  Most recently it was Zendaya’s masterminding of her Tommy Hilfiger x Zendaya collection during Paris Fashion Week. The show was inspired by the Battle of Versailles, the 1973 face-off between French and American designers that featured a large number of black models, many more than usual runway shows. “It was about paying homage to the people who opened the door for us,” Mr. Roach said, of the Zendaya show. All of the models were women of color, and included Pat Cleveland, who walked in the Battle of Versailles; Veronica Webb, the first black woman to land a cosmetics contract with a major brand (Revlon); and Beverly Johnson, the first black woman to appear on the cover of American Vogue. Ten of the 59 women, aged from 18 to 70, were plus size. Black plus size women? “In our community, that’s a given,” Mr. Roach said. “This is the shape of woman we’ve grown up with — my mom, her aunts, her grandma. It had to be size inclusive, because if the women in Zendaya’s family can’t wear it, then she doesn’t want to make it.” “We all know the average woman is not a size 0 or 2,” Mr. Roach said. “I think it’s just human nature to want to see ourselves, to be represented. When I got into this industry, I didn’t see anyone who looked like me.” Mr. Roach was the first black stylist on the cover of the Hollywood Reporter’s annual Stylist & Stars issue, in 2017. “I’m still the first to do some things in 2019,” he said. “The more I’ve been around, the more I see where the deficit is.  “It’s award season, I’m taking high jewelry appointments, I see who else is at those appointments. When I go to Paris, I see who’s at the shows. During the Oscars, I’m backstage with Mary, and I see what that landscape looks like,” he said of last year’s ceremony, where Mary J. Blige, a client, was nominated for best supporting actress and best original song, for “Mudbound.” “Why is this still the landscape? Why does it still look this way? I just always come back to the question: Is it talent or is it opportunity? “You get to this position by first being someone’s intern,” Mr. Roach said. “And then an assistant. I don’t see black assistants, or black interns. Everybody’s not going to meet a Zendaya and have the gumption or the ability to figure everything out.” Mr. Roach grew up on the South Side of Chicago, the oldest of five siblings, with a single mother. “I grew up very, very, very, very poor,” he said. “Single parent, shelters. I was a kid of the streets.”  Far from thinking about fashion, he was thinking about how to feed his siblings. “I was always big brother/mother because my mother suffered from alcoholism and drug addiction,” he said. “I had to cook. I had to clean. I raised my youngest brother when my mom passed away. I grew up with nothing. Literally, nothing.” While working as a bartender, he and his best friend opened a vintage clothing store called Deliciously Vintage. One day in 2009, Kanye West walked in, and Mr. Roach was soon fielding inquiries from around the world.  “People started calling the store, ‘Hey, I’m a stylist for this magazine, do you have. ...’ It triggered something in me,” said Mr. Roach, who started calling himself a stylist. Now he calls himself an “image architect,” because, he said “I didn’t have someone else’s formula of how to do this job, I created my own.”  Two years later, one of his customers, a close friend of Zendaya’s father, invited him to Los Angeles. Zendaya, then a budding Disney star, was going to Justin Bieber’s “Never Say Never” premiere. “They were going to the mall to find something to wear, and my friend Chastity was like, ‘Oh, you should take Law. He loves clothes, he can help,’” Mr. Roach said. “So, we all went to the mall. And Zendaya and I have been together ever since.”  Now Mr. Roach is gearing up to help Zendaya with the press tour for “Spider-Man Far From Home” with Tom Holland, as well as starring in the Bloomingdale’s 2019 spring “Mix Masters” campaign, as himself. He is also eyeing a creative endeavor, whether it is taking the helm of an existing brand or starting his own. Mr. Roach believes people must demand change, and at all levels. “This next generation of girls in Hollywood — the Zendayas, the Yara Shahidis, the Kiki Laynes — these women are coming in asking to work with people who look like them,” he said. “That’s the only way this landscape is going to change. We have to be able to be in these rooms.” "
5c61a8b73a125f5075c091ab,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/11/arts/music/grammy-awards-review.html,"Ariana Grande didn’t attend the Grammys, but that didn’t stop her from being at the center of the conversation about — and around — the ceremony. On Friday she released an album, “Thank U, Next,” and a hot-button video for a new single, “Break Up With Your Girlfriend, I’m Bored.” And throughout Sunday, she found several ways — some earnest, some petty — to stay at the forefront of online discussion. When she won best pop vocal album, for “Sweetener,” she wrote on Twitter, “I try not to put too much weight into these things,” conceding, “this is wild and beautiful.” She appeared in a psychedelically disorienting commercial for Apple’s Memoji, with an animated Grande head performing “7 Rings.” When Cardi B won best rap album, Grande fired off a couple of frustrated tweets; her ex-boyfriend, Mac Miller, who died last year, was a nominee. (She later apologized and deleted all of the tweets.) And she posted several photos of herself in the custom Zac Posen dress she was going to wear during the ceremony. [Who soared and who flopped? See the best and worst of the Grammys.] This wasn’t the Grammy experience Grande was planning to have. Up until a couple of days ago, she was slated to perform on the broadcast, a plan that imploded in spectacular fashion. After the longtime show producer Ken Ehrlich said in an interview that Grande was no longer performing because she “felt it was too late for her to pull something together,” Grande replied with barbs. “I’ve kept my mouth shut but now you’re lying about me,” Grande wrote on Twitter. “I can pull together a performance over night and you know that, Ken. It was when my creativity & self-expression was stifled by you, that I decided not to attend.” And so on the night of the Grammys, all of the noise Grande generated was heard everywhere but the actual broadcast, making her one of several artists who made loud splashes without ever setting foot in the Staples Center. This year’s ceremony was perhaps as notable for who didn’t show up — Kendrick Lamar, Childish Gambino (who won four awards, including record and song of the year for “This Is America”), Taylor Swift — as who did. And also for how it treated several of its biggest winners, including Drake, cutting off their speeches abruptly. (This, on a broadcast on which only nine awards were handed out over more than three and a half hours.) [Hear our pop music team break down the Grammy highs and lows.] So perhaps the best place to communicate an unfettered message during the Grammys is anywhere but the actual ceremony. The show still conceives of itself as a linear television experience, when in fact the consumption of it — and especially the stars it relies upon — is wild, woolly and omnidirectional. Consider 21 Savage, nominated for two awards for his role on Post Malone’s “Rockstar” but unable to attend because of his detention by Immigration and Customs Enforcement last week. When Post Malone performed, he didn’t mention his collaborator, which spurred a fierce backlash online. (Eventually, a photo of him wearing a 21 Savage T-shirt underneath his outfit was circulated.) Kei Henderson, one of 21 Savage’s managers, wrote on Twitter that she and others “attempted to solidify recognition for Savage during the performance of ‘Rockstar,’ it just didn’t work out that way.” The only person to mention 21 Savage during the broadcast was Ludwig Göransson, the Childish Gambino collaborator. The lack of other acknowledgment was glaring. Some stars used the Grammys window to advertise their other endeavors. Childish Gambino appeared in a vivid ad for Google’s Playmoji in which he danced alongside an avatar of himself. Travis Scott had one of the most energetic performances of the show, but also released a new sneaker during the ceremony. Taylor Swift, who was nominated once this year, posted a photo on Instagram from the Baftas, in London. (Last year, the video for “The Middle” — the Zedd, Maren Morris and Grey collaboration — debuted during the Grammys as part of a Target advertising campaign; this year, it was nominated for record and song of the year. The side road works.) While plenty of stars sought a way around the Grammy telecast pipeline, others used it to its fullest potential. Cardi B, who often appears to be the only performer in any field who still experiences genuine shock and gratitude, delivered an emotional speech after winning best rap album. Brandi Carlile’s performance of “The Joke” was outlandishly good, and Alicia Keys’s hosting had several slyly intriguing moments. Following a brutally boring Grammys last year that also deeply marginalized women, it was refreshing that most of this year’s high points came from female artists. More often, though, when the Grammys had an opportunity to celebrate one of pop’s most prominent stars, it dropped the ball. Speeches from almost all the most relevant winners — Kacey Musgraves, Cardi B, Dua Lipa — were cut short. In no case was this more egregious than with Drake, by far the most popular artist to win a Grammy this year. Drake was offered a performance slot, but turned it down (as did Lamar and Childish Gambino). So when he popped up onstage after he was announced as the winner of best rap song, it was a true surprise. [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] While his appearance was magnanimous — especially after his prior critiques of the Grammys — his speech was anything but. He took a swipe at his prior best rap song Grammy win for “Hotline Bling,” which is not (really) a rap song. He drew attention to the fact that those who vote for the Grammys might not be the best equipped to “understand, you know, what a mixed-race kid from Canada has to say, or a fly Spanish girl from New York, or anybody else, or a brother from Houston,” acknowledging Cardi B and Travis Scott. And then, the real humdinger. “Look, if there’s people who have regular jobs who are coming out in the rain, in the snow, spending their hard-earned money to buy tickets to come to your shows, you don’t need this right here, I promise you. You already won.” “But,” Drake continued. The Grammys, however, did not continue with him. The camera pulled back to a wide shot, and then the show quickly cut to commercial. (A representative for the show later said that producers mistook Drake’s pause for the end of his remarks.) The Grammys made room for plenty of time-absorbers: Alicia Keys karaoke; umpteen tributes; a long montage dedicated to the Recording Academy’s beleaguered outgoing leader, Neil Portnow. But it is the show’s stubborn curse that it’s willing to cut off the most popular and meaningful artist in pop at the knees in order to preserve its sense of self-importance — a preposterous and careless choice. It is that same hubris that allows Ariana Grande to watch the Grammys from the couch rather than be on the stage, and that ensures the Grammys will continue to be a site of protest, of dissent, and dullness for years to come, pending changes in leadership and attitude. After the ceremony, Drake posted a photo of the victory envelope bearing his name, and added the caption “Too raw for TV.” Now more than ever, that’s a fine way to be. "
5c62eef13a125f5075c09460,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/12/arts/music/popcast-grammys.html,"Last year (and plenty of years before that), the Grammys were deeply unfortunate. The show paid mere lip service to the successes of women and nonwhite performers, and were boring to boot. So the bar for this year’s ceremony, which took place Sunday at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, was low, and the remit was clear: do everything the opposite of how it has been done. To some degree, the 61st annual Grammy Awards delivered. Though there were ample tributes to the music of decades past, and some awkwardly cut-short speeches (see: Drake, Dua Lipa), there were also performances from worthy young singers (Camila Cabello, H.E.R.), rising hip-hop stars (Cardi B, Travis Scott) and the next generation of Americana royalty (Kacey Musgraves, Brandi Carlile). That most of the show’s most impressive moments came from women was a rebuke to all the recent years in which the Grammys seemed content to sideline impressive female talent.

5c88e9cb49f0eacbf105cce6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/13/world/asia/jung-joon-young-sex-videos.html,"HONG KONG — A K-pop singer apologized on Wednesday for filming and sharing intimate videos of women without their consent as South Korea reckoned with a widening inquiry centered on another celebrity’s misconduct at Seoul nightclubs. The Seoul police say the singer, Jung Joon-young, 30, is suspected of violating sexual violence laws that prohibit the non-consensual filming and sharing of intimate videos. He was met by investigators on Tuesday at Incheon International Airport after he arrived on a flight from Los Angeles, where he had been filming a televised variety show. In a written statement shared by his agency, MAKEUS Entertainment, on Wednesday, Mr. Jung admitted to illicitly filming women and sharing the videos in group chats online. “I kneel down to apologize to the women who appear in the videos,” he wrote, adding that he would withdraw from the entertainment scene and repent his “unethical and unlawful acts” for the rest of his life. Mr. Jung’s admission comes after another K-pop singer, Lee Seung-hyun, who performed under the name Seungri, announced his retirement on Monday after being named a suspect for “offering sexual services” at nightclubs. The 28-year-old singer has denied the allegations but nonetheless chose to leave the entertainment scene and quit his boy band, Big Bang. The police have said that the two cases are “related and not related,” but noted that Mr. Jung’s case could be seen as a “derivative” of their inquiry into Mr. Lee’s conduct. Under South Korean law, those found guilty of taking explicit photos or videos without a subject’s consent can face up to five years in prison or a fine of up to 30 million won, or $26,500. The distribution of intimate photos or videos without consent carries the same maximum punishment. But critics say the police and prosecutors are lax about enforcing the law. In 2018, only roughly a third of the 6,800 reported cases were taken to trial, according to statistics from the Supreme Prosecutors’ Office of the Republic of Korea. And fewer than one in 10 trials led to prison sentences that year. Yunkim Ji-yeong, an assistant professor of feminist philosophy at the Institute of Body and Culture at Konkuk University, said such illicit filming and sharing of the videos were commonplace in South Korea. “Men competitively upload illegally filmed videos and encourage one another so that they upload again and the cycle perpetuates,” she said. She added that while tens of thousands of South Korean women protested illicit filming in a half-dozen rallies in 2018, some women were still surprised by the allegations because they contradicted the idealized image of pop idols. “These cases show that these male celebrities were using women to conduct illegal activities,” Ms. Yunkim said. MAKEUS Entertainment said in a statement that Mr. Jung’s contract had been terminated after he made an apology. "
5c5c90823a125f5075c088d3,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/07/arts/music/grammy-awards-diversity.html,"The Grammy Awards are supposed to be music’s biggest party. But in recent years the show has also become a piñata for critics, activists and even major artists over a host of issues like race and gender — and, oh yes, music. The 61st annual show, to be hosted by Alicia Keys and broadcast live by CBS on Sunday night, should be no different. After a bruising time last year, when the show came under fire after just one woman won a solo award on the air — and the chief executive of the Recording Academy, Neil Portnow, commented that women in music should “step up” to advance their careers — the Grammys made a series of changes in their membership and nominations process that were meant to address their underlying problems. But in many ways the Grammys still walk a tightrope. And as the show tries to stay culturally relevant, while also balancing the demands of race and gender representation, it may be impossible to please everybody at once. “That moment kind of shed a light on an issue that needed attention, and that is a lack of diversity in the industry,” Portnow said in an interview this week. “And if the light that was shed becomes a catalyst for change, then you can feel that it had a reason and a value.” To viewers, one of the clearest changes will be that eight, instead of five, acts will now compete in the four major categories: album, record and song of the year, and best new artist. That change satisfied many critics by adding more women to the mix, but it also has made the contests harder to handicap. For album of the year, Drake and Kendrick Lamar, two deities of contemporary hip-hop, are up against Post Malone, who has topped the charts with a mellow style between rapping and singing; the boisterous rap of Cardi B; the adventurous R&B of Janelle Monáe and H.E.R.; and two singer-songwriters in the country and folk spheres, Kacey Musgraves and Brandi Carlile. If Carlile prevails, she would be the award’s first openly gay winner. But as an artist with minimal sales, would her victory make the Grammys seem out of touch with the masses? Will a rapper win, or will they cancel one another out on the ballot? There is also a chance that the award could go to Drake or Lamar only to have the winner not show up. That has become a growing risk for the Grammys as the show has alienated more and more hip-hop and R&B stars — like Drake, Kanye West, Jay-Z and Frank Ocean — by failing to give them the most prestigious prizes. “The fact of the matter is, we continue to have a problem in the hip-hop world,” said Ken Ehrlich, the longtime producer of the show. “When they don’t take home the big prize, the regard of the academy, and what the Grammys represent, continues to be less meaningful to the hip-hop community, which is sad.” Ehrlich said that this year he offered performance slots on the show to Drake, Lamar and Childish Gambino — whose song “This Is America” is up for four awards, including record and song of the year — but they all declined. Representatives of those three artists declined to comment on whether they would attend the show. More bad news for the Grammys arrived on Thursday afternoon, when Ariana Grande confirmed reports that she had pulled out after clashing with producers — apparently Ehrlich himself — over which song to perform. “I’ve kept my mouth shut but now you’re lying about me,” Grande wrote on Twitter, responding to an Associated Press interview in which Erhlich said that she “felt it was too late for her to pull something together.” “I can pull together a performance over night and you know that, Ken,” she wrote. “It was when my creativity & self expression was stifled by you, that i decided not to attend. I hope the show is exactly what you want it to be and more.” Last year was another flash point in the troubled history of the Grammys and hip-hop, as Jay-Z, the most nominated artist, with eight nods — including album, record and song of the year — went home empty-handed, and Lamar, while winning all five awards in the rap field, lost out on album of the year, to Bruno Mars. Three months later, Lamar won the Pulitzer Prize for music. “For the Pulitzers to get it right and the Grammys to get it wrong says a lot,” said Troy Carter, an artist manager and former Spotify executive. Portnow said he believed the Grammys had made good-faith efforts to reach out to artists, but the tensions have shown no signs of letting up. “We would hope that all nominees attend the show and be there as their own achievements are celebrated,” Portnow said, “because that’s really what it’s about.” But while race has been a growing problem for years, the Grammys’ most urgent issue is over gender. Last year, a report by the University of Southern California, released days before the show, found dismal numbers about the representation of women in the music industry and at the Grammys. Lorde, the only woman nominated for album of the year in 2018, was not offered a solo performance slot. After the show, Portnow’s “step up” comment drew an immediate outcry, with some women music executives calling for his resignation. (Portnow said at the time that his words had been taken out of context, and later announced that would leave his position at the expiration of his contract in July.) In response, the Recording Academy appointed a task force, led by Tina Tchen, a former chief of staff to Michelle Obama, to “identify the various barriers and unconscious biases faced by underrepresented communities” at the academy and in the wider industry. Working with the task force, the academy has tried to make its voting pool more diverse, inviting 900 new people, from a variety of backgrounds, to be members; of those, 22 percent accepted in time to vote this year, according to Laura Segura Mueller, the academy’s vice president of membership and industry relations. Last week the task force challenged the music industry to hire more women producers and engineers, two jobs that are overwhelmingly male. Even with these steps, this year’s nominations show just how much work is left to achieve real gender parity. On the eight songs up for record of the year, a total of 48 producers and engineers were credited, and only two were female. One of them is Lady Gaga, as a producer of “Shallow,” her song with Bradley Cooper from “A Star Is Born,” which is a strong contender for both record and song of the year. Lady Gaga is scheduled to perform, but that night Cooper will be at the Baftas, the British film awards. (Taylor Swift, who is up for just one award, pop vocal album, is also in London, filming an adaptation of “Cats,” and is not expected to attend the show.) And this week U.S.C. released an updated version of its report, showing that the numbers for women working in music have not improved. Looking at Billboard’s year-end Hot 100 list for the last seven years — a total of 633 songs, after removing duplicates — the report found that of 1,455 artists credited on those songs, only 17.1 percent were women. In another finding, only three of those 633 songs were credited solely to female songwriters. “This report really solidifies what we saw last year,” said Stacy L. Smith, the founder of U.S.C.’s Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, and the leader of the study, “and confirms that females are still facing an inclusion crisis in prominent positions in the music space.” Portnow said he viewed last year’s criticism as an opportunity to address important issues, and for the academy to take a leadership role in the industry. Not everyone will be happy, he said, but that’s O.K. “The underlying factors of what makes people happy or unhappy changes from year to year,” he said. “It might be something musical, or it might be something sociological, which is what we’re seeing more of in today’s climate. But that’s appropriate, because that’s the time in history we are living in.” "
5c7d718749f0eacbf105b470,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/04/arts/music/oscars-star-is-born-billboard-chart.html,"Four months after it last topped the Billboard album chart, Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper’s soundtrack to “A Star Is Born” has returned to No. 1 for a fourth time, thanks to the Academy Awards — and some deep-discount pricing on Amazon. “A Star Is Born” was up for eight Oscars on Feb. 24, including best picture, and best actor and actress for Cooper and Lady Gaga. It took home one, best original song, for “Shallow” — which Cooper and Lady Gaga performed on the show, sitting cheek to cheek at the piano. That publicity certainly helped the soundtrack reach No. 1. But so did an Amazon promotion offering downloads of the album at $3.99, which Lady Gaga made sure her 78 million Twitter followers knew about. (A further discount, to $2.99, was moot as far as the chart was concerned; according to Billboard’s rules, only sales made at $3.49 or more count toward an album’s chart position.) “A Star Is Born” ended last week with the equivalent of 128,000 sales in the United States — up about 150 percent from the week before — which included 76,000 copies sold as a full album and nearly 41 million streams, according to Nielsen. That success bumped Ariana Grande’s “Thank U, Next” to No. 2 after two weeks at the top, with the equivalent of 116,000 sales, including 127 million streams but just 19,000 copies sold as a full album. Also this week, two Atlanta rappers reached high positions with brand-new releases: Gunna opened at No. 3 with “Drip or Drown 2,” and Offset, from Migos, landed at No. 4 with his first solo album, “Father of 4.” The soundtrack to the Freddie Mercury biopic “Bohemian Rhapsody” — Queen, his band, opened the Oscars show, with the singer Adam Lambert — is in fifth place.

5c793a1649f0eacbf105add2,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/01/arts/music/ryan-adams-tour-canceled.html,"Ryan Adams’s planned tour of Britain and Ireland, due to start March 30 in Dublin, has been canceled, two weeks after allegations of sexual misconduct against the singer-songwriter emerged. On Friday, SJM Concerts, the tour’s promoter, issued a statement saying the tour had been canceled and that full refunds would be issued to ticket holders by Monday. On Feb. 13, The New York Times reported allegations that Mr. Adams had repeatedly manipulated and harassed women in the music industry, offering to jump-start their careers only to pursue them sexually and in some cases retaliate if they spurned him. [Read The New York Times report here.] The F.B.I. began an investigation into one of the allegations: that Mr. Adams exchanged sexually explicit images with an underage teenager. Mr. Adams has denied the characterizations of his behavior as abusive or manipulative and challenged the accuracy of The Times’ reporting, though he apologized on Twitter “to anyone I have ever hurt, however unintentionally.” Mr. Adams has also denied he has ever engaged in sexual communications with someone he knew was underage. The allegations led to a rapid response in the United States: Mr. Adams’s next album, “Big Colors,” was put on hold indefinitely. Two musical equipment companies that worked with the singer also suspended their relationships with Mr. Adams. Several musicians who had worked with him spoke out in support of the women who made the accusations. But uncertainty had remained over Mr. Adams’s tour of Britain and Ireland despite fans calling for refunds online and in the British media. One fan who paid more than $200 to attend “Ryan’s pinball lair experience” at a concert, a form of V.I.P. package, told The Guardian that she had felt “physically sick” after reading the allegations in The Times. “I don’t want to support such a person,” she added. Despite the pressure, SJM Concerts did not respond to media requests about the tour until Friday. Earlier this week, it appeared that the tour would go on. On Tuesday, a spokesman for London’s Royal Albert Hall, which was to host two concerts, said in an email that SJM Concerts had advised them the concerts were happening. "
5ca1060449f0eacbf1f7afee,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/31/business/media/plagiarism-music-songwriters.html,"It’s not easy to be a songwriter in the pop world these days. Listeners rarely see your name. For anything but a giant hit, royalties from streaming are infinitesimal — and big tech companies seem to want to keep it that way. And then there’s the shadow of “Blurred Lines.” Four years after the copyright trial over that No. 1 song — in which Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams, its primary writers, were ordered to pay more than $5 million for copying Marvin Gaye’s disco-era hit “Got to Give It Up” — the case still looms over the music industry and individual songwriters, who were left to wonder when homage bleeds into plagiarism. Intellectual property lawyers and music executives interviewed for this article said the case had fueled a rise in copyright claims. In September, Ed Sheeran will go to court to defend “Thinking Out Loud,” a Grammy-winning song that has been accused of mimicking another Gaye classic, “Let’s Get It On.” Two years ago, Mr. Sheeran settled another suit by giving up part of his ownership in the Top 10 hit “Photograph,” which was accused of having similarities to “Amazing,” a song by the British singer-songwriter Matt Cardle. The aftereffects of the “Blurred Lines” decision — which was upheld on appeal last year — have been felt most acutely by rank-and-file songwriters, who work in obscurity even as their creations propel others to stardom. The ramifications for them have been inescapable, affecting royalty splits, legal and insurance costs, and even how songs are composed. The songwriter Evan Bogart, who has written for Beyoncé, Rihanna and Madonna, described second-guessing himself in the studio, worried that a melody or lyric might cross a line he can no longer locate. “I shouldn’t be thinking about legal precedent when I am trying to write a chorus,” Mr. Bogart said. Most accusations of plagiarism never go before a judge. Instead, they are settled quietly — and often protected with confidentiality agreements — with the results evident only in the fine print of writing credits. Take “Friends,” a hit last year by the D.J. and producer Marshmello and the singer Anne-Marie. When the song first appeared on the charts, in February 2018, it was credited to three people: Marshmello, Anne-Marie and Nat Dunn, an Australian-born singer and songwriter. By June, after it had climbed to No. 11 on the Billboard chart, and versions of it had racked up more than 640 million YouTube streams, five additional names were listed among the song’s creators. Between the song’s release date and its international success, the three people originally credited as the writers of “Friends” were accused of ripping off a little-heard 2017 song called “Obvious” by the London-based producer Eden Prince, featuring the singer Cassie. The songwriters of “Obvious” included Mr. Prince, three members of a British music collective called the Six and another singer, Jasmine Thompson. They claimed that one line in “Friends” (“Haven’t I made it obvious, haven’t I made it clear?”) infringed on a similar line in “Obvious” (“Did I make it obvious, did I make it clear?”). Ms. Dunn, one of the writers of “Friends,” said in an interview that she believed the claim was “ridiculous,” but that her advisers had instructed her not to fight it and potentially end up in court, where the outcome would be unpredictable. “Everyone was like, ‘Let’s just clear it up and make it go away,’” she recalled. “I reluctantly settled.” Ms. Dunn declined to divulge any details about the settlement terms. Marshmello and Anne-Marie declined to comment, and representatives of the writers of “Obvious” did not respond to inquiries. Copyright disputes are nothing new in music. In the United States, they go back at least as far as a lawsuit over the illicit publication of the sheet music of W. J. Wetmore’s “The Cot Beneath the Hill” in 1844. Occasionally, an outlying case will force industrywide adjustment. In 1976, for example, songwriters had to reckon with the idea of unintended infringement after George Harrison was found to have “subconsciously” based his first solo hit, “My Sweet Lord,” on a girl-group classic, the Chiffons’ “He’s So Fine.” After the decision, Mr. Harrison wrote in his memoir, he felt a “paranoia about songwriting that had started to build up in me.” The “Blurred Lines” case, many lawyers and executives say, has become the latest watershed, putting the commonly understood rules of songwriting up for debate. As songwriters often remark, there are only so many notes in the scale, and influence is essential to the art. Harvey Mason Jr., a songwriter and producer, said the “Blurred Lines” case “unnerved a lot of people writing songs, because a lot of what inspires creative people is the work that has been done before.” It changed the game for the lawyers, too. Edwin F. McPherson, a litigator who did not agree with the “Blurred Lines” decision, said the case had changed the calculus about which copyright cases prevail. “In a normal world, I would say there is a very slim chance,” Mr. McPherson said. “But now I have to add a caveat every time I advise a client: But ‘Blurred Lines.’” At the “Blurred Lines” trial, an eight-person jury heard detailed and esoteric testimony by expert witnesses from both sides about what, if anything, Mr. Thicke and Mr. Williams had copied from “Got to Give It Up.” The Gaye estate contended that specific musical passages had been lifted. Lawyers for Mr. Thicke and Mr. Williams countered that they had simply created a genre piece with a similar groove and feel, the kind of thing that musicians — and copyright lawyers — had long considered fair game. In a dissenting opinion published when the case was upheld last year, Judge Jacqueline H. Nguyen of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit argued that the verdict allowed the Gaye estate “to accomplish what no one has done before: copyright a musical style.” Mr. Thicke was also a fickle witness. He had given interviews citing “Got to Give It Up” as inspiration for his song, only to deny it in depositions, saying he had been intoxicated when talking with music journalists. “I doubt if any more artists will tell Rolling Stone where they got their inspiration,” Tor Erik Hermansen, part of the songwriting and production duo Stargate, said in an interview. Although the case did not result in any changes to copyright law, it has had a palpable effect. More songwriters are arming themselves with expensive insurance policies. And musicologists — academically trained experts who sometimes consult in copyright cases — are in greater demand. “The phone rings more,” said Joe Bennett, a vice president at the Berklee College of Music who also works as an expert witness for hire. But, he added, “a huge number of the inquiries I get are spurious.” Songwriters now face heightened scrutiny of their work while it is still in progress, as record companies and music publishers sometimes vet new songs for echoes of past works. “I’ve had a couple experiences where I was writing something and a lawyer and musicologist said, ‘It sounds like this old song, it’s a very active estate, they’re going to come after you,’” said Mr. Mason, who has worked with stars like Whitney Houston and Kelly Clarkson. “I changed a few notes.” Any settlement can have significant consequences for writers. Just a sliver of streaming revenue is earmarked for songwriting royalties, and most pop songs these days involve small gangs of writers; adding more names to the credits dilutes individual earnings. Ross Golan, a songwriter who hosts the podcast “And the Writer Is ...,” complained that when it comes to negotiations over royalty changes, writers can be left out altogether. When “Talk About You,” a song he wrote with the pop singer Mika and another writer, was released in early 2015, Mr. Golan said, he was surprised to learn that his share of the royalties had been reduced, and that five new names had been added to the credits — all without his knowledge. Mr. Golan said he was furious, but the only action he could take was largely symbolic: refusing to grant permission for a few licensing deals down the line. “I would rather shelve my asset than have someone else sell my integrity,” he said. But Mika acknowledged that the deal was necessary. In a Facebook post at the time, he said that it was “immediately obvious” that “Talk About You” bore a resemblance to two older songs — “Sarà Perché Ti Amo,” a 1981 European hit by the Italian pop group Ricchi e Poveri, and “I Only Want to Be With You,” a widely covered 1963 earworm by Dusty Springfield — and that it was his choice to share credit with the writers of those songs. “Some music comes from no where, some is inspired by other songs and others totally reference them,” Mika wrote. “In that case its always good to be crystal clear before a record even comes out.” Mr. Golan said that what bothered him was less the existence of a deal than the fact that he had no say in it. “If there are/were similarities, they were beyond unintentional,” Mr. Golan wrote in an email. “We’d never heard those songs.” Christine Lepera, a longtime litigator, said there had been no substantial change in the number of music copyright claims that have reached the courts since “Blurred Lines.” But she added that the music industry’s worries over the decision had created a “self-fulfilling prophecy.” “There’s no question in my mind that there has been a chilling effect,” Ms. Lepera said. “People have thrown a lot of weight behind this — more weight than it deserves. Defendants may be more inclined not to put up a fight.” And for songwriters, the impact is still often felt when thoughts about the courtroom intrude in the studio. “I’m not going to stop writing songs,” said Busbee, who has written hits for Keith Urban and Lady Antebellum. “But it puts a massive damper on the process, if you’re concerned that you will be sued.” "
5cab5f5e49f0eacbf1f819bd,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/08/arts/music/beyonce-homecoming-netflix.html,"A year after one of the most critically lauded festival performances in recent pop history, Beychella is coming to Netflix. “Homecoming,” teased by the streaming service as “a film by Beyoncé,” will be available on April 17, according to a trailer released Monday, which shows concert footage and backstage preparations from the singer’s headlining performance at Coachella last year. The documentary will provide an “intimate, in-depth look” at the concert, revealing “the emotional road from creative concept to cultural movement,” Netflix said. The nearly two-hour show at the Empire Polo Club in California featured dozens of musicians backing Beyoncé in the style of historically black college marching bands and traced “a lineage of Southern black musical traditions from New Orleans second line marches to Houston’s chopped-and-screwed hip-hop,” said the critic Jon Caramanica in The New York Times. “There’s not likely to be a more meaningful, absorbing, forceful and radical performance by an American musician this year, or any year soon,” he wrote. “It was rich with history, potently political and visually grand. By turns uproarious, rowdy, and lush. A gobsmacking marvel of choreography and musical direction.” [Read the full review of Beyoncé’s Coachella set.] Beyoncé had been scheduled to headline the festival in 2017, but pushed her performance back a year after becoming pregnant with twins. “Thank you for allowing me to be the first black woman to headline Coachella,” she told the crowd at her comeback show. The trailer for “Homecoming” features clips from rehearsals and Beyoncé’s workout routine, in addition to moments with her children and husband, the rapper Jay-Z, who made a cameo appearance at Coachella. Using a 2013 interview with the poet and activist Maya Angelou, not long before her death the next year, a voice-over on the trailer says, “What I really wanted to do is be a representative of my race — of the human race.” “I have a chance to show how kind we can be, how intelligent and generous we can be,” Angelou continues. “I have a chance to teach and to love and to laugh. And I know that when I finish doing what I’m sent here to do, I will be called home.” "
5c5d90113a125f5075c08b7f,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/08/arts/music/ariana-grande-cardi-b-videos.html,"Welcome to In Her Words, where women rule the headlines. Sign up here to get it delivered to your inbox. Let me know what you think at dearmaya@nytimes.com. “I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it.”— Ariana Grande Bills flying. Backsides shaking. Drinks flowing. And hardly a man in sight.  For as long as there have been music videos, there have been male artists flaunting their riches with zero subtlety and surrounding themselves with gyrating, nearly naked women. But in the past few weeks, two of the world’s most powerful pop stars — women — have reimagined the played-out concept by keeping the outrageous displays of wealth and women’s bodies, but cutting men out of the picture, literally. Ariana Grande and Cardi B, who are up for a collective seven Grammys on Sunday night, recently released videos just weeks apart, in which they expertly extracted the testosterone — in front of and behind the camera. (Both videos were directed by women.)  And while both stars are coming off high-profile breakups, neither song is a lament of lost love, or anything close to it. In fact, the lyrics barely mention men at all.  [Sign up here to get this column, In Her Words, delivered as a newsletter to your inbox.] “Young women right now have a kind of outlaw energy in our public sphere,” Ann Powers, NPR Music’s critic, told me this week. “Economic independence is a central part of their sexiness, a central part of their glamour,” she said.  The video for “7 Rings,” by Grande, whose new album dropped today, is dedicated entirely to her staggering wealth, which she boasts about defiantly — lavishing herself and her band of tattooed, braid-whipping besties with drinks and diamonds.  “I don’t mean to brag, but I be like, ‘Put it in the bag,’” sings Grande, 25, about reaching a level of success that allows her to buy whatever she wants. In “Money,” Cardi B presents a hyper-glam, gold-encrusted, nudity-packed celebration of cash and the women proudly in pursuit of it.  The video famously includes a scene where she is breast-feeding her baby, peppered amid images of women shooting money guns and dancing on poles while other women (and only women) shower them in bills.  “I don’t really need the D, I need the money,” Cardi B, 26, raps.  The messages Grande and Cardi B are sending — these recent music videos have about 140 million and 45 million views on YouTube — may feel new and particularly relevant in this era, but music has a storied history of female artists flexing their independence and money, Powers said.  In the 1920s, the blues artists Bessie Smith and Ma Rainey sang about having money of their own and being supported by other women. (Rainey’s nickname was “the gold-neck woman” because she piled on gold jewelry.) Then there were Aretha Franklin, Janis Joplin, Dolly Parton, Annie Lennox and Madonna, among others, who have been forces of women’s empowerment in pop music. More recently, we have Beyoncé and Rihanna leading the feminist charge in pop by celebrating other women and being unapologetic about their success and their sexuality.  Despite all that, the music business remains male-dominated, Powers said. But these women — and more of them — are increasingly saying, “‘O.K., we’re going to do it for ourselves.’” ______ Our gender editor, Jessica Bennett, writes:  “Long before the age of Twitter, ‘Letters to the Editor’ sections of newspapers were how citizens engaged in public discourse. And yet those letters — like their more modern counterpart, the comments sections — remain predominantly written by men. (By our rough estimate, women account for about a quarter of New York Times letters submissions — although they do tend to write in greater numbers about issues like education, health, gender and children.)  Earlier this month, The Times said it would strive for parity in its Letters section. And we need your help to make it happen.

In this 2003 article, the music critic Kelefa Sanneh reviewed Beyoncé’s debut solo album, “Dangerously in Love” and Ashanti’s “Chapter II,” which were released a week apart.  About Beyoncé, he wrote: “Maybe this album is merely a misstep, and maybe Beyoncé has yet to record the brilliant solo album that people expected. Or maybe it's proof that she isn’t quite as versatile as she seemed.” “Dangerously in Love” went on to become a multiplatinum album, selling over 15 million copies worldwide.

5c5361323a125f5075c0765b,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/arts/music/michael-jackson-timeline-sexual-abuse-accusations.html,"During the later part of his career, Michael Jackson faced several allegations that he molested young boys. The police investigated him in 1993. Another accusation led to a trial in 2005 that became a pop culture spectacle, complete with crowds of supporters waiting outside the courthouse. Jackson was acquitted and died four years later while preparing for a string of concert dates he hoped would revive his career. A new documentary, “Leaving Neverland,” has rekindled interest in the accusations. The film had its debut at the Sundance Film Festival and airs on HBO March 3 and 4. [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] In August 1993, when Jackson was still a major star on the pop charts and touring to support his album “Dangerous,” the Los Angeles Police Department began investigating claims that Jackson had molested a 13-year-old boy. Executing search warrants for a condominium in Los Angeles and Jackson’s Neverland Ranch in Santa Barbara County, Calif., the police seized videotapes but found no incriminating evidence. On Sept. 14, while Jackson was on tour in Moscow, the boy’s parents sued the star, saying that Jackson had “repeatedly committed sexual battery” on their son. Among the accusations were that Jackson had performed oral sex on the boy and masturbated him. Anthony Pellicano, a private investigator working for Jackson, called the suit part of an extortion attempt. “A demand for $20 million was made and presented,” he said. “It was flatly and consistently refused.” (Years later, Pellicano, known as a top Hollywood “fixer,” was accused of making death threats against journalists, and in 2008 was sentenced to 15 years in prison for illegal wiretapping.) As the case drew headlines, the Jackson camp introduced the news media to children who gave interviews supporting the star. One, a 10-year-old boy named Wade Robson, told CNN about harmless “slumber parties” in Jackson’s bedroom. As prosecutors continued to pursue a criminal case, another boy, James Safechuck, who had appeared with Jackson in a Pepsi commercial, gave sworn testimony on Jackson’s behalf. On Dec. 20, 1993, Jackson was strip-searched by police at Neverland, and photographs were taken of his genitals to compare to a description given by the boy. Two days later, Jackson spoke on live television, denying the accusations and excoriating the news media. “I am not guilty of these allegations,” Jackson said. “But if I am guilty of anything, it is of giving all that I have to give to help children all over the world.” In January 1994, Jackson settled the case for $23 million, with $5 million going to the family’s lawyers. Prosecutors dropped the criminal case after the boy declined to cooperate. [Michael Jackson cast a spell. “Leaving Neverland” breaks it, our critic writes.] In February 2003, with Jackson’s music career in decline, the documentary “Living With Michael Jackson,” based on interviews by the journalist Martin Bashir, was broadcast in Britain and the United States. In it, Jackson openly discussed sharing his bedroom with a young cancer survivor, and called people who object to such behavior “ignorant.” The documentary sparked a criminal investigation, and in December, Jackson was charged with child molesting, serving alcohol to a minor, conspiracy and kidnapping. He faced up to 20 years in prison. Jackson’s trial began on Feb. 28, 2005. Throughout, the global news media paid close attention to Jackson’s erratic behavior, like arriving in floral pajamas. The boy from the documentary, who was 14 at the time of the trial, testified that Jackson had masturbated him. His brother said he had witnessed the abuse, and that Jackson had showed them both pornography and served them wine, calling it “Jesus juice.” A former housekeeper, Blanca Francia, said she had seen Jackson taking a shower with Wade Robson, the young man who had spoken to the media in support of Jackson in 1993. Jackson’s lawyers portrayed the boy at the center of the case and his family as practiced grifters, and several witnesses who had been close with Jackson as children — like the actor Macaulay Culkin, then 24 years old — took the stand to deny any abuse. Robson, by this point a choreographer for stars like Britney Spears, testified that he had spent the night at Neverland more than 20 times but that Jackson had never molested him or taken a shower with him. Safechuck, who had defended Jackson earlier, did not testify. Jackson was found not guilty of all charges on June 13, 2005; outside the courthouse, a fan released 10 white doves, one for each count that was acquitted. Jackson died four years later, at age 50, on the eve of a comeback attempt. [Will “Leaving Neverland” imperil the thriving Michael Jackson estate?] In 2013, four years after Jackson’s death, Robson sued the star’s estate, saying that Jackson had molested him for seven years, beginning when he was age 7. In an interview on the “Today” show, he said that “brainwashing” by Jackson had led him to testify on the star’s behalf. Lawyers for Jackson’s estate blasted Robson’s credibility, saying that in the past he had repeatedly denied abuse. Robson’s case was later thrown out by a judge for being filed too late. Safechuck filed his own suit in 2014, saying that Jackson had abused him “hundreds” of times from 1988 to 1992, beginning when a 10-year-old Safechuck — and his mother — accompanied Jackson on his “Bad” concert tour. According to his complaint, Jackson kissed Safechuck’s genitals and gave him jewelry as rewards for performing sexual acts. His case was also dismissed. Both men’s suits are under appeal. On Jan. 25, “Leaving Neverland,” a two-part, four-hour film by Dan Reed, with Robson and Safechuck describing accusations of abuse in great detail, opened at the Sundance Film Festival. Before the screening, the festival director told the audience that health care providers were available to help anyone disturbed by the film. The Jackson estate condemned the film as “yet another lurid production in an outrageous and pathetic attempt to exploit and cash in on Michael Jackson.” In a statement, the Jackson family called it “a public lynching” and added: “We are furious that the media, who without a shred of proof or single piece of physical evidence, chose to believe the word of two admitted liars over the word of hundreds of families and friends around the world who spent time with Michael, many at Neverland, and experienced his legendary kindness and global generosity.” The estate also filed a petition in Los Angeles Superior Court for arbitration against HBO, saying that with “Leaving Neverland” the channel was in breach of a nondisparagement clause in a 1992 contract for a Jackson concert film. The estate said it was seeking damages that “could exceed $100 million.” "
5c532ed93a125f5075c0756f,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/arts/music/michael-jackson-leaving-neverland-accusations.html,"Michael Jackson was quite possibly the most famous entertainer of the 20th century. When he died in June 2009, it seemed like the long-boiling national conversation around the multiple allegations of child molestation against him died, too; the focus instead shifted to his planned This Is It comeback concerts, his unreleased songs and a musical legacy that includes hundred of millions of albums sold. But on Jan. 25, the Sundance Film Festival debuted the four-hour documentary “Leaving Neverland,” which details accusations of abuse, almost instantly reopening the discussion on one of the most notorious scandals in music history. (The film airs in two parts on HBO March 3 and 4.) If you didn’t know why Jackson is leading the news cycle nearly 10 years after his death, here’s a brief explainer. [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] “Leaving Neverland” is a two-part mini-series focusing on the allegations of two men who say Michael Jackson abused them as children. It’s directed by the British documentarian Dan Reed, who directed the 2016 HBO doc “Three Days of Terror: The Charlie Hebdo Attacks.” Wade Robson, a choreographer who has worked with Britney Spears, and James Safechuck, a computer programmer who appeared in commercials as a child actor, said they met Jackson when they were 7 and 10, and assert that he molested them for years. Robson and Safechuck (who appeared alongside Jackson in a memorable 1987 Pepsi commercial) detail allegations like mutual masturbation, oral and anal sexual acts, alcohol, lavish gifts and pornography. Robson, who says Jackson nicknamed him “Little One,” describes what he says was the singer’s methods to keep him from speaking out. Safechuck talks about a secret “wedding” he had with Jackson, and the ring he still has in his possession, saying Jackson gave him jewelry in exchange for sexual favors. Both men supported Jackson during a 2005 trial for molestation and denied he had abused them. However Robson and Safechuck both sued Jackson’s estate after the star’s death. Robson said Jackson molested him for seven years, and Safechuck said he and Jackson engaged in sexual acts “hundreds” of times. Both cases were dismissed and are under appeal.. At the Sundance screening, Rolling Stone reported, “By the end of the screening, the crowd looked completely shellshocked,” adding, “It was hard not to feel like a bombshell had been dropped.” The Guardian reported that, “After the film ended, an ashen-faced crowd rose to their feet to applaud Wade and James, who arrived on stage, both visibly moved by the response.” [See a timeline of the accusations Michael Jackson faced.] The family released a statement that called the documentary a “public lynching.” “We are furious that the media, who without a shred of proof or single piece of physical evidence, chose to believe the word of two admitted liars over the word of hundreds of families and friends around the world who spent time with Michael, many at Neverland, and experienced his legendary kindness and global generosity,” the statement reads. “The creators of this film were not interested in the truth. They never interviewed a single solitary soul who knew Michael except the two perjurers and their families.” Jermaine Jackson, Michael’s older brother and former bandmate in the Jackson 5, appeared on “Good Morning Britain” and called the allegations “nonsense” while defending Jackson’s practice of sleeping in bed with children. “Those were slumber parties. And what they didn’t tell you was there were little girls there, even with their parents, their uncles. And they were sitting down, watching movies,” Jermaine Jackson said. Yes. In 1993, the family of a 13-year-old boy filed a $30 million lawsuit saying Jackson sexually abused their son, including allegations of kissing, fondling and oral sex. The suit was settled out of court in 1994 for around $23 million. A cancer survivor who appeared by Jackson’s side in the Martin Bashir television documentary “Living With Michael Jackson” was 14 when authorities formally charged Jackson with molesting him. During the 14-week criminal trial in 2005, the boy’s younger brother said that Jackson showed them pornography, masturbated in front of them, served them alcohol and molested his brother on two occasions. Jackson was found not guilty. “Don’t Stop ’Til You Get Enough,” a musical based on the years leading up to Jackson’s 1992 Dangerous tour, was expected to start in late October in Chicago with an aim to hit Broadway in 2020; in February, the planned Chicago tryout was canceled due to what the producers called “scheduling difficulties” caused by a labor dispute. The show is produced by the Michael Jackson Estate and Columbia Live Stage, and features a book written by the two-time Pulitzer winner Lynn Nottage. "
5c50dc473a125f5075c06fb9,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/29/obituaries/edwin-birdsong-dies.html,"Edwin Birdsong, a keyboard player and producer whose blend of funk, jazz and disco music from the 1970s and ′80s developed a cult following and was sampled by a later generation of artists, died on Jan. 21 in Inglewood, Calif. He was 77. His daughter Angela Birdsong said on Tuesday that the cause was not certain, but that Mr. Birdsong had suffered several strokes in the past and had congestive heart failure. Mr. Birdsong released a handful of solo albums, among them “What It Is” (1972), “Super Natural” (1973) and “Edwin Birdsong” (1979), but they achieved only limited success, and he turned to working as a sought-after session musician and producer for better-known acts. In the late 1980s, however, sample-hungry producers rediscovered Mr. Birdsong’s work, notably the songs “Rapper Dapper Snapper” and “Cola Bottle Baby.” The percussion and bass line of “Rapper Dapper Snapper” were an important part of “Me, Myself and I,” the breakout hit on De La Soul’s debut album, “3 Feet High and Rising” (1989). The song was also sampled on the Gang Starr song “Skills” in 2003. “Cola Bottle Baby,” an energetic tribute to women of a certain shape, became the basis of a very different kind of dance music when the French electronic duo Daft Punk used it for the hit “Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger” on their second album, “Discovery” (2001). Kanye West repurposed “Cola” yet again when he sampled Daft Punk’s single to make an even bigger hit, “Stronger,” on his third album, “Graduation” (2007). In an interview with the online audio program Jazz Under the Bridge in 2016, Mr. Birdsong said he felt “blessed” to see his creations reinvented, adding, “God gives the music to all of the musicians around the world.” Edwin Lee Birdsong was born on Aug. 22, 1941, in Shreveport, La., to Sidney and Josephine (Page) Birdsong. His father was a Baptist minister, and Edwin grew up playing the piano in church. The family moved to Los Angeles when Edwin was young, and he graduated from high school there in 1959 before serving in the Army. For a time he was stationed in Germany, where he played piano in bars. After returning to the states, he studied music at the Manhattan School of Music and the Juilliard School without graduating from either. Mr. Birdsong worked with Stevie Wonder and was a frequent collaborator with Roy Ayers, the jazz, funk and soul vibraphone player. One of his collaborations with Mr. Ayers, “Running Away,” was sampled by A Tribe Called Quest on “Description of a Fool,” the last song on their first album, the hip-hop classic “People’s Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm” (1990). Mr. Birdsong’s three marriages ended in divorce. He lived in Victorville, Calif. In addition to his daughter Angela, he is survived by five other daughters, Linda Owens and Robin, Tia, Shebibah and Candice Birdsong; three sons, Sterling, Singh and Anthony; three sisters, Linda Ticer, Elzater Williams and Lemonia Golden; a brother, Sheldon; eight grandchildren; and six great-grandchildren.

5cb1e2bc49f0eacbf1f83bc8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/13/arts/music/coachella-guava-island-donald-glover.html,"“Guava Island,” a new 55-minute film starring Donald Glover and Rihanna, was released as a limited-time free stream on Amazon overnight Saturday, during Glover’s headlining set as Childish Gambino at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. The mysterious project, which has been teased for months, features Glover as Deni, a singer hoping to bring the mystical island of Guava together with a music festival, while Rihanna plays his girlfriend, Kofi, and provides voice-over during a fairy-tale-like animated introduction about the fictional location and its valuable blue silk. Nonso Anozie (“Game of Thrones”) and Letitia Wright (“Black Panther”) also appear. With a plot involving exploited workers, the struggles of musicians and a society divided between red and blue, the film incorporates themes present in much of Glover’s recent work, from the hit FX series ""Atlanta"" to his viral, Grammy-winning song and video for “This Is America,” which is interpolated in “Guava Island.” [Read the NYT review of “Guava Island.”] The film was written by Glover’s brother Stephen and directed by his longtime collaborator Hiro Murai, who was also behind the camera for much of “Atlanta” and “This Is America.” Following its premiere on the grounds of Coachella on Thursday, and the Childish Gambino show on Friday night, “Guava Island” was made available for anyone to watch on Amazon for 18 hours starting Saturday at 12:01 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time; it will then be available exclusively to Amazon Prime subscribers. Shot in Cuba and inspired by the Brazilian crime epic “City of God” and Prince’s “Purple Rain,” “Guava Island” does not ultimately feature much new music from Childish Gambino — or any singing from Rihanna. The movie opens with a breezy unreleased number from Glover (“If the world ends/I think I wanna die with you”) and has elements of another song with the lyrics, “Maybe the sky will fall down on tomorrow/but one thing’s for certain baby/we’re running out of time.” It also incorporates alternate versions of recent Childish Gambino singles like “Summertime Magic” and “Feels Like Summer,” along with “Saturday,” which Glover debuted on “Saturday Night Live” last year (“God, this 9 to 5 just keep on killing me,” he sings). In one scene set in a factory, another character tells Deni that he hopes to save enough money to make it to America. “It’s different there,” the man says. “I heard people are their own bosses.” Deni responds: “This is America. Guava’s no different than any other country,” adding, “America is a concept. Anywhere where in order to make yourself rich, you have to make someone else richer is America.” He then leads a choreographed dance to the song that mirrors some of the music video. At Coachella on Friday night, Glover — who has thrown his own festival, Pharos — did not make a show of plugging “Guava Island,” though he did incorporate tropical imagery and sounds into his set. For one unreleased song, he cleared a section in the crowd to scream over a cacophonous burst of complex drum rhythms, bathed in almost-apocalyptic red lights. He also performed the still-unreleased track “Human Sacrifice,” which debuted in a Google ad during the Grammy Awards in February. Glover was overcome by emotion onstage while discussing the deaths of his father and the rappers Mac Miller and Nipsey Hussle. “What I’m starting to realize is all we really have is memories at the end of the day,” he told the crowd. “All we are really is like, data — you pass it on to your kids, you pass it on to your friends, your family.” “While we’re here,” Glover added, “feel something and pass it on.” "

5c7c951049f0eacbf105b2af,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/03/arts/television/leaving-neverland-recap.html,"Filmgoers who saw “Leaving Neverland” when it debuted at the Sundance Film Festival in January called it “devastating,” “harrowing,” and “more disturbing than you could imagine.” Many of those who saw the documentary when Part One aired on HBO Sunday were just as stunned when they heard for themselves the accounts of two men who say Michael Jackson sexually abused them as boys. At the same time, Jackson fans swarmed Twitter, criticizing the documentary and his accusers. By the time he died at age 50 in 2009, Jackson had been trailed by allegations of child sexual abuse for more than 15 years. But “Leaving Neverland” contains granular, disturbing detail that could reshape his legacy for years to come: A secret system of bells to warn when other adults were approaching. A mock wedding ceremony with a young boy, complete with a gold ring studded with diamonds. Parents who were only too happy to be guests at Neverland, unaware what was happening to their sons a few closed doors away. The Michael Jackson estate has denied all of the allegations, likened the documentary to a character attack and sued HBO. Part Two airs on Monday night, but is already available to stream on HBO Go and HBO Now. [Michael Jackson’s fans are tenacious. | Our critic Wesley Morris reviews the documentary.] Here are some key points and a sampling of more viewer reactions from Part One: The movie shows how two boys and their families were pulled deep into Jackson’s orbit through fame and show business. Wade Robson, an aspiring dancer who became a successful choreographer as an adult, met Jackson after winning a dance competition. His mother, Joy, went so far as to move herself, Wade and her daughter to Los Angeles from their native Australia, leaving behind her husband and eldest son, on promises that Jackson would work with them to make Wade a star. James Safechuck met Jackson when he was cast in a Pepsi commercial that featured Jackson, and at age 10, Safechuck joined Jackson on tour. His mother, Stephanie, recounts meeting celebrities like Sean Connery, flying first class and being chauffeured in limousines. James describes the otherworldly frenzy of just walking with Jackson to his car, slicing through waves of screaming fans. Every night, he said, he would sleep in a hotel room with Jackson. His mother recounts that as the tour went on, her room got farther and farther from the one her son and Jackson shared. “Everybody wanted to meet Michael or be with Michael,” James Safechuck says as the film opens. “He was already larger than life. And then he likes you.” He nurtured relationships, including with the boys’ mothers. He spent hours on the phone with James and Wade, but he would also call their moms, just to talk to them. Jackson also spent time at the Safechucks’ modest home in Simi Valley, Calif. He could have been anywhere in the world, Stephanie Safechuck said, but he chose to be with them. “He was a son I started to take care for,” Stephanie Safechuck said. “He would spend the night, I’d wash his clothes.” She said that she once told Jackson that she had prayed for her son’s success in getting into commercials, and that he went on to find success right away. In response, she said, Jackson told her that he had prayed, too. He had prayed for a friend, and then he found James. The Neverland Ranch was Jackson’s California compound that included an arcade, an amusement park, an assortment of exotic animals and a train station. It was the perfect playground for children, and in the documentary it is also portrayed as the perfect place to keep children apart from their parents. Robson’s and Safechuck’s families were offered rooms in a guesthouse, which was separate from the main house where the boys would each stay with Jackson. Wade Robson’s mother, Joy, recounts that she got the sense during one long visit that her son and Jackson were avoiding her — and in such a big place, that was easy to do. She said she spent a lot of time alone and with Jackson’s chimpanzees. [“Leaving Neverland” could threaten the fortunes of Jackson’s thriving estate.] One of the most uncomfortable sequences in the film is when James Safechuck recounts all the places in Neverland where he said that he and Jackson had sex: On a blanket in Jackson’s closet, where several doors and a system of bells would alert them if someone was coming. In a private screening room at the back of the movie theater. In a house filled with Jackson’s memorabilia, such as a rhinestone jacket he wore to the Grammys. In an attic. In a castle in the theme park. In an upstairs room in the train station. The property had been for sale for several years, with an asking price as high as $100 million, and was recently listed with new brokers for $31 million. James Safechuck takes a small gold ring, studded with diamonds, out of a jewelry box and slips it onto his finger. It doesn’t fit past the fingernail of his adult hand. This was the ring, he said, that he and Jackson used in a mock wedding ceremony. When they went to a jewelry store to pick it out, they pretended Jackson was buying it for a woman whose hands were small, like the boy’s. As each sits alone in front of the camera, Robson and Safechuck recount a frightening pattern of abuse by Jackson, made even more disturbing by the similarities between them. Both said Jackson would ask them to get on all fours so he could look at them from behind while he masturbated. He asked them to rub his nipples. He would perform oral sex on them and they on him. He showed them pornography. Safechuck says the abuse started when he was 10. Robson says it began when he was 7. They say it went on for years. Jackson was the subject of two child molestation investigations during his lifetime. The first time, Jackson reached a settlement with the boy who accused him and no charges were filed against him. The second time, after a trial, Jackson was acquitted. [Read a timeline of Jackson’s history of sexual abuse allegations.] Jackson’s defenders have pointed out that both Safechuck and Robson have told the authorities in the past that they were not molested by Jackson, and that Robson took the stand in Jackson’s defense during the trial. Both men said that Jackson had trained them for those moments for years, drilling into them that if anyone found out, their lives would be over, or that he and they would go to jail. The Jackson family and his estate have emphatically denied the allegations, though neither they nor any other Jackson supporters appear in the film. “The creators of this film were not interested in the truth,” the family said in a statement. “They never interviewed a single solitary soul who knew Michael except the two perjurers and their families.” The statement said that Jackson “was and always will be 100 percent innocent of these false allegations.” Last month, the coexecutors of Jackson’s estate sued HBO and its parent company, Time Warner, for $100 million for breach of contract, saying that by airing the documentary, HBO violated a nondisparagement clause in a 1992 contract it signed before airing a Jackson concert in Romania. HBO said it would not change course. “Despite the desperate lengths taken to undermine the film, our plans remain unchanged,” HBO said in a statement. “This will allow everyone the opportunity to assess the film and the claims in it for themselves.” Devoted Jackson fans had been girding themselves for the documentary, and through a loose network of pro-Jackson websites and hashtags began planning to counteract the film. When it began, they overwhelmed the #LeavingNeverland hashtag with thousands of tweets calling the men liars and the film a work of fiction. The celebrity gossip and news feed Baller Alert also posted a series of skeptical tweets. The Jackson estate encouraged people to watch the Romanian concert instead. And Taj Jackson, the singer’s nephew and longtime defender, parried with a critic. But as Part One moved into more disturbing territory, viewers began reacting with disgust, shock and sadness. Some asked why the men’s parents had allowed them to get so close to Jackson. The second half of the documentary, airing on HBO Monday night and available for streaming now, moves through Jackson’s trial, introduces Robson’s and Safechuck’s wives, and takes the audience through their decision, after years of publicly proclaiming Jackson’s innocence, to come forward with their accounts.

5c50f2d13a125f5075c06fea,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/29/obituaries/james-ingram-dead.html,"James Ingram, whose voice — technically precise, crisp and reserved, yet full of audacious feeling — made him one of the defining singers of R&B in the 1980s, has died. He was 66. The actress and choreographer Debbie Allen, a frequent collaborator with Mr. Ingram on musical theater projects, announced his death on Twitter on Tuesday, calling him her “dearest friend and creative partner.” She did not say where or when he died or specify the cause. Just as R&B’s “quiet storm” phase was peaking, Mr. Ingram was plucked from side-gig obscurity by the producer Quincy Jones to appear on his 1981 album, “The Dude.” Mr. Jones discovered Mr. Ingram on a demo of “Just Once,” written by Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil, which he sang for $50. Mr. Jones loved not just the song but the singer as well, and he called Mr. Ingram — who initially hung up on him — and invited him to perform “Just Once” and another song, “One Hundred Ways,” on that album. Both songs became huge hits, cracking the Top 20 of the Billboard Hot 100. “One Hundred Ways” earned Mr. Ingram a Grammy in 1982 for best male R&B vocal performance. Up until Mr. Jones rang him up, Mr. Ingram had been content in the background. “I was never no singer; I never shopped a deal, none of that,” he told The Chicago Tribune in 2012. But his voice — austere, luscious, commanding — was foreground material. His music was gentlemanly and romantic, the aural equivalent of being courted. Mr. Ingram was born on Feb. 16, 1952, and raised in Akron, Ohio. He sang in a church choir — his father was a deacon — and taught himself to play piano. After high school, he passed up a track scholarship to focus on music, eventually moving to Los Angeles. When Mr. Jones discovered him, Mr. Ingram had been inching his way into the music business for about a decade. He had been a pianist for Ray Charles; played in a band, Revelation Funk, which contributed a song to the soundtrack of the 1975 movie “Dolemite”; played in one of Dick Clark’s support bands; and done side work as a demo singer. After the success of “Just Once” and “One Hundred Ways,” Mr. Ingram became a force in R&B. In 1982 he recorded a duet with Patti Austin, “Baby, Come to Me,” which reached No. 1 on the Hot 100. In 1983 he released his first solo album, “It’s Your Night,” which featured several hits, including another duet with Ms. Austin, “How Do You Keep the Music Playing?,” and “Yah Mo B There,” a duet with Michael McDonald that would earn Ingram his second Grammy, in 1985. (He was nominated a total of 14 times.) Throughout the 1980s, Mr. Ingram worked with Mr. Jones on several other projects: participating in the all-star charity single “We Are the World”; writing for the soundtrack of Steven Spielberg’s film “The Color Purple” (1985); singing on Mr. Jones’s 1989 album, “Back on the Block”; and, most crucially, writing, with Jones, Michael Jackson’s 1983 Top 10 hit “P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing).” “It’s almost like I got the chance to go to Oz and Quincy was the Wizard of Oz and Michael Jackson was who he was dealing with in his world,” Mr. Ingram told Jet magazine in 2007. In a statement, Mr. Jones said: “There are no words to convey how much my heart aches with the news of the passing of my baby brother James Ingram. With that soulful, whisky-sounding voice, James Ingram was simply magical.” Later in the 1980s and into the ’90s, a time when songs from hit films often became radio hits too, Mr. Ingram was a soundtrack favorite. “Somewhere Out There,” a duet with Linda Ronstadt from the animated feature “An American Tail,” was one of biggest chart successes, reaching No. 2. He was heard on the soundtracks of “Beverly Hills Cop II,” “Forget Paris” and “City Slickers.” As a writer, Mr. Ingram was twice nominated for best original song at both the Academy Awards and the Golden Globe Awards: in 1994, for “The Day I Fall in Love” from “Beethoven’s 2nd,” and in 1995, for “Look What Love Has Done” from “Junior.” “I Don’t Have the Heart,” a song from his third album, “It’s Real,” reached No. 1 in 1990, but Mr. Ingram released music less frequently in the following decades. In 2008 he released a gospel album, “Stand (in the Light),” and he spoke frequently about his faith on “The 700 Club,” on the Christian Broadcasting Network. Mr. Ingram’s survivors include his wife, Debra, whom he married in 1975. Complete information on survivors was not immediately available. "
5c77a37149f0eacbf105a995,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/28/arts/television/michael-jackson-leaving-neverland.html,"If the average cultural experience demands the suspension of disbelief, if we oughtn’t think too much about this movie we’re watching, this novel we’re reading, this magic trick being performed right before our eyes, if being entertained means setting aside skepticism, logic and possibly a sense of morality, then what a magic trick we had in Michael Jackson. He lived in defiance of physics and race and gender, and we just kind of lived with that. We ate it up. Just the odyssey of his nose from bulb to nub seemed somehow like a people’s journey. For so long, so much about Michael Jackson won our awe, our pity, our bewilderment, our identification, our belief that he was a metaphor, an allegory, a beacon, a caveat — for, of, about America. You need to do a lot of looking at him to feel this way. You also need to do a lot of looking the other way. But, eventually, all the suspension reaches a logical end. You run out of hooks to hang things on. There’s a moment in “Leaving Neverland,” Dan Reed’s documentary about Jackson’s alleged pedophilia, where I simply ran out of hooks. The movie devotes itself to two men, Wade Robson and James Safechuck, who claim, in separate accounts, that Jackson sexually abused them for years, from boyhood into adolescence. [Michael Jackson’s history of sexual abuse accusations.] And of all the allegations, the moment that really got me is the ring. Now, this is 90 minutes into a four-hour movie, which HBO is showing in two parts starting Sunday, and I’ve learned how Jackson has ingratiated himself into two families, starting around 1987 or ’88, after the release of his album “Bad,” during his world tour. I’ve heard a recording of a mock interview Jackson does with Safechuck, a solidly middle-class Southern California boy, in which Jackson says the best part of a trip to Hawaii that he arranged for the boy and his mom was “being with James Safechuck.” I’ve stared at a lingering shot of a photograph of Jackson, who would have been around 30 and Safechuck who was about 9 or 10, and Jackson is beaming in sunglasses and a military jacket, flashing a peace sign, and James, in a too-big baseball cap, is turning to the camera, looking alarmingly ruminative for someone whose life should be rumination-free. By the time you get to the ring, I’ve already heard how Jackson lured Safechuck into sex, by masturbation (James, again, is about 10), and how the closer he got to James on tour, the farther the parents’ hotel room would get from their son’s. The way Safechuck remembers it, there was so much sex, and he says Jackson told him that if anybody found out about it, their lives would be over. I’ve heard about Michael buying the Neverland complex in Santa Barbara County, Calif., (mansion, amusement park, zoo!) and the elaborate system of doors and bells to alert Jackson of any encroachment on the lair in which some of the abuse supposedly occurred. I’ve seen Wade Robson, a doll-faced Michael Jackson impersonator from Brisbane, Australia, say he was 7 when Michael began abusing him, describing a grim scenario in which he was naked on all fours at the edge of the bed, poised — trapped — between his idol, who was masturbating to him, and a cutout of Peter Pan. I’ve heard all of this — and a distressing deal more — by the time the documentary gets to the part where Jackson allegedly takes Safechuck shopping for a ring. But there’s something about the way the filmmakers reserve this scene for the back end of Part 1 that ices your bones, something about the way an adult Safechuck doesn’t seem to want to go back there. But here he is, talking in a TV documentary about the vows he says that he and Jackson exchanged. Here he is, forlorn, holding the ring that he’s kept, all this time, in a handsome box. The story of the ring and the vows feels as graphic as the memories of masturbation and French kissing and nipple tweaking. If you happen to be the sort of person who’d try to balance, say, the multiple counts of child molestation Jackson was charged with in 2003 and acquitted of later with extenuating details from Jackson’s biography (Wasn’t he abused and too famous too soon and prematurely sexualized? He never had a childhood! He’s still a child!), if you partook in the steady diet of fluffy news stories about Jackson and some little boy (often identified as “Jackson’s friend”) and thought mostly that they were cute or banal and that Jackson just related to kids as kids — like, platonically — if you thought that he couldn’t know there was a real difference between adult passion and child’s play, then perhaps you’ll find Safechuck’s memory of the ring particularly shattering. I did. It’s so private and wrong, not just to us but clearly to Jackson, who makes up a story at the jewelry store that the ring is for a woman, even though Safechuck is there by his side. He knew. I’m staring at the coat rack looking for somewhere to suspend more disbelief, and there’s no more room. I have to hold this.  “LEAVING NEVERLAND” is long but delicately, patiently done — and so quiet; you can practically hear yourself listening. It’s not a feat of investigative journalism so much as an act of bearing witness. Reed sits, individually, with Safechuck and his mother, Stephanie, and with Robson and his mother, Joy, and his siblings, Chantal and Shane. It doesn’t try to make cultural or political sense of the allegations. It’s not a masterpiece saga about fame, race, gender, sexuality and the legal system; it’s not “M.J.: Made in America.” (For a long view, there’s “On Michael Jackson,” Margo Jefferson’s pungent, essential critical X-ray from 2006.) “Leaving Neverland” is about one man’s possible contribution to the ruin of two families and the anguish that still disturbs them and, in some way, how that ruin and anguish should disturb us. The movie presents Jackson almost entirely from the two families’ points of view, in photographs, answering machine messages and a montage of lovey-dovey faxes he sent to his “little one,” which is what Wade remembers Jackson calling him. He even remembers the lullaby Jackson built around the phrase. The movie recreates for us the haze Jackson cast over them. Its only moments of disputation arrive in the form of television, from, say, Jackson’s defense lawyers during the 2004-5 trial, and, in 1993, from Jackson himself, in a recorded statement against molestation charges brought by the father of Jordan Chandler. (It was nationally broadcast, as news.) Reed appears to have encouraged everyone in the movie to try to be in the original moment as best they can. For James, Wade and the rest of the on-camera participants (Wade’s grandmother is here, too, as are, in Part 2, both men’s wives), they seem happy enough in the early telling, when everyone’s a little star-struck. So the movie has a real emotional arc — as well as an abundance of orchestral strings and too many handsome drone shots. The tears don’t come until well into hour four. James, though, appears to be reliving it all. He winces, cringes and grimaces; he does a lot of nervous neck scratching. It’s here that I should offer the Jackson estate’s disclaimer. It vehemently denies what James and Wade allege, and is suing HBO for $100 million. The movie breaches a nondisparagement clause in a contract with Jackson from the early 1990s, according to the suit. Around 1993, James and Wade told the authorities that Jackson didn’t molest them; and Wade testified in court on Jackson’s behalf in 2005. Several years ago, both men filed lawsuits against the estate that were dismissed because of statutes of limitations. And their suits are now under appeal. Fatherhood and, presumably, therapy have encouraged both men to reverse their stories, acknowledge what they believe happened to them and tell their families that they lied about not being abused. This is a strategy that puts a lot of faith in the accusers and obviates the possibility of counterargument. Much is asserted and nothing’s proven, and yet you do come to understand how a mix of showbiz and fandom brought so many boys into Jackson’s life. James starred in a 1986 Pepsi commercial with him. Wade’s uncannily sharp impersonation wins him some nights onstage during the “Bad” tour. Both Stephanie and Joy, the mothers, seem proud to have raised sons so appealing to the planet’s most worshiped person. He tells the Safechucks how lonely he is. And so, in an alarming throwaway detail, the family starts disguising Jackson in order to sneak him out of Hayvenhurst, his pre-Neverland estate, and into their normal, suburban house. It’s like he actually was E.T. At the Safechucks, Jackson could be a regular, what exactly, kid? We do see Polaroids of him sans make up, doing funny faces, looking guilelessly happy, so yeah, sure: a kid.  HAVING STEPHANIE AND JOY speak here as much as they do is a relief for any number of reasons. But let’s just focus on two. First, they’ve had some time to process all of this. They’re lucid. Jackson’s trial, conducted on behalf of a 13-year-old, Gavin Arvizo, featured testimony from Janet Arvizo, the boy’s mother, who spent five days on the stand and, by most accounts, was a terrible witness for her son. She claimed Jackson imprisoned her family, and yet she was allegedly free to leave Neverland to pamper herself? She snapped her fingers at the jury. The defense claimed she committed welfare fraud, for which she was later prosecuted. So we shifted the blame. What’s wrong with her? The parents of any kid who passed through Neverland were more convenient to indict. How could you let your child sleep in an adult’s bed? It’s been 15 years, though. Someone should find Janet Arvizo and give her a do-over. That brings me back to how crucial it feels to have Stephanie and Joy speaking in this documentary. (Neither man’s father is interviewed, although, in the case of James’s, we never find out exactly why.) You can’t hear a parent wrestle with this blame question enough, whether it’s being asked in relation to R. Kelly or Michael Jackson, your pastor or your priest: How could they let their child spend that much time with an adult stranger? There’s never a “right” or “good” answer. But faith is usually a factor. And faith entails a suspension of disbelief. The mothers both mention an early limit they set. For Stephanie, it was refusing to let James sleep in Jackson’s room on that trip to Hawaii. And Joy recalls vehemently nixing Jackson’s request to abscond with Wade for a year. But Jackson ultimately wins, anyway. He gets his way, in part, because he could be as manipulative as he could be affectionate, but also because each woman feels, in her way, maternal toward him. He was, both women more or less say, a member of their families. Both families defended him, in the moment, against detractors and accusers. Both boys denied that they were molested — Wade at the trial and to the news media; James to his mother and to a grand jury. So their sons’ falling under his spell — that required some suspension of disbelief. The mothers had fallen, too. We all had. It was so easy to fall.  NOBODY BOUGHT MORE Michael Jackson vinyl LPs than we did of “Thriller.” The euphoria for anything associated with that album was cross-racial and intergenerational. Upon visiting anybody’s house, I’d ask if they had a copy. If the answer was “no,” I’d turn into a 1980s sitcom kid and say something like, “What is your problem?” (I would have been 7, 8 or 9.) If the answer was “yes,” I’d ask to play it, and while it was on, I’d lie on the floor and take long drags on the album’s inside photo: Jackson, in a white suit, lying on his side, one leg bent, looking at us. On the knee of his bent leg is a tiger — a tiger cub. I stared with deep longing. He was so pretty, with his absurd curls and isosceles triangle of a nose and creamy brown face. I’m calling it a photo when, really, it was a centerfold. But what did I want from that picture? What did I want from Jackson? Friendship? A handshake? A souvenir? A hug? Pictures and TV footage of Jackson and other boys were easy enough to come across — him and Emmanuel Lewis, him and Alfonso Ribeiro, him and Sean Lennon (none of whom have accused him of any abuse), him and E.T., him and the boy I now know is James Safechuck. There were so many of him and James. Google didn’t make these images simple to find. Magazines did. Teen magazines. I wanted a picture, too. I wanted the warmth and surprise and serious, only-us closeness in some of those images, although James never looks entirely happy in many of them. The seriousness I identified in a lot of the boys’ faces is what adult-me would now call stress. At the time, I wanted my friends to see Michael Jackson whisking me out of airports and into limousines. I didn’t do an imitation of him or anything, and I never begged my mother to take me to see him. She didn’t have money for that. MTV and “Entertainment Tonight” and the stray issue of Right On! would have to do. But what if I did beg and begged because I was really good at being Michael Jackson? Would that have made a difference? Would she have sacrificed our little family to make my 7-year-old’s dream come true? Ideally, a parent is a backstop against innocent fervor; against foolish, zealous choices and blissful ignorance. So I have to believe that my mother would have saved me from the hazards of my desire. That was her job. But that’s what adult Wade and James think their mothers’ job should have been, too. What’s still eating each woman up, toward the end of “Leaving Neverland,” is that neither woman disagrees. It’s entirely possible that we’ve spent the last 26 years preparing for a moment like this — for somebody to lay it all out, graphically, frankly; for somebody to tell us a story, their story. For a long time, the chief teller of any such story was Jackson himself. He would install his sense of persecution into music videos, like the one for “Leave Me Alone,” from 1989, the finale of “Black or White,” from 1991, and “Ghosts,” from 1997, into songs like “Why You Wanna Trip on Me?” (1991), “Scream” (1995) and “They Don’t Care About Us” (1996). Very good songs, mostly about his tribulations as a so-called weirdo (the tabloids named him Wacko Jacko) and, especially, as a black man. He tried, in highly rated television interviews, to let us see him as wounded and vulnerable and, well, normal. In 1993, he let Oprah Winfrey grill him (about the boys, but also about his altered appearance). He would let Martin Bashir do an occasionally pseudo-vérité version of the same, in a roving two-hour, 2003 TV documentary (“Living With Michael Jackson”) that exposes him as being helpless against himself. (There’s a long, astounding passage, for instance, in which Jackson leads a caravan of children on a Neverland excursion, and he seems taxed by such an overwhelming — and overwhelmingly absurd — babysitting assignment. Yet he’s able to bring himself to have one of his park’s homemade snow cones, anyway. It’s like the parody of Jackson’s hapless eccentricity you can see in Harmony Korine’s celebrity-impersonator film, “Mister Lonely,” and in the “Teddy Perkins” episode of FX’s “Atlanta.”) Then, after his arraignment in 2004, Jackson even danced, for appreciative fans, atop a car. Five years later he was dead. The story was that Jackson never molested anybody. And we stuck to it, and it stuck to him. And the question now, of course, is what do we do? It’s the question of our #MeToo times: If we believe the accusers (and I believe Wade and James), what do we do with the art? With Jackson, what can we do? Wade became a successful choreographer who’s made a career out of teaching his version of Jackson’s hydraulic bounces, whips, and stutters to Britney Spears, ‘N Sync, Cirque du Soleil and rooms full of aspiring dancers. “Look Back at It,” the big single from A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie’s No. 1 album from January, is built out of two Jackson hits. Michael Jackson’s music isn’t a meal. It’s more elemental than that. It’s the salt, pepper, olive oil and butter. His music is how you start. And the music made from that — that music is everywhere, too. Where would the cancellation begin? Jackson provided us an early occasion to ask the question about the art without ever realizing it was being asked. We simply lived with it, with the possibility of his guilt, and the many compartments we make to contain everything he was: the conscientious enthusiasm for and the comedy of him, the tragedy he so obviously represents. Perhaps we can live it because it’s not unreasonable to wonder whether he was living with the contradictions himself. There is something about the way Jackson morphed from pretty to disfigured, closer to Joseph Merrick, the medical case study whose “elephant man” bones Jackson swore he never tried to buy. The morphing could have been a result of the pigmentation ailment, vitiligo, that he told Winfrey he suffered from. But what if all of that change he so notoriously underwent, all the damage he seemed to wear on his body, all the creatures his videos turned him into (werewolves, zombies, a panther, a skeleton), what if his outward self became some semiconscious manifestation of a monster that lurked within? "
5c706a113a125f5075c0b17e,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/22/obituaries/fred-foster-dead.html,"NASHVILLE — Fred Foster, the record producer and song publisher who championed the emerging careers of Roy Orbison, Kris Kristofferson and Dolly Parton, died here on Feb. 20. He was 87. His publicist, Martha Moore, said the cause was complications of a stroke. Mr. Foster’s most enduring early success came as the producer of Roy Orbison’s No. 1 singles “Running Scared” and “Oh, Pretty Woman” in the early 1960s. Along with the likes of “Crying” and “Only the Lonely (Know How I Feel),” all of Mr. Orbison’s hits from this period were issued by Monument Records, the label Mr. Foster established in Washington in 1958 (it took its name from the Washington Monument) and moved to Nashville two years later. Before Mr. Foster became involved with his career, Mr. Orbison had released only two minor singles on Sun Records, neither one a big hit. Mr. Foster also provided a boost to the fortunes of the 19-year-old Ms. Parton, whom he signed to Monument in 1965. She recorded her first two Top 40 country hits, “Dumb Blonde” and “Something Fishy,” for the label before going on to become a star on “The Porter Wagoner Show” on television and with RCA Records. “You saw things in me that nobody else did,” Ms. Parton said, referring to Mr. Foster’s willingness to take a chance on her, at the 2016 ceremony at which he was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. “Sometimes you just know — sometimes,” Mr. Foster explained, alluding to his instincts about Ms. Parton in a comment published by the Hall of Fame. “And that makes up for all the times you had to guess.” Maybe even more prescient than his patronage of Mr. Orbison and Ms. Parton was Mr. Foster’s signing of Kris Kristofferson to a songwriting contract with Combine Music, his fledgling publishing company, and later — despite Mr. Kristofferson’s commercially questionable singing voice — to Monument as a recording artist. Mr. Kristofferson’s 1973 single “Why Me” was his only recording for the label to reach the pop Top 40, but “Me and Bobby McGee,” on which he and Mr. Foster share the writing credit, became a posthumous No.1 pop hit for Janis Joplin in 1971. Combine also published Mr. Kristofferson’s “Sunday Morning Coming Down” and “Help Me Make It Through the Night,” a pair of mystical, existential ballads that became enduring crossover hits, “Sunday Morning” for Johnny Cash and “Help Me” for Sammi Smith. They were subsequently recorded by scores of others. Tony Joe White’s compositions “Polk Salad Annie,” a Top 10 hit for him, and “Rainy Night in Georgia,” a Top 10 hit for the soul singer Brook Benton, were also Combine titles, as was the Elvis Presley hit “Burning Love,” written by Dennis Linde. Fred Luther Foster, the youngest of eight children, was born on July 26, 1931, on a farm in Rutherford County, N.C. His father, Vance Hampton Foster, raised cotton and sorghum and played the harmonica. His mother, Clara Marcella (Weaste) Foster, was a homemaker. Enthralled by music at a young age, Mr. Foster moved to Washington when he was 18 to pursue a career in the record business. He worked in various capacities there, including as the supervisor of the country singer Jimmy Dean’s first recording session, which yielded the Top 10 country single “Bumming Around.” Mr. Foster worked as a talent scout for Mercury Records. He later recalled that he had urged his superiors there to bid aggressively for the talents of Elvis Presley, then largely unknown. But his effort was to no avail: Presley signed a contract with RCA instead. In 1963, Mr. Foster established Sound Stage 7, an R&B-oriented subsidiary of Monument. The soul singer Joe Simon’s 1969 recording of “The Chokin’ Kind” for the label became a million-selling pop and R&B hit. Monument also released several influential instrumental recordings in the 1960s, including the saxophonist Boots Randolph’s “Yakety Sax,” a Top 40 pop hit in 1963. Another recorded version of the song served as the opening theme for the long-running British comedy series “The Benny Hill Show.” Mr. Foster is survived by his son, Vance; his daughters, Micki Koenig, Leah Alderman, Brit Rothstein and Kristen Foster; and four grandchildren. Mr. Foster sold Monument and Combine in the 1980s but continued to work as a producer, most notably on “Last of the Breed,” a 2007 album that teamed Willie Nelson, Merle Haggard and Ray Price. The project earned Mr. Price and Mr. Nelson a Grammy Award for best country collaboration with vocals for their performance of the Hank Williams staple “Lost Highway.” In 2016, the Recording Academy presented Mr. Foster with a Trustees Award for lifetime achievement. “I tried to do something time would not be critical of,” Mr. Foster said that year in an interview with The Tennessean, reflecting on his contributions to the music industry. “It’s like Orbison said to me one time, ‘What’s the most important thing we’re going to do?’ I said, ‘We’re going to eliminate every gimmick you come up with. They don’t endure.’ ” "
5c80318349f0eacbf105bb20,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/06/arts/music/review-bryce-dessner-robert-mapplethorpe-triptych.html,"LOS ANGELES — Robert Mapplethorpe’s photographs are pristine and painful, witty and wicked, forbidding and seductive. The mild-mannered Bryce Dessner is not the first composer I would have thought of to set them to music. Mr. Dessner — whose hourlong meditation on Mapplethorpe, “Triptych (Eyes of One on Another),” had its premiere at Walt Disney Concert Hall here on Tuesday before touring worldwide — achieved fame as a member of the rock band the National, and has sought a parallel career in the concert hall. Mellow and unobtrusive, with a heavy debt to Minimalism and its rock-infused progeny, his music is at its best when he’s his own softly suggestive electric guitar soloist. And on a small scale — a bright, vivid set of “Murder Ballades” (2013); the gentle percussion solo “Tromp Miniature” (2014) — his work can be charming. Longer pieces, though conscientiously constructed, tend to go prettily nowhere. (The New York Philharmonic will play “Wires” in November.) Mr. Dessner was a teenager in Cincinnati in 1990 when a Mapplethorpe exhibition that traveled there, “The Perfect Moment,” became caught up in a classic culture-war conflagration over censorship and government support for the arts. The city’s Contemporary Arts Center and its director faced obscenity charges; they were acquitted in a trial viewed as a victory for free speech. “The Perfect Moment” drew from three Mapplethorpe portfolios: “X” (images of gay S&M activity), “Y” (flower studies) and “Z” (nude portraits of black men). This tripartite structure in turn suggested a form for “Triptych,” which very loosely moves from a mythologizing overture (“it was said he had face of a god / yet some saw a demon with rope shoes”) to reflections on the obscenity trial and issues of race in his work. The elliptical libretto, by Korde Arrington Tuttle, draws on texts by the poet Essex Hemphill, who argued that Mapplethorpe continued a long tradition of objectifying black bodies, and by Patti Smith, whose book “Just Kids” is a memoir of her friendship with the artist. The language is stylized and extravagantly poetic, matching the photographs’ explicit sexual content while meeting their cool elegance with punk Romanticism (“worship the almighty / target practice / tells me to flex / tighten my torso”). These texts, while occasionally overwrought, do evoke the brew of objectification, glorification, aggression, submission, risk and reward in Mapplethorpe’s photographs, particularly those of black men. The words are not always easy on the artist; they draw an uncomfortable parallel between different meanings of “shooting” someone, and, in one section constructed as a dialogue, suggest Mapplethorpe exploited his models. It’s heady, ambitious stuff. But Mr. Dessner, perhaps treading cautiously as a white composer in a potential racial minefield, keeps the music — performed by 10 vocalists and 10 instrumentalists — resolutely lukewarm. He mines the vocal ensemble Roomful of Teeth for close harmonies, undergirding their singing with a wan wash of strings, the barest touch of propulsion. (The Los Angeles Philharmonic’s New Music Group was conducted by Sara Jobin.) The tenor Isaiah Robinson, a featured soloist, made soulful wails; his voice was richer, the emotion in it both plainer and more complex, than that of mezzo-soprano Alicia Hall Moran, his female counterpart. There was little sense of this blandly brooding, affectlessly luminous score shifting as the libretto did, leaving the words — only a handful of which were audible, with murky amplification partly to blame — adrift. The music can’t match the words’ nuanced portrayal of Mapplethorpe’s vision and personality, reducing the work’s impact to dreary sanctification. (I could have done without the facile queer utopianism of the finale: “Every time we kiss / we confirm the new world coming.”) A slideshow of Mapplethorpe’s images was projected on a screen above the ensemble during the performance, and a young black actor moved slowly around the stage. These are perhaps suggestions of the fuller production of “Triptych” (directed by Kaneza Schaal, who replaced the originally announced Daniel Fish) that will have its premiere on March 15 in Ann Arbor, Mich., and travel to the Brooklyn Academy of Music in June. A fleshed-out production may well enliven the piece. But if the music isn’t propelling the drama, visuals will ultimately always be window dressing. I know critics aren’t supposed to review performances that existed only in our imaginations. But on the drive home from Disney Hall, my mind kept wandering to what the composer Georg Friedrich Haas might have done with this material. Known for plunging his players and audiences alike into long, disconcerting stretches of total darkness, Mr. Haas is gifted at sonic evocations of control, oppression and extremity; his work shares the classicism of Mapplethorpe’s work, and its brutality. These indelible photographs deserve better music than Mr. Dessner’s thin, earnest worship. "
5c6865143a125f5075c0a159,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/16/opinion/sunday/michael-jackson-leaving-neverland.html,"When Dan Reed ordered up a score for his documentary, he asked the composer to evoke the image of a shimmering sprite leading two boys deeper and deeper into an enchanted forest. The boys don’t notice that the trees grow menacing. And suddenly, the sprite turns into a monster. As “Leaving Neverland” shows, Michael Jackson spent his life shape-shifting from best pal, father figure and beneficent idol into cruel, manipulative rapist. It was apparent for decades that Jackson’s cotton-candy lair was sulfurous. But as with other monsters — Harvey Weinstein, Bill Cosby, R. Kelly, Woody Allen, Jeffrey Epstein and Bryan Singer — many turned a blind eye. Celebrity supersedes criminality. How can you see clearly when you’re looking into the sun? How can an icon be a con? It was easier to ignore a landscape designed as a spider web for child sexual abuse than to give up the soundtrack of our lives, the catchy songs that coursed through memories of weddings, bar mitzvahs and other good times. “With Michael Jackson, you can see how grotesquely his fame, and our worship of fame, distorts and excuses and enables evil — to the point mothers fail to protect their children and literally throw them in harm’s way,” says Maureen Orth, who did groundbreaking stories in the ’90s for Vanity Fair about both Jackson and Allen. Indeed, the most harrowing part of the new documentary about the shredded lives of two of Jackson’s victims is the complicity of their mothers. Jackson spent as much time grooming the mothers as the sons, to the point where the women saw nothing wrong in letting their children share a bed with a grown man. (The documentary, which left the audience stunned at Sundance last month, premieres on HBO next month.) Reed is a Brit who made several documentaries about terrorism. He says he became practiced at leading victims gently back to their traumas, so they could use their minds as cameras to bring key moments to life, letting their faces and voices tell the stories. And that is how the tragedies of James Safechuck and Wade Robson unfold, through the pain in their eyes and the confusion in their voices and the moments where they tear up or swallow hard. Safechuck, who works as a computer programmer, was raised in Simi Valley. He met Jackson when he was a 9-year-old child actor in 1987, starring with the singer in a Pepsi commercial. Jackson promised to make the boy the next Spielberg. Robson, a dance teacher who did choreography for Britney Spears and ’N Sync, grew up on the other side of the world in Brisbane. He spent all his time dressing and dancing like Jackson. He won a dance contest in 1987 and got to meet Jackson, who was on tour in Australia, and dance onstage. Then, he was ensnared in the warped fantasy, a 7-year-old being initiated into sex at Neverland by the 31-year-old Jackson. The mothers, Stephanie Safechuck and Joy Robson, knew that Jackson was ensorcelling their sons, even as he lured the mothers out of the frame with luxurious enticements. But they were stage mothers and fans, so they chose to believe Michael was a kind, lonely little boy at heart, not a heartless pedophile, and they did not dig deeper when their sons said nothing bad was going on. “He flies you first class, you have a limo waiting for you at the airport, amazing, you know, it’s a life of the rich and famous,” Mrs. Safechuck gushes in the film, adding: “I got to meet Sean Connery. That was big for me. It was like, ‘Oh my God, Sean Connery!’” She also loved Neverland: “He had a beautiful wine cellar, really good wines, champagne, that was just something I enjoyed — it was a fairy tale every night.” After all, as she says, he was a genius and they were “just nobodies.” Jackson bought them a house after James testified on the singer’s behalf in a trial involving another boy. It somehow made sense to James’s mother when she was told that she couldn’t be near the hotel rooms her son and Michael shared in Europe because the nicer suites she would prefer were farther away. As Wade Robson puts it, “What you’d think would be standard kind of instincts and judgment seemed to go out the window.” His mother left Australia and his father and moved to L.A. with Wade and her daughter to be closer to Michael; the father later committed suicide. After Wade finally told a therapist and his wife and family what had happened, he was alienated from his mother for a time. Like James, Wade — who lied in court twice to protect the man he loved — had symptoms of trauma that intensified with the birth of his son. James’s hands shake as he shows a diamond ring that Jackson gave him for a private mock wedding. Wade had a nervous breakdown and stopped dancing for a time. “I had one job” and messed it up, Mrs. Safechuck says. “My son had to suffer for me to have this life.” Even with this shocking documentary, the Michael Jackson estate is still demonizing the victims and planning to bring a musical about Jackson’s life to Broadway in 2020. Reed says he is “agnostic” about it: “Am I going to campaign to have Michael’s name removed from classrooms and his statues removed from shopping malls? No. Is this the right time to celebrate Michael as a legitimate good person you might want to emulate? Possibly not.” And that is what’s known as British understatement. "
5c9125d049f0eacbf105de3e,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/19/arts/music/met-opera-wagner-ring-walkure-lepage.html,"We tend to think about Wagner’s “Ring” as an epic saga of bitter rivalries, fearless heroes and flying horses. But at the core of “Die Walküre,” the second of the four “Ring” operas, is something far more intimate: one of the most profound depictions of a father-daughter relationship in all the arts. The complex feelings between the brooding god Wotan and his favorite daughter, the feisty Valkyrie warrior Brünnhilde, come to a head during an intimate scene in Act II, when, in a rare moment of vulnerability, Wotan confesses what a mess he’s made of things. [Read about the triumph of Christine Goerke, the Met’s Brünnhilde.] The director Robert Lepage bungles this poignant scene in his production for the Metropolitan Opera, which returns on Monday. His staging makes me realize what I still miss about Otto Schenk’s production, which the Met retired 10 years ago. Mr. Schenk’s traditional approach, which presents the “Ring” as a storybook tale of gods, giants and dwarfs, had its limitations. But he was keenly sensitive to the relationships between Wagner’s characters, and his staging of this confessional moment is a high point. Long known as Wotan’s Narrative, this scene can seem like a dead spot: nearly 20 minutes of talk, talk, talk. In fact, it’s the heart of the entire cycle. As Wotan tells Brünnhilde the whole sorry story of how he came to this crisis point, the music unfolds slowly, quietly, almost statically. Many of Wotan’s halting vocal lines should sound like he’s almost muttering. In the Schenk “Walküre” — available on DVD and the Met Opera On Demand, conducted by James Levine and starring James Morris as Wotan and Hildegard Behrens as Brünnhilde — Wotan seems at first to be speaking to himself. Brünnhilde, who has never seen her father like this, warily approaches to ask what’s wrong. This anguished Wotan hesitates. If he voices his thoughts out loud, he says, will he lose grip on his own will? Brünnhilde tenderly replies that when he talks to her, he is “speaking to his will.” So he opens up, admitting to his greed for power; to violating the treaties he had pledged to uphold; to confiscating a magic ring from the Nibelung dwarf Alberich. Mr. Schenk’s staging could not be simpler: Wotan just sits on a rock, Brünnhilde next to him, sometimes resting her head on his knee, looking at her father with unblinking attentiveness, seemingly gripped by every word. It’s clear from the staging that what’s really transfixing Brünnhilde — more than the tangled story Wotan tells — is the fact that her father is opening up at all. Suddenly, this goddess seems like any devoted daughter of a powerful, emotionally walled-off father, finally confessing everything. And to her! The narrative comes to a crucial turn when Wotan explains how his hunger for knowledge drove him to follow the earth goddess Erda to her realm — where, in time, he says, the world’s “wisest woman” gave birth “to you, Brünnhilde.” In Mr. Schenk’s staging, Mr. Morris’s Wotan melts with fatherly affection and cradles her face in his hands, as Behrens’s Brünnhilde, with radiant eyes and a wistful smile, basks in her father’s love. How does Mr. Lepage present this scene? It starts off promisingly. In the version also available on video, and also conducted by Mr. Levine, a visibly rattled Wotan (Bryn Terfel) frets that he is the least free of all men. Brünnhilde (Deborah Voigt) looks both concerned and scared. But as the narrative begins, this Wotan walks up the raked planks of the production’s massive set and assumes a lordly stance, looking past Brünnhilde, who stands meekly below. So father and daughter are kept apart during what is supposed to be their moment of closest bonding. Suddenly, a circle of light rises from the ground in front of Brünnhilde. The image morphs into a huge eye. Brünnhilde, now sitting on the ground, begins to watch what is, in effect, a greatest-hits animated video projection of the story Wotan relates. When he talks of the giants who built the castle Valhalla, we see circles of color to suggest its rainbow bridge. When he speaks of Erda, a ghostly image of her comes into view. And when Wotan says that Erda conceived a child, this Brünnhilde is shown what looks like a sonogram image of her embryonic self. Rather than basking in her father’s love, Ms. Voigt’s Brünnhilde, looking nervous and confused, turns her face away from him. The overly obvious animated images are bad enough. What’s worse is that, by fixating with such preposterous exactitude on the details of Wotan’s story, Mr. Lepage distracts us from caring about what Wagner is really depicting: a proud but failing father who, with no one else he can trust, confides in his daughter. With Mr. Schenk’s staging, a newcomer to “Die Walküre” watching this father-daughter moment from a balcony seat at the Met may well have found it ponderous: two singers, sitting on a rock, during a long stretch of very slow music. But consummate artists like Behrens and Mr. Morris, working with a skilled director, trusted, rightly, that this restraint and subtlety would lend emotional richness and honesty to the scene. And emotional richness is just what Mr. Lepage’s production too often lacks. "
5c38beca3a125f5075c03f1c,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/11/arts/estonia-russia-narva.html,"NARVA, Estonia — The conversion of factories into cultural venues rarely raises eyebrows these days, but the Kreenholm complex here is not just any relic of industry. Once the world’s largest cotton mill and a poster child of Soviet might, it stands on an island in the river that now makes up the European Union’s eastern border. Russia is just a stone’s throw away, leaving Narva — where nearly 90 percent of the population is ethnic Russian — caught between two worlds. Kreenholm’s imposing atmosphere appealed to Jarmo Reha, 27, a theater director from Tallinn, the Estonian capital. He recently commandeered the site for his production “Oomen,” which saluted the ghosts of industry with actors hammering on iron while the Narva Boy’s Choir sang the socialist anthem “The Internationale.” The performance was well received by visiting critics, but some condemned the use of Kreenholm as “blasphemy,” Mr. Reha said in an interview. The factory’s former workers complained that events were being imported from the capital, yet no one was reaching out to the local population. Thousands in the city lost their jobs after the mill was privatized, and it closed for good in 2010. “It’s an open wound,” Mr. Reha said. It’s the kind of tension that Narva is becoming accustomed to as it becomes the latest front in a simmering culture war in the former Soviet bloc. Estonia is lavishing money and attention on Narva to attract investment to the city, fearing that its neglected Russian minority is prone to Kremlin influence. The arts are central to the strategy. Kreenholm hosted the inaugural edition of Station Narva, an alternative music festival, this fall. A cultural program funded by the Ministry of Culture has also been established there, bringing in artists and exhibitions. Vaba Lava Narva, a theater in a former military factory, opened in December. A campaign is underway to make Narva one of the European Union’s capitals of culture in 2024. Helen Sildna, who is leading the campaign, said that there was a “soft power” dimension to the cultural initiatives. “From a defense perspective, building a happy, prosperous community in our border area is crucial,” she said. “But from a human perspective, it’s the decent thing to do anyway.” After years as a Soviet satellite, Estonia, a nation of just 1.3 million people, is anxious to safeguard its language and identity — and that has meant a residual suspicion of its Russian-speaking minority. Narva’s street signs are in Estonian, a language that is related to Finnish and uses a Latin script; many locals, especially older people, don’t speak it. They get their news and entertainment mostly from Kremlin-backed television channels. The radio airwaves are awash with mainstream Russian pop. Until recently, Narva was stigmatized as a hotbed of crime and opioid addiction, closer not only in distance but also in mentality to Russia. The rest of Estonia stayed away. But Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 was “like a bell ringing that woke people in Estonia up,” said Jaanus Mikk, the chief executive of Narva Gate, a property developer renovating Kreenholm. “Politicians started to think about Narva, and it helped the city a lot — more funds and projects came in.” Donbass, Ukraine, is another region with a large ethnic Russian population that is suffering from the collapse of industry. After Crimea’s annexation, pro-Russia demonstrations in Donbass escalated into armed conflict between separatists and the Ukrainian government. Parallels between Donbass and Estonia’s northeast have many in the Baltics worried. Sergei Stepanov, a journalist at ETV Plus, a Russian-language Estonian channel, said that people in Narva mainly watched networks broadcast from across the border that carry what he described as fake news. “People in Narva are influenced by these channels’ constant misinformation about Ukraine,” he said. The Estonian president, Kersti Kaljulaid, said in an interview in November that the people of Narva “watch Russian TV channels and we all know there is no free media in Russia — the news is basically propaganda.” But, she added, “we do not respond by restricting their access or producing anti-propaganda, because the trouble with anti-propaganda is it’s still propaganda.” Instead, funding from Estonia’s government is flowing to events like Station Narva, which brought around 3,000 people to Kreenholm and its surroundings. The headliner was the British post-punk band Echo and the Bunnymen, and the lineup also featured popular acts from Estonia and Russia, including Mart Avi, a rising star of a new “weird wave” of innovative Estonian pop music, and Shortparis, a flamboyant dark electro band from St. Petersburg. Roman Boiko, who runs Art Club Ro-Ro, a bar and music venue in Narva, said that while some welcomed the government’s investment in culture, “people here are still suspicious.” Ro-Ro, a D.I.Y. setup of surrealist artwork and anything-goes carpentry, is the only place in the city to hear more alternative music year-round. “All the attention Narva is getting, and that more people are coming here, feels very good,” Mr. Boiko said. “It’s really important for people here to start believing that there is an interest in them, and even in solutions to their problems.” The funding and support for the arts in Narva also benefit a new generation of Estonian artists who have a more open attitude to collaborating with Russians. The singer Mart Avi, a 27-year-old praised for his startling baritone voice and Bowie-esque stage presence, was among the performers at Station Narva. He said in a recent interview in Tallinn that the festival “was a big thing. It was rather unusual for something like that to happen there.” He said he believed that artists should work together to cut through Estonia’s identity divides. “It’s super easy for me to find a common language with Russians,” he said. “It’s not about territory. If you can find a common area of interest, then all is well.” Mr. Avi said that he did not have the “chip on the shoulder” about Russia that many Estonians who lived through Soviet times have. “I’m saved by the fact that I’m the first generation to be born in free Estonia.” Mr. Reha, the theater director who is also of that generation, said Estonia needed “empathy,” not “tribalism.” “When I was in Narva, I stopped calling the locals Russians. I started calling them ‘our Russians,’ ” he said. “Why should we leave them cut off? They are a part of us.” "
5c7df49e49f0eacbf105b573,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/04/arts/television/oprah-michael-jackson.html,"On a recent afternoon, an audience composed mostly of survivors of sexual abuse sat in the Times Center auditorium in Manhattan for a preview screening of Dan Reed’s “Leaving Neverland,” to be followed by a Q. and A. led by Oprah Winfrey. The documentary, which aired on HBO in two parts on Sunday and Monday, profiles Wade Robson and James Safechuck, two men who say Michael Jackson sexually abused them when they were children. The final hour of the film pivots from the graphic, triggering details of molestation that Robson and Safechuck say occurred for several years to the emotional fallout in their adulthood. At the screening, audience members could be heard sniffling, sighing and crying during moments when Robson and Safechuck spoke of their struggles to come forward to their families. [Michael Jackson’s tenacious fans. | “Leaving Neverland” Part 2 recap.] There were also emphatic cheers and bursts of applause on several occasions, as when Safechuck’s mother, Stephanie, recalls dancing on the day Jackson died and exclaiming, “Oh, thank God he can’t hurt any more children.” Then, at the conclusion of the viewing, came nearly 90 minutes of processing with Winfrey. The lights came up, the cameras turned on and Winfrey, Safechuck, Robson and Reed ascended the stage to record “Oprah Winfrey Presents: After Neverland.” The hourlong special, which aired Monday evening on both HBO and OWN immediately following the conclusion of “Leaving Neverland,” was a return to the audience-involved, talk-show therapy format that she perfected over 25 seasons of “The Oprah Winfrey Show.” Winfrey solicited responses from some of the abuse survivors seated before her, and called upon Howard R. Fradkin, a psychological trauma consultant specializing in male sexual abuse, to speak about patterns of grooming and manipulation. But at the center of those teaching moments were Robson and Safechuck. At first, Winfrey asked them to elaborate on how they came to recognize themselves as victims and seek help, and invited them to unpack the ways in which they say Jackson compelled them into years of silence. Talk eventually turned to suspicions of their motives, and the assertions by superfans and the Jackson family that Robson and Safechuck are only coming forward for financial gain. Reed emphatically denied that either of the men or their families received compensation for the film. Robson said that a lawsuit he filed against the Jackson estate in 2013 was about doing “something good with this bad,” not about remuneration. He saw the legal system as a “platform” to tell his story in a scenario where the estate would “have to listen” and “have to sit there.” “Michael trained me and forced me to tell the lie for so many years, and particularly on the stand,” he continued. “And those were really traumatizing experiences for me that had a huge impact on the rest of my life. So the feeling was, I want an opportunity to reprocess that experience. I want to get on the stand again, because now I’m able to tell the truth.” (Robson’s suit was thrown out by a judge because too much time had passed. Safechuck sued the following year and was also unsuccessful. Both cases are under appeal.) The Jackson family has denied all of the allegations and publicly condemned the film, and the estate is suing HBO for $100 million. Winfrey seemed fully aware of the optics of her interview: “All the anger — you guys are going to get it. You know that, right?” She continued, “You’re going to get it. I’m going to get it. We’re all going to get it.” At various points during the taping, Winfrey mentioned, in passing, her own experience as a survivor of child abuse. Curiously, there was no mention of her personal connection to Jackson — in particular, the famous 1993 live interview with him at Neverland Ranch, which took place just months before the first public accusations against him were made. In that interview, she was an unabashed fan (“I think ‘King of Pop’ is actually too limiting,” she told him, referring to his moniker), but based on her conversation with Reed, Robson and Safechuck, it’s clear her perception of Jackson has shifted. Winfrey explained at the beginning of the taping that she reached out to Reed after watching the documentary, and told him that he had done “in four hours what I tried to do in 217 episodes” dedicated to educating her audience about sexual abuse. As the conversation wound down, the subject turned to absolution. When the accusers were asked if they had forgiven Jackson, Safechuck admitted that he felt guilt just the weekend before for speaking out. “Like I let him down,” he said. “Like — it’s still there. The shadow’s still there.” Winfrey concluded the show with words of inspiration for survivors and the importance of education around abuse, and the audience in the theater gave a standing ovation that emanated a collective catharsis. Robson had one last thing to say, however — a direct address to the audience in the theater. “As so many of you know, being a survivor is so isolating,” he said. “At least it is for a really long time. So to be in this space with you guys, the brothers and sisters in trauma and in triumph — that we’re standing, you know, and we’re here, I’m just so grateful.” "

Your album “Pacific Daydream” is nominated for a Grammy this year; you just released the “Teal Album,” and the “Black Album” is coming out in March. Most important, your cover of Toto’s “Africa” hit more than 25 million streams on Spotify. Well, that started with a 14-year-old girl in Ohio who spammed us every day requesting us to cover Toto’s “Africa.” We let it play out for a few months and decided to release Toto’s “Rosanna.” Then, a week later, we put out “Africa.” Do you get tired of playing, say, your old hit “Buddy Holly” all the time? We’ve played well over a thousand shows, and it’s all about feeling the audience’s excitement, and it’s just so addictive. Standing up there and playing a lick or singing a hook is just like putting a question out into the universe: “Am I worth something? Am I good? Am I cool?” And you just want to hear this roar of affirmation: “Yes, Rivers, you rock.” It’s such an intense craving for me that I’ll do whatever it takes to get it, even if it means playing “Buddy Holly” for the 2,000th time. You’ve been a rock star for decades now. Do you think you’ll always want to keep answering that question? Yeah, until I kick the addiction. It’s like any drug. You can’t just say, “Well, you’ve been shooting heroin for 25 years by now, you think you’d just feel good all the time,” right? Do you think that’s a healthful way to live? I have some detachment from it now, and I can use that addictive dynamic to get the best work out of me without being too miserable all the time. Number one by limiting my exposure to the online world. That’s just more stuff to get addicted to, and it can give you a thrill, but it can make you feel pretty terrible about yourself. I’ve set my computer so I can’t get on to social media except for a few hours on Fridays. But you were just on Twitter. I was? What does it say? It says, “My voice is dead tonight, you have any vocal health tips for me?” Oh, I just load it all into a program which tweets three times a day. So I don’t know when that was composed, but not recently. Though my voice is kind of wrecked today. Even with the limits, you do have a very clear relationship to social media. You’re very present on Snapchat. Yeah, that’s the one I do every day. As for the rest of my social media, it’s 100 percent sincere and reflecting how I’m feeling at the time, but probably only 20 percent of it is literally from me. The rest is cut and paste. Sometimes your tweets feel as if they might be curated by artificial intelligence. My new passion is computer programming. I’ve been writing a program to generate our set lists for our tour with the Pixies. I get almost sexually aroused looking at spreadsheets. You signed up for Tinder for purely platonic reasons. How did that go? I was working with this producer, Jake Sinclair. He’s a young guy. He was on Tinder, and he was telling me all about it, and I just started writing songs from his perspective. I met somebody in Indianapolis — we walked around the whole city. But I started talking to this one woman on the phone, and I said: “Look, I’ve gotta be upfront with you. I’m actually just a songwriter looking for inspiration,” and I think she was really disappointed. It made me feel like this is not the best experiment to continue. “Saturday Night Live” aired a sketch featuring Matt Damon and Leslie Jones as insanely devoted Weezer fans. What did you think of it? I didn’t watch it. I like to exist in my own happy little world and not be too close to what people are saying about the band. You wrote a tweet about it. You said you were crying while watching it, in all caps. I’m sure that would be my reaction if I did see it. "

5c6c1e1b3a125f5075c0a6a2,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/19/realestate/she-loves-her-stuff-he-has-little-and-cares-less.html,"The actor Will Chase and the singer and composer Ingrid Michaelson were introduced years ago at a red-carpet charity event.  “I don’t remember meeting him,” said Ms. Michaelson, 39, all cheery candor. “I remember meeting her,” said Mr. Chase, 48, who plays an egotistic trouper/impresario (nothing like his own gallant self, of course) in the Broadway revival of “Kiss Me Kate,” now in previews, and who set hearts aflutter as the country-singing superstar Luke Wheeler on the series “Nashville.” His TV credits also include “Smash,” “Sharp Objects” and “Stranger Things.” It’s safe to say that the story of their courtship wouldn’t spark a bidding war for the film rights.  “We went on a date,” said Ms. Michaelson, who has released eight studio albums and made her film-acting debut in the 2017 comedy “Humor Me.” “We liked each other, and that was that. He started out as a fan of my music, and I was a fan, too, because I loved ‘Nashville.’ We came to each other with mutual respect.” She continued: “Not to be morose, but my mother passed away, I got a divorce and my life kind of fell apart. And then I began seeing Will, and right off the bat it was good.” Living together has been similarly fine. “Wunderbar,” you might say, to quote one of Mr. Chase’s numbers from “Kiss Me Kate.”  Soon after getting together in 2015, the couple moved into a three-floor spread in a rental building in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn. And perhaps as a nod to Ms. Michaelson’s obsession with the Yuletide season — don’t get her going on her musical Christmas clock, a gift from Hallmark — they quickly planted a dozen evergreens on one of the apartment’s two terraces. Ms. Michaelson’s brother, Charlie, and his wife and toddler daughter are right upstairs, in the building’s only other unit. “Ingrid and her brother are very tight, and we get to see them every day, which is a plus of being here,” Mr. Chase said. “And we’re the insta-babysitters.” Keeping to the all-in-the-family theme, one of Mr. Chase’s daughters from his first marriage has lately been in residence as well, on a gap year before starting college. Occupations: He’s an actor; she’s a pop composer and singer who did a stint on Broadway as a replacement in “Natasha, Pierre & the Great Comet of 1812.” Getting away from it all: “I know a lot of theater people say this, but I like living tucked away from the theater district,” Mr. Chase said. “It’s very familial in Brooklyn. I like to be here and veg.” Ms. Michaelson has taken the lead in outfitting the apartment. This is partly because she is hip, Mr. Chase said, and knows that a certain object “will look great in the place by the thing, which I just can’t visualize.”  And it is partly because she had many pieces to contribute, several from the Victorian house in Nyack, N.Y., that she owned with her former husband: bedside lamps, side tables, chests, a mirror and a dining table that she adored but worried might be too big for the space.  “We just measured it,” she said. “It’s 82 inches and I’m like, ‘Should we get a smaller table?’ But I do love it.” But really, it comes down to this: Ms. Michaelson has her stuff, and she loves her stuff. Mr. Chase is not a material guy. He accumulates little and cares less, although he is very tender on the subject of the vinyl classical records he inherited from Ms. Michaelson’s father. “I’m like, ‘Don’t you want to keep that chair or whatever from your family?’ And he’s like, ‘Not really.’ Will’s very easygoing. I admire that he doesn’t get sentimental about too many objects,” Ms. Michaelson said. “I, on the other hand, hold on to things,” she added, pointing to the chest from her family’s Staten Island house that held her childhood arts and crafts supplies, and to two spindle-backed antique chairs, the sole survivors of a set that belonged to her grandmother. When Ms. Michaelson does let something go, she tries very hard to avoid regret. This is not always possible. It was absolutely not possible in the case of the antique egg incubator she bought at the Brooklyn shop Sterling Place.  “It was my first big furniture purchase, and it cost $500,” she said. “I used it as a side table, but it was really too big for a side table and too small for anything else. So I ended up selling it.” She added: “I still think about it.” “Note to self: Christmas present,” her boyfriend said. Whatever his indifference to how his space is filled, Mr. Chase would prefer that the space be big. Never mind that more often than not he and Ms. Michaelson can be found nestled on the very puffy sectional in a corner of the living room watching “Game of Thrones.”  He likes room to roam. He’s got it. The living room — heavy on the wood and earth tones, and heavily dependent on Restoration Hardware and West Elm — is cozy and welcoming, but betrays nothing about the professional lives of the inhabitants. All is revealed in the studio/office where, surrounded by family photos and theater posters and caricatures, Mr. Chase memorizes his lines and Ms. Michaelson writes. (She is working on the score for a musical adaptation of “The Notebook.”) “It’s kind of our accomplishments in here, mixed with bizarre things,” she said.  Bizarre: the lion’s head she bought at a rest stop while on tour. Bizarre (but sweet): the Grimace sponge she bought for Mr. Chase on eBay.  The accomplishments include Mr. Chase’s Tony Award nomination certificate (for his performance in the 2012 revival of “The Mystery of Edwin Drood”) and Ms. Michaelson’s two platinum singles (for 2007’s “The Way I Am” and 2014’s “Girls Chase Boys”). “But it’s not ‘Look at us.’ It’s not, like, showcasing us,” Mr. Chase insisted. “And then we joke, ‘It’s not like we have that many awards.’” For weekly email updates on residential real estate news, sign up here.

5c40e9303a125f5075c04fcd,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/fashion/rihanna-fashion-brand-lvmh.html,"Is Rihanna the Coco Chanel of the 21st century? Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton LVMH, the parent company of Dior, Givenchy and Fendi, apparently thinks so. It is in the midst of a deal to back her in a fashion brand, making her the first female designer of color at the largest luxury conglomerate in the world. The news, confirmed by sources within the group who were not authorized to speak for the company, was first reported by WWD. Neither LVMH nor Rihanna would comment, though the singer has recently been photographed on the street wearing a “mystery” pair of oversize Fenty-branded square sunglasses hinting at what may be to come. While the details of the agreement remain unclear, it is a turning point in both fashion and fame. The combination of Fenty and LVMH will be the clearest expression yet of how celebrity, social media and influencers have redefined the power balance between culture and consumption, changing the way brands of all kinds relate to their audience.  It is not insignificant that despite the number of well-known and respected designers currently unemployed in the fashion world, including Alber Elbaz, Stefano Pilati and Peter Copping, the dominant luxury group decided to put its money where a pop star was. Robyn Rihanna Fenty, one of the defining musical artists of the millennium and a multi-hyphenate talent, has no formal fashion training. What she does have is a clear vision for her own image, 14 No. 1 singles on the Billboard 100 chart and more than 50 Top 40 hits, 67 million Instagram followers, and an ability to disrupt the status quo. Now that the elite fashion world is in disarray, splintered by the rise of the street, direct communication and a growing awareness of its lack of diversity, there is little wonder that LVMH would see in Rihanna a potential way forward. The company first became aware of the power of her base when it signed her to Kendo, its beauty subsidiary, in 2017. (Kendo produces cosmetics for Sephora, also owned by LVMH, as well as other outlets.)  The runaway success of Fenty Beauty, premised on addressing a diverse array of skin tones — and which itself already has 6.3 million Instagram followers — astonished the group. The line changed what consumers demanded from their makeup and was named one of Time magazine’s 25 Best Inventions of 2017.  Discussions began internally at LVMH with Bernard Arnault, the chief executive, about what could happen next. Though the group had had various conversations over the years about building a brand from scratch, it had not done so since Christian Lacroix in 1987 because of the cost involved. (Lacroix was sold in 2005.) It preferred to buy already established names. Unlike most new designers, however, Rihanna had a public profile that was as fully formed and global as any heritage brand. She came to the attention of the fashion industry early on, singing at a Gucci fund-raiser at the United Nations in 2008, and quickly understood the power of style to magnify her messages and help her transcend the limits of the music world. In 2011, she began working with the stylist Mel Ottenberg, and an adventurous, self-aware style that encompassed looks by emerging designers as well as runway names like Lanvin and Givenchy began to emerge. In 2014, she was named fashion icon of the year at the Council of Fashion Designers of America awards, where she appeared in a sheer crystal-spangled Adam Selman dress and matching cap, a white fur wrap strategically draped around her body, setting off a so-called naked trend in red carpet dressing. The next year, at the Met Gala, she wore a giant yellow cape from the Chinese designer Guo Pei, and enshrined her skill at making an entrance. Even though Rihanna became the face of Dior’s Secret Garden scent in 2015 (making her its first black brand ambassador), she never aligned herself with a single brand; they served her purposes, rather than the other way around.  The fact that she signed a deal with Puma to be its creative director and start her own ready-to-wear brand in 2014, when the sportswear giant was still owned by Kering, an LVMH rival, and for a time worked with both groups simultaneously (an unprecedented arrangement) reflects the shift in status. Suddenly a celebrity could have the upper hand. Last September, she introduced her lingerie collection, Fenty x Savage, at New York Fashion Week, where it made waves for including a wide range of body types and colors.  Her ambitions for her brand were perhaps matched only by those of Kanye West, who first made forays into Paris back in 2011 and interned for a while at Fendi, and whose Yeezy brand is backed by Adidas. Though Mr. West once declared his desire to design for Hermès and claimed he had been in talks with LVMH that fell through, he has stepped away from the formal catwalk in recent seasons to focus more on street wear and selling directly to consumers.  (It was Virgil Abloh, his former creative director, who ended up going to Paris. He was named men’s wear designer of Louis Vuitton in March 2018.) Other celebrities have made the move into fashion, using the red carpet as a springboard to legitimacy. But what has set them apart, whether it’s Victoria Beckham or Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen at The Row, is that they have done so in part by renouncing their low culture past and humbly pledging their troth to design.  After all, industry wisdom says that to be a “real” designer, individuals must dedicate themselves to the craft. (Otherwise they are just Jessica Simpson.) Also, those designers started — and remain — small and independent. By contrast, Rihanna, who starred in last summer’s “Ocean’s 8,” appears to understand how her various platforms and outlets for expression can complement one another, and shows no interest in abandoning any of them. LVMH has presumably not asked her to. There are still outstanding questions around just what shape her brand will take, where it will be based and how the relationship with LVMH will be structured. Even what it will be named.  But what is certain is that Rihanna’s first catwalk show or extravaganza or concert, or whatever it turns out to be, will be appointment viewing far beyond the often insular fashion world. And she now has the potential to set not only style trends, but also a trend in what managers, agents, executives and kids thinking about their future imagine is possible.  Last May, as a host of the Met Gala celebrating the show “Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination,” the — what to call her? designer? creative phenomenon? imagemeister? — made her entrance in a heavily embroidered Martin Margiela bustier minidress, grand overcoat and miter, and was crowned on social media as the pope of fashion.  From the vantage point of today, it looks like a sign of things to come. "
5c7f60de49f0eacbf105b8d6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/06/world/asia/michael-jackson-radio-stations.html,"WELLINGTON, New Zealand — As the release of a new documentary detailing abuse accusations against the singer Michael Jackson has prompted debate about his legacy, the public response to its contents is also leading radio stations across the globe to stop playing his music. A radio network in Quebec pulled Jackson’s music from its nearly two dozen stations, according to The Canadian Press. In Britain, Variety reported that the BBC was forced to deny imposing such a ban after it was reported that the singer’s music had been “quietly dropped” from one of its stations. And the backlash has led to an almost complete removal of the singer’s music from the airwaves in New Zealand, after the two largest radio networks — which own most of the country’s commercial stations — said Wednesday that they would no longer play Jackson’s songs. In the New Zealand and Canadian cases, radio networks cited a change in public opinion about Jackson that was tied to the documentary “Leaving Neverland,” a two-part mini-series focusing on the accusations of two men who say Jackson abused them as children, as the reason for the ban. The program is scheduled for broadcast in New Zealand on Sunday and Monday. Leon Wratt, the content director of MediaWorks, one of the New Zealand radio companies, said audiences had indicated that they no longer wanted to hear Jackson’s music. “We aren’t deciding whether Michael Jackson is guilty of pedophilia or not,” he said in an interview on one of MediaWorks’ stations, Magic. “We’re just merely trying to make sure that our radio stations are going to play the music that people want to hear.” Mr. Wratt added that the accusations against Jackson had been public for years — the singer was cleared of child molesting charges after a trial in 2005. But viewers have reacted with shock to the new documentary. And its subjects, Wade Robson and James Safechuck, who detail disturbing accusations from their childhoods against Jackson, have received both plaudits and abuse for their part in it. Dean Buchanan, a spokesman for NZME, the other New Zealand radio network to pull Jackson’s music, said by email that the singer’s work was not being played “right now” on its stations. The country’s national public broadcaster, Radio New Zealand — which is primarily a talk station — also said that Jackson’s music currently did not feature in its air play, although a spokesman, John Barr, said that was not the result of a particular editorial decision. A Canadian media company, Cogeco, that told The Canadian Press it had banned Jackson’s music on its 23 stations in Quebec — including three major Montreal stations — cited the public response to “Leaving Neverland” as the reason. Neither NZME nor MediaWorks responded to questions about how long the ban would last, what date it began, or whether the networks planned to pull the songs of other musicians accused of wrongdoing, such as R. Kelly, who has been accused of, and denies, decades of serial misconduct. Mr. Wratt, the MediaWorks spokesman, said Jackson’s music would still be available on streaming services and in record stores for anyone who wanted to hear it. “The difference with radio, of course, is that if we play it you don’t have a choice,” he said. This is not the first time radio stations and streaming services have wrestled with whether to remove the music of artists accused of misconduct: Spotify last May instituted a policy of ceasing to promote or recommend R. Kelly’s music because of the accusations against him, though it rescinded the policy a month later after uproar from some in the music industry. Jackson’s estate in February canceled the Chicago run of a new jukebox musical about the singer three weeks after the Sundance premiere of “Leaving Neverland,” and two weeks before its HBO broadcast. The producers of the musical, “Don’t Stop ’Til You Get Enough,” cited scheduling difficulties caused by a labor dispute as the reason. The estate is seeking $100 million in damages from HBO over the “Leaving Neverland” documentary, which Howard Weitzman, the estate’s lawyer, branded “a disgrace.” "
5cb0f75949f0eacbf1f8388a,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/12/obituaries/sam-pilafian-dead.html,"Sam Pilafian, a virtuoso tuba player who performed an eclectic mix of classical, jazz, pop and rock music and brought unflagging exuberance to teaching young tubists, died on April 5 at his home in Tempe, Ariz. He was 69. His wife, Diann (Jezurski) Pilafian, said the cause was colon cancer. As a busy soloist, a founding member of the influential Empire Brass quintet and a partner to the acoustic guitarist Frank Vignola in the jazz group Travelin’ Light, Mr. Pilafian expanded the musical possibilities of his lumbering instrument. “He’s easily the best tuba player I’ve ever played with,” the trumpeter Charles Lewis, another original member of Empire Brass, said by telephone. “He could do everything — play all kinds of music — and he could light up a room.” Mr. Pilafian, a natural entertainer, was once nicknamed the Evel Knievel of the Tuba for daringly playing “The Clarinet Polka” while standing on his head. He also tried teaching the tuba to Fred Rogers on an episode of “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood” in 1985. “You have to blow through buzzing lips,” Mr. Pilafian told Mr. Rogers. After creating a sound, Mr. Rogers said, “Your lips tickle.” Mr. Pilafian tickled his lips during more than 40 years of diverse collaborations. He played with the singers Bernadette Peters and Barbara Cook; the Duke Ellington and Lionel Hampton orchestras; the ensemble on the Philip Glass album “Koyaanisqatsi” (1982); the New York Philharmonic and the Boston Symphony Orchestra, as a substitute or soloist; and Pink Floyd, on the 1979 album “The Wall.” “I did a lot of studio work back then,” Mr. Pilafian told The St. Louis Post-Dispatch in 1990, discussing his work on “The Wall.” “I had always studied jazz, so when I got to New York, I just ended up doing a lot of rock ’n’ roll.” Recalling his work with the trumpeter Lew Soloff and the trombonist James Pugh, he added, “When they combined our sound, they sweetened it so my tuba actually sounds more like a French horn on the album.” But Mr. Pilafian is best known for his work with Empire Brass, whose repertoire includes Renaissance and Baroque music, transcriptions of classical works, show tunes, Christmas songs and pieces composed for the quintet. It has released more than two dozen recordings. Empire Brass embraces the classic brass quintet configuration — a pair of trumpets, French horn, trombone and tuba — and has long been known for its virtuosity and showmanship. “You have not often heard an ensemble that played with more gusto than this one,” the New York Times music critic Donal Henahan wrote of an Empire recital in 1977. “Individual notes were hit in the center and chords were blended with the transparency that comes from exact corporate intonation. Phrases, even at dashing tempos, were lyrical and supple. Balances were perfectly achieved without any obtrusive effort.” Mr. Vignola recalled being a guest artist at a recording session with Empire Brass in the early 1990s when the producer asked him to make a jazz record with Mr. Pilafian. “Travelin’ Light,” the first of several albums they made, helped start them off as a touring duo. “Who would have thought, a jazz tuba and an acoustic guitar?” Mr. Vignola said in a telephone interview from Sweden, where he was performing. “We were an odd couple, but our act went over. Sam was a great entertainer and, like Louis Armstrong, broke all the rules.” James Samuel Pilafian was born on Oct. 25, 1949, in Miami. His father, James, was a lawyer, and his mother, Rosa (Boyajian) Pilafian, known as Shocky, was a paralegal in her husband’s firm and managed their commercial properties. Sam played the accordion as a youngster. But he switched instruments at 11 on the advice of a veteran tubist, who told him that if he played tuba he would always have friends. He was a quick study and within a few years had joined the musicians union and was playing in hotel orchestras that backed headliners like Frank Sinatra and Liza Minnelli, and in a six-piece Dixieland band that performed at racetracks and other places around Miami. While attending what is now the Frost School of Music at the University of Miami, where he earned a bachelor’s degree, he had a summer fellowship at the Tanglewood Music Center for advanced music training in Lenox, Mass. His tuba playing impressed Leonard Bernstein, who was an adviser there, and who enlisted him in the orchestra for the premiere of his theatrical work “Mass” at the opening of the Kennedy Center in Washington in 1971. Tanglewood was also the birthplace of Empire Brass. Michael Tilson Thomas, the music director of the San Francisco Symphony, was then a conducting student at Tanglewood. He told Bernstein that the five brass instrumentalists “should begin playing together because we sound alike, although we had never met,” Mr. Pilafian told The Post-Dispatch. “So we did,” he added, “and we became a rehearsal band, getting together just to rehearse.” He remained with the group for 22 years, leaving in 1993. Mr. Pilafian, whose tuba mentors included Arnold Jacobs, the longtime former principal tubist of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, was also a teacher for many years. He held positions at Boston University, Berklee College of Music, the Tanglewood Institute, Arizona State University and the Frost School. He and a fellow tubist, Patrick Sheridan, developed a series of exercises adapted from martial arts and yoga to help singers and wind and brass players breathe more effectively. “My teaching philosophy has always been predicated on catching students doing something right,” he told the magazine The Brass Herald  in 2013. The tubist Andrew Hitz recalled being a shy 14-year-old at Tanglewood in the summer of 1990 when Mr. Pilafian eased his fears. “I could play as well as anybody, but I was scared and in tears,” Mr. Hitz said by telephone. “But Sam was able with me, and countless others, to insulate us from criticism and make us feel you were safe, while challenging the hell out of you. The gift he gave me is that I never again questioned whether I belonged with any musicians.” In addition to his wife, Mr. Pilafian is survived by his sons, Alexander Sarkis Pilafian and Zev Levin-Pilafian, and his sisters, Marni Pilafian and Nerisa Gay Pilafian. When Mr. Pilafian was in college, he was determined to do whatever was necessary to elevate his musicianship. So he tried an experiment with a friend, Mike Gerber, a blind pianist, he told NDSU Magazine in 2017, when he was a visiting artist at North Dakota State University. Fascinated by Mr. Gerber’s heightened sense of hearing, Mr. Pilafian bandaged his own eyes. He was disoriented that first day but felt that his hearing had noticeably improved after three days. On Day 4, he concluded that his listening had grown dramatically acute, and he could play back whatever Mr. Gerber played on the piano. “Nothing was the same after that,” he said. "

What role can darkness play in improvised music, which has historically been built on a spirit of earnest collaboration and bright, restorative energy? The guitarists Ben Monder and David Torn have been building their musical legacies for over three decades, and both approach those questions in their work. But listen to their latest albums — Mr. Torn’s pummeling, acid-drenched “Sun of Goldfinger,” which came out last month; Mr. Monder’s moody and entrancing double CD, “Day After Day,” due out Friday — and you’ll find two very different ways of answering. Mr. Monder uses only a modest rack of pedals, and his music is elegantly determined and precise. Mr. Torn’s goes the other way: multidirectional, constantly adding conflict to already precarious situations. If Mr. Monder’s music stares into the void, Mr. Torn’s seems as if it’s just been released from it, and is now fleeing in search of safer ground. It’s no coincidence that David Bowie hired both of them, at different stages in his late career, to collaborate: Mr. Torn on his post-9/11 album, “Heathen,” among others; Mr. Monder on “Blackstar,” Bowie’s bleak final masterpiece. Young guitarists seeking fresh approaches and a new hybridity between their instruments and gear are increasingly treating jazz, metal and electronic music as interrelated systems. Mr. Monder’s and Mr. Torn’s separate careers over the past three decades have set the table for Rafiq Bhatia, Anthony Pirog and Ava Mendoza, to name a few. And their work continues to be at least as creatively vital as their younger counterparts’. Since the early 1990s, Mr. Monder, 56, has established a shadowy but unmistakable sound: He plays chords in a low-lit, humming tone or a blurred, finger-plucking wash; usually he wedges one or two misfit notes in the middle of his harmonies, making them sound conflicted. And he has a decisive, slow-handed way of soloing, though you wouldn’t necessarily know it from most of his albums. On records, he usually composes lengthy pieces full of intricate harmonic weaves, with hardly any room for improvisation — a testament to his early infatuations with jazz-rock fusion and classical music. “Day After Day,” however, is different. It’s Mr. Monder’s first collection of covers, and Disc 1 is his first extended foray into solo-guitar recording. The second CD finds him in a trio, playing relatively straightforward renditions of popular songs by Bob Dylan, Burt Bacharach and Fleetwood Mac — and, yes, soloing. On his other albums, he’s so distinctive that it can be hard to pin down any individual big influences. On this album, the importance of the fusion guitarist Ralph Towner and Jim Hall, the master of harmonically rich, 20th-century jazz guitar, becomes clear. Mr. Monder played in two of the most important large ensembles of the 1990s — the Maria Schneider Orchestra and Guillermo Klein y Los Guachos — and developed symbiotic partnerships with figures such as Paul Motian, the fabled drummer, and Theo Bleckmann, a virtuoso vocalist. Last year, he served as the linchpin on Dan Weiss’s well-received project “Starebaby,” an explicit marriage of jazz and metal. Mr. Monder has a print of a small, phosphorescent De Chirico painting on the wall in his practice room at home in south Brooklyn. “There are paintings that seem to convey what I’m trying to sound like,” he said on a recent Saturday morning, considering the image’s metaphysical qualities. His tall frame was coiled up on his stool, and his demeanor was warm but reticent; he ended most statements with a self-effacing joke. He described a recurring dream that he said the painting always reminds him of. “I’m in a room, which is flooded with light, and I’m practicing, and I’m able to play just, anything,” he said. “It’s super inspiring, and I always wake up and I’m like, ‘Where did that go?’” If Mr. Monder’s fantasy is about finding an unobstructed path from idea to execution, Mr. Torn’s is almost the opposite: He likes to surround himself with as much clutter and complication as possible, and figure a way out. In addition to his formidable fleet of pedals and electronics, the 65-year-old musician has built three signal-interrupter buttons into the body of his electric guitar, so that at any moment he can snap himself out of an improvisation’s flow by triggering silence, or a screeching tone, or a sample of something being played by another musician onstage. “I want these things to be random enough that I’m surprised by them,” he said breezily in a recent interview. On “Sun of Goldfinger,” he is joined by the alto saxophonist Tim Berne (a longtime collaborator) and the drummer Ches Smith for two 20-minute-long improvisations. A third, equally long track, “Spartan, Before It Hit,” also features the pianist Craig Taborn and a string quartet, playing a long composition full of saxophone melodies that are sometimes doleful and sometimes strident. Different instruments echo and add friction to each other, and then midway through the performance, the written piece ends and a squall of atonal playing erupts. Eventually it flattens out into near-silence, leading to a long denouement. The album feels like an extension of Mr. Torn’s other recent releases, “Prezens,” with a quartet, and “Only Sky,” his first solo-guitar recording. Both albums were almost entirely improvised then edited afterward. Movement and narrative become secondary to the feeling of being ensconced in sound; your ear is caught in a battle between gravity and weightlessness. Mr. Torn, like Mr. Monder, grew up outside New York City and was inspired by the pyrotechnics of classic rock and fusion. And he too found his way toward a ruminative, personal style. Mr. Torn’s father was a sound engineer who designed stereos, and David grew up thinking not just about music but about sound, as an element with its own dimensions and layers. He had a formative experience at 16, watching Jimi Hendrix play at the Woodstock festival, his guitar soaked in distortion. “That made me rethink everything,” Mr. Torn said. Mr. Torn’s music has always tilted toward the atmospheric, and in the 1990s he started creating film soundtracks. He played on the scores to “The Big Lebowski,” “Traffic” and “A Knight’s Tale,” among others, before starting to compose entire soundtracks himself in the 2000s. It was during this period that he suffered a life-changing brain injury, and lost the ability to hear in one ear. It was a great hardship, but Mr. Torn treated it as just another part of life’s ongoing improvisation. “Life is a continuum in most ways, so an interrupter can be a part of the continuum,” he said, explaining that he had to relearn how to listen to music. “I think my great love of distortion became very fine-tuned.” Performing last month at the Big Ears Festival in Knoxville, Tenn., he played a solo set one day, and with the “Sun of Goldfinger” trio the next. In Mr. Torn’s playing there were elements of Hendrix’s snaky, blues-based improvisations, and elsewhere, the thickness and wide-open empty power of doom metal. Whether he was evading darkness or running straight into it, this music had levels of history built in, and a mind of its own. "
5c6d6bd03a125f5075c0a9a7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/20/theater/joe-iconis-be-more-chill-broadway.html,"Joe Iconis exploded out of N.Y.U. on a wave of hope. A songwriter with a knack for story and a taste for strange, he won the Jonathan Larson grant for early career composers. He scooped up the Kleban prize for most promising lyricist. He was hailed by Newsday as “ginormously talented.” The descriptors piled up until they made no sense any more. Emerging. Rising. Up-and-coming. But something wasn’t clicking. Year after year he wrote song after song, show after show. Small-scale productions came and went; big-time producers did not. He sustained himself on determination. And side jobs. And borrowed money. But mostly, he sustained himself with an unusual artistic collective — the Family, an evolving cohort of multitalented misfits (their word) — that, for more than a decade, has plied basements and barns, singing Mr. Iconis’s rock- and pop-influenced songs to a growing audience of fans. It is fandom that is finally propelling Mr. Iconis to Broadway. The sci-fi high school musical “Be More Chill,” for which he wrote music and lyrics, was left for dead in New Jersey after a tepid review from The New York Times. Resurrection has come thanks to young enthusiasts, who created YouTube videos using the show’s music, shared fan art on Tumblr, and have streamed the cast album more than 200 million times. The show, adapted from a young adult novel by Ned Vizzini about a nerdy teenager who swallows a pill-sized supercomputer that promises to improve his life, is now in previews at the Lyceum Theater; about half the cast are performers who are part of Mr. Iconis’s crew. Now he is spending his nights where he has long wanted to be, in the row of creators cradling laptops and binders at the back of a Broadway theater, polishing the show before it opens March 10. On his right forearm he sports a tattoo of a mule. “Hairy and stubborn,” he explains. “Just like me.” Mr. Iconis, 37, says his life changed forever when, as a 6-year-old growing up on Long Island, he saw his first Off Broadway musical: the original production of “Little Shop of Horrors,” a zany rock romp about a blood-craving, flesh-eating houseplant. “I was a little kid who was really scared — I would always cry in movies, and I never wanted to be away from my parents,” he said. “But ‘Little Shop’ didn’t scare me. It made me feel alive.” Each year for his birthday, and sometimes on holidays, he would see another show. He tracked theater seasons by reading newspaper ads; he tried to estimate box office grosses by calling ticket sellers to ask about seat availability. He loved theater. But he hated performing. “I was always terrible,” he said. “I knew I was terrible. And it terrified me.” So he took to the piano, writing songs, directing shows, doing anything that allowed him to make theater without being center stage. “I both gravitate toward and identify with people who feel like they don’t quite fit in,” he said. In college and grad school, both at New York University, he zeroed in on writing, and for his thesis in 2005, he crafted a musical about a garage band, “The Black Suits,” that seemed to have promise. “I thought, ‘This show will be produced Off Broadway, it will be well received, it will go to Broadway, and this is how I will enter into the musical theater world,’” he said. The universe had other ideas. And Mr. Iconis, a prolific writer, was impatient to get his songs heard. So in 2006 he staged a concert at Ars Nova, a small but prestigious theater that seeks to develop early-career artists. He thought of “Things to Ruin,” as he called it, as a theatrical version of a rock album that never existed. He was the de facto frontman, playing the piano and occasionally singing, and he found that he now relished that. But his shows were also a showcase for his friends. The cabaret scene in New York was dominated by solo acts and celebrities, but Mr. Iconis wanted something different — a sort of troupe of troubadours, most of them unknown. He had inspirations in mind — the filmmaker Robert Altman, for one, but also the Muppets, because, in Mr. Iconis’s fervid imagination, they are the model of an ensemble that successfully integrates friendship and theatermaking. There were maybe 10 participants to start — among them Jason Tam and Jason SweetTooth Williams, both of whom are in the cast of “Be More Chill,” Mr. Tam as the Squip (that’s the supercomputer) and Mr. Williams in three roles, including a high school drama teacher. By last Christmas, when Joe Iconis and Friends performed what are now their annual Christmas shows at Feinstein’s/54 Below, directed by his longtime collaborator John Simpkins, there were 65 performers — onstage, interspersed among the audience, even caroling in the bathrooms. “We were a bunch of rambunctious punk kids that loved musical theater but maybe didn’t quite fit into the quintessential musical theater mold,” Mr. Tam said. “But we found each other and we found Joe Iconis.” Many of his songs are clever and raw, like “Everybody’s at the Bar Without Me,” a furious ballad about feeling left out, and “The Goodbye Song,” the raucous singalong which closes most shows, inspired by a dying father bidding farewell to his child, but also weaving in affectionate allusions to E.T.’s return home in the great 1982 Spielberg movie. In the early years, the concerts were mostly at the Laurie Beechman Theater, a basement space underneath a Times Square restaurant, and at Joe’s Pub, part of the Public Theater. In recent years, the main performances have been over Labor Day weekend at Barrington Stage Company in the Berkshires, and in December with a series of Christmas-themed shows at 54 Below, but there have been lots of others — even a private party attended by James Earl Jones. “It feels like this crazy circus that has followed him and helped put the music out there and spread the word about what he does,” said Lauren Marcus, who met Mr. Iconis when she was at N.Y.U., sang in one of his earliest concerts, and then married him at a ceremony followed by a jamboree. The performances are silly and celebratory and self-referential. The recent Christmas show included jokes about “making people go viral” (an allusion to “Be More Chill”), and managed to be at once ever-so-winkingly politically incorrect and super-woke. (“Baby, It’s Cold Outside” featured an interpolated exchange between the two performers about the gender politics of the song.) Over the years, artists have come, and gone, and come again. “The more I met people, the more it started to become this idea — like I’m driving a bus, and I would tell people to hop on, and they could stay as long as they want to,” Mr. Iconis said. “The whole Family idea is loose enough to accommodate the lives of working artists — it needed to allow people to come and go as their life allowed.” Some are on Broadway — Eric William Morris, a longtime member of the Family who portrays an addled bartender in the Christmas shows, is now starring in a musical adaptation of “King Kong” — but many, like Mr. Iconis, have long been waiting for a big break. “We shared that feeling — when is this going to happen, and should we just go be investment bankers?” Mr. Williams said. “What got him and all of us through these struggling times were these concerts that we did together.” There’s been some blowback. “I definitely have a reputation of being very loyal, and that’s important to me — I love creating art with artists I have a history and a relationship with,” Mr. Iconis said. “But there was this notion of me as a frat boy working with his college friends. People got so insane about this idea of me just working with my buds.” He is unapologetic about wanting to advance his collaborators, and not simply allow them to be replaced by “someone who was on a TV show in 2003,” which is how he often sees theater casting. “Many people have performed my stuff brilliantly for years, and I feel like it’s my responsibility to do whatever I can to help,” he said. George Salazar, an actor who was featured in a Broadway revival of “Godspell” when he met Mr. Iconis, started singing in his concerts, and is now starring in “Be More Chill” as the protagonist’s best friend; his emotional rendition of the show’s big number, “Michael in the Bathroom,” has made him an internet sensation. “The Family is a group of misfits,” Mr. Salazar said, “but the things that make us strange and different are the very things Joe enjoys.” Mr. Iconis likes to write in public spaces — coffee shops and bars — away from the piano, focusing on lyric and drama, and letting that drive melody. He has been prolific, helping to create 10 full-length musicals, but has also been increasingly disappointed that none found commercial success, and at times has even wondered whether he should try to convert one of his side jobs, graphic design, into a full-time career. “He’s had a tough time getting shows on, because people don’t know where to place his shows — they have a childlike exuberance for adults,” said Julianne Boyd, the artistic director of Barrington Stage. He is culturally omnivorous, and often turns to musicals or films to explain his own feelings. Asked about his frustration, he cites a scene in “Boogie Nights” when the porn star protagonist realizes he is not going to get where he wanted, and a moment in “Synecdoche, New York” when a character buys a house on fire, knowing it might kill her. But one doesn’t have to look far to see how taxing his long journey has been: His breakout song, “Broadway, Here I Come!,” an oft-covered number featured on the NBC television series “Smash,” is, at its most literal, about someone hoping to get to Broadway who contemplates suicide. “I never stopped working, and I never stopped doing concerts, but it started to feel like there was a bit of doom hanging over everything, and then I started to see other people now coming up, and they were the next big things, and I was passed over,” he said. “After a while it started to feel exhausting.” He was introduced to “Be More Chill” by his agent, who suggested that he and the book writer, Joe Tracz, take a look at the novel. From the beginning, members of the Family have been part of the development process. The Broadway cast includes not only Mr. Tam, Mr. Williams, Ms. Marcus and Mr. Salazar, but also stars Will Roland, who as an N.Y.U. student in 2008 had a cameo in the Christmas show. And one of the show’s producers, Jennifer Ashley Tepper, was a college student interning at the York Theater Company when she stumbled across an Iconis demo tape; she was wowed, and has been helping produce his concerts and shows for the last decade. “The path has been hard,” she said. “There was one night when I was so upset about a bad review a show of Joe’s got that I threw a glass out a window.” “Be More Chill,” directed by Stephen Brackett, had its initial production at Two River Theater in New Jersey; Mr. Iconis and his collaborators thought it was going well, but after The New York Times disagreed, that was the end of that. “We spent nearly two years trying to get producers and regional theaters interested, and it was very clear no one was,” Mr. Iconis said. So he agreed to license the show for community productions, and many signed up; since June of 2017, R&H Theatricals has issued 145 licenses for the show. Among those who licensed the show was Jerry Goehring, the director of the theater arts program at a Connecticut college, Sacred Heart University. He was startled at how quickly the school’s production, which he directed, sold out, and how many people traveled from afar to see it, so he optioned the rights. Last summer, Mr. Goehring and Ms. Tepper rented space Off Broadway to stage a commercial run of the show. That, too, sold out, with throngs of young people defying the critics and flocking to the show. So Broadway, here they come. And now that Mr. Iconis is a Broadway composer, the theater world is opening to him further. Emboldened by “Be More Chill,” which is selling well in early previews, Ms. Tepper is planning this week to announce a commercial Off Broadway production of another Iconis show, “Broadway Bounty Hunter,” about an out-of-work actor who finds a job hunting criminals. It stars Annie Golden, who, although more than a generation older than Mr. Iconis and his college friends, is one of his most loyal collaborators. He has two more high-profile works in process: “The Untitled Unauthorized Hunter S. Thompson Musical,” commissioned by La Jolla Playhouse, with a Tony-winning director, Christopher Ashley, attached; and “Punk Rock Girl,” a jukebox musical featuring songs popularized by female musicians. “The dream is that it’s a show done by school groups, and that it would be impossible not to cast the strangest kids — the kids who would normally do tech,” Mr. Iconis said. “That was my guiding principle — to write roles for the weird kids."" As he watches “Be More Chill” through the preview process, he is obviously nervous, aware that critics still may not embrace his work. But he is determined to use the energy surrounding this show to fuel his other projects. “You can use your theater cred to do film or TV or music, but I’m just not interested,” he said. “The thing I want to do is have musicals running in theaters, hopefully close to, or on, Broadway.” "
5c76e03149f0eacbf105a7cc,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/27/arts/music/gunna-drip-or-drown-2-review.html,"At the beginning of “3 Headed Snake,” from his new album, “Drip or Drown 2,” Gunna is beautifully mumbling. Words are in there somewhere, but they’re genuinely of no concern. Rather than use a mumble to signal confusion or disorientation, he treats blurry words as a thing of exuberance. For him, the dance of pure syllables is almost peppy. Gunna is not the first rapper to retreat into the warm cocoon of pure tones. He is a dutiful student of Young Thug’s non sequitur filigree, which dominates the sound of streaming and has been put to use by everyone from Post Malone to Lil Baby. But Gunna is preternaturally chill, almost koan-like in his delivery. His voice is whisper-sweet. He raps on beats as if lightly touching them, fearful that they might snap under too much force. For the last couple of years, the 25-year-old rapper from Georgia has been releasing strong mixtapes steadily — “Drip or Drown 2” doesn’t quite have the full force of last year’s “Drip Season 3” or “Drip Harder,” his collaborative album with Lil Baby, but it is still thick with his signatures: calmness and word manipulation. Sometimes he bends words so hard that “ways” rhymes with “bags.” Sometimes he emphasizes the rhyme in the middle of the phrase as much as the one at the end of it. Sometimes he is narrative-driven, rapping about new cars, new clothes and new women, but generally he strings clauses together as if absent-minded, a fever dream of excess and bravado. (The most pure version of this here is on “Speed It Up,” where the phrases come hot and short.) In places, he opts for surrealism: “Pop an addy while I’m riding to meet Tom Ford.” And sometimes he leans on humor: “Got vintage garments old as my granny.” Gunna has a penchant for rapping over beats that include guitar, like on “Richard Millie Plain,” but he doesn’t use them for rock scabrousness. Instead, they’re caressing, soft-edged beds, elegant accompaniment for a rapper who makes his points with textures more than words. That said, there is a tenderness that peeks through here, not just in the gentleness of the sing-rapping, but also in some of the lyrics. Everyone raps about buying expensive new things, but only Gunna links the ability to spend money wantonly to emotional intimacy. On “Idk Why,” he raps, “Mama thanked me for her purse/And looked me in my face and then she started crying.” And on “Yao Ming,” he relates a tale familiar to anyone who thinks of a loved one while traveling: “Went shopping in Japan, spent more than my show/Brought Thugger back some pants.” "
5c51bbf63a125f5075c071bf,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/30/arts/music/grammy-awards-music-video.html,"Another year, another persistent worry that the Grammy Awards will once again fail to recognize boundary-pushing black performers. The nominations  are led by Kendrick Lamar, Drake and a crop of female artists — a promising shift after years of complaints about a lack of diversity at the music industry’s big night. However, nominations don’t necessarily turn into wins: Two years ago, Beyoncé was snubbed in the major categories; in 2018, Jay-Z received the most nominations of any artist and walked away empty-handed. But at this year’s ceremony, which will take place Feb. 10, there is one category in which the Recording Academy has nominated a surprisingly sophisticated set of performers, all of whom are black: best music video. (In addition to the artist, this Grammy is awarded to the video’s director and producer.) In the Grammy context, the music video category — No. 83 out of 84 on the official list — is generally an afterthought. It was instituted in 1984, the same year MTV inaugurated its Video Music Awards, just as the medium was becoming central to star-making. At this moment — when artists are as likely to develop their audiences on YouTube as on any audio-only platform, and in which expertise in self-presentation and self-promotion is mandatory — the category feels essential. The nominations recognize clips that shaped conversation as much as the songs they illustrate. Some of these videos are wholesale pieces of art in which the visuals and music are fundamentally inseparable; sometimes the importance of the video itself trumps that of the song. Childish Gambino’s “This Is America” and Joyner Lucas’s “I’m Not Racist” present competing narratives about the state of black life in this country. “Apes**t,” by Jay-Z and Beyoncé (recording as the Carters), is a lush fantasia about dismantling old power hierarchies. Janelle Monáe’s “Pynk” is a wild, psychedelic tour of female amorousness. And Tierra Whack’s “Mumbo Jumbo” serves a strong dose of surrealism. Of these nominees, “This Is America” was the most influential and revelatory last year, a stark, violent, ecstatic and darkly comic statement of intent from Childish Gambino, the musical alter ego of the actor Donald Glover. It was also the first music project from Glover that embodied the tension and savvy of his work in other mediums, particularly the television show “Atlanta.” In the video, Glover saunters, slides, shimmies and bolts his way through a warehouse. His body movements careen from the sensual to the frustrated — he is a performer, a pleaser, but one at war with those impulses, torn between delivering joy and extinguishing it. Sometimes he’s nailing dances from the Instagram Explore page or the video-sharing app Triller, but then he brakes hard, finds a gun and kills fellow performers offering less fraught forms of musical healing. “This is America/Don’t catch you slippin’ up,” he raps, setting terms for negotiating a white society that leaves barely any margin for black error. At the end of the video, as Young Thug sings, “You just a black man in this world/You just a bar code,” Glover runs directly at the camera — first in darkness, only the whites of his eyes and teeth visible. Then he emerges into the light, frantic, no longer in control. This burst of dystopian pessimism has a dim contrast in “I’m Not Racist,” which is almost grotesquely earnest and naïvely optimistic. It, too, takes place in a warehouse, where an aggrieved, bearded MAGA-hat-wearing white man faces off against a skeptical black man. The 30-year-old Massachusetts rapper Lucas (who is black) performs both verses, first from the perspective of the white conservative (with an abundance of racial epithets), and later, from that of the black man who can’t bear to listen anymore. As music, it is onerous agitpop — an egregious case of bothsidesism. As video, it’s unintentionally comic, mawkish passing for sober. Throughout the clip, the tension grows; the white man stands up and hovers over his counterpart, pointing and yelling. Eventually, the black man stands up, flips the table, knocks the MAGA hat off his sparring partner’s head. It seems like there will be resolution, that the guy who insists he’s not racist will finally come to the realization that he is. But then the men face each other and hug, a hilarious conclusion that pretends problems can be solved by simply airing grievances, not addressing them. It feels antiquated and childishly hopeful, as if it had been released in a less tumultuous time — like, say, the early 2010s. Both of these videos are premised on the anxiety that’s born of systemic misunderstanding, confrontation and racism. For a recalibration of that dynamic, there is “Apes**t,” the audacious Jay-Z and Beyoncé video filmed in the Louvre, which proposes that black beauty and creativity belong in museums, too, and that no exclusively white space should remain that way. It is a lavish affair, aesthetically and conceptually, energized by the fact that, on a basic level, the art on the Louvre walls is static, but the performers in the space are not. When a passel of dancers, lying prone atop the Daru staircase, begins to convulse and come to life, it feels like watching birth. Throughout the clip, Beyoncé and Jay-Z hold the screen with intensity and confidence, as natural in this hallowed space as in their home(s). In this, the later stage of their respective careers, engagement with high art has emerged as a crucial signifier, one beyond music, or fashion or other more conventional displays of material wealth. While “Apes**t” doesn’t feel as fully formed or thoughtfully executed as Beyoncé’s “Formation,” which won in this category in 2017, its near-casualness is a loud statement. All three of these videos are designed as provocations of a sort, thinkpiece-bait event releases designed to cut through online clutter. Put out a song on streaming services, and it might be swallowed whole by the ocean. In this crowded climate, creating a vivid video is a survival strategy, especially with no tastemaker outlet (à la MTV) directly promoting/privileging the format. That is how the most effective music videos function today: as time-stopping conversation pieces. But this category also recognizes artists who understand how crucial video is to image formation, and who build it into their output from the earliest stages of their careers. Monáe’s “Pynk” is excerpted from a short film called “Dirty Computer” that accompanied her 2018 album of the same name. Since her early days, Monáe has excelled at character development, and her music functions best as part of an audiovisual whole. “Pynk” is a frothy, playful celebration of sexual openness, straightforward in narrative but inventive in presentation. It was part of a broader story she told last year, in art and in public life, about coming out as queer. The 23-year-old rapper Tierra Whack is a natural visual eccentric and fantastical inheritor of Monáe, as well as of Missy Elliott, Busta Rhymes, the director Chris Cunningham and others. Her excellent 2018 debut album, “Whack World,” was 15 minutes long, one minute per song, and released as one long video full of Whack inhabiting various oddball characters. Strangely, she’s nominated here for “Mumbo Jumbo,” a single that predated that album. Where “Whack World” feels like an extended art project, “Mumbo Jumbo” scans as a micro horror film. Whack is in a dentist’s chair, singing through a mouth retractor. At the end of her surgery, her smile has been exaggerated into an overblown grin. She walks out onto the street, which is as decrepit as Glover’s warehouse, and is surrounded by suffering people saddled with the same false grin — almost an echo of the hollow-eyed sunken place victims in “Get Out.” The song is fine, sort of an extended melodic mumble. But for Whack, perhaps more than any of her fellow nominees, the video is the story. Inventive videos have won in this category before: Janet and Michael Jackson’s “Scream” in 1996, Missy Elliott’s “Lose Control” in 2006, and “Formation.” But more frequently it has gone to the just-fine-enough (or just-expensive-enough) video for an otherwise very popular song, or to an artist so famous (say, the Beatles, in 1997) that Grammy voters tick their box reflexively. But moving forward, this category should be seen as an opportunity to embrace a whole new breed of musician, one who reflects what has long been true but rarely acknowledged at the Grammys: that the job of a recording artist has changed, and that those now making the most vivid impact are as careful about how they look as how they sound. "
5c3bd0eb3a125f5075c0432a,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/13/arts/music/super-bowl-halftime-maroon-5-travis-scott-big-boi.html,"The N.F.L. on Sunday ended months of uncertainty by officially announcing Maroon 5 and the rappers Travis Scott and Big Boi as the lineup for this year’s Super Bowl halftime show. In an indication of how fraught the debate around the high-profile performance has become, Scott released a statement on Sunday announcing that he and the N.F.L. will partner on a $500,000 donation to the social justice group Dream Corps — a move that seemed to be aimed at stemming a backlash from groups that have criticized the football league’s policies. Sources familiar with the N.F.L.’s Super Bowl plans had confirmed the rock band Maroon 5 as the headliner as long ago as September, and Scott emerged last month as a reported addition to the Feb. 3 halftime performance at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta. Big Boi, the newest name on the bill, is a member of the Atlanta rap group Outkast. But the run-up to this year’s halftime announcement had turned into a skirmish over sports and politics, as artists and others criticized the N.F.L. over its treatment of Colin Kaepernick and other players who have taken a knee during the national anthem in protest of racial injustice. In February, the rapper Cardi B, who was featured on Maroon 5’s hit “Girls Like You” last year, told the celebrity news website TMZ that she would consider performing at a halftime show “when they hire Colin Kaepernick back.” In a song released last June, Jay-Z rapped, “I said no to the Super Bowl, you need me, I don’t need you.” Scott’s involvement, specifically, has prompted criticism from some. In an interview with TMZ, the Rev. Al Sharpton said he thought Scott “should do what a lot of other major artists have done — say, ‘I’m not going to participate.’” “You can’t fight against Jim Crow and then go sit in the back of the bus,” he added. In a pair of tweets, the rapper Meek Mill responded to the news that Scott would be performing with, “For what????” and “He don’t need that he on fire already!” And Gerald Griggs, first vice president of the Atlanta chapter of the N.A.A.C.P., told The Guardian that the chapter had contacted artists and asked them not to perform. “The majority of artists we’ve reached out to are standing in solidarity against the N.F.L.,” Griggs said. “They do not want to be associated because of the protest that was started by Mr. Kaepernick against racial injustice and police brutality.” For his part, Van Jones, the president of Dream Corps and a founder of the group, celebrated the announcement in a post on Twitter, addressing Scott by his handle. “This is great news!” Jones wrote. “Welcome, @trvisXX. Glad to have you with us, brother!” "
5c86cae449f0eacbf105c7ca,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/11/business/media/michael-jackson-music.html,"Canceling Michael Jackson, it seems, may not be so easy. Since HBO’s broadcast last week of “Leaving Neverland” — a two-part, four-hour spotlight on two men who said Mr. Jackson had abused them when they were young boys — reams of commentary have been devoted to whether fans could ever listen to “Off the Wall” or “Thriller” again in good conscience. But the numbers show that, at least so far, the popularity of Mr. Jackson’s music has not budged. Since the beginning of the year, songs from Mr. Jackson’s solo catalog have been streamed 16 million to 17 million times each week in the United States on services like Spotify, Apple Music and Tidal, according to Nielsen. Last week, including the period immediately after the documentary’s premiere on March 3 and 4, the total was 16,497,000 streams. Even the daily listening pattern did not vary since the HBO documentary was shown. On the two days of the “Leaving Neverland” premiere, a Sunday and a Monday, Mr. Jackson’s streaming numbers dipped below his typical daily average of about 2.3 million — but that was in line with the usual streaming pattern of his songs, which tends to peak in the middle of the week. In the three days after the film, those numbers climbed back up. By Thursday — the last day for which complete information is available — they had risen to 2.5 million. Particularly popular, as always, were hits like “Beat It,” “Billie Jean” and “Thriller.” A rival music data service, BuzzAngle, traced a similar pattern. According to BuzzAngle, weekly streams for Mr. Jackson this year hovered around 16 million until the middle of February, when they shot up to 22.8 million, suggesting that publicity for the documentary had stirred interest. By last week the totals had settled down, to 17.1 million. Could those numbers fall? In the days after the film, news blips suggested that Mr. Jackson’s legacy was slowly being affected. The producers of “The Simpsons” pulled a 28-year-old episode featuring Mr. Jackson’s voice from circulation. Radio stations in Canada and New Zealand said they would stop playing Mr. Jackson’s music. A statue of the star was removed from a British soccer museum. Radio stations in the United States have been cautious, significantly reducing the number of plays of Mr. Jackson’s music. According to Nielsen, Mr. Jackson’s songs have been played about 2,000 times a day on American radio stations in recent months. That number began to slip in February, and since the documentary aired it has dropped sharply, to about 1,500 a day through Sunday. “The court of public opinion seems to have convicted Michael, but at the same time, he has supporters who love him,” said David Bakula, a senior analyst at Nielsen. “For the long term, it might take two or three weeks for this to settle into a pattern.” The comedian Pete Davidson described what fans of Mr. Jackson and R. Kelly, who faces accusations of sexual misconduct with underage girls, have been wrestling with on the most recent episode of “Saturday Night Live.” “You don’t know how good someone’s music really is until you find out they’re a pedophile,” Mr. Davidson said during a “Weekend Update” segment. The recent business performance of Mr. Kelly may provide clues on how Mr. Jackson’s musical legacy may be affected by “Leaving Neverland.” Like Mr. Jackson, Mr. Kelly was tried and acquitted of sexual misconduct with minors. In early January, the popularity of Lifetime’s documentary “Surviving R. Kelly” caused a quick jump in the streams of his songs. But in the weeks since, even with frequent news developments in the Kelly story — he was dropped by RCA Records, was indicted and gave a bizarre television interview — his numbers have plummeted. In the first week of the year, Mr. Kelly had 13.2 million streams. The week after the documentary, that figure fell to 10.8 million. Over the last six weeks, his average has been about six million, and sales of his CDs and downloads have fallen by more than half. HBO’s premiere of “Leaving Neverland” drew an audience of 1.3 million, Nielsen reported. The next night, the second part had 927,000 viewers, and the Oprah Winfrey-led “After Neverland” discussion had 780,000. As of Monday, the total audience for Part 1 had risen to a healthy 3.7 million, thanks to delayed viewing on television, DVR and the HBO platforms HBO Go and HBO Now, and the second part of “Leaving Neverland” had been watched by 2.5 million viewers.

Those expecting a ho-hum Grammys night were surely jolted awake on Sunday when, just minutes into the show, Michelle Obama walked onto the stage hand-in-hand with Lady Gaga, Jada Pinkett Smith and Jennifer Lopez. They were joined by the host Alicia Keys. In the surprise appearance, which doubled as a moment of female solidarity the Grammys needed, Obama spoke to the crowd as it erupted in applause and cheers. “All right, all right, we got a show to do,” Obama, who wore a loose-fitting shimmering silver jumpsuit, said playfully when the audience wouldn’t settle down. [Here’s the full list of Grammys winners.] “From the Motown records I wore out on the South Side to the ‘who run the world’ songs that fueled me through this last decade, music has always helped me tell my story, and I know that’s true for everybody here,” she continued, referring to the Chicago neighborhood where she was raised. “Whether we like country or rap or rock, music helps us share ourselves, our dignity and sorrows, our hopes and joys. It allows us to hear one another, to invite each other in. Music shows us that all of it matters — every story within every voice, every note within every song. Is that right ladies?” she said as many in the crowd remained standing. The moment could not have come at a better time for the show. Last year, the event, which has struggled to stay relevant, came under fire for a statement made by Neil Portnow, the chief executive of the Recording Academy. Women in music should “step up” to advance their careers, he had said. The academy has since changed its membership and nominations process in efforts to address underlying problems of inequality. On Sunday night, the women onstage with Obama spoke about how music gave them a space to explore who they are. “They said I was weird, that my look, my choices, my sound, that it wouldn’t work,” Lady Gaga said. “But music told me not to listen to them. Music took my ears, took my hands, my voice and my soul, and it led me to all of you and to my Little Monsters who I love so much.” Next, Pinkett Smith spoke. “We express our pain, power, progress through music — whether we’re creating it, or just appreciating it,” she said. “But here’s what I know: Every voice we hear deserves to be honored and respected.” Lopez closed out the segment. “Back in the Bronx, music gave me a reason to dance, from hip-hop to freestyle, pop, soul and salsa,” she said. “It kept me moving from the block to the big stages and even bigger screens. It reminds me where I come from, but it also reminds me of all the places I can go. Music remains the one place we can all feel truly free.” [See all the looks from the Grammys red carpet.] "
5c61bbe43a125f5075c091df,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/11/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-tourism-music-festival.html,"AL ULA, Saudi Arabia — The new Italian-designed concert hall in the middle of the desert shimmered in the sunset light, its walls of mirror reflecting the golden sandstone hills and cliffs. Inside, a symphony orchestra from China rehearsed a Western classical piece, preparing for a concert featuring the Chinese pianist Lang Lang. The serene and lilting notes floated through the empty hall. The concert was part of a series with performances by Andrea Bocelli, Yanni and Majida El Roumi taking place this winter in Saudi Arabia. From the western desert, Saudi Arabia appears to be a different country than the one that has been under constant criticism from American politicians and other international officials since last October, when Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the 33-year-old de facto ruler, was first accused of ordering the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a Virginia resident and Washington Post columnist. The C.I.A. has since concluded that the Crown Prince was responsible for Mr. Khashoggi’s killing, and its strongest evidence includes intercepted conversations. The Saudi government denies he was involved. Prince Mohammed has also come under international criticism for imprisoning human rights activists and detaining hundreds of people in a hotel, as well as for waging a war in Yemen that has fueled what the United Nations calls the world’s worst man-made humanitarian crisis. But at the same time, officials under his rule are trying to build up Saudi Arabia’s tourism and culture industries by promoting events like the music festival. In past years, an event like this would not have taken place in a remote region of the conservative kingdom. The strategy is in line with Prince Mohammed’s efforts to loosen restrictions on entertainment and expressions of popular culture. In developing a tourism industry, officials are focusing on the ancient caravan town of Al Ula in the Hejaz, a western region that has been a crossroads for traders between Mediterranean empires and ports along the Gulf of Aden. “We call this the place of the future,” said Maher Mazan, a manager at Shaden Resort, a new hotel built among rock canyons outside town, where rooms typically go for $440 per night. “If you come back in one year, it’ll be different.” The area’s rich history and archaeological sites have long captivated King Salman, the crown prince’s father. In 2017, the king established the Royal Commission for Al Ula, with the goal of preserving the striking rock archaeology, despite its pre-Islamic origins, and drawing more tourists. The commission also began looking at holding a concert series. The centerpiece of the area is Mada’in Saleh, or Al Hijr, a collection of more than 100 towering tombs carved into hillsides that take on the glow of burnished gold at sunset. This was the southern reach of the realm of the Nabateans, who carved Petra, the famous sandstone city in Jordan. The tombs date back two millenniums, and many Saudis believe them to be cursed, the abode of jinn. Nearby is a preserved station of the defunct Hejaz Railway, an Ottoman-era line built by German and Turkish engineers. By 1908, it ran 800 miles from Damascus to Medina. One afternoon, a guide led a group of foreign visitors by car first to the train station, then to the Nabatean tombs. A guide, Mohammed al-Anzi, said the region had been dominated in ancient times by four different civilizations. Some people had migrated here from Greece, he said, pointing to a carved eagle above a doorway. “Later, the Romans destroyed the Nabateans,” he said. “Civilizations come, civilizations go. This is life, since the beginning of life.” Among the tourists was a Chinese-British couple who gaped at the structures and took photographs and video to post to a Chinese travel website. Walking into one tomb, they asked about three burial niches. Mr. al-Anzi said the custom then was to wrap the dead in animal skins and adorn them with jewelry. Driving out of the area, the tourists noticed abandoned mud-walled homes. “The people were asked to move after this was designated Saudi Arabia’s first World Heritage Site,” Mr. al-Anzi said, referring to a label given by a United Nations agency. The timeless and austere wonders of Mada’in Saleh contrast with the luxury trappings of the music festival, Winter at Tantora. As of early February, at least 30,000 people total had attended the festival’s weekend events, officials said. The festival began Dec. 20 and ends Feb. 23, after being extended two weeks. Hussein Ibish, a scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington, said the entertainment piece of Prince Mohammed’s vision “is very large, and constitutes the revolutionary reintroduction of ‘fun’ to a society in which public entertainments have been basically eliminated for decades.” But because this plan involves exchanges with the West, that creates a conundrum, Mr. Ibish said. “While you are unleashing socially liberalizing and economically modernizing forces that call on, and appeal to, the West — and which must appeal to the West — you’re trying to contain that with a political crackdown that is completely unacceptable and alienating to most Western audiences,” he said. Winter weekends at Al Ula revolve around the concerts, held on Fridays. There are sometimes other notable events, like hot-air balloon rides. The Winter at Tantora website advertises a range of packages for each weekend. All are expensive. For the weekend of the Yanni concert, the prices ranged from $1,400 for a day-trip package (round-trip flight from Jeddah or Riyadh, the capital, included) to $6,000 for a “diamond” weekend package — prohibitive costs for many Saudis. Pop-up restaurants with outdoor seating open among the canyons on weekends. There is a version of Salt, a popular burger restaurant in Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, and Nozomi, a Saudi-run sushi-and-burger restaurant. The visitors sometimes meet local residents of Al Ula in a weekend tourist market, next to the mud homes of the ancient quarter. The festival “has allowed the people of Al Ula to proudly show their home to the world,” said Abdullah al-Khelawi, the royal commission’s head of economic development. He added that the festival provided seasonal work to 1,000 locals. The headquarters of the royal commission, which runs the festival, are in Riyadh, where 100 full-time employees work. “This can start a tourism industry,” said a local driver, Saleh al-Bilawi, 25, who had recently studied criminal justice at an American university. “They employ a lot of drivers just for the winter festival alone.” Mr. al-Bilawi and his colleagues are aware the work is only temporary. Another driver, Faisal, also a university graduate, said he was paid $36 per day and worked only on weekends, but was grateful for the job. The royal commission and the French government have agreed to send 300 to 1,000 local residents to France for training, mostly in the hospitality industry. In September, the first 68 students arrived at Campus France, a French agency, 32 of them women. On Jan. 31, tourists began flying in for the concert by Mr. Bocelli, who was to perform the next night. Most appeared to be wealthy Saudis, although there were some foreign residents of the country, too. The few coming from outside had managed to get tourist visas with the royal commission’s help; Saudi Arabia generally does not give out such visas. A good number of the visitors appeared to be guests of the commission, which was paying their way. An Italian couple sitting in a restaurant at a farm said they had come to Saudi Arabia at the urging of their friend, the Italian ambassador in Riyadh. “We want to see the country before it is affected by the Western world and looks the same as everywhere else,” said Cinzia Chiari, dressed in black robes. “I hope the Saudis realize their treasure and beauty is in its distinct heritage.” "
5cafbd0149f0eacbf1f831dc,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/obituaries/earl-thomas-conley-dead.html,"NASHVILLE — Earl Thomas Conley, one of the most popular and prolific country singers of the 1980s, died here on Wednesday. He was 77. Carole Scates, his partner for more than 20 years, said the cause was cerebral atrophy. Mr. Conley had 24 Top 10 country singles in the ’80s, several of which he wrote or co-wrote, including 18 that reached No. 1. Only two artists that decade topped the country charts more times than he did: the vocal group Alabama, which had 27 No. 1 singles, and the singer Ronnie Milsap, who had 23. All but one of Mr. Conley’s No. 1 hits were recorded for RCA, starting with “Somewhere Between Right and Wrong” in 1982. Many of Mr. Conley’s songs, among them “Holding Her and Loving You” and “Don’t Make It Easy for Me,” both No. 1 hits, plumbed the complexity of romantic relationships. Abounding with sincerity, his rich, smoky baritone was well suited to his material, which appealed primarily to adult audiences, much like the vintage country and soul music of the 1960s and ’70s. Mr. Conley’s affinity for soul music was evident on many of his recordings, maybe nowhere as much as on “Too Many Times,” a 1986 duet with Anita Pointer of the Grammy Award-winning Pointer Sisters. That record reached No. 2 on the country chart and earned Mr. Conley an invitation, rare for a country artist, to perform the song with Ms. Pointer on the R&B-themed television show “Soul Train.” “There was such soul in everything he did,” Joe Galante, who was chief executive of RCA Nashville from 1982 to 1990, said in an interview with The Daily Tennessean. “You always talk about finding something unique,” Mr. Galante continued. “His voice certainly was that.” Mr. Conley placed an average of two singles a year on the country charts in the 1980s, on his way to becoming an inspiration to future country hitmakers like Randy Travis and Blake Shelton. By the early ’90s, with the rise of new stars like Garth Brooks and Shania Twain, sales of Mr. Conley’s records had dropped, and he received less and less airplay, prompting him to take an extended break from touring and recording. He resurfaced again in 1998, and, though he never achieved the kind of success he had in the ’80s, he was active into this decade. Earl Thomas Conley, the third of eight children, was born on Oct. 17, 1941, in Portsmouth, Ohio, a small town across the Ohio River from Kentucky, to Ruth (Davis) and Arthur Conley. When his father lost his job with the railroad, Earl, then 14, moved in with one of his older sisters. He was offered a scholarship to attend art school but opted instead to join the Army, where he first began writing songs and singing in public. After his discharge, Mr. Conley worked for the railroad and in steel mills while traveling to and from Ohio and Nashville to write songs with the producer Dick Heard. Their song “Smokey Mountain Memories” became a Top 40 country hit for the honky-tonk singer Mel Street in 1975. The next year Conway Twitty had a No. 1 country hit with Mr. Conley’s “This Time I’ve Hurt Her More Than She Loves Me.” In 1981, after an unproductive stint recording for Warner Bros. Records, Mr. Conley had his first No. 1 hit, a song he wrote called “Fire & Smoke,” released on the independent Sunbird label. In addition to Ms. Scates, Mr. Conley is survived by his brothers, Fred and Steve; his sisters, Ronda Hodges and Becky Miller; a son, Ty, and a daughter, Amy Edmisten, from his marriage to Sandra Smith, which ended in divorce; two younger daughters, Kat Scates and Erinn Scates; and five grandchildren. A versatile stylist, Mr. Conley was as much at home with the Appalachian music of his childhood as with rock- and soul-inflected arrangements. He recorded tradition-steeped duets with Emmylou Harris (“We Believe in Happy Endings”) and Keith Whitley (“Brotherly Love”). “My stuff started with bluegrass music,” Mr. Conley once explained in an interview. “That’s what inspired me, the people that came out of those hills in West Virginia and Kentucky. And, of course, Hank Williams Sr. down in Alabama. “I was born in ’41, and I was raised up on that early stuff,” he went on. “Coming out of those mountains, there’s a different soul and a different feeling and a whole different deal than what it would be like to come from the city.” "
5c7ce96e49f0eacbf105b315,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/04/arts/music/michael-jackson-leaving-neverland-fans.html,"Beyoncé has the BeyHive and Nicki Minaj the Barbz, fan groups who swarm online against anyone who disparages their idols. The Deadheads may have provided a blueprint, though these days they are more likely to bicker among themselves. But in the age of the 21st-century superfan, perhaps no group is more emphatic, organized and passionate online than the devotees of Michael Jackson, the King of Pop whose legacy includes decades of innuendo and court cases regarding what he did or did not do with young boys. Across blogs, message boards, podcasts, YouTube videos and especially social media feeds, where a Jackson avatar broadcasts one’s allegiance, they circulate exhaustive evidence that they view as exonerating for the singer, while shouting down news outlets they consider inaccurate and biased. Brewing for weeks, their fight kicked into a new gear on Sunday, with the airing of the first half of “Leaving Neverland,” an HBO documentary about two men who say Jackson repeatedly sexually abused them as children. Ads for MJInnocent.com on buses in London and digital billboards in the United States are proclaiming: “Facts Don’t Lie. People Do.” Under the Twitter hashtag #MJFam, dozens of fan accounts have encouraged counterprogramming to the film, instructing followers to stream Jackson’s music instead of watching. And on Sunday night, fans deluged the #LeavingNeverland hashtag with thousands of tweets, dominating discussion of what they called a “mockumentary” and attacking the two men at its center. [Michael Jackson cast a spell. “Leaving Neverland” breaks it, our critic writes.] Dan Reed, the director of “Leaving Neverland,” which concludes on Monday, said that his company had received “dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens” of emails from Jackson fans — “a deluge of hatred” beginning within 20 minutes of the film’s announcement in January. He and the two men in the film, Wade Robson and James Safechuck, said that some fans had taken it even further, with threats of violence. “One can only compare them to religious fanatics, really,” Reed said. “They’re the Islamic State of fandom.” Jackson’s supporters don’t see it that way. Since accusations in 1993 by a boy and his family ended with a $23 million settlement, the fandom’s party line has been that any allegations amounted to extortion plots by hangers-on hellbent on tarnishing Jackson and exploiting his naïveté. A specific strain of the Jackson faithful has pored over the granular details of his life and cases, including the 2005 trial in which he was acquitted of charges he molested another boy, in hopes of proving his innocence. Those fans — including the young and old, from Queensland, Australia to Moscow to Huntsville, Ala. — view “Leaving Neverland” as a manipulative, one-sided hit piece that rehashes old allegations from inconsistent sources. The film has also turned what was for years a niche obsession for many Jackson fans into a mainstream battle. “If you’ve been a fan for a long time, you’ve seen this over and over again,” said Casey Rain, 30, a musician and YouTuber living in Birmingham, England. He called “Leaving Neverland” a “sick attempt at hijacking the Me-Too moment.” Many Jackson fans resort to indiscriminate, anonymous hate mail targeting journalists and Jackson’s accusers. Others like Rain show their devotion in deeper ways, painstakingly constructing videos and epic polemics that weave together court papers and obscure interviews, then sharing and resharing their work across multiple platforms. “There’s nothing about Michael that the fan community doesn’t know,” said Rain, whose blog post about “Leaving Neverland” became a go-to text even before the documentary aired. “I really don’t think that we lack objectivity on him.” (Rain and others who had not yet seen the film said their information came from a few Jackson fans who attended the Sundance premiere and took “very, very detailed notes.”) Susanne Baur and Elena Ovchinnikova, who co-author the blog Vindicating Michael, said they prefer not to be called Jackson fans at all because fan “has a too negative connotation of adoration and worship,” Baur, 60, wrote in an email from southern Germany. Instead they identify as researchers and activists who view Jackson as a civil rights case. In a post about “Leaving Neverland” that totaled more than 10,000 words, Ovchinnikova, who is 65 and based in Moscow, parsed the changing stories of the two men in the film and concluded that they are liars. “The reaction of the M.J. community is absolutely adequate,” Ovchinnikova said via email. “It is the reaction of knowledgeable people who have to talk to ignoramuses.” Linda-Raven Woods, a 56-year-old from Huntsville, called herself a former “die-hard metalhead” whose lingering questions about Jackson’s guilt after his death had led her to fansites. Wowed by the depth of their research, Woods realized, “This is why they defend him so passionately,” she said. She is now an administrator of @MJJLegion, a Twitter account with more than 80,000 followers that has been busy coaching fans on how to counteract the documentary. Some of these supporters acknowledge that the elaborate lengths of their writing and reasoning invites comparisons to conspiracy theorists, or as Damien Shields put it, a “ranting mob.” But Shields, the author of a book on Jackson’s music and a fan for more than two decades, said it is all a matter of perspective: “We also view the media as a ranting mob in some circumstances.” He said that the fans’ support comes from a place of love and passion, comparing those on social media to the Britney Spears fan Chris Crocker, who cried “Leave Britney alone!” in an infamous viral video. “That’s Michael Jackson fans on Twitter times a million,” Shields said. In the cases of Robson and Safechuck, fans note that both had previously testified that Jackson never abused them, and that they later unsuccessfully sued the singer’s estate. (Their claims are now under appeal.) Both men said that it took them years to accept that they were abused and that they had felt pressured to testify on Jackson’s behalf. Reed, the director, said the film was, by design, “about how Wade changed his mind and confronted the truth about what happened to him” — a “radical reassessment of what it all meant.” In an interview, Robson said that he understood the way many still cling to Jackson’s “very particular angelic persona.” He added, “That was so palatable for so many people, including myself.” Robson and Safechuck said they, too, had faced an onslaught since coming forward, with Robson describing “thousands of extremely volatile and nasty emails or social media comments.” They cited the intensity of Jackson’s defenders a possible reason more people don’t come forward. “It’s an extremely terrifying thing to do,” Robson said. As the film’s television premiere approached, some fans struggled with keeping up the fight for Jackson’s reputation as they also girded themselves for the increased scrutiny. While some said they would boycott the film because it does not include outside context or interviews with defenders, others said they would stomach it for the good of the community. “I need to know what we’re up against,” said Woods of @MJJLegion. Shields said he couldn’t help but feel a sense of dread about the coming months: “This literally could be the end of Michael Jackson if — big if — someone in a position of repute doesn’t decide to tell the other side of the story,” he said. In the meantime, it was “almost like therapy” for fans to do their part to push back on the claims. “Even if their part doesn’t actually make any impact,” he said, “at least they tried their best.” "
5c832e7b49f0eacbf105c2c8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/arts/television/r-kelly-gayle-king-interview-cbs.html,"“Is this camera on me?” R. Kelly’s line, in the midst of his 80-minute interview with CBS’s Gayle King about his charges of sexual abuse, was the opening lyric of one of the most bizarre and unhinged performances of the R&B singer’s career. He shrieked into the camera: “You’re killing me, man!” He smacked his fist into his palm. He beat his chest. He paced and stabbed the air and seemed as if he might lose physical control. (Ms. King later said that she didn’t worry that the singer would harm her, but she thought that “I might get accidentally clobbered.”) He kept on rambling even as his handlers tried to soothe him and reapplied his makeup, as if administering to a boxer between rounds. The obvious question, after Mr. Kelly’s Tuesday meltdown replayed for days, finally becoming a CBS prime time special Friday night, was: Why would he agree to this? How could he imagine this might possibly help him? But you can infer the motivation from that “Is this camera on me?” Whether consciously or by habit, Mr. Kelly saw the chance to turn an interview into a solo show. Earlier this year, the Lifetime docu-series “Surviving R. Kelly,” which laid out an extensive case that Mr. Kelly preyed upon women and underage girls, showed how he used the intimate investment of fandom to escape consequences. (Mr. Kelly has denied all sexual abuse allegations.) [Read more: R. Kelly, Michael Jackson and the Lingering Questions About Child Sex Abuse Cases] There was an audience out there — fans who had heard his songs at weddings and graduations — and if he could summon up a barnburner of emotion, maybe he could get the crowd on his side one more time. He believed he could flee. But a network-TV interview while you’re facing criminal charges is not the same as performing a tribute ballad at Whitney Houston’s funeral. (Last month in Chicago Mr. Kelly was charged with 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse; he has pleaded not guilty.) The raging, self-pitying R. Kelly on this stage only recalled the threatening, controlling R. Kelly described in “Surviving,” which CBS’s special drew heavily on (including an interview with its producer Dream Hampton). Mr. Kelly’s breakdown got most of the attention, but we shouldn’t overlook what Ms. King did. Rather than match his volume, she addressed Mr. Kelly, whose first name is Robert, calmly and firmly, the way you would a tantrum: “Robert. Robert.” Just as important, she recognized that Mr. Kelly was trying to use the interview to claim a soapbox. “Robert, we have to have a conversation,” she said, as he continued to hold forth, looking past her into the lens. “I don’t want you just ranting at the camera.” Her impassive body language said it all. She was not going to engage on his level; he would have to come to hers. She was not going to indulge another man talking over and around and to the side of her, trying to shout and aggress and ugly-cry his way out of trouble. The editing of the segment underscored her point, cutting to a longer-range side view to deny Mr. Kelly the direct-to-camera soliloquy he was trying to have. The image of him, shot from a low angle, aggrieved and slashing the air, revealed Mr. Kelly’s desperate isolation like a portrait tableau. Friday’s special didn’t reveal new moments from the interview as stunning as the ones already replayed all week. (In one new clip, Mr. Kelly explained his visit to McDonald’s after posting bail, offering perhaps the least-wanted endorsement in America: “When it comes to McDonald’s that M stands for Mom.”) It also excerpted Ms. King’s earlier interview with two women, Azriel Clary and Joycelyn Savage, who denied that Mr. Kelly was keeping them captive in his home — though, as Ms. King noted, Mr. Kelly was present for the entire interview, coughing loudly and making his presence known. Maybe more valuable, the special provided context for the viral clips: the history of the abuse and “sex cult” charges against Mr. Kelly; interviews with accusers and their family members; background from experts and the Chicago music journalist Jim DeRogatis, who pursued the case for two decades. These sections, as “Surviving” did at greater length, got at the question of how an accused abuser could escape consequences for so long. But you could also look to Mr. Kelly’s all-too-familiar responses in the interview. The multiple, detailed accusations, he said, were “rumor,” the women were “lying” and “scorned.” His fury may have been jaw-dropping — but all this had worked for him, and other men, before. Last fall, his future clouded by a sexual assault charge, Brett M. Kavanaugh roared his way onto the Supreme Court on national TV. The face-off between the wrathful Mr. Kelly and the stoic Ms. King was a clash of temperaments. But it was also a collision of eras: the moment of the reckoning coming face-to-face with decades of impunity. At one point, Mr. Kelly asked about his accusers, “Why now?” “Because we’re in a different time where women are speaking out,” Ms. King said. The times may have caught up with R. Kelly. Maybe his loss of control was a recognition of that. But at other times, he spoke like he believed he had history on his side. “I guarantee you,” he told Ms. King, “that I’m going to come out of this like I did before.” "

5c3e34bc3a125f5075c048cc,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/15/arts/music/winter-jazzfest.html,"The NYC Winter Jazzfest is 15 years old, which is apparently enough time to develop its own version of “the old days.” This year it stretched on for nine days, with concert marathons on consecutive weekends and marquee concerts sandwiched in between. Of all this, the best part might have been the evening most reminiscent of what the festival had been like five or 10 years ago. It was the Half Marathon on the event’s first Saturday, an extra night of shows organizers added to stay aligned with the Association of Performing Arts Presenters convention, using just six clubs across Lower Manhattan. (The following weekend, a more typical, two-day Marathon took over 11 spaces each night.) Fewer people came, so lines were shorter, and rooms were full but not crammed. Almost all the venues were easily walkable from each other, and it felt less like an opportunity to harvest information and more like a chance to sit with the music. In improvised music there’s hardly the risk of repeating oneself, and one of the best things about Winter Jazzfest is running across the same artist in multiple contexts in a given night. During the Half Marathon, Joel Ross led a quintet at Subculture, perhaps the festival’s finest listening venue, a small underground theater with good sound and plenty of room to move around. Mr. Ross, 23, is the player to watch in New York this year: a vibraphonist who unites a lot of the instrument’s jazz history — from Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia and New York — and understands the vibes as a possible connector between hip-hop and West African music. But he hasn’t totally cracked the code as a bandleader, a role that upstart musicians these days are expected to fill. His serviceable set of neatly sculpted originals only really took off near the end, when the young alto saxophonist Immanuel Wilkins, his frequent collaborator, assumed the lead on Mr. Ross’s ballad “Touched by an Angel.” Reflecting the pinched sound of Oliver Lake and the pith of Jackie McLean, Mr. Wilkins allowed the melody to teeter and crash, making his feelings known without overstatement. Mr. Ross was among the most-hired players at the festival, and it was as a side musician that he shone most brightly. Later that evening, on the drummer and producer Kassa Overall’s set at Nublu, he locked into the slinky groove of “Layin’ with the Swami,” throwing things off every few cycles with a squib outside the scale. Mr. Ross was the M.V.P. sideman in this quartet, but really the honor belonged to him and Brandee Younger in tandem; her harp joined up with his vibraphone to create a single unit, woven and resounding. (They’ve done this before.) Mr. Overall was recreating the lighthearted but heavy-grooving vibe of the Blue After Dark jam sessions at Zinc Bar, which he hosted until recently on behalf of Revive Music (he left to begin a new residency at the Jazz Gallery). The vocalist and multimedia performer Melanie Charles will take over from Mr. Overall, later this month, and on Friday, during the full marathon, she performed at Mercury Lounge, where Revive curated a stage. Ms. Charles sang original music, sometimes from behind a deck of electronics, making a kind of astro-hydraulic pastiches in both Haitian Creole and English. Videos projected onto a screen behind her showed grass and city scenes, and when she cued a sample from Aretha Franklin’s “Day Dreaming,” the iconic singer’s image appeared onscreen. It’s a tough song to cover, but Ms. Charles’s band mostly got it (Revive’s other stage, at the Bowery Ballroom, hosted a less successful closing jam session on Saturday, full of special guests like Thundercat and Bilal but frustratingly orchestrated by the drummer Chris Dave, who could never seem to get satisfied with his sound team or his band.) Vocalists at the edges of jazz, R&B and spoken word were a recurring theme throughout both weekends. At the Half Marathon, this year’s artist in residence, Meshell Ndegeocello — who performed in different configurations throughout the festival — presented a program titled “No More Water, the Fire Next Time,” with a midsize band holding down slow grooves, and the poet Staceyann Chin reading acid verses. Quoting James Baldwin and telling of her own childhood in Brooklyn, she sped past outrage and sorrow, getting straight to a sense of conviction. During the Saturday of the full marathon, the singer Georgia Anne Muldrow joined the drummer Justin Brown’s band, Nyeusi. She delivered lines of homely inspiration, sometimes in a casual repartee, elsewhere in a wail. “All this colonization in your brain, you gotta empty it out for the real thing to come in,” she said. Behind her, Nyeusi ditched the wavy, synth-driven sound of its 2018 album, embracing something crunchier, more savory. Some of the full weekend’s purest energy was on display at the SoHo Playhouse, a rustic little theater on Vandam Street. There the booking outfit Search and Restore — which has been involved in the festival for about a decade — secured a constant flow of boldly inventive musicians across two nights. Many of them, like the bass clarinetist Lea Bertucci and the trumpeter Steph Richards, were horn players testing the limits of their instruments — and their listeners. In duo with the drummer Gerald Cleaver on Friday night, the tenor saxophonist Travis Laplante used circular breathing to play repetitive, slowly morphing patterns that were both startling and hypnotic. Your ear echoed differently with every note, so that you ended up experiencing each cluster as a prism of many resonances, more than as a melody or a rhythm. What’s new in jazz doesn’t always equate to youth, or even any clear stylistic break. At Subculture on Saturday, the tenor saxophonist J.D. Allen, 46, working with a still-new trio, welcomed David Murray, a stalwart saxophonist one generation Mr. Allen’s senior. As they played Mr. Allen’s stern but flexible original tunes, there was a vast difference in their approaches, but they traded ideas easily. The younger player often worked in long and heavy tones, related to John Coltrane; even his quickest lines had a wary darkness. Mr. Murray used a higher center of gravity, often vaulting from cool swing to fish-at-the-end-of-the-line agitation. On the punchy “Graffiti,” Murray chewed on his horn, softening the rhythm, and Nic Caccioppo’s drums ended up in an open tumble. During the second weekend, Nublu’s stage was given over to International Anthem, a four-year-old independent label in Chicago that is already having an outsize influence on creative music. On Friday at 11:30, I knew I should be seeing what all the fuss was about with Louis Cole, a wunderkind YouTube sensation whose jazz-infused, fratty IDM is starting to give Snarky Puppy a run for its money. He was playing at the Sheen Center, a theater across from Subculture. Instead, I stood in the front row for all of Ben LaMar Gay’s riveting set — a tangle of samba, blues and math-rock, bouncing from Bubber Miley to Animal Collective — and then stuck around for Joshua Abrams and Natural Information Society, a sextet featuring the bandleader on guimbri, Lisa Alvarado pulling chords out of a sighing harmonium, and Jason Stein playing sharply cut patterns on the bass clarinet. Mr. Stein’s funny shapes jutted up against the group’s circular, silt-over-rock flow, creating good tension. Mr. Abrams has been making Afrocentric, droning free jazz like this for a long time. In recent years, that kind of thing has become more commonplace on the avant-garde. Still, even if it didn’t reveal any blazing new truths, Mr. Abrams makes affecting music; I was glad to have stayed put and taken it in. "
5c9c007549f0eacbf105f6b2,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/27/obituaries/ranking-roger-dead.html,"Ranking Roger, a vocalist for the popular British ska band the Beat in the late 1970s and early ’80s who carried on that group’s infectious sound in subsequent bands and solo projects, died on Tuesday in Birmingham, England. He was 56. An announcement on his current group’s website said he had received a cancer diagnosis last year. Ranking Roger, whose real name was Roger Charlery, was one of two frontmen for the Beat, along with Dave Wakeling. The group, which was known as the English Beat in the United States to avoid confusion with a California power-pop band of the same name, had a brief but influential run after its founding in 1978, expanding on the ska sound, a lively precursor to reggae that had first migrated to England from Jamaica in the 1960s. “Ska is their base,” The Boston Globe wrote of the Beat in 1981, “but it’s infused with satisfying pressure-cooker-like tension and cut with reggae, pop and soul elements.” Neil Strauss, looking back on the group’s heyday in a 1995 article in The New York Times, described the Beat’s sound as “Jamaican ska informed by punk rock.” Mr. Charlery, who was black, and Mr. Wakeling, who is white, complemented each other: Mr. Wakeling was a more traditional vocalist, while Mr. Charlery “toasted,” the Jamaican version of rapping. The Beat’s best-known songs include a jaunty 1979 cover of “The Tears of a Clown,” which had been a hit for Smokey Robinson and the Miracles, and “Mirror in the Bathroom,” their biggest hit, which reached No. 4 in Britain in 1980. Some of the Beat’s songs had a political edge, notably “Stand Down Margaret,” a critique of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and her Conservative Party policies. “I said I see no joy, I see only sorrow,” the two vocalists sang. “I see no chance of your bright new tomorrow. So stand down Margaret.” But in a 1988 interview with The Globe (Mrs. Thatcher was still prime minister, and would remain in office until 1990), Mr. Charlery expressed some disillusionment about the power of music. “I sang ‘Stand Down Margaret’ for five years and no one listened,” he said. “She got in, and she got in again, and she’ll probably get in again. It goes to show how blind people are. Basically, I don’t think people ever listen.” After the Beat broke up in 1983, Mr. Charlery and Mr. Wakeling formed a new group, General Public. It broke up three years later, but the two men got back together for some shows in 1995. “Goodbye, Rog,” Mr. Wakeling posted on Facebook. “Thanks for all the fabulous years and wonderful memories.” Mr. Charlery was born on Feb. 21, 1963, in Birmingham to Jean Baptiste and Anne Marie Charlery, who were from St. Lucia in the Caribbean. He grew up in Birmingham and nearby Stechford and attended Tile Cross Academy. “My parents expected me to go into a factory,” he told The Birmingham Mail in 2016, when he released a new album, “Bounce,” as the Beat Featuring Ranking Roger. “I didn’t see that. I wanted to be a mechanic or a carpenter if anything.” His parents were destined to be disappointed. “Mum, Anne Marie, cried when I was on ‘Top of the Pops,’ ” he said, referring to the British television show, “and I knew I had done something right.” The Beat was born in part out of frustration with the conservative turn in England’s politics. “To the English Beat,” Robert Palmer wrote in reviewing the group’s second album, “Wha’ppen?,” in The Times, “unemployment, ecology and the antinuclear movement are not separate issues; they are interrelated.” “Anyone who would like to understand more about the attitudes underlying Britain’s inner-city rioting,” he added, “would do well to start here.” Mr. Charlery’s survivors include his partner, Pauline; five children, Matthew, Leon, Reuben, Luci and Saffren; and four sisters. In later years Mr. Charlery recorded and performed on his own and with variously named groups, among them Special Beat. (Mr. Wakeling had his own Beat-related group.) His most recent album, “Public Confidential,” again as the Beat Featuring Ranking Roger, was released this year. Another incarnation, in 2007, was the New English Beat, which included Ranking Junior, his son. In an interview with The Bristol Post of England that year, Mr. Charlery spoke of why he thought his music seemed to have a cross-generational, cross-racial appeal. “When the Beat were originally going ’round,” he said, “our audiences were so mixed — black, white and Indian, young people and older heads. It was brilliant, and I think we have kind of achieved that today. It is a bit different, obviously, but it is a very friendly crowd and everyone walks out sweating and happy, and I tell myself that’s the most I could ask for.” "
5c6e91bb3a125f5075c0ac68,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/arts/music/webster-hall-reopening.html,"When the doors open in April at the renovated Webster Hall — the East Village club, once known as the Ritz, that was renowned for its mix of rock shows and raucous dance parties — music fans will find a revamped entryway and lounge, new bathrooms and upgraded acoustics. But the most important change may simply be the arrival of an elevator. Webster Hall, housed in an 1886 building, part of which has been declared a landmark, is a rabbit warren of staircases and anterooms that surround a grand ballroom. But without an elevator, handicapped patrons had to be carried inside and loading equipment was a daily ordeal. “On a regular tour, whatever city they were in, they’d have two or four loaders,” said Jim Glancy of the concert promotion company the Bowery Presents, which is one of the new owners. “At Webster Hall, the minimum would be 12 people.” The new elevator is one of a number of subtle changes meant to bring the club, just off Union Square, up to contemporary standards, reintroducing it to fans and to an industry that has been hungry for a room of its size — the ballroom holds 1,400 people — in a central part of Manhattan. “This room has been needed — we felt its absence,” said Marty Diamond of Paradigm Talent Agency, who booked the club in its 1980s iteration as the Ritz. After an opening night in late April, to be announced, the initial lineup will include Patti Smith on May 1; the D.J. TroyBoi on May 3; Sharon Van Etten on May 4; Broken Social Scene on May 16 and 17; and MGMT from May 22 to 24. Webster Hall, long an independently owned space, was bought two years ago by BSE Global, the parent company of Barclays Center, and the Bowery Presents, which is partly owned by the concert giant AEG, for a price estimated at about $35 million. When the club shut down in August 2017 for renovations, there was an outcry from fans who worried that Webster Hall’s history as a dance mecca and a center of gay night life in New York would be lost. The new owners say they are committed to preserving that tradition, but are still deciding how. “It was a very democratic club that was all about variety, and we intend to bring that variety back when we reopen,” said Keith Sheldon, BSE Global’s executive vice president of programming. On a recent tour of the space, construction was still in full swing, with saws buzzing and workmen lugging armloads of wood. But the changes to the club’s design were clear. Three doors were added to its entrance on East 11th Street — a concession by the Landmarks Preservation Commission — to get people in and out more quickly. On the first floor, the Marlin Room, a former venue-within-a-venue, has been turned into a sleek lounge. Upstairs in the ballroom, acoustic treatments have been added to the walls and ceiling, and some remnants of the dance-party past have been removed, like a monstrous lighting rig that John Moore, one of the Bowery Presents principals, likened to Battlestar Galactica. “It would come down, it would move around; it was very ’80s,” Mr. Moore said, adding that it would be replaced with a more conventional mirror ball. But much of the idiosyncratic grandeur of the room was untouched, like its scalloped balconies, Art Deco wall designs and, above the stage, an old canvas painting of falling balloons. “The vision has always been to maintain the soul, the grit, the history of the venue,” said Brett Yormark, the chief executive of BSE Global. “For fans, they are going to feel like they’re coming home again.” The preserved details are reminders of the remarkable history of Webster Hall, which started as a community social club but, by Prohibition, became known for wild parties. In 1953, it was bought by RCA, which used it as a recording studio for Harry Belafonte, Perry Como and classical giants like Sviatoslav Richter. When the Ritz opened in 1980, it became a center for new wave music, hosting the American debuts of bands like U2 and Depeche Mode. In 1989, the Ritz moved to the former Studio 54 space on West 54th Street, and in 1992, under the new ownership of the Ballinger family, Webster Hall reopened as a club under its own name. When the new partners bought the club, Jay Marciano, the chairman of AEG Presents, the company’s music division, said he expected renovations to cost $10 million. In an interview this week, he laughed at that estimate. “I won’t give a specific number, but it was a multiple of that,” Mr. Marciano said. “Nothing gets done cheaply in New York City.” "
5c70a8ac3a125f5075c0b1f7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/22/obituaries/jackie-shane-dead.html,"Jackie Shane, a black transgender soul singer who packed nightclubs in 1960s Toronto before she stepped out of the spotlight for decades, only to re-emerge with a Grammy-nominated record in her 70s, has died. She was 78. Her death was confirmed by Douglas Mcgowan, her producer and friend. He said her body was found at her home in Nashville on Thursday. He said he did not know when she had died or the cause. Almost five decades passed between Ms. Shane’s 1960s career in Canada and her 2018 Grammy nomination for best historical album, for “Any Other Way.” The record introduced her to a new generation of fans, and today her face is part of a towering mural in downtown Toronto. “I do believe that it’s like destiny,” Ms. Shane told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation this month. “I really feel that I have made a place for myself with wonderful people. What I have said, what I have done, they say it makes their lives better.” Jackie Shane was born in Nashville on May 15, 1940, and grew up as a black transgender child in the Jim Crow South. But she made her name after she moved to Toronto around 1959, becoming a force in its music scene and packing its nightclubs. She scored the No. 2 spot on the Canadian singles chart in 1963 with her silky cover of William Bell’s “Any Other Way.” The song is about putting on a brave face for the friend of an ex-girlfriend, but Ms. Shane gave it a subversive twist when she sang, “Tell her that I’m happy, tell her that I’m gay.” Ms. Shane said she identified as female from the age of 13, but throughout her 1960s career she was publicly referred to as a man. Speaking to The New York Times in 2017, she said she sometimes described herself to peers as gay. “I was just being me,” she said. “I never tried to explain myself to anyone — they never explained themselves to me.” As a child, she said, her unabashed femininity and unwavering self-confidence turned heads. In 2017, she told The Times about a grade school bully who unwisely threw a stone at her. The rock hit her, and the bully’s fate was sealed. “He wanted to torment me and I would never allow that,” Ms. Shane said. She picked up a jump rope and whipped the boy with it. When a teacher tried to separate them, she hit the teacher, too. Ms. Shane told the CBC  this month that she had moved to Canada after witnessing a group of white men attacking a black man one night in Nashville. “One cannot choose where one is born,’’ she said, “but you can choose your home.” In Canada, Ms. Shane mingled with music royalty, sharing a stage with Etta James, Jackie Wilson and the Impressions and other stars. But in 1971 she abruptly left it all behind. In the following decades she became a cult heroine and a legend online, where fans speculated about where she had gone. The answer, it turned out, was Los Angeles. She told The Times in 2017 that she had left Toronto to be with her mother, Jessie Shane, who was living alone after the death of Ms. Shane’s stepfather in 1963. Ms. Shane may have been a star in Canada, but it didn’t feel right to her, she said, that her mother was living by herself so far away. So she went to live with her in Los Angeles, and they later moved back to Nashville, where her mother died in 1997. Mr. Mcgowan said on Thursday that Ms. Shane had no immediate survivors. After her mother died, Ms. Shane lived an intensely private life. She watched old movies and network dramas, ordered takeout and ventured outside only every once in a while. When she did, she wore a hat and dark glasses lest she be recognized. Ms. Shane watched history march on from the comfort of relative anonymity. In her interview with The Times, she shared her thoughts on the legalization of same-sex marriage (“We’ve had to fight for everything that should have already been on the table”) and shook her head at the state of pop music (“I’m going to have to school these people again”). One thing Ms. Shane did not do during her decade of Canadian stardom was record a studio album. That changed in 2017, when the Chicago-based label Numero Group released her anthology, which was later nominated for a Grammy Award. Ms. Shane shared her life philosophy with the CBC this month. “Most people are planted in someone else’s soil, which means they’re a carbon copy,” she said. “I say to them: ‘Uproot yourself. Get into your own soil. You may be surprised who you really are.’ ” "
5c7417573a125f5075c0b6d8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/25/arts/music/r-kelly-plea-not-guilty.html,"The R&B singer R. Kelly was released from a Chicago jail Monday, three days after he surrendered to face 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse. Mr. Kelly’s bond had been set at $1 million. According to Cook County jail records, a woman who described herself as a friend from the Chicago area paid $100,000, the standard 10 percent bail fee, to secure his release. Mr. Kelly walked through the jail gates around 5:30 p.m. local time, then moved slowly through a scrum of waiting reporters as a fan nearby yelled “Free R. Kelly!” He was driven away in a black Mercedes van, trailed by a news helicopter. Earlier on Monday, Mr. Kelly appeared in Cook County criminal court in an orange prison jumpsuit with “DOC” printed on the back, and pleaded not guilty to the charges. His lawyer, Steven Greenberg, asked the judge whether his client would have to settle child support payments he owes to post bond, or if the $100,000 would suffice. Judge Lawrence E. Flood said Mr. Kelly only needed $100,000. Prosecutors in Chicago say they have identified four victims, including one teenage autograph seeker whom they say Mr. Kelly had sex with for months beginning when she was 16 years old. Another was a girl he met at a restaurant, at her 16th birthday celebration. A third was a 24-year-old hairdresser of his, who told prosecutors that Mr. Kelly tried to force her to perform oral sex on him. Court documents said she reported that incident to law enforcement officials within two years of when it occurred and handed over a shirt she was wearing that day, which DNA analysis showed had his semen on it. It was not clear why Mr. Kelly was not charged in connection with this at the time. Mr. Greenberg has said it may have been a consensual encounter. [Read more about the case here.] For years, Mr. Kelly, whose real name is Robert Kelly, seemed largely immune to accusations that he sexually abused minors and kept women in a cultlike environment, shielded by a series of nondisclosure agreements. But his behavior came under renewed scrutiny in January after the documentary “Surviving R. Kelly,” which chronicled the allegations against him, aired on Lifetime. He was arrested in 2002 on child pornography charges stemming from a tape that prosecutors said showed him having sex with and urinating on an underage girl. But in 2008, he was acquitted on all counts after the girl prosecutors said was in the tape refused to testify. That same girl is now the fourth victim cited by prosecutors. They also have said that they have a different tape of Mr. Kelly and the girl having sex, and Michael Avenatti, the celebrity lawyer who gave the video to law enforcement, has said that it is a recording of a different incident than the earlier tape, which removes any concern about double jeopardy. Mr. Avenatti said on Monday that he had obtained a second video of Mr. Kelly that showed him having sex with an underage girl. He said he gave the 55-minute-long tape to prosecutors, and that the girl in the video was one of the victims Mr. Kelly had already been charged with abusing. In this tape, he said, Mr. Kelly “refers to the victim having a 14-year-old body part, a vagina.” Mr. Kelly’s next court date will be March 22. "
5cb441e849f0eacbf1f8419c,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/15/world/asia/indonesia-election-islam.html,"JAKARTA, Indonesia — Joko Widodo, the Muslim president of Indonesia, is into heavy metal and saving Christians. Earlier in his political career, he helped shelter ethnic Chinese Christians during deadly rioting. And upon winning the presidency in 2014, Mr. Joko filled his cabinet with women and banned a radical Islamic group that calls for Islamic law to replace Indonesia’s democracy. His election was seen as a victory for the moderate Islam that has long flourished in this country. But this time around, as he runs for re-election on Wednesday against a pugnacious former general who has embraced the language of hard-line, Middle Eastern Islam, Mr. Joko is veering rightward. At a Saturday campaign rally, he pointedly gave thanks to Muslim preachers, and on Sunday he visited Mecca. For his vice-presidential running mate, Mr. Joko chose Ma’ruf Amin, the 76-year-old head of the Indonesian Ulema Council, which has issued fatwas against homosexuality and the wearing of Santa hats by Muslims. No hip-gyrating traditional dancing, no premarital sex and certainly no headbanging heavy metal allowed. Nearly 5,000 miles from the birthplace of Islam, Indonesia, the nation with the world’s largest Muslim population, has been widely seen as proof that Islam and democracy can coexist and prosper. “Indonesia is a country with more than 260 million people, with a geographical area of at least 17,000 islands,” Lukman Hakim Saifuddin, Indonesia’s minister of religious affairs, said in an interview. “People still treasure and respect the diversity, the differences.” Yet as the Muslim world has wrestled with Islam’s role in modern society, Indonesia, too, has engaged in a national spiritual reckoning. In recent years, the country’s Muslim majority has embraced more overt signs of religiosity and shifted toward Arab-style devotion: flowing clothes and veils, Arabic names and Middle Eastern devotional architecture. Most of all, a puritanical Salafist interpretation of Islam, which draws inspiration from the age of the Prophet Muhammad, is attracting followers in Indonesia. Bureaucrats steeped in austere Wahhabism draw converts in government prayer halls. Hundreds of Indonesians joined the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, and hundreds of thousands more cheer for the group on social media. Pushed aside are the syncretic traditions that were long the hallmark of Indonesian Islam, a blending with indigenous beliefs that gave the faith its distinct local flavor. “In Indonesia, Salafi ideology has penetrated urban and rural, civil servants and villagers,” said Din Wahid, a theologian at Syarif Hidayatullah State Islamic University. “They see corruption all around them and say that it is only Shariah and restoring a caliphate that will be able to fix society.” Mr. Joko’s opponent in the election on Wednesday, Prabowo Subianto — the European-educated son of a Christian and a connoisseur of fine wines — may seem an unlikely figurehead for hard-line Islam. But he is an astute politician who has shouted for jihad and vowed to welcome home from self-imposed exile Rizieq Shihab, the head of the Islamic Defenders Front, which gained notoriety for attacking nightclubs in Jakarta, the capital, and calling for Shariah law. “Political Islam has strengthened tremendously over the last two decades in Indonesia,” said Andreas Harsono, an Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch and author of the new book “Race, Islam and Power.” “We should be very concerned, because both sides in the campaign have now made human rights and democracy decline.” Faith politics exploded in late 2016 when millions of Indonesians marched in the streets of Jakarta to protest what they considered blasphemous language from Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, a Christian who was then the Jakarta governor. Mr. Ma’ruf, Mr. Joko’s surprising choice of running mate this year, was one of the drivers of those protests. Mr. Basuki, widely known as Ahok, was jailed for 20 months. Mr. Joko declined to defend his former deputy. “Ahok’s downfall was because of populism, like Trump or Brexit,” said Zuhairi Misrawi, a researcher for Nahdlatul Ulama, the world’s largest Islamic social organization, which promotes moderate Islam. “Now, political parties are aiming to get more votes by showing how Islamic they are, and it is changing our Indonesian political identity.” Even Mr. Lukman, the religious affairs minister under Mr. Joko, tries to thread the needle on the role of faith in Indonesian society. “Indonesia is not officially an Islamic state,” he said, sitting in an office decorated solely with Muslim art. “But Indonesia is also not a secular state.” Islam arrived in Indonesia through Arab and Indian merchants. By the 16th century, the faith had displaced or cross-pollinated with Buddhism, Hinduism and animist faiths. Most Muslims here still practice a fusion form of the faith. Traditional Indonesian mosques had thatched or pitched roofs, reminiscent of Hindu temples. Indonesian Muslim festivals feature offerings of flowers to volcanoes. The national dress for women includes a lacy, body-hugging blouse. Beginning in the 1980s, Saudi money began changing the look of Islam in Indonesia. Open-air mosques were replaced by marble, domed edifices. Today, thousands of mosques around the country bear Middle Eastern motifs attesting to their Saudi, Qatari or Kuwaiti funding. Perhaps the most influential Saudi investment in Indonesia is the Institute for the Study of Islam and Arabic, known by the Indonesian acronym, Lipia, where classes are segregated by gender and teach the fundamentalist Wahhabi theology that dominates in Saudi Arabia. “Even though Indonesian Islam is a syncretic, cultural Islam, we are taught that anything from Saudi, the country of Mecca and Medina, must be authentic and good,” said Ulil Abshar Abdalla, the coordinator of the Liberal Islam Network, who studied at Lipia. The university has produced some of Indonesia’s most renowned Islamic scholars. But it has also nurtured militants linked to terrorist attacks across Southeast Asia. Over the past two years, Lipia has expanded across the country, opening at least three new campuses in a country with a shortage of universities. Mainstream Indonesian Muslim leaders resent the inroads that Saudi-inspired Salafism has made here. “Wahhabism is against our culture, and our religion is totally different from the Middle East,” said Mr. Zuhairi of Nahdlatul Ulama, who is helping set up an online presence to compete against the puritanical websites popular with young Indonesians. “Our war is to get moderate Islam to fight for millennial Muslims who are hungry for Islam,” he said. “But people don’t see us as passionate, as charismatic. It’s hard to change this.” The flowering of a more conservative Islam in Indonesia accelerated after the overthrow of Suharto in 1998, after more than three decades of corrupt, dictatorial rule. What followed was a federalist exuberance that gave local governments newfound authority. The province of Aceh, for example, is now under Shariah, with public flogging for adulterers or those who drink alcohol. “Salafism is a magnet for people because it’s very simple and easy to understand,” said Mr. Ulil of the Liberal Islam Network. “It gives the impression that it’s based on prophetic, pure scripture while others, like us, are not authoritative.” When Zaenal Abidin started building a Salafist community on the outskirts of Jakarta in 1998, three families joined him. Now there are 300, many of them middle-class government employees, who send their children to Mr. Zaenal’s Islamic school. “We were colonized for so long by Christians, so we have an inferiority complex,” he said. “But this is a country with the world’s largest number of Muslims, so we must show our true Islamic nature.” As it has elsewhere in the Muslim world, conservative dress has become more common in Indonesia. Polygamy and child marriage are also on the rise here, as democracy has allowed personal freedoms repressed during the Suharto era to prosper. “Radical groups understand that they can use democracy to their advantage,” said Musdah Mulia, a professor of Islamic political thought at Syarif Hidayatullah State Islamic University. “They say that democracy is bad because it allows infidels to have a vote, but then they manipulate it for themselves.” "
5ca4f29849f0eacbf1f80a53,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/03/arts/music/public-records-gowanus-music-scene.html,"On the second floor of a stately brick building across the street from the Gowanus Canal, an electrical wire dangled over a dusty desk on a recent Monday afternoon, and the sounds of light construction drifted through an open doorway. Until last year, this rather remote building had been home to Retrofret, a niche guitar repair shop. But now it was just weeks away from becoming Public Records, a state-of-the-art music venue and watering hole that hopes to become a beacon for a neighborhood in flux. The club’s three youngish partners — Francis Harris, Shane Davis and Erik VanderWal — sat around the desk along with the saxophonist Rob Reddy, who will be booking an ongoing weekly jazz series there, and explained their idea. During the day, Public Records will serve as a vegan cafe, and at night as a bar. On weekends and many weeknights, the back room will host concerts. The audio systems throughout the space will be profoundly high-fidelity, and at the bar a different record collector will spin vinyl each evening. “We want to be a community-based performance space that supports avant-garde or experimental music, while at the same time feels like a neighborhood spot,” said Mr. Harris, the member of the triumvirate in charge of all things musical. Public Records is perched at the northern tip of Gowanus, a postindustrial neighborhood of warehouses and former factories along the edge of the East River, hidden away between the tonier Park Slope and Carroll Gardens. Gowanus has long been hospitable to small manufacturing businesses and artists seeking affordable studio space, but it tends to clear out at night. Club owners prize the cheap rent, but often have trouble drawing a crowd for gigs. “There’s not a built-in audience. You have to bring your own crowd,” said the trombonist and pianist Brian Drye, who runs iBeam, a cooperative studio and performance space about 10 blocks south of Public Records. “Generally what works best here is music that has smaller audiences, and requires an attentive listening crowd.” Still, a small syndicate of offbeat stages has sprouted up across the neighborhood in the last decade, helping to fill a vacuum left by the disappearance of experimental music clubs in the Lower East Side and the East Village. (Tonic and Fez closed in the early 2000s, and the Knitting Factory eventually decamped to a smaller space in Williamsburg. The Stone left last year to be absorbed into the New School.) iBeam is run by the roughly two-dozen musicians who use it to rehearse and teach. Mr. Drye started the club 11 years ago when an adult student offered to rent him an empty space that he owned on Seventh Street, just a half block off the canal. (A similar institution, the Douglas Street Music Collective, also run by jazz musicians, sprang up soon after but eventually closed down.) On weekday evenings, members of the iBeam cooperative present their own music there; on weekends, Drye books other acts — typically a mix of outré improvisers and young composers looking to showcase new work. In 2012, the bassist Matthew Garrison and the entrepreneur Fortuna Sung opened ShapeShifter Lab around the corner from iBeam. It was founded as a music club, but attendance was not strong enough for it to survive on shows alone. So Ms. Sung and Mr. Garrison have turned it into a flexible event space and recording studio. As the neighborhood around it has gradually grown more residential, it has begun to host weddings, bar mitzvahs and student recitals as well as regular concerts: “Shape-shifting with the hood,” Mr. Garrison said in a recent interview. The shifts have been slow, partly thanks to zoning laws, which have warded off rapid real-estate development while keeping the area friendly to the small businesses that use it for storage and light manufacturing. As a result, while many artists have work spaces in Gowanus, few actually live there. But with Public Records open, the area may start to have more of a nighttime ecosystem. In nearby Red Hook, Pioneer Works has become one of New York’s essential multi-arts spaces, and in Park Slope, just three avenues over from iBeam, Barbés is one of Brooklyn’s most creatively curated pint-size music rooms. Public Records will have a different feel from all these places. Its team is devoted to craft comforts: The space has high-flown ceilings and elegant, exposed concrete. Walls are lined with wood panels to help improve the acoustics. The food will all come from Henry Rich, the local restaurateur behind Rucola, who will run a commissary kitchen in the building. And the team is also devoted to flexibility. Mr. Harris imagines that Mr. Reddy’s Wednesday-night jazz series — which will be in the barroom, rather than the back — might open the door to more spontaneous musical happenings throughout the week. “Our hopes were to create an environment where great players can drop in and do a set,” Mr. Harris said. Public Records’ early bookings for performances in the main space include Damo Suzuki, the Japanese musician known for his stint singing with Can; the ambient-music giant Laraaji; and the minimalist techno artist Jan Jelinek. It isn’t a rock room or a dance hall, and it’s not a jazz club. You could think of Public Records as a kind of genre-agnostic music festival in residence (like Big Ears in Brooklyn), or as a contemporary expansion on what Tokyo’s jazz record-spinning cafes used to be. It’s a little bit of both. “I come from a jazz and creative-music background, and I’ve seen a lot of venues come and go really quickly,” Mr. Reddy said. He remembered that the Knitting Factory in particular had felt like “a home base where you could go any night of the week and hang,” and said that he senses “a real hunger” for something similar again today: something as reliable as it is eclectic. “I wanted to be conscious of programming artists of different ages, different genders and different races,” he said, listing some of the jazz musicians that he’s already lined up to perform: James Brandon Lewis, Patricia Brennan, Adam O’Farrill. “I wanted it to be inclusive — as inclusive as I could.” "
5c5480fb3a125f5075c0796e,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/01/arts/music/super-bowl-atlanta-rap-concert.html,"ATLANTA — “Welcome to Atlanta, out-of-towners!” the hip-hop carnival barker Lil Jon screamed to a full arena on Thursday night, as he baptized the Super Bowl weekend crowd with a torrent of regional hits. It was the halftime show that never could be — a charmingly slapdash, nearly five-hour profane parade of local heroes and of-the-moment aspirants that represented a specific place and point of view too hot for an audience north of 100 million. Though the annual mid-game concert, which lasts fewer than 15 minutes, is rarely tied to the Super Bowl’s location, this year’s choice of a headliner — the anodyne pop band Maroon 5 — has proved controversial on two fronts: First, for its lack of fealty to the host city’s constantly regenerating pool of black musical talent, and also because of reports that more au courant stars turned down the N.F.L. in solidarity with Colin Kaepernick. (The late addition of the rappers Travis Scott and Big Boi, of the Atlanta duo Outkast, did little to quell the consternation and head-scratching given the three acts’ obvious incongruity.) [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] Still, Atlanta has shown itself to be more than willing to make the most of the festivities. On Thursday, at the first night of the Super Bowl Music Fest at the State Farm Arena downtown, the city’s hip-hop royalty came together for a reverse-chronological survey of Atlanta music this century, from Lil Baby, 21 Savage and Migos to Ludacris, Jeezy and T.I. (The Music Fest concerts were scheduled to continue with more Super Bowl-esque lineups on Friday, with Post Malone and Aerosmith, and Saturday, featuring Bruno Mars and Cardi B.) Though the event was temporally and nominally linked to the N.F.L. — and came with a bevy of corporate sponsorships — football felt like an afterthought, and the crowd booed when periodic commercials for the league interrupted the music. Instead, the concert felt like the celebration of Atlanta that was unlikely to happen on Sunday. And it was part of a constellation of local events, many overseen by the Atlanta Super Bowl LIII Host Committee, that sought to highlight the city’s rich cultural past and present, including six nights of free, genre-spanning concerts at Centennial Olympic Park. (There were no shortage of unofficial parties, after-parties and after-after parties, as well, with many local artists packing multiple appearances into each night.) “I’m not going to say anything bad about Maroon 5 — I love Maroon 5,” said Maya Neguse, a 20-year-old student, as the concert began. “It’s just that they’re not lit enough for the Super Bowl.” Indeed, the arena was ready to move, responding with special enthusiasm to dance crazes that originated locally (“Swag Surfin,” “Crank That (Soulja Boy),” “Laffy Taffy”) and regional references. “If you went to Freaknik make some noise,” said Big Tigger, the night’s occasional M.C., at one point, referring to the storied black college spring break gathering. “If your mama went to Freaknik make some noise,” he added to much louder cheers, revealing the plethora of what he called “’90s babies” in the audience. The night’s performances also served as a genealogical chart for the local scene. Shorter sets from the current princes of Atlanta, like 21 Savage, Lil Yachty and Lil Baby, gave way to a fuller performance by their relative elders in Migos, who welcomed to the stage everyone’s godfather, Gucci Mane. (The most notable absences of the night were from the in-between micro-generation: Future and Young Thug.) Then came the foundational contingent — the artists who might actually be able to hold down a Super Bowl stage if Southern hip-hop could crystallize into classic rap, à la classic rock. Lil Jon, who went from crunk pioneer to EDM conqueror and is now 48, played both rapper and D.J., delivering his well-worn chants — “Get Low,” “Neva Eva (Get On My Level)” — and those of his contemporaries in Crime Mob, Ying Yang Twins and YoungBloodZ. Ludacris, the headliner, also stuck to greatest hits and demonstrations of local unity, beginning with the anthemic “Welcome to Atlanta” and a brief cameo by Jermaine Dupri. After running through the most recognizable parts of his catalog with a full band — the first of the night — Ludacris welcomed the concert’s only female performer, Ciara, who did her best to supply feminine energy with some two dozen backup dancers. From there, as the clock passed 1 a.m., Ludacris was joined by Jeezy (formerly Young Jeezy) and, eventually, T.I., for a brief foray into their proto-trap music. The three men, seemingly mellowed by age and success, stood shoulder to shoulder performing the 2005 song “Bang,” which warns outsiders to mind local Atlanta customs. “When you come this city, just know,” T.I. said as the track ended. “It’s us.” "
5c535e493a125f5075c07651,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/arts/music/review-aprile-millo-zankel.html,"Irish folk songs, princess gowns, a harp and 20 bouquets: The soprano Aprile Millo’s concert on Wednesday at Zankel Hall, her first solo program in New York in 10 years, had it all, and then some. Ms. Millo, 60, who has rarely sung in public recently, says she still has her heart set on a return to the Metropolitan Opera, where she was among the reigning Verdi singers of the 1980s and ’90s. So this was something of a trial run, and for the raucously adoring audience it was an exposure to an artist — beloved as a keeper of the old-fashioned flame of Italian opera — that most people at Zankel hadn’t heard live in years. [Can the diva who once ruled the Met make a comeback?] Joshua Barone and Zachary Woolfe, two of our classical music critics, were at the event, presented by New York City Opera, and they compared notes on the unique experience. WOOLFE So this wasn’t your average song program. BARONE I couldn’t tell whether I was at a rock concert or a recital, with the cheers of “Millo, Millo!” and “We love you, Aprile!” It began with a rose thrown to the stage, and I counted no fewer than five standing ovations from her (very vocal) fans throughout the night. What throwback glamour! WOOLFE Throwback glamour, too, in her gowns, which for the first half rendered her an emerald-color, Isolde-type medieval Irish queen and, after intermission, made her a sapphire vision out of “Frozen,” complete with glittery cape. She coughed; she drank from a water bottle; she cracked jokes; she announced that she was cutting the scheduled first-act aria from “Adriana Lecouvreur” because “Anna Netrebko sang it so beautifully I’m going to leave it to her.” And the crowd ate it up. BARONE Her charisma certainly goes far, even if the banter pushed the evening to just over two and a half hours. And it made her all the more endearing that she wore reading glasses to read music from a stand, because, as she said, “Mother’s memory isn’t what it used to be.” But did you notice a disconnect between her ease speaking to the crowd and the palpable tension in the opening numbers, six Italian songs she assembled for a rough narrative about the arc of a relationship? WOOLFE I don’t like speculating about what artists are feeling, but I can imagine that, after so many years away, she was a little nervous, to say the least. So no, I didn’t think that opening set really bloomed vocally. Throughout the evening, actually, her breath wasn’t ample enough to fill out long phrases; her tone in the middle was a little grainy, the low register cloudy. But there was some big, velvety sound in what I’d call the upper-middle range, and wistful eloquence when she went soft. The traditional Irish songs were lovely; I think everyone got the poignancy of “The Kerry Dance,” “gone, like our youth, too soon.” BARONE Those four Irish tunes, delicately accompanied by the pianist Inseon Lee and the harpist Merynda Adams, were the highlight of the night, or at least when her allure as a recitalist was at its peak. Like a cabaret singer, she blended Irish-American family history and song — “The Kerry Dance” was even more moving because Ms. Millo said her mother used to sing it to her at night. In “Danny Boy,” her voice was raspy and not completely at ease in the lower range of the opening verse. But it blossomed, gloriously, into a moment out of Ms. Millo’s salad days, rising from a fine quiet into a lushly phrased climax: “I’ll be here in sunshine or in shadow.” WOOLFE I also thought there was steady passion in a set of Rachmaninoff songs, which she dedicated to the Russian baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky, who died in 2017. She offered another tribute, to old-school italianità, with a spirit-seeing monologue from Licinio Refice’s “Cecilia,” a vehicle for the great soprano Claudia Muzio. BARONE These tributes throughout the night were reminders of Ms. Millo’s former colleagues and another time, when she was the diva du jour at the Met Opera and accumulating the passionate fan base we saw screaming in support of her on Wednesday. The big question, of course, is whether — after being away from the Met for more than a decade — she’ll sing there again. WOOLFE I don’t know if that’s in the cards; the soprano-baritone duet from Act III of “Aida,” while expressive at Zankel, didn’t make me confident that there was an evening-length leading role in her voice, at least not right now. But who cares? She could bring a lot of joy to people doing concerts like this. There is clearly an audience hungry for her charm, her phrasing, her sincerity, the community she’s gathered around her. (Her encore was a singalong “O Sole Mio.”) Those things can sometimes feel missing from the New York opera scene these days, and Wednesday conjured the art form as it’s meant to be: scrappy but also transcendent, both informal and grand. And brava for that. "
5ca78c2b49f0eacbf1f81370,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/05/business/media/lil-nas-x-billy-ray-cyrus-billboard.html,"Booming beats. A twanging banjo. Is this country music? When Lil Nas X, a young black hip-hop artist from Atlanta, created the surprise hit “Old Town Road,” he did not imagine that it would end up at the center of a debate on race, the Nashville establishment and musical genres. The track marries a beat familiar to hip-hop fans with acoustic sounds and lyrics filled with cowboy imagery. Lil Nas X had no record deal when he made it, and the song bubbled up on the internet before it made three different Billboard charts: the Hot 100, Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot Country Songs. Once it was a success, Billboard removed it from its country chart. On Friday, in what seemed to be a dare to Billboard and Nashville, Lil Nas X released a new version of the song that included the 1990s country star Billy Ray Cyrus as a featured vocalist. Was it country enough for them now? When Billboard banished “Old Town Road” from the country chart, it issued a statement to Rolling Stone claiming the song “does not embrace enough elements of today’s country music to chart in its current version.” With Mr. Cyrus along for the ride, it is possible that country radio stations who ignored it will start playing it. [Listen: Lil Nas X and the long history of country-rap.] Billboard’s decision to drop the song from Hot Country Songs prompted a debate about race and country music itself. White Nashville artists, like Florida Georgia Line and Sam Hunt, have used hip-hop-influenced beats and production techniques for years. Do those performers have more leeway than Lil Nas X? Shane Morris, a former record label executive in Nashville, thinks so. “They said there were compositional problems,” Mr. Morris said of Billboard’s chartmakers, “because they didn’t know how to justify it any other way without sounding completely racist.” Charles Hughes, the director of the Lynne & Henry Turley Memphis Center at Rhodes College, called Billboard’s decision “a bad move,” saying it perpetuated a longstanding racial tension in black music. “Black artists have been influential in country a long, long way back,” Mr. Hughes said, “but country has rewarded white artists that have taken advantage of those influences, without giving black artists the same opportunities.” The rejection of “Old Town Road” by the country establishment, in Mr. Hughes’s view, echoed a time when country radio stations ignored Ray Charles’s groundbreaking 1962 album, “Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music.” Lil Nas X, whose real name is Montero Hill, said he wrote “Old Town Road” last fall, after staying with his sister while avoiding his parents as a college dropout. When his sister finally sent him on his way, he imagined his future. “I felt like a loner cowboy,” he said. “I wanted to take my horse to the Old Town Road and run away. The horse is like a car. The Old Town Road, it’s like a path to success. In the first verse, I pack up, ready to go.” He posted the song online in December along with an observation: “country music is evolving.” It soon became a sensation on TikTok, an app that allows users to make and share short music videos. Young people made video shorts of themselves dressing up in cowboy gear, using the song as a soundtrack. By March, Lil Nas X had nailed down the deal with Columbia. In an interview on Friday, he sidestepped questions about being dropped from the country chart. “I’m still in Billboard — this is amazing,” he said. This week, the song climbed 17 spots, to No. 15, on Billboard’s Hot 100, which measures the popularity of pop songs. The blending of country music and black American forms is certainly nothing new. The white guitarist Jimmie Rodgers, whom many consider the father of country music, built the genre on a foundation of the blues in the 1920s. Ray Charles’s innovations in the early 1960s paved the way for the Nashville success of another black artist, Charley Pride. More recently, Darius Rucker, of the rock band Hootie and the Blowfish, had a No. 1 country hit with “Don’t Think I Don’t Think About It.” Last year, Jimmie Allen, a black performer from Delaware, made Billboard’s country top 10 with his debut single, “Best Shot.” Another African-American singer, Kane Brown, had two No. 1 hits on Billboard’s country chart, one in 2017 and one in 2018. In a statement, Billboard said that its chart decisions were determined by factors including the promotion of a song and its reception at radio and on streaming services, and that it could revisit its decision about “Old Town Road.” So far, the song has gotten little support from country stations. Last week, it was played five times on country stations, according to Nielsen; this week, it was played 62 times by 31 stations. The remixed version of “Old Town Road,” with vocals from Mr. Cyrus, the singer of the 1992 hit “Achy Breaky Heart,” came together two weeks ago, Lil Nas X said. The finishing touches were added on Thursday night, hours before it was released and went viral all over again. The rapper’s collaboration with Mr. Cyrus, the father of the singer Miley Cyrus, may seem unlikely, but Lil Nas X said he had been a fan for years. In December, two days after the song’s initial release, he posted a message on Twitter asking for Mr. Cyrus to join him on the track: “twitter please help me get billy ray cyrus on this.” While the addition of Mr. Cyrus may help the song’s chances on country stations and country charts, the new version makes no substantial change to its core. Mr. Cyrus defended the country bona fides of the original version of “Old Town Road” on Wednesday, adding to the pressure on Billboard and the Nashville establishment by casting Lil Nas X in the role of a beloved country music archetype — the outlaw. “When I got thrown off the charts,” Mr. Cyrus wrote on Twitter, “Waylon Jennings said to me ‘Take this as a compliment’ means you’re doing something great! Only Outlaws are outlawed. Welcome to the club!” "
5c630a6b3a125f5075c094dc,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/12/movies/the-lego-movie-2-catchy-song.html,"That song got stuck inside my head. Before a recent screening of “The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part,” a promotion for the film was playing on a loop with a snippet from its “Catchy Song.” As the chorus repeated over and over that “this song’s gonna get stuck inside your head,” I found that very thing happening on a level so maddening I had to put my headphones in and play something else, anything else, to drown it out. Mission accomplished for the comedian, actor and musician Jon Lajoie, who was asked to write a movie song that would elicit mixed feelings: “maybe 49 percent annoying and 51 percent fun to listen to,” he said. Think Black Eyed Peas’ “I Gotta Feeling” meets Owl City and Carly Rae Jepsen’s “Good Time.” Lajoie gained popularity through comedy videos he posted on YouTube, like rap parodies, fake commercials and even a song called “The Best Song.” He had a recurring role on the FX series “The League” and now records more serious folk rock under the name Wolfie’s Just Fine. “Catchy Song” has an airy sheen thanks to production by the D.J. Dillon Francis and vocals from T-Pain and That Girl Lay Lay. In a phone interview, Lajoie talked about the difficulty of following up the first “Lego Movie” hit song, “Everything Is Awesome,” what it takes to make an earworm and why he doesn’t feel bad for parents who have to listen to it over and over again. How did you end up writing “Catchy Song?” I’d wanted to do this kind of thing for a long time. But the opportunity to write music for an animated movie is few and far between, and it usually goes to Broadway people. I didn’t know whether I’d be good at all. But I wanted to at least try. The filmmakers liked my stuff enough to let me take a crack at it. What was your objective with it? At first we were going more in the direction of a song that is supposed to drive you insane, something that sort of feels creepy and brainwashy. And so I thought about it for a while and then, one day I was showering and I start screaming, “This song’s gonna get stuck inside yo! This song’s gonna get stuck inside yo!” So I wrote an annoying version of that. But eventually the movie’s story changed and it needed to be a somewhat enjoyable song. Was it daunting to think about how to follow up “Everything Is Awesome”? Yes, there’s no way to make a more annoyingly catchy song than “Everything Is Awesome.” So we thought, let’s look at the audience and acknowledge that we know this in an impossible task, and let’s lean into the meta-ness and take it one step further. We wouldn’t necessarily have to write a catchier song, we would just say that the song is super-catchy. Did you try additional ideas before settling on this? Yes, we had a song called “All Is Amazing.” We actually recorded a version of it but never used it. It was almost the exact same thing as “Everything Is Awesome” except every lyric was tweaked just a tad and every melody tweaked just a tad. In the end, we found that it was funny in the room, but after putting it all together it wasn’t that funny. And then there was this other idea where the song would be called, “It’s Hard to Follow Up a Hit Song.” So you can see the territory we were playing around in. What music were you listening to when thinking about this? I listened to a lot of Katy Perry, Taylor Swift and Ariana Grande. Also a lot of K-pop. There’s something very specifically bubblegum there with just a teaspoon of creepy. The producer Max Martin’s theories on writing a catchy song are very eloquent. They boil down to this: find a catchy melody, keep the same amount of syllables every verse and every chorus, hit the melody at the same rhythm every time, and hammer it into the audience’s brain by repeating it over and over. I definitely took that advice. Did it take a while to get what you wanted? We’d produced so many different versions of this song and were struggling to find the right sound. I knew Dillon Francis through a friend, so we sat down with him and he took our descriptions of what we were looking for. When we heard his demo, everyone just breathed a sigh of relief. And on top of that, throw in T-Pain on that chorus, who was incredible. I had written maybe 20 different verses for that song. Then we found That Girl Lay Lay. She came in and freestyled her verses. We sat there in shock and I just threw out all the verses I worked on for a year. So this song would not be what it is without them. Do you have a technique for getting rid of an earworm? Just go listen to any Beatles song. They’re the perfect example of a band doing what pop music is supposed to do but doing it in a great way that is sustainable. Do you feel bad for parents whose kids may want to hear this on repeat? I would feel bad if I wasn’t the person who has heard and heard and heard this song for a year. There’s no way anyone’s ever going to listen to this song more than me. "
5c62997c3a125f5075c0936f,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/12/magazine/letter-of-recommendation-ronnie-james-dio.html,"There’s a unique kind of depression that comes from being broke during winter in Spokane, Wash., where I spent the better part of my 20s and 30s. It’s a place with decommissioned smokestacks on its skyline, where freight trains rumble on raised trellises in a constant metallic purr and where, for me, life felt like sitting at the back of a fishtailing bus that was trying to make its way up an icy hill. My husband, Joe, and I went through 13 apartments and houses in 10 years — each one an attempt to dig out from under a mountain of student-loan debt and medical bills, accrued as we desperately searched for the reason Joe was sick all the time. Once, we left a broken-down car at a mechanic for nine months; our other one was repossessed. We stopped reading the mail for a year, schlepping it instead from house to house, unopened, in a heavy garbage bag. We were college-educated, fully employed people who had been served slices of the American dream on paper birthday-party plates in quiet suburban homes, yet we felt as if America was pushing us away. We found our true home in bars where hipsters and junkies and old homeless guys sat shoulder to shoulder choking down thin beers, plugging quarters into jukeboxes, queuing up thick, heavy-metal songs the rest of the world had already forgotten about. I was always a fan of loud music, but it wasn’t until then that I started to feel pulled toward Ronnie James Dio. Ronald James Padavona was raised in a place not unlike Spokane: Cortland, N.Y. He grew up Catholic, took an early interest in opera, formed his first bands young and rose through the ranks of the 1960s rock scene. He was one of the pioneers of heavy metal, forging his music in the unique fires of lapsed faith and a skepticism of those who seek power. Throughout 50 years of making heavy music — in Elf, Rainbow, Black Sabbath and Heaven & Hell — Dio sang again and again and again about trying to find a home. In Rainbow’s “Stargazer,” Dio tells the story of a wizard who tempts commoners with empty promises, persuading them to enslave themselves to build him a tower from which he will fly. The people realize too late that they’ve fallen victim to a predator: “We build a tower of stone/With our flesh and bone/Just to see him fly/But we don’t know why.” Dio is the aching voice of an embittered, betrayed public — a siren urging them to rise, stand up, take their lives back: “I see a rainbow rising/Look there, on the horizon.” My love for Dio’s music came in a slow drip. During the period in which I regularly came home from work to find red heating-shut-off notices dangling from the doorknob of our rental house, I progressed further into his catalog, taken by all the stories he tells in his music. When he died in the spring of 2010, I thought of all us castaways for whom he must have been singing. The more I listened, the more I felt as if Dio, all along, was talking to people like me and Joe in his songs. There are precise songs for precise moments: Black Sabbath’s “Supernaut” for Friday nights, Metallica’s “Creeping Death” for morning traffic, Judas Priest’s “Painkiller” before a salary negotiation. But Dio’s music was often about finding victory inside yourself, of recognizing the craven intentions of the powerful and fighting back. When he held the microphone, his voice exploded out of him, a smelling-salts blast under the noses of anyone on the verge of giving up. Recently, though, Dio’s music became clearer for me, and it happened around the time I realized that I was remiss in expecting a society set up on the twin values of spending and earning to find a place for a person like me. I was on my way to have lunch with a Pulitzer Prize winner with 23 cents in my bank account and a desperate hope my “emergencies only” credit card wouldn’t be declined. I was on the freeway when, out of the blue, there was Dio: Black Sabbath’s “Heaven and Hell” crashing through a bright afternoon: They say that life’s a carouselSpinning fast, you’ve got to ride it wellThe world is full of kings and queensWho blind your eyes and steal your dreamsIt’s heaven and hell, oh wellAnd they’ll tell you black is really whiteThe moon is just the sun at nightAnd when you walk in golden hallsYou get to keep the gold that fallsIt’s heaven and hell, oh, no. Fool, fool For once, I was broke and I was laughing. How could I listen to a song so many times and only now really hear it? All along, Dio was saying what a fool’s game it is to measure your value on the standards of a society that was never meant for you. Gold is never free, and to get it, you’ve got to bow before a master. “God and the devil are inherent in each of us, and it’s our choice to make,” Dio said in one interview, late in life. “The optimum way to go is to do the good thing.” I think he wanted to leave this as his legacy: a reminder that home is a place inside your own mind. There will always be new wizards to follow, new rings to kiss. But there, too, will always be rejects and castaways. And there’s victory in the realization that there will always be more of us than there are of them. That in our anger, together we are all home. "
5c2fb04d3a125f5075c02e2d,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/arts/music/princeton-meditation-music.html,"PRINCETON, N.J. — For as long as I can remember, I have loved the silences of the concert hall almost as much as the sounds. The expectant hush that falls on an auditorium when the oboe’s A pierces through the hum of voices and the lights dim. The way a spellbound audience can wrap a protective silence around a pianissimo ending. But on a recent afternoon in Richardson Auditorium at Princeton University here, silence became an equal partner to the music. I was in the hall for a series called Live Music Meditation. (The next event, on March 28, features the violinist Patricia Kopatchinskaja.) For the first 20 minutes, while listeners quietly filed in, I sat motionless with my eyes closed, noting the sounds of footsteps and the rustle of coats. Gradually, the calm deepened, broken now and then by a male voice inviting us to focus on our breath, relax our shoulders, and clear our minds. From inside this stillness, the sound of a gong rang out like a bright explosion, followed by waves of amber overtones that seemed to dance with each other in space. Then more silence, long minutes of nothing to hear but the breathing of strangers. When the first notes of a clarinet threaded their way into my consciousness, they seemed to come from inside me. For the next half-hour, as a piano joined the clarinet, music wound its way through me as sound turned pure sensation. Eventually the last note settled back into silence. Then one more time the gong, followed by that male voice, sounding a little sheepish: “Some people would find it appropriate to clap now.” The applause, when it came, did seem out of place. And the performers, the clarinetist Martin Frost and the pianist Henrik Mawe, didn’t bow. In an onstage discussion after the unusual concert, they professed to being somewhat overwhelmed. “We were so aware of you listening to us so intensely that we started to listen to ourselves even more intensely, too,” Mr. Mawe said. An audience member told the musicians that, for him, “the most special thing was the silence before and after you played. There was anticipation without expectation.” The series, which is free to the public, was conceived by Dasha Koltunyuk, a pianist and a longtime member of a meditation group led by Matthew Weiner, a dean in the office of religious life at the university. By combining guided meditation with live music, she hoped to create a space in which, she said in a statement, “our tendency toward passivity or judgment while hearing music disperses into a pure, perceptive and receptive state of intense, present listening.” Composers have long played with silence. In the 20th century, they began to dissolve the border between scripted silence inside the music — the rests — and the ambient silence of a given acoustic space. Ligeti’s “Lux Aeterna” fades into seven bars of rest at the end. John Cage’s “4’33”” consists entirely of notated silence. These days, more presenters are experimenting with ways to make the audience aware of its role in creating the silence out of which music grows. When the artist Marina Abramovic presented the pianist Igor Levit in Bach’s “Goldberg” Variations at the Park Avenue Armory in 2015, listeners were relieved of their cellphones and outfitted with noise-dampening headphones that helped them sink into deep quiet for 30 minutes before the first notes of Bach. Concerts inside the Moab Music Festival’s red rock grotto in Utah begin with an invitation to take in the stillness of the natural setting. A two-minute “celebration of silence” is at the center of Chatter in Albuquerque, N.M., and Gather NYC at SubCulture in Manhattan, both Sunday morning series combining classical music and storytelling. In a telephone interview, the violinist and conductor David Felberg, who runs Chatter, said that most audience members close their eyes for that period. “They’re either meditating or trying to listen to the sounds that exist naturally around them,” he said. “For us, it’s a bit of a palate-cleanser. It’s almost like you’re fresh and ready to listen to the music.” Mr. Weiner, the Princeton dean, who led the guided meditation, said in an interview that he thinks of the quality created in the room not so much as silence but as sensitivity. In Buddhism, he said, that “doesn’t just mean verbal silence with your tongue. It means softening the constructions in your mind that get in the way of experiencing what’s in front of you.” As a critic normally tasked with shaping those constructions into written words, I was keenly aware of that softening. And as a diligent but novice meditator, I caught a glimpse, through the music, of what it means to let thoughts bubble up without engaging with them — through applause or judgment. Here was music not as a text to be read nor a recreational drug to be consumed for mood management, but as an audible process of coming-into-being and fading-away. And, for a short while, listening turned into a state of pure receptivity: beginner’s ear. "
5c53495c3a125f5075c075e1,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/nyregion/vodka-russia-museum-staten-island.html,"[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] Upon arrival at the Booze History Museum in Staten Island, visitors are treated to what Lev Mezhburd, the museum’s founder, director, curator and tour guide, calls a “disinfection.” “The items in the museum are very sensitive,” Mr. Mezhburd said. “To go in there, you have to get rid of the microbes that live on us.” This is how Mr. Mezhburd’s cleansing process works: Wielding a fire extinguisher, he instructs his visitors to open their mouths and say, “Ah.” He then sprays Russian Standard vodka into their mouths. More drinks follow from a series of other visual gags, including an IV drip bag, a radio and a pair of binoculars, all of which conceal vodka. At the start of a recent tour, Mr. Mezhburd, 69, leaned into his bar like a professor resting on a lectern. He came up with a poetic association for each vessel in his disinfection collection. While pouring vodka from a light bulb, for example, he recited a poem about love and light by the Russian Symbolist writer Innokenty Annensky. In case you haven’t picked up on this yet, Mr. Mezhburd believes vodka ought to be celebrated, not vilified. “When you’re talking about alcohol, it’s always just drunken driving or breaking up families,” he said. “Nobody talks about how many people are getting relaxation, how many people are getting enjoyment from drinking alcohol, how many people are getting together because of alcohol.” The museum takes up about 500 square feet in two rooms of Mr. Mezhburd’s home in Grant City, on the East Shore of Staten Island. Since moving there in 1998, he has collected over 1,000 artifacts. The basement is a jumble of signs and statuettes. The bar is plastered with hundreds of different Russian liquor labels. A gallery upstairs is more orderly, with 10 glass cases of booze-related bric-a-brac. Mr. Mezhburd hasn’t done much to publicize his museum, but he said he would consider requests to visit sent through Facebook. Usually his guests have heard about the tours, which occur roughly every month, through word of mouth. They tend to be people like Mr. Mezhburd: Jewish refugees from the former Soviet Union. Tours are usually conducted in Russian, and they frequently turn into larger celebrations of Jewish and Russian culture, with musical performances and potluck buffets. “This is our tradition,” said one visitor, Olga Komarova, 56, who attended similar events during her youth in the Soviet Union. “The main thing is to create a very warm environment, to socialize, to fit together, to sing together, to share some ideas.” The museum, however, extends far beyond Jewish and Russian drinking culture. Mr. Mezhburd’s gallery features display cases organized geographically. They prompt him to tell stories about Omar Khayyam, the 11th- and 12th-century Persian polymath who exhorted his readers to drink wine, and the eighth-century Chinese poet Li Po. “He never was sober. Never in his life,” Mr. Mezhburd said. “And he was a genius.” Some items on the shelves, such as Prohibition-era licenses to drink for medicinal purposes, have real antiquarian value. But Mr. Mezhburd prefers to focus on kitsch. He proudly describes his figurines of grinning clergymen as “the largest collection in the world of drunk monks.” Other items only look serious. Mr. Mezhburd pulled out a leather-bound book called “How to Develop Courage and Self-Confidence.” “This is how,” Mr. Mezhburd said, opening the book to reveal a hidden cavity holding a bottle of vodka and pouring it into shot glasses. “And now, this is what we will do.” Breaks in the tour offer visitors the opportunity to banter in Russian. One guest, who declined to share her name, quoted the satirist Mikhail Zhvanetsky on why it’s a good idea to drink in the morning: “So the sun comes up quicker.” Igor Primak, a high school math teacher, replied to a toast with an old Russian saying: “The toaster drinks to the dregs!” Toward the end of the tour, Mr. Mezhburd produced the very first item he collected: a ceramic figurine of a man with shabby clothes and a stubbly beard, leaning against a street clock and clutching a bottle of booze. Flip a switch atop the figurine, and the man’s head moves from side to side while he whistles a mournful tune. Mr. Mezhburd declared the drunkard his “soul mate.” After the tour, visitors moved to a second-floor living room for a concert by the singer Elmira Galeeva, who interprets poems by the likes of Osip Mandelstam, American rock standards and songs from a genre of Russian folk known as “bard” music. “The poetry — it was part of our lives,” Mr. Primak said, reminiscing about his Moscow University days. “I used to read, and remember, most of those poems she’s singing. It’s something that I miss right now very much.” Other attendees said they’d come mainly in anticipation of the concert. “The most important thing was Elmira Galeeva,” said Ms. Komarova, a devoted fan of the musician. After the concert and a communal dinner of sour cabbage, chicken liver and other regional staples, Mr. Mezhburd returned to the gallery. Amid some conclusory musings, his wife, Natasha, entered the room. “We’re talking about the philosophy of the museum,” someone explained. “Mm,” Ms. Mezhburd said. “It is drinking. This is the one point. Drink a lot.” "
5c76fe1d49f0eacbf105a82f,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/27/fashion/weddings/taylor-swift-surprises-a-couple-again.html,"The wave of attention that accompanied Taylor Swift’s surprise performance at the Los Angeles engagement party of Alexander Goldschmidt and Ross Girard on Feb. 23 was nothing Mr. Goldschmidt didn’t see coming. “I knew this was going to be a moment people talked about — I just didn’t think the news cycle would pick it up this hard because it was Oscars weekend,” said Mr. Goldschmidt, who works in social media marketing for TV shows through the company Digital Media Management. But it’s possible Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper’s swoony Academy Awards duet only fueled interest in love stories: Since Ms. Swift serenaded Mr. Girard with her song “King of My Heart” at the Sycamore Tavern hours after Mr. Goldschmidt proposed, news of the engagement party crasher reached outlets as far as Germany and Australia. “I didn’t think about the fact that Taylor had never performed the song acoustically, and that people might have responded because we’re a gay couple,” said Mr. Goldschmidt, 30, who has been dating Mr. Girard, 32, since 2016. “But that may have added to it.” The series of events that found Ms. Swift, in a ponytail and a blue floral dress, strapping on her guitar for a flabbergasted party of 65 stretches back to 2014, when Mr. Goldschmidt met Ms. Swift backstage at an Ed Sheeran concert. “I had tweeted — and I didn’t even tag either of them — that I wanted an Ed Sheeran and Taylor Swift duets album,” Mr. Goldschmidt said. “Out of nowhere, Ed responded to me. We ended up DM-ing, and he told me he’d get me backstage at his next concert. When I went backstage he grabbed me a beer and said, ‘Have you ever met Taylor?’” Two weeks and many selfies later, Ms. Swift and Mr. Goldschmidt met in Los Angeles on the set of her “Shake It Off” video; Mr. Goldschmidt is among that video’s dancers. They kept in touch on social media. In July 2015, when Mr. Goldschmidt was single and miserable, Ms. Swift shared some encouraging words Lady Gaga had sent her via Twitter. “Life is friends, family, and love! We all see that in you, your prince charming will come!” Lady Gaga’s post said. Mr. Goldschmidt shared the tweet on Instagram. “I have been given my instructions. I leave my love life in Lady Gaga’s magical hands. My Prince Charming will come,” he wrote. He started dating Mr. Girard, who is the head of productions at Campfire, a television and film production company, not long after. In 2018, backstage at Ms. Swift’s “Reputation” show at the Rose Bowl, he was ready to introduce Mr. Girard to his famous friend. But he didn’t have to. “She came up and said ‘Hey Ross!’,” Mr. Girard said. “She had been reading all of Alex’s posts. She didn’t even need to ask my name.” Mr. Goldschmidt and Mr. Girard don’t consider “King of My Heart” their song, the one they fell in love to. Instead, “it was a song that had always resonated with me and my own story, because it’s about someone who has become content with being alone and getting to that place of self love, and then suddenly having someone come into their life and rock their world,” Mr. Goldschmidt said. He didn’t beg, cajole or even ask Ms. Swift to sing it at the surprise engagement party he had been planning for months. Instead, Ms. Swift’s publicist, Tree Paine, reached out to him.  “I had sent Taylor an email thanking her for all of the years of advice on love and on life and for that song, which had sunk into my heart,” Mr. Goldschmidt said. Two weeks later, Ms. Paine called to say Ms. Swift would like to be part of their engagement day. It isn’t the first time Ms. Swift has surprised a couple. In June 2016, she crashed the wedding of Max Singer and Kenya Smith, and about 100 guests in Long Beach Island, N.J., before sitting down at a piano and performing her hit song “Blank Space.” Other couples have been sent champagne and she’s shown up at bridal showers. Mr. Goldschmidt was driving to work in late January when he got the call. “Basically, I lost feeling in my face and I had to pull my car over,” he said. “I cried a little bit, I screamed a little bit, then I tried to restore the feeling to my face.” He kept the news a secret from almost everyone, including his parents and Mr. Girard’s parents, who were flying in from the East Coast for the party. The only person he told was a friend who works as an event planner for the restaurant group that owns the Sycamore Tavern. “I had to tell him so we could figure out the service doors so I’d have a place to hide her,” Mr. Goldschmidt said. Challenges to keeping a poker face presented themselves to the last minute: “I was down on one knee on top of a mountain proposing to Ross, and my phone was going off with calls from her security team about sweeps they needed to do of the venue.” At the start of the viral video from the party, Mr. Goldschmidt and Mr. Girard stand arm in arm, holding champagne glasses. Mr. Goldschmidt says, “There is one secret I didn’t trust any of you with. I would like to welcome my friend Taylor.” As Ms. Swift makes her way into the room, gasps erupt. Mr. Girard said he was too preoccupied thinking of how he was going to thank his loved ones for coming to the party for it to register that he was about to be sung to by one of the world’s most popular performers. And Mr. Goldschmidt’s father thought that his son was introducing a drag queen version of Ms. Swift. “I had to explain to him, I live in Hollywood, not West Hollywood, Dad,” he said. Mr. Goldschmidt and Mr. Girard have not yet picked a wedding date. But they know they’ve set a high bar for reception entertainment. “We’re being told it’s going to be hard to live up to this,” Mr. Goldschmidt said. "
5c8181bc49f0eacbf105bec0,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/07/arts/music/migrations-the-making-of-america-immigration.html,"What do migrants bring with them? On a one-way trip to an unknown new life, perhaps they might pack money, documents, clothes, some small keepsakes. Invisibly and intangibly, they also carry cultural memories: the lullabies their parents sang, the dances they tried at a wedding, the best way to cook a chicken. On new territory, those memories become a link to home and also, with any luck, something to share with the neighbors. It’s the American story, repeated with countless variations for each new arrival; it’s also a hot-button subject in politics worldwide. And it’s the theme for “Migrations: The Making of America,” a citywide festival that gets into gear this weekend, with Carnegie Hall at its center along with more than 75 partner organizations around the city, including the New-York Historical Society, the Irish Arts Center, Harlem Stage, the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research, El Museo del Barrio and the Vietnam Heritage Center. The festival encompasses dance workshops, panel discussions, and walking tours of Harlem along with concerts large and small. “So many different cultures and so many different ethnicities want to tell their story,” said Clive Gillinson, the executive and artistic director of Carnegie Hall. “It tells you something about the potency of the subject.” Carnegie’s own programs focus on three historical migrations to and within the United States: the Irish and Scottish influx in the 18th and 19th centuries; Jews arriving from Russia and Eastern Europe from the late 19th century until the 1924 National Origins Act set quotas on immigration; and the Great Migration of 6 million African-Americans from the South to northern industrial cities. British Isles immigrants brought a repertoire that seeded Appalachian and country music. The Jewish contingent brought essential songwriters to Tin Pan Alley and Broadway. And the Great Migration disseminated blues, jazz, gospel and the other glories of African-American music. When you consider that “some of the most sublime inspirational art you could ever imagine” came out of appalling situations, Mr. Gillinson said, “I think it tells you a lot about what human beings are able to do in transmuting some of the most painful and hardest things in life into something that can actually uplift everyone.” The far-reaching jazz pianist Jason Moran and the opera-trained mezzo-soprano Alicia Hall Moran, his wife, along with guests from jazz, rock, gospel and classical music, address the Great Migration in a Carnegie Hall concert on March 30 titled “Two Wings.” Its foundation, the Morans said in a phone interview, is the book “The Warmth of Other Suns” by Isabel Wilkerson, who will appear. Songs on the program like the spiritual “Two Wings” and the blues “Route 66,” buoyant as they seem, are nonetheless about escape. “The root is sheer terror,” Jason Moran said. “It’s people having to retreat, people having to hide, people having to gather what few belongings they have and do some real improvisation and go to some other city — only to get to that city and discover some other trials later on.” Jewish heritage and its American evolution will have a flagship concert on April 15. “From Shtetl to Stage: A Celebration of Yiddish Music and Culture,” produced by the author Seth Rogovoy, gathers classical musicians (the violinist Gil Shaham and the pianist Evgeny Kissin), klezmer musicians (the clarinetist David Krakauer and the trumpeter Frank London, the show’s musical director), singers and actors to explore the Yiddish theater and its extensive influence. At Zankel Hall, the klezmer clarinetist and mandolinist Andy Statman will lead his trio on March 14, and Michael Feinstein will perform “The Great American Jewish Songbook: Kern, Berlin, Arlen, Rodgers and More” on March 27. The Scots-Irish facet of the festival begins March 9 with a dedicated segment of “Live From Here,” the American Public Media radio show hosted by the eclectic mandolinist and songwriter Chris Thile. “I was a bizarre choice to host this one, seeing as I’m a Southern California boy with no detectable Scotch-Irish heritage to speak of,” Mr. Thile said by phone. (Most of his ancestry is German.) “But in another way, it makes a lot of sense, because it’s about how much influence those migrations have had on American culture and American life.” He added, “Music and the artistic benefits of an ethnically diverse society are undeniable. This country would be nothing without all of the various peoples who are here. What would we have, musically speaking, had we just kept this place all to our initial selves? To say nothing of the fact that it wasn’t ours to begin with.” On April 6 at Zankel, the festival will present the Gloaming, a quintet of Irish and American musicians who merge deeply traditional Irish fiddling and singing with daring, often luminously introspective harmonies and arrangements. To Martin Hayes, a fiddler from County Clare who founded the group, the Gloaming continues a century-long dialogue between Irish music and its American diaspora, restoring some of the subtleties that were discouraged by the limitations of early recordings and the guitar-strumming enthusiasm of the 1960s folk revival. “There is a thread of unacknowledged, deeper emotional expression that got ironed out of the music in some ways,” Mr. Hayes said. In the Gloaming’s music, “Lots of things can happen, but the only rule is that they actually amplify and develop the innate feeling that happens inside the melodic structure.” Meanwhile, the melting pot continues to simmer. The Migrations festival has embraced a series now in its fifth year at the Flushing Town Hall arts center: Global Mashups, which presents double bills of musicians from disparate traditions for an audience that comes to dance. Dance steps are taught before the performance, and after each group plays its own set, they jam together — an accelerated version of American music’s cross-pollination. “By the end of the night, you’re not a stranger any more,” said Ellen Kodadek, the executive and artistic director of Flushing Town Hall. This year’s lineup begins March 9 with the category-defying Hazmat Modine — a blues-rooted group that can swerve into New Orleans brass-band jazz, ska or klezmer — and Falu, a singer born in Mumbai who will be performing music from vintage Bollywood films and from Holi, a Hindu spring festival of renewal and forgiveness. Falu represents the 11th generation of a family of Hindustani classical musicians; she immigrated to the United States 20 years ago, and studied Western songwriting at Berklee College of Music. Her Indian-rooted children’s album, “Falu’s Bazaar,” was a nominee at the most recent Grammy Awards. “My purpose in making ‘Falu’s Bazaar’ was to keep the tradition living,” she said. “To give everybody who has immigrated, who has a different culture to latch onto, who has some story to tell, to give validation that your song matters, your story matters.” She has no qualms about the cross-cultural jam with Hazmat Modine. “Music is the most unifying power,” she said. “We’re going to bring people together.” "
5c33ce4b3a125f5075c033be,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/07/arts/globalfest-world-music-copacabana.html,"They showed up in Mardi Gras headdresses, fedoras and tutus paired with combat boots. They drummed on darbukas, djembes and congas. And many of the performers at Sunday’s GlobalFest also brought grievances with them along with their costumes and instruments: against occupation, the erasure of indigenous voices, walls. GlobalFest, which took over the Copacabana nightclub near Times Square for the first time this year, is an annual showcase of music from all corners of the earth. This year 12 acts performed overlapping sets on three stages in what proved a joyful and often raucous celebration of diversity and culture’s uncanny knack for slipping through borders and stretching out roots underneath walls. As such, the festival is an inherent act of defiance against any attempt to cement hierarchies. At the same time, it complicates the notion of identity politics by demonstrating the composite nature of style. While the musicians’ art was always fueled by tradition, their distinct sounds were almost invariably shaped by the clash — or serendipitous kiss — of difference. Sometimes it was the fusion of geographically far-flung styles that yielded new musical alloys. Indian ragas took on a flirtatious shimmer in the hands of Debashish Bhattacharya, who infused them with strains of Flamenco and Hawaiian music and performed them on a new breed of Indian slide guitar of his own devising. The result was a heady mix of languid Polynesian sounds caffeinated by the rhythmic fireworks of the tabla of Subhasis Bhattacharya, Debashish’s brother. The members of 47Soul are drawn from the Palestinian diaspora, but the group’s musical roots reach even wider, encompassing Middle Eastern dabke drumming, fuzzy synth beats and reggae to eminently danceable effect. Politics are never far from the surface in lyrics that speak of dispossession and in the label — “Shamstep” — the band has given its music, which voices dreams of Arab unity across the Levant. In fact, new labels were often needed to capture new hybrids: “Southern Gothic.” “Freak cabaret.” “Afropsychedelic.” “Afrofuturist global bass” is how the members of Gato Preto describe their combustible blend of rap, funk and Senegalese drumming. The band is fronted by the explosively charismatic Gata Misteriosa, from Mozambique, who teamed up with the Ghanaian-German producer Lee Bass and Moussa Diallo, an incandescent djembe master from Senegal. Their set had a steamy carnival energy, with the relentless drive of the machine-made pulse amplified by heart-quickening flurries of live drumming. Pulses were also set racing by BCUC, a South African group that brings punk-rock energy and hypnotic rhythms to social activism, and by the Orquesta Akokán, a Cuban-American big band uniting dazzling talent and midcentury polish in simmering mambos. A very different spell was cast by Amythyst Kiah — a self-described “Southern Gothic” singer of “alt-country blues” — who gave a standout performance in the evening’s only solo act. Her razor-sharp guitar picking alone guarantees her a place among blues masters, but it’s her deep-hued voice that can change on a dime from brushed steel to melted toffee that commands attention. In performance she comes across as both uncompromising and generous. She introduced a song, the traditional “Darling Cora,” by pointing out its shared roots in English and West African folk. When she sang it, accompanying herself on banjo, the instrument’s dry warmth seemed to carry echoes of the African stringed kora. Jeremy Dutcher, a Canadian who is a member of a Wolastoq community in New Brunswick, showed that artistic dialogue can be just as fruitful when conducted, not across cultures, but between generations. Mr. Dutcher, who won the coveted Polaris Music Prize last year, draws on wax cylinder recordings from the early 1900s of songs in Wolastoqiyik — a language that is now in danger of extinction. His lyrical compositions layer the ghostly frayed voices of his ancestors with jazzy arpeggios on the piano, keening cellos lines and arching phrases sung in his own voice, which is powered by classical training and colored here and there by the tremor and guttural catch of traditional chant. Classical strains also filtered into the elegant set by Magos Herrera, a Mexican vocalist with a feline, smoky voice, who teamed with the string quartet Brooklyn Rider and the percussionist Mathias Kunzli for her new album “Dreamers.” Her songs are drawn from across Latin America, united by delight in melody and storytelling, supported by the string quartet as it seamlessly morphs from rhythm section to silver-screen swooning. And classical instruments appeared — and were sometimes abused — in what was perhaps the most extraordinary show of the evening. Dakh Daughters is born out of Kiev’s theater scene and features seven women who bring equal parts musical and theatrical chops to performances that are witty, subversive and brash. Dressed in tutus and combat boots with their faces painted white, the Daughters stalked the stage like conquerors taking possession of an alien territory. Texts (in Ukrainian, English and French) were delivered in shouts, hisses and yelps, with the voices sometimes coming together in exquisitely vocalized folk harmonies. Individually, the voices belonged to wildly disparate worlds including heavy metal, punk, and the glassy plangency of Balkan folk singing. They handled instruments like found objects: a violin propped against a hip, a cello tilted at a rakish angle. The bassist mostly drew sound from her instrument by spanking it; the drummer stomped the foot pedal of her bass drum as if it were vermin. A signature song of the Daughters is “Rozy/Donbass,” referring to a region contested by Russia, once known to Ukrainians for its rose gardens. It begins with a mournful setting of lines by Shakespeare delivered almost mechanically, with shouts of “Donbass” flung out with raw aggression. Eventually the music takes on a ritualistic whirl until it screeches to a halt with just the word “rozy” — roses — intoned as if by zombies. The song, like the Daughters’ performance, is darkly seductive and alienating at once — a powerful expression of the tensions endured by women in conflict zones, and a reminder that identity often means fighting on multiple battle lines.

5c2fa05c3a125f5075c02e0e,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/arts/music/roulette-brooklyn.html,"If you’re the kind of New Yorker prone to wondering what it would have been like to go to a CBGB that wasn’t located inside the Newark airport, you might also wonder if you arrived in the city too late. Fair enough. But the old bohemian, culturally rich downtown Manhattan spirit still has a few embers burning through the city. And at least one of these, Roulette, is actually more powerful now than at the time of its birth in 1978. Forty years after opening, Roulette is now nestled inside a YWCA complex at the corner of Third and Atlantic avenues in another downtown: Brooklyn’s. Instead of the 74 seats its co-founder — and current director — Jim Staley provided when he first organized concerts in his Tribeca loft, Roulette now has a theater that can accommodate 400. It’s not only the widest ranging music presenter in the city, but also the most comfortable and welcoming. “As long as it’s something that’s of a creative and experimental nature, they’re interested in it,” Henry Threadgill, the Pulitzer Prize-winning composer and saxophonist, said in an interview. “They’ve always been interested in it.” A potent trombonist as well as an administrator, Mr. Staley is modest in describing the roots of one of New York’s most important avant-garde music spaces. “It started out as a collective,” he said in an interview at Roulette. “And then I sort of initiated a series.” That first regular series in Manhattan, which began in 1980, took place in Mr. Staley’s place on West Broadway. “We were just trying this out,” he recalled. “All these people came, and watched John Cage and Merce Cunningham come through the door, pay their five bucks.” It didn’t take long for noted composers, like the Fluxus artist Philip Corner, to start pitching concerts to him. When the neighborhood changed, Mr. Staley started looking for another home in Lower Manhattan. Late in the 2000s, Roulette leased a spot on Greene Street, until the financial crash sent the building owner’s assets into chaos. In 2011, it came to Brooklyn, where it is host to a jovial mixture of styles. In recent seasons, Roulette has presented work by a trio including YoshimiO, the sometime drummer of the avant-rock group Boredoms; a sterling evening of two-piano works by Philip Glass; and a semi-staged presentation of a four-act opera by the composer and saxophonist Anthony Braxton. It is also the rental hall of choice for some of the city’s most vital music programmers, like the avant-jazz Vision Festival and Thomas Buckner’s Interpretations series. At a recent Interpretations concert, the composer and pianist Anthony Davis, author of grand operas like “X — The Life and Times of Malcolm X” and “Amistad,” announced he would perform some material from his next opera, “The Central Park Five,” set to premiere at Long Beach Opera in June. Mr. Davis’s operatic writing was once performed at Lincoln Center by New York City Opera; now, if you want to hear this work in the city, you’ll likely end up at Roulette. Even if you can’t make it in person, you can tune in online; clips of select recent shows run on Roulette TV, while vintage audio recordings have been popping up on the venue’s SoundCloud page. Excerpts from performances by María Grand, Jennifer Choi and Amirtha Kidambi are particularly good on Roulette TV, and the SoundCloud page offers work by the likes of Leroy Jenkins and Pauline Oliveros. A launch party for an even more in-depth archive is scheduled for Feb. 12. The organization also supports up-and-coming artists with residencies and commissions. In the months before the pianist and composer Kelly Moran made her debut on the Warp label, with the album “Ultraviolet,” you could hear her working out the balance of live pianism and electronics at Roulette, thanks to one of its emerging artist grants. Describing the award as “way more monetary support than I’m used to,” Ms. Moran said in an interview that she was “shellshocked” to receive it: “It was kind of a surreal moment, because I had all these ideas for projects I wanted to do related to my record, and now I had the means to do them.” Roulette is generous to audiences, too. To my mind, its balcony remains far and away the city’s loveliest, most relaxing location from which to take in music. I knew Mr. Threadgill liked it, too, based simply on the number of times I have spotted him there. “It’s just so comfortable,” he said during our interview. “I got addicted to sitting upstairs.” Strangers tend to talk to each other during intermission, more than at other spaces devoted to experimental music. Artists often circulate before and after performances. And that beer you bought in the lobby? You can bring it into the hall. “It’s always been the nature of these kind of places that allowed for that,” Mr. Staley said, when I asked how Roulette fostered that welcoming spirit. But once again, he sounded a little too modest. Certainly plenty of spaces pay lip service to the idea of openness, but wind up feeling cliquish. “Some of the places I know, there’s a feeling of: When the thing’s over, get out,” Mr. Staley finally allowed. After a short beat, he added: “It’s not necessarily the vibe here.” Roulette itself isn’t going anywhere, anytime soon. In 2010, it signed a 20-year lease with the YWCA, with a 10-year extension option. The spring 2019 calendar includes a vocal ensemble performing works by Mr. Braxton, music by the composer Erin Gee, and a night of duets by the pianists Vijay Iyer and Craig Taborn. Prices are affordable: just slightly higher than the average New York movie ticket. (A subscription also knocks $5 off the price of most concerts.) If this range of offerings can’t entice you to check out one of the city’s most inviting experimental spaces — well, you can’t blame that on gentrification over in Manhattan. "
5ca0dfdd49f0eacbf1f7afbf,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/31/nyregion/woodstock-festival-1969-stage-souvenir.html,"[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] In this year of 50th anniversaries — astronauts walking on the moon, “Sesame Street” premiering on television and the Mets winning their first World Series, to name only three — Steve Gold has what he says is the biggest souvenir from one of the biggest happenings of all: the stage from Woodstock. “It was the focal point,” said Mr. Gold, who was 15 when more than 350,000 people descended on a field in Bethel, N.Y., about 15 miles from where he grew up. It was, after all, where the Who, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Sly and the Family Stone, Janis Joplin and Richie Havens performed. Mr. Gold was in the crowd. As a local, he was not stuck in traffic on the New York State Thruway, as so many were. “I went back and forth every day because I knew the back roads,” he said. “Not that many people knew the back roads, but I was able to go in and out as I pleased.” After Jimi Hendrix delivered his electrifying performance of “The Star-Spangled Banner” and the crowd left, Woodstock became history. Now there is a museum at the site with psychedelic-looking exhibits. There is a stone marker. “I call it the tomb of the unknown hippie,” Duke Devlin, a longtime “site interpreter” for the museum, declared in a museum video. “Looks like a grave.” Last year, when archaeologists combed the field for five days — one day longer than the festival itself — Spin magazine mused: “Perhaps they would find an old peace symbol? Or a strand of hippie beads? Or Jimi Hendrix’s guitar pick?” Mr. Gold had no such thoughts when he went home from Woodstock in 1969. He figured what he had witnessed was just another rock concert. “For Sullivan County, it was a big to-do,” Mr. Gold said, “but it didn’t seem like this worldwide big to-do.” The big to-do for him was a girl named Robin, whose parents owned a bungalow colony with cottages they rented out during the summer and repaired before the weather turned cold. “What happens after Labor Day is you start renovating or adding additions for the following season,” he said. “My girlfriend’s father was building a little sports area, like basketball hoops and a paddleball court.” One day, Mr. Gold went by to watch. “I want to be nice to the father because I’m dating his daughter,” he said, retelling the story. “He asks if I would help him unload wood from his pickup truck. I say O.K. They’re these plywood panels. He says, ‘I bought these panels at Yasgur’s farm because they were selling everything from the concert, and this was the stage. I bought part of the stage.’ I said, ‘O.K.’ I was like, so what, I’m here because of your daughter, whatever.” He did not imagine that the moment would replay itself someday, but a couple of years ago, it did, in one of those middle-of-the night moments when things come to mind out of nowhere. He was lying in bed. “I didn’t tell my wife I was thinking about my first love,” he said. “But I thought, ‘I remember Robin’s dad telling me he was building the paddleball court with wood from the stage.’” Soon Mr. Gold, who lives in New City, made the drive to Woodbourne, where Robin’s father’s bungalow colony had been, and he and a friend went looking for the paddleball court. The compound had fallen into disrepair and was overgrown. After wandering around, disoriented, he was ready to give up the search. “My friend says, ‘What’s that all the way deep, deep in the woods?’” he said. “I go, ‘I don’t know, but I don’t remember it being that far away.’” They pushed through the brush, crossing a stream that seemed as wide as the Mississippi River. There it was. “The same exact paddleball court that I remember,” he said. He could not be sure it was the court he had watched Robin’s father put together with the boards from Woodstock. Without explaining why, he asked the owners — Robin’s parents had long since sold the place — if he could pull off a couple of the wooden panels. He said they thought it was a strange request, but they agreed. “I saw a lot of the markings that you see in the Woodstock movie and photos,” he said. There were logos for Weyerhaeuser, the lumber manufacturer that had made the boards. “They’re very prominent,” he said, “and some panels had different color paint.” He remembered seeing photographs of the stage with paint like that. “So I was 99 percent sure this was the stage,” he said. He hired an independent consulting firm, which concurred after testing the wood and checking the Weyerhaeuser markings and the paint. “It appears that the plywood in your possession is authentic and from the Woodstock Festival,” the consultant concluded. Mr. Gold did one other thing. He called Robin. “I hadn’t spoken to her since I graduated from high school in 1971,” he said. He reached her after sending her sister a message on Facebook, asking for a telephone number. As he tells it, he got right to the point. “I said, ‘Robin, the reason I’m calling is the paddleball court,’” he said. “Her first words were, ‘Did you know the paddleball court was built from the Woodstock stage?’ I said, ‘Would you write a letter and notarize it?’” She did. Next Mr. Gold hired people to take the paddleball court apart — carefully, piece by piece. He lent some to the Museum at Bethel Woods, adjacent to the original festival site. The museum director and senior curator, Wade Lawrence, had doubts when he heard Mr. Gold’s story about tracking down the plywood panels. “As a museum professional, as a museum curator, I’m always skeptical of any claims of authenticity of any object,” he said. But he met Mr. Gold at a storage unit where Mr. Gold had stashed the wood, and left convinced that it was what Mr. Gold said it was. What was his confidence level? “If I were to put a number on this,” he said, “I’d say it’s in the 90s.” A journalist, Joel Makower, who interviewed Mr. Gold in the 1980s for his book, “Woodstock: The Oral History,” said after hearing the story of the stage that it “sounds plausible.” Michael Lang, one of the 1969 event’s original promoters, said through a spokesman that, “It’s true.” Still, Mr. Lawrence initially resisted Mr. Gold’s offer to provide several panels for the museum’s 50th anniversary exhibit, which opened on Saturday, mainly because the plywood he saw at the storage unit was in poor condition. But Mr. Gold insisted that there was wood that was better looking, and he sent photos of several pieces. “They have water stains all over them,” Mr. Lawrence said, “but hey, it rained at Woodstock.” So he decided to use them in the exhibit. Now Mr. Gold is cutting the wood into small pieces and selling them online. He even plans to save the sawdust, and sell that. (Mr. Lawrence, the curator, distanced himself from Mr. Gold’s commercialization, noting that Mr. Gold’s items are not being sold at the museum. Cutting the wood and selling it is “not something a museum would condone or do,” Mr. Lawrence said.) Is there an appetite for that kind of memorabilia? Should what was left of the stage be cut into circles (for pendants with peace symbols, which Mr. Gold is selling for $99 apiece), into small pieces mounted in a frame ($299) or slightly larger squares ($499, complete with a glass cover)? He said he had sold 500 pendants, 200 frames and about 50 of the $99 items since they went on sale on March 19. One more question: What happened to him and Robin? “I think she started seeing somebody from her parents’ bungalow colony,” Mr. Gold said. “I think she showed him the paddleball court and said, ‘This is the Woodstock stage,’ and he fell in love with her.” "
5c9c7f5f49f0eacbf105f783,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/28/arts/music/hudson-yards-the-shed-arts-center.html,"On opening night at Lincoln Center, in 1962, Leonard Bernstein and the New York Philharmonic, joined by opera singers and a choir, performed music by Beethoven, Mahler, Copland and Vaughan Williams for an audience in tuxedos and gowns. The atmosphere should be decidedly more funky at the concerts that inaugurate the Shed, the 21st-century arts complex devoted to presenting new work, which is just two miles from Lincoln Center. Its first concert series, Soundtrack of America, will celebrate not the European classical sphere but the heritage of African-American music across a broad historical and stylistic spectrum, from spirituals to hip-hop. Most of the crowd will share a dance floor. It’s a statement of purpose, though it also promises to be a party. It signals that the Shed, a $475 million arts center within the Hudson Yards development of luxury retail, name-brand architecture and multimillion-dollar residences, will welcome cultural events and audiences well outside the economic elite. As with all of its programs, some tickets — spread across the room — will be only $10. “Because we’re starting from scratch, we’re trying to customize every decision to being inclusive,” said Alex Poots, the Shed’s artistic director and chief executive. He added: “We commission work across all platforms with parity between performing arts, visual arts and pop. They’re all equal, and there’s no poor relation either in terms of investment or in terms of space, in terms of facilities or in terms of brainpower.” Soundtrack of America, a five-concert series from April 5-14, is directed by the visual artist and film director Steve McQueen (“12 Years a Slave”) and will feature 25 up-and-coming musicians, five per night, playing roughly 15-minute sets. The performers’ mandate is to view the past from the present, placing songs of their own alongside music that influenced them. Their individual artistic paths are intended to add up to an expansive musical constellation. At first, Mr. McQueen said, he had imagined presenting an orderly linear musical progression, from the African rhythms that survived in Congo Square in New Orleans to the present. But America’s musical history made him reconsider. “It’s not linear,” he said. “It goes back on itself, it goes left, and it goes right. Is the wind linear? Sometimes it blows back and forth. It’s like a garden more than anything else. Things are sprouting up all over the place.” The opening-night roster includes Jon Batiste, the bandleader for “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert,” and PJ Morton, the Grammy-winning keyboardist from Maroon 5; other nights feature the rapper Smino; the Grammy-winning blues-rocker Fantastic Negrito; the blues-rooted guitarist Melanie Faye; and the idiosyncratic R&B songwriters Moses Sumney and Eryn Allen Kane. The Shed sought out musicians who are thoroughly conscious of forebears and possibilities. Serpentwithfeet — the self-described “pagan gospel” songwriter Josiah Wise — is on the bill April 9. “This show holds a different place in my heart,” he said. “I’ve always been a fan of not just black music itself, but of the narrative of black music. I’m thinking about the music of today, and how does that relate to the music of the 1940s, or the 1870s. I’m constantly thinking about it. I don’t have the privilege not to. Black music isn’t just decorative. It always has a lot of legwork.” The musicians will be backed by a house band — including horns and strings when needed — led by Greg Phillinganes, the prolifically recorded session keyboardist who has been the musical director for Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder onstage, among many others. The music, Mr. Phillinganes said, will be unmistakably live. “This is an Auto-Tune-free zone,” he said. Mr. McQueen intends the staging to focus on musicians at work. “We want to get as close to the bone as possible, to get to the idea of performance rather than any idea of spectacle,” he said. “I want to see the sweat. I want to see the tears. I don’t need glitter. I don’t need smoke.” The brain trust choosing and advising the performers also includes the history-making producer Quincy Jones, along with two younger producers, Dion Wilson (better known as No I.D., who produced Jay-Z’s album “4:44” and tracks for Kanye West, Drake, Common and Nas) and Tunji Balogun, an executive producer for H.E.R. and Khalid. Building Soundtrack of America was a labyrinthine process. To program the Shed, Mr. Poots cast a wide net of ideas — to, among others, Mr. McQueen, with whom he had curated projects in England. One day Mr. McQueen “phoned me out of the blue,” Mr. Poots recalled at an interview in the Shed’s temporary New York City offices. “He said: ‘Imagine hearing the history of African-American music. Imagine a family tree, and you hear from when the boats arrive, and African-American music starts happening all over the country, right up to now.” Mr. Poots immediately wanted to make that the Shed’s grand opening project, forthrightly declaring that African-American music was central to modern culture. “The minute the idea was hatched, this was going to be it,” he said. “I had absolutely no idea how to do it, and Steve really didn’t, but he said, ‘Let’s just start.’” Instead of a gala opening featuring superstars, Soundtrack of America will present emerging musicians. “We didn’t think it was strange,” Mr. Poots said. “But people have pointed out, ‘Who launches a new arts center with 25 pretty much unknown musicians?’ To me, it was a logical conclusion to the idea and the goal that Steve had set down.” Mr. McQueen and Mr. Poots, who are both British, knew they needed American perspectives and solid academic underpinnings, so they called on an expert: Maureen Mahon, a cultural anthropologist and associate professor at N.Y.U. who concentrates on African-American music. She oversaw a “family tree” — intended as a suggestion, not a canon — of music: from unrecorded African-American music through work songs, spirituals, blues, jazz, swing, bebop, R&B, rock ’n’ roll, hip-hop and onward. A panel of other advisers included the journalist Nelson George and musicologists with specialties ranging from current trap back to little-documented slavery-era music.  The family tree went out to the performers, but beyond that tree, musicians didn’t receive assignments; they defined their own musical genealogy. “It’s hard to pick fruit from such an amazing tree, but no matter which one I pick, I know it’s going to be sweet,” said Tarriona Ball, a.k.a. Tank, the frontwoman of New Orleans poetry-funk-jazz band Tank and the Bangas. “Or maybe even a little bitter, because the history isn’t always so clean.” PJ Morton, who grew up in New Orleans, plans to incorporate prime New Orleans R&B and Stevie Wonder in his set. “It’s a beautiful thing that we can be influenced by everything now,” he said. “But I do think it’s important to know that these are real people and real things, and to understand how we got here.”  The jazz-soul singer and songwriter Sy Smith is hoping to dovetail her father’s doo-wop, her classical music studies, the go-go music she heard while attending Howard University, the mixtape culture of early hip-hop and her current jazz-tinged mode. “I want people to appreciate that we all come from different places to end up where we are,” she said.  The initial five concerts may not be the end of Soundtrack of America. It will be filmed in a five-camera shoot; it could spin off an educational app. And given the infinitude of African-American music old and new, it could lead to additional concerts in many formats as the Shed welcomes culture without tuxedos. “I don’t view our first five concerts as the endgame,” Mr. Poots said. “That's the starting point. We could do this for years.” "
5c7cf77b49f0eacbf105b323,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/04/well/family/using-arts-education-to-help-other-lessons-stick.html,"In “A Tree Grows in Brooklyn,” Betty Smith’s 1943 autobiographical novel about growing up poor in the early 20th century, the public school that the heroine attends is a pretty bleak place. But “there was a great golden glory lasting a half-hour each week when Mr. Morton came to Francie’s room to teach music.” He taught them classical music, the book continues, without telling them what they were learning, setting his own words to the great works. “Little boys whistled part of Dvorak’s New World Symphony as they played marbles. When asked the name of the song, they’d reply ‘Oh, “Going Home.”’ They played potsy, humming ‘The Soldiers’ Chorus’ from Faust, which they called ‘Glory.’” Francie also looked forward to the visits of the drawing teacher; “these two visiting teachers were the gold and silver sun-splash in the great muddy river of school days.” Arts education in schools has introduced many children to great painters and great music, and helped them through their first dance steps or tentative musical endeavors. It can serve as a bright spot in the schoolchild’s day or week, a class that brings in beauty, color and joy, and which is not about testing. These subjects are often under threat either from budget cuts or from the inexorable demands of academic testing and “accountability,” but insights from neuroscience suggest that arts education can play additional important roles in how children learn. Paul T. Sowden, a professor of psychology at the University of Winchester in England, warned that in Britain, as in the United States, arts and humanities subjects have suffered in recent years as the emphasis shifted to science and technology. It's important, he said, that arts education be available equally to everyone. But arts education, he said, is a chance to build resilience and determination in children, as well as to help them master complex skills. Arts education encompasses many disciplines: “I’m talking about everything from music, drama, dance, design, visual arts,” Dr. Sowden said. And the goal goes beyond the specific subjects, he said: “You’re looking for opportunities in the arts education context to encourage children to ask questions, to use their imaginations, but also to approach their work in a systematic, disciplined way.” When children are younger, arts education helps develop their capacity for collaboration, for creativity, and even for asking questions. As they get older, he said, “their executive function is much more developed, their ability to sustain attentional tasks is much greater.” For them, arts education can offer the chance to refine and polish a skill over time, or revise a project until it is as good as it can be. Sometimes the arts are taught in a very set curriculum, Dr. Sowden said, but there are real advantages to teaching in a more exploratory way, where children can experiment. And both parents and teachers can encourage children to explore, he said; “that’s the way you get the biggest benefit, not just learning to reproduce a particular work by Monet or dance sequence.” The skills that children master in arts education, he said, may be transferable to other curricular areas. Mariale Hardiman, a professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Education, where she directs the neuro-education initiative, was interested in how children do — and don’t — retain what they learn in school. “A lot of the information we teach doesn’t stick.” What she saw as a school principal, she said, was that when arts were integrated into the curriculum, “learning became more visible.” Teachers told her “the children would remember the information better when they taught it through the arts.” So though arts education has many other benefits, she said, such as creative thinking, her studies have focused on children’s memory for academic subjects, comparing what children remembered 10 weeks after material was taught. Researchers wrote two different versions of the curriculum, matched for content and timing, both involving active learning, but one including arts education. For example, in an arts integrated curriculum, students would sketch their vocabulary words, or learn some of the material as songs, or act out molecular motion with their bodies. The children who had learned the material in the curriculum that made use of the arts remembered more, and the effect was largest among the children who were less strong academically, the “lower performers.”  “We found the biggest difference with children at the lower level of achievement,” Dr. Hardiman said. “Could this be at least one lever for closing an achievement gap?” After all, these are often the students who are condemned to dreary drill and repetition, in hopes of bringing them to a higher level: “What if the arts are a lever of school reform, better than the drill and kill we do with remedial students?” In a 2019 article in the journal Trends in Neuroscience and Education, Dr. Hardiman and her colleagues described the results of a randomized controlled trial looking at fifth-graders who were taught science content, some using techniques from arts education, and others with more conventional instruction. The researchers again saw an effect on the students with more limited reading skills; they remembered more science if they had learned with the integrated arts methods. So why might the arts integration help children’s memory? “Arts allow for elaboration, allow for repetition,” Dr. Hardiman said. “Memory is certainly enhanced through repetition, the more you revisit something, the more you remember it.” And the visual and performing arts also allow children to elaborate in creative ways on the material. The advantage of learning through the arts will come as no surprise to anyone who grew up with the “Fifty Nifty United States” song or learned how a bill becomes a law from Schoolhouse Rock. Some of today’s children are learning history from the lyrics of “Hamilton.”  I suddenly remembered a rather mournful tune from decades ago, in high school, when a science teacher told us we would be tested on the elements with a charge of positive 2 and a friend and I set them to a chant; I can still name them, in order, and when it comes to chemistry, I am definitely one of the less able students. “Arts integration should not replace arts education,” Dr. Hardiman said. She suggested a “three-legged stool,” with one leg being arts education, including dedicated classes in visual and performing arts, and the second arts and cultural offerings, such as artists coming into the school or visits to museums. The third leg would be the integration of the arts into the teaching of other subjects. “Parents can easily do simple arts activities with kids,” Dr. Hardiman said, and can incorporate these ideas around homework or just in spending time together. Maybe it would help to put the multiplication tables into a song, or ask children to sketch their ideas, or use body poses to show the emotion that a character in a story is feeling. Ronald Beghetto, a professor of educational psychology and the director of Innovation House at the University of Connecticut, studies creativity in educational settings, which, he said, “can be manifest across all different disciplines.” “We tend, as adults, to overplan and overstructure young people’s experiences,” Dr. Beghetto said. While structure is important, he said, so is “letting kids determine their own problems to solve, their own ways to solve them.”  Arts education, he said, can provide those structured opportunities that foster creativity.  “Working through some creative endeavor, we’re really resolving uncertainty,” he said. “We approach the blank canvas.” "
5c51d1103a125f5075c07206,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/30/arts/music/carnegie-hall-beethoven.html,"What do you get the composer who has everything? More everything. Beethoven hardly lacks for exposure, but to mark the 250th anniversary of his birth, in 1770, Carnegie Hall announced on Wednesday that it would go all in, and devote roughly a fifth of its 2019-20 season to his music. All his piano sonatas. All his string quartets. Lots of his chamber music. And not one but two cycles of all nine symphonies: one performed on period instruments, with John Eliot Gardiner conducting the Orchestre Révolutionnaire et Romantique, and another on modern instruments, with Yannick Nézet-Séguin and the Philadelphia Orchestra. “We all feel this is really the pivotal figure in the history of Western classical music,” Clive Gillinson, Carnegie’s executive and artistic director, said in an interview. “Everything he touched, he changed and transformed.” Mr. Nézet-Séguin, who became music director of the Metropolitan Opera this season, will be the subject of a Perspectives series that will give New Yorkers a chance to hear him conduct all three of his ensembles: the Philadelphians, the Met Orchestra and the Orchestre Métropolitain of Montreal. The mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato, the singer-songwriter Angélique Kidjo and Mr. Gardiner will also have Perspectives series, and Jörg Widmann will hold the Richard and Barbara Debs Composer’s Chair. There’s a lot to chew on in the season, which will open Oct. 3 with Franz Welser-Möst conducting the Cleveland Orchestra, and will end June 21 with Daniel Barenboim and the Vienna Philharmonic. So here is a tip sheet, with critics and writers for The New York Times highlighting some of the concerts that intrigue them next season. MUNICH PHILHARMONIC (OCT. 25-26) AND BAVARIAN RADIO SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (NOV. 8-9) ORCHESTRE MÉTROPOLITAIN (NOV. 22) AND ORCHESTRE SYMPHONIQUE DE MONTRÉAL (MARCH 24) The season brings a couple of battle-of-the-bands moments. Most halls would be happy to import a single orchestra from Munich or Montreal, but Carnegie is bringing a pair from each city. So New York audiences will be able to contrast performances of Valery Gergiev conducting the Munich Philharmonic with those of Mariss Jansons leading its neighboring Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra. And they will be able to compare the Orchestre Symphonique de Montréal, under the baton of Kent Nagano, with that city’s lesser-known ensemble, the Orchestre Métropolitain. MICHAEL COOPER AMERICAN COMPOSERS ORCHESTRA, NOV. 13 This ensemble’s reliably excellent taste results in a program that features new orchestrations of Ives songs by Hilary Purrington and Hannah Lash, as well as the premiere of a guitar concerto by Ms. Purrington. Her recent “A Clarion Call” is packed with haunted harmonies and riotous humor that Ives might well have admired. SETH COLTER WALLS IRISH CHAMBER ORCHESTRA, NOV. 19 Unique synergies often develop when an orchestra is led by a composer-performer. In his collaboration with the Irish Chamber Orchestra, Jörg Widmann, as conductor and solo clarinetist, serves up a meticulously balanced program with compositions that showcase his debt to Bach (“Versuch über die Fuge”) and rock (“180 beats per minute”) alongside works by Mendelssohn, Weber and Mozart’s own Bach-flavored Adagio and Fugue in C minor. CORINNA da FONSECA-WOLLHEIM CONRAD TAO, NOV. 20 KIRILL GERSTEIN, FEB. 20 IGOR LEVIT, MAY 5 A great way to refresh repertory staples is to perform them alongside new and recent works. The brilliant young pianist and composer Conrad Tao offers a particularly bold example of this approach in his solo recital at Weill Recital Hall, which fascinatingly juxtaposes the old (Bach, Rachmaninoff, Schumann) and the new (David Lang, Julia Wolfe, Jason Eckardt). At Zankel Hall, the formidable Kirill Gerstein will play unusual works by Liszt, Brahms and Gyorgy Kurtag steeped in Hungarian dances and folk song, as well as pieces by Haydn, Busoni, Bartok (the flinty, seldom-heard Piano Sonata), Thomas Adès and, to end, Schubert’s exuberant “Wanderer” Fantasy. Igor Levit will join Carnegie’s Beethoven salute in Stern Auditorium with Sonatas No. 9, 10 and 11, and the still-astounding “Hammerklavier.” ANTHONY TOMMASINI SO PERCUSSION, DEC. 7 The program for this virtuosic and often mind-opening quartet, “A Century of Percussion,” is something of a greatest hits concert. They will revisit pieces like David Lang’s “the so-called laws of nature,” Steve Reich’s “Music for Pieces of Wood” and John Cage’s “Third Construction.” But the evening will also include the local premiere of a new work by Julia Wolfe. JOSHUA BARONE ORCHESTRE RÉVOLUTIONNAIRE ET ROMANTIQUE, FEB. 19-24 There is hardly a shortage of recordings of Beethoven’s symphonies, but the one I inevitably turn to is John Eliot Gardiner’s vigorous, colorful, altogether vital cycle with this period-instrument ensemble. After a pair of crack Berlioz performances at Carnegie this past fall, this team is surely ready to put the old Ludwig van through his paces. ZACHARY WOOLFE THE CROSSING, MARCH 25 Such is their radiant sound and the vibrancy of the repertory they’ve cultivated, it’s gotten to the point I’d hear anything this Philadelphia vocal ensemble sings. At Carnegie they’ll join the cellist Maya Beiser, whose charismatic cross-genre experiments have seductive savvy, in the New York premiere of Michael Gordon’s “Travel Guide to Nicaragua.” ZACHARY WOOLFE BOSTON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA, APRIL 15 After presenting Act II of Wagner’s “Tristan und Isolde” at Carnegie last spring, the Bostonians will be back, under the baton of Andris Nelsons, for Act III. These two concerts are a test drive for the tenor Jonas Kaufmann, who has been gradually rolling out his Tristan. (Other cast members include Emily Magee as Isolde and Günther Groissböck as King Marke.) JOSHUA BARONE QUATUOR ÉBÈNE, APRIL 17-MAY 2 Even outside of anniversary years, cycles of the Beethoven string quartets mushroom all over the concert landscape. But this French ensemble, known for its passionate and rigorous playing, is sure to bring something special to its six-concert survey in the spring. Do stick around for the encores, which these players use to shoot off in unexpected directions with improvised takes on folk music, jazz or the Beatles. CORINNA da FONSECA-WOLLHEIM TIMO ANDRES, APRIL 29 Aaron Copland’s mid-20th-century Piano Sonata is the oldest work you’ll find in this solo recital, which features a wide range of pieces by contemporary composers like John Adams, Donnacha Dennehy and Frederic Rzewski — and, of course, Mr. Andres himself. Later in the evening is a premiere from the young composer Gabriella Smith. JOSHUA BARONE MAURIZIO POLLINI, MAY 17 There’s enough Beethoven this season to last a lifetime, but it’s a lifetime of Beethoven that Mr. Pollini, 78 years young, will bring to this performance of the final three piano sonatas. There’s no artist I’d rather hear play this music. DAVID ALLEN VIENNA PHILHARMONIC, JUNE 19-21 Poor Mahler, with just six performances of his symphonies next season at Carnegie. I wouldn’t want to miss Michael Tilson Thomas conducting the Sixth in his farewell performance at the hall before stepping down as music director of the San Francisco Symphony (March 18), but Daniel Barenboim has a peculiar, productive way with these scores that makes these concerts more promising than the norm. He leads the Fifth, Seventh and Ninth. DAVID ALLEN "
5c6fba6f3a125f5075c0af74,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/22/arts/what-to-see-in-new-york-city-this-spring.html,"Broadway, Wagner’s “Ring,” the opening of the Shed: what our critics and writers are looking forward to this season. ‘TOOTSIE’ What’s wrong with musical comedy? Generally, the music. And the comedy. Which may be why most of the best musicals of the last decade — “Fun Home,” “Hamilton,” “The Band’s Visit” — have been serious indeed. The art of being funny on the beat is mostly a lost one. But David Yazbek, the songwriter behind the musical comedies “Dirty Rotten Scoundrels” and “The Full Monty,” maintains the magic. Even his score for “The Band’s Visit,” mostly drenched in melancholy, has moments of lyrical hilarity. Let’s just say “marrow” and “pharaoh” never thought of rhyming until he insisted. That’s the top reason (among several) I have high hopes for the stage version of “Tootsie,” arriving at the Marquis Theater on March 29. Based on the 1982 movie about an actor whose stalled career revives only when he pretends to be a woman, it offers both the size and sentiment a musical comedy, in any era, needs for liftoff. JESSE GREEN ‘OKLAHOMA!’ What’s likely to be the freshest, most revolutionary musical on Broadway this season is more than three-quarters of a century old. Its title is “Oklahoma!,” and, yes, that’s the same Rodgers and Hammerstein show about farmers, cowhands and frontier love that was first seen in New York in 1943. But the director Daniel Fish’s revitalizing interpretation, scheduled to open at the Circle in the Square Theater on April 7, asks theatergoers to look at a deeply familiar classic through the eyes of the 21st century. The songs, dialogue and characters remain almost entirely the same. But as it demonstrated during its sold-out run at St. Ann’s Warehouse in Brooklyn last year, Mr. Fish’s version finds provocative depths of darkness amid the prairie sunshine. BEN BRANTLEY ‘INK’ The British actor Bertie Carvel, who wore a dress for his Tony-nominated role as the terrifying schoolmistress Miss Trunchbull in the musical “Matilda” six years ago, is switching to neatly tailored trousers for his return to Broadway. But don’t expect him to be any less intimidating. In James Graham’s “Ink,” which opens in April at the Samuel J. Friedman Theater, Mr. Carvel will be portraying one Rupert Murdoch. And in this London hit about the tabloidization of British journalism, directed by Rupert Goold, any similarities between Mr. Carvel’s character and a certain Australian-born media mogul are definitely not coincidental. BEN BRANTLEY ‘WHAT THE CONSTITUTION MEANS TO ME’ Heidi Schreck’s play about invisible women and the 14th Amendment was electrifyingly topical when it ran Off Broadway last year, amid the national outcry over the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh. Sadly or fortuitously, “What the Constitution Means to Me” is even more urgent as it moves to Broadway, where performances begin on March 14. Its take on abortion as a protected liberty (and a personal turning point) comes smack up against now-Justice Kavanaugh, who signaled, in one of his first opinions, a willingness to reverse Roe v. Wade. But the play is deeper than its timeliness suggests. Though it uses the idea of debate as a touchstone — and ends, deliciously, with a live one — it’s really about how we come to question our most bedrock assumptions about the world. If that makes seeing it almost a civic duty, duty has rarely been so pleasurable. JESSE GREEN ‘THE LEHMAN TRILOGY’ Three Bavarian-born brothers who first set foot on American soil more than 150 years ago are returning to New York next month, accompanied by a centuries-spanning brood of their descendants. Their names are Henry, Emanuel and Mayer, and they — and their seemingly countless kin — will be reincarnated at the Park Avenue Armory in Stefano Massini’s “The Lehman Trilogy,” an epic tale of financial rise and ruin, directed by Sam Mendes. This three-hours-plus production features what is surely the largest cast of characters of any play in town. Yet they are embodied by a mere three, seemingly inexhaustible actors with the power to multiply themselves like amoebas: Simon Russell Beale, Ben Miles and Adam Godley. Though the story they tell — which begins and ends with the world-rocking bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008 — is one of entropy, the play in which they appear promises to be a resounding testament to the regenerative powers of theater. As befits a sprawling, globe-girdling story of historic transformation, “The Lehman Brothers” has an intricate, multinational pedigree. Mr. Massini’s chronicle of a dynasty begun by emigrants to the United States began life as an Italian radio play before making its stage debut in Paris (in French) in 2013. Its Italian premiere was at the fabled Piccolo Teatro in Milan two years later, when it ran a whopping five hours. Ben Power’s English-language adaptation opened at the National Theater in London last summer, overseen by Mr. Mendes, the very busy stage and film director whose gripping production of Jez Butterworth’s “The Ferryman” is a current hit on Broadway. Mr. Power pared Mr. Massini’s trilogy to a sleek and unexpectedly lyrical three hours (not counting two intermissions) to be performed almost entirely by three actors on an elegant but nearly empty rotating set (by the ever-inventive Es Devlin). Otherwise, empty is hardly a word to be applied to this interpretation, as I can attest from seeing it at the National last July. Mr. Beale, Mr. Miles and Mr. Godley fill the stage to repletion, as they assume the varied forms of the dynasty-founding Henry, Emanuel and Mayer — and all subsequent generations of Lehmans. And their friends, lovers, spouses, customers, rivals, ad infinitum, with a variety that continually astonishes. Unlike investors who lost their fortunes on Wall Street a decade ago, no one who leaves this encounter with the brothers Lehman is likely to walk away feeling poor. BEN BRANTLEY ‘MARYS SEACOLE’ Born in 1805 to a free Jamaican mother and a Scottish father, Mary Seacole grew up to become an international businesswoman and freelance nurse, crossing paths with soldiers, royalty and Florence Nightingale. That would be more than enough material for a straight-ahead bio-drama — but not, it seems, for the always surprising and formally ingenious Jackie Sibblies Drury, whose “Fairview” was one of last year’s best plays. In the deliberately plural “Marys Seacole,” playing through March 24 at LCT3’s Claire Tow Theater, everyone in the six-woman cast is a Mary — or a Merry, a Miriam, a Mamie or the like. The indispensable Quincy Tyler Bernstine appears as the historical Mrs. Seacole in this production directed by Lileana Blain-Cruz. The others, whose characters cross continents and time, help raise a central question of nursing even now: Who takes care of the people who take care of others? JESSE GREEN ‘WHITE NOISE’ No American playwright has contributed more to the churning and ever-evolving conversation about race in these United (and divided) States than Suzan-Lori Parks. This prodigiously imaginative writer, who won a Pulitzer Prize for “Topdog/Underdog,” has addressed the toxic legacy of slavery in a rich assortment of theatrical forms and languages, from the surrealism of her early “The America Play” to the Homeric chronicle “Father Comes Home From the Wars.” Now Ms. Parks is focusing her gaze on interracial friendships in the 21st century with the resonantly titled “White Noise,” which begins previews next month at her longtime home, the Public Theater. Oskar Eustis, the Public’s artistic director, oversees a four-member cast, led by Daveed Diggs (the original Marquis de Lafayette in “Hamilton”) as an African-American man forced to reconsider the depth and danger of the gap between black and white. BEN BRANTLEY ‘MRS. MURRAY’S MENAGERIE’ I’m not sure anyone could have imagined a duller setting for a play than a high school faculty meeting, yet in “Miles for Mary,” the theatrical collective called the Mad Ones turned the banality of the break room into a hilarious and ultimately galvanizing Off Broadway hit. As if to top themselves, the Mad Ones return this spring with “Mrs. Murray’s Menagerie,” set in (a) the 1970s; at (b) a focus group; for (c) a children’s television show. That is all we know, and all we need to know. Except that the Ars Nova production, which begins performances on March 26 at the Greenwich House Theater, features a cast of expertly light-touch farceurs under the direction of Lila Neugebauer, who made “Miles for Mary” so moving behind the laughs. If this is banality, let’s have more! JESSE GREEN THE ‘RING’ The Metropolitan Opera’s high-tech, low-energy production of Wagner’s four-opera “Ring,” which returns for three cycles this spring, has been notable mostly for its snafus. At its first performance — “Das Rheingold,” back in 2010 — the set’s massive array of seesaws malfunctioned near the end, spoiling the gods’ climactic ascent across a rainbow bridge. Another time, the Microsoft Windows logo flashed across the stage instead of the sophisticated projections that distinguish the cycle’s many locales. One performance of “Die Walküre” that was being broadcast live to cinemas worldwide was delayed nearly an hour because the “Machine,” as it became known, wouldn’t cooperate. And that’s not counting the loud creaks and whirs that accompanied its every move. But while the Met claims that the costly Machine — conceived by the production’s director, Robert Lepage — has been tamed, the technical troubles always struck me as distractions from the real problem. All of Mr. Lepage’s spending and innovation resulted in a cycle that was dull, and out of touch with Wagner’s intricately drawn characters and plot. The singers seemed genuinely undirected, lost in front of the set’s imposing mass; the production team was scrambling to make the effects work, but it appeared that relatively little attention had been given to the acting. There were no discernible relationships charted onstage, no drama, no attempt to transmit — let alone interpret for our time — complex themes of power, sacrifice and societal collapse. Indeed, though the set design meant that some singers spent long stretches in a kind of trough, the effects, while wonky, may have been the best part. At the beginning of “Das Rheingold,” bathed in blue light, the 20 enormous planks levitated in silence. Wagner’s long, low E flat began. Then, like the music, the machine began undulating — first slowly, then faster. It truly was the river Rhine. The opening storm of “Die Walküre” similarly came to life: We were in a sky full of dark, rushing clouds; then in the middle of a forest during a snowstorm; then inside a hut glowing with firelight. It was sweeping and evocative. A production crowded with visual stimulation, in which the singers seemed to be left to their own devices? This “Ring” reminded me, more than it probably intended to, of the Met’s hyper-realistic Franco Zeffirelli spectacles of the 1980s. Like Mr. Lepage, Mr. Zeffirelli creates grand spaces in which stick figures are moved around. The shows ignite when you have compelling performers and sink when you don’t. This revival — which Peter Gelb, the Met’s general manger, is mounting after many thought the Machine, last seen in 2013, would be mothballed for good — does indeed have some compelling casting. Christine Goerke, as Brünnhilde, promises more vocal confidence than Deborah Voigt had when the production was new; Greer Grimsley and Michael Volle will each make a capable, articulate Wotan; Philippe Jordan returns to the Met for the first time since 2007 to conduct. Things may well go more smoothly this time around. But will this yet be a Wagner we can believe in? ZACHARY WOOLFE ‘PRISONER OF THE STATE’ “How he mocked me,” a villainous official laments, explaining why he locked away the political prisoner he now wants killed. That chilling line rings out in “prisoner of the state,” the new David Lang opera that reimagines Beethoven’s only opera, “Fidelio”; the New York Philharmonic will give its premiere on June 6.Beethoven’s theme feels as resonant as ever in a country grappling with questions about mass incarceration; immigrants separated from their children at the border; whether the president is answerable to the law; and how inmates were quietly kept without heat or light for days in a federal jail in the middle of New York City. The opera, directed by Elkhanah Pulitzer, will serve as the finale of Jaap van Zweden’s first season as the Philharmonic’s music director, and he will conduct a cast that includes the moving bass-baritone Eric Owens. MICHAEL COOPER ECSTATIC MUSIC FESTIVAL Among its other skills, the Bang on a Can organization  is smart about fund-raising. By soliciting fans to help them commission new works, the collective ensures a reliably expanding repertory for its in-house chamber ensemble, the Bang on a Can All-Stars. The latest batch of these “People’s Commissioning Fund” pieces comes to the Ecstatic Music Festival at Merkin Concert Hall on March 6. Fresh music by Nicole Lizée and Pulitzer Prize-winner Henry Threadgill will share a bill with vintage works by Annie Gosfield and Glenn Branca, who died last year. The evening’s theme is music for dancing, which Mr. Threadgill has previously explored with his Society Situation Dance Band. If you can’t make it to the concert, you can tune in for a live webcast, on newsounds.org. SETH COLTER WALLS MITSUKO UCHIDA It’s easy to forget that the piano is a percussion instrument when it’s played by Mitsuko Uchida. She animates it with both symphonic might and enchanting lyricism — a perfect fit for the vast emotional range and singing melodies of Schubert. Ms. Uchida recorded one of the finest cycles of Schubert’ssonatas, and she has been revisiting portions, the late works, in a survey at Carnegie Hall. That comes to an end this spring, with two recitals on April 30 and May 4. Endings are very much part of both programs. They are almost stages of grief: The Sonata No. 20 in A (D. 959) contains an abruptly tumultuous passage, like a petulant tantrum, then the heart-rending Sonata No. 21 in B flat (D. 960) offers bittersweet acceptance. JOSHUA BARONE THE SHED The Shed has a modest name and enormous ambitions. Opening April 5, it’s the cultural component of the gigantic Hudson Yards development on the West Side of Manhattan: an eight-story structure that includes galleries; rehearsal space; a theater that can adapt to seated or standing-room events; and a shell that can enclose an adjacent plaza into a performance space. Its mandate is to commission and present world premieres of new and innovative works, and its artistic director and chief executive, Alex Poots, arrives after a decade as the artistic director of the Manchester International Festival in Britain and, in recent years, of the Park Avenue Armory in New York City. The Shed’s first full-scale offering celebrates the heritage and scope of African-American music. Over five nights from April 5-14, “Soundtrack of America” sets out to explore a “family tree” of American music, from spirituals to hip-hop, with a lineup of 25 young performers to bring out continuities and breakthroughs. “Soundtrack of America” arrives with unquestioned credentials. The series is conceived and directed by the filmmaker and video artist Steve McQueen, whose “12 Years a Slave” won the Oscar for best picture in 2014. His brain trust includes the illustrious producer Quincy Jones; the crate-digging hip-producer No I.D. (a.k.a. Dion Wilson); and the keyboardist Greg Phillinganes, who was Michael Jackson’s musical director and has worked with Stevie Wonder, Eric Clapton and Bruno Mars. The performers announced so far — five each night — include 2019 Grammy winners like Fantastic Negrito and PJ Morton; the genre-meshing New Orleans band Tank and the Bangas; Judith Hill, who sang backup for Prince and Michael Jackson, among many others; the rapper and singer Smino; the eerily idiosyncratic, falsetto-loving songwriters Moses Sumney and serpentwithfeet; and Jon Batiste, who leads the band Stay Human on “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.” The African-American musical family tree gives them a boundless source of potential material. The Shed has also announced another major musical production, May 6-June 1: a premiere from Björk, who introduced her “Biophilia” in 2011 at the Manchester International Festival. Björk describes it as “my most elaborate stage concert yet, where the acoustic and digital will shake hands”; her backup includes a seven-woman Icelandic flute ensemble. The title, promisingly, is “Cornucopia.” JON PARELES ROBYN A Robyn show is a bit different from other pop concerts. It isn’t an over-the-top spectacle of rotating set pieces and wardrobe changes, or a showcase of vocal acrobatics and choreographed backup dancers. It is sweaty and straight-up — pop church and pop group therapy, a place for fans of the Swedish singer and songwriter, who first hit the United States in the late 1990s, to experience Robyn’s transcendent, deeply addictive music beside her. From February to April, including a stop at Madison Square Garden in New York on March 8, she’s touring to support “Honey,” her first full album in eight years, which came after a half-decade of psychoanalysis and a series of personal challenges. Her loyal listeners have been anxiously waiting to share their euphoria and pain. CARYN GANZ MASSIVE ATTACK In 1998, the British trip-hop trio Massive Attack unleashed its third album, “Mezzanine,” a brooding, sensual, chilly, paranoid record of sputtering grooves and gauzy atmospherics that wound its way into popular culture everywhere, from “The Matrix” to the TV show “House.” The band has released two more albums in the 21 years since, but the gravitational pull of “Mezzanine” remains potent, and the group — now a duo consisting of Robert del Naja (known as 3D) and Grant Marshall (Daddy G) — is playing a series of shows marking its (belated) 20th anniversary. The brief tour, which hits Boston on March 14 and wraps in San Diego on April 2, promises to be an enveloping, dynamic visual extravaganza. CARYN GANZ BIG EARS FESTIVAL The Big Ears Festival in Knoxville, Tenn., has become a point of pilgrimage for all sorts of experimental listeners: Indie classical, avant-garde jazz, ambient electronic music and post-rock are all well accounted for here. The festival will celebrate its 10th anniversary, March 21-24, overtaking nearly a dozen spaces across the city’s downtown. All are within walking distance of each other, but each is comfortable and acoustically sound enough that you’ll forget what you’re missing a few doors down. This year’s acts range from the virtuoso vocalist Theo Bleckmann (paying tribute to Kate Bush) to the radical improvisers in the Art Ensemble of Chicago to the psychedelic, soulful explorations of the rock band Spiritualized. Big Ears 2019 doubles as a 50th-anniversary celebration of ECM Records; the influential label will present 20 performances throughout the festival, featuring artists from across its eclectic roster. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO MERCE CUNNINGHAM Merce Cunningham, that marvel of a choreographer, understood that dancing meant different things to different people. In the book “Merce Cunningham: Fifty Years,” he is quoted as saying: “What to some is splendid entertainment, to others is merely tedium and fidgets; what to some seems barren, to others is the very essence of the heroic.” His entire career was a heroic act of vision and persistence. One of the most revered and revolutionary choreographers of the 20th century, Cunningham was a rule breaker who collaborated deeply with many artists, including his life partner, the composer John Cage. Their experiments involved allowing music and dance to exist separately, as well as introducing the concept of chance as a creative device. In 2019, the year of his centennial, Cunningham — who died at 90 in 2009 — is being celebrated all over the world with performances, workshops, talks, screenings and more. “The ideas are still very much alive and relevant and exciting and creative,” Ken Tabachnick, the executive director of the Merce Cunningham Trust, said. “Every time I see something again, I’m just amazed at how relevant it is. It could have been made yesterday.” That is one of the important points that Mr. Tabachnick and Trevor Carlson — a trustee and the producer of the Trust’s celebration of the centennial — hope to impart with the multi-tentacled celebration. Events continue all year and are updated on the Trust’s website, but one highlight is just around the corner: “Night of 100 Solos: A Centennial Event,” on April 16, Cunningham’s birthday. Three cities — London (at the Barbican), New York (at the Brooklyn Academy of Music) and Los Angeles (at the Center for the Art of Performance at U.C.L.A.) — will stage Events, the name that Cunningham gave to performances that featured fragments of works from his repertory. (Events date to 1964.) “We’re looking to continue Merce’s tradition of doing things that hadn’t been done before,” Mr. Carlson said. “We wanted to make the largest Event ever made.” In the spirit of the new, none of the performers — including the New York City Ballet principal Sara Mearns, the Martha Graham dancer PeiJu Chien-Pott and the choreographers Kyle Abraham and Vicky Shick — are former Cunningham dancers. Those dancers are involved, however, in staging the solos. (Cunningham’s company, according to his wishes, disbanded after his death and a legacy tour.) “We wanted to signal that the Cunningham legacy has a future for people who never experienced Cunningham,” Mr. Tabachnick said. “So you’ll see ballet dancers, you’ll see dancers who are not classically or rigorously trained, you’ll see younger dancers and older dancers. And that is to show the diversity and breadth of the possibilities for the legacy.” Events are piling up, and include a Cunningham celebration at the Joyce Theater (April 17-21) featuring Compagnie CNDC-Angers/Robert Swinston, Ballet West and the Washington Ballet. Amid the excitement, Mr. Carlson has a problem. It’s a good one. “It’s wild, but I’m afraid we might have to expand the amount of time of the centennial in order to include everyone who wants to be included,” he said. “I think we’re going to see ourselves extending to what would have been Merce’s 101st birthday.” GIA KOURLAS DANCE THEATER OF HARLEM Dance Theater of Harlem has never been just another ballet troupe. It was created, in 1969, as a hopeful reaction to hope-crushing circumstances. The assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was among the spurs to action, but the principal problem in need of addressing was longstanding and continuing: the dearth of opportunities for ballet dancers who were not white. “You can’t do this,” these dancers were told by the world in many ways. Dance Theater of Harlem told them they could, and then proved it to the world. The survival of this institution for 50 years deserves a big celebration. With the death of its trailblazing founding director, Arthur Mitchell, in September, the anniversary festivities have also become memorials. In recent decades the company has valiantly struggled with diminished funds, and its New York season at City Center (April 10, 12-13) isn’t as grand as one might wish. Such signatures pieces as “Agon,” “Firebird” and “Creole Giselle” return only in excerpts. But it’s appropriate that one of Mr. Mitchell’s works (“Tones”) is being revived, and Robert Garland, the troupe’s underrecognized resident choreographer, is presenting a premiere. However these turn out, the occasion is major. BRIAN SEIBERT PAM TANOWITZ When Emma Portner, known for her video dances, withdrew from a New York City Ballet commission, the company turned to Pam Tanowitz. The circumstances are hardly ideal, but here’s a one-word reaction: Finally. Ms. Tanowitz, whose new ballet will be unveiled at the company’s spring gala on May 2, has been making dances since 1992. Celebrated for her ability to mix classical and contemporary vocabulary within a framework of formal structures, she will expand a piece set to Bartok’s String Quartet No. 5 that she created during a choreographic workshop at American Ballet Theater in 2017. It’s not the prolific Ms. Tanowitz’s only new dance this season: In April, she presents a work at the Martha Graham Dance Company; another commission, from Paul Taylor American Modern Dance, will have its premiere at the Orchestra of St. Luke’s Bach Festival in June, the same month she presents a new work for her company and the City Ballet dancers Sara Mearns and Taylor Stanley at the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council’s River to River Festival. And on March 22, she will land in Cleveland to stage a site-specific work at Pilgrim Congregational Church for her company along with local dancers. “Recital #1 (five small dances for Cleveland)” is an experiment: She’s looking at ways to reimagine her repertory. GIA KOURLAS LIGIA LEWIS Every so often, New Yorkers catch a glimpse of the choreographer Ligia Lewis, who spends much of her time in Berlin. Her brief visits, which in recent years have been high points of the American Realness festival, are not to be missed. Capping the refusal-themed “No Series” at Performance Space New York, Ms. Lewis will present “minor matter” and “Water Will (in Melody),” two parts of a triptych that began in 2014 with the spare and piercing “Sorrow Swag.” Each work in the trilogy corresponds to a color, teasing out its associations: blue, red and white. (“Sorrow Swag” featured a lone male performer enveloped in blue light.) First seen in New York at Abrons Arts Center, where three indefatigable dancers (Ms. Lewis included) seemed almost to topple the theater walls, “minor matter” (red) returns May 21-22. Exploring the space between love and rage — and the relationship between blackness and the black-box theater — it stages a kind of tangled collective struggle, in which the people onstage could be conspiring with or against one another, maybe both at once. The final part, “Water Will (in Melody),” May 28-29, flirts with melodrama and catastrophe, which sounds like a fitting end. SIOBHAN BURKE "
5c8518bf49f0eacbf105c4b8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/10/movies/don-shirley-david-hajdu-green-book.html,"Like Mahershala Ali as he accepted the best supporting actor Oscar for his portrayal of the pianist Donald Shirley in the best picture winner “Green Book,” I always, or almost always, called him Dr. Shirley. He instructed me to do so within a few minutes of our first conversation, in December 1992, and I honored his wishes in the dozen or so long and unruly talks we had over nearly 10 years. Though I can’t speak directly to the accuracy of “Green Book” — I wasn’t part of the events depicted in the film — I came to know Dr. Shirley well in the 1990s, and the man I knew was considerably different from the character Ali portrayed with meticulous elegance. Cerebral but disarmingly earthy, mercurial, self-protective, and intolerant of imperfections in all things, particularly music, he was as complex and uncategorizable as his sui generis music. I approached him at the suggestion of the arranger and composer Luther Henderson, for insight into their mutual friend Billy Strayhorn, whom I was researching for my 1996 biography of Strayhorn, “Lush Life.” Henderson phoned him at the end of one of our interviews, while the tape recorder was still running, and said, “F.B.!” Henderson laughed, looked my way and winked. “I have a boy here who’s writing a book about Swee’ Pea,” he said. “Give him the real story, and try to behave yourself.” Henderson laughed some more, chatted awhile, hung up, and told me Dr. Shirley said I should write a proper letter of introduction and mail it to him care of Carnegie Hall. I asked Henderson what he meant by “F.B.” He said those were initials for his nickname for Shirley, “Funky Butt,” and recommended I use a less informal term of address. When Dr. Shirley received my letter he phoned me, correcting me for addressing him in the correspondence as “Mr. Shirley.” His first name, he added for the record, was Donald. He “despised” the familiar Don, he said, because he considered it “vulgar.” I replied that I understood and promised not to ask what “F.B.” stood for. After a pause, he barked, “Fine,” and invited me to his home that evening. As “Green Book” shows, Dr. Shirley had been living for decades in one of the magisterial studios above Carnegie Hall. He greeted me in casual finery: billowing, satiny pants and beaded slippers, with an intricate carved medallion dangling over a white turtleneck. He had a plate of cheese and crackers, and a bottle of sparkling apple juice set up on a small table. I soaked in the faded opulence of the space, a gallery of art objects and knickknacks collected over a lifetime of world travel, lit solely by early evening light pouring through windows overlooking West 57th Street. In the center of the room, there was a nine-foot Steinway concert grand piano, and alongside it, an industrial humidifier for the preservation of the instrument. I requested permission to record our conversation, and Dr. Shirley held up an index finger to mime “Hold on a minute.” Before he would agree to speak on the record, he needed to evaluate my competence as a musician, he said, instructing me take a seat on the piano bench and play something of my choice for him. While I can read music, with effort, and play almost serviceable rock-band piano, I don’t consider myself worthy of polishing a Steinway concert grand. I tried to explain that I thought of scholarship, rather than musicianship, as the discipline relevant to my purpose with him, and demurred with feigned gratitude for the opportunity. Immovable on the matter, Dr. Shirley clapped his hands twice quickly, as if to signal the start of an imperial amusement. I took a seat at the piano and plunked my way through a semblance of “One for My Baby (and One More for the Road),” the only standard I could think of that’s close enough to a 12-bar blues for me to fake. “Wellll ...” Dr. Shirley said. “You don’t know what the hell you’re doing. I can’t imagine what we could possibly talk about.” I asked if he could apply his obvious expertise to the subject of my research, Billy Strayhorn, and his collaborator and sponsor, Duke Ellington, and we were set for the evening. I had to wrap things up mid-conversation because I had brought only two 90-minute tapes. Dr. Shirley could expound with deep authority and even deeper passions on the subject of music — or, I soon learned, on the subjects of human psychology, American society, politics, cuisine, fine art, folk art, commercial art ... whatever struck him as suitable for exposition at the moment. The second time we met in his studio, he cut me off after about an hour and said: “All you want to talk about is Billy Strayhorn. Is that the only thing you care about?” Clearly well read and gifted with extraordinary capacities for recall and synthetic analysis, he had a seemingly inexhaustible body of knowledge at ready disposal and fierce opinions about everything. “The intellectual curiosity of creative people is something always present,” he told me. “It’s not something you go out one night and come home with, like the damn clap.” Erudite and salty in roughly equal measures, he once broke down the musical structure of Rachmaninoff’s “Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini” in eloquent detail, adding that “it was employed in the score of ‘The Red Shoes,’ but nobody hears it because they’re too busy staring at the girl’s legs.” After about a year, I ran out of things to ask him about Strayhorn and Ellington, but we continued to get together in his studio for conversation and cheese and crackers. He did nearly all the talking, though his talk shifted easily into ranting, often screaming, sometimes in objection to things I did or said. He loathed the magazine I was working for, Entertainment Weekly, while I researched my book, though he never once read it — on principle, he said — and conflated it with the puffy TV series “Entertainment Tonight.” For the first several years of our friendship — and I did come to see it as a friendship, because there was no longer business in it — I served as president of the Duke Ellington Society, a hybrid study group and fan club, and Dr. Shirley found the idea of the organization offensive. “It’s idol worship,” he said. “It’s uncivilized. You need to resign immediately!” (I did not.) I saw his fiery temper as an outgrowth of his stalwart sense of right and wrong. To me, it seemed of a piece with the exquisite sensitivity of his musicianship. One afternoon in September 1993, I interviewed the choreographer Talley Beatty, who had collaborated with Strayhorn and Ellington, and he asked me if I had talked to Donald Shirley. Indeed, I told him, I saw him fairly regularly. Beatty suggested we go together to Dr. Shirley’s studio that evening, because he wanted to hear him play Scriabin. A few hours later, I was sitting with Beatty as Dr. Shirley played the Scriabin Prelude No. 15 in D flat (from Op. 11), for us. At the conclusion, Beatty and I were both so shaken by the beauty of the music that we were on the brink of tears. Dr. Shirley looked at us and said: “Get yourselves together. This isn’t a damn wake!” For all his freewheeling pontificating, there were a few subjects Dr. Shirley refused to discuss. He would never tell me where he earned his Ph.D., but would say only that he had three advanced degrees from various institutions. There were aspects of his private life, as well, that he discussed with me strictly on the condition that I would not quote him on these matters by name. Not long after my biography of Strayhorn was published, the film rights were optioned, and the columnist Liz Smith published an item noting that Denzel Washington would make an excellent Ellington. The next time I visited Dr. Shirley, I told him the news and asked him how he would feel about being portrayed on screen. “Damn foolishness,” he said. “I want nothing to do with it!” "
5c79030849f0eacbf105ad49,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/01/arts/music/american-composers-leon-botstein.html,"The composer Vivian Fine wrote acclaimed dance scores for Martha Graham and José Limón; brash, skillfully constructed orchestral pieces; and a raft of unusual chamber works. And if you’ve never heard of her, you’re not alone. Fine, who died in 2000, is among a sizable group of American composers from the middle of the 20th century who remain inexplicably overlooked today. Consider this: Though Fine taught for years at the Juilliard School and New York University, the New York Philharmonic has never performed her music. What explains this neglect? It might be collateral damage from a period when American composers squared off in opposing stylistic camps. On one side were those whose complex modernist languages involved various atonal and serial methods. On the other were self-described “postmodern” composers, who experimented with minimalism and found common ground with rock, jazz and ethnic music. As the polemics raged on, a large number of composers — including Fine, Walter Piston, Vincent Persichetti, Roy Harris, Harold Shapero and others — occupied a kind of neo-Classical middle ground. They continued using essentially tonal languages and tried to reinvigorate classical forms with fresh harmonic and rhythmic techniques. But they were perceived, especially by serialists based in universities who claimed the intellectual high ground, as dated and irrelevant. Many of these composers, though, brought well-honed skills, artistic integrity and a touch of American feistiness to their music. Conductors like Leonard Slatkin, Gerard Schwarz, Marin Alsop and others have tried to bring attention to them, to little avail. Last month Leon Botstein, who has tirelessly worked to bring to light worthy scores by neglected composers, led his American Symphony Orchestra at Carnegie Hall in the New York premiere of Fine’s Concertante for Piano and Orchestra (1944), with the accomplished pianist Charlie Albright as soloist, part of a program devoted to overlooked mid-20th-century American works. I knew some of Fine’s works, but not this bracing 17-minute piece in two movements. Though in her early years, Fine composed in a dissonance-saturated language of hard-edged contours and jagged counterpoint, she mellowed as she matured. This piece, an outlier, adopts a deliberately neo-Classical, almost neo-Baroque idiom and abounds in contrasts: Lacy, lyrical passages for piano often lead to stretches of tangled, industrious counterpoint; warm, rich string sonorities segue into flinty, brassy harmonies. The restless, spirited second movement is intoxicating. I especially love the moody first movement, especially a pensive, near-atonal episode about six minutes in. For more than 30 years, Piston was a respected music professor at Harvard. He literally wrote the book on harmony, a textbook still in use today. Yet his music came to be perceived, unfairly, as well made but a little, well, professorial. This great 25-minute viola concerto is just one of many Piston scores that should enter the repertory. During a meditative opening episode, the viola wanders lyrically atop clear-textured modal harmonies, until the music presses the opening melodic motif into service as a building block for the animated main section, rich with intricate interplay between soloist and orchestra. Amid brass fanfares, the finale takes off like some frenetic rondo, though metric dislocations and out-of-nowhere restrained passages keep you off guard. The slow middle movement is the most beguiling, a neo-Romantic Adagio with an intensely soulful viola theme cushioned by soft, wistful strings. This concerto could fill the slot on orchestra programs that typically goes to Mozart or Beethoven. Piston’s piece occupies a 1950s American version of the same neighborhood. In 1948, Aaron Copland wrote of his younger colleague  Shapero that “few musicians of our time put their pieces together with greater security,” adding that Shapero’s technical adroitness serves “a wonderfully spontaneous musical gift.” No work exemplifies this more than his 45-minute Symphony for Classical Orchestra. Leonard Bernstein conducted the premiere in 1948 with the Boston Symphony Orchestra. In 1953, he also led a recording, made on a single, hectic day while he was suffering from a fever. Though a little shaky, the recorded performance is exhilarating. Beethoven’s Seventh, slyly quoted at one point, was a model for Shapero’s piece, which opens with an elusive Adagio, all flickering chords and sustained sonorities, that shifts into a bustling, densely contrapuntal Allegro. A tenderly lyrical yet quizzical slow movement leads to a misbehaving scherzo, and then a herculean finale. André Previn had a triumph with the piece at the Los Angeles Philharmonic in the late 1980s and later recorded it. Though Mr. Botstein led a performance in 2016, this demanding piece mostly languishes today. American orchestras planning yet another run-through of Beethoven’s Seventh might instead take a crack as Shapero’s masterpiece. Dello Joio, born in New York, probably thought the future of this piece was assured when it was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Music in 1957. Alas, it’s all but disappeared. I last heard it performed by the Boston University Symphony Orchestra in the late 1970s. The string writing somehow remains shimmering and transparent even when sonorities turn thick and textures gnarly. The interplay between darkly contemplative music, as in the piercing “To everything there is a season” opening movement, and quixotic episodes, like the spirited “…and a time to dance and to laugh…,” is so deftly handled you hang on every shift. Of late, there has been a welcome renewal of interest in the Boston-born Irving Fine (no relation to Vivian). A splendid 2015 recording by the Boston Modern Orchestra Project drew fresh attention to his works. The album opens with his first completed orchestra score, the ebullient and impish Toccata Concertante (1947), a piece that could become a surefire concert opener for orchestras. His later, skittish, tartly modernist scores skillfully combine neo-Classical structures with a vigorous but free use of 12-tone techniques, as in the final movement of his 1962 Symphony, generally considered Fine’s major statement. He led a performance of the symphony at Tanglewood in 1962 just days before his death at 47. Yes, I know: Barber is hardly neglected. His Adagio for Strings is world-famous. But why is his darkly neo-Romantic and teeming Piano Concerto almost never performed these days? At its 1962 premiere by the Boston Symphony, with John Browning as soloist, which helped inaugurate what was then called Philharmonic Hall at Lincoln Center, the piece “made a decided hit with the audience,” Harold C. Schonberg of The New York Times reported, adding that it may be that Barber “has supplied a repertory piece.” Listen, and you’ll hear why. It ends with a demonic finale, full of pummeling chords and frenetic energy. Though Thomson completed this piece in 1928, it did not have its official premiere until 1945, when he conducted it with the New York Philharmonic. The piece can seem a dizzying assemblage built from distinctive musical chunks: evocations of old-time hymn-singing; a kind of spare, modal melodic writing that Thomson called his “Missouri plainchant” style; fractured fanfares and down-home-marches; faux-serious bursts of counterpoint. The musical language can be unabashedly brash and dissonant one moment, defiantly diatonic the next. Yet in a good performance it comes across as an inspired, if iconoclastic, entity, and somehow exuberantly “American” — whatever that means. No surprise: Mr. Botstein led the last performance I know of in New York, which was recorded live. May he keep up the fight for neglected 20th-century Americans. "
5c890d4349f0eacbf105cd55,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/13/arts/dance/temptations-sergio-trujillo.html,"Five handsome men, dressed sharp. Golden-voiced singers, each distinctly soulful, harmonizing on hit after hit. That they could also move well, smoothly executing snazzy, classy choreography, might have seemed extra. Yet it was essential to what made the Temptations exceptional and enduring. Think about it: Does anyone dance quite the way they did anymore? Not really. Not even the extremely talented cast of “Ain’t Too Proud: The Life and Times of the Temptations,” which opens at the Imperial Theater on Broadway on March 21. Times change. The past can never be wholly recaptured. Those are themes in this jukebox musical, which tells the story of the Temptations from the perspective of Otis Williams, the sole surviving original member (and an executive producer of the show). And deep in the second act, when consequences and regrets are starting to pile up, the actor playing Mr. Williams (Derrick Baskin) says, “Don’t nothing rewind but a song.” Change can be lamented or embraced. Sergio Trujillo, the choreographer of “Ain’t Too Proud,” is the embracing type. “It was important to me,” he said before a recent preview performance, “that an audience that knows the Temptations is able to watch the show and think, ‘That’s what I remember.’ But it’s also important to look through the lens of today.” The question he asked himself was: “If I were choreographing for the Temptations now, what would I do?” What he did was create choreography that is more intricate, stylistically varied and narratively sophisticated than anything the Temptations ever approached. All the characteristic slides and pivots and gestures in relay are in there, but amid a whole lot more. So while “Ain’t Too Proud” honors the past, it also brings out differences between dancing in Motown back then and dancing on Broadway now. The Temptations were not trained dancers. At first, they didn’t think of themselves as dancers at all. “We would just stand and sing, or sit and sing,” Mr. Williams, 77, recalled over the phone. The show has fun with this fact in an early scene. Paul Williams (no relation to Otis Williams) tries to get the other guys to dance in their act and they resist, claiming they can’t. He has to convince them that the ladies will like it. Paul Williams, who died in 1973, did give the Temptations their first moves. In 1965, though, they started working with a professional choreographer: Cholly Atkins. He is not a character in “Ain’t Too Proud.” But that omission, presumably for narrative economy, has some historical justification. In his 2001 autobiography, “Class Act” (written with Jacqui Malone), Mr. Atkins says that Motown artists were often told to say that they did their own choreography. He was part of the behind-the-scenes operation. That operation was called Artist Development, and it was a critical component in the vision of Motown’s founder, Berry Gordy. “Berry always wanted Motown artists to be more than recording artists,” said Shelly Berger, who became the Temptations manager in 1966. (He’s a creative consultant for “Ain’t Too Proud,” as well as a character in it.) And so the people hired for Artist Development were show-business veterans, there to teach the kids how to become versatile entertainers. Mr. Atkins was a tap dancer. Born in 1913, he came of age when tap, a sibling of jazz, was at its cultural peak — ubiquitous in nightclubs, Broadway shows and Hollywood musicals. As a black man, Mr. Atkins found little success in segregated Hollywood; he dubbed tap sounds for white dancers, gave ideas to Eleanor Powell. But in New York, with Honi Coles, a virtuoso once considered to have the fastest feet in the business, he formed a great partnership. Mr. Coles and Atkins were in the tradition known as the class act: suave, debonair, cultivated. They sang a little, told jokes, and danced in several styles. Their soft-shoe was recklessly slow, a nonchalant tightrope walk of graceful control and rhythmic exactitude.They toured with the big bands of Cab Calloway and Count Basie. They appeared on Broadway in “Gentlemen Prefer Blondes.” But by then, the early 1950s, tap was falling out of fashion. It got a shove from the rise of rock ‘n’ roll and rhythm and blues. At places like the Apollo Theater in Harlem, a home for tap, R&B revues took over. Coles became the theater’s production manager, appalled by the teenagers with hit records and no understanding of theatrical etiquette as basic as how to bow. Mr. Atkins began to teach them. Before long, word got around, especially when people caught what Mr. Atkins had done with Gladys Knight and the Pips. He was 30 years older than they were, and they called him Pop or Pops, names that stuck when Motown hired him as its official choreographer. “Pops refined the Temptations,” Otis Williams recalled. “What he did was dramatic but more economic, so we wouldn’t overly exert ourselves but still could get across.” Mr. Atkins called this technique “vocal choreography,” an art of moving for vocalists. It was dancing that accommodated a singer’s need to breathe and to get back to the microphone on time. In the right spots, it could be complex — feet following the bass line as voices sang a different rhythm. “But Pops would always stress, ‘Remember you guys are singers first,’” Mr. Williams said. Mr. Atkins was a taskmaster (“like a drill sergeant,” Mr. Berger said), but he adjusted to the skills of each group. “Let the punishment fit the crime” was his motto. The Four Tops didn’t get much more than some windshield-wiper bending. The Pips and the Supremes and the Temptations got the works. They were being groomed for “the smart rooms,” Mr. Williams said: supper clubs like the Copacabana, places where few black acts were invited. Along with their hits, they sang standards, and Mr. Atkins taught them routines with hats and canes. You can see the results in “TCB,” the Temptations’ 1968 television special with the Supremes, and especially on their 1969 special, “G.I.T. On Broadway,” an hour of nothing but show tunes. Every time one of Mr. Atkins’s groups appeared on television — on Ed Sullivan, “American Bandstand,” “Shindig,” “Soul Train” — they were spreading the tap and jazz steps he had learned when he was young, keeping those moves in cultural circulation as another generation picked them up from TV. He continued to choreograph for the Temptations until his death in 2003. By then, the group’s roster had turned over many times (there have been more than 20 Temptations). And the way the Temptations danced, once so current, had become a period style. It was around that time that Mr. Trujillo, born in Colombia in 1963, began choreographing “Jersey Boys,” the 2005 jukebox musical about the Four Seasons. For research, he studied videos of the old TV shows, footage of all the old groups. Since the Four Seasons didn’t move much, he had a free hand. “What I created,” he said, “was like the Temptations more than anything.” “Ain’t Too Proud” came with different pressures: “Can I live up to the legend of these great performers known for their dancing?” he asked himself. “With the confidence of having done other shows of the period” — “All Shook Up,” “Memphis” — “I let myself create with abandonment.” First, though, he wanted to earn the audience’s trust. And so the opening number of “Ain’t Too Proud” (“The Way You Do the Things You Do”) is very old school. Some of the lyrics are pantomimed baldly (opening the schoolbook), and when the narrator affectionately mocks those lyrics for corniness, he could be speaking of the choreography, too. Immediately after, the simplicity recedes. For Mr. Trujillo is tasked, as Cholly Atkins never was, with helping to tell a story, the plot of how the Temptations got together and what they went through. And over the course of the show, as the group’s music changes, getting funky or psychedelic, responding to the riots and assassinations of the late 1960s, the dancing also changes, turning harder-edged, angrier, more technically and emotionally complex. Throughout, the base style — “sprinkled with period authenticity,” in Mr. Trujillo’s words — tilts contemporary: sharper, bolder in attack. The Supremes in this show pop their hips with much more sexual frankness than the demure originals would have been allowed. Mr. Trujillo is also working with a different kind of performer. Ephraim Sykes, who plays David Ruffin — one of the group’s lead singers — trained at the Alvin Ailey school and danced in the junior Ailey troupe. He has mastered some of Mr. Ruffin’s signature moves: splits; tossing a microphone in the air, spinning, dropping to his knees and catching the mic. But he also does much that Mr. Ruffin never attempted. “I try to push my body as far as it can go,” Mr. Sykes said. “But also, how cool can I make it? That’s period for me. You didn’t see them try. Even the tricks I do that David never did, I’m trying to keep it so cool that it looks like David could’ve done them.” Dancing that hard and still having to sing as well as David Ruffin isn’t nearly as easy as Mr. Sykes makes it look. “Singers and dancers are taught to breath in opposite ways,” he said, one relaxing where the other tightens. “I’m trying to use my dance training with a singer’s mind.” Part of that dance training is in communicating with the body. “How they walked, how they stood, the pride of the city of Detroit, the bop in their step — it says so much about their times,” Mr. Sykes said. In “Ain’t Too Proud,” even when the Temptations aren’t doing a dance number — in scenes between Otis Williams and his wife, for example — the five men are often present onstage like a cool Greek chorus. Their physical presence shows how they were always in one another’s thoughts. That’s the kind of metaphor present nowhere in the choreography of Cholly Atkins. But what it looks like is five guys snapping and lightly swaying, as Cholly Atkins taught the Temptations to do. "
5c33a3ac3a125f5075c03368,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/07/arts/music/prototype-festival-448-psychosis-prism-thistree.html,"Opera is an art form of affliction. It’s a genre that has long made a specialty of giving trauma stature and structure. But even by that standard, the marquee productions of this year’s Prototype, the festival of new music-theater that sprawls throughout the city and runs through Sunday, are extreme. There are scenes in “Prism,” “ThisTree” and especially “4.48 Psychosis” of almost cataclysmic suffering, the kind of pain that lingers without reason or resolution. “4.48” is an adaptation of the final work by Sarah Kane, the British playwright who died in 1999. A fragmented, incantatory immersion in clinical depression, filled with descriptions of psychotropic drugs, sets of numbers, angry rants and stark wordplay, the script specifies neither characters nor precise plot, nor even the number of performers. Seen on the page, the words scattered amid expanses of white, it can seem more like modernist poetry than theater. It is, in other words, as easily made into a score as into anything. In his opera, which had its premiere with the Royal Opera in London in 2016, the composer Philip Venables has found in Kane’s material a landscape of iciness and sensitivity, in which speaking and singing flow into one another with uncanny ease. Six women — one a loosely defined protagonist, the others her echoes and tormentors — chant and babble in shifting configurations, sometimes glassy and sometimes full-cry. Faint drones of organ (produced by synthesizer) rise to Grand Guignol surges, helped along by accordion. Heavily amplified, almost cartoonish stomping, heavy on low brass, gives way to coolly rending lyricism, like a Baroque lament by John Dowland, thinly frosted by violins playing in their highest register. The score, played here by the ensemble Contemporaneous under William Cole’s direction, ingeniously translates some fraught conversations between a doctor and patient into a percussion duet. Syllables are rhythmically tapped out as the words appear, projected on the set, while waiting-room Muzak plays — softly, infuriatingly — in the background. A hammer harshly clinking against a pipe, with a bell providing the question mark, is answered by despairing deep thwacks of fists on a drum: Mr. Venables gives us wit, hostility and poignancy, all at once. Ted Huffman’s clean yet passionate, intimate production adds, intentionally or not, a newly bitter element. The main performer, Gweneth-Ann Rand, is black, and the other five women are white, giving their relentless persecution of her yet another facet of horror. All in all, this “4.48” avoids neither the text’s moments of pitch-black humor nor its passages of luminous air; it doesn’t prettify Kane, nor does it make her brutality unendurable. Elegantly ferocious, it is this unclassifiable play as music. “Prism” (the creators make the title lowercase and place spaces between its letters) is also an attempt to depict the brutality of interior life. Its first act poses an intriguing mystery: What is this strange scene? A mother and her daughter, dressed in white, are locked in an immaculately clean room — outside of which some strange force, referred to as Blue, threatens. The daughter seems to have a progressive wasting illness that has left her with barely any use of her legs. Together they repeat lines of seeming nonsense — Roxie Perkins’s libretto is full of the ominously capitalized words of dystopian fiction — and follow eerily precise rules as they try to cure the daughter’s illness. Ellen Reid’s score is accessible in the best way, disconcertingly sweet without being syrupy, with occasional whispers of choral voices so soft they’re almost more odor than sound. The truly prismatic Choir of Trinity Wall Street is astonishing here; Trinity’s new-music ensemble, Novus NY, plays beautifully under Julian Wachner. It’s a haunting beginning, but the next acts answer its questions too literally. Jumping back in time, we learn that the daughter, Bibi (Anna Schubert), was raped after being left alone at a dance club by her mother, Lumee (Rebecca Jo Loeb), the aftermath of which is rendered as painful pricks of sound and the barest noise of voices breathing. In a violent reaction of remorse and PTSD, they retreat together into a messy rat hole — the reality of the pristine idyll we saw at the start — in a grimly ineffectual attempt at healing. The question: Can Bibi escape the regressive world her mother has invented to protect her? James Darrah’s staging is striking, with the locked room a frightening terrarium and the club a sea of low-hanging disco balls. But visual elegance can’t take away from the fact that that thumping club scene and the rushed-feeling finale come off as letdowns after Ms. Reid and Ms. Perkins’s spookily suggestive opening. Leah Coloff’s “ThisTree” is mellower than “Prism” and “4.48 Psychosis,” but still unstinting. A cellist, composer and vocalist, Ms. Coloff leads a six-woman band in what is, at heart, a cabaret show: a series of memoir monologues alternating with folky, bluesy numbers sung in her sometimes feathery, sometimes husky, sometimes warbly voice. She intertwines her family’s pioneer past and the parentage secrets it kept with an account of her struggles with infertility. This is forbidding stuff, but Ms. Coloff’s touch is light, her presence warm. She’s not sentimental — and idiosyncratic touches, like a giant red bonnet, an enormous hand-stitched denim cape and tough-to-pin-down lyrics, keep things helpfully weird — but she isn’t unemotional. She is, simply, honest. These aren’t the only productions in this year’s Prototype, presented by Beth Morrison Projects and the arts center HERE. “Pancho Villa From a Safe Distance,” composed by Graham Reynolds and with a libretto by the collective Lagartijas Tiradas al Sol, is a cozy, bilingual, semistaged oratorio for two singers (including the soaringly sweet tenor Paul Sanchez) and a rollicking roadhouse band. Reflections on the famous revolutionary’s life and death — and, pointedly, on the gringos who watched the war in which he took part from the safe distance of the title — are interspersed with quietly riveting footage of interviews with a Mexican teenager who claims to have heard voices urging him to immerse himself in Villa’s story. Written and directed by Michael Joseph McQuilken, “The Infinite Hotel,” a shotgun marriage of “A Star Is Born” and a ghost story, is an ambitiously busy show that fills the Irondale Center in Brooklyn with cameras and screens. (You may think of Ivo van Hove’s signature style of self-reflexive multimedia explosion.) Some of the audience watches from above, with the sound mix coming through headphones. Some participate as extras — directed in real time — in the filming of the production, which results in a unique feature-length creation from each performance. Often sounding uncannily like Lady Gaga, Leah Siegel sings with earthy rock authority as a subway singer-songwriter turned arena sensation. But all the technical bells and whistles, while smoothly produced, ultimately feel less like integral elements than a distraction from stock characters and a thin, overlong plot. “The Infinite Hotel” ends with the mawkish spectacle of a dead father holding his daughter. “4.48 Psychosis” closes with apocalypse — and inevitably, for all of us who see it now, with thoughts of Kane’s actual suicide. “ThisTree” concludes with moving modesty: the simple recognition that this is how things are. And does Bibi escape at the end of “Prism”? In a culture so single-mindedly focused on personal empowerment and victory over victimization, how could she not? But this rings false. Opera doesn’t need its heroines merely to suffer. But it needs their victories to feel genuine rather than tacked on. "
5ca7278449f0eacbf1f811d6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/05/arts/music/george-walker-sinfonia-visions-seattle-symphony.html,"SEATTLE — Last fall, the Smithsonian’s National Portrait Gallery began to display, among its recent acquisitions, a photograph of the composer George Walker. It shows him close up, his right index finger and thumb bearing down on a pencil with the precision of a surgeon, at work on the manuscript score of his Sinfonia No. 5. The image of Dr. Walker, who died last summer at the age of 96, was captured by the photographer and filmmaker Frank Schramm, a close friend. They had known each other since Mr. Schramm heard a broadcast of Dr. Walker’s Sinfonia No. 3 in 2004 and, he said, “immediately gravitated to his work.” Living within a couple of miles of Dr. Walker in New Jersey, Mr. Schramm would pay regular visits to his house in Montclair — helping out with errands and at the same time using his camera to document his life and work, right up to the end. “George was 81 when I met him, so there was already a sense of time running out,” Mr. Schramm said. “But he was so focused. We would listen to and discuss music. It became like an unsolicited master class for me.” Just two months before his death, Dr. Walker had been keenly anticipating the opportunity to experience Sinfonia No. 5, “Visions,” in a concert hall, Mr. Schramm recalled. He was looking forward to the first live performance, which will be given by the Seattle Symphony Orchestra on April 11. (A studio recording, made in 2017, is available on Albany Records.) The piece, which was completed in 2016, in part conveys Mr. Walker’s response to the 2015 shooting at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C. “He looked back and saw the other work he had done and thought this could be the last one,” said Gregory Walker, the older of Dr. Walker’s two sons. “And he felt an urgency about getting it out there.” “Visions” crowns a long career in which Dr. Walker produced more than 90 compositions, including intimate pieces for solo piano (his primary instrument), and large-scale orchestral and choral works. It was the last score he completed; at the time of his death, he had embarked on a piece commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Amid impassioned debates about the canon and its exclusion of historically marginalized voices, his remarkably individual and intricately crafted musical voice is long overdue for discovery. “George was very proficient,” Mr. Schramm said. “His house became his think-tank, with his work at the center. He knew what he had.” But it was frustrating, he added, for Dr. Walker to repeatedly face difficulty in getting orchestras to program his work. A longtime passionate advocate has been Peter Kermani, a former chairman of what is now the League of American Orchestras and the founder of Albany Records. In the mid-1980s, when he first encountered Dr. Walker’s music, he was attracted to “the lack of sweetness and treacle that a lot of American works had.” “Right from the beginning, that was a distinguishing feature of George’s music,” Mr. Kermani added. “I think he was breaking new ground. I felt he should be given every opportunity on the planet to get his music performed and heard.” The Seattle Symphony’s performance may signal the beginning of a fresh wave of interest. In 2016, Mr. Schramm recalled, Dr. Walker was encouraged by a meeting with the conductor Simon Rattle, who expressed interest in performing his music in Europe. Dr. Walker’s early “Lyric for Strings” became his first piece to be programmed at the BBC Proms when the Chineke! Orchestra performed it shortly after his death last year. During the past two decades, Mr. Kermani has released a multivolume series of Dr. Walker’s orchestral works on the Albany label, along with albums documenting the composer’s earlier career as a concert pianist. He introduced Dr. Walker to the English-born conductor and pianist Ian Hobson, a specialist in mid-20th-century American orchestral music who had made numerous recordings with the Sinfonia Varsovia of Poland. Mr. Hobson described Dr. Walker as “a composer of great integrity: uncompromising in the best sense of the word, who doesn’t pander to anything.” While still trying to place “Visions” with an orchestra, Dr. Walker arranged to have it recorded by Mr. Hobson and the Varsovia Symphony — the final installment of Mr. Hobson’s cycle of his Sinfonias, each of which is a compact, single-movement composition. (“Visions,” with a duration of about 18 minutes, is the longest of them.) “Visions” Mr. Hobson said, is “complex and built of small cells of harmonic patterns and melodic groupings,” adding that “sometimes the detail is knotty and gnarly — and deliberately so — and sometimes unexpected beauties emerge from his extremely sensitive ear for color.” Dr. Walker’s son Gregory — a teacher at the University of Colorado, Boulder, and a former concertmaster of the Boulder Philharmonic Orchestra — said that the piece, which includes spoken text, is striking for the new ground it breaks in orchestral writing. “He wasn’t worried about whether it would be comprehensible immediately,” Gregory Walker said. “It’s an idealistic vision of what this combination of music and text and imagery could achieve.” George Walker was born in 1922, into an arts-loving family in Washington. His father, an immigrant from Jamaica, ran a medical practice from their home and organized his own research groups with colleagues. (At the time, the American Medical Association didn’t grant membership to black doctors.) His mother, a singer, encouraged his precocious talent for music with piano lessons — and did the same for his younger sister, Frances Walker-Slocum, who became the first black woman granted tenure at Oberlin College. Dr. Walker started attending Oberlin at 14, focusing on piano and organ before beginning graduate studies at the Curtis Institute of Music. He envisioned a career as a concert pianist and made his debut in 1945 at Town Hall in New York, as the first black instrumental soloist there. A few weeks later, he achieved the same milestone with the Philadelphia Orchestra as the soloist in Rachmaninoff’s Third Piano Concerto. Despite critical acclaim, Dr. Walker was able to secure only a fraction of the number of engagements that came readily to his white peers. He turned instead to an academic career, while at the same time channeling his creative drive into composition. To improve his keyboard skills at Curtis, he undertook composition studies. (The title of his memoir, “Reminiscences of an American Composer and Pianist,” reflects how fundamental both identities remained for him.) Dr. Walker studied with the storied mentor Rosario Scalero, who also taught Samuel Barber, and spent a period in Paris with Nadia Boulanger. She encouraged him, and with a new focus on composition, he cultivated a distinctively laconic style purged of excess and meticulously designed from meaningful gestures. In 1996, Dr. Walker won the Pulitzer Prize for “Lilacs,” a commission from the Boston Symphony Orchestra that set portions of Walt Whitman’s Lincoln elegy “When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom’d.” But the recognition that came with that and other honors did not erase his experience of struggling to get his music heard by the public. Responding to The New York Times about the Pulitzer news, Dr. Walker revealed the boldly self-reliant attitude he had used to cope with the constant institutional roadblock of racism: “I strongly felt if I continued to press for what I hoped to achieve, I would achieve it.” Being the first black composer to win the music Pulitzer became something of a double-edged sword. Invariably, like a Homeric epithet, it has become the phrase regularly used to introduce him as a composer. “He has been advertised as this African-American statesman who is supposed to be representing all the potential that has been neglected in the black community,” Gregory Walker said, “yet doesn’t follow the trends or fit cleanly into any category of contemporary music.” George Walker’s guiding philosophy, his son added, was that everyone is an individual, and his music was “proof of how individual things can be.” “He saw himself as an extension of great artists of the past, using their compositional techniques, idioms, instruments and aesthetics — and his love of Beethoven and Romantic-era composers,” Gregory Walker said. “He transformed all of that into something that was himself.” Not a programmatic composer by inclination, George Walker began work on “Visions” before the Charleston massacre occurred. But, when he learned what had happened, he became determined to introduce a layer that pays tribute to the victims. Brief, elliptical texts he wrote are assigned to five solo speakers; even though they are not sung parts, the score specifies their approximate ranges (a soprano, a tenor, two baritones and a bass). Along with these textual elements, the music includes several brief — and, in typical fashion, rather hidden — quotations from famous songs like “Drink to Me Only With Thine Eyes” and “I Dream of Jeannie,” as well as the hymn “Rock of Ages” and the spiritual “Swing Low, Sweet Chariot”). The texts are elusive, acquiring disquieting ambiguity when juxtaposed with a video that Mr. Schramm created at Dr. Walker’s request. The video, which begins about midway through “Visions,” contains images of ocean scenes filmed on the Atlantic Coast along with close-ups of photographs documenting the slave trade in Charleston. “It emphasizes the mystery that this was the same ocean that brought the slaves over,” Mr. Schramm said, “and of the past, present and future of the water, which is very dark.” During what turned out to be Dr. Walker’s final year, Elena Dubinets, the vice president of artistic planning and creative projects at the Seattle Symphony, came across interviews in which he had discussed “Visions.” When arrangements for the premiere elsewhere fell through, she expressed interest in having it in Seattle. She found a place for the piece on a program with Dvorak’s “New World” Symphony, conducted by the orchestra’s new music director, Thomas Dausgaard. “We wanted to juxtapose two very different views on our country,” Ms. Dubinets said, “a romanticized European perspective on the American culture combining different worlds into a new one that suited Euro-American colonizers, and an internal perspective coming from an African-American composer terrified by the shocking massacre in Charleston more than 120 years later.” "
5c3709963a125f5075c03af8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/10/movies/female-film-composers.html,"Composers have been hired for two forthcoming blockbusters about warrior women — “Wonder Woman 1984,” directed and co-written by Patty Jenkins, and “Mulan,” directed by Niki Caro from a screenplay by three women. The composers: Hans Zimmer and Harry Gregson-Williams. Both, plainly, dudes. More than just a missed opportunity to lend flinty female heroes a female musical voice, the announcements were simply the latest examples of women being sorely unheard in film music. A 2018 study by the University of Southern California revealed that for the top 100 fictional films at the box office every year from 2007 to 2017, only 16 female composers were hired, compared with more than 1,200 men. Another report, from the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film, showed that of the top 250 films at the domestic box office in 2018, 94 percent were scored by men. “The numbers are bleak, but the landscape isn’t,” said Laura Karpman, a veteran film composer (“Paris Can Wait”) and a governor in the music branch of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. “People are reaching out in a way that I’ve never seen it my whole career.” Karpman was instrumental in expanding the diversity of her branch’s membership, which now includes the Russian composer Sofia Gubaidulina. Karpman also spearheaded the creation of a shortlist in the score category of the Academy Awards. “Had we had a voted-upon shortlist last year, I think we would have more diversity,” she said. Citing the composers behind “Get Out” and “Mudbound,” she added, “I want to see Michael Abels and Tamar-kali on Oscar shortlists.” (Karpman spoke before the shortlist was announced in December. It includes Terence Blanchard’s score for “BlacKkKlansman” — his first Oscar nomination if he moves to the next round — but, alas, no women.) Tamar-kali is one of several new voices in a persistently white male milieu. “Mudbound,” directed by Dee Rees, was the Brooklyn artist’s first score, which she followed with the Netflix drama “Come Sunday.” She’s also reteaming with Rees for an adaptation of the Joan Didion novel “The Last Thing He Wanted.” As an Afro-indigenous woman in the New York punk rock scene, she said, she was already used to being “an outlier within the outliers.” “It just kind of fuels your creativity,” she explained. “The ethos means even more to you, because you’re practicing it every moment — even in the pit, even at shows.” Like a handful of other female artists, Tamar-kali wasn’t pursuing film composition, but was commissioned after a director heard her work. Mica Levi, a British rocker from the band formerly known as Micachu and the Shapes, was nominated for an Oscar for “Jackie,” which followed her shivering, queasy breakout score for “Under the Skin.” The Icelandic cellist-composer Hildur Gudnadottir was hired for “Sicario: Day of the Soldado” and the forthcoming “Joker,” starring Joaquin Phoenix — two patently “macho,” big-budget features — largely because of her experimental electronic solo work. “People approach me looking for a specific type of sound, or feeling,” Gudnadottir said. “They don’t come knocking on my door for, like, a John Williams score. So that also puts me in a really good position, because I’m normally allowed to be myself.” “Joker” bucks the trend of high-profile superhero films going solely to male composers, as does the coming “Captain Marvel,” starring Brie Larson. Pinar Toprak, a Turkish composer who wrote additional music for Danny Elfman on last year’s “Justice League,” is the first woman to score a Marvel film. “Music, and art in general, it’s genderless,” Toprak told me in April, “because emotions are genderless.” One of the few women who scored a major studio film in 2018 was Germaine Franco, with the R-rated bro comedy “Tag.” After assisting the Oscar-nominated John Powell for years, the Mexican-American composer drew attention for giving “Coco” much of its musical personality — she orchestrated Michael Giacchino’s score and wrote several of its songs, although she was not asked to compose the score. She’s currently working on the Tina Gordon Chism comedy, “Little,” starring Marsai Martin of “black-ish.” All of this raises the question of why most studio features — even female-centric no-brainers like the “Ghostbusters” reboot and “Ocean’s 8” — still go to men. The history of women scoring films isn’t long. The pioneer was probably Germaine Tailleferre, a French composer who co-scored a travelogue in 1926. Thirty years later, the American Bebe Barron created the avant-garde electronic sound for “Forbidden Planet” with her husband, Louis. Wendy Carlos’s seminal synthesizer album “Switched-On Bach” led to her collaborations with Stanley Kubrick on “A Clockwork Orange” and “The Shining.” Angela Morley was an Oscar-nominated composer whose credits included the 1978 animated feature “Watership Down” and the TV series “Dynasty” and “Dallas.” Shirley Walker was a pianist who helped Carmine Coppola realize his score for “Apocalypse Now,” and went on to shape scores by Elfman and Zimmer in the 1980s and ’90s as an in-demand orchestrator. Both men, classically untrained, credit her as a teacher. Walker, who died in 2006, also composed her own scores, notably “Batman: The Animated Series,” the “Final Destination” movies and the 2003 horror film “Willard.” Yet she could never break into the top-tier movies she was helping men with. “I don’t think she got in the door for the same meetings that the guys would get,” said Lolita Ritmanis, a composer who was mentored by Walker. “I wouldn’t say she was bitter. She was a fighter till the end.” The first woman to win an Oscar for best score was Rachel Portman, for “Emma” in 1996. (The only other woman to win that prize is Anne Dudley, for “The Full Monty” the next year.) The film industry, Portman said, “tends to be quite cautious.” She added that directors feel more comfortable with composers who have “done something really similar-sounding before — which immediately makes it very difficult to break in. And also this feeling that there’s safety if someone else has hired someone before, which I think is particularly hard for women.” She said she had worked with only two openly misogynistic directors, and noted the occasional “delicious challenge” of a filmmaker presuming she’s not capable of writing “tough music” — that is, for action scenes or anything in a mode not stereotypically feminine. “I’m like, are you kidding? And I’ll just prove to them that I can.” The women interviewed for this article offered a variety of reasons for the longstanding inequality: institutionalized sexism; a lack of precedents and female role models to inspire girls to go into the field; and the social conditioning of women to be selfless caretakers and not seize the spotlight. Increasingly, women are entering the profession, but are still outnumbered by men. The film scoring certificate program at the University of California, Los Angeles has produced 120 graduates since 2013, of which only 25 percent were female. Likewise, only a quarter of applicants to the film scoring graduate program at U.S.C. this year were female — although the school invited seven women to join its 20-student program. (Portman suggested that universities pumping so many aspiring composers into such a small competitive field might itself be a problem.) Several workshops — including the Sundance Institute Film Music Program, which has achieved gender parity the past two years, and the Ascap Film Scoring Workshop — are trying to provide more women with real-world experience and access to the industry. Universal Pictures started its Film Music Composer Initiative to find talented women and people of color. Winning candidates are writing orchestral scores — and running recording sessions at Abbey Road — for shorts created by DreamWorks Animation. Nora Kroll-Rosenbaum scored the program’s first short, “Bird Karma.” She praised the initiative for providing opportunities, adding, “That door has been very much shut for a lot of people.” There are also new resources for support. The Alliance for Women Film Composers was founded in 2014, and now has close to 400 members. It has raised the visibility of women through concerts and advocacy work, and provides solidarity in a lonely profession with no formal union. “It’s a sisterhood, it’s a resource,” said Ritmanis, president of the alliance. “And although we are very much competitors, we are also each others’ cheerleaders.” “I think because of the global awareness of women’s rights, and #MeToo, and Time’s Up and all these different movements,” she added, “there is an interest and a call to action” among studios and decision makers. “People call me wanting to meet and figure out what they can do, and I do think that there’s a lot more opportunity for women to be part of the big audition process” for major feature assignments. As there should be, given their talent, said Doreen Ringer-Ross, an executive in the film music division of Broadcast Music Inc., the performing rights organization which manages the catalogs of many of Hollywood’s top composers. “The job of a composer is to be really sensitive, is to interpret the emotion of things, musically,” she said. “And women are traditionally great at doing that.” Still, emerging composers face a double standard. Jesi Nelson has been apprenticing with several male composers as she develops her own career, and she’s dealt with potential bosses commenting about her legs or musicians assuming that she’s somebody’s personal assistant when she’s actually running a recording session. “I do get angry, and sometimes I’m just like, what’s the point?” Nelson said. “If I’m working these ridiculous hours — seven days a week, 18-hour days — and it’s paying off for somebody to diminish everything that I’ve worked hard for in a few words based on my gender, like, why am I even doing this? But I love it way too much, so I won’t stop.” "
5c3b1a383a125f5075c04240,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/13/arts/music/mute-r-kelly.html,"He has been accused of having sex with minors. At 27, he married a 15-year-old girl. Some women say he runs an emotionally abusive sex cult. But in more than two decades of persistent allegations, the R&B star at the center of them, R. Kelly, has never been convicted of a crime, and in no meaningful way has his career suffered. The #MuteRKelly campaign to punish him legally and commercially hopes to change that, receiving new life in recent days after a widely watched Lifetime documentary, “Surviving R. Kelly,” devoted six episodes to his history with women. Prosecutors in Chicago and Atlanta have started looking into Kelly’s conduct. “He uses his talent to prey on women, to abuse us,” Asante McGee, who appeared in the documentary, said in an interview. McGee said Kelly prohibited her from looking other men in the eye and required that she ask permission to leave her bedroom or go to the bathroom. “A regular person on the street couldn’t have gotten away with what he’s gotten away with.” [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] The documentary has had some early effect. Some radio stations have stopped playing his music, and a concert appearance in Illinois was canceled. But there are significant challenges to bringing a criminal case against Kelly, and various reasons his record label might decide to keep him on, even as calls for a reckoning grow louder. Among the longstanding allegations against Robert Kelly is that he has had sexual relationships with minors. Kelly, 52, has settled lawsuits dating back to the 1990s alleging he had sex with underage girls. More than 20 years ago, Vibe magazine questioned the validity of a marriage certificate showing that Kelly had married the singer Aaliyah when she was 18. She was actually 15, and the marriage was annulled. (Aaliyah died in a plane crash in 2001.) On ABC’s “Good Morning America” on Friday, Kelly’s lawyer, Steven Greenberg, threatened to sue Lifetime for defamation and said Kelly denied ever having a sexual relationship with someone under the age of consent. He said Kelly did not know that Aaliyah was 15 when they married. On Tuesday, Kimberly M. Foxx, the state’s attorney for Cook County, Ill., publicly asked any potential victims and witnesses to come forward, and prosecutors in Fulton County, Ga., where Kelly also has lived, have begun gathering information. Even so, any case could be difficult to try. It routinely takes people many years to come forward, by which time memories have faded and records have vanished. “These cases are hard because, typically, the crime occurs behind closed doors,” said Marci Hamilton, the founder of Child U.S.A., which proposes policies to address the sexual abuse of children. Kelly’s courtroom history might also, in a sense, raise the bar to put him on trial. In 2008, he was acquitted of child pornography charges despite a 27-minute video that prosecutors said showed him having sex with and urinating on a 13-year-old girl. But the girl in the video never testified, and Kelly’s lawyers successfully argued that her identity could not be proven. That experience could make prosecutors wary. “Sometimes there is a reluctance to go back,” said Paul Mones, a lawyer who represents victims who were abused as children. The more recent allegations against Kelly, many previously outlined by the music journalist Jim DeRogatis on BuzzFeed News, revolve around what has been described as a sex cult. Kelly is said to have exhibited almost total control over women who lived or traveled with him, dictating their movements, when they could eat and when they could go to the bathroom. Kelly’s lawyer told CBS that the women who lived with him were attracted to a “rock ’n’ roll life” and did so voluntarily. “They were perfectly consensual relationships,” Greenberg said. “Whatever occurred, I’m not someone who should be judging, nor should any of us be judging, someone’s personal relationships, what goes on in their bedrooms.” He called those who appeared on the documentary “a bunch of disgruntled people who are looking for their 15 minutes of TMZ fame.” Kelly’s accusers say he brainwashes the women into submission, but cases that involve psychological control can be exceptionally difficult to prove, lawyers say. Alan W. Scheflin, a professor emeritus at Santa Clara University School of Law, recalled a case in which someone was found to have been falsely imprisoned because their clothing was taken away and they would have had to flee naked. But he said that duress is usually considered to be something physical, like being locked in a basement. “It’s so horrible and so frustrating because there aren’t remedies focused specifically on this issue,” he said. Prosecutors can try to argue that a person is being illegally restrained when they have been threatened with harm if they leave. Federal prosecutors in New York have brought charges against the leaders of a group called Nxivm, alleging that they forced women into sexual slavery by demanding they turn over compromising material, such as sexually explicit photographs of themselves, as “collateral” that would be used against them if they left or spoke out publicly. (The leaders have also been charged with other crimes, including financial ones.) In an email, a lawyer for the group’s founder, Keith Raniere, said the government’s charges of sex trafficking and forced labor were “baseless and unprecedented.” In “Surviving R. Kelly,” a person identified as a former employee of Kelly’s said he would make women write false statements to incriminate themselves or their parents, saying they stole from him, for example. The former employee described those statements, and sex tapes Kelly recorded of the women, as a form of insurance to stop them from speaking out. Even if that were considered criminal, bringing a case is difficult without cooperating victims. The parents of one woman believed to be living with Kelly, Joycelyn Savage, say she is being held against her will, according to their lawyer, Gerald A. Griggs. But in a video interview published by TMZ in July, Savage said she was not Kelly’s captive and was “in a happy place with my life.” The Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office has said it has received calls about Kelly since Foxx made her public plea. Police officers went to Kelly’s home at Trump Tower in Chicago on Friday after receiving a tip that two women were being held there against their will. A spokeswoman for the department said two women were found who said they were there voluntarily. It is unclear what other reports the authorities have received. As public reaction to the documentary has grown, some radio stations have pledged to stop playing his music. According to Mediabase, which tracks terrestrial radio stations, plays of Kelly’s music have dropped, from more than 220 “spins” per day in recent months to less than 100 a few days after the documentary aired. And a concert Kelly was supposed to host in Springfield, Ill., in April had its application denied by the state because of security concerns spurred by anti-Kelly protests, The Chicago Tribune reported. Much attention has focused on Kelly’s record company, RCA, a division of Sony Music Entertainment. On Friday, the advocacy group UltraViolet flew a banner over RCA’s offices in Culver City, Calif., calling on the label to cancel its contract with the star. “It is long past time for RCA to dump R. Kelly and take a stand against abuse,” the group said in a statement. But neither RCA nor Sony has commented on the documentary, nor on the calls to end their relationship with Kelly. According to music industry lawyers and executives, the question of whether RCA will part ways with Kelly is less about if it has the right to cancel his contract than about if it wants to — and what it would cost the label. Dropping a well-known artist is not a decision any record company takes lightly, these executives said. And however much the company’s reputation may suffer now from keeping Kelly on its roster, RCA’s executives may be weighing the risks of being accused of censorship, or of jettisoning its contractual obligations. “The risks for RCA/Sony are glaringly obvious — subjecting themselves to public pressure, being viewed as condoning bad behavior, lacking sensitivity, and choosing money over integrity,” said Jeff Rabhan, the chairman of the Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music at New York University. But, Rabhan added: “Societal outrage is best demonstrated by simply not purchasing his music or tickets to his concerts. It would be ill-advised for RCA/Sony to make business decisions solely based upon a groundswell of current publicity and outrage surrounding the allegations.” Several executives pointed to the industry furor last year after Spotify instituted a vaguely articulated “hateful conduct” policy that appeared to largely affect black artists, including Kelly. The policy — which removed some artists’ work from official Spotify playlists — was canceled three weeks after it was announced. Then there is the question of Kelly’s many fans. By the end of Lifetime’s first broadcast of “Surviving R. Kelly,” daily streams of his songs in the United States more than doubled, according to Nielsen, from 1.9 million the day before the series began to 4.3 million on its last day. Kelly’s most recent RCA album was “12 Nights of Christmas” in 2016. Although his contract with RCA is private, and may in some ways still be governed by the deal he signed in 1991 with the Jive label, which is now owned by Sony, industry lawyers said the power imbalance of most artist contracts likely gives RCA many ways to cancel the deal. The label may be able to decline an option to extend Kelly’s most recent deal, and many contracts give the label a right to pay the artist a fee rather than release new material, known as “pay or play.” “You can always drop an artist,” said Elliot Groffman, a music lawyer in New York. “The only issue is what obligations you have to that artist if you drop them.” Although morals clauses are rare in record deals, several lawyers said, the severity of the accusations against Kelly, and the fact that prosecutors are looking into them, may let RCA argue that its association with Kelly has become damaging to the company, and give it a way out. Kelly could always accuse RCA of breaching its contract through “bad faith” — intentionally failing to fulfill its obligations — but that is unlikely, said Laurie L. Soriano, a music lawyer in Los Angeles. “I think no one would consider this a matter of bad faith,” Soriano said, “given the situation we are talking about.” "
