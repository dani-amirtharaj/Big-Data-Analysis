Here’s a lovely profile of the composer George Crumb, who is getting a little festival from the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center on Sunday and Tuesday as he approaches his 90th birthday this fall.  Corinna went out to his home studio in Pennsylvania, and we pulled together some highlights from a rich career of wondrous sounds: Here’s “Black Angels,” inspired by the Vietnam War and written for amplified string quartet, complete: And here’s the much-loved “Vox Balaenae”: In other news! A crazy story out of Hungary: When the Hungarian State Opera’s white cast of singers came together in Budapest earlier this month to revive a production of George Gershwin’s opera “Porgy and Bess,” they received letters carrying an unusual request: to declare themselves African-American.  Jaap van Zweden, the New York Philharmonic’s music director, burned himself while icing himself last week — I know, I know — so Simone Young jumped into this weekend’s performances of Mahler’s Sixth. Josh opines that her extensive work in opera may have informed her approach. With the Pulitzer Prizes set to be announced on Monday, Will Robin looked at the history of the music prize, its future in a bit of flux after last year’s surprise award to Kendrick Lamar’s hip-hop album “DAMN.” The Shed, the $500 million performance space at Hudson Yards, opened last weekend, and our critics devoured the first offerings. And finally, be dazzled by the winner of this year’s Richard Tucker Prize, the soprano Lisette Oropesa: Enjoy the weekend! ZACHARY WOOLFE As the Miller Theater at Columbia University begins to wrap up its 30th-anniversary season — a Composer Portrait concert featuring David T. Little’s music comes next, on Thursday — I’ve been thinking about some of the best concerts I’ve heard there in recent years.  One particularly fine show was in October 2007, when the composer David Sanford conducted his own big band ensemble, the Pittsburgh Collective. Both raucous and exquisitely poised, the music was decked out with some broadly perceptible reference points — including traces of classical modernism, jazz improvisation and the attack of punk. Yet it was the composer’s way of combining these surface-level traits that proved most memorable.  While Mr. Sanford’s music is not heard in New York nearly enough, a taste of his more recent work is available, thanks to a set on the Boston Modern Orchestra Project’s label. The 11-minute work that gives the album its title, “Black Noise,” is a 2017 piece commissioned by the orchestra, known as BMOP.  Less immediately boisterous than some of what Mr. Sanford has written for his own band, “Black Noise” lavishes time on an investigation of spectral trends in contemporary classical harmony. In his liner notes, Mr. Sanford cites composer Fausto Romitelli as an influence, as well as the “harmonic world” of Pierre Boulez. Boulez’s “Notations” for orchestra don’t feel all that far away at points. But other of Mr. Sanford’s stylistic predilections also push themselves to the fore, including a frenzied section in the middle, which is helped along at first by authoritative, pizzicato bass lines, suggestive of Mr. Sanford’s appreciation for Charles Mingus.

I wouldn’t recommend the trip to Brooklyn for Ivo van Hove’s sluggish, overstuffed staging of Janacek’s “Diary of One Who Disappeared” at BAM.  I would, though, recommend listening to the piece, which I offer below in two versions, the original (for voices and solo piano) and a later, lusher orchestral arrangement (played gorgeously by the Berlin Philharmonic under Claudio Abbadio). And read Thomas May’s moving story on the composer George Walker, whose Sinfonia No. 5, “Visions” — his response to the 2015 shooting at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church — has its first live performance in Seattle on April 11. (His hands on the piano are in the photo above.) I leave you with Anna Netrebko’s “Pace, pace” from the London “Forza del Destino” I was lucky enough to attend recently. Happy listening! ZACHARY WOOLFE The Criterion Collection recently released a new restoration of Ingmar Bergman’s 1975 screen adaptation of “The Magic Flute” — a stylized and slightly bonkers Swedish-language take on Mozart’s opera. It’s a film as much about Bergman’s love of the opera as it is a film of the piece itself. The director sets it in a theater, presenting both his vision for a staging and the experience of putting on a performance. During the overture, you never see the orchestra; instead, the camera settles on the face of a young girl experiencing Mozart’s magical score for the first time. Then you see other faces: young, old, male, female, white, brown. This is music for everyone. Throughout the show, Bergman moves fluidly between onstage action and backstage humor. Papageno nearly misses his entrance because he is napping. He rolls out of his dressing room and runs to the wings, where is outfitted with his birdcage backpack and pan flute just in time to play the flute’s famous upward scale. During intermission, the Queen of the Night is seen smoking under a sign that says “Smoking strictly forbidden,” while the dragon walks awkwardly down the corridor and Tamino and Pamina play chess to pass time. This is nothing like the opera films of Franco Zeffirelli, which are lavishly literal-minded. It’s much stranger and smaller, and endlessly endearing. JOSHUA BARONE The pianist Emanuel Ax played works by Brahms, Ravel and Chopin splendidly at his recent recital at Carnegie Hall. But I was especially stuck by his pairing of two seemingly disparate works, when he followed an alluring account of George Benjamin’s “Piano Figures” (2004) with Schumann’s “Fantasiestücke,” hardly taking a break between the two.  In juxtaposing old and new works, an artist can call attention to resonances that bridge centuries. That’s what happened here. Mr. Benjamin’s 14-minute “Piano Figures” is a set of 10 elusive miniatures, each exploring a different element of music, like hypnotic repetitions in “Spell” or jagged tangles of counterpoint in the aptly titled “Knots.” Then Mr. Ax turned to Schumann’s fantastical set of eight pieces. Playing the two works side by side, Mr. Ax emphasized the wildness, even radicalism, of the Schumann and highlighted hints of mystical Romanticism in the Benjamin. He ended with a dazzling account of Chopin’s “Andante Spianato and Grande Polonaise Brillante,” another work he has played (and recorded) to acclaim. ANTHONY TOMMASINI "

This week, the soprano Christine Georke brought her much-hyped Brünnhilde to the Metropolitan Opera for the opening of Wagner’s “Die Walküre,” my favorite installment of the “Ring.” Her arrival is remarkable if only because vocal troubles nearly pushed her to quit opera; you can read all about it in Michael Cooper’s profile of her:  Corinna da Fonseca-Wollheim, who reviewed “Die Walküre,” wrote that in Ms. Goerke, the Met “has found a Brünnhilde who marries vocal vitality and emotional presence in each radiant note.” I couldn’t agree more. Listen for yourself how she tosses off those howls of “Hojotoho!”  Expect more coverage of the “Ring” as the Met rolls its revival of Robert Lepage’s production. Anthony Tommasini has offered his thoughts on how Wagner’s epic always seems to be eerily resonant, especially now in this moment of divisive American politics.  But enough about Wagner (for now). Elsewhere this week, I attended the latest edition of the New York Philharmonic’s Nightcap series. These little concerts are meant to provide an intimate introduction to living composers — John Adams, in this case. The program Mr. Adams curated, however, was generous and illuminating, featuring only two of his works (“I Still Play” and “First Quartet”) to make room for ones by his younger colleagues.  So Mr. Adams presented music by people like Timo Andres — he also played the evening’s solo piano pieces — and Nico Muhly, as well as Gabriella Smith, who I hope will be heard at the Philharmonic again soon. Enjoy an excerpt from her “Carrot Revolution,” a sonically intrepid piece that has the impression of an image coming in and out of focus, joyously performed at Nightcap by the Attacca Quartet.  I was back at the Philharmonic on Wednesday for a one-night-only concert featuring Yuja Wang, as thrilling as ever, in Robert Schumann’s Piano Concerto in A minor. The great Maurizio Pollini was originally scheduled to appear, but canceled. As it happens, Ms. Wang is currently touring the work. She was mesmerizing in a performance last month with the Boston Symphony Orchestra, where she struck a Martha Argerich-like balance of commanding precision and wildness. The scales tipped slightly at David Geffen Hall this week as she opened the concerto with a fiery run of chords. Which is not to say she gave a feral performance: She never appeared out of control as she navigated the piece’s changing moods and fickle attachment to Romantic and Classical styles. For an encore, she leaned into Romanticism with one of her standbys, Liszt’s stirring transcription of the Schubert song “Gretchen am Spinnrade.”  For those following Ms. Wang’s many appearances in New York this season, she’ll next play at Carnegie Hall on April 10, where her Perspectives series continues with a recital featuring the cellist Gautier Capuçon. On the program is Rachmaninoff’s Cello Sonata in G minor, a chamber work whose dreamy sound world I’m always happy to revisit. See you there. JOSHUA BARONE If the opera world had awards like the Oscars, then in 1998 the tenor Anthony Dean Griffey would surely have won for best actor in a leading role, for his wrenching performance as the hulking, slow-witted Lennie in Carlisle Floyd’s “Of Mice and Men” at New York City Opera. (Here he is in the video above, in a 2011 production at Opera Australia.)  Mr. Griffey might even have picked up the award again in 2008, for the title role of Britten’s “Peter Grimes” at the Metropolitan Opera. His Grimes came across like a dangerously intemperate and painfully isolated man-boy.  Now a professor of voice at the Eastman School of Music, Mr. Griffey returned to New York for a recital last Sunday at the Morgan Library & Museum. He shared the program with the gifted, radiant-voiced young coloratura soprano Amy Owens (presented in collaboration with the George London Foundation). The Warren Jones was the elegant, superb piano accompanist.  Mr. Griffey brought robust sound, tenderness and his trademark crisp diction to songs by Frank Bridge, John Jacob Niles, Charles Ives and others. He paid tribute to Mr. Floyd, now 92, singing Sam’s Aria from “Susannah,” which he once performed at the Met with Renée Fleming in the title role. Mr. Griffey also expressed gratitude to André Previn, who died last month, for giving him career-changing opportunities, including casting him as Mitch in the premiere of the opera “A Streetcar Named Desire” (which also starred Ms. Fleming). Mr. Griffey then sang a wistful performance of Mitch’s revealing aria. ANTHONY TOMMASINI "

You may notice that this week’s compendium has been put together and published on Saturday morning, rather than the usual Friday afternoon.  Blame the unreliable Wi-Fi on my flight back from London, where I had traveled to see the opening of Verdi’s “La Forza del Destino” at the Royal Opera House. The main draw: the show brings together Anna Netrebko and Jonas Kafumann in a staged opera for the first time since 2008. It was a particular coup for Ms. Netrebko, who gave, I wrote, “one of the performances of her career.” Comparing it with some other recent new roles, “it is a more spontaneous creation than Ms. Netrebko’s serene Aida or her stilted Tosca, with the grandeur and sorrow of her Adriana Lecouvreur and a febrility that recalls her Lady Macbeth.” Here’s a clip of her singing “Pace, pace,” the climactic aria in “Forza,” in concert in Buenos Aires last year: Lincoln Center’s Mostly Mozart Festival announced its 2019 season. Here’s our summary, and here’s the full release. Some good news out of New England: Florence Price’s music will make its debut with the Boston Symphony, five years after William Robin, writing in our pages, called the orchestra out for overlooking her. And Anthony Tommasini compared the Met’s old and new “Ring” productions when it comes to Wotan’s Narrative, perhaps the cycle’s emotional center. Here are the clips! With singing like that, I hope you’ll agree that late was better than never this week. Enjoy your weekend! ZACHARY WOOLFE On Wednesday at Zankel Hall, the vocal ensemble Theatre of Voices and its director, Paul Hillier, presented small sets of music by Arvo Pärt and David Lang. But the impact of their tour through Pärt — an assemblage of works composed in different decades — was drained of some pleasure by a video piece projected alongside it. The sedate shots of animals and skyscapes brought Mr. Pärt’s profundity (as well as the group’s singing) down to earth. The premiere of the full version of Mr. Lang’s “the writings” helped illustrate how little help musicianship of this caliber actually requires. Presented simply, without multimedia interference, Mr. Lang’s work brought the Theatre’s singers together with members of Yale Voxtet. They made a strong case for Mr. Lang’s latest cycle, which draws inspiration from the Hebrew Bible. The text of the third movement, “for love is strong,” is a long list poem of similes revolving around rooted, droning tones. And in a later movement, one could hear a chattering central vocal part that seemed influenced by Meredith Monk. But the harmonies — quickly shifting, comforting and peculiar at once — served as reminders of Mr. Lang’s individual artistry. SETH COLTER WALLS On Monday evening, the Metropolitan Opera brought back David McVicar’s handsomely efficient production of “Tosca,” with the conductor Carlo Rizzi leading a rich and exciting reading of the score. Flu season provided more excitement: On Monday afternoon, the soprano Jennifer Rowley, who was to have sung the title role, withdrew because of illness. She was replaced by Iulia Isaev, a Romanian soprano making her Met debut. With a powdery soft tone and comforting low register, Ms. Isaev was most convincing in the first act, in which we get to know Tosca as a sweet and playfully pious diva. Her flirtatious interplay with Joseph Calleja’s Cavaradossi felt alluringly natural. (He, too, was battling a cold but pulled out some stirring lines.) But the opera’s fascination stems from Tosca’s growth under pressure, as she faces the awful choice between hearing her lover tortured and submitting to a sexual bully — and then when she, with desperate clarity, kills her tormentor. Ms. Isaev never quite marshaled the power to convey that transformation. The aria “Vissi d’arte” should mark a turning point in the opera, but while Ms. Isaev’s rendition had melting sadness, in the cautious top note of the climax there was none of the bitter fire that should fuel the dramatic events to come.

[Read about the final run of the Met’s “Aida.”] There will be just two more performances, on March 4 and 7. When the opera returns, it’ll be to open the 2020-21 season in a new staging by Michael Mayer, of the Met’s Rat Pack “Rigoletto.” (The “Aida” cast looks incredible: Anna Netrebko, Anita Rachvelishvili, Piotr Beczala and Ludovic Tézier, conducted by Yannick Nézet-Séguin.) Other things this week: — Josh Barone revisited John Adams’s recent opera “Girls of the Golden West” in Amsterdam. — Accusations of bullying threaten Daniel Barenboim’s previously sacrosanct position in the Berlin music scene. — Nate Wooley makes amazing music. — Hear seven of the best works from the middle of the last century, a sadly neglected period in American music. — Reviews of “Falstaff” at the Met, a virtuosic pianist and the tenor Matthew Polenzani. (Gotta love a singer who programs Janacek’s “Diary of One Who Disappeared.”) In a tweet, the composer Nico Muhly yanked me in the direction of Alexandre Tharaud’s recording of Rameau keyboard works, which I listened to and promptly recommended to everyone I know. You need to hear this strange and glorious recording! Enjoy the weekend. ZACHARY WOOLFE As if the list of stellar pianists still in their 20s and early 30s weren’t long enough, here’s another name to add to it. Beatrice Rana, 26, should probably already be on the list, to be fair, with a handful of strong recordings including a “Goldberg” Variations that I named as one of the releases of the year in 2017.  But she’s only now making her way around the recital circuit, with a debut to come on March 12 at Carnegie Hall. I heard the program she’ll play there this past Wednesday, as part of the Celebrity Series of Boston. Agosti’s transcription of Stravinsky’s “The Firebird” had all the virtuosic flair that you’d expect, but never for its own sake; Ravel’s “Miroirs” were as polished as pearls, each blessed by uncommon sensitivity of touch; and if I was never quite convinced by her meditative take on Chopin’s Op. 25 Études, it always intrigued. One to watch. DAVID ALLEN "

In memory of Michael Gielen, the searching conductor who died last Friday at 91 — read David Allen’s superb obituary — hear one of the selections David chose: Beethoven’s “Missa Solemnis,” rendered with cleareyed power. Listen as you go about chores, or take the subway, or drive to the bank. You’ll be glad you did. On Wednesday, I was at the Metropolitan Opera for the return of “Samson et Dalila” with a fresh cast — notably the galvanizing mezzo-soprano Anita Rachvelishvili.  It was clear from the start that the Samson, Aleksandrs Antonenko, was struggling; after intermission, the Met announced that he was ill with a cold, and would be replaced by Gregory Kunde. It’s not easy to jump into the middle of a performance, but Mr. Kunde did it with stylish ease. Now 65(!), he’s moved on from specializing in bel canto earlier in his career to the heroic roles of Verdi and Puccini. But he’s hardly ever sung at the Met. Hopefully that changes now. His success brought me back to an already classic recording of Rossini’s “Armida” made from 1993 performances in Italy. Here’s Mr. Kunde combining memorably with Renée Fleming: This week our critics reviewed the return of “Das Rheingold” to the Met; the New York recital debut of the pianist Beatrice Rana; the umpteenth Carnegie concert by the great violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter; and two concerts from Esa-Pekka Salonen and the Philharmonia Orchestra of London. In darker news, the musicians of the Chicago Symphony have gone on strike, largely over proposed changes to their pension plan. And Christine Goerke spoke with Michael Cooper about taking on Brünnhilde at the Met, where she was once in the young artists program. “I think if you talk to anyone who’s ever been a young artist in any house, it’s always hard to come back and feel like a grown-up,” she said. “I’m going to be 50, and I still feel like I’m 24.” Enjoy the weekend! ZACHARY WOOLFE The night after Beatrice Rana’s New York debut, on the same stage (Zankel Hall), the fun was doubled in a fascinating program of exciting works for two pianos, performed by the formidable Kirill Gerstein, who can play anything, and Thomas Adès, an eminent composer who is also accomplished pianist.  Recently they were with the Boston Symphony Orchestra for the premiere of Mr. Adès’s Piano Concerto, written for Mr. Gerstein. (They bring that work to Carnegie Hall on Wednesday.) At Zankel, they began with Debussy’s “En Blanc et Noir,” a late work, from 1915, which in this starkly beautiful and steely performance seemed not far removed from the shock-and-awe radicalism of Stravinsky’s “The Rite of Spring” (1913).  Turning to Stravinsky, they played Shostakovich’s rarely-heard arrangement of the “Symphony of Psalms.” With the chorus part (a setting of psalm texts) divided between the pianos — and without the distraction, so to speak, of the score’s dark, percussive orchestral sonorities — the modernist daring of Stravinsky’s harmonic language came through stunningly. The program also included Mr. Adès’s stream-of-consciousness Concert Paraphrase from his opera “Powder Her Face,” and ended with an account of Ravel’s “La Valse” that had this showpiece sounding dangerous. Don’t believe me? Here they are playing it in Paris in 2016. ANTHONY TOMMASINI "

LITTLE at Miller Theater (April 18, 8 p.m.). Little is perhaps best and deservedly known for his operas, including “Dog Days” and “JFK,” so this composer portrait is a welcome opportunity to hear some of his instrumental music. Not that the music to be played here sets aside the political approach that he has taken in so much of his work. “Haunt of Last Nightfall,” for percussion quartet and electronics, takes its story from the 1981 El Mozote massacre in El Salvador by soldiers trained by the United States military; “AGENCY,” for string quartet and electronics, is a work about secrecy, itself written using ciphers.

Pollini had to cancel a recent, scheduled appearance with the New York Philharmonic, so keep everything crossed that this most eminent of pianists can make it this time.

The big news this week was the premieres — both on Thursday — of new piano concertos by Thomas Adès and John Adams.  Josh Barone spoke with the composers beforehand: And David Allen and I were there — in Boston for the Adès and in Los Angeles for the Adams — to review: I was also in L.A. earlier this week for the premiere of Bryce Dessner’s wan meditation on Robert Mapplethorpe, “Triptych (Eyes of One on Another).” Josh covered a new concerto for Yo-Yo Ma and Wu Man at the New York Philharmonic. Seth Colter Walls was wowed by Roscoe Mitchell at the Park Avenue Armory, including a work that’s evolved over time: I was sadly underwhelmed by “Rameau, Maître à Danser,” a program that the usually excellent ensemble Les Arts Florissants brought to the Brooklyn Academy of Music last weekend. The Rameau opera-ballets on the double bill were slight, to say the least, as was the staging; the singing was, for the most part, fine, but not remarkable; the music, played from the back of the stage, faded by the time it reached the audience. (The choruses, though, were tenderly handled, and a delicate passage that combined flute and pizzicato strings a perfect example of Rameau’s innovations.) ZACHARY WOOLFE What was that sound? William Christie and Les Arts Florissants have introduced me to plenty of French Baroque repertoire over the years, but when they returned to the Brooklyn Academy of Music last week with “Rameau, Maître à Danser,” they also introduced me to an instrument I had not known before. When I first heard its drone poking through the ensemble, I thought for a second it might be a hurdy-gurdy. Then I thought bagpipe — but with a slightly mellower, English-horn-type sound. Finally the musician, François Lazarevitch, strolled across the stage playing what appeared to be a petite, elegant bagpipe. It was a musette, a bagpipe with bellows that was in vogue among 17th- and 18th-century French aristocrats. You can hear it in this video Mr. Lazarevitch made for Les Musiciens de Saint-Julien. MICHAEL COOPER The John Zorn show came to the Miller Theater at Columbia University on Thursday. And it was most assertively a show. Though he did not perform himself, Mr. Zorn played the role of M.C. with relish, taking microphone in hand to introduce each successive grouping of players. He said a few words about each piece, encouraged applause, and then got off the stage. (Among his other attributes, Mr. Zorn is rare among new-music ringleaders in his frequent avoidance of energy-sapping intermissions.) He had reason to be confident in his cast. The musicians who gathered to perform the hour-plus set of new and recent pieces was something of an all-star team. The JACK Quartet, the pianist Stephen Gosling, the percussionist Tyshawn Sorey and the vibraphonist Sae Hashimoto all made multiple appearances. Among the premieres, I was most struck by Mr. Gosling’s take on the piano-miniature series “Encomia,” which included tributes to composers as diverse as Charles Wuorinen and Debussy. And between its quick-changing volleys of Zornian exultation, “Konx Om Pax” — played by Mr. Gosling, Ms. Hashimoto, Mr. Sorey and the bassist Shanir Ezra Blumenkranz — also contained stretches of luminous brooding, suggestive of noir film music. It probably won’t take very long for some of these pieces to appear on recordings from Mr. Zorn’s Tzadik label. But in the meantime, anyone looking for music similar to some of the works heard on Thursday should acquire “The Interpretation of Dreams” — a stirring 2017 disc that includes a piano quintet for the JACK players and Mr. Gosling, as well as some lights-out playing by Ms. Hashimoto and the rhythm section of Mr. Sorey and Mr. Blumenkranz. SETH COLTER WALLS Like Caravaggio before her, the Baroque painter Artemisia Gentileschi knew how to build scenes of taut drama with far-from-idealized figures crammed into a constricted pictorial space and bathed in harsh light. The composer Laura Schwendinger and the librettist Ginger Strand achieve something similar in their potently claustrophobic opera “Artemisia,” which received its staged premiere at Trinity Wall Street’s St. Paul’s Chapel on Thursday (and repeats on Saturday). Gentileschi’s life story could provide fodder for many hours of music drama. The daughter of a painter, she was raped by her teacher when she was a teenager. At a court trial, her assailant was convicted, but only after she had been subjected to torture to verify her testimony. She went on to attract the attention of Cosimo II de’ Medici, befriended Galileo Galilei and worked in London at the invitation of King Charles I. “Artemisia” lasts just 80 minutes, but fits in big themes set to music of quivering intensity. The story of the rape is there, blended with Gentileschi’s unbearably compassionate painting of the biblical character Susanna, who was ogled and shamed in her bath. But larger questions of idea and form, image and projection, sight and gaze also find nuanced and intelligent treatment. CORINNA da FONSECA-WOLLHEIM "

This week, I’ve looked to my colleague Josh Barone for reports on Yuja Wang’s concert at Zankel Hall with the music-comedy duo Igudesman & Joo, which had sketches and jokes about sex and race that Josh found troubling. He reviewed the program. But we felt there was still more to explore. So he wrote this thoughtful piece about the event and the line between satire and offense. Please read it, and let us know what you think. Coming up this weekend at the Los Angeles Philharmonic is an intriguing small festival devoted to William Grant Still and music of — and inspired by — the Harlem Renaissance. Still’s First Symphony, which will be played on Saturday, gets some play; his Fourth, set for Sunday, very little. Take a listen: Some other things to catch you up on: The conductor Daniel Harding, who’s had trouble with American orchestras, is dipping his toe in this country again. Here’s a playlist of some of his best recordings: The ensemble Blue Heron has made a specialty of nearly vanished music of the English Renaissance. Listen to what it’s uncovered: And “Rigoletto” returned to the Metropolitan Opera, to little effect. Enjoy the weekend! ZACHARY WOOLFE Szymanowski’s First Violin Concerto (1916) was the oldest work on the Boston Symphony Orchestra’s program last Friday. But it felt like the most modern. That isn’t a dig against the other two pieces: Olly Wilson’s 1981 “Lumina,” and Copland’s Third Symphony, which was given its premiere by the Bostonians in 1946. But they seemed conservative compared with the Szymanowski — a restless, single-movement adventure that dances back and forth between lyricism and mayhem. The orchestra, enthusiastically conducted by Andris Nelsons, seemed almost gleeful as the concerto’s hodgepodge sonority was at its most raucous and exotic. Lisa Batiashvili, the soloist, was the calmest person onstage. Yet she was also the most thrilling to watch, and virtually flawless as she navigated her mercurial part’s taxing blend of harsh double stops, screeching high notes and soaring melodies. JOSHUA BARONE The baritone Gerald Finley may be best known for creating the role of the ambitious, tormented J. Robert Oppenheimer in John Adams’s 2005 opera “Doctor Atomic.” His latest appearance at the Met was in the title role of Bartok’s “Bluebeard’s Castle.”  It was chilling to witness Mr. Finley, with his warm, robust voice, bringing such subdued malevolence to the murderous Bluebeard. I was reminded of a completely different triumph for Mr. Finley at the Met, in the title role of Rossini’s masterpiece “Guillaume Tell” in 2016.  Here he is in a poignant excerpt from the Act III aria “Sois immobile,” when Tell, who has been arrested, is ordered to shoot an arrow into an apple balanced on the head of his beloved son. He instructs the young man to stay completely still while calling upon God. Mr. Finlay conveys an aching mix of outward assurance and inner panic. ANTHONY TOMMASINI "

PIOTR ANDERSZEWSKI at Alice Tully Hall (April 2, 7:30 p.m.). Anderszewski is something of a specialist in Beethoven’s Diabelli Variations: He has been associated with it at least since his brilliant release on Virgin Classics in 2001. Here the eccentric pianist prefaces the Beethoven with preludes and fugues from the second book of Bach’s “The Well-Tempered Clavier.” 212-721-6500, lincolncenter.org CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER at Alice Tully Hall (March 31, 5 p.m.). One of the Chamber Music Society’s more enticing programs this season pairs a Bach cantata, “Ich habe genug,” with Haydn’s “The Seven Last Words of Our Savior on the Cross.” The Orion String Quartet performs the Haydn and is joined by the oboist Stephen Taylor, the bassist Timothy Cobb, the harpsichordist Paolo Bordignon and the bass-baritone Ryan Speedo Green for the Bach. 212-875-5788, chambermusicsociety.org CHOIR OF KING’S COLLEGE, CAMBRIDGE, at St. Thomas Church (April 1, 7:30 p.m.). There is a symbolic passing of the baton here, or at least of the vestments. Stephen Cleobury has been the director of music at King’s College, with its famed boy choristers, since 1982. On this, his final tour before retirement in the fall, he and his choir stop at St. Thomas, where his successor, Daniel Hyde, is currently director of music. The program sprawls, from Monteverdi, Tallis and Byrd to Britten, Howells and Vaughan Williams. 212-757-7013, saintthomaschurch.org ‘LA CLEMENZA DI TITO’ at the Metropolitan Opera (March 30, 8:30 p.m.; April 3, 8 p.m.; through April 20). Jean-Pierre Ponnelle’s production returns, and with it comes the prospect of Joyce DiDonato singing the role of Sesto. Joining her are Matthew Polenzani as Tito, Ying Fang as Servilia, Elza van den Heever as Vitellia, Christian Van Horn as Publio and Emily D’Angelo as Annio. Lothar Koenigs conducts. 212-362-6000, metopera.org ‘DIARY OF ONE WHO DISAPPEARED’ at BAM Howard Gilman Opera House (April 4-6, 7:30 p.m.). In association with the Flemish opera company Muziektheater Transparant, the inimitable Ivo van Hove directs a much-anticipated staging of Janacek’s raw song cycle, with added music by Annelies Van Parys. Singers include Andrew Dickinson and Marie Hamard. 718-636-4100, bam.org [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] REBECCA FISCHER at Miller Theater (April 2, 6 p.m.). Formerly the first violinist of the Chiara String Quartet, Fischer performs a free pop-up concert of seven works by female composers, including Gabriela Lena Frank, Lisa Bielawa, Paola Prestini, Jessie Montgomery, Shih-Hui Chen, Missy Mazzoli and Suzanne Farrin. 212-854-7799, millertheatre.com MITSUKO UCHIDA at Carnegie Hall (March 29, 8 p.m.). If there is a finer Mozart pianist alive than Uchida, I have yet to hear one. Her most recent, self-recommending recordings of selected piano concertos on Decca saw her leading the Cleveland Orchestra from the keyboard. Here she directs the Mahler Chamber Orchestra in Piano Concertos Nos. 19 and 20. In between, the orchestra plays three pieces from Berg’s “Lyric Suite.” 212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org "
5c704be73a125f5075c0b11f,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/22/arts/music/classical-music-youtube.html,"[Read all of our classical music coverage here.] Hi there! The Metropolitan Opera announced its 2019-20 season on Wednesday, and our writers have chosen some highlights. And Corinna da Fonseca-Wollheim took the measure of Daniel Harding and the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam. In sadder news, the composer Dominick Argento, who spent much of his life in Minnesota, died at 91. A Facebook friend told me Argento was close with Mary Ann Feldman, the Minnesota Orchestra’s longtime program annotator, who died this week, too. “A sad week for the classical music community in the Twin Cities,” my correspondent wrote. Argento’s song cycle “From the Diary of Virginia Woolf,” written for Janet Baker, is one of his finest achievements. Enjoy it. ZACHARY WOOLFE The director Mary Birnbaum, in her intriguingly updated production of Purcell’s “Dido and Aeneas” at the Juilliard School, gives us an ambiguous ending. The staging posits that Dido doesn’t die of heartbreak, but by self-immolation, after the public humiliation of being abandoned by her lover, Aeneas. (After all, what kind of queen falls hopelessly for an enemy?) But Ms. Birnbaum further complicates things: Her Dido storms off at the end and seems not to die at all.  It’s a difficult concept, but the cast, dressed in modish, stylized costumes, embraced it and brought lots of youthful, ardent singing to the music, backed by the sensitive period-instrument Juilliard415 ensemble, with Avi Stein conducting. (It runs through Sunday.) The mezzo-soprano Shakèd Bar was a dark-toned, calculating Dido, a role she performed in 2017 in a semi-staged performance with the Jerusalem Baroque Orchestra. The baritone Dominik Belavy, in a sleek three-piece suit covered with embroidered flowers, was an impassioned Aeneas. I must mention Chance Jonas-O’Toole, a sweet-voiced tenor whose small role as a sailor was fortified with a couple of inserted, thematically appropriate Purcell songs. ANTHONY TOMMASINI The Hebrew word “mar’eh,” which means “face” or “sign,” is the revealing title the composer Matthias Pintscher gave his 2011 work for violin and orchestra, which he led with the New York Philharmonic on Thursday. In this 23-minute score, the violin has long passages that seem to be suggesting the myriad auras, or faces, of sounds.  It begins with the violin playing almost gauzy, hushed high tones and scratchy effects. In time, the sounds coalesce into wandering, elusive lyrical lines. Slowly, the violin becomes a questing, sometimes challenging protagonist in a dialogue with the orchestra. Violin utterances draw fidgety, softly rumbling and skittish reactions. Only passing episodes of assertive, gnarly music disrupt the mostly hushed, urgent conversation that dominates this sonic tone poem.  Renaud Capuçon was a spellbinding soloist, as in this excerpt from a 2015 performance with the Berlin Philharmonic, with the composer conducting. To open the program in New York, which runs through Saturday, Mr. Pintscher led a sumptuous, wildly animated yet cagey performance of Ravel’s “Alborada del gracioso.” He ended with a riveting account of Stravinsky’s “Firebird,” a fresh, startling account that conveyed both the plaintive beauties and slashing rawness of this 1910 score. ANTHONY TOMMASINI On Thursday at the Miller Theater at Columbia University, members of Yarn/Wire and the International Contemporary Ensemble gathered for a Composer Portraits concert devoted to works by Wang Lu. The program began with the title work from her recent album, “Urban Inventory.” That suite incorporates some prerecorded street scenes, captured by the composer while visiting Xi’an, the city in China where she was born. The playing at Miller was sharp, particularly in the 2008 chamber work “Siren Song,” which includes passages of acidic squall, as well as pools of melodic reverie. Yet in other works, the players’ acute emphasis on more striated textures occasionally seemed to lose sight of a fine balance between rupture and reflection that can be heard in this composer’s music — as in the final movement of “Urban Inventory,” during which traces of a recording by the pop singer Yang Yuying can be heard. SETH COLTER WALLS On Wednesday, a different sort of pop-classical meeting came during Andy Warhol’s 1966 film “Hedy,” which screened as part of a triple feature at the Whitney Museum of American Art, currently showing a Warhol retrospective. Though the film progressed with the same long-take style of other Warhol moving-image works from the period, “Hedy” also employed interstitial music during its scene transitions. The wildly pulsing drone music that could be heard offstage as Warhol’s camera zoomed in and out was immediately recognizable as the Velvet Underground. The film has no traditional credits, but the Warhol Museum cites work by Underground members Lou Reed and John Cale as part of “Hedy.” In his book “Andy Warhol’s Ridiculous Screenplays,” Warhol collaborator Ronald Tavel remembers the entire group as being present at the Factory during the shoot — though Warhol “amazingly, unforgivably” never managed to capture footage of their playing in the film. Mr. Tavel cites the composer La Monte Young as a likely influence on the group’s playing in this performance, though the forceful music for the film also brought to mind some experiments conducted outside of Mr. Young’s Theater of Eternal Music — including Mr. Cale’s 1965 guitar solo “Summer Heat,” as well as a later collaboration with Tony Conrad, “Dream Interpretation.” SETH COLTER WALLS I made a point of catching a set by the saxophonist and composer Caroline Davis last Saturday at the Greenwich House’s “Sound It Out” series. That was a priority, thanks to the compelling lead single from her next album, “Alula,” which is forthcoming from New Amsterdam Records. Over the three-minute span of “Wingbeat,” you can hear Ms. Davis’s talent for deriving long, dizzying motifs from smaller melodic cells. At Greenwich House (as on the forthcoming album), Ms. Davis was joined by the reliably outstanding keyboardist Matt Mitchell. But since the drummer on the recording, Greg Saunier, had his own gig on Saturday — uptown at the Ecstatic Music Festival — Ms. Davis’s Greenwich House trio included Dan Weiss, some luxury backup casting. This group made a thrashing impression, suggesting both the strength of the compositions on “Alula” as well as the significant potential for additional works by this configuration in the future.

EMANUEL AX at Carnegie Hall (March 27, 8 p.m.). Reliable as ever, Ax makes his way through Brahms, Schumann, Ravel and Chopin in this recital, but heads a little off piste, too, for George Benjamin’s “Piano Figures.”212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org HAGEN QUARTET at Zankel Hall (March 22, 7:30 p.m.; March 28, 8:30 p.m.). The first of this esteemed quartet’s Carnegie Hall concerts this week, on Friday, is as much of a showcase for Jörg Widmann, a clarinetist and leading composer. He plays in the United States premiere of his Clarinet Quintet, as well as in Mozart’s. And there’s even heavier fare on Thursday, when the quartet returns for Schubert’s “Rosamunde” Quartet; Webern’s Five Movements, Op. 5; and Beethoven’s Op. 131.212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org ‘JULIETTA’ at Carnegie Hall (March 22, 8 p.m.). Bohuslav Martinu’s operatic masterpiece has never appeared at the Metropolitan Opera, but it’s a masterpiece all the same. Trust the conductor Leon Botstein to mount it, then, as he does here with the American Symphony Orchestra and the Bard Festival Chorale. Sara Jakubiak sings the title role, with Aaron Blake as Michel.212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org NYFOS NEXT at the DiMenna Center (March 28, 7:30 p.m.). A finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in 2017 and a crafter of “playful, thoughtful, befuddling, enchanting” music, as my colleague Zachary Woolfe has put it, Kate Soper curates this concert under the New York Festival of Song umbrella. She sings two excerpts from her next opera, “The Romance of the Rose,” as well as “The Understanding of All Things.” There’s also music by Kaija Saariaho, Natacha Diels and Alvin Lucier. Charlotte Mundy and Charmaine Lee are the other featured vocalists; Sam Pluta is in charge of the electronics. nyfos.org/nyfos-next [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] TYSHAWN SOREY at Miller Theater (March 28, 8 p.m.). Sorey has had such success in the past few years that he barely needs one of the Miller’s important composer portraits to spotlight his art, but any opportunity to hear his music is a welcome one. Here there’s a world premiere, “Autoschediasms,” for “creative chamber orchestra,” as well as five other pieces. The International Contemporary Ensemble and the JACK Quartet are on hand to play.212-854-7799, millertheatre.com ‘DIE WALKÜRE’ at the Metropolitan Opera (March 25, 6:30 p.m.). See if this “Walküre,” from Robert Lepage’s retooled “Ring,” fares any better than “Das Rheingold” did earlier in the month. Philippe Jordan was a high point in “Rheingold,” my colleague Anthony Tommasini wrote, and he remains to conduct a cast that includes Greer Grimsley as Wotan, Stuart Skelton as Siegmund, Eva-Maria Westbroek as Sieglinde, Günther Groissböck as Hunding, Jamie Barton as Fricka and, most excitingly, Christine Goerke as Brünnhilde. 212-362-6000, metopera.org "

Javier Camarena sang 18 high C’s at the Metropolitan Opera on Thursday evening. Read all about it, and watch: This week the New York Philharmonic announced its 2019-20 season, and we writers came together to make a list of our highlights. Or pre-highlights, perhaps. There’s some good stuff! And Tony Tommasini, our chief critic, offered some lovely memories of working with the American baritone Sanford Sylvan, who died last week: I reviewed an austere but moving revival of Robert Ashley’s opera “Improvement (Don Leaves Linda),” which I’d highly recommend. (It runs through Feb. 16.) Take a listen to the piece: And I’ll leave you with Scriabin’s Piano Concerto, which Daniil Trifonov will play with the New York Phil next season. Here’s a lucid, feeling recording with Pierre Boulez conducting Anatol Ugorski and the Chicago Symphony. Enjoy! ZACHARY WOOLFE Finally, the overlap in the Venn diagram of Arnold Schoenberg and bluegrass music is getting a bit larger, thanks to “(Gimme Some of That) Ol’ Atonal Music,” by the country prankster Merle Hazard. The whole thing made me smile, but it was his high-pitched, Bob Wills-ian “Aha” during the atonal banjo solo that made me crack up. MICHAEL COOPER Instead of watching the State of the Union address on Tuesday, I heard Messiaen’s “Quartet for the End of Time” in the crypt of a church. As part of the Crypt Sessions series at the Church of the Intercession in Harlem, the piece got a mystical and moving performance from a makeshift group: Yoonah Kim, clarinet; Orion Weiss, piano; Stefan Jackiw, violin; and Jay Campbell, cello. They played with the synchronicity of a seasoned ensemble, nailing exposed and dangerous passages like the octave runs in the “Interlude” and “Tangle of Rainbows.” In the extreme intimacy of the crypt, you could hear the click-clack of the clarinet’s keys, and the airy sounds of bows on strings. Up close, the quartet seemed to deal only in disorienting extremes, like the alternating alarms and chirps, both chilling and playful, in “Abyss of the Birds,” a lengthy solo played with inexhaustible virtuosity by Ms. Kim. And proximity lifted “Praise to the Eternity of Jesus,” a duet for cello and piano (heard here in a luxury-casting album from 2017), to the sublime. JOSHUA BARONE Yuja Wang’s regular partnership with the violinist Leonidas Kavakos isn’t the place to hear the sustained stretches of imaginative power that characterize her solo-piano concerts. On their recording of the Brahms violin sonatas — and at their gripping recital at Carnegie Hall on Wednesday — it’s possible to sense Ms. Wang pulling back on the throttle. Which isn’t a bad thing; it can be a revelation to hear this bold pianist in a collaborative setting. That quality of reserve can also make Ms. Wang’s occasional lurch into more demonstrative playing all the more shocking. On Wednesday, her florid energy found a moment for expression during Brahms’s Violin Sonata No. 2. During the middle movement’s “Vivace di più” section, the rhythmic charge Ms. Wang put into select chords made it feel as though she could vault into Stravinsky’s “Petrouchka” transcription at any second. She didn’t, of course — and Mr. Kavakos’s steely sense of purpose kept the performance from losing its overall form. But it was a reminder of how thoroughly Ms. Wang can transform a familiar work. SETH COLTER WALLS Recently, over five days in New York, three pianists at very different stages of their careers gave remarkable recitals. Leon Fleisher celebrated his 90th birthday with musician friends at Zankel Hall. Jeremy Denk, 48 and in his prime, concluded a varied program (literally: he offered theme and variation pieces by Beethoven, Mendelssohn and John Adams) at Carnegie Hall with a magnificent account of Schumann’s Fantasy in C. And Behzod Abduraimov, 28, appeared at the 92nd Street Y. This fast-rising Uzbek pianist, who combines prodigious technique with a feeling for color and youthful temperament, gave a stunning account of Liszt’s formidable Sonata in B minor.  But his overeagerness came through in 10 Pieces from Prokofiev’s “Romeo and Juliet.” There were captivating moments but also passages of slam-bang steeliness. Perhaps he had trouble adjusting to the Y’s intimacy; he has said that he prefers big spaces. Mr. Abduraimov can certainly play with wondrous fleetness, clarity and imagination, as he did in his encore, Liszt’s “La Campanella.” Just listen to him in this excerpt from a 2015 performance in Munich.

Here’s a preview that laid out the stakes, and my review, a tag-team effort with Josh Barone: We also covered: — our picks for next season at Carnegie Hall — the double bill of “Iolanta” and “Bluebeard’s Castle” at the Met — Juilliard’s Focus! festival, about European radio commissioning — a new album from the intriguing violinist Layale Chaker; listen here: Enjoy your weekend! ZACHARY WOOLFE The director Dmitri Tcherniakov’s opera productions often end with a plot twist. His latest, Berlioz’s “Les Troyens” for the Paris Opera, ends with two. Gone is the nationalism — even much of the Romanticism — that courses through Berlioz’s grand opera. Mr. Tcherniakov’s approach, which runs through Feb. 12 (and let’s hope for a live stream at some point), aims for something more intimate, psychologically rich and, ultimately, wrenching. I haven’t been able to get it out of my mind. The first two acts, which depict the fall of Troy, place the action in a wartime cityscape, with coldly gray buildings juxtaposed with the brightly lit, wood-paneled interior of the royal family’s home. Instead of a Trojan horse, there is a horse as metaphor: Énée (Brandon Jovanovich, indefatigable) makes a coup-like deal with the Greeks that goes awry, leaving Troy in ruins and him in flight with his surviving comrades. Acts III through V take place in Carthage, which in Mr. Tcherniakov’s staging is a war-rehabilitation facility where patients are treated with yoga, breathing exercises and role-playing. One of those games involves declaring Didon (Ekaterina Semenchuk) the queen, complete with a cute paper crown, ruff and cape. Both she and Énée are damaged goods: Trauma has left her with crippling depression, while he arrives shouting nationalistic rallying cries at a wall. Berlioz’s sweeping epic become a tale of insurmountable illness. The lines between playacting and reality begin to blur. Didon and Énée do fall in love, though without ever touching during their duet “Nuit d’ivresse.” But he, hearing voices and teeming with toxic masculinity, hubristically leaves for Rome. She is left alone to sing her swan song, “Adieu, fière cité,” while downing a bottle of pills and putting back on her childlike crown and cape. It’s pathetic, and devastating. Fade to black — but then the lights come on: In what seems like a typical Tcherniakov move, Didon appears not to have died at all. The role-playing exercise instead continues, with the chorus narrating Didon’s climactic funeral pyre and the birth of Rome. But Didon seems a bit out of sync with the crowd — woozy, fading. The pills were real after all; she collapses as the score comes to its mighty end. Without changing a word, Mr. Tcherniakov turned this sprawling tale, of romance amid the fall and rise of civilizations, into an all-too-real story about two people who, ravaged by suffering, fail to ever recover. JOSHUA BARONE Last Friday at Roulette in Brooklyn, members of the Tri-Centric Vocal Ensemble celebrated the release of their new 12-disc set of works by Anthony Braxton (who, as I reported in January, is on a creative tear). At Roulette, the group performed Composition No. 255, an item from Mr. Braxton’s “Ghost Trance Music” catalog. When the ensemble recorded this same piece for the CD release, they took advantage of Mr. Braxton’s invitation to thread other of his compositions throughout. At Roulette, they doubled down on this collage-style layering — including lines of dialogue from Mr. Braxton’s recent opera “Trillium J.” The idiosyncratic pulsing style that introduces Composition No. 255 was a reminder of how instantly recognizable Mr. Braxton’s music is. Yet this particular performance’s increased emphasis on ambient complexity underlined the creative role he encourages performers to claim. A second set at Roulette, this one devoted to Mr. Braxton’s “Echo Echo Mirror House Music,” was even more notable in this regard. Past performances of the “Echo” pieces have relied on iPods, which were used to pipe in specific vintage recordings of Mr. Braxton’s other works. Here, however, the bassist and electronic musician Carl Testa used a new electroacoustic setup — designed in collaboration with the composer — to control the playback files. Alongside the pianist Cory Smythe, who played some of Mr. Braxton’s 1970s solo piano music, Mr. Testa oversaw a head-spinning, surround-sound environment that felt more immersive than past two-channel stereo recordings of the “Echo” pieces. On Saturday, Wadada Leo Smith, a longtime associate of Mr. Braxton’s, brought his Golden Quintet to the Appel Room, inside Jazz at Lincoln Center, for the New York premiere of selections from his suite “America’s National Parks.” During the early set on Saturday, this music seemed less fiery than on the version Mr. Smith and his group recorded for a 2016 release.  But there were innumerable passages of delicate beauty — often featuring the quintet’s cellist, Ashley Walters. Ms. Walters also figures prominently in Mr. Smith’s forthcoming CD release of another extended composition: “Rosa Parks: Pure Love. An Oratorio of Seven Songs.” On an advance clip posted to SoundCloud, you can hear Ms. Walters’s playing amid trumpets, electronics and a solo turn from the violinist Shalini Vijayan.

I went west last weekend to hear Esa-Pekka Salonen’s first concerts with the band he’ll soon take over, the San Francisco Symphony. It was an exciting evening, with the promise of a happy marriage: intense, committed yet self-effacing playing from a very good orchestra. Mr. Salonen brought over Anna Thorvaldsdottir’s “Metacosmos,” which he led with the New York Philharmonic last year: It’s a sly, darkly gorgeous piece, and a perfect complement to Strauss’s “Also Sprach Zarathustra.” Sibelius’s “Four Legends from the Kalevala” (also known as the “Lemminkäinen Suite”) ended things with color: lithe brooding and taut energy. Speaking of the New York Phil, this weekend is bringing the premiere performances of Julia Wolfe’s “Fire in my mouth,” about the 1911 Triangle shirtwaist factory fire. Michael Cooper did a lovely piece walking around with Ms. Wolfe and shopping for an unusual instrument: scissors. And before I sign off, a treasure: The great baritone Ettore Bastianini was just 44 when he died of cancer, on Jan. 25, 1967. He deserves deep listening, and here’s a start: Enjoy the weekend. ZACHARY WOOLFE Hello from Paris, where so far this week I have been to a sleepy concert by Paavo Järvi and the Orchestre de Paris (missing its soloist Radu Lupu, who was replaced at the last minute by Nelson Goerner in Beethoven’s Fourth Piano Concerto) and the premiere of a new production of Scarlatti’s “Il Primo Omicidio” at the Paris Opera. This Baroque oratorio, staged inside the Baroque-inspired Palais Garnier, was directed by Romeo Castellucci — more on that next week — and conducted by René Jacobs, who recorded the piece with the Akademie für Alte Musik Berlin in the late 1990s. (On that album, he also sang the countertenor role of God.)  Here, he led the Belgian ensemble B’Rock, with a beefed-up orchestration to more easily fill the Garnier. Normally I would be skeptical of expanding an orchestra simply for volume; it risks sacrificing the score’s details and texture. But, under Mr. Jacobs’s baton, B’Rock still sounded like a small chamber orchestra: nimble, clear, precise. And restrained, reserving its most powerful sound for dramatic effect, which added a sense of theater to a piece whose plot often verges on inertia. JOSHUA BARONE Thursday would have been the 100th birthday of the composer, pianist and conductor Leon Kirchner, who died at 90 in 2009. One of the most comprehensive musicians of his day, he was a valued teacher during a long career at Harvard. As a composer, Mr. Kirchner demonstrated that one could write works of rigorous complexity employing modernist techniques but in an instinctive, richly expressive, viscerally dramatic way.  Though steeped in the dodecaphonic music of his beloved teacher Schoenberg, Kirchner never used the 12-tone system strictly. Just hints of the aesthetic run through this mysterious slow movement from Kirchner’s Second String Quartet (1958), beautifully performed here by the Orion Quartet. Bartok and Stravinsky where also major influences, as the punchy opening movement of Kirchner’s First Piano Concerto (1953) make clear in this 1956 performance featuring the composer at the piano, with Mitropoulos conducting the New York Philharmonic.  Some musical highlights of my years living in Boston were the concerts Mr. Kirchner conducted with the Harvard Chamber Orchestra. He was not the tidiest technician. But he led scores by Mozart, Beethoven, Brahms and contemporary giants like a fellow composer who completely understood how the piece at hand worked. ANTHONY TOMMASINI Any ensemble making its American debut is likely to feel some jitters, especially when the program includes a masterpiece as dense and thorny as Beethoven’s Op. 130. But on Sunday, members of the Maxwell String Quartet had an additional reason for feeling a little, well, vulnerable. Addressing the audience at the New School, the group’s cellist, Duncan Strachan, explained why. “I must say,” he said, “this is a very high stage for kilts.” Flashes of thigh, and wit, are not the only reason to take note of the Maxwell Quartet, which hails from Scotland and advertises that fact both in its dress and in its repertory, which includes striking arrangements of folk music. (As the sole Englishman in the lineup, the violist Elliott Perks wore tartan trousers.) As Sunday’s eloquent performance demonstrated, the players bring the same charisma and sense of adventure to their selections. The slightly tart, resiny sound of traditional fiddle playing carried over beautifully into fresh readings of Haydn and into the Beethoven. But perhaps the most arresting moment was James MacMillan’s “Memento” from 1994, in which wisps of a melody floated on hazy harmonies and coalesced into heaving sighs before dissolving again into ghostly strains, rendered with a kind of fierce tenderness.

Call this the Week of the Critic’s Pick, our positive distinction for reviews that reviewers want to flag for you: the reader, the listener, the concertgoer. We’ve had many in recent days: Zachary Woolfe, reporting from the Cleveland Orchestra’s production of Strauss’s “Ariadne auf Naxos,” writes that “there is no orchestra I’d rather hear play” this most operatic of operas. Corinna da Fonseca-Wollheim was pleased with the rising soprano Sabine Devieilhe’s Carnegie Hall debut, “an evening of delicate, nuanced French art songs.”  She also had high praise for “Perle Noire: Meditations for Joséphine,” the latest installment of the soprano Julia Bullock’s luminous residency with the Metropolitan Museum of Art this season.  And Anthony Tommasini was pleasantly surprised by Jaap van Zweden’s conducting with the New York Philharmonic.  Also receiving a Critic’s Pick this week was the premiere of Debussy’s “Pelléas et Mélisande” at the Metropolitan Opera — where it is back for an agonizingly brief run, through Jan. 31.  In the pit for “Pelléas” is Yannick Nézet-Séguin, the Met’s new music director — and an openly gay maestro whose appointment signifies a turning point in New York culture. As Zachary Woolfe writes in this revealing (and often touching) profile:  While culture — particularly high culture — is indelibly associated with gay tastemakers, audiences and creators, it’s a sign of how outmoded our conception of authority is that remarkably few major performing arts leaders have been openly gay. In classical music and opera, even New York, the city that gave rise to the modern gay rights movement with the Stonewall riots 50 years ago this June, has been dominated since then by two conductors: Leonard Bernstein and James Levine, who both kept sexual relationships with men hidden. What matters most, of course, is Mr. Nézet-Séguin’s artistry. And I’m happy to report that his conducting in “Pelléas” on Tuesday was brilliant. Teasing out inner, deep voices, he made a rich score even richer — and inherently more Wagnerian, though you won’t hear any objection from me on that front. (I’d be remiss to not also mention the bass-baritone Kyle Ketelsen, a commanding and compelling Golaud.) Enjoy this clip of Mr. Nézet-Séguin leading the ominous opening bars of the opera. JOSHUA BARONE When Columbia Records originally produced its “Black Composers Series” — a nine-LP set, released between 1974 and ’78 — some reviews gently pondered the question of why such a collection might be necessary in the first place. More than four decades later, the failure of mainstream classical music programming to incorporate works by composers of color has not changed drastically for the better. All of which makes Sony’s reissue of the full “Black Composers Series,” on CD and digital platforms this month, a welcome development. The repertoire of the series included works by the 18th-century composer Joseph Bologne — a.k.a. the Chevalier de Saint-George — as well as then-contemporary pieces by artists like Hale Smith. The albums in Columbia’s series contained some smart sequencing, too (often pairing a composer’s best known works with comparative rarities). The LP dedicated to Mr. Bologne contains a compelling fragment from his opera “Ernestine.” A stretch of one LP devoted to William Grant Still kicks off with his Symphony No. 1 (which the Los Angeles Philharmonic is scheduled to play, next month, as part of a Harlem Renaissance festival). But the album also includes two arias from “Highway 1, U.S.A.,” Mr. Still’s rarely heard opera. Here, alongside the conductor Paul Freeman and the London Symphony Orchestra, tenor William Brown delivered a suitably dramatic version of “What Does He Know of Dreams?,” an aria for the opera’s stingingly arrogant villain. (What would it have sounded like if these artists had been given a budget to record the entire work? The mind reels.) Cutting-edge trends were also emphasized, on these Columbia albums. In particular, Olly Wilson’s “Akwan” — for piano, electric piano, amplified strings, and orchestra — proved a worthy addition to the madcap-modernist American catalog. And Ulysses Kay’s symphonic work “Markings” gleefully tears through a succession of textures, in its opening minutes: exploding with some percussive polyphony, before settling into some droning tones and more brooding themes. One of the most rewarding albums in Columbia’s series was split between works by three composers — including Adolphus Hailstork (who is still active, with a new commission set to debut at the Los Angeles Philharmonic’s series in February). The punchy finale of George Walker’s Piano Concerto, from that same album, gives a sense of the richness that Columbia’s series made available to a wider audience. Encountering the “Black Composers Series” anew, at this remove, can also feel a bit depressing — given these recordings’ implicit reminder of what’s still not being performed more widely, today. Though the documentation they provide remains enticing, on its own terms. SETH COLTER WALLS [Read Seth’s recent profile of the composer-performer Anthony Braxton.] Two of the most moving depictions of aging kings in opera come in quite different works: Philip II in Verdi’s “Don Carlo” and Arkel in Debussy’s “Pelléas et Mélisande.”  The great Italian bass Ferruccio Furlanetto has long been acclaimed as Verdi’s Philip, a monarch who, in a peacemaking political maneuver, marries the young French princess intended for his son and heir, Carlo. But this rash act reveals Philip as a hobbled and isolated leader threatened by his dreamy, idealistic son.  In the Metropolitan Opera’s 2010 production, conducted by Yannick Nézet-Séguin, Mr. Furlanetto brought grave authority touched with unbearable anguish to the profound Act IV aria “Ella giammai m’amo,” when Philip grieves over his loneliness as an unloved husband and as a king.  Here he is singing the aria at the Met. And now, at 69, Mr. Furlanetto, working again with Mr. Nézet-Séguin, is magnificent as Debussy’s Arkel, the leader of a sullen, troubled royal family. Though nearly-blind, this king sees clearly that we are all controlled by fates we can only guess at. The haunting “Pelléas,” a revival of Jonathan Miller’s production, is a highlight of this season.

These concerts were supposed to be conducted by Daniele Gatti, the Concertgebouw’s former chief conductor who was fired in August after accusations of sexual misconduct surfaced. In his place, this exceptional orchestra could do considerably worse than appoint the man who replaces him here, Daniel Harding. Thursday’s concert includes Brahms’s Symphony No. 4, Mozart’s Symphony No. 40 and Schumann’s “Manfred” Overture, to be performed with members of the National Youth Orchestra of the United States of America. Feb. 15’s concert is barely more daring, with Strauss’s “Ein Heldenleben” and Beethoven’s Piano Concerto No. 5, but at least there’s a new piece by Guillaume Connesson, “Eiréné.” Pierre-Laurent Aimard is the soloist. 212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org DANIIL TRIFONOV at Carnegie Hall (Feb. 9, 8 p.m.). Trifonov is the hotshot virtuoso of our time, but he’s also revealing himself to be particularly thoughtful with his choices of repertoire. Here he plays Beethoven’s “Andante favori” and Piano Sonata No. 18 in E flat, Schumann’s “Bunte Blätter” and “Presto passionato,” and Prokofiev’s Piano Sonata No. 8, the last of the “war sonatas.” 212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org "

The Metropolitan Opera rang in 2019 with a boffo “Adriana Lecouvreur,” featuring a love triangle of Anna Netrebko, Anita Rachvelishvili and Piotr Beczala with enough sizzle to lead some critics to warm to the not-always-respected work. More on that in a second. I was more than 4,000 miles away, celebrating in Vienna with a life-affirming 26-hour musical marathon: Strauss’s ‘’Die Fledermaus” at the State Opera on New Year’s Eve; more Strauss the next morning at the Vienna Philharmonic’s New Year’s Concert in the Musikverein; and the Vienna Symphony playing Beethoven’s Ninth that evening. Is there a more musical city? In the New York of my childhood, aggressive street hawkers offered drugs to passers-by. In Vienna they sound almost as furtive, but their pitch is: “Concert? Opera? Strauss? Mozart?” Here are some postcards. MICHAEL COOPER I’ve often wondered: Do the star conductors the Vienna Philharmonic brings in each year for its New Year’s concerts actually conduct, given that this music is practically this orchestra’s birthright? When I entered the mostly empty, majestically gilded Musikverein to watch the players rehearse with Christian Thielemann, the principal conductor of the Dresden Staatskapelle and music director of the Bayreuth Festival, I got an inkling. As he took to the podium, the shimmering strings announced that he was beginning the rehearsal at the end, with the traditional encore: Strauss’s “Blue Danube” Waltz. It is perhaps the most famous waltz there is, and one the orchestra could probably play in its sleep. But Mr. Thielmann was not one to let the players set the coordinates to 3/4 time and go on cruise control. He stopped them quite a bit, at one point asking the cellos to shape one of its most familiar phrases differently, and he continued fine-tuning the piece until he was happy. “It is wonderful to work with a strong partner,” Mr. Thielmann said in an interview, saying that he prefers orchestras like the Vienna Philharmonic, with strong points of view, to those that treat scores as blank slates to be filled in by conductors. “The weak partners are difficult.” The New Year’s concert must be the world’s most widely seen regularly held classical music event: It is televised in 91 nations, and before the month is out, Sony plans to release it on CD, DVD and Blu-ray. This year there were 14 cameras in the hall; some of the cameramen hid behind the copious floral arrangements, like hunters in a duck blind. It is not easy to bring off “Die Fledermaus” these days. Should it be updated? Translated? Made “relevant”? Can it be performed with a suitably Viennese sensibility? Without such second-guessing, the Vienna State Opera’s unapologetically old-fashioned Otto Schenk production, with opulent sets by Günther Schneider-Siemssen, still holds the stage on New Year’s Eve, as it has for years. (Mahler conducted the work when he led the company.) There were a few flash moments — the bass René Pape was the special guest in the second act, singing “Some Enchanted Evening” at Prince Orlofsky’s ball — but the evening’s chief pleasure was getting to see a production that took the work neither too seriously nor too lightly. The waltzes lilted, the patter went by quickly enough, and the cast amused — especially Adrian Eröd, who brought humorous, easy physicality to the role of the duped Eisenstein, and Annette Dasch, who brought operatic glamour as his wife, Rosalinde. And walking out of the opera house in time for an al fresco mug of hot mulled wine, followed by a cold glass of champagne, on Kärntner Strasse, as fireworks exploded overhead at midnight, made the evening difficult to replicate. For more than four decades, the Vienna Symphony has marked the changing of the year with Beethoven’s Symphony No. 9. While the Philharmonic’s morning concert was in the gilded Musikverein — where golden, topless caryatids seem to hold up the balconies and the richly coffered ceiling is even more dazzling than the crystal chandeliers — the Symphony’s evening concert was in the stately Konzerthaus, with its Secessionist and Art Nouveau touches. Something about seeing the physical differences of the two halls — the Musikverein opened in 1870, the Konzerthaus in 1913 — brought home just how long Emperor Franz Joseph, who was in power for both openings, reigned. They evoke different eras. Andrés Orozco-Estrada, who will succeed Philippe Jordan as the orchestra’s music director in 2021, conducted, and managed to bring out the true strangeness of the Ninth. Under his baton Beethoven’s stops and starts and changes of direction still startled. The stars of the Met’s new production of “Adriana Lecouvreur” could not be better: the ravishing soprano Anna Netrebko in the title role, the smoldering mezzo-soprano Anita Rachvelishvili as the Princess of Bouillon, and the clarion tenor Piotr Beczala as Maurizio, the dashing count both women love. It’s easy to overlook several excellent singers in supporting roles, especially the baritone Ambrogio Maestri as Michonnet, the gruff stage manager of the Parisian theater company where Adriana is a headliner. With his beefy voice and Falstaffian physique, Mr. Maestri often sounds like a kind of basso. And Falstaff, his signature role, which he has sung to acclaim at the Met, has also been the province of some major bass-baritones and basses. Still, Mr. Ambrogio is a genuine baritone, albeit with an exceptionally deep and booming voice, who has excelled as Puccini’s Scarpia and, as this excerpt from an “Aida” in Florence some years ago makes clear, Verdi’s Amonasro. Here, joining Hui He in the intense Act III duet, Mr. Ambrogio brings a winning blend of Italianate lyricism and robust power to his singing. ANTHONY TOMMASINI "

So it is here, with a program full of sets of variations, of homages, of reflections. One is found in John Adams’s “I Still Play,” a miniature tribute to the record producer Bob Hurwitz, and itself a nod to Hurwitz’s love of Bach. But Beethoven dominates, represented by the “Five Variations on ‘Rule Britannia’” and the “Eroica Variations,” as well as by his influence over Mendelssohn’s “Variations Sérieuses” and Schumann’s Fantasy in C. 212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org ‘LA FILLE DU RÉGIMENT’ at the Metropolitan Opera (Feb. 7, 7:30 p.m.; through March 2).

Most pianists play a good amount of Beethoven, but few have taken on the composer with such relish as Biss, whose engagement has included developing a remarkably popular online course, recording the sonatas steadily over time and writing a book on the whole experience.

Here the conductor gives the premiere of Julia Wolfe’s “Fire in My Mouth,” a reflection on the Triangle shirtwaist factory fire of 1911 and the death of 146 garment workers, most of them immigrants, in Manhattan. (An earlier politically engaged piece by Wolfe, “Anthracite Fields,” won the Pulitzer Prize in 2015.) The Philharmonic is joined by the Young People’s Chorus of New York City and the Crossing, an outstanding chamber choir. The projections and video are by Jeff Sugg, and the whole thing is directed by Anne Kauffman.

Grimly compelling this year, the Prototype festival of new music theater continues through Sunday, so get on it. The shows I saw last weekend are done on Saturday, so really get on it: And if you’re in Los Angeles (lucky you), check out the L.A. Phil, which is performing Philip Glass’s Symphony No. 12 — settings of lyrics from David Bowie’s album “Lodger” — under the baton of John Adams on Friday and Sunday. I spoke with Mr. Adams and Mr. Glass about the work: In other news: — The Metropolitan Opera’s “Aida” revival is a mess; “Carmen” is rather better. — The New York Philharmonic plays too damn loud. — The baritone Benjamin Appl is a Schubert whiz. Let’s play you out with Maria Callas’s “Aida” Triumphal Scene high E flat. Greet the weekend like she greets the closing of that Act II curtain! ZACHARY WOOLFE The welcome revival of interest in the composer Florence Price continues this week, with the release of a buoyant recording of her First and Fourth symphonies, with the Fort Smith Symphony of Arkansas conducted by John Jeter. Both works bear trace influences of folk forms — including, as the musicologist Douglas W. Shadle writes in the liner notes, a reference to “Wade in the Water” during the Fourth’s opening movement. But there are as many sections that seem like a composer channeling her own individual muse. Among the most compelling moments is the close of the Fourth — a scherzo full of slaloming melody (and, in the final minutes, some pleasingly potent tutti chords). SETH COLTER WALLS It says something that a song cycle of despair, heartbreak, alienation and yearning for death has become an anthem of our unsettled times. Schubert’s mournful “Winterreise,” which he worked on up to his death at 31, has been a regular feature of recent New York seasons, sung by some of the world’s greatest singers. I have seen stagings of the cycle, but I have never seen a performance more theatrical than the one the German baritone Benjamin Appl gave, without any props at all, on Thursday in the Park Avenue Armory’s intimate Board of Officers Room. It was the kind of vocal acting — fearlessly physical, with a broad palette of tones and styles, and a willingness to go for the occasional unbeautiful moment when called for by the text — that could devolve into histrionics. But Mr. Appl was utterly convincing. He made a vivid miniature of each song. For “Frühlingstraum,” Mr. Appl brought out the Jekyll-and-Hyde contrast terrifyingly. After singing the sweet opening passage, a vision of merry birds in a May meadow, he seemed to turn on a dime, changing his voice and bearing to deliver the shock of the next section: a bitter waking nightmare of crowing roosters, shrieking ravens and loneliness. It was only in those ferocious moments that you realized his foreshadowing: How, even in the loveliest passages of the song’s opening, there had been something unhinged in his voice, and his eyes. MICHAEL COOPER "
5c9e656f49f0eacbf105fcec,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/29/arts/music/kate-soper-new-york-festival-of-song-review.html,"For much of music history, songs were accompanied by an instrument that could act as a foil to the human voice. In recent decades electronics have often taken the place of the lute or piano, with dramatic effects. When the taped sounds contains snippets of the voice itself — recorded either beforehand or sampled live in performance — the distinction between song and accompaniment dissolves. But there’s also a risk that this dialogue with technology becomes little more than an echo chamber, too insular and self-validating. On Thursday at the DiMenna Center, the New York Festival of Song presented an evening of works for voice and electronics that sometimes felt sterile and self-absorbed. The program was designed by the composer and vocalist Kate Soper and opened with her performing her own “The Understanding of All Things.” The text is by Kafka and imagines a philosopher who snatches spinning tops from playing children in an attempt to understand reality. Ms. Soper’s setting takes a dryly literal approach, with recorded sounds of a spinning top mixing with scrambled phrases and her own live, fragmented, recitation. The attentive sound artist here and throughout the evening was Sam Pluta. Electronics can blur the border between human and machine-made sounds in a way that allows artists to play on themes like alienation, objectification and the splintering of the self. The composer Natacha Diels’s “Bahnhof” was a twist on the ancient myth of Philomela, the abused woman who, deprived of speech, turns into a nightingale. For this potentially arresting work — the props malfunctioned on Thursday — the soprano Charlotte Mundy donned special gloves outfitted with sensors at the fingertips and tethered with cables to a laptop. Standing, marionette-like, with outstretched arms, she produced wordless vocalizations accompanied by clicks, pops and wet sputters. In “quarks” the vocalist Charmaine Lee and Mr. Pluta created a dystopian world of thuds, gurgles and sandy abrasions through extended vocal techniques that were creatively miked, processed and amplified at often brutal volume. (One contact mike was taped to Ms. Lee’s neck with what looked like medical bandage.) At the center of a program of caustic sounds two works from the late 1990s formed an oasis of radiant beauty. In three selections from Alvin Lucier’s “Wave Songs,” Ms. Mundy produced long held notes on top of electronic sine waves in such a way that the minute pitch differences created a gently pulsating massage in the listener’s ear. Kaija Saariaho’s “Lonh” was a stunning example of the expressive riches that electronics can produce in the hands of a master of tone color. The text, by the medieval troubadour Jaufré Rudel, is the same one that inspired her luscious opera “L’Amour de Loin.” Here, the taped backdrop shimmered and bloomed underneath Ms. Mundy’s warm and soft-grained soprano in a way that deepened the sense of a lover drunk on unconsumed passion. The concert ended with two excerpts from an opera Ms. Soper is developing that also draws on medieval poetry — the “Romance of the Rose” — but uses texts of her own and by contemporary poets. “Shame’s Triple Aria Transformation,” performed with dramatic conviction by Devony Smith, distorts the voice with screechy, serrated effects. Ms. Soper performed the second selection, as an allegory of Reason, in which a neo-Classical piano part adds arch prettiness to a text that cleverly spins variations and puns on the same key words. In the electronic score microtonal dissonances similar to those in Mr. Lucier’s “Wave Songs” add a pale throbbing halo around the voice like a migraine aura. In “Lonh” the taped score drew the listener into a closer state of identification with the character. Here the electronics ensured cool detachment. "
5caf67dc49f0eacbf1f82d71,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/arts/music/george-crumb-90th-birthday.html,"MEDIA, Penn. — The sounds that filter into George Crumb’s composition studio here are a typically suburban mix of placid and suddenly brash. The occasional car skulks by on the leafy street outside. Visitors are greeted by vociferous barking from one of the shelter dogs rescued by Mr. Crumb and his wife of 70 years, Elizabeth. She keeps the radio on the classical music station most of the day, while their youngest son, Peter, who lives with them, blasts country in his bedroom upstairs. The music Mr. Crumb has dreamed up in this home studio, a converted garage, over the decades is often peaceful and jolting, like his sonic environment. But his compositions unfold in another world that is dreamlike and sometimes nightmarish. He continues to compose here even as he approaches his 90th birthday, coming in October. On Sunday and Tuesday, the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center gets in early on the celebration, presenting a two-concert tribute to Mr. Crumb at Alice Tully Hall. Included is the premiere of a new piece for percussion ensemble, as well as some of the classic works that have made him one of the most recognizable and beloved voices in contemporary music. Among them are “Vox Balaenae,” which draws whale-like sounds from a flute, and the Vietnam War-haunted “Black Angels” for amplified string quartet, which one critic called “a work of frightening intensity, where Jimi Hendrix and Pierrot Lunaire shake hands with the devil.” In “Music for a Summer Evening,” for two pianos and percussion, the musicians become celebrants in a mesmerizing ritual that requires the pianists to reach deep into the instrument’s strings. The pianist Gilbert Kalish, who has long championed this music and will perform in both concerts, spoke in an interview about Mr. Crumb’s expansion of the piano’s color palette through novel techniques. “It’s like a new instrument he’s invented,” he said. “And it’s really wild.” Mr. Crumb’s compositions inhabit a strange kind of suburbia themselves, a liminal space, rooted in the canon of Western music but venturing out into the world of natural sounds and acoustic phenomena. Echoes abound, whether from the careful manipulation of overtones and resonances or through the discreet halo created by metallic percussion. Mr. Crumb, who grew up in Charleston, W.Va., with the sound of a rushing river ricocheting off the surrounding hills, said early sound memories might have found a way into his music. “There were echoes constantly,” he said on a recent afternoon in his studio, as he sat in an office chair that allowed him to scoot back and forth between a desk piled high with scores and a piano in need of tuning. “I do think that composers inherit a kind of acoustic.” Fragments from other composers float through his works and settle in strange places. “Vox Balaenae” references the optimistic ascending brass fanfare of Strauss’s “Also Sprach Zarathustra,” but in so spectral a manner that it seems like a trick of the listener’s imagination. For much of Mr. Crumb’s career, such quotations were anathema to the reigning modernist ethos. But the battles that raged in the middle of the 20th century between warring aesthetic movements seem to have passed him by. Asked whether he was ever criticized for writing tonal pieces or quoting Chopin, Mr. Crumb replied innocently. “No, I don’t recall anything like that,” he said as his face creased into a smile. “Maybe they spoke about it, and I didn’t hear them.” While much of the respected music in those days was intellectual and a bit airless, “George was a maverick,” Mr. Kalish said. “His music was so appealing and emotional.” That’s not to say Mr. Crumb makes it easy for performers. His scores are known to delight and terrify musicians in equal measure. The hand-drawn staves on his manuscripts sometimes curve into circles or break up into islands in a sea of white paper. The flutist Tara Helen O’Connor, who will perform “Vox Balaenae” on Sunday, said in an interview that the arrangement of notes on the page in a Crumb score is “his way of expressing how the music flows through space, which is really beautiful and unique.” At the same time, she added, “it also leaves some of the magic and creativity up to the performer.” Folded into the elegant design are countless instructions, both exacting and poetic. Some of them read more like stage directions than expressive markings: Under the title “An Idyll for the Misbegotten,” a work for flute and drums, Mr. Crumb wrote “to be heard from afar, over a lake, on a moonlit evening in August.” “It puts the performer into that space,” Ms. O’Connor said. “Now I have a temperature; there’s insects and bugs; and there’s a thunderstorm brewing.” The music becomes an organic process: “It’s based in nature.” For Mr. Crumb, the process of designing his manuscripts and drawing each stave by hand is painstaking, but he wouldn’t have it any other way. “I just don’t like computer notation,” he said. “It all looks alike.” His works are loved by performers and audiences to a degree that few other living composers can match. Mr. Crumb counts over 20 recordings of his piano cycle “Makrokosmos” alone. Last fall, he received three new ones in the mail in the space of six weeks, made by pianists from Spain, Greece and Japan. But it’s not just the notation that’s laborious for Mr. Crumb. Over a long career he has produced just around 50 pieces, a number he compared, with a wistful laugh, with the more than 600 Mozart wrote in a much shorter life. He has said his productivity dipped in the 1980s and into the ’90s as he devoted himself to teaching. “You read about some composers who could write at the speed of wind,” Mr. Crumb said. “It was never that way for me. It’s like groping for something that’s resistant.” He gestured to the stacks of manuscript scores on his desk, with their custom-drawn staves and hand-lettered instructions. “You truly have to believe that you live forever,” he said. “Because it takes time.” "
5ca78f6f49f0eacbf1f81379,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/05/arts/music/janacek-diary-bam-review.html,"In the summer of 1917, the composer Leos Janacek met Kamila Stosslova. Both were married, and Stosslova was nearly 40 years younger, but they developed an intimate more-than-friendship: Janacek sent her more than 700 letters, increasingly intense, over the final decade of his life. The relationship — almost completely, and agonizingly, unconsummated — immediately inspired a late-in-life creative flowering. Janacek started writing his smoldering song cycle “Diary of One Who Disappeared” shortly after meeting Stosslova. The connection is obvious between that fateful meeting — and Janacek’s guilty passion — and the subject of “Diary,” which is playing through Saturday at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in a busy yet listless staging by Ivo van Hove. In the cycle, a young farmer abandons his home and family to go off with Zefka, a Gypsy woman he falls in love with. Janacek, no surprise, connected Zefka with Stosslova, whose dark hair and features he described as Gypsy-like. “I always thought about you in that work,” he later wrote to her. The Brooklyn production, directed by the inescapable, much-debated Mr. van Hove (“Network,” “A View From the Bridge,” “The Damned”) in collaboration with the Dutch company Muziektheater Transparant, clumsily brings this subtext to the fore. The young tenor protagonist (Andrew Dickinson), here a modern-day photographer puttering around his home darkroom, is doubled by an older male actor (Wim van der Grijn) wearing the same style of suit. We eventually come to realize that the actor represents Janacek, though this isn’t quite clear until the end, when he is burning papers and soberly intones the section of the composer’s will stating that a portion of the royalties from “Diary” and other late works inspired by Stosslova — his “Zefka” — will go to her after his death. Janacek’s “Diary” is an intimate, enigmatic series of not quite two dozen short songs accompanied by a solo piano, less than 40 minutes in all — as rich, and as transient, as a dream. It was hardly unusual in the classical tradition to create a song cycle tracking the agonies of love — think of Schubert’s and Schumann’s wrenching collections — but Janacek, working with anonymous poems that had appeared in a Czech newspaper, made things a bit more theatrical. The Gypsy love interest is not just sung about but also appears and sings, a haunting presence made even more so by an unseen chorus of three female voices. The cycle has been staged on rare occasions, but even in concert form, physical movement is suggested: The score indicates the points at which the mezzo-soprano soloist (in Brooklyn, Marie Hamard) should inconspicuously enter and leave, a spectral, passing reminder of a recalled time gone by. Mr. van Hove has swelled these suggestions into a full-on memory play. Interpolations of new music (Annelies Van Parys, politely unobtrusive) and spoken passages have added 20 minutes or so to the running time, turning Janacek’s jewel-box melancholy into a sluggish, stagy hour. Objects are angrily swept off a table. An urn full of the ashes of a long-ago lover is emptied into a sink. Lovers roll around on the floor. The music of “Diary” is often passionate, but this melodrama — the kind of needlessly heightened, smugly visceral stage action that’s characteristically van Hove-ian — feels out of place, false. Jan Versweyveld’s long, horizontal strip of a set is handsome; even more evocative is Mr. Versweyveld’s lighting, which occasionally turns this contemporary live-work space into something like a forest, with golden sunlight filtering through the leaves. But surprisingly little comes of the decision to make the main character a photographer. This choice feels less like a real reckoning with memory and loss than a way of solving the problem of how we are to know the identity of the woman onstage. (Our tenor has conveniently taken contact sheets full of shots of her, making it clear that she’s the Zefka he’s singing about.) Some effort is put into fleshing out Zefka’s character, with Ms. Van Parys contributing gentle, sinuous, chant-like settings of texts inspired by poems by Romany women, sung by Ms. Hamard and the offstage choir (Raphaële Green, Annelies Van Gramberen and Naomi Beeldens). It’s fine to try and give Zefka a fuller personality, but in practice it merely creates confusion, a muddle of memories. The real problem is that in Mr. van Hove’s staging, skulking around in a red dress, the character comes across as an even vaguer vixen than she does in Janacek’s score — less complex, not more so. There was subtlety in Lada Valesova’s piano playing, and some richness in Ms. Hamard’s voice. But Mr. Dickinson strained toward Janacek’s tensely ardent climaxes. At just 60 minutes, the evening feels inflated yet stingy. The punch line “and such small portions” came to mind. "
5c79030849f0eacbf105ad49,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/01/arts/music/american-composers-leon-botstein.html,"The composer Vivian Fine wrote acclaimed dance scores for Martha Graham and José Limón; brash, skillfully constructed orchestral pieces; and a raft of unusual chamber works. And if you’ve never heard of her, you’re not alone. Fine, who died in 2000, is among a sizable group of American composers from the middle of the 20th century who remain inexplicably overlooked today. Consider this: Though Fine taught for years at the Juilliard School and New York University, the New York Philharmonic has never performed her music. What explains this neglect? It might be collateral damage from a period when American composers squared off in opposing stylistic camps. On one side were those whose complex modernist languages involved various atonal and serial methods. On the other were self-described “postmodern” composers, who experimented with minimalism and found common ground with rock, jazz and ethnic music. As the polemics raged on, a large number of composers — including Fine, Walter Piston, Vincent Persichetti, Roy Harris, Harold Shapero and others — occupied a kind of neo-Classical middle ground. They continued using essentially tonal languages and tried to reinvigorate classical forms with fresh harmonic and rhythmic techniques. But they were perceived, especially by serialists based in universities who claimed the intellectual high ground, as dated and irrelevant. Many of these composers, though, brought well-honed skills, artistic integrity and a touch of American feistiness to their music. Conductors like Leonard Slatkin, Gerard Schwarz, Marin Alsop and others have tried to bring attention to them, to little avail. Last month Leon Botstein, who has tirelessly worked to bring to light worthy scores by neglected composers, led his American Symphony Orchestra at Carnegie Hall in the New York premiere of Fine’s Concertante for Piano and Orchestra (1944), with the accomplished pianist Charlie Albright as soloist, part of a program devoted to overlooked mid-20th-century American works. I knew some of Fine’s works, but not this bracing 17-minute piece in two movements. Though in her early years, Fine composed in a dissonance-saturated language of hard-edged contours and jagged counterpoint, she mellowed as she matured. This piece, an outlier, adopts a deliberately neo-Classical, almost neo-Baroque idiom and abounds in contrasts: Lacy, lyrical passages for piano often lead to stretches of tangled, industrious counterpoint; warm, rich string sonorities segue into flinty, brassy harmonies. The restless, spirited second movement is intoxicating. I especially love the moody first movement, especially a pensive, near-atonal episode about six minutes in. For more than 30 years, Piston was a respected music professor at Harvard. He literally wrote the book on harmony, a textbook still in use today. Yet his music came to be perceived, unfairly, as well made but a little, well, professorial. This great 25-minute viola concerto is just one of many Piston scores that should enter the repertory. During a meditative opening episode, the viola wanders lyrically atop clear-textured modal harmonies, until the music presses the opening melodic motif into service as a building block for the animated main section, rich with intricate interplay between soloist and orchestra. Amid brass fanfares, the finale takes off like some frenetic rondo, though metric dislocations and out-of-nowhere restrained passages keep you off guard. The slow middle movement is the most beguiling, a neo-Romantic Adagio with an intensely soulful viola theme cushioned by soft, wistful strings. This concerto could fill the slot on orchestra programs that typically goes to Mozart or Beethoven. Piston’s piece occupies a 1950s American version of the same neighborhood. In 1948, Aaron Copland wrote of his younger colleague  Shapero that “few musicians of our time put their pieces together with greater security,” adding that Shapero’s technical adroitness serves “a wonderfully spontaneous musical gift.” No work exemplifies this more than his 45-minute Symphony for Classical Orchestra. Leonard Bernstein conducted the premiere in 1948 with the Boston Symphony Orchestra. In 1953, he also led a recording, made on a single, hectic day while he was suffering from a fever. Though a little shaky, the recorded performance is exhilarating. Beethoven’s Seventh, slyly quoted at one point, was a model for Shapero’s piece, which opens with an elusive Adagio, all flickering chords and sustained sonorities, that shifts into a bustling, densely contrapuntal Allegro. A tenderly lyrical yet quizzical slow movement leads to a misbehaving scherzo, and then a herculean finale. André Previn had a triumph with the piece at the Los Angeles Philharmonic in the late 1980s and later recorded it. Though Mr. Botstein led a performance in 2016, this demanding piece mostly languishes today. American orchestras planning yet another run-through of Beethoven’s Seventh might instead take a crack as Shapero’s masterpiece. Dello Joio, born in New York, probably thought the future of this piece was assured when it was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Music in 1957. Alas, it’s all but disappeared. I last heard it performed by the Boston University Symphony Orchestra in the late 1970s. The string writing somehow remains shimmering and transparent even when sonorities turn thick and textures gnarly. The interplay between darkly contemplative music, as in the piercing “To everything there is a season” opening movement, and quixotic episodes, like the spirited “…and a time to dance and to laugh…,” is so deftly handled you hang on every shift. Of late, there has been a welcome renewal of interest in the Boston-born Irving Fine (no relation to Vivian). A splendid 2015 recording by the Boston Modern Orchestra Project drew fresh attention to his works. The album opens with his first completed orchestra score, the ebullient and impish Toccata Concertante (1947), a piece that could become a surefire concert opener for orchestras. His later, skittish, tartly modernist scores skillfully combine neo-Classical structures with a vigorous but free use of 12-tone techniques, as in the final movement of his 1962 Symphony, generally considered Fine’s major statement. He led a performance of the symphony at Tanglewood in 1962 just days before his death at 47. Yes, I know: Barber is hardly neglected. His Adagio for Strings is world-famous. But why is his darkly neo-Romantic and teeming Piano Concerto almost never performed these days? At its 1962 premiere by the Boston Symphony, with John Browning as soloist, which helped inaugurate what was then called Philharmonic Hall at Lincoln Center, the piece “made a decided hit with the audience,” Harold C. Schonberg of The New York Times reported, adding that it may be that Barber “has supplied a repertory piece.” Listen, and you’ll hear why. It ends with a demonic finale, full of pummeling chords and frenetic energy. Though Thomson completed this piece in 1928, it did not have its official premiere until 1945, when he conducted it with the New York Philharmonic. The piece can seem a dizzying assemblage built from distinctive musical chunks: evocations of old-time hymn-singing; a kind of spare, modal melodic writing that Thomson called his “Missouri plainchant” style; fractured fanfares and down-home-marches; faux-serious bursts of counterpoint. The musical language can be unabashedly brash and dissonant one moment, defiantly diatonic the next. Yet in a good performance it comes across as an inspired, if iconoclastic, entity, and somehow exuberantly “American” — whatever that means. No surprise: Mr. Botstein led the last performance I know of in New York, which was recorded live. May he keep up the fight for neglected 20th-century Americans. "
5c81164c49f0eacbf105bd3a,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/07/arts/music/esa-pekka-salonen-interview.html,"Last year, the composer and conductor Esa-Pekka Salonen took part in a discussion about the future of classical music at New York University. He found it interesting, he said in a recent interview, but also exasperating. “The gentleman doing the introduction was actually from the philosophy department,” said Mr. Salonen, who conducts the Philharmonia Orchestra of London at Lincoln Center on Sunday and Monday. “Painting the customary doom-and-gloom picture, with less money, audiences aging.” “It’s actually dangerous to equate the health of some institutions with the health of the art form,” Mr. Salonen, 60, added. Music is doing fine, he said — “it’s just that some institutions are having trouble. Those are completely different things.” Mr. Salonen — who seemed for a time happy to float in that just-fine realm of pure music, writing his own works and conducting selectively — is now diving back into those troubled institutions. The San Francisco Symphony recently made the surprise announcement that in 2020, when Michael Tilson Thomas steps aside after 25 years as its music director, Mr. Salonen will be his replacement. [Read about Mr. Salonen’s new position in San Francisco.] Since the late 1960s, when the fiery young Pierre Boulez said that the only solution to the entrenched conservatism of classical music was to blow up the opera houses and destroy all the art of the past, there have been calls for systemic change. Yet Boulez mellowed over time, and became a revered figure at leading opera houses and orchestras, working within the system to improve it rather than exploding it. And Mr. Salonen, who came to attention as a flinty Finnish modernist composer, has taken a similar course. Yes, he wants to shake things up, but from the inside. In taking on another orchestra directorship, a decade after leaving a landmark tenure at the Los Angeles Philharmonic, he hopes to find the sweet spot between gutting the system and maintaining what works. “The infrastructure of what we call classical music is going to evolve into something else,” Mr. Salonen said, though “we don’t quite know what it is.” But there is no reason to panic, he emphasized. “Obviously, it’s in no one’s interest to blow up the existing structure and start all over. It would be counterproductive.” Mr. Salonen will arrive in San Francisco with something of a head start: Mr. Thomas has fostered a climate of experimentation. And Mr. Salonen certainly proved himself a model of fresh thinking during his 17-year tenure as music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic. He has more recently refreshed the Philharmonia Orchestra as its principal conductor — including, in recent years, explorations of digital technology and virtual reality projects. [Read our review of Mr. Salonen’s most recent concert in San Francisco.] He comes at his new position, moreover, as a working composer. He suggested that, by “doing something as strange as writing new art music, you send out a very optimistic signal that I actually believe in this. And I believe in the longevity of the art form, and also believe there is a lot to be said still. When we talk about the masters, the underlying message is that the best has happened already. I don’t think so.” A symphony orchestra, Mr. Salonen said, is too often described as a mechanism with pieces people have put together. To him, an orchestra is an “organism” that “kind of grows.” Better ways to present it and integrate it into the community must be found. But, he made clear, “I don’t want to mess with the physiology of the orchestra.” So what is he willing to mess with? The weekly subscription-series programming format — “the grid,” as Mr. Salonen called it — increasingly seems an impediment to artistic vitality. “We are presented with a grid,” he explained, “and then you kind of fill it with content, and the content can be interesting, good and imaginative, but it still has to fit into the grid.” Most people today, especially younger listeners, don’t like to commit themselves months in advance, let alone to a series of concerts. Mr. Salonen envisions breaking up the season into blocks, maybe three or four, each with a thematic hook. With the culture increasingly diverse and fragmented, Mr. Salonen said, the “mainstream idea has all but disappeared.” Symphony orchestras and opera companies must accept that there is no musical mainstream, either, so institutions should try to reach “as many people as possible by catering to different tastes,” he said. That means not just unusual ventures of the kind he oversaw in Los Angeles — the Minimalist Jukebox series; festivals of film music; “The Tristan Project,” a performance of Wagner’s opera that employed as backdrops videos by Bill Viola — but also now and then a concert or mini festival devoted to Brahms or Sibelius, for those who want an immersion in a single composer. Who will help him conceive these programming blocks? Though he doesn’t know yet what to call them, Mr. Salonen has recruited a roster of mostly younger, visionary artists to advise him and create their own programs — a kind of “brain trust,” he said. This diverse creative team includes: the pianist and film composer Nicholas Britell; the soprano Julia Bullock; the flutist, educator and champion of new music Claire Chase; the violinist Pekka Kuusisto; the composer and guitarist Bryce Dessner; the composer Nico Muhly; the jazz bassist and vocalist Esperanza Spalding; and the artificial intelligence entrepreneur Carol Reiley. The “grid” will have to be loosened to allow these artists creative leeway, Mr. Salonen said. He says he’ll make it happen. Mr. Salonen has more problems with the promotion of classical music than with its substance. The message he said is often conveyed — “come and hear an immortal masterpiece performed by Maestro So-and-So and a great symphony orchestra” — is actually off-putting. “Lots of concert halls look like shrines or temples, like a Parthenon,” he added. “You climb up to make yourself worthy” and “walk out a better person.” “The good thing,” he said, “is that the actual material we are dealing with on a daily basis is fantastic” — some of “the best things humankind has ever produced.” He remains convinced that the ideal way to engage new listeners and give meaningful performances of those masterpieces is to present them alongside comparably ambitious modern and contemporary works. Mr. Salonen said that classical music is bungling what could be a selling point of orchestras. A Beyoncé concert might have a band of 20 on stage and 20,000 people in the audience, he said. That ratio is very different from what people get at the symphony, with roughly 100 players and 2,000 people. As a result, an orchestral concert becomes an event of “human energy, human expression — and people react strongly to that.” Despite his fascination with digital music resources and virtual reality, Mr. Salonen fretted that “90 percent of social media is about nothing.” “In my opinion,” he said, “when politicians say the reason for the fragmentation of culture is immigration, it’s absolutely not true.” The reason, he insisted, “is the media, which is usually not in the hands of immigrants. I think a lot of social media is trying to create some kind of belonging, some type of cultural connection.” A concert can provide that belonging. A program of symphonic music in a grand hall as an antidote to isolation bred by social media? Mr. Salonen — an explorer and, in the best sense, a traditionalist — makes a persuasive case. There’s a certain moment when you go off line and someone curates a space, with a piece, and the power of the ritual,” he said. “You have this moment, along with many others, but still a finite experience. It happens in real time, but it will never happen again, and you were there. You can let yourself go. And I think that’s actually a real liberation. We are going to need that more than ever before.” "
5c86b05d49f0eacbf105c7a7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/11/arts/music/carnegie-hall-vienna-philharmonic.html,"Say the phrase “classical music” and many will imagine a renowned symphony orchestra playing masterpieces of the distant past at Carnegie Hall. Last week, you could live that fantasy again and again at Carnegie, probably the most famous concert space in the world. The Vienna Philharmonic played towering works by Mozart, Beethoven, Brahms and Mahler over four programs. The Philadelphia Orchestra played Schubert’s Ninth Symphony. But music is about more than big symphonies, and it’s about more than the past. I went to nine concerts over seven days at Carnegie, a dizzying musical marathon, and it was a concentrated reminder that what is special about this art form is its variety — its intimacy and its grandeur, its capacity to draw inspiration from the past yet speak to the present. How to foster new music, support emerging composers and connect classical music — that inadequate term — to today, while also maintaining the legacy of major ensembles performing the great works of the past? And how to preserve that legacy? Faithfully honor historical performance styles? Jolt timeless scores with new approaches? Last week was just a random one at the hall, but it showed how Carnegie manages to engage all sides of these debates — the vast sprawl of the classical field in the 21st century — better than almost anywhere else. The hall’s three spaces make this range of repertory and experience possible. Sleek and modern Zankel Hall, down in the basement, hosted the premiere of a powerful multimedia piece dealing with racial profiling and a prison system that inordinately targets young African-American men. Zankel was small enough for the Chiaroscuro Quartet’s period instruments and mellow gut strings to be heard in a lean, dusky-toned account of Schubert’s “Death and the Maiden.” Snug, politely classic-looking Weill Recital Hall practically vibrated from the hip French harpsichordist Jean Rondeau’s concert, a walk on the wilder side of Bach and Scarlatti, while the master pianist Andras Schiff played Janacek and Schumann in the main auditorium. A single piano on that huge stage remains one of the most dramatic images in music. The tension between innovation and tradition was on display during the Vienna Philharmonic’s first program, on March 2, when Adam Fischer led a robust, majestic account of Beethoven’s “Eroica” Symphony. As always, you could bask in this magnificent orchestra’s resplendent sound — the warmth and body of the strings, the reedy tang of the woodwinds, the dark richness of the brass. Even during intense passages, the transparency of the playing was marvelous. Yet, for all its splendors, there was a slightly self-important quality to the performance that kept me a little distant, as if the orchestra was claiming ownership of a work from the glory days of Viennese classicism and showing an American audience how it’s played at home. That the Vienna Philharmonic, so beholden to tradition, can discover Beethoven anew was triumphantly proved a few nights later, when the pianist Igor Levit was the soloist in the Third Piano Concerto, with Michael Tilson Thomas conducting. In Mr. Levit’s hands, a probing performance can seem excitingly dangerous. A telling example was the extended development section of the first movement. This episode, lasting a few minutes, is marked to be played softly. At first, the movement’s stern main theme is recalled by the piano — but mysteriously, quietly, in octaves. Then, supported by the orchestra, the piano elongates the theme and takes exploratory excursions into genial-sounding passages of spiraling triples. But there was nothing genial about Mr. Levit’s approach. He played the whole episode not just softly, but as if whispered. Crucial notes were given just enough extra nudge to make them startling. The music-making was ruminative yet purposeful, unsettling yet assured. The next evening, Mr. Thomas led Mahler’s 85-minute Ninth Symphony, a work given its premiere in 1912 by, yes, the Vienna Philharmonic. As a musician who revels in the stylistic melting pot that is American musical culture, Mr. Thomas embraced the deliberate mix of the sublime and the banal, the hints of church chorales and country dances that run though Mahler’s symphonies, especially the Rondo-Burleske movement of this one. Yet he also conveyed the elaborate structure of the score. Here was a performance that drew upon the orchestra’s great heritage while pushing it to take risks. On Thursday, alas, I had to leave Mr. Rondeau’s recital early to make it to Mr. Schiff’s concert downstairs. Mr. Rondeau, with his long hair, scraggly beard and rumpled shirt, exuded wild-eyed charisma and channeled it into his performance. Dispatching Baroque passagework with impeccable clarity, even at breakneck tempos, he brought improvisational flair to his playing — he also plays jazz — especially an impetuous account of Bach’s Fantasia in C minor. It was a different mood in the main auditorium, where Mr. Schiff, wearing a three-piece suit, looked every bit the distinguished master as he bowed to the audience. Once he began Janacek’s episodic suite “On the Overgrown Path,” he played with searching insight, rhapsodic freedom and uncompromising musical integrity. And talk about bringing freshness to familiar repertory: The immensely gifted pianist Jan Lisiecki practically kick-started Mendelssohn’s youthful Piano Concerto in G minor into action on Friday with the Philadelphia Orchestra, led by Yannick Nézet-Séguin. But it was the raw, cry from the soul new work, “The Just and the Blind,” that has stayed with me from my marathon. Part of Carnegie’s 125 Commissions Project, begun in honor of the hall’s 125th birthday in 2016, it’s a 60-minute piece by the spoken-word poet Marc Bamuthi Joseph, with music by Daniel Bernard Roumain. Though it includes a dancer (Drew Dollaz), a vocalist (Somi) and projected animations and videos, the work is driven by Mr. Joseph’s stinging, brilliant words and is structured as a series of vignettes. Mr. Joseph voices the thoughts of a black father who admits to being afraid when, at night, he walks past young black men who look the same age as his son. Every day, he tells his son, the boy’s main mission in life is “to come home to me.” Stretches of Mr. Roumain’s score, which he mostly plays on piano and violin, are alternately jazzy and modernist. A rhythmically frenetic section will segue into a breezily cool passage. But Mr. Roumain knows when to pull the music back so Mr. Joseph’s searing words can do their work. Is this classical music? Perhaps not by traditional definitions. But it speaks to where Carnegie has come that it fit in at the hall just as well as the Vienna Philharmonic. "

This simple act of courtesy is the mission of Phil the Hall, the New York Philharmonic’s new initiative to reach out to a wide array of dedicated New Yorkers, including emergency medical workers, public service professionals and volunteers, and welcome them to special programs offering $5 tickets and general-admission seating. The Philharmonic contacted some 30 organizations, including Coalition for the Homeless, El Centro del Inmigrante, the Bowery Mission, New Women New Yorkers, God’s Love We Deliver and Queens Public Library. So David Geffen Hall was packed for the first concert on Thursday. The New York City Fire Department alone requested more than 1,000 tickets for the combined four performances. In her opening remarks, Deborah Borda, the Philharmonic’s president, welcomed everyone “to our house.” Yet, “from now on,” she said, hopefully, “you feel that this is your house, too.” For the Dutch-born Jaap van Zweden, in his first season as the Philharmonic’s music director, Phil the Hall offers a chance to introduce himself. The program he led, which lasted 75 minutes without intermission, combined works that showed the diversity of classical music, like Steven Stucky’s somberly beautiful “Elegy” from the 2008 oratorio “August 4, 1964,” and a few greatest hits, like the insistent first movement of Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony and Wagner’s exhilarating “Ride of the Valkyries,” performed here to the hilt. The orchestra chose an ideal host for the occasion, Nia Imani Franklin, a former Miss New York and the current Miss America. A trained soprano, Ms. Franklin also has a master’s degree in musical composition and is using her platform to advocate for arts education. [Check out our Culture Calendar here.] It was a great idea to include premieres of shorts works by two participants in the Philharmonic’s Very Young Composers program: Paloma Dineli Chesky and Mack Scocca-Ho, who are both 11 years old. Ms. Chesky’s “Rising,” an inspirational song, was written during a period of family difficulties, she told the audience. The music is meant to show that no matter the challenge, you can rise above it. She sang the soaring melody as the orchestra backed her with swaying strings and glistening percussion. Mr. Scocca-Ho’s “Ociantrose” is named for the capital of a made-up country where unity and order come from the people and are not imposed from above, he said in introducing the work. The music is brassy and industrious, with Baroque-like strands of crisscrossing lines, though the busyness gets interrupted by rhythmic disruptions. Mr. van Zweden led lively accounts of Bernstein’s Overture to “Candide” and Copland’s “Hoe-Down,” from “Rodeo.” The orchestra was joined by the Westminster Symphonic Choir for an ardent performance of Copland’s “The Promise of Living” from the opera “The Tender Land” and also the final work, Beethoven’s “Ode to Joy,” a very truncated version of the finale from the Ninth Symphony. Before conducting the ode, Mr. van Zweden said that Beethoven’s symphony is about “bringing the community together,” which is “what we did with you tonight.” "

And in the years since, he’s chosen to follow each of those paths — and sometimes both, simultaneously. Mr. Diehl has played with Cécile McLorin Salvant and Wynton Marsalis. His own recordings as a bandleader have revealed him to be not only a stylish improviser, but also a composer worth watching. In recent years, he has revived the practice of interpreting Gershwin’s concert music through an improvisatory filter. His imaginative yet idiomatic turn in the Concerto in F with the New York Philharmonic at their opening-night gala in 2016 contained the hardest-swinging note I’ve ever heard inside David Geffen Hall. (It was an interpolated low D that Mr. Diehl tossed off with casually elegant force toward the end of the first movement.) This weekend, Mr. Diehl plays “Rhapsody in Blue” (on Saturday) and the less familiar “Second Rhapsody” (on Sunday) with the Los Angeles Philharmonic as part of the brief but potent series “William Grant Still and the Harlem Renaissance.” “The challenge is creating this balance between the improvisation and the written score,” Mr. Diehl said of his approach to “Rhapsody in Blue.” Gershwin, in a way, is the exception this weekend: The rest of the Philharmonic’s programming puts the spotlight on black composers. William Grant Still’s symphonies serve as anchors of the programs, the First on Saturday and the Fourth on Sunday. Symphonic arrangements of works by Duke Ellington also appear all weekend, and a new piece — Adolphus Hailstork’s “Still Holding On” — will have its premiere on Sunday. (It’s one of the 50-plus commissions the orchestra has made as part of its centennial season.) An earlier orchestral miniature by Mr. Hailstork, “Celebration,” was captured in the 1970s for Columbia Records’s Black Composers Series, a set which was recently remastered and reissued. That recording was the conductor Thomas Wilkins’s introduction to Mr. Hailstork’s music. “I’ve always found him to be a great craftsman,” said Mr. Wilkins, who will be conducting the Los Angeles concerts. “You hear his upbringing in his music; you hear his culture in his music. But it’s not on the sleeve.” “It’s quite tonal,” he added, “but it’s not without chromaticism. And some of the time, because he’s sort of hinting at a blues lick or a jazz gesture, we find notes that are bent or twisted. Or a jazz harmony all of a sudden.” (Two other pieces by Mr. Hailstork will be performed by the Harlem Chamber Players on Feb. 28 at the New York Public Library’s Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture.) Mr. Wilkins said that he and the Philharmonic wanted to acknowledge Still’s earlier and better-known First Symphony — subtitled “The Afro-American Symphony” — but also push audiences toward less familiar parts of the composer’s body of work. “He’s unapologetic about being a black person,” said Mr. Wilkins. “In the last movement of the First Symphony, he begins with this plaintive song in the entire orchestra, that eventually finds its way to the cello section only — which I think is the instrument which sounds most like the human voice. There is this ‘Lord have mercy’ kind of sound in that music. And then, of course, the allegro takes over. It’s ‘we have no choice but to go forward.’ That’s what that music does.” In the Fourth Symphony, Mr. Wilkins identifies “that same longing, that same aspirational sound world. But this symphony ends not allegro, but profoundly — it’s like a pronouncement at the end. It’s grand, and the gestures are large and bold. And not lickety-split fast. It is its own kind of affirmation: ‘Yes, this is who I am.’” Asked what else they could imagine programming, were the Philharmonic’s short festival to be longer, Mr. Wilkins named William Dawson’s “Negro Folk Symphony” and “more Hailstork.” Mr. Diehl said he would be eager to tease out unexpected connections between different centuries: “I would have Scarlatti on, maybe, the top half of the set. And then end with, like, Roscoe Mitchell. I just feel like good music is good music. Duke Ellington always said that.” "
5c2f3cbc3a125f5075c02d2b,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/arts/music/matt-marks-little-death-prototype-festival.html,"In May, the musician Matt Marks died suddenly, of heart failure, after a performance with the ensemble Alarm Will Sound. It was a blow to the tight-knit world of contemporary music, in which the 38-year-old Mr. Marks was a prominent presence as a composer, vocalist and French horn player. Along with his prolific compositional output, he helped found Alarm Will Sound, as well as the New Music Gathering conference, and was a provocatively humorous mainstay on social media. [Read the New York Times obituary for Mr. Marks.] This community rallied to memorialize him. Alarm Will Sound started the Matt Marks Impact Fund to develop new works. Several of his close friends completed his score for a theatrical piece, “Words on the Street,” which had its debut in October. And on Tuesday at Roulette in Brooklyn, the Prototype: Opera/Theater/Now festival — which presented Mr. Marks’s opera “Mata Hari” in 2017 and runs from Jan. 5 through 13 this year — will revive his breakthrough 2010 work “The Little Death: Vol. 1.” Mr. Marks’s fiancée, the composer Mary Kouyoumdjian, has become the de facto steward of his musical legacy. “I don’t want him or his music to be forgotten,” she said in a recent interview. They had been close artistic collaborators, sharing drafts and producing each other’s recording sessions. “He was such a strong advocate for my own music and getting it out there,” she added, “that this is the smallest way for me to return the favor.” Much of Mr. Marks’s music draws together a permissive polystylism with a comedic irreverence toward the ritual trappings of classical music. In a 2016 recording he posted on SoundCloud, he dramatically — and hilariously — recited the pianist Khatia Buniatishvili’s hagiographic website biography atop the majestic theme from “Jurassic Park.” But his death has also brought into stark relief the intense intimacy that is the basis of several of his works, which were conceived during — and are partly about — personal relationships, and which now have a new emotional rawness. This is particularly apparent in the upcoming production of “The Little Death,” which Mr. Marks originally created in close collaboration with the soprano Mellissa Hughes while they were dating, and which has not been performed since they broke up in 2012. “I viscerally got sick,” Ms. Hughes recalled in an interview about being asked to revive the work at Prototype. “I couldn’t think about doing it, and it just felt wrong.” In 2006, as young New York-based classical music freelance artists, Mr. Marks and Ms. Hughes met on a bizarre gig: a PBS crossover special being filmed in Miami, in which their live performance was replaced by canned audio. They reconnected on Myspace, where Mr. Marks had posted some simple songs he had written. As they began dating, Mr. Marks’s compositions became more serious, and he increasingly wrote specifically for Ms. Hughes’s voice, culminating in “The Little Death.” Starring Mr. Marks and Ms. Hughes and billed as a “post-Christian nihilist pop opera,” it presented a love story of religious and sexual awakenings reinforced by Mr. Marks’s intricately wrought, omnivorous score: One exuberant duet combines electropop and the shape-note hymn “Wondrous Love.” A series of grandiosely cheeky performances in various spaces in New York, and a recording released on New Amsterdam Records in 2010, were heralded for embodying an emergent genre-crossing scene widely known as “indie classical” or “alt-classical.” Mr. Marks and Ms. Hughes worked on Vol. 2, but the project ended with their relationship. “I haven’t even sung through any of it or even really hummed through it since 2012,” Ms. Hughes said. “When you create something like that with somebody, it becomes a part of you, and so when you’re no longer with that person, it’s hard to revisit.” Electronic samples on the album, and passages in Mr. Marks’s libretto, memorialize inside jokes and moments in their real-life romance. “When I hear these things, it’s hard to remember,” Ms. Hughes said. “It’s like an audio graveyard.” “But it’s also beautiful,” she added. “It was a time in both of our lives that we were so creative, and we were young and poor and nobody knew us, and so we didn’t care. We wrote what we wrote.” That sincerity was a through line in Mr. Marks’s music, and motivated his exhaustive engagement with musical genres that might be looked down on by other composers. “One of the things that I respect about Christian music and Christian pop music is that they’re willing to get sentimental,” he told The Brooklyn Rail in 2010. “I think you can actually mess with people’s heads way more by going the sentimental route, playing with their heartstrings.” Since his death, moments on the “Little Death” album that might have once sounded arch — hokey chord progressions, campy melodic hooks — can unexpectedly arouse tears. And at the core of Mr. Marks’s compositional voice was his actual voice: a shape-shifting but always identifiable timbre that traversed a range as broad as his musical influences, whether the guttural bellows of his bonkers cover of the novelty song “Donde Esta Santa Claus,” or the sickly sweet falsetto deployed to embody a Karen Carpenter-obsessed, disaffected teenager in “A Song for Wade (This is not that song).” With his death, that irreplaceable component of much of his music is gone. “So many of the pieces that he wrote for himself to sing, it would not work without him,” said the composer Ted Hearne. Mr. Hearne sang in a “praise choir” assembled to accompany an early run of “The Little Death,” and will take on Mr. Marks’s part for the Prototype revival. Since the piece lacks a fully notated score, Mr. Hearne is learning the music primarily by listening closely to the album. “I have to be able to perform it with as much confidence and moxie and guts as he would,” he said. He helped persuade Ms. Hughes to sing, telling her, she recalled, “If you don’t do it, the piece dies with Matt.” “The Little Death” was Ms. Kouyoumdjian’s first introduction to Mr. Marks’s music. She was so captivated by a 2010 performance that, as she was leaving the concert, she walked into a glass door and broke her nose. She and Mr. Marks met a couple years later to discuss a potential collaboration with her ensemble, Hotel Elefant, and began dating. (That project was recorded before Mr. Marks’s death, and will be part of a future release of his music on New Amsterdam.) Mr. Marks was a longtime resident of Brooklyn, and he and Ms. Kouyoumdjian would often visit unfamiliar parts of the borough. One such excursion involved a bus trip — during which they shared a pair of headphones to listen to Mariah Carey — to the serene Salt Marsh Nature Center in Marine Park. Not long afterward, Mr. Marks began a new project, the pop monodrama “Headphone Splitter,” which takes a lightly fictionalized account of their date as its point of departure: The characters Matt and Baby cozily split headphones on the B41 to go bird-watching on a lazy Saturday, and witness a brutal ax murder. “Having this sixth sense of twisting everything sweet into something really dark, he thought, ‘Oh, this would be the perfect beginning for this murder mystery,’” Ms. Kouyoumdjian said. With the director Nick Leavens, “Headphone Splitter” was to be developed into a series of music videos driven by Mr. Marks’s singing, although he only recorded the first three episodes. In Chapter 1, atop swirlingly catchy electronics, Mr. Marks narrates the bus adventure with his characteristically zany swagger — “Baby, go on, pull out your headphone splitter. Sit close, we’ll listen to the soundtrack of ‘Glitter’” — followed by the sudden homicide. “It has so many elements of things Matt that loved so much,” Ms. Kouyoumdjian said: Brooklyn, low-budget horror films, macabre humor. “The music that he was writing more recently goes back to the music he was writing for ‘The Little Death,’” Ms. Kouyoumdjian added. “Projects like ‘Headphone Splitter’ that really celebrated him as a composer-performer, and were projects that he could do on his own. He could write his own text, which was something he loved; he could direct the idea and the vision of the project; and he could just sit at his computer and write and produce.” She is planning to release the two other episodes Mr. Marks completed, and may finish some of the rest of the series herself, although a crowdfunding campaign to support the project did not meet its goal. While Ms. Kouyoumdjian has been active as a composer — she has collaborated with the Kronos Quartet and is preparing a commission for the vocal ensemble Roomful of Teeth — she has lately focused more on tending Mr. Marks’s body of work. “It’s a lot easier for me to put energy toward his projects happening, at this point, than for my own,” she said. “Composition is really tricky. It really requires a lot of emotional vulnerability, and I think that that’s a space that’s difficult to be in for long periods of time after you lose somebody.” “Helping Matt’s music be a little more public,” she added, “is my way of still doing creative work, but in a way that feels right to me, right now.” "
5c5480473a125f5075c0796d,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/01/arts/music/layale-chaker-inner-rhyme.html,"As a young violinist growing up in Beirut, Layale Chaker moved between two musical worlds. At the city’s conservatory, she studied Mozart and Ravel with teachers imported from Eastern Europe. She knew there were young people studying Arabic violin in the same school, but the programs were segregated. On her walk home, she was engulfed by the sounds of Lebanese music filtering out of car radios and stores. “From the beginning you chose your path, Western or Arab,” Ms. Chaker, 28, said recently at her apartment in Brooklyn. “I never questioned it.” But questions arose later, as she traveled down the Western classical path, studying in Paris, London and at the prestigious Lucerne Festival Academy, and touring with the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra and Daniel Barenboim. “She was a particularly curious musician,” Mr. Barenboim said in an interview about Ms. Chaker, who would keep a full-orchestra study score at her feet during rehearsals. “That’s why I had this special affection for her.” But, she said, “I always felt like I was leaving a piece of myself behind.” In her final years in Beirut, Ms. Chaker had found an Iraqi violin teacher, Mohammed Abbas Hashim, who pushed her to improvise her own cadenzas to Mozart concertos and jam on traditional Arabic maqam scales as, she recalled, “a way to relax and let off some steam.” She sought out other masters of Arabic and Ottoman court music. In January, Ms. Chaker released “Inner Rhyme,” a haunting yet quietly rigorous album that integrates the disparate parts of her identity as a composer, performer and improviser who tiptoes along cultural fault lines. A recent performance at the Stone in Manhattan showed off the hallmarks of this music, built on the maqam scales of Arabic music, with jazzy flights of improvisation and fleeting echoes of early Baroque ornamentation. The pianist and composer Vijay Iyer witnessed the genesis of “Inner Rhyme” at a workshop he ran in Banff, Alberta. “We rigorously explored the microtones she worked with and tried to square them with a piano,” he said in a phone interview. “It created something that, to my ear, was unprecedented. It was like nothing I’d ever heard on this planet. It was coming out of traditions, but stepping into a real experimental sensibility.” Mr. Iyer introduced Ms. Chaker to some of the stylistically polyglot musicians who joined her in this project. The ensemble’s name, Sarafand, is that of a Palestinian village that became a ghost town after the founding of the state of Israel. Loss and exile are central themes, even if they are distilled into purely instrumental music. Ms. Chaker’s point of departure is poems written by Syrian, Iraqi and Palestinian writers whose political messages are sublimated in metaphors. She took their poetic meters and turned them into the rhythmic skeleton of her music. “On the Trunk of an Olive Tree” is inspired by verses by the Palestinian poet and former Israeli Knesset member Tawfik Ziad, which imagines him carving his history into bark. The violin line sits low in the instrument’s register, evoking a whisper, soft as a flute. Often there seems to be more breath than voice in these wordless poems, though other times Ms. Chaker draws full-bellied sounds, or sketches out silvery arpeggios while the bass or cello take center stage. Her other compositions include works for traditional classical forces, like a ruminative violin concerto and a restless string trio, both inflected with maqam modes. In these pieces she draws on her experience as an orchestral musician in Mr. Barenboim’s West-Eastern Divan. “Anything he said to anyone in the room I wrote down,” she said. “The Divan was really my school for orchestration. It’s interesting to have this experience from the seat in an orchestra — from the birth of sound.” Ms. Chaker said she hopes to counteract stereotypes of Arabic music as traditional and monolithic. “When you say ‘French music’ you think of the avant-garde,” she said. “You’re saying Messiaen or Debussy. It’s not the same with Arabic music. And I would like this to change. Because if a tradition is to survive, it has to come out of its box. To witness a contemporary life and a future, it has to be questioned.” "
5c44bc753a125f5075c05659,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/20/arts/music/review-esa-pekka-salonen-san-francisco.html,"SAN FRANCISCO — After leading his first concert as the San Francisco Symphony’s next music director here on Friday, Esa-Pekka Salonen said he had some advice for young conductors. His feet wrapped in impossibly glossy black leather as he spoke in a talkback interview on stage, he almost audibly winced: “Don’t conduct a concert in new shoes.” Even a veteran like Mr. Salonen, 60, couldn’t resist dressing up for the first day of school. The announcement last month that he would be this ensemble’s next conductor has been the talk of the music world, both because Mr. Salonen is one of the field’s only universally admired figures and because no one thought that he was in the market for a new job. Indeed, leaving in 2009 after 17 years as music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, he kept wriggling out when orchestras approached him, saying he wanted time to compose. I and many others hoped he would succeed Alan Gilbert at the New York Philharmonic a couple of years ago; it didn’t pan out. What did, and do, we see in him? Both a steward of music’s traditions and an explorer of the future. A vibrant interpreter of the music of others and a creator of his own. An artist who can star more than plausibly in an Apple commercial without seeming a sellout — one who’s thoughtful, even analytical, without ever seeming to try too hard. Almost no one else in classical music so completely satisfies our polarized demands for old and new, innovation and tradition, head and heart. As Mr. Salonen prepared to leave Los Angeles, Alex Ross wrote in The New Yorker that he’d become “a fixed point of cerebral cool in a city of spectacle and flux.” But if his persona has a certain wry distance to it, there is heat in his presence on the podium, and in his effect on orchestras. His connection to the San Francisco Symphony seemed close, confident and charged on Friday, just his fourth time leading the ensemble. (Classical marriages can be shotgun.) If his feet were bothering him, there was no betraying it in the music-making. That he was able to come here for a visit so soon after the announcement last month was happenstance. This weekend of concerts at Davies Symphony Hall was supposed to be conducted by Mirga Grazinyte-Tyla, who has canceled a spread of dates this season (including her debut with the New York Philharmonic) after giving birth in August. Mr. Salonen, who happened to be free, kept the second half of her program — Sibelius’s “Four Legends from the Kalevala” — and preceded it with Anna Thorvaldsdottir’s “Metacosmos” and Strauss’s “Also Sprach Zarathustra.” The message was clear: No soloist; no concerto (Ms. Grazinyte-Tyla was to have conducted the pianist Gabriela Montero in Tchaikovsky’s First); just the orchestra and its next leader. The results had polish and energy. Michael Tilson Thomas, stepping down as music director here after 25 years, has built an ensemble that plays with clean, versatile shine. (It can feel, in its agreeably open versatility, not so far from the Los Angeles Philharmonic.) The San Francisco string sound, in particular, is glistening yet full-bodied, never hysterical but with a lovely glitter to the tone. Russ deLuna played the crucial English horn solo in Sibelius’s “Swan of Tuonela” movement with self-effacing eloquence. Indeed, solos throughout the concert were alert yet unshowy, always with a sense that the big picture was more important than stealing a star moment. Mr. Salonen conducted the premiere of “Metacosmos” in April with the New York Philharmonic, and it makes a clever companion to “Also Sprach Zarathustra.” Both begin with the same low growl — though, as Ms. Thorvaldsdottir’s orchestra begins to rouse itself into a Strauss-style fanfare, it dolefully falls apart. This cycle of expansion and collapse defines the piece; lush, even cinematic gestures are pulled at by sickly downward moans. This was a powerful, logical “Zarathustra,” lithe and bombast-avoidant in a thrillingly controlled opening and airy in the lilting passages later on. Mr. Salonen’s Sibelius was lean and fevered. This isn’t an orchestra that does spectacular soft atmosphere, but moments like the stillness of the second movement, “Lemminkäinen in Tuonela,” when the barest shiver of violins is frosted by the barest shiver of rat-a-tat drum, were finely controlled. It was a performance not of effects or jarring contrasts, but of sustained force and focus. The classical field is now waiting to see what Mr. Salonen will do in his career’s full maturity. He has announced a benevolent little think-tank army of artists who will be helping him, including Nico Muhly, Esperanza Spalding and Julia Bullock, and their plans will germinate through next year, as the orchestra turns to celebrating Mr. Thomas’s final season. There is room for a refresh here. Mr. Thomas gained a reputation for fostering overlooked 20th-century American works, but on the calendar in Friday’s playbill, listing the orchestra’s programs through March 9, there’s a whole lot of Beethoven, Schumann, Mendelssohn and Mozart, as there is throughout the country. Mr. Salonen’s innovations shouldn’t stop at concert programming. My hope is that he manages, as no one really has, to do even more with the American orchestra than smart repertory selections and commissions — that he makes it a clearinghouse of cultural and intellectual activities that extends beyond just music. As the loud reception for him on Friday shows, he has the audience behind him on this new adventure. "
5c2fb04d3a125f5075c02e2d,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/arts/music/princeton-meditation-music.html,"PRINCETON, N.J. — For as long as I can remember, I have loved the silences of the concert hall almost as much as the sounds. The expectant hush that falls on an auditorium when the oboe’s A pierces through the hum of voices and the lights dim. The way a spellbound audience can wrap a protective silence around a pianissimo ending. But on a recent afternoon in Richardson Auditorium at Princeton University here, silence became an equal partner to the music. I was in the hall for a series called Live Music Meditation. (The next event, on March 28, features the violinist Patricia Kopatchinskaja.) For the first 20 minutes, while listeners quietly filed in, I sat motionless with my eyes closed, noting the sounds of footsteps and the rustle of coats. Gradually, the calm deepened, broken now and then by a male voice inviting us to focus on our breath, relax our shoulders, and clear our minds. From inside this stillness, the sound of a gong rang out like a bright explosion, followed by waves of amber overtones that seemed to dance with each other in space. Then more silence, long minutes of nothing to hear but the breathing of strangers. When the first notes of a clarinet threaded their way into my consciousness, they seemed to come from inside me. For the next half-hour, as a piano joined the clarinet, music wound its way through me as sound turned pure sensation. Eventually the last note settled back into silence. Then one more time the gong, followed by that male voice, sounding a little sheepish: “Some people would find it appropriate to clap now.” The applause, when it came, did seem out of place. And the performers, the clarinetist Martin Frost and the pianist Henrik Mawe, didn’t bow. In an onstage discussion after the unusual concert, they professed to being somewhat overwhelmed. “We were so aware of you listening to us so intensely that we started to listen to ourselves even more intensely, too,” Mr. Mawe said. An audience member told the musicians that, for him, “the most special thing was the silence before and after you played. There was anticipation without expectation.” The series, which is free to the public, was conceived by Dasha Koltunyuk, a pianist and a longtime member of a meditation group led by Matthew Weiner, a dean in the office of religious life at the university. By combining guided meditation with live music, she hoped to create a space in which, she said in a statement, “our tendency toward passivity or judgment while hearing music disperses into a pure, perceptive and receptive state of intense, present listening.” Composers have long played with silence. In the 20th century, they began to dissolve the border between scripted silence inside the music — the rests — and the ambient silence of a given acoustic space. Ligeti’s “Lux Aeterna” fades into seven bars of rest at the end. John Cage’s “4’33”” consists entirely of notated silence. These days, more presenters are experimenting with ways to make the audience aware of its role in creating the silence out of which music grows. When the artist Marina Abramovic presented the pianist Igor Levit in Bach’s “Goldberg” Variations at the Park Avenue Armory in 2015, listeners were relieved of their cellphones and outfitted with noise-dampening headphones that helped them sink into deep quiet for 30 minutes before the first notes of Bach. Concerts inside the Moab Music Festival’s red rock grotto in Utah begin with an invitation to take in the stillness of the natural setting. A two-minute “celebration of silence” is at the center of Chatter in Albuquerque, N.M., and Gather NYC at SubCulture in Manhattan, both Sunday morning series combining classical music and storytelling. In a telephone interview, the violinist and conductor David Felberg, who runs Chatter, said that most audience members close their eyes for that period. “They’re either meditating or trying to listen to the sounds that exist naturally around them,” he said. “For us, it’s a bit of a palate-cleanser. It’s almost like you’re fresh and ready to listen to the music.” Mr. Weiner, the Princeton dean, who led the guided meditation, said in an interview that he thinks of the quality created in the room not so much as silence but as sensitivity. In Buddhism, he said, that “doesn’t just mean verbal silence with your tongue. It means softening the constructions in your mind that get in the way of experiencing what’s in front of you.” As a critic normally tasked with shaping those constructions into written words, I was keenly aware of that softening. And as a diligent but novice meditator, I caught a glimpse, through the music, of what it means to let thoughts bubble up without engaging with them — through applause or judgment. Here was music not as a text to be read nor a recreational drug to be consumed for mood management, but as an audible process of coming-into-being and fading-away. And, for a short while, listening turned into a state of pure receptivity: beginner’s ear. "
5c62e9ea3a125f5075c09446,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/12/arts/music/review-yuja-wang-igudesman-joo-carnegie-hall.html,"In all seriousness: What can’t Yuja Wang do? This star pianist has built her reputation on breathtaking mastery of the standard repertory, like the chamber works she played last Wednesday with the violinist Leonidas Kavakos at Carnegie Hall. Or Robert Schumann’s Piano Concerto, which she’ll do with the Boston Symphony Orchestra later this week. But in between those two dates, she stopped by Carnegie’s Zankel Hall on Monday for something entirely different: a comedy show. One with music, of course. And, as always, she was radiant in Rachmaninoff and Lutoslawski. But there was — more. She rapped! She sang and danced through a “West Side Story” medley! She did one-legged, upside-down yoga on a piano bench! And along the way, she never lost an ounce of virtuosity. As part of Ms. Wang’s season-long Perspectives series at Carnegie, she was appearing with the musical comedy duo Igudesman & Joo — Aleksey Igudesman, violin, and Hyung-ki Joo, piano — in a program called “The Clone,” an evening-length version of a sketch they posted on YouTube in 2017. Their approach to performance taps into a joy and curiosity often left behind in music school, which is where Mr. Igudesman and Mr. Joo met as youngsters in Britain. What student hasn’t gone off book for the sake of a joke, to parody someone else’s mannerisms or change the key of a well-known piece for comedic effect? The more skilled you are, the better the results. There is no skill lacking in Igudesman & Joo’s act: They have training fit for the concerto circuit, though, in the tradition of P.D.Q. Bach, they have never surrendered the fun of exploiting the comedy in classical music. An entire bit at Zankel consisted of transposing Mozart’s “Rondo alla Turca” from A minor to A major. There’s a bit of subtle music theory education there, but the punch line was in the unexpected change of character brought on by the different key. They then went even further, adding B flats for a tinge of klezmer. Later, they seamlessly blended Gloria Gaynor’s “I Will Survive” with Mozart, early opera and hip-hop. In “The Clone,” however, those moments of playfulness and discovery were buried in jokes that quickly became uncomfortable, even offensive. The sketch’s conceit is a demonstration of all the capabilities of a hypothetical Yuja Wang clone. (Or robot? It’s never really clear.) She arrives in a large box that they say “smells of sweet and sour chicken.” The duo goes on to mock the Chinese language, and when the clone malfunctions, they laugh it off with a shrug: “Made in China!” Even more difficult to take was the implication that these two men had mail-ordered a woman who obeys their every command and casually accepts their frequent remarks about her sexuality. At one point, Mr. Joo turned to the audience and said, “God, she’s so hot.” Among the cheapest jokes was “How do you turn her on?” followed by “I can think of a couple of ways.” And in the opening, when Mr. Joo came out onstage dressed as her, he said, “I know I’m not Yuja Wang, but some girlfriends do call me Huge-a Wang.” It’s a shame. Because when the evening hewed more closely to truly musical comedy, it showed just how funny virtuosity — especially that of the multitalented Ms. Wang — can be. "
5c5a18fa3a125f5075c082bf,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/05/arts/music/new-york-philharmonic-2019-20-season.html,"Freshman year can excite with newness, but it’s as sophomores that people tend to come into their own. Jaap van Zweden’s reign as music director of the New York Philharmonic came into clearer view on Tuesday, when the orchestra announced its 2019-20 season, its second under his baton. There will be nods to the past, as in an exploration of Mahler’s time leading the Philharmonic in the final years of his life. There will be lots of new music, too, with Mr. van Zweden giving premieres by Philip Glass, Tania León, Nico Muhly, Sarah Kirkland Snider, Nina C. Young and Ellen Reid. And there will be experiments — as when he conducts Renée Fleming in Björk songs. To mark the centennial of the 19th Amendment, which barred states from denying voting rights based on gender, the Philharmonic has commissioned new works by 19 female composers, eight of which will be performed next season. Besides celebrating what Deborah Borda, the orchestra’s president and chief executive officer, called a “tectonic shift in American culture,” the project sends a statement to the classical music field at a moment when female composers still struggle to be heard. The pianist Daniil Trifonov will be the orchestra’s artist in residence. Visiting conductors will include Susanna Malkki, Esa-Pekka Salonen, Gustavo Dudamel, Simone Young, Franz Welser-Möst and Valery Gergiev. And the Philharmonic’s popular film series will offer screenings of “Close Encounters of the Third Kind,” “Psycho,” “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone,” “Singin’ in the Rain” and “Mary Poppins,” with the orchestra playing the scores live. With so much on tap, what do our critics and writers want to hear? With a little sleight of hand, Mr. van Zweden has moved the requisite start-of-season gala into early October; it’s a Beethoven program with the superstar pianist Lang Lang. But for his first subscription concerts he has chosen a somewhat bolder program: a new work by Mr. Glass; Barber’s “Knoxville: Summer of 1915,” with Broadway’s own Kelli O’Hara; and selections from Prokofiev’s “Romeo and Juliet.” ANTHONY TOMMASINI Splashily staged opera productions were among Alan Gilbert’s boldest innovations during his time at the Philharmonic’s helm. Mindful, perhaps, of their success, Mr. van Zweden will lead a staged double bill of two darkly brilliant early-20th-century works, directed by the Swedish stage designer Bengt Gomer using video, lighting and shadow actors. The formidable soprano Nina Stemme takes on Judith in “Bluebeard’s Castle” alongside the baritone Johannes Martin Kränzle; Katarina Karneus sings “Erwartung.” CORINNA da FONSECA-WOLLHEIM The first time I heard “Su” — Unsuk Chin’s 2009 concerto for sheng, a Chinese mouth organ — I nearly jumped out of my chair. I was using iPhone earbuds, but Ms. Chin’s imaginative exploration of timbre still packed a memorable punch. I’ve loved the work since that first encounter; it was my pick for our “5 Minutes That Will Make You Love Classical Music” feature last year. I’ll now have my first chance to hear it live, led by Ms. Malkki, with Wu Wei as soloist. SETH COLTER WALLS This fascinating program offers a hint of what might have been had Mr. Salonen, who is heading to the San Francisco Symphony, become the Philharmonic’s music director instead. Between rare performances of Schoenberg’s glittering orchestral transcriptions of two works by Bach, Mr. Salonen conducts a pair of his own scores: “Castor” (in its New York premiere) and “Pollux.” The program ends with Hindemith’s great “Mathis der Maler” Symphony. ANTHONY TOMMASINI Mr. Trifonov has justly rocketed to New York omnipresence, and has become a fixture at the Philharmonic, including a memorable traversal of Rachmaninoff’s concertos in 2015. This year he’ll play a relative rarity: Scriabin’s Piano Concerto, a Romantic but unassuming work that will benefit from Mr. Trifonov’s subtle delicacy. (Mr. van Zweden conducts.) His residency with the orchestra will also include a Mozart classic (the Piano Concerto No. 25); a solo recital of Bach and arrangements of Bach; and the New York premiere of his Piano Quintet. ZACHARY WOOLFE It’s not often that the Philharmonic devotes five performances to a single program. But it is handing over significant real estate to a star: Mr. Dudamel, who will lead Ives’s “The Unanswered Question,” Dvorak’s “New World” Symphony and a premiere by Esteban Benzecry. Two days after that run ends, Mr. Dudamel will be back for a program of Schubert’s Fourth Symphony and Mahler’s “Das Lied von der Erde.” JOSHUA BARONE Play Elgar and I’ll be there, but this whole program has a welcome, unforced focus to it, compared to much else in the Philharmonic’s sprawling season. Call it a Commonwealth affair, with Elgar’s “Enigma Variations” and the “Four Sea Interludes” from Britten’s “Peter Grimes” framing the American premiere of the Australian composer Brett Dean’s Cello Concerto. Alban Gerhardt is the soloist; the conductor, Simone Young, was born and started her career in Sydney. DAVID ALLEN Joan La Barbara is the kind of gifted, veteran New York composer the Philharmonic has often declined to notice. She’s experimentally minded, certainly, but her works contain plenty of more traditional operatic melody, too. All of which makes a commission from her — set to appear as part of the contemporary chamber music series “Sound On” alongside new works by Nicole Lizée and Paola Prestini — a potential highlight of the season. SETH COLTER WALLS Mr. Welser-Möst has not been on the Philharmonic’s podium since 2000, two years before he took charge of the Cleveland Orchestra. New York is on its third new music director since then, but he’s still going strong in Ohio, and returns with the kind of sophisticated, new-old program Cleveland audiences will recognize: Jörg Widmann’s suite of music from his 2012 opera “Babylon” — the Philharmonic’s answer to Carnegie Hall’s focus on Mr. Widmann next season — and Strauss’s “Symphonia Domestica.” ZACHARY WOOLFE It’s a work that should play to Mr. van Zweden’s strengths: Mahler’s Symphony No. 2 (“Resurrection”), a monumental exploration of mortality with moments of ferocity, tenderness, and, hopefully, transcendence. The lineup, featuring the soprano Joélle Harvey and the mezzo-soprano Sasha Cooke, is promising. And it will be nice to get to hear the immense work for its own sake rather than for a grand occasion: an orchestra’s return from a strike or the commemoration of a disaster. MICHAEL COOPER The Berlin installment of “Hotspots” — a short festival exploring musical creation in that city, Reykjavik and New York — is exciting for including the first time the Philharmonic will play the orchestral music of Olga Neuwirth. (She’s Austrian, but, then again, the Reykjavik program features a new work by Nico Muhly, a New Yorker.) Conducting Ms. Neuwirth’s premiere will be John Adams, on a program with his “City Noir” and a suite from Prokofiev’s “The Love for Three Oranges.” JOSHUA BARONE More Adams rounds out the season at David Geffen Hall: his luminous choral symphony “Harmonium,” with texts by Donne and Dickinson. The Philharmonic has done it just once before, and it’s unmissable. It concludes a program that also features Ms. Snider’s premiere and Shostakovich’s sprightly Concerto for Piano (Yuja Wang, in some luxury casting), Trumpet (the orchestra’s principal, Christopher Martin) and Strings. ZACHARY WOOLFE "
5c9941f149f0eacbf105ef73,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/25/arts/music/big-ears-festival-best-music.html,"KNOXVILLE, Tenn. — The Big Ears Festival started 10 years ago, disappeared, returned, reorganized as a nonprofit and has quietly grown year by year, filling theaters, clubs and galleries in downtown Knoxville. About 18,000 people attended this year’s festival from March 21-24. Rejecting musical genre classifications and spurning descriptions like “avant-garde” or “experimental,” Big Ears has never spelled out its aesthetic guidelines, and by now it doesn’t have to. It draws an audience that’s curious and ready to listen intently. The Big Ears lineup this year encompassed rock (Spiritualized, Mercury Rev), jazz (the Art Ensemble of Chicago, Bill Frisell, Mary Halvorson, Tim Berne), contemporary classical music (Bryce Dessner, Anna Thorvaldsdottir), string-band music (Punch Brothers, Bela Fleck), free improvisation (Evan Parker, Susie Ibarra), a folk opera (Rachel Grimes’s “The Way Forth”), a ballet (“Lucy Negro Redux”), silent films with live scores and a midnight-to-noon drone marathon that changed performers every half-hour. It featured multiple concerts of music by the pioneering Minimalist composers Alvin Lucier and Harold Budd; it celebrated the unconventional vocal techniques of the singers Joan La Barbara and Meredith Monk. It honored the 50th anniversary of the jazz-and-beyond label ECM Records and it gathered luminaries from Chicago’s “Great Black Music” collective, the Association for the Advancement of Creative Music. Instead of sales metrics or star power, Big Ears contemplates the perceptual properties of music: shades of dissonance and consonance, the particular qualities of a drone, the ever-changing applications of subtlety and brute force. There was music to soothe, music to jolt, music to ponder and music to dance to. Here are 15 of the most intriguing performers and performances. The English musician Shabaka Hutchings brought two of his groups to Big Ears, both of them built around his fat-toned, indefatigable tenor saxophone with beats derived from dance music and — his far-from-secret resource — carnival rhythms (he has Barbadian roots). He allows himself an extended solo now and then, but most of the time he pumps out short, hard riffs, all sinew and drive. Sons of Kemet is a four-piece band: just Hutchings, two drummers, and a tuba player who occupies the entire low register. It was muscular enough, but a late-night club set by The Comet Is Coming — Hutchings, a drummer, and a keyboardist who cranked up distorted rave bass lines — was so forceful it set off a mosh pit. The Canadian composer Kara-Lis Coverdale has released diverse albums of electronic music; she has also worked since her teens as a church organist. She used the pipe organ at the Church Street United Methodist Church for an eerie 47-minute piece that started with one of the very highest notes of the organ, alone: a keening whistle from somewhere far out of reach. Much of the piece stayed in those distant realms, sustaining tones beyond the power of human breath and letting tentative melodies hang in midair. She barely touched upon the earthy heft available in the organ’s lower register; this was an elevated, disembodied contemplation, patiently celestial. When punk had barely dawned, This Heat was already post-punk. From its start in 1976, This Heat was a contrarian band, dispensing corrosive noise, intricate math-rock patterns and cryptic, often politically charged lyrics. Two of its founders, Charles Bullen (on guitar) and Charles Hayward (on drums), revived the band’s repertoire in 2016 with This Is Not This Heat. Its Big Ears set was utterly precise in its cantankerousness, from the electronic screeching that ushered the band onstage to songs that blared and stopped cold, droned steadily or crashed and flailed, and set the Declaration of Independence to Arab-tinged reggae (in “Independence”); the songs’ bristling cynicism defies obsolescence. Big Ears, the group announced, would be its next-to-last show. Strictly speaking, Artifacts Trio — Nicole Mitchell on flute, Tomeka Reid on cello and Mike Reed on drums — started as a cover band. In 2015, the 50th anniversary of the Association for the Advancement of Creative Music, the trio revived compositions from the multitude of albums the association’s members have released: some swinging, some introspective, some textural. The lean, straightforward trio format and the tricky but frisky repertoire made an ideal showcase for Mitchell’s prodigious, playful virtuosity and Reid’s double duties of propulsion and melodic counterpoint. Playing solo classical guitar in ways that blur easy classifications of folk or jazz, Ralph Towner makes it seem as if his music were inventing itself on the spot. Phrases of melody appear in fluctuating tempos, as if they just occurred to him, soon followed by knotty chords that instantly recast the tune; swinging rhythms arise, take over for a while, then melt away. Each detail arrives as a discovery, though it’s clear that Towner has deep structure behind his spontaneity. He unveiled some brand-new pieces, and he cheerfully noted his recovery from triple-bypass surgery by playing a standard: “My Foolish Heart.” The methodical turns exhilarating in the music of Nik Bärtsch and his quartet, Ronin. Bärtsch starts with patterns — often a terse little riff in an odd meter — that get stacked up in countless ways, ricocheting from keyboard to bass clarinet to drums to electric bass, getting subdivided or having multiple instruments suddenly pile on. The repetition comes from Minimalism, the rhythmic flair from jazz and the unabashed impact from rock as all the parts click into place. Since the 1960s, Richard Thompson has been writing songs that face the bleak realities of mortality and hard luck. Backed by a string orchestra, he performed “K.I.A.: Killed in Action,” a set of songs about World War I based on letters and diaries from the era. It was somber, detailed and unflinching, with the strings as full participants. When Thompson sang “Gas,” about soldiers confronting poison gas for the first time, sustained strings switched to brittle pizzicato, conveying the sudden feeling of being unable to breathe. Lonnie Holley, a widely collected sculptor and painter from Alabama, started recording music in 2006 and released his first album in 2012, when he was 62. His voice is a bluesy, otherworldly moan with a hint of Sam Cooke and an occasional growl; his songs are verbal and musical improvisations, ruminating on the state of the world and the state of his soul. The Messthetics backed him on Friday afternoon with leisurely vamps topped by echoey keyboard and guitar as he sang about a fallen angel and about trying to reach the doorknob to heaven. His family once hoped Holley would be a preacher; between songs, he warned about a digital landscape where the “playground of foolishness” soon leads to the “quicksand field of stupidity.” All dressed in white, Meredith Monk and her four-woman ensemble of singers, dancers and musicians performed “Cellular Songs,” a collection of pieces that contemplates both biological cells and musical ones: the little cyclical figures that Monk assembles into compositions. With wordless syllables and occasional lyrics, and vocal styles suggesting a world of allusions, the songs hinted at games and rituals, with hints of comedy, and a group embrace at the end became an affirmation of solidarity. For decades, the Art Ensemble of Chicago was a close-knit quintet, until the deaths of some founding members. But at Big Ears, the Art Ensemble — still including its founder Roscoe Mitchell on alto saxophone and its longtime drummer, Famoudou Don Moye — appeared with more than a dozen musicians, including strings, brass, theremin, a singer (Rodolfo Cordova-Lebron) and a poet (Moor Mother). Its set was just as sprawling, touching on improvisational orchestral squall, dissonant chamber-jazz, a kind of parlor song and a musical jungle full of birdcalls. Its best moments were its most focused ones: swinging vamps propelled by Moye’s drumming, pointedly political poetry declaimed by Moor Mother — her “We Are on the Edge” is the title of an Art Ensemble album due April 26 — and a perpetual-motion tour-de-force by Mitchell, using circular breathing for a stretch of nonstop piping and squealing and scurrying that insisted, without a word, that after 50 years the Art Ensemble isn’t finished. Harold Budd’s compositions are often sparse and meditative, contemplating a handful of notes reverberating into silence. In a concert featuring new pieces, a small ensemble of instruments including harp, orchestral chimes, keyboard and cymbal shared momentary clusters of notes or fleeting motifs, like bits of crystal briefly catching the light. How would Josiah Wise, who records as serpentwithfeet, turn his studio-constructed, intricately overdubbed, often mournful and tormented songs into live performances? Two ways: with impassioned live vocals over prerecorded tracks and in solo piano versions. The canned music barely impeded the emotional power of his more drum-driven songs, and when he was at the piano, the songs shaded in and out of droll, spoken-sung monologues. As he courted singalongs, self-questioning turned into self-acceptance. A composer who has been working with electronics and samples since the 1970s, Carl Stone delivered a disorienting barrage from his laptop: bristling, relentlessly repetitive, stereo-hopping, rhythmic but dance-defying tracks that were so densely layered they seemed to raise the atmospheric pressure in the club. The new-music string quartet Brooklyn Rider has been collaborating for a decade with Kayhan Kalhor, who was born in Iran and plays the classical Persian spike fiddle called the kamancheh. They’ve learned from each other, with Brooklyn Rider picking up Persian inflections and bowing techniques and Kalhor adapting a traditional solo style to move in and out of the string ensemble. Their shared pieces orchestrated the kamancheh’s bite, and its echoes of ancient melodies, with harmonies and arrangements that extend and stoke the drama. No one can say Nils Frahm didn’t have enough equipment. He had two nests of multiple keyboards onstage for a solo show, and he used them all strategically: starting with toy-piano sounds and escalating through track upon track of keyboards and electronics, little melodies and blipping rhythm loops, showily adding each layer. When he settled down to a piano, the music drooped into new-age territory, but his hyperactive one-man-band act kept things popping. "
5c9e188249f0eacbf105fbf0,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/29/arts/music/beth-gibbons-portishead-polish-gorecki-3-symphony.html,"WARSAW — Beth Gibbons, the lead singer of the British band Portishead, released her first record in over a decade on Friday. But it’s not what you would expect from the singer whose wracked, yearning voice helped make Portishead a staple of every cool and heartbroken student’s dorm room in the 1990s. After the pioneering trip-hop of the band’s debut album, “Dummy,” and industrial beats of its last, “Third,” Gibbons’s newest release is a recording of the Polish composer Henryk Gorecki’s Symphony No. 3, known as the “Symphony of Sorrowful Songs.” Gorecki’s symphony, as its name suggests, is a doleful piece: The lyrics for one movement are taken from a message an 18-year-old scrawled on the walls of a prison during World War II. (“No mother, do not weep,” it begins.) That somehow didn’t stop it from being a surprise hit in the 1990s, with one recording selling over a million copies. That might sound like safe ground for Gibbons, a singer who specializes in tragedy. But it was apparently anything but. For a start, the symphony’s vocal part is written for a classical soprano; Gibbons’s voice doesn’t go that high. And all the lyrics are in Polish, a language Gibbons doesn’t speak. A news release for the recording said there were months of preparation for the 2014 concert where the recording was made. But how hard was it really for her to do this? The singer never gives interviews, and declined a request for one for this article. But some of the people who worked on the performance make it sound as if she had no problems at all. “A good singer can sing even in Chinese or Japanese,” the composer Krzysztof Penderecki, who conducted the performance, said in an interview in Warsaw last month. “It’s about emotional understanding. Beth, she did a very good job. She sounds really Polish.” Filip Berkowicz, a concert promoter who came up with the idea for the performance, agreed that Gibbons had few problems. “I knew she was well prepared, but I was very tense as she appeared on stage,” he said in an email. “But when she began to sing, tears ran down my cheeks.” There is only one way you can really realize what Gibbons put herself through: by trying to learn Gorecki’s Symphony No. 3 for yourself. So last month I tried to do just that, and had a lesson with Anna Marchwinska, the head of the music staff at Poland’s National Opera. She is also one of two women who trained Gibbons for the concert. “Polish is really hard to sing in, even for Poles,” said Marchwinska, before the lesson in her office at Warsaw’s opera house. “We have too many consonants.” She then wrote “Szczęście,” the Polish word for happiness on a pad. “See!” she said. “How do you sing that?” Marchwinska has coached singers in languages ranging from German to Hungarian, she said. Her method is to break each word down into syllables, and get the singer to repeat them, over and over, until they get it right and become used to the feel of the word in the mouth. If they can’t say it properly, she uses analogies to help them understand how something should sound or how to shape their lips. “Sex always works well,” she said. Once the first syllable is right, it’s onto the next, then the next, until a singer knows enough words to sing a line. “It can be very tedious,” Marchwinska said. “This is your first note,” Marchwinska then said, pointing to the score for Gorecki’s piece. “It’s an easy one,” she added. She then made the sound “sy,” the first part of “synku” (the Polish word for son). “She,” I replied. “Sy,” Marchwinska said. “She,” I said back. Marchwinska made a face that suggested she was not impressed. Gibbons and Marchwinska worked together over several weekends in 2014, when the singer traveled to the pop star’s home near Bristol, England. They held three sessions a day, each lasting about an hour, or until Gibbons’s children got in the way, Marchwinska said. “I enjoyed it,” she said, “ but I thought it was very difficult for her. She was frustrated a lot of the time. She wanted to quit a lot of the time, as she didn’t feel she could give justice to the music emotionally.” Emotion is the last thing any singer can actually add to music, Marchwinska said: Pronunciation comes first, then singing, then understanding. “It’s only then you can have the emotional interpretation,” she said. “It’s actually quite a complicated process, when I think about it.” I asked Marchwinska to teach me the symphony’s hardest vocal part and she jumped straight to a line that read, “Ej, cwierkejcie mu tam, wy ptosecki boze” (“Oh, sing for him, God’s little songbirds”). She read it out. I laughed: It sounded impossible to say, let alone sing. “When she heard it, Beth had the same reaction,” Marchwinska said. The first word turned out to be easy — it sounds like “ay” — but then we got to the next. Marchwinska said the first syllable: “Chfier,” it sounded like. I repeated it. Marchwinska told me to try again, and roll the “r.” She then told me to try saying it in a Scottish accent, to help get my tongue in the right place. After several more attempts, she gave up. “You can’t even roll your ‘r′s?” she said. “Beth could do that!” Even some opera singers struggle with new languages, Marchwinska said. In April, the Polish National Opera will perform “Billy Budd,” by Benjamin Britten, and a few members of the largely Polish cast were finding the English a challenge, she added. (A British vocal coach has been hired for the production.) But for most singers, used to French, German and Italian, another language is not a problem. Smartphones have helped, Marchwinska added, as singers can record lessons. (Gibbons recorded all hers.) Google Translate is also a godsend. Reading music, however, is a whole different skill. Gibbons couldn’t read a score properly when she started learning the piece, Marchwinska said. She had to draw Gibbons a simple one, with words and numbers rather than hundreds of notes. The symphony, for example, begins with a 12-minute passage for the orchestra; a piano note is then heard three times before the soprano enters. Marchwinska said she wrote the word “piano” in a space to represent the final piano note, and numbers to show that Gibbons should count to three, then sing. Given all this, it was no surprise to learn that Gibbons was nervous on the night of the performance and even asked Marchwinska what she should wear, Marchwinska said. (She decided against Marchwinska’s suggestion of a gown, and went for a simple black top and pants.) And what did Marchwinska think of the actual performance? “It was good,” she said. “It was so unusual.” When classical singers perform the symphony, it can sound similar each time, she said. “This,” she added, “was different.” "
5c38e1973a125f5075c03f83,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/11/arts/music/new-york-philharmonic-jaarvi-hrusa.html,"The pianist Gerald Moore, one of the great accompanists of the 20th century, called his memoir “Am I Too Loud?” It’s a question members of the New York Philharmonic should ask themselves on a regular basis. Gentlemen of the brass section: I’m talking to you. Conductors might want to pull up a chair, too. The Philharmonic’s sound has taken on a hard edge, disrupting some of music’s most glorious moments. Tutti eruptions that felt crude rather than grand blighted the orchestra’s two most recent programs at David Geffen Hall. On Jan. 3, Paavo Jarvi led Dvorak’s Cello Concerto, a Sibelius tone poem and Ravel’s Suite No. 2 from “Daphnis et Chloé.” This weekend’s program, which opened on Thursday under the direction of Jakub Hrusa, included Prokofiev’s Piano Concerto No. 3 and Rimsky-Korsakov’s “Scheherazade.” In both programs there was much to like, even to be thrilled by. The strings can be a marvel of cohesion and warmth. Individual solos — of the flutist Robert Langevin in the Ravel, or the concertmaster Frank Huang in “Scheherazade” — are exquisitely nuanced. But dynamic peaks tend to ring out harshly aggressive, with a sound that’s big without being full. Put delicately, fortissimos are not this orchestra’s forte. In the Dvorak concerto, the cellist Gautier Capuçon battled valiantly to assert himself against an ensemble that seemed intent on belittling him. His tone sounded tight and strained at first, but over the course of the first movement began to glow; his playing became eloquently assured. This is heroic music that builds pathos and excitement from the contrast of solo cello and large orchestra playing, yes, fortissimo. But while that Italian term translates as “loudest,” brawn should be matched by character. Dvorak marks these moments “grandioso.” They should be an exhilarating amplification of the cello-protagonist. Here, the ensemble obliterated him. In the hard-driving “Danse Générale” that concludes Ravel’s suite, there were more sledgehammer moments in which volume swallowed up color and complexity. (A shame, since the light-dappled opening “Daybreak” movement held glimpses of the Philharmonic’s playing at its most beguiling.) And in the start of the Rimsky-Korsakov on Thursday — this movement marked “maestoso,” or majestically — the huge brass statements burst out with saber-rattling strength but little majesty. The most satisfying part of that evening was the Prokofiev concerto with the ebullient pianist Simon Trpceski, who gave a performance that encompassed cartoonish humor and hushed lyricism. Mr. Hrusa is a charismatic conductor with a particular knack, evident in “Scheherazade,” for minutely shaping a string melody so that an entire section appears to play with the same effortless freedom as a soloist. Mr. Hrusa also managed to husband the dynamic forces in the Rimsky-Korsakov so that the most voluminous louds came near the end. But there, once again, the sound lacked the necessary roundness and texture to support the decibel burn. As the orchestra adapts to its new music director, Jaap van Zweden, who returns to the podium next week, its sound will surely evolve. The ability of a group of musicians to produce earth-shattering loudness with purely acoustic means is one of the joys of classical music, and a selling point in an age in which volume is cheap and controlled by a dial. It’s worth getting these fortissimos right. "
5c82b4d349f0eacbf105c1b3,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/arts/music/piano-concertos-thomas-ades-john-adams.html,"The attention of classical music in America on Thursday was divided between the opposite coasts. By coincidence, new piano concertos by two of the most important composers of our time had their premieres: Thomas Adès’s in Boston and John Adams’s in Los Angeles. [Read more about the dueling premieres.] There is a deep and rich tradition in the meeting between a solo pianist and a symphony orchestra. The results can be thunderous battle, delicate sympathy, genial play — sometimes all in the same piece. Mr. Adès, 48, and Mr. Adams, 72 — both with strongly individual voices, both keenly aware of what’s come before — are ideally suited to take on this looming history, and to contribute to it. David Allen, on the East Coast, and Zachary Woolfe, in the West, heard the results. BOSTON — Mr. Adès has written a piano concerto before, but not a Piano Concerto. Aside from a brief “Concerto Conciso” (1997) for piano and chamber ensemble, his main foray in the genre to this point has been “In Seven Days” (2008), a depiction of the Creation in seven movements, with optional video installation. His new and quite wonderful Concerto for Piano and Orchestra, which Kirill Gerstein played on Thursday with the composer leading the Boston Symphony Orchestra, is different. As Mr. Adès has put it, it’s a “proper piano concerto,” along the lines of Mozart or Bartok. It has no title. It has whistle-worthy themes. It has three movements, fast-slow-fast, marked only by their tempos. It has an opening in sonata form, with a first subject, a second subject, a development section, a recapitulation and a cadenza. It has a poignant, melodic second movement. It has a slithering, cascading finale, with a coda that ends with a cadential sequence Beethoven might have been proud of. It’s refreshingly, even radically, normal. Surely it can’t be so? Even if his style is relatively approachable, Thomas Adès still is Thomas Adès, the once-iconoclastic composer of mischievous, sardonic works like “Powder Her Face” (1995), “Totentanz” (2013) and “The Exterminating Angel” (2016). So you might expect me to point to some ironies I heard running as caustic undercurrents, tugging the whole thing down. Perhaps Mr. Adès is actually dismantling the concerto from within? Perhaps he’s offering a blistering, subversive take on what a frankly modern piano concerto can be, as he did more than 20 years ago for the symphony with “Asyla” (1997)? If he is, I didn’t hear it. Instead, Mr. Adès’s 20-minute work comes off as an affectionate, joyous, remarkably uncomplicated tribute to tradition. The writing is labyrinthine, to be sure, but this is a composer so sure of his abilities and influences that there is no sense in this concerto of history as a burden or as something to be thrown off. It is, rather, something to be approached as an equal. And while plenty of composers talk about how they have thought about the tradition when they write a new concerto, few have placed themselves in it with such breathtaking ease as Mr. Adès does here. As ever, the craft is astounding, the orchestration ceaselessly brilliant. The voice is wholly his own — dissonant, offbeat, whiplash, wry — even as it whispers to musics past. Something of the angular, unnerving opening theme bears an uncanny resemblance to the upward, four-note motif that George Gershwin used for the words “I got rhythm.” Something about the slow movement, which pulls at the heart with an open directness that’s unusual in this composer’s music, can be traced to the atmosphere of Beethoven’s Fourth Concerto, its powerful brass and wind chorale answered with placid wonder by the piano, at least at first. There’s a funny wink to hyper-Romantic excess when a glockenspiel tinkles above the fray at the end of the finale. The way a phrase will end, a mood shift, brings Rachmaninoff fluttering into mind. The technical demands are Lisztian and worse. Not that anything seems to daunt  Mr. Gerstein, the pianist who asked for the new work while rehearsing “In Seven Days” in Boston seven years ago. He dispatched this concerto with his customary virtuosity and commitment, but for all his double-octave flash, it was his tender voicing of the cluster chords that halo the melody of the slow movement that lingers in the ears. He played as if the concerto had been a friend for years. These two artists have struck quite the partnership; they play piano duos at Zankel Hall on March 13 and bring the new concerto to Carnegie on March 20. Also on the bill then will be the same pieces performed here in Boston: Liszt’s “Mephisto Waltz No. 1,” given a raunchy if not quite fluent reading, and a loud, bombastic, thrillingly crude take on Tchaikovsky’s Symphony No. 4. Be there. DAVID ALLEN LOS ANGELES — After Yuja Wang had finished playing the premiere of Mr. Adams’s concerto at Walt Disney Concert Hall here, and the applause wouldn’t stop, she returned to the stage for an encore. She played a piece by — who else? — John Adams. Dating back to 1977, “China Gates” is one of his earliest works, a short solo that’s a calm, steady precipitation of eighth notes: sometimes a smiling sunshower, sometimes a melancholy drizzle. Coming right after the new concerto, “Must the Devil Have All the Good Tunes?,” it gave a moving summary of how far Mr. Adams has come over 40 years, in musical complexity and emotional nuance. And also how much his preoccupations of those long-ago days — tension between rhythmic regularity and tremors of instability; simultaneous propulsion and reflection — still interest him today. Given its premiere by Gustavo Dudamel and the Los Angeles Philharmonic, which will tour it widely, “Must the Devil” is an uneasy experience: restless — indeed, relentless — but uncertain, pensive even when it’s peppy. Written during a period in which Mr. Adams also made a new opera, “Girls of the Golden West,” about the dark side of the California Gold Rush, the concerto comes across as a companion work. Another gloomy, even bitter, study in Americana, its most distinctive bit of orchestration is a part for honky-tonk piano (ideally a detuned upright, but on Thursday conjured electronically, and far too weakly) that evokes the saloons — and, implicitly, the chauvinistic illusions — of Hollywood westerns, while coming across as a devilish shadow of the “real” solo piano. In three parts, played as a single movement of not quite half an hour, “Must the Devil” begins in a sudden surge and chugs along industriously but with stumbles — a machine that fails to find its groove. The music builds in intricacy but remains oddly reticent, with unsettling snaps and buzzes (“gritty, funky, but in strict tempo,” Mr. Adams indicates for this first section) from the double basses and an electric bass, located on opposite sides of the orchestra. Relaxing into the second part with a lulling motif for bassoon and strings — you might think of Ravel — “Must the Devil” troubles the piano’s serenity with a sustained low tremble in the basses, and a disturbing plunk of honky-tonk. There’s early Adams (and the process Minimalism that preceded him) in the melodic thread forming in repeated fits and starts, trying to emerge and complete itself. In passages, the soloist seems to be trying out a kind of rag, but while the rhythm has a gentle, low-slung swing, the piano never finds its footing. The orchestra gently eggs the soloist on into the third section, inaugurated with frosty Adamsian fragments of trumpet fanfare. But there’s little sense of the triumph — or, at least, the reveling in extravagance and difficulty — of earlier finales by this composer. I found this conclusion much like the rest of the piece: anxious, fascinating, sad. The ending comes all at once: The hubbub suddenly drops away, leaving a single toll of a bell. Has someone died? Something? A culture? A country? Ms. Wang was an unfailing, cool to the touch, detailed soloist. Each note, even in a fast run, was precisely considered: a slippery smooth note followed by a diamond-hard one. The almost ominously immaculate quality of her playing was well suited to Mr. Adams’s dark fantasia, which offers virtuosity while staying — intentionally, I think — wary of its, and any, thrills. (There’s tellingly no cadenza to speak of.) After intermission, Mr. Dudamel’s interpretation of Mahler’s First Symphony recalled aspects of “Must the Devil”: the off-kilter quality and troubled lyricism of the first movement, the ruefully swirling third. But, in its straightforward — even bland — healthy-mindedness, this Mahler more than anything acted as a kind of peace offering after Mr. Adams’s beautifully disconcerting concerto. ZACHARY WOOLFE "
5c94a47349f0eacbf105e71e,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/22/arts/music/ivo-van-hove-brooklyn-academy-music-janacek-diary.html,"PARIS — A woman enters a studio apartment, makes herself some coffee and presses play on a tape recorder. “Sit at the piano,” a male voice on the tape says. A man stands in front of the projected image of a naked woman, her body imprinted on his white shirt. A couple embraces passionately on the floor as dappled light filters across their bodies. A man sits alone on a narrow bed. “I will be waiting for you,” he says, as the lights dim. These are some of the poetic, surprising images from Ivo van Hove’s staging of Leos Janacek’s song cycle “Diary of One Who Disappeared,” which will come to the Brooklyn Academy of Music April 4-6. Angular, lyrical and passionate, “Diary” — written for tenor, mezzo-soprano, a small chorus of three women, and piano — is rarely performed in concert, and it’s even more rarely staged. But it is pure drama. Based on an anonymous series of poems published in a Czech newspaper and completed in 1920, it tells the story of a young man who falls wildly in love with a Gypsy girl, abandoning his village and family to follow her. It’s an unusual project for Mr. van Hove, the Belgian director who has become one of the most important voices on the international theater scene. He has directed more than a dozen operas as well as classic and contemporary plays; adapted films for the stage; and soon will tackle a signature American musical, with his revival of “West Side Story” scheduled to come to Broadway next year. [Three of our critics debate Mr. van Hove’s work.] But a song cycle? “I haven’t done anything quite like this before,” he said in an interview at the Comédie-Française in Paris, where he was rehearsing a new production, “Electre/Oreste.” “You have to invent more,” he added. “An opera composer is thinking about staging, but with this you have to create a theatrical world. It’s bringing alive something that was just going to stand there and sing.” Mr. van Hove and his longtime partner, the designer Jan Versweyveld, drew from Janacek’s own history for the production. The story of “Diary” parallels the composer’s obsession with Kamila Stosslova, a married woman 35 years his junior, who inspired some of his most important works. “The black Gypsy girl in my ‘Diary of One Who Disappeared’ — that was you,” Janacek wrote in one of his more than 700 letters to Stosslova. “That’s why there’s so much emotional fire in the work. So much fire that if we both caught on, we’d be turned into ashes.” Mr. van Hove said: “I always adore when an author writes something that is a matter of life and death, which this is, I think, to Janacek. Some of my work, like ‘Electre/Oreste’ or ‘Boris Goudonov,’ is very political. But this one is about why we are here on earth, what is this life of ours?” Pulling out a few sheets of paper covered in neatly written notes, Mr. van Hove said that he always began a project by writing down his initial thoughts. “It’s important to remember why you want to do it,” he said. “This piece is really human. It’s not about gods and dramatic events; it’s about things that everyone has experienced. Everyone has been in love with someone who hasn’t been in love with him or her, or has experienced platonic love.” He added that he had long been a fan of Janacek’s music; his Flemish Opera production of “The Makropulos Case” in 2002 was one of his first forays into opera. He suggested “Diary” to the Muziektheater Transparant, a small, innovative opera company based in Antwerp, Belgium, with which he has long collaborated; he wanted to bring out Janacek’s ability “to write dialogue that became music, to turn language into notes. Even when they are singing, they are talking.” He and Mr. Versweyveld began to read Janacek’s diaries, and his letters to Stosslova. (The relationship remained almost entirely platonic, and most of her letters were destroyed by Janacek, at her request.) “I think Janacek saw his feelings reflected in the poems,” said Mr. van Hove. “It’s a kind of self-portrait. We started to see a framework to let this short song cycle shine.” Since the mezzo-soprano part is slight, he decided to give the Gypsy girl, Zefka, more of a voice. He asked the Belgian composer Annelies Van Parys to add more music for the character, which she based on Romany folk songs. “It’s full of colors, very personal and sensitive,” said Marie Hamard, who will sing the role in Brooklyn. “Annelies gives a true thickness and density to the feminine voice.” Mr. van Hove also incorporated extracts from Janacek’s diaries that are read by an actor (Wim van der Grijn) who is dressed to resemble an older version of the cycle’s tenor protagonist (Andrew Dickinson), emphasizing the similarities between composer and character. Working with the dramaturg Krystian Lada, Mr. van Hove and Mr. Versweyveld decided to make this main character a photographer, and the stage space, in part, a darkroom. “It’s an atelier, a world of imagination, in which the pictures that have been taken bring back the past that is sometimes forgotten,” Mr. van Hove said. Mr. Versweyveld said the challenge was to create an intimate space in which the character looks back on his life and love, but also to evoke the woods, trees and natural light that he is recalling. The solution was an apartment in which the character lives and works, permeated by golden, mottled light when the memories of glimpsing and meeting Zefka are evoked. “I like to design things that are functional,” Mr. Versweyveld said, adding that the mid-20th-century-modern set was inspired by the interiors of the photographer protagonist’s home in the Antonioni film “Blow Up.” Similarly, he added, “the light may be striking or beautiful, but it always serves a purpose. When it comes through the walls like light in a forest, it is opening up the space in the most dramatic moment in the show.” (Unlike in many van Hove productions, there is no video element.) Mr. van Hove said that his preparation for directing an opera or vocal score begins with finding a good recording, and working with a dramaturg who knows the music intimately. “I really study; it takes me three times as long for an opera as for a theater production,” he said, adding that while he doesn’t read music, he has learned to understand a score in terms of “where the opportunities are for a director.” “If you are not deeply interested in music,” he said, “stay away from it as a director, because there has always been a director there before you: the composer.” There are also practical issues to take into account. “You have to be sure,” he said, “that everything is absolutely constructed for singers, much more than with actors, because they have to take care of what they are singing, respond to others on stage, and also be able to see the conductor.” “It’s really music theater,” said Mr. van Hove, who added that the show’s genre — a combination of spoken word, music and visual elements — greatly interested him. His adaptation of Thomas Mann’s “Death in Venice,” incorporating music by Weber, Schoenberg and Nico Muhly, will have its premiere on April 4 with the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam. “What can it give us? What can it bring?” he added. “I would like to think about this in the next years.” "
5c51d1103a125f5075c07206,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/30/arts/music/carnegie-hall-beethoven.html,"What do you get the composer who has everything? More everything. Beethoven hardly lacks for exposure, but to mark the 250th anniversary of his birth, in 1770, Carnegie Hall announced on Wednesday that it would go all in, and devote roughly a fifth of its 2019-20 season to his music. All his piano sonatas. All his string quartets. Lots of his chamber music. And not one but two cycles of all nine symphonies: one performed on period instruments, with John Eliot Gardiner conducting the Orchestre Révolutionnaire et Romantique, and another on modern instruments, with Yannick Nézet-Séguin and the Philadelphia Orchestra. “We all feel this is really the pivotal figure in the history of Western classical music,” Clive Gillinson, Carnegie’s executive and artistic director, said in an interview. “Everything he touched, he changed and transformed.” Mr. Nézet-Séguin, who became music director of the Metropolitan Opera this season, will be the subject of a Perspectives series that will give New Yorkers a chance to hear him conduct all three of his ensembles: the Philadelphians, the Met Orchestra and the Orchestre Métropolitain of Montreal. The mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato, the singer-songwriter Angélique Kidjo and Mr. Gardiner will also have Perspectives series, and Jörg Widmann will hold the Richard and Barbara Debs Composer’s Chair. There’s a lot to chew on in the season, which will open Oct. 3 with Franz Welser-Möst conducting the Cleveland Orchestra, and will end June 21 with Daniel Barenboim and the Vienna Philharmonic. So here is a tip sheet, with critics and writers for The New York Times highlighting some of the concerts that intrigue them next season. MUNICH PHILHARMONIC (OCT. 25-26) AND BAVARIAN RADIO SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (NOV. 8-9) ORCHESTRE MÉTROPOLITAIN (NOV. 22) AND ORCHESTRE SYMPHONIQUE DE MONTRÉAL (MARCH 24) The season brings a couple of battle-of-the-bands moments. Most halls would be happy to import a single orchestra from Munich or Montreal, but Carnegie is bringing a pair from each city. So New York audiences will be able to contrast performances of Valery Gergiev conducting the Munich Philharmonic with those of Mariss Jansons leading its neighboring Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra. And they will be able to compare the Orchestre Symphonique de Montréal, under the baton of Kent Nagano, with that city’s lesser-known ensemble, the Orchestre Métropolitain. MICHAEL COOPER AMERICAN COMPOSERS ORCHESTRA, NOV. 13 This ensemble’s reliably excellent taste results in a program that features new orchestrations of Ives songs by Hilary Purrington and Hannah Lash, as well as the premiere of a guitar concerto by Ms. Purrington. Her recent “A Clarion Call” is packed with haunted harmonies and riotous humor that Ives might well have admired. SETH COLTER WALLS IRISH CHAMBER ORCHESTRA, NOV. 19 Unique synergies often develop when an orchestra is led by a composer-performer. In his collaboration with the Irish Chamber Orchestra, Jörg Widmann, as conductor and solo clarinetist, serves up a meticulously balanced program with compositions that showcase his debt to Bach (“Versuch über die Fuge”) and rock (“180 beats per minute”) alongside works by Mendelssohn, Weber and Mozart’s own Bach-flavored Adagio and Fugue in C minor. CORINNA da FONSECA-WOLLHEIM CONRAD TAO, NOV. 20 KIRILL GERSTEIN, FEB. 20 IGOR LEVIT, MAY 5 A great way to refresh repertory staples is to perform them alongside new and recent works. The brilliant young pianist and composer Conrad Tao offers a particularly bold example of this approach in his solo recital at Weill Recital Hall, which fascinatingly juxtaposes the old (Bach, Rachmaninoff, Schumann) and the new (David Lang, Julia Wolfe, Jason Eckardt). At Zankel Hall, the formidable Kirill Gerstein will play unusual works by Liszt, Brahms and Gyorgy Kurtag steeped in Hungarian dances and folk song, as well as pieces by Haydn, Busoni, Bartok (the flinty, seldom-heard Piano Sonata), Thomas Adès and, to end, Schubert’s exuberant “Wanderer” Fantasy. Igor Levit will join Carnegie’s Beethoven salute in Stern Auditorium with Sonatas No. 9, 10 and 11, and the still-astounding “Hammerklavier.” ANTHONY TOMMASINI SO PERCUSSION, DEC. 7 The program for this virtuosic and often mind-opening quartet, “A Century of Percussion,” is something of a greatest hits concert. They will revisit pieces like David Lang’s “the so-called laws of nature,” Steve Reich’s “Music for Pieces of Wood” and John Cage’s “Third Construction.” But the evening will also include the local premiere of a new work by Julia Wolfe. JOSHUA BARONE ORCHESTRE RÉVOLUTIONNAIRE ET ROMANTIQUE, FEB. 19-24 There is hardly a shortage of recordings of Beethoven’s symphonies, but the one I inevitably turn to is John Eliot Gardiner’s vigorous, colorful, altogether vital cycle with this period-instrument ensemble. After a pair of crack Berlioz performances at Carnegie this past fall, this team is surely ready to put the old Ludwig van through his paces. ZACHARY WOOLFE THE CROSSING, MARCH 25 Such is their radiant sound and the vibrancy of the repertory they’ve cultivated, it’s gotten to the point I’d hear anything this Philadelphia vocal ensemble sings. At Carnegie they’ll join the cellist Maya Beiser, whose charismatic cross-genre experiments have seductive savvy, in the New York premiere of Michael Gordon’s “Travel Guide to Nicaragua.” ZACHARY WOOLFE BOSTON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA, APRIL 15 After presenting Act II of Wagner’s “Tristan und Isolde” at Carnegie last spring, the Bostonians will be back, under the baton of Andris Nelsons, for Act III. These two concerts are a test drive for the tenor Jonas Kaufmann, who has been gradually rolling out his Tristan. (Other cast members include Emily Magee as Isolde and Günther Groissböck as King Marke.) JOSHUA BARONE QUATUOR ÉBÈNE, APRIL 17-MAY 2 Even outside of anniversary years, cycles of the Beethoven string quartets mushroom all over the concert landscape. But this French ensemble, known for its passionate and rigorous playing, is sure to bring something special to its six-concert survey in the spring. Do stick around for the encores, which these players use to shoot off in unexpected directions with improvised takes on folk music, jazz or the Beatles. CORINNA da FONSECA-WOLLHEIM TIMO ANDRES, APRIL 29 Aaron Copland’s mid-20th-century Piano Sonata is the oldest work you’ll find in this solo recital, which features a wide range of pieces by contemporary composers like John Adams, Donnacha Dennehy and Frederic Rzewski — and, of course, Mr. Andres himself. Later in the evening is a premiere from the young composer Gabriella Smith. JOSHUA BARONE MAURIZIO POLLINI, MAY 17 There’s enough Beethoven this season to last a lifetime, but it’s a lifetime of Beethoven that Mr. Pollini, 78 years young, will bring to this performance of the final three piano sonatas. There’s no artist I’d rather hear play this music. DAVID ALLEN VIENNA PHILHARMONIC, JUNE 19-21 Poor Mahler, with just six performances of his symphonies next season at Carnegie. I wouldn’t want to miss Michael Tilson Thomas conducting the Sixth in his farewell performance at the hall before stepping down as music director of the San Francisco Symphony (March 18), but Daniel Barenboim has a peculiar, productive way with these scores that makes these concerts more promising than the norm. He leads the Fifth, Seventh and Ninth. DAVID ALLEN "
5c668e133a125f5075c09e0e,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/15/nyregion/saturdays-in-the-bronx-with-bach.html,"Sean Arias, 7, casually dressed in sweats and sneakers, climbed atop the piano bench, sat down on an aging textbook — a makeshift booster seat — and rested his feet on a copy of The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz. His instructor, Santiago Lomelin, a doctoral student at Rutgers University, led him through a series of warm-ups before flipping open a book to a short Bach piece. “Let’s learn a new song,” Mr. Lomelin said. Sean edged forward with finicky excitement, peering at the notes. He paused for a moment, processing — then leaned back in his seat and began to play, exploring the music with an impressive dexterity. “This program — thank God,” whispered Sean’s mother, Vanessa Peña, who was seated behind him in the practice room. “It’s been a true blessing. I’ve seen my son blossom.” Step into the Bronx Community College’s Guggenheim Hall at 8:45 on Saturday morning and you’ll find the sleepy weekend routine of the average American university: empty hallways, unlit classrooms, the hiss of a radiator. Fifteen minutes later, though, the place transforms — brimming with children (some as young as 4) and a handful of adults, each of them here for one-on-one classical instruction with some of New York’s most promising musicians. It’s a recurring scramble for classical music in a city perpetually starved for space. Since 1991, the Bronx Conservatory of Music, a nonprofit arts organization, has provided low-cost education in classical music to a constituency that has been historically underexposed to the tradition. And at a time when music classes are being cut from public schools everywhere, it has become an unlikely success story: a weekly pop-up school that trains students, more than 80 percent of whom are black or Hispanic, in a musical tradition long characterized by a lack of racial diversity. In the last four years, the school, led by a team of talented and ambitious young instructors, has seen its enrollment more than triple — there are around 170 students now, up from 50. But that success may ultimately jeopardize the school. The surge in students has led to increased anxiety about its relationship with Bronx Community College, which has allowed the school to operate out of its music department on Saturdays free of charge. “We’re really at capacity now in this location,” said Douglas W. Meyer, the conservatory’s music director and treasurer. He described the program’s arrangement with the college for the last three decades as an essential part of its operating model. “We’re able to provide competitive compensation to our teachers and the lowest possible tuition rates to our students because we are the recipient of the largess of the college, for which we are eternally grateful,” he said. “The good news is, we don’t have to maintain permanent facilities,” Mr. Meyer explained. “The flip side is that we’re here at the pleasure of the college.”  Changes to the arrangement, he said, could easily pose an existential threat; a rise in costs to offset rental payments, for example, could push the price of lessons beyond the reach of many students. A lack of permanent facilities also means that students must find a place to practice during the week. Students studying violin, cello and guitar can borrow an instrument from the school. (Many were donated to the school by WQXR, the city’s classical music radio station, following one of its instrument drives.)  But for students of piano, far and away the most popular instrument at the school, finding a piano to use can be a challenge.  “The dream,” said Philip Kwoka, the school’s executive director, “is to raise enough money for a permanent space where kids can come all throughout the week to practice.” Since space is already limited, the school has had to add dozens of families every year to its wait-list. “Our goal is eventually to be in a position where we can give everyone who’s interested an opportunity to study here.” It’s exactly the deal that draws in many of the families. The Bronx Conservatory charges $23 for a 30-minute lesson and $46 for an hour, and those prices include supplemental group-based instruction in rhythm, percussion and music theory. (Elsewhere in New York City, private music lessons can easily top $100 per hour.)  The teachers at the conservatory are mostly young graduates or postgraduates from schools in and around New York: Juilliard, Mannes, the Manhattan School of Music. Most balance teaching schedules with their own performance demands. “This school makes classical musical accessible to us,” said Frayma Rodriguez, who attended Bronx Community College and whose son, Jeremy, 11, studies guitar at the conservatory. “It’s here in the community, and it’s not too expensive.” Martha Forte, whose son, Antonio, 8, studies violin, travels from Yonkers each Saturday for his lessons. “The Yonkers public schools, they’ve slowly cut arts programs to bare bones,” she said. “It’s a 20-minute drive to get here, but it’s so much more affordable.” Ms. Forte is especially impressed with the commitment of the instructors, she said, adding that Antonio’s teacher, Katherine Dennis, will often FaceTime with the family during the week to help Antonio address various musical issues. Despite its relatively small size, the Bronx Conservatory has had ripple effects in the broader community. Janell Alvarez, 16, has attended the conservatory since she was 7, first as a student of piano and later of voice. When changes at her local church, St. Helena’s in Parkchester, left one of its Masses without an organist, Janell trained to fill in for the role. She now performs at the 5 p.m. service every Sunday. The school has been similarly transformative for Joaquin Estrella, a 10-year-old piano student. One of the school’s more advanced pianists, Joaquin won a full scholarship through the Bronx Conservatory last year to attend a summer camp at the Luzerne Music Center, an immersive musical program in New York’s Adirondack Mountains. “That was a very special experience for me,” said Joaquin, who wants to be a professional musician. “It gave me a chance to fit in.” His father, Jorge, stressed the importance of having found a suitable arts program that’s situated in the Bronx, where the family lives. “There’s a lot of cultural richness here, but the borough is really drained of resources,” Mr. Estrella said. “And if we want the Bronx to thrive, then we have to make a commitment to change, and to stay here, and to support programs like this.” That support is sometimes hard to come by. Fund-raising is now one of the organization’s biggest focuses, according to Mr. Kwoka, who is eager to find a way to welcome all the students currently on the wait-list and to provide more scholarships. But there are always smaller concerns, too: filing tax forms, registering students, rearranging teaching schedules to accommodate absences. And at the end of each Saturday, Mr. Kwoka has to pack away his computer, tidy the classrooms and box up the printer. By then, Guggenheim Hall has transformed back into a college campus. There is little to suggest that dozens of kids have spent their Saturday here playing classical music — aside, perhaps, from a set of music stands that might seem curiously low to the college students who use them during the week. "
5c78116e49f0eacbf105aae2,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/28/obituaries/andre-previn-dead.html,"André Previn, who blurred the boundaries between jazz, pop and classical music — and between composing, conducting and performing — in an extraordinarily eclectic, award-filled career, died on Thursday at his home in Manhattan. He was 89. His death was confirmed by his manager, Linda Petrikova. Mr. Previn wrote or arranged the music for dozens of movies and received four Academy Awards, and was nominated for three Oscars in one year alone — 1961, for the scores for “Elmer Gantry” and “Bells Are Ringing” and the song “Faraway Part of Town” from the comedy “Pepe.” Audiences knew him as well as a jazz pianist who appeared with Ella Fitzgerald, among others, and as a composer who turned out musicals, orchestral works, chamber music, operas and concertos, including several for his fifth wife, the violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter. He was also the music director or principal conductor of a half-dozen orchestras. [Listen to the full range of Mr. Previn’s multifaceted career.] Critics described Mr. Previn as a “wunderkind in a turtleneck” and the “Mickey Mouse maestro” when he was in his 20s and 30s. He was often compared to Leonard Bernstein, a similarly versatile conductor, composer and pianist. Time magazine’s headline when Mr. Previn became the principal conductor of the London Symphony in 1968 was “Almost Like Bernstein.” Newsweek summarized his appointment as music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic in 1985 as “Bernstein West.” And like Bernstein, Mr. Previn was no stranger to a life of glamour and media attention, particularly when the actress Mia Farrow left Frank Sinatra, her husband, and married Mr. Previn after an affair that had become grist for the gossip columns. “See you in the Morning beloved Friend,” Ms. Farrow, who was divorced from Mr. Previn in 1979, tweeted on Thursday. “May you rest in glorious symphonies.” Mr. Previn himself considered Bernstein an idol. “Bernstein has made it possible not to specialize in one area of music,” he said. “You no longer have to do just Broadway shows, or movies, or conduct — you can do any or all of them.” And Mr. Previn did. In the 1960s, he appeared in sold-out classical and jazz concerts. Sometimes he combined genres, playing a concerto before intermission and jazz with a trio after. Dizzy Gillespie marveled at his performances. “He has the flow, you know, which a lot of guys don’t have and won’t ever get,” he said. Mr. Previn made recordings with Benny Carter and Mahalia Jackson and an album of jazz arrangements of songs from “My Fair Lady” with the drummer Shelly Manne and the bass player Leroy Vinnegar. (Mr. Previn was later the conductor and music supervisor for the film version of “My Fair Lady.”) He also made two albums with Dinah Shore and recorded a collection of Christmas carols with Julie Andrews and George Gershwin’s “Rhapsody in Blue” with Andre Kostelanetz. But the classical world was never comfortable with his work in jazz, and the jazz historian Ted Gioia said Mr. Previn had been “something of a popularizer of jazz rather than a serious practitioner.” Mr. Previn disdained all the labels. “I never considered myself a jazz musician,” he said in 1986, “but a musician who occasionally played jazz.” He was born Andreas Ludwig Priwin on April 6, 1929, in Berlin. After his parents realized he had perfect pitch — his father had been an amateur pianist in Berlin — André entered the Berlin Conservatory when he was 6. His father, Jacob, a Polish-born lawyer who was Jewish, moved the family to Paris in 1938 to escape the Nazis. While in Paris, Mr. Previn later recalled, he had some lessons with Marcel Dupré before the family left for Los Angeles about a year later. There, he studied with the composer and conductor Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco, the violinist and composer Joseph Achron and the composer Ernst Toch. He soon recorded all the four-hand piano music of Mozart with the composer Lukas Foss, who was not quite seven years older than Mr. Previn. Mr. Previn became an American citizen in 1943, and in 1950 he was drafted into the Army and served with the Sixth Army Band. He also studied conducting in San Francisco with Pierre Monteux, whom he later followed at the London Symphony. A relative worked in the music department at Universal Studios, and Mr. Previn wrote music for movies even before he went into the Army. As a senior in high school, he was called in to help with “Holiday in Mexico,” a 1946 MGM musical starring Walter Pidgeon. (A young Fidel Castro was an extra.) The script called for the concert pianist Jose Iturbi to play some jazz, but he was uncomfortable improvising and wanted a score to read. Mr. Previn went to a jam session, listened and wrote out a piano part for Mr. Iturbi to play when the cameras rolled. MGM took notice and hired Mr. Previn to compose and conduct the music for “The Sun Comes Up,” starring Lassie and the once-illustrious actress Jeanette MacDonald, who was allergic to dogs. “Go figure that billing,” he once said. Years after its premiere in 1949, he gave the movie a thumbs-down. “Like all Lassie pictures,” he said, “there was hardly any dialogue, but a lot of barking. I thought it was easy, but I have since put myself through the wringer of watching it on a television rerun, and it’s the most inept score you ever heard.” But front-office executives realized that Mr. Previn could handle the deadlines that went with studio work, and they put him on what he called “an endless stream of cheap, fast movies.” Not all his assignments fit that description. He collected Oscars for scoring “Gigi” (1959), “Porgy and Bess” (1960), “Irma La Douce” (1964) and “My Fair Lady” (1965). He did not write classic songs like “Summertime” and “I Could Have Danced All Night”; rather, he arranged and orchestrated them, creating the soundtrack versions. Like Bernstein, Mr. Previn also tried Broadway. With Alan Jay Lerner, he wrote “Coco,” a musical about the designer Coco Chanel that starred Katharine Hepburn and ran for 329 performances in 1969 and 1970. He also wrote the music for “The Good Companions,” a musical with lyrics by Johnny Mercer that ran for 252 performances in London in 1974. Also like Bernstein, Mr. Previn was a crowd-pleaser as a conductor. Five years after his surprise appointment in London, the British magazine New Statesman complained that he had given the orchestra “a strong American accent: the big-screen sound, rich, loud and brilliant.” But it said his programs on the BBC — which prefigured by a few years the American public-television series “Previn and the Pittsburgh,” broadcast when he was the music director of the Pittsburgh Symphony — had “clearly widened his box-office appeal.” “Whereas Boulez looks boring and Boult looks bored,” the magazine said, referring to the prominent conductors Pierre Boulez and Adrian Boult, “Previn always seems to be enjoying himself.” He remained principal conductor of the London Symphony until 1979; he was also the principal conductor of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra from 1985 to 1988. In the United States, he held the Pittsburgh job from 1976 to 1984 right before taking over in Los Angeles. Mr. Previn resigned the Los Angeles post in 1989, complaining that the orchestra’s managing director, Ernest Fleischmann, had maneuvered to bring in Esa-Pekka Salonen as his successor. “It has become obvious to me that there is no room for a music director,” Mr. Previn said when he quit. Mr. Salonen was named music director-designate a few months later. As he approached 70, Mr. Previn turned to opera, writing “A Streetcar Named Desire” to a libretto by Philip Littell based on the Tennessee Williams play. Renée Fleming sang the role of Blanche DuBois in the premiere with the San Francisco Opera in 1998, with Mr. Previn on the podium. Bernard Holland, reviewing the performance for The New York Times, wrote that “it sings very well.” “There are angry clashes of harmony and key,” he added, “many Straussian gestures, sweet-as-honey popular melody and the kinds of corporate noodling and mumbling among the strings native to a Ligeti or a Penderecki.” A recording with the San Francisco cast won the Grand Prix du Disque. Mr. Previn also won 10 competitive Grammys from 1958 to 2004, divided evenly between classical and nonclassical categories, and a lifetime achievement Grammy in 2010. The second of his two operas was “Brief Encounter” (2007), with a libretto by John Caird based on Noël Coward’s screenplay for the 1945 David Lean film by that name. Toward the end of his life, Mr. Previn seemed surprised at the interest in his compositions. ”I wrote a string quartet that I very diffidently mentioned to the Emerson Quartet,” he told the critic David Patrick Stearns in 2017. “And they said, ‘Where is it?’ I’m not used to that.” In 2017, Ms. Fleming gave several performances of a song cycle he wrote, “Lyrical Yeats.” “These brief songs display Mr. Previn’s keen ear for the telling detail, for musical gestures that set a mood or conjure an image,” Corinna da Fonseca-Wollheim wrote in The Times when Ms. Fleming sang them in a solo recital at Carnegie Hall. In 2018, Ms. Mutter played “The Fifth Season,” for violin and piano, which she and Carnegie Hall had commissioned. She described it as “rather lighthearted.” This year, Tanglewood had planned events to celebrate Mr. Previn’s 90th birthday, including a performance of the violin concerto “Anne-Sophie” with Ms. Mutter and, with Ms. Fleming and the Emerson quartet, the premiere of “Penelope,” by Mr. Previn and the playwright Tom Stoppard. Tanglewood said the events would now be framed as a celebration of his life and work, although it was not immediately clear if Mr. Previn had finished “Penelope.” Mr. Previn wrote several books, including “Orchestra” (1979), a depiction of the lives of orchestral musicians, and a memoir of his movie experiences, “No Minor Chords: My Days in Hollywood” (1991). Mr. Previn’s first wife, Betty Bennett, was a singer he had seen in San Francisco jazz clubs. They had two daughters, Claudia and Alicia, also known as Lovely (who became a violinist in the Irish band In Tua Nua), and divorced in 1958. His second marriage was to Dory Langan, an MGM lyricist, who, after they separated, recorded several albums as a singer-songwriter under the name Dory Previn, many of them reflections on their breakup and its aftermath. Dory Previn died in 2012. Their divorce in 1970 was prompted by the well-publicized affair between Mr. Previn and Ms. Farrow, who had been a friend of Ms. Previn’s. Ms. Farrow divorced Sinatra in 1968 and married Mr. Previn in 1970. They had three children, Matthew and Sascha, who were twins, and Fletcher. They also adopted three daughters: Summer Song, known as Daisy; Soon-Yi, who married Woody Allen in 1997; and Lark, who died in 2008. Mr. Previn’s fourth wife was Heather Hales Sneddon. They had a son, Lukas, and a daugher, Li-An, and divorced in 2002. He and Ms. Mutter married in 2002 and divorced in 2006 but continued to perform together. “You know how people say that their marriage didn’t work?” he said in 2017. “With us, the divorce didn’t work. We call each other every day regardless of where we are. Maybe she’s in China and I’m in Cincinnati, but we find each other. It’s like being very best friends who have a romantic history.” Complete information on his survivors was not immediately available. Mr. Previn seemed puzzled that critics continued to mention his Hollywood past long after he had been focusing on classical music. “I haven’t done anything else since the mid-’60s,” he told The Times in 1991. “I think there’s a statute of limitations here. “When I go to Tanglewood to teach, the kids don’t know I ever did anything else,” he continued. “Sometimes they see a movie on the late, late show, and they say, ‘Who is that?’ And then I have to confess that the man who manufactured harp glissandos for Esther Williams to dive to was actually me.” "
5c4e117b3a125f5075c0695b,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/27/arts/music/juilliard-focus-festival-review.html,"Think of the great patrons of music, and some resonant names come to mind: Nikolaus, Prince Esterhazy, for instance, who for three decades employed Joseph Haydn; or Cardinal Pietro Ottoboni, who funded Italian baroque luminaries. But cast around for their successors — the most important commissioners of living composers — and you encounter a string of initials: BBC, WDR, SWR. The fertile generosity of these public broadcasters (the latter two are Westdeutscher Rundfunk and Südwestrundfunk, regional radio entities with headquarters in Cologne and Stuttgart) is the subject of this year’s Focus Festival at the Juilliard School. It opened on Friday with a stimulating concert by the New Juilliard Ensemble in the Peter Jay Sharp Theater in Manhattan. Under the banner “On the Air! A Salute to 75 Years of International Radio Commissioning,” the festival presents five more programs, through Feb. 1, that reveal how much of a lifeline noncommercial radio has become to composers since the end of World War II. The conductor Joel Sachs, who designed the festival and led Friday’s concert, said in a phone interview that a British composer had told him bluntly: “We’d all starve without the BBC.” While the festival draws attention to the wealth of opportunities created by international broadcasters, it also points a finger at the glaring absence of similar initiatives in the United States. “The problem with commercial radio is that it doesn’t want to do anything as esoteric as classical music,” Mr. Sachs said, “let alone commission contemporary music.” Mr. Sachs said that in his research he had learned of a handful of new works commissioned by isolated American broadcasters, including stations in Minnesota and Cincinnati. But these numbers paled next to the statistics he gathered of radio commissions from Europe and Canada in the postwar era. The BBC supplied a list, possibly incomplete, of nearly 1,600 compositions. Radio France listed 2,300 titles. German regional broadcasters were each responsible for hundreds of works. Canadian composers have benefited from the robust support of the CBC, which commissioned some 1,200 pieces. These broadcasters are cultural powerhouses, and not just on the airwaves. Most have their own ensembles, including symphony orchestras and choirs, and run festivals like the Witten Days for New Chamber Music, organized by the WDR, or the Donaueschingen Festival, a storied engine of avant-garde music that is now under the auspices of the SWR. Each summer the BBC Proms whip up public enthusiasm and draw huge crowds with televised concerts that include new commissions. Some countries make a point of targeting their commissioning largess toward their own composers. One example is Finnish Radio, which sees fostering new Finnish music as part of its mission. That’s how a Modernist gem like Jouni Kaipainen’s “Trois Morceaux de l’Aube” came into being. It received a superb performance on Friday by the cellist Sasha Scolnik-Brower and the pianist Michalis Boliakis. A radio commission gave life to this darkly ruminative work, shot through with flashes of rhythmic exuberance, in 1981, when the composer was 25. In Germany, where the postwar occupying powers designed a decentralized broadcasting landscape free of government control, the mission is broader. In a phone interview, Harry Vogt, who has headed the new music program at the WDR for decades, said he sees it as his responsibility “to produce things, far from commercial considerations, that wouldn’t come into being on their own.” The balancing act there lies in staying accountable to the public through programs — “you don’t want to do things that interest nobody,” he said — while granting composers the creative freedom to develop their art away from the pressures of the market. Mr. Vogt said his commissions also extend beyond the concert hall to sound installations in public and industrial spaces in order to reach new listeners. “There is always an educational component, too,” he said, “though you try to avoid it reeking of pedagogy.” Friday’s concert proved that, in casting the net wide, the patronage of the broadcasters reels in works of varying quality. I was underwhelmed by Colin Matthews’s “A Voice to Wake,” with its vocal line that felt somehow both sibylline and mechanical. The Korean-German composer Younghi Pagh-Paan’s “U-MUL (The Well),” commissioned by WDR, relied a little too heavily on watery sound painting. On the other hand, listeners are indebted to Radio France for Akira Nishimura’s beguiling “Corps d’Arc-en-Ciel,” with its brilliant play on density and light. And, in this context, it was instructive to hear Salvatore Sciarrino’s “Archeologia del Telefono,” an instrumental work infused with his trademark fragility, in which brittle sounds hover on the edge of imperceptibility, carrying subtle charges of humor. In concert, Sciarrino’s music fascinates in part because of the odd techniques used to draw sounds from the instrument. I couldn’t help but wonder how a radio listener would interpret the dry flutter produced by a violinist bowing what looked like a Post-it note tacked to her instrument. The esoteric sound world of such works requires an even more intense concentration on the part of the radio listener who, unlike the audience in the room, is literally all ears. "
5c869c2e49f0eacbf105c738,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/11/arts/music/chicago-symphony-orchestra-strike.html,"A new round of labor upheaval hit the classical music world on Sunday night, when the musicians of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, one of the finest ensembles in the nation, went on strike in an effort to preserve their defined-benefit pension plan. The players — who are among the best-paid in the field, earning a minimum annual salary of $159,000 last season, and often more — began walking a picket line outside Orchestra Hall on Monday morning. In recent years, ticket sales have covered an ever-smaller portion of the cost of putting on classical performances. That has put pressure on orchestras to raise more money from donors — but also to try to cut expenses, leading to tensions with their unions. This fall, the Lyric Opera of Chicago’s orchestra went on a brief strike and wound up agreeing to a contract guaranteeing fewer weeks of work. Two seasons ago, the Philadelphia Orchestra, the Pittsburgh Symphony and the Fort Worth Symphony found themselves on strike simultaneously. There are several areas of dispute in the negotiations in Chicago, which have gone on for 11 months without an agreement, but the pension is the main sticking point. The orchestra’s management and board have warned that the growing expense of the current pension plan, which guarantees a set benefit for life after retirement, is unsustainable. They said in a statement that the orchestra contributed $3.8 million into the musicians’ pension fund this year — up from $803,000 just two years ago because of new federal requirements — and that those annual contributions were projected to continue rising sharply. Management’s proposal has called for switching the musicians into a defined-contribution plan, similar to a 401(k), in which the orchestra would put a set amount of money into individual retirement accounts for the players, who could invest it as they chose. Cynthia Yeh, a percussionist on the players’ negotiating committee, said in a statement that the defined-benefit plan “has been the hallmark of the orchestra’s benefits package (and those of other leading orchestras) for over 50 years.” She said the board’s proposal “strips the membership of that guaranteed benefit and shifts the investment risk to the individual member.” Helen Zell, the chairwoman of the orchestra’s board, said in a statement that “it would be irresponsible for the board to continue to authorize a pension program that jeopardizes the orchestra’s future.” While many other industries have shifted to cheaper defined-contribution plans in recent decades, defined-benefit plans remain the norm at the nation’s largest orchestras — and players around the country have made preserving them a priority. But many are underfunded. The American Federation of Musicians and Employers’ Pension Fund, a large multiemployer plan covering thousands of musicians, is currently considered “in critical status,” and if its condition worsens, it could trigger a rare move to cut the benefit payments for those already retired. Last week, as the deadline the Chicago players set for an agreement neared, the orchestra’s eminent music director, Riccardo Muti, wrote a letter supporting the musicians to Ms. Zell and Jeff Alexander, the orchestra’s president. “As music director and a musician of this orchestra, I am with the musicians,” Mr. Muti wrote, urging the management to “remember that theirs is not a job but a mission” and speaking of the performers’ need for “tranquillity and serenity.” Mr. Muti is scheduled to lead the orchestra in a program of Rossini, Vivaldi, Beethoven and Wagner on Thursday. "
5c9abcd649f0eacbf105f356,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/26/arts/music/james-levine-met-defamation-claims.html,"A judge on Tuesday dismissed all but one of the defamation claims that the conductor James Levine made in a lawsuit he filed against the Metropolitan Opera last year after it had fired him amid allegations of sexual misconduct. The ruling came just over a year after the Met fired Mr. Levine, who had been its music director for four decades and who had recently assumed an emeritus position — making him the biggest classical music star to lose his job during the national reckoning over sexual misconduct. Mr. Levine, who has denied any wrongdoing, sued the Met for breach of contract and defamation; the Met countersued him, accusing Mr. Levine of decades of misconduct and saying that he had violated his duties to the company and harmed the institution. After Justice Andrea Masley of the New York State Supreme Court issued a ruling Tuesday dismissing most of Mr. Levine’s defamation claims, but allowing one to proceed, lawyers representing both Mr. Levine and the Met said that they were pleased. One of the dismissed claims centered on statements that Peter Gelb, the Met’s general manager, made after The New York Times and New York Post published articles in 2017 in which several men accused Mr. Levine of abusing them as teenagers or young men. Mr. Gelb told The Times then that the Met was awaiting the outcome of an investigation it had commissioned, and made reference to “a tragedy for anyone whose life has been affected.” He later wrote to the Met’s supporters, calling the period “a sad moment in the company’s history and a tragedy for anyone whose life may have been affected.” Mr. Levine’s lawsuit claimed those statements were defamatory. Justice Masley disagreed, writing: “The reasonable interpretation of those statements by an average reader in the whole context is that, true or false, defendants were sympathetic to anyone negatively affected or harmed in connection with the accusations; that is, the situation was ‘trag[ic]’ whether the accusers were harmed by alleged conduct or Levine and the Met, Levine’s longtime employer, were harmed by false accusations in the press.” She also dismissed the claims that two other statements were defamatory on the grounds that they were made by the Met’s lawyer in response to Mr. Levine’s lawsuit. One centered on the statement by the lawyer, Bettina B. Plevan, that the Met had conducted “an in-depth investigation” of Mr. Levine “that uncovered credible and corroborated evidence of sexual misconduct during his time at the Met, as well as earlier.” The other was her statement that the Met had made Mr. Levine music director emeritus “when it became obvious that Levine was no longer physically capable of carrying out his duties as music director.” (The company had announced the change in his position in 2016, when Mr. Levine was 72 and having complications related to his Parkinson’s disease.) But Justice Masley found that Mr. Levine could proceed with his claim that a March 12 statement the Met made was defamatory, since it preceded the lawsuit. That statement said that the Met had “uncovered credible evidence that Mr. Levine engaged in sexually abusive and harassing conduct.” Mr. Levine’s lawyer, Edward J.M. Little, a partner at Hughes Hubbard & Reed, said he was pleased the judge had kept what he called “Maestro Levine’s strongest defamation claim.” “The Met didn’t just fire him,” Mr. Little said in a statement. “As we have alleged, it defamed him on the way out after his 50 years of brilliant artistic genius that contributed greatly to what the Met became.” The Met’s lawyer, Ms. Plevan, a partner at Proskauer Rose, said in a statement, “The Metropolitan Opera is pleased that the court dismissed virtually all of the defamation claims filed by James Levine against the Met, including the only claim against Peter Gelb.” The rest of Mr. Levine’s suit is proceeding; there is a conference scheduled for next month. "
5caf2ca149f0eacbf1f82c25,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/arts/music/kendrick-lamar-pulitzer-prize-music.html,"A year ago, shock waves rippled through the arts world when the Pulitzer Prize in Music, almost always bestowed on a classical composer, was awarded to Kendrick Lamar’s album “DAMN.” “This is a big moment for hip-hop music and a big moment for the Pulitzers,” Dana Canedy, the prizes’ administrator, said then. “I never thought I’d be a part of it,” Mr. Lamar told Vanity Fair about the prize. “It’s one of those things that should have happened with hip-hop a long time ago.” It was not only the first time the prize had gone to a hip-hop work; never before had it been given to any kind of mainstream popular music. Even as Pulitzer-winning musical styles shifted over the decades, from the Americana of Copland’s “Appalachian Spring” (1945) to the fragmented atonality of Donald Martino’s “Notturno” (1974) to the joyful genre-bending of Caroline Shaw’s “Partita” (2013), the prize has remained almost exclusively the province of classical music. But Mr. Lamar’s Pulitzer upended all that. Was “DAMN.” a fluke, or will the prize — the 2019 winner will be announced on April 15 — genuinely embrace popular music? What now counts as a “distinguished American composition”? The music Pulitzer was established in 1943 as a celebration of homegrown art in the midst of World War II; the first winner was a briskly patriotic cantata by the Neo-Classicist William Schuman. For decades, the prize was mostly given to well-established composers: As Mr. Martino once said, “If you write music long enough, sooner or later someone is going to take pity on you and give you the damn thing.” There was also long a sense that awardees largely came out of the insular academic scene. In a scathing 1991 article, the critic Kyle Gann chastised the Pulitzer as a “reward for conformity and a compensation prize for ineffectuality.” After winning, in 2003, John Adams told The New York Times that, “among musicians that I know, the Pulitzer has over the years lost much of the prestige it still carries in other fields like literature and journalism.” (Mr. Adams, as well as six other Pulitzer-winning composers, declined to be interviewed for this article; Mr. Lamar was unavailable for comment.) Recently the prize has broadened in aesthetic scope and given a career boost to young composers like Ms. Shaw, who was 30 when she won. But until Mr. Lamar, it had still barely budged outside of its old classical music limits. When, in 1965, the music jury attempted to break free of those constraints by requesting a special citation for Duke Ellington, the Pulitzer’s governing board declined the recommendation. The prize has been haunted by that embarrassing episode, only partly rectified by special awards and citations granted posthumously to Ellington and other jazz legends like Scott Joplin and John Coltrane. A turning point came in 1997, when Wynton Marsalis won, the first time the prize recognized jazz. The guidelines subsequently eliminated an original reference to classical forms and, in 2004, dropped a requirement to provide a notated score, allowing for recording-only submissions. There were critics. “I don’t think it’s a good idea at all,” Mr. Martino said of the new openness in 2004. “Let these people win DownBeat polls,” referring to the jazz magazine. (Characteristic of the history of the prize is the contradiction that some of the composers who have complained about its insularity have also vociferously defended its boundaries.) Such changes, though, didn’t overturn the status quo. Since Mr. Marsalis, only two other jazz composers have won: Ornette Coleman and Henry Threadgill. Even Mr. Lamar’s path to victory last year was somewhat unusual: “DAMN.” had not been officially submitted. But during a weekend of deliberations, the five-member music jury weighed the merits of some classical submissions that drew on hip-hop influences, and came to the conclusion that hip-hop itself should be under consideration. The jury introduced “DAMN.” into the process and ultimately decided it was worthy of the prize. “We’re there all day listening, reading, discussing,” one of the 2018 jurors, the jazz violinist Regina Carter, said in a recent interview. “We were all really respectful of one another and listened to each other. There was no fighting going on: We’d argue our cases, but it never got ugly.” Ms. Canedy, who spent much of her career as a reporter and editor at The New York Times, became the Pulitzers’ administrator in 2017. She sees Mr. Lamar’s win as a step toward diversifying the submission pool. “The biggest thing we could have done to send a signal to the music industry that we’re serious about this is to award a Pulitzer to Kendrick Lamar,” she said in a recent interview. “That’s not why we did it; we did it because his work was spectacular. But if it sends a signal to the industry that we really are open to all kinds of amazing music, then that’s a good thing.” But even if SoundCloud rappers and aspiring singer-songwriters start to submit, their work still needs to be evaluated by a jury. Pulitzer juries in the past decade have typically comprised a mix of classical and jazz musicians, critics, academics and arts administrators. Will future juries give adequate attention to nonclassical submissions — or have the knowledge to properly distinguish a work of the caliber of “DAMN.” from other hip-hop entries? “Technically speaking, excellent music is excellent music,” Ms. Canedy said. “So I think if you can judge excellent music, you can do that across genres.” Maybe, or maybe not. Having listened to Mr. Lamar’s music, Steve Reich, who won in 2009, said, “I don’t know enough hip-hop to separate him from other hip-hop artists.” “To make a judgment, you have to make an informed judgment,” Mr. Reich added. “And I don’t have that. Therefore, I wouldn’t be competent to judge him.” The composer Kevin Puts, who won in 2012, said in a recent interview, “I do a lot of judging of competitions for so-called classical music, like orchestra music. I feel I’m qualified to do that. But I wonder, if there were more genres or more styles involved, if I would really be the person to make a good decision.” Ms. Carter expressed confidence in the diversity of the two juries on which she has served. But she also acknowledged that there were potential limitations in the early stages. “If you have jurors and no one is familiar with that genre, then I think it’s not even going to make it into that forward pile,” she said. Excellent music may be excellent music, but not all musicians have equal understanding or even respect for different traditions; consider the many online commenters who dismissed Mr. Lamar’s win, one of whom described the album as “neurologically divergent from music.” The prize, moreover, is not actually decided by the music jurors. The jury is instructed to provide the Pulitzers’ administrative board — which includes journalists, editors and academics, but not professional musicians — with three unranked nominations. The board then decides which of the three receives the award. “We would have been happy with whomever they had chosen to win both times,” Ms. Carter said of her juries, “because all of the composers felt really strong and their works were really intriguing.” Last year’s Pulitzer could well have gone to one of the other, more conventional finalists, the composers Ted Hearne and Michael Gilbertson, rather than Mr. Lamar. And if a future board were to be confronted with, say, an opera by Tania León, an experimental record by Nicole Mitchell, and a visual album by Beyoncé, might its members tend to select the finalist with whom they were already most familiar? “That’s just never happened,” Ms. Canedy said. “Every finalist gets its due when it comes before the board,” she added. “They do what they do, which is download the work, listen to it, debate it, and then make a decision.” It’s not always that simple. The Ellington controversy arose from disagreement between a jury eager to award a jazz master and a board concerned that it was violating the prize’s rules. In 1992, the music jury recommended only a single finalist: a work by the composer Ralph Shapey. The board  demanded that the jury provide a second option and, when a piece by the composer Wayne Peterson was submitted, the board chose the Peterson. Angry jurors then released a statement describing the board’s decision as “especially alarming because it occurred without consultation and without knowledge of either our standards or rationale. Such alterations by a committee without professional musical expertise guarantees, if continued, a lamentable devaluation of this uniquely important award.” And the Pulitzer remains singularly important — which makes its intricate rules and shifts of stylistic emphasis big news in the music world. The 2019 prize may go to a groundbreaking symphony, a confessional folk record or a transcendent mixtape. Speaking in late February, Ms. Canedy said that the music jury — which will remain anonymous until the prize is announced — had selected its three finalists. “We had a diverse slate of entries,” she said. “We have three finalists that we’re incredibly proud of, and would be happy to see any of the three win a Pulitzer.” "
5c75966949f0eacbf105a474,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/26/arts/music/daniel-barenboim-conductor-bullying-berlin.html,"Daniel Barenboim, one of the world’s most celebrated conductors, is known for doing what he wants. He founded an orchestra (the West-Eastern Divan, a youth ensemble of musicians from around the Middle East), a conservatory (the Barenboim-Said Akademie) and a concert hall (the Pierre Boulez Saal). In 2001, he broke a longstanding informal ban in Israel and conducted a piece by Richard Wagner, an anti-Semite beloved of the Nazis. He makes the kind of political statements most musicians avoid. Mr. Barenboim, 76, has long been considered untouchable in Berlin, where he is music director of the Staatsoper — the city’s premier opera house — and principal conductor for life of its orchestra, the Staatskapelle. He is close to city politicians and has used his influence to ensure the opera company receives a healthy annual subsidy of 50.4 million euros ($57.4 million) from Berlin’s government. But cracks have begun to emerge in the conductor’s image as Mr. Barenboim has been accused of bullying and humiliating members of the Staatskapelle. The accusations have been reported widely in German media, and there have been calls for politicians to intervene. A spokesman for Klaus Lederer, Berlin’s highest-ranking official for culture, whose department provides most of the Staatsoper’s funding, said Mr. Lederer has asked the opera company to appoint a third party to look into the matter. “A piece of art might not always be democratic, but a public institution can’t be allowed to transform into a royal court,” said a recent article in the newspaper Der Tagesspiegel. The New York Times has communicated with seven former or current members of the Staatskapelle. All highlighted examples of Mr. Barenboim’s behavior that they said was bullying and went beyond what was normal for a conductor. Mr. Barenboim dismissed the accusations. “I was born in Argentina, so there’s a bit of Latin blood in my body, and I get upset now and then,” he told RBB, a German broadcaster. In an email exchange with The Times, he denied bullying anyone. “Bullying and humiliating someone,” he wrote, “implies the intention of wanting to cause someone hurt, of taking pleasure in it, even. This is not in my character.” Highhanded behavior was common in conductors of the last century, with maestros like Arturo Toscanini and Georg Solti known as harsh taskmasters. (One of Mr. Solti’s nicknames was “The Screaming Skull,” because of his bald head and temper.) But the debate around Mr. Barenboim raises the issue of whether such behavior is still possible. “The issue is not personal, but a question of how orchestras are run in the 21st century,” Martin Reinhardt, a trombonist in the Copenhagen Philharmonic who played in the Staatskapelle and has openly criticized Mr. Barenboim’s behavior, said in a statement. Willi Hilgers, a former timpanist with the Staatskapelle, said in a series of Facebook messages that Mr. Barenboim repeatedly humiliated him in front of colleagues by singling out his playing. As a result, he said, he had suffered “high blood pressure, depression, the feeling that you can no longer play your instrument, sleepless nights, my family had to suffer as well, no performance without beta blockers and antidepressants.” Mr. Barenboim said that the accusations were part of a campaign to stop him from continuing as music director of the Staatsoper. “The fact these allegations have surfaced now, just as I am in negotiations about renewing my contract beyond 2022,” he wrote in the email exchange, “makes me wonder: If people were indeed hurt, as they claim to have been, why speak about it now, at this precise moment?” “I know that in certain tense moments I have used a harsh tone that I regretted,” he added, but that was all. “I am not a shy lamb — but I am not a bully, either.” In a statement, the Staatskapelle’s orchestral board said it had achieved “great artistic successes through mutual trust and close cooperation” with Mr. Barenboim. “This confidence remains untouched,” the statement added. The accusations against Mr. Barenboim first appeared on Feb. 6 in VAN, an online classical music magazine, which interviewed over a dozen current and former employees of the Staatsoper, quoting them anonymously. The article described a leader “who can be inspiring and generous, but also authoritarian, mercurial and frightening.” Mr. Hilgers, 56, said in a Facebook message that his problems with Mr. Barenboim started during the Staatsoper’s 2001-02 season, at a performance of Wagner’s “Götterdämmerung.” During the first intermission, Mr. Hilgers said, he told Mr. Barenboim he had a migraine, warning the conductor in case he lost concentration during the rest of the opera. During the next act, Mr. Barenboim would bang out the rhythm of the timpani’s solos with one hand and a foot, as if instructing a child, Mr. Hilgers said, adding that he felt humiliated. “Afterward, his attacks piled up against me,” Mr. Hilgers said. Mr. Barenboim said in an email, “The timpanist you mention had a beautiful sound and made beautiful colors,” but he had “rhythmic weaknesses, which is very problematic.” Mr. Barenboim added that the pair had “some disagreements,” but that is normal when musicians are trying to get the best results. Leo Siberski, 49, is now the music director of the Plauen-Zwickau Theater in Germany, and played trumpet in the Staatskapelle under Mr. Barenboim from 1992 to 2003. He said he witnessed outbursts from Mr. Barenboim directed at musicians, and started experiencing them himself after asking for a sabbatical in 1996. Mr. Barenboim refused the request, Mr. Siberski said. “He soon found a situation where he could humiliate me, also to make an example of me,” Mr. Siberski said. This behavior largely involved singling Mr. Siberski out, and making him repeat passages in front of the orchestra. Mr. Barenboim said he didn’t remember any request for a sabbatical. He added it was “fair practice to ask musicians in a world-class orchestra to play their lines alone.” Mr. Siberski said he eventually quit as the orchestra’s principal trumpet to “get out of the firing line.” Now a conductor himself, he said he has adopted a different approach with the musicians he works with. “If a responsible artistic director wants to lead his ensemble to new levels of quality, this will always cause some pain,” he said. “But there is a huge abyss between pain like sore muscles, and deep mental wounds caused from attacking your very dignity.” Mr. Barenboim acknowledged that the world is changing. “That is generally a good thing,” he said. But, he added, “an orchestra cannot function if every tempo, every dynamic is put up for a democratic vote. Somebody has to lead, take decisions and be ultimately responsible.” "

Igudesman & Joo, as they call their duo, are trained (and skilled) musicians who imbue classical music with laugh-out-loud humor. But their concert with Ms. Wang was riddled with jokes about her sexual appeal and Chinese heritage that ranged from unpleasant (“God, she’s so hot”) to offensive. (“It smells of sweet and sour chicken,” Mr. Igudesman said of a box with Ms. Wang inside.) In my review, I described some of the jokes and said they were a shame, especially considering that much of the evening was delightful: Ms. Wang was as impressive as ever, and Igudesman & Joo’s music-based comedy was virtuosic. But this performance has come at a fraught moment in culture, in which an increased desire to confront stereotypes is meeting an increased sensitivity about racial characterizations. The Museum of Modern Art is reconsidering the inclusivity of its collection; New York City Ballet has toned down Chinese caricature in “George Balanchine’s The Nutcracker”; the Metropolitan Opera removed blackface from “Otello.” Igudesman & Joo and Ms. Wang responded to interview requests with statements saying that the show’s jokes were intentional, and meant to satirize issues of race and sex in the music industry. “In our view, the best way to tackle tricky subjects is to undermine them by pointing them out with humor,” Igudesman & Joo said through a representative. “Our goal is not to offend but to show the offenses for what they are.” They added that “it was Yuja Wang herself who encouraged us and pushed for this approach.” Ms. Wang, in a separate statement, said, “The amount of vile, sexist, anonymous (or sometimes not, when it’s in print) comments publicly directed at me and so many others — especially aimed at women and minorities — is astonishing.” So, she added, “I have decided to take control of my own narrative, and have some fun while doing it.” To an audience member, this is all understandable, if difficult to accept given how lewd the concert became. The three artists tended to perform in a stereotypical manner without clearly or thoroughly mocking the stereotypes. I kept wondering how the spectacle was playing for the children in the audience, many of whom were Asian-American. The adults, at least, it seemed to polarize. On Twitter, one person posted: “What I saw last night was an audience being pandered to at a cruise ship level, and barely that.” In the comments on my review, someone said, “Some of the jokes were stupid, for sure, but not offensive.” Another wrote, of me, “Doesn’t he mean that HE became uncomfortable?” True — but I’ve heard jokes like these before, and they hurt. Half of my family is Hispanic, and positive representation of people like them is hard to come by in popular culture. Caricature is common; villainy, even more so. Clive Gillinson, Carnegie Hall’s executive and artistic director, was in the audience and said in a statement, “When Carnegie Hall partners with artists, we always seek to provide them with a platform on which they can express themselves, offering opportunities for them to present programs that reflect their own personal artistic viewpoints, and, in this case, also their sense of fun.” The prominent violinist Jennifer Koh wasn’t there, but she is a keen observer of issues of race in the classical field. In an interview, she said that, based on what she had heard about the Carnegie event, she was reminded of a concept addressed by the scholar Grace Wang. “Oftentimes, we’ll hear things like ‘German sounds’ and ‘French verbs’ and ‘Russian passion.’ Those are positive,” Ms. Koh said. “But ‘Chinese pianist’ — a lot of people have very negative connotations. And then there is this idea that Asians are robots. They have technique, but they don’t have soul.” Indeed, the title of Ms. Wang’s program with Igudesman & Joo was “The Clone,” taken from the duo’s 2017 YouTube sketch. But the show at Carnegie was less about satirizing this stereotype, and more about demonstrating it: The sketch’s conceit is a showcase of all the capabilities of a hypothetical Yuja Wang clone. (Or robot? It’s never really clear.) The clone-robot shows off her technical capabilities while Igudesman & Joo talk about her as if she were a high-tech sex toy. The concept, whatever its good intentions, tempts comparisons with the history of African-American performers in blackface, acting out stereotypes of themselves for predominantly white audiences. It also risks feeding the common perception of Asian-Americans as perpetual foreigners, Ms. Koh said, and as not having the musical depth of Caucasian Westerners — and therefore not having the full entitlement to interpret the Western canon. “These kinds of statements are not dissimilar to the Charlottesville marches — ‘blood and soil,’” she said, referring to the Nazi slogan appropriated by white nationalists at a 2017 rally in Virginia. “These are not unrelated issues.” Ms. Koh has tried in some small way to address problems with Asian-American representation in classical music. With the composer Jean-Baptiste Barrière, she is currently at work on “The 38th Parallel,” a multimedia piece in part about displacement, immigration and her family’s history as refugees of the Korean War. (It will have its premiere next year in California.) I attended a workshop performance at the New School in January; in its current form, the work is meditative yet direct, informative without being didactic. And it fits what Ms. Koh described as her dream of seeing Asian-Americans represented through “actual stories that are real and don’t have this foreign gaze.” This isn’t to say Ms. Wang has to use her Perspectives series for a program about moving to the United States from China. But she is a celebrity in classical music, and Igudesman & Joo have tens of millions of views on their YouTube channel. Think of what they could do — and what they haven’t done — with such a high profile. "
5c8938b049f0eacbf105cddb,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/13/arts/music/review-beatrice-rana-piano-carnegie-hall.html,"Chopin’s études for piano — 24 works, in two volumes — are study pieces written to develop specific aspects of technique. If you can play them comfortably, you can probably play anything written for the piano. He tried to make these études imaginative, as well, and the best performances convey their musical riches. In that regard, Beatrice Rana set a new standard for me in her New York recital debut on Tuesday at Zankel Hall. Playing the 12 études of Book Two (Op. 25), she didn’t just surmount the technical challenges; she made the pieces sound as poetic and colorful as anything Chopin ever wrote. Though Ms. Rana is just 26, this debut was still overdue. She has appeared for years at major halls and with leading orchestras in Europe, and has made acclaimed recordings on the Warner Classics label. In June, she will appear in Carnegie’s main hall as the soloist with the Philadelphia Orchestra in Prokofiev’s Third Piano Concerto, one of her signature works. From the opening moments of the first étude, in A flat, Ms. Rana had the audience rapt. The piece explores rippling arpeggio chords in both hands, through which a soft-spoken melodic line is heard, traced by the top note in the right hand. Ms. Rana made these awkward figurations come across delicately; the melodic line had the grace of the bel canto opera arias Chopin adored. Ms. Rana boldly used rubato, the stretching of the line to lend it breadth and expressivity. This can easily be overdone and result in affected, distorted music-making. I tend to prefer Chopin played with a little less rubato than Ms. Rana opted for. But her phrasing was so sensitive to the shape of the line and shifts of harmony that she won me over, as she did with her use of the sustaining pedal to create milky textures. Her playing was refined and soft-spoken in its brilliance throughout. But in the Étude in A minor (“Winter Wind”), Ms. Rana showed her demonic side. As a stern theme is played in the left hand, the right hand has descending and ascending cascades of tangled passagework. Ms. Rana’s fearless playing was an exhilarating rush of speed and color. After intermission she turned to Ravel’s piercingly poetic and very difficult “Miroirs” suite, playing with lushness one moment and striking crispness and clarity the next. She ended with Guido Agosti’s 1928 arrangement of the final three sections from Stravinsky’s “The Firebird.” The Infernal Dance sounded nearly unplayable. But Ms. Rana proved that it could indeed be conquered. "
5c8818e649f0eacbf105cb4a,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/12/obituaries/jacques-loussier-dies.html,"Jacques Loussier, a French pianist who led a trio that performed jazzy interpretations of Johann Sebastian Bach, selling millions of albums and touring the world, died on March 5 at a hospital in Blois, in France’s Loire Valley. He was 84. His death was confirmed by his daughter, Hélène Loussier Oziouls Toulouse. His son Julien said the cause was complications of a degenerative disease. Mr. Loussier was classically trained, but he had dabbled in jazz improvisation for years when he formed the Jacques Loussier Trio in 1959. The other members were the drummer Christian Garros, who had played with Django Reinhardt, and the bassist Pierre Michelot, who had recorded with Miles Davis. The trio played recognizable Bach melodies or pieces, like “Air on a G String” and the Prelude No. 1 in C, then took flight into bebop improvisations. They quickly found a devoted audience and released a popular series of albums on Decca under the overall title “Play Bach” beginning in the early 1960s. Many critics bridled at the idea of jazzing up the work of Bach. John Rockwell of The New York Times, reviewing a performance at Carnegie Hall in 1975, wrote that he was “actively appalled by the very notion of ‘popularizing’ Bach — or any classical composer, for that matter.” “Mostly,” Mr. Rockwell continued, the trio “stuck too close to Bach for jazz and too close to cocktail/salon jazz for satisfaction.” In 2002, Mr. Loussier told the British newspaper The Independent  that such criticism did not bother him. “Bach himself,” he noted, “was improvising on these pieces for many years.” Other critics were more positive about Mr. Loussier’s playful style, including Robert Sherman, who reviewed another Carnegie Hall performance by the trio in The Times in 1966. “Mr. Loussier is a man with a fertile imagination, excellent musical instincts (given the basic premise of his transcriptions) and a powerhouse technique,” Mr. Sherman wrote. “The snippets he played ‘straight,’ or reasonably so, showed flair and intelligence, and even when poor old Bach was left far behind, Mr. Loussier’s volatile pianism was never less than compelling.” The Jacques Loussier Trio broke up in the late 1970s, and Mr. Loussier went on to compose original works, including music for French films and television. In 1985, the 300th anniversary of Bach’s birth, Mr. Loussier rebuilt the trio with André Arpino on percussion and Vincent Charbonnier on bass. The new trio embraced other composers in its jazz adaptations, including Satie, Debussy,  Ravel, Vivaldi and Beethoven, and released more albums. His last new release, on the Telarc label, was a version of Schumann’s “Kinderszenen,” in 2011. Mr. Loussier was born on Oct. 26, 1934, in Angers, in western France, to René Loussier, who worked in a bank, and Marguerite (Duvat) Loussier, a homemaker. He started playing the piano at 10, and later said that his distinctive approach to Bach developed while he practiced the Prelude in G Minor. “I played it 100 times or so,” he said. “Then one day I started to change the melody, then the left-hand harmonies. It was a natural instinct.” He studied for a time at the National Conservatory of Paris. “My fellow students would always ask me to play some Bach with my improvisations,” he said. “At that time, the Modern Jazz Quartet was doing this thing already: I heard them, and that gave me the idea to transform it with bass and drums.” In 1959, the year the Jacques Loussier Trio released its first album, he married Sylvie de Tournemire. Their marriage ended in divorce. In 1998 he married Elizabeth Note. In addition to his wife, with whom he lived in Cour-sur-Loire, France, and his son and daughter, Mr. Loussier is survived by three other sons, Thomas, Jean-Baptiste and Pierre; 13 grandchildren; and one great-grandson. In a case that brought Mr. Loussier renewed attention, he sued Eminem and Dr. Dre for $10 million in 2002, charging that they had used his music without credit. He asserted that “Kill You,” the first song on Eminem’s album “The Marshall Mathers LP” (2000), was suspiciously similar to one of his compositions, “Pulsion.” Mr. Loussier said that he thought Eminem or Dr. Dre, who produced most of “The Marshall Mathers LP,” had heard a snippet of “Pulsion” that he had played on one of his Bach recordings and “thought it was Bach’s music, not mine.” “So they used it without asking permission,” he continued. “If they had come to me, I would have accepted, and allowed them to use it for nothing, but they didn’t, which is not nice.” The case was settled out of court.

5cb4a2f149f0eacbf1f84366,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/15/arts/music/jack-quartet-elliott-carter-review.html,"It feels a little cruel to be reporting how good the JACK Quartet’s concert on Sunday afternoon was. After all, it won’t be repeated any time soon, at least not in New York. And few people saw it; the Morgan Library & Museum’s Gilder Lehrman Hall was far from full. But JACK’s performance, a head-spinning marathon of Elliott Carter’s five string quartets, two and a half hours of notoriously thorny music, was one of the most eye-opening and exhilarating concerts I’ve heard all season. The fearless JACK players — Christopher Otto and Austin Wulliman, violins; John Pickford Richards, viola; and Jay Campbell, cello — will continue to offer Carter à la carte. And, in an email, they said a recording of the full set is on the way. But rarely are these works presented together, live. (Die-hard fans on Sunday reminisced about hearing the Pacifica Quartet do all five; that was over a decade ago.) The marathon approach isn’t simply a flex of endurance and technique, though JACK was virtually infallible on both counts. It’s also a window into how Carter’s attitude about the nature of quartets evolved through his lifetime. And what a lifetime: The year he was born, 1908, Mahler’s Seventh Symphony had its premiere; the year he died, 2012, brought Caroline Shaw’s “Partita.” Theodore Roosevelt was his first president; Barack Obama, his last. He finished his final work just months before his death, at 103. The string quartets date from 1950 to ’95. On Sunday, JACK didn’t present them in chronological order — which doesn’t really matter. If Carter’s output has a through line of progress, it’s a fuzzy one. He was more interested in novelty; he once said that every piece he wrote was “a kind of crisis in my life.” Each of his quartets is a singular interrogation of the form. The Fifth (1995) is where the Morgan program began. This deeply human piece — made all the more so by JACK’s interpretation, which teased out the expressiveness that critics have sometimes said Carter’s music lacks — is like a love letter to the art of chamber music. With hazy harmonics, crunchy rolled chords and metallic plucks, the series of short movements and interludes conjures rehearsal conversations in which someone offers an idea or a demonstration of how a passage should be played, and the rest respond. The final measure, a violinist’s harmonious double stop, suggests eventual agreement. Next was the Pulitzer Prize-winning Quartet No. 2 (1959), in which each player is given an individual strand of melodies, harmonic intervals and rhythms that develops throughout the 22-minute work. Imagine “Twitter: The Quartet,” with each voice brazenly independent, stubbornly struggling to be heard above the fray. It’s impressive that the JACK musicians, with conflicting characters to portray, remained so tightly together; it’s miraculous that they did so while barely signaling to one another with eye contact or gestures. (Then again, this is an ensemble that specializes in performing Georg Friedrich Haas’s music in total darkness.) I’m surprised the Second Quartet wasn’t immediately followed by the Fourth (1986), which feels like a sequel — but a utopian one, in which the players decide on a compromise between individuality and the common good. At 45 minutes, Carter’s rhapsodic Quartet No. 1 (1950-51) is the longest of the bunch, a cri de coeur of a composer breaking free from what he, in his writings, described as “my professional and social responsibility to write interesting, direct, easily understood music.” But, for all its intellectual rigor, this work has heart hiding under the surface. And humor, as when vibrato-rich sostenuto in the violins is interrupted by a belching low note from the cello. The Third Quartet (1971), which also won the Pulitzer, calls for dividing the ensemble into two duos, facing one another. On one side were Mr. Otto and Mr. Campbell, with a rubato attitude as they navigated the progress of four distinct musical characters; on the other, Mr. Wulliman and Mr. Richards, their rhythm more regular, offering six contrasting characters. It’s a lot to take in for an audience. Just imagine what it’s like for the players. These Carter works are brutal tests of an ensemble’s skill and stamina. On Sunday, the JACK passed. Times five. "
5cb0b3d249f0eacbf1f83649,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/12/arts/music/american-composers-orchestra-review.html,"In 2015, Khaled Jarrar, a Palestinian artist and filmmaker living in Ramallah, read an ad in a local newspaper. It was an appeal for assistance placed by a refugee from the war in Syria who was stuck with her family in Istanbul — including the writer’s elderly mother, who was a refugee for the second time, having been forced to leave Nazareth for Syria during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. Moved by the story, Mr. Jarrar spent 31 days traveling with the family to Germany, living as a refugee and filming the journey. This experience inspired “Where We Lost Our Shadows,” a multimedia work for orchestra, video and three soloists that Mr. Jarrar created with the composer Du Yun. The American Composers Orchestra, which commissioned it with Carnegie Hall, played the premiere on Thursday at Zankel Hall. Ms. Du and Mr. Jarrar decided to broaden the work’s focus to encompass timeless themes of human migration, exodus and refugee flights. Ms. Du, who won the Pulitzer Prize in Music for her 2016 opera “Angel’s Bone,” an allegory of human trafficking, turned to the heritage of ragas, a structure for melodic improvisation that itself migrated over centuries throughout Arab, Central Asian and Indo-Pakistani regions. Working with the Pakistani vocalist Ali Sethi, she chose ragas dealing with themes of water, rain and thunder; these raga-inspired passages were sung by Mr. Sethi on Thursday with both rawness and plaintive delicacy. These elements are integrated into a score that shifts and heaves, qualities captured in the restless performance led by George Manahan. There are stretches of misty orchestral sonorities in which fidgety figurations get batted around over dense harmonies. Shayna Dunkelman, a dynamic percussionist, drove episodes of the piece with pummeling drum bursts one moment, tingling effects the next. The vocalist Helga Davis brought radiance to Ms. Du’s tender, high-pitched setting of the Palestinian poet Ghassan Zaqtan’s “Pillow.” In the accompanying film, we see images of a family traveling at nighttime on stony paths; women in hijab emerging from shelter underground; and endearing short scenes of children trying to be hopeful as they talk of heading to Germany or Sweden. But overall the footage is murky, atmospheric, even abstract — which actually enhances its power. The program opened with an intensely focused performance of Morton Feldman’s “Turfan Fragments” (1980), inspired by knotted carpets discovered on an archaeological expedition in East Turkestan. They struck Feldman as a metaphor for his music, which tends to unfold in subdued bits and chunks — wheezing sonorities, pungent cluster chords, repetitive figures — that only suggest a larger structure. Mr. Manahan also led a vibrant account of Gloria Coates’s Symphony No. 1, “Music for Open Strings” (1974), a work that uses some unusual tunings and the notes of a Chinese scale in a compact four movements. The music abounds in swaying riffs, bare melodic ideas, dramatic glissandos and stretches of perky, twanging energy. "
5ca7278449f0eacbf1f811d6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/05/arts/music/george-walker-sinfonia-visions-seattle-symphony.html,"SEATTLE — Last fall, the Smithsonian’s National Portrait Gallery began to display, among its recent acquisitions, a photograph of the composer George Walker. It shows him close up, his right index finger and thumb bearing down on a pencil with the precision of a surgeon, at work on the manuscript score of his Sinfonia No. 5. The image of Dr. Walker, who died last summer at the age of 96, was captured by the photographer and filmmaker Frank Schramm, a close friend. They had known each other since Mr. Schramm heard a broadcast of Dr. Walker’s Sinfonia No. 3 in 2004 and, he said, “immediately gravitated to his work.” Living within a couple of miles of Dr. Walker in New Jersey, Mr. Schramm would pay regular visits to his house in Montclair — helping out with errands and at the same time using his camera to document his life and work, right up to the end. “George was 81 when I met him, so there was already a sense of time running out,” Mr. Schramm said. “But he was so focused. We would listen to and discuss music. It became like an unsolicited master class for me.” Just two months before his death, Dr. Walker had been keenly anticipating the opportunity to experience Sinfonia No. 5, “Visions,” in a concert hall, Mr. Schramm recalled. He was looking forward to the first live performance, which will be given by the Seattle Symphony Orchestra on April 11. (A studio recording, made in 2017, is available on Albany Records.) The piece, which was completed in 2016, in part conveys Mr. Walker’s response to the 2015 shooting at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C. “He looked back and saw the other work he had done and thought this could be the last one,” said Gregory Walker, the older of Dr. Walker’s two sons. “And he felt an urgency about getting it out there.” “Visions” crowns a long career in which Dr. Walker produced more than 90 compositions, including intimate pieces for solo piano (his primary instrument), and large-scale orchestral and choral works. It was the last score he completed; at the time of his death, he had embarked on a piece commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Amid impassioned debates about the canon and its exclusion of historically marginalized voices, his remarkably individual and intricately crafted musical voice is long overdue for discovery. “George was very proficient,” Mr. Schramm said. “His house became his think-tank, with his work at the center. He knew what he had.” But it was frustrating, he added, for Dr. Walker to repeatedly face difficulty in getting orchestras to program his work. A longtime passionate advocate has been Peter Kermani, a former chairman of what is now the League of American Orchestras and the founder of Albany Records. In the mid-1980s, when he first encountered Dr. Walker’s music, he was attracted to “the lack of sweetness and treacle that a lot of American works had.” “Right from the beginning, that was a distinguishing feature of George’s music,” Mr. Kermani added. “I think he was breaking new ground. I felt he should be given every opportunity on the planet to get his music performed and heard.” The Seattle Symphony’s performance may signal the beginning of a fresh wave of interest. In 2016, Mr. Schramm recalled, Dr. Walker was encouraged by a meeting with the conductor Simon Rattle, who expressed interest in performing his music in Europe. Dr. Walker’s early “Lyric for Strings” became his first piece to be programmed at the BBC Proms when the Chineke! Orchestra performed it shortly after his death last year. During the past two decades, Mr. Kermani has released a multivolume series of Dr. Walker’s orchestral works on the Albany label, along with albums documenting the composer’s earlier career as a concert pianist. He introduced Dr. Walker to the English-born conductor and pianist Ian Hobson, a specialist in mid-20th-century American orchestral music who had made numerous recordings with the Sinfonia Varsovia of Poland. Mr. Hobson described Dr. Walker as “a composer of great integrity: uncompromising in the best sense of the word, who doesn’t pander to anything.” While still trying to place “Visions” with an orchestra, Dr. Walker arranged to have it recorded by Mr. Hobson and the Varsovia Symphony — the final installment of Mr. Hobson’s cycle of his Sinfonias, each of which is a compact, single-movement composition. (“Visions,” with a duration of about 18 minutes, is the longest of them.) “Visions” Mr. Hobson said, is “complex and built of small cells of harmonic patterns and melodic groupings,” adding that “sometimes the detail is knotty and gnarly — and deliberately so — and sometimes unexpected beauties emerge from his extremely sensitive ear for color.” Dr. Walker’s son Gregory — a teacher at the University of Colorado, Boulder, and a former concertmaster of the Boulder Philharmonic Orchestra — said that the piece, which includes spoken text, is striking for the new ground it breaks in orchestral writing. “He wasn’t worried about whether it would be comprehensible immediately,” Gregory Walker said. “It’s an idealistic vision of what this combination of music and text and imagery could achieve.” George Walker was born in 1922, into an arts-loving family in Washington. His father, an immigrant from Jamaica, ran a medical practice from their home and organized his own research groups with colleagues. (At the time, the American Medical Association didn’t grant membership to black doctors.) His mother, a singer, encouraged his precocious talent for music with piano lessons — and did the same for his younger sister, Frances Walker-Slocum, who became the first black woman granted tenure at Oberlin College. Dr. Walker started attending Oberlin at 14, focusing on piano and organ before beginning graduate studies at the Curtis Institute of Music. He envisioned a career as a concert pianist and made his debut in 1945 at Town Hall in New York, as the first black instrumental soloist there. A few weeks later, he achieved the same milestone with the Philadelphia Orchestra as the soloist in Rachmaninoff’s Third Piano Concerto. Despite critical acclaim, Dr. Walker was able to secure only a fraction of the number of engagements that came readily to his white peers. He turned instead to an academic career, while at the same time channeling his creative drive into composition. To improve his keyboard skills at Curtis, he undertook composition studies. (The title of his memoir, “Reminiscences of an American Composer and Pianist,” reflects how fundamental both identities remained for him.) Dr. Walker studied with the storied mentor Rosario Scalero, who also taught Samuel Barber, and spent a period in Paris with Nadia Boulanger. She encouraged him, and with a new focus on composition, he cultivated a distinctively laconic style purged of excess and meticulously designed from meaningful gestures. In 1996, Dr. Walker won the Pulitzer Prize for “Lilacs,” a commission from the Boston Symphony Orchestra that set portions of Walt Whitman’s Lincoln elegy “When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom’d.” But the recognition that came with that and other honors did not erase his experience of struggling to get his music heard by the public. Responding to The New York Times about the Pulitzer news, Dr. Walker revealed the boldly self-reliant attitude he had used to cope with the constant institutional roadblock of racism: “I strongly felt if I continued to press for what I hoped to achieve, I would achieve it.” Being the first black composer to win the music Pulitzer became something of a double-edged sword. Invariably, like a Homeric epithet, it has become the phrase regularly used to introduce him as a composer. “He has been advertised as this African-American statesman who is supposed to be representing all the potential that has been neglected in the black community,” Gregory Walker said, “yet doesn’t follow the trends or fit cleanly into any category of contemporary music.” George Walker’s guiding philosophy, his son added, was that everyone is an individual, and his music was “proof of how individual things can be.” “He saw himself as an extension of great artists of the past, using their compositional techniques, idioms, instruments and aesthetics — and his love of Beethoven and Romantic-era composers,” Gregory Walker said. “He transformed all of that into something that was himself.” Not a programmatic composer by inclination, George Walker began work on “Visions” before the Charleston massacre occurred. But, when he learned what had happened, he became determined to introduce a layer that pays tribute to the victims. Brief, elliptical texts he wrote are assigned to five solo speakers; even though they are not sung parts, the score specifies their approximate ranges (a soprano, a tenor, two baritones and a bass). Along with these textual elements, the music includes several brief — and, in typical fashion, rather hidden — quotations from famous songs like “Drink to Me Only With Thine Eyes” and “I Dream of Jeannie,” as well as the hymn “Rock of Ages” and the spiritual “Swing Low, Sweet Chariot”). The texts are elusive, acquiring disquieting ambiguity when juxtaposed with a video that Mr. Schramm created at Dr. Walker’s request. The video, which begins about midway through “Visions,” contains images of ocean scenes filmed on the Atlantic Coast along with close-ups of photographs documenting the slave trade in Charleston. “It emphasizes the mystery that this was the same ocean that brought the slaves over,” Mr. Schramm said, “and of the past, present and future of the water, which is very dark.” During what turned out to be Dr. Walker’s final year, Elena Dubinets, the vice president of artistic planning and creative projects at the Seattle Symphony, came across interviews in which he had discussed “Visions.” When arrangements for the premiere elsewhere fell through, she expressed interest in having it in Seattle. She found a place for the piece on a program with Dvorak’s “New World” Symphony, conducted by the orchestra’s new music director, Thomas Dausgaard. “We wanted to juxtapose two very different views on our country,” Ms. Dubinets said, “a romanticized European perspective on the American culture combining different worlds into a new one that suited Euro-American colonizers, and an internal perspective coming from an African-American composer terrified by the shocking massacre in Charleston more than 120 years later.” "
5caa2bc949f0eacbf1f81736,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/07/arts/music/budapest-orchestra-review.html,"The aesthetic commitment being offered was never in doubt. By programming two full nights of Bartok at Carnegie Hall, the touring Budapest Festival Orchestra and its music director, Ivan Fischer, were signaling their passion for a Hungarian modernist whose works they have memorably recorded. The question was whether some of Bartok’s celebrated touchstones — the Concerto for Orchestra, the “Miraculous Mandarin” suite and a concert performance of the one-act opera “Bluebeard’s Castle” — would stand noticeably apart from the comparative rarities on each bill. On Friday, that sometimes seemed to be the case, to the rarities’ advantage. The “Mandarin” had its requisite, slashing severity, though occasionally a bit too much (as when the heroically riffing trombones ran riot over the other sections). By the end of the concert, there was an ideal sense of balance, during the Concerto for Orchestra. Here the strings were allowed more space to delight in complex blends of textures, made of strands both sinewy and silken. Yet what stood out most was an informational (though not didactic) tour through several of the composer’s works for student singers and orchestral players. In brief remarks from the stage, Mr. Fischer observed that Bartok was a dedicated educator. So, too, was Mr. Fischer. By allowing Cantemus Choir — a girls’ ensemble from the Zoltan Kodaly Primary School — significant time on the Carnegie stage, the conductor helped emphasize Bartok’s ability to merge charming, youthful motifs with the occasional dollop of more complex harmony. (This was particularly true of the selections with orchestral accompaniment.) Mr. Fischer cracked a joke about his cohorts pretending to be a “student orchestra,” though there was nothing apprentice about their engagement. Nor any sense that the players’ talents were being wasted on this thoughtfully constructed music. Saturday’s concert had a similarly instructive angle, this time focused on Bartok’s appetite for folk music. In that night’s commentary, Mr. Fischer described the composer’s ethnomusicological practice of recording authentic performances of local songs, then invited a trio from the orchestra to the front of the stage. The bassist, violist and violinist first played a series of traditional Romanian dances “as Bartok may have heard them” (in Mr. Fischer’s formulation). When one of the jubilant traditional melodies was taken up by the full orchestra, signaling the beginning of Bartok’s “Romanian Folk Dances,” the crowd cut short its enthusiastic applause for the trio to pay attention to the brief but potent Bartokian adaptation for orchestra. (A similar spell was cast, later on, when the same trio accompanied the contemporary Hungarian vocalist Marta Sebestyen, in a series of pieces that preceded the orchestra’s tour through Bartok’s “Hungarian Peasant Songs.”) The “Bluebeard’s Castle” that followed might have felt anticlimactic, after those revels. But the performance was, for me, the highlight of the weekend. This take breathed fresh life into a work that, in recent years, has perhaps been familiar to New York audiences through Mariusz Trelinski’s Metropolitan Opera production. In its high-tech yet one-note grimness, the Met’s presentation can feel like a slog. This concert performance was more dramatically varied — with the mezzo-soprano Ildiko Komlosi’s Judith seeming possessed of some persuasive (if fatally misguided) romantic hopes. And the orchestral playing was as exciting here as at any point during Budapest’s Carnegie stand. Mr. Fischer steered toward each new horror with an ingenuity capable of conjuring all the narrative’s gothic scenery — no strobing, blood-red light shows necessary. "
5cab82f249f0eacbf1f81a42,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/08/arts/music/pollini-pohjonen-carnegie-review.html,"In October 2004, two days after the master pianist Maurizio Pollini gave a recital at Carnegie Hall, Juho Pohjonen, a 23-year-old from Finland, made his American debut upstairs at Carnegie’s Weill Recital Hall. At the time, the two were far apart in their careers: one an eminence, playing Chopin and Debussy with his characteristic cool brilliance and probing musicianship, the other a boyish newcomer. Yet back then Mr. Pohjonen already had formidable technique and an exploratory streak. After winning accounts of works by Mozart, Schumann, Scriabin and Bartok, he ended that recital with fearless performances of two stunningly difficult pieces by Esa-Pekka Salonen: “Yta II” and “Dichotomie,” a wildly exuberant 17-minute piece that begins like some fractured avant-garde version of Stravinsky’s “Petrushka.” Fifteen years later, the two pianists happened to return to New York two days apart. On Friday, Mr. Pohjonen gave an hourlong recital for an audience of about 100 in the intimate Buttenwieser Hall at the 92nd Street Y, again ending with Mr. Salonen’s “Dichotomie.” And on Sunday, Mr. Pollini returned to a packed Carnegie Hall for a splendid recital of works by Brahms, Schumann and Chopin. These seemingly different pianists had more in common than you might assume: An eager musician of around 40 can also be a master of his craft; a towering artist, at 77, can still be an adventurer. Mr. Pollini certainly took risks in the days when he championed thorny modernist works by Boulez and Nono. In recitals at Carnegie, he would play selections from Stockhausen’s monumental “Klavierstücke” series alongside Beethoven’s “Hammerklavier” Sonata and “Diabelli” Variations to make the point that both composers were visionaries pushing toward new realms of the piano. In recent years Mr. Pollini, who has grappled with periods of illness, has been hewing mostly to standard repertory, as he did on Sunday. Still, his searching performance of Schumann’s seldom-heard Sonata No. 3 in F minor suggested why this work has the subtitle “Concerto Without Orchestra.” The first movement begins with a dark, majestic theme that immediately breaks into swirling turbulence. But Mr. Pollini sensitively drew out the plaintive melodic lines that penetrate the tangles of passagework and counterpoint. He managed to reconcile Schumann’s extremes, especially in the teeming finale, in which the music’s fixation on dotted-note rhythms seems at cross purposes with its dancing energy. Since that long-ago debut at Weill, Mr. Pohjonen has won a following in New York for his regular performances with the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center. On Friday, he gave an elegant account of Rameau’s Suite No. 2 in G, and conveyed the episodic fervor of Scriabin’s single-movement Sonata No. 8. He again conquered Mr. Salonen’s “Dichotomie.” The second part of the piece unfolds in passages of oscillating chords and pummeling repeated figures, until the music bursts into a long episode of sweeping glissandos, through which thematic lines and pungent chords must break through. As he did 15 years ago to ease the execution (and protect the fingers of his right hand), Mr. Pohjonen managed to quickly slip on a thin glove to dispatch the glissandos, then deftly slipped it off — a neat trick. But, more than in 2004, he had the piece sounding alluring, with watery runs and milky colors amid bouts of pummeling chords. It no longer seemed nearly impossible. You might say he played it like a master. "
5ca3a89e49f0eacbf1f803bf,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/02/arts/music/kings-college-choir-review.html,"The roster of the Choir of King’s College, Cambridge, inevitably keeps changing as the boys who fill it enter adolescence and move on. But for 37 years, the organist and conductor Stephen Cleobury has provided stability as its director of music, leading the ensemble that perhaps best represents the great English choral tradition. On Monday Mr. Cleobury, who will retire from his post this summer, led the choir in a magnificent concert at St. Thomas Church Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, his last performance in America at the head of a storied ensemble that dates to 1441. Over the years he has brought the group regularly to St. Thomas, and the church was packed for this farewell. The boys of King’s College arrived, though, as the choir’s traditions have been questioned. Last December, Lesley Garrett, a British soprano, wrote an article calling the boys-only lineup an anachronism that was unfair to girls. The idea that boy treble voices have special purity is “just nonsense,” Ms. Garrett wrote. [Read more about the debate over boy choirs.] Her broadside sparked an international debate over the singing opportunities presented to girls and the aesthetics of the choral tradition. Do boys sing with a distinctively ethereal sound? It was hard not to conclude so listening to the remarkable King’s College Choir on Monday. And though the focused, shimmering sound of the choir’s collected voices — which includes older boys singing alto, tenor and bass parts — was splendid, the treble voices were especially wondrous. In works like Monteverdi’s “Cantate Domino” and Tallis’s “Videte Miraculum,” the trebles penetrated the choral textures even during passages when the basses and tenors were singing with youthful fervor. The sound these youngest boys make comes across as utterly natural yet somehow transient, a haunting falsetto. Yet the quality of this choir may result not just from the innate character of boys’ voices but also from the approach to vocal training and music-making the ensemble has preserved. That British approach has sometimes been criticized as too polite and reserved. But on this night, Mr. Cleobury coaxed singing of great vigor, color and character from the choristers. I was impressed by the attention to text. In William Byrd’s “Laudibus in Sanctis,” a setting of Psalm 150, when the Latin words call for praising the greatness of God in anthems and song, the choristers made every word crisp and clear and sent the phrase soaring. The choir sounded equally confident in 20th-century pieces by Britten (the dramatic antiphon “Praised Be the God of Love”) and Vaughan Williams (the mysterious “Valiant-for-Truth,” a setting of a text from “Pilgrim’s Progress”). St. Thomas Church maintains its own renowned Choir of Men and Boys. And its director of music, Daniel Hyde, will be Mr. Cleobury’s successor in Cambridge. Mr. Hyde once worked under Mr. Cleobury as an organ scholar at King’s College. So the tradition continues, even as the debate goes on. "
5c9e6c8e49f0eacbf106a260,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/29/arts/music/bach-st-matthew-passion-review.html,"The director Peter Sellars believes that Bach wrote his “St. Matthew Passion” not as a concert work or theater piece but as a “transformative ritual reaching across time and space.” That’s the way he presented it in a revelatory performance with Simon Rattle and the Berlin Philharmonic at the Park Avenue Armory in 2014. The orchestra and chorus, each divided into two groups, as Bach stipulated, here became like combating forces in a searing story of faith and doubt, trust and betrayal, community and mob chaos. Of course, the “St. Matthew Passion,” which tells of Christ’s last days on earth, is a church piece, a sacred oratorio. But how would Bach have presented it at the church where he worked in Leipzig? An affecting answer was suggested on Thursday at St. Peter’s Episcopal Church in Chelsea when Tenet Vocal Artists and the early-music ensemble the Sebastians, who have a string of remarkable collaborations to their credit, performed this masterpiece. It’s likely, many scholars believe, that under Bach the choruses would have been performed with one singer per part. These singers would have also shared the solo arias and even taken the crucial roles of the Evangelist and Jesus. In its intimacy and directness, this beautifully small-scale performance by Tenet and the Sebastians was just as shattering as the Berlin Philharmonic’s near-operatic approach. In the somber, steady opening piece, the choristers of one group beseech the daughters of Zion to join the lament. “Behold!” they sing. “Whom?, the others ask. The “Bridegroom!” the first group explains. Here, the music was performed by just eight singers, four in each chorus, standing in front of the pews, one group to the left, the other to the right. In other performances of the passion, you can be swept along by the choral majesty of Bach’s music. In this one, you heard the individual lines — and the individual qualities of the voices — with striking clarity. So, the desperate pleas and the confused responses came through like personal utterances. It was almost uncomfortable to watch as these singers took small roles one moment then sang an aria the next, as when the strong bass Sumner Thompson transformed from Judas, betraying Jesus with a kiss, into a penitent singing a sublime aria asking to have his Jesus back. The other bass, Charles Wesley Evans, brought tenderness to an aria affirming that it will be easier to take on the cross in his life because Jesus had first done so. Yet, before long, Mr. Evans became Peter, the frightened disciple who denied Jesus three times. The radiant-voiced Jolle Greenleaf, the artistic director of Tenet, shared soprano arias with the elegant Laura Heimes. The countertenor Doug Dodson and the mezzo-soprano Virginia Warnken Kelsey shared the alto arias. Jason McStoots and Gene Stenger were the impressive tenors. Tyler Duncan’s naturally burly baritone made him an almost fearsome Jesus. So it was wrenching when this Jesus showed poignant vulnerability in accepting his fate. As the Evangelist, the tenor Aaron Sheehan balanced grace and urgency in relating this oft-told story. The Sebastians ensemble (Jeffrey Grossman, music director) gave a performance of uncommon naturalness and transparency. Mr. Grossman, much as Bach would have, played the organ continuo part while offering just occasional cues. "
5c65d6353a125f5075c09c6e,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/arts/children-and-the-arts-conversation.html,"On a recent evening, three arts writers spoke about the joys and terrors of introducing their children to the profusion of New York City culture. Corinna da Fonseca-Wollheim is a classical music critic with three children, ages 15, 13 and 9; Daniel McDermon is a fine arts writer with three children, 7, 6 and 3; and Alexis Soloski is a theater critic with two children, 5 and 2. In a lively chat with no meltdowns — though occasional breaks for tooth brushing and bedtime kisses — they discussed choral music, Broadway babies and the dangers of taking a toddler to the Brooklyn Museum. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. ALEXIS SOLOSKI When we bravely leave the tablets behind and take the kids out into the cultural world, what do we do to make this a happier and less stressful experience? CORINNA da FONSECA-WOLLHEIM A really good question to ask yourself as you begin to take children to cultural events: Is it for education or entertainment? Is it to share something that’s precious to you with them? I think much of the stress that comes with these situations arises out of the fact that our egos have a big fat stake in how they turn out. DANIEL McDERMON I have wrestled a lot with the education vs. entertainment problem, in part because I keep insisting to myself (and my kids) that they are capable of appreciating things that just require more patience than they have. Like Buster Keaton movies. SOLOSKI I want them to love what I love, though I’ve gradually — and I hope not too grudgingly — acknowledged that they have their own tastes and desires. Which is how the 5-year-old and I ended up at “Frozen.” FONSECA-WOLLHEIM That’s also how I ended up more of an expert on the use of musical genres in the “Backyardigans” as opposed to them being well-versed in Mozart. A big difference to my own childhood is streaming. Like it or not, we live in an age in which it is easy to consume only what you already know and like. McDERMON It is also easier than ever for them to serve themselves with what they like, which means my YouTube recommendations are a disaster. McDERMON Our greatest successes owe a lot to some preliminary conversations, doing some reading together, and — maybe most important — snacks. I got my oldest, then 4, pretty excited to see “Picasso: Sculpture” at MoMA, and he liked it enough that I brought him back with the younger two so he could “share” it with them. FONSECA-WOLLHEIM My kids loved that Picasso show, too, and the current Andy Warhol retrospective at the Whitney Museum of American Art was a hit with all three. Perhaps the biggest difference between visual art and a live performance of music or theater is that you can take no shortcuts. I actually don’t make it my special mission to get my children to love classical music — any live event is a wonderful antidote to that insulating power of the screens. But since I am here to talk about classical music and kids, it’s worth saying up front: The music requires the communal silence of an attentive audience. And, unfortunately, that silence wants to be so total that a parent’s favorite tools — snacks and coloring books — won’t cut it. I once took my then 7-year-old daughter to a matinee of religious choral music — contemporary music inspired by the wounds of Christ. O.K., I couldn’t find a babysitter, and I was reviewing! She sat there dutifully clutching her coloring book, but the scratch-scratch of her pens was too loud. And it was dark. She ended up sitting in the lobby of the Kaufman Center for the rest of the concert. SOLOSKI I’ve had the occasional misfire, too. The first time I took my daughter to the Big Apple Circus, she became so fixated on the possibility of a pony ride that nothing — not tightrope walking, not clowns, not my frantic shushing — could distract her. McDERMON Like a lot of new parents, I tried too hard, too early, with my first kid. He loved long walks in the stroller, so I thought, why not walk him through the Brooklyn Museum? We made it about five minutes into a Mickalene Thomas show before he started fussing, then whining, then full-out wailing as I rushed out. SOLOSKI I take my kids to the theater pretty often, maybe every month or two, sometimes when I’m working and sometimes for what I will tentatively call fun. I try to find things I think all of us will like, but I don’t always guess right. And I don’t mind indulging them, cost permitting.  McDERMON My aim is twofold. I want them to be regulars in the city’s great cultural institutions, so they’ll feel at home, not intimidated. And then there are the sort of cultural totems that I feel obliged to share with them, like that Picasso show, or Giacometti at the Guggenheim, where a part of me is hoping to implant a kind of “aha” moment that they might be able to recall years from now. One plan that touches on both aims is that every winter for the last few years I have wondered whether I could finally inaugurate a holiday tradition of “The Nutcracker” or the Met’s kid-friendly version of “The Magic Flute.” And every year I think, maybe next year. I find Film Forum intimidating enough. FONSECA-WOLLHEIM First of all, adults may think of opera as an advanced form of classical music — that strange style of singing! The length! The plots! — but it has one huge advantage over instrumental concerts when it comes to kids: visual interest. The Met’s family-oriented productions around Christmas are excellent places to start. They are shortened, and in English, and the house will be full of kids. My own three liked “The Magic Flute” well enough when I first took them, and laughed in all the right places. But what really stuck with me from that performance was the sound of a young girl, somewhere above us, sobbing inconsolably at a quiet moment deep into the Masonic part of the opera where the character Pamina is heartbroken. Children get emotions. I’ll give you one more anecdote. I took my son, then 10 or 11, to see a double bill of short operas at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. There was Mark Morris’s witty take on Purcell’s “Dido and Aeneas,” which I knew contained a really great witch, and then this incredibly austere and esoteric Noh-inspired opera by Britten, “Curlew River.” It was that opera that left him spellbound, at the edge of his seat. You never know what they’ll respond to. McDERMON That kind of deep response is what I am hoping for when we try something that may be a bit beyond their reach. I spent at least 10 minutes with my son in front of Jackson Pollock’s “Autumn Rhythm (Number 30),” trying in a hushed, -nonobnoxious voice to talk him through the depths and dimension of it. It wasn’t enough to persuade him it was great, but I like to claim a minor victory in that we spent that much time looking. FONSECA-WOLLHEIM I try to impress upon them the need to keep questions until afterward, to clap when others are clapping, and to even be mindful of the noise of turning pages or unwrapping sweets. But I’ve come up with a kind of “rule-of-four” to maintain my own sanity. Certain actions — snuggling up to a parent, say, or even a muffled cough or a whisper — may distract the attention of the four audience members immediately surrounding you. But they don’t even register a few rows behind. Also, I should say that organizations like the New York Philharmonic put on wonderful concerts targeted at kids that don’t require these acrobatics. I’m talking more about how to prepare older kids for the mainstream concert situation. McDERMON We do talk about the rules of cultural spaces, though I try not to incite rebellion by shouting “no touching.” But the biggest factor for me has been taking just one kid at a time, so the two of us can have an ongoing conversation about what we see. SOLOSKI I’ve definitely whisper-shouted “No touching!” At the theater, I can be a bit of an etiquette monster. I try to comfort myself with the thought that the whole concept of a quiet and dutiful audience is a bourgeois 19th-century invention. But I don’t want it to be my kid having the meltdown. Still, I wish more shows understood that kids are kids, and they may not be thrilled to sit quietly for an hour and change, especially the littler ones. Most children are haptic learners, so I find the shows that have allowed them to move around and to join in the experience engage them best.  FONSECA-WOLLHEIM Summer festivals are the best for families. Anything outdoors — whether it’s the Naumburg Bandshell in Central Park or Tanglewood in Lenox, Mass. — allows kids to experience classical music while literally being able to turn cartwheels. If you want to expose your kids to the funkier varieties of contemporary music — wonderfully amplified, often — the Bang on a Can Marathon is a great place to start. And I recently discovered a sweet chamber music series at SubCulture, called GatherNYC, that runs one-hour shows on Sunday mornings complete with breakfast pastries and coffee. There were some very young children there who really took to it. McDERMON The Bang on a Can Marathon was my son’s first concert. (Though we only lasted for one performer.) And I agree that being outdoors is a huge help. Storm King Art Center in New Windsor, N.Y., or the Socrates Sculpture Park in Long Island City, Queens, can be fantastic with kids, and I think the scale of outdoor or public sculpture helps them recognize the way that art stands apart from the everyday.  SOLOSKI I’m really in love with the New Victory Theater’s model, which has art projects and activities for children before and after. And the shows are short! In recent years a lot of places have upped their game and are finding really innovative ways to delight children without boring parents: Lincoln Center Kids, BAM Kids, the French Institute: Alliance Française.  FONSECA-WOLLHEIM Lincoln Center offers free short performances by top artists in the Rubenstein Atrium (on the first Saturday of each month), which can be a great first taste. The outdoor events in Central Park are free. And recently I dipped into a lovely tradition that has been going on at St. Paul’s Chapel downtown for years: a half-hour program of choral Vespers by candlelight with the stellar Choir of Trinity Wall Street on Sunday evening. Everyone gets to hold a candle, which can be surprisingly hypnotic for a kid! McDERMON The best value in the fine art world is New York’s galleries, which are full of world-class work and completely free, if you exclude the cost of the occasional unwelcoming glance. With a kid who has any interest and a modicum of self-control, I think touring Chelsea or uptown gallery districts is a blast. But dragging a toddler or a group of kids is a bad idea. SOLOSKI Most Broadway shows now have lotteries and once a year, they offer a deal where a child can attend for free if an adult buys a full-price ticket. The next one is Feb. 26. And a lot of theaters will offer discounts to groups or offers for school groups, provided your children’s teachers are amenable. FONSECA-WOLLHEIM I think the single best piece of advice I can give is to do as Daniel suggested and bring only one child at a time. My most stressful memories revolve around efforts to bring kids of very different ages — and their interpersonal dynamics — into the same cultural space. My second piece of advice — harking back to our beginning — is to exercise patience and take our own ego out of it. None of my three children grew to love classical music the way I did, and I’m sometimes sad about that, just as I regret not passing on to them fluency in my mother tongue, German. But time works its own magic. My 15-year-old sat rapt through a Philharmonic concert and “Adriana Lecouvreur” at the Met Opera over the holidays just because a friend from camp who was into classical music was visiting. And my son is now clamoring for piano lessons and YouTubing Chopin preludes because of a Japanese anime movie. So peers and, yes, Netflix, can sometimes succeed where you (think you) fail. McDERMON New York is rich with magical spaces, and the rooms and buildings themselves can be enchanting. The grand sculpture galleries inside the Metropolitan Museum of Art overflow with monumental works, and that overwhelming feeling has really seized my kids’ attention when we visit. In a place like that, they get to choose what’s interesting to them, and we can spend time together discussing it. SOLOSKI I’d look for works and spaces that give children a chance to contribute to the experience, and that meet children where they are, without talking up or down to them. And snacks. I can’t overemphasize snacks. FONSECA-WOLLHEIM That’s why my kids will tell you that their favorite venue to be dragged to is (Le) Poisson Rouge, which has a photo booth and a menu including tater tots and warm chocolate chip cookies. They also love how naughty it feels to go to a “nightclub” — even if it’s Bach on the program. We’ve compiled a guide with over 25 events that will help you navigate the city’s cultural landscape over the next few weeks, including the New York International Children’s Film Festival, Very Young People’s Concerts at the New York Philharmonic and the permanent exhibition “Ocean Wonders: Sharks!” at the New York Aquarium. (There’s also the weekly kids listings.) "
5c6f1e1a3a125f5075c0ae32,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/arts/music/boston-symphony-elizabeth-rowe-settlement.html,"Elizabeth Rowe, the principal flutist of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, has settled her pay discrimination lawsuit against the ensemble, bringing to an end a case that sparked international conversation about gender bias in classical music. In her suit, filed last July, Ms. Rowe claimed that her compensation was only about 75 percent that of her closest comparable colleague, the orchestra’s principal oboist, who is a man. It was one of the first complaints filed under a new law in Massachusetts that requires equal pay for “comparable work.” Ms. Rowe, who joined the orchestra in 2004, had sought more than $200,000 in unpaid wages. The amount of the settlement, which was reached on Feb. 14, was not disclosed. In a joint statement both parties said they were “satisfied with the result,” which included a pledge that the orchestra would “continue to collaborate with musicians, staff and other leaders in the field to accelerate the process of achieving gender parity.” The statement also paid tribute to Doriot Anthony Dwyer, a former principal flutist for the orchestra and “trailblazer” who joined the Boston Symphony in 1952, the same year that it became the first American orchestra, according to the statement, to use blind auditions, in which players are hidden behind a screen. Ms. Dwyer, now 96, was one of the first woman to hold a principal chair in a major orchestra — “a suitable achievement for a musician who traces her genealogy (and middle name) back to the suffragist Susan B. Anthony,” The New York Times wrote in 1982. Ms. Rowe and the orchestra pledged to build on the spirit behind practices like blind auditions, which have helped markedly increase the percentage of women in orchestras. “In the same spirit of improvement and innovation it demonstrated more than six decades ago, the orchestra will continue to collaborate with musicians, staff, and other leaders in the field to accelerate the process of achieving gender parity,” the statement said. “The B.S.O. and Elizabeth Rowe look forward to continuing their shared commitment to artistic excellence at the highest level.” "
5c93fb8349f0eacbf105e5a1,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/21/arts/music/review-boston-symphony-orchestra-carnegie-hall.html,"Many composers also perform on an instrument and conduct. But, in two recent concerts at Carnegie Hall, Thomas Adès took this to another level, demonstrating yet again his extraordinary skill as an all-around musician. Last week at Carnegie’s Zankel Hall, he more than held his own as a pianist alongside the virtuoso Kirill Gerstein in a demanding program of works for two pianos. And on Wednesday, on Carnegie’s main stage, Mr. Adès led the Boston Symphony Orchestra in the New York premiere of his new Concerto for Piano and Orchestra — written for Mr. Gerstein, who exhilaratingly dispatched this joyous and audacious piece’s formidable solo part. [Read our review of the concerto’s premiere in Boston.] To end that program, the second of two Boston Symphony concerts at Carnegie this week, Mr. Adès conducted Tchaikovsky’s Fourth Symphony. It makes sense that a composer leading this staple would bring heightened insights into how the music goes, and how the details add up to the whole. Composers wrestle with these issues in their own scores all the time. Mr. Adès brought so much more. He drew colorful and lucid playing from the orchestra, even when taking risks and driving climaxes to extremes; the players seemed willing to go along for the trip. In its day, Tchaikovsky’s symphony was a cutting-edge, contemporary work. And that’s how Mr. Adès made it sound on Wednesday night. The brass fanfare (the “fate” motif) that opens the first movement was lean, mean and loud. Yet the mood changed entirely during the sighing, restless main theme, played with yearning. There was nothing smooth, sleek or familiar about this interpretation. During episodes of development, Mr. Adès emphasized the tangled complexity of crisscrossing lines. During the slow movement, which has a wistful theme like a Russian folk song, Mr. Adès drew rich, deep tones from the strings. Yet he also teased out intricacies you seldom notice in other performances of this symphony, even if this meant the overall arc of the music lost some continuity. The scherzo, with its pizzicato strings, was crisp and playful, made intriguing by a hint of obsession. Mr. Adès and the players went all out during the frenetic finale. And why not? Perhaps I was primed to detect fresh wildness in the Tchaikovsky; I had just heard Mr. Adès’s concerto right before. Knowing that Mr. Gerstein also plays jazz piano, Mr. Adès plays to that style in this work. From the start of the bustling first movement, with a theme that seems to nod to the jerky rhythms and rising melody of “I Got Rhythm,” there are echoes of Gershwin, the jazz-inspired Ravel and more. This breathless, 20-minute concerto, structured in three essentially traditional movements (fast, slow, fast), comes across as zesty and accessible. But don’t be fooled. Just below the surface, the music sizzles with modernist harmonies, fractured phrases, gaggles of counterpoint and lyrical strands that keep breaking into skittish bits. The finale is a riotous, clattering, assaultive romp. I can’t wait to hear it again. [Read more about how the concerto was written.] The Boston Symphony’s concert on Tuesday was led by the orchestra’s music director, Andris Nelsons. It was an all-Richard Strauss program highlighted by the star soprano Renée Fleming singing a concert version of the closing scene from his final opera, “Capriccio,” which she triumphed in at the Metropolitan Opera in 2011. This scene’s radiant, gorgeous soliloquy — in which Countess Madeleine mulls which suitor, a poet or a composer, to favor, and in the process debates whether poetry or music is the greater art — was made to order for Ms. Fleming’s plush, lyrical voice. She sounded wonderful. Then she paid tribute to André Previn, who died recently, by singing a deeply expressive account of final aria from the opera he wrote for her, “A Streetcar Named Desire.” Mr. Nelsons also led a pulsing, dramatic account of “Also Sprach Zarathustra,” though I found some of the playing rough and jittery. During this performance, as on other occasions, Mr. Nelsons seemed to be physically uncomfortable, sometimes propping himself up by placing his left hand on the rail around the conductor’s podium. But that doesn’t mean the orchestra isn’t thriving under his leadership. The Boston Symphony recently picked up yet another Grammy Award for its series of Shostakovich recordings. And the latest installment — featuring the composer’s Sixth and Seventh Symphonies — was just released. "
5c892d5b49f0eacbf105cd92,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/13/arts/music/review-anne-sophie-mutter-andre-previn-carnegie.html,"Ghosts were always going to be part of the star violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter’s recital at Carnegie Hall this week. The advertised program featured Mozart, as well as the spirit of that composer as it flickers through later French music. And the concert was also to include Sebastian Currier’s new “Ghost Trio,” which riffs on themes of influence and musical forebears. But when Ms. Mutter and her longtime chamber music partner, the pianist Lambert Orkis, took to the stage at Carnegie Hall on Tuesday, the specter most strongly felt was that of André Previn, the conductor, composer and musical polymath. Ms. Mutter and Mr. Previn were once married, and remained close friends and artistic collaborators until his death on Feb. 28. And so, at the end of an evening of brilliant and often uncannily delicate music-making, Ms. Mutter played two Previn works as encores. She dedicated them to him — “wherever he is now,” she said with a spiraling gesture taking in the air around and above her. [Hear the many facets of Mr. Previn, a musical polymath.] Ms. Mutter has built her career on a rich, glossy tone and glamorous stage presence. She is one of the few violinists who can pull off solo recitals in Carnegie’s big hall. On this occasion, she used her magnetism to draw listeners into a world of sounds that included pallid, watery tones a mere whisper away from silence. Most surprising, perhaps, she used these spectral colors in the opening work, Mozart’s Violin Sonata in E minor (K. 304), where the opening theme took on brittle weariness. In the second movement, she rendered one ostensibly sunny theme with such spidery lightness that the consolation it offered came across as a mere mirage. In Debussy’s Violin Sonata, such disembodied sounds are written into the score by a composer who plays on fluctuations of heat and density. In this elegant and sensuous music, Ms. Mutter showed off her trademark rich tone and flamboyant expressiveness. A second Mozart sonata, in B flat (K. 454), became a vehicle for spirited and flirtatious playing, as did the debonair and witty Violin Sonata of Poulenc. Both works trick the listener with wait-for-it endings. After more than 25 years playing together, Ms. Mutter and Mr. Orkis have their comic timing down pat. Humor, alienation and hallucinatory echoes of past music come together in Mr. Currier’s “Ghost Trio.” In nine succinct movements, with titles like “Remote,” “Mysterious” and “Forceful,” this work weaves glancing — and distorted — references to piano trios by Beethoven, Mendelssohn and others into his own intricate, emotionally focused language. In duet with Ms. Mutter, Mr. Orkis’s playing is unfailingly attentive. Here his technical brilliance came to the forefront while Daniel Müller-Schott’s buttery cello added depth and contour. Mr. Müller-Schott also joined for the first encore, a movement from Mr. Previn’s Piano Trio No. 1, which had its premiere (with Ms. Mutter and, on piano, Mr. Previn himself) 10 years ago at Carnegie. The movement, “Spirited,” maintains a sybaritic optimism even through emotional U-turns. A touching rendition of “Song” from “Tango Song and Dance” (1997) followed. Written for Ms. Mutter, she played this effusively melodic music with a sweet, sometimes tremulous tone that felt unaffected and personal. "

You get an offer to run one of the most vibrant performing arts organizations on the West Coast. Jeremy Geffen, who has been an important tastemaker in New York during his dozen years on the artistic planning team at Carnegie Hall, is leaving to become the executive and artistic director of Cal Performances, the arts producer and presenter at the University of California, Berkeley. “What appeals to me about Cal Performances is that it’s the intersection of many strands of music, dance and drama, with the intellectual curiosity of one of the world’s top university environments,” Mr. Geffen, 44, said in a telephone interview about his new post, which was announced on Tuesday afternoon. He will start in Berkeley on April 1. The West Coast is increasingly the center of American musical experimentation, with the Los Angeles Philharmonic the most adventurous symphonic ensemble in the country and the San Francisco Symphony having recently named the composer and conductor Esa-Pekka Salonen its next music director. Cal Performances has long been an important music presenter; this season’s lineup includes the cellist Yo-Yo Ma; Daniel Barenboim conducting the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra; and the mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato. But it also features dance companies, including the Mark Morris Dance Group and Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater; theater troupes from around the world; and the creation of new work. One of its most ambitious offerings this season will be “Dreamers,” an oratorio it commissioned about the lives of young, undocumented immigrants by the composer Jimmy López and the playwright Nilo Cruz. Mr. Salonen will conduct the Philharmonia Orchestra and the soprano Ana María Martínez in the premiere on March 17. [Read about how the election of Donald Trump changed the tone of the piece.] Mr. Geffen has taken a leading role in Carnegie’s artistic planning, including its annual citywide festivals in recent years, and its fostering of new work, including its 125 Commissions Project in celebration of the hall’s 125th anniversary. He said that he looked forward to collaborations at Cal Performances that would tap the expertise and energy of the Berkeley campus. “If there is any type of experience that has been meaningful to me, it’s identifying either uncelebrated or unknown talents — whether that’s compositional or performing — and giving them a platform,” he said. “Because almost every time, they have knocked the ball out of the park.” Clive Gillinson, Carnegie Hall’s executive and artistic director, said Mr. Geffen would be missed for his deep knowledge and prodigious memory. “There comes a time in everybody’s life when they want more responsibilities, broader responsibilities, and to run an institution themselves,” he said in a telephone interview. In Berkeley, Mr. Geffen succeeds Matías Tarnopolsky, who left last summer to lead the Philadelphia Orchestra. It will be a return to the West Coast for Mr. Geffen, who was born in South Africa and raised in Orange County, Calif., where he first developed his interest in music. “I would not have been in music at all had not been for being in the public school system, and we had an instrumental music program at my junior high school and high school and that’s where I got my training,” he said, adding, “I want to share those experiences, I want to share those opportunities.” "
5c8a929849f0eacbf105d158,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/14/arts/music/new-york-philharmonic-mozart-requiem-review.html,"If you want to see how an orchestra can give a fresh polish to dusty old Mozart, head to Lincoln Center. There you’ll find a surprisingly novel Mozart program — played by the New York Philharmonic on Wednesday night under Manfred Honeck and continuing through Tuesday — that, like a fugue, tells a story of the composer’s final year while mapping a journey of death and transcendence. Unlike Schubert, whose later works have an autumnal mood colored by sickness and melancholy, Mozart didn’t begin the year 1791 knowing that, months after his 35th birthday, he would fall ill and die soon after, on Dec. 5. So you would be hard-pressed to find a sense of farewell in his music from that time. In fact, for most of the year Mozart was as stylistically nimble and prolific as ever. He presented the premieres of not one, but two operas, “La Clemenza di Tito” and “Die Zauberflöte.” And, in what would be his final public appearance as a pianist, he gave the first performance of his Piano Concerto No. 27 in B flat, which the Philharmonic opened its program with on Wednesday, featuring Richard Goode. This gently dignified piece, with childlike simplicity and few extremes, all but dares its soloist to achieve majesty at a whisper, to only suggest virtuosity. Mr. Goode, an elder statesman of Mozart’s music, was calmly authoritative, gliding through quick runs and playing with restrained lyricism. Even his galloping rhythms had an unpretentious lightness, more like a pony than a Clydesdale. He didn’t perform an encore, which only heightened the contrast between the rosy concerto, a triumph of early 1791, and what followed after intermission: the Requiem, left unfinished at Mozart’s death. Mr. Honeck, who as the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra’s music director has repeatedly found original ways to present the Requiem there, opted this week for a programmatic medley: “Masonic Funeral Music,” the Requiem and “Ave Verum Corpus,” played without pause for a loose narrative about, as one of the texts says, “a foretaste of heaven in death’s agony.” “Masonic Funeral Music” is the program’s exception, the one work not from 1791. (It was written in 1785.) But listen closely and you’ll hear eerie similarities with the Requiem. Like that piece, its orchestration calls for basset horns and leans heavily on the lower strings, setting a richly somber tone that conjures an organ-like timbre. Mozart never meant for it to be an overture for the Requiem, but on Wednesday the juxtaposition was seamless. And this move — adding a prologue to the Requiem, with an epilogue on the way — was hardly as unusual as Mr. Honeck’s presentation of the Requiem itself. After Mozart’s death, the work was completed by his pupil Franz Xaver Süssmayr, whose edition was long the standard for orchestras around the world. The problem often is that it’s all too easy to tell where Mozart’s sophistication ends and Süssmayr’s well-intended inferiority begins. Mr. Honeck’s solution is to cut the final sections and present the Requiem as Mozart left it — almost. His version begins with the seven completed sections, followed by the Lacrimosa and Offertorium composed by Mozart but finished by Süssmayr. Then it ends with the Lacrimosa — though now as only Mozart’s fragment, the last eight measures of music he ever wrote. Further complicating things, Mr. Honeck, according to the Philharmonic, also has his own changes to the Süssmayr orchestrations. I may be overstating this Requiem’s complexity. In the concert hall, it was natural and succinct, never losing steam as the work often does. And the Westminster Symphonic Choir was stirring in the choral passages, with stabbing staccatos in the Dies Irae and glorious radiance in the Rex Tremendae. The four soloists each had distinctive qualities — standouts were the tenor Ben Bliss, who brought the dramatic textures you might hear in his Mozart over at the Metropolitan Opera, and Megan Mikailovna Samarin, making her Philharmonic debut with a penetrating mezzo-soprano — yet they blended with impressive grace. Mr. Honeck could have let the concert evaporate into mysterious quiet with the Lacrimosa; but, by ending with “Ave Verum Corpus,” the famously spiritual conductor seemed to be making a statement. If the Requiem is a plea for eternal rest, then this brief work, played on Wednesday with a soft glow, promises that and more: serene transcendence. "
5cb0abd149f0eacbf1f83628,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/12/arts/music/new-york-philharmonic-mahler-review.html,"Mahler’s Sixth Symphony is difficult for conductors even on their best days. So you can imagine the pressure on Simone Young, who, after not appearing with the New York Philharmonic since 1998, stepped in on short notice to replace the orchestra’s injured music director, Jaap van Zweden, on Thursday evening at David Geffen Hall. (The maestro will be fine but was ordered to rest after burning his shoulder with an ice pack last week.) Thursday’s imperfect but respectable concert, which featured only the 90-minute symphony, would have been opportunity to hear how Mr. van Zweden, still at the start of his directorship, is shaping the Philharmonic’s Mahler sound, typically a specialty of this orchestra. Instead, the evening ended up being a preview of Ms. Young’s scheduled return next season, when she will lead a program of Britten, Elgar and her Australian compatriot Brett Dean. Mahler, however, might be the better composer to hear Ms. Young conduct, given what she is known for in her long-established career at opera houses and concert halls abroad. She is leading Wagner at the Bavarian State Opera next month, with Strauss coming soon after in Zurich. Her discography includes a lot of Bruckner and, yes, Mahler. It may be that Ms. Young’s opera work informed her approach to the Sixth Symphony, which on Thursday was worthy of its onetime subtitle, “Tragic.” Dealing in shocking extremes — sometimes within a measure or even within a single beat — she exploited the work’s dramatic threads: the opening’s journey from a minor-key march to a major-key victory, followed by inner movements both demented and pastoral and, in the 30-minute finale, a struggle that ends in defeat. Is this a symphony with a narrative program, per se? Not explicitly, unlike Mahler’s earlier ones. But the Sixth is so fraught with historical and interpretive inconsistency that a persuasive conductor could make a case either way. Conductors must also come to the symphony ready to take a stance on the problems that have surrounded it since its premiere in 1906, many created by Mahler’s wife, Alma, whose apocryphal tales set serious scholarship back decades. Is that second theme in the opening movement really a portrait of Alma? Is the hero of the finale Mahler himself, felled by three fateful hammer blows? (Or is it two?) Of the inner movements, which comes first, the Scherzo or the Andante? Does it even matter? It did matter on Thursday. Kind of. The Philharmonic opted for the Scherzo first, which in the context of Ms. Young’s interpretation made the joyous ending of the first movement all the more pathetic by plunging immediately back into a minor key. Saving the Andante for later, however, did leave the symphony sagging after about 45 minutes. This section seemed the least rehearsed, with a wobbly start and an unusually cold distance that never warmed. It may improve by Saturday’s concert, along with sound imbalances in the brasses and, in the balcony, cowbells that were more distractingly present than pleasantly distant. The Philharmonic players did regroup for a calamitous finale; each strike of the hammer was a heart-stopping jolt. When the third blow lands — and yes, there were three on Thursday — the symphony takes a woeful turn. You could read this as a hero’s tragedy, or as a metaphor for Mahler’s life. But don’t for a moment see it as representative of Ms. Young’s conducting, which, against the odds, was valiant to the end. "
5c9e5f2e49f0eacbf105fcd4,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/29/arts/music/tyshawn-sorey-review.html,"Tyshawn Sorey, the composer and multi-instrumentalist, identified one goal of his artistic practice while onstage Thursday night at the Miller Theater at Columbia University. Specifically, he said, he has been working toward a “model of music that perpetuates itself.” That might sound like a conceptual-art statement. But the more you explore the wide-ranging impulses and examples that spur him on, the more it seems concrete. Famously uninterested in genre labels, as well as supposedly hard-and-fast distinctions between improvisation and composition, Mr. Sorey has established momentum in different lanes that are often thought of as mutually exclusive. His long-running trio can be heard in intimate jazz clubs like the Village Vanguard. Meantime, an imaginative, dramatic piece inspired by Josephine Baker (written for the soprano Julia Bullock) can hold down and electrify vaster environs, like the grand staircase of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Miller Theater sits somewhere in between, in terms of both its programming and its size. And so it made sense for Mr. Sorey’s concert Thursday — the latest in the Composer Portraits series — to present a range of hues from his creative spectra. The concert’s first hour was tight and focused. When playing the concert’s opening work, “In Memoriam Muhal Richard Abrams,” the violinist Jennifer Curtis and the keyboardist Cory Smythe (heard here on celesta) gave a sense of Mr. Sorey’s artistry when working with meditative sparseness. In this mode, the composer’s changes can come slowly — as with the steady movement from a parched, dry violin tone to something more conventionally lovely — yet their culmination often ends up feeling voluptuous. That result is from the variety of effects being presented, as well as the time lavished on each one. Mr. Sorey tends to reward a listener’s patience, over the course of a set, thanks to starkly contrasting energies. In “Ornations,” the flutist Claire Chase and the clarinetist Joshua Rubin presented the hyperkinetic side of the composer’s style. At some points solo riffs were passed back and forth between the players like friendly provocations. Even better were the urgent passages during which both players seemed taxed to their individual limits, while still needing to listen closely to one another to create a well-blended sense of chaos. The final opus in this opening set was the New York premiere of “Everything Changes, Nothing Changes,” played by the JACK Quartet. Aptly titled, it seemed both static and constantly in motion. In recalling the more delicate textures heard at the concert’s opening, this piece for string quartet also brought a sense of closure to the first hour. The music after intermission (and after an onstage Q. and A. between Mr. Sorey and Ms. Chase) was dominated by the world premiere of “Autoschediasms,” a work for creative chamber orchestra. Premised on his personal approach to “spontaneous composition,” Mr. Sorey described the work as being created by all the musicians onstage and himself. (He conducted the players and provided instructional prompts via a small dry-erase board.) The lengthy piece was not without interest. There were too many fascinating artists for that to be the case. But for me, this performance did not consistently channel the purposeful quality of Mr. Sorey’s other efforts. When Mr. Sorey and Ms. Chase reunited to close the concert with “Bertha’s Lair,” it was another reminder of the high bar that he sets for himself and his collaborators. Though I’d heard (and enjoyed) this flute-and-percussion piece quite recently, at the Kitchen, it was exciting to encounter it again — given that both performers are invested in the concept of improvisational openness. This time it featured some more guttural exhalations from Ms. Chase. And her brooding work on contrabass flute wound up serving as a setup for one booming, climactic pulse from Mr. Sorey, working in this moment as drummer and dramatist both. "
5c74445e49f0eacbf105a132,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/25/obituaries/dominick-argento-dead.html,"Dominick Argento, a Pulitzer Prize-winning composer who wrote dramatically and stylistically eclectic operas in a mostly conservative idiom that was embraced by audiences but not always by critics, died on Wednesday at his home in Minneapolis. He was 91. His death was announced by his publisher Boosey & Hawkes. Mr. Argento won acclaim for orchestra works, chamber pieces and incidental music for plays, but he was best known for his 12 operas, several of which have entered the repertory. His success came during decades when many composers found it challenging to reconcile contemporary musical languages with the dramatic imperatives of opera. Mr. Argento had no timidity on that account. He said he was driven by a simple credo: “My interest is people,” Mr. Argento told Minnesota Public Radio in 2002. “I am committed to working with characters, feelings, and emotions.” Still, he took chances and sometimes employed unconventional approaches in getting at the core of a story. “When I set down to work on an opera,” he said in a 1979 interview with The New York Times, “the style, form and structure arise out of the subject matter.” For “Postcard From Morocco” (1971), probably his most popular work, an absurdist saga in which a disparate group of people appear to be stranded at a railway station waiting for a train, Mr. Argento’s model was Mozart’s “The Magic Flute” — that “wonderful hodgepodge of styles,” as he described it. For “Morocco” he composed a shifting score that matched the surrealist, multileveled nature of the story (with a libretto by John Donahue), mixing ragtime, blues, American musical comedy, pastiche and even elements of more “serious,” as he put, contemporary compositional techniques. The impulse behind a starkly different opera, “The Voyage of Edgar Allan Poe” (1976), was Verdi’s “Don Carlo,” Mr. Argento said. “I was looking for an equivalent dark, rich subject with similar deep personalities and complex character relationships,” he said. With a libretto by Charles M. Nolte, the opera presents Poe on a nightmarish journey of self-discovery in his feverish final days. Mr. Argento shrugged off a criticism that he heard regularly: that his music was conservative. He could counter by pointing to the consistent praise he earned for the technical skill and inventiveness of his music. But he was not interested in innovation for its own sake. He worked best by sticking to his instincts. “Perhaps this makes me a traditionalist,” he said in the 1979 interview. “Actually, I’m not sure that the advance in opera today has to be made through a more complex — avant-garde, if you will — musical language. We’ve tried that.” In 1958, on three days’ notice, Mr. Argento went to Minneapolis to accept a job at the University of Minnesota music department. Never intending to stay, he lived out of a suitcase for three years. But the move proved auspicious when it dawned on him, as he explained in the 2002 radio interview, that by residing in the Twin Cities he could do exactly what he wanted, without the distractions of the politics of the New York contemporary musical world. He taught at the university for 40 years, forming close associations with the Minnesota Opera, the Minnesota Orchestra, the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra and other institutions in the region. Dominick Argento was born to Sicilian immigrant parents on Oct. 27, 1927, in York, Pa. As a child he took piano lessons and taught himself music theory from library books. He served two years (1945-47) as a cryptographer in the United States Army in East Africa, then earned his bachelor’s and master’s degrees in music from Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore. In 1954 he married Carolyn Bailey, a student at the conservatory and a fine singer. She would become his informal adviser and muse. She died in 2006. No immediate family members survive. Mr. Argento earned a doctorate in composition from the Eastman School of Music in Rochester in 1957. The next year, having been awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship, he spent a fruitful period in Florence, Italy. He was fully settled in Minnesota when the Guthrie Theater opened in Minneapolis in 1963. Mr. Argento had productive discussions about opera and theater with Tyrone Guthrie, the founder, and wrote music for several plays. The Guthrie was the site of the 1964 premiere of “The Masque of Angels,” Mr. Argento’s breakthrough opera, commissioned by the Walker Art Center in the same city through Minnesota Center Opera (which grew into the Minnesota Opera.) Center Opera also presented the 1971 premiere of “Postcard From Morocco,” which brought Mr. Argento international attention. In 1975, his song cycle “From the Diary of Virginia Woolf,” written for the British mezzo-soprano Janet Baker, earned Mr. Argento the Pulitzer Prize for music. Andrew Porter, The New Yorker’s music critic, reviewing a performance by Ms. Baker and the pianist Martin Isepp at Carnegie Hall in New York the next year, described it as “a beautiful, moving, and masterly work.” Not every Argento opera met with initial success, even among admirers. “Miss Havisham’s Fire,” first performed by the New York City Opera in 1979 and loosely based on Dickens’s “Great Expectations,” mingles past and present in a drama framed as an inquest into Miss Havisham’s death by fire. The Times critic Harold C. Schonberg wrote that though the concept was interesting, it was hard to “work up much interest” in Mr. Argento’s “conservative” and “featureless” music. In the late 1990s Mr. Argento produced a streamlined version, which has been performed with success. He kept composing into his late 80s, until hearing problems set in. In 2004 he won a Grammy Award for best contemporary classical composition for “Casa Guidi,” recorded by the mezzo-soprano Frederica von Stade and the Minnesota Orchestra. Mr. Argento fashioned a text from letters that the poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning wrote after moving to Florence with her husband and fellow poet, Robert Browning. Mr. Argento published “Catalogue Raisonné as Memoir: A Composer’s Life” in 2004. Each chapter is based on one of his compositions, which he likened to children that a parent molds and guides. But eventually each child “develops its own ideas” and “becomes its own master,” he wrote, adding: “My compositions, like children, have surprised me that way.” "
5c79785b49f0eacbf105aea4,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/01/arts/music/review-new-york-philharmonic-herbert-blomstedt.html,"If you didn’t know that the esteemed conductor Herbert Blomstedt was 91, you never would have guessed it from observing him in action with the New York Philharmonic on Thursday at David Geffen Hall. Still trim and agile, with thick white hair and plenty of stamina, he led vibrant accounts of works by Grieg and Dvorak, moving steadily and cuing the players with elegant, unfussy gestures. Naturalness in music-making is a hard quality to define. But there is no better way to describe the glowing, unforced performances Mr. Blomstedt drew from the Philharmonic. In a way, it was risky to begin with Grieg’s “Peer Gynt” Suite No. 1. How do you rescue this beloved staple from predictability? Actually, conductors may be avoiding it for that very reason: This was the first Philharmonic performance of the suite in almost 16 years. Mr. Blomstedt’s rendering abounded in freshness and character. In “Morning,” the first piece, he shaped the lapping melody in the strings, which gently dips and rises, with lovely flow and directness. By acutely voicing the sonorities in the subdued yet tragic “Ase’s Death,” Mr. Blomstedt made a case for Grieg as an inspired harmonist. “Anitra’s Dance” sparkled and teased. “In the Hall of the Mountain King” — music known to anyone who watched cartoons on television as a child — was all the more ominous for the hulking, eerily restrained and heavy-footed way it began here, building inexorably to brassy terror. Another Grieg staple, the Piano Concerto in A minor, was offered next, with the pianist Jean-Yves Thibaudet conveying the music’s rhapsodic sweep and bold contrasts as soloist. There was plenty of Mr. Thibaudet’s trademark refinement in his playing of lacy, ruminative, lyrical passages. He dispatched bursts of arpeggios and spiraling figures with virtuosic élan. Yet I especially liked the way he tore into vehement episodes: He tossed off bursts of double octaves with steely fortissimo sound, and brought earthy rawness to the driving left-hand chords and crunchy theme that opens the finale, which sounded like a dark Norwegian dance. Mr. Blomstedt ended with a spirited account of Dvorak’s hearty Eighth Symphony. It can be hard to make the episodic final movement hang together, but he found common ground between sections in which the stately theme is played with Brahmsian majesty and sudden outbursts when that music is turned into a rowdy Bohemian dance. This performance captured the musical variety while making the movement seem structurally integrated. The players enthusiastically applauded Mr. Blomstedt, along with the audience. He is not on the Philharmonic’s guest conductor roster for next season, alas. That he’ll be busy elsewhere seems a pretty good bet. "
5c74323049f0eacbf105a101,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/25/arts/music/review-matthew-polenzani-janacek.html,"A young farmer meets a girl with black eyes as deep as the sea, and can’t stop thinking of her. Noticing the young woman nearby as he plows a field, he worries his oxen will see how rattled he is. They make love. She becomes pregnant. Though he’s anguished over leaving his family and home, he bows to fate and goes off with her. This could be the stark plot of an opera by Janacek, who was drawn to tales of peasants sundered by desire. It’s also the narrative thread of that composer’s pathbreaking, emotionally raw song cycle “The Diary of One Who Disappeared.” The tenor Matthew Polenzani devoted the second half of a remarkable recital on Sunday at Zankel Hall to a fervently sung performance of the 35-minute work, accompanied by the pianist Julius Drake. Completed in 1920, “Diary” is seldom heard, though the Brooklyn Academy of Music will present Ivo van Hove’s production of the work in April. The score is an unusual hybrid of a song cycle (settings of 22 poems by Josef Kalda) and a quasi-opera for two characters: Jan, the smitten young man, and Zefka, the willful Romany girl (a mezzo-soprano who appears during an episode that could be an operatic seduction scene). Three female singers relate turns in the drama, like a Greek chorus. As in his powerful operas, Janacek is fixated in this cycle on setting the words to music that reflects the contours, sounds and rhythms of the Czech language. Still, for all their naturalism, the vocal lines also achieve agitated, plaintive lyricism. The piano sometimes steps back to provide bare harmonic support. Mostly, though, the instrument engages the vocal lines, shifting from moments of folkloric melody to passages of disorienting sonorities, or to stretches that become obsessed with a strange repeated riff. Mr. Polenzani brought baffled tenderness to the opening songs, in which Jan is distressed by his longing. But he sang with piercing intensity and terror during the cycle’s tumultuous episodes, when Jan becomes unhinged. The mezzo-soprano Jennifer Johnson Cano, fresh from her performance on Friday as Meg Page in Verdi’s “Falstaff” at the Metropolitan Opera, brought rich sound and coolly seductive allure to the songs in which Zefka appears. Kathleen O’Mara, Marie Engle and Megan Esther Grey, performing from an upper balcony near the stage, sang the music of the mysterious chorus. Mr. Drake played commandingly, including a piano solo depicting the consummation of this impulsive love — fitful music of hurtling chords and steely harmonies. To offer a quite different take on Romany life, Ms. Cano also performed Brahms’s appealing “Zigeunerlieder,” evocations of what was widely thought to be “Gypsy” music — though all Brahms knew of the style were the fluffy approximations played at the time in Viennese cafes. In the first half, Mr. Polenzani offered sensitive, deeply focused performances of six Schubert songs, followed by a nuanced yet forthright account of Beethoven’s song cycle “An die Ferne Geliebte.” While none of the music was written more recently than a hundred years ago, this program felt like a subtle model of artistic adventurousness. "
5c800d2a49f0eacbf105ba93,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/06/arts/music/john-adams-thomas-ades-piano.html,"After 250 years or so, the piano concerto has some life in it yet. This week alone, two piano concertos by two eminent composers, Thomas Adès and John Adams, will have their premieres on the same evening. They follow close on the heels of another, by the Pulitzer Prize-winner Caroline Shaw, presented by the Seattle Symphony earlier this year. On the East Coast, Mr. Adès will conduct the Boston Symphony Orchestra in his unambiguously titled Concerto for Piano and Orchestra, featuring Kirill Gerstein. On the other side of the country, the Los Angeles Philharmonic, under Gustavo Dudamel, will play Mr. Adams’s “Must the Devil Have All the Good Tunes?” with Yuja Wang. (No need to despair if you’re not in Boston or Los Angeles: Mr. Adès’s work travels to Carnegie Hall on March 20, and “Must the Devil” comes to Lincoln Center this fall, with a long list of future performances planned around the world through at least 2020.) In their own postmodern ways, these concertos acknowledge the genre’s long and wide-ranging history, while also searching for what else it is capable of. Here are previews of both. If this piece has a predecessor, it’s Mr. Adès’s “In Seven Days” (2008), a work that moves fluidly between concerto and tone poem. Mr. Gerstein was performing it with the Boston Symphony in 2012 when he gathered the courage to ask the composer to write something for him. “I remember saying that I knew I had to stand in line for a while,” Mr. Gerstein said. “And Tom charmingly said, ‘Does it have to be a solo piece?’” (Mr. Gerstein later learned from Mr. Adès’s publisher that he had “skipped the line,” by a lot.) Mr. Adès, 48, wanted to write, he recalled, “a proper piano concerto.” And in Mr. Gerstein he found a muse to explore the form’s tradition and the idea of virtuosity itself. The two met in the mid-2000s while performing Stravinsky’s “Les Noces,” and have since become friends with the kind of mutual admiration that leads to new music: Mr. Adès arranged a Berceuse from his opera “The Exterminating Angel” for Mr. Gerstein, who gave its premiere last month in Vienna. They’ve also embarked on a two-piano recital tour that will stop at Zankel Hall in New York on March 13. Mr. Adès’s nod to tradition begins with the title of the piece — unadorned and unpoetic. And, like nearly every concerto throughout history, it is in three movements, opening with the statement of a theme from both the piano and the orchestra. But there is always a twist with Mr. Adès. He revels in homage and quotation — just listen to his delightful Belle Époque pastiche score for the film “Colette” — and here he finds ways to adhere to convention while at the same time breaking free with surprising melodies and dizzying demands on the pianist. “I’ve really asked this piece what it wanted to do,” Mr. Adès said. “What it wanted to do was speak along traditional lines, the way a tree is a traditional form: It will always have a trunk. But I suppose part of me feels that the most freshness can be found in revisiting the tradition.” While preparing for the premiere, Mr. Gerstein — who with this week’s performances is reuniting with the Boston Symphony after recording Busoni’s colossal Piano Concerto in C with the orchestra — has often checked in with Mr. Adès, sending cellphone videos and asking interpretive questions in text messages. “I feel like I don’t have any anxiety,” Mr. Adès said. “Kirill seems to absorb it, and it speaks through him. It’s nice not to have any worry.” “I can’t play the piano,” Mr. Adams, 72, confessed in an interview. “I have never even taken a piano lesson.” That hasn’t stopped him from writing some of the most spellbinding contemporary music for the instrument, like “Phrygian Gates” or the joyous and sweeping “Grand Pianola Music”; or the duet “Hallelujah Junction,” which was inspired by the name of a truck stop and was a case, he has often said, of a title looking for a piece. His new concerto has a similar origin story. While working on his oratorio “The Gospel According to the Other Mary,” he said, he came across an old New Yorker article that included a phrase begging to be a title: “Must the Devil Have All the Good Tunes?” Mr. Adams hoped the quote came from Chuck Berry, but found out later it was Martin Luther’s. The words also suggested, Mr. Adams said, the Totentanz, or danse macabre. You can hear a similarity between Liszt’s “Totentanz” and “Must the Devil”: Both pieces begin with a low and lumbering piano part over the orchestra. But whereas Liszt opens with a Dies Irae melody, Mr. Adams aims for something funky and distinctly American. (The orchestration calls for a honky-tonk piano and a bass guitar.) What follows is a concerto that more or less adheres to fast-slow-fast convention but within a sui generis, single-movement form (as opposed to three, like the Adès) — similar to the way Mr. Adams has written symphony-length works without identifying them as such, like “Harmonielehre” and “Naïve and Sentimental Music.” “We live in a time when there are no templates,” he said. “Mozart was a genius but he didn’t have to find a new template for each piece. Each of us, when we write a new piece now, whether it’s a 22-year-old composer or someone my age, we have to decide its form.” The piano part, though it will be played by other soloists including Jeremy Denk and Vikingur Olafsson in the future, was written specifically for Ms. Wang — a superstar who delivers blurry-handed dazzle in showy standards but nuanced readings in more quietly demanding works, like Robert Schumann’s Piano Concerto in A minor. “She’s in there a lot,” Mr. Adams said of “Must the Devil.” He recalled being impressed by a video of Ms. Wang playing Prokofiev with the conductor Claudio Abbado, but found “real depth” in a recording of Rachmaninoff’s Études-Tableaux. “I thought: There’s something there besides the flash.” "
5c87eeb349f0eacbf105cab3,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/12/arts/music/review-esa-pekka-salonen-philharmonia-orchestra.html,"The Philharmonia Orchestra of London paid a visit to New York on Sunday and Monday with the conductor Esa-Pekka Salonen, and all I want to talk about is its sound. But if I had to name the standout moment that’s stayed with me from their two concerts at David Geffen Hall, it would be a brief pause that was filled to bursting with tension. It happened twice, actually, in the finale of a glittering performance on Sunday afternoon of Bruckner’s Symphony No. 7, where the composer writes in a short silence before a fortissimo onslaught. Both times, the hall filled with a mighty unison inhalation, a collective gulp of oxygen and nerve as powerful as that of an Olympic swimmer coming up for air in the butterfly. [See Mr. Salonen’s thoughts on the modern orchestra.] With good orchestras, you can sense the mental energy of 90-odd players bundled into one force. What I actually heard in those brief rests in the Bruckner were probably only the brass players reloading for the next big blow — but that breath was so dramatic as to seem to truly unify this massive ensemble. The Philharmonia under Mr. Salonen is a wondrous creature to behold. Painfully good, from the perspective of New Yorkers who had hoped that he would take over the leadership of the New York Philharmonic from Alan Gilbert. Their disappointment was softened only by reports that Mr. Salonen simply wasn’t in the market, wanting more time to compose. Then came the news in December that he is to become the next music director of the San Francisco Symphony. Mr. Salonen has worked with the Philharmonia Orchestra for over three decades. In that time, he has helped shape a sound that is stunningly muscular, smooth and cohesive. Those fortissimo salvos in the Bruckner had power but also a high-gloss polish — especially across the brass section, where individual colors were alloyed together, with just the gleaming trumpets sailing on top. These players know how to form impromptu combinations when the music requires it, as when the cellos and horns made a hybrid of oaky mellowness in the first movement of the Bruckner. Mr. Salonen’s obsessive attention to sound also found expression in two unusual placements: the one designed for greater blend, the other for disruption. In the Bruckner, the orchestra’s tuba player repositioned himself between movements. He joined the horns and Wagner tubas in the Adagio — their joint sound taking on a gnomish melancholy — before returning to his regular spot next to the trombones for the heavy lifting in the fortissimos of the final two movements. In Monday’s performance of Stravinsky’s “The Firebird,” a single trumpeter took up position in a balcony of the auditorium, startling listeners with notes of anarchic exuberance. Both Bruckner’s symphony and “The Firebird” require a careful marshaling of forces so that the climactic moments late in the game really soar. The composers’ approaches couldn’t be more different: In his sprawling, methodical works, Bruckner seeks the sublime within the strict confines of protocol. Stravinsky breaks rules; he questions and quarrels, and yet finds a consensus that tips into transcendence. Mr. Salonen found the balance between discipline and freedom in both works. That same balance informs Mr. Salonen’s own charismatic Cello Concerto, which here had an eloquent soloist in Truls Mork. Ever in pursuit of unusual sound constellations, Mr. Salonen shapes the final movement as a riveting contest of will between the solo cello and a percussionist stationed at a set of bongos and congas at the front of the orchestra. Besides the visual appeal — a blur of hands on skin and bow on string — the unlikely pairing makes you hear the rhythmic capability of the cello and the vocal quality of the drums. The concerto’s first two movements are a fascinating study in density and translucence, with sounds morphing from silvery and wan to red-blooded and impassioned. Orchestral textures that start off as a hollow whistle gather force like a storm that buffets the solo cello. The conclusion, after the kinetic fireworks of cello and drums have burned themselves out, sends slivers of electronically processed cello harmonics ricocheting around the auditorium like the distant keening of gulls. "
5c7ecea049f0eacbf105b79f,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/05/arts/music/yo-yo-ma-wu-man-new-york-philharmonic.html,"“A Happy Excursion,” a double concerto that has its American premiere on Wednesday with the New York Philharmonic, takes its title from an ancient Taoist text. But it could just as easily describe the joyous performance of its soloists, Yo-Yo Ma and Wu Man. They were at the top of their fields when they met in the 1990s: Mr. Ma, a superstar cellist; Ms. Wu, the world’s leading pipa player and a tireless ambassador for that lutelike Chinese instrument. Living in the same small Boston suburb, they became quick friends and colleagues; they’ve played together at the White House and with Mr. Ma’s Silkroad Ensemble. [How Yo-Yo Ma wants Bach to save the world.] Among their collaborators has been Zhao Lin, who wrote “A Happy Excursion” and, in the spirit of Silkroad, has already blended traditionally Eastern and Western instruments in another double concerto: “Duo” (2013), for cello and sheng, a Chinese reed instrument. His latest concerto — a lush and cinematic work in three movements — pairs the cello and the pipa, which dates back more than 2,000 years. (Compare that with the relatively young cello, created around the 16th century.) In an interview this week, Mr. Ma and Ms. Wu discussed the piece’s meaning, and what their instruments sound like together. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation. How would you describe the character of this concerto?  YO-YO MA Zhao Lin comes from a very literary and artistic family. He has a sense of old and new, and really knows poetic traditions. In the second movement, Wu Man plays this theme — it’s a melody that goes back to around the year 700 A.D. But he picked that and said, “I’m going to actually do something with this movement that shows something from that era,” the Tang dynasty. WU MAN In the Tang dynasty, music is very different from modern Chinese music. MA Zhao Lin also comes from Xi’an, which around the Tang dynasty had easily a population of over a million people. They had mosques, Buddhist temples and Christian churches. It was really open; they called it one of the golden ages. It was such a rich and open and multicultural society. So there is a kind of beauty to that movement, going back to this golden period. The title, “A Happy Excursion,” is a little misleading. What do you mean? WU In Chinese, everyone understands it. A better translation is that you’re more a kind of scholar. It’s the ideal life. With imagination, you can go everywhere you want to go. MA You can go everywhere. And he takes us through time travel. The first movement is all about the beginning of things, different forces that come together and become China. We have that second movement, the golden period. And then we have the last movement, the present. It’s in seven — it’s a very contemporary rhythmic sound — but it has elements of the golden period in it. So the question is, how are we, in our present moment, going to evolve ourselves? [Plan ahead with The New York Times’s Culture Calendar.] The timbres of your two instruments are so different. Does that pose a challenge?  WU I still remember the first time we played together. In the first rehearsal, I felt really bad and awkward because I didn’t know how I could play with the cello. They do sound different. We changed how we produce sound on the instrument. [Speaking to Mr. Ma] You changed your bowing. But over 20 years we kind of got used to it, so the combination of pipa and cello is not strange to us anymore. The pipa has a history as a court and solo instrument. But they can be produced for a bigger hall now, with steel strings instead of silk. We also use amplification. MA Can I say something about Wu Man? Whether it’s science, journalism or anything, you want people to take the profession further, setting the tone for what’s desirable and what can advance. Today, the pipa and Wu Man are kind of synonymous, and the instrument is normal. But it’s because in 29 years she’s gone from something that’s exotic to absolutely accepted. She plays in cafes, stadiums, concert halls, museums. She’s commissioned everybody: Lou Harrison, Philip Glass, Zhao Lin. The repertory was very small, but she has expanded it by several hundred thousand percent. What does it mean that this piece — and this instrument — is represented onstage with the New York Philharmonic?  MA What I love about New York is that it’s a world city. Depending on whom you ask, either that’s a terrible thing or it’s the most normal thing. You look at the New York Phil, and look at the number of Asians — what we need, actually, is much more African-American and Latin-American representation, because those are our two largest minorities. I don’t think either Wu Man or I feel odd being what we are. It feels normal to us. I’m not proud; I’m just glad. WU It’s music. Enjoy it. "
5c69bde43a125f5075c0a2cc,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/17/arts/music/review-concertgebouw-daniel-harding.html,"One way to test a relationship is to travel together. There’s nothing like a change of environment and the odd sudden surprise for revealing the structural flaws in a partnership, or knitting it closer together. When the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra and the conductor Daniel Harding took the stage at Carnegie Hall on Thursday and Friday the maestro and the musicians, touring together, may been wondering: Is this working for me? The Concertgebouw is one of the great orchestras in the world, and used to being wooed by stars. (As if to make the point, Friday’s program included Strauss’s “Ein Heldenleben,” which the composer dedicated to the players of this Dutch orchestra in 1898.) Since its chief conductor, Daniele Gatti, was fired last summer over allegations of sexual impropriety (he denied the accusations), the orchestra has been searching for a new leader.  When it tapped Mr. Harding, 43, an English conductor now mostly butterflying from one prestigious guest gig to another, to lead its American tour, many wondered if this was a first step toward something more lasting. Last week’s performances showed that while the partnership is still far from symbiotic, it can, at its best, make thrilling music. The jitters were mostly felt during Thursday’s program, which included Schumann’s “Manfred” overture, Mozart’s Symphony No. 40 and Brahms’s Fourth. On Friday things came together gloriously in Beethoven’s “Emperor” Concerto with the pianist Pierre-Laurent Aimard, “Heldenleben,” and a new work by Guillaume Connesson. With its well-worn staples, Thursday’s program looked safe on paper. But the orchestra injected it with a dose of unpredictability by inviting members of the National Youth Orchestra of the United States of America to join its ranks. This is part of an initiative the orchestra has developed at home and in European Union’ countries to give young musicians the experience of playing alongside first-rate professionals. It was a lovely gesture to extend on tour, even if it introduced the occasional unevenness into the Schumann. The shakiness of the Mozart was harder to explain. The pops of dynamic contrast in the first movement came across as shrill rather than exuberant and the long arc of the andante’s melody seemed pieced together out of Lego blocks with the seams all too visible. But Mr. Harding led an exciting reading of Brahms’s Symphony No. 4. The opening movement grows out of small motifs, in a way that can sound labored. Mr. Harding’s opening gesture was so expansive that the first sigh in the strings appeared to complete, or perhaps answer, a thought. This was the opening to a burnished performance built on long narrative arcs and juicy color. Brahms’s music proved a perfect vehicle for this orchestra with its plush strings, warm and rounded brass sound and, especially, its impressive horn section. The concluding passacaglia brilliantly tied together the moments of archaic severity and private expression, with a memorable flute solo of deep, increasingly desperate, sadness. “Eirene” is a 10-minute orchestral meditation on the Greek goddess of peace by Connesson, a stylistically omnivorous composer with a knack for scintillating textures. With its impressionistic opening giving way to sweeping melodies, the work has an appealing throwback glamour with touches of Mahlerian Weltschmerz and just a hint of jazzy swing. It was a peaceful opening to a concert centered around celebrations of the heroic, including — in Strauss’s tone poem — a saber-rattling depiction of battle that the Concertgebouw players delivered with ferocious energy. But Mr. Harding and Mr. Aimard, the splendid soloist in the Beethoven concerto, also showed that a certain amount of restraint can lend deeper dignity to valor. Their tempo in the first movement of the Emperor Concerto was sufficiently held back to lend the music a processional majesty. Dynamics were carefully balanced, with a glassy delicacy to the music-box passages and an almost tropical richness to the jubilant fanfares. There was more dazzle to come in the Strauss, and plenty of moments in which individual players and sections took the spotlight. One of the orchestra’s concertmasters, Liviu Prunaru, showed off a magnificently full-bodied sound in his solos. Mr. Harding conducted elegantly, with intelligence and purpose. Even so, I couldn’t help noticing that the musicians’ eyes were often elsewhere. String players often glance at each other, or keep their eyes focused on the concertmaster’s bow. Part of what makes this orchestra play so well is that its members approach the music like chamber musicians. which means that much of the time they don’t look at the conductor at all. "
5c76bff849f0eacbf105a75e,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/27/arts/music/review-carnegie-hall-jason-hardink.html,"Most pianists begin a recital with a piece that allows them to warm up a little, and gives the audience a chance to settle in. Not Jason Hardink. He began his concert on Tuesday at Weill Recital Hall with Jason Eckardt’s “Echoes’ White Veil,” a dizzying, manic 12-minute work of almost stupefying difficulty. There is just a hint of hesitancy at the start, with percussively repeated notes and sputtered trills. Then the music takes off — and how, with frenzied runs in each hand crisscrossing like strands of unhinged counterpoint, bursts of pummeling cluster chords leaping the length of the keyboard, and more. Some passages hint of avant-garde jazz, like an audacious Cecil Taylor improvisation, but with flintier modernist madness. This 1996 piece has become a calling card for Mr. Hardink, who played Mr. Eckardt’s score not just with command, but with abandon and remarkable clarity. Mr. Hardink’s daunting selections reflected, he wrote in a program note, his interest in large-scale works from all eras that “lie at the limit of feasibility.” Last year he ran the Wasatch Front 100 Mile Endurance Test in Utah, and this recital was a pianistic endurance test. There was a bit of relief when, after the Eckardt, he shifted the mood to play Book Two of Debussy’s “Images.” I wanted a little more nuance and milky sonorities in “Cloches à Travers les Feuilles.” But he brought welcome lucidity and rhythmic crispness to the music, especially the splashing murmurs and darting runs of “Poissons d’Or.” With Xenaxis’s “Evryali” (1973), Mr. Hardink was back in testing-the-limits mode with a work that explores extremes of expression. There are constant shifts from obsessively repeated notes and chords, to wildly skittish bursts, to rhythmic episodes that almost — but never quite — slip into a marching groove. Yet somehow the piece comes across as a complete entity, as least as played here with such bright sound and stamina. Liszt was a pioneer in pushing the bounds of what’s possible at the piano, especially in his Transcendental Études. Mr. Hardink played four of these. Other pianists have made these fiercely virtuosic pieces sound more rhapsodic and poetic. But Mr. Hardink dispatched them deftly. He ended with crystalline accounts of four pieces from Messiaen’s monumental cycle “Vingt Regards sur l’Enfant-Jésus.” Mr. Hardink’s capacity for tenderness and grace came through in the ruminative, harmonically tart passages of these cosmic pieces. But, no surprise, he was at his best in the vehement dance “Regard de l’Esprit de Joie,” in which he captured spiritual ecstasy as, to quote Messiaen’s description, “a drunkenness, in the most extravagant sense.” Even Mr. Hardink may have his limits: He played no encores. But what could follow such a program? "
5c9c7f5f49f0eacbf105f783,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/28/arts/music/hudson-yards-the-shed-arts-center.html,"On opening night at Lincoln Center, in 1962, Leonard Bernstein and the New York Philharmonic, joined by opera singers and a choir, performed music by Beethoven, Mahler, Copland and Vaughan Williams for an audience in tuxedos and gowns. The atmosphere should be decidedly more funky at the concerts that inaugurate the Shed, the 21st-century arts complex devoted to presenting new work, which is just two miles from Lincoln Center. Its first concert series, Soundtrack of America, will celebrate not the European classical sphere but the heritage of African-American music across a broad historical and stylistic spectrum, from spirituals to hip-hop. Most of the crowd will share a dance floor. It’s a statement of purpose, though it also promises to be a party. It signals that the Shed, a $475 million arts center within the Hudson Yards development of luxury retail, name-brand architecture and multimillion-dollar residences, will welcome cultural events and audiences well outside the economic elite. As with all of its programs, some tickets — spread across the room — will be only $10. “Because we’re starting from scratch, we’re trying to customize every decision to being inclusive,” said Alex Poots, the Shed’s artistic director and chief executive. He added: “We commission work across all platforms with parity between performing arts, visual arts and pop. They’re all equal, and there’s no poor relation either in terms of investment or in terms of space, in terms of facilities or in terms of brainpower.” Soundtrack of America, a five-concert series from April 5-14, is directed by the visual artist and film director Steve McQueen (“12 Years a Slave”) and will feature 25 up-and-coming musicians, five per night, playing roughly 15-minute sets. The performers’ mandate is to view the past from the present, placing songs of their own alongside music that influenced them. Their individual artistic paths are intended to add up to an expansive musical constellation. At first, Mr. McQueen said, he had imagined presenting an orderly linear musical progression, from the African rhythms that survived in Congo Square in New Orleans to the present. But America’s musical history made him reconsider. “It’s not linear,” he said. “It goes back on itself, it goes left, and it goes right. Is the wind linear? Sometimes it blows back and forth. It’s like a garden more than anything else. Things are sprouting up all over the place.” The opening-night roster includes Jon Batiste, the bandleader for “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert,” and PJ Morton, the Grammy-winning keyboardist from Maroon 5; other nights feature the rapper Smino; the Grammy-winning blues-rocker Fantastic Negrito; the blues-rooted guitarist Melanie Faye; and the idiosyncratic R&B songwriters Moses Sumney and Eryn Allen Kane. The Shed sought out musicians who are thoroughly conscious of forebears and possibilities. Serpentwithfeet — the self-described “pagan gospel” songwriter Josiah Wise — is on the bill April 9. “This show holds a different place in my heart,” he said. “I’ve always been a fan of not just black music itself, but of the narrative of black music. I’m thinking about the music of today, and how does that relate to the music of the 1940s, or the 1870s. I’m constantly thinking about it. I don’t have the privilege not to. Black music isn’t just decorative. It always has a lot of legwork.” The musicians will be backed by a house band — including horns and strings when needed — led by Greg Phillinganes, the prolifically recorded session keyboardist who has been the musical director for Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder onstage, among many others. The music, Mr. Phillinganes said, will be unmistakably live. “This is an Auto-Tune-free zone,” he said. Mr. McQueen intends the staging to focus on musicians at work. “We want to get as close to the bone as possible, to get to the idea of performance rather than any idea of spectacle,” he said. “I want to see the sweat. I want to see the tears. I don’t need glitter. I don’t need smoke.” The brain trust choosing and advising the performers also includes the history-making producer Quincy Jones, along with two younger producers, Dion Wilson (better known as No I.D., who produced Jay-Z’s album “4:44” and tracks for Kanye West, Drake, Common and Nas) and Tunji Balogun, an executive producer for H.E.R. and Khalid. Building Soundtrack of America was a labyrinthine process. To program the Shed, Mr. Poots cast a wide net of ideas — to, among others, Mr. McQueen, with whom he had curated projects in England. One day Mr. McQueen “phoned me out of the blue,” Mr. Poots recalled at an interview in the Shed’s temporary New York City offices. “He said: ‘Imagine hearing the history of African-American music. Imagine a family tree, and you hear from when the boats arrive, and African-American music starts happening all over the country, right up to now.” Mr. Poots immediately wanted to make that the Shed’s grand opening project, forthrightly declaring that African-American music was central to modern culture. “The minute the idea was hatched, this was going to be it,” he said. “I had absolutely no idea how to do it, and Steve really didn’t, but he said, ‘Let’s just start.’” Instead of a gala opening featuring superstars, Soundtrack of America will present emerging musicians. “We didn’t think it was strange,” Mr. Poots said. “But people have pointed out, ‘Who launches a new arts center with 25 pretty much unknown musicians?’ To me, it was a logical conclusion to the idea and the goal that Steve had set down.” Mr. McQueen and Mr. Poots, who are both British, knew they needed American perspectives and solid academic underpinnings, so they called on an expert: Maureen Mahon, a cultural anthropologist and associate professor at N.Y.U. who concentrates on African-American music. She oversaw a “family tree” — intended as a suggestion, not a canon — of music: from unrecorded African-American music through work songs, spirituals, blues, jazz, swing, bebop, R&B, rock ’n’ roll, hip-hop and onward. A panel of other advisers included the journalist Nelson George and musicologists with specialties ranging from current trap back to little-documented slavery-era music.  The family tree went out to the performers, but beyond that tree, musicians didn’t receive assignments; they defined their own musical genealogy. “It’s hard to pick fruit from such an amazing tree, but no matter which one I pick, I know it’s going to be sweet,” said Tarriona Ball, a.k.a. Tank, the frontwoman of New Orleans poetry-funk-jazz band Tank and the Bangas. “Or maybe even a little bitter, because the history isn’t always so clean.” PJ Morton, who grew up in New Orleans, plans to incorporate prime New Orleans R&B and Stevie Wonder in his set. “It’s a beautiful thing that we can be influenced by everything now,” he said. “But I do think it’s important to know that these are real people and real things, and to understand how we got here.”  The jazz-soul singer and songwriter Sy Smith is hoping to dovetail her father’s doo-wop, her classical music studies, the go-go music she heard while attending Howard University, the mixtape culture of early hip-hop and her current jazz-tinged mode. “I want people to appreciate that we all come from different places to end up where we are,” she said.  The initial five concerts may not be the end of Soundtrack of America. It will be filmed in a five-camera shoot; it could spin off an educational app. And given the infinitude of African-American music old and new, it could lead to additional concerts in many formats as the Shed welcomes culture without tuxedos. “I don’t view our first five concerts as the endgame,” Mr. Poots said. “That's the starting point. We could do this for years.” "
5c91125f49f0eacbf105dde9,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/19/arts/music/mostly-mozart-season.html,"An innovative, well-traveled production of Mozart’s “The Magic Flute” that takes its inspiration from silent film will finally come to New York. A new Mark Morris dance, “Sport,” set to Satie’s “Sports et divertissements,” will be given its world premiere. And a musical, theatrical adaptation of the Langston Hughes poem “The Black Clown” by the bass-baritone Davóne Tines and the composer Michael Schachter, will get its New York premiere. Those are among the highlights of this summer’s Mostly Mozart Festival, which will run from July 10 through Aug. 10 at Lincoln Center, and which is continuing to adapt and broaden its mandate since Lincoln Center stopped presenting its namesake summer festival last year. This summer’s festival, in addition to presenting classical concerts by the Mostly Mozart Festival Orchestra conducted by its music director, Louis Langrée, and more modern fare performed by International Contemporary Ensemble, will be centered around five large-scale, staged productions. [Check out our Culture Calendar here.] “The Magic Flute” has been seen by more than 300,000 people around the world since its premiere at the Komische Oper Berlin in 2012, in a staging by Suzanne Andrade and Barrie Kosky featuring animation by Paul Barritt. It will be conducted in New York by Mr. Langrée and will run at the David H. Koch Theater from July 17-20. It will be the New York debut for Mr. Kosky, an Australian-born impresario who has injected new life into the Komische Oper as its artistic director and has directed Wagner’s “Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg” at the Bayreuth Festival, and who is staging Offenbach’s “Orphée aux Enfers” this summer in Salzburg. Three of the summer’s big-ticket items involve dance. The Mark Morris Dance Group will open the festival with “Sport,” its new Satie work, which will be paired with “Empire Garden,” set to Ives, and “V,” set to Schumann. “Blak Whyte Gray,” by the London-based hip-hop dance company Boy Blue, which was well-received last fall at the White Light Festival, will return. And “Under Siege,” a mixture of dance and martial arts by the Chinese choreographer Yang Liping, will get its United States premiere. “The Black Clown,” an adaptation of Hughes’s painful dramatic monologue of racism and oppression, earned strong reviews when it had its premiere last fall at the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Mass. It will run from July 24-27 at the Gerald W. Lynch Theater at John Jay College. This summer’s concert lineup will feature soloists including the violinists Joshua Bell, Vilde Frang and Pekka Kuusisto and the pianists Martin Helmchen, Pierre Laurent-Aimard and Steven Osborne. Gianandrea Noseda will return as a guest conductor. Ivan Fischer will conduct the Budapest Festival Orchestra in Mozart’s “Jupiter” Symphony and selection of Handel arias, and the Takács Quartet will perform Mozart, Beethoven and Dohnányi in a concert with the pianist Jeremy Denk.

5c6fba6f3a125f5075c0af74,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/22/arts/what-to-see-in-new-york-city-this-spring.html,"Broadway, Wagner’s “Ring,” the opening of the Shed: what our critics and writers are looking forward to this season. ‘TOOTSIE’ What’s wrong with musical comedy? Generally, the music. And the comedy. Which may be why most of the best musicals of the last decade — “Fun Home,” “Hamilton,” “The Band’s Visit” — have been serious indeed. The art of being funny on the beat is mostly a lost one. But David Yazbek, the songwriter behind the musical comedies “Dirty Rotten Scoundrels” and “The Full Monty,” maintains the magic. Even his score for “The Band’s Visit,” mostly drenched in melancholy, has moments of lyrical hilarity. Let’s just say “marrow” and “pharaoh” never thought of rhyming until he insisted. That’s the top reason (among several) I have high hopes for the stage version of “Tootsie,” arriving at the Marquis Theater on March 29. Based on the 1982 movie about an actor whose stalled career revives only when he pretends to be a woman, it offers both the size and sentiment a musical comedy, in any era, needs for liftoff. JESSE GREEN ‘OKLAHOMA!’ What’s likely to be the freshest, most revolutionary musical on Broadway this season is more than three-quarters of a century old. Its title is “Oklahoma!,” and, yes, that’s the same Rodgers and Hammerstein show about farmers, cowhands and frontier love that was first seen in New York in 1943. But the director Daniel Fish’s revitalizing interpretation, scheduled to open at the Circle in the Square Theater on April 7, asks theatergoers to look at a deeply familiar classic through the eyes of the 21st century. The songs, dialogue and characters remain almost entirely the same. But as it demonstrated during its sold-out run at St. Ann’s Warehouse in Brooklyn last year, Mr. Fish’s version finds provocative depths of darkness amid the prairie sunshine. BEN BRANTLEY ‘INK’ The British actor Bertie Carvel, who wore a dress for his Tony-nominated role as the terrifying schoolmistress Miss Trunchbull in the musical “Matilda” six years ago, is switching to neatly tailored trousers for his return to Broadway. But don’t expect him to be any less intimidating. In James Graham’s “Ink,” which opens in April at the Samuel J. Friedman Theater, Mr. Carvel will be portraying one Rupert Murdoch. And in this London hit about the tabloidization of British journalism, directed by Rupert Goold, any similarities between Mr. Carvel’s character and a certain Australian-born media mogul are definitely not coincidental. BEN BRANTLEY ‘WHAT THE CONSTITUTION MEANS TO ME’ Heidi Schreck’s play about invisible women and the 14th Amendment was electrifyingly topical when it ran Off Broadway last year, amid the national outcry over the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh. Sadly or fortuitously, “What the Constitution Means to Me” is even more urgent as it moves to Broadway, where performances begin on March 14. Its take on abortion as a protected liberty (and a personal turning point) comes smack up against now-Justice Kavanaugh, who signaled, in one of his first opinions, a willingness to reverse Roe v. Wade. But the play is deeper than its timeliness suggests. Though it uses the idea of debate as a touchstone — and ends, deliciously, with a live one — it’s really about how we come to question our most bedrock assumptions about the world. If that makes seeing it almost a civic duty, duty has rarely been so pleasurable. JESSE GREEN ‘THE LEHMAN TRILOGY’ Three Bavarian-born brothers who first set foot on American soil more than 150 years ago are returning to New York next month, accompanied by a centuries-spanning brood of their descendants. Their names are Henry, Emanuel and Mayer, and they — and their seemingly countless kin — will be reincarnated at the Park Avenue Armory in Stefano Massini’s “The Lehman Trilogy,” an epic tale of financial rise and ruin, directed by Sam Mendes. This three-hours-plus production features what is surely the largest cast of characters of any play in town. Yet they are embodied by a mere three, seemingly inexhaustible actors with the power to multiply themselves like amoebas: Simon Russell Beale, Ben Miles and Adam Godley. Though the story they tell — which begins and ends with the world-rocking bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008 — is one of entropy, the play in which they appear promises to be a resounding testament to the regenerative powers of theater. As befits a sprawling, globe-girdling story of historic transformation, “The Lehman Brothers” has an intricate, multinational pedigree. Mr. Massini’s chronicle of a dynasty begun by emigrants to the United States began life as an Italian radio play before making its stage debut in Paris (in French) in 2013. Its Italian premiere was at the fabled Piccolo Teatro in Milan two years later, when it ran a whopping five hours. Ben Power’s English-language adaptation opened at the National Theater in London last summer, overseen by Mr. Mendes, the very busy stage and film director whose gripping production of Jez Butterworth’s “The Ferryman” is a current hit on Broadway. Mr. Power pared Mr. Massini’s trilogy to a sleek and unexpectedly lyrical three hours (not counting two intermissions) to be performed almost entirely by three actors on an elegant but nearly empty rotating set (by the ever-inventive Es Devlin). Otherwise, empty is hardly a word to be applied to this interpretation, as I can attest from seeing it at the National last July. Mr. Beale, Mr. Miles and Mr. Godley fill the stage to repletion, as they assume the varied forms of the dynasty-founding Henry, Emanuel and Mayer — and all subsequent generations of Lehmans. And their friends, lovers, spouses, customers, rivals, ad infinitum, with a variety that continually astonishes. Unlike investors who lost their fortunes on Wall Street a decade ago, no one who leaves this encounter with the brothers Lehman is likely to walk away feeling poor. BEN BRANTLEY ‘MARYS SEACOLE’ Born in 1805 to a free Jamaican mother and a Scottish father, Mary Seacole grew up to become an international businesswoman and freelance nurse, crossing paths with soldiers, royalty and Florence Nightingale. That would be more than enough material for a straight-ahead bio-drama — but not, it seems, for the always surprising and formally ingenious Jackie Sibblies Drury, whose “Fairview” was one of last year’s best plays. In the deliberately plural “Marys Seacole,” playing through March 24 at LCT3’s Claire Tow Theater, everyone in the six-woman cast is a Mary — or a Merry, a Miriam, a Mamie or the like. The indispensable Quincy Tyler Bernstine appears as the historical Mrs. Seacole in this production directed by Lileana Blain-Cruz. The others, whose characters cross continents and time, help raise a central question of nursing even now: Who takes care of the people who take care of others? JESSE GREEN ‘WHITE NOISE’ No American playwright has contributed more to the churning and ever-evolving conversation about race in these United (and divided) States than Suzan-Lori Parks. This prodigiously imaginative writer, who won a Pulitzer Prize for “Topdog/Underdog,” has addressed the toxic legacy of slavery in a rich assortment of theatrical forms and languages, from the surrealism of her early “The America Play” to the Homeric chronicle “Father Comes Home From the Wars.” Now Ms. Parks is focusing her gaze on interracial friendships in the 21st century with the resonantly titled “White Noise,” which begins previews next month at her longtime home, the Public Theater. Oskar Eustis, the Public’s artistic director, oversees a four-member cast, led by Daveed Diggs (the original Marquis de Lafayette in “Hamilton”) as an African-American man forced to reconsider the depth and danger of the gap between black and white. BEN BRANTLEY ‘MRS. MURRAY’S MENAGERIE’ I’m not sure anyone could have imagined a duller setting for a play than a high school faculty meeting, yet in “Miles for Mary,” the theatrical collective called the Mad Ones turned the banality of the break room into a hilarious and ultimately galvanizing Off Broadway hit. As if to top themselves, the Mad Ones return this spring with “Mrs. Murray’s Menagerie,” set in (a) the 1970s; at (b) a focus group; for (c) a children’s television show. That is all we know, and all we need to know. Except that the Ars Nova production, which begins performances on March 26 at the Greenwich House Theater, features a cast of expertly light-touch farceurs under the direction of Lila Neugebauer, who made “Miles for Mary” so moving behind the laughs. If this is banality, let’s have more! JESSE GREEN THE ‘RING’ The Metropolitan Opera’s high-tech, low-energy production of Wagner’s four-opera “Ring,” which returns for three cycles this spring, has been notable mostly for its snafus. At its first performance — “Das Rheingold,” back in 2010 — the set’s massive array of seesaws malfunctioned near the end, spoiling the gods’ climactic ascent across a rainbow bridge. Another time, the Microsoft Windows logo flashed across the stage instead of the sophisticated projections that distinguish the cycle’s many locales. One performance of “Die Walküre” that was being broadcast live to cinemas worldwide was delayed nearly an hour because the “Machine,” as it became known, wouldn’t cooperate. And that’s not counting the loud creaks and whirs that accompanied its every move. But while the Met claims that the costly Machine — conceived by the production’s director, Robert Lepage — has been tamed, the technical troubles always struck me as distractions from the real problem. All of Mr. Lepage’s spending and innovation resulted in a cycle that was dull, and out of touch with Wagner’s intricately drawn characters and plot. The singers seemed genuinely undirected, lost in front of the set’s imposing mass; the production team was scrambling to make the effects work, but it appeared that relatively little attention had been given to the acting. There were no discernible relationships charted onstage, no drama, no attempt to transmit — let alone interpret for our time — complex themes of power, sacrifice and societal collapse. Indeed, though the set design meant that some singers spent long stretches in a kind of trough, the effects, while wonky, may have been the best part. At the beginning of “Das Rheingold,” bathed in blue light, the 20 enormous planks levitated in silence. Wagner’s long, low E flat began. Then, like the music, the machine began undulating — first slowly, then faster. It truly was the river Rhine. The opening storm of “Die Walküre” similarly came to life: We were in a sky full of dark, rushing clouds; then in the middle of a forest during a snowstorm; then inside a hut glowing with firelight. It was sweeping and evocative. A production crowded with visual stimulation, in which the singers seemed to be left to their own devices? This “Ring” reminded me, more than it probably intended to, of the Met’s hyper-realistic Franco Zeffirelli spectacles of the 1980s. Like Mr. Lepage, Mr. Zeffirelli creates grand spaces in which stick figures are moved around. The shows ignite when you have compelling performers and sink when you don’t. This revival — which Peter Gelb, the Met’s general manger, is mounting after many thought the Machine, last seen in 2013, would be mothballed for good — does indeed have some compelling casting. Christine Goerke, as Brünnhilde, promises more vocal confidence than Deborah Voigt had when the production was new; Greer Grimsley and Michael Volle will each make a capable, articulate Wotan; Philippe Jordan returns to the Met for the first time since 2007 to conduct. Things may well go more smoothly this time around. But will this yet be a Wagner we can believe in? ZACHARY WOOLFE ‘PRISONER OF THE STATE’ “How he mocked me,” a villainous official laments, explaining why he locked away the political prisoner he now wants killed. That chilling line rings out in “prisoner of the state,” the new David Lang opera that reimagines Beethoven’s only opera, “Fidelio”; the New York Philharmonic will give its premiere on June 6.Beethoven’s theme feels as resonant as ever in a country grappling with questions about mass incarceration; immigrants separated from their children at the border; whether the president is answerable to the law; and how inmates were quietly kept without heat or light for days in a federal jail in the middle of New York City. The opera, directed by Elkhanah Pulitzer, will serve as the finale of Jaap van Zweden’s first season as the Philharmonic’s music director, and he will conduct a cast that includes the moving bass-baritone Eric Owens. MICHAEL COOPER ECSTATIC MUSIC FESTIVAL Among its other skills, the Bang on a Can organization  is smart about fund-raising. By soliciting fans to help them commission new works, the collective ensures a reliably expanding repertory for its in-house chamber ensemble, the Bang on a Can All-Stars. The latest batch of these “People’s Commissioning Fund” pieces comes to the Ecstatic Music Festival at Merkin Concert Hall on March 6. Fresh music by Nicole Lizée and Pulitzer Prize-winner Henry Threadgill will share a bill with vintage works by Annie Gosfield and Glenn Branca, who died last year. The evening’s theme is music for dancing, which Mr. Threadgill has previously explored with his Society Situation Dance Band. If you can’t make it to the concert, you can tune in for a live webcast, on newsounds.org. SETH COLTER WALLS MITSUKO UCHIDA It’s easy to forget that the piano is a percussion instrument when it’s played by Mitsuko Uchida. She animates it with both symphonic might and enchanting lyricism — a perfect fit for the vast emotional range and singing melodies of Schubert. Ms. Uchida recorded one of the finest cycles of Schubert’ssonatas, and she has been revisiting portions, the late works, in a survey at Carnegie Hall. That comes to an end this spring, with two recitals on April 30 and May 4. Endings are very much part of both programs. They are almost stages of grief: The Sonata No. 20 in A (D. 959) contains an abruptly tumultuous passage, like a petulant tantrum, then the heart-rending Sonata No. 21 in B flat (D. 960) offers bittersweet acceptance. JOSHUA BARONE THE SHED The Shed has a modest name and enormous ambitions. Opening April 5, it’s the cultural component of the gigantic Hudson Yards development on the West Side of Manhattan: an eight-story structure that includes galleries; rehearsal space; a theater that can adapt to seated or standing-room events; and a shell that can enclose an adjacent plaza into a performance space. Its mandate is to commission and present world premieres of new and innovative works, and its artistic director and chief executive, Alex Poots, arrives after a decade as the artistic director of the Manchester International Festival in Britain and, in recent years, of the Park Avenue Armory in New York City. The Shed’s first full-scale offering celebrates the heritage and scope of African-American music. Over five nights from April 5-14, “Soundtrack of America” sets out to explore a “family tree” of American music, from spirituals to hip-hop, with a lineup of 25 young performers to bring out continuities and breakthroughs. “Soundtrack of America” arrives with unquestioned credentials. The series is conceived and directed by the filmmaker and video artist Steve McQueen, whose “12 Years a Slave” won the Oscar for best picture in 2014. His brain trust includes the illustrious producer Quincy Jones; the crate-digging hip-producer No I.D. (a.k.a. Dion Wilson); and the keyboardist Greg Phillinganes, who was Michael Jackson’s musical director and has worked with Stevie Wonder, Eric Clapton and Bruno Mars. The performers announced so far — five each night — include 2019 Grammy winners like Fantastic Negrito and PJ Morton; the genre-meshing New Orleans band Tank and the Bangas; Judith Hill, who sang backup for Prince and Michael Jackson, among many others; the rapper and singer Smino; the eerily idiosyncratic, falsetto-loving songwriters Moses Sumney and serpentwithfeet; and Jon Batiste, who leads the band Stay Human on “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.” The African-American musical family tree gives them a boundless source of potential material. The Shed has also announced another major musical production, May 6-June 1: a premiere from Björk, who introduced her “Biophilia” in 2011 at the Manchester International Festival. Björk describes it as “my most elaborate stage concert yet, where the acoustic and digital will shake hands”; her backup includes a seven-woman Icelandic flute ensemble. The title, promisingly, is “Cornucopia.” JON PARELES ROBYN A Robyn show is a bit different from other pop concerts. It isn’t an over-the-top spectacle of rotating set pieces and wardrobe changes, or a showcase of vocal acrobatics and choreographed backup dancers. It is sweaty and straight-up — pop church and pop group therapy, a place for fans of the Swedish singer and songwriter, who first hit the United States in the late 1990s, to experience Robyn’s transcendent, deeply addictive music beside her. From February to April, including a stop at Madison Square Garden in New York on March 8, she’s touring to support “Honey,” her first full album in eight years, which came after a half-decade of psychoanalysis and a series of personal challenges. Her loyal listeners have been anxiously waiting to share their euphoria and pain. CARYN GANZ MASSIVE ATTACK In 1998, the British trip-hop trio Massive Attack unleashed its third album, “Mezzanine,” a brooding, sensual, chilly, paranoid record of sputtering grooves and gauzy atmospherics that wound its way into popular culture everywhere, from “The Matrix” to the TV show “House.” The band has released two more albums in the 21 years since, but the gravitational pull of “Mezzanine” remains potent, and the group — now a duo consisting of Robert del Naja (known as 3D) and Grant Marshall (Daddy G) — is playing a series of shows marking its (belated) 20th anniversary. The brief tour, which hits Boston on March 14 and wraps in San Diego on April 2, promises to be an enveloping, dynamic visual extravaganza. CARYN GANZ BIG EARS FESTIVAL The Big Ears Festival in Knoxville, Tenn., has become a point of pilgrimage for all sorts of experimental listeners: Indie classical, avant-garde jazz, ambient electronic music and post-rock are all well accounted for here. The festival will celebrate its 10th anniversary, March 21-24, overtaking nearly a dozen spaces across the city’s downtown. All are within walking distance of each other, but each is comfortable and acoustically sound enough that you’ll forget what you’re missing a few doors down. This year’s acts range from the virtuoso vocalist Theo Bleckmann (paying tribute to Kate Bush) to the radical improvisers in the Art Ensemble of Chicago to the psychedelic, soulful explorations of the rock band Spiritualized. Big Ears 2019 doubles as a 50th-anniversary celebration of ECM Records; the influential label will present 20 performances throughout the festival, featuring artists from across its eclectic roster. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO MERCE CUNNINGHAM Merce Cunningham, that marvel of a choreographer, understood that dancing meant different things to different people. In the book “Merce Cunningham: Fifty Years,” he is quoted as saying: “What to some is splendid entertainment, to others is merely tedium and fidgets; what to some seems barren, to others is the very essence of the heroic.” His entire career was a heroic act of vision and persistence. One of the most revered and revolutionary choreographers of the 20th century, Cunningham was a rule breaker who collaborated deeply with many artists, including his life partner, the composer John Cage. Their experiments involved allowing music and dance to exist separately, as well as introducing the concept of chance as a creative device. In 2019, the year of his centennial, Cunningham — who died at 90 in 2009 — is being celebrated all over the world with performances, workshops, talks, screenings and more. “The ideas are still very much alive and relevant and exciting and creative,” Ken Tabachnick, the executive director of the Merce Cunningham Trust, said. “Every time I see something again, I’m just amazed at how relevant it is. It could have been made yesterday.” That is one of the important points that Mr. Tabachnick and Trevor Carlson — a trustee and the producer of the Trust’s celebration of the centennial — hope to impart with the multi-tentacled celebration. Events continue all year and are updated on the Trust’s website, but one highlight is just around the corner: “Night of 100 Solos: A Centennial Event,” on April 16, Cunningham’s birthday. Three cities — London (at the Barbican), New York (at the Brooklyn Academy of Music) and Los Angeles (at the Center for the Art of Performance at U.C.L.A.) — will stage Events, the name that Cunningham gave to performances that featured fragments of works from his repertory. (Events date to 1964.) “We’re looking to continue Merce’s tradition of doing things that hadn’t been done before,” Mr. Carlson said. “We wanted to make the largest Event ever made.” In the spirit of the new, none of the performers — including the New York City Ballet principal Sara Mearns, the Martha Graham dancer PeiJu Chien-Pott and the choreographers Kyle Abraham and Vicky Shick — are former Cunningham dancers. Those dancers are involved, however, in staging the solos. (Cunningham’s company, according to his wishes, disbanded after his death and a legacy tour.) “We wanted to signal that the Cunningham legacy has a future for people who never experienced Cunningham,” Mr. Tabachnick said. “So you’ll see ballet dancers, you’ll see dancers who are not classically or rigorously trained, you’ll see younger dancers and older dancers. And that is to show the diversity and breadth of the possibilities for the legacy.” Events are piling up, and include a Cunningham celebration at the Joyce Theater (April 17-21) featuring Compagnie CNDC-Angers/Robert Swinston, Ballet West and the Washington Ballet. Amid the excitement, Mr. Carlson has a problem. It’s a good one. “It’s wild, but I’m afraid we might have to expand the amount of time of the centennial in order to include everyone who wants to be included,” he said. “I think we’re going to see ourselves extending to what would have been Merce’s 101st birthday.” GIA KOURLAS DANCE THEATER OF HARLEM Dance Theater of Harlem has never been just another ballet troupe. It was created, in 1969, as a hopeful reaction to hope-crushing circumstances. The assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was among the spurs to action, but the principal problem in need of addressing was longstanding and continuing: the dearth of opportunities for ballet dancers who were not white. “You can’t do this,” these dancers were told by the world in many ways. Dance Theater of Harlem told them they could, and then proved it to the world. The survival of this institution for 50 years deserves a big celebration. With the death of its trailblazing founding director, Arthur Mitchell, in September, the anniversary festivities have also become memorials. In recent decades the company has valiantly struggled with diminished funds, and its New York season at City Center (April 10, 12-13) isn’t as grand as one might wish. Such signatures pieces as “Agon,” “Firebird” and “Creole Giselle” return only in excerpts. But it’s appropriate that one of Mr. Mitchell’s works (“Tones”) is being revived, and Robert Garland, the troupe’s underrecognized resident choreographer, is presenting a premiere. However these turn out, the occasion is major. BRIAN SEIBERT PAM TANOWITZ When Emma Portner, known for her video dances, withdrew from a New York City Ballet commission, the company turned to Pam Tanowitz. The circumstances are hardly ideal, but here’s a one-word reaction: Finally. Ms. Tanowitz, whose new ballet will be unveiled at the company’s spring gala on May 2, has been making dances since 1992. Celebrated for her ability to mix classical and contemporary vocabulary within a framework of formal structures, she will expand a piece set to Bartok’s String Quartet No. 5 that she created during a choreographic workshop at American Ballet Theater in 2017. It’s not the prolific Ms. Tanowitz’s only new dance this season: In April, she presents a work at the Martha Graham Dance Company; another commission, from Paul Taylor American Modern Dance, will have its premiere at the Orchestra of St. Luke’s Bach Festival in June, the same month she presents a new work for her company and the City Ballet dancers Sara Mearns and Taylor Stanley at the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council’s River to River Festival. And on March 22, she will land in Cleveland to stage a site-specific work at Pilgrim Congregational Church for her company along with local dancers. “Recital #1 (five small dances for Cleveland)” is an experiment: She’s looking at ways to reimagine her repertory. GIA KOURLAS LIGIA LEWIS Every so often, New Yorkers catch a glimpse of the choreographer Ligia Lewis, who spends much of her time in Berlin. Her brief visits, which in recent years have been high points of the American Realness festival, are not to be missed. Capping the refusal-themed “No Series” at Performance Space New York, Ms. Lewis will present “minor matter” and “Water Will (in Melody),” two parts of a triptych that began in 2014 with the spare and piercing “Sorrow Swag.” Each work in the trilogy corresponds to a color, teasing out its associations: blue, red and white. (“Sorrow Swag” featured a lone male performer enveloped in blue light.) First seen in New York at Abrons Arts Center, where three indefatigable dancers (Ms. Lewis included) seemed almost to topple the theater walls, “minor matter” (red) returns May 21-22. Exploring the space between love and rage — and the relationship between blackness and the black-box theater — it stages a kind of tangled collective struggle, in which the people onstage could be conspiring with or against one another, maybe both at once. The final part, “Water Will (in Melody),” May 28-29, flirts with melodrama and catastrophe, which sounds like a fitting end. SIOBHAN BURKE "
5c814b2149f0eacbf105bde2,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/07/arts/music/review-yo-yo-ma-wu-man-new-york-philharmonic.html,"Try not to smile when you watch Yo-Yo Ma and Wu Man onstage together. I dare you. The two musicians — he’s a superstar cellist, she’s our leading pipa player — seem at first like an odd couple. Mr. Ma plays with brazen emotionality; you get the impression he couldn’t pull off a poker face if he tried. Ms. Wu, calm and unshowy, casts a quiet spell as she gracefully plucks the strings of her lutelike instrument. But they exude amiability, with jolly glances frequently thrown back and forth, and unexpected compatibility. The cello and pipa have vastly different sounds and histories. Yet together, in the hands of Mr. Ma and Ms. Wu, they are as intimately harmonious as a cafe singer and guitarist. At David Geffen Hall through Saturday, they’re playing Zhao Lin’s double concerto “A Happy Excursion,” which had its American premiere on Wednesday with the New York Philharmonic under the direction of Long Yu. (And how refreshing to hear a work by a Chinese composer outside the Philharmonic’s annual Lunar New Year concert.) Mr. Lin’s crowd-pleasing concerto begins with a blossoming soundscape that gives way to increasing bustle and, eventually, a lushly cinematic swell that reaches its climax with brass fanfare and crashing cymbals. The soloists evoke characters: Ms. Wu’s pipa on a merry walk, matched by Mr. Ma’s bouncing, buoyant down-bow strokes. The second movement retreats from the excitement with a misty opening, like quiet daybreak. Over spare orchestration, the pipa plays a slow and simple melody inspired by a 1,200-year-old Chinese tune. But in the finale, we return to the commotion of the first movement, now less stable and more unpredictable, the way a busy city’s streets can change suddenly from block to block. All too predicable, however, is the majestic ending — but it’s easy to forgive Mr. Lin’s heavy hand while swept up in the filmic grandeur and sparkling cheer of Mr. Ma and Ms. Wu. “A Happy Excursion” had a fitting companion in Tchaikovsky’s emotive “Pathétique” Symphony. The Philharmonic musicians can probably play this overprogrammed piece in their sleep; in the past, it has occasionally felt as if they were doing just that. But under Mr. Yu’s baton, they summoned surprising extremes, leavened occasionally with the brisk lightness of a Tchaikovsky ballet. Like Mahler’s Ninth Symphony, which the Vienna Philharmonic was playing on Wednesday evening at Carnegie Hall, the “Pathétique” has an unusual form of four movements in slow-fast-fast-slow progression. Mr. Yu seemed to approach it as program music, finding a long arc in the work’s adagio bookends. So much so that he hampered applause — which New York audiences typically delight in — between the third and fourth movements. He was aiming for a startling juxtaposition, of a rapid plunge from the deceptive bliss of the scherzo to the profound despair of the Adagio Lamentoso. This was a slow finale with high stakes, darkly commanding attention to the very end of a concert that had begun, two hours before, so joyously. "
5c3d9ee23a125f5075c04708,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/15/arts/music/yannick-nezet-seguin-met-opera-gay.html,"It wasn’t love at first sight when Yannick Nézet-Séguin, the new music director of the Metropolitan Opera, and his partner, Pierre Tourville, met as students at the Montreal Conservatory almost 25 years ago. “I felt I needed to emancipate, to get out of my parents’ place, as one does at 20,” Mr. Nézet-Séguin said recently at Julius’, the West Village gay bar. “And so we were just roommates.” “You and your best friend,” he said, turning to Mr. Tourville, “she and you were looking, and I said, ‘I’m going to be your roommate.’” Mr. Tourville, a violist, was dating, he admitted with a laugh, “many people at the same time.” Mr. Nézet-Séguin was in a four-year relationship — with a woman. But did Mr. Tourville seriously think Mr. Nézet-Séguin was straight? “Not for very long,” Mr. Tourville deadpanned. “It became pretty clear. Quickly.” It’s not unusual to share meet-cute stories over cheap cocktails at Julius’, one of the oldest and coziest gay bars in the city. But it was an extraordinary conversation to be having with the music director of the nation’s largest performing arts institution. While culture — particularly high culture — is indelibly associated with gay tastemakers, audiences and creators, it’s a sign of how outmoded our conception of authority is that remarkably few major performing arts leaders have been openly gay. In classical music and opera, even New York, the city that gave rise to the modern gay rights movement with the Stonewall riots 50 years ago this June, has been dominated since then by two conductors: Leonard Bernstein and James Levine, who both kept sexual relationships with men hidden. So chatting casually about coming out, bullying and Celine Dion with Mr. Nézet-Séguin and Mr. Tourville was a sign that a new generation is coming to power, one for which sexual orientation is far less fraught. And it adds to the sense that Mr. Nézet-Séguin, 43, who is conducting Debussy’s “Pelléas et Mélisande” at the Met through Jan. 31, represents a milestone, and not just for opera. Despite gay pioneers like Michael Tilson Thomas (at the San Francisco Symphony) and Marin Alsop (in Baltimore), conducting remains an overwhelmingly straight (and male, and white) profession. As throughout society — business, politics, sports — music has struggled to produce and promote leaders outside of the traditional mold. It doesn’t help that the field is by its nature past-loving and has major centers in countries like Italy and Russia, where reactionary values still reign. “Orchestras and opera companies are microcosms of our society and our world, and this is a representation of it,” said Deborah Borda, the president and chief executive of the New York Philharmonic, and the partner of Coralie Toevs, the Met’s development chief. “If you think about Western society, the epitome of leadership — and people go around teaching courses on this — is a conductor. And the model is Toscanini: a man who stands on the podium, has total authority and simply tells people what to do. He is grand, and white, and fully patriarchal.” Mr. Levine, Mr. Nézet-Séguin’s predecessor at the Met, was fired last year after a company investigation found evidence of sexual misconduct. He has denied the accusations, but no one disputes that he has always been fiercely guarded about his personal life. The contrast with Mr. Nézet-Séguin — who has been openly gay for his entire professional career and nonchalant enough about it to post a smiling partners’ beach selfie on Instagram — is impossible to miss. “The fact that he’s so comfortable with who he is is part of what makes him a powerful, effective artistic leader,” Peter Gelb, the Met’s general manager, said in an interview. “Because he is proud of who he is, and that’s very important.” While he hasn’t wanted to make what he called “a big fuss” about his relationship, Mr. Nézet-Séguin sees himself and Mr. Tourville as symbolic of a widening conception of what a conductor can be. “It’s becoming more important for me,” he said, “to just realize that both of us, we can be examples, in a way, to inspire young musicians who fear that this is going to be a problem in their profession and career advancement. And I want to embrace that role more and more.” “Just by being, and by living our life,” he added, “this is hopefully something that breaks the preconceived ideas.” The two men both grew up in Quebec, Mr. Nézet-Séguin in Montreal and Mr. Tourville in Trois-Rivières. Even if it was perhaps unusual to declare, at 10, that he wanted to be a conductor, Mr. Nézet-Séguin said he was spared teasing. But Mr. Tourville was bullied so badly that he changed high schools in his second year. Sexual orientation, Mr. Tourville said, isn’t “clear at that age, but they feel you’re different. It was more about: I played music, I was good at school. I was different, more sensitive.” Mr. Nézet-Séguin recalled the transition from long-term heterosexual relationship to openly dating his male roommate in the mid-1990s as reasonably smooth. “There was no crisis with it,” he said, waiting a beat: “I mean, there was some surprise.” When they announced to both pairs of parents that they were a couple, the news was well received, though Mr. Nézet-Séguin allowed that “I can’t say it was necessarily only easy.” Mr. Tourville interjected that perhaps it wasn’t “the happiest moment of their life.” But, Mr. Nézet-Séguin added, “in both cases it didn’t affect the connection.” (His mother still handles his website and his schedule in Canada; his father manages the finances.) In those early years, Mr. Tourville was the breadwinner, with checks coming in as a freelance violist, while Mr. Nézet-Séguin toiled as a piano accompanist. They fondly recalled a $20 all-you-can-eat pasta deal on Tuesday nights at a local restaurant. “We had these dinners where we said: Oh, one day we’re going to go to Vienna, one day we’re going to go to Paris,” Mr. Nézet-Séguin said. “That was part of the dream.” They started a Baroque music ensemble, corralling players and pasting together scores in all-night marathons. Mr. Nézet-Séguin began to build his conducting career in Canada. In 2000, he became music director of the Orchestre Métropolitain in Montreal — and, in 2003, Mr. Tourville’s boss there. (Yes, it’s a bit awkward and stressful for your partner to try out for a viola seat in the orchestra you conduct, even if the audition is blind. “Of course, as soon as he did one note I recognized it,” Mr. Nézet-Séguin said.) Both of them still have their positions with the orchestra, and the arrangement has proved an ideal one: The ensemble is part-time, allowing Mr. Tourville to travel with Mr. Nézet-Séguin. “It’s kind of a package deal, I guess,” Mr. Tourville said. “When Yannick is there, most of the time I’m there, too.” They have been pleasantly surprised at having Mr. Tourville mentioned in the public ceremonies that introduced Mr. Nézet-Séguin as music director of the Rotterdam Philharmonic (a position he held through last year) and the Philadelphia Orchestra (where his contract has been extended until 2026). Mr. Tourville was an important factor in Mr. Nézet-Séguin’s decision to concentrate on Philadelphia, New York and Montreal, and to curtail his work in Europe for the time being. “There’s a lot of difference between, door to door, three and a half hours and no jet lag, compared to, like, 10 hours and you arrive and can’t do anything for three days,” Mr. Tourville said. “It was becoming a little crazy.” With much of their furniture from Rotterdam — including a Zaha Hadid “moon” sofa — en route to their rental apartment near Lincoln Center, things will be a lot less crazy in the coming years. “I think we’re more and more jealous of our very private time,” Mr. Tourville said. “And we like to have just cozy nights at home with a good meal, a cooked meal, and watching HGTV. That’s the ideal night.” Mr. Tourville referred with a laugh to the trope of “conductor wives,” who imperiously attend even rehearsals. He sticks to performances. “I think I know him well enough,” he said of Mr. Nézet-Séguin, “to know when he’s trying something or being unnatural, musically.” And is Mr. Tourville right when he intervenes? Mr. Nézet-Séguin smiled: “Always.” So Mr. Tourville will be an important adviser as Mr. Nézet-Séguin turns the page on the Levine era, not just symbolically but also musically. “The basic presence of the orchestral sound is not exactly what I imagine it can be,” Mr. Nézet-Séguin said, in his most detailed public comments yet about his intentions for the Met’s orchestra. “I think it’s a little too dry and lifeless in piano, and I think that in forte it’s just maybe unbalanced internally.” For the company’s recent new production of “La Traviata,” he said, he worked with the ensemble on “a much richer sound, resonant, pizzicato, bass-oriented. Cellos and basses: I’m a lot about what they need to do. Not because they’re not good, but because for years they’ve been asked to be as short and light as possible.” “That was the conception of sound of my predecessor,” he added. “I just have a totally different idea, and we miss very often the fundamental of the harmony. Whenever it’s a little bit longer and richer and with more vibrato, it changes completely the aural spectrum.” A wholly different kind of aural spectrum — and a spectacle that was queer even by opera standards — was on display in October, when Mr. Nézet-Séguin was featured on the Canadian national television show “En Direct de l’Univers,” a kind of “This Is Your Life” told through the people and music you love. His nieces and nephews were on, as were his parents and trainer. Rufus Wainwright sang a few songs. But the climax was a duet: the Jacques Brel number “Quand On N’a Que L’Amour” (“When Love Is All You Have”), with Mr. Tourville joined remotely by none other than Celine Dion. Mr. Nézet-Séguin cried — mostly, he said, “because I was watching Pierre sing a duet with his idol.” The couple is not married, but for a gay union, there could hardly have been a more sacred ceremony. “It made an impact,” Mr. Nézet-Séguin said. “We did not realize that, and yet it made an impact. Hey, two guys sang their love, with Celine blessing it.” "
5c67087e3a125f5075c09f74,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/15/arts/music/review-thomas-dausgaard-new-york-philharmonic.html,"Thomas Dausgaard, a busy conductor on the international scene, plugged a gap in his resume and, at 55, made his debut with the New York Philharmonic on Thursday. But he is not among the guest conductors recently announced for next season, which is unfortunate: He led an exceptionally urgent and insightful account of Schumann’s Second Symphony. He may want to focus his attention on the thriving Seattle Symphony where, this fall, he steps up from principal guest conductor to music director, succeeding Ludovic Morlot. But I hope we’ll hear more of him in New York. He has a penchant for challenging players, partly though bold interpretive ideas, but also with his idiosyncratic conducting style. With his lanky frame and sweeping arm gestures, Mr. Dausgaard often seemed almost to hover over the players. And there were places in the Schumann symphony, especially at the start of a section, in which the Philharmonic players were not quite in sync. Sometimes the flow of a passage took time to settle in. Yet I was engrossed throughout. Mr. Dausgaard, who avoids going for big statements, conveyed the work’s subtle dramatic character and brought out striking details. This symphony can sometimes seem at odds with itself, with stretches in which Schumann tries to channel his wild imagination into majestic Beethovenian symphonic forms. A fantastical episode is run through with rigorous contrapuntal passages. But Mr. Dausgaard balanced all these elements. The restrained opening of the first movement came across like a hybrid of a Bach chorale prelude — complete with a walking Baroque bass line — and a stirring Romantic fanfare. When, after a transitional passage played here with enticing ambiguity, the main Allegro section took off, the playing had both rhythmic spark and sly impetuosity. The Scherzo zipped along with crisply dispatched passagework in the violins. Yet the performance also captured the slightly manic animation that drives the music. The expansive, glowing slow movement had lyrical grandeur without grandiosity. The restless finale came across like a spiraling and slightly dangerous dance. Mr. Dausgaard opened the concert with a dark, mysterious account of Nielsen’s “Helios” Overture. And the program included the  pianist Stephen Hough as soloist in a vibrant performance of Beethoven’s Third Piano Concerto. Mr. Hough’s playing was lucid, rich with colors and full of surprises. Some of those surprise turns seemed to catch Mr. Dausgaard off guard; Mr. Hough is not so easy to follow himself. But this just lent the performance a wonderful immediacy. "
5c532a4e3a125f5075c07568,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/arts/music/review-new-york-philharmonic-emanuel-ax.html,"Observers of the New York Philharmonic who love new music were quick to lament the end of the Contact! series, contemporary-minded concerts started by the Philharmonic’s former music director, Alan Gilbert. But this season, the initiatives created to fill the gap — two series, “Nightcap” and “Sound On” — have proven roughly as consistent in quality as Contact! was. On Sunday at the Appel Room, at Jazz at Lincoln Center, the Philharmonic fielded a “Sound On” program that was one of its most entertaining new-music shows of the past couple of years. Called “Threads,” it was related — at least a little — to last week’s premiere of “Fire in my mouth,” a new oratorio by Julia Wolfe inspired by the 1911 Triangle shirtwaist factory fire. Sunday’s concert was organized around composers who have spent some time in America. Close enough (if you’re generous). [Read our review of the premiere of “Fire in my mouth.”] Stronger than any connection to Ms. Wolfe’s work was the level of the music selected by the host and curator of “Sound On,” the violist Nadia Sirota. Among the highlights was “At the Kansas City Chinese New Year Concert,” a compact but theatrically astute string quartet by Chen Yi, who has long taught at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. The first movement has an inviting, celebratory air. The second uses long-held tones and vibrato effects to evoke, according to Ms. Chen’s program note, hand-pulled noodle making. The concert put some Philharmonic players in intriguing spotlights. The pianist Eric Huebner was arresting, whether teasing out the Dowland-derived melody of Thomas Adès’s solo “Darknesse Visible,” or pulsing away with the machine-like rhythms of “Bulb,” a piano trio by Donnacha Dennehy. Another string quartet — “Chambers,” by Marcos Balter — was, for me, the standout. Mr. Balter’s music tends to be both rigorous in construction and playful in overall effect. In his program note, he wrote of his interest in creating an aural illusion of forces larger than those on stage. He achieved this in the delirium of the third movement, which seemed to draw from the static opening movement and the more staggered patterns of the second — while adding something newly mystical. I wondered what he might do with the full forces of the Philharmonic at his disposal. The repertory at the orchestra’s main stage concert on Wednesday evening at David Geffen Hall was rather less contemporary. Which is not to say that inspiration was absent. Half the program was every bit as rousing as the “Sound On” event. The pianist Emanuel Ax’s turn in Stravinsky’s Capriccio for Piano and Orchestra had elegant energy running through it, as did Jaap van Zweden’s approach to Mozart’s Symphony No. 41 (“Jupiter”). In Stravinsky’s succession of instrumental color pairings, Mr. Ax had a knack for blending with the Philharmonic players while still punching his sound through. The composer’s love for then-new jazz textures was evident, and appropriately jaunty. But crucially, the performance wasn’t jokey. This was caprice with just the right amount of edge. In the “Jupiter” Symphony, Mr. van Zweden found smart ways to assert his personality without losing the overall shape of the piece — as when he allowed bass-heavy orchestral balances to bloom (ever so briefly) during the inner movements. Less gripping were the performances that opened the concert. Mr. Ax clearly delights in Haydn. But a sense of discovery was absent during this version of the Piano Concerto No. 11 in D. And while Mozart’s first symphony, written when he was 8, makes for an obvious complement to the “Jupiter,” his final symphony, programming the early work can also seem like a frittering away of the orchestra’s time on stage, merely for the benefit of a cute idea.

5c8181bc49f0eacbf105bec0,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/07/arts/music/migrations-the-making-of-america-immigration.html,"What do migrants bring with them? On a one-way trip to an unknown new life, perhaps they might pack money, documents, clothes, some small keepsakes. Invisibly and intangibly, they also carry cultural memories: the lullabies their parents sang, the dances they tried at a wedding, the best way to cook a chicken. On new territory, those memories become a link to home and also, with any luck, something to share with the neighbors. It’s the American story, repeated with countless variations for each new arrival; it’s also a hot-button subject in politics worldwide. And it’s the theme for “Migrations: The Making of America,” a citywide festival that gets into gear this weekend, with Carnegie Hall at its center along with more than 75 partner organizations around the city, including the New-York Historical Society, the Irish Arts Center, Harlem Stage, the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research, El Museo del Barrio and the Vietnam Heritage Center. The festival encompasses dance workshops, panel discussions, and walking tours of Harlem along with concerts large and small. “So many different cultures and so many different ethnicities want to tell their story,” said Clive Gillinson, the executive and artistic director of Carnegie Hall. “It tells you something about the potency of the subject.” Carnegie’s own programs focus on three historical migrations to and within the United States: the Irish and Scottish influx in the 18th and 19th centuries; Jews arriving from Russia and Eastern Europe from the late 19th century until the 1924 National Origins Act set quotas on immigration; and the Great Migration of 6 million African-Americans from the South to northern industrial cities. British Isles immigrants brought a repertoire that seeded Appalachian and country music. The Jewish contingent brought essential songwriters to Tin Pan Alley and Broadway. And the Great Migration disseminated blues, jazz, gospel and the other glories of African-American music. When you consider that “some of the most sublime inspirational art you could ever imagine” came out of appalling situations, Mr. Gillinson said, “I think it tells you a lot about what human beings are able to do in transmuting some of the most painful and hardest things in life into something that can actually uplift everyone.” The far-reaching jazz pianist Jason Moran and the opera-trained mezzo-soprano Alicia Hall Moran, his wife, along with guests from jazz, rock, gospel and classical music, address the Great Migration in a Carnegie Hall concert on March 30 titled “Two Wings.” Its foundation, the Morans said in a phone interview, is the book “The Warmth of Other Suns” by Isabel Wilkerson, who will appear. Songs on the program like the spiritual “Two Wings” and the blues “Route 66,” buoyant as they seem, are nonetheless about escape. “The root is sheer terror,” Jason Moran said. “It’s people having to retreat, people having to hide, people having to gather what few belongings they have and do some real improvisation and go to some other city — only to get to that city and discover some other trials later on.” Jewish heritage and its American evolution will have a flagship concert on April 15. “From Shtetl to Stage: A Celebration of Yiddish Music and Culture,” produced by the author Seth Rogovoy, gathers classical musicians (the violinist Gil Shaham and the pianist Evgeny Kissin), klezmer musicians (the clarinetist David Krakauer and the trumpeter Frank London, the show’s musical director), singers and actors to explore the Yiddish theater and its extensive influence. At Zankel Hall, the klezmer clarinetist and mandolinist Andy Statman will lead his trio on March 14, and Michael Feinstein will perform “The Great American Jewish Songbook: Kern, Berlin, Arlen, Rodgers and More” on March 27. The Scots-Irish facet of the festival begins March 9 with a dedicated segment of “Live From Here,” the American Public Media radio show hosted by the eclectic mandolinist and songwriter Chris Thile. “I was a bizarre choice to host this one, seeing as I’m a Southern California boy with no detectable Scotch-Irish heritage to speak of,” Mr. Thile said by phone. (Most of his ancestry is German.) “But in another way, it makes a lot of sense, because it’s about how much influence those migrations have had on American culture and American life.” He added, “Music and the artistic benefits of an ethnically diverse society are undeniable. This country would be nothing without all of the various peoples who are here. What would we have, musically speaking, had we just kept this place all to our initial selves? To say nothing of the fact that it wasn’t ours to begin with.” On April 6 at Zankel, the festival will present the Gloaming, a quintet of Irish and American musicians who merge deeply traditional Irish fiddling and singing with daring, often luminously introspective harmonies and arrangements. To Martin Hayes, a fiddler from County Clare who founded the group, the Gloaming continues a century-long dialogue between Irish music and its American diaspora, restoring some of the subtleties that were discouraged by the limitations of early recordings and the guitar-strumming enthusiasm of the 1960s folk revival. “There is a thread of unacknowledged, deeper emotional expression that got ironed out of the music in some ways,” Mr. Hayes said. In the Gloaming’s music, “Lots of things can happen, but the only rule is that they actually amplify and develop the innate feeling that happens inside the melodic structure.” Meanwhile, the melting pot continues to simmer. The Migrations festival has embraced a series now in its fifth year at the Flushing Town Hall arts center: Global Mashups, which presents double bills of musicians from disparate traditions for an audience that comes to dance. Dance steps are taught before the performance, and after each group plays its own set, they jam together — an accelerated version of American music’s cross-pollination. “By the end of the night, you’re not a stranger any more,” said Ellen Kodadek, the executive and artistic director of Flushing Town Hall. This year’s lineup begins March 9 with the category-defying Hazmat Modine — a blues-rooted group that can swerve into New Orleans brass-band jazz, ska or klezmer — and Falu, a singer born in Mumbai who will be performing music from vintage Bollywood films and from Holi, a Hindu spring festival of renewal and forgiveness. Falu represents the 11th generation of a family of Hindustani classical musicians; she immigrated to the United States 20 years ago, and studied Western songwriting at Berklee College of Music. Her Indian-rooted children’s album, “Falu’s Bazaar,” was a nominee at the most recent Grammy Awards. “My purpose in making ‘Falu’s Bazaar’ was to keep the tradition living,” she said. “To give everybody who has immigrated, who has a different culture to latch onto, who has some story to tell, to give validation that your song matters, your story matters.” She has no qualms about the cross-cultural jam with Hazmat Modine. “Music is the most unifying power,” she said. “We’re going to bring people together.” "
5c7ef21149f0eacbf105b800,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/05/obituaries/joseph-flummerfelt-dead.html,"Joseph Flummerfelt, the pre-eminent American choral conductor of his generation and a collaborator with some of the nation’s most renowned orchestras and maestros, died on Friday in Indianapolis. He was 82. The cause was a stroke, according to the Spoleto Festival U.S.A. in Charleston, S.C., where he was the director of choral activities for 37 years until retiring in 2013. Mr. Flummerfelt played an outsize, if not always highly visible, role in American classical music. He prepared choruses for hundreds of concerts by the New York Philharmonic and a host of other famous orchestras and maestros, and he trained generations of singers and conductors at Westminster Choir College in Princeton N.J. He often readied choirs behind the scenes, then handed them off to more famous conductors, who would lead them onstage for the final rehearsals and performances. He was the de facto chorus master of the New York Philharmonic for decades, preparing nearly 600 choral performances with the orchestra from 1971 through 2016. And when other top orchestras and conductors — a pantheon that included Claudio Abbado, Leonard Bernstein, Pierre Boulez, Carlo Maria Giulini and Riccardo Muti — needed choruses for their requiems, masses and choral symphonies, they often turned to Mr. Flummerfelt. Along the way, he became the best-known American choral conductor since Robert Shaw, the great chorus-builder and conductor, who had been a friend and mentor. Mr. Flummerfelt conducted the Westminster Choir, the larger Westminster Symphonic Choir and the New York Choral Artists, which he founded in 1979. His choirs were featured on some 45 recordings, several of which won Grammy Awards, including one of Mahler’s Symphony No. 3, conducted by Bernstein, and another of John Adams’s “On the Transmigration of Souls,” a work commissioned after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, with Lorin Maazel conducting the Philharmonic. Mr. Flummerfelt played key roles as well at the Spoleto Festival U.S.A. and the Festival dei Due Mondi in Spoleto, Italy. He often spoke of a need for flexibility in performance — warning that trying to “machine-in every detail” could “straitjacket” performers and stifle creativity. “At a certain point, you have to let go and trust that the technical aspects will hold,” he told his friend and former student Donald Nally, who became an esteemed choral conductor and teacher himself, for Mr. Nally’s book “Conversations With Joseph Flummerfelt: Thoughts on Conducting, Music, and Musicians” (2010). “You need to just let it sing and, in a very real sense, to let the performance evolve organically and spontaneously.” Joseph Ross Flummerfelt was born on Feb. 24, 1937, in Vincennes, Ind., where his father, John Ross Flummerfelt, was a funeral director and his mother, Mavorette (McGinnis) Flummerfelt, was a piano teacher. When he was about 5, he recalled, he came home from hearing her play the organ at the First Baptist Church, sat down at the family piano and picked out the hymn “Stand Up for Jesus” by ear. He had found music. His family bought its first record player when he was 12, and it came with a free recording of Handel’s “Messiah,” stirring in him dreams of conducting. “I remember spending hours in front of our living room mirror conducting that recording,” Mr. Flummerfelt was quoted as saying in Mr. Nally’s book. “Having seen only our local church choir and high school band directors at work (remember, this was before television), I didn’t really know what I was doing; yet responding to the music with some sort of gesture seemed to come naturally.” After graduating from DePauw University in Indiana, where he studied organ and church music, he studied under a number of influential figures, including Nadia Boulanger. It was his mentor Shaw who first sounded him out about going to teach at Westminster Choir College. Mr. Flummerfelt became a sought-after teacher and conductor at the college for 33 years. One of his summer students was a teenage Yannick Nézet-Séguin, who went on to become the music director of the Metropolitan Opera and the Philadelphia Orchestra. In 2009 Mr. Nézet-Séguin told The New York Times that his sessions with Mr. Flummerfelt had been the only significant conducting lessons he ever received. “Flummerfelt had a such a relaxed way of approaching the sound, with relaxed gestures and breathing,” Mr. Nézet-Séguin said. “Today I regard those things as my fundamentals, as much for orchestral work as for opera and choral music.” Mr. Nally, who conducts the Crossing, a Grammy-winning professional chamber choir in Philadelphia, and directs choral organizations at Northwestern University’s Bienen School of Music, said in a telephone interview, “The country is absolutely populated with people who studied with Joe.” At Westminster, Mr. Flummerfelt broadened its repertory and performance opportunities, said Joe Miller, who succeeded him. “He was kind of the artistic visionary behind the school,” Mr. Miller said by phone. (The college made headlines recently for another reason: It is being sold by Rider University to a Chinese company, but the sale is being challenged in court.) Mr. Flummerfelt was brought to the Spoleto festivals in Italy and then Charleston by their founder, the composer Gian Carlo Menotti. When Menotti left the Charleston festival in a dispute in 1993, he made it clear that any artist who continued to work there would not be welcome at his Italian festival. Mr. Flummerfelt became the only artistic leader to give up Italy’s Spoleto — and give up working with Menotti — so that he could remain in Charleston, said Nigel Redden, who later became general director of the American festival. “It is impossible to overemphasize how important that decision was to the preservation of Spoleto Festival U.S.A.,” Mr. Redden wrote in an email. Mr. Flummerfelt’s survivors include a brother, Kent, and two sisters, Pam Flummerfelt Rappaport and Carol Flummerfelt Helmling. In the Nally book of conversations, he spoke of the transcendent nature of conducting “I do long for those moments where everything is in place, where everything is flowing, and then the real truth comes from the source — whatever that is: God, the creative impulse, it doesn’t matter what you call it. And suddenly, things happen, which you couldn’t have planned. Real beauty is being created because all of the forces are perfectly lined up and a profound innermost connection is manifested.” "
5c645cba3a125f5075c0985b,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/13/arts/music/daniel-harding-concertgebouw-carnegie-hall.html,"Thirty years ago, the conductor Simon Rattle received a letter. It was from a teacher at Chetham’s School of Music in Manchester, England, telling Mr. Rattle about an extraordinarily talented teenage maestro there named Daniel Harding. “Chetham’s is set up for extremely gifted instrumentalists,” Mr. Rattle said in an interview. “And they had no idea what to do about a young conductor.” So Mr. Rattle, then the hotshot 30-something leader of the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, took Mr. Harding under his wing. Mr. Harding eventually became an assistant in Birmingham and even lodged with the Rattles, who would feed him ham sandwiches, which were more or less all he ate at the time. “He doesn’t look very old now, but at age 16 or 17 he really looked 11,” Mr. Rattle said, describing Mr. Harding’s first time in front of the ensemble, rehearsing Hans Werner Henze’s daunting Seventh Symphony. “I think the orchestra thought I was playing an April Fools’ game on them. And when this 11-year-old look-alike conducted the whole movement flawlessly, including wordlessly correcting some mistakes, the orchestra was completely flabbergasted.” The decades since have been, in many ways, good to Mr. Harding, now 43, who will lead the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam at Carnegie Hall on Thursday and Friday. He is principal conductor of the respected Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra and has served stints as principal guest of the London Symphony Orchestra and principal conductor of the Orchestre de Paris, from which he departed last year with a letter of notably graceful candor. Mr. Harding is a regular on the podiums of Europe’s leading orchestras, including in Vienna and Berlin. He took over the Concertgebouw’s American tour after the firing of its chief conductor, Daniele Gatti, amid sexual misconduct accusations; the prestigious assignment placed him in the midst of the much-watched competition to replace Mr. Gatti. “It’s a big badge of approval that they’re having him do this tour,” said Alan Gilbert, a friend who, until 2017, led the New York Philharmonic, adding, “He’s a brilliant musician, and really, really knows what he’s doing, in an enormous range of repertoire.” But America has proved a tougher nut to crack. “I haven’t found in the U.S. — I haven’t found my place, so to speak,” Mr. Harding said in a phone interview. When he was starting his career early in the 2000s, he did a circuit of major ensembles here: Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, Atlanta. The results were mixed, to say the least. While some concerts were solid, there were frustrations between him and the musicians — mutual incomprehension, some stormy scenes. “I came and did the rounds when I was a really young conductor,” said Mr. Harding. “And my experiences in Europe were quite protected. I knew people quite well. I think I just wasn’t ready for how some of the big U.S. orchestras worked, and how they would relate to me.” “I look back on some of the great orchestras here,” he added. “For example, Chicago. I can see exactly why that didn’t quite click.” He described the problem by recalling the composer and conductor André Previn, who watched Mr. Harding rehearse Strauss at Tanglewood one summer. “I have no idea what you’re doing,” Mr. Previn told Mr. Harding. “Why are you talking so much?” Especially when Mr. Harding was younger — and looked younger still — this flood of explanation and analysis came across as the cockiness of an immature know-it-all. “I love to talk,” he said. “I love to share with an orchestra why I want something to be a certain way. Does a conductor play an orchestra like a piano, manipulating without saying a word? For me, I was taught that’s almost disrespectful. So I come and just talk, talk, talk, and that’s just not how it works here.” Mr. Harding, for his part, believes he has matured in recent years. “I think that I’ve been learning — these are things that take a lifetime to learn — how to enjoy what’s different about each situation,” he said. “Instead of ‘I wish this were like this.’” A few years ago, wanting to work on technique and communication, he hired Mark Stringer, a onetime protégé of Leonard Bernstein, as a coach. And he has been dipping his toe back in the United States, though the jury is still out. He made his debut with the San Francisco Symphony last year in a program of Beethoven and Strauss; it got so-so notices. “Harding seemed to have something specific and urgent to say about each individual measure,” Joshua Kosman wrote in his review in the San Francisco Chronicle, “which made for a lot of trees and not much forest.” Mr. Harding was supposed to return to San Francisco later this month but canceled on Feb. 8, citing an injury. He is scheduled to return to the New York Philharmonic next season, for the first time since 2011. Deborah Borda, who presented Mr. Harding at the Los Angeles Philharmonic (where he canceled, citing an injury, in October) and is now president and chief executive in New York, said: “Young conductors, when they make these lightning rounds of the major orchestras — New York, Boston, Chicago, Philly, L.A. — it’s almost unfair, to put that much pressure on them at that time. And sometimes what you need is a little break — not to learn repertoire, but to practice. And then they come back.” Decades after making him ham sandwiches, Mr. Rattle is still in Mr. Harding’s corner. “These last five years have been, I think, a complete other thing to Daniel,” he said, adding: “I’ve seen a quantum leap in what he can do. He was always full of music, but he can now really make it work. With any of the greatest orchestras in the world.” "
5c3618343a125f5075c038d6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/09/arts/music/philip-glass-john-adams-david-bowie-los-angeles-philharmonic.html,"Three years to the day after the death of David Bowie, two eminences of American music will come together in Los Angeles to pay tribute. John Adams is set to conduct the Los Angeles Philharmonic in the premiere of Philip Glass’s Symphony No. 12, “Lodger,” at Walt Disney Concert Hall on Thursday. The work is inspired by Bowie’s 1979 collaboration with Brian Eno and the producer Tony Visconti, the final album in what’s usually called their Berlin trilogy, which also includes “Low” and “Heroes,” both from 1977. Mr. Glass’s First Symphony, back in 1992, was based on “Low”; his Fourth (1996), on “Heroes.” “I put off the third for a long time — 20 years — before I realized that I owed them something,” Mr. Glass said in a recent telephone interview. Mr. Adams was also on the conference call — he in Berkeley, Calif., Mr. Glass in New York — to discuss the symphony, Bowie and whether Mr. Glass’s music is hard to conduct. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation. How did this symphony come about? PHILIP GLASS It’s part of a commitment I had made to David Bowie and Brian Eno to take three of their records and turn them into symphonies. In “Lodger,” to me the most interesting thing was the lyrics, the poems. In the earlier ones, the musical idea was quite challenging and worthwhile to work on, but when I got to “Lodger,” I didn’t find that interest in the musical part of it; the interest was in the text. After hedging a little bit, I thought I might as well make a song symphony. Mahler, of course, was the great one at that. I used seven of the texts; I didn’t use all 10. That would have pushed me over an hour, and I didn’t want to go there. I don’t know, John, if you’re aware of this, but this was written — the words were written — when David was living in Berlin. JOHN ADAMS Yeah, you mentioned that to me. GLASS And Brian was there, and Iggy Pop was there; those were his companions. They were there trying to make a movie out of “The Idiot” by Dostoyevsky. None of them spoke Russian, or German, even. But on the other hand, these were three really interesting people in our music world and music life, and made big statements — icons, all of them. ADAMS A really great text is just so generative; it produces the best music. If I have a concern about some operas these days, it’s that the texts are just not good enough. It doesn’t have to be someone with a deep literary background; it can be a David Bowie or Brian Eno. The great thing about American music is the total bleed-through of, if you want to call it that, high or low, popular versus art. I think both Philip and I share this. We have very loose filters in terms of classification. When did you first hear each other’s music? ADAMS The thing I remember most vividly is a tour of the ensemble doing excerpts from “Einstein on the Beach,” which I heard in San Francisco sometime in the 1970s. Then I actually conducted quite a bit of his music — a little piece, “Facades,” and then I think we did the very first performance of parts of “Akhnaten” in L.A. on a Phil program, 50 minutes’ worth. I did the Ninth Symphony, again with L.A., and then this. I came of age during what we now call the bad old days, when the world said you had a choice between European modernism and its American version, or Cagean aesthetics. Hearing Philip’s music and Steve [Reich’s] music was this wonderful, new possibility of a language that embraced both tonality and sort of living with a pulse, new, original and fresh. GLASS I was very much taken with hearing John’s work — of course, “Nixon in China,” we talked about a number of times. It’s not enough to create a style of music or identity of your own; what you really want to be is in the company of other people. It’s more meaningful to be part of a large group of people sharing ideas. He was the first time I met someone who wasn’t part of my immediate generation but had the interest and talent. How many operas do you have now? Five or six? ADAMS [Laughing] Not as many as you do! [Depending on how you count, Mr. Glass has composed nearly 30.] Is Philip’s music tough to conduct? ADAMS It continues to be a slow absorption of Philip’s orchestral music into the regular repertoire; I’m surprised that more conductors haven’t taken it on. He has a couple of symphonies, like the Eighth, where there are some real challenges rhythmically. But it’s not hard to conduct on a technical level. I think the challenge is creating a sound, and with some orchestras it’s simply getting them into the right frame of mind. Something like the Ninth Symphony, which is nearly an hour long, it demands a kind of Zen-like concentration by the players, the way some Bruckner symphonies do. It’s not like doing “The Rite of Spring,” where there’s a thrill every 10 seconds. You have a steady build and a long line. What does it pair best with? ADAMS I don’t think there’s a great challenge there. You could put anything with it. I see programs that have put a piece of Philip’s together with a Baroque piece; that makes sense in certain ways. I’ve put his smaller pieces on programs with my own music, but sometimes with Steve or Terry [Riley]: obvious harmonious conjunctions. This program we’re doing at the L.A. Phil, I’m doing with an old piece of mine, “Grand Pianola Music.” GLASS I’m delighted to be able to hear it again. I haven’t heard it in a long time. Philip, does it annoy you that these symphonies are still not done more widely? GLASS Quite the opposite: I’m astonished at the size of audiences I’m getting now. I never thought that this music would be accepted in the way it’s being accepted. I had my first performance with the New York Philharmonic when I was 80 years old. I mean, come on! I think it’s partly that I’ve been helped by a younger generation that has very broad ideas and taste, and I don’t seem nearly as strange as I used to be. I’ve become — not mainstream, that seems a little too far — but still I can tell from the Ascap [the music licensing agency] reports that the music is being used. ADAMS A central thing about Philip’s music is it is utterly original, it is immediately identifiable as his, and that is an extraordinary thing, and it’s actually a very rare thing. It’s such an astonishing thing that Philip did, which was to take very, very simple materials and a simple mode of expression, and create something that was original. And it just caught on in an immensely popular way. It’s an honor to be a part of it. GLASS I have to publicly apologize for getting you the score so late. ADAMS [Laughing] It’s O.K.; we all do it. "
5c40cbce3a125f5075c04f6a,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/arts/music/review-new-york-philharmonic-jaap-van-zweden.html,"The subscription-series format long commonplace at American orchestras, with a weekly offering of standard repertory, is looking a little, well, standard. Take the program Jaap van Zweden led with the New York Philharmonic at David Geffen Hall on Wednesday. There was no particular musical connection or thematic thread linking the two staples performed: Beethoven’s Second Piano Concerto and Rachmaninoff’s Second Symphony. Yet, on its own terms, this was an exceptional concert. The brilliant pianist Yefim Bronfman was the soloist in a pristine, elegant account of Beethoven’s youthful concerto. And for Philharmonic regulars trying to glean what special qualities Mr. van Zweden may be bringing to the orchestra in his inaugural season as its music director, the compelling performance he led of Rachmaninoff’s rhapsodic symphony revealed new dimensions of his artistry. I get impatient with the hourlong piece, which for all its lyrical richness can seem long-winded. During whole stretches, this plushly orchestrated symphony strikes me as a Rachmaninoff piano concerto that’s missing the solo part. When the orchestra goes through endless manipulations of some theme, I find myself wanting a pianist to break in and take charge with a cascade of steely chords. In trying to bring freshness to standard repertory works, Mr. van Zweden has a tendency to overdo things. With his insightful account of this symphony, though, he did almost the opposite. He brought out inner details, revealing the rhetoric of the piece — that is, the way phrases are written like sentences, grouped into paragraphs, even when the music seems on the surface to run on with overextended elaborations of themes. Rachmaninoff was in his mid-30s when he wrote the Second Symphony, first performed in 1908, and still felt bruised by the hostile reaction to his First a decade earlier. The slow Largo section that opens the piece unfolded like the introduction to an essay, with themes almost presented for consideration. The orchestral sound is rich and thick, with passages played over dark, sustained bass tones. Yet the performance had remarkable lucidity and breadth, which continued as the Largo segued into the restless, expansive Allegro main section of the first movement. Mr. van Zweden drew crisp, snappy playing from the orchestra in the exuberant, scherzo-like second movement. The intriguing way he began the slow movement made it seem like it starts in the middle of some long melodic line. His approach set up the Adagio’s true theme, a wistful, elegiac melody for solo clarinet, played gorgeously by Anthony McGill, the Philharmonic’s principal clarinet. The account of the finale captured all its headlong energy, music at once festive and frenzied. Mr. Bronfman has made news in recent years at the Philharmonic in the premieres of daunting concertos written for him by Esa-Pekka Salonen and Magnus Lindberg. There was plenty of sparkling passagework in his playing of Beethoven’s ebullient Second Concerto. But he seemed intent on highlighting the music’s reflective passages and poetic flights, especially in his dreamy account of the slow movement. It was a pleasure to hear such a lithe and refined account of Beethoven’s bracing concerto. Why it made sense to pair it with the Rachmaninoff symphony, though, I cannot say. "
5c44f58a3a125f5075c056a4,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/20/arts/music/review-cantata-profana.html,"Imagine a Renaissance-era nun, a mystic in the throes of dying, uttering her visions and predictions in sporadic, rapid-fire bursts while novices stand guard trying to understand and write down her words. This is believed to be what happened to Saint Maria Maddalena de’ Pazzi, who died in Florence in 1607. The Italian modernist composer Salvatore Sciarrino suggests what the extraordinary ritual must have been like in his hushed, twitchy and radically spare-textured “Infinito Nero: Estasi di un Atto” for soprano and eight instruments, composed in 1998. The excellent and adventurous young musicians of Cantata Profana gave a rare and quietly riveting performance of Mr. Sciarrino’s strange piece on Friday at St. Peter’s Church in Chelsea. Since 2013, Cantata Profana has been presenting shows, as they call them, which are often semi-staged and typically juxtapose very old and very new music. The players placed Mr. Sciarrino’s piece at the end of an 80-minute meditative show they titled “Visions of Silence.” To set the mood, the pianist Daniel Schlosberg played Alvin Lucier’s Music for Piano and Amplified Sonorous Vessels (1990), a piece in which intermittent, mostly soft, minimal piano sounds (single struck tones or intervals, wandering chords, fleeting squiggles of notes) are electronically refracted, prolonged or processed. This led to a Tarquinio Merula canzonetta for soprano and lute. In this short 1636 duo, the Virgin Mary (soprano Alice Teyssier) holds the baby Jesus in her arms, trying to get the restless infant to sleep, though she is overcome with premonitions of the suffering that awaits him. The lute (played by the fine Arash Noori) is curiously fixated on two notes, though these recurring pitches are often decorated with filigree. Next came the Russian composer Galina Ustvolskaya’s radically unconventional Symphony No. 5, “Amen” (1989), lasting just 15 minutes and scored for a curious ensemble: violin, oboe, trumpet, tuba, big wooden box and a speaker (Gleb Kanasevich), who says the Lord’s Prayer in Russian. The music is at once grave and grumpy, utterly serious and almost comic, swinging along in a foursquare meter like some slow march with a steady tread, each thematic note encrusted in a dour harmonic block. Then Mr. Noori returned to play Alessandro Piccinini’s “Toccata Cromatica” for solo lute (1623), a work in which lyrical strands spin out into soft-spoken swirling passagework. Ms. Teyssier was the compelling soloist, singing Maria Maddalena, in the Sciarrino piece, which over 30 taut minutes tries to evoke the scene of the mystic nun issuing her clipped bursts of words. The instrumentalists become her eight attentive novices, sitting for long stretches doing nothing, or just breathing in anticipation (the sounds of, say, a flutist playing a short tone then audibly inhaling), or sometimes muttering some jittery, quiet mini-phrase. Then Ms. Teyssier’s Maria would sing a frenzied burst of pent-up notes, and the instruments would scurry, trying to scribble down her words. Jacob Ashworth, Cantata Profana’s artistic director, conducted a suspenseful account of this radically episodic and spacey score. The audience in pews sat in almost complete darkness; the players were illuminated by theatrical lighting, so you had to give yourself over to this contemplative program, even when you could not read the translations of texts, even if you lost track of what piece was being played. A large and appreciative audience seemed ready to do so on a chilly Friday in a Chelsea sanctuary. "

A-TRAK at Marquee (March 22, 11 p.m.). A touring D.J. for Kanye West in the early 2000s, this Canadian turntablist quickly graduated from trusted collaborator to label boss: In 2007, he co-founded Fool’s Gold, a Brooklyn-based record company that has championed artists like Danny Brown and Kid Cudi. He has also released his own work through the label, including 2016’s “In the Loop: A Decade of Remixes,” a box set compiling a selection of his 200-plus credited remixes (most notably, his version of “Heads Will Roll” by the Yeah Yeah Yeahs). A-Trak celebrates his birthday with a guest set at this trendy West Chelsea nightclub. 646-473-0202, marqueeny.com MARIAH CAREY at Radio City Music Hall (March 25, 8 p.m.). Since the early 1990s, this powerhouse has put the full might of her five-octave voice behind radio hits that straddle genres, from the honeyed daze of “Always Be My Baby” to the hip-hop flair of her “Fantasy” remix featuring Ol’ Dirty Bastard. Currently, Carey is on the road touring her 15th studio album, “Caution” — a record graced by collaborators like Ty Dolla Sign and Dev Hynes. It prioritizes a more subdued, of-the-moment R&B sound over the vocal theatrics for which Carey is known. Still, expect the singer to dust off the showstoppers for her hometown crowd.  212-465-6000, radiocity.com FLOHIO at Baby’s All Right (March 22, 8 p.m.). This Nigeria-born, British-bred rapper makes her way to Brooklyn this weekend to perform hard-charging songs that draw together elements of grime, trap and techno. An energetic M.C., Flohio — whose given name is Funmi Ohiosuma — floods her music with a brashness that she attributes to her South London upbringing. Ohiosuma recently told The Guardian, “Rap isn’t meant to be too happy; there’s meant to be grit in there.” That attitude guides her recent EP, “Wild Yout,” on which she touts her authenticity and taunts her detractors. Released in November, it was the culminating effort of her breakout year. 718-599-5800, babysallright.com JOSÉ GONZÁLEZ at the Apollo Theater (March 21-22, 8 p.m.). In his solo work, this Swedish-Argentinian songwriter is a practiced minimalist, painting pictures with just his fingerpicked guitar and soft vocals. But González transforms in the company of collaborators. His sound expands whether he’s recording with the folk-rock group Junip or touring with the String Theory, an experimental orchestra from Berlin and Gothenburg with whom he released a live album last month. The String Theory will join him for his two-night run at the Apollo, performing new arrangements of songs from González’s three solo albums. 212-531-5305, apollotheater.org [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] KAIA KATER AND KARINE POLWART at Carnegie Hall (March 23, 9 p.m.). This double bill showcases a range of folk traditions, embraced by two distinctly contemporary artists. For Quebec-born Kater, the Canadian folk songs of her childhood and the Appalachian music she studied while attending college in West Virginia serve as touchstones; Polwart, meanwhile, draws from the musical heritage of her native Scotland. The noted political dimension in the songwriting of both women makes this a natural pairing: Kater has sung about the Black Lives Matter movement and political strife in her father’s home country of Grenada, and Polwart’s 2018 album, “Laws of Motion,” addresses Trumpism and the experiences of migrants. 212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org TORRES at Le Poisson Rouge (March 22, 8 p.m.). In the six years since she released her debut album, the Brooklyn-based singer Mackenzie Scott (a.k.a. Torres) has made the journey from quiet, confessional songwriter to adventurous, often boisterous rocker. On her most recent album, 2017’s “Three Futures,” Scott textured her guitar work with industrial and electronic sounds, aiming to create something that engaged all five senses. For her show at this Manhattan multimedia club, expect sensory engagement, beginning with her ritual preshow burning of palo santo sticks. Annie Hart, of the trio Au Revoir Simone, will open, setting the stage with lush, synth-driven pop songs. lpr.comOLIVIA HORN ALTERNATIVE GUITAR SUMMIT at various locations (March 21, 25 and 27-28, 7:30 p.m.). Organized by the guitarist Joel Harrison, the annual Alternative Guitar Summit gathers some of the most talented six-string improvisers in jazz, post-rock and world music. This year’s festival begins on Thursday with a 50th-anniversary celebration of the music of Woodstock, at Le Poisson Rouge in Greenwich Village. Harrison will play music from the Richie Havens and the Grateful Dead songbooks alongside the Everett Bradley Choir. The guitarist Ben Monder and the vocalist Jo Lawry will collaborate on music by John Sebastian and the Band. And the guitarist Nels Cline, who’s best known for his work in Wilco, will revisit Santana’s iconic Woodstock performance. The summit’s second concert takes place on Monday, when Cline, Leni Stern and others will pay tribute to the esteemed guitarist (and multi-instrumentalist) Ralph Towner at Drom, in the East Village. It concludes on Wednesday and Thursday at Jazz Standard with solo shows from Towner himself. (On the last two nights, there will be second sets at 9:30 p.m.) alternativeguitarsummit.com AARON DIEHL TRIO at the Baruch Performing Arts Center (March 28, 8 p.m.). Diehl’s piano playing has the same courtly, dapper flare as his wardrobe (he’s usually attired in a crisp, dark suit, sometimes topped off with a pair of thick-framed glasses). Picking up the mantle of midcentury greats like Bud Powell, Barry Harris and Cedar Walton, he espouses the ideal of jazz as America’s classical music, whether he’s performing standards or his own neo-traditionalist compositions. He may be best known for his work alongside Cécile McLorin Salvant, an eminent young vocalist, but at Baruch the spotlight will fall squarely on Diehl and his trio, which features the bassist David Wong and the drummer Aaron Kimmel. They will be playing music from his most recent album, “Space, Time, Continuum,” as well as some new pieces.212-352-3101, baruch.cuny.edu/bpac FIRE! AND MADALYN MERKEY at the Clemente Soto Vélez Cultural Center (March 28, 8 p.m.). The tenor saxophonist Mats Gustafsson, one of Europe’s most uncompromising free improvisers, angles toward the void in Fire!, a trio that includes the bassist Johan Berthling and the drummer Andreas Werliin. Whether scrawling an illegible smear of notes across the top of a pounding beat or erupting in fury as the rhythm dissolves beneath him, Gustafsson keeps the intensity high and your ears alight — even when his tone skews murky and dark. Fire! shares the bill here with Merkey, whose semi-ambient electronic music guides listeners into a kind of dreamlike state. This concert — Fire!’s first ever in New York — is presented by the nonprofit organization Blank Forms.blankforms.org DEREK GRIPPER at Roulette (March 23, 8 p.m.). Gripper, a South African guitarist, has developed a virtuoso approach to playing Malian music that was originally composed for instruments such as the kora (a 21-string instrument, somewhere between a harp and a guitar) and the ngoni (a possible progenitor of the banjo). He fingerpicks his classical guitar in percussive swirls, producing a sound that’s as enlivening as it is hypnotic. His repertoire includes music by the kora master Toumani Diabaté and the guitarist Ali Farka Touré, as well as folk songs from South Africa’s Western Cape. This concert kicks off the fifth annual A World in Trance festival, which spotlights music from around the world with explicitly spiritual overtones.917-267-0368, roulette.org MANUEL VALERA AND THE NEW CUBAN EXPRESS BIG BAND at Terraza 7 (March 28, 9 p.m.). Valera, a Cuban-born pianist with a blazingly fluent right hand and a mellifluous compositional style, has long led the New Cuban Express, a midsize band that integrates elements of contemporary New York jazz with Afro-Cuban forms. On Thursday he will premiere a big-band iteration of the ensemble, featuring the vocalist Sofía Rei and the alto saxophonist Román Filiú, plus 16 other instrumentalists.347-808-0518, terraza7.com WEBBER/MORRIS BIG BAND at the Jazz Gallery (March 22, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). The tenor saxophonist and flutist Anna Webber recently put out “Clockwise,” an album full of atonality and friction and discomfited momentum — not to mention, some of New York’s premier improvising musicians. Angela Morris, a fellow saxophonist, shares some of Webber’s style, while also drawing more heavily on the influence of Impressionist composers and jazz’s most ancient styles. They have been playing their ambitious original compositions in this big band for a few years, and supposedly there’s an album on the way — but so far all we have to show for it are a few YouTube clips and a bit of buzz on the scene. To really hear the Webber/Morris Big Band, you’ve got to go in person.646-494-3625, jazzgallery.nyc GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO "
5c6079b13a125f5075c08f84,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/10/arts/music/review-trifonov-recital.html,"By this point, it’s no surprise that Daniil Trifonov, one of the most awesome pianists of our time, can sell out Carnegie Hall. Still, that the hall was packed for the unusual recital program he played on Saturday was a testimony to the trust his admirers place in him. At 27, he is also an adventurer intent on exploring overlooked realms of the repertory. On Saturday it was thrilling to go along on his journey. (A video of the recital is available for viewing on medici.tv, which carried the performance live.) During the first half, lasting some 70 minutes with minimal breaks between pieces, Mr. Trifonov focused mostly on neglected — you might say orphaned — works by Beethoven and Schumann. He began with Beethoven’s “Andante Favori,” a lilting, lyrical yet elusive piece, and the original slow movement of Beethoven’s mighty “Waldstein” Sonata. The composer was persuaded by a colleague to publish this nine-minute andante separately. (For the “Waldstein,” he substituted a short, stark Adagio that serves almost as a transition between two monumental outer movements.) The “Andante Favori,” a rarity in concert, unfolds like a rondo. A beguiling theme keeps returning in more elaborate statements, with dramatic detours into contrasting sections, all qualities that Mr. Trifonov brought out in a subtle, nuanced and delicately articulate performance. Without a break, he then played Beethoven’s Sonata No. 18 in E-flat, a joyous, sometimes prankish piece that you don’t hear too often. Mr. Trifonov’s performance was so impetuous and slyly charming that the sonata came across with striking freshness: It could have been a four-movement improvisation. Then he turned to Schumann’s “Bunte Blätter” (Colored Leaves), a real curiosity. The 14 motley pieces of this publication, composed over 13 years, are mostly short, fantastical and quirky. One, titled “Albumblätter II,” is an onrushing frenzy of spiraling runs. “Novellette” is like some eerily relentless march. Yet there is no overall structure to Schumann’s compilation. This was the first time I’d heard them performed complete. While lavishing colorful, dazzling and imaginative playing on each piece, Mr. Trifonov managed to make “Bunte Blätter” seem like a 30-minute, brashly episodic yet dramatically urgent entity. Then he segued right into Schumann’s “Presto Passionato,” a near-crazed, six-minute whirlwind that the composer had written as the original finale to his Sonata in G minor. Clara Schumann talked him into writing a more understandable, less extreme final movement, which he did. This rejected, hellbent presto has mostly languished ever since. Mr. Trifonov dispatched the score’s tangles of passagework and breathless flights in a performance that balanced fearless command and wildness. I hope someday to hear him play that Schumann sonata with this original finale. After intermission he played a single 30-minute piece: Prokofiev’s Sonata No. 8 in B-flat. This program may have officially lacked a new or recent work, though Mr. Trifonov, also a composer, has hardly shirked contemporary music, especially during his Perspectives series last season at Carnegie. Yet, by giving Prokofiev’s Eighth such a prominent place on this program, in such a powerful, searching performance, he made the sonata seem audaciously modern. I especially loved the slightly dangerous quality he drew from the slow movement, which here sounded deceptively beguiling. He tore through the manic concluding movement, his playing exhilarating one moment, terrifying the next. Though this recital was a workout, Mr. Trifonov had enough stamina for encores: two of Prokofiev’s raw, pummeling “Sarcasms,” and a beautiful account of an arrangement of the slow movement from Chopin’s Cello Sonata.

5c97d50849f0eacbf105ec89,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/24/arts/music/review-leon-botstein-american-symphony-orchestra-carnegie-hall.html,"“Julietta,” a 1930s opera by the Czech composer Bohuslav Martinu, has long been a rarity outside the composer’s homeland. One problem may be the surreal story. The residents of an isolated coastal town have no memories of anything before the present moment. Whenever strangers show up, which isn’t often, they are forced to tell the townspeople their stories; appropriating someone else’s memories is at least better than having none. But, of course, those stories are soon forgotten. Then Michel, a bookseller from Paris, arrives in search of a girl he’d heard singing three years earlier. Her voice has haunted him since. The work was an auspicious success at its 1938 premiere in Prague. But, beyond its convoluted plot, the score, for all its harmonic lushness and myriad colorings, has been deemed frustratingly episodic and stylistically eclectic. Leon Botstein, the conductor and tireless champion of overlooked works, considers “Julietta” an operatic masterpiece that at least deserves a place in the repertory. On Friday at Carnegie Hall, he  made his case by leading a winning cast and the American Symphony Orchestra in a vibrant concert performance. Martinu (1890-1959) is best known today for his orchestral works. But during his career, which took him to Paris between the two world wars and, in 1941, to the United States, he was absorbed by opera, including experimental works incorporating film. He adapted a Czech libretto for “Julietta” from a French play (subtitled “The Key of Dreams”) by Georges Neveux, who pronounced the opera superior to his play. Given the popularity of television dramas and films steeped in phantasmagoria and creepiness, “Julietta” could fit our cultural moment. The opera’s engrossing mix of bleak humor and Kafkaesque confusion starts in the opening scene, when Michel (the tenor Aaron Blake) encounters a young boy who accuses him of making things up. The stranger’s arrival soon has residents abuzz during a bustling scene at a market. A police chief, impressed with Michel’s memory, declares him the new town captain. Before long, though, the chief forgets this pronouncement, as well as his own position. Martinu’s musical language is a hybrid. There are nods to the Czech heritage of Dvorak and Smetana. During hazy, atmospheric passages you hear echoes of Debussy. Scenes alive with pulsing frenzy recall the Stravinsky of “Petrushka” and “Les Noces.” Martinu’s vocal writing follows the cadences of the Czech words, even during romantic scenes that seem ripe for soaring melody. In the town, Michel finds the girl he’s been searching for, Julietta (the soprano Sara Jakubiak). When she first sees him, she thinks her beloved, having sailed away, has finally returned. But they have never really been together, Michel tries to explain. Julietta’s fraught vocal lines here almost take off into stretches of radiant lyricism buffeted by plush orchestral sonorities. Yet, like her memory, the melodies are short-lived. The opera comes to a climax in Act II when Julietta, looking at postcards from a memory vendor, imagines the sojourns she and Michel have shared. This just provokes Michel to wrenching despair and, finally, fury. The orchestra does the heavy lifting in advancing the drama, including during many stretches of spoken dialogue, accompanied by a few solo instruments or a florid piano, or, at times, skittish symphonic bursts. Act III shifts to a Central Bureau of Dreams, where an official explains to Michel that he has just been dreaming. So it’s all a dream? I found this revelation too pat. And it comes fairly late in a long score (nearly three hours of music) that sometimes feels inflated Mr. Blake — an endearing and sweet-sounding Michel, sung with youthful fervor and stamina — led an excellent cast. Ms. Jakubiak brought a rich, earthy, expressive voice and disarming vulnerability to Julietta. The robust tenor David Cangelosi doubled as the police chief and the clerk. Other versatile cast members also sang multiple smaller roles, including Alfred Walker as the memory vendor and a mysterious man in a helmet; Rebecca Jo Loeb as the young boy and a bellhop; and Tichina Vaughn as an ominous palm reader who tells of the past rather than predicting the future. I hope these dedicated singers get a chance to perform their roles again. Mr. Botstein has done his part by bringing a worthy and original opera to attention. "

For the better part of a century, this decorated singer from Astoria, Queens, has championed the great American songbook, bewitching audiences with renditions of pop and jazz standards by Cole Porter, Irving Berlin and others. More recently, the 20-time Grammy Award winner introduced himself to younger generations with a series of “Duets” albums, on which he sang alongside contemporary artists like Lady Gaga, John Legend and Amy Winehouse. Bennett still actively tours at the age of 92 and, per the title of his most recent book, is “just getting started.”212-465-6000, radiocity.com LAURA JANE GRACE & THE DEVOURING MOTHERS at Bowery Ballroom (April 18, 7 p.m.). This trio is a side project of Grace’s, whose work as the frontwoman of the Florida punk band Against Me! has highlighted her experiences as a transgender woman, particularly on albums like “Transgender Dysphoria Blues” and “Shape Shift With Me.” Alongside her Devouring Mothers — the drummer Atom Willard (also in Against Me!) and the bassist Marc Jacob Hudson — Grace writes more restrained songs that retain hints of her punkish invective. At this Lower East Side club, the trio will receive support from the New Jersey-based rock group Mercy Union and the Philadelphia-based noise-punk band Control Top. 212-260-4700, mercuryeastpresents.com ‘LIVE FROM HERE’ at the Town Hall (April 13, 5:45 p.m.). The mandolinist Chris Thile had already taken over hosting duties on the weekly radio variety show “A Prairie Home Companion” before its original host, Garrison Keillor, fell from grace. This rebranded program, like its predecessor, is recorded before a live audience, often traveling from its home base in St. Paul to theaters around the country. Among the guests at this week’s taping in Midtown is Sara Bareilles, the pop singer behind radio hits like “Love Song” and  “King of Anything.” She shares the bill with the folk duo Milk Carton Kids and the comedian Aparna Nancherla. 212-997-6661, thetownhall.org NATALIE PRASS at Bowery Ballroom (April 17, 8 p.m.). As this singer-songwriter from Richmond, Va., knows, creating art with a political point of view can be risky. Her second album, last year’s “The Future and the Past,” was written largely in response to the 2016 presidential election; finding a label willing to release it took her longer than she had hoped. In the past year, Prass has toured the album tirelessly, as both a headliner and a supporting artist on Kacey Musgraves’s “Oh, What a World” Tour. On this stop, she’ll perform funk-flavored pop songs like “Oh My” and “Short Court Style,” as well as more orchestral holdovers from her 2015 debut. 212-260-4700, mercuryeastpresents.com [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] PRETTY LOU’S THIRD ANNUAL CHARITY CONCERT at Irving Plaza (April 16, 6 p.m.). The New York hip-hop community rallied around the Brooklyn-based D.J., nightlife personality and Fat Joe affiliate Pretty Lou Ortega (not to be confused with the member of the 1990s rap group Lost Boyz, whose moniker he shares) after he learned he had the rare blood condition aplastic anemia, which has since developed into leukemia. In its third year, this annual showcase benefiting leukemia and A.L.S. research will feature Fat Joe and his fellow Terror Squad member Remy Ma, as well as Raekwon and Ghostface Killah of the Wu-Tang Clan, the Diplomats and others. 212-777-6800, mercuryeastpresents.com PRIESTS at Elsewhere (April 16, 8 p.m.). The members of this trio from Washington have long pushed back on the “political punk” label that critics often affix to their work; still, how they earned it is clear. The debut record from these firebrands is colored by brash guitars and the muscular vocals of their frontwoman, Katie Alice Greer, whose lyrics broach subjects like consumerism and free will. Riffing on the name of Thomas Frank’s 2004 book on the rise of populist conservatism, Priests titled their just-released follow-up “The Seduction of Kansas.” This album is similarly concerned with American politics and identity; this time, though, their sound is more polished. elsewherebrooklyn.comOLIVIA HORN EMMET COHEN TRIO at Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola (April 16, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). Cohen, 28, has a breezy, phlegmatic command at the keyboard, and a deep well of historical jazz references at his fingertips. He has worked as a side musician for such luminaries as Christian McBride and Herlin Riley, and has recorded with the elder statesmen Ron Carter and Jimmy Cobb. If he wasn’t already an obvious heir apparent to the neo-traditional jazz mantle, his win at last weekend’s 2019 American Pianists Awards ought to make it official. At Dizzy’s, he will be joined by the bassist Philip Norris and the drummer Kyle Poole.

The crossbreeding of classical and jazz has a long history, stretching back to the Third Stream movement of the 1960s. And new approaches to this amalgam have been thick on the ground of late: Just try to count how many young jazz musicians are writing for string quartet these days. One of the boldest thinkers and most delightful composers in this vein is Hazama, who studied Western classical music in Japan before making the jump to jazz. Her chamber orchestra, m_unit, blends strings and horns and mallet percussion in service of her resplendent, highly singable compositions. At the Standard, the group will be playing selections from the recently released “Dancer in Nowhere.”212-576-2232, jazzstandard.com BEN MONDER, TONY MALABY AND TOM RAINEY at Public Records (April 17, 8 p.m.).

Ross, a guitarist best known for his work in the jazz-rock power trio Harriet Tubman, doesn’t just play a slew of different instruments (banjo, soprano guitar, regular old electric guitar, etc.), he also ranges freely from sweet and lyrical playing to wavy, confrontational distortion. Phantom Station is not a band; it’s an opportunity for him to embrace his proclivity for newness and change. He performs under this name with a wide variety of collaborators and formations. On Friday, the ensemble will include Graham Haynes on cornet and electronics, J. T. Lewis (also a member of Harriet Tubman) on drums and Hardedge on sound design. 646-494-3625, jazzgallery.nyc STRETCH MUSIC FESTIVAL at Harlem Stage Gatehouse (April 12, 7:30 p.m.). The trumpeter Christian Scott aTunde Adjuah is about to close the book on a three-year residency at Harlem Stage. As part of that, since 2017 he has convened an annual Stretch Music Festival, comprising educational events, discussions of art and activism, and performances. (The event’s title is a reference to the way Scott refers to his own music; it’s an effort to wriggle free from the limitations of genre.) He is coming off the release last month of “Ancestral Recall,” an impressive album on which West African-derived rhythms and whispery synthesizers fortify his bristling trumpet playing and the strident, subversive poetry of Saul Williams. Friday’s festival will include performances by Scott, the saxophonist Logan Richardson and Freelance, a band that fuses contemporary R&B with backpacker hip-hop and jazz.212-281-9240, harlemstage.org JOHN ZORN’S NEW MASADA QUARTET at the Village Vanguard (April 14, 3 p.m.). Last year, Zorn, the eminent alto saxophonist and downtown arts organizer, released “The Book Beriah,” the final portion of his 613-song epic, “Masada,” a collection of experimental, often lovely compositions based in Jewish folk song, klezmer and free jazz (613 is the number of commandments, or mitzvot, in the Torah). As is the wont of this serial collaborator, Zorn featured a different ensemble on each of “Beriah’s” 10 CDs (11, including the bonus disc). Here he plays material from “Masada” in a new quartet featuring three talented improvisers: Julian Lage on guitar, Jorge Roeder on bass and Kenny Wollesen on drums. 212-255-4037, villagevanguard.comGIOVANNI RUSSONELLO "
5c3381353a125f5075c03311,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/07/arts/music/benjamin-appl-park-avenue-armory-schubert.html,"The Park Avenue Armory must really want you to know who Benjamin Appl is. Otherwise it wouldn’t have given such significant real estate — three concerts, three Schubert masterworks — to Mr. Appl, a 36-year-old baritone who, with these performances, is making his American recital debut. His concerts at the Armory’s intimate Board of Officers Room, which began with Schubert’s “Die Schöne Müllerin” on Sunday and continue with the composer’s “Schwanengesang” on Tuesday and “Winterreise” on Thursday, remind me of the pianist Igor Levit’s debut there in 2014. Mr. Levit made an entrance by daring to program Beethoven’s final sonatas; Mr. Appl has chosen some of the most well known, and revealing, works in the art-song repertory. And like Mr. Levit, who pulled off his American entree with confidence and preternatural maturity, Mr. Appl presented a masterly account of “Die Schöne Müllerin.” He had the exacting attention to text of an actor, the charisma of a seasoned storyteller and an agile voice that, while not fully formed, shows promise not only for this week’s remaining concerts, but also for what I hope to be more appearances here in the years ahead. Mr. Appl, born in Germany and based in London, comes much-hyped from Europe, as one of the last private students of the lieder master Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau and the recipient of emerging artist awards, as well as honors for his first album with Sony Classical, “Heimat,” in 2017. He performs with the pianist James Baillieu, who on Sunday maintained clarity and avoided the muddle that often comes with “Die Schöne Müllerin” when it is transposed lower for the baritone voice. (The piece is written for a tenor’s range.) With text by the poet Wilhelm Müller, Schubert’s song cycle — which has the dramatic breadth of theater, and a vast melodic language — tells the story of a sensitive young miller who falls in love with the beautiful miller maid of the title, but is consumed by jealousy and, lost in his dark thoughts, drowns himself in a brook. The youthful Mr. Appl, with wide eyes and animated dimples, looked every bit the part of Müller’s Romantic hero. Over the course of the 70-minute performance his face increasingly shined with sweat and his sculpted hair lost its shape, a serendipitous parallel with the miller’s descent into histrionics. Yet he wasn’t overly dramatic. For the most part, Mr. Appl gave a direct reading of the piece, restrained and sublime in the final “Des Baches Wiegenlied,” and rationing theatrical moments for maximum effect: the unbridled joy of “Mein!,” the breathless rage of “Der Jäger,” the disturbing turn toward madness of “Am Feierabend.” That song — “Am Feierabend,” in which the miller is upset that his crush said good night to everyone, not to him only — showcased Mr. Appl’s greatest talents as a performer, yet revealed where he still has room to grow. His voice’s warmth didn’t quiet carry to the top of his range, and one outburst verged on barking. But the way he navigated the song’s transformation, from disappointment to obsession, was so gripping and troublingly real, I heard people all around me exhale afterward, as if Mr. Appl had rendered them breathless. "
5cb34b5349f0eacbf1f83ef2,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/14/theater/charlie-rosen-broadway.html,"In a recording studio in Williamsburg, Brooklyn last month, where wood paneling on the walls and ceiling gave off the faint scent of pine, Charlie Rosen stood in front of 17 fellow musicians, smiling. Chiefly known for his work on Broadway, Mr. Rosen bopped along to the music, baton comfortably in hand, while the ensemble played the score of a Nintendo racecar game. With a TV on mute providing cues, he and his 8-Bit Big Band were recording the music from Mario Kart 64, blown way out with 36 instruments, including saxophones, trumpets, trombones, 11 violins, three cellos and a harp. “You got everything we need for that section?” he asked his engineer. “Great. Let’s move on to Level 3.” At 28, Mr. Rosen is an orchestrator, composer and arranger with his hands in many musical cookie jars. He is the music supervisor and orchestrator for Broadway’s “Be More Chill,” a show for which he also plays guitar in the pit. He has one big band devoted to video game songs and another devoted to theater music, which will perform at Feinstein’s/54 Below on Monday. Mr. Rosen also produces commercial soundtracks for the skin care company Olay out of his tiny home office in Harlem, where he stashes 52 instruments in a 9-foot-by-10-foot room that overlooks a quiet side street. There’s a melodica, a flugelbone, a zither and a theremin, which makes the ooo-oo-ooo sound from old sci-fi movies and is played by waving your hands around in the air. If you count what he calls his “toys” — like harmonicas, tambourines and a kalimba — Mr. Rosen has 70 instruments at home. He can play them all. “That’s insane,” he said after counting. “I’m insane.” This collection represents more than a nifty party trick. Indeed, while he considers himself primarily a bass player, his facility with so many instruments is part of what makes him such a valuable orchestrator. “It’s kind of like cooking,” he added. “The more spices you’re familiar with, the more you can combine them to create new flavors in places you might not expect.” Once a year, he estimates, he’ll be working on piece of music and think, “You know what this needs? A bass melodica.” Mr. Rosen exists as a sort of bridge between genres and generations, embracing Broadway standards, pop songs and the music of Tetris. And all of it funnels into his work. Marc Shaiman, a Tony-winning theater and Oscar-nominated film composer, described Mr. Rosen as a big talent, but without the eccentricities that sometimes come along for the ride. “It’s the kind of talent where I almost want to hate him,” Mr. Shaiman said. “But I can’t.” Jennifer Ashley Tepper, a producer on “Be More Chill” and the creative and programming director of Feinstein’s/54 Below, described him as a hub for young Broadway musicians, since, between his bands and the shows for which he hires, he employs so many of them. “He’s an unbelievably calm and steadying source,” Ms. Tepper said. “When you find out that a big press person is coming, or that something has fallen apart and we can’t put it back together, he’s the first person to be like, ‘O.K., let’s come up with a plan.’” Mr. Rosen, an easy-to-smile bundle of bearded energy, has lived in the same six-bedroom Harlem apartment since he was 22, with a rotating cast of roommates. His girlfriend, Danielle Gimbal, does the copy work for his music and is a frequent presence in his home and at recording sessions. Raised in Los Angeles, Mr. Rosen is the son of a classical bassoonist (his mother, who also plays flute, clarinet, piccolo and sax) and an organist (his father, who also plays guitar, banjo and accordion). A full sized Wurlitzer pipe organ, the kind from silent-movie houses, sat in his childhood home. [What’s new onstage and off: Sign up for our Theater Update newsletter] When he was 3, his parents noticed he could tell if a note played on the piano was white or black — he had perfect pitch. So he started on the piano, with his mother as his first teacher. He didn’t set out to work on Broadway. But as a 15-year-old jazz student at a performing arts high school, he auditioned to play in the pit for a regional production of the musical “13” — and off he went. He attended Berklee College of Music in Boston for four semesters, on and off between Broadway shows. He gravitated to courses he felt would help him professionally, like music production, arranging and Afro-Caribbean percussion. His main gigs now are playing guitar for “Be More Chill” — his instrument, dressed for the occasion, wears a brown hair bow on its headstock — and co-orchestrating the production of “Moulin Rouge!” scheduled to open on Broadway in July. (On the first day of performances for “Be More Chill,” he was told by his union’s new leadership that contract rules prohibited him, as the show’s orchestrator, from playing in the band, but he was put back in while the contract is being renegotiated.) Thanks to Mr. Rosen, “Be More Chill” features a theremin, which does its electronic ooo-oo-ooo thing when a mind-controlling super computer dies. There is also a flugelbone, which he described as his “orchestrating secret weapon”: It’s a horn that can be managed by a trumpet player but can sound sort of like a French horn or a trombone, which allows one musician to produce a variety of timbres for a small orchestra. Joe Iconis, who wrote the music and lyrics for “Be More Chill,” said Mr. Rosen’s ability to have so many instruments in his head, but also so many different kinds of music, both old and new, can give his work an air of “magic.” “His breadth of knowledge of music of all types is just intimidating,” Mr. Iconis said. “As much as he knows the synth sound that was used on the latest Ariana Grande record, he knows the model of trombone used in orchestration for ‘How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying.’” Mr. Rosen has lots of plans — he’d like to write music for video games, score a film, be commissioned by a major symphony orchestra to write a piece — but no particular endgame in mind, he said. He just wants to keep going. “You don’t get to be Charlie without being insanely ambitious,” said Jason Robert Brown, who was the composer and lyricist for “13” and has worked with Mr. Rosen on several concerts and shows since. “But I think it’s really an ambition to have as much music in his life and in his head and in his mouth as he possibly can. He just loves making music.” "

5c40b5c23a125f5075c04f3a,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/arts/music/philharmonia-baroque-richard-egarr.html,"Many orchestras pass their batons from one conductor to another. Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra, based in San Francisco and one of the country’s most respected period-instrument ensembles, will be passing its harpsichord, too. The orchestra announced on Thursday that its next music director would be the conductor (and harpsichordist) Richard Egarr, who will succeed the conductor (and harpsichordist) Nicholas McGegan, stepping down from the post in 2020, after 35 years. Mr. Egarr is currently the music director of the Academy of Ancient Music in Britain, where he took over from its founder, Christopher Hogwood, in 2006. He will step down from that post — where his tenure included performing Purcell’s “Dido and Aeneas” in Libya — in 2021. Mr. Egarr said in a telephone interview that he looks forward to leading the Philharmonia Baroque, which he has conducted three times since 2012 — and which he said that, for all its differences, also bore some resemblances to the Academy of Ancient Music. “What is similar is there is a very free spirit,” said Mr. Egarr, 55, who was born in Lincoln, England, and who now lives in Amsterdam with his family. He will begin in the 2020-21 season as music director designate, and officially assume the title the following season. Mr. Egarr said that he looked forward to exploring a wide array of repertoire — including early-17th-century works by composers including Monteverdi; Bach’s passions and B-minor Mass, which he said he would like to perform with the Philharmonia Chorale; and some Romantic pieces, such as Schumann’s Requiem, a rarity he recently led. “It has had terrible press ever since it was written,” he said, “but it’s actually a little masterpiece.” "
5c9526c349f0eacbf105e8c0,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/22/arts/matthias-goerne-philharmonic-review.html,"Some artists, even acclaimed ones, use a residency with a major orchestra to perform the works they are known for. Bolder artists seize these coveted opportunities to take chances and work closely with individual musicians in the orchestra, as the superb German baritone Matthias Goerne has done this season with the New York Philharmonic. Last Sunday Mr. Goerne took his artist-in-residence series to the 92nd Street Y, where he explored new dimensions in familiar Schubert songs by performing them in unusual arrangements for voice and strings, joined by members of the orchestra. Schubert’s gravely beautiful “Death and the Maiden” sounded Mahlerian and starkly ominous, with Mr. Goerne, his voice dark and expressive, backed by a string quartet and bass instead of a piano. The first half of this program involved nearly an hour of concentrated singing for the tireless Mr. Goerne, including an intense rendition of Hanns Eisler’s rightly named “Ernste Gesänge” (“Serious Songs”), an autumnal 1962 cycle. And in several songs by Schubert, Schumann and Brahms, Mr. Goerne’s exemplary young accompanist was, no less, Daniil Trifonov, who played beautifully. For the last program of his residency, on Thursday at David Geffen Hall, Mr. Goerne sang a work that involved a different kind of risk: John Adams’s “The Wound-Dresser,” with Jaap van Zweden leading the Philharmonic. This poignant 1988 piece for baritone and orchestra sets passages from a poem by Walt Whitman about his experience nursing wounded soldiers during the Civil War in makeshift hospitals on the outskirts of Washington, D.C. The piece was written for Sanford Sylvan, the beloved American baritone who died in January. Mr. Sylvan “made our American language a thing of beauty every time he sang it,” Mr. Adams wrote in tribute to Mr. Sylvan at the time. A singer performing “The Wound-Dresser” must be able to convey the cadences and rhythms of the American language, no less so in Whitman’s elegantly poetic words. Mr. Goerne sang the texts with clarity, empathy and nuance, though, understandably, with traces of a German accent. Some of his delivery lacked crisp articulation. No matter. His performance was magnificent, in part because a great German artist was embracing a distinctively American piece and, in doing so, conveyed its universal resonances. When Mr. Goerne sang of the daily drudgery at the hospital, “Bearing the bandages, water, and sponge,” his voice was somber and earthy. But in moments when the poet is overcome with idealized love for the maimed soldiers (“One turns to me his appealing eyes — poor boy! I never knew you.”), Mr. Goerne sang with plaintive tenderness, lifting phrases into the light upper reaches of his voice. In the opening section, beautifully rendered by Mr. van Zweden and the orchestra, Mr. Goerne’s singing of Whitman’s spare-no-details descriptions of bloody soldiers soared over a backdrop of strings playing steady, swaying chords, music at once numbing and celestial. It was a great idea to precede this work with another distinctively American piece: Ives’s “Central Park in the Dark,” in which soft cluster chords in the strings suggest the hazy summer nighttime in the park as sounds of whistled tunes, ragtime pianos from apartment windows and more intrude. After intermission Mr. van Zweden led an emphatic, well-played account of Brahms’s First Symphony. Yet the Brahms work echoed back to the concert at the 92nd Street Y, which concluded with the violinist Frank Huang and the cellist Carter Brey (both principals with the Philharmonic) and Mr. Trifonov in a majestic yet impetuous account of Brahms’s Piano Trio No. 1. You could say that Mr. Goerne was somewhat responsible for this exhilarating trio performance, since it was a significant part of his thoughtful residency. "
5c6f1fbf3a125f5075c0ae42,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/arts/music/nyc-this-weekend-pop-rock-jazz.html,"Our guide to pop and rock shows and the best of live jazz happening this weekend and in the week ahead. LIZ COOPER & THE STAMPEDE at Rough Trade (Feb. 27, 9 p.m.). This lilting Nashville rock trio gives new meaning to the label “easy listening” with their tempered, dreamy psychedelia. Gentle grooves and softly arpeggiated guitars take the place of sprawling, climactic jams, yet their songwriting is taut enough that the audience is never in danger of being lulled to sleep. The band has made refining their live show a priority, touring their songs for three years — including as support for Bermuda Triangle, the side project of the Alabama Shakes frontwoman Brittany Howard — before heading into the studio. Their 2018 debut, “Window Flowers,” is summery and bright, well suited to mitigating New York’s winter chill.718-388-4111, roughtradenyc.com THE DREAM at the Bowery Ballroom (Feb. 26, 8 p.m.). Praising this producer, singer and songwriter for fidelity to his artistic vision might seem odd. After all, he is responsible for some of the biggest pop hits of the past 15 years, including Rihanna’s “Umbrella” and Beyoncé’s “Single Ladies.” In his work as a solo artist, though, the Dream remains steadfast in his commitment to achingly slow, explicitly bedroom-ready R&B jams. Combining his high, often-AutoTuned voice with layers of synths and understated beats, he has made himself into a new model of R&B maestro. 212-260-4700, boweryballroom.com JULIA HOLTER at Warsaw (Feb. 22, 9 p.m.). To call Holter a singer-songwriter feels reductive, given the wide-ranging abstract soundscapes she creates with a nearly endless array of instruments and electronic tools. In her compositions, this California native finds common ground between the baroque and the futuristic, the ancient (her latest album, “Aviary,” includes a musical interpretation of a poem by Sappho) and the modern (another track was inspired by Alice Coltrane’s “Universal Consciousness”). The one thing listeners won’t find in Holter’s music is compromise: It’s about as unusual and boundary pushing as anything labeled pop music can get, and all the more exciting for it. 212-777-6800, warsawconcerts.com JOHN MELLENCAMP at the Beacon Theater (Feb. 25-27, 8 p.m.). This legendary rock singer and songwriter is best known for his ability to capture the heartland — as he describes in his biggest hit, “Jack & Diane” — in accessible, catchy songs. But since his 1980s heyday, Mellencamp has shed most of the trappings of commercial rock (including his myriad stage names) in favor of more straightforward blues arrangements courtesy of the super-producer T Bone Burnett. For his latest album, 2018’s “Other People’s Stuff,” Mellencamp produces and performs, revisiting a number of covers he had previously recorded in the rootsy style that is now his signature.212-465-6000, beacontheatre.com SON LITTLE at BRIC House Ballroom (Feb. 28, 8 p.m.). The folksy blues put forth by this Philadelphia-based singer-songwriter, who has also written songs for Mavis Staples and collaborated with the Roots, can be intimate, acoustic and mostly unadorned, or up-tempo and groovy, as it is on his most recent album “New Magic.” A deep understanding of classic American roots music ties his records together, lending them old-school credibility even as the occasional unorthodox production choice gives his work a contemporary feel. The Canadian singer-songwriter Melissa Laveaux and the folk singer Christopher Paul Stelling open. 718-683-5600, bricartsmedia.org SON LUX at the Appel Room (Feb. 28, 8:30 p.m.). The art music composer Ryan Lott, the experimental drummer and percussionist Ian Chang and the jazz-schooled guitarist Rafiq Bhatia have forged their talents to create airy, unconventional pop under the name Son Lux. Incredibly active as soloists, these artists channel their more esoteric skills into this project, which attracts alternative rock and electronic music audiences as well as aficionados of contemporary composition. In 2018, the trio released their fifth album, “Brighter Wounds,” which puts seemingly incongruous sounds — like screeching, dissonant strings and bluesy guitar riffs — adjacent to one another for a compelling, unpredictable result.212-721-6500, lincolncenter.orgNATALIE WEINER BRITTANY ANJOU at Le Poisson Rouge (Feb. 25, 8 p.m.). This pianist just released “Enamigo Reciprokataj,” a debut album with a double meaning: Translated from Esperanto, its title can mean “Reciprocal Love” or “Mutual Breakdown.” It makes sense that Anjou would speak in double-entendre, in a language that’s at once universal and abstruse. The album is full of broadly sourced melodies that are bright and lyrical and quick, and work by their own clever logic. (She has studied jazz in New York, Western classical in Prague, and gyil music in Ghana; she’s currently an artist in residence at Kuwait’s Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad Cultural Center opera house.) Anjou celebrates the release of “Enamigo Reciprokataj” with Greg Chudzik on bass and Shirazette Tinnin on drums. The bassist Ari Folman-Cohen will participate as a special guest.212-505-3474, lpr.com BRENT BIRCKHEAD at Nublu 151 (Feb. 22, 8 p.m.). When he’s not on the road with Lauryn Hill’s band, this alto saxophonist is often found in the basement of Smalls, partaking of late-night jam sessions with other young jazz improvisers. Struck with bluesy warmth and the relentless swing of Cannonball Adderley, Birckhead’s playing has lately established him as one of the most riveting young improvisers in New York. On his impressive debut album, “Birckhead,” his R&B sojourns and his straight-ahead jazz background come to bear, resulting in a sound that skates the divide between svelte swagger and cutting passion. The record finds the young bandleader meditating on romance, personal growth and the travails of his native Baltimore; he will celebrate its release at Nublu with Corey Wallace on trombone, Marc Cary on piano, Jon Michel on bass and Curtis Nowosad on drums.nublu.net PETER EVANS WITH MAZZ SWIFT AND RON STABINSKY at National Sawdust (Feb. 27, 7 p.m.). An unassailable young virtuoso on trumpet, Evans uses extended technique to create some of the most darkly inscrutable music around. At National Sawdust as part of John Zorn’s monthly Commissioning Series, Evans presents two sets of original music: a solo trumpet work, and a series of compositions for violin and piano, performed by Swift and Stabinsky.646-779-8455, nationalsawdust.org LOUIS HAYES at the Iridium (Feb. 22, 8 p.m.). This 81-year-old drummer plays straight-ahead jazz with a big, broad swing feel, and a built-in sense of the Afro-Latin underpinnings of jazz rhythm. His mix of nuanced syncopation and raw power helped define some quintessential hard-bop groups of the 1960s, led by figures such as Cannonball Adderley and Oscar Peterson. His most recent album as a leader is “Serenade for Horace,” from 2017, a tribute to the pianist Horace Silver. He appears here with Vincent Herring on alto saxophone, David Hazeltine on piano and Dezron Douglas on bass.212-582-2121, theiridium.com IRREVERSIBLE ENTANGLEMENTS, AMINA CLAUDINE MYERS AND NICOLE MITCHELL at Merkin Hall (Feb. 28, 7:30 p.m.). This concert brings together some of the most deeply rooted and wildly inventive storytellers in improvised music. A pianist and vocalist, Myers, 76, was an early member of Chicago’s Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians; she writes and performs music with hard-bound connections to gospel and blues, and an expansive approach to improvising. Mitchell, a flutist, became the association’s first female chair 10 years ago; her music often deals in grand themes of science fiction and heroism. The group Irreversible Entanglements is a scalding, free-improvising quintet featuring the young performance poet Camae Ayewa (known as Moor Mother in her solo work), who draws connections across epochs of African and American history, making sense of trauma and gathering power to take action today. At this Ecstatic Music Festival show, these three acts will perform together for the first time.212-501-3330, kaufmanmusiccenter.org ARUAN ORTIZ AND DON BYRON at Mezzrow (Feb. 27, 8 and 9:30 p.m.). Two ecumenical improvisers with a mix of jazz vocabulary and classical precision, Ortiz, a Cuban-born pianist, and Byron, an American clarinetist, released a powerful album of duets last year, “Random Dances and (A)tonalities.” It included takes on pieces by Duke Ellington, Johann Sebastian Bach and Geri Allen, as well as a few twisty, centrifugal original tunes. At Mezzrow, an intimate basement club, they will play repertoire from that album.646-476-4346, mezzrow.com KAMASI WASHINGTON at the Apollo Theater (Feb. 23, 8 p.m.). Over the past four years, Washington has made greater inroads into the mainstream than any jazz musician of his generation. He’s done it by threading together opposing traditions from his native Los Angeles, each with its own surprising resonance today: grooving, dance-inflected jazz-funk from the 1970s and ’80s, and the looser, more expressionistic music of avant-garde artists such as Horace Tapscott and Bobby Bradford. At the Apollo, leading a 10-piece iteration of his band, the Next Step, Washington will play selections from his hit albums, “The Epic” (2015) and “Heaven and Earth” (2018).212-531-5305, apollotheater.orgGIOVANNI RUSSONELLO REMEMBERING JONAS: A TRIBUTE TO JONAS MEKAS at City Winery (Feb. 21, 8 p.m.). If you desire another opportunity to honor Mekas’s life, Patti Smith, John Zorn, Lee Renaldo, Richard Barone, David Amram and Glenn Mercer are getting together to give you a musical one. Along with the film critic Amy Taubin and other special guests, these musicians are gathering tonight to pay homage to the pioneering filmmaker through song and spoken word. Proceeds will benefit Anthology Film Archives, Mekas’s dream home for avant-garde cinema that he made real with the help of Jerome Hill, P.

5c420db03a125f5075c052a6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/18/arts/music/sabine-devieilhe-review-carnegie-hall.html,"For a coloratura soprano, the Fire Aria from Ravel’s “L’Enfant et les Sortilèges” — high runs and Queen of the Night histrionics — is a perfect showcase for technical wizardry and spunk. So it made sense for Sabine Devieilhe, a rising star in her native France who has won acclaim at the leading opera houses of Europe, to include it in her debut at Carnegie Hall’s Weill Recital Hall on Thursday. But Ms. Devieilhe’s impetuous and sparkling rendition of that showpiece was only the encore — an afterthought, really — for an evening of delicate, nuanced French art songs. It says something about the confidence of this 33-year-old artist that she felt no need to offer a grab bag highlighting her strengths. The program she assembled, songs by Debussy and his circle, was refined and cohesive. And it still held plenty of opportunities to show off her nimble singing and radiant tone. Ms. Devieilhe also had a superb partner in the pianist Mathieu Pordoy, whose artistry helped to make this an evening of first-rate chamber music. His finely contoured playing, especially in numbers by Debussy, stood out for its clarity and light pedal use. He revealed details in music that other pianists tend to dissolve in a reverberant haze. Clarity was also the defining quality of Ms. Devieilhe’s performance, both in her lucid, evenly weighted tone and in her meticulous attention to language. Her program drew heavily on settings of quietly enigmatic texts, whether by Symbolist poets like Paul Verlaine or Sanskrit miniatures filtered through the lenses of Western translators. Ms. Devieilhe embraced the emotional ambiguity of such works using tone color to bring out glints of surreal humor — as in Ravel’s “Sur l’herbe” — or draw a moody veil over an entire song, as in Albert Roussel’s “Le jardin mouillé.” (That song was one of two about rain: While Roussel rendered the irregular patter of drops rolling off leaves, Debussy’s “Il pleure dans mon coeur” captured the regular drum of precipitation on city streets and the rushing of water in gutters.) In Poulenc’s “Fêtes galantes,” with its affectionate portrait of a busy street scene, Ms. Devieilhe found a gossipy, conversational tone close to that of a chanson singer. Debussy’s “Chevaux de bois,” about a carousel on a rural fairground, also drew forth chatty and bright singing. But the most arresting moment, and a taste of Ms. Devieilhe’s virtuosity, came without words or accompaniment. In 1912, the composer Maurice Delage, a student of Ravel’s, traveled through India. While there, he wrote “Four Hindu Poems,” which elegantly reflect that country’s music. “Lahore” is based on a text by Heinrich Heine that imagines a snow-covered fir dreaming of a palm tree “grieving” in the heat. After the poem’s last line, the piano falls silent, and the soprano continues wordlessly in a trancelike sequence of arabesque lines, some sung through closed lips. Ms. Devieilhe conjured an array of colors beginning with a nasal sound that turned into a warm hum before opening into cool brilliance. It was a stunning display of vocal control and proof — in the midst of an all-French recital — of Ms. Devieilhe’s polyglot artistry. "
5c4726b73a125f5075c05a89,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/22/movies/the-5-browns-digging-through-the-darkness-review.html,"In this documentary about siblings in a classical music ensemble, one of the girls, then in her early teens, describes herself as “optimistic and happy.” The all-Americanness of the three sisters and two brothers who came to be known as the 5 Browns manifested itself in a variety of ways. Born in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and raised in Utah, they were avatars of well-scrubbed cheer and hard work. Home-schooled, each one practiced piano at all hours. Their professional performances were both novel and impractical, playing five-piano arrangements of canonical classical music. Doing the sort of thing you don’t expect to see done at all, let alone done well, is also, arguably, very all-American. “The 5 Browns,” directed by Ben Niles and expanding on a short he made two years ago, is subtitled “Digging Through The Darkness.” The Brown sisters — Desirae, Deondra and Melody — were sexually abused by their father, Keith, from girlhood into their teens. The idea of the siblings performing together as a unit really came about only after a 2000 New York Times article about how all the children were attending Juilliard simultaneously. After the act got underway, Keith Brown became the business manager and put his children on a punishing schedule, keeping up the abuse for much of the time. Once the sisters revealed what was going on to one another, and to their brothers, Gregory and Ryan, there had to be a reckoning. And so there was, one that led to further trouble, and one inarguably just resolution: Keith Brown is serving a prison sentence. This story is in a sense confounding. I can’t imagine the bitterness of having to deal with one’s vocation and artistic calling being inextricably linked to a monstrous, criminal upbringing. And yet the movie is framed by scenes of the now adult Browns making a new record. For as much as they suffered, music was able to keep them sane, and united. The director and his editor, Amanda Larson, construct the movie in a fairly conventional way, but leave a single string dangling, which they pull tight to devastating emotional effect near the end. The five Browns are likable, admirable individuals; two of the sisters started the Foundation for Surviving Abuse, an advocacy group, and we see them at work with eloquence and compassion. Their trauma and their subsequent resolve, as depicted here, are also, finally, all-American. "

The annual experimental-music festival announced on Monday that it will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the trailblazing label ECM Records with 20 separate performances across its four days. This is set to be the largest single convocation of ECM-related artists in the United States. Like the rest of Big Ears, these shows will take place March 21-24 at a variety of venues throughout downtown Knoxville, Tenn. Since 1969, ECM has been devoted to publishing music at the crossroads of contemporary Western classical, jazz and experimental music. This puts it roughly in line with the programmatic mission of Big Ears. ECM’s founder and director, Manfred Eicher, will be on hand at the festival, although he has not yet announced plans to participate in any official events. ECM-affiliated performers at the festival will include the drummer Jack DeJohnette; the violist Kim Kashkashian; the pianists Vijay Iyer and Craig Taborn, performing in duet; and the Art Ensemble of Chicago, a group that has lived at the cusp of experimental improvised music since before ECM was founded.

5c5b1d913a125f5075c08550,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/06/arts/music/piano-jeremy-denk-behzod-abduraimov-leon-fleisher.html,"Over just five days in New York, three distinctive pianists at three different stages of their careers offered exceptional performances. The first half of Jeremy Denk’s fascinating recital at Carnegie Hall on Friday was devoted to themes and variations, beginning with Beethoven’s cheeky Variations on “Rule Britannia,” and ending with his astounding “Eroica” Variations,” a warm-up for the “Eroica” Symphony. The intricate manipulations Beethoven gives his themes in the symphony’s finale are nothing compared to the gnarly gyrations of the piano variations, which Mr. Denk, 48, dispatched with a winning combination of pluck and intensity. Between the two, he performed John Adams’s swirling, murky “I Still Play” Variations and Mendelssohn’s darkly brilliant and, at times, vehement “Variations Sérieuses,” written in homage to Beethoven. Schumann’s Fantasy in C, which Mr. Denk played after intermission, also nods to Beethoven by quoting a theme from the song cycle “An die ferne Geliebte” in the wistful final episode of the fantasy’s teeming first movement. This 30-minute fantasy in three movements is one of Schumann’s most ingeniously structured scores, yet Mr. Denk kept you engrossed every moment by fantastical, dreamy, and, in the rousing march movement, giddily energetic flights. This was one of the finest performances I’ve heard of an elusive and challenging piece. As an encore, Mr. Denk, who revels in mood-shifting pairings, played Donald Lambert’s 1941 take on the “Pilgrim’s Chorus” from Wagner’s “Tannhäuser,” which turns this solemn anthem into something close to boogie-woogie. Schumann dedicated the Fantasy in C to Liszt. Years later, Liszt returned the favor by dedicating his daunting Sonata in B minor to Schumann. On Saturday, the 28-year-old Uzbek pianist Behzod Abduraimov gave a stunning performance of the sonata at the 92nd Street Y. With prodigious technique and rhapsodic flair, Mr. Abduraimov dispatched the work’s challenges, including burst upon burst of arm-blurring octaves, with eerie command. I was even more impressed by how he conveyed the structure of this single-movement yet boldly episodic piece. He began with an elegant account of Liszt’s remarkable piano transcription of the “Liebestod” from Wagner’s “Tristan und Isolde.” There were danger signs from Mr. Abduraimov, however, in his account of Prokofiev’s 10 Pieces from “Romeo and Juliet.” Though Mr. Abduraimov sometimes played with captivating delicacy and milky colorings, he could not resist going for broke during the percussive, heaving episodes of these pieces. His sound was too often steely and harsh. Finally, on Tuesday at Zankel Hall, Leon Fleisher, who turned 90 in July, had a belated birthday celebration. A revered pianist and teacher, Mr. Fleisher has inspired several generations of younger musicians. He has also been a role model in the way he coped with infirmity. In the mid-1960s, hailed as one of the leading pianists of his generation, he suffered a debilitating injury to his right hand, apparently because of over-intense practicing. In time, he channeled his energy into conducting, teaching and performing left-hand piano repertory. In the 1990s, after a range of treatments, he emerged again as a two-hand pianist, though never quite fully. There have been shortcomings to his right hand’s functioning in recent years, but his playing has always been profoundly musical, as with his performance on Tuesday of Egon Petri’s arrangement of Bach’s “Sheep May Safely Graze.” Mr. Fleisher played this lovely piece with lilting sway and tenderness and brought out inner voices beautifully. He excelled in Leon Kirchner’s “L.H.” for left hand, written for him — a piece of impetuous energy and tangy, atonal harmonies. Two devoted Fleisher students also took part. Jonathan Biss gave a fervent and insightful account of Beethoven’s Sonata in E (Op. 109), marred by a couple of rough passages, and a glistening performance of Kirchner’s restless “Interlude II.” And Yefim Bronfman joined the Dover String Quartet in the dramatic first movement of Brahms’s Piano Quintet in F minor. The evening ended with fitting intimacy. Mr. Fleisher played Mozart’s soft-spoken Piano Concerto No. 12 in A (K. 414), in a version for piano and string quartet (the Dover players again) and bass (Rachel Calin). If his right-hand passagework did not always sparkle, it hardly mattered, for all the genial warmth and integrity of his playing. "
5c91306649f0eacbf105de6c,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/19/obituaries/jh-kwabena-nketia-dead.html,"J. H. Kwabena Nketia, a Ghanaian ethnomusicologist and composer who became the world’s leading scholar on African musical traditions, died on March 13 in Legon, a suburb of Accra, the capital of Ghana. He was 97. His death, at a hospital, was confirmed by the composer Fred Onovwerosuoke, who studied with Dr. Nketia and became a close friend. In a career stretching back to the 1950s and continuing into his 90s, Dr. Nketia wrote hundreds of articles and books in English and Twi, a Ghanaian language, on topics ranging from music theory to folklore, as well as scores of compositions. He held professorships at the University of California, Los Angeles; the University of Pittsburgh; and the University of Ghana, where he helped shape the curriculum after Ghana broke free from British rule. His 1974 book, “The Music of Africa,” is widely considered a definitive historical study, and “Ethnomusicology and African Music,” a collection of his writings published in 2005, is used in classrooms throughout Africa and across the world. As a composer, Dr. Nketia wrote music for choirs, solo voices and instrumental groups that used both African and Western instruments. His music was particularly informed by the sounds of Ghana, but he integrated influences from across the African continent. In his academic work, too, Dr. Nketia espoused a Pan-African ideology even as he insisted on the multiplicity of sub-Saharan cultures. “The most important characteristic of this family of musical traditions is the diversity of expressions it accommodates, a diversity arising from different applications of common procedures and usages,” he wrote. “The music of Africa, like its language, is, so to speak, ‘ethnic-bound.’ Each society practices its own variant.” Dr. Nketia devised ways of using Western techniques to document and analyze African music while preserving its indigenous characteristics. He revolutionized how the rhythms of sub-Saharan African music are transcribed, employing the 6/8 time signature rather than a simple two-beat measure. And his studies went beyond rhythmic analysis. He made a point of championing the diversity of harmonic languages used throughout Africa as well. “He always wanted to ensure that the West knew about the diversity of our harmonic language,” Dr. Onovwerosuoke said. Robert Farris Thompson, a professor emeritus of art history at Yale University, wrote in an email that Dr. Nketia was “one of the finest scholars in all of post-colonial Africa,” adding, “He showed that the African history of music was a sacred tradition revealed.” Joseph Hanson Kwabena Nketia was born on June 22, 1921, in Asante Mampong, Ghana. In the Akan language, Kwabena is the name for boys born on Tuesday. An only child, he was raised by his mother and maternal grandparents after his father died. He credited his grandparents as his first music teachers. He received training in European music theory as a high school student at the Presbyterian Training College in southeastern Ghana. In 1944, he was one of 20 Ghanaians in the first class awarded Britain’s Commonwealth scholarship, which sent him to England to study linguistics at the School of Oriental and African Studies. He also took classes at the Trinity College of Music and Birkbeck College at the University of London. In 1952, back in Ghana, he accepted a research fellowship in African studies at what is now the University of Ghana and traveled the country recording musical performances and festivals. He began developing interdisciplinary programs at the university that explored the intersections of language, dance, music and folklore. Dr. Nketia traveled to the United States for the first time in 1958, on a Rockefeller Foundation fellowship; over the course of a year he studied at Juilliard, Columbia University and Northwestern University, and developed relationships with such prominent American musicians and folklorists as Charles Seeger and Henry Cowell. Dr. Nketia performed “The Republic Suite,” perhaps his defining musical composition, at Ghana’s Republic Day Concert on July 1, 1960, celebrating the election of his friend Kwame Nkrumah as the nation’s first president. The suite’s formal elements aligned it with Western classical music, but many of its melodies were drawn from traditional songs recognizable to Ghanaian listeners. Dr. Nketia became the deputy director of the University of Ghana’s new Institute of African Studies in 1961. Three years later, having attained tenure as a full professor, he became the first African to serve as the institute’s director. Soon after, he became the founding director of what is now the School of Performing Arts, and he filled its faculty and research positions with prominent Ghanaian artists, including the playwright Efua Sutherland, the author Ama Ata Aidoo and the choreographer Albert Mawere Opoku. In 1992 he founded the International Center for African Music and Dance, an archive based at the university. Dr. Nketia was the recipient of many awards and worked with a number of international cultural organizations, including Unesco’s International Commission for a Scientific and Cultural History of Mankind. Tireless in his scholarship, he delivered lectures at universities on five continents well into his later years and published his last book, “Reinstating Traditional Music in Contemporary Contexts,” in 2016, on the eve of his 95th birthday. He is survived by three daughters, Akosua Adoma Perbi, Priscilla Naana Nketia and Adjoa Nketia; seven grandchildren; and nine great-grandchildren. His wife and their two sons, Kwabena Yeboa Nketia and Eric Kwame Gyimah Nketia, died before him. Dr. Nketia’s grandson Kwame Ametepee Tsikata, a famed Ghanaian rapper known as M.anifest, remembered him as “very generous with all his knowledge and his wisdom.” “He had an incredible intellectual curiosity,” Mr. Tsikata said, “until the end.” "

But could it really help spur the recent revival of French Baroque music, and fuel the renewed interest in the viola da gamba, an instrument that had been rare since the 18th century? It may sound improbable, but the 1991 Alain Corneau film “Tous les Matins du Monde,” starring Gérard Depardieu and featuring a soundtrack by the Catalan viol master Jordi Savall, did just that — in ways that continue to resonate more than a quarter of a century later. “Young people were fascinated by the film,” recalled Mr. Savall, who is touring the movie’s music with Le Concert des Nations and will perform it on Thursday night at Carnegie Hall’s Zankel Hall. (The concert will be broadcast by WQXR.) “The movie reached people who would never go to a concert, especially a concert of Baroque music.” The film was a phenomenon, racking up awards and drawing audiences around the globe. Its Louis XIV-era soundtrack scaled the charts in France, where it outsold all but Michael Jackson. And on the weekend of the film’s United States release, the album, featuring music by the Baroque composers Lully, Sainte-Colombe and Marais, sold more copies than Madonna’s “Erotica” at some New York stores, prompting one newspaper to ask: “Better than sex?” It hit just as the French Baroque revival was beginning to flourish, thanks in large part to the pathbreaking productions of the conductor William Christie and the ensemble Les Arts Florissants, who were bringing long-neglected French masters back into vogue. But by reaching viewers beyond the concert hall, the film turned new audiences on to the poignant beauty of the viola da gamba, a fretted, bowed instrument played between the legs that had been popular during the Renaissance and Baroque eras. For many players, makers and teachers of the viol, the success of “Tous les Matins du Monde” and its soundtrack was startling. And for some, it was life-changing. Loren Ludwig was 15 and trying to figure out how to play the Bach cello suites on his electric guitar when he first heard the plaintive, mellow sound of the viol on a cassette of the movie’s soundtrack. “It was like nothing I’d heard before,” Mr. Ludwig recalled. He soon began taking viol lessons, went on to study the instrument at the Oberlin Conservatory of Music. Now he plays with ensembles, including LeStrange Viols and ACRONYM. Along the way, he said, he had discovered that many of his viol-playing colleagues had also had formative experiences with the soundtrack. “It’s a little bit of a joke among viol players in my generation,” he said. To say the film inspired a craze would be an overstatement; it was not “The Lego Movie,” a blockbuster selling an already-popular product. But it did have an impact that continues to be felt, said Charlie Ogle, who was already making viols when the film came out. “I thought, ‘I’m going to sell a million instruments!’” he recalled in a telephone interview. “And then nothing, zippo. But maybe six months, a year later, somebody asked about an instrument, and told me that the movie had put them on to it. And then the next year, a couple. And since then, it’s been a significant, steady background influence.” Viol players sometimes roll their eyes at the artistic liberties the film takes with the history of Marais and Sainte-Colombe, and Mr. Depardieu’s less-than-convincing miming of playing the instrument. But they recall new students signing up for their classes, new audiences showing up to their concerts, and the simple excitement of seeing their world celebrated. “I was 35 and fairly early in my career, and I cheered when Marais led the orchestra, pounding on the floor with a staff,” said Lisa Terry, the president of the Viola da Gamba Society of America, which has more than a thousand members. Even established musicians found it beneficial. Mr. Christie, who is bringing Les Arts Florissants to the Brooklyn Academy of Music in early March for “Rameau, Maître à Danser,” a pairing of two of Rameau’s pastoral opera-ballets, said that the film had reached audiences beyond the regular concert-going public. “Back in those days, I think for a musician who wanted to specialize in something like that, you needed all the help you could get,” Mr. Christie said in a telephone interview, adding that he had missed the film’s premiere because of an illness and never ended up seeing it, despite his longstanding admiration for Mr. Savall. Mr. Savall recalled that, while recording the soundtrack, Mr. Corneau — the film’s director, who died in 2010 — would urge him to play the pieces not as he would in a concert, but as if he were Marin Marais during emotionally charged moments in the composer’s life. “I was playing, for the first time, as an actor,” Mr. Savall said. “It was for me a lesson: For this I have said, many times, Alain Corneau was my last teacher.” Asked why he thought the viol music struck such a nerve, Mr. Savall quoted the composer Couperin, who said that he preferred music that touched him to music that surprised him. “We have today so many superficial things,” Mr. Savall said. “I think in life we need to be touched. Sometimes it’s also nice to be surprised. But the essential thing is to be touched.” "

5ca3831d49f0eacbf1f802ca,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/02/theater/death-in-venice-ivo-van-hove-nico-muhly.html,"AMSTERDAM — At an Amsterdam rehearsal studio one recent afternoon, Thomas Mann, the German author who died in 1955, was speaking with the main character of his novella, “Death in Venice.” “I have to get out of here,” said Gustav von Aschenbach, collapsing into a chair with his head in his hands. “That’s a good idea,” said Mann, hovering nearby. But Mann did not let him leave. Instead, he forced his character to stay in Venice, tormented by his obsession with a 14-year-old Polish boy, and to die there. In this new musical production of “Death in Venice,” created by the internationally renowned Belgian director Ivo van Hove, the author is present. Mann doesn’t only converse with his protagonist, but also with his own wife, Katia, who watches from the sidelines as her husband also becomes increasingly distracted by the sight of the beautiful boy. It is what you might call a meta-rendering of “Death in Venice”: A story from Thomas Mann’s real life — how he created a fictional alter ego with submerged homoerotic urges — is the framing device that sets the stage adaptation into dramatic motion. [Read about Ivo van Hove’s staging of a rarely heard “Diary.”] Premiering April 4, the production is a collaboration between the Internationaal Theater Amsterdam (formerly known as the Toneelgroep Amsterdam), which Mr. van Hove leads, and the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra. They have commissioned music by the American composer Nico Muhly, which will be interspersed between works by Richard Strauss, Anton Webern and Arnold Schoenberg, and conducted by David Robertson. The production will tour Europe from next year, with performances in London, Paris and Zagreb. “We see Mann at home writing this novel, creating von Aschenbach, sending him to Venice, and having him meet a boy,” explained Mr. van Hove, in a rehearsal break. “It’s to make clear that this wasn’t just a story to Thomas Mann: It was something that he lived through.” Ramsey Nasr, who adapted the novella for the stage and plays Aschenbach, said in an email exchange that the idea of incorporating the real-life story of Thomas and Katia Mann into the drama was a way to explore how artists create fictions from their own lives. Katia described in her 1974 memoir, “Unwritten Memories,” how “Death in Venice” was based on a trip the two took to the city in 1911, when they stayed at the Grand Hôtel des Bains on the Lido, and encountered many figures whom Mann used as models for his characters. The boy who became Mann’s muse was later identified as Wladyslaw Moes, the 10-year-old son of an aristocratic Polish family, in the 2001 book “The Real Tadzio,” by the Scottish journalist Gilbert Adair. When Mr. Nasr learned about this background to the novel, he said, “It made me wonder: How was it for her to be there and witness it all?” This gave him “all the ingredients for a drama encapsulating the story,” he added. Katia, who outlived her husband by 25 years, was almost 90 when she finally revealed publicly how she had dealt with that chapter of their life together. “She didn’t talk about it for her whole life, really,” said Mr. van Hove. “She accepted that he had this in him but he turned it into novels and he turned it into poetry and into art.” “Death in Venice” is one of the most celebrated works of German literature, and it has been adapted as an acclaimed film by Luchino Visconti, in 1971, and as Benjamin Britten’s final opera, which premiered in 1973. Mr. Muhly, a composer who has worked with Philip Glass and Björk, has written new music for the production. In an interview, he said this “Death in Venice” was neither an opera nor a music theater piece, but rather “a play with a lot of room for music.” The difficulty of adapting the novella for the stage is that the drama of the story largely takes place in Aschenbach’s mind. Visconti reimagined Aschenbach as a composer and conductor (played by Dirk Bogarde) and used music by Mahler on the soundtrack to reflect Aschenbach’s anguish. In Britten’s opera, Aschenbach retains his identity as a writer, who sings his interior monologue, while Tadzio has a nonspeaking role, typically performed by a dancer. Mr. Muhly said he knew Britten’s opera “incredibly well,” and that it was a key reference point for his own opera “Two Boys,” which was performed at the Metropolitan Opera in New York in 2013. But, he said, he had to “not think about that at all. Instead, I was thinking about the text, I was thinking about the adaptation, and what Ivo’s team has done to frame this text and to tell the story in different way.” Mr. van Hove has created three productions this season that concern what he called “abusive forbidden relationships”: a stage adaptation of Hanya Yanagihara’s novel “A Little Life,” which tells a story of a victim of pedophilia, and “The Wood,” a play adapted from a novel by Jeroen Brouwers, which portrays physical and sexual abuse in a Roman Catholic monastery and boarding school. “It’s very current, with what’s coming out about the Catholic church and, coincidentally, this whole Michael Jackson thing,” he said, referring to the new documentary “Leaving Neverland,” about child-abuse allegations against the pop musician. “It’s really something that people are talking about more and more. Thomas Mann wrote about the subject of desire. You cannot call it abuse; it’s in someone’s mind, but it’s really a fantasy desire.” Mr. Robertson, who will lead the Concertgebouw for the production’s Amsterdam run, cautioned against thinking of “Death in Venice” as primarily about homoerotic or pedophilic urges. The production was asking bigger questions, he added: “Where does creativity come from? Where does love stem from, and what happens when love and creativity are blended together?” Mr. Robertson said he thought the project was a wholly new take on Mann’s story. “This doesn’t replace the novella, the film or the opera,” he said. “It augments this fantastic creation that Thomas Mann has made.” "
5c5dd2da3a125f5075c08c5d,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/08/arts/music/new-york-philharmonic-tan-dun-brahms-review.html,"Of all the things that inspire music, one of the most paradoxically productive is death. Whether the sounds it brings forth are meant to console, to offer catharsis, or to build a bridge to the soul of the departed, common to all is a refusal to accept that definitive silence. Funerary music was at the heart of two very different programs at the New York Philharmonic this week. A glittering Lunar New Year gala on Wednesday, conducted by Kahchun Wong, included the American premiere of a violin concerto by Tan Dun called “Fire Ritual.” On Thursday, the orchestra’s music director, Jaap van Zweden, led a burnished reading of Brahms’s “A German Requiem.” Vastly unalike, both works are full of luminous color and reflect complex attitudes toward death. Brahms wrote his “German Requiem” during a period in which he suffered the loss of his mother, and not long after the death of his friend Robert Schumann. Comfort, sadness and faith in an afterlife free of suffering are interwoven in this sprawling work for chorus, soloists and orchestra. The opening chorus can’t quite seem to settle on a key or mood, and in the march of the second movement, the pulse is shared between the stern timpani and gentle harp. In the choir, too, the stentorian seriousness of the men singing a line from Peter, “For all flesh is as grass,” is answered by the women in a more pliable, folk-song-like style. If this music were a funerary wreath, it would be woven from meadow flowers rather than stiff chrysanthemums. [Culture Calendar: NYC’s most anticipated cultural events]  On Thursday, Mr. van Zweden was attentive to these nuances, drawing subtle and flexible playing from the orchestra. In the fugal passages, where the specter of Bach flickers through, he showed a patient eye for the overarching structure. In the excellent Concert Chorale of New York, meticulously prepared by James Bagwell, the men especially impressed with ringing, muscular fortes. The baritone Matthias Goerne brought mystery and intensity to his solos, while the soprano Ying Fang sang “Ihr habt nun Traurigkeit” (“You now have sadness”) with gleaming, youthful sound. When the choir first answered her, with lines evoking a mother’s consolation, its tone was so hushed that it sounded like a memory. Much of Mr. Tan’s “Fire Ritual” is designed to bring forth things that are hidden. In a program note, he explained that this work is inspired by ancient Chinese rituals that pit two groups of musicians against each other. The solo violin — here played with fierce dramatic commitment by Bomsori Kim — takes on a shamanistic role. With this work, the composer was “trying to find those dead people and souls to wake them up with special sounds and gestures and colors.” If conflicting emotions are interwoven in the Brahms, Mr. Tan isolates them and pits them in stark opposition. Tender, ornate violin solos alternate with brash orchestral outbursts full of clanging percussion and conciliatory passages. Some players are positioned in the auditorium, so that certain sounds — like an eerily realistic evocation of bird song — envelop the audience. The score includes unusual touches: musicians hum and hiss, the conductor intones a text, string players create wind by rhythmically fluttering a page of their music. Mr. Tan’s concerto was a potentially risky piece to program. With just one performance, it also represented a substantial investment of time and resources on the part of the musicians, who donated their services to benefit the Philharmonic at the Lunar New Year gala. Crowd-pleasing pieces like Li Huanzhi’s jaunty “Spring Festival Overture,” Stravinsky’s “Firebird” Suite and a barn-burning rendition of Mozart’s Queen of the Night aria from “The Magic Flute,” with the Korean soprano So Young Park, worked their reliable magic on an enthusiastic audience.

5c2bc8fb3a125f5075c0277c,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/01/arts/aldo-parisot-dead.html,"Aldo Parisot, a renowned cellist who toured the world as a soloist and settled into a career as an eminent teacher that included a 60-year tenure at the Yale School of Music, died on Saturday at his home in Guilford, Conn. He was 100. His death was announced by his son, Dean Parisot, a film director and producer in Los Angeles. The cellist had retired from Yale only last June. During the busiest stage of his solo career Mr. Parisot performed with the major orchestras of Berlin, London, Paris and Munich, and with conductors including Leopold Stokowski, Pierre Monteux and Leonard Bernstein, winning plaudits for his warm, focused sound; prodigious technique; and a temperament that balanced passion and elegance. For a 1955 New York Philharmonic appearance under the conductor Walter Hendl, he gave the premiere of Heitor Villa-Lobos’s Cello Concerto No. 2, one of many works Mr. Parisot would commission during his career to expand the cello repertory. But by his 30s he had started teaching. He held positions at the Peabody Conservatory (now part of Johns Hopkins University), Mannes College of Music and elsewhere before joining the faculty at Yale in 1958. Many Parisot students have gone on to solo careers and to prominent positions in ensembles, orchestras and conservatories. They include Roman Jablonski, Ole Akahoshi and Shauna Rolston. Carter Brey, the principal cellist of the New York Philharmonic, who studied with Mr. Parisot at Yale in the late 1970s, shared his memories in an email. Mr. Parisot’s teaching style “was not based on the transmission of a grand, overarching view of music,” Mr. Brey wrote. “Neither was it greatly concerned with historical detail. It was practical, reactive and prescriptive.” Being part of his class was like attending “the highest-level finishing school imaginable,” Mr. Brey wrote, “none of us sounding like anyone else, and above all none of us sounding like him.” Aldo Simões Parisot was born on Sept. 30, 1918, in Natal, Brazil. His mother was a church organist. His father, an engineer, died when Aldo was 4. His stepfather, Thomazzo Babini, a fine cellist, was his first and only significant cello teacher. “Everything I know and teach today comes from him,” Mr. Parisot said of his stepfather in 2001. At 18 he became the principal cellist of the orchestra in Rio de Janeiro. Still, he was restless for a solo career. The attaché to the American Embassy, impressed by Mr. Parisot, helped arrange for him to study at the Curtis Institute of Music with his idol, the great cellist Emanuel Feuermann. But Feuermann died in 1942 three months before Mr. Parisot was to start lessons. (He would later acquire a Stradivarius cello that had belonged to Feuermann.) In 1946, Mr. Parisot became a scholarship student at the Yale School of Music, but with a stipulation that he would take no cello lessons: He already felt confident of his technique and approach. Instead he studied chamber music and, with the composer Paul Hindemith, music theory. In 1948 he joined the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra but left after two years. A 1950 recital at Town Hall in New York drew wide praise and led to international tours and recordings. He had a major success in 1966 at Tanglewood when he gave the premiere of Donald Martino’s “Parisonatina al’dodecafonia,” a formidable work for solo cello written for him. Reviewing the performance, The New York Times critic Harold C. Schonberg, who in general resisted thorny modern music employing 12-tone techniques, was enthusiastic about Martino’s “whizbang virtuoso piece in the modern idiom,” as he called it. Probably as “difficult a work as ever has been written for the cello,” Mr. Schonberg wrote, the piece “throws at the performer everything in the book and a few things that aren’t.” But, he added, in an “extraordinary performance,” Mr. Parisot “accomplished everything with an easy, almost bored expression,” and “his tone and intonation never betrayed him.” Besides the lure of teaching, Mr. Parisot curtailed his solo career to spend more time with his family. He is survived by his wife of 52 years, Elizabeth (Sawyer) Parisot, a pianist and professor at the Yale School of Music; his three sons from a previous marriage to Ellen (Lewis) Parisot, Dean, Robert and Ricardo; a half brother, Italo Babini, a cellist; and six grandchildren. Another student, the cellist Ralph Kirshbaum, wrote in a 2009 New York Times appreciation that Mr. Parisot’s “directness and impulsive statements, uncensored by political correctness,” sometimes “ruffled feathers.” But his teacher radiated warmth, charm and impish humor, Mr. Kirshbaum wrote. The article quotes the famous cellist and pedagogue Janos Starker describing Mr. Parisot as “the best cello teacher I have met in my life.” In 1983, Mr. Parisot founded Yale Cellos, an ensemble of 20 or so cellists who play everything from arrangements of Bach to contemporary scores. Though the group’s overall sound is deep and rich, Mr. Parisot, as conductor, drew remarkable clarity and nuance from the ensemble, which toured and recorded, including a Delos CD “Bach Bachianas” that earned a 1988 Grammy nomination. Long ago Mr. Parisot started proclaiming that he was 60 years old and would remain 60 until he died. “The secret to staying young,” he was quoted as saying in the 2009 Times article, “is to surround yourself with the younger generation. It is boring to talk to the elderly about their blood pressure and cholesterol levels.” "
5c89607e49f0eacbf105ce3f,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/13/obituaries/michael-gielen-dead.html,"Michael Gielen, a probing conductor who championed contemporary music and daring opera productions, died on Friday at his home near Mondsee, Austria, east of Salzburg. He was 91. His death was confirmed by the German broadcaster SWR. Mr. Gielen was active mostly in Europe, and one of his most important posts was as general music director of the Frankfurt Opera, a job he held for a decade starting in 1977. There he gave the German premieres of works by Luigi Nono and Alban Berg, revived overlooked works by Ferruccio Busoni and Franz Schreker, and invited the most ambitious directors to stage standard repertory. Working with the dramaturge Klaus Zehelein, Mr. Gielen collaborated with Jürgen Flimm, Harry Kupfer, Hans Neuenfels (including for a pivotal “Aida” in 1980) and Ruth Berghaus, who produced Wagner’s “Ring” in notably symbolic fashion. In 1987, John Rockwell of The New York Times called the Frankfurt house “the most prominent exponent in the world of radical operatic stage direction and design.” Mr. Gielen was music director of the Cincinnati Symphony from 1980 to 1986, and his radical programming there alienated many. The next year he found a more congenial home back in Germany as chief conductor of the SWR Symphony Orchestra Baden-Baden, which became the SWR Symphony Orchestra Baden-Baden and Freiburg in 1996. That orchestra, backed by the resources of German state radio, gave him the freedom to promote the newest of music, especially at the Donaueschinger Musiktage, a festival in southern Germany for contemporary composers. He remained the orchestra’s permanent guest conductor after stepping down in 1999, and later protested its merger with a sister ensemble in Stuttgart. His SWR orchestra recordings included a particularly lucid Mahler cycle, the symphonies of Beethoven and Brahms, and pieces by Bruckner, Stravinsky and the composers of the Second Viennese School. All prized detail and restraint over overt emotionality. The conductor Daniel Barenboim, who knew Mr. Gielen for almost 70 years and appointed him principal guest conductor of the Staatskapelle Berlin in 1999, said in a telephone interview that Mr. Gielen had always been “in search of what he considered the musical truth, for the solutions that were given to him by the score — and not by outside ideas.” Mr. Gielen, who won the prestigious Ernst von Siemens Music Prize in 2010, viewed music as a disciplined intellectual pursuit that, more than providing comfort or entertainment, should shed light on the conflicts of the age, both in the world at large and in humanity’s inner life. He particularly argued for confronting the horrors of the mid-20th century, represented by Auschwitz and Hiroshima. “If musical life does not convey this central experience of our time, which is the ‘Age of Anxiety,’ ” he said, “then it is not a cultural life, but a cultural lie.” Mr. Gielen conveyed his views through programming. A typical ploy was to preface Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony with Schoenberg’s reflection on the Holocaust, “A Survivor From Warsaw.” He even inserted the piece between the symphony’s heavenly slow movement and its paean to human brotherhood, the “Ode to Joy.” In a program note for the Cincinnati Symphony, Mr. Gielen wrote, “The greatness of the Ninth, its beauty, the shattering horror of the fanfare that begins its finale, these can fully reach us today only when we confront the other side of man.” Michael Andreas Gielen was born on July 20, 1927, in Dresden. His mother, Rose Steuermann, was an actress and soprano noted for her account of Schoenberg’s “Pierrot Lunaire;” his father, Josef Gielen, was a director at the city’s state theater, entrusted by Richard Strauss with the premieres of “Arabella” and “Die Schweigsame Frau.” Though their mother was Jewish, Michael and his older sister, Carola, were baptized as Catholics in 1935, but the Nazis hounded them all the same. They followed their father first to Berlin, then to Vienna, and finally to Buenos Aires, in 1940. In Argentina, Mr. Gielen was brought up among an exiled musical elite. He studied piano and composition under Erwin Leuchter, who had been Anton Webern’s assistant, and heard the operatic repertoire under the baton of Fritz Busch. After he withdrew from the University of Buenos Aires in 1946 and became a coach at the Teatro Colón, Mr. Gielen rehearsed “Tristan und Isolde” with the soprano Kirsten Flagstad and the conductor Erich Kleiber in 1948. When Wilhelm Furtwängler led Bach’s “St. Matthew Passion in 1950, Mr. Gielen played the recitatives. Again following his father, Mr. Gielen returned to Europe in 1950, and to the Vienna State Opera, where he assisted Clemens Krauss, Dmitri Mitropoulos and Karl Böhm. He continued to compose, and his Variations for String Quartet (1949) were performed in Darmstadt, the home of postwar experimentalism. But podium opportunities proved more alluring, and Mr. Gielen became a staff conductor at the opera, leading everything from Mozart to Honegger. As the music director of the Royal Swedish Opera from 1960 to 1965, Mr. Gielen oversaw a radical production of Stravinsky’s “The Rake’s Progress,” with Ingmar Bergman directing. As a guest conductor Mr. Gielen had a string of successes in famously challenging new music, overseeing the premieres in 1965 alone of Gyorgy Ligeti’s Requiem in Stockholm, Aribert Reimann’s “Traumspiel” in Kiel and, in Cologne, Bernd Alois Zimmermann’s “Die Soldaten,” a major but neglected work of the last century. He was at the helm of the Belgian National Orchestra from 1969 to 1973 and the Netherlands Opera from 1973 to 1975. Survivors include his wife, Helga Gielen, a soprano he married in 1957; their two children, Claudia and Lucas; and several grandchildren. Among Mr. Gielen’s compositions was “Pflicht und Neigung” (1988), which he recorded together with works by Schoenberg, Berg, Webern and Eduard Steuermann, his uncle, as a tribute to those 20th-century figures. The title translates to “Duty and Inclination.” “In order to make musical life meaningful, profoundly meaningful,” he told The Times in 1982, “one needs this kind of music as part of the program. I cannot live with the conscience of the truth being there waiting to be said and not being said.” "
5c33ce4b3a125f5075c033be,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/07/arts/globalfest-world-music-copacabana.html,"They showed up in Mardi Gras headdresses, fedoras and tutus paired with combat boots. They drummed on darbukas, djembes and congas. And many of the performers at Sunday’s GlobalFest also brought grievances with them along with their costumes and instruments: against occupation, the erasure of indigenous voices, walls. GlobalFest, which took over the Copacabana nightclub near Times Square for the first time this year, is an annual showcase of music from all corners of the earth. This year 12 acts performed overlapping sets on three stages in what proved a joyful and often raucous celebration of diversity and culture’s uncanny knack for slipping through borders and stretching out roots underneath walls. As such, the festival is an inherent act of defiance against any attempt to cement hierarchies. At the same time, it complicates the notion of identity politics by demonstrating the composite nature of style. While the musicians’ art was always fueled by tradition, their distinct sounds were almost invariably shaped by the clash — or serendipitous kiss — of difference. Sometimes it was the fusion of geographically far-flung styles that yielded new musical alloys. Indian ragas took on a flirtatious shimmer in the hands of Debashish Bhattacharya, who infused them with strains of Flamenco and Hawaiian music and performed them on a new breed of Indian slide guitar of his own devising. The result was a heady mix of languid Polynesian sounds caffeinated by the rhythmic fireworks of the tabla of Subhasis Bhattacharya, Debashish’s brother. The members of 47Soul are drawn from the Palestinian diaspora, but the group’s musical roots reach even wider, encompassing Middle Eastern dabke drumming, fuzzy synth beats and reggae to eminently danceable effect. Politics are never far from the surface in lyrics that speak of dispossession and in the label — “Shamstep” — the band has given its music, which voices dreams of Arab unity across the Levant. In fact, new labels were often needed to capture new hybrids: “Southern Gothic.” “Freak cabaret.” “Afropsychedelic.” “Afrofuturist global bass” is how the members of Gato Preto describe their combustible blend of rap, funk and Senegalese drumming. The band is fronted by the explosively charismatic Gata Misteriosa, from Mozambique, who teamed up with the Ghanaian-German producer Lee Bass and Moussa Diallo, an incandescent djembe master from Senegal. Their set had a steamy carnival energy, with the relentless drive of the machine-made pulse amplified by heart-quickening flurries of live drumming. Pulses were also set racing by BCUC, a South African group that brings punk-rock energy and hypnotic rhythms to social activism, and by the Orquesta Akokán, a Cuban-American big band uniting dazzling talent and midcentury polish in simmering mambos. A very different spell was cast by Amythyst Kiah — a self-described “Southern Gothic” singer of “alt-country blues” — who gave a standout performance in the evening’s only solo act. Her razor-sharp guitar picking alone guarantees her a place among blues masters, but it’s her deep-hued voice that can change on a dime from brushed steel to melted toffee that commands attention. In performance she comes across as both uncompromising and generous. She introduced a song, the traditional “Darling Cora,” by pointing out its shared roots in English and West African folk. When she sang it, accompanying herself on banjo, the instrument’s dry warmth seemed to carry echoes of the African stringed kora. Jeremy Dutcher, a Canadian who is a member of a Wolastoq community in New Brunswick, showed that artistic dialogue can be just as fruitful when conducted, not across cultures, but between generations. Mr. Dutcher, who won the coveted Polaris Music Prize last year, draws on wax cylinder recordings from the early 1900s of songs in Wolastoqiyik — a language that is now in danger of extinction. His lyrical compositions layer the ghostly frayed voices of his ancestors with jazzy arpeggios on the piano, keening cellos lines and arching phrases sung in his own voice, which is powered by classical training and colored here and there by the tremor and guttural catch of traditional chant. Classical strains also filtered into the elegant set by Magos Herrera, a Mexican vocalist with a feline, smoky voice, who teamed with the string quartet Brooklyn Rider and the percussionist Mathias Kunzli for her new album “Dreamers.” Her songs are drawn from across Latin America, united by delight in melody and storytelling, supported by the string quartet as it seamlessly morphs from rhythm section to silver-screen swooning. And classical instruments appeared — and were sometimes abused — in what was perhaps the most extraordinary show of the evening. Dakh Daughters is born out of Kiev’s theater scene and features seven women who bring equal parts musical and theatrical chops to performances that are witty, subversive and brash. Dressed in tutus and combat boots with their faces painted white, the Daughters stalked the stage like conquerors taking possession of an alien territory. Texts (in Ukrainian, English and French) were delivered in shouts, hisses and yelps, with the voices sometimes coming together in exquisitely vocalized folk harmonies. Individually, the voices belonged to wildly disparate worlds including heavy metal, punk, and the glassy plangency of Balkan folk singing. They handled instruments like found objects: a violin propped against a hip, a cello tilted at a rakish angle. The bassist mostly drew sound from her instrument by spanking it; the drummer stomped the foot pedal of her bass drum as if it were vermin. A signature song of the Daughters is “Rozy/Donbass,” referring to a region contested by Russia, once known to Ukrainians for its rose gardens. It begins with a mournful setting of lines by Shakespeare delivered almost mechanically, with shouts of “Donbass” flung out with raw aggression. Eventually the music takes on a ritualistic whirl until it screeches to a halt with just the word “rozy” — roses — intoned as if by zombies. The song, like the Daughters’ performance, is darkly seductive and alienating at once — a powerful expression of the tensions endured by women in conflict zones, and a reminder that identity often means fighting on multiple battle lines.

And they’ll be right. Music today, at least most of it, is fundamentally different from what it was in the days of yore — the 1970s and 80s.  Last year, the industry celebrated a sales milestone. The Recording Industry Association of America certified that the Eagles’ “Their Greatest Hits (1971-1975),” was the best-selling album of all time, with sales of 38 million. (The formula took account of vinyl, CD and streaming purchases. Purists will have to put aside the fact that a greatest hits collection is not really an LP album as most of us know it.) It was a full-circle moment — the album, released almost exactly 43 years ago, was the first to be awarded platinum status (sales of one million), an evocative reminder that songs were once commodities so valuable that millions of people would even buy them in repackaged form. It was also a taken as a quiet victory for people who believe that music today is too loud. By “too loud,” I don’t mean you can’t crank the Eagles, if that’s your thing. I’m talking about loudness as a measure of sound within a particular recording. Our ears perceive loudness in an environment by reflexively noting the dynamic range — the difference between the softest and loudest sounds (in this case, the environment is the recording itself, not the room you are playing it in). A blaring television commercial may make us turn down the volume of our sets, but its sonic peaks are no higher than the regular programming preceding it. The commercial just hits those peaks more often. A radio station playing classical music may be broadcasting a signal with the same maximum strength as one playing hip-hop, but the classical station broadcast will hit that peak perhaps once every few minutes, while the hip-hop station’s signal may peak several times per second. A loud environment in this sense is one with a limited dynamic range — highs that peak very high, and lows that aren’t much lower. For decades, musicians and engineers have employed dynamic range compression to make recordings sound fuller. Compression boosts the quieter parts and tamps down louder ones to create a narrower range. Historically, compression was usually applied during the mastering stage, the final steps through which a finished recording becomes a commercial release. In the predigital era, compression required a mastering engineer whose job is to create the physical master for the manufacturing process, to employ restraint and finesse. With digital audio, a few mouse clicks can compress the dynamic range with brute force. The result is music that sounds more aurally aggressive — like the television commercial. During the 1990s, as digital technology infiltrated the recording process, some mastering engineers wielded compression like a cudgel, competing to produce the loudest recordings. This recording industry “loudness war” was driven by linked aesthetic and economic imperatives. A louder record grabs your attention — and will often be perceived, at least at first, to have better sound quality than a less compressed album — and musicians didn’t want their product to sound weak by comparison. Maximum loudness, it was thought, was a prerequisite for commercial success. The war became so heated that by the latter part of the decade some mastering engineers took it a step further. They not only compressed dynamic range to within an inch of its life, they also made the loudest parts exceed the maximum possible peak. At these moments, the sound wave “clips,” becoming dense and distorted. As with compression, clipping can be done artistically — it may even aid and abet a certain dissonance that fits the music. But in the ’90s, it became yet another weapon in the loudness arms race, which was not one of artistic quality, but of profit. By the end of the decade, mastering engineers who had abstained from the war were losing clients. Recording engineers and producers often discovered their carefully rendered recordings were being squashed in the mastering stage. Over time, with listeners increasingly consuming music through earbuds and cheap computer speakers, engineers and producers found themselves working in a denuded sonic landscape, many of them longing for the rich and diverse audio ecosystems of old. While some extra-loud recordings seemed to benefit from this compression gamble (Dr. Dre’s 1992 “The Chronic” and Oasis’ 1995 “(What’s the Story) Morning Glory?” are oft-cited examples of loudness abetting a commercial powerhouse), there were other releases that were so obviously overloaded — like Red Hot Chili Peppers’ “Californication” (1999), Rush’s “Vapor Trails” (2002) and Metallica’s “Death Magnetic” (2008) — that the bands’ fans complained in droves. There was a potential downside to all this loudness. Many audio pros maintain that excessive loudness creates aural fatigue. We may not consciously notice it, they argue, but it makes us less likely to listen to music for extended periods. Although this is a difficult claim to prove, it is undeniable that decreased dynamic range has limited the sonic palette of recordings. When compact discs were introduced in the 1980s, one selling point was that they were capable of a greater dynamic range than vinyl records — yet the average pop recording today has a smaller dynamic range than records made during the analog era. Several years ago, Chris Johnson, an audio software developer, tested a theory, espoused by some anti-loudness activists, that the hyper-compression roiling the industry was partly to blame for shortened careers. Using a list of all-time best-selling recordings, he rearranged them by “commercial importance,” assigning each a score derived by multiplying an album’s number of platinum certifications (how many millions sold) by the number of years it had been on the market. These were records that were not merely popular — they also displayed longevity. He then used software to analyze the sound waves of each album. His findings revealed they had a common trait: these albums, even across genres, had extraordinary dynamic range. The most commercially important albums, he wrote, featured lots of “high contrast” moments, when “the transient attacks of instruments” — very brief outbursts of high energy — were allowed to stand out against “the background space where the instruments are placed.” This was especially true for vocals and percussion (one of the more intriguing similarities, from Michael Jackson’s “Thriller” to Pink Floyd’s “The Wall,” involved what Mr. Johnson called the “hit record drum sound”). Loudness has its place, but most of us like our music to have breathing room, so that our eardrums are constantly tickled by little sonic explosions. In a tight, compressed space, music can get asphyxiated. Topping Mr. Johnson’s commercially important list, just ahead of Led Zeppelin’s untitled fourth album, was the Eagles’ “Their Greatest Hits (1971-1975).” “It’s gratifying, but unsurprising,” Mr. Johnson wrote, “to discover that the single most commercially important album in R.I.A.A. history contains some of the most striking dynamic contrasts pop music’s ever seen.” The war never really ended, but it has evolved. Streaming services like Spotify now “normalize” the music’s output, so that we aren’t always adjusting our volume settings. This should lessen the incentive for mastering engineers to abuse compression. But according to Bob Ludwig, one of the industry’s pre-eminent mastering engineers (and a winner of Grammys for Best Engineered Album for artists like Alabama Shakes, Beck and Daft Punk), this hasn’t stopped mixing engineers from ladling on the loudness, reducing the dynamic range of the music even as the streaming normalization defeats their purpose. “The loudness war is worse than ever,” he recently told me. “It is a super-discouraging situation.” If we consider the Grammy nominees in this year’s Best Record category as a representative cross section of today’s music, it is clear (as the sampling below shows) that aggressive compression is still the norm. But as in every era of music, there are exceptions. “Shallow” by Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper displays a wider dynamic range than its competitors, a throwback — not just in theme, but also production value.  Every now and then, it seems, they do make music like they used to.  Greg Milner is the author of “Perfecting Sound Forever: An Aural History of Recorded Music” and “Pinpoint: How GPS is Changing Technology, Culture, and Our Minds.” "
5c753a1549f0eacbf105a33a,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/26/arts/dance/les-arts-florissants-rameau-maitre-a-danser-bam.html,"“A week ago I was dancing a bourrée,” the conductor William Christie said over the phone from Paris, where his baroque ensemble, Les Arts Florissants, is based. “A group of us sang a little song around the fire, and we all danced.” This impromptu dance erupted at the inauguration of a 17th-century fireplace in a house in the Loire that’s part of a complex where the Fondation Les Arts Florissants now resides. But it could almost describe a moment in the program his ensemble is bringing to the Brooklyn Academy of Music this week under the title “Rameau, Maître à Danser.” These works, too, were written to celebrate happy events — in one case, the birth of a king — and involved singing and dancing, in equal measure. The French court loved to dance, a passion that can be traced to Louis XIV, an avid dancer and a supporter of the creation of the Royal Academy of Dance, where the basic positions and movements of ballet were first codified. “Everyone danced in France,” the Baroque dance specialist Catherine Turocy said in a phone interview from her home in Dallas. “The singers danced, the dancers sang, and everyone played instruments. In that sense it was more like today’s musical theater.” All the 17th- and 18th-century French opera forms included dance, from the solemn tragédie lyrique to the lighter opera-ballets, the loose genre to which the works of “Rameau, Maître à Danser” belong. “Daphnis et Eglé” and “La Naissance d’Osiris” were composed for the court of Louis XV, to be performed at the palace of Fontainebleau, where the royal family (and much of the aristocracy) retired each fall in to enjoy the hunt. The two operas were performed in successive seasons — 1753 and 1754 — and seldom since, which is why Mr. Christie decided to revive them in 2014, on the 250th anniversary of the composer’s death. (The Brooklyn Academy’s production is the show’s American premiere.) Each about 45 minutes long, neither of the two works would have taxed the attention of the aristocratic audience with complicated plots or deep subjects. “The plots are essentially nonexistent,” Mr. Christie said. “It’s just exquisitely beautiful music, tender and melancholy, and fabulous for dancing.” There is just a whisper of a plot or, more accurately, a dramatic situation. In “Daphnis et Églé” (1753), a shepherd and a shepherdess approach the Temple of Friendship, only to be turned away, because, as Cupid points out to them, they are actually in love. In “Osiris,” shepherds and shepherdesses (notice a theme) await the birth of the god Osiris. (The piece, called a “ballet allégorique,” was meant to echo the birth of the future Louis XVI.) “It was my idea to make the two works into one story,” the director, Sophie Daneman explained from London, where she lives. “I thought, gosh, they’re very similar: They’re both incredibly pastoral, and in that sense, very human.” While the musical values of the Arts Florissants ensemble are faithful to what is known of the historical style, the dancing, like the staging, is more fluid. “There are elements and suggestions of period style,” Mr. Christie said, “but this has nothing to do with pure period staging.” Ms. Daneman noted that Mr. Christie “doesn’t have a strong philosophy on whether something should be ‘authentic.’ He’s more interested in authenticity of spirit.” In this spirit, the dances are not meant to replicate Baroque styles, though they do make reference to their vocabulary of small jumps, elegant footwork and decorative wrists. Originally choreographed by Françoise Denieau, who died in 2015, the dances are being restaged for this run by her assistant, Gilles Poirier. “For the most part,” Mr. Poirier said from Paris, Ms. Denieau “wanted to use a slightly later style of dance, closer to Noverre,” the ballet master who taught Marie Antoinette and the 19th-century Danish choreographer August Bournonville. (Bournonville enthusiasts will immediately spot the buoyant style.) She even included a moment that is closer to something like contemporary dance, using expansive and stylized gestures that Noverre could not have imagined. “Françoise wanted that part to be in a style that was more undefined,” Mr. Poirier said, “neither classical nor contemporary” as a way to evoke timelessness. In Ms. Daneman’s reimagined staging, the dancers and singers occupy the same world, taking turns at the center of the action. There are times when the dancers and singers interact, communicating through shared glances or touch. Mr. Christie conducts the ensemble of period instruments from the back of the stage, close to the singers and dancers. At one point, a musician becomes part of the action: A French bagpipe player slowly traverses the stage, surrounded by the entire cast. This leads into the final number, a contredanse, the French version of English country dancing. The dancers and singers form concentric circles, executing simple steps, weaving in and out. As in Mr. Christie’s celebratory bourrée by the fireside, everybody dances. Everybody sings. "
5c79a30c49f0eacbf105af15,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/01/arts/music/andre-previn-dead.html,"André Previn may well have been the last of the great 20th-century American musical eclectics, the artists who, in the heady post-World War II cultural moment, could — and did — have it all. Mr. Previn, who died on Thursday at 89, made a mark on Broadway and in Hollywood, on the classical concert stage and in the jazz club, in pop songs and violin concertos. [Read the Times obituary for Mr. Previn.] He did more than dabble: In all those many modes, he was always plausible, and often inspired. And he did more than merely perform. Like Leonard Bernstein, who Mr. Previn idolized and in some ways echoed, he was a great popularizer, a figure who gave the sense that it was possible to know about, and even love, everything — grand and intimate, high art and low. Figures like him are uniquely difficult to get your head — and ears — around. So writers for The New York Times have chosen a small sampling of the myriad angles of Mr. Previn and his dazzling career. When a young Mr. Previn conducted symphony orchestras, he was known to show the verve and boyish enthusiasm of a pop star. It balanced out the other way: Performing lighter fare on TV, he carried himself with a rarefied swagger. Witness it in this 1961 clip, as he performs syrupy arrangements from recent films he’s scored, including an easygoing “Bess, You Is My Woman Now” from “Porgy and Bess.” Mr. Previn cultivated a rakish, rebellious public image, but his most widely heard music sounded like the status quo. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO Mr. Previn may not have been a jazz innovator, but he was an alert and agile player. He turned “My Fair Lady” into a jazz recording, and brought out the swing in Doris Day. Even Dizzy Gillespie was a fan. “He has the flow, you know, which a lot of guys don’t have and won’t ever get,” Gillespie said. ZACHARY WOOLFE I discovered Mr. Previn’s easy-listening albums of the 1960s via that genre’s revival in the 1990s. His soundtrack for “Valley of the Dolls” remains a high-water mark — especially the theme, which he wrote with his second wife and regular collaborator, Dory Previn. The languid melody and arrangements wrap the aching lyrics in shimmery chiffon: This is the wistful sound of the other 1960s, when you realized dreams were not all they were cracked up to be. ELISABETH VINCENTELLI I once heard Mr. Previn talk self-deprecatingly about “working in a plantation called MGM Studios writing reams of music, which were kinds of encyclopedias of bad taste,” before he made the leap to the concert hall as a conductor and composer. So there is something charming about watching him conduct the London Symphony Orchestra in music a great composer originally wrote for film: Prokofiev’s “Lieutenant Kijé” Suite. Here Mr. Previn summons all the color and drive that has long made him one of my go-to conductors for recordings of Prokofiev’s ballets — especially “Romeo and Juliet” and my personal favorite, “Cinderella.” MICHAEL COOPER Some more Russian music, for which Mr. Previn had a special affinity: the finale of Shostakovich’s Symphony No. 5, in which he keeps the Chicago Symphony on a thrillingly tight leash that nevertheless allows for wondrous lyrical expansion. ZACHARY WOOLFE The end of the marriage between Mr. Previn and the violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter didn’t halt what had become a rich creative collaboration and close friendship. In a statement after his death, Ms. Mutter said that one of the first pieces he wrote for her, a violin concerto from 2001, was “an engagement present,” and the lush, sensitive orchestral writing lovingly shows off her rich tone, an elegant setting for a precious diamond. ZACHARY WOOLFE I’ll never forget hearing Mr. Previn in his jazz pianist mode, accompanying Renée Fleming in a recital at Alice Tully Hall in 2000. He backed her in songs by Arlen, Ellington and Van Heusen, and his playing was inventive, stylish and supremely musical. They also performed a remarkable song, “The Giraffes Go to Hamburg,” Mr. Previn’s setting of a rueful passage from an Isak Dinesen memoir about two captured giraffes on a cargo steamer bound for Hamburg. The song, which imaginatively adds a solo flute to the mix of voice and piano, is really an 11-minute dramatic monologue, rendered with harmonically tart, shifting and effectively understated music. ANTHONY TOMMASINI I can’t say I thought much of Mr. Previn’s operatic adaptation of “A Streetcar Named Desire” when it was new, in the late 1990s. But when I saw a semi-staged production in 2014 — starring Fleming, its original Blanche — it struck me as sensitive, articulate and sophisticated. “I Want Magic,” Blanche’s sumptuous dream of an aria, lent the title to Ms. Fleming’s memorable (if uneven) album of American opera arias.

SUSANA BACA at Sony Hall (Feb. 12, 8 p.m.). This 74-year-old Peruvian singer-songwriter started her career as an ethnomusicologist, specifically focusing on Afro-Peruvian culture. But when David Byrne featured her recording “Maria Lando” on his 1995 compilation “Soul of Black Peru,” she was thrust upon the international stage. Since, she has recorded six albums for his Luaka Bop label and won two Latin Grammys. Baca’s repertoire includes both traditional Peruvian songs and her own originals, but the sound is consistent thanks to her ensemble’s elegant acoustic instrumentation and her superlative, powerful voice. 212-997-5123, sonyhall.com ANITA BAKER at Radio City Music Hall (Feb. 13-14, 8 p.m.). At 61, this R&B legend concluded what was billed as her farewell tour in 2018 with a star-studded finale in September that included appearances by Stevie Wonder, Lalah Hathaway and Kelly Rowland. Thankfully for fans, she’s back with this two-night run at Radio City. The “Giving You the Best That I Got” singer’s roster of hits may have helped define the quiet storm era, which started in the 1970s, but at recent live shows, she has sounded as vital and captivating as ever. 212-465-6000, radiocity.com TALIB KWELI at the BRIC House Ballroom (Feb. 14, 8 p.m.). A Brooklyn native, this rapper gives an interesting spin to Valentine’s Day concerts: His is a love letter to his home borough. Brooklyn — specifically Park Slope, where Kweli grew up, and Fort Greene, where this concert will take place — has changed dramatically since he first rose to prominence in the late 1990s as half of Black Star, which he formed with the M.C. Yasiin Bey (then known as Mos Def), a fellow Brooklynite. Kweli’s message, though, has remained the same: He’s still using his technical mastery to push for social and political reform in Brooklyn and beyond. 718-683-5600, bricartsmedia.org [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] LIFE AND DEATH X SÓNAR at the Avant Gardner (Feb. 8, 10 p.m.). The influential electronic music label Life and Death is partnering with the Spanish festival Sónar to curate a night of D.J.s from around the world at this multiroom Brooklyn club. The lineup includes Life and Death’s co-founder, D.J. Tennis (a.k.a. Manfredi Romano), who specializes in techno; the Los Angeles-based producer Daedelus, who makes experimental electronic music; the London-based house D.J. Call Super; and the Israeli D.J. Mor Elian, whose recent work skews toward electro and ambient music. 347-987-3146, avant-gardner.com SARAH SHOOK & THE DISARMERS at the Knitting Factory (Feb. 14, 8 p.m.). With a rare combination of deft, classic country sounds and plain-spoken storytelling, Shook bucks both Nashville’s mainstream and the overly self-aware Americana scene. The twist comes from Shook’s unconventionally compelling voice, which is low, steady and a little nasal, recalling Appalachian yodeling but with a grungy edge. Plentiful slide guitar and a reliance on barn-dance-ready shuffle rhythms ground the songs in tradition, and the execution is sharp enough that the band’s old-school approach is convincing, a believable transformation of country’s vintage melancholy. 347-529-6696, knittingfactory.com SHARON VAN ETTEN at the Beacon Theater (Feb. 9, 8 p.m.). Van Etten’s new album, “Remind Me Tomorrow,” is receiving rave reviews, thanks in part to the New Jersey-bred singer-songwriter’s fairly dramatic stylistic shift. On her most recent releases, her confessional, poetic songs are bolstered by a slew of different electronic effects and synths instead of basic rock instrumentation. “I found that I was more drawn to the darkness and the driven synths and the syncopated beats,” she told The New York Times last month. The elaborate production, though, does little to obscure her music’s potent vulnerability.212-465-6000, beacontheatre.comNATALIE WEINER CLAUDIA ACUÑA at the Birdland Theater (through Feb. 9, 7 and 9:45 p.m.). Last week Acuña released “Turning Pages,” her first album in a decade and her first to consist of mostly original tunes. It finds the Chilean-born vocalist luxuriating in the breadth of her powers, whether covering Abbey Lincoln or unveiling her own compositions; she’s equal parts taut rhythm, flowing largess (think Cassandra Wilson in the 1990s) and sky-seeking mountain folk. Acuña performs songs from that album here with her band, featuring Juancho Herrera on guitar, Pablo Vergara on keyboard, Carlos Henderson on bass and Yayo Serka on drums.212-581-3080, birdlandjazz.com ITAMAR BOROCHOV at Nublu 151 (Feb. 13, 9 p.m.). An Israeli-born trumpeter, Borochov plays contemporary jazz that’s easy to enjoy. His melodies are direct and often plangent, his harmonies and rhythms sturdy and repetitious. His latest album, “Blue Nights,” draws together influences from the Middle East and North Africa with jazz-academy thinking. He performs here, using his signature quarter-tone trumpet (a custom instrument that allows him to play more fluidly in Middle Eastern modes), with Rob Clearfield on keyboard, Sam Weber on bass and Jay Sawyer on drums. The North African folk band Innov Gnawa, which was featured on one track on “Blue Nights,” will appear as special guests.nublu.net DEE DEE BRIDGEWATER at 92nd Street Y (Feb. 14, 7:30 p.m.). A recently minted National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master, Bridgewater is one of jazz’s most beloved straight-ahead veterans of the 1970s and ’80s, with a style that’s rooted in theater; she carries forth the storytelling legacies of Dinah Washington and Nancy Wilson. Her most recent album, “Memphis,” is a homage to the soul music of the city where she was born, but at this Valentine’s Day concert — joined by her typical backing trio of the pianist Carmen Staaf, the bassist Tabari Lake and the drummer Tyson Jackson — expect a more standard serving of romantic jazz fare.212-415-5500, 92y.org RUDRESH MAHANTHAPPA’S INDO-PAK COALITION at the Miller Theater (Feb. 9, 8 p.m.). Mahanthappa, an alto saxophonist, has been working with his Indo-Pak Coalition for long enough now that the group is starting to subtly outgrow the initial mission statement. They are no longer simply jazz improvisers combining musical traditions from across the Indian subcontinent. The trio — which also includes the guitarist Rez Abbasi and the drummer and tabla player Dan Weiss — has the restless, unboxable rapport of musicians broadly exploring musical sounds and strategies, with Indian classical as its launchpad.212-854-7799, millertheatre.com THUNDERCAT at the Blue Note (Feb. 12-14, 8 and 10:30 p.m.; through Feb. 17). Thundercat, a six-string-electric-bass wunderkind and merry prankster, might be the most hopelessly enjoyable artist currently making music in jazz’s crossover territory. He will do a six-night run in the coming week, welcoming a range of unannounced special guests throughout. Expect wry, hilarious non sequiturs muttered in between songs — like “Them Changes” and “Show You the Way” — that will be full of elastic funk grooves and blistering bass solos. Thundercat, whose birth name is Stephen Bruner, has been improving his vocal chops recently; his singing still has an unpretentious, conversational allure, but now there’s more body and breath behind it.212-475-8592, bluenote.net WING WALKER ORCHESTRA AND BRIAN KROCK’S LIDDLE at Threes Brewing Gowanus (Feb. 12, 8 p.m.). Led by the young multi-reedist Drew Williams, the Wing Walker Orchestra is about to release a remarkable debut album, “Hazel.” The music stays tightly woven, even as Williams switches up the grooves and harmonic palettes constantly; there’s almost always a sharp, biting cadence coming from some part of the band (though not necessarily the rhythm section). The group shares this bill with Liddle, a combo fronted by the alto saxophonist Brian Krock, playing music that draws in equal measure from Charlie Parker, Anthony Braxton and Battles — putting checkered rock rhythms underneath pelting, hard-edge melodies. 718-522-2110, threesbrewing.comGIOVANNI RUSSONELLO "
5cae2ec449f0eacbf1f8268c,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/10/arts/music/bruce-hornsby-absolute-zero-review.html,"One way for a songwriter to invigorate a long career is to keep breaking routines, to change up methods and parameters and solve different puzzles with every album. It’s a modus operandi that has carried Bruce Hornsby from radio hits in the 1980s through bluegrass, jazz, a stint in the Grateful Dead and, lately, collaborations with a younger-generation fan, Justin Vernon of Bon Iver. “Absolute Zero,” his 21st album, is one more daring, rewarding turn in his catalog: 10 knotty, thoughtful yet rambunctious songs that juggle scientific concepts, history and human relationships. “Absolute Zero” makes a 180-degree pendulum swing from Hornsby’s 2016 album, “Rehab Reunion.” On that record, Hornsby set aside the piano for songs built around the dulcimer, with basic folky harmonies and string-band-centered arrangements. “Absolute Zero,” in contrast, doubles down on piano virtuosity and musical intricacies: odd meters, polytonality, bustling counterpoint. In the new songs, Hornsby addresses a complex, distressing world with complex music, offering not an escape but a cleareyed recognition of 21st-century pressures and longings. In 2019, “Absolute Zero” is decisively untrendy. Its songs are dense, literate, hand-played and largely acoustic (though a collaboration with Vernon, a forlorn lover’s plaint titled “Cast-Off,” does slip in some electronics). Rather than build productions with synthetic sounds, for half of the album Hornsby brought in yMusic, the contemporary chamber sextet that has also worked lately with Paul Simon, and its violinist and arranger Rob Moose; other songs use string orchestras. Hornsby then juxtaposed the disembodied classical ensembles with sinewy little studio bands that can kick and swing in any meter. One of the puzzles Hornsby seems to have set for himself is seeing just how many pointillistic motifs he can set in motion without getting in the way of his voice. Ambition and exuberance merge in songs like “The Blinding Light of Dreams,” with pensive lyrics flung into complicated motion. “The Blinding Light of Dreams” reflects on the history of racism in the South, racing along on an insistent 13-note piano pattern and dodging dissonant interjections from yMusic. And “Voyager One” is a kind of multidimensional hoedown, with piano and yMusic meshing in overlapping riffs while Hornsby sings about space exploration and wonders if humanity will destroy itself before Voyager makes contact with other life-forms. “Let’s break out of our orbits, fix the world we all neglect/We share this little planet, our neighbors need respect,” he sings. Hornsby draws on science terms to get personal. In the title song of “Absolute Zero,” he imagines being cryogenically preserved for a century, awaiting “Another chance, maybe better next time”; sparse piano and sustained woodwinds suspend his voice as the drummer Jack DeJohnette pinpoints time still passing. In “Fractals,” Hornsby maps the infinitely replicating, mathematically generated chaos of fractals onto a romance: “Our love is a fractal/Curves and shapes irregular,” he sings. But first comes a brittle, two-handed, stop-start piano part that doesn’t quite establish a key or a beat. While he sings, percussion pecks at offbeats before settling into 4/4, while piano and pizzicato strings continue to pelt him with syncopation. Amid all the musical antics, Hornsby doesn’t lose perspective. The grain of his voice and his folky sense of melody still hold together all of the songs’ odd machinations. And midway through the album, he touches down on the kind of cozy, empathetic song that established him in the 1980s and continue to dot his albums. “Never in This House,” written with Chip DeMatteo, yearns for a stable family home where “all our problems disappear.” The piano is rich and hymnlike, the chamber ensemble is a supportive mini-orchestra; the music fulfills what the refrain — never in this house” — will not. It’s a brief point of repose on an album that thrives on its own restlessness. "
5c48f62e3a125f5075c05f76,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/23/arts/music/joes-pub-artists-in-residence.html,"The Public Theater on Wednesday announced the 2019 class of the Joe’s Pub Working Group, supporting five young performing artists whose careers are on the rise. This year’s honorees include the songwriter and performer Migguel Anggelo; the vocalist and composer Trevor Bachman; the comedian, playwright and performance artist Becca Blackwell; the saxophonist Yacine Boulares; and the singer-songwriter Treya Lam. Now in its fifth year, the Working Group functions as a residency for standout artists who have previously played at Joe’s Pub, a small performance space tucked inside the Public Theater in Lower Manhattan. All five artists receive a $4,000 stipend, but because their work ranges widely, additional services vary for each honoree. They include access to rehearsal space, assistance with video production and consultations with industry experts. “Joe’s Pub Working Group was created to help make the business of being an artist in New York a little easier,” Alex Knowlton, the director of Joe’s Pub, said in an email. “We’re interested in the working life of an artist and have seen so many common needs among the huge spectrum of performers here.” “For the last 20 years, we’ve watched communities naturally occur amongst musicians, performers, designers, writers and more, and made it our mission to make space for all voices, collaborations and connections,” he added. Anggelo, who was born in Venezuela, creates multilingual works that combine music, dance and poetry. Bachman often uses field research and interviews to create musicals and performances that reflect the life experiences of people across the country.  Blackwell’s work as a storyteller and actor confronts issues related to the transgender experience. Boulares is a French-Tunisian improviser and composer who combines influences from American jazz and across the globe. And Lam is a classically trained musician fusing elements of chamber music, country and pop. "
5c5af6773a125f5075c084d9,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/06/arts/music/grammy-awards-preview.html,"Year after year, I have dutifully watched the Grammy Awards. And the next morning, year after year, I have wondered why. I’ll be watching on Sunday, when the Grammys air on CBS, but with thoroughly limited expectations. The Grammy show strives each year to keep up with what just happened in music and to ameliorate its past errors. But after a while, blundering along just isn’t funny anymore. Awards shows are thankless at best; there are invariably complaints about omissions and honest disagreements over winners. Meanwhile, the demands of network television are by no means aligned with the dozens of Grammy Awards that recognize music’s less commercial genres along with the grunt work of making recordings. (The vast majority of the 84 Grammys are handed out in a live-streamed ceremony before the prime-time television spectacle, which only squeezes in about a dozen awards between live performances.) This year, the Recording Academy is atoning for an unforced error by its outgoing president, Neil Portnow, who ends his term in July. In 2018, he responded to a question about the lack of women receiving televised awards on the show, in line with harsh statistics about the Grammys’ historical lack of recognition for women, by saying that women need to “step up” — apparently oblivious to systemic barriers for women’s careers, not to mention overt harassment. (He later said he regretted his choice of words.) Sunday’s reparations include having the impeccable Alicia Keys as host and a performance by Diana Ross — who turns 75 on March 26 and who, in Grammy annals, was given a lifetime achievement award in 2012 after exactly zero wins either with the Supremes or in her solo career. Women also dominate the lineup of the show’s other announced performers and are well represented among the nominees for major awards. However, several of those are collaborations with men, like the Bradley Cooper-Lady Gaga duet “Shallow,” Maren Morris’s lead vocal on “The Middle” with Zedd and Grey, and Cardi B with Bad Bunny and J Balvin in “I Like It.” The top categories — record (for the artist, producers and engineers), song (for songwriters) and album of the year, along with best new artist — have also been expanded from five nominees to eight, an easy way for the Grammys to claim more diversity. Selections like those should make the statistics look more equitable in, perhaps, a few decades. Music is the most nimble of mass-audience art forms. Now it can be recorded alone on a computer and released immediately online, and it evolves fast, constantly pulling in ideas from the cultural margins, whether that’s beats from Caribbean sound systems or murky, disconsolate SoundCloud rap. The Grammys’ mandate is to sift through the welter of music released every year, rewarding merit and recognizing innovation (though not, strictly speaking, from the past year, but from the preceding Oct. 1 to Sept. 30, which can make some nominations seem ancient). The Recording Academy, the organization behind the Grammys, was modeled after the Oscars’ Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences: tabulating votes from industry pros, both artists and technicians, presumably to add up to informed choices. But history has not been kind to the Grammys’ winners for album of the year. In 1967, Frank Sinatra’s “A Man and His Music” beat the Beatles’ “Revolver.” In 1985, Lionel Richie’s “Can’t Slow Down” was chosen over Prince’s “Purple Rain,” Bruce Springsteen’s “Born in the U.S.A.,” Tina Turner’s “Private Dancer” and Cyndi Lauper’s “She’s So Unusual.” And last year, Bruno Mars won the top prize over more adventurous albums by Kendrick Lamar, Lorde, Jay-Z and Childish Gambino. Recording Academy voters have been reliably stodgy and ballad-loving, at best befuddled and at worst wrongheaded. It often seems that the Tin Pan Alley holdouts whose Grammy votes regularly pushed back against rock — as late as 1995, when Tony Bennett’s “MTV Unplugged” was album of the year (leading to ridicule and the creation of a “traditional pop” category) — have been replaced by rock holdouts who are still suspicious of hip-hop. The Grammys have recognized undeniable blockbusters by black performers, like Michael Jackson’s “Thriller” and Lauryn Hill’s “The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill.” But they have snubbed paradigm-shifters like Beyoncé’s “Lemonade” (which lost album of the year in 2017 to a more conventional pop megahit, Adele’s “25”). In 2014, Macklemore & Ryan Lewis won best new artist and best rap album over the clearly superior Kendrick Lamar. (Besieged by criticism, the Grammys repented; Lamar has gotten multiple awards and nominations since then, including this year for the “Black Panther” soundtrack album, and he was the show’s incendiary live opening performer in 2018.) The 61-year history of the Grammys is tied to the idea of network TV as a monoculture, and the show once presented a rare chance for millions of people to share a live musical performance. Assured of an audience, the Grammys of yesteryear often presented classical music and jazz — non-popular genres — that have disappeared from more current, metrics-driven iterations of the awards. The show is flashier now, and more determined to offer end-to-end pop-star power. But in the era of on-demand music video and proliferating cable channels, the Grammys have lost any clear role as America’s TV musical centerpiece. And if the initial idea of a prime-time network Grammy show was that multiple generations could share the full spectrum of music, it hasn’t worked out that way. Instead, the Grammys come off as the older generation scolding the young, the entrenched trying to rein in the newcomers. I have long had a rule of thumb that the album that includes the oldest songs wins: Norah Jones’s debut album, Herbie Hancock’s “River: The Joni Letters,” Natalie Cole’s “Unforgettable … With Love,” Eric Clapton’s “Unplugged,” the “O Brother, Where Art Thou?” soundtrack. (This year, Cardi B could benefit from the oldest-song effect; “I Like It” is built on a 1967 Pete Rodriguez boogaloo, “I Like It Like That.”) In recent years, the show has touted unique collaborations, “Grammy Moments,” that try to suggest musical and historical continuity between eras; this year promises Post Malone with the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Too often, though, Grammy Moments have meant fading elders performing alongside up-and-comers who learned their “influences” on the TelePrompTer. The Grammys still have some redeeming features. In the non-prime-time, non-pop categories, a Grammy win can help sustain a career. The broadcast provides glimpses of music history in its lifetime-achievement tributes — its version of community service. And even in an era when musicians play on television from morning shows into late nights, Grammy slots hold a little drama; ask Adele, who was sabotaged by tech ineptitude in 2016. Music-business strategists have long understood that a memorable prime-time performance pays off while award snubs are soon forgotten, and this year’s Grammys should be a bonanza for H.E.R., a slow-burn R&B singer who’s an unexpected contender for top prizes and who will be performing. So yes, I’ll be watching. I’ll even click onto the preshow awards, which will be punctuated by an international lineup of live music including Fatoumata Diawara and Natalia Lafourcade. Just don’t talk to me the morning after. "
5c4b46e13a125f5075c0659f,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/25/arts/music/verdi-papers-italy.html,"ROME — While working on “Otello” and “Falstaff,” his final two operas, the composer Giuseppe Verdi tucked dozens of pages of musical drafts and sketches into folders, scribbling on their covers: “Burn these papers.” Fortunately, his heirs never carried out those orders. But for years, scholars have complained that for all the access they had to them, those pages might as well have been lost. Locked in a trunk kept at the composer’s  home in Sant’Agata, in northern Italy, only select specialists were allowed to peruse them, mostly at the discretion of Verdi’s heirs. Academics grumbled that requests to study the papers went unanswered. “It was intolerable that scholars couldn’t easily get their hands on the material,” said Sandro Cappelletto, the editor of Studi Verdiani, the journal of the National Institute of Verdi Studies. “We had access to Rossini’s papers, Bellini’s papers. Why should 5,000 of Verdi’s papers remain unread?” For Verdi aficionados, the trunk — made in Chicago by Marshall Field & Company at the end of the 19th century — became a sort of Holy Grail. Rumors about its contents have been the stuff of legend. But on Tuesday, two years after the trunk was transferred by Italy’s Ministry of Culture from the Verdi villa to the state archive in the nearby city of Parma, at least some of those speculations will be laid to rest. Its contents are finally being made public. Locked inside the trunk were drafts and sketches for 12 operas written over nearly half a century, from “Luisa Miller” to “Falstaff,” as well as for works like the Requiem and “Four Sacred Pieces.” They have been cataloged and digitized and will be made accessible to scholars. Alessandra Carlotta Pellegrini, a musicologist who examined the contents, described the experience as getting a firsthand look into “the workshop of the composer.” The trunk contained more than 5,400 pages, around 600 of which are blank: a cornucopia of musical musings, stage directions, afterthoughts and reconsiderations, offering a glimpse into Verdi’s creative process at work “from the very first compositional gesture, where ideas are still fragmentary,” said Ms. Pellegrini, who became involved with the project when she was scientific director of the Verdi Institute. There are hundreds of pages related to “Aida,” “Otello” and “Falstaff,” for example — works whose “genesis has never been completely examined,” Ms. Pellegrini said. The sketches are central to understanding Verdi’s compositional process, she added. Various versions of Iago’s famous “Credo” suggest that it was pondered “arduously,” she said, while “Falstaff” fans will be intrigued by drafts Verdi discarded, like the first version of the opera’s fugue finale. One page, she said, included the scribblings of “an aged Verdi inscribing a passage from the Gospel.” Beyond music, she added, “there’s a life that emerges” from the papers, a lens into the composer’s humanity. They also reflect the passage of time. In the sketches for “Luisa Miller,” which premiered in 1849, Verdi’s handwriting is the “very ordered” writing of a young man, Ms. Pellegrini said, but it becomes “much looser” in the sketches for “Falstaff,” which had its premiere 44 years later. Many of the pages, she added, are difficult to read: “They’re mostly working drafts and sketches,” not intended for posterity. The varying quality of the paper — including porous, less valuable paper that Verdi probably used for initial drafts and more expensive sheets on which he jotted fuller musical sketches — could assist scholars in establishing a timeline of Verdi’s thoughts. “It’s an incredibly important” cache of documents, Mr. Cappelletto, the Studi Verdiani editor, said, which will be “essential for future critical editions.” Verdi’s heirs, the Carrara Verdi family, are less enthusiastic about the trunk’s notoriety, and even less so about the removal from the villa by the culture ministry of another cache of documents — around 24,000, including letters and sundry papers — after experts determined that the family was not preserving them correctly. Those papers are now being held in sealed boxes at the state archive in Parma. The Verdi villa was never widely open, but scholars complained that under the family’s stewardship, it was far too difficult to access documents — despite the fact that Verdi’s papers were declared of public interest in 2008, and as such had to be made available to the public. The culture ministry took the trunk from the villa in January 2017, partly in response to the complaints. There is no substitute for original documents, said Fabrizio Della Seta, a professor of music at the University of Pavia in Cremona, who oversaw the critical edition of “La Traviata” 20 years ago. Access is “indispensable,” he said, and “must be guaranteed.” Angiolo Carrara Verdi, one of the composer’s heirs and the Villa Verdi’s current caretaker, declined to be interviewed. Officials at the culture ministry who oversaw the transfer of the papers, as well as ministry officials at local archives, also declined to comment. Francesco Izzo, the general editor of the critical edition of Verdi’s works, noted that despite the myth surrounding the trunk, its contents hadn’t been a complete mystery. A number of musicologists and scholars have studied individual folders, and, in 2015, Classic Voice, an Italian music magazine that campaigned for access to the documents, published a summary of the contents. “We already had a fairly clear sense of the contents of this trunk,” said Mr. Izzo. But, he added, “we can now build and improve our knowledge even further.” "
5c9cb79e49f0eacbf105f82a,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/28/arts/music/wagner-ring-cycle-metropolitan-opera.html,"True to form, an autocratic executive wrapping up a real estate deal is trying to wiggle out of paying contractors. The project, a gleaming, fortified executive residence and business headquarters, is a veritable castle in the sky. His idea was to get all his subordinates — including his aggrieved wife, obsequious family members and a dirty trickster — under one roof so he can better control them as he continues enhancing his dominion and power. Sound familiar? Not so fast. It’s actually the gist of Wagner’s “Ring” cycle, which the Metropolitan Opera is presenting — in a retooled revival of Robert Lepage’s intensely-debated production of the four-opera epic — through May 11. Since the first complete “Ring” production inaugurated the Bayreuth Festival in Germany in 1876, Wagner’s saga has been milked for its perceived politics. Early audiences saw echoes of revolutionary currents that had swept 19th-century Europe. The work was soon seized upon to support various ideological agendas: a Marxist narrative of class struggle; an allegory of environmental degradation at the hands of rapacious industrialists; a multigenerational drama about a dysfunctional royal family. The “Ring” has also been viewed as a cautionary tale of a power-hungry ruler — or mogul — who goes too far. Modern stagings that present Wagner’s flawed hero, the god Wotan, as if he were the chief executive of the Valhalla Corporation have become almost commonplace. In this divisive moment in American politics, the “Ring” may feel newly relevant, epitomized by Michael Cohen, the former lawyer for President Trump, pointing to himself during recent congressional hearings, warning of what can happen when you are dazzled by power. For one, the “Ring” depicts a world that functions through a codified system of checks and balances and agreed-upon norms. Wotan, though the head god and patriarch, is not all-powerful. He must contend with a sort of cabinet of sub-gods with their own areas of authority. But he has stacked his regime with cronies and has brazenly flouted the standards and protocols meant to rein in executive overreach. It’s a crucial plot element, and not simply a costume accouterment, that Wotan carries with him at all times a staff that has the runes (the codes of his realm, like the articles of a constitution) carved into the wood — a symbol, and perhaps the source, of his power. Of course, this imperious ruler cites a particular rune when it serves him and simply ignores those that prove inconvenient. Another strand of the myth that may leap out today concerns the way the personal becomes the political in the life of a ruler like Wotan. The “Ring” has been interpreted as an allegory about the relationship between power and love, and the difficulty of obtaining both in one’s life. That’s the way I see it. It’s crucial that the secret to the magic gold the three Rhinemaidens keep safe in the depths of the river involves a choice, in effect, between power and love: Anyone who renounces love and takes the gold can fashion a ring from it and become master of the universe. Wotan craves both power and love, a tension that plays out poignantly in his relationship with Fricka, his exasperated (and childless) wife. But it’s Alberich the dwarf who acts first. There are eerie resonances, too, in how Wotan and Alberich, opposing characters, become obsessed with the ring. Alberich literally stumbles upon the magic gold when he makes advances at the Rhinemaidens, who find him laughably hideous. Rebuffed and humiliated, he steals the gold in an I’ll-show-you-all act of vengeance. But Wotan, who has heard of the gold and its power, was content to leave it be, until the moment when we meet him in “Das Rheingold.” Now he needs to pay his contractors. And beyond that, once he learns what Alberich has done, Wotan feels threatened. He must get his hands on that ring, on that power — whatever the cost to his governing legitimacy and personal life. You may also find one other theme uncomfortably familiar: heads of state near and far granting governing authority to family members. Having made a hash of things and violated the very codes he had sworn to uphold, Wotan must somehow make corrections. Knowing that his own hands are tied, he fathers children hoping that one of his descendants (perhaps the hero who has been prophesied) might take over his domain and, exercising free will, right his wrongs, while still maintaining power. But it doesn’t look good. His narcissistic greed and power grabs have caused havoc in the world. The ring (now in possession of the giant Fafner) is cursed; the natural order has been disrupted; the only hope of averting the inevitable global calamity (which brings to mind climate change) is for the ring to be returned to the river. Since Wotan also craves knowledge — knowledge is power, after all — he pursues Erda, the all-knowing earth goddess, who comes to warn him about what will ensue if he keeps on his heedless and destructive path. They end up having nine daughters together, and he raises the girls as Valkyrie warriors to do his bidding. But only Brünnhilde, his favorite, seems to know his mind. “Who am I if not your will?” she asks in an intimate moment when Wotan seems troubled. What follows is the rare confessional scene among numerous tales of fearsome, all-powerful fathers, when Wotan tells Brünnhilde the woeful story of how he has broken the covenants and mismanaged his life. This aspect of the “Ring” always reminds me of the scene in “The Godfather” in which the ailing Vito Corleone confides in Michael, his trusted son. “I never wanted this for you,” Vito says. He had hoped that, after lawlessly building an empire, by this point he would have given the family business a legitimate veneer and groomed an heir who could prevail within the establishment. Senator Corleone? Governor Corleone? “We’ll get there, Pop,” Michael replies. By the end of the “Ring” cycle, the immutable forces have won out, just as Erda foretold. The game is up and Wotan must face the inevitable. We learn that he has piled branches from the world tree around his crumbling castle, where he glumly awaits the end. Sure enough, as if doing her father’s bidding, Brünnhilde, who has been through hell, sparks a self-immolating fire that consumes the castle and its godly inhabitants. The cautionary moral seems clear: If you blaze a path to power, the flames may well consume you. The river floods the ashes and reclaims the ring. For better or worse, humans will have to go forward without the gods. The governing codes of conduct that were shattered will be restored. Or will they? That very question is roiling Washington as the “Ring” plays out at the Met. "
5cb112eb49f0eacbf1f83976,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/12/obituaries/james-winn-dead.html,"James A. Winn, whose scholarly writings on Queen Anne, John Dryden and other subjects showed the influence of his side interest as a professional-caliber flutist, died on March 21 at his home in Brattleboro, Vt. He was 71. His son, Philip, said the cause was pancreatic cancer. Professor Winn, who taught most recently at Boston University, was interested in a wide range of topics. His book subjects also included Alexander Pope’s letters and the poetry of war. He wrote essays on Bach and on the Beatles. In all of that work, he sought to expand the often narrow scope of academic inquiry. His 2014 biography, “Queen Anne: Patroness of Arts,” for instance, examined that British monarch’s often discounted reign (1702-1714) through the lens of the cultural offerings of the period. “James was always from the beginning interested in interdisciplinary things,” Robert Freeman, former director of the Eastman School of Music, who advised Professor Winn when he was a student at Princeton, said in a telephone interview. “He believed that the academic world tends to isolate itself into a bunch of silos.” Professor Winn himself was certainly not a silo-dweller; when he wasn’t teaching English or writing about the Restoration, he was performing with orchestras or small ensembles, or working on a recording. “He could easily have been the principal flutist of a major orchestra,” Dr. Freeman, a longtime friend, said, “but I don’t think that interested him.” What did interest him was applying the perspective he had as a musician to his scholarship, which he did most particularly in a 1998 book, “The Pale of Words.” There he argued for research and teaching that took into account more than just the written word. “Much of what humanists study originates in performance, and all good teaching ought to be alert to the living excitement of arts and ideas,” he wrote. His best-known book, “John Dryden and His World,” had come out 11 years earlier. Pat Rogers,  in The New York Times Book Review, called it “the most important biography of Dryden ever written.” In the book, Professor Winn lamented that Dryden, the poet, critic and playwright of the Restoration period, was underappreciated, something he thought could be remedied by “removing the prejudices and simplifications about his culture that keep our ears from hearing his mighty music.” Dr. Rogers thought the book succeeded in doing just that. “He challenges us to rethink our stereotyped notions of a Puritanism that is hostile to art, or of a monolithic ‘Restoration culture’ that is all rakes, prostitutes and Pepysian encounters in the playhouse,” the review said. James Anderson Winn was born on July 31, 1947, in Charlotte, N.C. His father, Albert, was a Presbyterian minister and theologian, and his mother, Grace Walker Winn, was an educator. Albert Winn’s ministry and teaching posts took him to several Southern cities during James’s childhood. Music was part of the household. “When my great-uncle Dwight died,” Professor Winn wrote in an unpublished memoir, “my parents received a small bequest, which they used to buy a piano rather than a television, a great decision for all.” James sang and played ukulele from a young age. He started playing flute in the sixth grade, choosing the instrument, his son said, because Albert Winn still had the flute he had played in high school, making it the most affordable option. In 1960 the family moved to Louisville, Ky., and Professor Winn was able to study the flute with Francis Fuge, the principal flutist of the Louisville Symphony. He graduated from Atherton High School in Louisville in 1964. Years later, in a 1988 interview with The Times — when Professor Winn, then teaching at the University of Michigan, had just published the Dryden biography — he commented on how being raised in the South, with its rich history, had influenced him. “We grew up with a very large sense of the past,” he said. “What I found attractive about the age of Dryden and Pope at the time I fell in love with it was that it seemed to me old and fine, elegant and polished, complex in ways that I didn’t then understand — and don’t now.” Professor Winn attended Princeton, where Dr. Freeman, then a junior faculty member there, encouraged him to continue studying music even as he pursued an English degree. He performed with the university orchestra and even sang with the Footnotes, an a cappella group of which he was also music director. He received a bachelor’s degree in 1968, then spent two years in the Army, playing flute in the Continental Army Band. He received a Ph.D. from Yale in 1974, writing his dissertation on Pope’s letters, a subject he turned into his first book, “A Window in the Bosom,” in 1977. Professor Winn taught at Yale from 1974 to 1983, then went to the University of Michigan, where he was founding director of its Institute for the Humanities. Professor Winn’s father, who was active in the civil rights movement, published a book in 1993 called “Ain’t Gonna Study War No More: Biblical Ambiguity and the Abolition of War,” and in 2008 Professor Winn took up a related area in “The Poetry of War.” “Like the ocean, great fires, and destructive storms,” he wrote in that book, “war is attractive to poets as an instance of the sublime, an experience bringing together awe, terror, power, and reverence on a grand scale.” His biography of Queen Anne, his most recent book, had an unusual appendage: He tracked down 28 pieces of music from her time, arranged with some of his musician acquaintances to record them and set up a website where readers of the book, using a password, could hear them. Professor Winn’s marriage to Kathe Fox ended in divorce in 1994. In addition to his son, he is survived by another child from that marriage, Ellen Winn; by his wife, Lucy Chapman, whom he married in 2009; and by four grandchildren. Professor Winn joined the Boston University faculty in 1998, taking emeritus status in 2017. He was director of the university’s Center for the Humanities from 2008 to 2016. He performed and recorded with other members of the faculty, including the pianist David Kopp. In his final months, he was editing a recording by the two of them of Bach, Schubert and Fauré. In a blog he had been keeping on CaringBridge.org, he told friends and family members on Feb. 25 that the CDs were ready. On that same blog last June, he wrote of attending his 50th college reunion at Princeton. “I got together with those classmates who were in my a cappella group, the Footnotes,” he wrote, “rehearsed them as rigorously as I could, and directed a small and satisfying arch-sing with six members of the class of 1968 and two guests from adjacent classes. Small spaces have pitches, and we sang in an arch that resonates to B-flat. The sound when we reached a cadence in that key was wonderful.” "
5cb0f75949f0eacbf1f8388a,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/12/obituaries/sam-pilafian-dead.html,"Sam Pilafian, a virtuoso tuba player who performed an eclectic mix of classical, jazz, pop and rock music and brought unflagging exuberance to teaching young tubists, died on April 5 at his home in Tempe, Ariz. He was 69. His wife, Diann (Jezurski) Pilafian, said the cause was colon cancer. As a busy soloist, a founding member of the influential Empire Brass quintet and a partner to the acoustic guitarist Frank Vignola in the jazz group Travelin’ Light, Mr. Pilafian expanded the musical possibilities of his lumbering instrument. “He’s easily the best tuba player I’ve ever played with,” the trumpeter Charles Lewis, another original member of Empire Brass, said by telephone. “He could do everything — play all kinds of music — and he could light up a room.” Mr. Pilafian, a natural entertainer, was once nicknamed the Evel Knievel of the Tuba for daringly playing “The Clarinet Polka” while standing on his head. He also tried teaching the tuba to Fred Rogers on an episode of “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood” in 1985. “You have to blow through buzzing lips,” Mr. Pilafian told Mr. Rogers. After creating a sound, Mr. Rogers said, “Your lips tickle.” Mr. Pilafian tickled his lips during more than 40 years of diverse collaborations. He played with the singers Bernadette Peters and Barbara Cook; the Duke Ellington and Lionel Hampton orchestras; the ensemble on the Philip Glass album “Koyaanisqatsi” (1982); the New York Philharmonic and the Boston Symphony Orchestra, as a substitute or soloist; and Pink Floyd, on the 1979 album “The Wall.” “I did a lot of studio work back then,” Mr. Pilafian told The St. Louis Post-Dispatch in 1990, discussing his work on “The Wall.” “I had always studied jazz, so when I got to New York, I just ended up doing a lot of rock ’n’ roll.” Recalling his work with the trumpeter Lew Soloff and the trombonist James Pugh, he added, “When they combined our sound, they sweetened it so my tuba actually sounds more like a French horn on the album.” But Mr. Pilafian is best known for his work with Empire Brass, whose repertoire includes Renaissance and Baroque music, transcriptions of classical works, show tunes, Christmas songs and pieces composed for the quintet. It has released more than two dozen recordings. Empire Brass embraces the classic brass quintet configuration — a pair of trumpets, French horn, trombone and tuba — and has long been known for its virtuosity and showmanship. “You have not often heard an ensemble that played with more gusto than this one,” the New York Times music critic Donal Henahan wrote of an Empire recital in 1977. “Individual notes were hit in the center and chords were blended with the transparency that comes from exact corporate intonation. Phrases, even at dashing tempos, were lyrical and supple. Balances were perfectly achieved without any obtrusive effort.” Mr. Vignola recalled being a guest artist at a recording session with Empire Brass in the early 1990s when the producer asked him to make a jazz record with Mr. Pilafian. “Travelin’ Light,” the first of several albums they made, helped start them off as a touring duo. “Who would have thought, a jazz tuba and an acoustic guitar?” Mr. Vignola said in a telephone interview from Sweden, where he was performing. “We were an odd couple, but our act went over. Sam was a great entertainer and, like Louis Armstrong, broke all the rules.” James Samuel Pilafian was born on Oct. 25, 1949, in Miami. His father, James, was a lawyer, and his mother, Rosa (Boyajian) Pilafian, known as Shocky, was a paralegal in her husband’s firm and managed their commercial properties. Sam played the accordion as a youngster. But he switched instruments at 11 on the advice of a veteran tubist, who told him that if he played tuba he would always have friends. He was a quick study and within a few years had joined the musicians union and was playing in hotel orchestras that backed headliners like Frank Sinatra and Liza Minnelli, and in a six-piece Dixieland band that performed at racetracks and other places around Miami. While attending what is now the Frost School of Music at the University of Miami, where he earned a bachelor’s degree, he had a summer fellowship at the Tanglewood Music Center for advanced music training in Lenox, Mass. His tuba playing impressed Leonard Bernstein, who was an adviser there, and who enlisted him in the orchestra for the premiere of his theatrical work “Mass” at the opening of the Kennedy Center in Washington in 1971. Tanglewood was also the birthplace of Empire Brass. Michael Tilson Thomas, the music director of the San Francisco Symphony, was then a conducting student at Tanglewood. He told Bernstein that the five brass instrumentalists “should begin playing together because we sound alike, although we had never met,” Mr. Pilafian told The Post-Dispatch. “So we did,” he added, “and we became a rehearsal band, getting together just to rehearse.” He remained with the group for 22 years, leaving in 1993. Mr. Pilafian, whose tuba mentors included Arnold Jacobs, the longtime former principal tubist of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, was also a teacher for many years. He held positions at Boston University, Berklee College of Music, the Tanglewood Institute, Arizona State University and the Frost School. He and a fellow tubist, Patrick Sheridan, developed a series of exercises adapted from martial arts and yoga to help singers and wind and brass players breathe more effectively. “My teaching philosophy has always been predicated on catching students doing something right,” he told the magazine The Brass Herald  in 2013. The tubist Andrew Hitz recalled being a shy 14-year-old at Tanglewood in the summer of 1990 when Mr. Pilafian eased his fears. “I could play as well as anybody, but I was scared and in tears,” Mr. Hitz said by telephone. “But Sam was able with me, and countless others, to insulate us from criticism and make us feel you were safe, while challenging the hell out of you. The gift he gave me is that I never again questioned whether I belonged with any musicians.” In addition to his wife, Mr. Pilafian is survived by his sons, Alexander Sarkis Pilafian and Zev Levin-Pilafian, and his sisters, Marni Pilafian and Nerisa Gay Pilafian. When Mr. Pilafian was in college, he was determined to do whatever was necessary to elevate his musicianship. So he tried an experiment with a friend, Mike Gerber, a blind pianist, he told NDSU Magazine in 2017, when he was a visiting artist at North Dakota State University. Fascinated by Mr. Gerber’s heightened sense of hearing, Mr. Pilafian bandaged his own eyes. He was disoriented that first day but felt that his hearing had noticeably improved after three days. On Day 4, he concluded that his listening had grown dramatically acute, and he could play back whatever Mr. Gerber played on the piano. “Nothing was the same after that,” he said. "
5caf8a8249f0eacbf1f82ff8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/arts/music/lil-nas-x-old-town-road-country-rap.html,"Over the last few weeks, “Old Town Road” — a strutting and lightheartedly comedic country-rap tune by the previously unknown 20-year-old rapper Lil Nas X — has lived an improbable number of lives. It began as a Hail Mary pass by a college dropout hoping music might save him from having to go back to school. But in the way that the internet can rapidly make and remake something, morphing meaning in real time, Lil Nas X’s track became something different almost every few days on its path from SoundCloud obscurity to pop ubiquity: a savvy troll, a manipulator of streaming algorithms, a meme theme, a battering ram to genre barriers, a trigger of music-biz discord, a David suffering at the hands of Goliath, a sociocultural rallying point, and eventually, a site of cross-cultural kumbaya. [Listen to a history of country-rap in 29 songs.] And now, it’s likely to be one of the most emblematic songs of the year: On April 8, “Old Town Road” became the No. 1 song in the country, capping a startling ascent that demonstrates what can happen when viral engineering meets lightning-rod controversy meets the pop uncanny. For its first 25 seconds, “Old Town Road” could be any other rural lament, a lonely howl delivered over a plucked ukulele. It’s only when the trap drums kick in and the vocals change from singing to quasi-ironic rapping that the song’s true intentions come to the fore. It’s a genre-hybrid exercise — a hip-hop song with country-themed subject matter, partly rapped and partly sung in an exaggerated honky-tonk accent — and also a comedy sketch. The way Lil Nas X overaccentuates his vowels and makes them wobble is a caricature of stoic drawl, and when he raps “cowboy hat from Gucci, Wrangler on my booty,” it’s both confident boast and funny fantasy. It’s also a neat distillation of how genre is currently lived in American pop music: fluidly, with styles and ideas up for grabs by creators and easily slipped on and off by listeners, with varying degrees of sincerity. Pop, more than ever, is an identity playground. [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] But the particular alchemy of “Old Town Road” also taps something deeper: more than two decades of dialogue between country music and hip-hop, genres that have been slowly but consistently finding common heritage, swapping structural elements and taking comfort in each other’s sounds. But the industry’s gatekeepers are less interested in this mutability. For decades, Nashville has essentially framed and marketed the rural experience as white — despite and in defiance of the deep black roots of country music. So when an artist like Lil Nas X — who is black, and raps, and is from Atlanta, with no ties to the country music business — lays claim to rural aesthetics, even in a way that’s partly tongue in cheek, it causes real disruption. In late March, “Old Town Road” appeared on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart before it was removed for being deemed insufficiently country, causing a furor. But resistance led to embrace: a remix of the song featuring Billy Ray Cyrus, which in turn has been played by some country radio stations, which helped the song land on Billboard’s Country Airplay chart. “Old Town Road” — the original or the remix — is by no means the first country-rap crossover. There have been collaborations across genre lines, like Nelly and Tim McGraw’s “Over and Over”; songs in which country singers rap, like Jason Aldean’s “Dirt Road Anthem” and Blake Shelton’s “Boys ’Round Here”; and performances that are fully genre flexible, like Sam Hunt’s “Take Your Time.” And hip-hop has flirted with country signifiers on and off since the 1980s, whether it was the fringe-outfitted rapper Cowboy from the Furious Five, or Kool Moe Dee’s — and later, Will Smith’s — excursion to the “Wild Wild West.” By the 1990s, Southern rap was flourishing, providing a platform for ideas, accents and sounds that weren’t part of hip-hop from the coasts. Crooked Lettaz from Mississippi, 8Ball & MJG from Tennessee, UGK from Texas and many more emphasized drawling flows and production that leaned toward Southern soul and sometimes blues. Around the turn of the century, a pair of young white rappers, Bubba Sparxxx and Colt Ford, were beginning to work with Shannon Houchins, a producer in the Atlanta rap innovator Jermaine Dupri’s camp. Houchins would go on to produce most of “Dark Days, Bright Nights,” Sparxxx’s independent debut album, which got him signed to the major label Interscope and partnered with the producer Timbaland, who steered country-rap to its first big breakthrough moment: Sparxxx’s single “Ugly,” a hip-hop and pop hit with a video that included a pig sty and a tractor race, and went to No. 15 on the Billboard Hot 100. Sparxxx’s follow-up album, “Deliverance,” was a stunning and elegant cross-genre statement radically unlike anything that had preceded it. It made less of a broad impact, but in the wake of Sparxxx’s innovations came a wave of artists who effectively identified as country rappers focused on rural storytelling and signifiers — growing up far from cities, partying at mud bogs and so on. The seeds were also planted for what was to be Nashville’s first extended flirtation with hip-hop. Kid Rock, an early white rapper, remade himself as a country-rock rapper-singer. Tim McGraw partnered with Nelly on “Over and Over,” a road ballad that went to No. 3 on the Hot 100 in 2004. Kenny Rogers collaborated with both Wyclef Jean and Coolio. Even Willie Nelson appeared on a hip-hop song. And in Nashville, the MuzikMafia emerged, a polyglot group of performers that included the singing duo Big & Rich and the rapper Cowboy Troy, who collaborated on several songs, including the single “I Play Chicken With the Train,” which in 2005 became the first country-rap song to land on the Billboard Country Songs chart. These were outliers, or novelties — brief successes that Nashville tolerated but didn’t wholeheartedly embrace. But at around the same time, Houchins teamed up with Ford to form Average Joes Entertainment, a record label devoted to the intersection of country and rap centered on white rural experiences, with a growing stable of burly gool-ol’-boy rappers — “hick-hop,” it was occasionally called — operating largely outside the country music mainstream, though Ford regularly collaborated with the genre’s stars. [A godfather of country-rap on his 2000s hits and Lil Nas X.] By the early 2010s, Nashville was in search of raw energy. The music became more rural, rougher at the edges and more willing to flaunt a range of influences. These younger singers — Jason Aldean, Luke Bryan — often made it plain that hip-hop was as much of their musical heritage as country or Southern rock. That lineage was cemented when, in 2010, Aldean covered “Dirt Road Anthem,” a song originally recorded by Ford and Brantley Gilbert; his version went to No 1. on the country chart and No. 7 on the Hot 100. It opened the floodgates — Blake Shelton rapped a little, Bryan danced to hip-hop songs onstage, the duo Florida Georgia Line built a career on importing just the faintest hint of hip-hop percussion and slang. Their song “Cruise” became one of the biggest hits of 2013, bolstered by a remix featuring, who else, Nelly. That there’s a splash of hip-hop coursing through country (its male performers, at least) is now fundamentally accepted, but always with the country performer — and the country music business — in control of just how much. Nothing, though, is immune from the force and urgency of the meme economy, and Lil Nas X has demonstrated himself to be a master of how to pachinko his way from the margins to the mainstream. “Old Town Road” began on SoundCloud, where he tagged it as country to avoid competing with the hip-hop heavyweights that dominate the platform. Once it began to get noticed, he pushed it heavily on TikTok, the short-performance-clip app, where it was the soundtrack to thousands of videos. The track also arrived at a fortuitous moment — on the heels of a trickle of Western aesthetics into the high-style universe over the last couple of years, and also following the success of stylistically diverse country performers like Kacey Musgraves, who have demonstrated that a country musician can be a beacon of cool far outside the genre’s walls. Even Kanye West recently took to the countryside, unveiling his last album at a Wyoming cowboy ranch. In another moment, the aesthetic choices of “Old Town Road” might have been perceived as pure kitsch, but now they are kitsch with a side of tastemaker. And though the removal of the song from the country chart reflected an initial resentment, the mood soon switched. Some country singers said they found “Old Town Road” to be country, or country enough. They didn’t want to be on the wrong side of cool. Billy Ray Cyrus, who joined the song’s remix, is not a country insider at the peak of his powers, but he’s still a performer with a great deal of resonance within Nashville thanks to his 1992 pop-country crossover smash “Achy Breaky Heart.” Cyrus’s “Old Town Road” verse is pure glitz, a blend of hip-hop braggadocio and country-boy-in-the-big-city awe: “Spent a lot of money on my brand-new guitar/Baby’s got a habit, diamond rings and Fendi sports bras/Ridin’ down Rodeo in my Maserati sports car.” The performance is effortless, showing a version of country music that’s cosmopolitan, flexible and self-aware. Whether Cyrus’s co-sign will be enough for the industry side of Nashville to embrace “Old Town Road” remains to be seen. That’s because, when it comes to charts and common practices, country isn’t a genre or a set of sounds as much as it is an oligarchy, the product of a limited number of record labels; a media environment that relies heavily on radio (with programmers who can lack imagination, as female country performers have long known); and a profound bottleneck in terms of new talent and new ideas. (To be fair, country is not alone in this: In 2012, the K-pop novelty star Psy went to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Rap Songs chart with “Gangnam Style,” which was — and remains — one of the biggest viral YouTube songs in history, but was by no means a rap song in the American context.) Nashville’s initial resistance suggests some unfortunate things about country as a genre: that it might not be able to make fun of itself; that it might look askance at outsiders, especially black performers; that it understands itself only through the lens of protecting its central ideology, and not as an omnivorous sound in dialogue with the rest of pop, and the rest of America. Country music is preoccupied with borders, and it treats each new incursion as an opportunity for identity crisis. It’s a wild contrast with contemporary hip-hop, which understands itself as music that borrows widely, and experiments with glee. But perhaps the greatest indictment of how the country music leadership handled “Old Town Road” comes from a cursory listen to some other songs on the chart. Take “Look What God Gave Her,” the new single by Thomas Rhett, perhaps the ur-country gentleman of the last few years. It’s a soft soul song with a faint disco undertow, nothing country about it beyond the perceived affiliation of the performer. Elsewhere there are soft-rock ballads and R&B songs, none of them subject to anything like the skepticism that has greeted Lil Nas X, whose reference points might in fact be more classically country (even if refracted through a kitsch lens). Which means that the Lil Nas X controversy boils down to a conversation about who is entitled to lay public claim to Southern tropes that country music believes it has monopolized (but in truth, has been less and less reliant on in recent years). That it’s happening at a moment featuring more black country music performers than any in recent memory — Darius Rucker, Kane Brown, Jimmie Allen, Mickey Guyton and many more — is especially discouraging. On its own terms, “Old Town Road” has been a wild success. And when it comes the music business’s terms, well, that’s being reverse engineered. Following the Cyrus remix, Lil Nas X teased another with Young Thug. In truth, “Old Town Road” isn’t quite fully country or hip-hop, at least not in the ways those genres taxonomize themselves. It’s something far more slippery, slithering between the two spaces and arriving at pop novelty. This is where songs that have been disowned by their ostensible homes but provide uncomplicated pleasure often land — embraced widely even as they’re kept at arms length locally. But it is too potent to remain that way. It certainly won’t be long before some country singers incorporate it into their live sets. Country stations are beginning to play the song, which serves as a kind of proxy for acceptance. And indeed, Billboard recently announced that it might revisit its decision to include “Old Town Road” on its main country chart — after all, country is as country allows itself to be. "

AMEN DUNES at Warsaw (Feb. 1, 9 p.m.). To rehash bluesy rock in a way that’s genuinely compelling is a serious challenge, but Damon McMahon, frontman of Amen Dunes, has found his own way down that oft-trodden path. Especially on the band’s latest album, “Freedom,” there’s a refreshing restraint to their work, stripping away most of rock’s maximalism in favor of gentle, reverb-laden riffs that spotlight McMahon’s distinctive, ever-so-slightly wavering voice. The result is pleasant, mild chaos with enough familiar sounds to be an easy listen. The electronic artist Arthur opens. 212-777-6800, mercuryeastpresents.com/warsawconcerts TONI BRAXTON at Kings Theater (Feb. 7, 8 p.m.). This R&B titan takes over the cavernous theater in Flatbush, Brooklyn, for a show that has long been sold out (though tickets are available via resellers). Braxton specializes in dramatic, emotional epics, songs that are practically operatic in scope; her most enduring hit is “Un-Break My Heart,” a sweeping power ballad. Most remarkable, though, is that Braxton’s style has remained constant in spite of shifting R&B trends. Her 2018 album “Sex & Cigarettes,” a collection of cathartic, unrelenting songs about infidelity, earned three Grammy nominations. The trio SWV, responsible for chart toppers such as “Weak” and “Right Here,” will also perform. 718-856-5464, kingstheatre.com ESTELLE at Baby’s All Right (Feb. 6, 8 p.m.). This British singer’s 2008 major-label debut is best known for its smash hit “American Boy,” which features Kanye West as her raffish suitor. The release had another minor hit, though: “Come Over,” a pop-reggae song featuring Sean Paul. Estelle, whose father is from Grenada, revisited reggae and dancehall on her most recent record, 2018’s “Lover’s Rock” — a tribute to the buoyant, romantic British reggae subgenre that goes by the same name. The album, released on the legendary reggae label VP Records, features heavy hitters including Chronixx, Tarrus Riley and Konshens. 718-599-5800, babysallright.com SHAMIR at Brooklyn Bazaar (Feb. 2, 8 p.m.). Pinning a genre to this singer-songwriter from Las Vegas is challenging. His 2015 debut, “Ratchet,” is eclectic synth-pop with 1980s flair; his latest, last year’s “Resolution,” is stripped-down indie rock that includes songs like “I Can’t Breathe,” which focuses on police killings, and “The Things You Loved,” which has a folksy twang. There are constants, though: Shamir’s instantly identifiable voice — high and sweet with an acidic edge — and his songwriting. Even as his sound becomes more rough-hewed, his songs remain taut and compelling.bkbazaar.com TIBET HOUSE US BENEFIT CONCERT at Carnegie Hall (Feb. 7, 7:30 p.m.). For the 32nd year in a row, Tibet House US, an organization devoted to preserving Tibetan culture and protecting its refugees, will host an all-star musical benefit. This year’s edition, curated by Philip Glass, a longtime participant, includes Laurie Anderson, Jon Batiste, Debbie Harry, Jason Isbell, Angelique Kidjo, Nathaniel Rateliff, New Order’s Bernard Sumner and the Tibetan artist Tenzin Choegyal. Stephen Colbert will be on hand for comic relief. And surprise one-off collaborations are likely; last year, Patti Smith and Angel Olsen covered the Velvet Underground’s “I Found a Reason.” 212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org TRIBALISTAS at the Hammerstein Ballroom (Feb. 5, 8 p.m.). The singers Arnaldo Antunes, Marisa Monte and Carlinhos Brown were already stars in Brazil before joining forces to record their 2002 album, “Tribalistas.” A collection of lilting songs in the tradition of what’s known as “musica popular brasileira” — a post-bossa-nova movement dedicated to integrating international sounds into Brazilian music — the album boosted the supergroup to international success, selling over three million copies globally. It took 15 years for the trio to release a follow-up, also simply called “Tribalistas”; now, they’re performing in New York for the first time as a group.800-745-3000, mc34.com [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] YOLA at Rockwood Music Hall, Stage 2 (Feb. 6, 7 p.m.). Country-soul seems overdue for some mainstream attention, thanks to the parallel success of old-school singers like Leon Bridges and Charles Bradley, and outlaw-era-inspired country stars like Chris Stapleton and Miranda Lambert. Yola, whose Southern soul sound belies her upbringing in southwest England, is as good a candidate as any to spark such a renaissance. Her rich alto fits in seamlessly alongside the slide guitars, jangling piano and lush arrangements on her upcoming debut, “Walk Through Fire,” produced by the Black Keys’ Dan Auerbach.212-477-4155, rockwoodmusichall.comNATALIE WEINER J. D. ALLEN QUARTET at Smoke (Feb. 1-2, 7, 9 and 10:30 p.m.). One of today’s premier tenor saxophonists, Allen spent the last decade working with a steady trio, developing a sturdy but flexible sound based around minor melodies and bristling postbop rhythms. But he recently assembled a new trio featuring a couple of younger musicians, the bassist Ian Kenselaar and the drummer Nic Cacioppo. The early returns are good: An appearance at Winter Jazzfest, where the new trio was joined by the tenor saxophone luminary David Murray, showed how ably the young players have adapted to Allen’s personal style. This weekend the group performs with another of Allen’s frequent collaborators: the crisply expressive guitarist Liberty Ellman.212-864-6662, smokejazz.com JIMMY COBB at Jazz Standard (Jan. 31-Feb. 3, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). Cobb, a drummer and National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master, will probably be remembered as the drummer whose crackling ride cymbal adorned Miles Davis’s 1959 classic, “Kind of Blue.” But his career is much bigger than that one date: He accompanied Sarah Vaughan and John Coltrane and Freddie Hubbard, playing on countless record dates and remaining in the top tier of New York jazz for over 60 years. Cobb turned 90 in January, and he celebrates this weekend in a quartet featuring Peter Bernstein on guitar, Tadataka Unno on piano and John Webber on bass.212-576-2232, jazzstandard.com PEDRO GIRAUDO TANGO QUARTET AND SOFIA TOSELLO at Joe’s Pub (Feb. 1, 9:30 p.m.). Giraudo is an Argentine bassist and composer who reinforces his love for tango with a mastery of Western classical and jazz vocabulary. He sometimes performs with a full orchestra, but he’s just as dazzling with his quartet — the group that appears on his 2018 album, “Vigor Tanguero,” which won a Latin Grammy for best tango album. Also on the bill is Sofia Tosello, a vocalist whose last album, “Lluvia Fue” (“Chamber Tango”), presents its own distinctive take on the tango tradition, mixing old songs and new.212-967-7555, publictheater.org MARÍA GRAND QUARTET AND JOEL ROSS GOOD VIBES at Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola (Feb. 5, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). Grand, a tenor saxophonist, and Ross, a vibraphonist, are two of the most-buzzed-about young players on the New York jazz scene — each with their own sleek, sanguine take on mainstream jazz. They’re also frequent collaborators, and at Dizzy’s on Tuesday they will split the bill, with Grand’s quartet (the vocalist Fay Victor, the bassist Kanoa Mendenhall and the drummer Savannah Harris) starting things off, and Ross’s group (Mendenhall on bass, Immanuel Wilkins on alto saxophone, Jeremy Corren on piano and Jeremy Dutton on drums) playing the second set. Tickets for each performance are sold separately.212-258-9595, jazz.org/dizzys HYPNOTIC BRASS ENSEMBLE at the Blue Note (Jan. 31-Feb. 3, 8 and 10:30 p.m.). The brass-band tradition is naturally associated with New Orleans, but Hypnotic proudly espouses its Chicago roots. With less marching-band thunder and more hip-hop swagger than, say, New Orleans’s Dirty Dozen Brass Band, this eight-piece ensemble mixes the influence of hip-hop, soul and gospel into a coolly grooving sound. And Chicago’s deep legacy as a cradle of experimental, Afrocentric jazz is never far away: All but one of Hypnotic’s members is a son of Kelan Philip Cohran, a patriarch of Chicago’s creative black music scene, who died in 2017.212-475-8592, bluenote.net EIVIND OPSVIK OVERSEAS AND SNARK HORSE at Nublu 151 (Feb. 6, 9 p.m.). A Norwegian-born bassist with a big, dark tone and precision chops, Opsvik writes music with an irreverent intensity, adhering to no single style and showing little interest in the mannered formality of so much progressive jazz. Much of his latest album, the fifth installment of his “Overseas” series, boasts the rugged conviction of rock music and the tangled melodic momentum of a fugue. At Nublu 151, he shares the bill with Snark Horse, an all-star group of improvisers playing short, nervous melodies that they repeat and deconstruct. Snark Horse appears here in quartet form with Matt Mitchell on piano, Ava Mendoza on guitar, Matt Nelson on tenor saxophone and Kate Gentile on drums.nublu.netGIOVANNI RUSSONELLO "
5c4b5a853a125f5075c065de,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/25/arts/music/review-new-york-philharmonic-julia-wolfe.html,"The composer Julia Wolfe’s new multimedia oratorio concerns the 1911 Triangle shirtwaist factory fire. It was a prescient choice of subject. The fire — which took the lives of 146 garment workers, most of them young immigrant women — led to changes in workplace conditions and stirred debate over contentious issues of gender, labor and immigrants’ rights. But how much progress has been made over the past century? That question hovered over the New York Philharmonic’s premiere of Ms. Wolfe’s ambitious, heartfelt, often compelling “Fire in my mouth” on Thursday, a month into a partial government shutdown driven by bitterness over immigration policy. Ms. Wolfe took risks in writing this work, conducted by the Philharmonic’s music director, Jaap van Zweden, and directed by Anne Kauffman. (It anchors “Threads of Our City,” a series in Mr. van Zweden’s first season as music director exploring immigration.) How does a composer depict such a horrific story without melodrama? How to underscore the powerful old film footage and photos that this production projected over the orchestra — women dressed in ruffled shirts walking into factories; workers sitting at tables with sewing machines; the rubble of the decimated factory building — without the music coming across as mere soundtrack? The big things are right in this tautly structured 60-minute piece in four parts: “Immigration,” “Factory,” “Protest” and “Fire.” In an affecting touch, the chorus is made up of 146 women and girls, members of the excellent chamber choir the Crossing (Donald Nally, director) and the impressive Young People’s Chorus of New York City (Francisco J. Núñez, director). Ms. Wolfe’s choice of choral texts, mostly drawn from oral histories and speeches, shows great sensitivity. In “Immigration” she sets the words of a survivor recalling her trip to America: “five of us girls” taking “a big beautiful boat” that “took about 10 days,” everyone looking “to God knows what kind of future.” There is both heady optimism and a sense of dread in Ms. Wolfe’s music here, whole stretches of which render the words in thick, blocky chords, over an orchestra grounded by droning tones yet run through with fidgety inner details. Often a single word is turned into a battering ram: “10, 10, 10,” or “days, days, days.” Longer choral lines unfold in overlapping phrases, which blend words and choral textures into a haunting muddle. “Factory” begins with percussion evoking the clattering sounds of sewing machines. Most of the workers were Eastern European Jews and southern Italians. So Ms. Wolfe inventively juxtaposes a plaintive Yiddish folk song with a lively Italian tarantella-like piece. The way these songs are embedded in Ms. Wolfe’s agitated, heaving orchestra, they seem like alternative coping mechanisms for the oppressed. There are stretches in which the music of “Fire in my mouth” assumes its place in the multimedia whole a little too well. I liked it most when Ms. Wolfe went for something musically visceral or extreme, as in the climactic episode of “Protest.” The women’s choir sings relentless phrases espousing the determination of these immigrants to “talk like,” “look like” and “sing like” Americans. Then the girls’ choir, entering the hall from the aisles, sang a stark passage from a speech by Clara Lemlich, an activist leading a strike. Here, the choral refrains and orchestra layers built into piercing harmonies, like clusters out of Ives or Varèse, yet driven by Ms. Wolfe’s Minimalism-influenced rhythms. In one of the most gripping moments, the choristers raised actual scissors (specially chosen by Ms. Wolfe) above their heads in an eerie gesture that also added metallic slicing sounds to the musical textures. During the harrowing climax of “Fire” the music turned raw, brassy and blazing, with fractured rhythms, choral plaints that border on screeching, and chanted repetitions: “Burn like, burn like, burn.” Mr. van Zweden led a commanding account of a score that requires close coordination between disparate forces, and which ends with an elegiac final chorus in which the names of all 146 victims are tenderly sung to create a fabric of music and memory. Another elegy, an instrumental movement from Steven Stucky’s oratorio “August 4, 1964,” about Lyndon B. Johnson, opened the program. Then the Philharmonic’s principal clarinetist, Anthony McGill, was a superb soloist in Copland’s Clarinet Concerto, a piece that begins with a winding, wistful melody that segues into a feisty second movement: in this context, another, brighter side of urban life.

5c6e91bb3a125f5075c0ac68,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/arts/music/webster-hall-reopening.html,"When the doors open in April at the renovated Webster Hall — the East Village club, once known as the Ritz, that was renowned for its mix of rock shows and raucous dance parties — music fans will find a revamped entryway and lounge, new bathrooms and upgraded acoustics. But the most important change may simply be the arrival of an elevator. Webster Hall, housed in an 1886 building, part of which has been declared a landmark, is a rabbit warren of staircases and anterooms that surround a grand ballroom. But without an elevator, handicapped patrons had to be carried inside and loading equipment was a daily ordeal. “On a regular tour, whatever city they were in, they’d have two or four loaders,” said Jim Glancy of the concert promotion company the Bowery Presents, which is one of the new owners. “At Webster Hall, the minimum would be 12 people.” The new elevator is one of a number of subtle changes meant to bring the club, just off Union Square, up to contemporary standards, reintroducing it to fans and to an industry that has been hungry for a room of its size — the ballroom holds 1,400 people — in a central part of Manhattan. “This room has been needed — we felt its absence,” said Marty Diamond of Paradigm Talent Agency, who booked the club in its 1980s iteration as the Ritz. After an opening night in late April, to be announced, the initial lineup will include Patti Smith on May 1; the D.J. TroyBoi on May 3; Sharon Van Etten on May 4; Broken Social Scene on May 16 and 17; and MGMT from May 22 to 24. Webster Hall, long an independently owned space, was bought two years ago by BSE Global, the parent company of Barclays Center, and the Bowery Presents, which is partly owned by the concert giant AEG, for a price estimated at about $35 million. When the club shut down in August 2017 for renovations, there was an outcry from fans who worried that Webster Hall’s history as a dance mecca and a center of gay night life in New York would be lost. The new owners say they are committed to preserving that tradition, but are still deciding how. “It was a very democratic club that was all about variety, and we intend to bring that variety back when we reopen,” said Keith Sheldon, BSE Global’s executive vice president of programming. On a recent tour of the space, construction was still in full swing, with saws buzzing and workmen lugging armloads of wood. But the changes to the club’s design were clear. Three doors were added to its entrance on East 11th Street — a concession by the Landmarks Preservation Commission — to get people in and out more quickly. On the first floor, the Marlin Room, a former venue-within-a-venue, has been turned into a sleek lounge. Upstairs in the ballroom, acoustic treatments have been added to the walls and ceiling, and some remnants of the dance-party past have been removed, like a monstrous lighting rig that John Moore, one of the Bowery Presents principals, likened to Battlestar Galactica. “It would come down, it would move around; it was very ’80s,” Mr. Moore said, adding that it would be replaced with a more conventional mirror ball. But much of the idiosyncratic grandeur of the room was untouched, like its scalloped balconies, Art Deco wall designs and, above the stage, an old canvas painting of falling balloons. “The vision has always been to maintain the soul, the grit, the history of the venue,” said Brett Yormark, the chief executive of BSE Global. “For fans, they are going to feel like they’re coming home again.” The preserved details are reminders of the remarkable history of Webster Hall, which started as a community social club but, by Prohibition, became known for wild parties. In 1953, it was bought by RCA, which used it as a recording studio for Harry Belafonte, Perry Como and classical giants like Sviatoslav Richter. When the Ritz opened in 1980, it became a center for new wave music, hosting the American debuts of bands like U2 and Depeche Mode. In 1989, the Ritz moved to the former Studio 54 space on West 54th Street, and in 1992, under the new ownership of the Ballinger family, Webster Hall reopened as a club under its own name. When the new partners bought the club, Jay Marciano, the chairman of AEG Presents, the company’s music division, said he expected renovations to cost $10 million. In an interview this week, he laughed at that estimate. “I won’t give a specific number, but it was a multiple of that,” Mr. Marciano said. “Nothing gets done cheaply in New York City.” "
5c54f7403a125f5075c07a93,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/01/arts/television/russian-doll-netflix-harry-nilsson-gotta-get-up.html,"Spoilers ahead for the first season of “Russian Doll.”  In the new Netflix series “Russian Doll,” Nadia (Natasha Lyonne), a cynical video game programmer with commitment issues, finds herself caught in a never-ending cycle of death and resurrection on the night of her 36th birthday party. No matter what Nadia does, she eventually dies and awakens in the same bathroom on that same night at that same party. And with almost every reset, the staccato piano chords of a nearly 50-year-old pop tune kick in. [Read our critic’s review of “Russian Doll.”] That song is “Gotta Get Up,” the opening track from the late singer-songwriter Harry Nilsson’s 1971 album “Nilsson Schmilsson,” and its bright, infectious instrumentation belies melancholy, wistful lyrics about growing older. “We used to carry on and drink and do the rock ’n’ roll,” he sings. “We never thought we’d get older/We never thought it’d grow cold.” Lyonne, who created “Russian Doll” with Amy Poehler and Leslye Headland, was struck by the “buoyant doomsday quality” of Nilsson’s famously troubled life, as chronicled in the 2010 documentary “Who Is Harry Nilsson (And Why Is Everybody Talkin’ About Him)?” (An alcoholic, Nilsson filed for bankruptcy toward the end of his life and died at 52, of heart failure, in 1994.) “There was always a kind of ending that was unpleasant,” Lyonne said this week, “that was percolating under the surface of his songs, even at their most upbeat and certainly at their darkest.” Lyonne also wanted to “touch something that was out of time, and a New York and East Village that was out of time” while simultaneously evoking the present; at one point they questioned whether the characters should even have cellphones, she said. The Brooklyn-born Nilsson — whose legacy didn’t endure to the extent one might have expected in his ’70s heyday, which was distinguished by songs like “Everybody’s Talkin’” and the respect of celebrated peers like John Lennon — was the “perfect marriage of all those ideas.” Early on, there were other contenders for Nadia’s reset song, including Lou Reed’s “Crazy Feeling,” the Stooges’s “No Fun” and Lil’ Kim’s “Not Tonight.” But though they may have fit the tone, the creative team kept coming back to “Gotta Get Up” — as Lyonne put it, the other artists “didn’t pack the guttural punch” of Nilsson. Obtaining the rights to the song was another matter. The plan to reuse it many times, à la “I Got You Babe” in “Groundhog Day,” the show’s most obvious antecedent, ate into most of the music budget. Nilsson’s estate also limited the production to a certain amount of uses. As editing progressed, uncertainty about the song’s availability hung over the show like a “daily albatross,” Lyonne said, and the creators pondered which songs they might be willing to give up in order to afford “Gotta Get Up.” Because “Gotta Get Up” had become the song — if there was a Plan B, neither Lyonne or Headland, who discussed the topic in a separate interview, recall what it was. Fortunately, approval finally arrived late in the editing process. In an email, Brienne Rose, the show’s music supervisor, did not specify the terms of the licensing deal, citing confidentiality. But she did note that the team was able “to find a balance between the maximum number of uses, and what the budget would allow.” The constraints contributed to the varying ways in which “Gotta Get Up” is employed for Nadia’s resets — in the second episode, she dies several times within a four-minute montage, while the song continues to loop underneath, uninterrupted. In the pivotal fifth episode, in which Nadia begins to question her own goodness and morality, the song doesn’t appear at all. “We were able to kind of straddle that line and put you in a particular head space as you were watching the rest of the loop,” Headland said. “It’s the kind of thing you probably don’t notice, but your brain did.” (For the record, the theme song for Alan, the show’s other oft reanimated character, played by Charlie Barnett, was Beethoven’s “Piano Concerto No. 4 In G Major.” For both Headland and Lyonne, the composer is inextricably linked with Stanley Kubrick’s “A Clockwork Orange” — Headland views Beethoven primarily through the lenses of “pent-up energy” and “violence,” she said, themes that are found throughout “Russian Doll.”) The reset song technique does “more heavy lifting than just marking where you are in time,” Headland said, noting a scene from Episode 4 where, in a departure from the other sequences, “Gotta Get Up” intrudes on Alan’s reset. “Russian Doll” is about being haunted, she added. “So that music — what happened with Nilsson in his own personal life, and all those things — it’s just so obvious to me that he’s one of the many ghosts that are in that story.” "
5c3f770b3a125f5075c04c03,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/16/arts/music/james-blake-assume-form-review.html,"Love is a murky, uncertain, only sporadically blissful thing on James Blake’s fourth album, “Assume Form.” But sometimes it manages to break through his chronic melancholy. He needs the changeup, because echoes of his own past are his toughest competition. Since the release of his self-titled debut album in 2011, Blake’s style has made a thoroughly improbable conquest of pop’s commercial mainstream, seeping into hip-hop, R&B and rock. Beyoncé, Frank Ocean, Kanye West, Kendrick Lamar and Anderson .Paak chose him as a collaborator, and streaming blockbusters like Post Malone, Future and Juice WRLD have clearly learned from his vocabulary of oozy, slow-motion chords, electronically wobbled vocals and transitions that crumble and lurch into new configurations. Before his debut album, Blake had made a reputation as a club D.J. playing and producing fractured, aggressively disorienting British dubstep tracks. But “James Blake” turned his music radically inward. He constructed ballads around sparse keyboard chords and his sustained, doleful, androgynous voice, hovering in imaginary space and punctuated by tense silences. He was, he told The Guardian in 2016, “copying dubstep rhythms but using gospel-tinged, classically tinged keyboard playing.” But he was doing more than that. For all his debts to British dubstep and to the moody desolation of hip-hop auteurs like RZA (who was a guest on Blake’s 2013 album, “Overgrown”), Blake had found a way to create a charged stillness, a forsaken fortress of solitude. His music suited an era of disembodied digital interactions, at once instantaneous and physically distant. With “Assume Form,” Blake wants to get closer. His previous albums were suffused with loneliness; this one, tentatively and almost incredulously, ponders intimacy. In the album’s title song, Blake sings about choosing to become embodied: “I’ll leave the ether/I will assume form,” he croons. “I will be touchable by her/I will be reachable.” The track fluctuates gorgeously, juxtaposing loops of piano that are soothing and vaguely ominous, and only settling into a beat about halfway through, like a ghost gradually solidifying. [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] The album is full of gratitude and affectionate apologies. “Into the Red” marvels at a woman’s financial generosity, over a track that dwindles from a string-ensemble arrangement to tiny, plinking tones. “Can’t Believe the Way We Flow,” built on a rapturous sample from the R&B vocal group the Manhattans and produced with Oneohtrix Point Never, revels in sensuality that makes the singer “waive my fear of self.” In “Power On,” he lists his delusions of separateness and self-sufficiency — “I thought you were second place to every song” — only to return to a refrain: “I was wrong.” Blake rarely lets his music feel too secure. He still makes pitches waver and rhythms dissolve; he switches texture with sudden, surreal edits. In two songs, he collaborates with the producer Metro Boomin and guest vocalists: Travis Scott in “Mile High” and Moses Sumney in “Tell Them.” But he calmly destabilizes Metro Boomin’s trap rhythms, entangling them with flute sounds in “Mile High” and fitfully swapping them for flamenco handclaps in “Tell Them.” Well aware of how widely imitated he is, Blake offers some other surprises; if it were in a different musical guise, the borderline stalker-ish “I’ll Come Too” could almost be a Tin Pan Alley ballad. Like the rest of Blake’s albums, “Assume Form” opens into haunted, rewarding depths. All that’s missing is one luminous, fully focused pop chorus, like “Retrograde” on Blake’s 2013 “Overgrown” or “My Willing Heart” on his 2016 “The Colour in Anything.” This album comes closest in “Barefoot in the Park,” a duet with the Spanish singer Rosalía that, despite its minor key and somber descending chords, celebrates togetherness and how “You start rubbing off on me.” Perhaps Blake couldn’t bring himself to write something as clichéd as a hit-seeking pop love song.

5c6d176f3a125f5075c0a8b6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/20/arts/music/chaka-khan-hello-happiness.html,"It’s been 12 years since Chaka Khan released a studio album, but “I wasn’t sitting, twiddling my thumbs,” the singer known as the Queen of Funk said recently. She was touring and stealthily recording two albums. The first, “Hello Happiness,” out this month, is full of upbeat, powerful tracks that wouldn’t be out of place on a “Soul Train” line. For this record, Khan teamed with the singer-songwriter Sarah Ruba Taylor and the producer Switch (M.I.A., Santigold), and served as a co-producer, co-writer and percussionist (she played timbales on the single “Like Sugar”). Khan writes quickly, in the studio, sometimes from poems she jots down on whatever is handy. “I think with every track, what the song is about is already there before you put the words down,” she said. For this album, “no deep thoughts were necessary. It was a lot of fun.” In a phone interview from Chicago, her hometown, where she was shooting a TV show and visiting with family, the enduring voice behind hits like “I’m Every Woman” explained why she wanted to make a danceable record now. “I’m a happier person these days,” she said. “My entire life has been challenging and troublesome — and great, you dig? I may go in and out, like everybody else. I’m going through a nice slot right here. I’m achieving some things that I wanted to for a long time.” At 65, Khan — who used to play basketball with her longtime friend Prince (“I’m not trying to run around the court,” she said, but “I can shoot”) — talked about her recent rehab stint, taking ownership over her career and why she has no plans to retire. “I can still play basketball right now,” she said, “and I can still drop it like it’s hot onstage.” These are edited excerpts from the conversation. Why did you wait so long to release these songs? I wanted to release them in a good way, and remain a free artist, not tied down to some large label for 100 years. [Khan said she hasn’t had a label deal for at least a decade.] It was like working for somebody, having a job — no artistic freedom and no say-so with anything. Whereas what I’m doing is very different. I don’t see it as a job. It’s a calling. Did you have an awakening when you realized, this is not fair, I should get more of a stake in this? Prince and I sort of came to that conclusion at the same time. We did a CD together, called “Come 2 My House.” We were both with the same label, I just didn’t put “slave” on my face. You’re known as one of the premier vocal arrangers. Are there artists continuing in your footsteps, or is it a skill that’s dying out? I don’t know what other people are really doing, as far as that’s concerned. I think there’s a lot of shenanigans going on with vocals these days, actually, but the gift that I got, it’s just natural. I don’t really look the gift horse in the mouth — I just go and do what has to be done, you dig? I give it as little thought as possible. I don’t even really listen to music. Really? Not even jazz or classical at home? No. If I have friends over for dinner or drinks, whatever, then I’ll play some music. If I’m being driven in my assistant’s car, she’s got a great catalog we listen to in the car, and that’s it. Or if I find a club where a good jazz band is playing, I may go. That’s very rare. This is what I do for a living. When I want to relax, I prefer passive entertainment, like looking at the telly. I like “Forensic Files,” and some horror. Animal channel. In 2016, you announced that you were entering rehab, prompted by Prince’s death. Was your issue with pain pills longstanding? On and off. I had a knee replacement thing going on, aggravated by flying and walking a lot, and working. I went to a pain management clinic and I was seeing a professional. I stopped self-medicating. I’m good. Your career has spanned so many eras, do you miss things from any period in particular? Working in the ’80s with [the producer] Arif Mardin, in New York, really made my life happen. I really miss him. And he challenged me vocally and musically, and I miss that kind of interaction. The music I did in the ’80s I think was my best music. Working with Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie, Chick Corea — all the greats that I grew up listening to. Was Davis abrasive or charming when you worked with him? Very charming. I don’t know how he was with other people, but he was sweet to me. [We’d] go out to dinner, go see a lot of jazz, go to his house, listen to music, with he and Cicely [Tyson, his wife at the time]. Do you still get the same electric charge out of performing that you did early on? No, the charge is different, it’s changed throughout the years. But I still am nervous before I go onstage — that’s something that has not changed. You could call it lightweight stage fright. I’m anxious, any day I have to work, and I can’t eat. I don’t really feel comfortable onstage until at least the third song. And how do you feel when you get offstage? If it’s a really good show, I don’t remember what I did. I have to ask my colleagues. Anytime I do a particularly good show, I get lost, I go somewhere else. You grew up in a musical household; was being a performer something that you considered from a young age? I didn’t realize it at a young age, but it was my calling even at that time. We all sang around the house, when we cleaned up on Saturdays, listening to Frank Sinatra, Sarah Vaughan. And I thought everybody’s family did that; I thought everybody could sing. I only realized that I had something that people really liked during a talent show, when people threw money on the stage after I sang. I thought, “Oh, O.K., remember that.” I was maybe 14. Your contemporaries, like Anita Baker, are staging farewell tours. Do you see your career arcing that way? I couldn’t even begin to think that. This is my life, this is why I’m here on this planet. How could I retire? This is who I am. What is the next album you have coming? I’m working on a Joni Mitchell project right now, who’s a great friend. I have her blessing. I’m doing my favorite songs of Joni’s. Not her hits — the songs that have kept me alive on tour. When I’m on the bus, I always put on Joni Mitchell. She would revive me, in a big way — the music, the things she said, the philosopher in her. She’s my favorite writer, singer-songwriter. I don’t even remember when I first met her; it’s been a while. What shape does your friendship take now? We mostly visit each other. We’ve been going out a lot lately, since she’s been better [Mitchell had serious health issues for years; in 2015, she suffered a brain aneurysm]. She’s making great strides. I’ve been going to her house a lot lately. We live like five minutes from each other. She comes to my house, I go to her house, we play music, we drink wine, we talk, we have a good time. We go out sometimes, to see a band, to dinner — lots of dinners. What was the last band you saw? I don’t remember. Some guys that were playing in an Italian restaurant. When you’re in that setting, do they call you up onstage? Do you go? Most of the time, I do, if I like the band. But they always call me up — that’s another reason I don’t go out much. [Laughs] I noticed in a lot of your recent appearances, including Aretha Franklin’s funeral, and on your album cover, you’re holding a giant fan. Explain, please. I sell fans. I’m opening my store soon online, I’ll be selling them, as well as some bags, and a hair-care line, some makeup stuff. At my age, I’m into creating passive income. When I don’t want to go on a tour, I don’t have to go on a tour, so I can make money while I sleep, or while I watch TV. But I always loved fans. I’ve been using them forever, since I started going to Japan in the early ’70s. A lot of people imagine that an artist like you would basically be rolling in it. And what I’m hearing is that you feel like were subjected to deals that cheated you out of royalties. And now you have to restructure. Absolutely, the story of my life, yes. This is my work, it’s all I have, and I should own it. I now know my worth, O.K. — I really do. And that’s how I’m going to live out the rest of my life, period. I’m not going to sell myself cheap or short. I’m not good old Chaka Khan anymore, you can’t call on me when somebody else said they can’t do the gig — “Ask Chaka, she’ll do it.” I used to be like that, but I’m not doing that anymore. And when you want to hire me, you better have some money. That’s it. "
5c54e28e3a125f5075c07a78,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/01/obituaries/sanford-sylvan-dead.html,"Sanford Sylvan, the American baritone whose introspective eloquence and serene yet commanding presence put him at the center of some of the most important operatic events of recent times, died on Tuesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 65. The cause was not immediately known, his family said. Mr. Sylvan’s voice — solid, but silken and plangent — and his combination of emotional openness and understated dignity brought to operatic life two crucial characters in landmark works by John Adams. He was the first Chou En-lai in “Nixon in China” (1987) and Leon Klinghoffer in “The Death of Klinghoffer” (1991). He was also the soloist at the premiere of “The Wound-Dresser” (1989), Mr. Adams’s reflective orchestral setting of Whitman’s poem. “He was my muse,” Mr. Adams said in a phone interview on Thursday. “Certainly for the male voice during that period.” Mr. Sylvan was proposed for the “Nixon” role by its director, Peter Sellars, for whom he also starred in a pair of modern-dress stagings in the 1980s: “Così Fan Tutte,” which took place at a roadside diner, and “Le Nozze di Figaro,” set in Trump Tower in Manhattan. The productions were a radically unconventional approach to Mozart, and Mr. Sylvan’s energetic and sensitively shadowed portrayals — in “Così,” his Don Alfonso was a Vietnam veteran embittered by grief — were central to their success. “Sandy could sing that music with purity and a danger zone,” Mr. Sellars said in an interview on Thursday. “And Mozart at that time was not thought to be dangerous.” Sanford Mead Sylvan was born on Dec. 19, 1953, in New York City, and grew up in Syosset, on Long Island. His mother, Lenore (Cohen) Sylvan, was a teacher, and his father, Elliott Sylvan, was a trucking company executive. Inspired by a recording of Leontyne Price in “Aida,” Sanford fell in love with opera at an early age, and music teachers quickly discovered he had a voice. Not yet in high school, he was admitted to the Juilliard School’s pre-college program, and he spent several summers at the Tanglewood Music Center, where he studied with the great soprano Phyllis Curtin, a passionate advocate of new music. He went on to the Manhattan School of Music, working on the side as an usher at the Metropolitan Opera. But after graduation, Mr. Sylvan did something unusual. “In those days it was heresy to leave New York City if you wanted a career,” he said an interview with The New York Observer in 2011. “But I went to Boston in 1977 and it was the best thing I ever did. It’s hard to describe what Boston was like in the ’70s, ’80s and ’90s. There was a real relationship with the audience.” In Boston, where he already had contacts through his time at Tanglewood, Mr. Sylvan met the pianist David Breitman, with whom he began a long recital partnership. He also became a part of the prestigious and close-knit ensemble Emmanuel Music, which the conductor Craig Smith had founded there in 1970 at Emmanuel Church, with performances of Bach’s cantatas at the group’s core. Mr. Smith, who was working on Mr. Sellars’s 1981 production of Handel’s “Orlando” at the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Mass., brought Mr. Sylvan in to audition for the title role. Orlando goes mad in an extended, intense, vocally dazzling scene in the second act. “Sandy’s madness had absolute clarity,” Mr. Sellars said. “No operatic MSG. He put all the big gestures we’re used to from opera into this deeply personal space.” “Orlando” led to Mr. Sellars’s Mozart cycle and the Adams operas, which became famous for mining recent history for its mythical import. “John found Sandy’s temperature,” Mr. Sellars said, “and Sandy’s temperature deeply inspired John.” That temperature could seem deceptively mild. Chou En-lai, in “Nixon in China,” is the voice of reason in a tensely charged cast of characters, and Mr. Sylvan projected calm and equanimity. But he also captured undercurrents of fragility and anxiety. His Chou ended the opera in a tone of visionary resignation, summing up the frustration of the Nixon-Mao summit with a single, unanswerable question: “How much of what we did was good?” While “Nixon” summoned Mr. Sylvan’s gravity and “The Wound-Dresser” his melancholy, “The Death of Klinghoffer” — a reflection on the 1985 hijacking of the cruise ship Achille Lauro by Palestine Liberation Front militants, who killed Leon Klinghoffer, a disabled Jewish American passenger — demanded of Mr. Sylvan an overt outrage not usually associated with him. But he made Klinghoffer’s indignation musical, and the aria sung by the character’s dead body, falling from the ship after being thrown overboard, was a controlled outpouring, rage focused into tenderness. His recordings, many with Mr. Breitman, include programs of Schubert, Fauré, Jorge Martin and Virgil Thomson, as well as a luminous, delicate 1991 release, “Beloved That Pilgrimage,” which includes Theodore Chanler’s “Eight Epitaphs,” Barber’s “Hermit Songs” and Copland’s “Twelve Poems of Emily Dickinson.” Mr. Sylvan took part in the New York premiere of Mr. Adams’s opera “A Flowering Tree” in 2009, and also performed contemporary works by composers like Peter Maxwell Davies, Philip Glass, John Harbison and Charles Fussell. Mr. Sylvan took regular sabbaticals, spending time in a small farming community in Scotland and exploring Buddhism and Judaism. But he remained grounded for decades in the Boston music scene. He became so closely associated with that city that when he moved to Montreal in 2007 to take a teaching position at McGill University, The Boston Globe ran an article about on his departure with the headline “Sanford Sylvan Uproots Himself.” He began teaching at Juilliard in 2012, and became chairman of the school’s voice faculty last year. He is survived by his mother; his brother, Seth; and his sister, Gwen Sylvan. The broad success and reach of Mr. Sylvan’s performances — Mr. Sellars’s Mozart stagings toured widely and were broadcast internationally, and the Adams operas, which Mr. Sylvan performed in multiple cities, were made into acclaimed recordings — did not change his modest, focused approach to his career. He chose his projects and collaborators carefully, and his work always felt meticulously, but never aridly, tailored. His tone was both airy and substantial; his diction crystalline; his manner direct and unaffected. “I just did what I wanted,” he said in the 2011 interview. “I didn’t live like a prince. To sing the ‘St. Matthew Passion’ with a great conductor, that’s the bottom line for me. You don’t get rich singing the ‘St. Matthew Passion,’ you just get happy.” "
5c5b048c3a125f5075c08503,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/06/arts/music/lincoln-center-92nd-street-y.html,"Lincoln Center, which has been buffeted by leadership churn in recent years, has looked to Broadway and academia for its last two presidents. They didn’t take. Now it is looking to the East Side of Manhattan, and to someone with a background running a large nonprofit cultural and community center. Lincoln Center announced Wednesday that its next president and chief executive would be Henry Timms, who leads the 92nd Street Y. The difficulties Mr. Timms, 42, will face at the center, the nation’s largest performing arts complex, are substantial. He must help get the long-delayed renovation of the New York Philharmonic’s home, David Geffen Hall, back on track after a series of false starts. He will need to keep the complex’s finances stable at a tough time for arts organizations. And he will have to work to improve Lincoln Center’s sometimes fraught relationships with the powerful independent organizations that make it their home, but do not answer to it — including the Metropolitan Opera, the Philharmonic and New York City Ballet. “I don’t think you should ever pretend that there aren’t some real, and interesting, management challenges here,” Mr. Timms said in an interview. “But I think it’s the case that every constituent’s best interest is served in a collaborative culture.” The 92nd Street Y has a $69 million annual budget, just over half of Lincoln Center’s; a powerful and wealthy board; and a wide variety of offerings that include a distinguished concert program and lecture series. While leading it, Mr. Timms helped create #GivingTuesday, which urges people to donate to charities on the Tuesday after Thanksgiving and has grown into a national movement. He raised $160 million toward a $180 million capital campaign for the Y, and used virtual reality to help people think about how to remake its buildings. And he helped the Y recover from one of its most difficult periods. His predecessor there, Sol Adler, was fired amid accusations that he had an affair with an employee, and there was an investigation into whether another manager there had been demanding kickback payments from vendors. Mr. Adler committed suicide in 2014, and his widow sued the Y. Mr. Timms’s ability to steer the Y through that trying time was one of the things that impressed Katherine Farley, the chairwoman of Lincoln Center’s board. “He inherited a very tough, tragic, complicated situation, any way you look at it,” Ms. Farley said in an interview. “His temperament is one of collaboration; he seems to have a low ego need.” That collaborative approach could help ease tensions at the complex. Although Lincoln Center was founded to serve essentially as the landlord to constituent organizations, over time it began offering its own performances and series, including Mostly Mozart and Great Performers — leading to competition for resources, ticket sales and contributions. Running the center has never been easy. Reynold Levy, who led it for a dozen years and left in 2014, called his memoir “They Told Me Not to Take That Job.” Things have been rocky since. Mr. Levy’s successor, Jed Bernstein, a producer who had led the Broadway League, was removed after only 27 months. An interim team took over until the center found its next president: Debora L. Spar, who had been the president of Barnard College. She was pushed out after a year, after clashing with the center’s senior staff, who were backed by the board. Then Lincoln Center named Russell Granet, who had run its education division, acting president — spurring speculation that he was next in line. Some of the leaders of the complex’s resident arts organizations expressed concerns that Mr. Granet did not have enough prior experience for a job of the scale and stature of running Lincoln Center, according to an arts executive who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive conversations. The leaders wrote Ms. Farley, asking for a meeting. When they met, they discussed the kind of leader they believed the center should seek. “They mentioned some qualities that really describe Henry to a T,” Ms. Farley said, adding that several constituents, including Deborah Borda, the president and chief executive of the Philharmonic, had mentioned Mr. Timms as someone to consider. “They said things like: someone who had an entrepreneurial instinct; someone who had a strong connection to the arts and who had real appreciation for excellence, and what was finest about Lincoln Center; someone who could create synergies across the campus to take all of what we do at Lincoln Center to a new level.” Ms. Borda said that she was pleased with the selection, and believed they would be ready to proceed with the next steps of the Geffen Hall project soon. “I think it is an exceptional appointment, and I really felt an immediate click of a true partnership with him,” she said in an interview. And Peter Gelb, the general manager of the Met, said that Mr. Timms’s experience made him a “great choice.” Mr. Gelb added that he was heartened that Lincoln Center had paid serious attention to its constituents during the search process. Asked if the Met had a wish list from the incoming administration, he said, “The Met’s wish list is the same as the other constituents: that Lincoln Center regard them with the importance they deserve, since they are the fundamental elements of what makes Lincoln Center Lincoln Center.” Mr. Timms — who grew up in Exeter, England, and is the author, with Jeremy Heimans, of “New Power,” a book about leadership in an increasingly interconnected world — will need to hit the ground running. The center’s leadership struggles have slowed big projects, including the renovation of Geffen Hall, which has been on and off for 20 years. Ms. Farley landed a $100 million gift from the entertainment mogul David Geffen in 2015, and renamed the building for him. But there were concerns that the early plans for a revamp would cost considerably more than the initial $500 million price tag people spoke of. And the proposal threatened to keep the Philharmonic out of the hall for several seasons of construction. In 2017, Ms. Spar and Ms. Borda, who was just starting at the Philharmonic, scrapped the plans and went back to the drawing board. Mr. Timms said it was too soon to say what his vision for Geffen Hall was. Ms. Farley promised that more plans for the hall would be shared in the near future, and said that they would still be transformative. “It’s going to be really exciting,” she said. "
5c6d3a283a125f5075c0a924,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/20/world/asia/k-pop-identical-korea.html,"HONG KONG — Doe-eyed with delicate features. A sharp jawline and willowy figure. Fair skin so clear it almost glows. With many South Korean pop idols fitting that description in their sleekly produced music videos, their mass appeal has many of the country’s young people wanting to look just like them. But in an effort to tone down their influence in a beauty-obsessed country where plastic surgery is rampant, South Korea’s government is trying to limit the stars’ presence on television, saying they look too much alike. “Are all the singers on television music programs twins?” the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family wrote about the stars of K-pop, as their music is known, in broadcast guidelines released this month, according to The Korea Times. “They seriously look identical,” it said, adding that many pop idol groups’ musical styles were “just as limited as their appearances.” The guidelines drew such criticism from fans that on Tuesday the ministry apologized for “causing unnecessary confusion,” and said that some of the recommendations would be removed or reviewed, the news agency Agence France-Presse reported. Some compared the guidelines to the censorship imposed during the country’s military dictatorship during the latter half of the 20th century. An online petition, calling for the ministry to be dissolved, read, “The ministry has dared to point out female idols for being too pretty, wearing the same clothes and being skinny,” according to the newspaper Korea Joongang Daily. Ha Tae-kyung, a politician from an opposition party, compared the guidelines — which the gender ministry said applied to both female and male performers — to restrictions on hair and skirt lengths during the dictatorship. “There are no objective standards to people’s looks,” he wrote in a Facebook post on Saturday. It wasn’t the first time Mr. Ha had defended influential K-pop band members. Last year, he called for them to be exempt from the county’s military draft, since top classical musicians are given exemptions. The guidelines were intended to make television a more benevolent experience. Ministry officials said on Monday that viewers worried that television shows “exacerbate inequalities and gender stereotypes, rather than fixing it,” the Korea Joongang Daily reported. In the guidelines, officials suggested that shows avoid featuring performers “whose appearances are exceedingly similar” in the same program. One in three South Korean women have undergone cosmetic surgery between the ages of 19 and 29, a  Gallup Korea poll has found — a trend that mirrors the narrow beauty standards epitomized by K-pop stars. Some South Koreans have openly celebrated having cosmetic surgery, documenting their physical transformations as a rite of passage. In a pair of videos called “Getting Pretty Before” and “Getting Pretty After,” members of the K-pop group SixBomb giddily went for manicures between appointments at a plastic surgeon, where their faces were prodded and poked. “Getting Pretty After” showed them wearing pink bodysuits in an operating room, prancing out afterward with altered faces. "
5c3667e23a125f5075c039ad,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/09/obituaries/dennis-johnson-dead.html,"Dennis Johnson, a composer who in 1959 wrote a trailblazing Minimalist work, a six-hour piano meditation of repeated notes and long pauses that went unheard for 50 years before being rediscovered, died on Dec. 20 in Morgan Hill, Calif. He was 80. His half brother, Don Wilson, said the cause was complications of dementia. Until 10 years ago, long after Mr. Johnson had dropped composing for a career as a mathematician, his music was known only by reputation. References to it were found in the writings of the composer La Monte Young, who described Mr. Johnson as one of his closest musical allies when they were students at the University of California, Los Angeles. Mr. Young is a founder of Minimalism, a genre of composition marked by repetition, gradual development and sometimes spare harmonies. Some of the most important contemporary composers, including John Adams, Steve Reich and Philip Glass, are at times associated with the movement or at least have incorporated such elements in their work. Mr. Young is credited with composing the first Minimalist work, his String Trio of 1958, which unfolded so slowly that listeners focused less on its sequence of notes than on its long, sustained tones and glacial pace. A year later, Mr. Johnson produced “November,” his piano work, which also moves glacially, starting with just two notes — a rising minor third — repeated several times before new material is added, in a process that yielded a flow of individual tones, sustained chords and silences. Mr. Johnson described his compositional method in a 2013 interview with the music magazine The Wire: “I would just sit down at the piano and diddle, and listen, and it would slowly grow, like out of a seed,” he said. “Even now, when I do mathematics, it seems to be that way.” Mr. Johnson’s innovations were repetition and generally consonant harmonies. Mr. Young has said that “November” influenced his own six-hour magnum opus, “The Well-Tuned Piano” (1964), considered an early landmark of the genre. But for the next 50 years “November” was virtually unknown. The path to its revival began in 1992, when Mr. Young gave the critic and composer Kyle Gann a cassette tape with a partial performance, by Mr. Johnson, running 112 minutes. Mr. Gann decided to reconstruct the score, using the tape and a handful of pages that Mr. Johnson had sent him detailing many of the work’s motifs as well as performance instructions. Mr. Gann performed a tag-team version of the piece with the pianist Sarah Cahill at the Second International Conference on Minimalist Music, at the University of Missouri, Kansas City, in 2009. That performance led to a 2013 recording by R. Andrew Lee for Irritable Hedgehog, a new-music label. Mr. Gann’s reconstruction has also been recorded by the Dutch pianist Jeroen van Veen. Though the score was unknown to most musicians until the release of Mr. Lee’s recording, its Minimalist qualities — and its influence on Mr. Young — have led to a reconsideration of Minimalism’s early history. Dennis Lee Johnson was born in Los Angeles on Nov. 19, 1938, to Leroy Johnson, a building contractor, and Eloise (Jeffcoat) Johnson, a seamstress. His parents divorced before he was 8, and when his mother remarried, the family moved to Canoga Park, Calif. In addition to Mr. Wilson, his half brother, Mr. Johnson is survived by a half sister, Judy Wilson Plouff. Mr. Johnson’s early talent for mathematics earned him a full scholarship to Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire, where he completed high school. He enrolled as a math student at the California Institute of Technology in 1956. But after a year he became disillusioned, and although he had studied the piano only casually as a child, he decided to transfer to U.C.L.A. to study music. As part of Mr. Young’s iconoclastic circle, Mr. Johnson produced works that were often whimsical, like “Din,” in which 40 musicians screamed, clapped their hands and shuffled their feet in a darkened hall. They could also be conceptual, like a piece that consisted of a card containing only the word “Listen.” He continued performing for several years, both on the piano and on the hichiriki, a Japanese double reed instrument. When Mr. Young moved to New York, in 1960, Mr. Johnson remained at U.C.L.A., shifting his focus to ethnomusicology and, by 1962, to mathematical study. But he visited New York several times from 1960 to 1965, and played the hichiriki in early versions of Mr. Young’s performance group, Theater of Eternal Music. In 1966, Mr. Johnson gave up performing music publicly and began work on his doctorate in math, which he completed two years later. In 1969, he took a two-year position at the Institute of Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J. Beginning in the mid-1970s, he worked for a decade at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, near Pasadena, first as a staff researcher and software developer and then as a consultant. Among his projects at the lab was the radio mapping of Venus — a mathematical reconstruction of the planet’s surface using radar data. He also taught mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley, and continued his own research in advanced algebra and geometry. His 1983 theorem, the Johnson homomorphism, is still studied in the field of geometric topology. After 1995, Mr. Johnson began working with Roger C. Alperin, a professor of mathematics at San Jose State University, on theoretical projects having to do with “understanding the symmetries of curves related to their geometry,” as Dr. Alperin explained it.

5c69cf843a125f5075c0a2e8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/17/obituaries/u-tin-dead.html,"U Tin, a slide guitarist who became a global ambassador for Burmese music while working as a plumber under a military dictatorship, died on Feb. 5 in Yangon, Myanmar. He was 87. His daughter Daw Win Win Toe said the cause was complications of diabetes. Mr. Tin was one of several prominent Myanmar musicians who incorporated Western instruments into a diverse canon that spanned folk tunes, classical Burmese music linked to ancient royal courts, and songs from the country’s 1950s-era cinematic golden age. In addition to guitar, he played banjo, mandolin and Burmese harp. Mr. Tin moved to Yangon in 1947, a year before the country, then known as Burma, gained independence from Britain. He found work as a plumber and began studying music. After a military coup in 1962 plunged Myanmar into decades of isolation and extreme poverty, Mr. Tin kept his day job and mostly steered clear of the regime’s state-sponsored traditional music and dance troupes. But he kept playing music, and his reputation as a brilliant slide guitarist grew, thanks partly to people outside Myanmar who invited him to perform around the globe. U Tin was born in the southwestern town of Kyaik Lat on July 8, 1931, to U Ba Aye and Daw Than Yi, both farmers. When World War II broke out, many residents of nearby Yangon, then known as Rangoon, fled to the surrounding countryside as the city came under attack by Japanese bombers. Some of them turned up in Mr. Tin’s town, and they happened to be musicians. “I got the chance to learn from them,” he said years later. Mr. Tin’s main instrument was a steel resonator guitar, similar to one played in American blues and country music by performers like Jerry Douglas and Son House. He played it sitting down, with the fretboard lying over his lap. It is unclear precisely how these guitars, which have roots in Hawaiian music, made it to Myanmar. One influence appears to have been Tau Moe, a Samoan guitarist who had been educated in Hawaii and performed in Yangon in the late 1920s, said Kit Young, a Washington-based scholar of Burmese music and a founder of Gitameit Music Institute, a nonprofit community center and music school in Yangon. But Mr. Tin was not much interested in the American style. Instead, he tuned his guitar to a Burmese scale and played within the rich musical terrain he already knew. Traditional Burmese music, from the country’s Bamar ethnic majority, features gongs, drums, harps, oboes and bamboo xylophones, among other instruments. It typically has syncopated, staggered phrasing and a tonal system unfamiliar to most Western listeners. Over the years, Mr. Tin studied with some of Myanmar’s finest musicians, including the guitarists Weiza Ba Saw Gyi and U Sein Maung and the singer and harpist Daw Saw Mya Aye Kyi, who had herself learned from court musicians for King Thibaw, the country’s last king. He also played with several musicians who had made their name in Yangon’s post-independence cultural heyday. A video from 1961 shows him playing with the Burmese singer U Aunt Gyi (and two Americans) on the lawn of the American ambassador’s residence. “We called him the living music dictionary,” said U Ne Myo Aung, the director of Gitameit Music Institute. In addition to his daughter Daw Win Win Toe, Mr. Tin is survived by his wife, Daw Cho Cho; two other daughters, Daw Win Win Nwe and Daw Myint Myint Nwe; and six grandchildren. His three sons died before him. Mr. Tin won a number of national prizes and played on the Burma Broadcasting Service. But there was never much money in that, and he kept working as a plumber at the Yangon City Development Committee until he was 60. Ms. Young said that Mr. Tin did not “kowtow” to the military junta that ruled the country for decades, and that the regime would not have wanted to send him abroad because the slide guitar was not a traditional Burmese instrument. But in the twilight of his career, Mr. Tin was often invited privately to perform abroad as an ambassador of that very tradition. He performed in Japan, Thailand, Germany, the Philippines and elsewhere. Ms. Young said his performances often received rapturous receptions, including a 2003 concert at the Asia Society in New York City. “Everybody went bananas,” she said. In his later years, Mr. Tin also worked at Gitameit Music Institute. He saw his mission as to somehow keep the old songs he knew alive. But the younger generation was not interested, he told a reporter in 2010, around the time that a half-century of repressive military rule was beginning to ease. “If the music is lost,” he said, “Myanmar will lose a piece of its soul.” "
5c5375f83a125f5075c0769d,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/obituaries/jean-guillou-dead.html,"Jean Guillou, a French organ master whose modern-sounding compositions, unusual transcriptions and idiosyncratic performances challenged centuries of tradition and were preserved on more than 100 recordings, died on Jan. 26 in Paris. He was 88. His death was announced by his music publisher, Schott Music. Mr. Guillou (pronounced ghee-YOU) never lost the capacity to shock in a career of nearly eight decades, from his beginnings as a church organist while still a child through the half-century he spent in one of the most important organ posts in France, at the church of St. Eustache in Paris. He bucked performance traditions; transcribed music by composers who could seem an odd fit for the organ (including Stravinsky, who had dismissed the organ by saying that “the monster never breathes”); wrote ambitious organ works in his own idiom; and helped design new organs that challenged conceptions of how the instrument should look and sound. “Guillou proved that organists need not follow the orthodox path,” Cameron Carpenter, a young American organ star with a punkish demeanor and unorthodox approach of his own, wrote in an email. Critics, and other organists, sometimes harrumphed at the interpretive liberties and flights of fancy that Mr. Guillou took in a time in which the trend, especially in early music, was toward historical fidelity. After a performance at Riverside Church in New York in 1982, the New York Times music critic Allen Hughes, while praising Mr. Guillou’s “astonishingly fleet” fingers, complained in his review that Mr. Guillou had “let his enthusiasm for organ gadgetry and color possibilities take precedence over the rhythmic solidity and interpretive scale and poise that make for art in performance.” But his flamboyant style was a revelation to many. Michael Barone, the host of Pipedreams, the American Public Media radio program about the organ, recalled that Riverside performance as thrilling. “When he would sit at the organ, it was almost as if the organ would explode, or burst into flames,” Mr. Barone said in an interview. “He would reach deep into the depths of the spirit of music, and he challenged the dynamic and technical capabilities of the instrument.” Mr. Guillou shrugged off the criticism. Stephen Tharp, an organist who studied with him, said Mr. Guillou had “played the organ repertoire with ideas that were very individual, and he did so without apology.” He recalled Mr. Guillou telling him, “If you’re still upset with anything that happens in the organ world, you haven’t spent enough time in it.” Although Mr. Guillou passed much of his life playing in churches, he also saw it as his life’s mission to “emancipate this instrument from the bonds of the church” and make it part of the larger music world, his biographer, Jörg Abbing, said in an email. His transcriptions were colorful — including organ versions of Bach’s “Goldberg” variations and works by Liszt and others. He once wrote of his transcription of Mussorgsky’s “Pictures at an Exhibition,” one of his most popular, that it could “only be justified to the extent that it makes us forget that it is a transcription at all, with the new instrument merging into the essence of the work.” And his own compositions were often daring — including “La Révolte des Orgues,” scored for nine organs and percussion, which became something of a cult organ piece, and “Alice in Organ Land,” for organist and narrator. The organist Paul Jacobs, who is the chairman of the organ department at Juilliard and has played Guillou works, said that despite his reputation as an enfant terrible, Mr. Guillou exhibited great refinement in his music. “His music can be shocking, full of crashing dissonances, with a carnal, rhythmic energy to it,” Mr. Jacobs said in a telephone interview. “But I’ve always found that there’s just that French sense of proportion, of knowing when you don’t go beyond a certain point.” Jean Victor Arthur Guillou was born in Angers, France, on April 18, 1930, to Victor and Marguerite Guillou. His father was a natural gas salesman. Jean was pressed into service playing the organ at a local church before he was even a teenager. He studied at the Paris Conservatoire with Marcel Dupré, Maurice Duruflé and Olivier Messiaen, spent time in Lisbon and Berlin, and was appointed organist at St. Eustache in 1963. Survivors include his wife, Suzanne, a professor and writer, and a daughter, Béryl Zuccarelli, said Giampiero Del Nero, the president of Augure, an association devoted to Mr. Guillou’s work. Mr. Guillou was always thinking about ways to modernize the organ. His designs were incorporated into new instruments around the world, including one shaped like a giant hand at a church in L’Alpe d’Huez, France, and another (now being replaced) that was used for nearly three decades at the Tonhalle concert hall in Zurich. His book “The Organ, Remembrance and Future” (2010) traces centuries of organ history while making the case that organists should not be hampered by tradition. Mr. Guillou recorded for the Philips, Decca and Dorian labels among others. His recordings preserve many of his performances of Bach, Liszt, Schumann, Brahms and his own compositions, and he appeared as the soloist in a recording of Saint-Saëns’s Symphony No. 3, the “Organ Symphony,” with the San Francisco Symphony. He taught hundreds of organists, giving master classes in Zurich regularly. Jean-Baptiste Monnot, who studied with him there and became his assistant at St. Eustache, said that Mr. Guillou had urged his students to find their own approaches to music, telling them, “Every time you interpret a work, you should have the sensation that you’re premiering it.” As Mr. Guillou himself put it in 1996 in an interview with Mr. Barone for Pipedreams,“Nothing is worse than to play in such a way that the organ seems to be a dead machine.” "
5c40868d3a125f5075c04e8f,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/arts/music/stradivarius-sound-bank-recording-cremona.html,"CREMONA, Italy — Florencia Rastelli was mortified. As an expert barista, she had never spilled a single cup of coffee, she said. But last Monday, as she wiped the counter at Chiave di Bacco, the cafe where she works, she knocked over a glass and it shattered loudly on the floor. The customers all stood still, petrified, Ms. Rastelli recalled. “I was like: Of all days, this one,” she said. “Even a police officer popped in and asked me to keep it down. I was so embarrassed.” The people of Cremona are unusually sensitive to noise right now. The police have cordoned off streets in the usually bustling city center and traffic has been diverted. During a recent news conference, the city’s mayor, Gianluca Galimberti, implored Cremona’s citizens to avoid any sudden and unnecessary sounds. Cremona is home to the workshops of some of the world’s finest instrument makers, including Antonio Stradivari, who in the 17th and 18th centuries produced some of the finest violins and cellos ever made. The city is getting behind an ambitious project to digitally record the sounds of the Stradivarius instruments for posterity, as well as others by Amati and Guarneri del Gesù, two other famous Cremona craftsmen. And that means being quiet. A Stradivarius violin, viola or cello represents the pinnacle of sound engineering, and nobody has been able to replicate their unique tones. Fausto Cacciatori, the curator of Cremona’s Museo del Violino, a museum devoted to musical instruments that is assisting with the project, said that each Stradivarius had “its own personality.” But, he added, their distinctive sounds “will inevitably change,” and could even be lost within just a few decades. “It’s part of their life cycle,” Mr. Cacciatori said. “We preserve and restore them, but after they reach a certain age, they become too fragile to be played and they ‘go to sleep,’ so to speak.” So that future generations won’t miss out on hearing the instruments, three sound engineers are producing the “Stradivarius Sound Bank” — a database storing all the possible tones that four instruments selected from the Museo del Violino’s collection can produce. One of the engineers, Mattia Bersani, said that the sounds in the database could be manipulated with software to produce new recordings when the tone of the original instruments degraded. Musicians of the future would be able to “record a sonata with an instrument that will no longer function,” he said. “This will allow my grandchildren to hear what a Strad sounded like,” said Leonardo Tedeschi, a former D.J. who came up with the idea for the project. “We are making immortal the finest instrument ever crafted.” Throughout January, four musicians playing two violins, a viola and a cello will work through hundreds of scales and arpeggios, using different techniques with their bows, or plucking the strings. Thirty-two ultrasensitive microphones set up in the museum’s auditorium will capture the sounds. “It’ll be physically and mentally challenging for them,” said Thomas Koritke, a sound engineer from Hamburg, Germany, who is leading the project. “They’ll have to play hundreds of thousands of individual notes and transitions for eight hours a day, six days a week, for more than a month.” Organizing the project had also taken a long time, Mr. Koritke added. “It took us a few years to convince the museum to let us use 500-year-old stringed instruments,” he said. Then they had to find top musicians who knew the instruments inside out. Then the acoustics of the auditorium, which was designed around the sound of the instruments, had to be studied, as well. In 2017, the engineers thought their project was finally ready to get underway. But a soundcheck revealed a major flaw. “The streets around the auditorium are all made of cobblestone, an auditory nightmare,” Mr. Tedeschi said. The sound of a car engine, or a woman walking in high heels, produces vibrations that run underground and reverberate in the microphones, making the recording worthless, he explained. “It was either shutting down the entire area or having the project not seeing the light of day,” Mr. Tedeschi said. Luckily for the engineers, Cremona’s mayor is also the president of the Stradivarius Foundation, the municipal body that owns the Museo del Violino. He allowed the streets around the museum to be closed for five weeks, and appealed to people in the city to keep it down. “We are the only city in the world that preserves both the instruments and their voices,” Mr. Galimberti said. “This is an extraordinary project that looks at the future, and I’m sure people from Cremona will understand that closing the area was inevitable.” On Jan. 7, the police cordoned off the streets. The auditorium’s ventilation and elevators were turned off. Every light bulb in the concert hall was unscrewed to eliminate a faint buzzing sound. Upstairs in the museum, Mr. Cacciatori put on a pair of velvet gloves and took a 1615 Amati viola from its glass display case. He inspected it thoroughly, and then a security guard escorted him and the instrument down two flight of stairs to the auditorium. The curator handed the instrument to Wim Janssen, a Dutch viola player, who walked to the center of the stage. He sat on a chair in the semidarkness under a cluster of microphones. The three engineers left the hall, and took their seats in a soundproofed room beneath the hall filled with speakers and computer screens, servers and cables. Mr. Janssen wore an earpiece, through which Mr. Koritke relayed instructions. “Go,” Mr. Koritke whispered. The violist played a C-major scale as the recording team watched graphs on their screens responding to the crisp sound of the instrument. Mr. Tedeschi grinned in satisfaction. Then it happened, and they froze. “Stop for a moment, please,” Mr. Koritke said, and the violist held his position. The engineers rewound the recording, and played it again. Mr. Koritke heard the problem, loud and clear: “Who dropped a glass on the floor?” "
5cace78849f0eacbf1f8204e,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/09/arts/music/ben-monder-david-torn.html,"Can a jazz guitarist touch the void? What role can darkness play in improvised music, which has historically been built on a spirit of earnest collaboration and bright, restorative energy? The guitarists Ben Monder and David Torn have been building their musical legacies for over three decades, and both approach those questions in their work. But listen to their latest albums — Mr. Torn’s pummeling, acid-drenched “Sun of Goldfinger,” which came out last month; Mr. Monder’s moody and entrancing double CD, “Day After Day,” due out Friday — and you’ll find two very different ways of answering. Mr. Monder uses only a modest rack of pedals, and his music is elegantly determined and precise. Mr. Torn’s goes the other way: multidirectional, constantly adding conflict to already precarious situations. If Mr. Monder’s music stares into the void, Mr. Torn’s seems as if it’s just been released from it, and is now fleeing in search of safer ground. It’s no coincidence that David Bowie hired both of them, at different stages in his late career, to collaborate: Mr. Torn on his post-9/11 album, “Heathen,” among others; Mr. Monder on “Blackstar,” Bowie’s bleak final masterpiece. Young guitarists seeking fresh approaches and a new hybridity between their instruments and gear are increasingly treating jazz, metal and electronic music as interrelated systems. Mr. Monder’s and Mr. Torn’s separate careers over the past three decades have set the table for Rafiq Bhatia, Anthony Pirog and Ava Mendoza, to name a few. And their work continues to be at least as creatively vital as their younger counterparts’. Since the early 1990s, Mr. Monder, 56, has established a shadowy but unmistakable sound: He plays chords in a low-lit, humming tone or a blurred, finger-plucking wash; usually he wedges one or two misfit notes in the middle of his harmonies, making them sound conflicted. And he has a decisive, slow-handed way of soloing, though you wouldn’t necessarily know it from most of his albums. On records, he usually composes lengthy pieces full of intricate harmonic weaves, with hardly any room for improvisation — a testament to his early infatuations with jazz-rock fusion and classical music. “Day After Day,” however, is different. It’s Mr. Monder’s first collection of covers, and Disc 1 is his first extended foray into solo-guitar recording. The second CD finds him in a trio, playing relatively straightforward renditions of popular songs by Bob Dylan, Burt Bacharach and Fleetwood Mac — and, yes, soloing. On his other albums, he’s so distinctive that it can be hard to pin down any individual big influences. On this album, the importance of the fusion guitarist Ralph Towner and Jim Hall, the master of harmonically rich, 20th-century jazz guitar, becomes clear. Mr. Monder played in two of the most important large ensembles of the 1990s — the Maria Schneider Orchestra and Guillermo Klein y Los Guachos — and developed symbiotic partnerships with figures such as Paul Motian, the fabled drummer, and Theo Bleckmann, a virtuoso vocalist. Last year, he served as the linchpin on Dan Weiss’s well-received project “Starebaby,” an explicit marriage of jazz and metal. Mr. Monder has a print of a small, phosphorescent De Chirico painting on the wall in his practice room at home in south Brooklyn. “There are paintings that seem to convey what I’m trying to sound like,” he said on a recent Saturday morning, considering the image’s metaphysical qualities. His tall frame was coiled up on his stool, and his demeanor was warm but reticent; he ended most statements with a self-effacing joke. He described a recurring dream that he said the painting always reminds him of. “I’m in a room, which is flooded with light, and I’m practicing, and I’m able to play just, anything,” he said. “It’s super inspiring, and I always wake up and I’m like, ‘Where did that go?’” If Mr. Monder’s fantasy is about finding an unobstructed path from idea to execution, Mr. Torn’s is almost the opposite: He likes to surround himself with as much clutter and complication as possible, and figure a way out. In addition to his formidable fleet of pedals and electronics, the 65-year-old musician has built three signal-interrupter buttons into the body of his electric guitar, so that at any moment he can snap himself out of an improvisation’s flow by triggering silence, or a screeching tone, or a sample of something being played by another musician onstage. “I want these things to be random enough that I’m surprised by them,” he said breezily in a recent interview. On “Sun of Goldfinger,” he is joined by the alto saxophonist Tim Berne (a longtime collaborator) and the drummer Ches Smith for two 20-minute-long improvisations. A third, equally long track, “Spartan, Before It Hit,” also features the pianist Craig Taborn and a string quartet, playing a long composition full of saxophone melodies that are sometimes doleful and sometimes strident. Different instruments echo and add friction to each other, and then midway through the performance, the written piece ends and a squall of atonal playing erupts. Eventually it flattens out into near-silence, leading to a long denouement. The album feels like an extension of Mr. Torn’s other recent releases, “Prezens,” with a quartet, and “Only Sky,” his first solo-guitar recording. Both albums were almost entirely improvised then edited afterward. Movement and narrative become secondary to the feeling of being ensconced in sound; your ear is caught in a battle between gravity and weightlessness. Mr. Torn, like Mr. Monder, grew up outside New York City and was inspired by the pyrotechnics of classic rock and fusion. And he too found his way toward a ruminative, personal style. Mr. Torn’s father was a sound engineer who designed stereos, and David grew up thinking not just about music but about sound, as an element with its own dimensions and layers. He had a formative experience at 16, watching Jimi Hendrix play at the Woodstock festival, his guitar soaked in distortion. “That made me rethink everything,” Mr. Torn said. Mr. Torn’s music has always tilted toward the atmospheric, and in the 1990s he started creating film soundtracks. He played on the scores to “The Big Lebowski,” “Traffic” and “A Knight’s Tale,” among others, before starting to compose entire soundtracks himself in the 2000s. It was during this period that he suffered a life-changing brain injury, and lost the ability to hear in one ear. It was a great hardship, but Mr. Torn treated it as just another part of life’s ongoing improvisation. “Life is a continuum in most ways, so an interrupter can be a part of the continuum,” he said, explaining that he had to relearn how to listen to music. “I think my great love of distortion became very fine-tuned.” Performing last month at the Big Ears Festival in Knoxville, Tenn., he played a solo set one day, and with the “Sun of Goldfinger” trio the next. In Mr. Torn’s playing there were elements of Hendrix’s snaky, blues-based improvisations, and elsewhere, the thickness and wide-open empty power of doom metal. Whether he was evading darkness or running straight into it, this music had levels of history built in, and a mind of its own. "
5c830aaf49f0eacbf105c292,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/obituaries/peter-hurford-dead.html,"Peter Hurford, a British organist, composer and choir director known for his incisive, buoyant recordings of Bach, died on March 3 in St. Albans, England, just north of London. He was 88. His death was announced by the St. Albans International Organ Festival, which he founded in 1963. Mr. Hurford made his name internationally by recording Bach’s complete organ works for Decca in the late 1970s and early ’80s. When the record industry was booming, such an encyclopedic endeavor was almost the norm for organists of stature. Many managed it once; a few, like Helmut Walcha, achieved it twice; Marie-Claire Alain somehow did it three times. But while other organists might have had a loftier vision for this music, none played it on record with quite the commitment to authenticity and the all-around good sense of Mr. Hurford. His playing was “characterized by brisk tempi, a strong sense of rhythm and highly articulated musical lines,” Thomas Trotter, the organist of the city of Birmingham and St. Margaret’s Church, Westminster Abbey, wrote in an email. “At the time it was a breath of fresh air, and a revelation to hear the music of Bach dance.” The New York Times music critic John Rockwell wrote in 1983, when the Bach cycle was completed, that while “Mr. Hurford is not the flashiest or most eccentric of players,” his Bach was “deeply, eminently satisfying.” Simplicity and clarity defined Mr. Hurford’s approach to the organ. And although he often played grander Romantic works, he saw the century or so between the birth of Buxtehude in 1637 and the death of Bach in 1750 as the pinnacle of his instrument. For a chapter on Bach in “Making Music on the Organ,” a handbook he published in 1988, Mr. Hurford took a verse from Keats that reflected his effective, straightforward approach: “Beauty is truth, truth beauty, — that is all/Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Peter John Hurford was born on Nov. 22, 1930, in Minehead, Somerset, England, the son of Hubert Hurford, a lawyer, and Gladys (James) Hurford. He trained under the composer and organist Harold Darke and became an organ scholar at Jesus College, Cambridge, where he studied music and law. After military service and further study with the French organist André Marchal, who inculcated in him a love of the Baroque, Mr. Hurford became organist at Holy Trinity Church, in Leamington Spa in central England. In 1958 he became organist and master of the music at St. Albans Cathedral, just north of London. Firmly rooted in the tradition of English church music, and a composer of organ and choral pieces himself, Mr. Hurford remained at St. Albans until 1978 and oversaw the installation of a new organ there by the English builder Harrison & Harrison. Andrew Davis, the music director of the Lyric Opera of Chicago and a boyhood student of Mr. Hurford’s, recalled his “incomparable music-making, boyish charm and infectious enthusiasm,” especially during the construction of the organ in St. Albans. “He was, every week, like a kid with a new toy,” Mr. Davis said in an email. “One day I remember ascending to the organ loft to find him grinning from ear to ear. ‘Go and stand by the Positive,’ he said, ‘the Crumhorn has arrived!’ ” Mr. Davis recounted, referring to a section of pipes and its new addition. “He played a chord on the new stop and almost blew my head off.” In addition to the Bach project, which Mr. Hurford reprised by performing the works for BBC radio, he made solo recordings for Decca of composers including César Franck, Felix Mendelssohn and Paul Hindemith. He also recorded Handel’s Organ Concertos with Joshua Rifkin and Saint-Saëns and Poulenc with Charles Dutoit. In the early 1980s Mr. Hurford was visiting artist in residence at the Sydney Opera House, where he oversaw the completion of the organ in its concert hall. He served as president of the Royal College of Organists from 1980 to 1982 and was made an officer of Order of the British Empire in 1984. In 1955 he married Patricia Matthews, who died in 2017. His survivors include a daughter, Heather; two sons, Michael and Richard; and nine grandchildren. Mr. Hurford performed the works of Bach in a series of 15 concerts at the Edinburgh Festival in 1997. In an interview, he was asked what made Bach’s music so powerful. “It’s his simultaneous mastery of technique and ability to convey what is deepest in his spirit in the music that he writes,” he replied. “The challenge is one of expressing this on an instrument which is arguably the most difficult to make music on — the organ.” "
5c7719a049f0eacbf105a883,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/27/obituaries/mark-hollis-dies.html,"Mark Hollis, the frontman for the British band Talk Talk, which had synth-pop hits in the early 1980s before veering into a more experimental sound that influenced a generation of musicians, has died. Mr. Hollis, about whom personal details are scarce, was widely reported to have been 64. A Facebook page devoted to the group confirmed the death, citing Keith Aspden, Mr. Hollis’s former manager, but provided no further details. Talk Talk was formed in London in 1981, when new wave and synth-pop groups like A Flock of Seagulls and Duran Duran were beginning to receive heavy airplay. Talk Talk’s biggest hits, among them “It’s My Life” and “Such a Shame,” were typical of the style: buoyant songs built on catchy, danceable beats and Mr. Hollis’s plaintive lyrics. The band at first consisted of Mr. Hollis on vocals, guitar and piano, Lee Harris on drums, Paul Webb on bass and Simon Brenner on keyboards. Mr. Brenner left after the group released its first album, “The Party’s Over,” on EMI in 1982, and Tim Friese-Greene became the band’s producer and unofficial fourth member. Talk Talk toured with Duran Duran and broadened its American audience with videos on MTV. But its songs never quite attained the mainstream popularity of other synth-pop groups. “It’s My Life,” the group’s highest-charting single in America, peaked at No. 31 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1984. The success of the album, also titled “It’s My Life,” that featured that song gave Talk Talk free rein to experiment. On its next albums, “The Colour of Spring” (1986) and “Spirit of Eden” (1988), the band drifted away from synth-pop into music that defied easy description. The languid songs on “Spirit of Eden” included elements of free jazz, blues, contemporary classical, industrial and ambient music as well as rock, with Mr. Hollis’s quavering vocals floating over it all. Later critics hailed the album as a precursor of post-rock, which became widespread in the 1990s. In a  video interview, Mr. Hollis said of “Spirit of Eden”: “Everyone who comes and plays on this album is given absolute freedom, has no direction at all in what they play.” He added, “And then you assemble an arrangement from that so you end up with something which is very tightly constrained.” The new sound was groundbreaking, and some critics were enthusiastic about it, but it was far from the marketable pop that EMI wanted, and the label eventually dropped the band. Talk Talk released another album, “Laughing Stock” (1991), on Polydor, then disbanded. Mr. Hollis largely receded from view after that. His last album was “Mark Hollis” (1998), an intimate, mostly acoustic offering that ended with nearly two minutes of silence. Nigel Reeve, a record executive and friend of Mr. Hollis’s, told The Guardian in 2012 that Mr. Hollis had no regrets about walking away from his rock star life. “In all the conversations I have with him, he says: ‘I did it. Full stop.’ He got to where he wanted to go,” Mr. Reeve said. Talk Talk’s influence outlasted the band: Aspects of its sound are echoed in music by groups like Radiohead and Sigur Rós. No Doubt reached No. 5 on the Billboard chart in 2004 with a cover of “It’s My Life,” and Sean Carey of the popular indie group Bon Iver described Mr. Hollis as “a hero of ours.” Mr. Hollis said little about his past, but the music website Pitchfork and other outlets reported that he was born in London in 1955. No information about his survivors was available. By most accounts he studied to become a child psychologist, then worked as a laboratory technician. His brother Ed, a disc jockey who managed punk groups, helped Mark get the attention of record labels after Mark formed a short-lived band called the Reaction in the 1970s. The group broke up when Mr. Hollis met the musicians who would join him as Talk Talk. "

Port Illustrated. 340 pp. Scribner. $28. Like a lot of paradigm-shifting inventions, the solid-body electric guitar seems inevitable in hindsight. Someone was bound to realize that a steel string could be hugely amplified by a magnetic pickup and an external speaker, blasting an electronic signal. Someone was bound to come up with a design that felt familiar and comfortable to a working musician. And someone would certainly figure out how to manufacture the instrument as an affordable mass-market commodity. But the actual advent of the solid-body electric guitar, sometime in the 1940s, was a tangled tale of tinkerers, craftsmen, musicians and businessmen who hardly realized what they had unleashed. In “The Birth of Loud,” Ian S. Port, a critic and guitarist who was the music editor for The San Francisco Weekly, has sorted out the facts of the electric guitar’s much-mythologized genesis and cultural conquest. He turns them into a hot-rod joy ride through mid-20th-century American history. With appropriately flashy prose, he dismantles some misconceptions and credits some nearly forgotten but key figures. He also summons, exuberantly and perceptively, the look, sound and sometimes smell of pivotal scenes and songs. Port frames his scrupulously sourced narrative with two thoroughly disparate characters who converged on the same idea and have archetypal guitars bearing their names: Les Paul and Leo Fender. “Their personalities and worlds were as far apart as any in music could be: One’s arena was primarily the stage, the other’s, the workbench,” Port writes. Clarence Leo Fender was a perpetually rumpled, unassuming, self-taught radio repairman, an intuitive engineer and non-musician who decided to build guitars and amplifiers. “His enjoyment of the instrument,” Port writes, “stemmed from the precise pattern of harmonics produced by its strings. Where others heard music, Leo Fender heard physics.” Lester Polsfuss, a.k.a. Les Paul, was a world-class guitarist and self-promoting showman who was also a technological visionary, fascinated by electronics and studio production. “Les Paul wrestled with the knowledge that even being a virtuoso on the guitar would not bring the fame he craved,” Port writes. “Les now began to see his guitar playing as one element in a larger project: a whole new sound that would combine his brilliant musicianship, the pure electric guitar tone he wanted, and radical new recording techniques he envisioned.” The electric guitar was no single individual’s invention. Amplified guitars had appeared in the early 1930s, when companies including Gibson and Rickenbacker put pickups inside acoustic guitars to play them through amplifiers. Yet beyond a certain volume, amplified sound waves bouncing around inside a traditional guitar’s hollow body would create screaming feedback. But that problem had been solved by a different instrument: the Hawaiian or steel guitar, distilled down to just strings, a neck and pickups heard through an amplifier. They were played horizontally, as a lap steel guitar, or built into a tabletop with pitch-shifting pedals as country music’s pedal steel guitar. Concentrating on Fender and Paul, Port mentions but doesn’t explore the groundbreaking solid-body lap steel guitar sold by Rickenbacker in the early 1930s or other short-lived, solid-body six-string guitar progenitors. In the mid-1940s, Fender turned his radio repair shop into the Fender Electric Instrument Company, manufacturing steel guitars and amplifiers. Both he and Paul had been thinking about a solid-body electric guitar. Les Paul built one for himself in 1940 out of a 4-by-4 plank and an existing guitar neck. He called it “the Log,” performed with it (adding the sides of a guitar body) and brought it to the Gibson company in the early 1940s as a potential product. “After Les left,” Port writes, “the managers chortled among themselves about that crazy guitar player who wanted Gibson to build a broomstick with pickups on it.” In 1943 Fender and a collaborator put pickups on a solid oak plank and shaped it like a narrow little guitar. They built only one rough model, but for years they rented it out steadily to local musicians who loved the amplified sound. It was, Port writes, “a misfit stepchild of a guitar that extended creative expression past what any other standard model allowed.” Neither Fender nor Paul got past his prototype until the 1950s. While Fender struggled to keep his existing factory in business, Paul was thriving as a musician, backing Bing Crosby and others. Paul had turned his Hollywood garage into a home studio: a magnet for musicians and a place to experiment with recording technique. At Les Paul’s studio, Fender, Paul, and a designer and meticulous custom-instrument craftsman named Paul Bigsby brainstormed a solid-body guitar, consulting with musicians. One was the country music star Merle Travis, a Bigsby client. Travis dared the designer to build him a thin, solid-body electric, sketching it in detail. Bigsby built it in 1948. Fender studied it, but knew it was too luxurious. He came up with something simpler, eliminating fine woodworking and its sculptural glued-on neck; his neck was bolted on and easily replaceable, for a guitar that could be manufactured, affordable and practical. “This was the leap from classical design to modernism; from the age of walnut to the age of celluloid; from the America of brick-and-iron cities to the America of stucco-and-glass suburbs,” Port writes. Fender unveiled a solid-body six-string in 1950 and was backlogged with orders by 1951. That was the year Paul’s pop career skyrocketed. In a duo with his wife, the singer and guitarist Mary Ford, Paul used his multitrack studio to create giddy, futuristic, chart-topping versions of standards like “How High the Moon.” The venerable Gibson company had quietly been developing its own solid-body guitar, with a more elegant shape, advanced pickups and smoother sound than the twangy Fender Telecaster. Although Paul didn’t design it — a myth Gibson cultivated — he tweaked it slightly and lent his mad-scientist credibility to the Les Paul Model, Gibson’s first solid-body electric guitar. Meanwhile, Fender came up with the Stratocaster, a curvy, seductive shape contoured to a player’s body. The competition was on, joined by other companies. Leo Fender had another far-reaching idea, introduced in 1952: an electric bass guitar that was far more portable, louder and crisper than a classic bass fiddle. And as rock ’n’ roll took over popular music, he met the demand for bigger, louder amps — including one that deafened him in one ear while he was repairing it for the surf-rock guitarist Dick Dale — and for effects, like reverb, that separated the electric guitar even further from its acoustic ancestors. Musicians took it from there. Electric guitars increasingly defined rock ’n’ roll, driving out pianos and horn sections. Guitarists cranked up and dirtied up the clean, warm sounds that Fender and Paul had tried to engineer; Jimi Hendrix embraced feedback with a vengeance. (His 1969 Woodstock Festival rendition of “The Star-Spangled Banner” gets its own, climactic chapter of Port’s book.) The synergy of guitars, amplifiers and effects spawned new idioms, while manufacturers’ profits rose and fell with hit makers’ equipment choices. The latter part of “The Birth of Loud” juxtaposes breakthroughs by musicians — Muddy Waters, Eric Clapton, Hendrix, the electric bass players Carol Kaye and James Jamerson — with the up-and-down individual and corporate fortunes of Fender and Paul. Fender sold his company in the mid-1960s, but kept tinkering with other companies. Paul saw his pop style eclipsed by rock ’n’ roll and his namesake Gibson model discontinued, only to have his guitar resuscitated by British blues-rockers and his playing eventually cherished by jazz fans. In the digital era, guitars no longer rule popular music. Port recognizes that Paul left another, perhaps larger legacy: He was “the first player to claim the studio as an instrument, a move so common today that we often forget to remark on it. Les aimed to control not only the music that went onto the canvas of recorded sound, but everything about the canvas itself: the framing, the immaculateness of the background, the depth and layering of the sounds, and where it hung on the viewer’s wall.” But “The Birth of Loud” rightfully celebrates an earlier time, when wood, steel, copper wire, microphones and loudspeakers could redefine reality. Tracing material choices that echoed through generations, the book captures the quirks of human inventiveness and the power of sound. "
5c6ad6dd3a125f5075c0a46b,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/18/opinion/the-year-jazz-came-into-its-own.html,"The Armistice to end World War I brought elation and a sense of relief to millions of Americans, but also a jolt of reality. The country had only been in the conflict for 19 months, but it had already adjusted to the rhythms and strictures of a society on a total-war footing. When it ended so abruptly, the result was a sudden permissiveness in the culture, a weakening of social rules and an opening for new ideas, creating a fertile atmosphere for America’s new, unruly musical child: jazz.  What was jazz? It had no real definition; it referred to many things. The year 1919 is usually not considered an important marker on the jazz timeline, but that year subtle yet compelling forces took hold that would turn this invasive novelty into something with far more clarity and promise as an art form. It was the year jazz came into its own. Feb. 17, 1919, was a cold, overcast New York day that threatened snow. Tens of thousands of people had come to the streets of Manhattan for a victory parade. At the corner of Fifth Ave. 60th Street, a crowd packed the sidewalks and clustered onto a grandstand, vying for a glimpse of the returning heroes parading northward.  Along the route marched the 369th Infantry, a highly decorated all-black regiment that had just returned from a year in France. The Germans, whom they flushed from their trenches, called them “blutdürstige schwarze Männer,” or “bloodthirsty black men” — or more respectfully, “Hellfighters.” The French government gave the unit the Croix de Guerre for its bravery. On cue, the cheering crowd fell into an abrupt hush, as line upon line of soldiers appeared, proceeding in immaculate precision. “For a moment there was almost complete silence, as the throngs of men and women gazed upon the dark-skinned warriors who had beaten the best regiments of veterans the enemy could send them,” wrote The New York Tribune.  Nearly all accounts of the parade singled out the 369th’s band, under the direction of Lt. James Reese Europe, an immensely successful and well-known African-American musician. The press consistently referred to them as a “jazz band,” whose “jazz music” had become the sensation of France. Even Gen. Henri Gouraud, a staid and dignified French commander, was enthralled, and made his headquarters wherever the band was stationed. Lieutenant Europe was already known as the “Jazz King.” Such praise marked the first time anything associated with jazz had received such glowing approval. In 1919, jazz, or “jass,” as some still called it, was a peculiar word with musical and sexual connotations. It could be noun, verb or adjective, indicating pep, liveliness and noise. Jazz was the new counterculture dance music replacing ragtime — but more dangerous, disorderly and discordant, consisting of random, wrong-sounding musical obstreperousness and percussive turmoil. The music had been considered a scourge on polite society, particularly by whites, even if many of them had no idea what the word meant. Now, thousands — both white and black — cheered Europe’s “jazz” band. They kept the “jazz music” under wraps at first. Marching along, Europe kept his men reined in, playing dignified military music, matching the solemnity and discipline of the moment. But as they passed 60th Street, where the crowd became more and more densely populated with African-Americans, the band let loose with “That Moaning Trombone” and other syncopated numbers. Verve and enthusiasm stood in bold relief.  James Reese Europe was born in 1881 in Mobile, Ala., and raised in Washington, D.C., where he studied violin, piano and composition. In 1903, he relocated to New York, seeking work as a musical director and composer. There he associated with the black musical cognoscenti of Manhattan, including Bert Williams, J. Rosamond Johnson and Bob Cole. He became New York society’s favorite band leader, charming the likes of the Vanderbilts, and was musical director for Vernon and Irene Castle, a popular pair of white dancers. Along the way he mentored a string of future musical stars, like Noble Sissle and Eubie Blake. Although historians often associate Europe with ragtime and jazz, his focus was on neither. He wanted to create music that he believed reflected the artistic temperament and souls of African-Americans, whatever style it took, and to use it to promote the validity and viability of Negro musicians. In 1910 he formed the Clef Club, a union for New York’s black musicians, along with the enormous Clef Club Symphony Orchestra, which emphasized instruments that he felt were commonly used by black musicians: banjo, mandolin, bandora and harp guitar. In interviews, Europe avoided the word “ragtime,” simply calling it “Negro music.” The orchestra performed lavish concerts — several at Carnegie Hall — featuring works by black composers like Will Marion Cook, William H. Tyers and Europe himself. It played marches, concert pieces, tangos and waltzes, with a sprinkling of ragtime. Europe’s reputation as a purveyor of ragtime and “proto jazz” is based on recordings made in 1913 and 1914. Of these, “Castle House Rag,” a Europe composition, captures our imagination today, offering a rare glimpse into black dance music, partly read and partly played by ear. Exciting and edgy, it has hints of “Shortenin’ Bread” and what might be described as “country ragtime.”  Few who heard Europe’s music were acquainted with the dance music then brewing in New Orleans, which some regarded as “ragtime played by ear.” Because it went largely unrecorded during the 1910s, it would be years before the rest of the country could hear the rhythmic drive and hot quality of its pioneers, like King Oliver, Freddie Keppard and Jelly Roll Morton. One exception was the Original Dixieland Jazz Band, who made a recording in 1917 that was listened to from California to New York. Many musicians tried to copy their seemingly discordant approach, and failed. Most couldn’t hear, beneath that mélange, the band’s harmonic and rhythmic order, spontaneous sounding counterpoint and interlocking parts. Musicians copied the effects — the musical veneer. Capturing musical essence was a far more complex task than aping the obvious. And yet 1919 was the year when that began to change. In March, the Original Dixieland Jazz Band sailed for England, to tour British theaters. While there, they rerecorded a number of their old hits, along with two waltzes, unlikely choices for a New Orleans jazz band. Still, those recordings, “Alice Blue Gown” and “I’m Forever Blowing Bubbles,” have the propulsion and lilt that characterized New Orleans. More and more people, far outside New Orleans, were suddenly hearing, and enjoying, jazz. As they did, New York bands began to get the swing of the music. In March 1919, a group from Coney Island called the Original Memphis Five emerged with a streamlined version of the Original Dixieland Jazz Band’s style. They made hundreds of recordings between 1921 and 1929.  Nineteen-nineteen was also the year that a young cornetist named Louis Armstrong, who had been electrifying patrons of New Orleans saloons and honky-tonks with his distinctive sound, began to set his sights beyond his hometown. Armstrong possessed a rare gift for fusing disparate types of music that moved him — he had command over the passion of blues, excitement of ragtime, and the poignancy of operatic and classical melodies. His was the unnamed music of New Orleans: organic, confident and sincere. Playing on Mississippi riverboats, his horn was heard for the first time outside of New Orleans. Inevitably, young musicians like the trombonist Jack Teagarden and the cornetist Bix Beiderbecke heard Armstrong; within a few years, both of these young men would emerge as jazz originals in their own right. Armstrong had received much of his early experience working in the band led by trombonist Edward Ory, known as Kid. Ory's contribution to early jazz was in creating one of the most fundamental voices of the jazz band: a style known as “tailgate trombone,” which became the model for most that followed. Ory left New Orleans in August 1919 for California. He soon settled in Oakland, leading a fine jazz band at the Creole Café. In the summer of 1922, Ory’s band would become the first black New Orleans jazz band to make recordings. Armstrong’s mentor, Joe Oliver, moved to Chicago in 1917. By 1919 he was one of the busiest musicians in town, giving Chicago a taste of the Crescent City’s hot music. In 1922 he sent for Armstrong to join his Creole Jazz Band as the second cornetist. The 1923 King Oliver recordings would spread New Orleans music — some called it “jazz” — throughout the land.  On the very day of the 369th’s parade, 2,900 miles to the west, a struggling dance orchestra leader named Paul Whiteman was recovering from a nervous breakdown. A violinist formerly with the San Francisco Symphony, Whiteman had become fascinated with the sensuous, unpolished sounds he heard from musicians in Barbary Coast saloons. He attempted to notate this strange music, orchestrate it and normalize it. Hiring the best “jazzers” in town, Whiteman formed a dance band to play at the Fairmont Hotel. Taxed by overworked and worry, he collapsed, and soon left music, and San Francisco, behind. But he didn’t stay gone. Whiteman moved east, in 1920, and drew national attention when he signed a contract with the Victor Talking Machine Company. Striving to “make a lady” of jazz led to his fabulous 1924 concert “An Experiment in Modern Music,” which premiered Gershwin’s “Rhapsody in Blue.” Whiteman became known as the “King of Jazz,” a moniker which — while he never took it literally — served him well. He went on to hire Frank Trumbauer, Beiderbecke and others, a dream team of young jazz musicians. By the mid-1920s, jazz was firmly in place as the reigning American popular music style. All that was in the future as Europe and the 369th wrapped up their parade through Manhattan. Soon afterward they were mustered out of the service. For most, there was no question what they would do next: Reforming the band as civilians, they set out to tour the East Coast and Midwest. According to a review of their show in Philadelphia, The Evening Bulletin wrote: “Many ragtime, jazz time and popular air tunes were played with a swing, a swerve and a tempo that lifted the soul as well as the feet of the listener and carried him away to the Land of Shuffling Feet.” Though they were praised for their jazz, Europe and his band ranged widely. He typically programmed light classical overtures, specialties like “Evolution of Dixie,” some ragtime, and medleys of syncopated hits under the rubric “A Potpourri of Jazz.” A recording of a medley they often played on the road, “Plantation Echoes,” contains not a speck of jazz, or ragtime, by anyone’s definition. But the crowds demanded jazz, and Europe gave it to them — not only on the stage, but in interviews, where he tried to explain this new form. As he told The Newark Evening Ledger, “Lots of people think jazz is easy. It’s as hard as anything. The French bandmasters thought we had trick instruments. They’d ask to examine our instruments and then cry in surprise ‘Meme que les autres’ — ‘The same as the others.’ You see we get those special effects with a roll of the tongue and blowing the instrument about twice as hard as usual.” Europe’s comments reflected commonly held beliefs about jazz: It was about effects, such as distorting the embouchure to produce fluttering effects. Europe was a master tactician, and provided good copy. The band’s recording of “Memphis Blues” illustrates their approach to jazz. The final minute displays many of the effects Europe described: crying clarinets, flutter-tongued cornets, trombone glissandos and a “shave and a haircut” ending. There is one exception: a surprise solo “break” by a trombonist who tosses off an insouciant, swinging phrase. That break, only two measures long, speaks volumes: a rarity on such an early recording, signifying the exciting nature of jazz as it was still maturing. On May 9, 1919, the band arrived in Boston, to perform at Mechanic’s Hall. Europe, suffering from a cold and exhaustion, courageously pushed himself through the concert’s first half. During intermission, an altercation erupted when a disgruntled musician entered Europe’s dressing room and attacked him with a penknife. The injury, which seemed at first superficial, was anything but. Europe died a few hours later.   In a flash, James Reese Europe was gone, the band broke up, and postwar excitement and acceptance for jazz were temporarily forgotten. Nevertheless, Europe’s final testament had a lasting legacy. During that final tour, a wide range of Americans had begun to realize that jazz was something of which they could be proud. Photos from the parade, with jazz-playing musicians surrounded by returning soldiers, made it clear that this was a homegrown, even patriotic, art form. The old notion about “jazzing” suddenly seemed quaint. “Jazz” had become a noun. Europe’s dream, to see African-Americans accepted as serious and respected performers, lived on through his two closest associates, Noble Sissle and Eubie Blake. Their 1921 Broadway hit “Shuffle Along” was in a sense, a tribute to their mentor and friend. Looking at 1919 from both sides of a timeline clarifies how pivotal this year was for jazz. On one side there was the diligent, focused work of James Reese Europe, which brought dignity to both African-American musicians and jazz. On the other, Paul Whiteman continued his work legitimizing jazz in the public’s mind. In the middle were the pioneers of the art: Louis Armstrong, his mentors and disciples. Encompassing a span of a decade in a single year, 1919 was the fulcrum of momentous musical activity when jazz — in many forms and many definitions — was nurtured, whether by Europe, Whiteman or the growing number of jazz musicians who understood it.

Let us know at theplaylist@nytimes.com and sign up for our Louder newsletter, a once-a-week blast of our pop music coverage. A couple of months ago, Ariana Grande explained her new strategic philosophy to Billboard: “My dream has always been to be — obviously not a rapper, but, like, to put out music in the way that a rapper does.” Which is to say not on a traditional tightly-controlled pop star rollout, but in the drip-drip-drip fashion of the streaming era, in which artists bombard listeners with music in rapid succession, barely leaving room to reflect. And yet the period leading up to the release of “Thank U, Next,” Grande’s fifth album, which was released on Friday, hasn’t been quite that radical. There were singles, and videos, and now an album — nothing to fear here. The latest single is “Break Up With Your Girlfriend, I’m Bored,” a satisfying thumper with an astral-trap beat and Grande deciding that, in fact, she’d like to be the other kind of rapper as well. Not to say that she’s purely rapping on this song, but rather that rapping as an act has melted so thoroughly that the chasm between what it currently is and what Grande is doing here isn’t very vast. So much so that when she belts out a few lines near the song’s end it sounds like someone else altogether has arrived. (Grande spends the whole video stalking a couple made up of a handsome young man and a Grande doppelgänger. She keeps urging them to split, up until she inserts herself between them, and then she chooses … herself.) JON CARAMANICA “We don’t touch anymore/But we talk all the time so it’s fine,” sings Amber Bain, who records her solo, intricately produced pop as the Japanese House. She’s assessing the later stages of a romance: “Somebody tell me what I want/‘cause I keep on changing my mind.” She surrounds herself with synthesizers and vocal harmonies that can reflect the dizzying swirl of remembered infatuation or the steady trudge of everyday partnership; when the song ends, she still hasn’t figured things out. PARELES A path to solace is indirect and uncertain in “Noise,” the first release from the Brooklyn-rooted songwriter Zsela (whose father is Marc Anthony Thompson, a.k.a Chocolate Genius). Her voice is sumptuous and her phrasing is curvaceous and conversational in “Noise,” a hushed ballad that moves with the rhythm of breathing, not machines. Its backdrop subtly shifts from the sparsity of a lone electric piano to subdued orchestral instruments, and its chords start out unresolved and move in and out of hymnlike uplift, as she ponders the breakups of others and her own: “Cannot count the ways you used to love me,” she muses. “But I can count the ways you used to try.” JON PARELES How sensitive can a guy be? This sensitive. “Can’t we just talk/figure out where we’re going?,” Khalid pleads. There’s a tryst, with “flowers in the room,” but also a reckoning; whatever happens will have to be consensual. The loop has hi-hat sounds and syncopated synthesizers — from Disclosure — as Khalid hops between tenor and falsetto. The result of this negotiation isn’t guaranteed. PARELES Cool-kid pop made by the kids hiding out under the bleachers, “Homework” is a soothing, crypto-melancholy anthem about reflecting on young love. Kim Petras has a warmly synthetic voice, and lil aaron raps in a reassuring tone — together, they’re a sweet, effective pair, delivering teen-flick coming-of-age sparkle with little flickers of gone-too-far darkness. CARAMANICA This ghostly whisper of a waltz is from “Quiet Signs,” the new album by Jessica Pratt. Like the rest of the album, the backup is minimal — acoustic guitar picking, a few notes from a piano — and the production’s low-fi hiss makes Pratt’s soprano even wispier. She sings about singing in “Crossing,” with words dissolving into wordless syllables, turning into an elusive lullaby. PARELES The trumpeter Christian Scott aTunde Adjuah’s pieces often feel like something more than songs, or at least outside of them. They’re like a film composed only of long and powerful shots: The music starts intense and grows more so — comfortable at a steadfast medium tempo, not needing a lot of harmonic movement to swell and push onward. On “Ancestral Recall,” the title track from Scott’s forthcoming album, the focus is squarely on the drums and percussion, which maintain a rabbling, six-beat groove adorned by little more than a ghostly synthesizer and Scott’s scorching trumpet. Then there’s the poet Saul Williams, uttering lines that unpack the tune’s title: “Earth as my hard drive, sky as my witness/There’s no such thing as small spirits, ancestral minorities/Take breath through nature’s hidden forces.” GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO Bassekou Kouyate, from Mali, plays the ngoni, a West African lute that’s a likely ancestor of the banjo, and he leads Ngoni Ba, featuring ngonis of various sizes down to a bass ngoni. “Miri” (“Dream”), the title track of his new album, is an instrumental reverie based, the liner notes say, on worries about Mali’s Islamist insurgency and about climate change. Its fingerpicked vamp carries insistent minor-key melodies and a little bit of ngoni shredding. PARELES A New Orleans jazz band — clarinet, trombone, her own banjo — backs Leyla McCalla in the title song of her new album. The wryly old-fashioned slow-drag setting belies the hardheaded economic realism of “The Capitalist Blues,” a theme statement for an album full of songs about trying to get by in a ruthlessly market-based world. “I am swimming in an ocean of sharks,” McCalla sings, graceful but resigned. PARELES More cheerily melodic tragedy from the Savannah, Ga., rapper Quando Rondo, who is signed to the imprint of the Baton Rouge realist YoungBoy Never Broke Again. In its production, “Gun Powder” has some of the lighthearted toughness of the early T.I./Young Jeezy era, but the real amusement is in how Quando Rondo almost smirk-shrugs his way through some very bitter words: “Send a text to all the opps like, yeah, we want all the smoke/We up by 6, they down by 2, they need to go fix the scope.” CARAMANICA Miho Hazama, a Japanese-born, classically trained composer, is starting to make waves in New York. On Friday she released “Dancer in Nowhere,” her latest album with m_unit, an ensemble combining typical elements of a jazz big band with strings, vibraphone and French horn. The title track starts with the violins in a tentative, prickly dance, before the tenor saxophonist Jason Rigby alights, playing a repetitive melody — unresolved but deeply satisfying — over a bed of strings and horns. A heavier, more percussive section barrels in, with a melody derived from the original line. The song ends back on that soaring first passage, the band playing faster now and Rigby improvising into the beyond. RUSSONELLO With the slow, misty grace of a requiem, “Memories of Nanzenji” finds the keyboardist and crossover-jazz guru Mark de Clive-Lowe reflecting on a visit to the historic temple and gardens in Kyoto, Japan. Featuring a quintet that includes the whirling alto saxophone of Josh Johnson, this tune appears on “Heritage,” a new album out on Friday. It was largely recorded during a run of shows at the Blue Whale in Los Angeles, then de Clive-Lowe augmented the recordings in the studio, adding layers of synthesizer and more. RUSSONELLO I’m old enough to remember when 5 Seconds of Summer was a punk band! I’m old enough to remember when the Chainsmokers were … well, not quite good, but not this bad! If you are less old than I am, here is a song to order Sweetgreen to. CARAMANICA "

Offset’s marital troubles with Cardi B sent him to the celebrity doghouse, but he’s lately re-emerged in search of a public rebrand — devoted husband, committed father and newly introspective rapper. The title track of his solo album, “Father of 4,” is a plea for understanding directed toward his young children. He lists them off, explains how he’s done them wrong, then promises to do better. CARAMANICA The Haitian band Lakou Mizik, which was formed after Haiti’s catastrophic 2010 earthquake, has remade the New Orleans standard “Iko Iko,” a pop hit (for the Dixie Cups and others) based on half-understood Mardi Gras Indian chants that may have Haitian roots. Lakou Mizik added lyrics in Haitian Kreyol proclaiming the Haiti-New Orleans connection; the 79rs Gang, a Mardi Gras Indian alliance, sings the New Orleans chants. Hooting horns from Haiti’s rara carnival tradition mix with the Preservation Hall Jazz Band; there’s percussion from all sides and an earth-moving bass. Mardi Gras is March 5; the cultural cross-pollination, and the party, continue. PARELES The Oscars are Sunday, which means you only have a few days to absorb all the covers of “Shallow” from “A Star Is Born,” including this sharp late entry from Jimmie Allen and Abby Anderson, young country singers with R&B inclinations, who harness the song’s raw power and shellac it with a layer of controlled cool. CARAMANICA The music in “The Barrel” is folky and straightforward, circling through four chords fingerpicked on an acoustic guitar behind Aldous Harding’s demure voice. The words are the conundrum: cryptic, imagistic and distinctly wary of some undefined commitment: “Looks like a date is set/Show the ferret to the egg/I’m not getting led along.” And the video clip, with some surprises near the end, gives nothing away. PARELES On her new album, “Intuition: Songs from the Minds of Women,” the vocalist Alicia Olatuja chose a wide range of songs written by female artists — from Joni Mitchell to Angela Bofill to Imogen Heap — and set about making a new imprint on each. Her album-closing rendition of “This Woman’s Work,” by Kate Bush, features nothing but Olatuja’s luminous, classically trained voice overdubbed a handful of times, wound together in an airy, a cappella arrangement. Bush’s version was an intimate mash-up of ’80s pop and folk song and musical theater; Olatuja has found a way to honor what made it so distinctive, while creating a whole new sound. RUSSONELLO Michael Rother, the guitarist from the 1970s Krautrock trailblazers Neu! (and briefly before that, Kraftwerk), has collected a boxed set of his solo work, including previously unreleased tracks like this one from the score for the 2015 film “The Robbers.” It unfolds methodically, with an octave-bouncing line somewhere between bass riff and mantric melody; three-and-a-half minutes in, some clanking, chattering electronics arrive to give it precisely the lift it needs. PARELES The hypnosis continues. Gunna remains the most clever and intuitive rapper of the post-Young Thug generation, and on “Baby Birkin” — a standout from his new “Drip or Drown 2” — he circles again and again to a rhyme scheme that bleeds across the conventional bar structure, making the final syllable of each phrase into a de facto leadoff rhyme. The result is you never quite know if you’re coming or going, if the end is in front of you or just behind. It’s intoxicating. CARAMANICA Norah Jones has been collaborating widely lately, flexing genre boundaries; this track will be on an album collecting those experiments. “Just a Little Bit” leans toward jazz and Minimalism, with the meticulous Brian Blade on drums carrying a syncopated pulse as Jones sustains a drone on organ and ornaments it sporadically on piano. Her voice is approachable as always, but what she is singing is more confrontational. “I’m not the one you can refuse/I’m not your plaything, I’m not your muse.” Rightfully: This is not a time to take women for granted. PARELES One of the great disappointments of the tail end of the SoundCloud rap boom is how thoroughly its anarchic instincts have been all but wrung out of it. Sometimes, when you hear Lil Pump rap, he sounds like … a regular rapper. Which is fine, of course, if less fun. “Harverd Dropout” is his first full-length album, and while it features successful collaborations with Kanye West, Lil Uzi Vert, YG, 2 Chainz, Quavo and others, it’s most impressive when an awareness of the rest of the world is filtered out. Take “Vroom Vroom Vroom,” an agglomeration of interjections, sound effects, bass throbs and more, slapped atop each other chaotically. It’s exuberant fun, a return to the moment when what Lil Pump and others proposed was a new idea, a radical notion, an essential urge. CARAMANICA Contemplating the optimism of space travel and discord on Earth, Bruce Hornsby delivers a swinging, Minimalistic chamber-pop hoedown, an Aaron Copland-tinged romp with yMusic’s horns and strings ricocheting all around Hornsby’s percussive piano clusters. It’s genial and upbeat, but far from complacent. PARELES The tenor saxophonist Chris Potter, the drummer Eric Harland and the keyboardist James Francies lock into a big-boned, contemporary-jazz groove about a minute into “Hold It,” and you start to hear voices crowding the room. It’s almost all Potter, overdubbed on top of himself, before the dubs drop out and he launches into one of his characteristically herculean solos. This track is from “Circuits,” a new album announcing a fresh band, but one that harkens to the electrified, funk-fusion group Underground, which Potter led about a decade ago. Nowadays, jaw-dropping technical displays are the norm for Potter, but this band can still get something new out of him. RUSSONELLO This full-length song from Tierra Whack keeps things minimal, as she sings and raps over a two-bar, two-chord loop, plus or minus a drumbeat. In an assortment of voices, none of them all that perturbed, she severs her ties to a guy who’s selfish, stingy, dishonest, unfaithful and distracting her from her career. “I don’t wanna work it out,” she informs him, “so cancel our gym membership.” PARELES Here's the thought process behind a breakup, telescoped into five minutes by the three sisters in Teen. It's exposed at the start — a piano, a beat, a voice — with lyrics like “I don’t know why I still pretend that you could still be, maybe, my man.” Then, as details emerge about past conflicts and current letdowns, synthesizers join the chords and the sisters add harmonies to conclude, “I can’t pretend any more.” It's heartsick and triumphal at the same time. PARELES On his new album, “Preminger Plays Preminger,” the tenor saxophonist Noah Preminger honors his great-uncle, the director Otto Preminger, whose noir films were often known for their use of poignant, haunting music. (Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn famously scored “Anatomy of a Murder.”) With help from a stellar, acoustic-jazz quartet, Noah covers pieces from the old movies’ soundtracks, as well as some original compositions inspired by them. “For the Man with the Golden Arm” — an outtake left off the album, which was released on Friday to Newvelle Records subscribers — falls into the latter category; the saxophonist channels the circumspection and the longing of the 1955 film’s original soundtrack into a watery, wandering melody. Preminger overdubs multiple tenor saxophone parts, which paddle around each other and rest gently on Jason Moran’s rippling piano accompaniment. RUSSONELLO "
5c7043073a125f5075c0b101,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/22/arts/music/pretty-yende-la-fille-du-regiment-met-opera.html,"It is a brief, charming moment — and subtle enough that some audience members may miss it. But it speaks loudly as a symbol: the distinctive clicks of Zulu, the African language, echoing from the stage of the Metropolitan Opera. It comes during Donizetti’s comedy “La Fille du Régiment.” Pretty Yende, the bel canto soprano singing the title role — Marie, an orphan raised by an army regiment — ad-libs a brief spoken monologue as her character gives vent to overwhelming, conflicting emotions of love and frustration as she deals with laundry and peels potatoes. In this production, by the director Laurent Pelly, the moment has always been an opportunity for singers to depart from the French libretto in a rush of words and sounds, flights of verbiage that leave subtitles in the dust. When Ms. Yende, 33, made the part her own in the current revival, she decided to incorporate Zulu, which she grew up speaking in South Africa. As the broader field of classical music lags in diversity — and as opera companies have sometimes struggled to preserve what is great about works like “Aida,” “Otello,” “Madama Butterfly” and “Turandot” while jettisoning their outdated, often offensive portrayals of non-European cultures — it sends a powerful message. Ms. Yende, an international star who is on the cover of this month’s Opera News, spoke about how she came up with her Zulu moment for “Fille,” which will be broadcast live in cinemas worldwide on March 2. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation. Could tell me a little bit about how this came about? It started in one of the rehearsals, when I was doing the debut in Seville, Spain — instinctively, because it’s not scripted. I couldn’t find the vocabulary for what I truly wanted to say, that emotional part of Marie. And so I just started speaking Zulu. The whole room, they were like, “We weren’t expecting that!” I wasn’t expecting it, either, but somehow, emotionally, I went that route. I didn’t want to plan it, because it’s one part in the show where she doesn’t know what she’s saying. She’s in so many emotional states. She’s in love, and she’s afraid, and she wants everything. And so when I started doing it in Zulu, the director was then like: “That’s interesting. It actually works. Do you want to keep it?” I was like, “Sure!” What are you saying? It happens just after the man you love visits you at the regiment and is dragged off. Well it’s different every night. The rough translation is: “Oh, my goodness, I really wanted to kiss him more, but what can I do? I have to work, now he’s gone! O.K., fine, I have to do what I need to do. This doesn’t have to be here, it has to be here! So that I can work properly. And then, of course, what can one do? It’s the military: left, right, left, right!” But one thing that you probably heard was the clicks when I say “ingqondo,” which is “mind.” What does it feel like to be able to speak Zulu at the Met? It feels so wonderful because I never thought of having this kind of possibility to be able to literally have a piece of my true self onstage. We embody these characters, and we go through their emotional journeys. And we are somewhat restricted to their texts, and the music of course, and sometimes the production as well. But somehow this production has allowed me this incredible privilege to actually show literally that a part of me is in the music, too. Saying that this is Pretty, and she’s playing Marie. And these two human beings are meeting together to express a common human emotional state. Because I, too, when I am crushing on a boy, don’t have words sometimes. That happens; it’s a human experience, which is truly wonderful. When you were studying in Cape Town, were there Zulu operas that you sang?  No, unfortunately not. Composers have just recently started to really show interest in composing South African stories and operas. So who knows? Maybe next time at the Metropolitan Opera I wouldn’t have to improvise — it would actually be written down. It seems like the South African opera scene is growing, with singers like you and the bass-baritone Musa Ngqungwana and the soprano Golda Schultz, who is currently in the Met’s “Falstaff,” appearing around the world.  There’s incredible talent in my country, and if you think I’m the only one that can do what I do, it’s a big mistake. You’ll find 10, 20 people able to do that. The beauty is that each and every person, of course, they have their own unique gifts and the way they use it. But as far as talent is concerned, and opportunities — especially when it comes to black artists — it has really enhanced them and made them believe that they too can be able to express themselves this way. Because many others, before Mandela was released, were never given that opportunity. So we are just enjoying this time. And the operatic world has truly opened its doors for us. In a sense, I think that music, as we’re dealing with harmony, is teaching the world that truly there shouldn’t be barriers. We can live in harmony and express our humanness together, through the arts. "
5c6190b73a125f5075c0916a,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/11/obituaries/nancy-b-reich-dead.html,"Nancy B. Reich, whose seminal 1985 biography of Clara Schumann established her as an important musical figure independent of her husband, the composer Robert Schumann, and helped turn the musicological spotlight on female composers, died on Jan. 31 in Ossining, N.Y. She was 94. Her death was confirmed by her daughter, Susanna Reich. Throughout her career, Dr. Reich fought to redress belittling portraits of Clara Schumann by earlier authors and to have her recognized as a significant composer, pianist and educator, as well as a central figure of German Romanticism. The decades that followed the publication of her book, “Clara Schumann: The Artist and the Woman,” vindicated her efforts with an explosion of both public and scholarly interest. Doctoral dissertations, anthologies and histories of music by women proliferated. Scholarly editions of Clara Schumann’s music for piano appeared, fueling an increase in performances. Dr. Reich’s death coincided with the beginning of a yearlong festival in Leipzig, Germany, for the bicentennial of Clara Schumann’s birth there. She died in 1896 and left behind compositions including songs, works for solo piano, chamber music and a piano concerto. But when Dr. Reich first turned her attention to the subject in the 1970s, Clara Schumann was noted primarily for her relationships with men. These included her father, the stern pedagogue Friedrich Wieck, who groomed her for pianistic stardom from an early age; her husband, with whom she had eight children before his death in a mental institution in 1856; and Brahms, with whom she came to be bound by a love that was deep but probably platonic. In her book, Dr. Reich relegated the Brahms strand of the story to a single chapter. “It was a most significant chapter, to be sure,” she wrote in her introduction, “but it was not the consuming central relationship that so many people have suspected.” Her take was a far cry from the “example of noble, pure and true womanhood” that the first biography, completed in 1908, made her out to be. A typical assessment of her status was found in John N. Burk’s “Clara Schumann: A Romantic Biography” (1940), which prized Robert’s work over Clara’s career as a touring virtuoso, even though she made much more money through her concertizing than he did with his compositions. For Mr. Burk, Robert was “an artist for eternity” while Clara was “a concert-giver for the moment.” The musicologist Judith Tick said in a telephone interview that Clara Schumann “was seen primarily as a muse,” adding: “Her life was assumed to pivot between two poles, Robert Schumann and Johannes Brahms. And Nancy’s book destroyed that, while tempering the sensationalist assumptions about Clara Schumann and Brahms.” Nancy Bassen was born on July 3, 1924, in the Bronx to Hyman Bassen, a writer and labor activist, and Ida (Orland) Bassen. After Hyman’s death in 1931 the family moved to Ithaca, N.Y., where Nancy’s brother, Jonas, was a student at Cornell University. Ida ran a boardinghouse for Jewish and black students who were not welcome in college dorms. After the family moved back to New York City, Nancy attended the High School of Music and Art, where she played violin and viola. She obtained a bachelor’s degree in music at Queens College in 1945, the same year she married Haskell Aaron Reich, who later became a physicist. Dr. Reich’s husband died in 1983. Her longtime companion, the biochemist Maurice M. Rapport, died in 2011. In addition to her daughter, a children’s book author, her survivors include a son, Matthew, and three grandchildren. In a telephone interview, Susanna Reich said her mother’s ambitions for an academic career had been cut short after she completed a master’s at Columbia University’s Teachers College in 1947. When she applied for a doctoral program at Columbia, her daughter said, “the interviewer asked her if she was married, and when she said yes, the interviewer told her to go home and take care of her husband.” Finally, in 1972, when Dr. Reich was 47, she obtained her Ph.D. from New York University. Buoyed by the women’s movement and intrigued by a stash of letters she came across, she dove into the life of Clara Schumann. Her research often took her behind the Iron Curtain, since many collections of documents were kept in what was then East Germany. “She had to register at every police station in every town she went to,” Ms. Tick, the musicologist, said. The sources themselves called for psychological detective work. While Clara Schumann left copious letters and diaries, many of those from her childhood were supervised, or even written, by her father. As a married couple, Robert and Clara kept a joint diary. In her work Dr. Reich collaborated with a psychoanalyst, Anna Burton, in reconstructing the picture of a musician who was as conscious of her exceptional status as she was conflicted about it. “It’s a very modern story,” Dr. Reich said in an interview with The New York Times in 1996. “Here was a girl growing up with a working mother who was taken care of by a maid, a child of divorced parents. She was left a widow at 36, but she was very independent and refused all loans. When Robert was sick, she went back to the concert stage to pay for his medical bills. She was a working woman. She worked with her hands.” Dr. Reich taught at New York University and Queens and Manhattanville Colleges and was a visiting professor at Bard and Williams. She never won tenure, even though her book, revised in 2001 and translated into German, Japanese, Hebrew and other languages, was well received. Liane Curtis, a musicologist studying the English composer Rebecca Clarke and the president of the Women’s Philharmonic Advocacy, said in a phone interview that it was Dr. Reich who gave her the idea that “having a woman as a subject was worth devoting a big portion of your life to.” "

There’s an amazing little wooden tiger in the American Folk Art Museum’s teaching collection. Made around 1980 in Oaxaca by Manuel Jimenez, the piece is at once so simply shaped and so brightly painted that it comes across less as a depiction of any specific animal than as a vivid realization of the very idea of tigerness.  Starting Jan. 16, you’ll be able to visit it, along with a spotted pig, a yellow fox and a green dog, in the lobby of the Citigroup Building in Long Island City as part of “A Kingdom in Pieces,” where they’ll be keeping company with contemporary animal-focused paintings by artists associated with the nearby Fountain House Gallery. WILL HEINRICH January 17 and 18; bowerypresents.com. There’s a comforting nostalgia to much of the music by Japanese Breakfast, the solo project of the singer-songwriter Michelle Zauner. Her polished sophomore album, “Soft Sounds From Another Planet,” is a lush, sweet take on ’90s shoegaze and dream pop, with hazy layers of reverb-heavy guitar and synths that give her music an organic-sounding richness. But her retro aesthetic sounds fresh, in part thanks to its sharp songwriting and focus on contemporary anxieties. The soothing vibe belies the familiar existential dread in the poetic lyrics. “All of our celebrities keep dying/While the cruel men continue to win,” Zauner sings in “Till Death,” a song she has said is about love. The music, which can be heard live during Zauner’s two-night run at Brooklyn Steel, rewards those who pay close attention. Even her artist name is a way to distinguish who’s a true fan and who’s just along for the ride: She’s Korean-American, not Japanese, and has made her relationship with her identity an important part of her work. As she told Teen Vogue last year, “I think that right now there are a lot of young kids that are pushing marginalized voices to the front, and I think I feel kind of a part of that.” NATALIE WEINER Through Jan. 20, labtheater.org. There are new works, and then there are scripts so fresh from the playwright’s fingertips that they reach the stage with no time for rehearsal. That’s what happened last year at Labyrinth Theater Company’s Barn Series, a festival of new-play readings, the night that the Pulitzer Prize winner Stephen Adly Guirgis presented some fragments of a work in progress. In the minutes before the reading, from his adaptation of the movie “Dog Day Afternoon,” Guirgis stood onstage with a dozen actors, quietly explaining to each of them who they were playing and the circumstances of their scenes. The resulting performance was exhilarating — huge energy packed into the tiny studio space at the Cherry Lane Theater in Greenwich Village, where the free festival is back this week. Elizabeth Canavan’s “Ladies in Waiting,” Brett C. Leonard‘s “Papo” and Mariana Carreño King’s “The Red Gene” are among the plays in this year’s series, which wraps up Jan. 20 with three Guirgis works. One of the plays will get a full Labyrinth production this summer. LAURA COLLINS-HUGHES Through Jan. 20; joyce.org. In the winter, live dance warms you up. The Joyce Theater provides some necessary heat with its Cuba Festival 2019, which features two returning groups. Malpaso Dance Company (through Jan. 13) presents works by Ohad Naharin, Merce Cunningham and up-and-coming Cuban choreographers, while Compañía Irene Rodríguez (Jan. 18-20) offers “Mas Que Flamenco,” a program of short pieces.  Wedged in between is the United States debut of the intriguingly named contemporary company Los Hijos del Director, or The Children of the Director (Jan. 15-16). In “The Last Resource,” choreographed by George Céspedes, who formed the troupe in Havana in 2013, dancers explore the obstacles that Cubans face. Alienation, uncertainty, change — it’s starting to sound all too familiar, in or out of Cuba. But this work, with music ranging from heavy metal and electronica to pieces by Cuban singer-songwriters, promises to be anything but. GIA KOURLAS Jan. 13 and 20; pbs.org. Charles and Diana. William and Kate. Harry and Meghan. But without Victoria and Albert, that phenomenon forever after known as the royal wedding might not exist. In “Victoria & Albert: The Wedding,” airing on Sundays, Jan. 13 and 20, on PBS (check local listings), the British historian Lucy Worsley breathlessly details the first cousins’ path to the altar: the conspiracy to marry them from their births and their fizzled introduction on her 17th birthday (he was plump and had dreadful diarrhea; she liked her gift of a parrot more). Then came their second meeting, when Albert, by then a frog transformed, ignited in the young queen a sensation of “pure, beautiful, gobsmacking love,” as one expert puts it. Get that girl her fan. Worsley then reimagines their 1840 nuptials, devised as the P.R. coup of the century — the better to herald the modern constitutional monarchy — down to Victoria’s white wedding dress, which popularized the color for brides, and a breakfast feast resplendent with skinned hares, taxidermied pigeons (adorning pigeon pies) and a 300-pound fruitcake. The pomp and passion continues as Season 3 of “Victoria,” also starting Jan. 13, finds revolution sweeping across Europe — and the plucky monarch (Jenna Coleman) confronting a crisis that could end her reign. KATHRYN SHATTUCK Jan. 16; filmforum.com. Chela (Ana Brun) and Chiquita (Margarita Irún), the descendants of wealthy families in Asunción, Paraguay, have been partners for 30 years. But in the first frames of “The Heiresses” — opening Jan. 16 at the Film Forum and coming to theaters in other major cities — strangers rifle through their once-opulent apartment as the couple sell off cherished belongings now that their money has run out. So, apparently, has their luck: Chiquita has been accused of fraud and sent to prison, leaving Chela mired in loneliness and encroaching poverty. When a gossipy older neighbor (María Martins) asks Chela for a lift to her card game, she reluctantly begins a sort of taxi service, finding an unfamiliar freedom behind the wheel of her vintage Mercedes. Then Angy (Ana Ivanova) — younger, brash, sexy — climbs into the passenger seat. And something in Chela stirs. Brun, in a fine debut, won the Silver Bear for best actress at the 2018 Berlin Film Festival. And the director Marcelo Martinessi, who says he was inspired by the romance between Paraguay’s petite bourgeoisie and authoritarian regimes, captured the Alfred Bauer Prize for a feature “that opens new perspectives.” KATHRYN SHATTUCK Jan. 16-17; metmuseum.org. The soprano Julia Bullock is in the midst of a hotly anticipated and now widely celebrated five-event residency at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where she has already performed traditional slave songs, settings of poetry by Langston Hughes, a new version of John Adams’s oratorio “El Niño,” and a bevy of other contemporary works.  On Wednesday and Thursday at the Met, she will inhabit the part of Josephine Baker in composer Tyshawn Sorey’s “Perle Noire: Meditations for Joséphine.” Described by The New York Times upon its 2016 debut as “one of the most important works of art yet to emerge from the era of Black Lives Matter,” the work melancholically reimagines songs by this complex icon, with texts by the poet Claudia Rankine. It has continued to evolve in performances by Bullock and the International Contemporary Ensemble, and remains powerfully relevant. As Sorey told The Times, “The lyrical content is timeless, and I wanted to create something musically to reflect what we’re experiencing now.” WILLIAM ROBIN "
5c61bbe43a125f5075c091df,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/11/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-tourism-music-festival.html,"AL ULA, Saudi Arabia — The new Italian-designed concert hall in the middle of the desert shimmered in the sunset light, its walls of mirror reflecting the golden sandstone hills and cliffs. Inside, a symphony orchestra from China rehearsed a Western classical piece, preparing for a concert featuring the Chinese pianist Lang Lang. The serene and lilting notes floated through the empty hall. The concert was part of a series with performances by Andrea Bocelli, Yanni and Majida El Roumi taking place this winter in Saudi Arabia. From the western desert, Saudi Arabia appears to be a different country than the one that has been under constant criticism from American politicians and other international officials since last October, when Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the 33-year-old de facto ruler, was first accused of ordering the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a Virginia resident and Washington Post columnist. The C.I.A. has since concluded that the Crown Prince was responsible for Mr. Khashoggi’s killing, and its strongest evidence includes intercepted conversations. The Saudi government denies he was involved. Prince Mohammed has also come under international criticism for imprisoning human rights activists and detaining hundreds of people in a hotel, as well as for waging a war in Yemen that has fueled what the United Nations calls the world’s worst man-made humanitarian crisis. But at the same time, officials under his rule are trying to build up Saudi Arabia’s tourism and culture industries by promoting events like the music festival. In past years, an event like this would not have taken place in a remote region of the conservative kingdom. The strategy is in line with Prince Mohammed’s efforts to loosen restrictions on entertainment and expressions of popular culture. In developing a tourism industry, officials are focusing on the ancient caravan town of Al Ula in the Hejaz, a western region that has been a crossroads for traders between Mediterranean empires and ports along the Gulf of Aden. “We call this the place of the future,” said Maher Mazan, a manager at Shaden Resort, a new hotel built among rock canyons outside town, where rooms typically go for $440 per night. “If you come back in one year, it’ll be different.” The area’s rich history and archaeological sites have long captivated King Salman, the crown prince’s father. In 2017, the king established the Royal Commission for Al Ula, with the goal of preserving the striking rock archaeology, despite its pre-Islamic origins, and drawing more tourists. The commission also began looking at holding a concert series. The centerpiece of the area is Mada’in Saleh, or Al Hijr, a collection of more than 100 towering tombs carved into hillsides that take on the glow of burnished gold at sunset. This was the southern reach of the realm of the Nabateans, who carved Petra, the famous sandstone city in Jordan. The tombs date back two millenniums, and many Saudis believe them to be cursed, the abode of jinn. Nearby is a preserved station of the defunct Hejaz Railway, an Ottoman-era line built by German and Turkish engineers. By 1908, it ran 800 miles from Damascus to Medina. One afternoon, a guide led a group of foreign visitors by car first to the train station, then to the Nabatean tombs. A guide, Mohammed al-Anzi, said the region had been dominated in ancient times by four different civilizations. Some people had migrated here from Greece, he said, pointing to a carved eagle above a doorway. “Later, the Romans destroyed the Nabateans,” he said. “Civilizations come, civilizations go. This is life, since the beginning of life.” Among the tourists was a Chinese-British couple who gaped at the structures and took photographs and video to post to a Chinese travel website. Walking into one tomb, they asked about three burial niches. Mr. al-Anzi said the custom then was to wrap the dead in animal skins and adorn them with jewelry. Driving out of the area, the tourists noticed abandoned mud-walled homes. “The people were asked to move after this was designated Saudi Arabia’s first World Heritage Site,” Mr. al-Anzi said, referring to a label given by a United Nations agency. The timeless and austere wonders of Mada’in Saleh contrast with the luxury trappings of the music festival, Winter at Tantora. As of early February, at least 30,000 people total had attended the festival’s weekend events, officials said. The festival began Dec. 20 and ends Feb. 23, after being extended two weeks. Hussein Ibish, a scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington, said the entertainment piece of Prince Mohammed’s vision “is very large, and constitutes the revolutionary reintroduction of ‘fun’ to a society in which public entertainments have been basically eliminated for decades.” But because this plan involves exchanges with the West, that creates a conundrum, Mr. Ibish said. “While you are unleashing socially liberalizing and economically modernizing forces that call on, and appeal to, the West — and which must appeal to the West — you’re trying to contain that with a political crackdown that is completely unacceptable and alienating to most Western audiences,” he said. Winter weekends at Al Ula revolve around the concerts, held on Fridays. There are sometimes other notable events, like hot-air balloon rides. The Winter at Tantora website advertises a range of packages for each weekend. All are expensive. For the weekend of the Yanni concert, the prices ranged from $1,400 for a day-trip package (round-trip flight from Jeddah or Riyadh, the capital, included) to $6,000 for a “diamond” weekend package — prohibitive costs for many Saudis. Pop-up restaurants with outdoor seating open among the canyons on weekends. There is a version of Salt, a popular burger restaurant in Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, and Nozomi, a Saudi-run sushi-and-burger restaurant. The visitors sometimes meet local residents of Al Ula in a weekend tourist market, next to the mud homes of the ancient quarter. The festival “has allowed the people of Al Ula to proudly show their home to the world,” said Abdullah al-Khelawi, the royal commission’s head of economic development. He added that the festival provided seasonal work to 1,000 locals. The headquarters of the royal commission, which runs the festival, are in Riyadh, where 100 full-time employees work. “This can start a tourism industry,” said a local driver, Saleh al-Bilawi, 25, who had recently studied criminal justice at an American university. “They employ a lot of drivers just for the winter festival alone.” Mr. al-Bilawi and his colleagues are aware the work is only temporary. Another driver, Faisal, also a university graduate, said he was paid $36 per day and worked only on weekends, but was grateful for the job. The royal commission and the French government have agreed to send 300 to 1,000 local residents to France for training, mostly in the hospitality industry. In September, the first 68 students arrived at Campus France, a French agency, 32 of them women. On Jan. 31, tourists began flying in for the concert by Mr. Bocelli, who was to perform the next night. Most appeared to be wealthy Saudis, although there were some foreign residents of the country, too. The few coming from outside had managed to get tourist visas with the royal commission’s help; Saudi Arabia generally does not give out such visas. A good number of the visitors appeared to be guests of the commission, which was paying their way. An Italian couple sitting in a restaurant at a farm said they had come to Saudi Arabia at the urging of their friend, the Italian ambassador in Riyadh. “We want to see the country before it is affected by the Western world and looks the same as everywhere else,” said Cinzia Chiari, dressed in black robes. “I hope the Saudis realize their treasure and beauty is in its distinct heritage.” "
5c462b963a125f5075c058cf,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/21/obituaries/reggie-young-dead.html,"NASHVILLE — Reggie Young, a prolific studio guitarist who appeared on landmark recordings by Elvis Presley and many others and played a prominent role in shaping the sound of Southern popular music in the 1960s and ’70s, died on Thursday at his home in Leipers Fork, Tenn., just outside Nashville. He was 82. His wife, Jenny Young, said the cause was heart failure. Mr. Young played guitar on hundreds of hit recordings in a career that spanned more than six decades. Among his best-known credits are the Box Tops’ “The Letter” and Presley’s “Suspicious Minds,” both No. 1 pop singles in the late ’60s, and Neil Diamond’s 1969 Top 10 hit “Sweet Caroline.” Mr. Young also played the funky chicken-scratch guitar lick on “Skinny Legs and All,” the soul singer Joe Tex’s 1967 Top 10 pop hit. He contributed the reverberating fills and swells that punctuate James Carr’s timeless soul ballad “The Dark End of the Street,” also from 1967. And his bluesy riffing buttressed the sultry, throbbing groove on “Son of a Preacher Man,” a Top 10 single for the British pop singer Dusty Springfield in 1968. Mr. Young appeared on all these recordings, including those associated with Presley’s late-’60s return to the limelight, as a member of the Memphis Boys, the renowned house band for the producer Chips Moman’s American Sound Studio. Living and working in Memphis, where there had long been a fertile cross-pollinization between country music and the blues, was critical to the development of Mr. Young’s down-home style of playing, a muscular yet relaxed mix of rhythmic and melodic instincts. “In Memphis, it’s sort of in between Nashville and the Southern Delta down in Mississippi, so I’m kind of a cross between B. B. King and Chet Atkins,” Mr. Young said in an interview published on the website Soul and Jazz and Funk in 2017. “Most of the soul music back then was in Memphis,” he added. “That’s where I came from.” In addition to playing guitar, Mr. Young added the psychedelic accents of the electric sitar to a handful of influential recordings, among them the Box Tops’ “Cry Like a Baby” and B. J. Thomas’s “Hooked on a Feeling,” both of which reached the Top 10 in 1968. After American Sound Studio closed in 1972, Mr. Young moved to Nashville, where his soulful less-is-more approach graced hits like Dobie Gray’s “Drift Away,” Waylon Jennings’s “Luckenbach, Texas” and Willie Nelson’s “Always on My Mind.” Mr. Young’s Nashville session credits also include Billy Swan’s “I Can Help,” which topped both the country and pop charts in 1974. Mr. Young made an indelible contribution, especially during his years in Memphis, to the Southernization of pop music in the 1960s and early ’70s. This influence was felt not just by the number of records made in the South that were played on AM radio throughout the nation. It was also evident in the procession of artists, among them Aretha Franklin, Paul Simon and the jazz flutist Herbie Mann, who came from outside the region to make records steeped in the Southern musical vernacular. Reggie Grimes Young was born on Dec. 12, 1936, in Caruthersville, Mo., and was raised in Osceola, Ark., and later in Memphis. His father, Reggie, was an accountant who played Hawaiian-style classical guitar and taught his son to play when he was 14. His mother, Thelma (Mayes) Young, was a homemaker. In 1956 Mr. Young joined Eddie Bond and the Stompers, a rockabilly band that had a regional hit with a record called “Rockin’ Daddy” and opened shows for Johnny Cash, Roy Orbison and Carl Perkins. Three years later he joined Bill Black’s Combo, an instrumental quintet led by Presley’s former bass player. He played on two No. 1 R&B singles with the group, “Smokie” and “White Silver Sands,” before joining the Army in 1960, and rejoined after his return to civilian life in the early ’60s. He arrived just in time to travel with Bill Black’s Combo when it opened for the Beatles on their 1964 tour of the United States. During that tour, Mr. Young had the opportunity to introduce George Harrison to the finer points of his Southern style of playing. “George asked me, because I’m a blues player, ‘How do you bend and stretch your strings like that?’ ” Mr. Young recalled in the Soul and Jazz and Funk interview. “I told him, ‘You have to have light-gauge strings,’ and after that I think he went to lighter gauge strings on his guitar.” A compilation album of 24 tracks from sessions on which Mr. Young played, including recordings by Merle Haggard, Jackie DeShannon and Bobby (Blue) Bland, is to be released by the English label Ace Records this week. In addition to his wife, Mr. Young is survived by a son, Reggie III; a daughter, Cindy Evans; a sister, Alice Weatley; five grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren. Mr. Young played with so many luminaries over the course of his career that he said “it was nothing special” for him and his fellow Memphis Boys to be tapped to support Elvis Presley in the studio in the late ’60s. “We played with all the top stars of the time, and Elvis hadn’t had any hits for a while and didn’t have an album on the charts,” he said in a 2013 interview with Premier Guitar magazine. “As he stepped into the studio though — boy,” he continued. “I never met any other person with such charisma. It was very special for me.” "
5c45982b3a125f5075c05788,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/21/world/asia/teresa-teng-china-beijing-taiwan.html,"BEIJING — A beer in one hand, a microphone in the other, Meng Xiaoli stood in a crowded restaurant and began to sing. Your smile is as sweet as honey, Just like flowers blooming in the spring breeze. I wonder where I’ve seen you. During the workweek, Mr. Meng, 53, a strait-laced budget analyst who wears a red Chinese Communist Party pin on his lapel, spends his days shuttling between meetings and poring over reports as a budget analyst for a state-owned firm. But on weekends, he retreats to what he calls his “spiritual home,” a two-story restaurant and museum in Beijing that is a shrine to the woman he considers a goddess: the Taiwanese pop singer Teresa Teng, one of Asia’s most celebrated artists. “She knows what it’s like to be human — to find love and to make mistakes,” Mr. Meng said. Ms. Teng, who died suddenly in 1995 at age 42, was renowned for turning traditional Taiwanese and Chinese folk songs into maudlin Western-style hits. She was once banned in the mainland, her music denounced by the authorities as “decadent” and “pornographic.” But she never lost her base of rabid fans here, even as tensions have escalated between China and Taiwan, the self-ruled island that Beijing considers part of its territory. Her most ardent followers now gather at the Teresa Teng Music-Themed Restaurant in a sprawling residential neighborhood in western Beijing, near liquor stores, barbecue joints and hot pot restaurants. An enormous portrait of Ms. Teng, smiling as she holds a white rose, graces its front door. Inside, singers dressed in elegant gowns perform renditions of her signature ballads like “The Moon Represents My Heart” and “Sweet as Honey.” Customers sample dishes inspired by Ms. Teng’s music, including “moon pancakes” and fried pumpkin with honey sauce. More than two decades after her death, Ms. Teng’s mainland fans say her sugary voice and gentle personality are still one of a kind. “She’s a storyteller,” said Zheng Rongbin, the media executive who opened the restaurant in 2011. “She looks like the girl next door.” At a recent lunchtime performance, Wu Yingwei, 30, watched as her daughter, Muyao, 2, danced to a performance of “Ask Yourself,” a song that is a staple of karaoke bars in Asia. Ms. Wu said her daughter liked listening only to Ms. Teng’s songs and could sing several of her hits, including “Sweet as Honey.” “Teresa Teng’s style never gets old,” she said. “Her songs are very gentle and make me feel really warm.” Ms. Teng is claimed by many mainlanders as one of their own, even though she was born in Taiwan. Her father, who grew up in the mainland in the northern province of Hebei, was part of the Nationalist forces that fought Mao Zedong’s Communists in the Chinese Civil War. He retreated to Taiwan in 1949, four years before Ms. Teng’s birth. Ms. Teng was one of the first foreign singers whose music flowed into China after it began opening its economy to the world in the late 1970s. But her music was quickly banned as part of a campaign by the Communist government to block “spiritual pollution” from the West. The Taiwanese government used her music as a psychological weapon, blasting it from loudspeakers positioned near the mainland. Tapes of Ms. Teng’s music circulated on a black market in the mainland, and her popularity was clear. Because of her surname, which in Chinese uses the same character as the Communist leader Deng Xiaoping’s, she was sometimes referred to as Little Deng, reflecting her hold on the public imagination. Ms. Teng occasionally veered into politics, holding concerts to show solidarity with the pro-democracy protesters who gathered at Tiananmen Square in Beijing in 1989. She never performed in the mainland. In recent years, however, the government has warmed to her music, and the state-run media has celebrated her mainland roots. In 2011, officials opened a memorial hall in honor of Ms. Teng in her father’s hometown, Daming, where fans now converge on the anniversary of her death. The mainland has at least two restaurants devoted to Ms. Teng, including the one in Beijing, which is at the center of a struggling cultural development known as Taiwan Street. Mr. Zheng, the owner, said Ms. Teng’s music was still popular in the mainland because it reminded people of hearing her songs for the first time in the years after the chaos of Mao’s Cultural Revolution. “For many people, it was a very new experience and very different from what they had heard in the Cultural Revolution,” he said. “Now when people hear it, they remember what it was like to be young.” Ms. Teng has been hailed as a symbol of commonality between China and Taiwan at a time when relations have deteriorated, with President Xi Jinping of China recently warning that efforts by Taiwan to assert independence could be met by armed force. But Mr. Zheng said he did not have politics in mind when he opened the restaurant. “Music has no sense of borders,” he said. The Beijing restaurant, which is officially recognized by Ms. Teng’s family in Taiwan, also includes a museum, on the first floor, displaying some of Ms. Teng’s dresses, pianos and clocks. On the second floor is the performance hall, with a chandelier and a disco ball. On busy nights, hundreds of people pack into the hall, gathering around tables covered with red-checkered tablecloths. Some guests opt for private rooms, where they sing karaoke versions of Ms. Teng’s songs. On a recent night, Wang Liang, 36, paid $15 to request a live performance of “I Only Care About You” for his wife and daughter. “Ever since I was a child, I’ve always liked Teresa Teng’s songs,” Mr. Wang said. “Her songs aren’t as flippant as pop songs now, and they really stick in your memory.” One of the singers at the restaurant, Wang Xin, 25, who was trained as a classical pianist, said Ms. Teng’s supple singing style, rich with vibrato, is difficult to imitate. “The emotions are hard to capture,” she said. “It’s very hard to find the right tone.” She practices by listening to Ms. Teng’s songs on repeat on her phone. At a recent show, Ms. Wang, wearing fake eyelashes and red lipstick to evoke Ms. Teng, approached the microphone to sing one of the pop star’s tougher standards, “What Do You Have to Say?”: I waited for more than a year, Three-hundred sixty-five days isn’t easy, You simply don’t have me in your heart, Give me my love back! "
5c6d72033a125f5075c0a9bc,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/20/arts/music/marc-martel-queen-freddie-mercury-bohemian-rhapsody.html,"There are three things Marc Martel says he won’t do to impersonate Freddie Mercury. He won’t wear Mercury’s trademark yellow jacket. He won’t go onstage wielding Mercury’s favored half microphone stand. And he won’t grow a full mustache. Here’s the one thing Martel needs to do: open his mouth. Through genetics and musical aptitude, the 42-year-old singer is a vocal doppelgänger for the Queen frontman. That’s a gift that has led Martel, formerly the leader of a Christian band in Canada, to a lucrative second career in recent years — and a prominent but invisible role in “Bohemian Rhapsody,” the hit biopic nominated for five Academy Awards at the Oscars on Sunday. It’s not the life Martel planned, but it’s landed him on “American Idol” and in front of crowds of thousands worldwide. “I keep realizing how weird a situation I’m in,” Martel said in a phone interview. “I’m trying to keep a good head about it.” Rami Malek embodies Mercury onscreen, but as he told The New York Times last year, “No one wants to hear me sing.” During the performance sequences in “Bohemian Rhapsody,” the movie sometimes employs Mercury’s actual vocals from the Queen archives, but that wasn’t always practical — some scenes demanded a stunt vocal-cord performer. [Relive one of Freddie Mercury’s great moments: when Queen took “Bohemian Rhapsody” to Live Aid.] The film’s creators have conceded that the sung vocals in the movie are largely by Mercury and Martel, although they haven’t broken down the specifics of who contributed what; doing so might distract from Malek’s performance. Martel, who received a fleeting “additional vocals” billing, acknowledged that he worked on the movie, but citing his nondisclosure agreement, would not go into detail. That leaves him with a ghostly status much like that of Marni Nixon, who provided the singing voices both of Maria in the movie of “West Side Story” (for Natalie Wood) and Eliza in the movie of “My Fair Lady” (for Audrey Hepburn), without credit. Even though Martel doesn’t get the awards-show glamour that Malek is enjoying, he’s proud of his contributions to “Bohemian Rhapsody.” The first time he saw it wasn’t at a red-carpet event: He caught it in Cool Springs, Tenn., with his wife and manager, wearing “our comfy clothes.” He had wanted to enjoy the movie as a spectator, but “I couldn’t help waiting for the next scene where I was going to hear my own voice,” he said. So the Martels bought out a movie theater showing, invited 80 of their closest friends and treated it like a party. Martel grew up in Montreal listening to pop (George Michael was a favorite) and Christian music (his parents worked at a church as pastor and choir director). All he knew of Queen was the scene in the 1992 comedy “Wayne’s World” where the characters rock out to “Bohemian Rhapsody” in an AMC Pacer. He started a Christian rock band called Downhere with some friends in college; in 2001, they signed a record deal and moved to Nashville. He believes that the first person to tell him he sounded like Freddie Mercury was the Downhere bassist Glenn Lavender. It was a compliment, given how Mercury was one of the great singers in rock history, possessing a pellucid tone, a three-octave range and an operatic quality that could make even paeans to bicycle riding sound emotional. But Martel didn’t initially take it as praise. “That’s cool — I sound unoriginal,” he recalled thinking. But he checked out Queen’s greatest hits, hoping to learn something from Mercury (who died in 1991 of AIDS-related pneumonia): “I never thought it would amount to anything more than a fun karaoke trick.” In 2011, however, with Downhere having run its course after seven studio albums, Martel heard that the Queen drummer Roger Taylor was putting together an authorized tribute band called the Queen Extravaganza and won a spot on vocals with an audition video of “Somebody to Love” that went viral. Martel sounds close enough to Mercury that he can itemize the subtle differences: “I’m not British, so I don’t usually sing with an accent. I don’t have extra teeth like he did, so my Ss come out normally — his were very piercing,” he said. “But even if I don’t try to sing like Freddie Mercury, people still hear him in my voice, no matter what I do. I have this weird unique thing where I can sound like him, so why wouldn’t I?” Martel now steadily tours with his own Ultimate Queen Celebration and also does shows with the Black Jacket Symphony and Symphonic Queen. He said the Queen catalog has made him a better singer and inspired him to take better care of his voice — while he felt comfortable backing off a high note in one of his own songs when necessary, he doesn’t like to disappoint Queen fans who expect to hear a song the way they know it from the radio. Last year he released an album of Queen covers, “Thunderbolt & Lightning,” and his YouTube covers of Queen classics have become popular enough that he finds himself recognized in public — especially outside the United States, which was never the band’s biggest market. Martel, who has concerts booked in 14 countries this year, from Ukraine to New Zealand, notes that American crowds generally don’t know the arm movements and clapping that traditionally accompany “Radio Ga Ga,” while international audiences will do it unprompted. Although Queen has been a part of his life for nearly a decade, Martel is still figuring out “what being a tribute artist means,” he said. “For some reason, there’s a stigma around it.” A little defensively, he cited Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley and classical musicians as interpreters of other people’s work. Martel records an annual Christmas EP and still writes songs, but he doesn’t currently have an outlet for them; he dreams of a day when he can throw just one original into a set of Queen covers. He recalled a recent conversation with his manager, who told him, “I’d like you to consider your songwriting the way I view my golf game — I love playing golf, but it’s not what’s paying the bills right now.” That was hard for Martel to hear, but he ultimately accepted its wisdom. “The next five years, there’s going to be a lot of Queen,” he said, and chuckled. “But at the same time, I’m going to work on my golf game.” "
5c351f133a125f5075c036b7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/08/t-magazine/steve-gunn-sachiko-kanenobu.html,"The American musician Steve Gunn first heard of Sachiko Kanenobu a few years ago, when, at the advice of friends, he listened to her debut album “Misora,” recorded in Tokyo in 1972. Gunn, 41, is best known for his neo-folk guitar playing (and as a former member of Kurt Vile’s backing band, the Violators) and has more recently moved into producing albums for like-minded artists. He was instantly taken with Kanenobu’s lush guitar playing and multilayered psychedelic melodies, joining the singer-songwriter’s small but devoted fan base. Born in Osaka in 1948, Kanenobu started to garner attention in her late teens within her country’s burgeoning folk scene. But the year of her album’s release — and before her fame took hold — she quietly moved to New York City with Paul Williams, the music journalist and founder of Crawdaddy magazine, to start a family. Now based in California, she makes music on and off, both solo and with groups, returning periodically to Japan to perform. In 2017, Gunn rediscovered Kanenobu by chance when he heard an interview with her on WFMU radio in New York City, where he’s based; ultimately, a mutual friend connected the two musicians and a creative relationship flourished by text message. Next month, Kanenobu will perform songs from “Misora” for the first time in the States, opening a handful of Gunn’s tour dates tied to the release of his upcoming album, “The Unseen in Between.” Written in the wake of his father’s passing, the songs are sweeping, with intricate finger picking and rich instrumentation, the lyrics meditative and intimate. Gunn also pushed for the reissue of “Misora,” which is slated for next year.  Ahead of all of this, the pair sat down at the kitchen table in Kanenobu’s home in Northern California to discuss their origins, the writing process and their varied inspirations. Steve Gunn: Sachiko, you just came back from Japan. Sachiko Kanenobu: Yes, it was a very special performance. I performed my “Misora” album in Japan, and I’ve never played that album before in public — and it’s 46 years after it was released. I went back to do this concert. It sold out the same month it was announced. I thought, “Wow there are going to be lots of gray-haired people,” but there were so many young people. I was shocked. To me, it’s like I rose from death, like they are seeing a ghost or something. [Laughs] I’m so excited to perform from that album with you — it’s one of my dreams. You really inspired me to play my guitar again. Each time before I play now, I put on your YouTube videos. Your music is just so calm. I’m 70 years old now, and I need that calm energy. Gunn: I do, too, it’s a big part of my music. Kanenobu: You also have a kind of psychedelic quality. That’s what really got me, because I grew up with that type of music, like the Beatles and such. I’ve been in California since 1976, and I lived in New York before that. I got there in 1972. Gunn: You were so steeped in music because of your relationship with Paul Williams. Kanenobu: Paul brought Bruce Springsteen to come see us in New York — it was very early on. He sang two songs for us with an acoustic guitar, that’s an amazing memory. Also, I met Bob Dylan — much later, though, when I was living in California. It was at a ball field in San Francisco, around 1980. Gunn: Had he known Paul? Kanenobu: Yes — and it was a very special concert because Bob Dylan was like a born-again Christian. He had these wonderful backup singers. However, the audience didn’t like it. It was terrible. They booed him. Paul and I went to see him at the end and we talked. I said, “Why do people do that?” And Bob Dylan said, “Change your style and they don’t like it.” Gunn: When I had met you in Sonoma last year and we were kind of becoming friends — and I started talking to you about this label, Light in the Attic, which is going to reissue “Misora” — I told my record-nerd friends that we hung out. And they were like, “Wait, what?” No one really believed me. I don’t think a lot of people knew that you were living in California or in the States. Kanenobu: In 1972, when I first moved to New York, I wasn’t making music because I had two babies, you know. I was mostly taking care of the kids. But Paul played music all the time and I was getting into that. Gunn: When did you start writing music again? Kanenobu: Really when I met Philip K. Dick. He changed my life and got me to play music again. Paul took me to meet Phil when he was living in Sonoma with his girlfriend. He asked, “Are you still writing songs?” I said, “No, I’m very busy, you know?” And he said, “You shouldn’t stop writing, you have a gift.” He made my eyes all jumbly. I was so touched, and felt so deeply. He really illuminated my heart and soul. T: Is it true he started producing one of your records before he died? Kanenobu: He did. He did one single record, “Fork in the Road / Tokyo Song.” At one point, Paul and I drove all the way to see Phil in Santa Ana, where he lived and brought him an older record of mine — he had this big fancy player — but when we tried to put it on, it didn’t work. Phil was really angry. He said, “I’m going to throw this whole system out the window,” and he really started picking it up, but we stopped him. Later, we played him the album and he loved it.  I wrote some new English songs after Phil had told me I should, instead of in Japanese. He started talking about making an album together — he would produce it and he’d be in the studio this time. That was 1982, around February. I was so excited, and then he died in March. It was so sad, the darkest time in my life. He was like my muse. He always called me and encouraged me and read me short stories and made me laugh. I am actually writing a book about the whole thing.  Steve, what was it like working on your new album? Gunn: Well, my producer, James Elkington, is someone that I’ve been playing music with for a bunch of years now, he and I became fast friends. I met him on the road. He’s from England and lived in London in the ’80s, so he’s kind of steeped in this English punk tradition, but he also knows a lot about the folk traditions from England. I’m a pretty idiosyncratic player, and I’ve got my own kind of self-taught style. I think if I was thrown into certain situations people might not really understand where I’m coming from. Jim really understood, he knew exactly what I wanted to do with the album, which was basically record it like the albums that I admire from the ’60s and ’70s, where you kind of hear the band playing live. I wanted this sort of live spontaneity to it. We also had the bassist Tony Garnier — he plays with Bob Dylan — and Daniel Schlett, the owner of the studio. We’re all sort of Dylan fanatics. Kanenobu: Steve, what inspires you? Gunn: I studied art history in college, and when I ended up moving to New York, I worked at a lot of art galleries and was kind of an art handler — I ended up moving a ton of artists’ works and in the process became educated in a lot of minimal artists from the ’60s. Some of them were very interested in music and also were musicians themselves. And a lot of their philosophies correlated with some of the things that I was exploring. Kanenobu: When I was in high school, I used to listen to this album by Donovan, and I actually tried to imitate him. [Laughs] Gunn: Do you remember what album? Kanenobu: The first one, I think. I tried copying it, but it was so difficult, and so I just created my songs out of attempting to play like that. In Japan around 1967, it was all folk and pop music — Peter, Paul and Mary, Pete Seeger, bands like that. Later, I got into the Okinawa scale, which is a unique scale, and not very Japanese in style. And then Takashi Nishioka from the band Five Red Balloons said, “Why don’t you come over and listen to this record? Don’t you feel like it’s kind of what you’re doing?” And it was Joni Mitchell. Then I got influenced by Bob Dylan, of course — I love his words. I started reading his song book and it was kind of like my bible. I also got into the group Pentangle. Gunn: Another favorite of mine. Kanenobu: I got into the guitar, more than the singing. I’m still not a great singer. Gunn: For me, I didn’t sing until later. At first, I was practicing guitar and learning different things and improvising. I got really into playing long-form meditative-style pieces. Also classical Indian music was influential to me. I was trying to figure out how to use that influence and I knew that people in the ’60s used that style, particularly a guitar player named Sandy Bull. When I heard his piece called “Blend,” I kind of emulated that for a number of years and was playing with different kinds of open tunings. T: Are you currently working on new music? Kanenobu: Yes, I’m working on new songs and it’s so exciting because, you know, I thought, “Wow, I’m dead.” Gunn: When “Misora” came out, did you play any shows, or did it just come out and you had already moved on from that? Kanenobu: I’d been playing for a few years before that came out. It’s interesting with that album because everyone said, “Oh, it’s a woman.” You know, back then, there were no women singing with an acoustic guitar. I remember in particular a performance I did in Germany in the late ’80s with my band Culture Shock. I can’t describe it, it was really amazing — everybody was one. I said “I love you” and everyone in the room said back, “I love you.” [Laughs] To me, when you play, it’s very important to give people goodness. Gunn: What’s also interesting for me, with your story, is all of the connections you’ve made throughout your life and how music particularly played a role in it. You can link these experiences because you picked up a guitar when you were a teenager. Kanenobu: If you’re curious and love something, when you get into it and express yourself, that’s what life is about. This interview has been edited and condensed. "

Let us know at theplaylist@nytimes.com and sign up for our Louder newsletter, a once-a-week blast of our pop music coverage. D’Angelo takes his time between releases. How he’s filling at least part of that downtime? Video games. A fan of the Red Dead Redemption series, he was nudged into contributing an original song to Red Dead Redemption 2. “Unshaken” is lonely cowboy-western soul, produced by Daniel Lanois — an incantation for those with bleary eyes and unswerving defiance. JON CARAMANICA A chorus of “oohs” and “ahs” in jazzy chords, circling without resolution, accompanies the Chicago rapper Noname as she calmly zooms down her latest stream of consciousness. Syncopating her rhymes rapidly and precisely over the tricky beat, Noname touches on her success without a record label, African-American representation on TV, mass incarceration, Christmas and all the direct messages she has ignored, among other things. “I sell pain for profit, not propaganda,” she declares. Her producer, Phoelix, also shows up as a singer with an enigmatic, equally unresolved chorus. JON PARELES A fine mist of guitar-pop, “Promise” — the new solo single from Jimin, of the K-pop juggernaut BTS — runs in the opposite direction of the familiar BTS maximalism. Here he sounds tender and sweet, and the song never moves quicker than a saunter. In the broader BTS oeuvre, it’s something of an afterthought, casual and unobtrusive. But that hardly matters: It broke the SoundCloud record for most plays in a song’s first 24 hours. CARAMANICA Post Malone’s farewell to 2018 is far more exuberant than anything he released last year. “Wow.” is boastful but not melancholy — “I got a lot of toys/720S bumpin’ Fall Out Boy” — and he’s largely rapping, with only a flimsy skin of melody. After a year in which his album “Beerbongs & Bentleys” helped set the framework for pop’s full-molt evolution, this is a chipper cherry on top, unconcerned with formal innovation and blithely cheerful. CARAMANICA A lurching beat, somewhere in the vicinity of reggae, and a psychedelic-orchestral blur of instruments accompany the high, singsong vocals of Neshma Friend, who records as Micropixie. “How could we ever win the game of life/When all we ever knew was pain and strife/Every day,” she muses. She admits to the hopes that a holiday can raise, then ambles off her own way. PARELES This quartet from New York writes songs spiked with humorous asides, ska guitar and riot grrrl attitude (so it doesn’t sound anything like T. Rex, or the Marc Bolan tribute act from England that shares its name). The group started when its members were still in high school and its second album, “Prehysteria,” delivers more scrawny indie rock with an extra helping of eye roll. Over the Sleater-Kinney-ish backdrop of “Maddy’s Got a Boyfriend,” Lyris Faron nurses a wounded heart: “She leaves me crying in the sand/she said she never liked my band.” CARYN GANZ “I love you baby but my lips are turning blue,” Ursula Rose raps, deadpan, shattering the male self-pity and metronomic electro-pop that Bear Hands concocted for the rest of this track. She’s centered; the guys are a mess. PARELES It has been six years between albums for the Danish songwriter and classical composer Nanna Oland Fabricius, who made her debut album as Oh Land in 2008. “Human Error” merges her early dance-pop electronics with skeletal piano and unfurling orchestral arrangements as she sings about the difference between calculated planning and real life: “No missing digits, no real mistakes/Just human errors make human hearts break,” she realizes. PARELES Steph Richards composes in ways that standard notation could never document. To make “Brooklyn Machine,” she yanked out one of her trumpet’s valves — some air escapes where it ought to be, making the muffled, sometimes warping sound you hear in your right speaker. The tinnier tone coming from the left emerges when Richards covers the valve and air passes through the horn’s bell, like usual. The bell, in turn, is covered with a mute, helping her create the fuzzy mumble at the beginning of the track. “Brooklyn Machine” appears on “Take the Neon Lights,” her forthcoming album, but the performance in the video above — featuring abstracted urban scenes animated by Andrea Yasco — is a separate take, just under a minute and a half of haunting trumpet surgery and jostling play with her piano-bass-drums quartet. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO Paul McCartney, that Paul McCartney, uses Auto-Tune — yes, Auto-Tune — to sing about lost, lifelong love. “It was a time we were all full of hope/Saw the future burning bright,” he sings. “Do you remember?” Now it’s the future.

5c535e493a125f5075c07651,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/arts/music/review-aprile-millo-zankel.html,"Irish folk songs, princess gowns, a harp and 20 bouquets: The soprano Aprile Millo’s concert on Wednesday at Zankel Hall, her first solo program in New York in 10 years, had it all, and then some. Ms. Millo, 60, who has rarely sung in public recently, says she still has her heart set on a return to the Metropolitan Opera, where she was among the reigning Verdi singers of the 1980s and ’90s. So this was something of a trial run, and for the raucously adoring audience it was an exposure to an artist — beloved as a keeper of the old-fashioned flame of Italian opera — that most people at Zankel hadn’t heard live in years. [Can the diva who once ruled the Met make a comeback?] Joshua Barone and Zachary Woolfe, two of our classical music critics, were at the event, presented by New York City Opera, and they compared notes on the unique experience. WOOLFE So this wasn’t your average song program. BARONE I couldn’t tell whether I was at a rock concert or a recital, with the cheers of “Millo, Millo!” and “We love you, Aprile!” It began with a rose thrown to the stage, and I counted no fewer than five standing ovations from her (very vocal) fans throughout the night. What throwback glamour! WOOLFE Throwback glamour, too, in her gowns, which for the first half rendered her an emerald-color, Isolde-type medieval Irish queen and, after intermission, made her a sapphire vision out of “Frozen,” complete with glittery cape. She coughed; she drank from a water bottle; she cracked jokes; she announced that she was cutting the scheduled first-act aria from “Adriana Lecouvreur” because “Anna Netrebko sang it so beautifully I’m going to leave it to her.” And the crowd ate it up. BARONE Her charisma certainly goes far, even if the banter pushed the evening to just over two and a half hours. And it made her all the more endearing that she wore reading glasses to read music from a stand, because, as she said, “Mother’s memory isn’t what it used to be.” But did you notice a disconnect between her ease speaking to the crowd and the palpable tension in the opening numbers, six Italian songs she assembled for a rough narrative about the arc of a relationship? WOOLFE I don’t like speculating about what artists are feeling, but I can imagine that, after so many years away, she was a little nervous, to say the least. So no, I didn’t think that opening set really bloomed vocally. Throughout the evening, actually, her breath wasn’t ample enough to fill out long phrases; her tone in the middle was a little grainy, the low register cloudy. But there was some big, velvety sound in what I’d call the upper-middle range, and wistful eloquence when she went soft. The traditional Irish songs were lovely; I think everyone got the poignancy of “The Kerry Dance,” “gone, like our youth, too soon.” BARONE Those four Irish tunes, delicately accompanied by the pianist Inseon Lee and the harpist Merynda Adams, were the highlight of the night, or at least when her allure as a recitalist was at its peak. Like a cabaret singer, she blended Irish-American family history and song — “The Kerry Dance” was even more moving because Ms. Millo said her mother used to sing it to her at night. In “Danny Boy,” her voice was raspy and not completely at ease in the lower range of the opening verse. But it blossomed, gloriously, into a moment out of Ms. Millo’s salad days, rising from a fine quiet into a lushly phrased climax: “I’ll be here in sunshine or in shadow.” WOOLFE I also thought there was steady passion in a set of Rachmaninoff songs, which she dedicated to the Russian baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky, who died in 2017. She offered another tribute, to old-school italianità, with a spirit-seeing monologue from Licinio Refice’s “Cecilia,” a vehicle for the great soprano Claudia Muzio. BARONE These tributes throughout the night were reminders of Ms. Millo’s former colleagues and another time, when she was the diva du jour at the Met Opera and accumulating the passionate fan base we saw screaming in support of her on Wednesday. The big question, of course, is whether — after being away from the Met for more than a decade — she’ll sing there again. WOOLFE I don’t know if that’s in the cards; the soprano-baritone duet from Act III of “Aida,” while expressive at Zankel, didn’t make me confident that there was an evening-length leading role in her voice, at least not right now. But who cares? She could bring a lot of joy to people doing concerts like this. There is clearly an audience hungry for her charm, her phrasing, her sincerity, the community she’s gathered around her. (Her encore was a singalong “O Sole Mio.”) Those things can sometimes feel missing from the New York opera scene these days, and Wednesday conjured the art form as it’s meant to be: scrappy but also transcendent, both informal and grand. And brava for that. "
5c3709963a125f5075c03af8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/10/movies/female-film-composers.html,"Composers have been hired for two forthcoming blockbusters about warrior women — “Wonder Woman 1984,” directed and co-written by Patty Jenkins, and “Mulan,” directed by Niki Caro from a screenplay by three women. The composers: Hans Zimmer and Harry Gregson-Williams. Both, plainly, dudes. More than just a missed opportunity to lend flinty female heroes a female musical voice, the announcements were simply the latest examples of women being sorely unheard in film music. A 2018 study by the University of Southern California revealed that for the top 100 fictional films at the box office every year from 2007 to 2017, only 16 female composers were hired, compared with more than 1,200 men. Another report, from the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film, showed that of the top 250 films at the domestic box office in 2018, 94 percent were scored by men. “The numbers are bleak, but the landscape isn’t,” said Laura Karpman, a veteran film composer (“Paris Can Wait”) and a governor in the music branch of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. “People are reaching out in a way that I’ve never seen it my whole career.” Karpman was instrumental in expanding the diversity of her branch’s membership, which now includes the Russian composer Sofia Gubaidulina. Karpman also spearheaded the creation of a shortlist in the score category of the Academy Awards. “Had we had a voted-upon shortlist last year, I think we would have more diversity,” she said. Citing the composers behind “Get Out” and “Mudbound,” she added, “I want to see Michael Abels and Tamar-kali on Oscar shortlists.” (Karpman spoke before the shortlist was announced in December. It includes Terence Blanchard’s score for “BlacKkKlansman” — his first Oscar nomination if he moves to the next round — but, alas, no women.) Tamar-kali is one of several new voices in a persistently white male milieu. “Mudbound,” directed by Dee Rees, was the Brooklyn artist’s first score, which she followed with the Netflix drama “Come Sunday.” She’s also reteaming with Rees for an adaptation of the Joan Didion novel “The Last Thing He Wanted.” As an Afro-indigenous woman in the New York punk rock scene, she said, she was already used to being “an outlier within the outliers.” “It just kind of fuels your creativity,” she explained. “The ethos means even more to you, because you’re practicing it every moment — even in the pit, even at shows.” Like a handful of other female artists, Tamar-kali wasn’t pursuing film composition, but was commissioned after a director heard her work. Mica Levi, a British rocker from the band formerly known as Micachu and the Shapes, was nominated for an Oscar for “Jackie,” which followed her shivering, queasy breakout score for “Under the Skin.” The Icelandic cellist-composer Hildur Gudnadottir was hired for “Sicario: Day of the Soldado” and the forthcoming “Joker,” starring Joaquin Phoenix — two patently “macho,” big-budget features — largely because of her experimental electronic solo work. “People approach me looking for a specific type of sound, or feeling,” Gudnadottir said. “They don’t come knocking on my door for, like, a John Williams score. So that also puts me in a really good position, because I’m normally allowed to be myself.” “Joker” bucks the trend of high-profile superhero films going solely to male composers, as does the coming “Captain Marvel,” starring Brie Larson. Pinar Toprak, a Turkish composer who wrote additional music for Danny Elfman on last year’s “Justice League,” is the first woman to score a Marvel film. “Music, and art in general, it’s genderless,” Toprak told me in April, “because emotions are genderless.” One of the few women who scored a major studio film in 2018 was Germaine Franco, with the R-rated bro comedy “Tag.” After assisting the Oscar-nominated John Powell for years, the Mexican-American composer drew attention for giving “Coco” much of its musical personality — she orchestrated Michael Giacchino’s score and wrote several of its songs, although she was not asked to compose the score. She’s currently working on the Tina Gordon Chism comedy, “Little,” starring Marsai Martin of “black-ish.” All of this raises the question of why most studio features — even female-centric no-brainers like the “Ghostbusters” reboot and “Ocean’s 8” — still go to men. The history of women scoring films isn’t long. The pioneer was probably Germaine Tailleferre, a French composer who co-scored a travelogue in 1926. Thirty years later, the American Bebe Barron created the avant-garde electronic sound for “Forbidden Planet” with her husband, Louis. Wendy Carlos’s seminal synthesizer album “Switched-On Bach” led to her collaborations with Stanley Kubrick on “A Clockwork Orange” and “The Shining.” Angela Morley was an Oscar-nominated composer whose credits included the 1978 animated feature “Watership Down” and the TV series “Dynasty” and “Dallas.” Shirley Walker was a pianist who helped Carmine Coppola realize his score for “Apocalypse Now,” and went on to shape scores by Elfman and Zimmer in the 1980s and ’90s as an in-demand orchestrator. Both men, classically untrained, credit her as a teacher. Walker, who died in 2006, also composed her own scores, notably “Batman: The Animated Series,” the “Final Destination” movies and the 2003 horror film “Willard.” Yet she could never break into the top-tier movies she was helping men with. “I don’t think she got in the door for the same meetings that the guys would get,” said Lolita Ritmanis, a composer who was mentored by Walker. “I wouldn’t say she was bitter. She was a fighter till the end.” The first woman to win an Oscar for best score was Rachel Portman, for “Emma” in 1996. (The only other woman to win that prize is Anne Dudley, for “The Full Monty” the next year.) The film industry, Portman said, “tends to be quite cautious.” She added that directors feel more comfortable with composers who have “done something really similar-sounding before — which immediately makes it very difficult to break in. And also this feeling that there’s safety if someone else has hired someone before, which I think is particularly hard for women.” She said she had worked with only two openly misogynistic directors, and noted the occasional “delicious challenge” of a filmmaker presuming she’s not capable of writing “tough music” — that is, for action scenes or anything in a mode not stereotypically feminine. “I’m like, are you kidding? And I’ll just prove to them that I can.” The women interviewed for this article offered a variety of reasons for the longstanding inequality: institutionalized sexism; a lack of precedents and female role models to inspire girls to go into the field; and the social conditioning of women to be selfless caretakers and not seize the spotlight. Increasingly, women are entering the profession, but are still outnumbered by men. The film scoring certificate program at the University of California, Los Angeles has produced 120 graduates since 2013, of which only 25 percent were female. Likewise, only a quarter of applicants to the film scoring graduate program at U.S.C. this year were female — although the school invited seven women to join its 20-student program. (Portman suggested that universities pumping so many aspiring composers into such a small competitive field might itself be a problem.) Several workshops — including the Sundance Institute Film Music Program, which has achieved gender parity the past two years, and the Ascap Film Scoring Workshop — are trying to provide more women with real-world experience and access to the industry. Universal Pictures started its Film Music Composer Initiative to find talented women and people of color. Winning candidates are writing orchestral scores — and running recording sessions at Abbey Road — for shorts created by DreamWorks Animation. Nora Kroll-Rosenbaum scored the program’s first short, “Bird Karma.” She praised the initiative for providing opportunities, adding, “That door has been very much shut for a lot of people.” There are also new resources for support. The Alliance for Women Film Composers was founded in 2014, and now has close to 400 members. It has raised the visibility of women through concerts and advocacy work, and provides solidarity in a lonely profession with no formal union. “It’s a sisterhood, it’s a resource,” said Ritmanis, president of the alliance. “And although we are very much competitors, we are also each others’ cheerleaders.” “I think because of the global awareness of women’s rights, and #MeToo, and Time’s Up and all these different movements,” she added, “there is an interest and a call to action” among studios and decision makers. “People call me wanting to meet and figure out what they can do, and I do think that there’s a lot more opportunity for women to be part of the big audition process” for major feature assignments. As there should be, given their talent, said Doreen Ringer-Ross, an executive in the film music division of Broadcast Music Inc., the performing rights organization which manages the catalogs of many of Hollywood’s top composers. “The job of a composer is to be really sensitive, is to interpret the emotion of things, musically,” she said. “And women are traditionally great at doing that.” Still, emerging composers face a double standard. Jesi Nelson has been apprenticing with several male composers as she develops her own career, and she’s dealt with potential bosses commenting about her legs or musicians assuming that she’s somebody’s personal assistant when she’s actually running a recording session. “I do get angry, and sometimes I’m just like, what’s the point?” Nelson said. “If I’m working these ridiculous hours — seven days a week, 18-hour days — and it’s paying off for somebody to diminish everything that I’ve worked hard for in a few words based on my gender, like, why am I even doing this? But I love it way too much, so I won’t stop.” "
5c59c6a23a125f5075c081d2,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/05/obituaries/jacqueline-steiner-dead.html,"From those first banjo licks, Bostonians know what’s coming: “Let me tell you the story of a man named Charlie. …” As sure as the train is roaring down the tracks, it’s the cautionary tale of Charlie, the Everyman who gets caught up in Boston’s soul-crushing subway system, whence he will never return. Jacqueline Steiner, who died on Jan. 25 at 94, was the lyricist who conjured up poor Charlie early in her singing and songwriting career. She and the song’s co-writer, Bess Lomax Hawes, dashed it off for a Boston mayoral candidate in 1949. They expected it to fade after the election along with their candidate, who received only 1 percent of the vote. But 10 years later, the folk music group the Kingston Trio picked it up. With a slightly new spin, the trio gave it a second life, and their “At Large” album, with the song, “M.T.A.” (also known as “Charlie on the M.T.A.”), as the opening track, hit No. 1 on the charts. “M.T.A.” received an astonishing third life in 2004, when Boston officials did away with subway tokens and issued an automated fare card. They called it the CharlieCard, which is still its name. At the ceremony showing it off, Gov. Mitt Romney heartily joined the Kingston Trio and belted out the song. The original version written by Ms. Steiner and Ms. Hawes and based on the tunes of two old folk songs, had a political edge. They wrote it for a progressive candidate named Walter A. O’Brien, who opposed the latest fare increase. Subway riders would pay a dime to get onto a train, but if they transferred to an aboveground streetcar, they had to pay an extra nickel to exit. (The system was so complex that the M.T.A. issued a 15-page booklet with instructions for both riders and subway operators; the agency ended the system after only a few months.) Charlie, alas, did not have that extra nickel. His absent-minded wife came down to the station every day, but instead of handing him a nickel, “through the open window she hands Charlie a sandwich as the train comes rumblin’ through.” (Ms. Hawes wrote the sandwich verse, which Ms. Steiner always believed gave the song its punch.) Charlie was thus doomed to “ride forever ’neath the streets of Boston / He’s the man who never returned.” After the election, Mr. O’Brien was deemed a Communist and blacklisted. The clean-cut Kingston Trio, trying to advance their careers in the midst of the McCarthy era, generally avoided overtly political songs. They sanitized the Steiner-Hawes version of “M.T.A.” and changed the name Walter O’Brien to the fictitious George O’Brien. The song remains embedded in Boston’s collective unconscious and is something of an unofficial city anthem. It has also served as a metaphor for other horrors, as when a Soviet cosmonaut was stranded in space after the 1991 breakup of the Soviet Union; Fred Small wrote a parody called “Sergei in the Milky Way,” based on the Kingston Trio’s arrangement. Some in Boston find an enduring poetic resonance in Charlie’s plight. Thomas Whalen, a social scientist at Boston University, said that with the fare increase, resentment toward the onerous arm of government and hints of corruption, the song taps into a rich vein of Boston history. “Charlie is caught in that political vortex, as we all are in Boston,” he said in a telephone interview. “It’s this Kafkaesque nightmare — Charlie can’t get off that train.” Jacqueline Steiner was born on Sept. 11, 1924, in Manhattan to Joseph and Jane (Lippert) Steiner. Her father was a clothing retailer, her mother a telephone operator. Her parents divorced when Jackie, as she was known, was a toddler, and two aunts and sometimes her mother raised her, mostly in Greenwich Village. Jackie skipped two grades and arrived at Vassar College at 16. She graduated in 1944 with a bachelor’s degree in philosophy, then headed to Radcliffe to study philosophy but dropped out to pursue a career as a folk singer and songwriter, taking odd jobs to support herself. It was while she was living in Cambridge that she and Ms. Hawes, who died in 2009 at 88, wrote “M.T.A.” Ms. Steiner’s first marriage, to Arnold Berman, ended in divorce after three years. Her second marriage, to Myron Sharpe, ended in divorce in 1980. Her son, Matthew Sharpe, said his mother died from complications of pneumonia in Norwalk, Conn., where she lived. In addition to him, she is survived by her daughter, Susanna Sharpe, and five grandchildren. Ms. Steiner was always politically active, starting early in the peace and civil rights movements. In Norwalk, she served for many years as secretary of the local branch of the N.A.A.C.P. A mezzo-soprano, Ms. Steiner was passionate about singing and playing the guitar. She sang at hootenannies with Pete Seeger and others and studied voice with Max Margulis, a founder of Blue Note Records, who also coached Judy Collins. She also recorded two albums. The first, “No More War,” which she recorded in 1966 as Jacqueline Sharpe, consisted entirely of original antiwar songs. The title track, “No More War,” was based on a 1965 speech by Pope Paul VI at the United Nations. On her second album, “Far Afield: Songs of Three Continents,” released in 1991, she sang her own version of “M.T.A.” as well as songs in multiple languages. As a singer for hire, Ms. Steiner sang solo and in choirs, at churches and synagogues. She even sang for prisoners at Sing Sing. She often hummed around the house, her son said, usually classical music. But at parties, he said, someone would inevitably coax her — “and it didn’t take much coaxing” — to bring out her guitar and sing “M.T.A.” “She wasn’t famous, but the song was famous,” he said. “And it gave her great pleasure to have created something known by so many people, and that had such enduring value.” "
5c4c417d3a125f5075c0674b,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/26/obituaries/michel-legrand-dead.html,"Michel Legrand, the invariably romantic pianist, arranger and composer of hundreds of film scores and songs that have became pop hits and love anthems, died on Saturday. He was 86. His death was confirmed on the artist’s official Facebook page by his management team. Over a career of more than 60 years, Mr. Legrand collaborated onstage, onscreen and in the studio with dozens of celebrated musicians of his era, from Miles Davis to Perry Como, Stéphane Grappelli to Liza Minnelli. A three-time Academy Award winner and five-time Grammy winner — he was nominated for a total of 13 Oscars and 17 Grammys — Mr. Legrand made the love song his métier. Among his better-known compositions are “The Windmills of Your Mind” from “The Thomas Crown Affair” (1968), which won the Oscar for best song; “The Summer Knows,” the theme from “Summer of ’42” (1971) (Mr. Legrand won an Oscar for the movie’s score); and the Oscar-nominated “What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?” from the film “The Happy Ending” (1969). All three were written with the lyricists Alan and Marilyn Bergman. His recording of “Brian’s Song,” his theme from the TV movie of the same name, made the Billboard pop chart in 1972, peaking at No. 56. Other standards of the Legrand canon include “I Will Wait for You” and “Watch What Happens,” both from “The Umbrellas of Cherbourg” (1964), the writer-director Jacques Demy’s musical tale of star-crossed love. (Norman Gimbel wrote the English lyrics.) A pop opera whose entire story was sung, “Umbrellas” first brought Mr. Legrand’s talents to the attention of American moviegoers and earned him a devoted following in the United States. He also scored Mr. Demy’s follow-up, “The Young Girls of Rochefort,” which included spoken dialogue as well as songs and which, like “Umbrellas,” starred the up-and-coming Catherine Deneuve. On the occasion of the 2009 British rerelease of “Rochefort,” Mr. Legrand told Time Out London of meeting Mr. Demy. “I just finished scoring a François Reichenbach movie called ‘America as Seen by a Frenchman,’” he recalled. “Demy loved the score, so we met and he wanted me to score his first movie, which was called ‘Lola.’ So then I scored ‘Lola’ and we became friends and we came to know, appreciate and love each other, and we stayed friends until the very last.” Mr. Demy, who died in 1990, was married to the filmmaker Agnès Varda, with whom Mr. Legrand also worked extensively. He even appeared onscreen, as a pianist, in her 1962 film, “Cleo From 5 to 7.” Among Mr. Legrand’s other notable compositions was “Papa, Can You Hear Me?” from the Barbra Streisand film “Yentl” (1983), also written with the Bergmans. He received three Oscar nominations for his work on that film, and won for its score. In 2018, he composed music for “The Other Side of the Wind,” a lost film by Orson Welles, whose “F for Fake” he had scored in 1973. Although Mr. Legrand composed far less for the theater than he did for film and television, he was nominated for Tony and Drama Desk awards for the show “Amour,” although it ran for only 17 performances on Broadway in 2002. He also wrote the music for “Marguerite,” a musical that had a brief run in London in 2008 whose creative team also included the writers and lyricists of “Les Misérables” and “Miss Saigon.” Mr. Legrand recorded more than 100 albums, with such disparate stars as Maurice Chevalier (for whom he worked as an accompanist early in his career), Kiri Te Kanawa, Sarah Vaughan, Lena Horne and Barbra Streisand. Others who recorded his music ranged from Frank Sinatra to Sting. Mr. Legrand celebrated over 50 years in show business in 2010 with a concert at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas that featured Dionne Warwick, George Benson, Melissa Manchester, Patti Page and Jennifer O’Neill (the star of “Summer of ’42”). He observed his 80th birthday in 2012 by beginning a world tour that included performances in France, Ireland, Japan, Argentina, Brazil, Russia, Denmark and the Netherlands. His schedule last year included performances in London, New York and Tokyo, and he was planning to tour again in 2019. Michel Jean Legrand was born on Feb. 24, 1932, in Bécon-les-Bruyères, a suburb of Paris, to a French father, Raymond Legrand, a composer and actor, and an Armenian mother, the former Marcelle der Mikaelian. From 1942 to 1949, he studied at the Conservatoire de Paris, where his teachers included the celebrated pianist Nadia Boulanger, before becoming an in-demand arranger, working for French stars like Édith Piaf and Yves Montand. In 1947, Mr. Legrand recalled in a 2011 interview, he became interested in jazz when he saw the trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie in concert in Paris (“I was ecstatic”). He would eventually work with Mr. Gillespie and other jazz greats, on albums like “Dizzy Digs Paris” (1953) and, most notably, his own “Legrand Jazz” (1958), for which he arranged well-known jazz compositions for three different groups of established musicians, one of which included Miles Davis, John Coltrane and Bill Evans. Mr. Legrand worked as an arranger with artists in various genres, including the opera singers Natalie Dessay and Anne Sofie von Otter. “While I was studying in Paris I decided that I wanted to touch on and exist within every possible musical discipline,” Mr. Legrand told Time Out London in 2009. “Concerts, records, radio, playing piano, conducting, singing, composing, classical, playing jazz. So when I started to work, it was really on that decision.” Mr. Legrand became an international sensation in 1954 with “I Love Paris,” a collection of well-known French songs, followed by “Holiday in Rome” and “Michel Legrand Plays Cole Porter.” All were hits. He was invited to the Festival of Youth and Students in Moscow in 1958, and aboard the ship from Paris to Moscow he met his future wife, Christine Bouchard, an Yves Saint Laurent model. They had three children. He would eventually marry three times, most recently in 2014 to the actress Macha Méril. Back in Paris, he began composing for film, working notably for New Wave directors like Jean-Luc Godard and later for Mr. Demy, whose “Umbrellas” earned Mr. Legrand his first three Oscar nominations. “The Young Girls of Rochefort” followed, and in 2009 Mr. Legrand was asked if that was a film of which he was particularly proud. “Yes,” he said, “but I must tell you, I’m not ashamed of anything I’ve done. All the films that I’ve done — and I’ve worked on about 250 — are like my children. So they are all special for different reasons. “But I like everything that I’ve done, and why not? I always did it with pleasure, and I did it because I wanted to do it. There is always a reason, and that is important for me.” In 1966 Mr. Legrand moved to Hollywood, where his friends and fellow composers Quincy Jones and Henry Mancini introduced him to the Bergmans. The first of his many collaborations with them was “The Thomas Crown Affair.” On the occasion of a 2010 concert at Olympia Hall in Paris, Mr. Legrand was asked by French radio whether any of his dreams had gone unfulfilled. “Off the top of my head,” he said, “I regret that I didn’t learn more languages, visit certain countries and listen to music that I don’t yet know about. In other words, there’s a whole cultural process that it’s been difficult for me to undertake because I’ve written a lot, worked, traveled, played around. So I haven’t had time to read some of the extraordinary books that I still think about.” “And then,” he added, “I would have liked to work with Judy Garland, who I nurture a mad passion for. But I was born too late. So no regrets.” "
5c520dc13a125f5075c072d3,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/30/arts/music/david-daniels-opera-sexual-assault.html,"The opera singer David Daniels, one of the world’s leading countertenors, was arrested on Tuesday on a sexual assault charge stemming from a 2010 incident in Houston. Mr. Daniels and his husband, Scott Walters, were arrested Tuesday afternoon in Michigan, where they live, on warrants issued by the Houston Police Department, said Detective Lt. Aimee Metzer of the Ann Arbor Police Department. The two men, who were being held in the Washtenaw County Jail in Michigan on Wednesday while awaiting a hearing on bail and extradition, denied the accusations. Mr. Daniels rose to fame as a countertenor, singing high parts that were once the province of castratos or mezzo-sopranos at the Metropolitan Opera and around the world. When he and Mr. Walters were married in 2014, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, an avid opera fan, officiated. Now, with his arrest, Mr. Daniels becomes the most prominent classical music star to face criminal charges of sexual misconduct in the wake of the national #MeToo reckoning. Mr. Daniels and Mr. Walters were each charged with sexual assault in connection to a 2010 incident in which a singer said he was drugged and assaulted by the couple, according to charging documents filed by the Harris County District Attorney’s Office in Texas. The singer, Samuel Schultz, said in an interview in August that the two men assaulted him in May 2010, when, as a graduate student at Rice University in Houston, he had gone to hear Mr. Daniels in Handel’s “Xerxes” at Houston Grand Opera. After attending the performance and cast party, Mr. Schultz said, he was invited to Mr. Daniels and Mr. Walters’s apartment. There, he said, he was given a drink that caused him to lose consciousness. He awoke alone, he said, naked and bleeding from his rectum. A lawyer for Mr. Daniels and Mr. Walters denied the accusations. “David and Scott are innocent of any wrongdoing,” their lawyer, Matt Hennessy, said in a statement. “Sam Schultz is not a victim. He never would have gotten this much attention from his singing, and he knows and resents that fact. He waited eight years to complain about adult, consensual sex to ride the #MeToo movement to unearned celebrity. We will fight this.” Mr. Schultz said in an email that he had been told about the arrests by the Houston police, but he declined further comment. Mr. Schultz said over the summer that he had initially been afraid that making the accusations would damage his fledgling career. But he went public last summer — first anonymously, in an online post, and then naming Mr. Daniels and Mr. Walters as his attackers in an interview with The New York Daily News. A Houston police officer, D.H. Escobar, wrote in the charging documents that he had found Mr. Schultz, who was identified in the report only by his initials, to be “credible and reliable.” The officer said that he had met with a therapist Mr. Schultz consulted in 2010, and that her notes were consistent with what Mr. Schultz had told the police. The officer said that he had also reviewed medical records which showed that Mr. Schultz had sought medical attention “as a result of the sexual assault” on June 1, 2010. The charging documents state that the Houston police officer had reviewed a report by the University of Michigan Police Department, which had also investigated the incident over the summer. According to that report, Mr. Daniels had told university police that he had invited Mr. Schultz back to his apartment for a nightcap, where “things became sexual.” Mr. Walters told the university police that Mr. Schultz had taken an Ambien after seeing Mr. Walters and Mr. Daniels take them, according the report, adding that he then grew “woozy.” And Mr. Daniels told the police that, two days after that encounter, Mr. Schultz had “freaked out” and contacted him and Mr. Walters, telling them “you know what you did” before blocking further contact with them, the report said. Mr. Daniels has been a voice professor in recent years at the University of Michigan. A student paper, The Michigan Daily, reported that the school granted Mr. Daniels tenure in May, despite the fact that it had received an anonymous complaint of sexual misconduct two months earlier. Another student, Andrew Lipian, sued the school and Mr. Daniels in October, accusing Mr. Daniels of sexual misconduct; Mr. Daniels filed a countersuit. Kim Broekhuizen, a spokeswoman for the university, said in an email that Mr. Daniels had been on leave since August. “We will continue to closely monitor the situation as we determine the appropriate next steps,” she said.

5c7cf77b49f0eacbf105b323,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/04/well/family/using-arts-education-to-help-other-lessons-stick.html,"In “A Tree Grows in Brooklyn,” Betty Smith’s 1943 autobiographical novel about growing up poor in the early 20th century, the public school that the heroine attends is a pretty bleak place. But “there was a great golden glory lasting a half-hour each week when Mr. Morton came to Francie’s room to teach music.” He taught them classical music, the book continues, without telling them what they were learning, setting his own words to the great works. “Little boys whistled part of Dvorak’s New World Symphony as they played marbles. When asked the name of the song, they’d reply ‘Oh, “Going Home.”’ They played potsy, humming ‘The Soldiers’ Chorus’ from Faust, which they called ‘Glory.’” Francie also looked forward to the visits of the drawing teacher; “these two visiting teachers were the gold and silver sun-splash in the great muddy river of school days.” Arts education in schools has introduced many children to great painters and great music, and helped them through their first dance steps or tentative musical endeavors. It can serve as a bright spot in the schoolchild’s day or week, a class that brings in beauty, color and joy, and which is not about testing. These subjects are often under threat either from budget cuts or from the inexorable demands of academic testing and “accountability,” but insights from neuroscience suggest that arts education can play additional important roles in how children learn. Paul T. Sowden, a professor of psychology at the University of Winchester in England, warned that in Britain, as in the United States, arts and humanities subjects have suffered in recent years as the emphasis shifted to science and technology. It's important, he said, that arts education be available equally to everyone. But arts education, he said, is a chance to build resilience and determination in children, as well as to help them master complex skills. Arts education encompasses many disciplines: “I’m talking about everything from music, drama, dance, design, visual arts,” Dr. Sowden said. And the goal goes beyond the specific subjects, he said: “You’re looking for opportunities in the arts education context to encourage children to ask questions, to use their imaginations, but also to approach their work in a systematic, disciplined way.” When children are younger, arts education helps develop their capacity for collaboration, for creativity, and even for asking questions. As they get older, he said, “their executive function is much more developed, their ability to sustain attentional tasks is much greater.” For them, arts education can offer the chance to refine and polish a skill over time, or revise a project until it is as good as it can be. Sometimes the arts are taught in a very set curriculum, Dr. Sowden said, but there are real advantages to teaching in a more exploratory way, where children can experiment. And both parents and teachers can encourage children to explore, he said; “that’s the way you get the biggest benefit, not just learning to reproduce a particular work by Monet or dance sequence.” The skills that children master in arts education, he said, may be transferable to other curricular areas. Mariale Hardiman, a professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Education, where she directs the neuro-education initiative, was interested in how children do — and don’t — retain what they learn in school. “A lot of the information we teach doesn’t stick.” What she saw as a school principal, she said, was that when arts were integrated into the curriculum, “learning became more visible.” Teachers told her “the children would remember the information better when they taught it through the arts.” So though arts education has many other benefits, she said, such as creative thinking, her studies have focused on children’s memory for academic subjects, comparing what children remembered 10 weeks after material was taught. Researchers wrote two different versions of the curriculum, matched for content and timing, both involving active learning, but one including arts education. For example, in an arts integrated curriculum, students would sketch their vocabulary words, or learn some of the material as songs, or act out molecular motion with their bodies. The children who had learned the material in the curriculum that made use of the arts remembered more, and the effect was largest among the children who were less strong academically, the “lower performers.”  “We found the biggest difference with children at the lower level of achievement,” Dr. Hardiman said. “Could this be at least one lever for closing an achievement gap?” After all, these are often the students who are condemned to dreary drill and repetition, in hopes of bringing them to a higher level: “What if the arts are a lever of school reform, better than the drill and kill we do with remedial students?” In a 2019 article in the journal Trends in Neuroscience and Education, Dr. Hardiman and her colleagues described the results of a randomized controlled trial looking at fifth-graders who were taught science content, some using techniques from arts education, and others with more conventional instruction. The researchers again saw an effect on the students with more limited reading skills; they remembered more science if they had learned with the integrated arts methods. So why might the arts integration help children’s memory? “Arts allow for elaboration, allow for repetition,” Dr. Hardiman said. “Memory is certainly enhanced through repetition, the more you revisit something, the more you remember it.” And the visual and performing arts also allow children to elaborate in creative ways on the material. The advantage of learning through the arts will come as no surprise to anyone who grew up with the “Fifty Nifty United States” song or learned how a bill becomes a law from Schoolhouse Rock. Some of today’s children are learning history from the lyrics of “Hamilton.”  I suddenly remembered a rather mournful tune from decades ago, in high school, when a science teacher told us we would be tested on the elements with a charge of positive 2 and a friend and I set them to a chant; I can still name them, in order, and when it comes to chemistry, I am definitely one of the less able students. “Arts integration should not replace arts education,” Dr. Hardiman said. She suggested a “three-legged stool,” with one leg being arts education, including dedicated classes in visual and performing arts, and the second arts and cultural offerings, such as artists coming into the school or visits to museums. The third leg would be the integration of the arts into the teaching of other subjects. “Parents can easily do simple arts activities with kids,” Dr. Hardiman said, and can incorporate these ideas around homework or just in spending time together. Maybe it would help to put the multiplication tables into a song, or ask children to sketch their ideas, or use body poses to show the emotion that a character in a story is feeling. Ronald Beghetto, a professor of educational psychology and the director of Innovation House at the University of Connecticut, studies creativity in educational settings, which, he said, “can be manifest across all different disciplines.” “We tend, as adults, to overplan and overstructure young people’s experiences,” Dr. Beghetto said. While structure is important, he said, so is “letting kids determine their own problems to solve, their own ways to solve them.”  Arts education, he said, can provide those structured opportunities that foster creativity.  “Working through some creative endeavor, we’re really resolving uncertainty,” he said. “We approach the blank canvas.” "
5c2d2d623a125f5075c0295a,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/02/movies/bohemian-rhapsody-a-star-is-born.html,"I was waiting for a subway last month in Mexico City when I figured out what’s wrong with the Queen movie. I mean, I knew what was wrong. “Bohemian Rhapsody” is scared of tapping into the imagination that made the band so innovative and powerfully, addictively strange. But that’s not what hit me waiting for the subway. The platform entertainment system was playing a concert video of “Another One Bites the Dust.” I don’t know what year the clip was from or what city Queen was in. I just know that the lighting is warm, the groove is skintight (you could feel it on the platform), and that Freddie Mercury is wearing — is packed into — white short-shorts and almost nothing else. No shoes, no shirt yet all service. The towel he’s whipping around gets an almost immediate, theatrical toss into the crowd. The red wristband and red bandanna tied round his neck bring out the red in his Montreal Canadiens trucker’s cap. Mercury does all his Mercurial moves — the side gallop, the chug-a-lug, the duck strut, the steed swipe, the rewind, the vroom-vroom, the Wimbledon Final frozen pirouette, the one where he kind of dries his tushy with the microphone stand in a full march. And he does them while belting out this uppercut of a song (with some shockingly forceful assistance from the drummer Roger Taylor). Commuters, tourists, kids: we looked up at this thing, mesmerized, in jeopardy of missing a train. That’s right about when I figured out what was wrong with the Queen movie: There’s nothing in it remotely like this. “Bohemian Rhapsody” plods, explains, obscures, speculates and flattens. It does not mesmerize. I mean, I wouldn’t miss a train for this. We learn how “We Will Rock You” allegedly sprang from a fit of personal protestation. But it’s news we can’t use. The movie won’t stop telling us things — about the music business and the songs, about Mercury’s tortured sex life. And it fails to show you anything close to what that clip on the subway platforms makes you feel: sweaty. The musical biography has an impossibly high degree of alchemical difficulty. One performer has to become a totally different performer, and not any performer, just this one star the whole world knows, and it has to be done in a way that makes you believe you’re seeing either the impersonated star or something quintessential about them. Val Kilmer made you believe you were seeing something vitally true about Jim Morrison. Joaquin Phoenix did the same with Johnny Cash. And Jamie Foxx became Ray Charles. Angela Bassett convinced you that if you were seeing if not Tina Turner, then Turner’s indestructibility; and Marion Cotillard, the brittle incandescence of Edith Piaf. For my money, one of the triumphs of this type of acting is Chadwick Boseman’s James Brown in “Get On Up.” Boseman pumps Brown full of edginess and spite while having to reconstruct Brown as a stage specimen, and part of that reconstruction involves learning to lip sync to Brown. You sense that you’re watching an actor who’s done more than homework. He’s written himself a little dissertation. It’s not an impression of Brown. It’s an interpolation. Some movies pivot and omit the musical performance altogether. That’s the approach Todd Haynes applied to Bob Dylan in “I’m Not There” and John Ridley took in having Andre 3000 play Jimi Hendrix in “Jimi: All Is by My Side.” But the alchemy is a reason to dislike the genre. It’s hard to get the proportions right. It takes some work in, say, “Cadillac Records” to figure out where Beyoncé ends and Etta James is supposed to begin. Rami Malek has a different challenge in “Bohemian Rhapsody.” He’s not a superstar playing another superstar. He just has to become the superstar Freddie Mercury was. Just. And yet because the movie is mostly scenes of recording sessions, squabbling and self-pity, Mercury’s stardom is made beside the point — it’s assumed — so Malek gets to play a charismatic sufferer, -quipster and, eventually, proud brown gay man. It’s just that this version of Mercury isn’t terribly exciting without the reward of seeing him vroom-vroom in short-shorts. The movie rides the roller coaster of biographical cliché. What’s missing are musical numbers that showcase his showmanship and eternal capacity for self-delight. This means more time watching Malek struggle with dental effects meant to bring his mouth into more realistic alignment with Mercury’s. Maybe Malek has done the best anyone could with the teeth. But they wind up bringing something vampiric out of Mercury that I don’t know was ever there. Either way, the alchemy is off.  WE’RE IN A HAPPY MOMENT for musical-movie excitement. “Mary Poppins” has returned with new songs. And despite that lie of a title, “The Greatest Showman” is the most impressive phenomenon nobody saw coming or took seriously once it came. “Bohemian Rhapsody” is now the musical biopic’s biggest hit. We can have the argument later about the difference between a classical movie musical and a movie where people get on stage and do music, but you could also add to the mix this latest incarnation of “A Star Is Born,” which was a smash too. It’s the story of how a waitress became a Grammy winner. And because the tale is essentially a fantasy — of love, fame and ruin; biography as mythology — its casting is the inverse of the rock bio. A musician does the acting. In Bradley Cooper’s version, the musician is Lady Gaga. She starts off as Ally the restaurant grunt. But when Cooper’s beloved alt-country pill guzzler sees her belt “La Vie en Rose” in a drag parlor, he hauls her into stardom, which Gaga knows well. But the surprise of her acting comes in the first hour when the movie is closer to earth and requires her to be more like you and me — daughter, employee, listener. There’s a lovely hesitance to her here, not in the camera-shy way singers tend to get when it’s time to act. Reluctance is a performance strategy for her in this movie. Again, she’s like you and me, she can’t believe Bradley Cooper’s happening to her, either. Some of what’s great about the first hour is how it gets you thinking about the kind of career Gaga could have in movies they haven’t made in, like, 30 years. The scenes at home with Ally, her chauffeur father and his fellow drivers are loud, funny and warm in a way that reminded me of “Moonstruck.” And some of the pleasure I had watching Gaga in them is how she reminded me of another singer who acts: Cher. A friend points out that she could have Cher’s career if the movies were still interested in normal people. I, at least, would love to see Gaga in a “Mask” or a “Suspect.” She and Malek are both near the top of the heap for Oscar nominations. And she’s got an alchemical advantage over Malek’s Freddie Mercury. When Ally’s career takes off, Gaga winds up playing a pop star not unlike herself. And you realize she has the opposite problem that Malek does. You’re less interested in her as a singer — but only because we’ve seen her do huge, stadium-size razzle-dazzle before. And yet she’s indifferent to playing the fame stuff. It doesn’t seem to interest Ally or Gaga. If the movie loses Ally a bit in the second half, Gaga never appears lost. She’s giving a serious, considered, committed performance of a person she seems to know. Malek’s commitment is to a movie committed in the wrong proportions. It doesn’t know who it wants Freddie Mercury to be. “Bohemian Rhapsody” doesn’t fixate on the showmanship until the finale, which restages their electric, legendary Live-Aid performance at Wembly Stadium and passes for showstopping. Yet you exit hungry for a movie that gets closer to the bottom of a man who renamed himself after both an element and a planet. If someone dares take another crack (and someone really should), I know the perfect Freddie. Her first name is Lady. And her last name comes straight from a Queen song. "
5c6c1e1b3a125f5075c0a6a2,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/19/realestate/she-loves-her-stuff-he-has-little-and-cares-less.html,"The actor Will Chase and the singer and composer Ingrid Michaelson were introduced years ago at a red-carpet charity event.  “I don’t remember meeting him,” said Ms. Michaelson, 39, all cheery candor. “I remember meeting her,” said Mr. Chase, 48, who plays an egotistic trouper/impresario (nothing like his own gallant self, of course) in the Broadway revival of “Kiss Me Kate,” now in previews, and who set hearts aflutter as the country-singing superstar Luke Wheeler on the series “Nashville.” His TV credits also include “Smash,” “Sharp Objects” and “Stranger Things.” It’s safe to say that the story of their courtship wouldn’t spark a bidding war for the film rights.  “We went on a date,” said Ms. Michaelson, who has released eight studio albums and made her film-acting debut in the 2017 comedy “Humor Me.” “We liked each other, and that was that. He started out as a fan of my music, and I was a fan, too, because I loved ‘Nashville.’ We came to each other with mutual respect.” She continued: “Not to be morose, but my mother passed away, I got a divorce and my life kind of fell apart. And then I began seeing Will, and right off the bat it was good.” Living together has been similarly fine. “Wunderbar,” you might say, to quote one of Mr. Chase’s numbers from “Kiss Me Kate.”  Soon after getting together in 2015, the couple moved into a three-floor spread in a rental building in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn. And perhaps as a nod to Ms. Michaelson’s obsession with the Yuletide season — don’t get her going on her musical Christmas clock, a gift from Hallmark — they quickly planted a dozen evergreens on one of the apartment’s two terraces. Ms. Michaelson’s brother, Charlie, and his wife and toddler daughter are right upstairs, in the building’s only other unit. “Ingrid and her brother are very tight, and we get to see them every day, which is a plus of being here,” Mr. Chase said. “And we’re the insta-babysitters.” Keeping to the all-in-the-family theme, one of Mr. Chase’s daughters from his first marriage has lately been in residence as well, on a gap year before starting college. Occupations: He’s an actor; she’s a pop composer and singer who did a stint on Broadway as a replacement in “Natasha, Pierre & the Great Comet of 1812.” Getting away from it all: “I know a lot of theater people say this, but I like living tucked away from the theater district,” Mr. Chase said. “It’s very familial in Brooklyn. I like to be here and veg.” Ms. Michaelson has taken the lead in outfitting the apartment. This is partly because she is hip, Mr. Chase said, and knows that a certain object “will look great in the place by the thing, which I just can’t visualize.”  And it is partly because she had many pieces to contribute, several from the Victorian house in Nyack, N.Y., that she owned with her former husband: bedside lamps, side tables, chests, a mirror and a dining table that she adored but worried might be too big for the space.  “We just measured it,” she said. “It’s 82 inches and I’m like, ‘Should we get a smaller table?’ But I do love it.” But really, it comes down to this: Ms. Michaelson has her stuff, and she loves her stuff. Mr. Chase is not a material guy. He accumulates little and cares less, although he is very tender on the subject of the vinyl classical records he inherited from Ms. Michaelson’s father. “I’m like, ‘Don’t you want to keep that chair or whatever from your family?’ And he’s like, ‘Not really.’ Will’s very easygoing. I admire that he doesn’t get sentimental about too many objects,” Ms. Michaelson said. “I, on the other hand, hold on to things,” she added, pointing to the chest from her family’s Staten Island house that held her childhood arts and crafts supplies, and to two spindle-backed antique chairs, the sole survivors of a set that belonged to her grandmother. When Ms. Michaelson does let something go, she tries very hard to avoid regret. This is not always possible. It was absolutely not possible in the case of the antique egg incubator she bought at the Brooklyn shop Sterling Place.  “It was my first big furniture purchase, and it cost $500,” she said. “I used it as a side table, but it was really too big for a side table and too small for anything else. So I ended up selling it.” She added: “I still think about it.” “Note to self: Christmas present,” her boyfriend said. Whatever his indifference to how his space is filled, Mr. Chase would prefer that the space be big. Never mind that more often than not he and Ms. Michaelson can be found nestled on the very puffy sectional in a corner of the living room watching “Game of Thrones.”  He likes room to roam. He’s got it. The living room — heavy on the wood and earth tones, and heavily dependent on Restoration Hardware and West Elm — is cozy and welcoming, but betrays nothing about the professional lives of the inhabitants. All is revealed in the studio/office where, surrounded by family photos and theater posters and caricatures, Mr. Chase memorizes his lines and Ms. Michaelson writes. (She is working on the score for a musical adaptation of “The Notebook.”) “It’s kind of our accomplishments in here, mixed with bizarre things,” she said.  Bizarre: the lion’s head she bought at a rest stop while on tour. Bizarre (but sweet): the Grimace sponge she bought for Mr. Chase on eBay.  The accomplishments include Mr. Chase’s Tony Award nomination certificate (for his performance in the 2012 revival of “The Mystery of Edwin Drood”) and Ms. Michaelson’s two platinum singles (for 2007’s “The Way I Am” and 2014’s “Girls Chase Boys”). “But it’s not ‘Look at us.’ It’s not, like, showcasing us,” Mr. Chase insisted. “And then we joke, ‘It’s not like we have that many awards.’” For weekly email updates on residential real estate news, sign up here.

5c65d5423a125f5075c09c69,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/arts/children-culture-winter-activities.html,"Film Forum and Alamo Drafthouse Long before I had children who required a cultural education, I had planned out a film history curriculum. I thought we might begin, my hypothetical children and I, with silent short subjects, maybe Georges Méliès’s “A Trip to the Moon,” and work our way chronologically through cinema history. After a couple of years, we’d move on to talkies, lingering on Max Fleischer cartoons and Laurel and Hardy’s comic two-reelers, arriving at Technicolor just in time for my student-offspring to see “The Wizard of Oz” around age 7 or 8. When my actual children arrived, this plan worked not quite as well as you’d think. The students had been equipped with touch screens, and they had their own syllabus in mind. But we have managed to strike a balance between What I Want My Kids to Like and What They Actually Like, largely with the help of the programmers in charge of series like Film Forum Jr., which offers lovingly curated fare from throughout movie history. Being part of a theatrical audience rather than just lounging on the couch helps kids (and their parents) appreciate these works — albeit with some occasional fidgeting. (This weekend is the 1956 “Carousel”; next weekend is the George Pal-produced “The War of the Worlds.”) At the other end of the spectrum are many of the films that run as part of the Alamo Drafthouse Kids Camp program. Alamo may be as well-known for its strictness — disruptive patrons are ejected without a refund — as for its comforts, like reclining chairs, small tables and waiter service. But Kids Camp offers a far more relaxed atmosphere. (This weekend’s shows include a mix of PBS children’s programs; next week brings matinee screenings of “The Muppets Take Manhattan.”) Other kid- and cinephile-friendly screenings across the city include the Metrograph’s Playtime: Family Matinees and the Nitehawk Cinema’s Lil’ Hawk Friendly series. Students and teachers should check their listings in advance to see what’s on the syllabus. DANIEL McDERMON Ongoing series at various times; filmforum.org and drafthouse.com/family. Brooklyn Academy of Music Are there parents out there who don’t feel guilty and confused when it comes to children and screens? Do we teach them to code while they’re still in training pants or do we keep them from anything flat, shiny and pixelated until they’re 18? Now in its third year, this Brooklyn Academy of Music festival with a dual focus on technology and creativity suggests a digital middle way, screens as a place for discovery and play. Taking over the BAM Fisher building in Downtown Brooklyn, Teknopolis noodles around with motion- and touch-based technologies. (Time-based tickets dictate a 90-minute visit, so be prepared to move and touch fast.) The first two floors, designed for children 6 and up, use a mix of digital and analog machinery, inviting participants to manipulate music, text, ink drawings and photographs. The installation “Más Que la Cara,” by the Brooklyn-based innovators Zach Lieberman and Molmol Kuo, creates a living mask of your child’s face, allowing augmented facial expressions, like an emoji come to life — fun, or creepy? In “Body Sketches,” participants can hand-draw patterns that are repurposed to create virtual costumes. (The best part about virtual costumes: minimal laundering.) In the balcony, TMEMA’s “Manual Input Sessions” let participants use hand gestures, even naughty ones, to create an augmented shadow play. Older kids and adults who think that goggles are a good look can opt to include a virtual-reality experience. “VR-1,” by the Next Wave Festival artist Gilles Jobin, is an immersive dance piece that allows a helmeted you to jump into the body of a hopefully flexible avatar and virtually dance alongside other participants, like a next-level silent disco. “Play Room” allows musicians with a sci-fi streak to invent weird instruments. (Weirder than the fluba?) There’s also “L U N E,” which allows users to build a virtual pillow fort. How is this better than a real pillow fort? This one is made of stars. The BAM Fisher Rooftop hosts several 360° films. One, “Crow: The Legend,” has Oprah Winfrey in her V.R. debut. Another, “Man on Spire,” a collaboration with The New York Times and Koncept VR, follows the professional climber Jimmy Chin up the spine of 1 World Trade Center. The Times also created “A Classic Circus Folds Its Tent,” a tribute to the final Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey show. There’s an augmented-reality arcade where ticket holders can try out various apps, like Flarmingos, which adds boxy, pinkalicious flamingos to everyday surroundings, a reality augmentation I would happily support. Also helpful: There’s a Whole Foods 365 a few blocks away, as most children will still prefer their postfestival snacks nonvirtual. ALEXIS SOLOSKI Feb. 23-March 10 at BAM Fisher, 321 Ashland Place, Brooklyn; bam.org. Various Locations A Kenyan girl obsessed with superheroes. South American children trying to save their Indigenous culture. Young people questioning their gender identities. As the movie industry continues to be criticized for a lack of diversity, the selections of the New York International Children’s Film Festival stand out as surprising exceptions. A cinematic celebration for kids that is about as far away from a kiddie event as you can imagine, it arrives next weekend with 15 features, 75 short films, two virtual-reality experiences, an animators’ panel, discussions with directors and a determination to show the world in all its fascinating multiplicity. “We can’t ever underestimate the importance of kids seeing people that look like them — onscreen and as filmmakers,” said Maria-Christina Villaseñor, the festival’s programming director. Showing films for ages 3 through 18 at seven sites over four weekends, the festival will open Friday, Feb. 22, with “The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind,” the first film written and directed by Chiwetel Ejiofor, the Oscar-nominated star of “12 Years a Slave.” The movie, from Malawi and Britain, relates the true story of a 13-year-old who devised a windmill for his famine-plagued village. (Ejiofor plays his father.) The festival will also offer the Kenyan and German project “Supa Modo” and interviews with its director, Likarion Wainaina. This fictional film features a 9-year-old Kenyan girl whose terminal illness does not quash her desire to fight and fly like a superhero. Both films raise sobering issues, and Ejiofor did not even conceive of his debut picture as a children’s film. But the festival does not focus so much on work made for the young as on work that will engage them. Even the animation sometimes embraces serious themes. In Juan Antin’s “Pachamama,” set centuries ago in the Andes, a boy and a girl struggle to recover a stolen icon. (Antin will also take part in an audience talkback.) And Kitaro Kosaka’s ghost story, “Okko’s Inn,” chronicles the life of a recently orphaned girl who copes with grief through hard work.  Featuring strong female protagonists is a priority for the festival, in which about half the filmmakers this year are women. They include Linda Hamback of Sweden, whose animated “Gordon & Paddy” has a female rodent detective, and Joya Thome of Germany, who will appear at the festival and whose “Queen of Niendorf” presents a girl who defines courage differently than her male peers do. This year’s festival also spotlights films from the Netherlands; Steven Wouterlood will discuss his feature “My Extraordinary Summer With Tess,” an exploration of family and friendship. The festival’s short films, which are judged by an adult jury (winners become eligible for Oscars), also examine sex stereotyping. A shorts program about re-evaluating masculinity, “Boys Beyond Boundaries,” which was new last year, has returned with films like Christina Willings’s Canadian documentary “Beauty,” featuring five children whose self-definitions don’t match their birth certificates. “There’s a real demand for sophisticated media for kids,” said Nina Guralnick, the festival’s executive director. “Now more than ever.” LAUREL GRAEBER Feb. 22-March 17 at various locations; nyicff.org. New York Philharmonic Of course the New York Philharmonic’s mascot is a penguin. What other animal comes to mind when you look at a symphony orchestra in full concert dress? You won’t find that kind of attire here, though — not at the Very Young People’s Concerts, which are also Very Informal, and Very Friendly. Which is where Philippe the Penguin comes in. Some New York parents — the kind who get their preschool application in before the third trimester of pregnancy — are already snapping up their subscriptions to the next season of the Philharmonic’s children’s programs. But for anyone keen to dip just one experimental toe into the classical waters, the coming week is a good time to see Tchaikovsky and Beethoven broken down into spoonable chunks. In a first step, the Philharmonic breaks down the target audience itself. Its Very Young People’s Concerts at Merkin Hall are specifically for 3- to 6-year-olds. These interactive events are based on the understanding that, at this age, a child craves nothing more than to be in control, which is why little audience members get to mess with the music almost from the moment they enter the building. A quartet performing in the lobby might let kids determine their tempo or volume. (Be prepared for demands that a stroller be pushed a little more allegro on the way home.) Other stations let children get their hands on real instruments, or ask nosy questions of a harpist armed with angelic patience. The actual performance on this occasion, Feb. 24 and 25, features selections from Tchaikovsky’s “Swan Lake,” with storytelling and video — and the ever-relatable Philippe the Penguin — keeping little minds focused. The following weekend’s program targets children ages 6 to 12 with a Young People’s Concert on March 2 titled “Level Up — Beethoven, Andrew Norman and Video Games.” Here, too, there is an interactive component before the performance proper that allows visitors to think like composers and come up with a musical bridge between existing passage of music. But the focus of the performance in David Geffen Hall is a more rigorous introduction to the notion of development in music. Using the iconic opening movement of Beethoven’s Fifth as a case study, development here is related in terms of the choices and story lines opening up inside a video game. The brilliant, boyish composer Andrew Norman talks about Beethoven and his own award-winning “Play,” part of which will be performed by the Philharmonic. A work by a Very Young Composer, Kyler Simon, is also part of the concert. Its title? “The Great Adventure.” CORINNA da FONSECA-WOLLHEIM Feb. 24-25 at Merkin Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, and March 2 at David Geffen Hall, Lincoln Center, at Broadway and West 65th Street, Manhattan; 212-875-5656, nyphil.org. “Adventure Time” (streaming on Hulu).

The 28-year-old pianist, who was competing against four other finalists, will receive $50,000, a recording contract with Mack Avenue Records, and two years of professional services. The competition’s closing event took place on Saturday at the Hilbert Circle Theater in Indianapolis, capping a 14-month process in which each finalist also had an engagement at an Indianapolis jazz club and participated in an outreach program at a local high school. With his win, Mr. Cohen joins a lineup of nine past awardees that includes Sullivan Fortner, Aaron Parks, Dan Tepfer and Aaron Diehl — who have all attained significant renown since winning. The American Pianists Association holds a competition for young musicians every two years, but it alternates between jazz and classical. Mr. Cohen was a finalist the last time it focused on jazz pianists, in 2015, but he lost to Mr. Fortner. “It’s a great honor,” Mr. Cohen said in an interview on Sunday. “I feel super excited about signing with Mack Avenue. I think my particular musical vision aligns with a lot of the artists,” he added, alluding to the label’s roster of straight-ahead, acoustic jazz musicians. Mr. Cohen has already appeared as a side musician on two Mack Avenue releases, both by the drummer Herlin Riley. He has also made five albums as a bandleader on other labels, including one on which he’s joined by the bass luminary Ron Carter. The conclusion of the 2019 contest stretched across two nights. On Friday, finalists performed two 15-minute sets each at the Jazz Kitchen nightclub, accompanied by a house rhythm section. On Saturday, at the Hilbert, the pianists performed in duet with the famed vocalist Kurt Elling, then with the Buselli-Wallarab Jazz Orchestra. Mr. Cohen and Mr. Elling performed “I Keep Going Back to Joe’s,” a ballad best known from Nat King Cole’s rendition; with the big band, Mr. Cohen played a medley of tunes composed by Fats Waller. "
5ca60e4249f0eacbf1f80e24,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/04/theater/titus-andronicus.html,"A Shakespeare play is a dangerous place. Swords can kill you. So can poison, grief and bears. Eleven corpses crowd the stage in “Richard III.” “King Lear” does away with 10 characters. But at 14 deaths, “Titus Andronicus” — with its beheadings, live burial and disgustful approach to pastry-making — takes the Shakespearean cake. T.S. Eliot called “Titus Andronicus” “one of the stupidest and most uninspired plays ever written.” That doesn’t mean it hasn’t inspired others. The image of a mother made to eat her children was hard to shake, and a couple of decades after its 1594 premiere, artists had already begun to appropriate — O.K., fine, cannibalize — its plot for uses comic, tragic and savagely satirical. Directors have staged it with almost no gore and with nothing but gore. It has been modernized, musicalized, performed by puppets and adapted to Kabuki. Stephen K. Bannon sent it into space. Its blood has spattered everything from bootleg Dutch tragedies to Japanese anime to “Game of Thrones.” “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt” gifted us the character Titus Andromedon, played by Tituss Burgess. (His rival: Coriolanus Burt.) Now comes Taylor Mac’s “Gary: A Sequel to Titus Andronicus,” which picks up, figuratively and literally, after the final murders. It opens on April 21 at Broadway’s Booth Theater. But before audiences tally whether Mac outdoes Shakespeare on the body count, let’s look back at some of the play’s more memorable appearances in culture, pop and otherwise. In the mid 19th century, the African-American actor Ira Aldridge and the English playwright C.A. Somerset collaborated on a new version that transformed Aaron, a Moor and the lover of the barbarian queen Tamora, from villain to hero, subverting racial stereotype. Aldridge and Somerset cut out most of the carnage and interpolated at least one scene from a contemporary melodrama that Aldridge had also starred in. Aldridge’s opinion: “I will venture to say that there is not a play on the stage with a more powerful climax.” A Scottish critic praised Aldridge’s performance as Aaron as “remarkable for energy, tempered by dignity and discretion.” A British horror comedy beloved of theater reviewers and the people who hate them. “Theater of Blood” stars Vincent Price as Edward Kendal Sheridan Lionheart, a depraved classical actor, bad in every sense. After faking his death Lionheart revenges himself on his critics, with murders inspired by Shakespeare. After executing six critics and convincing a seventh to kill his wife Othello-style, Lionheart turns to “Titus Andronicus” to snuff the eighth. Meredith Merridew (Robert Morley), who refers to his poodles as babies, is invited onto a cooking show and served a pie. No prizes for guessing the filling. Lionheart suffocates him with the crust. Stephen Sondheim’s Tony-winning chiller, written with Hugh Wheeler, doesn’t directly descend from Shakespeare. An adaptation of Christopher Bond’s 1973 play, its key source is a gristly 19th-century penny dreadful, “The String of Pearls: A Romance,” which describes a homicidal barber and the baker Mrs. Lovett, his unsavory accomplice. Still, the revenge plot, with its abductions and threats of rape, echoes “Titus Andronicus” and the use of human mincemeat as the symbol of ultimate inhumanity smacks of homage. As Mrs. Lovett sings, “It’s man devouring man, my dear/And who are we to deny it here.” Heiner Müller, the experimental German playwright who specialized in grimly absurdist Shakespeare rewrites, refashioned “Titus Andronicus” as a postmodern, postcolonial debauch. His version lays bare the violence of the original (arguably pretty bare already) while reframing it as a political allegory of how wealthier nations exploit impoverished ones. Drawing on the 1973 Chilean coup and a divided Berlin, Müller explores the failure of culture and human progress to make the world a less brutalized place. As one character says, “Poetry is murder.” Before Mr. Bannon became Donald J. Trump’s chief strategist, he fell for another populist leader, albeit one with more military experience: Titus. The play obsessed him and in the early ’90s, he and the screenwriter Julia Jones collaborated on an interplanetary adaptation of “Titus Andronicus.” Here, Titus is the leader of the Andronicii, incorporeal beings who come to earth and take on human form. Shakespeare never included erotic scenes of ectoplasmic sex. Mr. Bannon did. Shockingly, studios passed. He and Ms. Jones also rewrote “Coriolanus” as a rap musical set during the Los Angeles riots. Though Mr. Bannon’s space guignol wouldn’t fly, he is listed as an executive producer on Julie Taymor’s 1999 film version of the tragedy, which reset the play in a Rome both ancient and modern. Anthony Hopkins said that his Titus referenced both King Lear and Hannibal Lecter, another character with outré taste in fine dining. Reviews were generally positive, with a Times critic writing that the movie “makes the best possible argument for a cautionary drama that contemplates the absolute worst in us.” But not only Rome loses big in “Titus.” The movie cost $25 million and made back just $2 million at the box office. In the 69th episode of “South Park,” a middle schooler, Scott Tenorman, convinces Cartman to buy his pubic hair. When his friends set Cartman straight on how puberty actually works, Cartman asks for his money back. Then he vows revenge. After various plans fail, including one involving guest stars Radiohead, Cartman arranges for the murder of Scott’s parents, lures Scott to a Chile Con Carnival and feeds him a dastardly bowl of chili. “Nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah, I made you eat your parents,” Cartman gloats. Founded in 2005, Titus Andronicus, which now styles itself +@, is a post-punk Brooklyn outfit led by Patrick Stickles. The name celebrates Shakespeare’s crowd-pleasing appeal and if serving a mother the pastry-encased corpses of her children isn’t punk rock, I mean what even is? The band’s first song on their debut album, 2008’s “The Airing of Grievances,” quotes liberally from Aaron’s Act V speech. Their fourth album, 2015’s “The Lamentable Tragedy,” a 29-song rock opera about Mr. Stickles’s manic depression, name-checks the “Titus Andronicus” title page in the 1623 folio, though honestly quarto editions are way more rock ’n’ roll.

5c2d52db3a125f5075c029ae,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/02/obituaries/daryl-dragon-dead.html,"Daryl Dragon, the “Captain” half of the pop duo the Captain and Tennille, whose string of soft-rock hits in the 1970s included “Love Will Keep Us Together” and “Muskrat Love,” died on Wednesday in Prescott, Ariz. He was 76. His former wife and singing partner, Toni Tennille, announced his death through a publicist, who said the cause was renal failure. The Captain and Tennille, whose specialty was romantic ballads featuring Ms. Tennille’s silky voice, reached the Top 10 seven times from 1975 to 1979. “He was a brilliant musician with many friends who loved him greatly,” Ms. Tennille said in a statement. “I was at my most creative in my life when I was with him.” Mr. Dragon’s stage name came from his days as a backup musician with the Beach Boys in the 1960s and early ’70s, when he often wore a captain’s hat onstage. Mike Love, one of the group’s leaders, would introduce him to audiences as the “captain of the keyboards.” He had been performing with the Beach Boys for several years before the hat made its fateful appearance. “I just picked it up one night on the spur of the moment,” he told The Boston Globe in 1976, “and that night they spotlighted me in ‘Help Me Rhonda.’ It made a big hit, and I’ve been wearing it ever since.” Daryl Dragon was born on Aug. 27, 1942, in Los Angeles. His father, Carmen, was a composer and conductor, and his mother, Eloise (Rawitzer) Dragon, was a soprano who sang on radio programs. Mr. Dragon was trained in classical piano but didn’t take to it. “I seemed to be at war with myself in my musical tastes,” he told The Globe. “I could appreciate the great compositions, but I also liked the boogie beat.” He played in several bands in the 1960s before signing on with the Beach Boys. He met Ms. Tennille in 1971, when he was brought in to play keyboards for the San Francisco run of an ecology-themed musical, “Mother Earth,” which she had co-written and in which she was performing with South Coast Repertory, a theater company from Orange County, Calif. He in turn brought her onto a Beach Boys tour as a backup singer and pianist. The two began performing together in nightclubs, and after self-financing a demo, they landed a record contract. Their cover of “Love Will Keep Us Together,” a song that Neil Sedaka and Howard Greenfield wrote and that Mr. Sedaka recorded in 1973, became a worldwide hit in 1975, reaching No. 1 on the Billboard singles chart and winning the Grammy Award for record of the year. The Captain and Tennille kept turning out hits for the rest of the 1970s. They also landed a television variety show on ABC as the network tried to duplicate the success that Sonny and Cher had enjoyed with their own show earlier in the decade. But the series, which had its premiere in September 1976, lasted only one season. Mr. Dragon found the whole experience distasteful. “Television is a great garbage disposal,” he said at the time. “It keeps grinding up artists like us and throwing them away.” Mr. Dragon produced all 10 of the duo’s 10 albums. They continued to perform after their hit-making run ended in 1979 — “Do That to Me One More Time” was their last gold record — and Mr. Dragon produced other artists. Ms. Tennille, meanwhile, increasingly pursued solo projects. The couple divorced in 2014. In 2016, Ms. Tennille published a memoir in which she wrote that their marriage had not been the idyllic partnership it had been made to seem. Their record company, she wrote, falsely announced that they had married on Valentine’s Day 1975; to satisfy expectations, they married for real not long after. “I can say without exaggeration that he showed no physical affection for me during our very long marriage,” she wrote. Mr. Dragon is survived by a brother, Doug. "
5c5092ad3a125f5075c06ec4,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/29/arts/music/aprile-millo-met-opera-new-york-zankel.html,"“It’s so perfect, it makes you want to cry,” the soprano Aprile Millo said, her eyes getting moist just thinking about it. She was sitting in a rehearsal room last week, talking about a song she was about to practice. It is on the program of her recital on Wednesday at Zankel Hall, her first in New York in 10 years. But Ms. Millo could also have been describing her voice: an instrument of easy, opulent power and fiery yet sumptuous phrasing, a moving recollection of the great Italian singers who ruled 60 or 70 years ago. It was a voice that thrilled the Metropolitan Opera through the 1980s and ’90s, when Ms. Millo was among the house’s reigning divas: the grandly emoting star of new productions, opening nights and TV broadcasts opposite Plácido Domingo and Luciano Pavarotti. Then, at what should have been the height of her career, things petered out. Her Met performances grew less frequent; she hasn’t appeared with the company since 2007. Over the past decade, she has barely sung in public at all. “There was a general feeling that her career had wound down at that point,” Peter Gelb, the Met’s general manger, said of her last performances. But it hadn’t, and hasn’t — at least not if Ms. Millo has something to say about it. At 60, she has her heart set on returning to the Met. “It’s not about voice; the voice has been functioning,” she insisted in an interview after the rehearsal. “But when you go through a lack of confidence, you’re not going to want to be anywhere.” So the audience on Wednesday will be listening closely: to hear the singer still treasured as among the most authentic contemporary exponents of the great Verdian tradition, and to hear whether she still has what it takes to command the Met. Ms. Millo says her instrument is ready; it’s her nerves and her appearance — a bit more ample than in her heyday — that she feels still need work. “I want it,” she said. “But I want to actually show up looking correct. I don’t want to offer excuses. My time will either come or it won’t. But I think God is moving me toward it.” Born to a pair of singers in New York in 1958, Ms. Millo was that rarity: an operatic prodigy, her sound alarmingly mature when she was still in elementary school. The art form in her household was always wrapped up in transformation. “They did the ‘Cavalleria Rusticana’ duet,” Ms. Millo said, “and they were no longer Mom and Dad.” Both parents and child embraced reinvention: Hamill was changed to Millo before she was born, and she turned April into Aprile, pronounced a-PREE-lay. She came of age on the West Coast, starring in musicals at Hollywood High School, then went on the classical competition circuit. She flourished. Auditioning when she was barely in her 20s for the New York City Opera, where her father had sung in the 1940s (and which is presenting her recital on Wednesday), she was offered major contracts. Big roles beckoned in Europe, too. Ms. Millo instead chose to enter the young artist program at the Met, where she studied, bided her time and found a champion in James Levine. A few outdoor performances of Verdi’s “Ernani” in the summer of 1984 excited connoisseurs, and her New York career was ready to ignite that December when she made an unexpected house debut — three weeks ahead of schedule — replacing a colleague in Verdi’s “Simon Boccanegra.” “It was like she came out of nowhere,” Michael Capasso, City Opera’s general director, recalled. “She sang that ‘Boccanegra’ — she was the cover — and the world was talking about her, literally overnight: ‘You’ve got to hear this woman.’” Among the fiercely opinionated opera fans who were the company’s grass roots, she swiftly became so beloved that the stage-right column in the Met’s Orchestra-level lobby is still known by some as the “Millo pole,” where you’d rush at intermission to kibitz about her performances. “For me,” the longtime artist manager and administrator Matthew Epstein said, “she was one of two female singers, what [the conductor Tullio] Serafin used to call vocal miracles, at the end of the 20th century: Borodina” — the Russian mezzo-soprano Olga Borodina — “and Aprile Millo.” “Aprile was a unique vocal phenomenon,” Mr. Epstein said. “And all of us who remembered what it was supposed to sound like love her very much for that.” Not everyone was on board. “Some operagoers,” the critic Susan Elliott wrote in 1990, “are still debating whether Millo is the real thing, or merely a collection of diva mannerisms.” But those “mannerisms,” vocal and physical gestures that might have seemed hopelessly old-fashioned coming from others, seemed, when Ms. Millo did them, the very embodiment of opera’s origins. This gave her performances an uncanny, seance-like aspect, even as they also felt wholly fresh — the voice healthy and secure — and deeply felt. “There was a ‘Tosca’ performance,” Ms. Millo recalled, “and I left the stage, and I fully expected to see the Palazzo Farnese when I went through the door. I was truly there.” She had triumphs through the Verdi canon — “Don Carlo,” “Il Trovatore,” “Aida,” “Otello,” “Un Ballo in Maschera,” “Luisa Miller” — as well as in “Tosca” and “Andrea Chénier.” She starred in the Met premiere of Verdi’s “I Lombardi” in 1993, a run she points to as perhaps the start of her troubles. A deviated septum temporarily changed her hearing, making her, she said, “uncharacteristically cautious” and leading to rumors of vocal problems. A “Mefistofele” in 1999, canceled at the last minute when she had acid reflux after drinking lemonade, made her seem unreliable. “And then we run into ‘You’re not glamorous enough,’ and I got heavy,” Ms. Millo said, fearing there was no place for her in an operatic culture increasingly focused on HD cinema broadcasts. She grew perilously indecisive about engagements. “She is like every gifted artist: full of issues, full of fears,” Mr. Epstein said. “Aprile is gripped by fear, and it is very hard for her to get past it.” Which is not to say she has been silent. She has given master classes and been generous with guidance for young singers, and has appeared in concert here and there. Mr. Gelb, who started at the Met in 2006, said, “Over the course of my tenure, I’ve received an occasional email from her, that she’s working toward getting back to singing and she’ll let me know when she’s ready.” Is she? “I feel that there’s still opera in her,” said Robert Lombardo, a veteran artist manager. “I don’t think she’s going to go out there and sing Giselda” — in “I Lombardi” — “but there are roles she can certainly get into the voice, and it depends on her will and how much she wants to do.” He mentioned Cilea’s “L’Arlesiana,” and “Andrea Chénier.” “I think she still has a couple of miles left in her to do it the right way,” he said. Mr. Gelb is more doubtful. “I think it’s unlikely,” he said, “given the length of time she’s been away and that she hasn’t been singing on major stages. But nothing’s impossible.” “If she were to suddenly have the goods vocally to sing on the stage of the Met,” he added, “we would put her on the stage of the Met.” And that is where Ms. Millo wants to be. “I would like to salute that house one more time,” she said. “Because it has great spirits and a need for something that is a little bit demented.” “I don’t want it to end with: ‘She was great and she was on the scene; where’d she go?’” she added. “I want to end nicely. I want to have a good last act. The first act was so good; it would be nice to have a good last act.” "
