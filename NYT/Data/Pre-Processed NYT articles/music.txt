sometimes whale want change tune 
one thing researcher learned recently eavesdropping whale several part world listening change pattern pitch together new study suggest whale whistling water constantly evolving form communication beginning understand 
whale dolphin vocalize dolphin toothed whale mostly make clicking whistling sound humpback possibly bowhead sing complex song repeated pattern michael noad associate professor cetacean ecology acoustic laboratory university queensland australia 
bird may broadcast social hierarchy among song sharing population allowing dominant bird pick playlist pattern whale pas song fragment across hundred mile thousand animal far mysterious 
biggest question whale sing 
thing always get bed morning function song noad find humpback song fascinating point view evolved 
leading hypothesis male humpback male sing trying attract female may switch tune another male nearby apparently ass rival size fitness noad senior author one four new paper whale song 
humpback musical pattern tend complex whale bit murky noad suggested development may result called runaway selection 
early humpback complex song much successful mating gained substantial evolutionary advantage brother simpler vocalization led large sometimes noisy animal 
julien bonnel associate scientist wood hole oceanographic institution massachusetts growing research show importance collecting data many year offering insight whale ocean condition affect specie 
technology recording whale gotten much cheaper last dozen year making accessible researcher computer program analyze huge data set quickly helped interpret year recording 
tagging whale without hurting produced data noad noted tag remain whale hour limiting information collected 
one new study led scientist new based wildlife conservation society researcher tracked humpback singing along east west coast africa comparing song sung coast gabon near madagascar 
study published journal royal society open science confirmed two population interact noting overlap vocalization researcher recorded song annually using hand held hydrophones aboard boat 
male humpback whale within population tend sing song type continuously changing evolving time melinda rekdahl study first author marine conservation scientist wildlife society thought one best example cultural evolution animal kingdom 
rekdahl boat collected sound new study know firsthand amazing experience 
sound nearby singer resonates hull boat singer close hear song getting fainter whale surface nearby recalled 
singer close added often sit hour recording hearing song headphone see whale anywhere 
rekdahl based new study data collected thought recording offered best opportunity compare song similarity neighboring population 
idea using song look population mixing connectivity relatively new proven valuable last year 
animal repeat sound others sing aberrant tune juvenile may hum jingle altogether different adult humpback alter tune time 
one reason might novelty nearby female swimming whale male singing song drive crazy rekdahl maybe female give new song 
two additional recent study examined song change seasonally across year 
one paper jenny allen doctoral student noad found unexpected pattern among humpback song reach certain level complexity humpback drop tune entirely pick new simpler one study first quantify complexity song published proceeding royal society biological science 
clear oscillating pattern something really expect allen postdoctoral researcher university queensland lecturer griffith university australia 
assuming song meant attract female might brand new song bit sexier continuing sing complicated version old song hard memorize whole new song simplifying make easy learn much new material 
humpback song lot repeating pattern might make easier remember rhyme end poetry line aid memorization allen found lot predictability pattern compared pop song based four chord 
another new paper researcher university brest france found pitch antarctic blue whale pygmy blue whale fin whale vocalization fell various recording site southern indian ocean 
whale anatomy louder call higher pitch quieter one lower essentially whale gotten slightly quieter emmanuelle leroy research fellow university new south wale author new research 
blue whale mostly solitary communicate across large distance need produce really low frequency high intensity call call really loud propagate hundred kilometer 
team two hypothesis explain drop pitch across year population rebounding since end commercial whaling perhaps whale need call carry far heard others 
science time page facebook sign science time newsletter 
perhaps ocean acidifying climate change call naturally carrying farther allowing whale reduce volume team believe change pitch tied directly human activity 
research published journal geophysical research ocean showed call pitch antarctic blue whale varies across season pitch increasing hertz spring summer dropping time 
might whale response loud cleaving iceberg spring summer extremely loud sound cracking ice glass make harder whale hear one another crank volume leroy 
noad think overall drop pitch reflection aging population older whale making deeper sound 
contrary scientist belief whale hear human made noise quite distance way people urban environment hear distant rumble traffic even car passing directly 
humpback whale made really nice comeback since commercial whaling largely stopped noad unknown reason blue fin whale still struggling thousand antarctic blue whale remain
