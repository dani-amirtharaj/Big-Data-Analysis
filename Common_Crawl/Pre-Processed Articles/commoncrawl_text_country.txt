lily carol burnett dolly ann margret dolly lily jane head whole time hoping thats
wrote screenplay colin higgins signed direct reworked change written dark comedy secretary actually tried kill bos although tried kill sort funny way originally jane concerned dark screened old charlie chaplin film called monsieur verdoux chaplin wife blind child he kind blackbeard romance series woman course movie murder order money support family comedy end hang turned jane end movie tear rolling cheek concerned woman wouldnt sympathetic enough killed woman youre cry want try wont successful colin came influenced warner bros cartoon thing attempt kill became fantasy scene made much broader comedy
spend time set worked altman writer set entire production thought thats hollywood worked colin higgins came one meeting basically write write believe there one captain set thats director dont want actor instead want visit set lunch thats fine
worked heartbreaking think cried every night couple week went first screening felt kid kid sent military school came back two year later squinting guess kind kid painful thats unfortunately go writer feature dont copyright fire replace change director hard lesson learn
hilariously new york time review called militant cry freedom cant imagine response actually attempted kill bos serious movie worker right jane pile pile documentation clerical worker knew wanted comedy make social message palatable
interesting question kind medium affect social change big feminist pop culture moment often wonder translates beyond raising awareness
hard way weve definitely moved forward little bit seem sentiment country one political party seems trying undo little weve able make difficult many people think settled musical broadway frustrating interview male journalist first well none issue problem contemporary life woman today able relate thought yeah cant sexually harass someone obviously dont call people secretary changed people kill work
female screenwriter late seventy dont male screenwriter hard career different much wanted writing directing feature film part career trajectory even tremendous success happen think female conversation right primarily lack female director female writer much better term screenwriting last two year believe small percentage gotten even smaller term television somewhat better woman percentage woman still quite small
particular war story silent bias wasnt happen direct everybody sort smile kind one anecdote seven month pregnant first child directed short film award cable excellence ace award powerful female producer well cant plan directing baby direct baby realized soon particularly single parent couldnt mean wasnt something pursue time career changed think thing dont think men think ended two kid time feature kind dried think combination age gender couldnt work started reluctantly television actually came love
appreciated recent new york time magazine article issue began story young man hollywood reminding older man come mentoring men helping bring along men werent many powerful woman bring along younger woman possibly getting better certainly feature woman producer especially executive almost afraid push woman writer didnt well pushing woman whereas guy didnt well well didnt well wasnt guy writer
seems woman willing work woman project seems one woman room seeing female producer bringing female writer partnering woman fortunate mentored robert altman yet didnt let write lily tomlin let write
there buzz sort reunion dolly parton appearing guest spot grace frankie inside scoop none people love see three together year talk sequel remake dolly always say remake ship probably sailed there certainly enormous goodwill affection toward movie amazing many year later known loved thats wonderful wish antique vintage politics
