much black blue pick trail fingerprint file hot stuff open side one hey negrita open side two intricate funk jam fusing reggae latin rhythm meter brand funk without achieving focused mood fingerprint file playing exceptional hot stuff charlie watt might playing magnum instead drum never coalesces slam message home
producer objective voice made difference merely resequencing song helped middle side repetitive sameness hot stuff hey negrita seemed portentous least
plenty good stuff left although marred need fuller firmer instrumentation hand fate isnt melodic stone riff usually brought life blistering wayne perkins guitar solo jagger incredibly live vocal crazy mama wild little rocker close set hot stuff sound control face although wood doesnt play band play two song lyric marvelous cause think push gon bust knee bullet two hard rocker album time jagger pull standard macho demonic act former perplexing news latter may regarded one good omen
jagger new role professional singer great melody ought tentative experiment billy prestons jazzy keyboard sound instead triumph jagger voice swooping snaking around prestons piano harmony black blue leaf nothing else knowledge jagger become total pro rock great white vocalist rod stewart van morrison match album two ballad fool cry memory motel material sing pride
fool cry harks back confessional style one mick original influence solomon burke talk cry number riding wave nicky hopkins string synthesizer stalked lonely terror haunt many recent stone number jagger consoled sometimes berated daughter woman best friend open neat oblique comment parenthood another sign maturity finally striking song mick jagger living inspiration tried match otis redding marvin gaye power younger day failed brilliantly older wiser prof equal singer ballad
memory motel sort return moonlight mile stop pulled watt propels tune drumming story begin mick meet girl last summer tour real memory motel near house montauk long island band rehearsed soon becomes entangled recollection tour
singing nothing spectacular jagger powerful yearning almost supplicant real revelation always keith richard sneak touching line
mighty fine shes one kindshe mind ownshes one kindand use well
perfect description keith richard last summer tour racing forward sing happy running show poise ever given credit

remember often day long since rock essentially fad yet still treat cavalierly dismissing career basis single disliked album often cruelest given seeing short term forgetting deal career one shot hit black blue may invincible rolling stone dream virtue
black blue leaf remembering first important lesson learned stone empty heart empty life may band told sullen teenager recognize one proud
routinely dismissed band synth pop robot depeche mode actually machine make human sound around black celebration certainly british quartet melodic effort date clanging disco concrete fusion early construction time mellowed brand brooding romantic music hinted last year great reward havent felt alive year gush singer dave gahan tonight ghostly closer although composer lyricist martin gore even celebration pretty bleak
gore dissects gloomy obsession wit intelligence abetted bandmates inventive technician understand machine werent meant sound souped electric organ despite campy horror show title fly windscreen final sort matter fact meditation mortality people flash behind wheel car bank synths buzz ominously verse fly amplifying unease whoosh gratefully first chorus reach life solace come kiss
ditty unabashed love song albeit brutally honest quirky one pick apart popular notion emotional independence question lust adolescent sex question time world full nothing itchy mechanized beat song serious image mongering depeche mode loyal teen following appropriately enough underneath bleached blond black leather pose lurks musical maturity wry sensibility deserving wider read adult audience
world according sex money politics trapping adulthood sick joke rock sacred one side berry written many great rock roll song rock roll band short ramones militantly refused reach beyond basic form offer vision stone keith every argument concept album keyboard disco ballad gospel choir black ice best argument year maybe decade evolution sucker
keeping sound static place pressure songwriting first time since razor edge reached generation beavis guitarist malcolm angus young written tune worthy musical muscle though enough fill album radio savvy producer brendan obrien board best stuff nearly life career peak especially rock roll train brother young toss fat slashing chord knife juggler drummer phil rudd swing beneath inhumanly restrained beat reluctant play fill make charlie watt sound dave grohl
similarly bassist cliff williams seems content play pumping eighth note every song ever except funky walking line lay excellent like rock roll another instant classic big jack swagger long lost back black track even song rely well worn trick two string high note riffing anything recall rock salute enough verve
avoid cheerful sexism past see oral sex ode givin dog bone otherwise word havent changed much aside new preoccupation apocalyptic meteorology sky fire stormy may day black ice title war machine ominously topical lyric vague enough call wild gone wild suggest machine another phallic metaphor phew
unlike original frontman bon scott born shrieker brian johnson natural baritone delivering tortured weasel high note sheer force recently sounded wheezy menacing top range obrien hitting note band emphasizes chorus returning rich backup vocal enlivened greatest hit
group guy convinced theyre album band refuse sell song individually online trouble making consistent album since rock black ice pull away trend doesnt reverse album feel longer minute thanks stretch throwaway rocker including mindless spoilin fight generic even standard wheel
there something almost elegiac black ice multiple ode rock rocking rock roll dream etc guy true believer fighting war one told ended long ago gon rock round town gon make right gon make rock night johnson yelp one point making clear band still find resonance word clich youve salute
dont ask whats happened martha figure either here latest album respectable package last natural resource another collection odds end carelessly wrapped tissue paper filler spilling seam packed thick almost whole find good part
perhaps inevitable result black magic organized disorganized although documentation coordinator credited album apparently work several different producer production team working material instance bless written corporation produced previously issued single life produced written team george gordy lawrence brown credited album likelihood two producer contributing album even cut uninspired tired reworking george harrison something retrieved last final product predictably paste uneven quality sort barely interested handling given unproven group one hit single martha shrugged motown past year aint right heat wave may thats reason freeze poor girl
spite black magic contains nice work martha reef least survives tendency build vandellas sandra tilley lois reef electronic depth device make sound anonymous chorus place instrumental track martha burying girl opening track one stand perhaps one worthy group certainly best theyve done since single proud understated arrangement style reminiscent early supremes marthas baby love bright crisp lyrically sort specific imagery distinguished proud left alone martha tormented car use driveway turn around talking emptiness make lonely sound leaf vivid picture woman lying darkened room love long share martha doesnt sound powerful intensity leveled much toughness gone retains warm rich insinuating quality make even opening hum moan utterly delicious try hard recapture old martha quite make start jumping around thinking live wire quicksand notice song thin half loud enough tambourine instead hand clapping martha lack proper grit well
second best cut written nick ashford valerie simpson suspect produced tear begin valerie simpson number note piano thumping drum martha announcing wan sing song pride listen include best use vandellas one tastiest production job life current single respectable bland martha come strong context sound especially bass line nice finally sort sits
dont even want talk rest stuff silly bless strangely joint terribly embarrassing version want back see jackson try heat wave lifeless anyone heart great benjamin sound moderately intelligent show tune show tune nevertheless
dont understand martha motown politics maybe group untogether right come memory
