given double life musician producer thought great subject kick series interview producer best bring creative vision artist fore
make transition musician producer
started yellowjackets band first record robben ford robben ford project first together produced steve cropper called inside story elektra asylum interesting record process great great working steve legendary guy time still matter shortly ended getting separate deal warner brother ended becoming yellowjackets tommy lipuma produced record
working stuff late early different producer ron nevison tom dowd eddy offord steve cropper always interested worked kept eye ear open listened people people watched production handled took mental note time never thinking lean toward later career something interested fortunate enough work heavyweight producer including gary katz produced steely dan one point took wing educational period time pick thing working well known producer
learn people katz dowd little thing bigger thing
far bigger message organization resource much injecting idea making sure listen artist band understanding direction artist band distinct direction honor listen direction try connect artist band see find direction make sure discussed everyone agreement case abundant resource list musician play different kind music cast situation either traditional aspect non traditional aspect
thing swirling around head always loved music foot wet working yellowjackets record early one produced tommy lipuma took note famous guy know certain point started producing laid groundwork start honing producing record band certain point self produced band gave opportunity organize understand producer beginning end finding studio getting engineer getting material together determine guest musician whole etiquette talking people manager even lawyer whole nine yard including artwork art direction always aspect creative process making record grew album artwork important gathering credit making sure crossed dotted
think bassist gave particular advantage
something producer bassist think mandatory laugh producer even professional musician think door wide open anybody passionate music hopefully organizational skill although worked producer unorganized assistant together enough understand maybe organized needed hire someone help organized organized top mentioned budget allocate money spent spend case always wanted come budget artist much recoup whatever money left artist pocket financial side addition getting musician engineer studio music arrangement art direction producer wear hat case feel good producer good multi tasker happen fit bill think important producer passion music rounded knowledge music even case becoming ethnomusicologist actually study music world therefore sense around available

pick project artist work project pick producing real commitment part
serious time commitment take project want available problem especially last five six year time factor involved project even time recently almost produced five record simultaneously challenge laugh fortunately able allot time multi tasker jump one another immediately focused need done pride necessarily want perpetuate five project simultaneously challenging wore producing solo record joe vanelli producer fact producer project helped physically able mixing session phone partner production team allowed multiple project including solo record couple project jeff lorber norwegian saxophonist vega singer plus record guitarist dave hill one robben ford michael landau shrapnel different kind music running around hectic schedule
decide work music great person difficult

werner known great piano player yet work arguably affecting kenny werner piano player focus piece looking pianistic chop want check recording werner recognizes shift belief reflects growth creative musician moving direction showing chop meaningless afraid direction even quintet record people jeez dominate interested environment music share mile vision environment created mystique environment focusing playing solo record soon coming france whole record surprised virtuosic stuff recorded came time pick cut pick instead picked stuff inner connection whether progressive general kind inner connection meaning whole proving ground zero meaning
lately entering zone beyond competitive demonstrative proving ground werner considers herbie hancock effective role model playing piano herbie frank sinatra werner say emphatically appreciate older recent stuff wise zen philosophy subscribes sometimes hearing play solo piano watching leaf blow talk someone completely unconcerned technique showing rather allowing current life flow manifest music sure describes herbie wayne shorter talking chris potter conceal amazement wayne note matter fast play close level wisdom herbie think hear play
great work album seems clearly something easily duplicated live choir string section distinctive sax possible perform live try find proper venue easier locally whole choir already learned whole wind ensemble already learned string quartet make propose place may classical program wind piece various school program wanted motivate choir wind ensemble new york hope major concert start wind ensemble piece choir string quartet coda needed another set perhaps joe play duet
listening opening section tough back story werner confirms intensity direct reflection accident effect yes say werner joe judi improvising beginning sort high active light filled space daughter katheryn inspired state day place spiritual practice spend time every day flying moment never never forget werner talked phone california daughter day thankfully neither negative superficial conversation rare privilege talking daughter morning day recall fondly telling good stuff finally quiet envisioned moved upstate new york quietly went thank dad last word ever complete term communication

setting new standard
father teenaged daughter talking werner easy task something rather special relationship father daughter freudian psychology aside something anyone easily explain historically father daughter mother son werner say either certainly worked family piece special two reason one story prompted piece strongest piece art ever created set new standard
werner clear new standard writing tune blow even reinventing jazz standard always one goal away art form personal inner urge quote joe henderson think getting closer life closer powerful music cultural term emotional term people listen one went beyond see next
creating major work begs question artist case werner created masterpiece composition based deepest traumatic event life move musically tell truth thought retirement half kidding half say chuckling half kidding make living half kidding totally happy recluse point study instead perform favorite musician enthusiastic studying performing constant growth make feel young conscious age every time something new piano kick twenty happened writing place space grow technical ability orchestrating technical expertise expression need amount work happy spend rest life trying write orchestration piece higher higher level
inspiring father write sophisticated intricate music one katheryn werner legacy finding theme focus doubt challenge father lost daughter regardless werner know want play standard wanted originally sidetracked fact actually commission write concerto piano saxophone danish orchestra anywhere near emotionally find new topic generally interested topic different want make piece jazz piece classical music even want make piece art want express something actual meaning human back

indeed levenson say project hybrid nature creates problem good bad half note marketer recording submitted grammy consideration category alone underscored challenge involved marketing selling far categorizing symphonic classical jazz composed improvised work defies easy categorization discussion wonderful challenge time make little difficult people absorb magnitude different
daughter legacy
still much proud father werner hesitate second asked talk daughter unique quality seems apple fall far creative tree case started piano playing guitar writing song awhile song starting good influence early joni mitchell early record among wife favorite music bigger influence jazz musician fact
according werner music one facet gifted young woman young age seemed embody deeper level understanding writing writing ever put gathered wisdom gathering already age made understand ready expressing stuff try learn life carried much baggage try undo learn wisdom baggage already clear example thought joy service kid particular spiritual practice follow learn course believe much baggage self centeredness peel onion pure thought grown thought happy near wisdom wise articulate
talent ranged even farther music writing main passion besides music photography still hope show photography point much organize great eye great imagination photography person always helpful even kindergarten try help kid whatever wish seen done talent decisiveness afraid genuine concern people embodied best element wife best humanitarian talented clever daughter embodied thing beautiful talent funny real commitment humanity mother
losing child perhaps single difficult marriage werner say case wife brought closer face trauma unimaginable parent high percentage people divorce something happens think choice lose touch grief blame whoever know grow closer together ever happened lorraine share bond never share anybody else creation child loving child loss child see wife used see daughter anything make life happy committed formed stronger bond ever fortunately
perhaps incredible werner contention eventual acceptance tragedy loss unique exceptional everybody say imagine god forbid happened gotten anybody else unless something happens heroic one person getting anybody get never course god willing never
emotionally intellectually werner say seeing piece performed live deep effect strangely spectator almost looking effect realized empty good first time long time made expression grief least minute peace
