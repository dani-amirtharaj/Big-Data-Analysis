Maya B's sparky Dollar To A Diamond is the pick of the bunch but there's plenty else that deserves some time in your ears.  28 of the 30 good songs in this week's playlist are sung by women: not an unusual state of affairs in a Popjustice Edit, but pretty fitting for International Women's Day. Hooray! Now let's think about how the same playlist would look if it only included songs 100% made by women. A playlist featuring abso­lutely no male co-writers or producers.  One song.  This probably isn't a surprise to many of us but when you see it like this: good grief. One song! If you're inter­ested, Tayla Parx's producer and co-writer on I Want You is Wynne Bennett, who's also worked with people like Twin Shadow and Janelle Monáe. According to this interview Wynne has also seen a ghost. But let's not get side­tracked by tales of the super­nat­ural. ONE SONG. Some further reading, much of it quite depress­ing: Where Are All The Female Record Producers? (Billboard)Why Aren’t There More Women Working in Audio? (The Atlantic)Why Music Needs More Women Producers (Culture Trip)Why are female record producers so rare? (BBC)13 Women On How To Change Male-Dominated Studio Culture (The Fader)Why Do Female Music Producers Only Make Up 5% Of The Industry? (Girltalk) Ruin My Life by Zara Larsson: quite a good song. Without Me by Halsey: also quite a good song. The common denom­in­ator is LA-based song­writer and now pop entity in her own right Delacey, whose new Ido Smishlany-produced single My Man is a) a really fresh pop tune and b) out and about as of right this very moment, following this evening's Annie Mac Hottest Record spin. ""I hope you feel like you know me when you hear this song,"" Delacey told Annie, ""and that you still like me after."" Delacey's bio blurb covers all the usual areas — ""lyrical rawness"" and ""toughness and vul­ner­ab­il­ity"" for instance, with the oblig­at­ory reference to ""ethereal, yet soulful vocals"" thrown in for good measure. But judging by the lyrics of My Man, Delacey seems like the sort of artist who'll make most sense when she tells her own story in her own words. Delacey describes herself as ""an endless bank of crazy things I’ve gone through""; people will connect with her music in an honest way, she hopes, adding: ""I hope that it makes them a little uncom­fort­able sometimes too.""  Billboard ran a fairly good interview with Delacey a couple of months ago; Songwriter Universe also had a chat with her last year. There'll be an EP later in the spring but for the time being My Man, a sort of post-Lana reima­gin­ing of Jolene that's being billed as Delacey's debut single, serves as a really strong intro­duc­tion to an artist whose presence could make pop a rather more pleasant place.  Books. They're like songs, except they go on longer and there's no sound. But they're still quite good! I don't really know what I intended this post to be when I started writing it, but what it's ended up being is a very strange selection of music books from the past, the present and the future. It's an assort­ment based on very little rhyme and abso­lutely no reason. Some books are good, some are quite bad. Some are inter­est­ing, some are boring. They're all worth a go, though.  (I'm assuming you've already read the Lily Allen book.) I read this over Christmas but given how closely Maloney's 2012 X Factor reappear­ance as a wildcard con­test­ant mirrored the story of Jesus' own comeback perhaps you'll find it makes sense as an Easter read. As you might expect there are some unin­ten­tion­ally ludicrous moments in this book — it's incred­ible to think that among the billions of sentences written in the history of humankind never before have the following words appeared in the following order: ""I was now living off crackers and spam and lasted four days before vomiting every­where on a fermented egg.""  Which may seem funny in isolation, but it's not so funny in context: Wildcard tells the story of a man whose life has rarely, if ever, been easy. Wildcard isn't the greatest book of all time but it's an important read for any of us who at one time or another have cheerily dis­mantled Maloney or celebrit­ies like him. On the left: a legendary book from fifteen years ago that got loads of things right.  On the right: a new book I haven't read properly yet and which seems, shall we say, a little light on jokes, but which also (among some quite dry business stuff) unpacks a lot of inform­a­tion about how Spotify ended up becoming a pop force whose full impact nobody really saw coming.  You can get a fair idea of what Spotify Teardown's like via the Amazon Look Inside feature. Music publicist Mick Houghton's account of two decades' work in the music industry isn't out for a few months, but an advance copy arrived in the post last week and I finished it yesterday.  I first encountered Mick when I was an extremely annoying twelve-year-old who didn't really under­stand what music pub­li­cists did, but I sort of figured out that if you phoned them, like, on an actual telephone, and if they were as patient as Mick Houghton, they might sometimes send you music by and pho­to­graphs of your favourite band. Maybe that sort badgering is only really tolerated if the pub­li­cists have them­selves exper­i­enced the feeling of being, as Houghton describes his youth in the first page of this book's first chapter, ""mad about music as a teenager"".  Fried & Justified is frank and sometimes funny, and I suppose it's mainly a memoir, but it's something else, too. One of Houghton's most suc­cess­ful acts once wrote a book in which they told readers how to have a Number One single; while not presented or intended as such, Fried & Justified could easily be regarded as a manual on how to be a decent music PR.   Look, strictly speaking this book doesn't exist yet but I think we can all safely assume it will be very much on the right side of readable. (Hopper's 2015 col­lec­tion of writing is an absolute banger.) The weird thing about the whole absurd story of a record label being bought then totally bol­locksed up by an invest­ment group is that it happened REALLY RECENTLY and SORT OF IN FRONT OF OUR EYES, and somehow the full extent of the shambles was never really obvious.  Anyway, Eamonn's book is the opposite of shit as well as being a) jaw-dropping and b) very funny in parts, the latter of which you really can't ever take for granted in books about the music industry. Selling The Pig does also highlight just how ludicrous, compared to most other indus­tries, the music industry can be: all the guesswork, all the excess, all the failure that's somehow part of the plan. There are times in this book when you almost — almost —  feel sorry for the people who came in and thought they could fix it.  This one just arrived in the post so I've only had the chance for a quick flick through but it's based on a great idea: each chapter takes a different song and explores its char­ac­ters in the form of a short story.  ""I wondered what was going on outside the tracks,"" Easter explains in the intro­duc­tion. ""The composer gives us so much, but what about the rest? What does Dolly Parton's Jolene look like and why's she stealing everyone's men? What's her back story?""  Cover Stories expands the worlds of songs like Bowie's Space Oddity and Ed Sheeran's The A-Team. (If there's a second volume I'd def­in­itely read a chapter on Rihanna's Man Down.) Apart from the bad font on the cover this has to be the perfect pop­cul­tural artefact, right?  It contains a 15-page intro­duc­tion in which I assume Neil talks about the song­writ­ing process, but I'm not totally sure because I am saving it for a special day. You've got to have something to look forward to in life, right? (Neil's col­lec­tion was the first in what's turned out to be a series of collected lyric 'tomes'; Kate Bush and Shaun Ryder have already chucked theirs out, pre­sum­ably there'll be an Anne-Marie one along before too long.)  In which, over 120 pages, Radio 1 DJ Peter Powell attempted to cover the total history of pop music and the workings of the entire music industry, while also telling readers how to be popstars and throwing in the occa­sional quiz. The result was, well, not great, but this is such a fas­cin­at­ing artefact.  Loads-slash-most of the book is glor­i­ously out of date now, of course, but Peter's advice on how to write a hit song is hil­ari­ously blunt and, if you take a click through some of 2019's biggest songs, it remains spookily accurate: ""The melody .… has to fit whatever the current trends in music happen to be. Try listening to and studying the Top Forty. If you play an instru­ment, try playing one of two of the songs and get the feel of the way the chords are strung together. Then change them around and see how that sounds."" Outstanding. If you'd like to read this book there are currently two copies on Amazon — one is £0.01 and the other is £24.40 (?) so take your pick. If you can't be bothered with all that but still fancy a glimpse of what Radio 1 DJs were like four decades ago, clear 25 minutes in your diary for A World Of Difference on YouTube. It's an old BBC doc­u­ment­ary that follows the sur­pris­ingly bleak early morning routine of Noel Edmonds as he hosts the Radio 1 Breakfast Show.  The best song, by about a mile, to come out of this all this year's Eurovision selec­tions is Spirit In The Sky by KEiiNO. It's been in Popjustice's Big Hit Energy playlist for about a month and, in a rare instance of pop justice in action, over the weekend the semi-ludicrous, 100% amazing pop beast romped to victory at Melodi Grand Prix, meaning that it's now been selected as Norway's official actual entry. The song— ""a story about brave men and women that have fought, and are fighting, for the right to be respected and loved for the person you are"" — is a triumph in its own right, but as you can see from the per­form­ance below, if you throw in some smoke machines, some lasers, six strictly unne­ces­sary drummers and a load of crowd noise you've got 'quite a moment'. It's the crowd noise, isn't it? The crowd noise when the first chorus explodes. You simply cannot go wrong with crowd noise. The band should put a new version of Spotify which is just the normal version with crowd noise chucked on top.  In an email to Popjustice last month, Tom from the band explained that KEiiNO's goal ""is to make arctic pop-bangers combining joik, nordic folk and camp pop in a synth heavy sound"", which he might have just copied and pasted from some existing text but that doesn't matter because but whichever way you look at it that description's just ideal isn't it? Tom's next email was from ""up here in the mountains"". He added that the next day the band (Tom plus Fred Bujlo and Alexandra Rotan) would be out in a reindeer sled on the tundra (!), which isn't something you hear from many pop artists. Pictorial evidence quickly followed. Five points to take away from all this: Alphabeat, who return today with new single Shadows, will always have a special place in the pages of Popjustice.  They happened slightly by accident, about ten years ago, when a lot of the best pop felt like it still happened slightly by accident. They were a six-piece Danish band staffed almost entirely by people called Anders whose euphoric 80s-influ­enced pop ended up crossing over both com­mer­cially and inter­na­tion­ally. For a moment songs like Fascination and 10,000 Nights Of Thunder were ines­cap­able.  After the band's third album they split. An Anders from the band tells the Official Charts website today that they ""could no longer sit down and write a song for Alphabeat – it just wasn’t possible anymore."" Seems like that's no longer a problem. There's a whole new album due later this year and Shadows is a rather charming way of kicking things off.  As you know, Carly Rae Jepsen released two new songs this week: Now That I Found You and No Drug Like Me. If you find them on Spotify you'll notice they've been bundled with Party For One in a sort of three-song EP format. A 3P, if you will. It's a Carly Rae J3Psingle.  On January 18, CRJ posted this on her Facebook page: This week- not unlike weeks before I stressed right out about song selection and instead of going nuts, called my trusty friend/ guitarist Tavish Crowe who helped me dig to the bottom of some 100 plus songs. (More like 200). This process happened w Kiss and emotion and I want to give cheers to the truth that asking for help when you need it is never a bad thing. I find that it’s strong to know your weak­nesses. Needless to say we have a favs list now and a song order and he’s the one friend I turn to when I need to hear my OWN opinion still cause he lets me battle it out without weighing in to hard but instead, con­tinu­ally asking- what feels right to you??! So hold tight loves. I’m re- learning lessons I need to and short­l­ist­ing this bad boy for your pretty ears. Thanks for patience. Here a pic to remind me of the wishful thing I was before over writing and over thinking things. Soon I think, we get to dance. So what we're looking at here is a situation where Carly Rae Jepsen has a pile of up to 200 songs, and the best ones are the two she's released this week: Now That I Found You and No Drug Like Me.  How does that make you feel? How does it sit with you that from up to 200 songs sitting around on Carly Rae Jepsen's hard drives, those two are the best? First: a note about 'best'. People who work in pop have different, confusing and sometimes con­flict­ing ideas about what 'best' means, but it doesn't always (or often!) mean best best. The best song for the moment can just as often mean 'best to get streaming numbers back up' and 'best to fit in with the pop landscape right now', or 'best to act as a bridge and get us to a point where we can do something else'. Popstars sometimes don't ever release their best best songs. Still, the fact is that Now That I Found You and No Drug Like Me have been deemed the right songs to release right now. Best in some way, for some reason. Another note, before we continue: as we all know, the 'pick songs from a pile of hundreds' idea hasn't always brought Carly Rae Jepsen's best best songs to the surface on the first or even second attempt. Cut To The Feeling missed the cut on both E•MO•TION and the sub­sequent E•MO•TION: Side B album, meaning it was passed over not just once but twice. Which makes you wonder — of that par­tic­u­lar batch of songs, what else never made it out? And now the meat of the situation: neither of these two new CRJ songs is great. Come on. It's okay, you can let it all out. You're among friends.  Both songs are fine! Both are better than bad! But they're not Jeppo great. They're not Run Away With Me or Your Type. They're not the songs you would play someone to show them that, hey, perhaps they need to think twice about the person who made Call Me Maybe and perhaps they also need to rethink their thoughts about what pop and popstars can do. The most troubling thing about Now That I Found You is that it's the sort of thing people who don't listen to Carly Rae Jepsen think Carly Rae Jepsen songs sound like. And this week, they're right. There's a lot to unpack among all this: per­sist­ent questions about whether everyone or anyone in Camp Jeppo has ever really under­stood exactly how and why E•MO•TION did what it did and was what it was, whether goodwill and support from the more leftfield side of the media was help or hindrance, whether The Jeppsinator herself hears her music and likes the same things the rest of us do. There's also the question of whether niche success (which in 2019 is still quite a lot of success) is enough for Carly and her team or if, as the Spotpop-friendly sound of something like Party For One suggests, the ambition and aim is to move her on from her current position by crossing over into a less idio­syn­cratic pop space. It'll be inter­est­ing to see and hear what lies ahead for Carly Rae Jepsen as 2019 plays out. One surprise so far is that on the evidence of what's already out there she's not taking things back in the sonic direction of 2008's pre-Call Me Maybe album Tug Of War, which felt as if it was one of the ways things could end up panning out. It'd be good to hear that one day. Maybe that's still on the planner for sometime in the future. Maybe she doesn't want to go back there at all! Who knows. For the time being, the frus­trat­ing thing is that you know, somewhere in that pile of 100–200 songs, there's probably the perfect Carly Rae Jepsen album for right now: an album full of her best songs and her best best songs. And you know that for whatever reason, half that brilliant album's songs could easily end up staying in the pile forever. The Song Of The Week is Everybody Hates Me by The Japanese House. Says Amber: ""This song is about me being really hung over for two, three years. Every day waking up with that feeling of ‘everyone hates me and I’ve ruined my life.’ Looking back at the time, I thought—almost jokingly—it’s a hangover anthem. Now it’s really sad for me to look back knowing I spent so much time hating myself because I couldn’t stop drinking."" Song of the week, then, from what'll probably turns out to be one of the albums of the year.

1,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/?option=com_content&task=view&id=1483&Itemid=279,"Did you know that by 1987, orange trees had become the most cul­tiv­ated fruit trees in the world? 25 years later, sweet oranges made up 70% of all citrus business. People just fucking love oranges don't they? And there is no doubt that oranges taste delicious. What's better, for instance, on a summer's morning, than a refresh­ing glass of orange juice? Well, a can of Lilt, yes. But still. The thing is, if you take beverage pro­duc­tion out of the equation a standard orange is no match, certainly in terms of con­veni­ence, for the humble satsuma. Sadly thanks to the efforts of Big Orange it's unlikely satsumas will ever take their rightful place on the fruit throne.  To be clear on this: in no way is Popjustice sug­gest­ing that the mere existence of the song Orange Trees is hard proof that Marina has accepted money to promote oranges over satsumas. Equally, we live in a time where it would be foolish to state with total certainty that such an arrange­ment had not taken place.  Will Young's new video features the following: The song's very nice as well though, obviously!! It's the first single from Will's seventh (!) album Lexicon, which is out in June and features col­lab­or­a­tions with Richard X, Eg White, Jim Eliot and Mim Stilwell, Boy Matthews, and Danny Shah. The Song Of The Week is Headcase by Kailee Morgue and Hayley Kiyoko. Lots of pop is in a strange place at the moment and right in the middle of it all there's the welcome and neces­sar­ily rise in ""we need to have a con­ver­sa­tion about how we feel"" occa­sion­ally leading to what feels like marketing depart­ments, artists and even fans colluding in the unhelpful fet­ish­isa­tion of mental health issues. Kailee and Hayley get the balance just right on the bold but under­stated Headcase; ""hold my hand, don't touch"" is quite the lyric.  (Unexpectedly this song inter­pol­ates Pixies' 31-year-old song Where Is My Mind?.) Additional notes: It's a really strong New Music Friday this week. Maya B's sparky Dollar To A Diamond is the pick of the bunch but there's plenty else that deserves some time in your ears.  28 of the 30 good songs in this week's playlist are sung by women: not an unusual state of affairs in a Popjustice Edit, but pretty fitting for International Women's Day.

 What animal would you gladly never encounter in your lifetime?
An alligator. Who is your best friend?
My mum. Cringey, but true. Sorry mum! What’s the first thing you do when you wake up?
I turn off my alarm. I have Sam Cooke playing in the morning. He wakes me up and I turn him off straight away because I’m sick of that tune now. I’ve ruined it. It’s so annoying, I set it as my alarm because I love the song and now I hate it, so that’s really annoying. Who do you think has a perfect face?
Kate Upton. Are you in love?
No. Could you write Mutya Keisha Siobhan a hit?
(Laughs) No. Where’s the strangest place you’ve ever put your hand?
I went to an aquarium once and I had to put it in this hole and I still don’t know what was the other side. It was really freaky. It was quite scary. You know when you have no idea what’s gonna be in there. Seeing as it was in an aquarium I could’ve been touching all sorts. What’s the strangest thing you’ve ever put in your mouth?

A roast. How do you eat a Creme Egg?
I just had one! I dipped it into a cup of tea and I ate it in two bites. How old is too old for a man to go skate­board­ing?

Oh my god that is such a mean question. I love Robbie, I’ve been to his tours… You really put me in a tough position there! I’m just gonna reply saying take that. New York, London, Paris or Munich?
London. All the way baby. What does the Daily Mail mean to you?

So my grandad, off he walks to Waitrose and he was like ""I’m looking for G-strings, G-strings"". And he kept saying G-strings and he came back with these G-strings and we were like ""oh my god we can’t believe grandad has bought us G-strings! This is so embar­rass­ing"". I was starving aswell, so he wasn’t in the good books, poor grandad. Would you rather have no teeth or no hair?

5,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/articles/a-variety-of-papier-mache-britney-spears-heads/,"A few weeks ago we announced a pretty amazing Britney Spears com­pet­i­tion: dance on stage with Britney when she comes to London, just send us a papier mache Britney head in order to take part. Well, we received eleven entries (which is about ten more than we were expecting) and the quality of the entries was… Well, let's just say it was variable. Here are the heads we received. The winner is announced at the bottom.   Creator: Ryan Macklin Verdict: A good attempt but a little too close to Lady Gaga Britney. Pig nose in poor taste.   Creator: Thomas McHugh Verdict: Good present­a­tion, excellent hair work.   Creator: Stuart Brookes and Kristie Newbold Verdict: Balloons a nice touch; snake nicely detailed.   Creator: Lea and Dina Verdict: This entry has arrived all the way from Paris and while the accom­pa­ny­ing letter doesn't tell us what papier mache is in French it does include a detailed descrip­tion of the entrants' movements in and around Britney's London shows. Photographs of the head being made are also included.   Creator: Emma Higgins (""aged 25"") Verdict: ""I hope you like my paper mache inter­pret­a­tion of Britney Spears' dark moment when she shaved her head,"" writes Emma. Emma, we'll be honest with you here, the moment when we opened that box is going to haunt us for years.   Creator: Devon Pacey Verdict: The only entry to come with its own speech bubble. We like the smile.   Creator: Luke Furniss Verdict: ""I hope you like my con­tri­bu­tion,"" Luke writes. But what of the spooksome tattoos, and words scribbled down her hair? ""Trouble is her best ever song so I included the lyrics, as well as some of her strongest looks,"" Luke explains. This head is a bit scary.   Creator: Kavita Masih Verdict: We like the two-pronged approach to this one. Kavita explains: ""It's bald Britney! I like to remember Britney in happier times though so that's why VMAs Britney is in here too. Originally I made a Madonna head too for the infamous snog but she popped. She is kaput."" We like this entry a lot — it's not pictured here but there is a small cocktail umbrella in the box too, which we thought showed a good attention to detail.   Creator: George Gogeniya Verdict: Came with its own blanket, and with some nice pictures of dogs stuck to the box.   Creator: Paul Simpson Verdict: Oh dear. Notes Paul in his accom­pa­ny­ing letter, and this really does sound better if you imagine it it coming from the mouth of Dr Hannibal Lecter: ""I have left a hole in the bottom so you can put your fist in it and make Britney dance around"". :( AND THE WINNER IS… THOMAS McHUGH. Congratulations Thomas — we'll be in touch.   ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202131.54/warc/CC-MAIN-20190319203912-20190319225912-00220.warc.gz
6,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/articles/an-amazing-charli-xcx-interview-slash-chat/,"Without wishing to sound too dramatic about the whole thing, Charli XCX might be the perfect modern pop entity. She sounds like a popstar, she thinks like a popstar, she looks like a popstar. She even writes like a popstar, and not the sort of popstar who turns up near the end of a writing session and throws in a couple of ‘baby’s. During the course of what follows you will hear Charli talking about various things. The punk album she recorded and ditched, the new album she’s nearly finished, the Britney song that nearly happened, and what lies ahead for pop. You will also bear witness to a trick question so dis­grace­ful that it could set back the public’s view of journ­al­ism more effect­ively than a million Leveson inquiries. There will also be talk of ‘Boom Clap’, a forth­com­ing single so amazing that we’re going to plug it at the start of the interview (PRE-ORDER ON iTUNES) as well as the end. Hello Charli! What are you doing at the moment?
I’m rehears­ing for Glastonbury, and I’ve been having a meeting. What was the meeting about?
Lots of things. Lots of things I can’t tell you. But it’s good. It’s all good shit. Was it a meeting about big important stuff, or just people banging on about social media stats and that sort of bollocks?
Oh no I don’t go to those fucking meetings, they’re stupid. It was a big important meeting about big important things that are great. Who was it with?
OH MY GOD STOP. I’m not telling you anything about it. But it’s great. Was it about your career or somebody else’s?
A bit of both! But that’s all you’re going to get out of me, so calm down. That’s a classic Charli XCX sort of meeting isn’t it — a bit of your career, a bit of somebody else’s.
Yes exactly. Do you not think other people haven’t already bene­fit­ted quite enough from your hard work?
(Laughs) Well I mean I enjoy it! I think I’ll always keep writing for other people, if that’s what you’re talking about spe­cific­ally. I have millions of songs that I’m never going to sing but someone else could sing a lot better than I could, so I’d rather give them to other people than have them sitting in my brain, festering away. You say you have millions of songs. What’s a more realistic number?
Probably about 500. Fucking hell!
Yeah! I write — since ‘I Love It’ blew up — every day. Every single day. And I’ve been in LA on and off for the past three months and sometimes I’ll do two to three sessions in a day. I feel quite creative right now. I feel like I’m kind of doing something right at the moment. And this coincides with your profile perhaps opening doors now that weren’t open a year ago, but are you going hell for leather because you’ve never hit this creative streak before, or because you’re worried it’s going to end, you’ll never hit it again and you think you’ve only got another three months before you burn out?
I’ve always been on a creative streak! My songs have always been amazing. But now it’s just like people want to listen to them because I wrote a couple of big songs. I’m excited by the people who are con­tact­ing me at the moment. I don’t think I’ll burn out — the only problem is that because I’ve been in the studio so much I haven’t done as many things. I haven’t gone out and… Well, I have partied, but not loads. So I feel like I need to do that then go back into the studio and write about it. So real­ist­ic­ally, can you go out, get com­pletely smashed and put it through as a legit­im­ate business expense?
I’d never thought about that but you’ve just given me the best idea. Life itself is a business expense when you do this kind of thing. So yes, I’ll try that. When you’re writing, do you always start off writing songs for yourself, or do you spe­cific­ally set out to write for other artists? Some writers find the latter more lib­er­at­ing because they’re not con­strained by the question of ‘would I stand on a stage and sing this’.
When I’m going into a session for an artist I’ll think about that artist, but I never write a song that I don’t think is cool. I feel like people ask me to come to sessions because they like what I do and they like my style, so I won’t then change it once I’m in the room. If I don’t think it’s cool it’s not going to end up on the record. I like having my stamp on things — I don’t just want to make generic music that’s not recog­nis­able as something that’s come from my brain. How finished is your album? Wasn’t it supposed to be out last month?
(Laughs) Well, yes. Shit changed. What shit spe­cific­ally?
Everything! I was making a punk album! I was over the music industry, I was over all of it. And I went to Sweden and made a punk album. And I think you tweeted something about “oh God it’s noise” or whatever and I was like well OBVIOUSLY you’d say that.  The track on SoundCloud was a bloody racket though to be fair. Although, yes it did have a ring of ‘here’s someone who’s a bit sick of what’s happening’.  Which is a valid artistic statement obviously but that doesn’t mean you have to release it.
(Laughs) Well yes, I mean I made a record that was like that. There were still elements of pop, but… And pop still is the general vibe. It’s [she's talking about the proper new album now] pop. I’ve made a pop record. I think it’ll be com­pletely finished by the end of July, I’m not doing any more writing sessions now. Are all the tracks on this new album fresh songs from this year?
Yes. So basically you’ve made two albums this year and it’s not even July?
Well yeah. And I still want to put out all the stuff I did in Sweden. That is going to happen at a later point. Hm…
You don’t sound very excited by that. Maybe it’s something for the anthology box set in fifteen years. 
Maybe I’ll take your advice on that, although I probably won’t. I mean I’ve probably written five albums this year, really, if you count all the songs I’ve written. But yes, it’s done. It’s def­in­itely a step away from ‘True Romance’, that’s for sure — it’s less elec­tronic, and it’s more live. And I suppose yeah it is punk, but it’s not pop-punk in an Avril Lavigne kind of way. It’s not that. But it’s awesome. I feel like every song could be a hit. Do you think about hit potential when you’re writing? Of that catalogue of 500 songs you have, how many are million-dollar megahits?
Probably only like 35. That’s not bad to be getting on with. 
For a minute it was really hard for me not to be thinking about ‘hits’. Because that was the word that was brought up in my life every day. Because once you’ve actually had a hit, people expect more. 
Yeah, after ‘I Love It’ and then ‘Fancy’ everyone was talking about HITS. ‘Keep the hits for yourself’, ‘don’t go into writing sessions because the label will be angry if you give hits away’, all that kind of thing. And after a while it all got a bit, like, ‘you know what, fuck off’. It was stupid. I’ve always done this my own way. I’ve passed up on many a thing that could have made me a big artist or something. Like I was offered a feature on a Christina Aguilera song and I turned it down. It just wasn’t right. She’s cool, but it just wasn’t right. And now I feel like I’m kind of ready to do that: I under­stand what the world is about a bit more. I’m in a very lucky position now — I feel like I’ve grown up through this so I under­stand most of the bad things about the music industry now. And I feel like there are people I can trust, and also people I can boss around very easily now, which is cool. When you say you know what the world’s about, what do you mean?
Well I mean spe­cific­ally the weird, small part of the world that I’m in. Who’s a good person, who’s a bad person, when something’s real, when I feel like I’m uncom­fort­able with something… I under­stand that a lot more now. When I was writing ‘True Romance’, even though I was in very good hands and really trusted Ariel and I love him, I was still figuring everything out. I didn’t really under­stand how vital my voice was. I think people can tell, even from the dif­fer­ence between ‘True Romance’ and ‘Fancy’ and ‘I Love It’, just how much more confident I am in my own voice. ‘Fancy’ and ‘I Love It’ feel like 100% me. What per­cent­age you was ‘True Romance’?
When I was making ‘True Romance’ I was really worried about being cool. As most 16-to-18-year-olds are. Whereas now I don’t care about being cool because now I’m cool anyway. In a really weird nerdy uncool way. I don’t care. I’m really into this record I’ve made because I feel like it’s all me. Who have you worked with on the new album?
So — the list! Weezer, Rostam from Vampire Weekend, Stargate, John Hill… I did a session with [Dr] Luke but that wasn’t for me. Who was that for?
I can’t tell you! I can’t tell you any secrets, that’s not how it works! You can guess. Katy Perry?
No. And that’s it, you only get one guess because I’m not very good at lying and you’ll break me down! But yes, there are a lot of people on the album. When I started working with Stargate I was worried because when I was growing up there was always a stigma attached to those producers and I was still in my (adopts absurd posh voice) ‘I USED TO GO TO ART RAVES!’ phase. But actually I feel very connected with those people: they really under­stand music, and they really under­stand how to get the best out of me. I really trust them. We’re writing amazing songs together and I feel like they really want my voice to come out. I never thought I’d be on their side, but I kind of am. Was it a question of con­fid­ence? Is it easier to feel you’re part of that world when you can look them eye to eye as someone who’s also had a big hit?
I guess when you have that success with a hit single people are always like ‘oh I always loved your early stuff’ but with them it felt like they knew what was up — they knew that maybe I didn’t fully get the credit I deserved for that song ['I Love It'], and they wanted me to get that credit. (Pause) Also I’m published by them which was handy. (Laughs) But I think I’ve kind of done things the long way round, and they’re like, ‘it’s your time’. And I think it’s my time now as well. I think I’ve paid my dues. And there are lot of people I want to give a ‘fuck you’ to. It’s exciting having seen you when you were 14 and all over the place, and not really seeming like the sort of person who could have hits, and then having seen it all gradually change over a pretty long period. 
Now here I am. Do you like ‘Boom Clap’?
I do. You know how sometimes people release singles because they sort of have to due to them being on a soundtrack or something, then a year or so later they go ‘this was shit all along’? Anyway I suppose the point I was leading to was to ask if it’s in any way indic­at­ive of what will be on the album.
It’s def­in­itely on the soft side, for sure. But it’s def­in­itely part of the record. Do you know who doesn’t like that record? Which I was really bummed out about because I really wanted to give it to her? HILARY DUFF. Which sucks. Some people don’t know what’s good for them.
I sent it to her, well I didn’t — Patrick Berger actually sent it to her because his first ever pro­duc­tion was a Hilary Duff album track called something like ‘Punk Rock Kiss’. Anyway we sent it over and her people were like, ‘this is NOT cool enough for Hilary’. And now I’m glad she didn’t want to take it. Maybe they were right though — in her hands it could have sounded quite uncool, whereas because you are actually inverted-commas-cool, you can get away with something uncool?
HEY. I don’t think ‘Boom Clap’ is uncool. No, but you can imagine a shiny pop person singing it and it being too much. 
Okay, I take that. Will it be a hit in the UK?
I don’t know. I have a strange rela­tion­ship with the UK, I don’t know what’s going to happen over here. My new attitude is: fuck everything. Which is the attitude I took when I was going to make that punk album. And when I was making that album I was like, I’m going to Sweden, I’m not going to talk to my record label, I’m gonna turn my phone off and I’m just going to write this album and not care about anything else. And as soon as I stopped stressing and having panic attacks about tiny minute details everything started being cool again. So I’m not worried about anything now. If things are doing good that’s great, but I don’t get worked up. Do you feel that too much power in the music industry is held by people with little to no taste in music?
I think that’s half true. What I think is that there are some people with great taste, who are at the top of their game, in the music industry. People who enjoy starting trends. But I feel like a lot of people at the top of the music industry don’t keep things moving fast enough. And I under­stand why it takes such a long time for music to translate far and wide, but I feel like we’re in an age now where things can move so fast that there isn’t a need to be listening to, say, house music any more. That’s not a diss to house music, but do you know what I mean? I feel like things get stuck on a loop and there’s so much more exciting music under­neath that might even­tu­ally come through but it just takes too long. People are too fixated on rep­lic­at­ing trends to a lesser level, know what I mean? Well that loop you mentioned — the start of that loop is always inter­est­ing. So the deep house thing was inter­est­ing, but the upshot of that is a load of chart music with no tune that misses the point. 
It’s so easy to make music now, as long as you have a computer and the desire to make music, and that’s a great thing, but there needs to be a harsher filter. Also what I’ve def­in­itely learned is that people always talk about ‘taking risks’ but nobody takes fucking risks! ‘I Love It’ was seen as a risk — now when you listen to that song, it just sounds like an EDM song. That song was con­sidered something really different… But it did sound different though, it only sounds more normal now because it was so popular. 
Right, but what I’m talking about is that there’s like, millions of artists who actually sound different. And I know it has to translate to ‘people who like Pitbull’ or whatever but I don’t feel like there are really that many bound­ar­ies. When your stuff didn’t make it onto the Britney album were you philo­soph­ical about it or were you a bit ‘oh fuck off will.i.am we’ve given you amazing stuff here’?
Well the thing is, I know this sounds like me covering my ass now, but Starsmith and I were a bit shocked that they wanted us to finish that song for the Britney album. Because we didn’t think it was amazing. It was good, but it wasn’t next level. But we finished it anyway and they were into it, but it didn’t end up on the album. I didn’t actually buy the album — maybe that makes me a bad fan but I liked ‘Perfume’ and ‘Work Bitch’ which I thought was really inter­est­ing — but I’m not mad at all. I’m down with will.i.am. I’m really into ‘Feeling Myself’ at the moment, it’s a next level song. will.i.am has about one great song a year, then four shit ones. 
I’d give him more than once a year! To be fair. I don’t know how much he plays a part in his lyrics but some of those lyrics on his songs are incred­ible, I per­son­ally think. What’s the next corner that pop’s going to turn? You’re probably in sessions with people hearing stuff that’s going to come out next spring, or next Christmas. So what’s pop going to sound like in 2015?
Maybe it’s just me but I’m hearing a lot of kind of dancehall, reggae-influ­enced songs. So that might go down. Maybe that could be something that’s going on, I don’t really know. I just go into a room and do my thing. Maybe that’s the corner it will turn! A Charli XCX corner! What’s the most ridicu­lous thing you’ve ever seen on one of those lists record labels send round when they’re looking for songs to give to artists?
The one time I actually saw one of those lists was when Lindstrøm’s manager sent it to me — because I was on it! It had ‘Charli XCX — looking for atmo­spheric tracks that could have been on the Drive soundtrack’. And I was like, ‘hold on! Who’s fucking done this?!’ I got so mad. I think it also had something really funny like ‘Crystal Castles looking for reggae songs’ or something weird. Just to recap on a couple of points, did that Britney track ever leak?
It didn’t. What was it called?
I’ll tell you what, William Orbit tweeted about it the other day so why don’t you ask him? Hit him up. Is it alright with you if he puts that song on his SoundCloud?
No. Because I don’t think it’s good, remember? I don’t want that song to be out in the world. It’s inter­est­ing that near the start of this interview you were saying you need to think a song is cool in order to give it to someone, but in this instance you were happy to let out a song you didn’t think was good. 
Er… I don’t know. I just don’t think it’s that great. But do you know a song that is great, that I wrote? The Ryn Weaver song! That’s pretty sick. Yes. She’s very cool and that song’s very good, I’m glad people are listening to that.  And what else do you have coming up?
Everything else is going on behind the scenes right now, but I’m cooking up a storm. I have a feeling that I might do something kind of magical this year. That’s how I’m feeling right now. And how has the Rihanna stuff been going?
(Stupendous pause) Fine! (Another pause) I haven’t really done anything for it, so… Yet?
No, I haven’t done anything for it. That was a dis­grace­ful trick question wasn’t it. I didn’t even have any inkling that you had or hadn't been working on Rihanna. 
I haven’t! I haven’t been working on that. And you’re not going to?
I’m actually not. And what was the meeting you were in before you picked up the phone?
Oh my God! Please! I’m going to hang up! Anything to add?
No. Anything you’d like to retract?
Yes. Anything else?
Is this bit all going to go in? Maybe.
Oh my God. Leave me alone. I’m going to hang up now. Byeee!
Goodbye. ■ 'Boom Clap' is a) amazing and b) pre-orderable now.

7,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/articles/an-interview-with-calvin-harris/,"Calvin Harris has a single out. He therefore has to speak to idiot journ­al­ists in order to promote it. Here is what happened when he spoke to Popjustice. Hello Calvin. Where are you?
I’m in my studio on [London cultural hotspot] Hornsey Road. Is this interview going to get turned into a glossy pamphlet that you’re going to sell? No. What’s happening today. Are you making some hits?
(Laughs) Today I am getting some guide vocals recorded for a song I wrote that’s for a girl, and I don’t want to sing the guide vocals because it’s a par­tic­u­larly girlie song and I’m too embar­rassed to send my version with me singing to the artist in question. You do sound girlie fairly fre­quently, though. 
Yes abso­lutely, I’ve got a falsetto tone that I like to use. I sang the demo of ‘Bounce’ and it was PHENOMENAL. I’m thinking of releasing that mix as some sort of iTunes bonus mix. Amazing.
Well I don't know about amazing — it’s certainly ‘special’. It’s a special mix. Maybe save it for the 25th anniversary anthology.
Or maybe as an album bonus track. ‘Extra content’. What’s the worst ‘extra content’ you’ve ever produced?
Me? I’m strug­gling to think of much that we’ve done. I suspect there will be some YouTube videos that I was roped into very early on. Around my first album. We did a series of YouTube videos of me just acting like a complete dickhead. But I’d been told to act like a dickhead! Showing people around my crib-in-inverted-commas when it was the Holiday Inn I was staying in. Things that were not very funny, thought of by online marketing people. Something like that. THAT’S content, but you can’t buy it. (Pause) Well you certainly couldn’t sell it. What sort of ‘content’ will be on your new album? How much is there to hear at this stage?
Well there’s not much to hear to be honest. I could give you a blast of the second single but there’s not much point in that over the phone. The album’s not coming out until next…  Next… Let’s say next year. That’s quite a long time. It felt like it would be this single then another then the album.
No. Well that would be the old favourite, wouldn’t it? The two-singles-then-the-album routine. But there are going to be at least four singles, maybe five. Or possibly there will never even be an album. We might get to five singles and think, ‘nah, fuck it’. Surely after the fifth it’ll be greatest hits o’clock, job done, thank you ladies and gentlemen: GOODNIGHT.
(Laughs) OR, like in America, they do that eight-for-eight thing. Eight tracks for eight dollars. I could do something like that. But with the exchange rate it would be, er… Eight… Four… Er, I don’t know. Six? 5.6? Pounds? Er… Does that sound good? It depends Calvin on whether the songs are any good. It would be a lot easier if the price of a download was in some way connected to how good it was.
Ah, but that’s just a matter of opinion thought isn’t it? No.
No? No. 
I always think this as well actually. I think there are some good songs and some bad songs and that’s just the way it is. Some things are good for different reasons, and some things are bad for different reasons. Maybe. I don’t think this is something you can apply to every song. Maybe with two thirds of songs you can’t say whether it’s object­ively good or object­ively bad, but the remaining third of music, well, yes you can. You cannot use the magic on everything, but that doesn’t mean it works on nothing. 
Hm. But I guess — and I’m not including you in this — most music journ­al­ists would say that their opinion holds the most gravitas when in fact a lot of them don’t know much at all. That was an incred­ible back­han­ded com­pli­ment, to say ‘and I’m not including you in this’. Superficially flat­ter­ing, but at the heart of it you are simply saying ""I do not consider you a music journ­al­ist"". Amazing. 
(Guffaws) Let’s just move on shall we. Are you impressed that you mentioned several minutes ago that you had written a song for a female artist, but weren't imme­di­ately bombarded with questions about her identity?
Yes. Well, you probably knew that I’m def­in­itely not going to tell you because she hasn’t agreed to it yet. Be that as it may, who is it?
I can't tell you.  Is it someone for your album or is it someone you’re sub­mit­ting a song to?
Oh it’s for my album, I don’t work on anyone else’s songs any more. I’ve had enough of all that.  What changed your mind on that?
I was always singing on my music to start with, but now I don’t need to song on it because, well, I’ve decided not to. So now every track I make can be a track by me featuring whoever. So there’s no need to give songs to anyone else. Before I needed an outlet for the more girlie songs that only girls could sing on, and now I don’t need to do that.  Most dance songs do sound good with a lady on. 
Girls sound good soaring over a big riff. The female voice travels better in a club. So who’s that female artist?
She’s not even heard the track yet! How about three guesses?
Sure.  CHER.
(Laughs) No. Oh. Er… Who else is there?
Hahaha, ‘if it’s not Cher who else could it possibly be’! (Laughs)  TINA TURNER.
No. More current. ELIZA DOOLITTLE.
Sadly none of those are correct so now I don’t have to tell you. By the way is your office in Islington? Yes, near it. Why?
You know you tweeted that picture of stuff you’d stuck on the wall using No More Nails? Yes.
I recog­nised the window that was outside your window! I recog­nised it. That’s someone’s flat. Sometimes he stands in the window with just his pants on. 
(Laughs) I knew that’s where it was. I used to live round the corner. Yes. Not any more though. So you’re currently Number 3 in the iTunes chart…
Am I? I thought I was Number 2. But obviously that’s the iTunes chart not the actual chart. But it’s the chart that counts. Sort of.
Yes to an extent. If you listen to com­mer­cial radio… Which we often do. Do you?
I do too. I listen to ALL RADIO. Do you listen to Radio 4?
I have done. Do you find it occa­sion­ally quite good except when it’s a) The Archers, b) a satirical news show,  or c) ‘a play’?
It’s usually a play though isn’t it. Um… My mum used to listen to it while she was doing the ironing.  To be honest I’ve not really listened to Radio 4 for a while. It’s useful to know about other stuff, though.
Some people think that’s important. It is important!
No. Because, right, well for example there’s this book called 'A Technique For Producing Ideas'  by some bloke who used to work in advert­ising and it's quite inter­est­ing if you're inter­ested in that sort of thing, and it’s a very short nook based on a talk he used to go round and give to people at colleges or wherever. And it’s about how to come up with ideas and how to make your brain work and all that sort of stuff, and part of it is cross ref­er­en­cing the matter at hand with something unrelated, and then you find the right com­bin­a­tion of the thing you know about and the thing that’s nothing to do with it, and that’s where the spark of an idea happens. So listening to someone bang on about farming on Radio 4 is actually more useful than you might think it is.
Ah, right. Oh I see.  You know the mental wobbly bit in ‘Bounce’?
Yes. Is there more of that on the album?
Maybe, but we’re talking about the album like it exists. Which it doesn’t yet. In the next two songs there’s none of that. I mean I love that bit. It was necessary to put it in so it wasn’t just a linear track. But at the same time, certain ‘people’ thought it was a little bit much for a certain time of day on some radio stations. But the whole point of its amaz­ing­ness is that it is, quite literally, ‘a bit much’!
It is! (Laughs) Imagine anyone just sitting there listening to the radio at home, or in the super­mar­ket, or working in a garage… (Laughs) Some old dear’s buying eggs then all of a sudden it’s “DRNNN!! DRNNRNNN! BRNNN!!!!” It made me laugh so I kept it in, but there is an edit with it not in, for people who are sus­cept­ible to heart attacks. Does that edit upset you?
I did it! I did it entirely through choice. That’s like ripping the heart out of the song!
No you’re com­pletely wrong. Now then Calvin we know this song better that you do, listen to what we have to say. 
(Laughs) No, it’s a funny thing to have in there and in a club it goes off, but it doesn’t work in every situation. It's very accom­mod­at­ing of you to do a non-mental edit.
I try to be accom­mod­at­ing. To start off with, five years ago or whatever, I was very precious over my songs, but it’s more important to open yourself up to the challenge of doing something that more people can get on board with. That’s a beautiful thing.
Well I’m making songs for the radio. I’m not making songs for people who look at Drowned In Sound or whatever. I’m a com­mer­cial act! That’s what we’re trying to present me as, so, you know, you’ve got to respect that. How well do you think you’re doing at present­ing yourself as a com­mer­cial act?
Not that well. (Laughs) I love being accom­mod­at­ing in the musical sense, but I’m not very good at going out or trying to get my picture taken or getting off with celebrit­ies or that kind of thing. I’m terrible at that so I’ve given up on it, and I don’t think I’m going to be a celebrity any time soon. But as far as music goes, I’d like to think of it as being an access­ible thing I do. You’ve been very polite on Twitter recently.
I have, haven’t I? Was that your idea, or someone else’s?
As I’ve spoken to more and more people about it, people who use Twitter and mostly DJs — mostly quite a bit older than myself — it’s been inter­est­ing to see their take on it, and life generally. We’re talking worldwide DJs. People who know how the world works. It might sound strange taking advice from Tiesto but he knows what he’s on about. And he was just, like, ‘look. Don’t do that’. (Roars with laughter) And, er, I went, ‘wow. Really?’. And then I thought about it, and I was like, ‘actually who does do that? All my least favourite people, that’s who. All my least favourite people go off on Twitter and cause problems with people and chat about what annoys them’. I just thought, there’s enough of all that going on in our lives as it is, we don’t need to read it going on in someone else’s. So now I just try to do positive things. It was quite good when you were waiting for something to arrive from, if memory serves, Ikea. That was Twitter gold. 
Yes, that’s all alright but when it spills over into a rant it’s not a good look, is it? And it’s not really who I am, either — it was supposed to be quite jokey but there’s no typeface for sarcasm. If there was a typeface for sarcasm what would the font be?
I don’t know. Maybe that’s why there isn’t one. Upside down? That would be ridicu­lous.
Well you can’t have italic can you. Bold? Let’s not have bold. 
Capital letters are inter­est­ing. People who write all emails in capital letters, I always wonder what’s going on there. Do you remember when Alan McGee was on Twitter? That’s where I took my lead from and, er, it lost me a lot of friends. (Laughs)  What else would you like to discuss today?
Oh I don’t know! You tell me! Come on. Is this meant to be just a chat? I thought it was supposed to be an interview! Which female artist are you writing that song for?
Oh I can’t tell you that. If they agree to it, then… Well, they haven’t even heard it yet.  Who else is on this selection of tracks that may or may not form your third album?
So far it’s Kelis, me… Er… Hm… You need to get on with that.
No seriously it’s fine, most of the tracks are done, it’s just a question of lining up the people and dropping off the sacks full of cash. How much is Kelis? Oh actually you were working with her anyway weren’t you…
I’ll tell you what, I’m getting some great remixes in because I keep promising people things. I’ve got quite a list of things I need to get back to people on as a result. It’ll be fine. It’s JUST A BIT OF FUN.  Perhaps everyone should just CALM DOWN and HAVE A LAUGH.
Well that’s what it is. Everyone just needs to fucking calm down, breathe, enjoy life. Right, get back to work. 
You too! That 'Bounce' song is out now and here it is on iTunes.

8,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/articles/an-interview-with-kylie-minogue/,"Kylie's got a new single out. It's pretty amazing. But enough pleas­ant­ries, let's have a look at some interview. What’s the point in releasing another album?
That’s a very good question — I ask myself that sometimes too. Um, I think that the inspir­a­tion for getting back in and starting this whole roller­coaster again was after the shows I did in North America. They were so from the heart and I felt so rewarded with the feeling and response from doing it. That just gave me that reminder of how amazing it can be. That helped get me back on. Touring and making new music are quite different things, though — what was it about per­form­ing that made you want to make new songs?
Well, to add to the per­form­ance. I’ve done so many rein­ter­pret­a­tions of so many songs that the idea of having something fresh put within that was tit­il­lat­ing. Just going back to your comment about the studio versus the stage, I can under­stand why people would want to stay on the road because you create your own bubble. You almost don’t live in the real world. Just to have the things that are with you is fine. Then you get home and there’s paperwork and you think, ‘oh my God, I’ve lived perfectly happy without any of that’ and you have a bit of post-tour depres­sion. And then you’ve got to do something again, so I guess, you do the album. It’s just the proven cycle. Is it dis­ap­point­ing and/or frus­trat­ing that your fanbase seems to want such a specific thing from you and reacts quite badly if they don’t get it?
It’s a fine line. I can get really ticked off sometimes when they seem to feel quite entitled. It seems that the internet — with forums and social media and so on — fuels a par­tic­u­lar type of fan enti­tle­ment…
Well abso­lutely because they can be faceless and they can say whatever they want. But even if it annoys me I can say, ‘well, at least they’re pas­sion­ate’. And that can be harnessed in a positive way more often than not, so that’s fine. So when ‘All The Lovers’ came along and the piece on the Popjustice front page described it as ‘proper Kylie’, did you think, ‘well, hang on, piss off, who’s this person to say what’s proper me and what’s not?’. Is the pos­it­iv­ity of someone going ‘this is proper Kylie’ actually quite negative and confining when maybe you’d have preferred to do something else?
Yeah I totally know what you mean — didn’t you get that package I sent in the mail? (Laughs lengthily at concept of Minogue faeces parcel). No, I under­stand it now and I didn’t quite get it with ‘X’… I knew people weren’t entirely happy, I knew there were genius moments on it and perhaps parts were a bit ahead of their time but it didn’t sit with me and my audience at that time. I just agree with you. It’s fine. What’s your favourite song on the album?
If I were to choose one to have a blast of right now I’d choose ‘Aphrodite’. ‘Aphrodite’, in many ways, being the sort of comeback tune people were hoping for, or expecting, a few years ago.
Yeah. Yes. And ret­ro­spect being the cow that it can be I now look back and realise that yeah, it would have been great then.  And it also would have been great to have songs that I’d written about that dark period in my life. And I don’t know exactly why those songs weren’t on the album but I went with what I thought was the better judgement of others and… And I now under­stand that a fan or someone who sent out positive vibes to me through­out that period would have wanted to hear something… SOMETHING about that period. Not ‘hey I saw you across the dance­floor’. Yes.
But, I dunno if I didn’t see clearly enough then, or if I didn’t have the strength to fight for what I wanted… I dunno. Well one point to remember, perhaps, is that many of the fans wailing in the streets that ‘X’ didn’t cover various topics would be exactly the same people accusing you of milking it if you had, in fact, addressed those issues in your songs. But it felt odd that there seemed to be so little emotional invest­ment.
Yeah. I get it. I suppose my response to that was at least doing a couple of those songs on the ‘X’ 2008 tour, so people at least had an idea… Also, most fans just made their own versions of ‘X’ from the demos they got online.
(Brightens up) I think they HAVE, yeah! These days you can get so much feedback from fans through Twitter and everything, and I’d love to do the anti-tour, like a two week run in Soho of all the songs that will never be on tour. The ones that fans hold really dear that I’d love to have the oppor­tun­ity to perform. This sounds like the sort of show that would please anyone per­sist­ing with the idea that ‘Impossible Princess’ is your best album.
Yes! I have no idea whether it is or isn’t but I think what resonates for that album’s fans is that you could see a little bit of my thought pattern in the lyrics that came from me. So what would we find out about you from ‘Aphrodite’?
Well I still haven’t written on this album anything about that time, because it didn’t feel like the right time. This album is more about being in a pretty happy in my moment in my life. You see happiness is all very well Kylie but it doesn’t usually make for very good pop music.
I know! But I think the lyrics def­in­itely have a… Well with ‘Put Your Hands Up’ for example, have you ever met the Nervo girls? They’re a ball of energy! I tend to go back to my favourite… Not lynchpins but you know what I mean. I do like cosmic thoughts. Do you have Kylie moments when you listen to your own music?
What does that mean? Well, a Kylie moment is when a bit in a song inspires a slightly unex­pec­ted surging emotion, and happiness but also some sadness, with a sense of being slightly close to tears for no real reason. It is a bit like Christmas.
I have that a lot! I have it a lot in the studio. Actually I’ll confess, I had a Kylie moment about twenty five minutes ago. I just saw the latest edit of the video and when it goes into that rush part after the tiny middle eight the vision and the sound made me make lots of firework noises. I’m very vocal. I’m a good audience member! If ‘Aphrodite’ turned out to be your last album, would it make a good farewell album?
I think so. I think it’s joyful. It’s like the jus of all the best bits of my musical career. And it has enough of those Kylie moments you talked about. It’s reflect­ive in some parts — and I think there’s enough to it so that it doesn’t just bang you around the head. When Stuart and I were compiling the tracklist we decided that we have plenty of bangers and that’s when we decided we needed songs like ‘Closer’ to bring it down a little. Do you think Stuart Price should be knighted or at least receive some sort of official recog­ni­tion for his quite good pop tunes?
He should at very least be on one of the plinths in Trafalgar Square. What would he do on the plinth?
If he had his time up there on a plinth he’d be geekily eloquent and he’d seduce everyone with his charm, and he’d be wearing grey socks because that’s what he does. You can take the man out of his studio but you can’t take him out of Burlington socks. A lot of producers are a bit weird aren’t they.
Fortunately he isn’t like that. He might have that studio gene but he also has another gene that com­ple­ments it — that socially capable and enter­tain­ing gene. When he told us about the album he said that instead of the usual label politics about who gets which songs on an album this one simply came down to who had the best songs. That seems like a nice idea but slightly fanciful, is it true?
(Sighs) I’m sure there was some of that that needed seeing to with Miles and Elias from Parlophone but frankly that’s their job and they can sort it out. Let the boys sort it out among them­selves.
Exactly — get on the phone, get off the phone, go and have a drink to talk about it, blah blah blah. But that’s just the technical part of it and that red tape stuff has to be done. But I think it was incred­ibly generous — and that generous spirit does come through on the album — for those other five producers to send all their stuff through to Stuart and to feel confident in his ability [to make it all work together]. I was worried. I was thinking, ‘oh my God, they’re not going to be happy, it’s not going to work, I’m trying to do something that’s impossible’, but amazingly it all came together and it all worked. I wasn’t privy to any of that tab­leth­ump­ing, although I’m sure it happened. One privilege of being ‘the talent’.
It’s more because they had me working in the studio every hour! (Chuckles) There has been some debate over whether Radio 1 were right not to imme­di­ately A-List you. Are you appro­pri­ate for Radio 1’s perceived demo­graphic?
Well of course they should play me! (Laughs) I think that single two is probably going to be more up their strasse. We did discuss this when we were talking about what the first single should be and we just kept coming back to the statement of ‘All The Lovers’. And regard­less of how it goes in the chart the impact it’s had already is the impact we dreamt of. (Pause) I heard it on Capital the other day and I was really excited. Well Capital is, of course, London’s hit music station.
More to the point I’d been in the car for an hour, I hadn’t heard it on the radio and I was starting to get tetchy. (Cackles) I stayed on Capital the whole journey. I was thrilled. Will you be releasing a barrage of duvet covers during this campaign?
(Laughs) We’re all about the music at the moment.

9,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/articles/an-interview-with-lady-gaga/," We haven't mentioned it much over the last couple of years but when all's said and done we're pretty keen on the output of Lady Gaga. In March we went to Las Vegas to interview her and we're pub­lish­ing some of our interview — 10,000 words of it, in fact — in a limited run a newspaper. (It's out this week — you can buy it at the bottom of this page.) We know that not everyone likes things made of paper, so here are some bits and bobs from the interview. 
How long should pop songs be?
URGGH!!!! I HATE that! (Pulls face) Well many would say that the perfect pop song should be three minutes and thirty seconds. And that the chorus should come in before the first minute. I, however, don’t believe that. What do you believe?
I believe the chorus def­in­itely needs to come in before the first minute, if not the first thirty seconds, or before the song even begins as in ‘Bad Romance’. But other than that the chorus should come in quite swiftly without any fuss. But I have also been playing as much as I can on this album without con­strain­ing myself too much by always having the same struc­tures. I don’t want the album to be plastic or boring. I found myself getting a bit bored with my own struc­tur­ing on the Monster Ball. There was and is a formula that I have been using that I’ve used on some songs on this album and not others. What’s your worst song?
I hate ‘Telephone’. Is that terrible to say? It’s the song I have the most difficult time listening to. Because it was offered to Britney first?
Well that’s not exactly what happened, but I don’t want to delve into that. I could delve into it if you turn that (motions to recorder) off… But ulti­mately the mix and the process of getting the pro­duc­tion finished was very stressful for me. So when I say it’s my worst song it has nothing to do with the song, just my emotional con­nec­tion to it. Okay. So which of your actual songs don’t you like? What would you listen to and think, ‘that’s pretty shit’?
What would I like, skip over? Nothing on ‘The Fame Monster’. I think that’s pretty great. ‘The Fame’? I would probably skip over ‘Money Honey’.   
In ‘Judas’, what do you mean about being beyond repent­ance?
If you were to compare me with the insti­tu­tion­al­ised idea of what a woman’s supposed to be, I’m already cooked. What’s the insti­tu­tion­al­ised idea of what a woman is supposed to be? Describe that woman.
I guess we could talk, in the Biblical sense, it’s a woman who’s sub­ser­vi­ent and someone who obeys and does not speak in a high profile way about herself or her work, and does not show any bravery without man next to her. All sorts of things. Particularly in the UK, it’s expected that all artists, not just female ones, are not exactly apo­lo­getic for what they do, but certainly that they don’t shout about their successes… In America talent is cel­eb­rated in a more carefree way. In the UK if an artist says, ‘my new single is amazing’, there’ll always be someone who says, ‘who’s she to say that? How arrogant’.
Right. I’m just not self deprec­at­ing. I’m really proud of the work and I’m proud of the song. In the video at the end I will be revealed to be Mary Magdelene but you don’t neces­sar­ily know until the end of the video. So I’m actually quite a powerful woman who means a lot to history, but during the video there’s an eyebrow up to what my position really is, what it really means and whether I’m valuable or not. There’s another song about Mary on the album, isn’t there?
Yes, ‘Bloody Mary’. I’m very fas­cin­ated by her.

Why?
Because when I was young and I went to Catholic school — an all girls school — we were told to pray to God and pray to Jesus, but I always prayed to women. I guess I always wor­shipped a more feminine force in my life and I didn’t view God as having a par­tic­u­lar gender. I always either prayed to Mother Mary or Mary Magdelene, or to my father’s sister Joanne who had died when he was a kid because I viewed her as an angel in the sky in the house of the Kingdom working alongside God. You know, watching over me. It must be so big up there. A lot of people. So I always prayed to women and that’s the thing that I look to now to make me strong in this very unique situation that is being a pop singer. I always pray to Mary and to Joanne. It’s very sad that in those [Biblical] times women were stoned for adultery or for doing inap­pro­pri­ate things. Women were always the target, so I guess I looked to my past and my faith to find bravery in myself. So on this record I thought a lot about my faith and tried to channel a lot of that into myself, and so make myself brave.

[Gaga plays ‘Bloody Mary’.]
 So the lyrics are Mary sort of talking… If you listen to the lyrics and the way the cadence goes, the way I’m actually singing, I start quite sweetly then I go into these quite demonic tones, then I come back to sweetness, and then the chorus is me ulti­mately, publicly singing, ‘I won’t cry for you, I won’t crucify the things you do, I won’t cry for you when you’re gone I’ll still be Bloody Mary’. I’ll still bleed, is what I’m trying to say. I guess I’m fas­cin­ated by her — like I said, I wor­shipped women in my religion as a young girl — and in my belief Mary was in it all along. I think she knew what was going to happen. But I also believe that she loved him, and I believe there was a moment when she cried. So she says ‘I won’t cry for you’ but in the rest of the song, in the way that it feels, it’s sad and quite… Dirgic? Is that the right word? Like a death dirge… There’s that kind of quality to it. It’s about me having to be a superstar.   
On the basis of the first single it seemed like the album would all be about sexuality and freedom, and ‘Americano’ backs that up to an extent, but of course the other side of the ‘Born This Way’ single was the religious aspect, and the religious side is the one that resonates equally through the album.
Yes. And rites of passage. Even with ‘The Edge Of Glory’ the time of death is seen as being a quite religious exper­i­ence, to a lot of people. There are a lot of things like that on the record. There are also a lot of fun things that have nothing to do with any of that. Shall we do one of those now? Where were you when you knew you wanted to write a song about that?
We were in New York. White Shadow had this crazy beat then we threw it in the computer and Fernando started making Gregorian pop chants and then I wrote it pretty quickly. I mean I wrote it in fifteen minutes! Actually all the songs on the album were written in fifteen minutes! (Laughs) It’s just the process of putting it all together takes much longer. But the lyrics and the melodies come to me very quickly, and if they don’t I usually move on. But I love that record. Sonically, lyrically, it’s very simple but it has this huge massive meaning.  He says ‘back up and turn around’. Besides it having tonnes of relation to the fact that we allow our Government to con­tinu­ally fuck us over and over again, I think it also makes fun of the plastic popstar. ‘I’m willing to do anything as long as you continue to fuck me and pay me.’ So it’s also a com­ment­ary on pop culture. How do you want people to take it? As a political song, as something about other popstars? What’s it actually about?
Take it either way, as long as you fuck me and pay me after. That’s kind of the point of the song. The point is I don’t care how you take it. What should people be calling their senators about now? What are the big issues you think need address­ing?
Right now? Yes. What are the big issues?
Full equality. They should be calling their senators about allowing people who live in this country, whose families have been here over twenty years, immig­rants being allowed to go to school or into the army. The fact that kids were being taken away from their families in Arizona in the middle of the day randomly because of what Senator McCain was a part of. All the things that are happening are anti-everything America once stood for. (Sarcastically) ‘The land of the free.’ ‘Come in, we have jobs for you, come in and be part of what we do.’ ‘We will give you work, we will help you be free’. And now we’re saying, ‘get the fuck out and give us your money because we’re broke’. I think ‘Government Hooker’ would be an amazing single, I just don’t know if it would get played on the radio at all. I mean, it’s not really a question of who’d play it and who wouldn’t, it’s whether it would get played at all. I would not be inter­ested in censoring it. But wouldn’t there be a power in the statement of going, ‘this is my new single, if your radio station isn’t playing it ask them why’? Like ‘Born This Way’ is very radio friendly, for example, so in a sense it doesn’t challenge…
You think ‘Born This Way’ is radio friendly? Yes.
(Surprised) Well thank you. Is that a surprise? Why is that a surprise?
It’s a big surprise. Only because the idea was to make it very radio friendly and to seed a lot of ideas that are not very radio friendly into it. So… It is the first Number One ever to have the words gay, lesbian, bisexual, trans­gender in one song. Ever. It’s the first one.   
What’s the point of this album as a whole?
During ‘The Fame’ and ‘The Fame Monster’ I was incess­antly probed and asked questions. Like, ‘is this the real you?’. And I never knew what to say. I never knew how to answer. I’d go into an overly-intel­li­gent explan­a­tion, or I’d have a defence mechanism where I felt I didn’t know how to answer. Perhaps because the answer was so simple. And the answer was always destined to be: I was born this way. It’s that very simple, over-arching phrase that has really set me free as an artist. It’s set me free of my insec­ur­it­ies as an artist, my insec­ur­it­ies as a person — as a human. I separate artist and human because a lot of other people separate artist and human, but on this album it’s conceived that I am fully an artist and I am fully human. And that is my destiny. It is my destiny to follow my artistic visions to their fullest. I was born this way.   
This is just a small portion of the 10,000 word interview we published in May 2011 in a one-off, limited run Lady Gaga newspaper thing. ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202450.64/warc/CC-MAIN-20190320170159-20190320192028-00062.warc.gz
10,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/articles/an-interview-with-marina-the-diamonds/,"HELLO.
Hiya! How are you?
I’m very good. I’m in a coffee shop on [happening East London’s] Curtain Road. You didn’t fall asleep again did you? EDITOR’S NOTE: Marina is referring to a phone interview mishap during the promotion of her first album when Popjustice fell asleep and was woken by the sound of Marina ringing for her phone interview. No questions had been written, chaos ensued, the interview didn’t run. No, there are some actual written-down questions this time.
Oh that’s a relief, I can never tell if it’s just a catch up chat or a real interview, so… Well this is a bit of both. You’re putting a new song online today, so hopefully you can explain what’s going on.
Yes. So what’s going on? What’s all this Electra Heart business? What’s ‘Fear & Loathing’?
Well, today I’m releasing a song called ‘Fear & Loathing’. It’s not a single, it’s just an album track. And basically Electra Heart is a story. I don’t even know if it’s going to take the form of an album yet, but it’s a really cinematic 70s Americana-type film and each part of the story comes in Part One, Part Two, Part Three. The song that’s going online today is Part One. It’s quite hard to explain because I think a lot of people will think Electra Heart is an alter ego or something but she’s not, it’s kind of basically a vehicle to portray part of the American dream, with elements of Greek tragedy and that’s all going to be coming out through the visuals. It’s hard to explain but I think you’ll see it when it all comes together. Okay. So she’s a kind of character through whom you’re telling… Some stories about yourself? Or is it all about her?
Er… Well yeah I suppose it’s my view, as someone who’s not American, of the American dream. Right.
I’m obsessed with it all. I just love the side of it that’s really vapid and hollow. And that’s kind of what I’ve really explored. The whole album is around that. Do you think that level of vapidity and hol­low­ness is something that you just find in America? You say you’re on Curtain Road now, you wouldn’t have to go far to find something pretty vapid and hollow in East London…
(Guffaws) Well it’s in all of us, isn’t it? Everyone’s vapid to a degree, just like not everyone is 100% pure and innocent or kind. Er, hello? Speak for yourself!
Oh HA HA HA — shut up! But everyone drifts through different char­ac­ters every single day, based on the context of the situation they’re in. This might sound a bit combative and it’s not meant to but do you not feel that you made this point in ‘Hollywood’ on your last album?
Yes, but I was more cel­eb­rat­ing the kitsch, glamorous element whereas with this the imagery is totally different. It’s still based on… Actually, have you seen the [UPCOMING TRACK WHOSE TITLE WE HAVE BEEN ASKED TO WITHHOLD FOR THE TIME BEING] video yet? No.
Okay, well that’s like a really 70s thing, it’s set in the desert… I just think every artist always has something at the core of them that fas­cin­ates them and inspires them. In the beginning I had exactly the same thought — “oh God, I’m still inspired by America, I don’t want to make ‘Hollywood Pt II’”. And it’s not like that. I’m just really inspired by that topic and that culture and I think I always will be. It’s kind of like how every longterm artist always has a thread running through their image, or their lyrics, and that’s mine. America. But America’s fifty states, there are so many different Americas… The Las Vegas subtext of ‘Fear & Loathing’ feels like a pretty easy target with the whole ‘vapid’ theme, and there are plenty of places in America that aren’t vapid…
No, there are, you’re right. That’s what I want to explore. I want to explore the side that has nothing to do with glamour, and that’s all about loss and failure, and that’s more apparent now with the American economy and stuff like that. But that image, that illusion we have of America really fas­cin­ates me. You’ve spent a lot of time in America so it’s been around you, but it feels funny that as a UK artist, and you’re sitting in London now, well, there’s a lot happening in the UK that’s inspir­a­tional enough. Economy, riots, Cher Lloyd at Number One… These are turbulent times.
(Laughs) I agree, it’s shocking. I mean people are going to write amazing songs about what is happening right now. Actually let’s be honest, lots of people are going to write fucking awful songs about what’s happening right now, but…
What, about the looting? There are just going to be a lot of people who decide that they’re going to try and come up with their attempt at a ‘Ghost Town’ to capture the mood of the nation.
Probably, but lyrically, well, I’m not a political person. I def­in­itely draw inspir­a­tion socially and cul­tur­ally, but I’m not someone who’s like ‘I’m for a revolu­tion’. It’s more about fantasy. How is the fantasy element present in your new project?
Well for one it’s painted as a modern day tragedy — that’s quite fant­ast­ical. It’s painted as a play, like a film. It’s about living. It’s just my nature, I’m really overly dramatic. And these songs that are going to be appearing. There’s one today, and then there’s…
The banger. Yes the banger. So this album, or col­lec­tion of songs or whatever it is, they tell a story…
Yes. So are you releasing them in order, with each song as a chapter to tell that story?
For example with ‘Fear & Loathing’ [the video] I didn’t want to just pop up going (cheesy voice) “HEY!!!! I’M BACK EVERYONE WEARING A WHITE BLONDE WIG, I’M A POPSTAR!!!!”. I wanted it to be artistic, and it’s turned out that way. So ‘Fear & Loathing’ has turned out to be the trans­ition into the anti­thesis. Like everything I’m not, that’s what I’m becoming. Hm…
The whole idea, the whole notion of pop culture and espe­cially pop music is ALL based on illusion. And por­tray­ing yourself as something more exciting than you are. And my heart is always against that. So that’s why I’m doing it. I’m SO against it that I almost have to play the part. Does that make sense to you? Sort of, but… Are you not overthink­ing it a bit?
(Laughs) People say that to me every day. Just generally! (Laughs) Can you explain again, in a short sentence, what’s going on? To make it abso­lutely clear.
Okay. Electra Heart is the anti­thesis of everything that I stand for. And the point of intro­du­cing her and building a whole concept around her is that she stands for the corrupt side of American ideology, and basically that’s the cor­rup­tion of yourself. My worst fear — that’s anyone’s worst fear — is losing myself and becoming a vacuous person. And that happens a lot when you’re very ambitious. Does that make sense a bit more? Yes.
And that’s why it’s imper­at­ive that she’s blonde. I wanted it to be really unnatural. Like, I’ve rejected everything of myself. Is this not just you finding a way to distance yourself from something you’ve made but you’re not happy with?
(Pause) Dunno! Isn’t that what ALL music is about? (Laughs) But not all popstars come along with their second album and go, ‘do you know what, I don’t like this so I’m going to invent a character to subvert it and turn it in on itself’. 
If you pin it on an alter-ego or a character it becomes cliched and it really isn’t that — I want it to be like a film, where you follow this character on a journey. So the start of the journey that you see with the first ‘Fear & Loathing’ video… You see her cutting her hair. What does this symbolise?
Change. Okay.
(Roars with laughter) Sorry, you crack me up. What?
No, it’s fine, carry on. So that rep­res­ents change… Er… Okay. But nothing more than that?
No, I suppose ques­tion­ing who you are? But the point is that most popstars come back with a new haircut when they release their new album. Like Example. He’s got a popstar haircut now, but didn’t have one before.
Yes. And popstars don’t usually come back going, ‘ooh, here’s a video of me cutting my hair in black and white’.
And that’s because they like to facil­it­ate the illusion. But I’m not inter­ested in main­tain­ing that. I’m inter­ested in decon­struct­ing it. Like with the [UPCOMING TRACK WHOSE TITLE WE HAVE BEEN ASKED TO WITHHOLD FOR THE TIME BEING] video it starts off and it’s very kind of Mulholland Drive / Paris, Texas, that kind of vibe, and I’m actually filming myself putting on the wig, but I don’t care that it’s ‘ruining the illusion’. That’s the whole point — you’re becoming something you’re not. Can’t you just do a nice pop song?
(Laughs) (Stop laughing) (Laughs again) Am I meant to answer that? Do you need to make this so com­plic­ated?
(Pause) Or is it me that’s making it too com­plic­ated by asking too many questions?
I think so. I think you’ll under­stand when you see the second video. I don’t think it’s com­plic­ated at all, actually, but maybe that’s because I’ve heard the rest of the album. Think of your favourite artists who have very specific visions. If you’d listened to just one of their songs then inter­viewed them based on that one song, you might not have under­stood the whole thing. ‘Fear & Loathing’ starts off with you singing in the first person, then by the chorus you’re singing in the third person. Who’s the ‘I’ and who’s the ‘you’?
(Laughs) Well I’m always talking to myself, in every song, that I’ll ever write, in my life. (Chortles at length) I like to say it’s about rela­tion­ships just to look a bit more normal, but it never is! (Laughs) No, but it’s def­in­itely to myself. But to clear this up — it’s not you talking to Electra Heart or anything like that.
No. Electra in my head is not like this real person. I don’t want it to be like a cringey alter-ego, because I don’t feel that it is. So is it more like Plan B and Strickland Banks?
I don’t know. I guess there are parts of it, just like with Strickland Banks… You could relate it to David Bowie I suppose. I think artists have a tendency to have different per­son­al­it­ies, or maybe everyone does I don’t know, but I think artists are maybe more vivid about how they artic­u­late different parts of them­selves. But even if you look at the first album, the way in which I wrote was very much in a storytelling manner. I think this is now a dis­til­la­tion of that, if you know what I mean. That does make sense. You know the line in ‘Fear & Loathing’ about trying to have it all but ending up with not very much at all? Could you give an example of when that has happened?
Yes. I mean, you know my per­son­al­ity I think. It just seems like people who don’t try in life, it kind of works for them. But because I wanted it so badly on my first album, and also because I’m a bigmouth and I like to say ridicu­lous things, when you don’t meet your own expect­a­tions or you don’t achieve the things you’ve said you want to achieve, you feel like a failure. And quite frankly I still am in my head, because I know where I want to go. The first album felt a bit like a second album. There was a self-con­scious­ness to it. Or maybe a self-awareness to it, but there was a quality that you rarely get on a debut album. It’s usually album two before people start respond­ing to the world’s response to them. And the first album is usually unaware of the reality of what’s to come. Like, you know how an element of self awareness is one of the things that separates us from the animals? It feels like debut albums have a more anim­al­istic feel, and you never had that. 
Er… Yeah. That didn’t make very much sense did it.
I don’t know if it’s a com­pli­ment or not but I’m going to go with ‘not’. It wasn’t meant as a criticism, but it just feels as if we have missed your innocent phase because even while you were recording your debut album you were straight into music industry hell.
There was no innocence! Actually, quite frankly, there WAS. Because I wrote, for example, ‘Hollywood’ a year and a half before I was signed. And it’s funny actually because people will always try and pick holes in things like that. When it was a single ‘bloggers’ were going “oh she’s sold out”, and I was like, “what are you going on about? I wrote that on a £200 keyboard two years ago”. So I think I had an innocent phase but maybe I’m just the sort of person who feels like people are watching. Well people ARE watching. 
Yes. Good! The idea of trying to have it all seems relevant to [UPCOMING TRACK WHOSE TITLE WE HAVE BEEN ASKED TO WITHHOLD FOR THE TIME BEING], because it’s very much a Marina song in lots of ways but in other ways it sounds a lot like a 2011-era hit single. 
Yes I think it does and it’s not something I’ve done before. If this was a year ago I don’t mind saying now that I would have been, like, “no way am I doing this”. I was not even up for working with anyone. This is why these two songs fit really well together actually, because ‘Fear & Loathing’ is about genuinely not feeling bitter or crazy or jealous any more (nervous laugh) and actually feeling a lot better off for it. And so I’ve been working with a lot of other people. I’ve been working with Dr Luke, Stargate, and I’ve learned SO much. And I’ve done an album — well, it’s nearly done — that’s so exciting and feels like a real album. I just think, if I’d sat in my bedroom and carried on as I was because I thought that equalled cred­ib­il­ity, I don’t think I would have produced a good album. With Stargate the pro­duc­tion is the anti­thesis of everything I’ve done so far, but I think you have to try [line breaks up]. And I really like the song now. I’ve really grown into it! So you didn’t like it to start with?
No, I did… But we ori­gin­ally composed it to this sort of guitar dance track. Then on the last night of working with them someone from Amsterdam sent in an instru­mental to a different girl that didn’t work. And then Tor [from Stargate] was like, ‘oh my God, what if we turn put it under­neath that track’, and I was like, ‘hm…’, and then we did it and it sounded amazing. And I really wanted to go with it. This is like the only time I would have released that song, I think. End of the summer… Before I have an album out. It’s not the sort of song that would be the lead single for an album. What do you think your fans are going to make of it?
I think some people will hate it and some people are going to love it. Some of your moaning fans are going to go fucking mental!
Probs! But writing to your fanbase is the worst thing you can do, so I’m never going to do that.

But in terms of your vocals, and the melodies, and the lyrics, it’s com­pletely Marina. 
Yes! Of course it is. But it’s not like you’ve just gone in, idiot-style, and gone ‘oh I’ll just sing any old rubbish over a generic Dr Luke backing track’.
(Laughs) No. And also, my stuff gets remixed to oblivion, so I was like, why DON’T I do a dance song? (Laughs) And ALSO, with ‘Fear & Loathing’ , the song­writ­ing structure is so up and down and all over the place that it’s really nice to just write a nice stream­lined song for a change. Well that’s the good thing, it’s just a love song…
(Laughs) It might sound like that but really I’m just talking to myself, ha ha ha! No, not really. Is there anything else you’d like to explain today?
No, I don’t think so. Except ‘Fear & Loathing Part Two’ is coming next Monday. Right, and that’s [UPCOMING TRACK WHOSE TITLE WE HAVE BEEN ASKED TO WITHHOLD FOR THE TIME BEING]?
Yes, with the video. It’s going to be the two videos together that are going to be on iTunes, and [UPCOMING TRACK WHOSE TITLE WE HAVE BEEN ASKED TO WITHHOLD FOR THE TIME BEING] you can buy on September 26. Yeah alright ‘plugging’, do you want to read out the iTunes URL while you’re at it?
(Guffaws) Okay. So I don’t think there’s anything else. I don’t know when Part Three will come. A while later. Maybe at the end of the year.  So it’s not leading into an album? How modern.
No. But it might be, you never know. Well this certainly clears things up, and in some ways makes them more com­plic­ated.
I wonder if this interview will get shelved like the last one? Hopefully it’ll go up this afternoon.
What a bitch though, I was so upset that the last one was shelved. I thought it was my moment to shine. No — in the bin. Didn’t it go up in the end?
No! Unless you put it on, like, shitweb.com.  We should use shitweb.com as a repos­it­ory for all our rubbish we don’t use. Crap Popjustice inter­views and crap Marina demos. 
OH YES THAT’S AMAZING. Okay, well, that’s it.  Nice to have you back. 
Thanks! ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202450.64/warc/CC-MAIN-20190320170159-20190320192159-00091.warc.gz
11,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/articles/an-interview-with-nicola-roberts/,"Hello Nicola. Where are you?
I’m in the office. It’s like a madhouse here. Are you in your own office?
No. (Not beating around the bush) So which of my songs did you hear? ‘Yo-Yo’, ‘Beat Of My Drum’, ‘I’, ‘Lucky Day’, ‘Sticks & Stones’, ‘Take A Bite’…
And what do you think? Well it’s a relief that it’s not awful because that would make this con­ver­sa­tion quite awkward.
That’s good. It’s inter­est­ing sounding.
Which ones do you like more than others? I’m not sure yet. Songs like ‘I’ and ‘Take A Bite’ are obviously not singles, but seem like they’ll be really important to the album… ‘Beat Of My Drum’ and ‘Yo-Yo’ seem like singles. In terms of defining the album and making sense of you to people who haven’t got you before, ‘Take A Bite’ is probably the pick of that lot. In that it probably explains things you haven’t been able to say before.
It was def­in­itely important for me to have those songs on the album. On other people’s records when there were songs like that I always thought, ‘I’d love to write a song like that’. That’s very true of ‘I’. ‘Sticks & Stones’ is… This situation is very personal to me, really. Joseph, from Metronomy, who I wrote it with, says the same — he’s really proud of the song. After this many years of making a certain sort of pop music in a certain sort of way, it must have been inter­est­ing to approach songs in an ‘anti-hit’ sort of way. In that a lot of the time pop groups’ album tracks are songs that simply weren’t good enough to be singles, whereas it sounds like you’ve delib­er­ately approached some of these songs as if they’re not ever meant to be singles.
Yes. And it’s a shame that a lot of people are making music because of how com­mer­cial it’s going to be for them. There are a lot of people like that but there are a lot of people who aren’t. I think if it was all the former then there would be no good music in the world. Well the aim surely is to be pop and art at the same time?
Exactly. And it’s not easy, which is why people don’t try it all the time and achieve it even more rarely, but that has to be the aim, surely?  Obviously with the high standards of the Girls Aloud back catalogue you’ve been involved with more than your fair share of that over the last nine years, but it sounds like you’re trying to do it in a different way for your own album.
Coming from working with Brian [Higgins], who works in a very specific and different way to a lot of people, and then going in to work with people who work in a very normal way, I was so thankful that I’d had the chance to work at Brian’s. It just taught me to look at music in a whole new per­spect­ive. The idea was that you could always put in a little bit more work. I mean school is too hard a word, but it did feel like I was at a music school. I learned so much. I’ve done some songs with Invisible Men and Jon Shave, who’s now part of Invisible Men, used to be part of Xenomania and wrote ‘The Show’ and other songs. And he said to me that out of all the different girls and people who went in and worked with Invisible Men, he can tell I’ve been at Brian’s. And once he said it I realised how easy it was to tell that he'd been at Brian’s too. It’s a very specific dis­cip­line… Is that a bit like the bond that disaster survivors have with each other?
Well (laughs) there’s a definite bond there, yes… Was the exper­i­ence of recording Girls Aloud’s music really so different?
Well… I mean sometimes Brian would let me write a little bit and a couple of songs I wrote over the years did make it onto the records but that was literally the topline — sing it down and away it goes. It was never the amount of involve­ment that I’ve been able to have with this. If I could get away with mixing this record myself I would do because I’ve caused DRAMAS with the mixing. With every last detail. Brian very much has control over the whole record when you’re down at Xenomania and to be able to have as much control as I’ve had with this, well, I couldn’t have done it at Xenomania. It seems that certain artists went down to Xenomania and sur­rendered certain aspects of what they con­sidered made them ‘artists’, but the rewards for that was that they got an unusual and amazing record at the end of it. But what came with that tradeoff was that they didn’t feel the same emotional con­nec­tion to their own music.
No there’s not really too much emotional con­nec­tion but I think that’s a given when you’ve got five girls involved. Essentially there had to be a head guy and Brian was our head guy. We wrote little bits with Brian — and with Miranda [Cooper] closely — and they always took bits from us, and he fed off us which is how we got our sound, which we were more than happy with. What Xenomania could do working together was incred­ible and we never would have got that with anybody else. This feeling that you have now — is it a feeling that you always knew artists had but felt wasn’t an option for you, or is it a feeling you’re surprised exists?
To be honest. I was more than happy, really happy, being in the band and making records with the band, and I can’t wait to get back with the band and make another record. I really do really look forward to that. But it’s still so bizarre that I have my own record. I feel like I’ve been in a bubble, recording the whole thing, and only now is it, like, ‘God, people have got to actually hear this’. Now it’s going out there for other people to hear.  That’s kind of the deal isn’t it, with the whole ‘being a popstar’ thing.
And I’ve got to front it! That must shit you up. Not even because it’s just you rather than five people, but because if you’re singing someone else’s songs and people don’t like them and say they’re awful — or even if you don’t like them — then you can go, ‘it’s not me, it’s not my fault’. Whereas if someone listens to ‘Take A Bite’ and says, ‘that’s crap’, it’s just you.
Everything from the way I’m singing to what I’m singing about to the reason Dimitri has put that beat where it is, to the reason the snap is harder on the beat in the mix… The harsh, raw reality of comping your own vocals — let me tell you that keeps your feet firmly on the ground, it’s quite horrific. And listening to things that don’t sound right, and things that don’t work, and things that do work. Then sitting with Dimitri and saying, ‘this bit louder’, and to have the oppor­tun­ity not just vocally but musically too, it’s just been the most incred­ible journey. So yeah, every last little drop of this record is my fault. (Laughs) But similarly if someone says ‘this is a great pop record with good tunes and I’ve just found out some inter­est­ing stuff about someone who’s been in front of me for ten years but I haven’t really listened to properly before’, then you can say, ‘thank you very much’.
It’s hard isn’t it. It’s a little bit like, even down to clothes, someone can’t put me in something if I don’t feel like myself in it. It’s the same with songs. There’s not a song on the album that I think, ‘that’s not really me’. Describe the street you grew up on.
I grew up on an estate called Halton Brook. Which is mentioned in one of your songs…
Yes it’s in ‘Bite Me’. I lived at The Tithings. It was this little… Well, first of all I was born in Stamford. My dad was in the RAF so I was born in the RAF camp. And I lived there for a little while. Then we moved back up to Liverpool, we lived in Runcorn. When I think about it I smile a little bit. Why’s that?
Well, it was a properly tough area, but I was happy there. We moved off the estate when I was about ten to a different part of the town which wasn’t an estate. It was a road! It wasn’t great, but it wasn’t anywhere near what Halton Brook was like. I remember hating it. On the estate I used to hang around with the lads, go on bike rides, make dens… All my little lad mates and me, we’d hang around the shops…  But then we moved to this road and we were there for six years, and then I was in the band. And that was when you were seventeen…
Well the auditions in the summer were when I was sixteen. And I moved to London when I was seventeen. What is it that makes someone go and audition for that sort of thing? What separates someone who would hate being on stage from someone who would love it?
I just wanted to sing. I’d been singing since I was eleven. I loved the reaction I got when I sang. What was the reaction?
It was always a good one. Well yes, but…
I used to win all the little singing com­pet­i­tions. I just loved singing in general. When I was young and we used to go round to see my auntie and uncle, before I even got to the door they could hear me singing and I’d hear them shout, ‘here’s Cilla’. It’s all about the feeling. A feeling you get, I can’t explain it really. Can you try to explain it?
Okay. When I was little, if i was feeling sad or something, I would go into the garden, and I would sing words out. I’d make a song up in my head and I’d sing the words out. And then I’d cry. It’s weird. Don’t ask me why because I don’t know why. But the passion that I had for singing used to make me cry. I’d do it when I was on my own. And for a long time I joined the two up, so when people would ask me, when I was ten or eleven, to sing for them, I’d sing the song then start crying. You’d burst into tears?
I’d just be singing and tears could come out. Oh dear.
It’s not like I was singing anything par­tic­u­larly sad, it’s just that the emotion was so strong that it made me cry every time I sang. I had to really get out of that, and push that to one side, because you can’t have that every time you open your mouth! And I’d con­cen­trate so much on what people thought of me that I didn’t even have the thought to smile. I just wanted to sing. It’s as simple as that. I wanted to sing. Nothing destroys the love of singing quite like having to do it for a living, and the baggage that comes with it. Is the emotion you feel as special for you now as it was when you were ten?
It went away for a while. I had it when we did Popstars: The Rivals. I used to <love> the live shows.  Then we got in the band and singing kind of dwindled a little bit. But now I feel like I’ve found that feeling that I had back then. I’ve found the feeling again, but I’ve found it and more. I feel like I dis­covered the singing again. Wasn’t it there all along though?
It was there all along, it just went to sleep for a little while. There’s a lot of chat in your new songs about being bullied by the media, or by people on mes­sage­boards… I’m wondering what exper­i­ences you had of that before you became a popstar. Was it when you became a popstar that these things became issues?
It was never an issue before. I mean I had loads of friends at school, I loved my hair… I mean I hated being pale but I was never taunted for it. I was so proud of this red hair I had. Even if anyone did say anything about it, it wouldn’t register because I loved it so much. A lot of people think ginger hair is a problem but when you’ve got it it’s not an issue at all. It’s other people who think it’s weird. It’s odd isn’t it that you managed to get through school without it really being a problem. Because if there’s something — anything — schoolkids can pick up on, they will. 
I loved it, my friends loved it… Like at school I was called Ginge. Cheryl calls me Ginge. I’ve always loved it so much. How can someone take the piss out of something you love so much? Do you know what, when it came to the media or whatever even the ginger thing never really bothered me, it was the ugly thing. The facial thing. If you like something you can’t be hurt by it, I guess, but if someone goes at you for the way you look and there’s nothing you can do about it, that’s when it gets a bit more difficult. We spoke at the end of 2009 for an ‘end of the decade’ piece in The Observer. I asked you what your least favourite year of the decade had been, and you said ‘between 2003 and 2007’. 
I remember, yes. It struck me as being quite sad really. You’d had half a decade of shit.
Yeah. Well I had a lot of stuff in the band but there were things going on at home that were very uncom­fort­able and I had a whole period of time where I felt like I was under a cloud. But that’s fine — it’s over with now. It’s not something that I have to remember. I’m over it now and I’m happy and I’ve moved on and it’s good. Life’s a lot easier. Apart from making this bloody record! So let’s talk about subject matter… ‘Take A Bite’, ‘I’, ‘Sticks & Stones’.… They don’t cover the same ground but they all come from a similar place. And it feels like that place is what happens when someone who’s been shouted at for ten years and hasn’t been able to answer back suddenly gets a voice. It feels like there’s anger there and spite… Not spite. Spirit I guess. But what else do we find out about Nicola Roberts on this album?
Gosh, what do we find out? I just went for the truth to me. It was exciting that you brought up the ‘rude ginger bitch’ line in ‘Take A Bite’.
[Laughs]
 When you wore that skirt and it was all a bit wonky because ‘bothered’ was spelt wrong… Well it seems like the Nicola Roberts who’s been myth­o­lo­gised by pop fans for the last nine years, was born at that moment. 
Really? It’s great that you’re ref­er­en­cing that bit of your past. 
That’s because I was working with Jon Shave on that track. We were talking about Old Nicola, stories that would go on in the [Xenomania] living room. ‘Sarah said this, then you shouted out that…’ There’s another song I did with him called ‘Say It Out Loud’. I’m singing on it like Little Nicola and only Jon could have brought that out, because that’s where that came from. I felt like Brian made me sing so quietly all the time… Why was that, did he feel that that was your role in the band?
Yeah and I think he just preferred that tone. But I didn’t want a whole record full of that! Through the whole record I insisted, ‘I’m not singing in a quiet voice’. When I saw Jon he was like, ‘let’s bring it back for one song’. I was singing out, singing out, singing out. But Jon wanted to do a track with Little Nicola again. In the same way that gamma rays turn Bruce Banner into the Incredible Hulk, what was the flash­point that turned Little Nicola into Big Nicola? What was the thing that made you somehow able to cope with the ridicu­lous job you had and all the shit that came with it?
Erm… I think it was only a couple of years ago. These days, well, I’m one of those people who, like, I dream about things but I’m very firmly in reality. I look at things with both eyes open. Is it hard to be so cool, Nicola?
Is it what? Hard, to be so cool.
Er, am I cool? Well that’s the idea isn’t it. ‘Ooh, cool Nicola Roberts with her cool things that she does and and her hair and…’ er…
Well that’s a com­pli­ment I suppose, is it? I don’t know. In one sense saying ‘Nicola — she’s the coolest member of Girls Aloud’ might not really be the biggest com­pli­ment of all time. WHO KNOWS. But appar­ently you’re ‘Cool Aloud’. You’ve worked with Metronomy! You are therefore cool. 
Cool with a capital K! NO.
Oh. It’s a fine line between being cool and kool. And that fine line separates being actually cool and being not actually cool.
Are you saying I’m on that line? You are treading that line with non­chal­ant ease but you need to be careful. 
Why be careful? You can look amazing, but you can take it too far and end up looking like a clown. 
Like what? Well Lady Gaga can wear things that other people can’t. Actually even Lady Gaga can’t wear some of the stuff Lady Gaga wears. 
Lady Gaga might argue for example that you’re not open minded enough to take her. Everybody should spread their wings. Push the bound­ar­ies! Be open minded! That kind of stuff. But I would not like to wear the meat dress. I think it’s important that you stay true to yourself and you can’t sacrifice that by catering for what you think people want. There are too many people in the world for that and everyone’s got different ideas of what they’re like, and blah blah blah, so maybe the best thing to do is be as true to yourself and your own idea of what’s cool and what stretches your ima­gin­a­tion and then hopefully people find con­fid­ence in the fact that you find con­fid­ence in it. It’s nice to say, ‘ooh, everyone’s opinion is valid’ and so on, but you only have to look at the nether regions of The Internet to see a whole world of people whose opinions are, quite object­ively, wrong. 
People are generally wrong, is that what you’re saying? Yes. Fortunately you and I are in the minority of people who are right. 
(Laughs) Well that is your opinion, but they would argue that they’re not wrong. But that’s because they’re wrong! Of course they’re going to argue that they’re right — they’re always wrong! Their arguing about being right actually PROVES their wrongness! 
Nobody likes a know-it-all, Peter. Thing is, though, look at how many downloads you’ve sold of your single. I have no idea how many that is — let’s say 50,000. There are 62,000,000 people in this country. That’s a lot of wrongness isn’t it.
But that’s their good, hard-earned money! Well it’s only 79p.
But I for example don’t buy every song I hear on the radio or that’s in the charts. I just buy a couple that I like or feel I need in my life. What was the last one your bought?
I bought the LMFAO single. That doesn’t sit alongside cool-east-London-Metronomy-col­lab­or­at­ing-Nicola-Roberts, but that of course is why you are such a complex and fas­cin­at­ing person Nicola.
Well I am NOT just about that ‘cool’ thing — well, I don’t live in east London and I only worked with Joseph because I’m a fan of his not because he’s in the ‘cool’ bracket — and if you think about it I do actually like fun stuff which some people might argue is not cool. So therefore, I must not be that cool. Music snobs really annoy me. Some people — and I’ve been guilty of this — are quite the opposite, and that’s just as bad. You’ll be defending sup­posedly uncool stuff so much that you become blind to the fact that some of it is pretty rubbish. There always has to be a grasp of whether something’s good or not, and that judgement has to exist inde­pend­ently of other things like cool or cred­ib­il­ity or whatever.
Yes. There’s good pop, there’s bad pop, there’s good R&B, there’s… Well, there’s shocking R&B. It’s like with anything: there’s a good haircut, there’s a bad haircut. Genres shouldn’t be dis­crim­in­ated against but you have to accept that every genre has bad sides to it. It’s time for the killer question that I tried to ask you in the Twitter chat you did a couple of months ago, which you ignored.
What was it? To save a dog’s life, would you rim David Cameron?
I actually asked someone what that meant at the time, and they told me. And therefore I am not even enter­tain­ing the question. There’s a dog’s life at stake but don’t worry.
I’m not worrying! Where did ‘Beat Of My Drum’ come from?
Well, we found a piece of music and wrote the song around it and then created this song. We felt like we needed addi­tional pro­duc­tion and that’s where Diplo came in. How did Diplo get involved? You don’t phone him up and go ‘oh hai I’m Nicola from Girls Aloud, can you produce my single please’. 
Well, I was a big fan of Major Lazer and a lot of the MIA stuff, and I knew that my song needed some kind of backbone… We were in the studio for like four days trying to come up with the right mad sounds but I was so close to the song that I couldn’t step away from it. If there was one person to do it, it had to be him. I could hear what I wanted for the track and I knew that he could do it. So I asked him if he’d have a look at it for me. I rang him and it was 9am in LA. He was like [croaky LA voice] “hello…”. Amazing. It’s the same with the makeup range — there’s always a way around things. Just ask. I drive people mad. Was it Diplo or nothing? Was there a Plan B for the song?
If he’d said no I probably would have had somebody look at it. What’s the song about?
It’s a bit like a story. For a long time it was called ‘Baby In The Corner’. I never saw it as a single actually, I always thought of it as an album track. We had the first chorus, the melody and all of that, and I lyriced the chorus and then that led me to the verses. I thought ‘Yo-Yo’ was the first single, but taking a step back and looking at it with a wider eye ‘Beat Of My Drum’ seemed liked the one to go with first. What do we find out from the album about your views on love and romance? What have you chosen to tell us?
I’ve actually found out that I don’t talk about it too easily. It’s easier for me to write a song about life than it is to write about love. I don’t know why, it just is. I think because when you’re with a producer… I’m more than fine with talking about life, but opening your heart up about love and romance is a little bit more awkward. So I don’t know about what you’ll learn about me, but what I’ve learned that it’s not easy to write a song about. One of those solo popstar cliches is to start going on about ‘song­writ­ing is like therapy’…
I don’t need therapy because I give therapy to myself. I feel like I know myself so well that I haven’t really found out anything about myself. It’s not like I wrote ‘I’ then thought, ‘oh God, this is what I’m all about I’m so shocked’. It’s not a shock to me. There’s a line in one of the new songs about you having refused therapy.
Yes. I as like, ‘I can do this myself, I can put this into per­spect­ive in my own head, I just need the time to do it’. I just felt, I don’t need someone to tell me how to process it all. And I certainly don’t need someone to tell me what something is. Because I know what it is. I know the ins and out of this situation, I just have to deal with it. And nobody else can tell me it’s something it’s not. At what stage was this suggested?
When I was very young still. But even then, nobody can tell you… They just can’t. You have to do it yourself. You have to find a route or a solution that’s going to make you feel better. And I can do that. I can do that in a better way than if it was someone charging me £300 a week to do it. I think anyone who’s been in a hard sort of situation will say the same thing — you have to find a way out of it. You start looking into why people say things. And you think, ‘well, they’re saying stuff because it’s what they actually think’. Or because they’re jealous, or because they’re nasty… I always know why. In every situation. I’ve trained my mind to read into why someone does or says something. So now, I analyse everything. I analyse people to make sure I know if they can be trusted or not. I read people very clearly. I analyse why people do things. And it’s probably all to do with pro­tect­ing myself. So I’m quite a bleak person in that respect. We’ve been talking for an hour now.
I feel like this has been a therapy session! (Pause)  Do you think it’s going to be alright? Do you think I’ve got half a chance or not? I’m really taking a leap here, aren’t I… It feels like you’ve  got more of a chance, in a way, than someone who might have been a supposed ‘dead cert’. There feels like an outsider spirit to it, maybe not following a ‘popstar goes solo’ pattern too much. 
Okay. Well we’ll know soon, based on whether I’m still living in the country or whether I’ve emigrated. You can pre-order Nicola's album at Amazon here. You pre­sum­ably already have the single , right? Right.  ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202131.54/warc/CC-MAIN-20190319203912-20190319225912-00361.warc.gz
12,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/articles/an-interview-with-robbie-williams/,"So the Strictly per­form­ance with Gary was a bit of a moment.
It was good, weren’t it?  You sound surprised that it was good. Is it a surprise for you when things go right?
Um… No, but there was just a lot of warmth from the audience to be honest with you and, you know, rarely do you come off from doing a bit of promo where you feel like you’ve just done an hour and a half gig. There was something special about it. Came off, felt good. Felt like my old self again. It was cool.  There was a point, just while the music was starting, and you were looking out to the crowd and there was a bit of a look in your eye. And you often have that look in your eye at moments like that. It looks a bit like panic. Was it?
Yes. Panic. We did it twice – I’d forgotten the words the first time.  Oh dear. Again?
I had actually got 90% of them right. But you know, people just remember that 10% don’t they. ‘You kill one person’…
Well yes. ‘You stick your dick in one arse, you’re gay.’ So you’re right, you spotted it. It was panic. Did you see Joe McElderry doing 'No Regrets' on The X Factor last year?
I can’t remember. Basically it was amazing. What is the Toys R Us line in ‘Shame’ about? 
It was in another song that I'd written to be honest with you and I just thought it was a good line. The song was about a girl I was in love with when I was 16 and — sliding doors moment — your life changes and you go down different paths and she became who she became and I became who I became. The line in the other song was about somebody spraying ‘knobhead’ on my poster in the back of Toys R Us. I lost the song, can’t find it anywhere. But when me and Gaz came to light, it was lodged in my sub­con­scious somewhere and I thought it was a good line so I put it in. It is a good line. 
Thank you. I enjoyed singing it, I think it’s a good line. The Robbie, Gary and Take That story has been going for twenty years but now you’re back with Take That it seems that there’s almost nowhere left for the story to go. You know how Only Fools And Horses was built around the idea that ‘this time next year we’ll be mil­lion­aires’, and they did become mil­lion­aires and it just didn’t work? [With hindsight a better example of this is when Roseanne won the Lottery but you get the point]
Well. If it wasn’t for the boys, I would probably be doing nothing because I quite enjoy doing nothing now. It does feel like the end of one of the last chapters in the book and I do feel a bit spent to be honest with you. I’m loving what’s to come, obviously, and I’m very excited being back with the boys, our album sounds amazing, I’m excited to do the tour and all that business… But I’m kind of still at a loose end figuring out what I want to do when I grow up. The idea that you’re talking about the final chapter of the book and feeling spent seems like you might be heading towards some kind of last last hurrah.
Just like Cher.  A bit like Cher, yes. Listening through your greatest hits album obviously throws up a lot of the stages that you’ve been through but it also seems to conjure memories of how you’ve been received by others – it felt like at the start everyone wanted you to succeed, and you  did, and it was briefly amazing, but that a lot of the last ten years have been about people wanted you, almost willing you to fail.
That’s always been the case, that’s always been the case. It’s always been the case for me anyway.  Possibly, but it feels more acute now, it’s feels like the process has accel­er­ated now. Being a pop music fan, or a supposed fan, seems now to have become a blood sport in which small but sig­ni­fic­antly large groups of people, seem to hound artists down until they're just left there in a bloody pulp. And with you, par­tic­u­larly, people are far more inter­ested in you when you’re failing.
It’s been sped up with the advent of the internet and with news­pa­pers going from having celebrit­ies on page 7 thing having the celebrity thing [on the front page]. I think since com­mu­nic­a­tion have sped up, there have been a lot more avenues for people to be negative. You know, I don’t know whether to stay on the merry-go-round to wait for it to come back [to how it was before] or just pop off and go home.  But what do you feel that you need to do? It sounds like you feel like you don’t need to do anything at the moment. But the best pop stars have an urge to do something. Do you have an urge anymore?
Not at all, you know. Not at all. There is no… There’s no real burning or drive or ambition. You know, I’ll probably be a leap year artist from now on.  Some of ‘Reality Killed The Video Star’ was good, but as an entire album it did feel there was a kind of lack of attention. Perhaps from you or perhaps from the people around you, but mainly from you. Rudebox clearly felt like you had a thing that you wanted to do and you were desperate to it and excited about doing it. That urge again. But then when they heard it, obviously, everyone went ‘this is shit, fuck off’. So is that why with your last album it felt a bit like going through the motions?
Well it kind of was going through the motions, because as you know I was all hyped up about doing Rubebox and going down that road and then everybody went, “no”. But I didn’t want to do another ‘Come Undone’, or another ‘Angels’, or another ‘Road To Mandalay’ — you do find yourself sort of in the boggy marsh of then thinking ‘well I don’t quite fancy doing that any more’. And because everyone had gone, ‘no’, I went, ‘well, ok, I can’t be arsed either’. And you know, I did find myself capit­u­lat­ing and going, ‘well do they want THIS then’.  It’s like this idea of knowing your audience – and knowing that my audience didn’t like ‘Rudebox’ left me thinking, ‘well, er, I don’t know what to do now’. Some people really liked ‘Rudebox’. It was a Popjustice favourite.
I got a lot of people saying, ‘oh, it was crit­ic­ally and com­mer­cially a flop’, but crit­ic­ally I got more sort of thumbs up than I ever did for any other of my albums. So it’s  all a bit confusing. The best bit of the ‘Rudebox’ album is the ‘The 80s’ and ‘The 90s’ sequence at the end. If you were to expand it to a trilogy, what would ‘The 00s’ be about?
I don’t know, I'd have to sit down and map it out. The 2000s? It’s hard to know. I don’t think we know what the 2000s was or is — we only found out about the 80s when we left it. The 90s did its thing but it compared with the 80s it was a bit of a whimper. The decade we’ve just been through I think is a diluted version of the 90s. Or maybe I’m just getting older? I think the 80s were a lot of fun. I think that even though people were taking them­selves very seriously, they did it with a sense of whimsy and brashness and a sense of being alive. These days everyone takes them­selves seriously and they have to kind of dilute them­selves into a corner cos they kind of listen to too many albums, read too many magazines are basically painting by numbers. Did you watch the new A-Team film? No.
I watched it on the plane coming over the other night. And?
It kind of, erm, nearly there but not quite. ‘Nearly there but not quite’ is a bit like saying ‘I got 90% of my lyrics right’.
Yes. It’s always going to be that other 10%.  There follows a sequence in which Robbie makes the quite unsubtle decision to start inter­view­ing Popjustice about ‘life in general’. Since the sub­sequent chat, pleasant as it was, is clearly of little interest to The Internet, we’ve taken it out, but by the end of it we’ve got onto the topic of what Robbie describes as ‘a golden moment’ – that time in life when everything’s amazing and you’re firing on all cylinders and going out a lot and basically having an amazing time, or at least you think you are until later on when you calm down a bit and get a better idea of what it’s all about. From what we can make out Robbie seems to identify his golden moment as being at about the age of twenty. And then we say something like…  …and you only really calmed down about three years ago, when you were 33…
33 wasn’t a golden moment. When you’re 20, you don’t know that you medicate yourself. By the time you’re 33, if you relapse into some of that same old behaviour, it isn’t a golden moment. It’s just fucking illness.  Are you still ill?
No, not right now, no, I’m on good form. I’m an older guy. I feel healthy, I’ve been training, I’m looking after myself, I get up early. I look after the dogs. I’m happy. ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202450.64/warc/CC-MAIN-20190320170159-20190320192159-00337.warc.gz
13,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/articles/an-interview-with-tove-lo/124165/,"Tove Lo is one of Popjustice's favourite new pop people. As a vocalist she hints at euphoria and mel­an­choly in equal measure, as an artist she delivers a winning com­bin­a­tion of ambition, passion and proper pop magnetism, and as a song­writer she's achieved the not incon­sid­er­able feat of being picked to work with both Xenomania and Max Martin. Best of all, she has big tunes. Tove recently signed to Polydor and her debut EP, 'Truth Serum', is out in April. It's brilliant. Really very brilliant indeed. We had a chat with her recently, and here's what happened. Hello Tove. On your Facebook page you describe your music as ‘Dirrrrty POP!’. Can you explain what that means?
Well for me it means that it’s raw, not filtered, and I suppose the vocals are about meaning what you sing, and not being afraid to show your bad side. Showing your bad side is inter­est­ing. Because a lot of artists when they’re writing about love and life do so from the per­spect­ive of someone who’s been wronged by the other person. But in your songs there’s a feeling of “I’m an idiot as well”.
Yes. I guess I have a harder time saying that to a person in real life, but in my music I can say: “I fucked up, I’m sorry.” My songs are an oppor­tun­ity to be honest. I take that to deal with my own issues. There are a lot of ways to blame other people, but it’s always two people in a rela­tion­ship. I get sick of hearing people going “oh, he or she was such an asshole to me, he cheated on me sixty times”, and you’re like, “well why did you stay?”. The answer is always: “Because I love him.” And, you know, if you love a broken person you’re going to get hurt. Have you ever set fire to anything you shouldn’t have?
Yes I have, actually. I set a girl’s hair on fire once. It was kind of an accident. Kind of?
Yes. She said something really dicky and I was a bit drunk and I just kind of threw the lighter out and swooshed it, as if to say to my friends, “I should light her hair on fire”. But then it actually did catch on fire so I had to start patting her on the back trying to put it out. And she thought I was trying to hit her. It was all a big mis­un­der­stand­ing. Do you think decent pop needs an under­cur­rent of despair?
It doesn’t have to, but for me to really feel something for it, it does. I can listen to something and think “this is a great song, but I’m not moved by it”, and I probably won’t listen to it again. It needs a sense of des­per­a­tion, espe­cially in the vocal. I like to listen to des­per­a­tion. Is it harder to write a happy song than a sad song?
For me it is — I’ve tried, and I’m useless at it. Oh look, there’s some beer coming for me! [General Swedish chat­ter­ing in back­ground] You should see this room I’m in. I’m lying on one of these lounge beds that women in the olden days who wore corsets sat down on if they were going to faint. One of those. Is it a bit like a therapy session?
Kind of. Tell me about your dreams. 
Well, my dreams are kind of coming true right now, or I’m hoping they will. To go around the world playing live and writing songs with amazing people — doing that forever is my dream, along with having tonnes of people singing my lyrics. From where you are now, it seems like you could become either a Robyn-type popstar or a Katy Perry-type one. From what you’ve just said about people singing your lyrics it seems like you would like to be quite huge. Is that true?
Everyone always says “I’m not doing it for the fame”, which is true for me too, and I’ve always said I don’t care if there’s three or 10,000 people in the audience, but I remember when I did that feature on ‘Strangers’ with Seven Lions and I saw a clip from when they did a concert, and there were 7,000 people singing along to my voice and my lyrics. And I watched it over and over again. And I was thinking, “what if I’d been there, and they were singing with me?” Thinking about what you asked, and wondering who I identify with, and I think I can’t identify with ‘Roar’, but I can identify with ‘Call Your Girlfriend’. So I’d say I identify more with Robyn, but I’d love to have as many people come to my shows as Katy Perry. Surely the ideal situation is Katy Perry releasing ‘Call Your Girlfriend’. 
Exactly! I’ll be the good mix between them! And you’ve got an EP coming out soon, but you’re still writing for other people as well?
I’m focusing more on me at the moment. Things come up from work I’ve done before — “this artist is doing this song now” — so for example I’ve got a song with Lea Michele, I think. But those songs seem like a while ago now. Now I want to focus on getting an album together and I’m just picking through my demos seeing which ones will make it through. How many have you got it down to?
Well, I think there will be a few from the EP because I’m really happy with the songs from there, then I have about ten or fifteen more that I’m picking from, and I’ll write some new songs too. It’s going to be tough. Why don’t you send your demos over and I’ll tell you the best ones?
Oh that could be fun! Sure. I’ll send them over! That would be perfect. They’re all quite rough, but I’ll send them over. I was kind of joking but please do. 
Well, why not? If I’d said that to Britney she’d be like, a) I don’t actually have any of the songs I’m working on, b) sign an NDA, c) no. 
Well I think as soon as you start making everything about being a business rather than people who love music, it goes wrong. Anyway you’re getting the songs.  Good stuff. Apart from what’s likely to be on your album, have you kept back a killer song? A song so amazing that you haven’t dared release it because you know one day a Madonna or someone will call and need a career-reviving megahit? 
Oh, let me think. I don’t think so. I’m not secretive enough! I’m not patient enough! I try to be. I do have a few things that I’ve written recently and when I think of them I think, “wow, this is huge — should I do this or should I see if someone big wants it”. But I usually move on pretty quick. Maybe you can decide that for me when I send over my demos. What is one of the titles of those songs, so if it pops up in two years as a Madonna hit we’ll all know what you were talking about? Or if not Madonna, another ultimate artist?
Well Katy Perry would be amazing — if I write something powerful I know she’ll def­in­itely deliver. I would love to have a guy sing one of my songs. Someone like Mikky Ekko, def­in­itely. If he did sing one of my songs I would probably die of happiness. Let’s say Katy Perry shall we. 
Well I have a song called ‘Imaginary Friend’. That would be a good one for Katy Perry. But I might do it myself. (Laughs) If someone from Sony phoned you and said, “right, Tove Lo, we’ve invented a computer program based on Michael Jackson’s voice which means we can make him sing any song we like, and we’re basically making a brand new Michael Jackson album using new songs and our computer program”, would you give them the song? 
I don’t know. I don’t think so. A computer is not a person. It would sound just like Michael Jackson. 
Yeah. It would be so cool to hear it. But you know it’s like when someone says “look at my bag, it looks just like a super expensive brand”, but deep inside you know it’s not the real bag. So I would say no. Is it strange to have worked on a song two years ago, and then for someone to suddenly go “here’s my new single”?
It’s crazy — you remember doing the song, and you remember being excited about it, and then you pitched it and nothing happened. Then a year later, it’s like “oh, this artist wants to record it”. Then a year after that they’re actually releasing it. It makes you realise that you should never give up on songs: if you believe in them they’ll find their home. Do you write better songs in the winter or summer?
It all depends what’s happened to me at the time. Usually the winter: I write when I’m on my own and isolated and it’s better to be like that in the winter — it’s easier to hide away. You know in Batman at the start when his parents get killed and that one moment is what defines who he will be for the rest of his life?
Yes. Which one event in your life made you the woman you are today?
Wow. That’s a hard question. I think it was when I was 15, when I decided to apply to a hippie musical school. I’d maybe been on stage twice by that point, and I just sat at home writing all these lyrics that nobody ever saw. All these posh people around me were going to the ‘good’ school where you go if you get the good grades. Actually I got good grades too and I applied to the good school too, and I got in. But I also applied to the music school, got in, and decided to go there. My life changed a lot both for better and worse after that, but that was a really big choice for me. Where were you when you made that decision?
I was sitting with the applic­a­tions, and I was in my room listening to music. What do you think the Stockholm music school taught you that one in London might not have done? 
Well, the thing with that school was that it was very anti-pop when I went there. It was very much “you either do soul or rock or jazz”. I wasn’t very good when I started. What I really learned was to overcome any fear you have about getting up on stage. It was hard. I got a lot stronger from going there. It’s scary at first, when you’re a teenager and people are watching you: you fuck up and it feels like the end of the world. Then you realise that actually, nobody died. And you move on. Do you see yourself as being in com­pet­i­tion with other artists, or do you exist in a vacuum?
When you’re a girl-slash-woman writing pop there is obviously com­pet­i­tion coming from all the acts coming out of Sweden, but I don’t feel like I’m competing with anyone. People will say, “you sound similar to this, or similar to that” but I don’t mind that. If it’s someone I like. There’s more space for more music now, with Spotify and the internet and that kind of thing. Nobody will cancel out someone else — there’s space for everybody. You’ve just got to make good stuff. Well yes, kind of. But twenty years ago when people bought music they’d play it loads, and they’d develop a personal con­nec­tion with it. And with there being so much music available now, you know that no matter how much you love something another great song will pop up in three hours. So you hear more great music but you don’t have an intense rela­tion­ship with it. 
That’s the bad thing, that makes me a bit sad. That it’s so dis­pos­able: “That’s good, but I’ll play with something else for a bit.” I mean I want to release the album of my dreams, but at the same time do people even really care about albums any more? I suppose what it means is that as an artist you can’t make the assump­tion that people are going to spend time getting to know your music, and I suppose the point I’m leading to is that one of the things I like about your songs is that they make a strong melodic impact, but also a strong emotional impact, the first time you hear them. So obviously repeated listening is still rewarding, but it’s not necessary in order to get deep into the songs. They’re quite complex but very immediate too, and at a point when everyone is fighting for attention your songs grab attention very quickly. 
Well that’s nice to hear. That makes me feel good. So anyway con­grat­u­la­tions on that. Can you describe the house you grew up in?
Well I grew up in a kind of posh area in Stockholm. The walls of my bedroom were yellow with flowers on them when I was little, then when I was 13 I painted them black. Classic teenager behaviour. 
Exactly. Anyway, we lived by the water in a two-storey house and my brother and I had rooms next to each other. From the kitchen there were big windows and you could look out straight to the ocean. And there was an island where one of my best friends lived. I had a bit of a crush on him, I would take my bin­ocu­lars and try to see if he was down by the jetty. This was before we became friends. My door was full of stickers of Leo DiCaprio, then later Kurt Cobain. What did you parents do?
My mum’s a psy­cho­lo­gist. My dad has had a bunch of different companies. They’re both academic, there’s no real music history in my family. They weren’t very happy with my choices at first but now they’re very proud. Worried, but proud. Do you worry that your mum analyses your lyrics?
Yes I do worry, and yes I know she does. She can’t watch the ‘Habits’ video. She sent me a text saying: “My dear daughter, I started watching the video, I realised it was not a mum-friendly one, I hope your life is good and not like in the video.” I called her and I was like, “mum, I’m fine, you did bad things when you grew up!” She was like, “I did not”.  Drugs pop up a lot in your songs and they seem to be asso­ci­ated with bad times, but isn’t the main point of drugs that they’re supposed to be fun?
Yes. I think they’re good fun. But you associate them with bad times. 
Well when you’re really really down and nothing brings you up, then that’s something that def­in­itely will, without a doubt. You let your mind go and you let your heart­break go. So even if I associate it with bad situ­ations, it’s more like… The dif­fer­ence is between doing it for fun and doing it because you need to. Obviously it’s better to do it for fun than because you need to cloud your real emotions. But both ways it works pretty well. Obviously when you’re down that’s the worst time to be taking drugs, because then you need to deal with the comedown. 
That’s usually what you realise after­wards yes. Lyrically the thrust of your EP seems to be “I am troubled”, “there is a darkness to my life” and so on. And I’m wondering if that’s a realistic descrip­tion of your life, or if it’s a cari­ca­ture, and if in fact you’re fine and just have bad points every now and again.
Well, obviously, being raised by a psy­cho­lo­gist you do see a lot of psy­cho­lo­gists, so that has always been my thing: I have the good and the bad sides that I go between. I feel like one part of me wants to be a great person, quit everything I’m doing, go and fight for nature and animals and people who are suffering and do something real and mean­ing­ful with my life. Then the other part of me wants to fuck up and die in a year and do everything that’s bad for me and have a lot of fun along the way. I’m always between those two people. That’s a very honest answer isn’t it? I really am having a therapy session here on this sofa. I can let things go easily, but when I’m very sad I do dive very deep into it. I need to do that to get out of it: it’s always up and down. I know I’m not alone in that. I’m a normally depressed young person. It seems like perhaps you get happier and more euphoric than most people, and perhaps more down and depressed than most people get too, swinging between two greater extremes than average people?
I think that’s exactly it. You nailed it. Yes. That’s what it is: I feel a lot more. I feel a lot of feelings, either really happy or really sad. Who were your role models as a teenager and do you think you’d be a good role model for teenagers now?
I was really into Kurt Cobain and Courtney Love who probably weren’t the best role models for a teenager but I was just amazed by them. I grew up very protected and very happy with great parents and I was just looking for trouble because I was really fas­cin­ated by it. I don’t know if I’m a good role model, I think in some ways I might be and in other ways def­in­itely not. I don’t think a teenage guy will want a teenage girl to watch my videos, for example, but I do think if you’re strong and you do your own thing that’s a good example for anyone. Do you feel like you’re in control of yourself?
No. Not at all. When you’re out of control what do you do to get back in control?
I need someone I trust to tell me. To confront me. And to say: “What are you doing right now?”… And I have that in my life, so that’s good. Whose advice do you listen to as an artist?
I have a really good team around me — my new managers are really amazing. The ones that have been with me through the whole thing — my publisher, he’s been really amazing too, he’s been holding my hand the whole way through. I trust him. Do you endlessly analyse your decisions or are you impulsive?
I’m impulsive. I follow the first feeling — usually that’s right. Every time I’ve let myself be convinced to do something, and I see the result, it’s always what I didn’t want. So I try to trust my gut. How’s that going so far? 
Pretty well. I’ve ques­tioned it a few times, but now I’m happy. Is there anything else we need to discuss?
No, I’ve think I’ve already told you way too much! ■ The 'Truth Serum' EP is out on April 7 2014, via Polydor. Tove is on both Facebook and Twitter. ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202496.35/warc/CC-MAIN-20190321051516-20190321073516-00083.warc.gz
14,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/articles/cheryl-cole-interview/92541/," Hi.
Hello! Do you remember, you inter­viewed us right at the start in the Popstars: The Rivals house? Yes. How's the last ten years been for you?
Crazy. If you were to draw a graph of the last ten years, how would it look?
Like this? (Waves arm around) Would it be gradually going up or gradually going down?
It depends what aspect of my life you're talking about. But it's been crazy. So the point of our chat today is to have a talk about your music.
Yes. Because you've got an album out, so a lot of people who are inter­view­ing you will just use that as an excuse to get in a room with you then ask you about other stuff. They'll try and ask you stuff and you'll just do that face…
(Does 'that face') Yes. So we're just going to talk about your music today. Imagine people reading those words on the internet page con­tain­ing this interview. How many people do you think have just fucked off to the Daily Mail website?
I think if you're going on to Popjustice, you're going on to hear about music and not to hear about shite. Well quite. To the people who are still reading, do you have a message?
Welcome. Good. So: what was the first email or phonecall or text or whatever that led to this album happening?
The first phonecall was from Seth [Friedman, co-manager], who said: ""Let's go to New York and work with these new guys, the Beemer Boys."" They're young producers. I made it clear I wanted to work with new producers with fresh ears and exciting newness. Why was newness important?
It's always amazing to have exper­i­ence there but I like giving people a shot when I believe they're talented. They have more fire in their belly. They're more excited to make new sounds. They're excited for a hit — the pos­sib­il­ity that their talent's going to be heard. After all these years you need that. With a bigger producer can you tell when they've just got a song out of the bottom draw, or they've just gone, ""have this track""?
You can feel it. So with new producers, you'll get their best stuff.
Exactly. Whereas — like a lot of people from the UK — if you go off to Dr Luke he's already given his best stuff to Katy.
And you don't just want to sound the same as everybody else. You want newness! You want to sound like you! Apart from sounding 'new' what does sounding like you sound like?
Right now? Was there a brief that went out to writers and producers?
It's more what you feel when you hear something. It's not that tech­nic­ally it needs to sound like A, B or C, it's just how I feel when I hear it. Like when I heard 'Call My Name'. When you hear the ""do-do-do-do-do-do"" [this bit] it gives you that… Well, it makes you feel like you want to dance. When you first heard it, apart from thinking 'this is quite good', did you also think, 'this sounds a bit like Rihanna'?
I didn't. And I don't think it does! Don't you?
(Having none of it) No! Not in a bad way neces­sar­ily. Like a brother or a sister, perhaps…
Well that's going to be natural because it's Calvin. They're both Calvin-produced songs. So naturally you're going to think that. But if you play them side by side they don't sound the same. Although you might naturally think that, because it's the same producer. It's not a bad thing. The thing is, dance music and dance sounds are the new pop. Pop these days isn't how S Club 7 used to sound. It's now dance beats. DJs of the world — David Guetta, Calvin Harris, will.i.am — that's all pop. So with the album did you want to fit in with pop as it currently is? So not causing a nuisance but just fitting in with pop in terms of what's already there? Or…
Well I like to cause a little bit of a nuisance. I've got a lot of dub on there. Which some people consider as noise! Some people don't like dub at all! But (looks con­spir­at­orial) I like those bits… Some of it is a racket though. But chuck it in the middle of a pop song and it's fine.
Yes! That's one of the best things about pop — it just takes the best bits of all the other genres and does what it wants with them.
Very true, that's a good way of putting it. But still, some dubstep is a racket.
I like it! I wanted to make a feelgood record though. The fans have been waiting a long time for it, so… But some of it's quite sad. Also, sur­pris­ingly perhaps, the average tempo of the album is a lot more downbeat than you might expect.
It's a lot more mid-tempo than crazy dance, yes. I like that feeling. Not crazy, not a ballad. Regarding the lyrics on the album, the point you seem to have made in inter­views elsewhere is something along the lines of: ""Don't question me about the lyrics on the album relating to my personal life, because I didn't write them so they can't.""
Yes. Which is an amazing response, really.
It's the truth! Most popstars spend half their careers trying to pretend they do write their lyrics when they don't. And you're just going: ""Nothing to do with me! Not my fault!""
Yes. But how does that work? You obviously have a con­nec­tion to these lyrics. Or at least in order to be able to have a con­nec­tion with your music, you must tell yourself a story about how a song makes sense to you?
Well what I do is, I get loads of records sent. Sometimes I get just a beat. That you can just fall in love with. Or just a hook. And I'll write the verses, or I'll say, ""can someone please write the verses to this""… Sometimes it takes a lifetime to master your craft. To be an amazing lyricist doesn't mean you're a good performer. There are some people out there who write the best songs in the world and their idea of hell is going on stage and singing those songs. But to col­lab­or­ate with someone like that, and to create a pop song out of it, is amazing, and I'm not afraid of that. I don't care that I didn't write it, I just appre­ci­ate other people's talents. I didn't grow up listening to songs thinking, ""well they didn't write it"". I loved those songs because they were great songs, and that's still how I feel when I'm making my music. Loads of amazing songs haven't been written by the people who made them famous, but in terms of a 'pop moment' a lot of them still fit in with where the singer is in life and what they're going through…
Oh you've got to connect to a song, yes. You can't sing a song you feel nothing for. So when the email goes out from your A&R… Who A&Rd the album?
Ferdy [Unger-Hamilton, Polydor bigwig]. So when Ferdy sends out the email like a Bat Signal going 'CHERYL ALBUM UNDERWAY, SEND IN YOUR SONGS'…
Well that's a lie actually, it's a col­lab­or­a­tion between me, Ferdy and Will. Ferdy will send me a lot of tracks, I found some, Will listens to them and goes ""yes, no, I like that, I don't like that"". Who has the final say?
Me. It's my record, it's up to me. Is there anything you had to fight for to stay on the album?
Actually I had a lot of fights on this record. There was stuff they didn't want and that I wanted, and that they wanted and I didn't want. I recorded so much material that I had to give my head a wobble and realise that they do what they do because they're amazing at their job, and if they're saying ""this song's better for the record"" you have to put your trust in their hands. And that's why we've had a rela­tion­ship for ten years: because they know what they're doing. I don't want to become a control freak! Some people would say: ""I've been doing this ten years. I'm the popstar, do what I say.""
I get the final say, abso­lutely, but for example I wanted to put 25 songs on the record and they just wouldn't have it. With things like that I have to trust in them. Do you trust these people though? You must see other artists — we all see them — with their terrible videos, and their crap albums, and everything's wrong. And you think, ""someone at their label has made the decision that all this is the right thing to do"". So you wonder, really, if you can trust people just because they have that job…
Only if you're an up-and-coming artist, I think. Initially, in the beginning, you're still learning so it's important that you take direction from people who've been in the industry a long time. That's where some artists go wrong — they come up with their first record, they try to make demands, they try doing things that are out of their depth and they're not exper­i­enced enough yet to be making those decisions. When was the last time you saw that happen?
It happens often. You're just not always made fully aware of it because they don't make enough of an impact. You don't see them come, so you don't see them go. What do you think the expect­a­tion is of this album, based on the last album?
I think expect­a­tion is always going to be there, but I don't feel pressure. But what do you think people are going to be expecting? Do you think, based on the last album, that people will think this new one is going to be good? Or alright? Or bad?
Well you know, I had great success with both albums so the expectation's def­in­itely there. The expect­a­tion that your album will be suc­cess­ful, or that it will be good?
Well it's a good album. In my opinion it's the best album out of the three. Whichever way it's received, it's my best work — it's the one I'm happiest with. It does feel like it's supposed to be an album, rather than just some stuff chucked together.
It took us a long time! Have you taken it more seriously this time?
I've always taken the album process seriously. The first album was scary. The odds were against us, being from a girlgroup anyway — people already had the idea of someone coming from a girlgroup, stat­ist­ic­ally. And I never anti­cip­ated how much I'd miss being around the girls in every aspect: being in the studio, being on the stage. To actually be there without them was ter­ri­fy­ing. So my first exper­i­ence was daunting, scary, amazing. Second album: I was really sick with the malaria. They said to me at one point, ""I'm going to pull the record until next year"". I was terrified because I just wanted to make the record. I probably should have given myself a little more time to become well, but I didn't, I wanted to go to the studio. That's why I only put two records out from that album. It didn't feel like it was bursting with singles.
No. I was so excited that I was… Well, that I was alive, and able to do the record… Well anyway with this one I haven't had any X Factor drama, I haven't had anything to distract me from it, it's just been the music. I've enjoyed the process, and I think when you feel that the fans do too. Can you explain the lyrics from the chorus of 'Call My Name'?
You'll have to ask Calvin. What do they mean to you?
Just fun! It's a pop song. Do you wonder what they mean?
They don't feel deep to me. But if you ask me what half Girls Aloud songs mean, I'd say the same thing! They don't have a meaning, they have a feeling. I think it's quite a sexy lyric? Um… It's really not that deep. We're not saving the world with lyrics or anything. Would you like to save the world with a lyric?
No, I'd like to just feel good. You said you wanted 25 songs on the album. How many did you record?
Probably 50. Which was the best song of the 50, and which was the worst?
I didn't really have any bad ones. I had good memories attached to all of them. Are there any that just didn't fit in?
Yes, a lot of them didn't make the album because they just didn't fit. Some were too pop, one was too dancey. There was a very very soulful one. In the beginning we went every­where. Narrowing it down to an album that sounded good as a package was the hard bit. Going back to what we almost talked about earlier — that point when the initial emails go out saying, ""CHERYL ALBUM AHOY, SEND US YOUR SONGS"" or whatever: who do you think people were writing those songs for? It must be tempting as a writer to just base it on what you've seen, which will be what's in the media…
Some of the songs already exist. They send you songs that already exist. And a lot of the people I worked with are from America, so they don't have that crap in their heads. The question is whether the songs end up being a cari­ca­ture because they'll only know a few things about you…
(Interrupting) Have you HEARD the album? Yes.
Do you think it feels like that? There's the danger of that — for instance you'll listen to a Kylie album and it feels like people have just written a load of songs about Kylie going out dancing because that's what Kylie's 'supposed to do'. I wonder if there's a danger that people will just see the stuff that's in the tabloids, then write about that.
I don't read them. Like I say, I worked a lot on this record in New York and LA, and they don't have tabloids there — they don't have a pre­con­ceived idea of who you are. They just write good music! The thing here [in the UK] is that a lot of stuff is over-analysed, when it's just meant to be a song. How do you introduce yourself to these people when nobody knows who you are?
I LOVE it! It's amazing. Like I say, they don't have a pre­con­ceived idea. They don't care. I just say, ""I'm Cheryl, nice to meet you"". Let's talk 'Sexy Den A Mutha'.
It was the last song that came in for the record. It's got a funny title.
That I'm going to blame solely on Jim Beanz. He's from Philadelphia. I was trying to say, ""sexy than"". The song is actually called ""Sexy [as in sexier] Than A Motherfucker"". But we obviously censored the track. I told him to call it 'The Sexy Song' but it's his song so I respected that. Why was it important to censor 'fuck' on that and a few of the other songs on the album?
Hm… It was com­pletely up to me whether I wanted to leave them on and I'm old enough and ugly enough to say ""fucking hell"" if I want to. But I have a lot of younger fans too. I thought it would be nice for them to hear the songs without the swear words. Some parents freak out when you put a 'censored' label on a CD. Some of them are 12, 13! They've been waiting over a year for an album and I didn't want to push them out. Adults get the message, I think. Do you think this album's going to gain you any new fans?
Possibly. Do you think it could win the Mercury Music Prize?
Wow. That's up to them. I'm very proud of it. Is there any reason it shouldn't be regarded alongside whoever gets nominated for these things — your PJ Harveys or whoever?
Er… You know what, I never think of myself col­lect­ing awards. That's just an added bonus. If you're lucky enough to get things like that, that's fantastic. Do you find singing easy?
I don't, no. I don't think singing is supposed to be easy. It's supposed to come from your emotions. How do you make it come from your emotions when, like you've said, you don't have an emotional con­nec­tion with the lyrics?
I didn't say that. I never said that. Alright then: when you don't know what the lyrics mean.
You connect with a song. That's why you sing a song. Without trying to start an argument, you did say you don't know — for example — what 'Call My Name' is about.
That's a feel-good song. It's not to be over-analysed, it's just a good pop song. So the feel-bad songs…
Not feel-bad. Some of them are quite sad.
Like what? 'Mechanics Of The Heart' is sad.
That's about a guy who's… You always hear about a woman having her heart broken on songs. 'Mechanics Of The Heart' is about a guy who's had his heart broken by a girl, and she's saying to him, ""if you don't believe that this is meant to be, how am I supposed to mend your heart?"" I think that's quite a nice way of looking at something. Rather than just saying, ""oh my heart's so broken"". Shall we quickly bang through what each of the songs is about? A sentence or two on each?
Okay. 'Under The Sun'.
It's a really fun song. It's about a guy telling you anything you want to hear to get his way, and you saying, ""actually, normally I wouldn't, but today I might"". The sun just makes you feel good. 'Call My Name': who knows.
Fun. 'Craziest Things'.
This is a song me and Will wrote about having an argument — the things you say to each other sometimes in a rela­tion­ship, all the hurtful things, all the amazing things. Sometimes it can be crazy because you go from saying, ""I love you"", to ""I hate you"", from ""you mean the world"" to ""fuck you"". 'Girl In The Mirror'.
Love that song — it's about girls giving them­selves too much of a hard time, and sometimes you just need to chill. It's hard being a girl. 'A Million Lights'.
This started off as an indie-sounding song. I just loved it. It feels nice to sing, too. Like when I did 'Set The Fire To The Third Bar' with Snow Patrol, it felt like that when I recorded 'A Million Lights'. 'Screw You'.
This was written for me, because I went into the studio with every intention of recording a different song. I was hungover from a party I'd been to the night before… Which is a bit unpro­fes­sional.
I know, and it's the first and last time it's happened. But they were like, ""let's use the studio time anyway"". And that's what they wrote in that time — I think the inspir­a­tion was that someone had tweeted a picture of me giving the middle finger, and that's what inspired them. 'Love Killer'.
I love how the beat makes you feel. ""Why do I love you so much when you're a love killer"" — you kill the buzz of love. I love you, you're a buzz killer. 'Ghetto Baby'.
This was written by Lana and I LOVED the demo. Was this one of various songs that were floating around? She's been writing for ages hasn't she.
She's been writing for ages but I was getting loads of songs sent over where they were going ""this is amazing"", and then I'd play it and I'd be like, ""hm, it's not for me"". Then I got a really blasé message with this song, going ""listen to this, you might like it, you might not"". And I loved it! I called Ferdy, I was like, ""who is this girl?"". And he said, ""it's funny you should ask that, she's another artist who's coming out soon with a song called 'Video Games', she's called Lana Del Rey"". I just loved the song. You could hear that she was a bit more than a demo singer. You know what I mean? You could feel that it was real. 'Mechanics Of The Heart' we've talked about…
I did this with Taio Cruz and there was a guy singing ori­gin­ally so we flipped it. 'All Is Fair'.
It's one for my Soldiers. Just being there and sup­port­ing us through everything. As soon as I heard the chorus ""this is war"" I knew I was meant to sing it. You talked earlier about song­writers and producers having these songs sitting around and sending them to you… If you'd said no to them, who do you think the songs would have gone to next?
I've no idea. Do you ever wonder if anyone's been offered songs before they get to you?
I mean I get offered songs that I then hear someone else sing, but it's a personal thing isn't it — it's whether it connects with you or not. I don't really know who else is doing that dubby sound at the moment. Are there any songs that you think are… Well, that you think you're lucky to have got? That you think, ""fucking hell, I'm glad I got my hands on this before someone else came along""? Like do you feel there's a dif­fer­ence in quality between the songs you might get, and people who are on their first album or whatever?
Erm… (Pause to consider barrage of questions) I hadn't really thought of it like that. One imagines you would get sent better songs than Pixie Lott, for instance. Or they'd be sent to you, and if you say no, then they go to her. One imagines. In the same way that Rihanna might get first choice and you get second?
Rihanna has a team that works for her spe­cific­ally and they all go in different rooms — writing camps. That's amazing. That's brilliant. And those are super-talented people. I mean writers have people in mind when they're writing — they might think 'oh this song is for Rihanna', and then she doesn't want it, and they just kind of put it away and you hear it years later with a different beat to make it current. Girls Aloud once did a song that Kylie sang a bit of later, for example. The Xenomania house works a lot like a writing camp, doesn't it, with the different rooms?
Yes. It creates a buzz and it's exciting. Personally I think this is all down to how someone inter­prets a song. A song I might sing, might not suit Pixie Lott, and vice versa. Is that a bongo on 'All Is Fair'?
No. It sounds like a bongo.
It's a heli­copter. There's no judgement here. There's no ""oh bongos in pop are bad"" argument, or even ""bongos in pop are good"". It was just important to establish whether or not there were in fact bongos on that song. And you say no.
No. It's a fine line between a helictop­ter and a bongo.
There's a heli­copter, there's no bongo. How did you know when the album was finished? Was there a deadline or did you just go, ""right that's it — finished now""?
Oh I could have kept going. So who decided?
Will and I had a three-hour meeting. It wasn't supposed to be three hours — I was just supposed to play him some songs I liked. But I played him so many, and he was like, ""you have more than enough here"". When he said that I felt comfort in that… He seems to have a sur­pris­ing level of input — when it was first announced that he'd be involved it seemed like it would be one of those things where someone else does all the work. But he's been pretty hands on?
It was actually him that convinced me to do a solo record. I never would have done a solo record without him. Are you sure?
I'm positive. Yes. Well what would you have done instead?
Well at the time, I would have had a family. At the time I was still married! But it was actually Will saying to us, ""you know you're going to do a solo record, right?"", and I was saying, ""I don't want to, not yet"". And he was like, ""I think you should. You need to"". He said, ""I'm excited, I want to be involved with it"". So he was involved from day one. I recorded my first-ever solo song with Will. So your life has gone [at this point we move our hands apart to signify a life splitting in two] because of his encour­age­ment? If he hadn't encour­aged you, you could have a family now?
It would have been a pos­sib­il­ity. I hadn't sat down and thought, ""when we take this hiatus I'm going to do a solo record"". So naturally the thing would have been that, yes. You probably would have felt the itch, though, to make music?
Honesty, it was him. I was happy to be in a group! So if the one year off — the 'one year off' — had happened as it had, and Nadine went off to do her solo thing, and Kimberley did her Shrek and everything…
Well Kimberley didn't intend to go and do Shrek — the intention wasn't to be in Shrek. Well yes, but the question is, imagine there's a three year period where nothing's happening, surely you would have felt the urge to make music?
Well Will always says I should write more for other artists, I probably would have did writing. Wouldn't you have missed fronting music though?
It was only supposed to be a year! That wasn't long in our lives, and by the time we came to take a break, we came to take a break. But I probably would have missed per­form­ing. But I don't know, because it didn't go like that. And I haven't had a break from it, so I haven't had that feeling. It just seems really sur­pris­ing that you wouldn't have felt the need to…
…to make a solo record? Because quite apart from what you wanted, surely there would have been a lot of other people who wanted you to?
Make a solo record? Not at the time. Actually, I think the label were a bit dubious at the time when Will suggested it. I think they were like, ""stat­ist­ic­ally it doesn't work"". I was married, I was sorted! It was Will who said, ""come in and write"". And the first thing I wrote was 'Heaven'. And yes, he doesn't manage me day to day, he's a superstar, but he oversees everything and his man­age­ment are my man­age­ment. So we're a family. He doesn't arrange my diary though. But he says things like ""I like this record, I like that record, that artwork's not great""… He tried to make me a cover for my record actually. That same day, in that three-hour meeting. I said, ""I think I'm going to call it this"", and he went, ""come here!"". And he got an image off the internet and mocked up a cover of the album in front of me. Was it any good?
(Pulls unim­pressed face) He started to shade bits out and it looked like I was just a head floating in space. That's a strong look.

15,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/articles/edited-highlights-of-a-chat-with-mutya-keisha-siobhan/," This time last week, we met up with Mutya Keisha Siobhan — for that is the name the Origibabes/Propababes/Whatevababes will be going under — for a chat. Two points before we go any further. First: the music sounds really good. We're still not allowed to say very much about it, but it's offi­cially 'not shit'. Second: before we met up with them we were a bit worried that the whole exper­i­ence would be quite ser­i­ous­face and awkward but as soon as you sit in a room with the three of them you can tell it's all fine. There is lots of laughter and fun and stuff like that. Our interview with the girls is their first as a band since 2001, and we'll be putting the full text online soon. For the time being here are five things we learned from the chat, with some sup­port­ing quotes so you know we didn't make the whole thing up. POINT ONE: YOU SHOULDN'T READ ANYTHING INTO THE ORDER OF THEIR NAMES IN 'MUTYA KEISHA SIOBHAN' BECAUSE IT BASICALLY JUST SOUNDS GOOD Siobhan: People seem to say it in that order quite naturally. It seems to roll off the tongue like that.
Keisha: Mutya, can I just say something? I found a link the other day which I really want to show you. It’s a clip of you when you're 16 and they ask you why we came up with the name ‘Sugababes’. And you go: “Well we had to have a band name because we couldn’t have people just calling us Mutya, Keisha, Siobhan.” (Everyone laughs) Amazing! It’s so cute. It’s when you were innocent.
Mutya: I’m still innocent! POINT TWO: KEISHA IS FINE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE SUGABABES THANKS VERY MUCH ALTHOUGH THE DETAILS ARE A BIT LONG-WINDED Keisha: Have you got an hour? (Much chortling) Basically, I can’t say too much about it — legally I’ve been told I can’t speak about it. But what I will say is that when everyone else found out I wasn’t in the group is pretty much when I found out. I will say that we had a great rela­tion­ship, me and the girls; I’ve never had an argument with Amelle in my life. I was really shocked by the things that they were saying because I’d always been there for them, and they were there for me as well… But, you move on, and you learn, and I learned valuable life lessons during that period… I feel like everything has gone full circle and right now I’m exactly where I’m meant to be. And I genuinely wish them the best of luck. I know people are always going to say, “oh, you’ve got to say that”… To be honest with you I was very hurt and dis­ap­poin­ted and I did feel betrayed by the whole thing. But I feel like when you don’t forgive people and when you’re very bitter it’s not really doing anything for you. But I’m in a great place, and that’s all I care about. Onwards and upwards. POINT THREE: THEY'VE TALKED ABOUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF SOMEONE LEFT THE BAND AGAIN Siobhan: Then that would be the end of that.
Keisha: We’ve had dis­cus­sions. We have a way of working: we trust each other. We look after each other. We are genuinely there for each other. If we were unhappy we’d tell each other and we’d figure it out, between ourselves.
Siobhan: Everything is a group decision this time round.
Keisha: There will be no over­work­ing people to the point where they’re depressed. There’s none of that stuff. We all have the same inten­tions. You need that. I’ve always wanted to be part of something where I genuinely felt sis­ter­hood, and I feel like I’ve def­in­itely found that now.
Mutya: Well thank you very much. POINT FOUR: THIS WHOLE REUNION THING ALMOST HAPPENED IN 2009 (BUT DIDN'T) Keisha: Well, back in 2009 I was contacted by the girls through my lawyer, and they were kind of like, ‘do you want to meet up?’. We all met up. I’d only been out of the band for three months and I’d just had enough of girlbands. I’d had enough of the WHOLE THING… Anyway, basically, they contacted me and we sat together and I actually really wanted to see the girls. Me meeting up with them was more about me wanting to see them than actually thinking about getting the band back together. Because like I say it was only three months after I’d left the Sugababes. So we decided not to do it. And then last year, in 2011, we were contacted by a producer. He put it to us: he said, “let’s record a few tracks and then see”. And we did. And we loved it.
Siobhan: He actually called me which was weird because I’d never worked with him before… And I said I’d only do it if it was with the other girls. (Firmly) I didn’t want to do another project on my own.
Keisha: We basically said, “yes, but we want to do it on our own terms”.
Siobhan: We didn’t want anyone to organise it for us. We wanted to steer the ship ourselves, which is what we did. POINT FIVE: THE MOMENT WHEN THEY ALL SANG TOGETHER AGAIN FOR THE FIRST TIME WAS QUITE SPECIAL, AS YOU MIGHT EXPECT Siobhan: The first time we sang in a room together and worked out our harmonies and sang them together was recording a song called ‘Too In Love’.
Keisha: It was the first time we’d sang together since we were 16 years old. To be honest with you it wasn’t an instant thing. When we were younger we gelled straight away, but we had to learn to blend with each other again.
Mutya: It’s been a while!
Keisha: Yes. It was when we came to do another song, ‘Love Me Hard’ — that’s when I first properly heard us blending.
Siobhan: That’s when we knew that we properly had to get back together. You never know if that magic is still going to be there. If it’s not going to be as magical as the first time around you don’t really want to do it, do you. The minute we sang together, we looked at each other, and we knew. It just worked.
Mutya: It was emotional.
Keisha: It was so special to be excited about hearing our voices together, and being excited about our music. On my days off I’d go home and I’d listen to the tracks. I’d be like, ‘I’m really enjoying this’. I just enjoyed our music.
Mutya: We’ve got some really good songs.
Siobhan: For me, it’s the first time in years that I’ve been excited about even attempt­ing a music project. I’m super-excited. IN SUMMARY 1. It's the Sugababes but don't call them the Sugababes.
2. They're excited.
3. We're excited.
4. You'll hear some music soon.
5. Amazing. ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912205534.99/warc/CC-MAIN-20190326135436-20190326161436-00123.warc.gz
16,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/articles/giorgio-moroder-interview-i-hated-the-moustache/,"In 1977 Giorgio Moroder decided that he wanted to make a song that sounded like the future. The result was so powerful that it changed the course of music. Giorgio hadn't just predicted pop's future: he'd defined it. 37 years later 'I Feel Love' still sounds like it's from the future and Giorgio continues to look ahead. Back in the spotlight following an appear­ance on Daft Punk's 'Random Access Memories', Giorgio's currently putting the finishing touches to his as-yet-untitled comeback album, on which he combines some of modern pop's best artists with sounds that have packed dance­floors for forty years. So we find Foxes with the perky, disco-influ­enced 'Glitter', whose middle eight is a warm sonic homage to 'Flashdance (What A Feeling)'; Charli XCX's con­tri­bu­tion 'Diamonds', meanwhile, is a noisy, clat­ter­ing mega­banger. Then there's Sia's song, 'Deja Vu' — a melo­dra­matic, string-laded pop explosion of such dev­ast­at­ing intensity that the crater it leaves will be visible from space. Then there's Britney — but we'll come to that in a bit. Popjustice met up with Giorgio at the end of last week and it was amazing. Here's how our chat went. So the new music is very good. I’ve heard five new songs so far — the tune you had out last year was very much a dance track, but these new ones are pop songs.
Yes! Well that’s what I wanted to do. I’m shocked actually — with the Kylie song, after three days we’re Number 61 in Italy, in the radio charts. On iTunes we’re in the charts in several countries, and yesterday Radio 2 played it. But do you know what, I’m not going to read comments online any more. You can have ten brilliant reviews, and it’s the one bad one you remember. I read one — I know I shouldn’t have done — but it was this guy from Italy. His first word? “Shit.”  When I spoke to Pharrell last year he said he wasn’t really intending to make a comeback until it all kicked off with 'Get Lucky', at which point Sony called him in and said ‘how’s about an album then’. Did you decide to make this album following your own appear­ance on the Daft Punk album, or was the idea already there?
Well Pharrell was still in business, right? He was off the radar though — he hadn’t had a huge hit for a few years.
Well I hadn’t had a hit for THIRTY years! (Laughs) But I’d been doing some some DJing, and I’d got man­age­ment, and man­age­ment said: ""To do better at DJing, you need an album."" And suddenly I had three offers for an album. Quite good offers, too — because to do an album with big acts can be costly. So the offers were quite big. If you think, I’m 74 and there are thousands of kids who are 18 or 20, they’re talented, they’re eager to work. So I must say I was surprised to get not just one offer but three.  How did you approach making the album? A lot of your older fans probably want something that sounds like your early work, whereas as a producer you probably want to prove you can compete with current producers. And maybe there's a third angle too: you also want to make something com­pletely different and new.
Yes. At the very beginning, people suggested that I should do something in the old style. ‘Get Lucky’ had been so big — they thought I should do a disco dance song. But I just didn’t want to do it, because I did it so often in the past, and I know I can do other stuff. Plus I’m the co-inventor of elec­tronic music so I have the right to use that too! (Laughs) So I decided to do an album with modern sounds — EDM sounds and elec­tron­ica — but blend it with a bit of retro. Like strings, and guitars. I think the com­bin­a­tion is quite good. It’s not EDM in the bad sense of EDM, but the tracks are quite modern. So there's the Sia song, ‘Deja Vu’, which is probably the best of the lot, and sounds like a classic disco song. Whereas the Mikky Ekko one has more EDM influence.
Yes, and I think it works quite well.   And you’ve recorded a cover of [SONG TITLE WITHHELD AT GIORGIO'S VERY POLITE REQUEST] with Britney, right?
HOW DID YOU KNOW? She wanted that song. (Looking troubled) Where did you hear it‽ I mean as long as I didn’t tell you, it’ll be fine. I don’t want to get in trouble! (Laughs) But yes. She didn’t call me, but she called my man­age­ment and said, “do you think Giorgio’s inter­ested in doing that song?” I mean it’s a great song. I came up with the chords, I added some stuff that’s not on the original — a bridge, for instance. It’s more than just a remake. Then she called me and wanted me to go to the studio to record it, but I was on a plane to Europe so I didn’t record those vocals [in person]. But she’s coming back, hopefully in the next few days, to record that bridge that I did.  So it’s a cover but it’s also a new song?
I added quite a lot of stuff actually — one melody in the chorus, which repeats, and one bridge. It’s old, but I consider it a new song.  And Britney’s happy with it?
Oh I’m sure if she wasn’t, I’d know! On the first mix I sent her she had some comments, which I agreed. That was a song which a lot of musicians worked inde­pend­ently on — I had my version, which I did with Patrick [Jordan-Patrikios] my co-producer, but I was not happy with myself. So I gave it to a group of guys in Germany, then I wasn’t sure, so I gave it to another musician I liked, and then finally I got everything together and put it together. It’s like a worldwide connected internet song! But I’m going to see her soon, and I hope she finds time to do it! If she can’t sing that bridge, I’ll have to take it out. Could you add another featured artist to it, singing the bridge?
Now THAT'S an idea… To have a known singer, just to do the bridge. Hm. I’ll have to call my guys now. But who could it be? How about Lady Gaga?
I was supposed to be in the studio with her a week ago, but I got a cold. I’ll see her when I’m back. I have about five or six tracks, just basic ideas. Drums, keyboard, bass. I’m going to be surprised, I think — I don’t have a clue about the way she’s recording. Will she play the piano? Will I? So did she call you and say, “I want something that sounds like…”
No. I met her about two years ago. She loved me — the usual! (Laughs) And I did a remix for her last year — I did two versions and she took the more tra­di­tional of the two.  Are these sessions for her album, or yours?
This is for her new album — that’s the intention. I was hoping that maybe I can convince her to have one of the songs for my album. If I could convince her, well that would be incred­ible.  From what I’ve seen of her she can be quite spon­tan­eous — if the mood takes her to do something fun, she’ll do it.
Maybe! Maybe. If I have a good track that could fit my album but not neces­sar­ily hers, that could be ideal. What’s the best BPM?
Right now, 128. I love it. You mentioned earlier that you hadn’t done much for thirty years. But before that, you had a run where you were huge.
Yes, it was about ’76 to ’86 — about a decade.  And a decade’s still a long time, con­sid­er­ing most producers fall out of favour in half that time when scenes and sounds move on.
Yeah, but I could have done much better.  How?
Well, for instance, in ’82, I was on top of the world — but I decided I wanted to do art, so I moved to New York and did big neon art. If I’d wanted I could have worked so much more [on music], and probably better. Even before I retired, I was half-retired already: I had enough money, I had enough hits. But I’m sure I could have continued until now. Musically I know what I can do. When disco went out, I didn’t die! I mean Nile Rodgers is still sad that disco went out, because it was his life, but I went on to score movies, I did music for the Olympics, I did the World Cup… The Animals Of Farthing Wood!
Yes! I even did a religious song! Just a few years ago I was at a wedding in a church in Italy and people were singing it — I thought, “I know this song”. It was one of mine!  And you mentioned retire­ment. Did you formally retire? Some producers find that one day they notice that the phone’s not ringing as much as it used to. And then one day…
…it doesn’t ring at all. I mean with me, being between Los Angeles and Italy, going backwards and forwards, you lose contact. And with movie soundtracks, people don’t run after you if you’re not there. Unless you’re John Williams. So I was in and out and that was one of the problems. But even in '82 I never really wanted to. If Jerry Bruckheimer hadn’t begged me to do the music for Flashdance I’d probably still be in New York. I was kind of getting tired. And that’s when I faded out — but I was happy. Speaking of fades, of the five upcoming songs I’ve heard from your new album, four of them fade at the end.
You don’t like that? Obviously you’re the expert here but I do prefer songs that end with a bang.
Well I can remix them for you. But I couldn’t touch the Sia song — I can’t make a different ending for that. She would kill me. She’s in charge and that’s it. And the Kylie song's done. Er… How about the Charli XCX one, 'Diamonds'?
Yeah. I could do a different ending. Okay, I’ll do it for you. I’ll give you two actually — the Charli XCX song and there’s a great one with a girl called Marlene. Okay. I’ll rearrange two songs. And maybe the Britney Spears one too…  'Britney featuring Lady Gaga', don’t forget.
Do you really think I can ask her? Well she's hinted on Twitter that she still wants to work with Britney.
Can you imagine that she would just do an eight bar part? Hm… You did some occa­sional mixes here and there before the Daft Punk album put you back into the spotlight. Were there any points where you tried to get back into music properly, and found it harder than expected?
Not really. I think, by becoming a DJ before the Daft Punk album, I could probably have got some interest from some record companies anyway. In fact before Daft Punk I got an offer for an album, but it was an offer from Spain and I just didn’t want to do it. It came from a guy I didn’t like. So I said no! Obviously after Daft Punk I got those three major offers to make an album, and I decided to go with Sony.  When you were doing promo around the Daft Punk album you didn’t have a moustache. But now it's back! Is this your way of getting back into character?
That’s my wife! I hated that moustache. I had the moustache in the 80s, and I hated it even then but I couldn’t get rid of it. But then one day, I remember, I was in New York with a girl­friend, and she said to me, “why don’t you just cut it off?” And in a second, I did it. I’d been thinking of doing it for years, and suddenly it was gone. But my wife is the biggest fan of that moustache. She’s 22 years younger than me and in the 80s she was dancing to the sounds I made with a moustache. When I started again, she said, “Giorgio, you have to get your moustache back.” I said, “I don’t want to!” But she convinced me.  People do want the moustache. Your wife’s right about this.
I’ll tell you for sure, once I do finally retire, the moustache is going for good. There's a great story about when you first sent 'Love To Love You Baby' to Donna Summer’s record label. The head of the label played it con­tinu­ously at a party he was hosting, and I think it's fair to suggest that he and his guests were fairly 'refreshed' at this party. He sub­sequently asked you to make the song longer. When you sent him back a version that was 17 minutes long, were you taking the piss?
(Laughs) I LOVED the idea. Just the concept of having something new like that — nobody had one whole side of an album with one song. Secondly, it was rel­at­ively easy. And the fact that it was 17 minutes was the reason for its success. It was played in dis­cotheques and espe­cially in the gay community they LOVED it. I loved the whole thing. Do you think the Daft Punk album might have been better if there were more songs you could dance to?
It couldn’t have been much better because it was so good. But yeah, you’re right. Finally, are you familiar with the Glade Plugins — those things you plug into the wall, which squirt air freshener into your room?
Yes… Do you think it would be good if you could buy those, but rather than air freshener they were filled with poppers? And if when you walked past, they blasted out poppers and played the ‘I Feel Love’ riff? Instead of it being a room odoriser you could market it as a Room Morodorizer.
(Laughs) Is it dangerous? You’re talking about the one that gets your heart moving? I’ve used poppers once, maybe two or three times, in my life. It’s too much! How would this work? You would have it at home? Yes. Every time you walk past, no matter what time of the day or night, it bangs out a load of poppers and the ‘I Feel Love’ riff at full volume.
Er… No?
The problem is, surely you wouldn’t even notice it? You have to inhale the poppers, but they would come out near your feet. Maybe the idea needs some refine­ment.
Give me your phone number and let’s talk sometime. This could be the end of civil­isa­tion!  ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202804.80/warc/CC-MAIN-20190323121241-20190323143241-00406.warc.gz
17,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/articles/ill-stay-true-to-myself-for-my-entire-career-zara-larsson-is-back/,"Zara Larsson is — let's all be quite honest with ourselves here — one of the world's better popstars, and she returns this week with pens­ive­pop triumph Ruin My Life. Stand by for embedded audio, followed by an interview from earlier this week. The interview happened on the phone so feel free to insert all the standard ""curled up on the sofa"" / ""taking a sip of her drink"" / ""frowns"" interview stuff wherever you think it works best. The new single is great! It feels a bit like it combines some of the intimacy of your first album with some of the bombast of your second. That's a good way to describe it! I like that. I never really have a vision for my projects — it's never like I start something knowing the title, what I'm going for and what direction I'm going in. I never know. That's both a good and a bad thing — but all I do is look for really good songs, collect them, put them all together and make an album. That's really how com­plic­ated it is. So, not that com­plic­ated.  You've made it sound very simple but a lot of people still get it wrong. I think the trick is to keep it simple. I'm so good at over-thinking things so I try not to get stuck in that. I'll just go for it when it feels good, and it feels right. You feel it in your body. More than anything you should trust your gut and stay true to yourself, and be authentic, and if you do that everything just goes along with it. Hopefully. Do you think the music industry forces artists to unlearn that impuls­ive­ness? Like, there's a lot of second-guessing. You're right. There are so many people involved, usually, in a project. Especially if you're signed to a label. Everyone has their opinion: the radio and promo people, and the president, and managers and A&Rs. There are so many opinions! I'm lucky enough to work with people who really listen to me. But sometimes maybe there'll be a song I really like, and I'll record it, and I'll play it to people, and if I don't get the reaction I'm expecting then I'll doubt myself a bit. Even though I know it's a really good song. I'll think: ""Maybe not. Is it really good? Is it really what I thought it was?"" I suppose so much of what was once guesswork is just data now: evidence in black and white that certain songs will work, that songs need to do certain things to avoid being skipped, all that stuff.  Right. But you never really know. All these people at the label or at radio, they talk like they def­in­itely know what's going to be a hit and what's not. And some people have a really good ear, but to be honest they don't know if it will be a hit or not! THEY DON'T KNOW! They don't know if the people will like it, or if they'll stream or buy it, or if it will be a fluke… People don't know. I always remind myself of that when I lean towards thinking, ""maybe I should listen to this old guy who's been in the industry for forty years."" It's like, all the songs that have been really suc­cess­ful for me are songs I've believed in from the start and I've been pushing for. My first single I ever released, Uncover, is like 10x platinum in Sweden and nobody on my label wanted to release that. I had to fight for it. I had to say: ""This is a great song."" 1 At the time it wasn't a big thing to release songs without any drums. It had zero per­cus­sion or drums on it! Everyone was like, ""no, this isn't going to work."" I was going: ""It's such a good song!"" Camila Cabello was talking about this recently, about how Consequences was the last single from this album — a ballad with no drums. It doesn't sound like anything that's on the radio but sometimes that's what you need to go for. Of course the label wants a song that already sounds like everything else on the radio, but sometimes the biggest songs are what's NOT that: they're just a really good song. You mentioned your record label just then but you sort of have three, don't you — TEN in Sweden, Black Butter in the UK and Epic in America. Who's been most involved in the new album? It changes a bit. Or is has changed, from when I started. When I first started putting out music I worked really, really closely with TEN in Stockholm, I had my Swedish A&R… And then I started spending a lot of time in America, and so then it was my American A&R. This is my second inter­na­tional album and this is my fourth A&R on Epic — there are so many different people involved. I tend to always go back to the mother label which is TEN, but lately I feel like my closest team is my two managers — it's quite nice to not let all the other people always have a say, or for me not to have to deal with that. It's just trying to keep the circle a bit smaller, it works better that way. Today I visited the room where Zara Larsson’s Lush Life was written and for a split second everything in my life made sense. Presumably it was tidier when history was made all those years ago. Thanks @TENMusicGroup for the tour! pic.twitter.com/Ny4wVv3lUT — Peter Robinson (@Popjustice) September 26, 2018  I visited TEN when I was in Stockholm recently and they showed me the studio where Lush Life was written, and where I guess you've done a lot of work. The atmo­sphere must be quite different to the rooms in LA — which do you prefer?  I remember the first time I was in a big studio in LA. At one point I said something like, ""oh my gosh, I'm craving cookie dough so much."" Fifteen minutes later a runner appeared. A runner! We didn't have runners in the studio in Stockholm. Anyway, this runner appeared, in this big-ass room with this huge mixing table, and he had a really nice plate, and a lovely spoon, and a linen napkin. And there was cookie dough on the spoon. And I was like, ""WHAT?"" I was so not used to that sort of thing. I mean, it feels really good to work in those studios, but not because of that, or because of all the space, but because it will be like, ""oh, Michael Jackson recorded a song here"", or ""last week Beyoncé was here"", or you'll bump into Lady Gaga in the hallway. And there's an atmo­sphere of cre­ativ­ity, and [being around] people I look up to a lot. I do still record most of the songs in Sweden or London, but it's great vibes in those big studios. I can't lie. The thing is, I don't really care where I am as long as there's good people and a nice place to sit. A com­fort­able sofa.  Ruin My Life feels emotional but not in a straight­for­ward hi-I'm-a-love-song way. There feels like darkness to it: where did it come from? Absolutely, I can't lie: I've been there, when you're coming out of a bad rela­tion­ship and you just know this person is really bad for you, but you can't help wanting to go back. You're like: ""I know he'll ruin my life, he'll break my heart and I won't be able to eat or sleep for three months, but I WANT IT NOW."" I think everyone's been there. Or after two drinks you can't stop yourself sending the texts. But… I also argue against myself when it comes to songs. I'm very careful with things I say. And I don't want people — young girls and women — to listen to the song and… Like, I don't want to be a girl who promotes bad rela­tion­ships. ""Just go back to him, it'll be fine."" I don't want to do that. But I do also want to be an artist who can express something I'm feeling or that I've been through. It's inter­est­ing that you brought up that dilemma, because I was going to ask about it but you clearly already had it on your mind. And I suppose it's inter­est­ing mainly in the sense that many or most artists wouldn't neces­sar­ily consider how lyrics are received… That's def­in­itely something I was thinking a lot about. I got the song sent to me — I wasn't in the room when it was written — and I really liked it, but it was ori­gin­ally thought of as a duet. I love to col­lab­or­ate with people but I just didn't want it to be a duet. I wanted the first single from my new record to be just me. And it was very different when it was two people singing it: it had a different dynamic. When you took the other person off, it sounded like a really tragic story about a sad girl. It was quite violent at first, in the beginning — it was about this pas­sion­ate rela­tion­ship between the two people. It was quite dark. I changed the lyrics to make it a bit more emotional, I guess. At first it was like, ""I miss you throwing a fist through the wall"", and I was like, ""uh, no, I would never be with a person who does that, that's kind of abusive."" I'm very careful with what I talk about and how I say stuff, but I feel that with how I changed the song, it's now right in the middle of still being powerful, emotional and relatable, but still having a slight darkness about it. Just not too dark.  How important to you is it that the values you com­mu­nic­ate through inter­views and across your socials are reflected in your lyrics?  When I get sent a song that I didn't write from the beginning, I just know if I like it or don't like it. With Lush Life I didn't write a single word on that unfor­tu­nately, but I still love it. And I mean, some of the things I sing about have never happened to me, like She's Not Me… Well, now it's happened, but it hadn't when I sang it — I'd never been left for another girl. But the point is that with those lyrics I at least felt like I could say them as a person. As I grow as a person and as an artist I want to be a bigger part of it: my favourite thing is to start a song with the people in the room, and I really like to write. Lyrics aren't really my strong point if I'm honest, I love to do melodies and I'll help with lyrics but I know they're not my strong point — but at the same time I know what I want and don't want to sing. I love lyrics. I always look up lyrics to songs I like on Genius.com. And I have huge arguments about this with people from my label: they say nobody listens to lyrics. And I'm like, ""well I do!"" My one thing is: keep it cute, and don't be messy when it comes to rela­tion­ships with girls… That's my one rule. I don't want to break the code of feminism or something like that! You changed the Ain't My Fault lyrics for that reason, didn't you?  Absolutely, me and MNEK were just having a great time in the studio messing around and the label loved the song, but that version was so different from the version that's out now. It was about me stealing someone's man, but I didn't want to be that girl! I've never done that and I'd never talk to another girl saying ""sorry you're not me, sorry I'm hotter than you."" That's something I'm trying to stay true to… But then again, if that ever happened to me, or if I have a big fight with someone who happens to be a woman… Should I still tell my story? I don't know! It's always a battle between being the artist Zara and the 'me' Zara. Who else have you worked with on the album? When it comes to col­lab­or­a­tions nobody right now, I haven't thought about that at all. I'd want it to be with people I look up to or who feel genuine — not just ""I'm going to pay a rapper $500K to be on the song."" And I've been thinking about how all the people I've col­lab­or­ated with, who are all incred­ible, have been guys, except Grace in Clean Bandit. So it would be cool to do something with a girl. But it's hard to do those songs! Because most of my songs are about ""ooh, love, from a het­ero­norm­at­ive angle"". It doesn't even have to be about girl power, I just want to col­lab­or­ate with female artists. Charli XCX and I have been in the studio a lot together recently.  That Live Lounge you did with Dua, Charli, MØ and Alma was a real moment, I thought.   I was really happy when she called me and asked if I'd join her. I wasn't doing it for myself — like, ""yeah, I'm going to get so much publicity"" — it was just fun and I love all the girls we did with it. It was a really good time. It felt like: this is what a girlband could be like in 2018. I KNOW RIGHT? Going back to Ruin My Life, you've said that you kept changing your mind about what the first single should be. What else nearly made it? I think I have the next single lined up. I'm very excited about that. It's very different from Ruin My Life. It's called Don't Worry About Me and I guess you could say it's Ruin My Life Part 2, in that it could be following up the story. It's saying: ""don't worry about me, you should worry about you."" The idea is that now you're over this guy you're like, ""whatever, I'm over you, I don't care for you any more, I see you in my call list, why do you care?"" So you're over this guy now, hopefully. The pro­duc­tion is like housey dancehall, kind of in the world of Passionfruit by Drake. I love it and I'm very excited.  Correct me if I'm wrong but it feels like the process of making this album must be quite different to last time. In the sense that Lush Life's success was either an accident or a surprise, and it was followed by a period of trying to build an album and inter­na­tional artist launch around that success in real time…  It was SO messy. Really messy. Every territory in the world had a different opinion, of course. America [she seems to mean the American label rather than 325m people across fifty states] didn't like Lush Life at all! So we said, fuck it then, we'll just put it out in Sweden. So that's what we did. Then it took off in Sweden and spread to the Nordic countries, then France, then England literally a year after I released it. By that point Uncover became really big in France, and then at the same time Never Forget You became big… So it was a fucking mess and nobody was on the same page. Which was kind of fun, but also a bit annoying if you're trying to break it. In Europe Lush Life was a big success and I think it would have been in America too if they'd jumped on at the same time. They were just like ""uh, no"", and then when they saw people liked it, it was kind of too late. It's the same with Never Forget You: they were like, ""no, it doesn't sound like US radio, it's too European"", but then it got on the radio and people seemed to really like it. And it takes such a long time to get something on the chart in America! You have to do everything manually! You have to phys­ic­ally drive to all the places and be like, ""hi! Here's my song!"" It's def­in­itely a lot of work. Hopefully this time it will be the same song and everyone will be on board. I saw an interview with you where you were like, ""it's time to break America, I want to do numbers, I want to be massive"" and, well, first of all it struck me how refresh­ing it was for an artist to be straight­for­ward about their ambitions. But also: it must be difficult as a pop artist to have those ambitions and to also want to do something that's creative, when there are so many cheap shortcuts other people take.  It's tricky! I'm always joking and saying ""I can't wait until I'm really big so I can do whatever the fuck I want."" 2 Beyoncé is a great example: one of her best albums is Lemonade because it tells her story, from her marriage, and as a black woman, and it has such a deep meaning to it and it's kind of revolu­tion­ary… But it wouldn't have been the same thing if that had been her first [album]. If she wasn't the Beyoncé she is today, it wouldn't have been the same thing. I'm very lucky in the sense that I'm not doing stuff I don't want to do just to have a hit. But it's hard not to be an industry plant, but still to want to be com­mer­cially suc­cess­ful.    Of course, some people are happy to just do whatever it takes to be famous… Yes! Some people just want to sing on big stages and have hits and do big numbers but after a while, if that's what it's all about, you'll lose yourself when you don't have that any more. Everyone's careers have ups and downs, and hopefully mine will gradually go up and up, but even so you have your dips, and everyone has worst and best albums. If you're stuck on having Number Ones and sales, and if you're just obsessed with that after five albums, you're not doing it right. I think creative freedom comes with being suc­cess­ful, but I'll def­in­itely stay true to myself for my entire career. I don't see myself doing something I don't like just to prove myself to my label. That would be terrible: releasing something even I don't like, wanting com­mer­cial success, the song's a fucking flop, nobody likes it including me… That would be a terrible feeling! Also pop music fans are so soph­ist­ic­ated now that they see right through it. They know.  They do, def­in­itely. When's the album out? Next year, hopefully spring. I mean, we've been here before. 3 I know right! I don't dare to say a month because then people will hold me to it. It feels like there's more control this time. Yes. I feel very good. Very good about this whole thing. .

18,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/articles/interview-the-internet-versus-lily-allen/,"It's a Thursday afternoon, and Popjustice joins Lily Allen high above the streets of London. For this chat we have agreed to do an interview based on questions tweeted in by Popjustice readers. It is agreed by all parties that this will be jolly enter­tain­ing. A tweet is sent, alerting people to the existence of an interview scenario, and while we wait for questions to come in we start things off with some general chitchat. This is how it all unfolds. How ambitious are you? Sometimes you seem like you don’t give a fuck.
I do give a fuck. You know what, my new mantra is this: ANT AND DEC. Ant and Dec. I might get their names tattooed on each wrist. Because they smile, and they never complain, and it seems to work for them and I wish I could be more like that. My other mantra is that I don’t seem to have any long term goals, it’s not about world dom­in­a­tion, I just want enough people to buy this record for my record company to let me do it again. It’s a great job and I really enjoy the process of making music. And if I can keep doing that then I’ll be really happy. But you do see it as a job, rather than as some sort of calling or a thing you feel emo­tion­ally or spir­itu­ally compelled to do?
Well I think we all have to work. Just for our own sanity — we have to get up in the morning and do something. And this is the only thing that I know how to do. So yes I do see it as a job in a simple sense, but I also know that I’m really lucky to be able to do this for my job. There’s quite a lot of com­plain­ing on the album.
I didn’t really notice that until I did a track-by-track interview about it. (Laughs) “And this is ANOTHER one where I’m really grumpy and hate everyone…” I’m probably more moany on this record than I have been on past records because I wrote the majority of it while I was pregnant and hormonal and feeling a bit miffed at not seeing any of my mates, and none of my mates coming to see me. And having gone through some pretty shit stuff. So yes, I felt pretty moany. Do you think it’s inter­est­ing that one of the first popstars who arrived through the wonders of social media…
Hates it? Well, more that it seems like you live through social media, and your only con­nec­tion with where you came from is through other people’s Instagram and Twitter accounts? Is it quite tragic?
Yes it is tragic… But I don’t think it’s neces­sar­ily true. These days everything is driven by the internet. But there’s just so much shit on there that’s not real, you know? What’s your favourite least favourite Lily Allen fact off the internet?
I can’t think off the top of my head. But, like, Wikipedia is not a real reference. Just because something's on Wikipedia, THAT DOESN’T MAKE IT REAL! That’s what makes me come across as a cunt! I sit down in inter­views and people go “YOU SAID THIS!” and I’m like, “no! I didn’t say that! I was misquoted!” And they go “OOOH, ANOTHER ‘MISQUOTE’!” And I go, “but it WAS a misquote!” And so it continues. Is there anything you’d like to set the record straight on in this interview?
No! I don’t care any more! But I just find it odd. Odd and funny. And you say that I only exist in social media, but no. What you see of me only exists in social media. It’s the only place where you can see me. So are you saying the image you put across of yourself is dishonest?
No, but if you saw me in my house, then you’d see that what I put across on social media is perhaps 20% of my day, and the other 80% is changing nappies and doing bathtime and making dinner for my babies. I don’t tweet about that because some things should be left untweeted. But your big thing as a popstar seems to be “I am honest, this is me, I am very much on the level with my fans”… So is it therefore dishonest if you don't show parts of your life?
The reason I leave that stuff out is that there’s a sort of grey area within British media and the press: I don’t know where the line is drawn where my children are concerned. So I don’t mention their names in inter­views, I don’t put pictures of them online and I don’t talk about them on Twitter. Because I don’t think it’s my right to say that they’re for public con­sump­tion. It’s their lives. We all know that when children turn into teenagers they’ll throw any fucking thing at their parents, and I don’t want to be respons­ible for them screaming at me going “WHAT FUCKING GAVE YOU THE RIGHT TO MAKE ME FAMOUS?” Maybe they’ll be annoyed that you chose not to make them famous!
Maybe they will! And I can say, “if you want to be fucking famous go and do it yourself like your mum did.” What’s the best song that didn’t make the new album?
A song called ‘I Don’t Mind Babe’. What’s that about?
Some bitches. Specific bitches?
No. Bullying bitches. Nasty girls. Like school bullies, but grown ups. Which brings us to one song that is on the album: ‘URL Badman’.
Have you heard it? (Bursts out laughing) It’s not about you, honestly. It's a dis­missive song about online com­ment­at­ors — there's a line spoken from their per­spect­ive, ""it's not for me, it must be wrong"". What’s the dif­fer­ence between you ‘just being honest’, which seems to be the ultimate defence rolled out by people when they're being fucking rude, and the people you dislike also ‘just being honest’? Is having an opinion only alright if you're Lily Allen?
Well they’re just being driven by something else, which isn’t honesty as much as it’s about [website] hits. I’m already famous, I don’t need to pull people in. I don’t need to make a shock or a song or a dance about everything. If you were a suc­cess­ful artist returning to the world in 2006, and you saw new artists like Lily Allen coming through social networks like MySpace, you would probably have been a bit “I don’t under­stand this, what’s going on, I can’t get my head around it and these new artists com­pletely get it”. And now it's you coming back into a pop landscape that depends on an even more advanced version of all that. And I wonder if you look at artists who are digitally native pop acts… Well, do you feel separated from the pulse of pop in the same way an older artist might have in 2006?
I always found insin­cer­ity a bit difficult to sit with. When I look at other people’s Twitter feeds there’s a lot of that… Listen. I love my fans. They bought me my house. They pay for my children’s existence and I couldn’t be anything but grateful for everything they’ve ever given me and the oppor­tun­it­ies they’ve let me have. BUT. There’s something a little bit pat­ron­ising about telling people that all day every day. ‘Retweeting’ this, ‘favourite for this, retweet for that’. Who’s got the fucking time. Who’s actually got the time? And is it actually the person it seems to be? It’s the social media manager at the label.
Yes. What's the main dif­fer­ence between this album and your previous two releases?
The dif­fer­ence is that on my first two albums when I’m angry on those records it’s generally directed towards one person. Specific people who’d pissed me off, usually in the ‘love arena’. And happier and cheerier songs were on a larger scale — songs like ‘Everything’s Just Wonderful’ were directed at the world. Whereas this time round the happy songs are directed at my husband and family, and the angry songs are directed at the world. Who do you think is actually fine?
My husband. And Adele — I think she’s incred­ible, and I love the way she does things on her own terms. She did that before she was suc­cess­ful, actually — I have a lot of love and admir­a­tion and respect for her. She’s not scared of losing anything, you see — it doesn’t mean anything to her. She’s not mater­i­al­istic. It would be quite good if she beyoncéd an album.
If she what? Beyoncéd an album. Just suddenly released it.
I think she will do that. I have an inkling. Just a hunch?
Just a hunch. Based on nothing?
Based on nothing. What’s Adele’s new stuff like?
I have no idea. How many songs have you heard?
I… Haven’t heard any. (Laughs) It’s very difficult, in this post-Beyoncé landscape, for a pop fan to go to sleep at night. Is it safe to go to sleep tonight?
I think you can overthink these things. What Beyoncé did was amazing in a lot of ways just because it got everybody in a tizz. I have to say, I only listen to ‘Drunk In Love’. They spent a lot of money on that album and people spent a lot of money buying it, but I’m only listening to ‘Drunk In Love’. It was very clever. Apart from your husband and Adele, who do you like?
Who else do I really like and think is doing great? I’ll tell you who’s been getting a hard time: that Michael McIntyre. I really like his chat show. Really?
I enjoy it! Are you just saying this because it makes you feel better about your own chat show?
No, I just think… Well, I sometimes peruse the Daily Mail of an afternoon. And I can see when people are gone for, just because viewing figures haven’t been ‘suc­cess­ful’ even though they don’t work in TV and have no real idea what a good viewing figure is. People who are good at what they do, they’re just getting on with it… There’s something about us as British culture that we like to just drag those people through some shit. So you like your husband, Adele, and Michael McIntrye?
Yes. That’s it?
That’s it! Everyone else is a cunt! Oh, I like Beyoncé as well. You mention Beyoncé on your album, in ‘Come On Over’.
A few people have said to me, “you’re going to piss off so many people by namecheck­ing this person and that person” and I think, “well, yes”, but I’ve always made a thing of social com­ment­ary and com­ment­ary on pop culture, and I don’t think you can do that unless you namecheck the people at the forefront of that culture. Actually I still need to write letters to Rita Ora and Cara Delevingne. In actual fact the song where I appear to slag off Rita and Jordan ['Insincerely Yours'] is very much the same premise as ‘Cheryl Tweedy’ all those years ago. It’s not about them, it’s about the idea of them — how the media perceive them. It’s about how the way the media perceive them as entities and how that actually has nothing to do with how they are in real life. And Delevingne rhymes with magazine. You're actually going to write a letter saying no really, it’s fine, your name just rhymes with magazine?
YES! (Laughs) Shall we have some ‘reader questions’?
Yes.  I will hopefully continue to make music. Depending on what?
My record company picking me up for another option. How likely is that?
Ask me in a month. No actually, I will always make music. Whether it’s under the Lily Allen ‘brand’ or not. Actually the dream for me is to write musicals. How’s the Bridget Jones musical going?
It’s finished and it’s brilliant. But I don’t know if it will ever see the light of day. Why?
I cannot divulge. What’s the best song you’ve written for Bridget Jones?
It’s called ‘Yummy’ and it’s Bridget singing to a fridge. A love song to a fridge.
Yes.  Lily is coming to France on Monday, so yes.  FLEET. No, actually, Chieveley. It’s where I get my last coffee just before I go home. It’s got a drive-thru Starbucks.  Seven. Ten being covered in crap.  ‘Frozen’. Would you like to work with William Orbit?
I’d prefer to work with Stuart Price. Why haven’t you?
I don’t know. I was sitting next to him at the Brit Awards and found him to be a truly jolly fellow. He is, by literally all accounts, a joy to work with. Maybe you could do a disco album with him.
If enough people buy this one I’ll give it a go!  I wouldn’t say that was sweet. I’d ask how they got into my dressing room!  No, but I will refer you to ‘Insincerely Yours’ and hope that you enjoy that just as much. A lot of people are just asking for your favourite song off ‘Sheezus’.
Well, it’s ‘Sheezus’. Do you like the title? I thought it was a joke to start with.
I’m still LOLing to myself. I think it’s hilarious. Some people are just so offended by it, it makes me laugh how up in arms people get about these things. [At this point please note that in typically unpro­fes­sional fashion we can't now find all the relevant Twitter questions for screen­grabbing purposes so basically if you see a blue bird it's a question off Twitter.] Are you okay with ‘Our Time’ being a single?
Yes! (Pulls face) ‘Pulls face’ in brackets.
Love it. If you didn’t have to sell any records to people, what would the first three singles have been?
‘Hard Out Here’, ‘Sheezus’, ‘Insincerely Yours’. Or ‘Close Your Eyes’. Or ‘As Long As I Got You’. 'Pure Shores' or 'Black Coffee'?
Black Coffee. It’s one of my most played on iTunes. Are there any sad songs you can dance to on 'Sheezus'?
Sad songs you can dance to? The best type of song. Robyn does those well.
‘Hard Out Here’? That’s a sad song. Because it’s about something that’s quite sad. And it’s danceable, I think. Can you rank your albums 1–3? Which is best?
Well I thought they were all the best at the time of release but I’d say this one, ‘Sheezus’, is Number One, ‘It’s Not Me, It’s You’ at 2 and ‘Alright, Still’ at 3. What’s the best advice you’ve ever been given?
Just to be nice to people on the way up because they’re the ones who’ll be there for you on your way down, which is inev­it­able. It happens to everyone. Are you on your way up or your way down at the moment?
I don’t know. I’m figuring that one out. I’m surfing the wave between success and failure, and praying for a good outcome. Can you do Eurovision next year please?
No. Has there ever been a point…
No. …where you’ve thought…
No. ""Maybe I could do Eurovision”?
No. No. Just, no. Who prepares your tax return?
O J Kilkenny Associates, although I did get one of those letters yesterday that said something about self assess­ment. In the bin. Why did you release ‘Hard Out Here’ while ‘Somewhere Only We Know’ was still riding high in the charts?
The record company came to me with the idea of doing ‘Somewhere Only We Know’ and there was a nego­ti­ation between me and the record company: I said, “okay, I will do ‘Somewhere Only We Know’, for which I will not take a fee and will probably see no financial gain, only if you pay for a video for ‘Hard Out Here’ just for it to appear in its viral capacity.” Well that went well.
Well I think it did actually. If you look at the thumbs up versus thumbs down on YouTube, there are more thumbs up than there are thumbs down. So you didn’t want to do ‘Somewhere Only We Know’?
No, I did. I knew that ‘Hard Out Here’ as a song — before the video was shot — was one of the more important moments on the album. But I also thought that because it had the word ‘bitch’ on it, it wasn’t going to get played on the radio. So the only place for it to exist was on the internet in a viral capacity, but I wasn’t going to be able to get the label to pay for a video unless I had some kind of bar­gain­ing tool. So when John Lewis came along and said “would you pitch for this?”, I was like, “yes, if you guys put up the money for this”. And they said, “yeah, yeah, sure we will, oh hang on we haven’t got any money so let’s get E-Lites and Beats By Dre and a load of other people to pay for it instead.” (Laughs) I do actually really like ‘Somewhere Only We Know’, and it’s come in handy for those little acoustic gigs. 
No. Because I don’t think we exist on levels, I think we exist in our own right. But you could say, for instance, Katy Perry, Lady Gaga and Rihanna are all on a certain level. And…
Do you know what, I don’t want to hear this! (Laughs) I don’t want to know! The thing is I don’t really put people in bands. I’m sure the marketing people at my label could tell you exactly what level I’m on, but I don’t want to know about it. Have you ever had any market research done about yourself?
I acci­dent­ally got copied in on a whole bunch of it and reading it was one of the most horrible moments of my life. They don’t actually tell the people what it is that they’re listening to. So a lot of it was just people going “is this Lily Allen? IT FUCKING IS LILY ALLEN”. “IF THIS IS HER I THOUGHT SHE’D FUCKING RETIRED THE STUPID CUNT!” (Laughs) This is about six months ago, too, so it really set things off well. The thing is, people who take part in market research: are they really rep­res­ent­at­ive of the mar­ket­place? Probably not. I find that kind of thing really inter­est­ing.
I find it totally unhelpful. My mum’s a film producer and they do these market research screen­ings, and more often than not it’s just like school — people don’t have opinions but because they’re asked for them they come up with something and then it becomes a statistic. It’s like, he didn’t actually think that, he was just trying to impress the bored-looking girl on Row 3 and he thought this could be his in with her. I’m yet to see an example of market research where it’s actually good. Is that fringe the basis of a timeshare arrange­ment with Jessie J?
Yes. I’m now bisexual. The fringe and sexuality are inter­linked, we’re going to swap back and she’s going to be bisexual again when her fourth single is out, and I get my fringe back. What’s your favourite beverage?
Vodka, and tea. I do like a vodka and soda water at the end of a long day. How do you stop your fringe getting greasy?
There’s been much talk of my greasy fringe on the Mail Online comments section. People are always talking about how grubby I look and how greasy my fringe is. (Laughs) It’s the source of much amusement for me and my husband. Why do people care about my fringe? Dry shampoo kind of works but I’d have to do it three times a day — I’ve got quite a big forehead, you see, and the sweat from my forehead goes into the fringe. So if you had a smaller spam this might not be a problem?
Well I can only speak from my own exper­i­ence but I imagine if my forehead was slightly smaller… Well, maybe I wouldn’t even have a fringe, it’s only there to cover up my forehead. How much smaller, in cen­ti­metres, would you like your forehead to be?
A LOT SMALLER. Do you like the Rita Ora single?
Yes, I think it’s great. Air Balloon would have suited her quite well.
Do you think? (Pointed pause) Would you like to write for other artists?
I have! I wrote ‘Mr C’ for Nina Nesbitt, which is her next single I think. I wrote it with Steve Mac and Karen Poole. Beyond Nina Nesbitt is there anyone in the world of pop you’d like to write for?
Well! I ‘may’ have a pseudonym. I ‘may’ have a writing name, and I ‘may’ have written other songs! Has that happened?
I don’t want to divulge. This is an interview. Answer questions. Has that happened?
Yes. With whom?
I’m not going to tell you. Male or female?
I’M NOT GOING TO SAY! A band?
You really care! (Chortles) One day you’ll find out. Is ‘one day’ a clue?
(Shrugs elab­or­ately, pulls frog face) Is it actually a good song? Or was it just so shit that you wanted your name off it?
(Elaborate shrug, frog face) Is this all bollocks?
(Another elaborate shrug, ludicrous frog face) COME ON! MOVE IT ON! NEXT QUESTION! Okay. But has it come out in the last twelve months!
SHUT UP! SERIOUSLY! (Pause) It might be more than one… If I tweet you a link to a song will you admit if it’s you?
(Olympic-standard shrug and frog face) WHAT AN ARSEHOLE!
DID YOU JUST SAY ‘WHAT AN ARSEHOLE’? You are being delib­er­ately arseholey about this.
I am. To conclude, then, is there anything you would like to say to the people of Popjustice?
Yes: come on guys, don’t spend as much time on Popjustice. There’s more to the world than that. (Laughs) Now that was arseholey. ■ 'Sheezus' is out May 5, and you can pre-order it on iTunes now.

19,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/articles/interview-william-britney-jean/122053/," Last week we went to LA to attend Britney's 'Britney Jean' album playback thing. Clips of all the songs leaked while we were on the plane, and at the playback itself they only played a handful of songs and faded two of those down halfway through, so it was a bit of a strange affair but one amazing thing that did happen involved will.i.am. As you well know, will.i.am is executive producer on 'Britney Jean', so we wanted to have a chat with him about his involve­ment. With popstars like Britney you sometimes find out more about an album from the people around them than you would do by asking the popstar to their face. We'd never met will.i.am before. It turns out he's really funny and just a Generally Nice Guy. It made us feel a bit bad about disliking the bad bits of his 'oeuvre', but it also made us feel a bit better about liking the good bits. Example of will.i.am being a Generally Nice Guy: in the room where we did our interview — a recording studio — there was only one chair. But near the chair there was also a raised platform a bit like a stage which was about a foot off the ground. We said we’d perch on the edge of the stage so that will.i.am could sit on the chair because that seemed like the polite thing to do, but Will seemed to find that idea a bit silly and quite happily came and just sat next to us on the stage. Most big artists would have just taken the chair. It's hard to think of a single one who wouldn't, in fact. And that seems like a minor thing but it's minor things that add up and make all the dif­fer­ence, right? Also we were only supposed to have a few minutes with him but he just kept chatting, then even after we'd finished talking about the Britney album he continued talking and — just as strange as the chair thing — started asking us questions about what we did, and about London, and things like that. (Popstars are usually not very inter­ested in the people around them, and rarely even pretend to be.) So basically will.i.am is great and here's the chat we had about the album.   Who’s in charge of this album, you or Britney?
She’s in charge. The artist is always in charge. Right.
So executive producer means trying to keep it as organised as possible. It’s about who’s organ­ising it, who’s going out and finding things. And if she doesn’t want to… Well, I have to be the bad guy, to break the news to folks who don’t make the record. And there have been quite a few this time round, haven’t there?
These are all her decisions. Executive producers don’t have the final decision, the artist always does. I try to be the executive producer that I wish we would have doing a Peas record, or doing a solo record for me. Because executive producers can have different agendas. It seems like some executive producers see their role as a chance to dominate, or put their own per­son­al­ity all over someone’s project. And if this is indeed supposed to be a personal album then that’s quite difficult.
Well yeah. So with an album you have the producer, or the producers. And you have the label, and the A&R. And the executive producer sits in the middle of all those chefs. Or chiefs. They bring organ­isa­tion to what can be chaotic. And you feel that you’ve achieved a sense of clarity with this album?
Yeah. Clarity. And when it’s in my hands, there’s no leaks. As soon as you give it away, the leaks happen. If it was up to me, there would BE no leaks. I’m like, “I told you guys to leave it with me!”. And leaks of unfin­ished songs must be even harder to deal with than leaks of a final mix.
Yeah. And we have a while to go before it comes out. So… That’s always the hard part. Can you become friends with someone when you’re playing this sort of role, or do you have to keep your emotions separate?
Yeah, it’s all friendly. It’s just about structure. It’s like: one hard drive. In the studio. “No, you’re not coming in with your hard drive, we have to record on one hard drive only.” It’s that kind of stuff. Talking to studio managers saying “you can’t charge me an arm and a leg, I work with the Peas there, you can’t give me no bunk ass deal, we want to keep our costs low so she makes money”. That’s the sort of thing an executive producer does — nego­ti­at­ing deals. It’s executive work. Not creative. That’s why it’s called EXECUTIVE producer. A lot of the time people think it means you’re in there making creative decisions. No. You’re making the artist more com­fort­able when there’s a whole bunch of other chefs — and chiefs — in the room. You’re con­trolling egos. “Nuh-uh homey, you can’t come in here with all that bullshit, you’ve had TWO HITS.” “Actually you have no hits, but that’s a nice beat.” “That topline’s amazing, how about we put that topline and put it on that.” “You don’t like that? Okay cool, I’ll shut up, just tell me what you want me to do.” It’s sug­gest­ing things. What is Britney Spears doing 25 years from now?
TWENTY FIVE YEARS? Do you know what the world is doing 25 years from now? Well you should know, you’ve been on the cover of Wired!
Well 25 years from now, first off (points at plug socket on wall) those plugs are gone. Everything is a computer. Your jacket: that’s a computer in 25 years. I mean, 25 years ago, there were no smart­phones. There was no Google. There was no iTunes. There was no iPod or iPhone, no touch­screens. 25 years ago, there were only landlines. 25 years ago, only some hotels had the Internet. So 25 years from now, you don’t have the Internet. You have THE MESH. Yes but is Britney still singing in 25 years?
Are HUMANS singing in 25 years? I mean come on man! The world is crazy. Do you think Britney would like to still be singing in 25 years?
(Epic pause) Yeah. YES. She’s going to be singing. I’ll be almost 60, dude. [He'll be 63.]
 What did you find out about Britney Spears while you were making this album?
How focused she is when she’s working. How dedicated and dis­cip­lined she is. Did that surprise you?
Well, most artists aren’t like that. I don’t want to name artists but Britney is the most focused and dis­cip­lined of all the artists in the industry. Why do you think that is?
(Laughs) Because she’s a pro! But aren’t there loads of pros in the industry?
No. Those aren’t pros. Britney’s a pro. Her time is valuable: she has kids. And a lot of the time with an artist they’ll go into the studio, they’ll sit around, they’re watching TV, they order some food, they’re giggling and joking, they’re searching and listening to other people’s songs, they finally get to work then they take a break, they order some food, their friends come… And that happens for four or five months, sometimes eight months. Britney’s like: “I’m coming in from 2pm until 6pm.” She’ll arrive at 1.30, and from 2 to 6 she’ll be like BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM. BAM BAM BAM BAM. BAM BAM. I’ve never seen anything like that. Her work ethic is pretty admirable. Is having this involve­ment with a Britney album the dream job for someone like you? Would most people jump at this chance or would some people back away?
Executive producer is a hard role. If it’s a success, the executive producer does not get the credit. If it’s a failure, “IT’S THE EXECUTIVE PRODUCER’S FAULT!”. You’re either the last to be acknow­ledged or the first to be acknow­ledged. And I know that, because I’ve been on the other side, as an artist! But I like Britney. I just love her ded­ic­a­tion and love for music. That’s just the way it is. I love how sweet she is, and how genuine she is. Shy, but fierce. And I want to see her win.

20,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/articles/kylie-minogue-interview-2012/," Hello Kylie. Obviously the K25 business has been a way of showing everyone what you’ve done over the last quarter of a century but has it also been a way for you to take stock of it for yourself?
I’ve tried, I’ve really tried. But even when you say ‘quarter of a century’, it's hard to get your head around that. It’s like, ‘really?’. How did it happen! It’s hard to grasp everything you’ve done: everything that’s good about what you’ve done, everything that sucked about what you’ve done, oppor­tun­it­ies you’ve missed, and ones you’ve grabbed, and ones where it’s taken years after the fact to realise what an amazing moment it was. It’s actually been a tough year, but it’s been a rewarding year too. With things as random as the Anti Tour and Proms In The Park, which I loved equally. Perhaps one thing I’ve realised this year is that I’m defined by the variables that I am. I’m not just one thing. Last time we spoke, you talked about the table-thumping that happens at your record label when you release an album. Have you table-thumped this time round?
The only table-thump for ‘The Abbey Road Sessions’ was to include ‘Flower’, because the concept of the album was that it was all about hits. But it just seemed like it was ‘Flower’’s time. We recorded it and it was beautiful and there was a little table-thump about that. ‘Guys, come on, it’s got to be on the album.’ It’s quite a hard song to listen to, was it hard to write?
I think it… Hm. (Thinks) It didn’t take long. I'd written the lyrics, and [producer 'extraordin­aire'] Steve Anderson says I arrived at the studio in a bit of a strop that day. Of course I don’t recall it that way at all. (Laughs) But we had a day together in this little writing studio and he said, ‘okay what have you got?’. I'd written these lyrics, and I was a bit dis­missive of them. I didn’t know if they were just too deep, or too personal, or whatever. And I sang it through to him, and he put some chords to it. And that was that. Actually the other song we did that day was ‘That’s Why They Write Love Songs’, which again was just from scrawls in my book. So I wouldn’t say 'Flower' was that hard to write, I probably enjoyed writing down what my feelings were about that subject. But if I’d been in with another producer I don’t think I would even have mentioned those lyrics on that page — Steve Anderson was the only person I’d share that with. And what about the hits you've re-recorded for the album — do you think the songs sound better like this?
I think… Hm. (Thinks again) I guess it depends which frame of mind you’re in. If you want to hear “EGHH-URGGH-EGHH-URGHH” — ‘Hand On Your Heart’ — you’re probably going to be a bit dis­ap­poin­ted with this one. But I think it sounds like we hoped it would sound. It still amazes me that how you translate a song makes such a dif­fer­ence. I mean we know that ‘…Lucky’ has been done as a torch song since 1998, but ‘Never Too Late’ is just so sad with the piano. So sad. Don’t you think it was always sad though? Why do people need a song to sound sad in order to hear that it is sad?
Well pop just seduces you in such a way that you bounce along singing these lyrics being fooled that you have a great time. Nick Cave said something great about ‘Better The Devil You Know’ — I forget the exact quote but it was something wise about a wolf in sheep’s clothing. Has doing songs like this changed how you feel about them, or did you know what they were about all along?
Well, ‘Never Too Late’ for instance was done so early on in my career that I was just bracing myself and trying to spit out the lines and get it done. There wasn’t much emoting happening. So that song was a rev­el­a­tion to perform in this way. To really mean what I was saying and feel what I was singing. Do you think pop artists have a harder time than rock artists when it comes to the second half of their career?
Possibly yes — with rock artists, the more wrinkly they are the cooler they are! (Laughs) Rolling Stones, U2, they’re the greatest and they’re still doing it and that’s incred­ible… I guess you’ve got Barbra Streisand as well. I love to see older per­formers still going at it. Tom Jones is probably the one for this country — just to be on The Voice every week, and have more energy than most younger artists. I don’t know what I’ll be doing at that stage. My friends all scoff — they say, ‘come, of course you’ll be doing something’. So we’ll see. With popstars it feels like there’s a constant expect­a­tion that they’ll reinvent them­selves, and that they need to keep proving them­selves, through­out their career. Which perhaps isn’t quite the same for a rock artist where you can just keep going until you fall over.
And then even falling over is good for the image! I do think it’s different, yes. You know when you were being intro­duced at the Q awards the other day? And obviously Al Murray was in character as The Pub Landlord or whatever, but the intro was all very ‘here she is, pretty Kylie, I fancy Kylie right lads’ and I wondered if that sort of thing gets a bit boring for you after 25 years of it, and if you think ‘yes well hang on I am more than a pretty face actually thanks’?
Um… I think in that situation he’s just — as a performer — trying to get through. As I was going up the stairs, and as I got closer to him, in that split second you’re just two per­formers just trying to get by and do what you need to do. And that’s totally fine. And with him being in character I was just glad I didn’t get drenched in beer!  So no, that didn’t really bother me. Was it easier to be a popstar in the 80s than it is now? It seems like quite hard work these days.
Oh I don’t know about that… We all have rose-tinted glasses when it comes to the past. It seems like it must have been easier, but at the time… Well, I don’t even remember half of it because I was going so fast and I was doing so much. I guess the measuring stick was more obvious. You knew where you were — you knew how well you were doing based on how many you’d sold. And nowadays that’s not so true. But I just remember being really busy. It took longer to write and send a fax than it does to punch out an email, and it took equally as long to fly around the world and promote. It feels like when you first came out the job of the popstar was to make music then promote and tour it, whereas now you need to be a brand and align yourself with other brands and all that sort of thing.
That’s more part of it now, yes. You’ve actually just reminded me of the first video — ‘Locomotion’ — they had to do an endorse­ment in that. It was Impulse spray! (Laughs) And now it’s such a common thing. Another thing you said when we last spoke for Popjustice was that the reason you’d made another album, ‘Aphrodite’, was that when you come off tour and you step outside the pop bubble there’s paperwork and real life that needs to be dealt with. And reading back through it the other day, it seemed quite sad, as if you were saying you didn’t know how to operate without a pop structure around you.
Yeah, I guess you could see it as a bit sad. Is it sad?
I think it’s a little bit­ter­sweet. Let me put it this way: there’s a middle ground which I’m sure is a better, healthier, more balanced place to be. But instead of that I tend to do 'busy busy busy', then adren­aline gets you going, and you’re firing on all cylinders, and then you have to stop because you get ill, or you catch a cold and you’re out for a week. And then all you can do is rest. And then that creates a little depres­sion. It’s the classic performer’s quandary. That middle ground is hard to find, or settle in. This is why people do loads of drugs isn’t it?
Yes! Exactly. Did you always feel to com­fort­able in that pop bubble?
I think as the years go by… Well, in the early days of my touring I didn’t have a clue what I was doing and I was con­stantly petrified, but touring from 2000 onwards I’ve started to feel like I’ve become competent. You need to go through all the crappy stuff to gain that exper­i­ence, and then you want to that exper­i­ence. You want to put it out there again and enjoy having traipsed through all the crap. So was there a precise point when you felt like the crappy stuff had finished and you’d taken control?
I would say… Well, even with the ‘Fever’ tour, as proud as I was of that tour I was still a little uncertain on stage. So it probably wasn’t until after being ill, coming back onto the road after the ‘Showgirl’ tour stopped. I certainly wasn’t 100%, but by that point I just thought, ‘fuck it’. I thought, ‘I just can’t worry that much, people are enjoying it, I love doing it, so I owe it to myself to try and enjoy it and let go’. In anything you do, the more relaxed you are the better you will be. That’s what I try to do. Well, that’s the idea anyway. I’ll still get stressed about a show, but it was around then that I started to accept who I am. This is who I am, this is where I’m good, this is where I’m not so good, this my voice. As far as live shows go, I still had that monkey on my back from the very beginning about my voice. Aside from it getting better over the years, and me learning how to use it, and having trained myself and knowing tech­nic­ally what to do, I had to accept it before I could let it be. Getting to 'The Abbey Road Sessions', I don’t think I could have recorded this album ten years ago. It took until now for me to feel fully confident. It took until now for me to be myself. Making and releasing this album does seem like a confident move — it's not the sort of thing an artist would do if they felt they were on the back foot.
(Going off on tangent) If it’s a song that I’ve written like ‘Love At First Sight’ or ‘Wow’ or any of those ones, because I’ve done the original delivery, it sounds like me. Whereas with songs that have arrived as a demo, I’m such a good mimick that I can easily sound more like the demo singer. And because the producer, label and I have heard it a certain way on the demo, it stays that way. I don’t know why I just thought of that, but there you go. If you were to write a pop rulebook, what would Rule One be?
OH PETER! That’s really hard. I’m strug­gling to find a good answer. ‘Be yourself’ is a good start though. You mentioned Tom Jones on The Voice earlier. Why have you always said no to being a judge on TV talent shows?
Well I’ve def­in­itely con­sidered them, and I’ve def­in­itely lost sleep over the ‘should I or shouldn’t I’ question. There’s something in me that’s so far said no — whether it’s the com­mit­ment that’s required or something else… If for some reason, say someone dropped out, and I had to just step in, I would do it and probably really enjoy it and get really involved. But it’s the thinking about whether to do it or not that’s probably more difficult than actually doing it. I guess if it had been a one-off, never-to-be-repeated thing then I would have said yes, but I know that those shows are going to be around for a long time, so… So ‘keep asking’ is your message to the world of TV?
Yes! (Laughs) Perhaps… I mean I’m a fan of those shows and of course your Twitter action is as much fun as watching the show itself, and I’m often on the couch shouting out what I want the judges to be saying. But it’s very easy to be a couch par­ti­cipant. When you're in the moment and when you’re actually on live TV, it’s a lot harder to be in that seat. Whether it spins or doesn’t spin. What’s the ultimate Kylie song?
IMPOSSIBLE QUESTION ALERT! Let’s say we’re putting popular culture in a capsule to send into space, which one song do you put forward?
You’d probably have to put ‘Can’t Get You Out Of My Head’ in there, wouldn’t you? It’s literally a good song.
It really defines that time and I think it’s more of its time than, for example, my 1987 ‘Locomotion’. What’s happening with EMI? Are you going to Universal? I’m confused.
Well there’s going to be a car boot sale. (Chortles) I actually don’t know the latest. I believe it’s still in limbo but I think Parlophone will remain as a unit, so… We’ll see. Is it a bit like being picked for teams in PE? 
I was always one of the last to be picked for teams at school. I was too small. Hey — unless you’re looking for a wing attack in netball, in which case I’m your gal. There seems to be a strange sense of finality to all this K25 stuff. Is this going to be the last time I ever interview you?
No! I don’t think so… Is this Abbey Road album a full stop or an ellipsis?
I don’t think it’s a full stop, no… You don’t think so?
I’m sure it isn’t. Basically if you’re sitting there doing a pros and cons list for carrying on and one person’s opinion is going to sway things then you can put me down in the ‘let’s have some more Kylie’ camp.
Well I think there’s more. Recently, with Steve Anderson, I was putting together the setlist for Abu Dhabi — I’m going to be doing a show there soon [WITH NICKELBACK] — and I’m not promoting a par­tic­u­lar album, I’m just playing a bunch of hits. And Steve said, ‘okay, which songs are going in?’. And I sat there with a pen and paper and I was trying to remember all my hits. And I looked at the list. And I went, ‘hm, that’s quite a good list’. And I afforded myself a little pat on the back. But I also thought that there’s a lot that isn’t on that list, because I do feel that there’s more to come. There’s something more spec­tac­u­lar to come. I really do think that. Making it or finding it is a challenge — but I’m always up for a challenge. I’d love to go the next level. Blimey.
Is that reas­sur­ing enough? Actually, I think I’ve just reassured myself… * 'The Abbey Road Sessions' is out now. Full details at kylie.com/abbeyroadsessions.

21,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/articles/lauren-aquilina-interview-im-seeing-this-as-completely-starting-again/,"""Sorry about the con­struc­tion noise — they're knocking down the whole of fucking London around here."" Lauren Aquilina is speaking to Popjustice from a balcony, but not like that bit in Evita. Partly because she's in Acton, and partly because in this instance she's only on the balcony because there's no mobile signal in her apartment, and her BT line isn't working. She's been on the phone to BT all day, she says. This is not how popstars should spend their time. Mind you, two years ago it seemed as if Lauren's popstar days were done. After the release of her album Isn't It Strange?, the 21-year-old singer announced her retire­ment from music in an emotional post, telling fans: ""I've known for a good few months now that this 'Lauren Aquilina' album was not only going to be the first, but also the last."" On the topic of being a full-time artist she acknow­ledged that ""the cons now outweigh the pros and I've been pretty unhappy for a long time""; she was relieved, she added, ""to be able to leave something behind that no longer makes me happy."" In another part of the note, she wrote: ""Although this industry isn't an easy ride for anyone, the truth is I'm not sure I was ever cut out for the pressure of being an artist. When I realised what a negative impact my career was having on my mental health, I realised something needed to change."" Long story short, her excellent new Psycho's single's out tomorrow and it sounds like the YouTube embed below. Keep scrolling to read about how Kylie Minogue unwit­tingly helped turn things around, Lauren's failed attempt to become an air steward, and the tax benefits of crying on doorsteps. You've got a new single out! I thought this wasn't going to happen again. And for a long time, I guess, you thought the same thing? I did. I really, really did. I promised myself! I promised myself this would never happen again, but here we are. Let's do some scene-setting here. Do you remember where you were when you made the decision to leave music? The moment it clicked was the morning my album came out. I woke up alone in my apartment, and I was so depressed. I thought: ""This isn't what it's supposed to be like — when your album comes out it's supposed to be a happy thing."" But I felt so shit. I didn't want to ruin music for myself or be bitter about it. I thought: ""I've got to get out now."" It's not unusual for artists to feel a sense of anti­cli­max when a debut album comes out, but the situation was clearly very different in your case. The anti­cli­max thing was def­in­itely a big part of it — I'd built it up in my head to be this amazing thing. I'd been telling people when I was five years old that I was going to sign a record deal, not that I under­stood what 'record deal' meant. Then when I did sign one, for about a week I was like: ""Great! I've made it! Career sorted."" Obviously I quickly realised that of course when you sign a record deal that's when the actual work starts. I felt like my team had a lack of faith in me, I had a lack of faith in me, nobody really believed it; it felt like a very forced thing and it didn't feel fun. I'm still proud of the album and there are songs on there I still love, but musically now I've come on in leaps and bounds in terms of creating the thing I actually wanted to create. Before, there was always an element of com­prom­ise. Can you remember how you felt as soon as you'd posted on your socials saying ""album's out, I'm off""? A huge weight had been lifted. I was so relieved. Everyone was really nice about it. I thought I'd get mean tweets — ""you ungrate­ful bitch! Why are you giving up a record deal!"" — but everyone was very under­stand­ing, and it opened up a con­ver­sa­tion for me about mental health in the music industry. I ended up going on BBC Breakfast and talking about that, and it was good to end up being part of that dis­cus­sion. my @BBCBreakfast interview (as filmed by my mum 💙) part one: pic.twitter.com/QBTsYSc5AQ — Lauren Aquilina (@laurenaquilina) November 2, 2016  It was only a couple of years ago but it feels like even in 2016 people were reluctant to speak frankly about how the music industry deals with young creative minds. In 2018 it feels as if labels and managers better under­stand the duty of care they have, but the con­ver­sa­tion was in a very different place two years ago. Yes, it felt like a com­pletely different time. I'm glad people are talking about it now. It feels like the whole music industry is different now too, actually — 2017 felt like a weird, cursed year, where the UK didn't break any artists and the labels didn't quite under­stand how to make the most of streaming. It feels like everything is in a better place now. In the note you wrote in 2016 you talked about how much money had to be spent on launching an artist, and how lack of radio support could kill a career. Both those things are still true to an extent but since then the continued rise of streaming seems to have made a huge dif­fer­ence to both those things. It's all in a much better place now. It's back in the artist's hands now, a bit. You don't need loads of money and loads of backing to make something good and for it to get traction online. Which is very cool. Over the last two years how have things changed for you? How did you come round to thinking, ""actually, maybe I do want to go back into this shitshow""? Well. I was going to quit forever. I was applying to be an air hostess at the end of 2016, and— Hold on, we need to talk about this. Had air hostess always been Plan B? To be honest, I was just really having a crisis. There was an element of wanting to be running away, and being able to be far away. That was appealing for me. I mean, air stewards do always have to come back on another flight. That's kind of part of the job. Yeah, that's true. I wasn't really thinking about it. I was thinking: ""What would be the furthest thing possible from music?"" It was really sad. I had a breakdown. At one point I was on the British Airways applic­a­tion form — a really long form — and I was seven pages in, and then it went: ""Oh, by the way, if you've got any visible tattoos on your arm then you can't apply."" And I do have tattoos on my arms. I just burst into tears. It was like: ""I've fucked music, and now I can't even be a fucking air hostess!"" It was a really low point for me. What tattoos do you have? I have an ocean wave on my wrist, which was to do with my song Ocean, and I've got a sun and moon symbol on the inside of my arm, which I just got on a whim. It's supposed to signify dark times leading to better times, or whatever. And now here we are! Here we are. The tattoo came true. So what happened after the British Airways debacle? I'd got rid of all my team — I didn't want to do music any more, so I was like: ""Sorry guys, have good careers, but bye."" But then I got an email from a guy I didn't know, who is now my manager. He'd heard a song I did, and informed me that Kylie Minogue was going to use it as the lead single on her next album. It was all, ""Kylie needs this song, what's your man­age­ment situation."" And I was going: ""Look, if Kylie uses the song it's great but I don't want to be in the music industry, sorry but thank you."" I even­tu­ally took a meeting with him and he persuaded me that I should be a song­writer for other artists, which wasn't something I'd thought about before. Kylie didn't end up using the song 1 but I did get to work with her and she was amazing, and everything I hoped she would be. And I started writing with and for other artists, which is what I've been doing ever since. Last year I worked harder than I think I've ever worked in my life, and it felt really good after the great depres­sion of 2016 when I'd spent most of my time sitting alone in my apartment. To be out and hustling again was good. I started going on writing trips to LA and Nashville and all these other cool places, and sort of re-fell in love with music. You talked about being pursued by the guy who's now your manager, and how he talked you into getting back into music. We've also just talked about how labels and managers have a duty of care towards artists, but I suppose there's also an element of self-care, isn't there: seeing red flags, and not allowing yourself to get into situ­ations where your mental health will be impacted. How did you know this guy had your best interests in mind, and that he wasn't just thinking: ""Amazing, someone to make cash out of""? That's exactly what I thought until I met him, when he turned out to be the nicest person ever. He was very clear in saying that he didn't want to make me do anything I didn't want to do, but that he wanted to tell me to my face that I was too good not to do it. He suggested a trial period, without a contract, so I wasn't tied into anything, and he just put me into some sessions to see how it would go. Also, to be honest, the air hostess thing hadn't worked out for me, so I was like: ""Okay, sure."" And I suppose by defin­i­tion the exper­i­ence of writing for other artists instantly removes some of the pressures that had forced you out of music the first time round?  It's so nice being able to go into a studio, and to write a song, then to then leave. And that's it. If an artist uses a song that's great, but if they don't that's also fine. Rather than con­stantly having all this other shit to do that comes with being an artist, and all the mental pressure, I could put on a different hat every day. It made me way more creative and it made me a better writer. What songs have you had out so far? There was the Baby Ariel track a few weeks ago, right? Yes. There was a Fletcher song I did — I've been working a lot with her, she's just signed to Capitol and I think she's going to be a huge popstar. I've also been working a lot with Rina Sawayama, who's been an angel. I don't know how much I'm allowed to say. I poten­tially, well, I'm 90% sure that I've got the next [REDACTED BECAUSE HOW AWFUL WOULD IT BE IF THE ENTIRE THING WENT TITS UP AS A RESULT OF AN ARTICLE ON POPJUSTICE DOT COM] single, which is featuring [ALSO REDACTED BUT THIS SONG SOUNDS LIKE IT WILL BE AMAZING]. It's the kind of song that could drop any time! It could drop this Friday! It's pretty much confirmed. Which is a really big thing for me — the biggest thing yet. I'm a huge fan of both those artists. And it's such a banger, too. Such a bop. Where are we with bangers and bops? Bangers feels quite 2016, and bops 2017. I don't know what the 2018 version is. I'll come back to you on that. As for your own music, how are you releasing Psycho? I'm going through AWAL 2 who I used at the very beginning of my career, and they're great because they're kind of giving me all the services a record label would provide but without any of the scary contracts and throwing loads of money at the wall. I've spent quite a bit of my own money on this release but I feel like you've got to invest in yourself, you know? It feels nice to be in control of it again: being on a major I felt like I was just watching it happen, and I couldn't change anything. Can you give me an example of something that felt like it was out of your control? There's a song I have out that I actively don't like, and didn't want to release, and I was made to release. It's a song called Echoes. I don't hate it, but I just didn't want to put it out. It was different to all my other stuff, and it still is. I expressed all that to the label, but they were like: ""No, this song is coming out, this is the right thing."" I wonder what would happen if there were an inter­na­tional pop amnesty day where every artist could be totally honest about the songs they'd released in the previous twelve months. Because I think a lot of artists find them­selves in situ­ations where they're releasing music they'd rather not. And the question is: do you trust your team enough, so that when they say ""this is the best way for us to move forward"", they're saying that in the best interests of your career, rather than because they don't have a clue what to do and they're just taking a stab in the dark? Yeah. Of course you have to trust your team but usually you should trust your gut instincts more. Especially when you're a solo artist and you're the face of it, and you're the product, and everyhing's about you. I think fans know when something isn't authen­tic­ally you. What's the story behind Psycho's lyrics? I wrote it last August — a year ago. I wrote it with Jonny Hockings, who has become my writing partner in a lot of things. He's very good. We wrote it with just a bass guitar and vocal, and that's how it stayed for ages, and I thought it was one of the best things I'd ever written. Every A&R I sent it to was going: ""This is fucking amazing!"" But nobody had any ideas about who could sing it. Who did you want to sing it? Little Mix were sniffing around it for a while, which could have been cool. But I still knew it wasn't quite right. That was the main problem: I couldn't hear anyone else on it. And it's totally my story — it's a true story about how I went to my ex-boyfriend's house in the middle of the night, sat on his front step and cried until he came out and found me. Paint a picture with words for me here. Had you just split up with him? Maybe three weeks before. He already had a new girl­friend but I didn't know that yet. That's sus­pi­ciously quick! Suspiciously quick. Anyway that night I'd sent him an emotional text about missing him — it was my first hearbreak. To be fair he was being really nice, offering to call me and everything. And about an hour later, when I suppose he'd gone to bed, I don't know what came over me but I ordered an Uber to his house and the next thing I knew I was sitting on his front step crying. Quite loudly. He came out, found me, took me inside, talked to me for a bit, calmed me down and got me an Uber home. It's so embar­rass­ing. So, so embar­rass­ing. Had you been drinking that evening? I was com­pletely sober, which just makes it all worse doesn't it? I was DRUNK ON EMOTION! Obviously looking at it now it was never a good idea, but heart­break makes you go crazy doesn't it? And that's what I wanted to play on in the song. I mean, the song's kind of funny. It's taking the piss out of myself. Also now you've got the song out of it the Uber you took to his front step counts as a business expense, so there are tax benefits. Absolutely! Any Uber with potential song inspir­a­tion is a business expense. Definitely. Is there a happy end to this tale, other than a song coming out of it? There's no happy end. But a few months later I started to find it really funny and started telling everyone the story, and that's how Jonny and I came to write a song about it. Then when nobody else wanted to sing it, I started thinking: ""Fuck it. Maybe I should just release it myself?"" What had changed? I was having dinner with another song­writer I know, called Evan, and we were talking about it, and he said: ""I don't want to sound morbid, but if you found out you were going to die in a month, would you regret not releasing the song?"" And I thought yes, probably. The next day I called my manager and said: ""Right. I'm going to do it."" I'm wondering if, having exper­i­enced what you did around your first album, and knowing what you know about how it impacted your mental health, you're in any way throt­tling your career this time round. In terms of self-pre­ser­va­tion are you trying to ensure it doesn't get so big that it's unman­age­able, or having learned what you did from your first album are you just better equipped now for whatever happens? That makes sense and it's something I'm aware of… We are pushing it, and I am trying to do everything I can to give the song its best chance, but I'm going into this with very different expect­a­tions from before. I'm seeing this as com­pletely starting again. The main thing is that I wanted the song to be out. The first step is just seeing how my old fanbase reacts to it — that's the most important thing to me because it's what I've missed the most, having a con­nec­tion with them and being able to chat with them about music. I haven't gone into it thinking ""I'm going to do a world tour, get three radio pluggers on board and spend half a million on the video"". It's much more tentative, but the magic of streaming is that you can do that now. And what comes next? There's going to be an EP at the beginning of next year. I already know what the second single is, and I'm just finishing the pro­duc­tion on that one now. It's a bit more of a 'pop moment' than Psycho. And there'll be a few live shows before then, too. That's where I'm up to at the moment — there's no five year plan, I'm just taking it a few months at a time. Sounds like a good plan. Thanks mate!

22,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/articles/lou-pearlman-interview/," During 'the summer months' we had a chat with Lou Pearlman — inventor of pop groups like Backstreet Boys and *NSYNC. The reason for our chat was to discuss Lou has a new project, US5. US5 have already been big in other parts of the world and Lou thinks they will be big in the UK, too. The US5 single is out this week. Radio aren't playing it and it's nowhere on the TV. Let's have a look at what Lou had to say in August.  Hello Lou. Do you expect US5 to work in the UK?
Absolutely. Why?
We know what the market likes. It's all about the songs. We usually test the songs and see what the outcome is. Very import­antly the band tested very well in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Russia, Poland and the States. Lots of British and American pop artists are suc­cess­ful in Germany but not many German acts are big in the UK. Why does US5 being big in Germany mean they will be big in the UK?
There's a lot of sim­il­ar­ity to the markets. Young teenage kids like the same music: they like the nice wholesome sound. We aim to please. And to have a good looking group who support that. And it's mostly females. Guys are into sports. But girls like the boybands who dance and move and come close. With a band they're behind their instru­ments so it is hard to touch them. How do you do your testing?
We used to have seminars and do testing at those. These days we use the web. We put songs on special websites and get fans' reactions. Sometimes we don't tell them what the artist is, sometimes we show them pictures, so we know what they like. They tell us whether they like rock, pop, hip hop, what their age is — so we know what the market is. Have you ever rammed something into people's faces in spite of them not wanting it?
We did that with Backstreet Boys. They came out, hit Number 69 in the States and dropped off. Then we went to Europe – Germany, Top 5 right away. We did the same with *NSYNC, who also got their first gold record in Germany. Why do you still need to get things researched? Do you not by now have ears for a hit?
We have some good people who will tell us if it will work. Do you never trust your own instincts?
Yes, sometimes, and once in a while we get it wrong. Why haven't there been any suc­cess­ful boyband launches in the UK for several years?
Every five to seven years the music style changes. I think the boyband thing was played out. But now I think Take That is coming back, US5 is in the mar­ket­place. But surely Take That's success is as a nostalgia act aimed at a com­pletely different audience to US5. Take That's comeback doesn't have anything to do with boybands being back.
I think to have a suc­cess­ful boyband which will work you have to have radio playing it. We have an MTV show for US5 called Big In America, which was aired in Germany, Austria, Switzerland. It got very high ratings. That is the perfect indic­a­tion to us that it will be suc­cess­ful in the UK. I think boybands will come back because the mums who go to see Take That may have young daughters who want to get into that scene – dancing, singing and so on. What are the key elements to breaking US5 in the UK?
Great music, great per­son­al­ity, per­sist­ence. The single doesn't sound like anything else in the charts at the moment, and perhaps not in a good way.
No. It's a unique single. It went gold in the States, platinum in Germany and Switzerland, Russia, Poland. What's the feedback been like from radio in the UK so far?
They're loving it. They think it's different. How about TV?
Having MTV behind us is very important. Not many people watch MTV in the UK.
Well, our market watches MTV. So if our market watches it that's alright. Do you have a chart pre­dic­tion for the single?
Top 10. It's going to work its way up and take a bit of time to develop. And the album?
The album will def­in­itely be Top 10. What did the UK research into US5 actually tell you?
Kids in the UK want to see the band and get a good look at their faces – to get to know them. There needs to be a nice jacket included with the CD to give them inform­a­tion. They need a good website. What do labels waste money on when launching a band?
Clothing. Hotels. Travel. Entertainment. Spend the money on what counts. What does count?
Posters. In-store displays. Cutting deals with Woolworths to make sure they sell your records. Heavy marketing on radio and TV. We do street teams a lot. That's vital. Aren't street teams just 1000 people telling each other to buy a single?
They're vital to get the word out. What mistakes do record labels make, Lou?
A lot of record labels are afraid to really test what people want, they just go with what they know. I do a lot of testing. Testing works. They don't do proper testing. Do proper testing you get it right each time. And from your testing you're saying Top 10 for the single, Top 10 for the album.

23,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/articles/max-martin-interview/,"He's a man who needs no introdu Hello Max. It’s unusual to be having this chat today – usually when a new band comes into view it will be the lead singer who’s put forward for a chat. Yet here you are to tell us all about Carolina Liar. What would you like people to make of this new band?
I hope it’s gonna be the same thing that caught my ear the first time I heard them, which is that it’s all about the songs. You know? Well crafted and well written soulful songs. And it was Chad, the singer's own demos that turned you on to the band?
Absolutely. How did you change Chad's early demos?
Well a lot of people think – because of what I’ve done earlier, and my repu­ta­tion I guess – that this is something I’ve built from the ground up to what it is now but in this par­tic­u­lar case it’s actually the opposite because if you heard the demos that I heard you’d hear the songs as they were. People ask me, ‘how was it?’, but although I’ve co-written on a couple of the songs on this record most of it is not me. My involve­ment was about not fucking it up – it was all there, I just needed to make it sound a little better. Do you feel more pressure not to fuck it up when it’s someone else’s song?
I think so. It’s different no matter who you work with, it’s always a different process, but in this par­tic­u­lar case there was something… I mean I don’t normally produce other people’s songs I just write myself because I have to, because nobody else will. (Laughs) At least that’s how it started. But this time round it’s a big respons­ib­il­ity because it’s Chad’s stuff and I know how much it means to him. As a producer how do you know what a song is supposed to sound like? What is there about a song that makes you think, ‘this song should sound organic or elec­tronic or R&B and that is the only possible way this song will reach its potential, or should be allowed to sound’?
Wow. Well, normally, when I write my own stuff it’s kind of easy because it comes with the writing. Especially if you write for other people they have something they want to express so you know what kind of lane you want to be in. That's when you’re the ‘hired gun’. But with Chad he already had that, so like I said it was up to me to maybe add something here and there or change the structure here and there. But it was all easy. But if you thought he’d written a song that would have been better suited to Britney, or Kelly Clarkon or whoever, would you have said to him ‘look, I don’t think this song’s good for you, let's give it to someone else’?
Well with this it was all his thing so I wasn’t thinking like that I suppose. I mean listen, we were hoping he would be – we’re hoping he will be – something a lot of people pay attention to, but if he wanted to [write for other artists] he could totally do it. But having a voice like his it would be a waste, I think. You’ve got a rock back­ground so you might under­stand this mentality better than most, but a lot of rock artists might be put off working with ‘Britney producer Max Martin’ because of concerns about how they’d be perceived. Is Chad quite open minded about that?
I guess in his position he didn’t really have a choice! (Laughs) He sent me his stuff when it was all getting done and he didn’t really send it anywhere else so I got him early! Let’s see what happens on the second record… Do you become quite pro­tect­ive of the artists you’ve worked with – do you prefer them not to work with other producers?
I never believe in shoving stuff down people’s throats. There have been times when people come back, and there have been times when people don’t come back. Music is so personal so I try not to take it per­son­ally myself. Sometimes it just doesn’t work – you make one record and it’s great then a second one and it’s not that great. And a third time they don’t wanna come back. Maybe you have a vibe for five minutes when you write the perfect song, maybe you don’t. People are free to do whatever they want, I think. I inter­viewed one writer/producers recently and he said that a lot of song­writ­ing is about when the planets align, when the perfect moment comes along. Do you work to that principal or do you have a trick to force the planets into alignment?
Do you mean when I’m writing a song? Yes. In the sense that some people can sit down in an empty room with no windows with a blank sheet of paper and a piano and make them­selves write a hit record, whereas for others inspir­a­tion strikes unex­pec­tedly or can’t be con­trolled.
I think it works in all those ways, actually. I think I’m pretty good at ‘saving up’ inspir­a­tion. Especially since I had a kid, so you don’t have time to do it all the time like I used to. Let me put it this way – song­writ­ing and producing is 99% about con­fid­ence. To me it is, anyway. When you don’t have con­fid­ence you don’t write good stuff. And over the years I’ve begun to feel that, well, I kind of know how to write a song now. So I’m not worried. And once you’re past that you’re at least halfway there. So I never really had the cramps, knock on wood, that I hear people get. They sound hor­ri­fy­ing actually. There was the point between Cheiron and Maratone where you took a break, though…
Well I had a kid. And, well, I didn’t really do good stuff either. It wasn’t that I didn’t do stuff. It just wasn’t really that great — and it didn’t work. But I wasn’t really worried about that. Thinking back I didn’t panic, at all. I don’t know why, it’s just not me [to panic]. People form deep emotional con­nec­tions with your songs but it sounds like when you’re writing them you're quite calm, even busi­ness­like?
I know a lot of people think I’m that. A lot of people think I’m old. Well I am kind of old. (Laughs) But the point is that I hear a lot of things about me, because I’ve done the things that I’ve done, like the Britneys and the Backstreets and that’s con­sidered ‘light­weight’ or whatever you want to call it, but people think I’m busi­ness­minded. I would say I’m not. I think that the minute you start thinking like that, is the minute the songs suffer. I try to make the songs as good as I can – the way I like it, you know? And I guess my taste sometimes happens to be what other people, par­tic­u­larly radio pro­gram­mers, like too. You mentioned the idea of a ‘perfect song’. Which of your own songs do you consider perfect?
Oh… (Long pause) That’s for somebody else to say. You’re asking me which of my children I love the most! That’s hard. I can’t! I can’t… I don’t know. (Another long pause) When I release something, that’s the one I love the most. I might look back on it ten years form now and say ‘well, that kind of sucked’, but at that moment I wrote it I thought it was great and that’s what really matters to me. Is the Carolina Liar material something that you’ll look back on and love?
Yeah, I’m excited about this. It was just too good to let pass in my life and I had to do something about it, even though I don’t normally just produce music for other people. I felt like I needed to – it needed to come out. Do you think a few years ago – you said earlier you were old – you would have formed a band with Chad?
Me in the band? (Large laugh) I hear there’s a tempta­tion. I see a lot of producers on MTV lately… (Laughs) That’s what you’re ‘supposed to do’, isn’t it? I feel like I’m done with that part of my life and since I was a singer too I kind of feel he outgunned me. So I don’t think I would make the advance, even if I wanted to. What do you look for in a singer? Is there some hidden quality you can say Chad has in common with someone like Britney?
Well, as a producer you’re always looking for a special sound – something different. And it’s the same with a singer, if there’s something different you’re halfway there already. If just by the artist opening their mouth singing there’s something there, it makes the job a lot easier. If there’s identity in their voice, I guess. When Amy Winehouse starts singing, you know it’s her and you don’t have to do much. And that’s something that’s always there in her voice, isn't it, no matter what sort of state she’s in.
I totally agree. And that’s the power of the artist. Is she someone you think you could work with?
(Laughs) I don’t think she would ever want to do that. I would love to do something with her but that would be a question for her, rather than me! Who knows? If she turned up tomorrow and said, ‘Max, I’ve got three hours, record a song with me’, would you have a song you could pull off the shelf?
(Thinks) I would, yes. I’d find it pretty fast. It's fas­cin­at­ing, the idea of these songs that song­writers and producers have on their shelves or in the top drawers, just songs waiting for the right artist to one day come along. It makes me quite angry actually. Songs held in captivity for years, even decades. Surely these songs deserve to be liberated?
I know what you’re saying! I don’t have that much stuff lying around to be honest with you, but it’s also inter­est­ing how much of it happens by accident, when you’ll play something and the artist will go ‘whoah, what was that one? Let me hear it again?’. I’ve always been bad at that – the ‘knowing’ thing. Knowing when something’s good or right. Is that why you’ll co-write with people so much, so that they can catch the good bits when you don’t notice them yourself?
No, I just believe in col­lab­or­a­tion. I mean I’ve written songs on my own, you know, but I think if the artist has something to bring to the table – someone like Pink, for instance – where the have something to say, it makes your job easier and more special. When you’re writing or making a song do you write with a specific audience or listener in mind, or do you just try to write totally naturally?
There’s two different things there. There’s writing songs and trying not to think about business and all that sort of stuff, yeah? Cos I think the ‘target market’ and ‘audience’ tends to come with the artist. If I’m doing something with a young pop artist I may not choose to have a brass section in a song, for example. Sometimes you have to think about what the artist already is. But once you start thinking about that stuff too much is when you get – well, when I get – cramped. It’s music, it’s supposed to be fun and inspir­a­tional. You have to be inspired. If I did it because it was my ‘job’, and I only did it to make money, I don’t think I’d still be doing it. The whole industry of making music spe­cific­ally for children, or making music you intend to be targeted at people you perceive to have a low quality threshold, is one of the main causes of bad pop music, isn’t it.
Yeah. As you know, a lot of the stuff that was once con­sidered rubbish or ‘for kids’ is now con­sidered classic and people get knighted for their involve­ment in it. Pop music is always about NOW. But only time will tell what songs will survive. That’s what pop culture is supposed to be about. If people were going to be scared about how they’d look in old pho­to­graphs they’d never buy fash­ion­able clothes – it has to be about the moment. Artists, clothes, music, you have to take the risk and make your mark. The UK can be a very different and difficult pop market which inter­na­tional labels sometimes find quite confusing – who do you think will buy Carolina Liar music?
Well it sounds kind of lame but I mean my daughter loves it – my daughter is eight – and my mum likes it too. My mum is not eight. I want everyone to like it! It’s hard for me to say, in a way I don’t care about it but I do want people who buy the record to be able to listen to it again and again and again. That’s one of the things we thought about. To make every song special. I don’t think there’s a lot of throwaway stuff on there – it was hard to pick the songs for this record. What do you hear at the moment, music wise, that excites you?
Um… (Stupendously long pause) I dunno, this is like the second interview I’ve done in about ten years so I’m not prepared! I really like… Uh, what’s the name of that band that everyone likes now? Kings Of Leon. I really like them. You know what’s weird sometimes is when everyone’s watched a movie and loves it, you kind of want to go, ‘I don’t like it’. But then, I had to like it. Everyone likes it and I do too. I admit it. It's not always the case but sometimes saying you're the only person to think something is bad is just a different way of saying you’re wrong. Contrary to belief it's possible to approach music object­ively.
Yes, exactly. You’re right. Also, Max, to be fair, you’ve made a career out of multi-platinum singles and albums so you can’t really be com­plain­ing about music that’s enjoyed by lots of people.
(Guffaws) Yes I know, I know. Let’s hope Amy agrees. Amy Winehouse that is. So she is on your wishlist?
You know what, to be honest I think she’s better off without me. But I mean, hey, I would love to record a song with her. But I don’t think she needs my whatever-I-do. She’s doing fine by herself. Is there any music you’d like to recommend to Popjustice readers?
That’s a good question that makes my head go blank. Um… Some producers and song­writers try to shut them­selves off from the outside world so that other songs don’t affect or influence what they’re doing…
Yeah, you know what I don’t really listen to a lot of music. I am what they call a ‘Mr Smith’ kind of thing – where you’re like every other dude. I listen to the radio when I go to work. Right now I have Janis Joplin in my CD player. But my music tastes are pretty cheesy, I think. Do you think Janis Joplin could have sung ‘…Baby One More Time’?
Well she was dead when I wrote that song. Yes Max. Yes she was. But if she hadn’t been dead.
(Laughs) I don’t know about that. Seriously? Oh… It would have been awesome, but I’m not sure how it would have sounded. Well TLC turned it down, didn’t they, because of all the hitting business? Perhaps Janis would have been on their side.
Yes. I think she did alright without that stuff. Well she died, she didn’t do that well.
But she’s a legend now. She is Max. A dead legend.
Yes, yes she is. Carolina Liar on MySpace

24,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/articles/olly-alexander-interview-im-a-convincingly-happy-human-being/,"Years & Years have recorded one of 2015's best pop albums. It's got 'King' on it, for a start. But is also has other songs. Almost all those songs are of an extremely high quality, so well done Years & Years. The singer in Years & Years is a man named Olly Alexander. Olly will be 25 quite soon, but for the time being he is 24 years old. At the start of this week we called him on the telephone to discuss various topics, including: 1. Years & Years
2. Olly Alexander
3. Some other stuff. Here is how our chat went. You know Years & Years, right? This band you’re in?
Yes. Is it fair to say you were quite shit to start with?
(Aghast) What do you mean ‘shit to start with’? Well, let’s look at these videos you’ve attempted to remove all trace of from the internet, but which still live on in fans’ YouTube accounts. These videos are not good. 
(Laughs) Yes alright. I agree with you. This is why we’ve tried to eradicate it, and as far as I’m concerned these videos do not exist any more. It’s really difficult to remove videos. So you were shit to start with, but when did you decide to be good?
Well I think we always had hopes of being good! (Laughs) But the reality is that it takes a while. Maybe some people can form a band and be instantly amazing, but normally you have to make a lot of shitty mistakes before you can do anything good. We were doing a lot of guitar sounds, and I’m not into that. Even as a song­writer, when I first started writing songs, the songs I was writing were not good. I was writing pretty terrible songs. I just didn’t know what I was doing, but the more I wrote, the better I got.  So was there a band meeting? Not so much to say ‘Olly buck your ideas up and write some decent songs’, but…
Well nobody else was writing any! But in terms of ‘let’s go for a more elec­tronic sound’…
It just sort of evolved. Emre wanted to record by himself and bought software and taught himself how to use it, and we had a couple of synths we started using more. And the music I was listening to myself started to change; at the time I was going out a lot, and going to clubs, so I was listening to a lot more of that kind of thing. Do you cry a lot?
I do cry quite a lot. I haven’t lately. But I am quite sensitive. I’m getting less sensitive though — when I read people’s mean stuff about me, I used to feel a deep pang of shame inside me, like ‘oh no, now they really know who I am’. But now I feel less of that. Why do you feel less of it?
I don’t know. Maybe you just get used to it, and it doesn’t touch the same nerve. Is there also a sense that you’ve had a Number One record, you’ve got a popstar boyfriend and everyone else can just fuck off?
Yeah. Yeah, there is a bit of that. ‘I’ve won’. (Laughs) But I mean it’s not about winning. It’s alright to feel like you’ve won.
Yeah. What I realised the other day was that if you think about defining your success in terms of winning, you always think there’s a point where you’ll be suc­cess­ful. But you just want to do something better. This is a really obvious thing to say, but if you’re someone who’s ambitious, you’re always thinking ‘what’s the next ambitious thing I could do, and what else can I achieve?' What are your ambitions now? I mean outside the usual ‘suc­cess­ful album, arena tour’ sort of standard career ladder?
Well I’d like to not be an idiot in the world. (Laughs) I get asked quite a bit now: ‘How do you feel being a spokes­per­son for gay people?’ Which is just weird because obviously I can’t speak for all gay people because I’m just one gay person and there are lots of diverse issues. We come in all shapes and sizes, us gays. But I do want to be able to speak about myself and if that can be helpful for other people then that’s a good thing. ‘Shine’ was Number One on iTunes earlier today. Is it still there?
I think so. I checked this morning and we were still there. YES! I mean it might not actually be Number One in the end, but it might. Who knows?  At least it’s not a flop.
It’s not a flop! Which is the most any of us can hope for in this life. Mind you, wait until you release a ballad, then we’ll see what happens.
Then it will be Number One for five weeks! Hm…
(Merry chortle) Are you doing a ballad for your next single?
Well, I don’t know. I’m not sure what’s happening next. I’d like for it not to be. I’d like not to release a ballad. There are more uptempo tracks than downtempo tracks on the album. I’m just not inter­ested in doing that many ballads, really. I don’t like listening to that kind of music. I mean they have their place… There are a number of slow songs on the album.
There are three slow songs on the album. That’s like a quarter of the album.
That’s an accept­able number of ballads! So if you don’t like a quarter of your album, would you be happy with people giving it 7.5/10 reviews?
WAIT. I’m not saying I don’t like a quarter of my album. You don’t like listening to that kind of music.
Well my own ones are different. My own ones are GREAT.  How good would you say the album is, out of ten?
Ten. I’m giving it a ten.  REALLY.
Alright, nine. There’s always room for improve­ment. So what’s wrong with it?
Features. There weren’t enough features. Who would you like to have featured on your album?
PITBULL. What do you think Pitbull would bring, lyrically, to a Years & Years song? Traditionally his features tend to dwell on man­hand­ling a lady.
I think we’d have some back and forth about how I think that's miso­gyn­istic and not a way to treat a woman, and he’d be like [breaks into world’s worst Pitbull impres­sion] “shut up, let me touch this ho”. Or something.  When I met him he was unex­pec­tedly charming.
Was he hot? I think it’s okay to fancy Pitbull. I can’t quite remember what he looks like. Is he bald? Some people do find that hot. He always wears a suit. That’s good. He makes an effort. Whereas you do not wear suits. In fact you wear the opposite of suits.
I wear an anti-suit: shorts and a vest. What do you wear in the winter?
I go for layers in the winter. Two pairs of shorts and two vests?
Yes.  What’s the lyric on the album that sums you up best?
Probably, from ‘Real’: “if I’d been enough for you, would I be better, would I be good?” How does that work then?
Well. It’s about the idea of unre­quited love, and this feeling that if someone loves you that will make you a better person. And that’s a really fucked up idea. But I think it’s something a lot of people get them­selves into believing. This idea that you need someone’s love and attention to feel worthy. And a lot of the album was written about that. Did you often find that you were secondary in rela­tion­ships?
I did, yes. Yes. But I also realised that these people who didn’t want me enough… Well, I wouldn’t have said I was in love with them, really. It’s an inter­est­ing, parasitic rela­tion­ship when you want someone to want you, but you don’t even want them. It’s toxic.  What sort of person do you think you’d have become if you’d found yourself in rela­tion­ships where you weren’t secondary? Because some people seek out rela­tion­ships where they’re always going to be the best person in that rela­tion­ship. They want or need to be the most good-looking or the funniest or the most cha­ris­matic, and so they seek out people who are inferior. 
I don’t think that’s what I’m inter­ested in doing, no. I like, generally, or at least my exper­i­ence has taught me this, to be the less good one in a rela­tion­ship. (Laughs) But equality is good, isn’t it? Strive for equality! That’s a very nice sentiment but who’s best out of you and Neil? [Neil being Neil out of Clean bandit ie Olly's 'beau']
(Laughs) WHO’S BEST? How are we measuring this? What metrics? The whole lot.
I’ll put it this way, if we couldn’t mix our sperm together and only one of us could donate our sperm for a baby, I’d def­in­itely pick Neil. He has much better genes than me. He’s tall and handsome with good shiny hair and he’s incred­ibly smart. He actually knows how to play music. He wins, genet­ic­ally, for sure. Does he keep a violin under the pillow in case of emer­gen­cies?
Yes. Yes he does. It’s very tiny.  What’s your debut solo album going to sound like?
‘I Am… Sasha Fierce’. It’s quite inter­est­ing that there was no ques­tion­ing whether you would or wouldn’t ever release a solo album. Straight in with an answer. 
Well you’re not the first person to ask. (Laughs) How many Years & Years albums will there be before you make your solo debut?
Four. There are going to be four.  So Years & Years are a quarter of the way through their career?
Yes. That’s quite a lot, isn’t it? What will the next Years & Years album sound like?
It depends how this album does. If it does well, we’ll just do exactly the same again. (Laughs) But no, I think we’ll do something different.  Can I make an early request for the second album?
Yes. ZERO songs about being on the road and missing people.
Good request. Is that standard second album behaviour? Second albums go like this: you go a bit more guitary. You’ve been doing loads of festivals so you make music that will make sense for a live audience. And you write about missing people because you’re on tour.
I see. Can you give me some ideas for other material? Yes. Songs about being up in the club. Also, more songs that are about love but could also be about cocaine.
(Laughs) Okay. It’s a deal. You know all popstars seem to be having throat surgery at the moment?
Yes. Do you think that in the same way dogs and cats are often ‘seen to’, popstars should have the snip before they start out? The day after you sign your deal, off you go for surgery?
But it’s not a snip is it? What actually happens? I’m quite confused by all this mys­ter­i­ous throat surgery. What they do is they take your vocal cord and they take about an inch of it out, and they sur­gic­ally graft in a bit of rubber band.
Really? Yes.
What? NO OF COURSE NOT OLLY THEY DON’T PUT A RUBBER BAND IN YOUR NECK.
Oh. Well, I suppose getting it sorted out early is probably a good idea. But don’t you need there to be a problem before you sort it out? I don't know. What was it like growing up in the Forest Of Dean?
Difficult. Where I was living was quite poor; there was no concept of social mobility. They stay within their town. My dad used to work in marketing for theme parks so we moved around a lot. We lived in Blackpool when he worked at the pleasure beach, then we moved near Drayton Manor. But there was no cultural diversity. If you don’t fit in with the rest, it can be quite difficult, and I was bullied quite a bit at school. When I was 17 I moved to London as soon as I could. Could you tell your parents about the trouble you were having at school?
No. I never spoke to my mum about that stuff. My parents split up when I was 13 and I just had my mum. I’d never tell her about that stuff. It’s weird — my mum read an interview where I said I’d had a terrible time at school and she wasn’t aware. It was sur­pris­ing to me that she didn’t know. I guess I was quite good at not talking about it.  When did you learn to talk about things? You seem quite express­ive now, at least in your lyrics. But are your lyrics the extent of it?
I am a really open person, mostly. But you can be open in lots of ways. Ever since I can remember I’ve found writing songs very helpful. It’s been my language. When you said earlier, half-jokingly, that you’ve ‘won’…
(Groans) Now hang on. That's surely a valid sentiment, in a sense, for someone who’s exper­i­enced bullying.
Well what I think I’ve managed to do is be quite socially well-adjusted — I'm a con­vin­cingly happy human being. ‘Convincingly happy’ is quite a phrase.
(Laughs) What I mean is — well, yes, you’re right, I was bullied as a kid and that stays with you all your life, and I always dreamed of being suc­cess­ful and making music, but it didn’t feel like it would ever be possible. So yes, I do feel like I’ve somehow swindled that! Now we need to be quite careful in this interview because in NME’s review of your album they said you don’t do inter­est­ing inter­views.
What a mean review! They obviously didn’t read the Years & Years Popjustice interview at the start of the year when you talked about wanking each other off.
I know! Someone actually tweeted us the other day saying ‘Years & Years look like the kind of band that wank each other off’. Which was funny. It’s just something we like to do!  It was inter­est­ing how the NME album review concluded that you didn’t sound like Skepta or Wolf Alice, which must annoy you as that was clearly the sort of sound you were aiming for.
Yeah, obviously. It’s a failure. It’s a complete failure. I like NME, it’s enjoyable to read, but I mean the guy obviously hated it. What can I say? I’m glad he hates it!  I know you're a former actor yourself, but do you find actors a bit strange?
Yes. But how do you mean? They just have all their strange acting habits don't they.
It’s a very weird job, I think. They pretend to be other people all the time and they get confused about who they’re supposed to be when they’re not other people. It is weird.  What’s the best Girls Aloud song?
The song I sing most, still, is ‘Sound Of The Underground’, but I’m not sure if that’s their best song. I also love ‘Biology’. Actually maybe it’s ‘Love Machine’.  When will the world end and whose fault will it be?
It will end in fifty to sixty years. We will have depleted all our natural resources, there will be a big CO2 gas cloud over the world. It will all be our fault. Would you like to be around for the end of the world?
YES. I really want to be. That’s quite a big goal for me. I love end-of-the-world movies — that being played out in real time would be cool. Also dying’s a little bit more accept­able when you know everyone else is coming with you. Will you ever write a song as good as ‘Style’ by Taylor Swift?
Do you think that’s Taylor’s best song? I do too. People don’t agree with me. But will I ever write a song that good? Yes I think I will. What does being in love feel like?
It feels like walking a tightrope.  Please elaborate.
Have you ever walked on a tightrope? No.
Neither have I! Great.
But I’ve been in love. You’ve got to stay balanced. And you’ve got to cross dangerous, poten­tially life-threat­en­ing terrain. And, er, yes. It was pretty self-explan­at­ory really wasn’t it.  Do you believe in the phrase ‘give the public what they want’?
I don’t know. In terms of music? I don’t think you can tell people what to like. Isn’t that the basis of the BBC Sound Poll, which you did quite well out of?
Yes but that’s a small number of people. I don’t really know how the Sound Poll works, I think it’s about a hundred people. But that’s a different con­ver­sa­tion: that’s not telling people what they like, because people still liked ‘King’. I don’t think people liked it because they were told to! Are you a better singer than you were an actor?
Yes. Is singing just a phase, as acting was?
Who knows? I’m a creative person and whatever that means I’ll keep doing that in some form or another. What would you do if you were banned from making music?
I think I’d quite like to do something within mental health or animals.  Do you care about all animals?
Yes. Would you let rats live in your house?
I don’t know. What if you had cock­roaches?
I don’t like killing flies but I suppose no, I’d exterm­in­ate cock­roaches. So there’s a boundary somewhere between, say, dogs and cock­roaches.
Yes.  Frogs?
I love frogs. I’d like frogs running around my house. .

25,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/articles/patrick-wolf-interview/,"We once saw Patrick Wolf on the bus eating a doughnut. Another time we saw him on the London Underground trying to navigate Earls Court with an old lady's shopping trolley. When he is not riding around on public transport, Patrick Wolf makes pop records. His latest, 'The Magic Position', is very good indeed, so we spoke to him over the telephone about it… Hello Patrick. Why is your new album the best thing you have ever recorded?
It's not the best thing I've ever recorded. You can't say that.
I can! I keep all the really good stuff for my own secret time. I record music every day for myself. Does your label know that you are keeping the really good stuff for yourself?
They probably wouldn't think it was any good at all! All anyone cares about in 2007 is bloody Mika. In what way are you like Mika?
Do you really want to go there? I get very confused as somebody who released records for five years and got to number 243 when a new artist comes out and does so well. I guess there is a thing of paying your dues a little bit. But it's fine. We live in an age where you sign with a major label imme­di­ately then they throw £200,000 of advert­ising at you and you have a hit record. Which is nice, I'm sure. How much have your record label thrown at you to promote your record?
Not much, because it's my money at the end of the day. I'm a very good business man. In ret­ro­spect, do you think you should have camped your album sleeve up a little bit?
I was going to dress as Divine, actually. How high main­ten­ance is your hair?
It depends how drunk I am. It can take anything between one minute and half a day. Do you have to keep re-applying the dye to make sure it doesn't end up looking faded and shit?
Well, when I was packing up my flat [to move] I was counting and I have over 24 wigs. Over the years I've built up a col­lec­tion. So if I lose my hair I'm going to be fine. The red hair is your own though…
I must thank Geri Halliwell for the inspir­a­tion. How would you impress the judges at an X-Factor audition?
I've been talking to a friend about this. I've been going to Shepherds Bush Market recently and I am inter­ested in those wigs which look like Sinitta's hair — those long black ones with the wet look curls. Which super­mar­ket chain has your custom, Patrick Wolf?
 Morrisons. They have Bettabuy there. You can follow the trail of families who are on treasure hunts to find the best Bettabuy price. How do you pri­or­it­ise your shop?
My food shopping is very much budget-driven. I have cupboards full of Bettabuy kidney beans. Where do you buy your pants?
 I don't really wear pants. My mum bought me some really small, small pants last Christmas and my friends thought I was having some sort of paedo-fantasy when I wore them, because I never wear pants. I threw them away, along with the few pairs of pants I did own. Do you not wish you had held on to a few pairs in case there was another cold snap?
 To save me from getting piles? Or worse.
 What could be worse than piles? There can't be much worse than a case of piles. Patrick, are you speaking from exper­i­ence?
It is the unspoken disease of touring, which every sound engineer or tour manager who sits in a van will know about. I tend to bring a cushion these days. I've learnt a lot over the years. Perhaps you should provide com­fort­able seating for your staff as well.
 It's the sort of thing you discuss… Do you employ a cleaner?
 No, I was thinking about going on How Clean Is Your House?, actually. It just took me over a week to clean up my old flat and my kitchen sink was black with mould. I'd not been there because I have been working every day. That's no excuse. Would you really want those mad old bats scraping their fingers around behind your u-bend?
 I think my flat would give them a nervous breakdown. Are you going to get dropped if you don't have a Top Ten single?
 No. I have a good contract. I'm a wise person. I'm doing a remix project for the American release and there are going to be some rave anthems in there. Do you like Girls Aloud?
Yes. Of course. They are champions. We're on the same label and that was one of the main reasons I signed with Polydor. That must be part of your good business sense.
 My TV person is their TV person as well. What will be your opening gambit when you finally meet Nicola Roberts?
 My first line? I'll probably ask her what her favourite Bettabuy was at Morrisons, actually. You can only put that quote in context by the way. There has to have been the earlier mention of my obsession with Bettabuy. It's not derog­at­ory toward Nicola. Consider your quotes in context. Thank you Patrick Wolf.

27,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/articles/robyn-talks-body-talk/,"Robyn's got an album out soon. In fact she's got three albums out soon, and for the first interview of what promises to be a fairly busy twelve months we met up with Robyn in a London hotel room for a run-through of how the whole thing will work, what it's all about, and how she'll always feel like an outsider. So to get this straight: you’re releasing two short albums then the best bits of those, plus some new stuff, is going on a third. Is that right?
I think all of it’s going on the last album. I don’t know. I was thinking of a way to have a different work routine to fit my way of working rather than the release schedules the industry has. I don’t want to be away from the studio as much as I have been – I haven’t been in the studio properly since 2005, really. It’s been a long time since I actually made a record! And I was thinking of how to shorten that time down and Eric, my manager, came up with the idea of what if I just start releasing songs, then I can tour them, then I can make some more songs. We started working like that. I think once it starts it will make more sense – you can just keep releasing stuff without the long breaks. It also means that everything worth releasing gets released — pre­sum­ably if you were to be releasing one tra­di­tional album this coming November,  some of the tracks on this first one wouldn’t make the track­list­ing for one reason or another?
Exactly! (Thinks) Actually they would all make the cut because they’re all awesome. But a con­ven­tional 12 track album wouldn’t have had room for all the songs you’ve made. 
Yes. And what also would have happened is that these songs… Well, you release singles and by the time you’re at your third single everybody who’s bought the album already knows that song. It’s not something new, it doesn’t feel fresh. With this way of doing something you don’t have the feeling that songs are can­ni­bal­ising each other, and they’re not fighting for space. You mentioned that could ‘keep releasing stuff’ – is that to say that while you’ve only announced three albums for 2010, you could in fact keep going and have another one out in March 2011?
Yes! Yes I could! Do you have the material now to do that?
Not right now – but I do have a lot of material. Do you know the track­list­ing of the third album? 
No. So effect­ively you’ve started writing a story without knowing how it ends.
Yes, exactly! Well, most of the songs are written for the third album, or they’re demoed in some way, so I do feel like I have an idea of what’s to come, but you’re right that there is no end to it really. It’s not like I’m doing less or more, I’m just short­en­ing the distance between making it and the release. Will all that 'Body Talk' albums have different per­son­al­it­ies? Are they really three separate albums? 
They maybe will, but it’s not going to be on purpose because the songs that are on the first album are simply the first ones that were finished. So it’s pretty random?
Yes, there’s no thought behind the three parts. It’s just three parts of the same album. It’s inter­est­ing how much time bands spend thinking about ‘the body of work’ and whether track two of their new album makes sense in relation to track seven and so on, and you’re just chucking stuff out in any order.
Well once I knew what was going to be on the album I listened to the songs and made the order of them out of how I wanted the journey to be, but no. There’s nothing like ‘this is the body’, ‘this is the talk’. It’s just songs. And they’re all connected to me because I’m in this state of mind at the moment, touring, listening to music, spending a lot of time in clubs. And that’s what’s affected this album – the three parts – a lot. Tracks like ‘None Of Dem’ and ‘Dancing On My Own’ are quite bril­liantly teenage in their sense of unbear­able crisis and melodrama – hating the town you live in, crying at the dis­cotheque and so on… It feels like quite a young record.
I think I’m just juvenile in my head! I’m always going to be writing about those issues, it’s what I’m fas­cin­ated by but I also think there’s something about the state of mind you find yourself in a lot when you’re younger, and you just want to get out of somewhere. You just want to do something. Feel things! When you put it like that it seems just as much like an emotion someone can feel, perhaps even more strongly, in their 30s or 40s. 
Exactly! And I feel that most people are becoming their own editors at the moment. You have to edit your sur­round­ings – you have everything thrown at you, and all these options, and sometimes you’re not satisfied by any of it. That’s what ‘Don’t Fucking Tell Me What To Do’ is about, and ‘None Of Dem’ as well. I think the album, to me, talks a lot about tech­no­logy versus humanity. Not in a view of some dystopian or utopian future, but in terms of now. We’re already there: we’re already integ­rated with tech­no­logy and we’re already com­mu­nic­at­ing with each other in these amazing ways, and it’s about asking how we deal with this new per­spect­ive on ourselves. So in a sense, the medium is the message, or at least your own response to inform­a­tion overload and changing envir­on­ments is to be changing the way you’re putting your music out? So you ask a question but the way you ask it is also an answer.
Yeah, yeah it is in a way. [Editor's note: Robyn is probably just being polite here] I think those teenage lyrics and that mood is, to me, also this thing that I sometimes feel no matter how old I get. I’m always going to feel like this person on the outside looking in. And I think it’s an important subject and it’s one that I’m always going to be inter­ested in because it’s the driving force behind what a lot of people do. ‘Nobody under­stands me, I’ve got to tell them how I feel’ – that emotion is amazing to me. Obviously the problem with this is the problem exper­i­enced by anyone who writes from that sort of per­spect­ive: if you become suc­cess­ful by com­mu­nic­at­ing that emotion, you find that you’re not by yourself or isolated any more, and that per­spect­ive becomes uncon­vin­cing. You find that your feeling of ‘nobody under­stands me, I’m an outsider’ makes you very popular, and you’re not an outsider any more. You have fans, people find you quite ‘cool’ whatever that means, you’ve got your major label deal, everything’s not really that much of a disaster. 
Yes! (Laughs) No, the thing is I don’t look at it that way. I mean I do recognise that I’m in a great situation in that sense, but at the same time that doesn’t stop me feeling like an outsider, and I feel that’s always who I’m going to be. I'm always going to feel like an outsider, I’m always going to identify myself as that person I was when I was fifteen. It’s quite a gloomy message to send out, isn’t it. “If you’re fifteen and unhappy, you’ll be unhappy when you’re 30, even if things are going quite well.”
Yes, but I get energy from that. That’s where I get my con­fid­ence from, too. From reacting against something, having something to push against?
Yeah I guess – again, very juvenile! (Laughs) Will there be a solid visual theme across the three album releases, or will each release have its own identity?
It’s going to be one long thing. They’re going to be different from each other but they’ll be three parts of one thing. They’ll be a con­tinu­ation of the last album, I think, I mean both visually and musically. Musically because the last album was so important for me, and cre­at­ively I’d got to a point I wanted to be at, so I didn’t want to change anything. But hopefully there’s something new so people don’t get bored! The proper single from this first album is ‘Dancing On My Own’ – what’s the video going to be like? There were points in the last campaign, like the ‘Handle Me’ video, which seemed perhaps self-con­sciously quite ‘anti-popstar’.
I’m always going to be drawn to things that are maybe a bit uncom­fort­able for the main­stream pop world but to me it’s not something I do to prove a point, it’s just something I do because I think it’s fun. There’s def­in­itely still going to be that element. The video hasn’t even been planned for ‘Dancing On My Own’, we’re so late with it! But being on tour, and the per­form­ance side of it, will be really important to the campaign this time round. Because I grew up in a theatre family and feel so com­fort­able per­form­ing it was so sat­is­fy­ing last time when I was promoting and touring to be able to play live and meet people after­wards. It’s important that people know it’s a real person, and that it doesn’t feel cold. Without talking about what other people do, I think the pop climate at the moment can be cold and very visual. It’s very exper­i­mental again which it wasn’t in the 90s, but it’s also become something where it’s about topping each other rather than showing who you actually are. I remember growing up I had Neneh Cherry and she was just the coolest girl on the block – she was like me and my friends, just cooler. And I always felt that artists who talked to me in that way were really inspir­a­tional. On paper the idea that you’ve got three albums coming out suggests that you’ve had a very creative time of late, but when has it been difficult?
Well there have been more difficult times than times when it was actually working! I’d been on tour since 2007 and I didn’t write one single song while I was on tour. I wrote ‘The Girl & The Robot’ when I had some time off, but I just can’t write when I’m touring. And because of that I’ve decided to start learning Logic so I’m setting myself up to be able to record ideas when I have them. But back then, when I came home at the end of 2008, I felt totally drained and I felt like I wasn’t going to be able to write another song for the rest of my life. I went back home, I had lots of Christmas food with my family. I tried for six months at the start of last year and I couldn't write a single word or melody. Why not? 
I was just tired from touring and flying con­stantly, just drained. In my head I was like, ‘I’ve got to keep doing this thing’, but as it turned out I needed time to start col­lect­ing together memories and things to start writing about. I got back into the studio with Klas [Ahlund] in July and we wrote, like, half this whole three-part album in a couple of months. It was a big, big hill but I started writing again. And it was so much fun! So these three albums have all been written since last summer?
Yes! I mean I’d love to say I’d been writing all these amazing songs while I was on tour, but no, it’s all since last year. You mention the idea of col­lect­ing together memories, but is there anything on 'Body Talk PT 1' or any of the other albums that would tell us what’s been going on in your life since last July? Did you write any songs about events while you were actually exper­i­en­cing them?
Totally, I mean ‘Don’t Fucking Tell Me What To Do’ is about not having a life. (Laughs) I mean I HATE the ‘com­plain­ing artist’ situation but it’s about not having time to call your mom, or dealing with how a video should look to work 'in all ter­rit­or­ies', or how you can be on Twitter for three hours then realise you’ve done nothing all day. I think it’s a very common feeling these days that you’re busy all the time, and you’re doing lots of things, but you’re not being pro­duct­ive. Well Twitter is the perfect example, really, in that you can somehow absorb world events and everything of interest to everyone around you but in such a way that feels com­pletely mean­ing­less.
Yes. Well I love to get my Twitters from NASA. That’s inform­a­tion for me! And I love hearing about things through Twitter all the time. But you have to dis­cip­line yourself with it. Where did ‘Dancing On My Own’ come from? 
I think ‘Dancing On My Own’ is totally from me just being in clubs and going out and dancing a lot, and seeing people and thinking, ‘what are they doing here?’. All these people with their hopes and their dreams about their big nights out, ‘look at me I’m dressed up and dancing’. There are so many hopes that people have when they go out. I’m fas­cin­ated by club culture at the moment. My boyfriend used to be a doorman so I’ll hear stories about how people act when they’re insecure, or how they act when they’re drunk. Clubs are like the new church for people – it’s where you go to feel a part of something bigger than yourself. With ‘Cry When You Get Older’ those lyrics were totally just taken out of the air and then when they came together they started meaning something – I think what they mean is that sometimes I wish I could go back to when I was 22 and just say, ‘don’t be so worried about everything. Do what you LIKE. It’s going to be okay!’. You get to a point – I’ve just turned thirty – where you realise ‘I’m not as afraid any more’. And I wish I could go back and tell myself that when I was younger. But it’s impossible. Do you think by Christmas, when you’ve released the last of these three albums and this campaign is pretty much over, you will have any new fans, or any different fans? 
I. Don’t. Know. I think it would be awesome, and it’s what I was thinking about when I made this record. I thought about… Well, not about selling records, but how to do what I did on the last record but better.  There are certain songs on the last record where I feel there’s stuff for me to explore, things I’m still curious about. ‘With Every Heartbeat’ started something in me where I felt like a found a place for my voice and my ‘sad person’, where it could take on a different shape and not be depress­ing or pre­ten­tious. It became something that gave people energy. I wanted to do more of that, so that’s how we came up with ‘Dancing On My Own’ and ‘Hang With Me’, and ‘Indestructible’. ‘Konichiwa Bitches’ was another important song because it gave me the kick-ass, fun-person voice I’ve always had but never been able to com­mu­nic­ate. And that’s something else I’ve been doing on this new record, too. So the idea has been to take those elements of those songs, but do it on steroids, to take it even further. To answer your question, I hope that’s going to result in a record that won’t exclude people, and is more access­ible but not in a com­mer­cial sense, just in a way that it invites people to feel stuff. What sort of person won’t like the album?
I think there’s lots of people who won’t like it. Lots of people in America dismiss dance music as something kitsch. It’s ‘bad music’. Do you think you’ve made a dance album?
No, but people will interpret four-to-the-floor beats that way, I think, and think it’s light­weight. Because it is elec­tronic and therefore ‘not authentic’.
Exactly. So people like that might not like it. I think there will be lots of thoughts about what this album is but I can’t really put words on it. I think people will always be sus­pi­cious because it’s pop music. Perhaps people are right to be sus­pi­cious of pop music, a genre that misleads and lies more than any other. Perhaps it’s right that people should try to test it.
Totally! The idea being that good pop music will pass the test.
Exactly. That’s exactly the thing. Good pop music always passes the test. ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202804.80/warc/CC-MAIN-20190323121241-20190323143241-00252.warc.gz

Answers: Santogold (obviously)  Hello Santogold. Are you enjoying the priv­ileges of being signed to a major label?
It's a machine. You get in and they are ready to go. It was easier for me because I didn't have to make the record, it was pretty much done and they already loved it. They asked me not to change anything on it — if anyone had tried to get in my way I'd have been like 'fuck it, I don't need your stupid record deal'.  Why isn't your good pal Mark Ronson on your album?
We planned to work together but it wasn't possible timing-wise. My whole record was written and recorded in eight weeks. When it was meant to come out on an inde­pend­ent label they were pushing me to deliver it imme­di­ately and we did. Mark wasn't around in those eight weeks and it just never happened. With all the label changes we had loads of oppor­tun­it­ies to go back and change stuff and I still never got a chance to get Mark involved. There's a little community of Mark Ronson col­lab­or­at­ors and friends knocking around now, isn't there. 
Kenna and I are friends and he's in my 'Creator' video which I have recently shot. He called me up and asked for my help on the Ashlee Simpson record, told me he was working with Chad Hugo from The Neptunes. I went in and Timbaland's producers were down­stairs and they heard what I was doing and asked me to go and work with them and it was great. I don't like song­writ­ing for other people but you can't turn down oppor­tun­it­ies to write with Chad or Timbaland. It's great exper­i­ence for me as a song­writer.  How did Ashlee Simpson get so many amazing people working on her new album?
Come on. It's just money. I go into the studio, everything you order comes on a silver platter — and I'm not kidding. They bring you chocolate chip cookies on a silver platter. A REAL silver platter. On the business side of things and from an exper­i­ence side of things, you're not going to turn down situ­ations like that. It's a formula, for all that type of music you hire the same producers and you get a certain level of quality because you pay for it. But it's a different thing entirely — it's not the same as artistic music. That's not the sort of pop music I talk about. It's a different world and it's for different people and for me the exper­i­ence of doing that is very important.  What did you learn from the exper­i­ence of Ashlee Simpson and her silver platters?
What I bring back to working on my stuff is the ability to write a chorus and for it to be 'boom – here comes the chorus'. When you're writing formula pop songs you have to be able to do that. So when you want to turn it into something that has meaning it's strong and you're working with all these things you want to pull together as one, you can just tap into something where you're guar­an­teed to know what is going to make a chorus pop. Once you can tap into all those elements, you're onto something special. Did you enjoy inter­act­ing with a horse for your 'LES Artistes' video?
I was fine while I was filming the video because I took allergy medicine, so the medicine did work, but then the next day it aggrav­ated my cold and became a crazy chest cough. Then I couldn't sleep all night and I was up from 2.30 in the morning until 1am the following morning and was outside from six in the morning until 11 at night shooting my video with a t-shirt on, sat on a horse. I wasn't in the best of ways. Do you need to mount another horse at any point in the immediate future?
I don't but I do love horses. I am going to keep trying this allergy medicine and take up a little bit of riding. What do we need to know about your amazing 'LES Artistes' single?
Well, it's 'L-E-S Artistes' and it stands for Lower East Side. It's not a French thing, it is playing on the fact that everyone tries to make things fancy and it's really pre­ten­tious. The song is about me moving back to New York, feeling really vul­ner­able, wanting to be an artist soaking up all sim­u­la­tion cre­at­ively but at the same time staying intro­ver­ted and in my own mind. At the same time, it's about being accosted by the New York scene and the scenesters and hipsters, who are really not artists and are just pre­tend­ing to be. They're all about just being seen. For people who haven't yet heard your album, should they expect songs like 'LES Artistes' or a racket like 'Creator'?
'LES Artistes' is not even the extreme of what I do. 'Creator' is extreme on one side, but 'Lights Out' is the other side — it is complete indie rock.  Oh dear…
All of the songs have a reggae or dub element. They've all got a folk quality too, very min­im­al­ist. The sound is very raw so that's the only real overall theme, but as an album it really covers a very wide spectrum. I think as far as song­writ­ing is concerned I know how to write catchy choruses and I know how to write melodies that are easy to follow. Within pop struc­tures I try to keep the music as inter­est­ing and as creative as possible. In the record you get all these different influ­ences mashed up together so you never know what is coming at you next. Thank you very much, Santogold.

30,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/articles/sophia-somajo-is-your-private-dancer/,"Last week Stockholm-based pop polymath Sophia Somajo released an intimate bleakpop reima­gin­ing of Tina Turner’s 80s behemoth Private Dancer, and in the coming weeks she’ll be featured on a fairly high profile col­lab­or­a­tion with a song she wrote in the same way she’s written music for many massive pop artists in the past — she imagined someone else would even­tu­ally sing it, so she finished the song and moved on. Ultimately the col­lab­or­ator liked Sophia’s vocal so much that they persuaded her to stay on the track, and the timing of Private Dancer, the first new music from Sophia’s upcoming Freudian Slip II EP, is no coin­cid­ence. “I want Private Dancer to be something you can listen to if you want to know more about me,” she says, but she’s already released an EP and two albums of idio­syn­cratic, per­son­al­ity-packed original material so at first glance it seems strange to that she hopes to introduce herself to new listeners with a cover version. “I've heard Private Dancer a billion times,” Sophia explains, “and I've always thought: ‘What a great chorus, but what's up with the saxophone?’ Then one day I listened to it dif­fer­ently.” Sophia’s ears opened when she heard Tina’s version on the radio during a late-night cab journey. (Songs always make the most sense in late-night cab journeys and that’s just a pop fact.) “I realised that in my career and in life in general I've been dancing, quote unquote, for men,” she says. “I've come to realise that in a room where a man has the last word, which is almost every room except the rooms in my apartment, you have to dance, in a way, to be heard. You have to strip. Many times in my career I've had meetings with very powerful men where I feel like their interest in me has a lot to do with that energy. The pos­sib­il­ity of… Something.” Sophia spent her early years in Stockholm and lived in Paris for three years in her teens, before a spell in an American high school led to a school concert per­form­ance that caught the eye of a parent who also happened to be a record executive. “I was signed to a devel­op­ment deal but didn't put out any music because appar­ently I was ‘stubborn’,” she says today. “I wasn't com­fort­able just being a ‘girl singer’, but I was quickly put in with teams of producers and song­writers, and they were always men, and they were always a lot older than I was. They would work nine to five, banging out hits. I’d been writing for years, but wasn’t invited in to write songs at that point, let alone produce. It was always a case of ‘don't touch the buttons’. Being young and a woman I could only be a singer, and that was it.” Sophia says that Max Martin, with whose team Sophia’s been working as a writer for about a decade, proved to be a rare exception. “Max is actually one of the few people that isn’t like that at all,” she adds. “He was the one giving me a voice, because he wanted my per­spect­ive. He is the one who gave me a chance and treated me like an equal. He gave me my first real honest shot and I’ve seen him use his position again and again to empower women’s roles in the industry, with artists like myself, Tove Lo and Laleh, and with backing The Equalizer Project. But elsewhere, it hasn’t been so positive.” She talks about producers who’ll want to work with her, but really they'll just want to meet in a bar over drinks. Then there are the recording sessions that happen to take place in hotel rooms, where she’s invited to stay over. It’s all fucking grim to be honest. “So anyway, “ Sophia says, returning to the theme of Private Dancer, “when I listened to the song in the back of that cab I thought: ‘Yeah. Keep your eyes on the wall, keep your mind on the money and just fucking dance, then go home and have a shower.” There is, of course, the fact that Private Dancer was written by Mark Knopfler — quite literally, a man. “The whole full-circle irony is that he wrote that song,” Sophia laughs. “I think he did a good job but the irony is genius. It resonated with me. But it's inter­est­ing that so often in popular culture when women relate to women, they’re actually relating to women as inter­preted by men. Pop culture shapes us, we all accept that. We grow up listening to music and watching movies. When I think about a lot of my heroes in film, a lot of the time the directors and screen­writers have been men. It’s the same in pop: men write women from a male per­spect­ive and young girls shape their iden­tit­ies based on those per­spect­ives.” Sophia herself is familiar with writing in character. Search for her song­writ­ing credits alongside Max’s team and you’ll only find a few examples, like Robyn’s Time Machine, but that’s because the vast majority of her work has been written under a number of pseud­onyms — about ten, she reckons, “and I come up with different char­ac­ters for each of them.” One of those char­ac­ters is Tiffany Amber. Tiffany wrote 3 and Criminal for Britney Spears, for instance, as well as Christina Aguilera’s Your Body. It’s fun to write as Tiffany, Sophia says, because Tiffany feels like she’s farthest from Sophia on the artistic spectrum. “Tiffany Amber does her nails on the regular,” Sophia decides. “She drinks everything through a straw and she's written for Britney, Christina and Backstreet Boys — all her idols.” “It's nothing to do with me being ashamed of these projects,” Sophia says of the multiple pseud­onyms. It’s more about managing expect­a­tions when it comes to her own work. “If you listen to my first album and think ‘Max Martin’, my music will come off as unfin­ished and unpol­ished and, well, just badly executed. If you listen from the per­spect­ive of 'here's a DIY artist with little or no budget exper­i­ment­ing in her bedroom and she has no pro­fes­sional training', you can maybe hear something.” She made a rare exception and used her own name on Time Machine by Robyn — “a Swedish artist who’s really paved the way for me and so many other Swedish artists.” There are hints of Robyn’s vision, artistry and fear­less­ness in what Sophia’s been doing since 2008’s The Laptop Diaries but last year’s Freudian Slip felt like her most fully-realised moment yet so it seems reas­on­able to have high hopes for Freudian Slip II. In the meantime, Sophia’s forth­com­ing col­lab­or­a­tion may introduce her back catalogue to some new ears. “It's never happened before that I’ve written a song like that and thought, 'ah, actually, let me sing this’,” she says. “It’s exciting. Maybe there will be a bit of noise around the col­lab­or­a­tion, and hopefully my music will be exposed to a larger audience.” .

32,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/articles/the-2011-popjustice-readers-poll-the-results/74616/," Right then. Thousands of you voted. We did some adding up which took even longer than usual for some reason. We put our addings-up in order. And here is what we came up with. 1. Rihanna feat Calvin Harris — We Found Love 2. Will Young — Jealousy 3. Lady Gaga — The Edge Of Glory 4. Nicola Roberts — Beat Of My Drum 5. Marina & The Diamonds — Radioactive 6. Britney Spears — Til The World Ends 7. The Saturdays — All Fired Up 8. One Direction — What Makes You Beautiful 9. Robyn — Call Your Girlfriend 10. Lana Del Rey — Video Games EDITOR'S NOTE: Look we checked and double checked and no your eyes do not deceive you: Popjustice readers really did neglect to vote for Matt Cardle in this category. 1. Cher Lloyd — Swagger Jagger 2. LMFAO — Party Rock Anthem 3. LMFAO — Sexy And I Know It 4. Lady Gaga — Born This Way 5. Jessie J — Price Tag 6. Matt Cardle — Run For Your Life 7. Bruno Mars — The Lazy Song 8. JLS — She Makes Me Wanna 9. Justin Bieber — Mistletoe 10. Ed Sheeran — The A Team EDITOR'S NOTE: Perhaps LMFAO should spend a little less time apo­lo­gising for 'party rocking' and a little more time being quiet and/or fucking off. JUST AN IDEA. 1. Britney Spears — Femme Fatale 2. Lady Gaga — Born This Way 3. Will Young — Echoes 4. Nicola Roberts — Cinderella's Eyes 5. The Sound Of Arrows — Voyage 6. Beyoncé — 4 7. Adele — 21 8. Kelly Clarkson — Stronger 9. Florence & The Machine — Ceremonials 10. Sophie Ellis-Bextor — Make A Scene EDITOR'S NOTE: Britney won this category by some distance. Well done, Britney's mental fans. 1. Jessie J — Who You Are 2. JLS — Jukebox 3. Beyoncé — 4 4. Cher Lloyd — Sticks & Stones 5. Ed Sheeran — + 6. LMFAO — Sorry For Party Rocking 7. Matt Cardle — Letters 8. Lady Gaga — Born This Way 9. Pixie Lott — Young Foolish Happy 10. The Wanted — Battleground EDITOR'S NOTE: The Wanted, Pixie Lott and JLS all more than earned their positions on this list. Their albums were proper will-this-do efforts and looking at their chart runs the response from record buyers — encour­agingly, in a sense — was 'no, not really'. This is a hollow victory, however. There are no winners here. Only losers. 1. Will Young 2. Adele 3. Britney Spears 4. Jennifer Lopez 5. Kelly Clarkson 6. Kate Bush 7. Beyoncé 8. Steps 9. Melanie C 10. Darren Hayes EDITOR'S NOTE: We did state in the rules to this that the artist needed to have been away for a couple of years, but we allowed Jennifer Lopez in even though she had a single out last year. The fact that so many people clearly didn't even notice that she had anything out in 2010 makes her return to 'the pop summit' in 2011 all the more spec­tac­u­lar. 1. Dappy 2. Nicola Roberts 3. Joe Jonas 4. Nadine 2.0 5. Gary Barlow 6. Kelly Rowland 7. Nicole Scherzinger 8. Keisha Buchanan 9. Noel Gallagher 10. Howie D EDITOR'S NOTE: What's your favourite line in the Dappy song? The Chris Brown one is quite funny, but ""I’ll blow the bloody doors off — Michael Caine"" is pretty special in its own way. (Brian May is on the next Dappy single — sadface times five million.) 1. Jessie J 2. Jason Derulo 3. Jedward 4. Lady Gaga 5. Justin BIeber 6. LMFAO 7. Pitbull 8. Nicki Minaj 9. Rebecca Black 10. Pixie Lott EDITOR'S NOTE: Sometimes you think 'oh Jessie J isn't really that ridicu­lous' then you turn on the telly and there she is in her pants doing her best to avoid any of the notes that make her songs quite nice to listen to and passing it all off as 'putting on a show' and you think, 'well yes, she is quite ridicu­lous after all'. 1. One Direction 2. Cher Lloyd 3. Jessie J 4. The Sound Of Arrows 5. Emeli Sandé 6. Katy B 7. Rizzle Kicks 8. Birdy (!) 9. Ed Sheeran (!!!!!) 10. Lana Del Rey EDITOR'S NOTE: Shame the One Direction album was only half finished, right viewers? RIGHT? Right. 1. Scott Mills 2. Annie Mac 3. Sara Cox 4. Greg James 5. 'None Of Them' / 'They're All Shit' etc 6. Lauren Laverne 7. Chris Moyles 8. Fearne Cotton 9. Nick Grimshaw 10. Zane Lowe EDITOR'S NOTE: If we had to pick 'best haircut' on this list of DJs we'd probably go Annie Mac, Greg James, Nick Grimshaw On A Good Day, Fearne Cotton. Then we'd stop thinking about DJs' haircuts because it's all about the music man, and Scott Mills does play the best music out of all that lot, so well done for voting him Number One. 1. The X Factor 2. Never Mind The Buzzcocks 3. Glee 4. Steps Reunion 5. Freshly Squeezed 6. Later With Jools Holland 7. The Album Chart Show 8. Songs Of Praise 9. Celebrity Juice 10. Made In Chelsea EDITOR'S NOTE: Quite a few of you made special mention of Made In Chelsea in your voting forms, and we're glad we weren't alone in noticing that the show's music choices were con­sist­ently brilliant. We think it's all down to a lady called Marsha Shandur — she's on Twitter at @marshamusic so why not drop her a quick line to say ""HI AND THANKS""? Actually you can click here to send that tweet auto­mat­ic­ally if you like. 1. Little Mix — Don't Let Go 2. Florence & The Machine — Take Care 3. Glee Cast — Rumour Has It / Someone Like You 4. Lady Gaga — Born This Way 5. Adele — Promise This 6. Nicola Roberts — Everybody's Gotta Learn Sometime 7. Susan Boyle — Enjoy The Silence 8. Misha B — Rolling In The Deep 9. Sunday Girl — Love U More 10. Will Young — Running Up That Hill EDITOR'S NOTE: We see what you did there at Number 4. Naturally for legal reasons we should note that 'Born This Way' is in fact a com­pletely original com­pos­i­tion and any sim­il­ar­ity to any other song is a complete coin­cid­ence because the song came to Lady Gaga in a vision etc etc etc. 1. Little Mix 2. Lana Del Rey 3. Emeli Sandé 4. Icona Pop 5. Azealia Banks 6. StooShe 7. Oh My! 8. WooWoos 9. Misha B 10. Vanbot EDITOR'S NOTE: Remember how about 14 months ago Jessie J seemed like she was really exciting because she'd chosen to show a certain side of her music while keeping the Natasha Bedingfield stuff hidden until everyone had already decided she was the next big thing and it was too late to go 'oh actually she's quite different in reality'? Remember that? Well good luck with listening to the Emeli Sandé album. 1. Madonna 2. Girls Aloud 3. Kylie Minogue 4. Marina & The Diamonds 5. Diana Vickers 6. Steps 7. Alexandra Burke 8. No Doubt 9. Cheryl Cole 10. Robyn EDITOR'S NOTE: DON'T FUCK THIS UP MADGE. 1. J Lo — On The Floor 2. Jason Derulo — Don't Wanna Go Home 3. LMFAO — Party Rock Anthem 4. David Guetta feat etc etc — Little Bad Girl 5. JLS — She Makes Me Wanna 6. David Guetta feat etc etc — Where Dem Girls At 7. Pitbull — Give Me Everything 8. Pixie Lott — All About Tonight 9. The Saturdays — Notorious 10. Kelly Rowland — Down For Whatever EDITOR'S NOTE: If anybody is in any doubt, it can sometimes be quite good fun to go for a dance and have a drink or two while you're at it. We just wanted to clear that up. 1. Rihanna & Calvin 2. Maroon 5 & Christina 3. Britney, Nicki & Ke$ha 4. Calvin Harris & Kelis 5. Drake & Rihanna 6. Coldplay & Rihanna 7. Jay-Z & Kanye 8. David Guetta & Sia 9. Katy Perry & Kanye 10. Lady Gaga & Tony Bennett EDITOR'S NOTE: Imagine if all these people had children together. Well Rihanna would be busy, for a start. 1. Adele 2. Leona Lewis 3. Rebecca Ferguson 4. Ed Sheeran 5. Pixie Lott 6. Joe McElderry 7. Beyonce 8. Taylor Swift 9. The Saturdays 10. Will Young EDITOR'S NOTE: Did you know that Rebecca Ferguson is really different to other X Factor graduates because she *falls asleep at desk* 1. 2012 2. 2013 3. Never 4. 2014 5. 2015 EDITOR'S NOTE: We've got our fingers crossed for 2012 too but we don't want it to be anything to do with The Bloody Olympics. We want it to be amazing in its own right although we do, of course, want any accom­pa­ny­ing 'cine­ma­to­graphy' to have a budget at least three times that of the Olympic opening ceremony. Mind you this is Girls Aloud so anything upwards of the cost of a Bounty would be fine. 1. Little Mix 2. Misha 3. Amelia 4. Marcus 5. Kitty 6. Sophie 7. 2 Shoes 8. Janet 9. Craig 10. Johnny 11. Jonjo 12. The Risk 13. Frankie 14. James 15. Sami EDITOR'S NOTE: We don't even recognise half these names. 1. Frankie 2. Craig 3. Jonjo 4. James 5. The Risk 6. Kitty 7. Amelia 8. Marcus 9. Sophie 10. Janet 11. Johnny 12. 2 Shoes 13. Misha 14. Sami 15.Little Mix EDITOR'S NOTE: Poor old Craig with his Defiant Gunfingers Of Doom. Oh well, at least he's in [NAME WITHHELD]'s shag tree, that's not bad going under the cir­cum­stances. 1. Gary Barlow 2. Louis Walsh 3. Kelly Rowland 4. Tulisa EDITOR'S NOTE: We don't reckon Gary will be back for next year's X Factor. We'd be surprised if Kelly is, either, to be honest, although we thought she did a far better job of being an X Factor judge than Gary did. Look we're still upset about what he did to Alesha Dixon's pop career. That wound is RAW. No we don't want to talk about it. Time is what it will take. Plenty of time. 1. Rihanna 2. Cheryl Cole 3. Will Young 4. Kylie 5. Lady Gaga 6. Example 7. Calvin Harris 8. Little Boots 9. Cher 10. Tom Fletcher EDITOR'S NOTE: We like it when Rihanna calls people cunts. 1. Katy Perry — Last Friday Night (TGIF) 2. Britney Spears — I Wanna Go 3. Rihanna — We Found Love 4. Lady Gaga — Judas 5. Beyonce — Run The World (Girls) 6. Nicola Roberts — Beat Of My Drum 7. Will Young — Come On 8. Lady Gaga — You + I 9. Lady Gaga — Marry The Night 10. The Saturdays — All Fired Up EDITOR'S NOTE: That Katy Perry video is so amazing isn't it. Perfectly, very precisely executed, but with the feeling that it's com­pletely carefree and spon­tan­eous. It feels — in the best possible way — as if nobody was trying very hard. It's a video that should serve as a good reminder to all popstars — including Katy, and espe­cially Lady Gaga — that pop fre­quently works best when it doesn't look like hard work. 1. Lady Gaga — The Edge Of Glory 2. Pixie Lott — All About Tonight 3. Nicola Roberts — Lucky Day 4. Lady Gaga — Born This Way 5. Britney Spears — Hold It Against Me 6. Katy Perry — The One That Got Away 7. Jennifer Lopez — Papi 8. Cher Lloyd — Swagger Jagger 9. One Direction — Gotta Be You 10. LMFAO — Sexy And I Know I EDITOR'S NOTE: That LMFAO video just makes you feel like you need to go for an STD test, doesn't it. 1. Frankie Cocozza 2. Gary Barlow 3. Pitbull 4. Jessie J 5. Lady Gaga 6. Matt Cardle 7. Justin Bieber 8. Olly Murs 9. Example 10. Kelly Rowland EDITOR'S NOTE: Frankie Cocozza, if he even notices this 'win' at all, will no doubt think that this is all the work of haters. He must be doing something right, he'll tell himself, if he gets this sort of reaction. At least people are talking about him. People shouldn't believe what they read in the papers, he'll say. People are too jealous, or too old, or too out of touch, to get what he's all about. People simply cannot handle his swag. And one day, when he's about 29, he'll realise that the reason he won the 2011 Popjustice Readers' Poll category for Utter Bellend was that he is, in fact, simply an utter bellend. 1. Mollie 2. Frankie 3. Una 4. Rochelle 5. Vanessa EDITOR'S NOTE: This was always going to be a con­tro­ver­sial category (trans­la­tion: least con­tro­ver­sial category of all time) but we are pleased to see Mollie come out on top as she is the best one to interview. 1. Rihanna 2. Katy Perry 3. Gary Barlow 4. Beyonce 5. Zayn Malik 6. Harry Styles 7. Olly Murs 8. Calvin Harris 9. Michael Bublé 10. Shakira EDITOR'S NOTE: Not an unat­tract­ive selection of enter­tain­ers. We told you that the world was about to explode and that the one escape pod only had two seats. We told you that a man had to go in one seat and a woman had to go in the other, and that between them they would be respons­ible for the future of the human race. Here's who you picked. THE MAN

Natalia Kills 6. Frankie Cocozza 7. Alexandra Burke 8. Christina Aguilera 9. Dappy 10. Gary Barlow EDITOR'S NOTE: 'The Fall Of Cardle' has been quite something to behold, hasn't it. Poor Matt Cardle. 1. Steps 2. Little Mix 3. Adele 4. One Direction 5. Johnny Robinson 6. S Club 7 7. 2 Shoes 8. Nicola Roberts 9. Sugababes 10. The Saturdays EDITOR'S NOTE: Sugababes would be hilarious. 1. Justin Bieber 2. Lady Gaga 3. Sugababes 4. JLS 5. One Direction 6. Madonna 7. Westlife 8. Adam Lambert 9. Rihanna 10. Britney Spears EDITOR'S NOTE: This was very mean of you and we do not endorse or agree with any of these choices. (EXCEPT ALL OF THEM.) 1. Marina & The Diamonds 2. CocknBullKid 3. Nicola Roberts 4. Natalia Kills 5. Melanie C 6. Lady Gaga 7. The Sound Of Arrows 8. Florrie 9. Hurts 10. Clare Maguire EDITOR'S NOTE: We're not really sure Lady Gaga counts as 'under­rated' to be honest, but we get the point some of you were trying to make. As for the Melanie C inclusion: this is what happens when you leave voting to the public. 1. Less 2. More EDITOR'S NOTE: This was a fairly even split — 56% wanted less Gaga in 2012, 44% wanted more. That will def­in­itely be useful for her. Perhaps she could do less while at the same time doing more. Actually that's not as ridicu­lous as it seems. 1. Crazy Cats (Pixie Lott) 2. Little Monsters (Lady Gaga) 3. Heartbeats (Jessie J) 4. Brats (Cher Lloyd) 5. Little Muffins (Little Mix) 6. Beasties (Alexandra Burke) 7. Bunnies (Leona Lewis) 8. Rihanna Navy 9.

33,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/articles/the-2017-popjustice-readers-poll-the-results/,"So we made a mistake when we launched the voting for this year's Popjustice Readers' Poll. At the top of the entry form was a pho­to­graph of Louis Tomlinson with a red cross drawn right across his face. And in the intro­duct­ory blurb we explained that any votes for Louis Tomlinson as 'best anything' would not be counted. Well, as you might expect, this didn't go down very well with Louis Tomlinson fans. His is a fandom that ranks among the most uptight on the internet but, well, if for whatever reason you're a fan of an artist, it's unpleas­ant to see that artist being cri­ti­cised. We get that. Perhaps some of the Louis fandom's aggress­ive­ness comes from a place of insec­ur­ity, and perhaps they're more aware than they care to admit that Louis' career is as pre­cari­ous as it is under­whelm­ing, but whatever: some people were sad because of what we had done. So, we haven't included Louis in any of the best cat­egor­ies, even though Louis Tomlinson fans voted for him in those cat­egor­ies anyway. But in the interests of fairness, and because our stance on Louis might have unfairly influ­enced some of the negative voting in other parts of the poll, nor have we included Louis' name in any of the worst cat­egor­ies, even though the votes suggested he would have appeared in many of them and won two. What we're left with, then, is a view of the pop world without any Louis Tomlinson in it. To Louis fans, we hope this is an accept­able solution. To everyone else, enjoy this exclusive glimpse into what the world of pop will be like in 2019. And without 'further' 'ado'…

34,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/articles/the-full-length-actual-mutya-keisha-siobhan-interview/,"So they were like 'do you want to interview Mutya Keisha Siobhan' and we were like 'yes' and then we did it and they were like 'would you like to tease it with some excerpts to start with then run the full interview after­wards' and we were like 'not really but we suppose that's alright' and they were like 'cheers' and then we were like 'let's run the full thing by the end of August then' and they were like 'alright' and now here we are. So here it is: Mutya Keisha Siobhan's first interview in over a decade. Hello.
All: Hello! This is quite funny isn’t it.
Mutya: Very. Why do you find it funny?
Mutya: We’re here! Doing an interview with you! Who would have thought, eh?
Keisha: Not us!
Mutya: Well, it was def­in­itely meant to happen. It was just a matter of timing — when we were all ready.
Keisha: Well I would never have thought we’d be doing this again.
Mutya: Oh, okay… (Giggles)
Keisha: I always wanted to though. I remember listening to the ‘One Touch’ album and thinking, “what if…?”. I suppose there was a ‘to be continued’ type of vibe. Did you listen to it after you left the Sugababes?
Keisha: Um, I was trying to just be normal for a minute, and get my head into other genres of music after I was in the Sugababes. One of the questions new girlbands — which you sort of are — get asked, is: ‘how did you get together?’. So, how did you get together?
Siobhan: We met when we were twelve and thirteen. They went to primary school together. Mutya and I were both signed to our manager Ron Tom as solo artists but we wanted to work together. Keisha came down to the studio that night and it just seemed very natural that the three of us would sing together. We did, it worked out well on that track, and the band was formed. So you released some records. People went, ‘these are good’.
Mutya: Yep! It wasn’t a massive success, though.
Siobhan: It was crit­ic­ally acclaimed! It went gold! Which these days is actually pretty impress­ive, but in those days people weren’t happy. So then what happened?
Keisha: And then Siobhan left the group, and me and Mutya went on to change labels so we went from London Records to Island. Heidi joined. And, yes. We put out ‘Freak Like Me’. Siobhan, how did you feel when they put out ‘Freak Like Me’ and everyone was going, ‘this band is brilliant’?
Siobhan: I loved it! People have to remember that we were in the band for five years before I left — it wasn’t exactly a flash in the pan. It was a lot of hard work. We were homeschooled. We built something that I was very proud of and it was actually genuinely very nice to see it continue. Did you really leave by climbing through a toilet window while Keisha and Mutya were doing an interview?
Siobhan: (Laughs) I didn’t leave through a toilet window! It seemed quite sudden, from the outside…
Siobhan: It might have seemed sudden from the outside but I’d been unhappy for a while. It was an unusual childhood that we had. I just wanted some normality back in my life. I’d reached a point where I felt I had to go off and do that. I didn’t regret it, I never have: I had great time in the band but I had to go off and do my own thing. But I’m also incred­ibly happy that we get to make this second album together now. This is the right time. The thing is, if you’d stayed together, you would have split up by now. So you never would have made this album you’re making now.
Siobhan: Also, the album we’re making now is quite positive. And we wouldn’t have made an an album like that back then. This actually feels like the perfect record that would have come after the first. Let’s talk about this perfect record you’re making. You’ve been in the studio since…
Mutya: November. Blimey.
Mutya: Yes. And the music’s coming out next year?
Siobhan: There will be something to hear this year. The album will be next year. What are your three favourite songs from the sessions so far?
Keisha: There’s a song called ‘Drum’ which we all love — it was one of the first songs we did. Actually, before we got signed to our label we’d finished half the album already. It was all about just going in and vibing off each other.
Siobhan: In the beginning we were left to our own devices to figure out exactly what we wanted to do. And the nice thing about ‘Drum’ is that we were working with a guy called MNEK who’s 17, and he’s incred­ible. It’s really exciting to work with someone like that who’s really fresh. ‘Drum’ is kind of Afrobeat. How does it go?
Keisha: It’s just of repet­it­ive — “I love it when you beat that drum…”. It’s really inspired by Rihanna, one of the tracks on her album. How about another song?
Keisha: Another one we all love is called ‘Love Me Hard’ — we did that with Biff and wrote it with Iain James. It was lots of fun — we knew Iain from before, from when he was in Triple 8. Another song we’ve done is called ‘Back In The Day’, and that was produced by Mojam, who were in Blazin’ Squad.
Mutya: They’re amazing. So the early-2000s pop gang is back together!
Keisha: Basically, yes! ‘Back In The Day’ has a strong TLC vibe, we’ve been ref­er­en­cing them a lot.
Siobhan: There’s a lot of early-90s R&B in there — it’s what inspired us to get into music in the first place. So to start off with, before you had a label involved or a label A&R getting tracks in for you, what sort of message were you sending out to writers and producers? What did you say you wanted your music to sound like?
Siobhan: None. There was no message. It was all about coming in on the day and being com­pletely open-minded about where we could go with it.
Keisha: So they’d play us loads of [backing] tracks and we’d go ‘yes, we like that one’, ‘no, we’re not into that one’. Then we’d get a mic and we’d just put most of the melodies down. Most of the album was recorded like that — I can’t remember being in a booth once for this album.
Siobhan: Which is what we did with the ‘One Touch’ record. It gives it a sightly raw element, so there’s not a com­pletely polished finish. Is it quite hard to spend so much time on something you don’t want to sound too polished?
Siobhan: No, it’s nice to keep in the glitches — it gives it character and you’ve just got to be confident enough to live with it and go, “that’s the one — we don’t need to perfect it”. We haven’t revoc­alled anything during these sessions, they’re the original demo vocals. What’s the vibe of the album going to be? Upbeat, downbeat, mid-tempo…?
Mutya: It’s a bit of a mixture.
Sioban: We started off with a lot of mid-tempo. It seemed like a natural place for us to sit because we love emotive melodies and lyrics and that works with mid-tempo, but we’ve been con­cen­trat­ing a lot more on uptempo tracks towards the end of the album sessions. It will be a 50/50 mix in the end. ‘Drum’, for example, is one of the first uptempos we did and it’s still one of our favourite tracks. Where were you when you first sang together again, and what did it feel like?
Keisha: The first vocals we did were in some Xenomania sessions — we went in and did some choruses and stuff.
Siobhan: But the first time we sang in a room together and worked out our harmonies and sang them together was recording ‘Too In Love’, with Mojam.
Keisha: It was the first time we’d sang together since we were 16 years old. To be honest with you it wasn’t an instant thing. When we were younger we gelled straight away, but we had to learn to blend with each other again.
Mutya: It’s been a while!
Keisha: Yes. It was when we came to do ‘Love Me Hard’ — that’s when I first properly heard us blending.
Siobhan: That’s when we knew that we properly had to get back together. The reason we didn’t fully commit to getting back together without singing together was that you never know if that magic is still going to be there. If it’s not going to be as magical as the first time around you don’t really want to do it, do you. The minute we sang together, we looked at each other, and we knew. It just worked.
Mutya: It was emotional.
Keisha: It was so special to be excited about hearing our voices together, and being excited about our music. On my days off I’d go home and I’d listen to the tracks. I’d be like, ‘I’m really enjoying this’. I just enjoyed our music.
Mutya: We’ve got some really good songs.
Siobhan: For me, it’s the first time in years that I’ve been excited about even attempt­ing a music project. I’m super-excited. You still had a day job for a while, didn’t you?
Siobhan: All three of us were testing the waters to see if the magic was there. But the minute we knew we wanted to do it, I handed in my notice. What was your notice period?
Siobhan: It was four weeks but I worked for Sarah Ducas at Storm and she’s amazing woman and she was never going to make me work my notice period. Everyone there was really happy and excited about what I was doing. You didn’t leave by going out the toilet window, then?
Siobhan: I didn’t leave by going out the toilet window, no. Have you talked about what songs you’re going to do when you perform live.
Mutya: No, actually. We’d like to do some classics from the first album and some songs from when Siobhan wasn’t in the band…
Siobhan: I’m happy to sing those. How about ‘Get Sexy’?
Keisha: (Ignoring question, over sound of Mutya guffawing) Siobhan really likes ‘Stronger’, she likes ‘Freak Like Me’… To be fair I think it’s important to reference all the big songs we’ve done.
Siobhan: ‘Stronger’ is a Sugababes classic. I’m not precious about that at all.
Mutya: There’s a lot of songs!
Keisha: Even by the time I left we’d had 28 singles. So we’ll pick our best for our first comeback gig.
Mutya: We don’t want to dwell on the past too much though when we’ve got so much new stuff. Would you do any of your solo stuff?
Mutya: No.
Keisha: I didn’t have any!
Siobhan: It’s confusing enough as it is, without adding in the solo songs! Going back to how the three of you came to be back together right now, what was the first phonecall or email that set everything in motion? Who asked whom?
Keisha: Well, back in 2009 I was contacted by the girls through my lawyer, and they were kind of like, ‘do you want to meet up?’. We all met up. I’d only been out of the band for three months and I’d just had enough of girlbands. I’d had enough of the WHOLE THING. Mutya and Siobhan, why did you feel that you had to contact Keisha through your lawyers? That’s quite formal.
Keisha: It’s never formal like that — Mutya hangs out with my dad on the weekend! Really?!
Mutya: Yes.
Keisha: So anyway it wasn’t like that. It’s never been like that — even when Siobhan left the group her mum and my mum were really close. Anyway, basically, they contacted me and we sat together and I actually really wanted to see the girls. Me meeting up with them was more about me wanting to see them than actually thinking about getting the band back together. Because like I say it was only three months after I’d left the Sugababes. So we decided not to do it. And then last year… So in 2009 you decided not to do it just because you’d only just left the Sugababes?
Keisha: Yes.
Siobhan: We didn’t decide not to do it — we just decided not to do it then.
Keisha: But then last year, in 2011, we were contacted by a producer. He put it to us: he said, “let’s record a few tracks and then see”. And we did. And we loved it. Who was the producer?
Keisha: Brian Higgins.
Siobhan: He actually called me which was weird because I’d never worked with him before. So he calls up and says, “hello, I’m Brian Higgins, let’s make some music”?
Siobhan: Yes. And I said I’d only do it if it was with the other girls. (Firmly) I didn’t want to do another project on my own. Your second album was extremely good.
Siobhan: I love that album. And that’s the point. I hadn’t reached the stage where I thought I could better my last album. So what would be the point in making another one? In my mind I thought I’d get married and have kids and then come back to music in another ten years.
Mutya: Wow!
Siobhan: But that was me thinking about being a solo artist. I just didn’t know what the story would have been for a new solo record, do you know what I mean? I so infre­quently gel with producers, musically. Basically I had no interest. So it needed to be something fucking brilliant to get you back into pop?
Siobhan: Yes, and this is fucking brilliant. So anyway, Brian said, “alright then, I’ll get the gang back together”?
Siobhan: Yes.
Keisha: We basically said, “yes, but we want to do it on our own terms”.
Siobhan: We didn’t want anyone to organise it for us. We wanted to steer the ship ourselves, which is what we did. If this was a ship or seafaring craft, what would it be?
Siobhan: What would it look like? QE2, rubber dinghy, pirate ship, pedalo…
Siobhan: I’ve got a really nice picture of a ship on my phone actually. Let me find it…
Mutya: We’d be a big ship.
Keisha: A tight ship!
Mutya: A big tight ship. A YACHT! On battle­ships they used to paint the decks red so the blood wouldn’t show.
Mutya: We’re not that bad!
Siobhan: (Brandishes phone with ship picture on it) Here you go.
Mutya: It looks like the Titanic! (Explodes with laughter) Here’s a clunky way of extending this metaphor. If someone were to jump ship, what would happen?
Siobhan: Then that would be the end of that.
Keisha: We’ve had dis­cus­sions. We have a way of working: we trust each other. We look after each other. We are genuinely there for each other. If we were unhappy we’d tell each other and we’d figure it out, between ourselves.
Siobhan: Everything is a group decision this time round.
Keisha: There will be no over­work­ing people to the point where they’re depressed. There’s none of that stuff. We all have the same inten­tions. You need that. I’ve always wanted to be part of something where I genuinely felt sis­ter­hood, and I feel like I’ve def­in­itely found that now.
Mutya: Well thank you very much. You mentioned being worked until you were depressed. Is that something you all had problems with before?
Keisha: I feel like in general you see people — people like Rihanna — or people who are hos­pit­al­ised through exhaus­tion. That’s no way to work. Hard work is fine, but when it puts you in hospital you kind of need a week off. We’re not going to get to that point.
Mutya: We’ll work hard but we’ll have fun with it too! Your band name would make it different for anyone to leave, and even more difficult for someone else to join.
Mutya: That’s why we did it! (Laughs) Who chose the order?
Siobhan: People seem to say it in that order quite naturally. It seems to roll off the tongue like that.
Keisha: Mutya, can I just say something? I found a link the other day which I really want to show you. It’s a clip of you when you’re 16 and they ask you why we came up with the name ‘Sugababes’. And you go: “Well we had to have a band name because we couldn’t have people just calling us Mutya, Keisha, Siobhan”. (Everyone laughs) Amazing! It’s so cute, it’s when you were innocent.
Mutya: I’m still innocent! What do you think people will call you?
Mutya: They’re going to call us the Sugababes anyway. Guaranteed.
Siobhan: I’ve been out of the band for this long and I’m still con­stantly referred to as Siobhan-from-the-Sugababes.
Keisha: We went through so many names. Such as?
Siobhan: Well we can’t tell you one of them, because it’s going to be the name of the album. The original Sugababes lineup getting back together seems very exciting. But sometimes one wonders if it’s just exciting to a load of internet mentals.
Keisha: I know what you mean, but we walk down the street and people… Say “hey sexy”?
Keisha: …(ignoring comment) are always going “oh my God you’ve got to do something with the girls again”…
Mutya: It’s true.
Keisha: The public seem really sup­port­ive of this so far.
Siobhan: It’s almost got to the point where we would feel guilty if we didn’t do it. People wanted it so much that we would have been letting people down! No pressure then.
Mutya: No pressure! (Laughs) It seems a bit like in the time since you were first together, the myth of ‘the original Sugababes lineup’ has got bigger than you ever were at the time? Like what happened with Jesus. 
Keisha: But for us, when we started it felt really organic and now we’re back together it feels the same — really effort­less.
Siobhan: I think that album has stood the test of time really well. It doesn’t sound dated.
Keisha: If it wasn’t for that album, Mutya and I wouldn’t have been able to go on to do the things we went on to do. As soon as we left London we had labels chasing us — within six months we were halfway through another album with another label. So what happened when you left London?
Keisha: Well we were dropped, let’s be honest. But why did they say they were dropping you?
Keisha: Well it was for a number of reasons — we couldn’t promote as much as they wanted us to. At that time we could only work 72 days a year because we were under 16 and that really had an impact. But it was also record sales. And that was it really. And to be fair, we weren’t really a tight-knit thing…
Siobhan: …and they probably didn’t know that when I left there would be someone else joining the band. So they kind of let it go before they saw what it was going to become. So London didn’t know that someone else was going to join the band?
Siobhan: No.
Keisha: Well neither did we! At the time me and Mutya were told that we were going to have auditions, but we later found out that she [Heidi] was already in the band. But we were taken through an audition period, ‘to make it feel organic’.
Mutya: Which was quite painful actually. So you thought you were audi­tion­ing for a third member, but someone had already been given the job?
Keisha: Yes! Actually one of my best friends came down and audi­tioned.
Mutya: It was painful to watch loads of girls sing.
Keisha: It was very awkward. Anyway, it was a great move to Island.
Siobhan: Actually I do want to say that London Records were great back then — Tracy Bennett, if ever there was a guy that going to take a risk… I mean who else would have listened to Overload and pushed for that as the first single for such a young band? No-one. He was a legend, he was brilliant for what he did with that label. Who are your fans going to be now?
Keisha: There will be older people, of course, who were there the first time…
Mutya: …but I think there will be people who had no idea about what we did before.
Keisha: I’m excited for younger people to get to know us. Mutya, if one wanted to print up some sta­tion­ery, perhaps some Post-It style notes, with the word ‘SUGABABES’ on, as the trademark holder would you be the person to ask?
Mutya: Yes, basically. (Laughs) To tell you the truth I was quite shocked about that myself. [Editor's note: We sub­sequently clarified this with Mutya and basically her manager at the time filed the initial trademark request on her behalf.] But you know what, at least I’ve still got my hand on the Sugababes in some way! (Laughs) If Comic Relief came to you and said, ‘HIYA, we’d like you to do the next Comic Relief single with the current lineup of the Sugababes’, would…
Keisha: (Immediately) No!
Siobhan: What was the question? …would you do it?
Siobhan: Oh right! When you said ‘the current lineup of the Sugababes’, I thought, “that’s us, right?” (Amid uproar) I got really confused!
Mutya: We’d say no, but there’s no hate in it.
Keisha: No. Would you do it with Girls Aloud?
Siobhan: (Gasps)
Mutya: Why not? I LOVE Girls Aloud. I’ve always liked the girls.
Keisha: That would be a good thing.
Siobhan: And we’re so different that I actually think we’d com­ple­ment each other. Keisha, can you explain the exact sequence of events regarding you leaving the Sugababes?
Keisha: Have you got an hour? (Much chortling) Basically, I can’t say too much about it – legally I’ve been told I can’t speak about it. But what I will say is that when everyone else found out I wasn’t in the group is pretty much when I found out. I will say that we had a great rela­tion­ship, me and the girls; I’ve never had an argument with Amelle in my life. I was really shocked by the things that they were saying because I’d always been there for them, and they were there for me as well… But, you move on, and you learn, and I learned valuable life lessons during that period. What were the lessons?
Keisha: I’ll keep those lessons to myself. I feel like everything has gone full circle and right now I’m exactly where I’m meant to be. And I genuinely wish them the best of luck. I know people are always going to say, “oh, you’ve got to say that” but to be honest with you I was very hurt and dis­ap­poin­ted and I did feel betrayed by the whole thing. But I feel like when you don’t forgive people and when you’re very bitter it’s not really doing anything for you. But I’m in a great place, and that’s all I care about. Onwards and upwards. How good’s this album going to be then?
Mutya: Amazing.
Keisha: Shit hot, babe.
Siobhan: I think it’s everything that people want it to be, with some surprises. People expect us to come with something fresh. And we will. We won’t dis­ap­point. And that's where the interview ended. As you can imagine we had loads more that we wanted to ask — we only got half way through all the questions we'd prepared — but we suppose all those questions will be asked in due course. Hurrah!

35,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/articles/the-greatest-singles-of-2007/,"Singles. Like albums but shorter. Still popular, contrary to the claims of certain people, and released with alarming reg­u­lar­ity. Most of the singles released in 2007 were rubbish. Here are 100 which were not, starting with the most least rubbish. 1
WITH EVERY HEARTBEAT
ROBYN feat KLEERUP
Chart Peak: Number One Should it have done better:No  What happened next: Robyn donned history's most baffling eyebrows for the video to follow-up single 'Handle Me' before realising women with alarm­ingly hairy faces and continued Top Ten success do not go hand in hand. Kleerup's debut album is due in 2008 and Robyn releases bal­lade­sque blub­ba­thon 'Be Mine!' in a few weeks. 2
CALL THE SHOTS
GIRLS ALOUD
Chart Peak: Number Two Should it have done better:Yes  What happened next: The band ('the band') performed an appalling acoustic version for Jo Whiley, then decided that their next single should be an almost-ballad about speaking French and funky music doing the talking. 3
UMBRELLA
RIHANNA
Chart Peak: Number One Should it have done better:Yes  What happened next: Nobody could use the word 'umbrella' in casual con­ver­sa­tion without someone making a 'hilarious' Rihanna reference — the measure of a true pop hit. (See also 'Hot In Herre' etc etc etc.) 4
ABOUT YOU NOW
SUGABABES
Chart Peak: Number One Should it have done better:No  What happened next: Instead of splitting up they stuck leaves all over their faces and released a ballad for Christmas which was not Number One because people were still buying 'About You Now'. They should have just done an 'About Yule Now' with sleigh­bells on it, with hindsight. 5
SONG 4 MUTYA
MUTYA & GROOVE ARMADA
Chart Peak: Number 10 Should it have done better: Yes but in light of the terrible video probably not.  What they did next: Groove Armada decided to release another greatest hits album while Mutya, who managed to make it through 'Song 4 Mutya''s pro­mo­tional work without revealing that she probably didn't like it very much, went back to releasing slow-jams to wide­spread dis­in­terest. 6
BEAUTIFUL LIAR (FREEMASONS MIX)
BEYONCE & SHAKIRA
Chart Peak: Number One. Should it have done better:No.  What she did next: Beyonce and Shakira both got in with their respect­ive lives, Beyonce asked the Freemasons to work on her next album, and the Freemasons released proper-hit-single 'Uninvited' while also co-inventing the best song on the Kylie album. 7
BLEEDING LOVE
LEONA LEWIS
Chart Peak: Number One. Should it have done better: No  What she did next: Whatever Madonna would have done next. 8
TODAY THE SUN'S ON US
SOPHIE ELLIS-BEXTOR
Chart Peak: Number 64 Should it have done better: Yes  What she did next: Went on tour with Take That and decided to release a Greatest Hits album then decided not to release a Greatest Hits album quite yet because recording an amazing song with The Freemasons needed to be done first. You sometimes have to question the sanity of a country which chooses not to put a song this brilliant somewhere inside the Top 10. 9
TAKE IT LIKE A MAN
DRAGONETTE
Chart Peak: Number 150 (ish) Should it have done better: Yes  What they did next: Fucked off to Canada where shops were stocking and people were buying their amazing album before popping back to the UK for a handful of Christmas shows. It would be nice to think that 2008 will be their year. 10

38,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/articles/the-top-45-singles-of-2011/74603/," These singles were all out to buy in the UK in 2011. And they are all amazing. That is why they are on the list.  A song that would have been slightly higher if Alexandra so-called 'Stan' IF THAT IS HER REAL NAME had bothered to do a Christmas version about Turkey stuffing called 'Mr Paxobeat'. But she did not, so 'Mr Saxobeat' nestles at Number 45.  This (like Icona Pop's entry a little further down the list) is a song that was one of the lead tracks on an EP, so while it wasn't exactly a single 'per se' we thought it needed to be on the list somewhere. It's an example of Xenomania at their elegant, soph­ist­ic­ated and unhurried best, and provides this list with a good balance to the pro­duc­tion team's other entry a little further down the list. Or up the list. It's a bit confusing doing it in reverse order isn't it.  That Cut Copy album kind of came and went, didn't it?  A great showcase of the smart elec­tronic pop direction the band also put to good use on their Diana Vickers col­lab­or­a­tion 'Music To Make The Boys Cry'. This appeared from nowhere a few weeks ago — maybe there is an album on its way too. That would be good.  Included in this list for — among other things — the elaborate ridicu­wobble moment, but there's plenty more to like about this. Perhaps Calvin could get on with recording a full album for some time in 2012. JUST AN IDEA.  This song is really exciting and brilliant, so it was a shame that it was slightly over­shad­owed by a video so awful that urgent high level dis­cus­sions were held in which all major record labels and a number of sig­ni­fic­ant indies all briefly con­sidered an eight year morator­ium on music videos as a permitted marketing tool.  One of the things we like most about 'What The Hell' is the idea that Avril probably bloody hates it.  The only bad thing about this is that a Tom Jones feat Jessie J 'duet' seems likely to strike at some point in 2012. TO THE SECRET BUNKER, READERS — THIS IS NOT A DRILL.  This wasn't really promoted properly in the UK but — as a quick listen will show you — it is really rather good.  This was a new single but not 'the' new single. It was just a song that appeared one day. We liked it a lot. Then we didn't listen to it very much for a couple of weeks because we thought we had gone off it. And then we DID listen to it again and we thought, 'this is actually good'. And we were right. A true story ladies and gentlemen.  The muted reaction to this post­mod­ern­ist pop mas­ter­piece reminded us a bit of when The Bigwigs gave Rachel Stevens the best album of 2005 and the public went 'no thanks', which was a shame because it was of course splendid. As is 'Love You Like A Love Song'. The video is 'quite something', too…
[youtube]EgT_us6AsDg[/youtube]
  'Finish Line' would have been Top 10 in this list if it didn't have all that ""finish line"" business going on in the chorus. A harsh decision, readers, but a fair one.  One of about a million amazing songs on The Sound Of Arrows' debut album.  We like the bit where it goes BANG WHEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!  A song in which you think you've heard the chorus, only for the proper chorus to explode. We like that sort of song. (The album's out in the UK in the 'first quarter' of 2012. We give it the thumbs up, if you are inter­ested.)  This felt a bit like Emeli had sat down with a mixtape of all the last twelve months' worst, most deriv­at­ive will-this-do Pitbull-infused chart shit, and decided to do the opposite. 'Heaven' still feels a bit like opening the window in a stuffy room, and the instru­mental version of the track (available on iTunes) is quite a thing of beauty.  This was given away free but it was also pur­chas­able if you were either really stupid or really honest, so it is allowed on the list. (But the main reason it's allowed on the list is that it is extremely good.)  Alexis Jordan: she's a good girl, but she's been bad before. How bad do you think she's really been? 'Rosemary West' bad? Do you think she'd put empty After Eight wrappers back in the box? Do you think she'd shout at a baby? Would she fist a goat? These are questions we needed answering at the start of the year, and as December draws to a close it looks like there's fuck all chance of them being addressed, by Alexis or any of her rep­res­ent­at­ives.  David Guetta is a bit like a nuclear reactor. When he's doing what you want it's all very good. When it all goes wrong, you want to be as far away as possible. 'Without You' is an example of Guetta doing what we want. Well done, David Guetta! And well done Usher for being there too.  There were a lot of apo­ca­lypse-themed songs this year but this was one of the few that didn't make you want the world to actually end.  That's what you get when you open up a shop that only sells pillows and brass instru­ments.  One Direction's album suffered from too many half-finished songs and an overly-aggress­ive desire to cross off every point on a hypo­thet­ical 13-year-old's secret 'Things I Wish Harry Styles Would Say To Me' list, but they got it very right on 'What Makes You Beautiful'.  This is how you do a ballad.  Do you know what, we're looking at this list and wondering whether this shouldn't have been in the Top 5. Oh well, it's too late now, and perhaps the song nestling here, midlist, is a fitting pun­ish­ment for the band releasing 'Nights Like This' as one song on an EP, rather than as a 'proper' single in its own right. Food for thought there, 'the music industry'. Food for thought. ARE YOU LISTENING?! (""We're all out of office until Jan 4"" — The Music Industry)  This was instantly one of our favourite tracks on the album but it really sprang to life with the video Let's not forget the incred­ible oppor­tun­ity this song gave on tour, too, for fans to join Britney on stage. Comedy gold.  For a song based around a pretty awful single entendre 'Hold It Against Me' packed far more of a punch, longev­ity­wise, than we at first suspected it might. During the year it slowly started to feel like a Britney classic and while we could have done without that eight-year countdown to an under­whelm­ing video the Britstep breakdown remains, of course, a complete mas­ter­piece.  Do you know what, we're looking at the calendar here and unless we're much mistaken it's about time for another three Robyn albums. Right? Right.  'Seriously guys', what is not to love about a rampaging Moombahton banger that contains the line 'Don Julio, Patron, we get it uppington up in the club­bing­ton with Kate Middleton'? Nothing. That is the answer to the question we asked, which was a rhet­or­ical question as it happens but we have provided the answer just in case any of you were in any doubt.  Marina is not actually radio­act­ive — it's a figure of speech, just one of various popular lyrical tech­niques she employed to good effect on this 'popular' 'music' 'tune'.  It makes us think a bit of 'Angel Eyes' by Abba except you can't dance to this. You can't really dance to 'Angel Eyes' either, now we come to think of it. Not that we've ever tried.  L! O! V! E! ly way to start a solo career.  This song went through various incarn­a­tions on its path to ultimate amaz­ing­ness but the final version welds fizzy pro­duc­tion, roaring melodies and a classic pop lyric. Naturally Nicole's detached vocal per­form­ance is com­pletely inten­tional, as an echo of the song's theme of desolate numbness. That is def­in­itely the reason.  It is beautiful in its way, because Gaga makes no mistakes well she does sometimes but this wasn't one of them.  We have only delib­er­ately listened to this song five times. Partly because its amaz­ing­ness is almost too hard to com­pre­hend and it makes us feel a bit funny and partly because we would like it to stay special for as long as possible.  Sometimes people will say things like ""oh I liked Nicki Minaj's mixtape stuff blah blah but 'Super Bass' is just shit"". We don't think it's quite so black and white. We think it's possible to live in a world where one enjoys the mixtapes and 'Super Bass'. That actually makes us sound quite reas­on­able — what we really mean is, like the mixtapes or don't like them, we don't care, just don't come round here 'giving it all that' about 'Super Bass' because if you do we'll become very angry indeed.  Sad momentum. That is what this song has got. A triumph.  Why are shit songs about being in the club so shit? Are they shit because they are about being in the club? No — they are shit because they are shit. And this song is not shit. Obviously in-the-club nonsense is a bit boring now, as we watch the three-year trend hurtle toward an uncertain but bound-to-be-messy climax, but when it's done bril­liantly it is, well, brilliant, and this bold return to arms-in-the-air pop ridicu­lous­ness for Xenomania provided The Saturdays with their best single of 2011. It also felt like a spring­board into 2012 for Xenomania, so that's nice.  Sax please, we're British.  This song could have gone to a number of different artists. It went to Olly Murs. We have learned to deal with it, and we feel more positive about life since having done so.  ""I wanna become what people become, but I know I'll stay here."" Tremendous. We are stupidly excited about the prospect of a full Amanda album in 2012.  When we inter­viewed Calvin earlier in the year he was in the studio. ""Today I am getting some guide vocals recorded for a song I wrote that’s for a girl,"" he said, ""and I don’t want to sing the guide vocals because it’s a par­tic­u­larly girlie song and I’m too embar­rassed to send my version with me singing to the artist in question."" Do you think it was this song? It probably was, wasn't it. Amazing. Did you know Calvin is the sole writer and producer of this song? That's not bad going is it.  The nostalgic-longing-for-a-roman­ti­cised-teenage-life thing splashed across the 'Teenage Dream' album was too heavy-handed in some parts but 'Last Friday Night (TGIF)' hit just the right spot in just the right way. The video, we hope you'll agree, is one of the year's finest. On the remix front, perhaps we've simply been worn down by Kiss FM's 300 daily plays but the Missy mix might even be on the verge of becoming our favourite version of the song. Fancy that!  Nothing in 2011 tested the concept of a benign God more than the fact that we appar­ently live in a world where 'Popular' can be entered for the Eurovision Song Contest and somehow not win. From a shaky start (rhyming 'possible' with 'possible' is not exactly a pop mas­ter­stroke) the song explodes into glory by the first chorus. It's at the halfway point that 'Popular' really flings itself into a home straight of awe­some­ness, but it still finds ways to escalate the euphoria right into the final few seconds.  ""It sounds too much like 'Bad Romance',"" they said, clearly deaf to the stupidity of their own bleatings. ""This thing you are doing with your mouth,"" they might as well be saying, ""is too much like some jolly good oral sex."" (Best bit: the ""Ju-dah-uh-uh-oh"" bits in the last thirty seconds.)  We suspected through­out 2011 that this might end up being our single of the year, and here it is. First off, it's worth stating that this is a song robust enough to stand up to a mauling from the X Factor Finalists, and the last song to emerge unscathed from such an assault was — tada!!!!!! — last year's Popjustice Single Of The Year. 'Hello' has it all — sim­pli­city, drama, tennis — and any song that makes Madonna sit up and go 'oh actually do you know what I'll have a bit of that Solveig action to wrench me out of the dumper' has to have more than a little bit of amaz­ing­ness about it. To these ears 'Hello' does actually boast something of a 'Hung Up' feel — a sharp, irres­ist­ible energy that somehow feels even more fresh and exciting with each listen. Actually, imagine if this was Madonna's comeback single. And now stop imagining that, because it's perfect with Dragonette.  While we operate a strict 45-and-that's-your-lot policy when it comes to our end of year singles list, there are loads of songs we think deserve a bit of recog­ni­tion. If you're compiling a playlist of the year's best tunes, you'll want to make sure this lot are in there somewhere.

39,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/articles/the-top-45-singles-of-2014/," Guess what: 2014's been a really, really brilliant year for singles. There's been audacity, stupidity, excite­ment, drama, booming and clapping. There have been surprise hits and pre­dict­able bangers. There have been songs about crying, dancing, light fittings, having a big arse, riverb­anks, getting off your tits and — finally — funk of the uptown variety. It's all been rather splendid. Don't believe us? Just watch… ""I like us better when we're wasted, It makes it easier to fake it. The only time we really talk is when our clothes are coming off."" Poetry. Poetry is what that is. Some radio stations played a version in which 'wasted' was 'naked'. That worked too. Tiaan released a number of songs in 2014 and this was the best by some distance. Don't be fooled by the modest pro­duc­tion — this tune is a total beast. A song that felt instantly familiar; a song so expertly crafted that it felt like we'd known it for years. As it turned out, we had — Rob Thomas released it in 2005 — but 'Me & My Broken Heart' was still an extremely banging debut single. Imagine if Cheryl had whacked out something like this — instead of the trumpety mess that was 'Crazy Stupid Love' — as her 2014 comeback single. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPo7iNKoCGQ It was a bit ""get The Blogs on red alert, there's a Quality Artist coming through"", but 'Don't Wait' is as dis­tinct­ive and as beautiful at the end of 2014 as it was nearer the start. We woke up on December 16 2013 wondering 'how the hell did this shit happen'; 'Pretty Hurts' seemed like an early choice for best song on the album but 'Drunk In Love' was a popgeist-defining jam for the duration of 2014, so here it is in the Top 45 list. Basically, it's 'Hideaway' PLUS a massive hands-in-the-air pop bit. (If you are going to click play on the video above, please face away from your screen while the song is playing because this has to be one of the very worst videos of the entire year.) We've said it before, we'll say it again many times before the Grim Reaper finally comes for us, we're about to say it right now: if this had a proper chorus rather than just an amazing pre-chorus, the song would be unstop­pable. As it is, it stops at Number 38. Which seems rel­at­ively low for a song as excellent as this, but what you need to remember here ladies and gents is that the standard has been extremely high this year. We didn't even realise how high the standard had been until we started knocking this list together. Would have been in our Top 10 without the annoying whispery bit. It felt like a world-demol­ish­ing superstar had arrived when this appeared in July. Tkay released some other bits this year, none of which were anywhere near as good as 'U-Huh', so she needs to get her act together in 2015 because there's something poten­tially brilliant happening here. This would have been about twelve places higher had the song not been ruined forever by the double whammy of a laughably basic follow-up single and a dis­astrous per­form­ance on the X Factor final. Still, Meghan was one of the writers on Fifth Harmony's mighty 'Sledgehammer', so she may still prove useful. ('Sledgehammer' is not eligible for this list as it was not released as a proper UK single. Do not get us started on that one.) ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it."" That's something people say a lot when it comes to pop. Actually, a more pertinent phrase is this: ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it imme­di­ately, but def­in­itely do consider fixing it or at least taking it in for a service before the wheels all fall off and everyone dies."" We think Calvin Harris' pop vehicle would probably fail its MOT at this stage but it still goes like the clappers when he's got his foot down and [ATTENTION PLEASE: THIS ENTRY HAS BEEN CLOSED BY THE METAPHOR POLICE, PLEASE STEP AWAY FROM THE CRIME SCENE] This is just brilliant from beginning to end. If you have sensitive eyes please do not watch the opening sequence of this video because you can clearly, quite delib­er­ately see the outline of one of their dicks and that's just not on. Quite enough has been written about this song during 2014 and almost every word we've read has somehow managed to drain a little bit of excite­ment and magic from this extraordin­ary tune, so we'll just say this: imagine Swifto on vocals. Strange, isn't it, how something that seems so unevent­ful can in fact be so amazing. ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912201707.53/warc/CC-MAIN-20190318211849-20190318233849-00359.warc.gz
40,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/articles/the-top-45-singles-of-2014/2/,"This is another one that falls into the 'fucking hell Cheryl how about recording something inter­est­ing' category. We're not sure how this woman isn't a proper inter­na­tional pop obsession but maybe it'll all happen for her in 2015. Listening to this now for the first time in a couple of months it seems obvious that we should have put 'Into The Blue' quite a few places higher on this list, but we've done all the format­ting now so here it will have to stay. It's funny how Lady Gaga will say things along the lines of ""people want another 'Bad Romance' but that doesn't interest me because I'm such a free-minded creative spirit"" when, actually, 'GUY' isn't far off being exactly that. If the pro­duc­tion wasn't so wonky this would be in the Top 3; the ""I don't need to be on top…"" portion is Gaga at her very best. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTWCdX139LU We liked this one a lot. This one actually came out in the rest of the world last year but it wasn't released in the UK until 2014. Obviously it was com­pletely ignored by radio and the world at large, despite being totally incen­di­ary. While we're talking about release date fiascos, can we just say that Tove Lo's 'Habits' isn't on this year's singles Top 45 because it was actually in last year's. Sorry about that, but what can you do. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is how you do a chorus. In the video for this, Years & Years go for a walk in the woods. Next thing you know there's a swamp girl wafting around. Madness. We think this is probably supposed to be quite sensual but when you think about it, chances are that if this girl lives in the woods she probably stinks to high heaven, which is a shame. A classic boyband ballad. A classic boyband ballad. Like the Years & Years video, the clip accom­pa­ny­ing this tumul­tu­ous Tedderbanger is partially set in the woods. Mind you, it's also partially set near a venetian blind. One in the eye for those who say pop is afraid to take chances. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHFevxf3IKA A couple of the songs on this year's Top 45 list sound slightly ahead of their time, but 'Satisfy' is the only one that sounds like it's somehow appeared a full ten years ahead of scheduled release. A song of two halves, like in football, but with a song. The point at 2:01, when 'One More' suddenly changes from slinky downbeat thimble to scary electro bucket, is one of 2014's best pop moments. There are times in pop when an artist says, ""do you know what, I'm several hundred grand in the hole, I'm probably going to get dropped, I'm going to get Charli XCX on the phone and make a song and video so irres­ist­ibly brilliant that everyone will have to sit the fuck down and accept that I'm here to stay, for at least the next eight months"". But enough about Icona Pop's 'I Love It', let's turn our attention instead of 'Fancy', which contains one of the year's three best (if least con­vin­cing) opening lines. ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912203548.81/warc/CC-MAIN-20190325031213-20190325053213-00532.warc.gz
41,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/articles/the-top-45-singles-of-2014/3/,"Naturally this sticks out like a sore thumb on '1989' but it is, and will always be, a fantastic ridicu­banger. This got to Number 34 in the UK. Are you happy, 'the UK'? Are you pleased with yourselves? Sleep well at night, do you? Go about your business with a clear con­science? Look yourselves in the mirror without recoiling at the moral inad­equacy that pours from your dark, dead eyes? You make us sick. By this point in the list we're firmly into 'everything could at one point have been con­sidered Single Of The Year' territory. But it's bad news for Lorde, and it's bad news for Indiana, as you will see below. This one — which changes gear halfway through and really becomes something of a thunderer near the end — would make a pretty good companion to the Elliphant track. But the 'songs that kick off just when you're in danger of losing interest' entries don't end here. Keep reading! Oh please, for the love of God, keep reading. Consider this an entry for 'Blank Space', but also consider this a blank space where 'Style' should have been. (Except if she'd released 'Style' it would have been about 11 places higher on the list.) We've put this as 'Robyn feat Royksopp'. In factual terms it's Royksopp feat Robyn, but who are they trying to kid. A mini mas­ter­piece. So basically if you play this, then the Indiana single, then the Elliphant single, you'll have just listened to the three best change-gear-in-an-exciting-way songs of 2014. Strange isn't it that Katy B turned in a sparkly elec­tro­pop song? Still, we've learned by now that you don't question these gifts when they come your way. Nearly every song in our Top 10 of the year sounds like someone, or many people, have gone hell for leather trying to make something amazing. This Top 10 rep­res­ents tears, tantrums and burst blood­ves­sels. The only exception is this song, which sounds like it was as much fun to record as it is to listen to. Again, no fucker bought it, due to general incom­pet­ence on the part of the world at large. And by the world at large we spe­cific­ally mean Radio 1. Girlband single of the year. This didn't need to be amazing. Most YouTubers could shit in a yellow bucket and go Top 10 on iTunes. But Troye Sivan hit the target on an epic scale with 'Happy Little Pill'. Rita Ora is one of those popstars who is precisely as good as the song they're singing. For three minutes and twenty one seconds in March, Rita Ora was the best popstar in the world. One of the best singles of the year from one of the best albums of the year. Once again, this song's existence didn't seem to make much of an impres­sion on the general public. But how could it, if they didn't know it existed? Another slow clap, please, for Radio 1. In some respects 2014 really sucked the big one. The word ""boom"" three times, each one accom­pan­ied by a drum beat. The word ""clap"", accom­pan­ied by a clap. Has any other song this year promised so much in its first three seconds, then somehow managed to fulfil every wild expect­a­tion? (Shit video though — oh well.) If you have come here from a leading social network you'll probably have noticed that we used the 'Uptown Funk' artwork as the image that accom­pan­ied the link. You might also have noticed that through­out this article we've dropped a few hints that 'Uptown Funk' would be the single of the year: the ""don't believe us just watch"" in the intro, the little pointing Bruno Mars cutouts that help you navigate the pages, the larger-than-the-rest 'Uptown Funk' artwork in the image at the top of the first page. Everything was pointing to 'Uptown Funk' being the single of the year. Why did we do this? Well, firstly, it seems somehow appro­pri­ate that 'Uptown Funk' should appear sooner than expected. But more import­antly, the song we've actually chosen as single of the year is so obvious that we had to try and find a way to make its appear­ance a surprise. This countdown needed drama! It needed suspense! It needed excite­ment! Three elements 'Uptown Funk' has in some abundance. But not in as much abundance as… Just under a year ago we named Sia our Pop Entity Of 2013. We couldn't say at the time, but we'd already heard 'Chandelier'. Just the once, but once was enough to know that, whatever else 2014 threw our way, 'Chandelier' would end the year as one of the Top 3 singles. 'Chandelier' is a sonically epic, melod­ic­ally daring and lyrically inventive (if unin­tel­li­gible) single that exists on its own terms and sounds com­pletely unique. There are plenty of pop song­writers in the world, making plenty of great songs, but nobody under­stands the form quite like Sia and none of them, in 2014, has been able to convert their talent into an artist project with this instinct­ive, perverse charm. Single of the year, and then some.  (Taylor Swift isn't in it, obviously. And neither is Rashelle.) There were LOADS of other songs we wanted to include in our list. Looking at them now, we're already having second thoughts about how the Top 45 panned out. But it's too late now, we're not dicking around with it any more.

42,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/articles/the-top-45-singles-of-2015/," This is it. THE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT AND 100% DEFINITIVE LIST OF 2015'S 45 BEST SINGLES. 2015, eh? Twelve months. 52 weeks. We lost count of how many days but it was loads of them. And through­out that period there was music. Most of that music was abso­lutely terrible but some of that music was alright, some was really good and some was GREAT. We've compiled the year's Top 45 singles in the list below. It's a right old white-knuckle ride so hold on tight. (There's a Spotify playlist too, if you like that kind of thing.) Eric Prydz has always had the whole dance-music-that-sounds-like-pop-music thing down pretty well. We would have put 'Opus' on the list instead but it doesn't have any words in it and everyone knows you need to have words in a song to make it proper. SORRY CLASSICAL MUSIC, YOU LOSE AGAIN. Ellie would have been in the Top 10 of this list if she'd released 'Lost & Found' as a single. This came and went with little attention, which was just not on. 2015 was a fairly miserable year for UK dance music, as the arse-end of the deep house scene shat out a suc­ces­sion of pathetic covers and pointless remixes while everyone else put their money on Liltpop, the uncon­vin­cingly tropical sound that looks to dominate 2016. Anyway, XYconstant and Tom Aspaul did it well, so well done to them. In an ideal world Chvrches would have recorded half the Carly Rae Jepsen album and Carly would have recorded half the Chvrches album, but nothing in life is ideal. He had the shits on the floor. There's some great ""OH!"" action in this song. Also notable for the line ""she's capable of anything, it's riveting"". Who uses the word 'riveting' in a pop song? Incredible scenes. Rihanna was offered this song but passed on it. Yet another reason to be furious with Robyn 'Rihanna' So-Called Fenty in 2015. This is basically a song about looking nice in a dress then looking nice not in a dress. It's a song about sexual inter­course. Here at Popjustice we generally take a dim view on this sort of filth but it's alright when there's a nice tune. There's a strong sense of 'late-career Girls Aloud album track' in this song, which is to say it's close to per­fec­tion. This was first out in 2014 as part of an EP, then it came out again in 2015. A song for all (open) seasons, twice. Maybe it will come out in 2016 too, and everyone will go ""oh I didn't listen to Josef Salvat in 2014 or 2015 because I was busy listening to other things, but now I've heard 'Open Season' I can finally recognise that it is a very special song and I now realise that I was a fool to ignore it"". Maybe that will happen. (Maybe it won't.) NEXT UP: NUMBERS 30 TO 16  ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912201707.53/warc/CC-MAIN-20190318211849-20190318233849-00390.warc.gz
43,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/articles/the-top-45-singles-of-2015/2/," PREVIOUSLY: NUMBERS 45 TO 31 Do you think, if we ask nicely, Katy and Tinie could release a song together every year? Ideally it would work a bit like the Pitbull and J.Lo scenario overseas: one song each summer, POSSIBLE 'Lambada' samples, the full works. Or how about this: a nice little EP together. Look we're willing to be flexible on the rules of this. Tell you what let's all get together and brain­storm some ideas. We'll bring the flipchart, you lot bring the pens. Can someone book a meeting room for January 8? CHEERS! 'No offence right' but as with most Nero songs this is better if you close your eyes and imagine a world where a former member of The Saturdays went down this route. There have been some truly terrible 'email a track out to some topline writers and hope for the best' moments during 2015 but Becky Hill's work on this Watermät tune really does the job: romance, drama and a massive chorus. Naturally it wasn't a hit, because people are wrong. Managing to be a self-help anthem without being trite and generally shit, 'Don't Be So Hard On Yourself' was just one of the straight run of 48 UK Number Ones Jess Glynne enjoyed in 2015, until she released a boring ballad at the end of the year and ruined everything. There's a lesson to be learned here. Susanne's whole album is something rather special. Well done Susanne, you made a good album. ""I can't even speak, no — la la la la la la la la."" What a lyric. You know those people who go ""really really really really really really isn't a good lyric, it's just lazy""? You probably saw those people on Twitter. Well, those people are wankers. At the end of last year, while drunk, we chose Troye as our Pop Entity Of 2014 and for a few months of 2015 we wondered if we'd made the right choice. Turns out we had. Well done us. Well done Troye a little bit, but mainly well done us. Rihanna has been so infuri­at­ing this year that we briefly toyed with dis­qual­i­fy­ing her from this chart but let's not forget that the annual Popjustice Singles Of The Year countdown should be treated as an important his­tor­ical record of amaz­ing­ness and as such should not be affected by FURY AND SADNESS, so here's 'American Oxygen'. If we accept, as we probably should, that the days of 'We Found Love'-style Rihanna mega­bangers are behind us, and if we also accept that that's fine because Rihanna should be able to move forward with her career without someone hollering ""WHERE'S THE EURODANCE"" across Twitter every five minutes, a track like 'American Oxygen' is probably the best possible outcome. This one sounded par­tic­u­larly good on the radio. NEXT UP: NUMBERS 15 TO 1  ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912203548.81/warc/CC-MAIN-20190325031213-20190325053213-00083.warc.gz
44,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/articles/the-top-45-singles-of-2016/2/," PREVIOUSLY: NUMBERS 45 TO 31 Strictly speaking this isn't a 2016 single but it basically is a 2016 single. Let's not have an argument about it, there'll be enough shouting and crying on Christmas Day. Sometimes we think, 'imagine if Katy Perry released a song like this, that would be nice'. And then other times we think, 'that just wouldn't work because Katy Perry has a different sort of profile'. ""We loved the pop hits, and quoted the best bits."" 1 Sia really changed things up with this song about over­com­ing adversity. Obviously there are times when you need Sia to wheel out her metaphor machine and tell you how powerful and unstop­pable you are, but just-about-getting-through-life-thanks-for-asking is one of the best pop genres. Another of the best pop genres is yeah-being-a-popstar-is-quite-hard-work-sometimes — it's tricky to get right, and it's hard for popstars not to sound like dicks then they do it, but 'Elizabeth Taylor' sits alongside Mike Posner's 'I Took A Pill In Ibiza' (which very narrowly missed out on a place in this list) as an example of how to get it right. The line ""I feel like Elizabeth Taylor at the after party, in a room full of strangers, just me and my Bacardi"" is almost 'Super Trouper'-worthy. Fucking hell that AlunaGeorge album wasn't up to much, was it? Anyway this single was good. Meghan Trainor almost made this list with late-90s-influ­enced comeback single 'No', but sadly any/all goodwill towards Meghan evap­or­ated following the events of the tragic M-Train derail­ment of September 2016. Fortunately 'Hardcore Heartbreak', the latest in a suc­ces­sion of pop triumphs by Swedish pop triumph expert Cilia, fills the late-90s-influence gap rather nicely. Clear bal­lad­banger status aside, one of the things we like about this song is how you could easily apply the lyrics to the creative struggle all big pop acts feel when approach­ing new endeav­ours in the modern age: they're critiqued and bashed from every angle, across every social network, from different types of fans demanding different types of direction; under­stand­ably they often doubt their own abilities to keep everyone happy, but they also know that all they really need is one moment of clarity in order for the whole thing to make sense. This wasn't the Rihanna single we wanted, but it turned out to be the Rihanna single we needed. When this came out we got quite excited about it and we were right to do so. Apparently it started off as a ballad, briefly became a donked-up mega­banger, and even­tu­ally settled somewhere in the middle. Fancy that! We still think Zara Larsson could be one of the best popstars of the next five years, and there are at least two legit­im­ately brilliant songs due for release in 2017, but her 2016 single choices felt dis­ap­point­ing after 'Lush Life'. One Larsson got it right, though — Zara's sister Hanna teamed up with her mate Andrea and turned in this incred­ible reima­gin­ing of Rihanna's 'Diamonds'. Do you know what we've done? We'll tell you what we've done. Basically we've made a Spotify playlist which is Rihanna's 'Rated R', and we've just chucked 'Kiss It Better' in the middle. It fits right in there. And if a song can fit in on Rihanna's best ever album, that means it's Officially Good. People don't half make pop creation sound com­plic­ated. The funny thing is, sometimes all you need to chuck some beautiful lyrics at a top tune. Eight times better than the Stone Roses (ask your clapped out raver uncle) song of the same name, amipyrite? Three amazing things about this song: 1. ""You've been down before, you've been hurt before, you got up before."" That's what it's all about, isn't it?
2. Waiting until the second chorus before ""what you waiting for"" turns into ""what you wai, what you wai, what you waiting FOR-OR"".
3. Well obviously if you're namecheck­ing Destiny's Child you're onto a winner. Another not-strictly-2016 song, but as the saying goes, ""a man bound by rules is a man doomed to cry while compiling his end-of-year singles list"". Written by Justin Tranter and Julia Michaels, like various good songs.

45,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/articles/the-top-45-singles-of-2018/,"What an amazing year for pop music! We say that every year, right? It's almost as if pop music is always amazing. Month in, month out, year after year. A solid, endless cavalcade of amaz­ing­ness. This year's Top 45 is all over the place, in a quite brilliant way. There are guitars, there are synths. There are happy songs and there are sad songs. There are smashes and flops, bangers and bops. Some songs have over half a billion Spotify streams, one has just 89,000.  First off, and clicking the green button below will obviously lead to spoilers for anyone who revels in the arti­fi­cially engin­eered suspense of a countdown from 45 to one, there's a playlist. The playlist works like this: Now 'without furtho ado', here's the countdown. What a way to start the countdown! There's a bit in the Popjustice about page about how you shouldn't ever have to apologise for liking the pop you like but, well… Look. This song is object­ively terrible in many ways. You are going to abso­lutely hit the roof when you realise which songs haven't made the list. But Be Alright is also amazing. And the Number 45 slot was going to be this or Pitbull's version of Toto's Africa, so let's just accept the majesty of Dean Lewis and his autumnal bop, and move on. In one sense it feels as if it's perhaps time for the crazy Noah Cyrus exper­i­ment to be knocked on the head. In another sense, she has as many monthly Spotify listeners as The 1975, so carry on? IN ANY CASE the Max Martin-'helmed' We Are…, which after a slew of teaser tracks felt like Noah's first full-on attempt to have a hit record, was a super-smart song about self-loathing, celebrity, social media, the envir­on­ment and con­sumer­ism. (If you think parts sound a bit like Lorde it's probably because an uncred­ited co-writer on this song is… Lorde.) You spend most of Heart To Break expecting the song, at any moment, to burst into Michael Jackson's Thriller. It's still hard to figure out how (or if) to cover The Recorded Output Of Kim Petras, but Popjustice's year end singles should kind of reflect the year's best singles, and Kim made one of them, so here we are.  A luxurious sexballad in which Olly Alexander discusses the ins and outs — quite literally!! — of straight men entering into Relations with gay popstars. Pop is all about context and it's impossible to com­pre­hend the true power of this Danny L Harle-produced thumper until you've exper­i­enced it in the context of 25 six-year-olds smashing the living shit out of a unicorn piñata at a south London soft play centre. The ideal sub­tle­banger to kick off Zara's new era. Zara had some inter­est­ing and thought­ful things to say about the song when Popjustice inter­viewed her earlier this year. The song comes in at an efficient three minutes and ten seconds. ""I date a lot of women who are into it,"" Hayley told Billboard this year, ""but they’re uncom­fort­able with society’s pressures. They’re uncom­fort­able with liking girls even though they do."" A strong and nimble companion piece to Years & Years' Sanctify. For the last few years it's seemed like Charli's plan has been to gradually bring together the two extremes of her output — the PC Music, mixtapey side, and the side that propelled her into the charts. And it felt like when she did so, the XCX Singularity would be achieved. Is that what 1999 is? No idea. Takes a while to get going but that chorus could blast a hole in the side of a mountain. Céline's appear­ance on the Deadpool 2 soundtrack wasn't without a sense of irony but between Ashes, the Black Panther soundtrack and Dua Lipa's Swan Song it feels like we're entering a new golden age of amazing songs off Hollywood block­busters.  Still 2018's most congable song. This time last year George's big comeback seemed dead in the water; all it took was to pretend Don't Matter Now — a Top 66 non-smash — hadn't happened, and to wait until 2018 to unveil this corker. This is not a time to rest on laurels, however: only time will tell how post-Brexit freedom of travel within the EU will impact the writing of George's next album.  Strong Goldilocks & The Three BPMs vibes with this song's rollout: the first version was too slow, the third was too slow slow but this, the second, was just fast slow enough.  An impress­ive lineup of talent on this song: along with Metroplane's Alex Metric and Aeroplane you've also got Bree Runway (will 2019 be her year? Yes it will) and writing and pro­duc­tion credits from Becky Hill, MNEK, Ryan Ashley and Mark Ralph. A big moment from Record, one of the year's best albums, and a reminder that you never grow out of getting pissed up and dancing to epic bangers. Dancefloor ref­er­ences various other songs — Good Times, Shame, Golden Years and Let The Music Play — all of which are on the great Inspirations playlist Tracey put together as a companion piece for her album.  We've included the Palms Trax remix on the playlist because why not. The proper version's opening ""CHRIS"" remains one of 2018's best pop moments. Properly kicks off at precisely the halfway point, which does support the theory that Tongue could be expanded into a two-act play, a bit like they did with Barry Manilow's Copacabana, except with more kissing. The ""run don't walk away"" bit is 11/10. There seems to be some res­ist­ance to Ava Max, doesn't there? DO NOT FEAR THE MAX. You don't have to move in with her, enjoying the music is fine.  One of several Twenty Quid Music Prize short­l­is­ted songs on this year's countdown, Falling Into Me is the longest song on this year's Top 45 but, in its defence, it does contain an entire album's worth of sonic, melodic and lyrical ideas.  She came, she saw, she managed to cobble nine songs together and finally finished fiddling about with that one from the Girls finale. Hard to know at this point in pop history whether points should be added or knocked off for the cowbell, really.  In which one of Sweden's sharpest pop talents col­lab­or­ates with a producer whose name conjures the image of a man named and shamed in the local newspaper for a regret­table incident at the town's second-largest garden centre. One of the best post-choruses all year, but how about this for an opening verse: Hello, sweet griefI know you'll be the death of meFeel like the morning after ecstasyI am drowning in an endless seaHello, old friendHere's the misery that knows no endSo I'm doing everything I canTo make sure I never love again BLOODY HELL. Here's a nice interview Popjustice did with Sophia just before the song came out.  Young love, missed oppor­tun­it­ies, regret, and a shout of ""C'MON!"". Totally Bandit.  As an audi­ovisual exper­i­ence This Is America exists in its own space and sort of stands apart from how you'd usually judge a pop single, a point hammered home here by the ridicu­lous­ness of the year's most important single being sand­wiched between Clean Bandit and 5 Seconds Of Summer.  5SOS returned at the start of the year with Want You Back — a not-great attempt to repos­i­tion the band's sound somewhere between Maroon 5 and the planet's dominant Spotpop sound. It didn't do very well. The band's fortunes were revived with Youngblood, which hit both its predecessor's targets while also sounding like 5SOS. (It was also 10x better, which is reflected in the song getting ten times as many streams.) Would have secured a place on the shortlist for the sleeve alone. Also: ""Laying that pipe down, neigh­bours saying 'pipe down'"". If All About That Bass taught us anything it's that as pop consumers, one of the most important skills we can develop is the ability to reflex­ively skip, bin, delete or ignore any songs con­tain­ing reported advice from parents. Fortunately this melo­dra­matic party piece slipped through the net in 2018. (If you're in the mood for a frankly awful but slightly amazing arms-aloft remix, try this.) Hard to say exactly when the global arts journ­al­ism community decided to weaponise the idea of 'Song Of The Summer' but this was 2018's, right? It took ages to realise this, but the magic of this song lies in the fact that it sounds like a ramped-up reima­gin­ing of about three different songs by The Sound Of Arrows. Poor uncred­ited Conor Maynard. :( A song so inex­plic­ably slept on that there have been times this year when the song's entire existence felt like a strange dream, or a pop version of the film Shazaam. Please get in touch if you too remember the time Naughty Boy, RAY BLK and Wyclef Jean abso­lutely smashed it.  17th best song of 2018! 17th best song of 2018! 17th best song of 2018!  You probably saw it at the time but the New York Times did a great song diary on how this song came about. In a nutshell: 8000 different singers attempted to nail it, the whole thing took fucking ages, Zedd didn't do as much as you might think. The unlikely upshot is that one of 2018's best choruses is little more than Maren Morris bellowing over a clock. More timepiece­core in 2019, please. Nathan Sykes' darkest hour. Amazing how the ability to reclaim nar­rat­ives is now literally part of the Ariana narrative. What if in 2019 she decides not to, and people object? How can she respond? What a pre­dic­a­ment! Video of the year. Four Grammy nom­in­a­tions feels about right.  Anne-Marie and Marshmello had one of the year's biggest spelling-based hits, but are banned from this list due to the bit in Friends where Anne-Marie claims the title is spelt ""F-R-I-N-D-S"". Tragic scenes. Anyway ""B! (That's a fucking body) O! (That's a fucking body) D! (And I really wanna get to know you) Y!"" is incred­ible, as is the rest of this song and as, for that matter, is the whole Glowie 'thing'. The best bit is when Dua's pitched down in the chorus and it sounds like she's duetting WITH HERSELF, thus turning Electricity into a song about self love.  Glowie's Body taught us the joy of letters, but what about numbers? Dua Lipa claimed 2017's counting crown and in 2018 the honour falls to Matty off The 1975.  A good lyric: I swear that I only called her one timeMaybe it was two times?I don't think it was three timesIt can't be more than four timesI think we need to rewindYou text that boy sometimesMust be more than three timesI didn't mean to two-time you We have counting, we have rela­tion­ship woes, we have some two times/two-timing wordplay. We have the whole lot.  Swedish pop person Lilly started the year with low-key slinker Bad Boys but hit total pop gold with this tri­umphant pensive mas­ter­piece. If you wish to glimpse the awfulness of the British public and don't feel like turning on the news or looking out of your window, look no further than the fact that on Eurovision night their votes didn't give this dramatic banger a single point.  Even though I'm satisfiedI lead my life within a lie Good Broadly chat here. As Wikipedia so elo­quently puts it: ""It is composed in the key of A minor using 4/4 time and a tempo of 122 beats per minute. The refrain is based on an Am–G–F–Am–G–F–C–Dm–Am–C chord pro­gres­sion, while the verses follow an A(add2)–F(add2)–G(add2) sequence. Grande's vocal range spans from G3 to G5. [20]"" Wise words.  The best song on ZAYN's Icarus Falls album? Hard to say — we started playing it last week and there are still three days' worth of songs to go.  ""(Selling petrol)."" Is there a better two-word pop moment anywhere else in this list? NO THERE IS NOT. Powerful with a little bit of tender (and a great video). Of all the songs on this year's Top 45 list Dished (Male Stripper) is the one most crying out for a Christmas remix with sleigh bells. So far: nothing. In the wild, terrible world of online pop content the good thing about leaving your end of year list 'quite late' is that songs can sneak in during the year's final moments and totally steal the show. Admittedly this doesn't usually happen, and you end up sensing that you might as well have just compiled the list mid-August like everyone else, but the arrival of this song at the end of November feels like strong vin­dic­a­tion. Seriously, though:  ""This world can hurt you, it cuts you deep and leaves a scar, things falls apart but nothing breaks like a heart."" What a line! This world really can hurt you, can't it? So true. The world is rubbish! But it's better with songs like this in it. Bordering on bearable, you might even say. Let's not get carried away, obviously. But maybe? Maybe pop music is the only thing that never truly lets you down?  And there we have it! It's safe to look at the playlist now.   Fancy meeting up at the same place twelve months from now to find out where Rihanna, Madonna, Marina, Carly, Selena AND FUCKING ABBA end up on the list? Great, see you then.  ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202804.80/warc/CC-MAIN-20190323121241-20190323143241-00483.warc.gz
46,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/articles/troye-sivan-interview-i-feel-more-fully-realised-as-a-person,"Right now Troye Sivan is the ultimate 21st century pop entity and you're probably already trying to think of someone else who fits the bill but just stop right now because you will fail, and while it's sometimes important in life to put yourself in chal­len­ging positions this is not one of those times. Popjustice met up with Troye last week, a couple of days before the Brits, at a recording studio in west London. (Hedi Slimane did the picture at the top of the page by the way, it's very important you know that.)  When we spoke three years ago you talked about the question you asked yourself while making your first album: ""Right, it’s 2015, what makes sense?"" It's 2018 — what makes sense now? I don’t know if I really know the answer to that, so I’m waiting to see if my own answer is that same as everyone else’s. Sonically, if you look at Spotify right now in the Top 20 songs there are two or three pop songs and the rest is hip-hop, so that’s probably an answer to the sound of 2018, but I just really wanted to make music that felt good. 2017 felt like a rough go for everyone; I grew up a lot, and became com­fort­able in my own life. I wanted to provide some relief for everyone. So rather than singing ‘the sad gay song’, I wanted it to be something that was like how I felt on a night out — a little more cel­eb­rat­ory. So that's My My My — does that spirit extend through the rest of your album? There’s a lightness to it. My first album had a really intense, intro­spect­ive, bor­der­line mel­an­choly to it. And there are moments of that on this album, but in general I think it's a lot lighter. Can you give an example?  There's a song called Bloom on there which is, like, complete pop. Like: ‘Katy Perry Teenage Dream’ pop. Bloody hell! It’s that light, sonically. Lyrically it's a bit more cheeky. It’s just a really fun song. I wrote it with Leland and we were dying laughing and just having the best time writing it. Lyrically I think it's the most sub­vers­ively queer song on the album. That's kind of what makes me like it so much — it's almost like a little inside joke. It's [sonically] very con­sum­able pop music so I can imagine the masses under­stand­ing it a little bit more, and that’s funny to me. I don't even think it's neces­sar­ily the big single or anything like that, but I really hope the song ends up spreading its wings way further than the people who wouldn't normally listen to my music. Who are the people who normally listen to your music? It seems like it's mostly younger people — the people I meet on a day to day basis seem to be anywhere between 15 and 27, and a good mix of guys and girls. Let’s talk about a lyric from The Good Side, a song that’s already out there. 1 ""The people danced to the sound of your heart, the world sang along to it falling apart."" WHAT A LYRIC! Thank you. Seriously though. Amazing, right? I mean surely when you write that sort of lyric, it's kind of ‘right — pub’.  Well, yeah… I mean, you're the first person who's brought it up, so thank you. I knew that I loved The Good Side and the lyrics in that song, though. It was, I think, the first time in my life that I feel like I've told an entire story within a song. Normally I feel like I'll get little bits in there, or certain kinds of textures or details in there, but not the entire picture. With this song I feel like you can listen to it from beginning to end and under­stand exactly what I'm talking about. Sometimes albums can feel quite boxed off — The Good Side is like the pop equi­val­ent of movies existing in a shared universe.  These albums def­in­itely exist in the same universe. Thoughout my career my single goal is that I get to keep doing this for as long as I possibly can, so if all goes to plan I hope that in 10 or 15  years when I’m a couple more albums down the line you’ll be able to hear my life story and my growth through those different periods. Lorde did such a great job on her second album: it felt like a catch-up with an old, more developed, more grown up and more exper­i­enced version of the person we all fell in love with in the first place. I’d love if that happened to me. I’d love if I’m 50 and I’m making albums about having kids and people can go, ‘Wow, what a journey.' Some artists you can easily imagine as a 50-year-old artist. Like Ed Sheeran: that's just a straight line from here to there. But then there's an artist like Charli XCX, for instance, where the next three decades is mainly question marks, which is quite exciting. How do you see your next 28 years panning out? I kind of hope it won't be a straight line. I really want to ping-pong around a little bit. I think the happiest moments for me were when I was almost done with writing the album, and then I found out that I got this movie role, and cool stuff started to fall into place and I was having so much fun making all of it. I hope people keep funding my crazy creative pursuits. The real dream come true is when people said to me, ‘it's time to make an album, who do you want to work with?’, and I said: ‘I would love to work with the Max Martin camp, Ariel Rechtshaid, my best friend Leland and Allie X.' And everyone said yes. That, to me, is true success. That's the thing that keeps me going: I want this to be a big com­mer­cial success so that I can keep on having wishlists. I know you under­stand pop better than most of your peers but I wonder if you look at your own career the same way you look at another artist's. Like, do you see what it is about you that makes everyone from Max Martin to Ariel Rechtshaid say yes?  I have no idea. That's a good question. I hope they see them­selves in me a little bit. You know what I mean? Like, my favourite kind of artist, and I feel like it's maybe the same with you, is someone like a Charli, or a Tove Lo, or a Taylor Swift, where you feel like they’re the mas­ter­mind, con­trolling the ship. And they’re the song­writer almost before they're the artist. Like if Taylor Swift had never had a hit song, I still think she would've written humungous, humungous songs for other people. Same with Charli obviously. That's always seemed really cool to me. So I hope people see me and they’re like, ‘Yeah, he gets it. He loves pop music and he wants to, like, really wants to be a part of it.’ Many of the artists we’ve mentioned so far have been female — why has it been so rare for men to do the ‘big pop’ thing in the Katy or Taylor vein? I think his­tor­ic­ally girls have been able to have more fun with pop music, and I think fun is a really important part of pop music. They get to wear the wigs and do the big pop videos and really dance. You know what I mean? And maybe guys felt… Well, I def­in­itely felt like I had to kind of keep it in a certain lane for a long time. Really? Until when? Fairly recently, actually. With this album I sort of was like, ‘Okay, I'm going for it, I want to be whoever I want to be, and I'm just going to let myself try, and I’ll see if people are into it or not.’ But [before] I was always scared of showing the same kind of con­fid­ence that maybe a girl could com­fort­ably show in a video. Or to pull the theatrics, and the looks, and all the stuff that I think we all love about pop music. I mean, what does a guy wear to an award show that's cool and fun and exciting and makes everyone go ‘wow’? I still haven't figured that out. What are you wearing to the Brits? It’s a leather Saint Laurent jacket, a little shirt under­neath, some pants and some kind of combat boots. That’ll do, right? Yeah, maybe? I don't know though. It’s one of the reasons I dyed my hair blonde — I just wanted to have fun and make fun music. It's inter­est­ing you just said that about how you kept yourself in a certain lane, because you’ve obviously moved things forward this time round, but at the same time I didn’t get the impres­sion you were holding yourself back the first time round. Or were you being kept back? Only by myself — I’ve been really lucky with the people around me. I think my entire life I've kind of censored myself to an extent. Because you anti­cip­ated something bad happening, or because something bad already happened? I think it was just growing up in the closet. I think that’s what did it to me. I always felt like I kind of had to censor myself a little bit and keep things chill, and not draw too much attention to myself. The first album was important to me because I was explain­ing myself a little bit: ‘I'm gay, this is what that means, and this is the kind of music that I want to make.’ Were you explain­ing that to other people or yourself? Probably to other people. And now it's a little bit less of that, and a little bit more of: ‘Right, I'm here, and I'm going for it and I really, really hope you guys like it.’ And just hoping for the best. I feel a lot more fully realised as a person. SPEAKING OF WHICH: can we talk about the best bit of your Saturday Night Live Performance, ie when you kept going to the back of the set purely so that you had enough room to do amazing catwalk struts to the front? I saw Duran Duran live a few years ago for reasons I can't now recall and Simon Le Bon seemed to spend half the show walking to the back of the stage so that he too could do amazing struts to the front. It seems strange that more popstars haven't cottoned on to this.  It’s the best feeling in the world. The stage is so small, and I feel best when I'm moving around, but side to side doesn't look as strong as back and forth. Literally, nothing feels better. It feels like you're on top of the world. Now then: TS2. Yes. Is that actually the title of your album? No. It’s just a working title. OH COME ON. It’s a great title for the album. Yeah? Nobody’s done it yet! 2  You’re as much of a fan as you are a popstar, you know what the fandoms are like. Like, imagine if after years of people yelling ‘WHERE IS #R8’ on social media Rihanna had actually called her album R8? Now that is a good album title. Seriously!  Noted. I accept that it’s possibly a bit late in the game for this sug­ges­tion… Everything is saved in my computer as TS2… Maybe you’re right. Hm… I’ll think on this, for sure. 3 When in recent memory have you been happiest?  Probably the day after My My My came out. I woke up and was so excited to check my phone, and I saw so much good stuff. Lovely YouTube comments, tweets from peers, and — while I try and avoid this stuff — some really nice critical acclaim. Pitchfork made it Best New Music, which has not happened to me before. It felt really, really nice. It’s inter­est­ing when artists are ambi­val­ent about critical approval until it appears. You know, it's nice for the ego I guess. But it does feel good when it’s from people you admire. When there are massive bill­boards in Times Square counting down to the release of a comeback single, is there ever a point where you think ‘hm, have I def­in­itely picked the best possible song?’ or is it just ‘these bill­boards are totally justified, it's all amazing, here we go’? There's def­in­itely moments of both. I sort of go back and forth, but it’s about trying to put out your very, very best all the time and in the same breath remem­ber­ing that you can't rely on other people's opinions of you or your music for your happiness and sanity. Like, I believe whole­heartedly that I'm putting out the best thing I possibly can right now. So I can't control anything after that. So yeah, once the bill­boards are up and I've made that decision that My My My is the best first single, it's all systems go and I just have to enjoy the rest of the process. I asked you when you were recently at your happiest but I was really just trying to get at the real question. Which is this: even at your most happy, do you not think you’d still swap that happiness for the lifestyle of a small fish? Bobbing around near a reef. No real knowledge of happiness or sadness. Just floating, being a fish.  I… would not per­son­ally. Have you got something against fish, or their lifestyle? Maybe. (Thinks) No. But I really love my life. Do you not think a fish really loves life as well? But a fish doesn’t get the creative ful­fil­ment that I get to have. BUT they wouldn’t be frus­trated not having it— —because they don’t know it exists. I get it. I think I’d be frus­trated: having had it, I can’t imagine not having it. That's my real driving force — being able to make stuff and getting to make it with people I admire and love. That's the funnest part for me. When you’re a 35-year-old artist and you're doing promo for the album you've just released, what do you think you will say this about: ‘Well, I couldn’t really write about this in my music when I was in my early twenties, but I feel like I can talk about it now.’  I mean, does anyone ever like songs about an artist's kids? I feel like maybe there's a way to do that in a nice way… Madonna did it pretty well but the usual ‘I’m the first person ever to bring children into the world and here are my important thoughts on the matter’ thing is boring. Also ‘I’m on the road and I miss my family and loved ones’— Boring. Yeah. God, I don’t know what I’m going to write about at that point. Actually: Isn’t She Lovely by Stevie Wonder, is that about a kid? Did he have kids? 4 That’s a beautiful song about a kid. Maybe something like that. I suppose it will make more sense when you literally have kids.  Yes. I def­in­itely want to have a family, so I’m going to have to take a break at some point. Is having kids on your mind a lot at the moment? Not at this par­tic­u­lar moment, but when I think about the future that’s all I really think about. I don’t know what it looks like to be a 35-year-old artist, or a 50-year-old artist, for myself… But I can imagine myself making albums on a farm somewhere, more for my own sat­is­fac­tion than anything else. Are you threat­en­ing some sort of man-of-the-woods organic album? I’m into guitars at the moment, like acoustic guitars, but I don't know if I'll ever do the full, like, ‘organic album’ thing. Have you ever touched an owl? Have I ever touched a what? Owl. Like the bird? YES. No. Wait. I’m trying to think. (Impressive pause during which it appears Troye actually is trying to recall any instances of owl-touching, which you'd think would be hard to forget, but whatever)  There was one in the Happy Little Pill music video. I don't remember if I touched it or not. I don't think I did. I saw it. It seemed scary. So you wouldn’t touch an owl now?  I… don’t… think so? When did you last say to somebody: ‘There's something you need to tell you.’ I don't know if I've ever said it like that. That sounds really ominous. I would probably try to soften the blow and not say that — I might say: ‘We need to talk about something.’ The last time was probably a work thing a week or two ago. Anyway, you came up with the idea for My My My while pissing.  Yes. What other events inspired songs on your album — or are they all piss-related? It only happened once. But what else have I been doing while coming up with songs… Buying soup? What’s the most you'd ever spend on soup? Uh, in pounds? Probably £12. TWELVE QUID? Is that a lot? A really nice soup, though? If you’re in a really nice fancy res­taur­ant? Potentially. What song did you come up with while you were being over-charged for soup? Wait, that might also be My My My. There was one day when we got lots of soup. Actually, I think the song might have been Bloom. Where do you get your con­fid­ence? Probably from the fact that I think the coolest people in the world are the people who just do whatever they want, and they like whatever inspires them. So if that's the case, and you’re doing exactly that, then you kind of can't go wrong. So I feel confident when I'm doing what feels right and fun to me. Have you felt that way for a long time? No. I think it's a fairly new real­isa­tion. When I was growing up doing music and stuff, it never scored me cool points at all. So I didn't feel very cool. I mean, if I'd wanted to feel cool, I should have gone to play footy or something like that. How would that have panned out, do you think?  Terribly. But I never had any interest in anything like that. I did music instead, or I did acting or whatever. Then when I started to travel, and realised I was onto something, I started to realise that it made me cool in a different way. Then I looked at it all again, and realised you can carve out your own path, and I looked at people I admire and saw how they were just doing that exact same thing for them­selves. And then I was like: ‘Okay, cool. Maybe I am kind of like doing the right thing — I'm on the right path and I'm just going to keep going.’ Given how much the digital landscape’s changed in the last decade, if you were twelve in 2018 how would you make yourself stand out?  I would go back to YouTube, actually. I’d start on YouTube again. It felt so personal and genuine — like people can get a real taste of who you actually are. I'd have no idea how to get signed and stuff like that without doing what I did. I don’t even know how or where I would start. Like, what do you do? Send demo tapes to labels or something? I really don’t get it! Who would play the person playing you in a film about the making of a film about your life? Er… Well, Timothée Chalamet would, I hope, play me. So then who would play Timothée Chalamet? There’s not many of us — pale and skinny… I suppose the reason that was a shit question, par­tic­u­larly to someone who's also an actor, is that the obvious answer would be: you. You would play the person playing you.  That would be fun, actually. That would be really cool. I don’t think I’m ever going to ask that question again. I panicked last week and acci­dent­ally asked a popstar if they ever bought food in bulk. Wow. Also, though: Troye Sivan, do you ever buy food in bulk? Unintentionally, yeah. I do a lot of my grocery shopping online, don't look in the cupboard before I order, and I’ll just order more. It’s alright if it’s pasta, but not if it’s spinach. Well this has been a terrible end to an enjoyable interview. Thanks Troye! Thank you so much. Goodbye! .

48,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/briefing/2014-a-z-j-is-for-jazz-album/," In 2008, Lady Gaga was the best popstar in the world. In 2009, Lady Gaga was the best popstar in the world. In 2010, Lady Gaga was the best popstar in the world. In 2011, Lady Gaga was the best popstar in the world. In 2012, Lady Gaga was the best popstar in the world. In 2013, Lady Gaga was still just about the best popstar in the world. In 2014, Lady Gaga released a jazz album. Except actually it wasn't really a Lady Gaga jazz album. A Lady Gaga jazz album would have seen Lady Gaga doing to jazz what Lady Gaga did to pop: identi­fy­ing the best bits, inventing some even better bits, turning the whole thing inside out and thrilling the world. Lady Gaga's Tony Bennett duets album 'Cheek To Cheek' was not something that conformed to Gaga's brand values at all. When you consider how exper­i­mental, avant-garde and breath­tak­ingly insane jazz can be, and when you consider how incen­di­ary it could have been to add Lady Gaga to the mix, the album she released was almost offens­ively ped­es­trian. We kept reading things about 'Cheek To Cheek' being a brave move. It didn't sound very brave to us. What's brave about releasing an album of easy listening covers for the Q4 market? This said, Gaga got to make an album she could be truly pas­sion­ate about, and as anyone who follows her on Twitter will tell you, she was thrilled by the good reviews the album received from esteemed critics. Where's the harm in that?  Several years ago Lady Gaga made a promise: POP MUSIC WILL NEVER BE LOWBROW. It's hard to see where this fits in with 'Cheek To Cheek', an album through which Lady Gaga was appar­ently attempt­ing to be taken seriously, in certain circles, for the first time. The idea, in so far as we could under­stand it, was that 'Cheek To Cheek' would allow Gaga's true artistry to shine through. We're not sure that's the Lady Gaga we fell in love with. The Lady Gaga we fell in love with would say ""FUCK YOU"" to anyone who only took her seriously when she adhered to con­ser­vat­ive notions of talent and artistry. She'd say ""FUCK YOU"" to anyone who con­sidered 'Bad Romance', 'Alejandro' or 'Poker Face' somehow unworthy of rigorous critical attention simply because they were pop songs. And she'd say ""FUCK YOU"" to anyone who finally com­pli­men­ted her on her vocal talents just because they were being used away from a drum machine. Maybe we got her wrong at the start. Maybe she was using pop to get somewhere else, when we thought she was using pop to make pop a better place. Maybe the Gaga we thought we fell in love with never really existed at all. Actually that's bollocks. We're abso­lutely sure she did exist. And while some have written her off, we also feel with complete certainty that the Lady Gaga who once ruled the planet will one day exist again. We're not sure when that'll be, but we do know that she'd have been back in the game a lot sooner if she'd taken a year off instead of releasing 'Cheek To Cheek'.

49,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/briefing/2014-az-d-is-for-discography-with-a-bangerz-repack-shaped-hole-in-it/," Seriously though. What cruel twist of pop fate dictated that one of the only 2013 albums screaming out for a 2014 repack is about to end the year com­pletely unre­packed? Think of the potential titles. Yet DESPITE the potential for amaz­ing­ness in the repack-titling arena, no new 'Bangerz' material appeared. Six to eight new Miley songs in 2014, building on 'Bangerz' and pushing things forward, could have been just what the year needed. Instead: nothing. The only sensible explan­a­tion for this is that Miley's label wanted to avoid a Q4 2014 'Bangerz' repack getting in the way of a Q2 2015 BRAND NEW ALBUM. For that reason, and that reason alone, we can't stay angry. But that's not to say we're not dis­ap­poin­ted. While we're here, can we just discuss how great the 'physical product' of 'Bangerz' was, all those years ago, back in last year?                 And that wasn't even the version with the free stickers and altern­at­ive cover.

51,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/briefing/28-plays-later-justin-timberlake-suit-tie/108271/," We went through this last time we did a 28 Plays Later but just to recap: it takes 28 listens to fully digest a pop song. Sometimes that breaks down nicely as one play every day for a month. Often, you'll get to 28 in a couple of weeks. Sometimes you get through all 28 listens in a day. It's natural, of course, to sometimes dismiss the song after one listen or decide that it's the greatest thing ever after two, but if you keep playing it you'll find that 28 plays later you've got your head around the whole thing. Up for dis­cus­sion today: Justin Timberlake's 'Suit & Tie'. It's now one week since this appeared online and we're not sure where your playcount is but as of this morning ours is now finally at 28, so we can comment on the song knowing that our final decision will be defin­it­ive, unswerving and 100% correct. Here's how the 'listening exper­i­ence' panned out.  PLAY 0: This is exciting. Justin was far away but now he is close. One of the best male popstars of the last twenty years is back with a new song. We're concerned that producer Timbaland isn't exactly at the top of his game, but Justin wouldn't put up with any rubbish, right? PLAY 1: This is rubbish, and extremely long. The tempo is wrong. It sounds dated. We don't even par­tic­u­larly want to listen to it again, but we must. Because a Justin Timberlake comeback single would never be proper rubbish, regard­less of first impres­sions. PLAY 2: Perhaps it's not actual rubbish — it could make a decent third single from an album, if they were strug­gling. PLAY 8:  It's only now that the real horror of the lyrics is settling in. ""So thick, now I know why they call it a fatty."" Oh Justin. (Halfway through this play an email arrives from a friend. She's just listened to the song. Her verdict: ""It's a bit Kenny Thomas."") PLAY 9: Maybe third single from an album is pushing it. But as an album track it would probably work quite well. PLAY 10: We like a bit of Jay-Z but on 'Suit & Tie' he's failing to deliver the goods. Should Justin really need a guest spot to make his comeback seem special? We under­stand that he likes to situate himself in the 'urban' 'milieu' and that col­lab­or­a­tions and guest spots have a different sort of currency there but he is a popstar more than he is An Urban Thing and this reminds us a bit of when Madonna came back with (HANG ON A MOMENT) a Justin Timberlake guest spot on the Timbaland-produced '4 Minutes'. Back then it felt like a bit of a copout that Madonna decided to come back with a col­lab­or­a­tion — face it, she's Madonna — and it feels equally aimless here. Shouldn't all eyes be on Justin? Isn't Justin enough? PLAY 13: The JLS single that everyone said was a shit version of a Justin Timberlake song would be a better Justin Timberlake song than this shit Justin Timberlake song. PLAY 15: This would usually be the point where a dodgy song would begin to wear down the listener to the point where they're going ""oh actually this isn't an iconic banger or whatever but if you accept it for what it is it's pretty good really"". But it's not happening. It's jaunty, we suppose. JAUNTY. You want more than 'jaunty' from a Justin single, don't you. PLAY 16: It's actually impossible, based on 'Suit & Tie', to predict what the rest of the Justin album will be like. Is this the best song on it? Is it a taste of everything else on the album, or is it a 'taste­m­ak­ing' effort 'for the heads'? PLAY 21: Boring. PLAY 22: Still boring. PLAY 25: Britney would never have let this happen. PLAY 27: Listening to this song 27 times has been a pretty joyless exercise. PLAY 28: Thank God that's over. We gave it a chance. We gave it 28 chances. But the new Justin Timberlake single is offi­cially, and very dis­ap­point­ingly, mediocre. Maybe it takes 29 listens. UPDATE: At around 9pm tonight we gave 'Suit & Tie' its 29th listen. And do you know what? Without the pressure of having to think about whether we liked it or not, and without having to note down our thoughts, and without feeling that we needed to over-analyse the song as anything other than a piece of music in its own right, it was still rubbish.

52,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/briefing/3x-popstars-who-look-like-theyre-here-on-work-experience/,"Some artists are born to conquer. They have x factor. They have swagger. When they walk into a room heads turn. Other artists, meanwhile, walk into a room and are imme­di­ately asked to fetch coffee. Here are 3X popstars who are more at the Horan end, than the Styles end, of the pop­grav­itas spectrum.  Here's a picture Capital FM presenter Rich Clarke tweeted earlier today. You'll note that Sheero def­in­itely has the look of someone getting his picture taken with famous people on the last day of a two week placement.  Take a look at this video in which Owl interacts with Carly Rae Jepsen. One of these people is obviously a globe-strad­dling pop warbler in full control of their persona. The other is just one fluffed line away from being sent out to buy paper­clips.  Conor is a very special inclusion on this list. Not just because in almost every picture on Google Images he is either pointing at or being pointed at by a celebrity, but because as well as looking like he's in pop on work exper­i­ence, he also looks like he's here as a com­pet­i­tion winner. We'd say the picture with Niall 'Just Happy To Be Here' Horan is the real classic here: despite Conor being taller (which would usually suggest at least some element of dominance) and despite the fact that he's with Niall Horan, Maynard still looks like he's the one who's about to get a bol­lock­ing for sending an important letter by post rather than motor­cycle courier.

53,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/briefing/a-1999-remix-that-sounds-like-1999/,"The thing with 1999 is that it doesn't sound loads like a song from 1999. The Whigfield bit sounds like 1994, for instance. Imagine if they'd done the whole thing in the style of a Max Martin mega­banger, or Ricky Martin's Livin' La Vida Loca! Fortunately there is now a remix that addresses this issue, and we'll have to tread slightly carefully here because there's a slim chance Michael Calfan didn't actually intend his remix to sound like something from nineteen years ago. ﻿ So Michael, if you were hoping for your rework to sound like 2018, and if you finished it and thought, ""yes, this sums up everything exciting about what's happening in pop right now"", please accept Popjustice's most humble apologies. But the truth of the matter is that, yes, this mix does sound 'his­tor­ic­ally factual', so presuming this was the intention well done to Michael and well done to whoever com­mis­sioned the remix. Hey, here's an idea. If there are more remixes of the song coming, why not rope in some of 1999's actual big pop remixers? NO ACTUALLY how about this! An EP of his­tor­ic­ally accurate 'dance' remixes, like a poppers o'clock version of The Sealed Knot, and THEN an EP of different inter­pret­a­tions of the song, each homaging a different hit from 1999? So obviously there would be Livin' La Vida Loca, but then you could also have the song reima­gined in the style of Backstreet Boys' I Want It That Way, Destiny's Child's Bills, Bills, Bills, and S Club's Bring It All Back.

She has her photo taken with horses for a start, that's got to count for something. There's loads of music on Spotify and her current song 'Cry Baby' is a jam and a half; she's playing in London next month, with a new EP out in a few weeks.

Sia and Sean Paul. Years & Years and Tove Lo. Chvrches and Hayley. Troye and Alessia. We're big fans of adding a little extra something to an estab­lished song and, yes, you could say it's all about pro­long­ing a song's life in the streaming era and, yes, you could also say something about it being a cynical attempt to revive interest from radio stations but ignore all that because single versions are BACK and they should be cherished.

Too many to mention here. Somewhere between 318 and 422 things. Loads of things. But the five best — and one worst — are currently: We met Lao Ra in a pub a few weeks ago and from the moment she walked in the door it was a total POPSTAR ALERT scenario. Latest release 'Bang Boom' is a big step forward from the also-amazing 'Drum Machine' single and 'Jesus Made Me Bad' EP and there are even bigger things to come.  A pre-emptive entry on the Almighty for high-octane song­writer Julia Michaels, who recently signed with Republic AS A SOLO ARTISTE. We awarded Julia an OPE in our 2016 Honours List; a skim through Julia's writing credits is clear indic­a­tion that we could be on the verge of wit­ness­ing one of the most exciting sort-of-new artist launches since Sia. Her debut EP is out at the start of next year. Look we know the charts have slowed down and it can take a while for tracks to make their way to the top. We also know that the official charts don't really mean anything in 2016. And, well, Tinashe is pretty much the opposite of a UK chart-botherer. But come on. This is a Number One-worthy tune. You sort of get the sense that in a couple of years we'll look back on 'Party Politics' and 'Home Sweet Home' (above) as really obvious hints of what The Rhythm Method were always going to achieve. You know how you listen to the earlier Years & Years songs and think ""well yes I didn't really notice it at the time but OF COURSE they were going to drop a seismic pop banger like 'King'""? It's basically that, but with lyrical ref­er­ences to buying reduced-aisle super­mar­ket food­stuffs. We've heard something quite exciting about the duo's next single, so 'watch out for that one', as they say in show­busi­ness. Lyric of the year. (NB: If you haven't yet watched the video for 'Rockabye' it really is 'quite something'.)  Unless Blu-Tac launch a dec­or­a­tions-themed campaign featuring Fleur East belting out a sleigh­bell-abetted, tur­bocharged poppers o'clock version of Madonna's 'Hung Up', we are sad to announce that all Christmas ad campaign music is banned. It was a tough decision but at the same time it was abso­lutely not. That's all for now. Anything you'd like to see on a future Almighty? Let us know, we like finding out about stuff.

We all took our eyes off our par­rotu­lar friends after that, but what happened in the inter­ven­ing six years? Well, Calvin Harris ended up doing alright for himself but on the bird front those parrots simply grew up. Back in the day they might have been exploited by pop artists as just another way to market records, but now they've become the planet's biggest taste­m­akers.

61,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/briefing/a-slightly-haphazard-selection-of-music-books-because-it-is-world-book-day/,"Books. They're like songs, except they go on longer and there's no sound. But they're still quite good! I don't really know what I intended this post to be when I started writing it, but what it's ended up being is a very strange selection of music books from the past, the present and the future. It's an assort­ment based on very little rhyme and abso­lutely no reason. Some books are good, some are quite bad. Some are inter­est­ing, some are boring. They're all worth a go, though.  (I'm assuming you've already read the Lily Allen book.) I read this over Christmas but given how closely Maloney's 2012 X Factor reappear­ance as a wildcard con­test­ant mirrored the story of Jesus' own comeback perhaps you'll find it makes sense as an Easter read. As you might expect there are some unin­ten­tion­ally ludicrous moments in this book — it's incred­ible to think that among the billions of sentences written in the history of humankind never before have the following words appeared in the following order: ""I was now living off crackers and spam and lasted four days before vomiting every­where on a fermented egg.""  Which may seem funny in isolation, but it's not so funny in context: Wildcard tells the story of a man whose life has rarely, if ever, been easy. Wildcard isn't the greatest book of all time but it's an important read for any of us who at one time or another have cheerily dis­mantled Maloney or celebrit­ies like him. On the left: a legendary book from fifteen years ago that got loads of things right.  On the right: a new book I haven't read properly yet and which seems, shall we say, a little light on jokes, but which also (among some quite dry business stuff) unpacks a lot of inform­a­tion about how Spotify ended up becoming a pop force whose full impact nobody really saw coming.  You can get a fair idea of what Spotify Teardown's like via the Amazon Look Inside feature. Music publicist Mick Houghton's account of two decades' work in the music industry isn't out for a few months, but an advance copy arrived in the post last week and I finished it yesterday.  I first encountered Mick when I was an extremely annoying twelve-year-old who didn't really under­stand what music pub­li­cists did, but I sort of figured out that if you phoned them, like, on an actual telephone, and if they were as patient as Mick Houghton, they might sometimes send you music by and pho­to­graphs of your favourite band. Maybe that sort badgering is only really tolerated if the pub­li­cists have them­selves exper­i­enced the feeling of being, as Houghton describes his youth in the first page of this book's first chapter, ""mad about music as a teenager"".  Fried & Justified is frank and sometimes funny, and I suppose it's mainly a memoir, but it's something else, too. One of Houghton's most suc­cess­ful acts once wrote a book in which they told readers how to have a Number One single; while not presented or intended as such, Fried & Justified could easily be regarded as a manual on how to be a decent music PR.   Look, strictly speaking this book doesn't exist yet but I think we can all safely assume it will be very much on the right side of readable. (Hopper's 2015 col­lec­tion of writing is an absolute banger.) The weird thing about the whole absurd story of a record label being bought then totally bol­locksed up by an invest­ment group is that it happened REALLY RECENTLY and SORT OF IN FRONT OF OUR EYES, and somehow the full extent of the shambles was never really obvious.  Anyway, Eamonn's book is the opposite of shit as well as being a) jaw-dropping and b) very funny in parts, the latter of which you really can't ever take for granted in books about the music industry. Selling The Pig does also highlight just how ludicrous, compared to most other indus­tries, the music industry can be: all the guesswork, all the excess, all the failure that's somehow part of the plan. There are times in this book when you almost — almost —  feel sorry for the people who came in and thought they could fix it.  This one just arrived in the post so I've only had the chance for a quick flick through but it's based on a great idea: each chapter takes a different song and explores its char­ac­ters in the form of a short story.  ""I wondered what was going on outside the tracks,"" Easter explains in the intro­duc­tion. ""The composer gives us so much, but what about the rest? What does Dolly Parton's Jolene look like and why's she stealing everyone's men? What's her back story?""  Cover Stories expands the worlds of songs like Bowie's Space Oddity and Ed Sheeran's The A-Team. (If there's a second volume I'd def­in­itely read a chapter on Rihanna's Man Down.) Apart from the bad font on the cover this has to be the perfect pop­cul­tural artefact, right?  It contains a 15-page intro­duc­tion in which I assume Neil talks about the song­writ­ing process, but I'm not totally sure because I am saving it for a special day. You've got to have something to look forward to in life, right? (Neil's col­lec­tion was the first in what's turned out to be a series of collected lyric 'tomes'; Kate Bush and Shaun Ryder have already chucked theirs out, pre­sum­ably there'll be an Anne-Marie one along before too long.)  In which, over 120 pages, Radio 1 DJ Peter Powell attempted to cover the total history of pop music and the workings of the entire music industry, while also telling readers how to be popstars and throwing in the occa­sional quiz. The result was, well, not great, but this is such a fas­cin­at­ing artefact.  Loads-slash-most of the book is glor­i­ously out of date now, of course, but Peter's advice on how to write a hit song is hil­ari­ously blunt and, if you take a click through some of 2019's biggest songs, it remains spookily accurate: ""The melody .… has to fit whatever the current trends in music happen to be. Try listening to and studying the Top Forty. If you play an instru­ment, try playing one of two of the songs and get the feel of the way the chords are strung together. Then change them around and see how that sounds."" Outstanding. If you'd like to read this book there are currently two copies on Amazon — one is £0.01 and the other is £24.40 (?) so take your pick. If you can't be bothered with all that but still fancy a glimpse of what Radio 1 DJs were like four decades ago, clear 25 minutes in your diary for A World Of Difference on YouTube. It's an old BBC doc­u­ment­ary that follows the sur­pris­ingly bleak early morning routine of Noel Edmonds as he hosts the Radio 1 Breakfast Show.

62,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/briefing/a-wink-to-camera-with-the-1975/,"Matty off The 1975 has a way of describ­ing part/s of his persona. Paraphrasing here, but it basically involves him going, ""Look! I'm Jim Morrison!"", then imme­di­ately and slightly apo­lo­get­ic­ally going, ""Well, I'm not really Jim Morrison, but you know what I mean."" You see it happen on stage quite a lot when the band play live. It's there in the A Change Of Heart lyrics too, with that line about quoting On The Road ""like a twat"": he gets to reference a seminal Jack Kerouac book, but he knows it's a cliché, and he gets to tell us that he knows it's a cliché, but he still gets to reference it. And there's a literal wink to camera in The 1975's new video for It's Not Living If It's Not With You, which homages Talking  Heads' Stop Making Sense concert film from many pop lifetimes ago, but throws plenty of new ideas into the mix, too. Like the Jim Morrison idea and the A Change Of Heart lyrics, it's saying: I'm doing a thing, but not really doing a thing, and you know I'm doing a thing but not really doing a thing, and I know you know I'm doing a thing but not really doing a thing, AND you know I know you know I'm doing a thing but not really doing a thing. But also, I'm doing the thing. The only real flaw in this video is the absence of ""selling petrol"", a lyrical aside that pushes the song firmly into 10/10 territory and might actually be the one of the best bits not of just this song but of all pop in 2018. Also, here, for reference, is part of the Talking Heads film. ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912205534.99/warc/CC-MAIN-20190326135436-20190326161436-00158.warc.gz

They happened slightly by accident, about ten years ago, when a lot of the best pop felt like it still happened slightly by accident. They were a six-piece Danish band staffed almost entirely by people called Anders whose euphoric 80s-influ­enced pop ended up crossing over both com­mer­cially and inter­na­tion­ally. For a moment songs like Fascination and 10,000 Nights Of Thunder were ines­cap­able.  After the band's third album they split. An Anders from the band tells the Official Charts website today that they ""could no longer sit down and write a song for Alphabeat – it just wasn’t possible anymore."" Seems like that's no longer a problem. There's a whole new album due later this year and Shadows is a rather charming way of kicking things off.

64,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/briefing/and-it-feeeeeeeels-like-victory/103862/," Last night in London, Will Young's 'Jealousy' became the tenth recipient of the Popjustice Twenty Quid Music Prize. Judging was a long, booze-strewn and sometimes 'high-spirited' process. Here's what happened. Round One: Instant elim­in­a­tion
As is 'customary', the first round involved selecting one song from the shortlist to be unce­re­mo­ni­ously booted out of the contest. The judges iden­ti­fied Siobhan Dillon's 'Powerless' as an early target, although the Lawson single was also mentioned. In the end 'Powerless' got the boot. Round Two: Rudimental's 'Feel The Love' vs Nero's 'Promises' 
For this and all sub­sequent rounds, songs were randomly selected from a pint glass. By coin­cid­ence, 'Feel The Love' and 'Promises' are com­par­able songs in a 'semi-faceless Radio 1-friendly mainstream/underground dance' sort of way. Our sug­ges­tion that Nero's 'Promises' is the amazing Leona Lewis comeback single Leona Lewis never made fell on deaf ears, chiefly because it literally was never made, and Nero went out. 'Feel The Love' went back into the pint glass and we continued. Round Three: The Saturdays' 'All Fired Up' vs Little Mix's 'Wings'
Again, purely by coin­cid­ence, the two big girlband singles were selected next. Two of  the writers behind 'All Fired Up' were in attend­ance, although one of them also co-wrote 'Wings' which evened things up a bit. At one point it was observed that 'Wings' was better because Little Mix have a 'co-writing' credit on it, which didn't go down well in the room. Lyrically the songs dwelled on two fairly played-out topics (""this disco dancing business is quite fun"" and ""boo hoo they called me ugly"" respect­ively) but it was noted that both songs had strong sonic iden­tit­ies. Things got a bit heated at one point but nobody was injured. We reckon 'Wings' would have gone further in the contest if it had been up against a different song, but it went out in this round, and 'All Fired Up' went back in the pint glass. Round Four: The Saturdays' 'All Fired Up' vs Lawson's 'Taking Over Me'
There wasn't a huge amount of debate here. It was noted that in terms of each song's first ten seconds 'Taking Over Me' made a bigger impact than 'All Fired Up', but a show of hands ensured that Lawson went out in this round. Round Five: Rudimental's 'Feel The Love' vs Olly Murs' 'Heart Skips A Beat'
It was broadly agreed that 'Heart Skips A Beat' was such a belting tune that it didn't matter that the hat-wearing loon on warbling duties was Olly Murs, and Rudimental's song went out. Round Six: Saint Etienne's 'Tonight' vs Olly Murs' 'Heart Skips A Beat'
For this round, the five (random) members of the judging panel who had balloons in their welcome packs were called to the front of the room. While holding inflated balloons they were asked to tell the room which song should go through. Two votes for Saint Etienne were followed by two votes for Olly Murs, leaving the Louis Walsh of the evening to decide that Saint Etienne should go through. Round Seven: Rizzle Kicks' 'Down With The Trumpets' vs One Direction's 'What Makes You Beautiful'
There was some chat about whether or not One Direction's message of hope to des­pond­ent teens was escapist genius or disin­genu­ous rubbish, followed by the assertion that Rizzle Kicks probably would shag you, followed by the point that One Direction actually didn't seem too picky either. When one person said she couldn't remember how 'What Makes You Beautiful' went, another judge jumped on a piano and banged out a version of the song, prompting a mass singalong. Getting the debate back on track, the main argument here seemed to be that the Rizzle Kicks single was quite relaxed and the One Direction single was quite keen to please, which we suppose fits in pretty well with the respect­ive artistes' broader 'nar­rat­ives'. In the end, One Direction went through to the next round. Round Eight: Saint Etienne's 'Tonight' vs The Saturdays' 'All Fired Up'
Smokers in the room were invited to choose between these songs in the time it took to smoke a fag. The result — that Saint Etienne's 'Tonight' should go through — was not hugely popular with the rest of the room, but you can't argue with democracy. Round Nine: One Direction's 'What Makes You Beautiful' vs Saint Etienne's 'Tonight'
After an impress­ive run — and a spirited speech from one Saint Etienne fan — it was time for 'Tonight' to go. Round Ten: Will Young's 'Jealousy' vs One Direction's 'What Makes You Beautiful'
After staying in the pint glass for most of the night, it was finally time for Will Young's 'Jealousy' to face the judges. As soon as people  started talking about the song it was clear that — even with another round to go — we'd found our winner. One person noted that if we were looking for a male version of 'Call The Shots', this was it. Another made the point that this was the moment when Will Young picked up the Pet Shop Boys' legacy and ran with it. By this point the song's producer, Richard X, had joined the judges, and he made a warm, per­suas­ive and poignant argument for 'Jealousy' to stay in. One Direction went out. Round Eleven: Will Young's 'Jealousy' vs Marina & The Diamonds' 'Power & Control'
One of the stranger aspects of the songs-in-a-pint-glass nature of the Twenty Quid Music Prize judging is that some songs escape scrutiny until the very final stages. And so it was the Marina's 'Power & Control' made it through to the 'final' simply by keeping its head down for the entire night. It felt like 'Jealousy' had already won, really, but the judges went through each song's pros and cons and listed them on the wall. We forgot to take a picture of these but @gemtriesharder got a snap of the Will Young pros and cons:  It was suggested that Marina's 'Primadonna' might have fared better than 'Power & Control', but even 'Primadonna' would have had trouble competing with the over­whelm­ing, quite touching pos­it­iv­ity the judges were showing for 'Jealousy'. Anyway, 'Jealousy' won by a landslide. Let's be fair, it's a pretty good song, right? Right. Richard X kindly accepted the twenty quid (cash) prize on Will's behalf.  Here (right) is a shoddy picture (via @harrietnoble) of Richard col­lect­ing the award. Thanks to everyone who came along and helped judge the prize last night, and we hope your hangovers aren't too bad this morning. Obviously the whole Twenty Quid thing only started off as a bit of a stupid pisstake of the Mercury prize but each year, when judging night comes around, it's hard not to be moved and invig­or­ated by the passion, humour and energy with which people approach the pop single: the greatest art form in the history of everything.

65,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/briefing/april-30-2265-a-warning/," We trailed this last week and have been sitting on the incen­di­ary news
for a few days now, scared at what might happen when it is released
into the public domain, but the public have a right to know. SUNDAY APRIL 30 2265 IS THE DAY EVERY MAN WOMAN AND CHILD IN THE UNITED KINGDOM WILL BE A SUGABABE.  This day of Mutyageddon may be more than two centuries away, but it is real.  Very real indeed. Our cal­cu­la­tion takes a few things into account: that instances of the three-piece Sugababes (or the total number of past or present Sugababes) double every 11 years, that newborn babies replace the deceased in existing Sugababes lineups, that pop­u­la­tion trends continue and so on. It is a phe­nomenon we will refer to as Population Overload. Crushingly, the signs were there when the Sugababes released their first ever single, and it has taken until now for us to acknow­ledge the rami­fic­a­tions. METHODOLOGY We know that you might call some of our meth­od­o­logy into question but we're fairly confident with this pre­dic­tion because the date has been produced with the guidance of A PROPER MATHS TEACHER, Mr Smy, who is the 'Curriculum Leader for Maths' at John Bentley School in Wiltshire. (Thanks to everyone else from Twitter who offered to help out.) Mr Smy even shows his working (right), which means he must be a proper maths person, right? GLOBAL WARBLING: YOUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED

» This event is over 200 years away — can't we do anything to change it?
It is already too late. The best we can do now is prepare for the inev­it­able, to adapt our life­styles, and to educate our children in the hope that they, and our des­cend­ants, don't make similar mistakes. » Can't I just move to another country?
That would be like moving away from the polar ice cap as it melted. Unfortunately, as its name suggests, global warbling is not a localised threat. Our cal­cu­la­tions suggest that by 2332 the entire pop­u­la­tion of Planet Earth will be a Sugababe.  » Global warbling doesn't seem all that bad to me, won't it be nice to have a bit more singing?
 A few extra Sugababes might seem like a nice idea right now, and in our lifetimes we may only live to see another sixty instances of the band, but the true effects of this will be felt by our children and their grand­chil­dren. The day of Mutyageddon is only eight gen­er­a­tions away in the UK, and ten gen­er­a­tions away for the entire planet. » Which version of the Sugababes will be the best?
The 65,378,007th version of Sugababes will prove to be the band's defin­it­ive lineup, although by that point people will still be bickering about bloody Siobhan Donaghy on the Popjustice forums.

66,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/briefing/best-albums-of-2014/," So we were thinking about what should be on our Best Albums Of 2013 list, which we still haven't finished, and we started wondering would would be on our Best Albums Of 2014 list. Loads of albums that haven't been released yet, obviously. Some that haven't even been recorded yet. So we started making a list, and we got a bit carried away. EDIT: We started with 85 but have added another 20, although one of those is by Lewis Hamilton. :(
EDIT EDIT: Alright make that 106 Abba
This one might not actually come out or ever even exist so it's not a great one to kick off the list with but the latest round of rearrival rumours suggest something to tie in with the 40th anniversary of 'Waterloo', and Agnetha seems com­fort­able with being a popstar now in a way she hasn't for a very long time, so perhaps something could happen. In 2013 we presented five options for an Abba reunion; perhaps in 2014 a new album could be one of them? Adam Lambert
Lambo has recently 'parted ways with' his old record label. Something will happen in 2014. We’ve heard some secret things about what’s going on with him and based on what we have heard he should have a really good year. Adele
The follow-up to '21' ('25' if she releases it before May, otherwise '26') must surely be coming in 2014. Kid Harpoon and James Ford have already been named as col­lab­or­at­ors; reports back in April said four songs were written but there were probably a shitload more even at that point. The phrase ""modern jazz"" was also mentioned. Aiden
Aiden's recent EP release seemed like a bit of a clearing-out-my-closet, state­menty type of affair following his departure from RCA, but it also sets the stage for something big in 2014. When he was on The X Factor we said he'd suit a one-man Hurts type of release and his EP feels like a move in that direction, but with more varied and unpre­dict­able twists and turns. Alex Metric
We asked Alex if he'd have an album out next year and he said possibly not, but we asked if his inclusion on this list might provide some motiv­a­tion and he said yes, so here he is. Whether there's an album or not, there is a very exciting new single on its way (it's the follow-up to the excellent Stuart Price and Niki & The Dove col­lab­or­a­tion 'Safe With You') and more details of that will no doubt emerge sooner rather than later. Alexa Goddard
After a few years on the fringes of pop this British singer recently signed a major record deal, and from the music we've heard she could find herself posi­tioned as a sort of British Rihanna. Lots of big tunes, really pop. Her first single’s due out in the spring, after which we presume there’ll be some ‘single two into album release’ type action. All Saints  That’ll do nicely. A*M*E
Fingers crossed for this one… Amelia Lily
This album was supposed to come out in 2013 and things didn't look great when Amazon refunded all pre-orders but Amelia's Twitter followers will be well aware that the optim­istic songstrel is still recording, so something way well come out in 2014. Leaked album track 'Truth Or Dare' certainly deserves an official release.   Anne-Marie
We’ve already featured Anne-Marie and she’s been off on tour with Rudimental in recent weeks. It looks like the ground­work is being laid for a single in the first few months of 2014 (her management's website bio suggests it might have been due in 2013) with an album to follow. Aston out of JLS
This has been on the cards for some time and it’s a solo career that really hinges on the second single. You’d obviously expect a good showing for the first release, and for everyone to pull out all the stops to ensure that it’s a) decent and b) a hit. But it’s when the second single comes around that you really start to get a handle on whether label, A&R, man­age­ment and even fans feel this can go the distance. Avec Sans
This has all the makings of one of 2014’s best elec­tronic pop albums. Betty Who
Nothing says “I love you” quite like getting a company that shoots virals to record you proposing to your boyfriend while a con­spicu­ously-well-credited song by a pre­vi­ously unknown act blares away in the back­ground. Regardless of its true spon­taneity this video created a lot of attention for Betty Who during 2013, the act sub­sequently signed to RCA, and there’s a full album due in 2014. Beyoncé
Q1 appar­ently. We're sort of beyond caring at this point but that all depends on the first single. Biffco
Imagine if a man, let’s call him Biff Stannard, had worked with acts like Kylie, the Spice Girls, Hurts, Calvin Harris, Will Young and Little Mix over the years, and imagine if to celebrate twenty years at the top of pop he roped in a load of people he’d recorded with over his career, and imagine if it all came out on an album of pop amaz­ing­ness. Imagine that. The Bird & The Bee
Apparently there'll be something from Greg Kurstin's side project during 2014… Bonnie McKee
'American Girl' didn't launch Bonnie's solo career (or relaunch it — she had an album out almost a decade ago) as effect­ively as was perhaps intended, despite being extremely brilliant. 'Sleepwalker' was rather less brilliant, but we're still holding out for an album next year. Brandon Flowers
Brandon recently confirmed that he's working on a new solo album. Its greatness (or otherwise) will depends on col­lab­or­at­ors, but even if it's as bad as his first solo album there'll still be one good song. Bright Light Bright Light
Whenever you're ready Rod. Broods
It still seems early days for the New Zealand duo whose song 'Bridges' we wrote about a couple of months ago, but the other tracks we've heard are great (they've also been recorded with Lorde col­lab­or­ator Joel Little) and an album late in 2014 shouldn't be out of the question. Cady Groves
We think Cady has what it takes to be an inter­na­tional superstar and the music we've heard backs it up.  Calvin Harris
Obviously it's now the law that Calvin Harris can't release an album until about five of its tracks have been Top 3 hits, but the Alesso and Hurts col­lab­or­a­tion 'Under Control' has just hit Number One so the countdown to the fourth Calvin album is already under way. An email sent out by his label last month said that an album would arrive in 2014, although this seemed to take Calvin himself rather by surprise. Cassie
Could 2014 be the year this album finally comes out? Charli XCX
Charli's already confirmed that this will be out around June. Even if it slips to The Other Side Of Summer (sadly no decent albums can be released between June and September as all record label employees are either off their heads at festivals or dealing with furious comedowns) that'll be fine with us. As long as it's on its way, that's fine. It was recently suggested that one of the col­lab­or­at­ors on this album would be POP LEGEND CATHY DENNIS. Cher Lloyd
We’ve been thinking about this album quite a bit over the last fortnight and the more we think about it the more we think it might contain one of 2014’s three best singles. The rest of the album could be all over the place of course, but doesn’t it seem as if Cher Lloyd could become properly amazing around this release? Cheryl Cole
Expect something pretty big for the first single. And expect that to come in 'Q2'. Chlöe Howl
This all seemed to be going a bit wonky before Howlo was added to the BBC Sound Of longlist, but perhaps that little boost will mean things could happen for her in 2014. Either way the album’s shaping up to be really good so there you go. CHVRCHES
The band recently told us that they're already working on the follow-up to this year's 'The Bones Of What You Believe'. We'd put this one down for a late 2014 release, although 2015 isn't out of the question. You know how these things are. Cinnamon Girl
Cinnamon Girl is brilliant. She’s signed to RCA, Richard ‘Biff’ Stannard is working on her album,  the first bits are due out next year, and she might just be Britain's next pop superstar. CocknBullKid
Anita Blay has spent the last year or so writing for other artists (including Neon Jungle, whose ‘Trouble’ she invented with Fear Of Tigers’ Ben Berry). She’s starting work on her second album in January, so we’d expect to hear stuff by the end of the year. David Guetta
Expect one or two low-key guest vocalists. Ella Eyre
As well as being the only singer on the BBC Sound poll longlist to be named after a line from a Rihanna song, Ella Eyre has some pretty good songs up her sleeve. Ella Henderson
This will be a fairly big deal. Confirmed col­lab­or­at­ors include Claude Kelly, TMS, Salaam Remi and Babyface among many others. Elyar Fox
We haven’t heard anything truly incred­ible by this fella yet but it’s still early days right? Right?? Example
Stuart Price has been working on this so there will probably be some really good bits. Florence '+' The Machine
It's already over two years since 'Ceremonials' came out, so Florence could do with pulling her finger out. (A recent thing in Q magazine said she'd been working with MNEK.) Florrie
Any album that includes this… …can’t help but be brilliant. Foxes
This is going to be one of those “oh actually she’s released loads of immensely brilliant music without me really joining the dots and oh look here’s some more” albums, so expect it to be a bit of a word-of-mouth success. Fryars
This'll be listen­able. Iggy Azalea
This'll also be listen­able. Janet Jackson
There are uncon­firmed reports that Janet has been in the studio working on her first album in over half a decade. We’ll take that as a ‘definite Q4 2014’ then, thanks Janet. Jennifer Lopez
There will be an album in 2014. Jessie Ware
There is no way this album will be rubbish. Joel Compass
Joel  is one of the most notable excep­tions from this year’s BBC Sound poll. He’s one of a handful of artists (Mikky Ekko being another) whose profile has been building during 2013 in Hype Machine-friendly areas, but (so?) hasn’t yet revealed exactly why he’s a proper popstar. We have it on pretty reliable authority that there’s huge stuff to come, so hopefully his absence from the Sound Of list takes the pressure off the whole ‘let’s keep taste­m­akers happy’ side of things and will just allow him to get on with being a pop thing. Katy B
We’re already a couple of songs into this album campaign and both of those are brilliant, so Katy could be in proper ‘albums of the year’ territory by the time hers comes out. Kelis
We’re probably in ‘one good single, a load of nonsense and a Lovebox appear­ance’ territory at this point in Kelis’ career but that’s good enough for us. Ki Fitzgerald
This could be one of the more unusual albums of 2013: Ki writes for people like Lawson but he's also been working with RedOne on an album that has an operatic EDM (?!) feel. Kids Of The Apocalypse
The Sound Of Arrows album was a mas­ter­piece so the KOTA one should be too. Kylie
Kylie’s currently working on her first album since signing with Roc Nation. As you know, ‘Skirt’ has already come out and was a bit of a strange affair. This album could be a disaster or a triumph (actually, it could very easily be a bit of a both). Either way we're really looking forward to hearing it, and Kylie herself seems pretty happy with her Sia work. La Roux
This album is even more overdue than Beyoncé’s. As you'll recall, Elly debuted new tracks in March this year, which seemed to suggest a summer or autumn release, but nothing came. Even if they (is it a 'they' any more?) get this album out in the spring of 2014 it will have been half a decade since debut album 'La Roux'. Something has clearly gone very wrong in the last few years but we hope a second La Roux album does mater­i­al­ise because the first was a triumph from beginning to end. Lady Gaga
Gaga's already been talking up a second instal­ment of 'ARTPOP'. Strangely, we're already more excited about this second set of songs than we were about the first. Maybe it's  because the last time Gaga added an extra album to an existing release it was 'The Fame Monster' which as we all know is one of the best albums of the modern pop era. Lana Del Rey
Once she's finished fucking around with all this short film nonsense we’ll be expecting a single from Lana in the spring, then a second single into the album during the autumn. This is based on complete guesswork but if you’ve got this far into the list we assume you’re no stranger to the world of spec­u­la­tion. Le Youth
'Cool' was a certified banger; 'Dance With Me' is just as splendid. And there's a whole album of the stuff coming in 2014.  Lea Michele
The Glee 'actress' has a Sia-written first single due out any day now; the album’s out at the start of 2014 and will probably contain three great songs and a load of old shit, but ‘three great songs and a load of old shit’ is more than a lot of artists manage so we’ll take our chances. Leona Lewis
Once this year's Christmas malarkey is out of the year Leona can con­cen­trate on her next album, which she already says will have a Motown feel. Lewis Hamilton
We first heard rumours of this a few years ago. Could it finally see the light of say in 2014? Earlier this year we asked Lewis' then-girl­friend Nicole Scherzinger how good it was out of ten and she said ""Well, I’m his girl­friend and I support him so I’m going to give him a ten"", which didn't bode very well, be she also said ""I think people will be pleas­antly surprised"", so all is not com­pletely lost. (This album will probably be terrible, let's be honest, but it will at least be enter­tain­ing.) Lily Allen
At one point Lily said she’d be back in Q1 2014, then she went and released two singles in Q4 2013, so it’s fair to say this woman is not to be trusted. Even so, a 2014 album release seems inev­it­able. We reckon there’ll be a proper Lily single in February (‘Hard Out Here’ felt more like a counter to the John Lewis ad than a ‘proper’ single), then an album in March/April. Little Mix
Sometimes it feels a bit unfair on pop acts when they’re trapped in a ‘you must release one album per year until the whole thing’s over’ routine, but this year’s second album was extraordin­ar­ily good and their third — which we reckon must be due next November — could be their ‘Chemistry’. Yes we went there. Madeon
We don’t know that he’s def­in­itely making an album but it’s unlikely he’s not making an album, right? (This could be a con­tem­por­ary classic.) Margaret Berger
Likely to be one of those ‘greatest albums of the year but not released in the UK so nobody really goes on about it that much which is a shame’ releases. Mariah Carey
Hm… Marina & The Diamonds
Marina’s second album was the best of 2012 and her third could be the best of 2014. Mark Feehily
The former Westlife warbler could be the stool-obsessed boyband evacuee with the most inter­est­ing solo career, which might not seem like much in light of Shane Filan’s solo effort, but we still reckon Mark has a few surprises up his sleeve.  McBusted
At the McBusted press con­fer­ence we asked them if there was any new music on the horizon and they all went “no there’s just the tour for now” and to be frank readers we almost shouted “OH WHAT COMPLETE HORSESHIT” because you don’t book in an arena tour if you’re not going to flog something off the back of it, do you? So we reckon there are three options here: either there’s a ‘McBusted Perform The Hits Of McFly And Busted’ studio album released around the tour featuring re-recorded versions of their greatest hits, or there’s a ‘McBusted Doing Some New Songs They’ve Written Together On Tour’ album in the autumn, OR the whole thing is used to somehow launch a new Busted-on-their-own album for Q4. Mikky Ekko
His debut album will feature col­lab­or­a­tions with Ariel Rechtshaid and Greg Kurstin, among others. MNEK
This will be good. MØ
We’re already giving this one a 6/10 despite not having heard it. Monsieur Adi
One of our favourite remixers also makes music of his own. We've heard some bits of what's to come and there are some very exciting tunes on the way. Mutya Keisha Siobhan
The momentum has sort of fallen out of this whole project but as soon as you hear what the band spent the last two and a half years working on you will go bloody mental. This is a really excellent album and it deserves an audience. Neon Jungle
It will be nice to hear a ballad from this lot. Nick Gardner
This chap is a Proper Popstar, and after recording a load of YouTube covers he’s signed to Interscope. He’s off on tour with Gavin Degraw next spring but don’t let that put you off. Nicki Minaj
The last album was a bit confusing so we’re crossing our fingers for a 2014 release that’s either Proper Rap or Proper Pop (followed eight months later by an album that’s either Proper Pop or Proper Rap). Nicola Roberts
Amazing. Nina Persson
The former Cardigan's album is called 'Animal Heart' and it's out in February. The first song from it was quite good. No Doubt
Four words: Greg. Kurstin. Is. Producing. One Direction
We ori­gin­ally thought that One Direction might have a year off from the album cycle in 2014, but it would be strange for them to go off on a stadium tour without having something new to flog. Paloma Faith
She recently revealed that she was working with Pharrell and Stargate, among others. The new album will, appar­ently, be less emo than previous releases. (We quite Paloma being emo but we also quite like the idea of her being a bit more danceable.) Patrick Wolf
Life always feels a bit better when there’s a new Patrick Wolf album on the horizon. He recently tweeted from the studio, men­tion­ing in an interview — when asked about new material — that he’s reached a new sense of clarity. Pharrell
One would imagine this will have some pretty decent tunes — and some pretty exciting guest appear­ances — on it. Pixie Lott
The second album was mostly drivel but you’d hope for between three and four decent songs on this one, given that her career depends on it. Porcelain Black
This RedOne protégé kind of seems stuck in devel­op­ment limbo at the moment, but some of the tunes that emerged earlier this year point to a great album. Porter Robinson
We’re really looking forward to this one. If you follow Porter on Twitter you’ll know that the way he describes his rela­tion­ship with music, and the way he analyses his thoughts in the studio, point to a really inter­est­ing and exciting ‘LP’. Professor Green
The new 'Pro' Green album was supposed to come out in 2013 and if the first couple of singles had set the charts on fire it might well be out by now. The good news is that he can spend a bit more time adding new songs, although we heard some of it during the summer and it already sounded great. Queen Of Hearts
This will be a good one. Rihanna
The Eminem col­lab­or­a­tion meant that Rihanna didn’t com­pletely let us down in Q4, but there should have been an album. Could she have one out in the spring, or will she wait until the winter? And when it does come, will it be a Greatest Hits or a full album? Look we don’t know, we’re just listing artist names and waffling a bit. Rita Ora
It will be inter­est­ing to see where Rita goes with her second album. Hopefully the answer isn’t ‘the dumper’, she's quite a good popstar with the wind behind her. Robyn
The good but also slightly ter­ri­fy­ing thing about knowing Robyn is working on material, and that she has been for some time, is that she is the sort of artist who could just drop a single at any time. In fact, she's the sort of artist who could drop three albums at any time. It might come on January 1, it might come on December 31, but new Robyn music will happen in 2014 and if it's rubbish we might as well all just give up and go home because would any of us want to live or work in a world where Robyn wasn't deliv­er­ing the goods? Sam Smith
The new single is extremely good, if you like that kind of thing. SANDÉ
This has to be a Q4 banker for Virgin/EMI or whatever they're called by then. And while it might feel like Emeli Sandé has never really been away, 'Our Version Of Events' came out at the start of 2012, so that'll be a two-and-a-half year gap by the time the end of 2014 rolls around. Brace yourselves. Say Lou Lou
This is likely to be one of the five best albums of 2014. Even if it just contains the singles so far and six record­ings of people being sick into buckets it’ll be in the Top 10. Shakira
In 2013 we’ve all spent so long moaning about Beyoncé’s tardiness that most of us forgot that another Proper Global Superstar must also be on the verge of releasing an album. This one’s been a long time coming but we’re really excited. We're not sure of an album release date, but the first single is coming far sooner than you're probably expecting. Sia
It would be funny if she just got loads of other writers to give her songs for this, wouldn't it. (That's not happening.) We’d expect this album to come in the first third of 2014. ‘T1’ if you will. Likely to be Album of The Year material. Scissor Sisters in some shape or form
Jake? Ana? Babydaddy? Del? Any of those four could release a great solo album in 2014. Solange
Alert the ‘blo­go­sphere’! Sophie Ellis-Bextor
'Wanderlust' is out in January. The artwork's nice. Tove Lo
Another Album Of The Year contender, we'd imagine. 'Out Of Mind' was very good indeed. Take That
Alert your mum!  Tamera Foster
Single in February, album in March please. Let's not mess around. Tanika
‘Bad 4 U’ is such a tune. Imagine a whole album of stuff like this. YES PLEASE. Taylor Swift
Hopefully she’ll let Max Martin help out on the whole thing this time. The Vamps
Their second single is really good. The Veronicas
Twelve ‘4ever’s would be just fine. Usher
This is due in May. Will Young
After a decade with RCA, Will signed to Island earlier this year. As you well know, his last album 'Echoes' was extremely brilliant, so it stands to reason that this one will be too. (Anyone who has followed pop music for more than 18 months will obviously know that ‘it stands to reason’ is a phrase that has no place what­so­ever when it comes to pre­dict­ing album con­sist­ency but we trust Will on this one.) YYZ
We love YYZ. Since we last wrote about them they’ve signed to Universal and made this video. An album of those would be just super. There's going to be loads of amazing music released in 2014. If we've missed anything send us an email, and if none of this excites you fear not — there’s a U2 album coming in the spring.

SO WRONG. SO WRONG IT HURTS. Get your listening gear around this. It's the entire EP — four tracks long, as all proper EPs should be — in a series of Soundcloud players.     It is the work of a lady called Betty Who. Here's a picture of Betty Who. (We don't know if she's in the middle of getting dressed, or if she's in the middle of getting undressed, or if this is in fact 'the finished article' but if it's the latter we hope she's going to put on a jumper before she goes out.)

The land that gave us Kylie, just one of the various artistes we'd love to hear recording songs like this. 1. The afore­men­tioned Kylie Minogue
2. Dannii would probably give it a decent go as well to be honest
3. The Saturdays

5. Basically everyone But those acts are not recording these songs. Betty Who is. And if you're a fan of moving images, you are in luck: the EP's lead track, 'Somebody Loves You', has had a video knocking around for a while… …although the first time we saw Betty mentioned was on the Popjustice forum, where she popped up last October. Let's have another listen of that EP shall we.     Incredible. If you'd like to own the EP, in as much as any of us can really 'own' something as magical as Decent Pop Music, you are, again, in luck.

69,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/briefing/catrin-from-dusky-grey-thinks-that-if-youre-the-best-version-of-yourself-life-is-much-more-fun/,"“We’ve been doing a tonne of writing sessions and we’ve got loads of songs,” Catrin out of Dusky Grey says when we call her for a chat. “Now it’s just a question of releasing them.” She and Gethin are off to a good start today with the release of new single Joy Ride which, in common with a lot of Dusky Grey’s tunes, is “about being young, having fun and growing up, and all the tribu­la­tions that come with it”. In the song’s video the band race around a carpark in shopping trolleys, which has clear health and safety rami­fic­a­tions that Catrin doesn’t seem to have fully con­sidered. “We are running around quite quickly,” she admits. “We wrote the song about being at a house party growing up,"" she adds, ""and the way everyone tries to fit in, and tries to conform to peer pressure and do things they normally wouldn’t want to do, to look cooler than they are.” And this is why, you see, the video shows people being com­pet­it­ive (with shopping trolleys) then realising they have a lot more fun when they just do their own thing. “You should always be yourself even if it’s difficult,” Catrin says. “And sometimes it is difficult. But if you’re the best version of yourself life is much more fun.” Very nice but let’s go back to those shopping trolleys. Has Catrin ever nicked one in real life? “I’ve borrowed one,” she begins. “But I put it back.” Further prodding reveals that when Catrin 'borrowed' the shopping trolley she didn’t even leave the carpark, but perhaps the most tragic part of the whole sorry tale is that she hadn’t even been drinking. One evening she simply thought it would be fun to push a friend round a carpark. “You know what it’s like when you live in the coun­tryside,” is Catrin's defence. “All you can do is hang out in parks and carparks.”  She can’t choose a favourite between parks and carparks: each has its own set of dangers. It’s swings and round­abouts, we say. QUITE LITERALLY! Because you get swings in parks and, very often, round­abouts in carparks. It’s a great joke, and we both laugh.

71,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/briefing/charli-xcxs-new-video-uses-deepfake-technology-of-course-it-does/,"The Verge report that as well as being a jamboree of nostalgia-baiting obvi­ous­ness, there's something not quite so hit-you-round-the-head going on in the video for Charli XCX's Troye Sivan col­lab­or­a­tion 1999. Namely: the shot of Charli as all five Spice Girls isn't your standard CGI creation — rather than being a composite of five separate Charlis dressed as each of the five Spice Girls, the shot's actually based on Charli and four dancers, and deepfake tech­no­logy has been used to graft Charli's face on to the others. It seems like using deepfake's AI-powered jiggery-pokery rather than more tra­di­tional CGI is partly to do with prac­tic­al­ity and partly (large, we'd guess) to do with showing off. As the video's director Ryan Staake tells The Verge: “When you start to think about the com­plex­ity of getting them in and out of wardrobe and makeup for each of those char­ac­ters, it would take five times longer. So in a way, it was a pragmatic solution. But then, we also started playing off the bizar­re­ness and aes­thet­ics of it. It’s one of those things where part of the excite­ment is just trying to see if it works. Like, can we use this weird fake celeb porn tool in a legit music video?” As you'll see from the Charli video the results are often a bit wonky looking, but that's an aesthetic that fits in quite well with where Charli's at sonically on a lot of her more recent mixtape work: sounds a bit wrong but wow tech­no­logy, etc etc. ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912205534.99/warc/CC-MAIN-20190326135436-20190326161436-00346.warc.gz
72,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/briefing/clean-bandit-and-zara-larssons-symphony-is-a-new-song-about-songs-and-its-a-good-one/," It's become something of a tradition for us to go a bit berserk about new Clean Bandit singles. In uncertain times we all need something to cling to and in the world of pop things don't come much more rock solid than the sense that Clean Bandit really do know what they're doing. 'Symphony', which is out next Friday and features Zara Larsson, makes it three-for-three on our Clean Bandit single triumph spread­sheet. This new single doesn't scale the heights of ridicu­lous­ness showcased in 'Rockabye' — which is to say it doesn't feature Sean Paul popping up to shout things like ""DAILY STRUGGLE!"" all over the place — and nor does it quite exhibit the tears-in-the-toilets melodrama of 'Tears', but it combines the euphoria of the first and the start-like-a-ballad-end-like-a-banger MO of the latter. Like the best Clean Bandit songs it fits in perfectly on a modern playlist, but it doesn't sound like it's bending over backwards to do so. Also, yet again we find the song bit of the song front and centre. People tend to be quite dis­missive of the song bits of songs, don't they? ""This is a great track,"" they'll say when they've knocked some sounds together. ""Just needs a topline."" (The song's great except for the fact that it doesn't have a song bit in it yet — well done everyone.) ""Send this out to topliners,"" they'll instruct their A&Rs, something of an Elves & The Shoemaker-style situation but one in which the team of magical song­writ­ing gnomes who'll turn a hot track into a hit song are regarded as a necessary evil and little more than an after­thought. Maybe some track producers resent the depend­ency they have on song­writers; that would certainly explain why so many of them seem to vin­dict­ively remove choruses in favour of massive drops. Anyway, no such problems with 'The Bandit'. Not only is 'Symphony' one of the songier songs you'll find in the charts over the coming months but even better this song — like some of the very best songs — is a song about songs. During the course of 'Symphony' Zara rhymes ""I've been hearing sym­phon­ies, before all I heard was silence"" with ""a rhapsody for you and me, and every melody is timeless"", sings ""your song is on repeat, and I'm dancing on to your heartbeat"" and, for the chorus, belts out: ""I just want to be part of your symphony — will you hold me tight and not let go? Symphony: like a love song on the radio."" The song last for three minutes and thirty two seconds. It comes at a pretty good time for Zara Larsson, who's on the verge of releasing her new album. As is befitting one of pop's best new voices that album contains some pretty good tracks (par­tic­u­larly the extraordin­ary Rihanna-esque semibal­lad 'Only You') but on the singles front she seems to have been suffering from dimin­ish­ing returns since 'Lush Life'. The problem has been par­tic­u­larly acute in the case of her album's iffy, iffily-titled title track 'So Good' — an ill-advised single choice that sounds like track three from the sampler for an unre­leased album by an early-2000s UK Sony signing. It limped to Number 44 in the charts and didn't react on Spotify, which isn't exactly a great launchpad for an album release. 'Symphony' should neut­ral­ise that problem for Zara; for Clean Bandit it's the third massive single in a row and they haven't even announced their own album yet. Well done all.

It's approach­ing 5m Spotify plays, which isn't bad is it, and its video premieres above, but what's exciting here is that we've had a listen to what's likely to be the band's next single and there seems to be something quite exciting happening here. We've asked the band some questions, which you can read — with responses, arranged in the format of what one might loosely term 'an interview' — below. What’s going on in this video then? It doesn’t seem very big on LOLs. 
We wrote the song about someone cheating within a rela­tion­ship — we couldn't find the joke either. 1 You’re not in the video are you? (Or are you?) Why aren’t you in your video?
We have faces for radio.  We're in renov­a­tion right now.  The actors did a great job though, we couldn't have done any better.  Your potential next single’s even better than this one, are your songs going to keep getting better with each release and if not when are they likely to plateau?
We're always striving to do better than what we've pre­vi­ously done.  We wrote 'Told Me' together in one day when we weren't a band, now that we're spending every day together our writing is improving — at least we hope so, our mams think so. You’ve done quite a good job of getting old music off the internet. Was it any good? How was it different from what you’re up to now?
If it was any good it would still be up there. Just kidding — a lot has changed, we have a direction we're wanting to go with musically right now and that's what we want people to focus on for the time being. Which other band’s fanbase would most neatly trans­ition to Dusky Grey fans if that other band dra­mat­ic­ally quit music or were in a severe but non-lethal accident?
We'll take any fans that we can get and hope that nobody gets hurt in the process. How will your debut album shape and alter the dreams and realities of a gen­er­a­tion?
If we're able to inspire one person it would mean the world to us.  If we can't inspire anyone, the least we can do is make the album good enough for people to listen to on the drive to their own dreams. We consider ourselves to be so extremely normal, so if we're able to make an album believe us when we say anyone can. This would usually have been the part where an interview became slightly awkward — for­tu­nately they were answering questions over email.↩ ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912203548.81/warc/CC-MAIN-20190325031213-20190325053213-00042.warc.gz

78,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/briefing/fleur-easts-moment-of-triumph/," With her per­form­ance of 'Sax' on last night's X Factor results show Fleur East delivered what was probably the show's most exciting ever alumni launch per­form­ance, and it def­in­itely contains the best one-second moment in recent pop TV history. That moment is all about the look Fleur gives just after she's launched herself backwards off a platform by the judges' desk, performed an assisted reverse somer­sault, and tossed back her gar­gan­tuan hair. It's a look that says: ""Right. I've done it.""  There are two ways of reading this look. First, there's the practical element: if you've just pulled off that move on live tele­vi­sion without shitting yourself or dropping the mic, you're doing pretty well. Second, there's the actual mic drop element of what's just happened: Fleur East has worked for a decade to get here. It's all gone wrong on more than one occasion. But she's made it work and now — as of right this moment — it's finally happening. As you know, Fleur first appeared on The X Factor in 2005, as one third of Addictiv Ladies. Addictiv Ladies weren't very good, and they went out in the first week of that year's live finals. Fleur was 17. We tend to judge artists on the decisions they make when things are going well, but you can often judge a popstar better by how they behave when things go wrong. When Addictiv Ladies fell apart, Fleur wasn't ready to give up. But she also wasn't a bloody idiot. It's inter­est­ing and not insig­ni­fic­ant that when she went to uni­ver­sity she chose to study journ­al­ism and con­tem­por­ary history: we met Fleur for the first time a couple of months ago and what we found (apart from the fact that she's as exciting just sitting down and having a chat as she is when she's standing in front of a wind machine with fireworks going off) was that she clearly has an interest in the world around her, and a com­pul­sion to ask questions. Qualities infuri­at­ingly rare in the self-obsessed world of the average pop artiste. Anyway Fleur went to uni­ver­sity and got her degree, but she didn't give up singing and per­form­ing. There was another girlband, and a couple of spinoff solo releases. She became a session vocalist and live singer for people like DJ Fresh, and at one point chucked all her savings at releasing her own EP. (Most of this stuff is still online; some of it's pretty good.) The point is that where a lot of artists wait for good things to happen to them, but Fleur was doing everything she could to make it happen. There's more to Fleur's rise than just the easy route of turning up one day at an X Factor audition, just like 'Sax' itself is smarter than you might imagine — you'd never guess from all the 'this sounds like Uptown Funk' comments on social media, but while the Mark Ronson song was obviously on the brief sent out to producers, the song runs for a full minute before anything sounds at all like 'Uptown Funk'. And that's a pretty amazing minute. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBRH4mFODwM Fleur's per­form­ance couldn't have come at a better time for The X Factor, after Saturday's news that The Voice would be moving to ITV and that The X Factor's days on ter­restrial TV could therefore be numbered (although we're not convinced ITV wouldn't find room for both). The show's sig­ni­fic­ance seemed par­tic­u­larly pre­cari­ous after last year's winner Ben Haenow trotted out such a mediocre per­form­ance of such an under­whelm­ing launch single the other week. If Ben Haenow is the best the show has to offer, what's the point? But when we accept the sometimes com­pel­ling narrative sur­round­ing The X Factor's demise (the viewing figures are down, the audition stages are boring, there's an inev­it­able sense after over a decade that we've seen this all before) we forget — until someone like Fleur comes along — that the show really can deliver superstar per­formers. And a pop moment like Fleur's 'Sax' per­form­ance just would not exist without The X Factor. This is partly The X Factor's fault — along with Popstars and Pop Idol it was, for a while, so suc­cess­ful at pro­pelling so many acts into the charts that big, immediate impact pop launches were effect­ively out of bounds for major labels unless there was a big TV platform, and labels therefore backed away from big pop launches. This left all the power in the hands of The X Factor. Which was fine in theory, but the reality is that when you're leaving so many decisions to the producers of a light enter­tain­ment show and an audience whose voting decisions are fre­quently just wrong, rel­at­ively few actual pop super­stars have been created by the show. And of course because the labels had decided to back away, the UK ended up producing rel­at­ively few actual pop super­stars full stop. It hasn't all been bad news. Pop was forced to find a new way to express itself, so we have inter­est­ing acts who've found their way to fame and success through a more leftfield approach. So you've got your Charlis and Marinas and Lordes and Ellies and people who've managed to engage taste­m­akers and bloggers and come in through the back door. More recently, we've seen the music industry back itself into another cul-de-sac: just like they decided you couldn't launch an act without a big TV platform, labels (partly due to radio nonsense) have decided that you can't launch an act without landing them a guest vocal on a dance track. It works if you're Sam Smith or Jess Glynne, but there's such a huge backlog of featured vocalists each waiting for their 'solo moment' that pop just can't support everyone. A clever marketing idea three years ago is a straight­jacket in 2015. And again, you're relying on taste­m­akers to 'approve' an act before the public get to hear them. Basically, you wouldn't get many of that lot launching them­selves into backflips, or doing the whole ""HOLD TIGHT — LEAN BACK!"" thing with fifteen dancers.  The camera was on Fleur — how could it not have been — when she back­flipped and stared out over the crowd last night, taking that short moment to soak up what had happened to her, and what she'd made happen. But if the camera had been on Simon Cowell we might have seen a similar look of triumph. He usually seems to have a bit of a look of triumph on his face, to be honest, but this time it would have been com­pletely justified: it's moments like this that make all the nonsense seem worth­while.

79,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/briefing/flyposterwatch-years-years-the-1975-james-bay/,"There is no sight more mag­ni­fi­cent, no pop glory higher than a nicely presented array of pop-related fly­po­sters. ""There's something cultural happening!"" it says. ""Here's a slightly illegal and therefore politely anarchic advert­ise­ment for it."" And there's a real treat happening right now at the inter­est­ing end of Kensington High Street. Non-industry wankers might not realise this but all three of the UK's major record labels live on the same street: Sony and Warner Music are at one end, where the decent shops are, with Universal situated a not-quite-worth-a-bus-but-too-far-to-enjoyably-walk distance down the road, where the most exciting shop is a Screwfix. But Universal is also nearer than the other labels to Westfield, so it's swings and round­abouts. Let's take a closer look at what's on offer.  Olly's nose ring almost forms a comma in the band name. While we applaud Years & Years' con­sist­ent use of an ampersand — an punc­tu­ational arrange­ment with which some bands would play fast and loose between campaigns, creating a sense of dis­or­i­ent­a­tion in fans and anger among others — one can't help wondering if Years, and years, while being the same band name, might actually be a better band name. In this poster Years & Years are keen to impress upon us the urgency of their message: there's no 'the' before 'brand new single'. This is purely inform­a­tional. New stuff out now, take it or leave it. Title, format, avail­ab­il­ity, bang, bang, bang. This actually shows a great sense of con­fid­ence on the band's part. They don't need to make this release seem more monu­mental by adding a 'the'. They don't need to tell you where to get it or listen to it. All they need to do for the world to lose its shit is announce this new song's existence. Let's be honest here ladies and gents, The 1975's Music For Cars campaign is already a total visual triumph. There are loads of these posters up around the UK's major cities, and they all look abso­lutely brilliant. The most exciting thing here is the 2018—2019 timeline top right: they're already estab­lish­ing the para­met­ers of their own album era. Who does this? Nobody! They've got this whole thing planned out already. (Which is even more impress­ive when you consider that they announced the album's title last April, before their last album campaign was even over, and actually stuck with that title. Again — who does this?) Phwoar right? What a band. In some ways this is actually the reverse of the Years & Years poster. There's a 'the', for a start: this is a big deal! It's what you've been waiting for! This isn't just any new album. It's the new album. It's the new album by James Bay and everyone's talking about it. THE THE THE. What you'll also see here is that while Years & Years didn't ask anything of the person seeing their poster — brand new single out now, do what you want with this info — with James Bay there's an Apple Music button on the bottom. (Obviously we tapped it and nothing happened so we're not sure what's happening there.) The sug­ges­tion here is that James Bay's people thought some people might see the poster and not realise that it was an advert­ise­ment, or that they were supposed to respond. ""What if they see the poster for a new album, and don't realise they're invited to listen to it?"" This is why the Apple Music logo is so important. (Interesting-not-inter­est­ing sidenote: both the James Bay posters posted in this location include the Apple Music button, but a month or so ago we noticed another music flyposter, posted twice in the same location like these have been. The two posters were identical apart from the streaming service logo at the bottom: one was Apple Music, one was Spotify. Not worth upsetting anyone, right? Except perhaps Deezer. Obviously this point would have been better if we could remember the artist or even if we'd taken a photo, but there you go. It happened, we saw it, let's not have an argument about it.) Of course the main takeaway from this James Bay poster is that like all great advert­ise­ments it invites the viewer to consider some uncom­fort­able issues and ask her or himself some important questions. In this case, the internal dialogue surely runs something like this: ""James Bay is actually quite hot now, and I suppose the truth is that James Bay was probably quite hot all along, and it was just the hat and the hair that stopped me seeing this. Am I going through life judging people on what look like before their X Factor live shows-style makeover, when really I should be seeing everybody's full potential? But also, am I currently in my ownhat-and-Jessie-J-wig era? Am I one frenzied major label styling session away from going The Full James Bay? Or have I already reached my own full potential? Is there hope for the future, or is this as good as it gets?"" ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202804.80/warc/CC-MAIN-20190323121241-20190323143241-00381.warc.gz

Anyway last night on Twitter, we made a rash statement: that 'Love Machine' is the worst Girls Aloud single that isn't a ballad.

4. Untouchable
5. No Good Advice
6. The Promise

9. Something Kinda Ooooh
10. The Show
11. Can't Speak French
12. Whole Lotta History
13. The Loving Kind
14. Wake Me Up
15. Long Hot Summer

83,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/briefing/greetings-from-liverpool-where-one-of-the-worlds-greatest-ever-bands-have-sort-of-reformed/,"Hello from a train somewhere between London and Liverpool! I thought I’d fill you in on what I’ll be doing for the next few days, partly because it looks like the four-day (sort of) pop event I’m about to attend will be something truly extraordin­ary and partly because as details start to emerge I’m starting to wonder if I’ll make it out alive. The very short explan­a­tion is that about 25 years ago The KLF — or The Justified Ancients Of Mu Mu as they were initially and are now once again known — were a band whose huge tunes were matched with really huge ideas. They split up, and now they’re back. Which doesn’t sound very exciting in itself because all bands from the olden days come back even­tu­ally even if they say they’re never going to, but this par­tic­u­lar burst of activity is exciting because it’s as elaborate, ludicrous and funny as both the music the band once made and the way they once chose to promote it. Actually maybe the music was just their way of promoting the other stuff. Either way, it was all very good. It mostly boils down to one thing: whether you can take a look at the picture below and think of any other act who'd use it as a press shot. Like, a band who'd release a single and send this out to media and go ""hiya here you go, if you're writing about us feel free to use this"".  If you missed the band's original chart career the best way to describe The KLF is: well, you remember how there was that period a few years ago when you’d have abso­lutely no idea what Lady Gaga would do next, or how, or when, or even why? And how each thing she did felt like it was impossible to second guess, as well as being quite brilliant? Well you’d be halfway there if you were to combine all that with the way Daft Punk built a world around and through their music, the way Lana Del Rey created an is-she-actually-for-real myth around her existence, the way PC Music seems to involve artists who don’t even really exist and in whose music and imagery no idea is con­sidered too ridicu­lous, and the way Arcade Fire decided to promote their new album. And if you combined all those artists' music. But you really would only be halfway there.     Look, some of it’s got to do with the fact that they were my favourite band when I was twelve. And some of it’s got to do with the fact that a KLF fanzine I did when I was 15 is almost entirely respons­ible for the last 22 years of so-called music journ­al­ism. But it’s still quite exciting in its own right, right? I’m in Liverpool now by the way, I ended up having a sleep on the train. But here’s why I’m in Liverpool, and here’s what might happen over the next few days.    (During the regis­tra­tion process I went for option four from the above list because that is just the kind of guy I am.) Oh, and there's merch. THERE IS DEFINITELY MERCH. (In a move that echoes the best ever joke about Prince mer­chand­ise stands everything costs £20.23 because the JAMs book is called 2023, do you see.)  And yes. Yes I know what you are thinking. Yes in one sense we have all paid £100 to attend a book launch that spans five days. But at the same time: a) Bros were charging £150 for a decent ticket to their O2 shows at the weekend. Those shows went on for con­sid­er­ably less than five days and were frankly 'not great'. b) Don’t tell me this whole thing doesn’t sound, at the very least, extremely amusing. c) Seriously though guys WHAT A FUCKING BAND.

88,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/briefing/here-are-five-reasons-why-pet-shop-boys-electric-is-their-best-album-since-very/," There's a pattern to 21st century Pet Shop Boys releases that runs like so: Not only is this probably quite frus­trat­ing, it can also make it difficult for the casual observer to detect whether the latest album really is a 'return to form' or just an excuse for journo types to wax nostalgic about how amazing the band were in the 80s and 90s. For the benefit of these readers, let me break it down for you: 'Electric' is the best Pet Shop Boys album since 'Very', which everybody knows is the best Pet Shop Boys album ever.  Here's why: Because of the Price con­nec­tion many people have compared 'Electric' to Madonna's 'Confessions On A Dancefloor', but it's actually closer to Pet Shop Boys' own extremely brilliant 'Introspective'; an all-floor­filler, no-filler col­lec­tion of feature-length tunes. Let's face it, only one other recording artist would record a song called 'Love Is A Bourgeois Construct' in 2013, and that artist is Johnny Borrell. But would the (the­or­et­ical) Borrell version be a titanic 'Go West'-esque kiss-off with a hook borrowed from a 17th century opera but appar­ently played on a Bontempi organ? Pop 1–0 Indie. Last year's 'Elysium' wasn't as bad as all that, but a few too many songs about old age, death and the vapidity of modern pop stars made it a bit of a world-weary slog. Not to mention that one about the Olympics. 'Electric', by com­par­ison, is almost entirely devoted to songs about clubbing. I don't even like clubbing, but the lack of bit­ter­ness and complete absence of ballads leads to the most carefree PSB listen for years. Welcome back to the party boys. Singing about clubbing when you're 'getting on a bit' can be risky territory. Get it wrong and you're basically post-2005 Madonna — wild-eyed, legs akimbo, des­per­a­tion for relevance dripping from every pore. Thankfully at no point on this album does Neil sound like he's going to lurch up to you at the bar and start giving it a bit of Big Fish Little Fish Cardboard Box. Detached, effort­less and imperious, his vocals demon­strate his hipness, rather than insisting on it. Whether it'll actually become one is debatable, but with a classic house piano, a walloping chorus, the best Chris Lowe chant since 'Paninaro' and a shock­ingly non-horrid cameo from Example, it's both classic Pet Shop Boys and — thanks to the ongoing revival of the 90s dance sound that they helped pioneer the first time round — con­vin­cingly 2013.  So there you have it. Post-'Very' albums 'Bilingual', 'Nightlife', 'Release', 'Fundamental', 'Yes' and 'Elysium' all had some incred­ible moments, but were all weighed down by the inclusion of some right old toot. At a brisk nine tracks long, 'Electric' is 100% toot-free; therefore it is their best album in 20 years. Not hyperbole, just simple logic. Purchase with con­fid­ence.

89,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/briefing/heres-how-robots-could-replace-all-popstars-by-october-11/," This week a story from last year has bubbled back to the top of the pop agenda — the long and short of it is that Spotify seem to have playl­is­ted dozens of original pieces of music which have been created under various pseud­onyms. Somewhat bizarrely many of these appear to have been created by producers Quiz and Larossi. There's more on it over at Music Business Worldwide. But let's take this all one step further. Let's say that rather than Quiz and Larossi being com­mis­sioned to make music, we take writers, producers and actual artists out of the equation all together. Virtual popstars have been toyed with for decades. Gorillaz, The Archies and Hatsune Miku worked; Conor Maynard has enjoyed a lengthy career with nobody sus­pect­ing a thing. For each of these there are dozens of failures, including early-2000s ideas such as solo popstar Kukani, the brainchild of East 17/Pet Shop Boys manager Tom Watkins. Most of the failures hit a wall due to time and expense. But what if you didn't need to involve humans, or concepts like time and money, at all? What if, in 2017's world of AI, infinite pos­sib­il­it­ies and low computing costs, you could create the next big pop smash at the touch of a button? Or without having to even touch a button at all? What we are about to propose requires a few things to be true: we need AI to have become so powerful that in a matter of seconds robots are able to throw millions of possible solutions at one idea until they get a right answer, we need arti­fi­cially created vocals to be as decent as arti­fi­cially created instru­ments, we need AI to have already had a bash at song­writ­ing, and we need to know what humans enjoy listening to. Those things are pretty much all in place though, right? Right. Let's go.   It doesn't stop there. Our four easy steps are followed by the robots once a day. Every day. By the end of week one the robots have learned a little bit about which of their 8,000 songs are getting traction. In fact, by the end of week two, the robots have learned so much that it's not just ten songs that make the cut — it's twenty. By the end of the first month, every single one of the robots' 8,000 songs is worthy of being enjoyed by human beings. They have a 100% hit rate. At this point the robots can up their game: by month two they are releasing 100,000 new songs, each worthy of human attention, onto Spotify. The memory of those original, day one, 100 sig­ni­fic­ant songs is long gone: the robots are now creating songs based on the songs they them­selves have created.  By the start of month two, human beings have totally fallen out of the AI equation. The songs created by robots aren't just passable, they're better than anything the world's greatest song­writers, producers or vocalists could manage. Songs released by humans are lost in the deluge. Genuine actual popstars are beginning to be seen in the way we currently see vinyl: a deluxe minority interest obsessed over by authen­ti­city fet­ish­ists but seen as clunky and overly-com­plic­ated by everyone else. Any popstar who got in before the robots took over will be able to continue touring, but nobody will listen to their music, a bit like U2. New artists don't stand a chance. Within three months humans listening to Spotify will no longer create playlists to keep track of their favourite songs because the robots have continued to learn: you won't want to listen to an old song any more, because you'll know that the song being released in the next two seconds is better than anything you've ever heard before. In fact, there will be ten songs released in the next two seconds, and they'll all be better than anything you've ever heard. Listening to music ceases to be enjoyable: you know will never hear the best song ever made, because while you think they're listening to it another one that's even better will have appeared on Spotify. That's your three-month plan. If the robots get started today we could hit our target by October 11. If you're a human popstar with any songs lying around you've got twelve weeks to release them. UPDATE: Maybe this idea isn't totally ludicrous. Music Business Worldwide are now reporting that Spotify have hired François Pachet, ""one of the world’s foremost experts on the applic­a­tion of Artificial Intelligence in the world of popular music"". In his previous role at Sony, François' team were respons­ible for the AI 'Beatles' song we linked to above.

The common denom­in­ator is LA-based song­writer and now pop entity in her own right Delacey, whose new Ido Smishlany-produced single My Man is a) a really fresh pop tune and b) out and about as of right this very moment, following this evening's Annie Mac Hottest Record spin. ""I hope you feel like you know me when you hear this song,"" Delacey told Annie, ""and that you still like me after."" Delacey's bio blurb covers all the usual areas — ""lyrical rawness"" and ""toughness and vul­ner­ab­il­ity"" for instance, with the oblig­at­ory reference to ""ethereal, yet soulful vocals"" thrown in for good measure. But judging by the lyrics of My Man, Delacey seems like the sort of artist who'll make most sense when she tells her own story in her own words. Delacey describes herself as ""an endless bank of crazy things I’ve gone through""; people will connect with her music in an honest way, she hopes, adding: ""I hope that it makes them a little uncom­fort­able sometimes too.""  Billboard ran a fairly good interview with Delacey a couple of months ago; Songwriter Universe also had a chat with her last year. There'll be an EP later in the spring but for the time being My Man, a sort of post-Lana reima­gin­ing of Jolene that's being billed as Delacey's debut single, serves as a really strong intro­duc­tion to an artist whose presence could make pop a rather more pleasant place.  ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202131.54/warc/CC-MAIN-20190319203912-20190319225912-00345.warc.gz

94,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/briefing/itunes-are-now-offering-refunds-and-the-world-of-pop-might-go-totally-berserk/," It hasn't always been easy to tell just how well an artist's music is selling. For instance, those platinum, silver and gold discs you often see on popstars' walls only represent the CDs that have been sent to shops by labels, not the number of CDs actually sold. In the 1970s, one release on the Casablanca label was such a disaster that shops sent back not just unsold stock but pro­mo­tional copies too, inspiring the phrase ""shipped gold, returned platinum"". Obviously, it's fair to say Adele's platinum discs are a fair reflec­tion of sales, but that solitary silver disc on Lil' Chris' bedroom wall might be on shaky ground. In the digital world, music sales have become slightly more trans­par­ent, but this could be about to change, because as of now there seems to be a digital equi­val­ent of ""shipped gold, returned platinum"". Apparently because of some new EU consumer rights bollocks, 9to5mac report today that iTunes now offer refunds up to two weeks after music has been purchased. You won't even have to give a reason for returning your purchase. These are the updated terms: Right of can­cel­la­tion: If you choose to cancel your order you may do so within 14 days from when you received your receipt without giving any reason, except iTunes Gifts which cannot be refunded once you have redeemed the code. A lot of the coverage so far seems to be about how this will affect app developers but it works for music too and it's really mental. So for instance, having bought one of the new Madonna songs a week and a half ago, and having poten­tially enjoyed and 'used' that song ever since, we just did this…  And it's gone through.  In the olden days, if you wanted to return a CD after you'd listened to it and poten­tially ripped it or copied it in some way, you'd have to take that CD back to the shop and hand it back. Which seems fair enough. But this new rule doesn't seem to require anything of the sort. 'Unapologetic Bitch' remains on our hard drive. Maybe it will disappear in the future. Maybe we need to email the file to Tim Cook? It's all very strange. If the file stays in your library, does this new iTunes rule not mean that you could buy an album, get a refund, buy another album, get a refund, buy another album, get a refund, and repeat forever or until you've down­loaded iTunes' entire catalogue? And even if the file does even­tu­ally disappear, that still means you get two weeks' free use of an album or song. Which is great (short-term) news for fans, but a bit of a weird one for labels. Also, what does this mean for the future of chart hyping? iTunes' new rule means: 1. Union J — and it probably would be Union J — could put an album on sale on Monday morning.
2. Union J's more ambi­val­ent fans (which seems to be most of them) could buy that album during its first week on sale, knowing that they'll be able to get their money back.
3. The album would go to Number One on the Sunday.
4. The following Monday, Union J's fans could each get a full refund.
5. What are the Official Charts Company going to do? Recall the previous week's chart? Union J have a Number One album. It gets even better: 9to5 note that the 14-day period ""is extended to a year if a business fails to properly inform consumers of the return period"", which means that unless artists expli­citly tell their fans that they've got a fortnight to return purchases, fans could actually pull the rug from under an act's feet up to twelve months later. Imagine if (for instance) Lady Gaga had the biggest-selling album of 2015, then halfway through 2016 found out that once returns were taken into account she'd only sold eight copies. Those are extreme instances, of course, but labels and fanbases routinely embark on far more ludicrous attempts to get acts up the charts. In theory, though, this new ruling should ulti­mately have a positive impact on pop, and all music. If artists and labels know that consumers can and will return a rubbish album, that should mean they attempt to make better music. Mind you, we said something similar when preview clips became the norm and suddenly people were able to get an idea of what they were about to buy, and going by some of the drivel that was released this year labels are still chucking out any old nonsense. Maybe this helps partially explain the global decline in album sales — it's not that people neces­sar­ily don't want to buy music, it's just that they don't want to buy music they know will be rubbish.

95,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/briefing/jennifer-paige-singer-of-pop-behemoth-crush-almost-jacked-it-all-in-but-now-shes-back/," ""I didn't know if I ever wanted to put out a piece of music again,"" are the words being spoken down a telephone line from Nashville by Jennifer Paige, whose 1998 single 'Crush' is recog­nised by all right-minded indi­vidu­als as one of the greatest singles in the entire history of pop. ""I've always been a fighter,"" she adds, ""but I'd lost my fight."" Jennifer had followed 'Crush' with some other stuff but by the late 2000s things were looking, frankly, fucking bleak: in 2008 her mother suddenly died. Two weeks later, so did her father. In 2010 the Nashville flood washed away their home and then — JESUS CHRIST, THEN — Jennifer was diagnosed with skin cancer. It would be fair to say that back then banging out pop songs didn't seem like much of a priority. ""I was pretty much like 'screw this, this is no fun',"" Jennifer recalls. ""I'd lost all inspir­a­tion — and in my career as well, it had just got so hard. It had become a grind. It was actually a surprise to me when I found the urge to make a new album. I found my fight again."" That relocated fight is brought to life on Jennifer's new album 'Starflower'. The video for its great first single 'The Devil's In The Details', which sounds like a lady Troye Sivan singing over music off Stranger Things, is premier­ing below this paragraph. 'Starflower' is a fan-funded project and came into being after Jennifer exceeded her Kickstarter target of $35,000, which seems like a load of cash but in reality kind of isn't. ""It wasn't enough, honestly,"" she admits today. ""I thought that in today's age you can get so much done for 35 grand, but making and releasing a record is so expensive. I wasn't really prepared. I've never been the one writing all the cheques, because there's usually been some Daddy Warbucks sitting in an office somewhere. There was no Daddy Warbucks this time. It's crazy how expensive everything is when you dig in and talk about man­u­fac­tur­ing, PR and all the other things. It's like: HOLY CRAP."" Holy crap indeed. But the upside, she reckons, is that while going the fan-funded route means ""hustlin' hard"", she doesn't have to bend over backwards to appease music industry dickheads. ""It gave me the oppor­tun­ity to say what I wanted to say without having to go to labels and ask for approval,"" is how she puts it. ""I always felt this pressure with the major label system: the pressure to have one big release that just worked, and if that first single didn't work you were screwed."" Jennifer adds that with easy access to streaming platforms first singles needn't, now, dictate the fate of an entire campaign. ""These days if something doesn't work you can literally redeem yourself the following month,"" she reasons. ""And it might not mean redeeming in the com­mer­cial sense, but people who want to stay connected to you can. That's a gamechanger."" When asked how bored/10 she is of talking about 'Crush' she estimates a seven, and anything below an eight feels like fair game so we talk a bit about that song: about the acoustic version that's included on her new album (""if you don't like it you can go and listen to the original"") but also about how hard it must be to kick off your career with a song that's basically perfect. ""Then you need another perfect song,"" she laughs. ""But also, I think it worked because it was just the right song at the right time. And that can always happen again. Sometimes songs resonate with people because they know what you mean and they relate to what you're saying. And as long as you can resonate with people, you'll always have success at some level."" 'Starflower' is out on March 31, and you can pre-order it here. ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912203548.81/warc/CC-MAIN-20190325031213-20190325053213-00388.warc.gz
96,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/briefing/jess-glynnes-new-single-might-be-her-seventh-number-one-so-lets-ask-her-seven-questions/,"Jess Glynne's record-breaking tally of UK Number One singles recently hit six (SIX!) but that count will probably increase in the coming weeks because I'll Be There is a right old stormer for reasons including but not limited to: it sitting somewhere in the magical area between banger and ballad, its message of support and inspir­a­tion and pos­it­iv­ity etc etc, its semi-yodelled chorus, it just generally being a very robust and instantly enjoyable 'pop' 'thing'. Anyway we got her on the phone earlier today and there was a bit of a false start because she had to run into a polling station to vote, but that's an excellent reason to delay the start of a phone interview so we didn't have an argument with her about it. Pop journ­al­ism should not stand in the way of democracy. Here are some questions and some answers. 1. There are going to be seven questions here: one for each of your Number One singles. Obviously this puts quite a lot of pressure on I'll Be There getting to Number One. Do you think it will? OH MY GOD. That's a really big question. I'm so grateful for all the success I've had but I never put a song out thinking 'this is a Number One'. I'm in love with the song, for so many reasons, but I'd just be happy if someonebuys it. 1 2. There's a line in the song about being there for someone when they come home and the lights are off. Is it about God, or is it about an Amazon Echo? 3. Is this from exper­i­ences of your own? The song's a special one: I went away with a group of people I love to the middle of nowhere. I rented this amazing house and I was very grateful to my label for doing this — it was with some people who'd worked on my first album and some people who hadn't. One of the girls who came down on the last day was someone I'd written with a few times, Camille 2, and prior to that she'd been going through something quite bad. She'd messaged me last year saying that she'd been listening to my album, but through a different set of ears, and she said that I'd got her through some hard times. She came down to the writing thing and started this idea; when she played it to me I burst into tears. I love this song because it's for me, but it's also for everyone else. 4. There's a slight yodelling feel in the chorus, did you intend to be bang on trend? It's weird actually because this was written a while ago now and it's weird that now there's a big yodel thing going on. I feel like I've got this extra intel­li­gence that can see the future. Can I see my own future? No, I can't do that. I shouldn't have said that should I? It was a rash statement. I take it back. 5. Do you think you have anypsychic abilities? I believe in fate and the idea of getting out what you put in, and that kind of stuff. Karma, all of that. That's because of my dad, though, he's always been positive about life. I don't think I'm psychic. 6. The song's halfway between a ballad and a banger. What does this tell us about how the new album will sound? The mood is a lot more mature and it's not asupbeat as the last album, but it's still got a happy element to it. I'm a hopeful person. I always look at an album as a book. That's how I create one, anyway. I'll Be There is the first chapter. I look at it as a story. It's different, but in a great way. 7. In an article titled 'Jesstynng With Jess Glynne', what would be your opening joke? I'm not good with jokes. People falling over makes me laugh, but that's just because I'm evil. Not a given in the streaming age, to be fair.↩ This would be the amazing hitmaker Camille Purcell, aka Kamille↩ ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912205534.99/warc/CC-MAIN-20190326135436-20190326161436-00464.warc.gz
97,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/briefing/just-when-you-thought-it-was-safe-to-go-back-in-the-top-100/48957/," VV Brown played her next single, 'Shark In The Water', during her set at the Camden Crawl last Friday. It was the first time we'd heard the song and it sounded imme­di­ately brilliant — a rein­ter­pret­a­tion rather than a con­tinu­ation of the 'indie doo wop' schtick she's been working on over the last couple of singles and therefore a lot less sylised and a great deal more access­ible. The track's video appeared on YouTube last night. Here's what some punters on the Popjustice forums make of it. » ""It feels like a fantastic summer evening track.""
» ""This is delight­ful.""
» ""I've now listened to this like 6 times, on repeat.""

98,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/briefing/lady-gaga-perfect-illusion-and-an-experiment-in-delayed-gratification/," This week an era-defining, multi-platinum singer song­writer is releasing her new single. It would be something of an under­state­ment to say it's eagerly awaited, but enough about Melanie C — let's con­cen­trate on the new Lady Gaga single. Fact 1: Lady Gaga is the greatest popstar of the digital era. Even if you don't think she is, she is, so shut up. Fact 2: Her new single, 'Perfect Illusion', is due this week. It could leak at any moment. Fact 3: I'm not listening to the new single. When 'Perfect Illusion' appears — whether it's this Friday, or at any point between now and then — I won't listen to it. Twitter will go berserk, radio stations will fall over each other to give it its 'first play', blogs will post reviews and fans will hyper­ventil­ate. And I'll see all this happening. But I won't listen to the song. I've set myself some rules. You'd expect — or hope — that 'Perfect Illusion' will be unavoid­able, but I'll do my best. I'll add a 'purity ring' (mockup below) to Popjustice's Twitter and Facebook profiles so you know how it's going.  Well yes, but also no. I've been thinking about doing this for literally ten years, since long before Gaga popped up. The idea of delib­er­ately avoiding a song by a favourite artist is really exciting. I love the idea that there will be something out there, readily available, that's totally brilliant, that I can save for a rainy day. I've tried it in the past, and it hasn't gone very well. My first attempt was a fiasco: someone send me an early MP3 of Girls Aloud's 'Call The Shots', explain­ing in their email that it was really rather good. I decided to save it, and I lasted five minutes. I've toyed with the idea at various points since then, but it feels like with 'Perfect Illusion' the time is finally right. For the exper­i­ment to really mean something, it kind of has to be your favourite popstar, doesn't it? And what's good about doing this with 'Perfect Illusion' is that all signs are pointing to this being an actually legit­im­ately great single. The stakes couldn't be higher, making the exper­i­ment all the more valid. (Also: Lady Gaga first played me tracks from 'Born This Way' in May 2010, twelve months before they were released, which means I kind of have twelve months' grat­i­fic­a­tion 'in the bank', so perhaps this will restore some sort of cosmic equi­lib­rium in this thing we call pop.)  I'm not sure how long I'll keep this going. I can imagine it'll turn into a bit of a hassle. The first hour will be exciting. The second hour will be hard work. I expect I'll probably consider listening to the song after about three hours. Then it'll get easier, but after a week I'll wonder why I'm doing it. You get the general idea. I've got a few options for the first listen: 1. After precisely one month. One month feels like a good minimum. 2. On Christmas Day. 3. On the day one of my other favourite popstars releases an under­whelm­ing new single — so 'Perfect Illusion' would exist as a sort of backup banger for use in a genuine pop emergency. Like, imagine if Lorde com­pletely fucks it. You're going to need something to cling to in that sort of scenario, aren't you? Feel free to join me in abstain­ing. The more you think about it, the more exciting it seems. There are great new songs released every single month, so you'll still have something to listen to. Why not give it a try? And if you don't fancy joining me, free to listen to 'Perfect Illusion' when it appears. But do so in the knowledge that this might make you a psy­cho­path.

The album's not legally available in the UK yet which is fairly fucking annoying to be honest but the good news is that you can stream the whole thing on SoundCloud and, as you can hear right here, it is PRETTY BLOODY GOOD.  A jolly excellent album, we are sure you agree. 1. Why isn't anyone in the UK making music like/as good as this? 2. If there are people in the UK making music like/as good as this, who are they? 3. When is Zowie coming to the UK to do a load of 'buzz-building' gigs and inter­views with the hint of a full album release at some point in the future, leading to an ulti­mately dis­ap­point­ing level of success thanks to the half-arsed efforts of someone at Sony's London office who didn't really want to work it but was made to because times are tight and we've all got to work on things we don't want to work on and if you don't like it you know where the door is? 4.

Popjustice editor Peter Robinson — that's me — is ready to receive. Let's see what's arrived in the Popjustice inbox this time round (and if you'd like to send a letter of your own, details are at the bottom of this post and the best letters receive a leftover badge from the last time we did a letters page). Dear PopJustice, Rumour has it (after appearing at Brighton Pride) that Carly Rae 'Jeppo' currently has a pixie crop style haircut. I wanted to know what you thought about her current hairstyle. Basically is it an accept­able pop star haircut or do we think she should grow back the long luscious locks before we can accept her as the mega popstar we all know she is ? Yours thank­fully (in anti­cip­a­tion of you clearing this matter up promptly) Paul
Ipswich Paul I am so glad you asked (though let me begin by noting that Popjustice, unlike Jeppo, has a lowercase 'j'). The 2006 me would have said that Carly Rae Jepsen's fol­licu­lar timeline should represent a journey of con­tinu­ous discovery, exper­i­ment­a­tion and joy. And Jeppo would certainly appear to be open to this idea, and her recent Danny L Harle video even shows a will­ing­ness to invest­ig­ate wigs. However the 2016 me regrets to inform you that any dis­cus­sion of these matters between you and I amounts to little more than miso­gyn­istic hair­splain­ing and that what 'is' and 'is not' accept­able is nobody's business but Jeppo's. I am sorry Paul but that's just the way things are. HIYA The per­cent­age of waking hours I fritter away wondering about the status of pop's most almighty Ship Of Theseus, Sugababes, has dwindled over the past year. My anti­cip­a­tion for the MKS album still hums away inside — perhaps in vain? — but with the Olympics having recently been televised my thoughts turn to The Other Three. We all know that Heidi was competent on Dancing On Ice, Jade was abso­lutely rubbish on Splash! and Amelle did pretty well on whatever Tumble was. But, even if it was not being broadcast on ter­restrial Saturday night tele­vi­sion, who do you feel would be most likely to 'medal' for Team GB in track and field's gruelling stick-chuck contest, the javelin throw? Yours, Thomas
@ttfb This has been on my mind too, Thomas, and after a fortnight's con­sid­er­a­tion I can only conclude that while all three Sugababes are familiar with the concept of chucking something into the unknown and hoping for the best, the member best suited to the javelin toss would be Heidi Range, as success in this area requires the javelin to achieve both height and range. I attempted to pull off a joke involving 'massive prick' and 'Dave Berry' but I'm afraid I couldn't quite get it to work. I'm sorry. (NB: The best Sugababes lineup to join for a relay race would be Heidi, Keisha and Mutya because if you're ready they'll pass the baton and let you go.) Hiya! Do you enjoy winding non-regular readers up? Frequenters of PJ are used to the sideways style of writing by this point, but something I love to do is scroll to comments to see people overreact to playful banter about their favs. Jamestown replies to the Ariana Grande remix of Into You post: ""unlisten­able? who's the dope that wrote this article, yo?"" My favourite song of all time is Groove is in The Heart, what's yours? How's the weather where you are? Does the toilet flush clockwise there? Why do you think CRJ just gets it? Bye Liam Healy
Dublin (@HulkySmashSmash) I suppose one option would be to make sure everything makes complete sense to people who don't read Popjustice, or people who are ter­min­ally stupid. That doesn't sound much fun. It's a bit like pop music isn't it? Most of the time, people who attempt to appeal to everyone and hit a real lowest common denom­in­ator audience end up releasing total nonsense. Like, you'd rather be Robyn than Shawn Mendes, wouldn't you? Also: 'Groove Is In The Heart' is terrible, my favourite song of all time (today) is Nicki Minaj's 'Pound The Alarm', the weather is alright but that depends on whether you like hot weather (I tend to view it as incon­veni­ent), I don't have a toilet or any need for one, and CRJ just gets it because the internet says she does. HIYA Popjustice! Last year, Bradley Stern wrote a piece about how dull pop music has become these days, and how it dis­cour­aged him from going on with MuuMuse. And now YOU wrote a piece about how dull pop music etc. So my question is: are pop bloggers losing faith? Bye for now! Kurt Corbeille
@kurtcorbeille Bradley's blog was excellent, and as you can see from MuuMuse and his work on Popcrush, he for­tu­nately didn't end up binning the whole thing off after all. My own piece was more about my frus­tra­tion with big artists and the various stupid decisions that lead them to release crap first singles, then the feeling we all have from time to time when we try to convince ourselves that we like songs more than we do. Re the main question in your letter, the thing is, even if big pop acts release duff music, there are new pop acts coming along all the time. And there will always be new pop acts. In a way, much as I'd love her to have executed a flawless album campaign, it doesn't matter that the first Britney single was semi-ropey, because listening through new album tracks by people like Tove Lo and Zara Larsson it's obvious that there's still brilliant pop being made, and great popstars to get excited about. I suppose it all depends how you sub­con­sciously pri­or­it­ise music and popstars. Do you prefer music, and the people who make it? Or popstars, and the music they make? I only started thinking about this recently but I tend to be music first, artist second, and then if an artist ends up releasing more than a handful of decent songs the priority sometimes shifts, but there's too much good music around to get hung up on artists who don't deliver. Hiya Popjustice! It recently occurred to me to check on the Visitor SoundCloud page. Yes, Visitor of ""Los Feeling"" and ""RNB"" fame, from what feels like a bygone pop era. After all, one of my greatest heart­breaks in all of pop is that the trail of space dust leading to the full-length debut Visitor album seems to have vanished long, long ago. Well. On the afore­men­tioned SoundCloud, I found a more-than-just-slightly-listen­able track (evidently ""posted"" a mere two months ago) entitled ""03 We Leave Tonight."" Furthermore, it occurred to me to ask you at Popjustice if you had heard it, if you had found it listen­able, and if you knew anything at all about the goings-on (or lack thereof) with regard to this elec­tronic ""outfit"". Signs of life? Or, should I just move on with my life at this point? Cheers, Jonathan B
Brooklyn, NY Well I've now listened to the song and it's quite enjoyable isn't it? I went for a nice drink with Visitor once. Funny how the pop gods decide that some acts will make it while others won't. Well, not very funny for Visitor I imagine, but either way it's good to hear a new song (if indeed it is a new song and not just something they found on an old hard drive). HIYA. La Roux's Trouble in Paradise is a brilliant album, espe­cially its fifth track, the indom­it­able ""Sexotheque."" Its chorus, ""He never answers the phone / Oh, I'll bet money, money, money, I bet / He's at the sexotheque"" is catchy enough that it would end mankind if it were a nasty bacterial infection. Yet it has passed through culture with minor impact. Would it be appro­pri­ate for a pop vanguard to elevate this song to a more deserving status? Would coercive means be justified? This cause is the nearest thing I can imagine ""pop justice"" looking like. I envision a pop landscape with Sexotheque at its centre, and I drift further and further into this image. Kind Regards, Jake
Oxford (@Jake_W_M) Jake, thanks for reminding me to listen to that album. I think 'Sexotheque' will have its moment, perhaps many years from now when you and I are both dead. Please be aware that before this can happen it's important that 'Uptight Downtown' somehow gets to Number One. I predict this will happen in 2025. Hiya Popjustice! Thanks for being an excellent source of inform­a­tion for all things pop music. I've been following you for years and I'm quite happy you're not showing signs of slowing things down. But I thought I should confess something: I have no idea what's the PJ Almighty actually is. I've never really under­stood what's this list for. I assume it's a list of acts you like at a specific point in time, but I must say I'm sometimes not quite sure what such or such singer is on that list. A few years ago Sophie Ellis-Bextor was on there and then she dis­ap­peared from the list, and I'm not really sure why, as she's probably the alpha and omega of pop music. So can you explain what's the PJ almighty 'ethos'? Your explan­a­tion might bring my knowledge of pop music to unex­pec­ted heights, and that would surely be a nice thing. I hope to hear from you soon, Axel The PJ Almighty has lived in the Popjustice sidebar for so long that I barely remember the original point, and yes I should update it more often, but as it currently stands it's five good people (or things) and one terrible person (or thing). They're numbered one to five, then 666 for the terrible entry, 666 being the number of the beast, ie evil. I usually also try to style the 666 so that it's brown: the inter­na­tion­ally recog­nised colour of shit. Originally it was meant to be a bit like those barometer things all magazines used to have — they each had their own not-very-original spins on the same idea, but it was a general best-to-worst, hot-to-not kind of idea that would usually be in the front section of a magazine. Fortunately I've long since abandoned any desire to replicate print mag ideas on Popjustice. Thanks for writing in to the letters page!  If you'd like to write Popjustice a letter it's extraordin­ar­ily simple — just drop a line to [email protected] using your favourite email applic­a­tion. The whole thing's explained in unne­ces­sary detail here.

Yes. Is that actually the title of your album?
No. It’s just a working title. OH COME ON. It’s a great title for the album.
Yeah? Nobody’s done it yet!  You’re as much of a fan as you are a popstar, you know what the fandoms are like. Like, imagine if after years of people yelling ‘WHERE IS #R8’ on social media Rihanna had actually called her album R8?
Now that is a good album title. Seriously!
Noted. I accept that it’s possibly a bit late in the game for this sug­ges­tion…
Everything is saved in my computer as TS2… Maybe you’re right. Hm… I’ll think on this, for sure. Well, as we know, Troye didn't even­tu­ally go for TS2. He went for Bloom, which was the title of one of the album's songs — a copout of truly epic pro­por­tions. But a great pop idea never really dies. We love how you’ve named each of our eras over the years. So we’ve decided to call our next album…#LM5 We’ve worked so hard on this, we are so proud & can honestly say this is our favourite album to date.

104,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/briefing/little-mixs-new-single-love-me-like-you-a-series-of-solid-facts/138435/," We first heard 'Love Me Like You' in May. We have lived with it going round and round in our heads for four months. Our love for this song is absolute. FACT: It's amazing. Very amazing. Worthy-successor-to-'Black-Magic'-level amazing. We're bringing you some retro vibes today with the FIRST snippet of #LoveMeLikeYou! We hope you ❤ it! 😍😍 The Girls 💖https://t.co/twzRciHdV4 — Little Mix (@LittleMix) September 18, 2015  FACT: Like ‘Black Magic’, this is a full-throttle Actual Pop triumph. Big melodies, big voices, loads of sparky song­writ­ing tricks and flour­ishes. The pro­duc­tion com­ple­ments the song, rather than vice versa. FACT: If you're going to homage a big girlband moment of 'yes­teryear' you might as well go for a big one, and Little Mix have gone for one of the Top 3 girlband moments of all time. FACT: You might start listening and initially think: ""Hold on. This is a bit of a change in direction, this song is a banger in one sense but it doesn't bang quite as hard as eg 'Black Magic', what's going on, I don't even know who I am any more, up is down and left is right."" By about the 0:25 mark you'll be thinking: ""Well this is certainly a more daring move than just knocking out something that sounds like DJ Mustard shat it out in the bath which is what passes for a lot of big pop these days."" And then at precisely the 0:51 mark all doubt goes out of the window and you just surrender to the song's almighty amaz­ing­ness. FACT: When we spoke to Little Mix about the song earlier this year they said that the original lyrics were a little bit 'outré' (they didn't use the word outré) and when they said that we didn't really know what they meant, but listening to the opening line ""he might got the biggest car"" we can't help but wonder now if it was ori­gin­ally about a large cock. FACT: Thinking about it, and you'll have to excuse our language here readers, this song could quite easily have ori­gin­ally been called 'Fuck Me Like You'. The song is, at its heart, about the fact that while romance is all very well, sometimes only A Bit Of Sex will hit the spot. FACT: The ""they try to romance me but you've got that nasty and that's what I want"" bit is the best bit. FACT: Also the ""that's what I want"" backing vocal bit is the best bit. FACT: The ""sha-la-lala"" part with the ""whoah-oah-oh-oh"" response are also the best bit. FACT: The chorus is the best bit. FACT: The ""L-O-V-E, love the way you give it to me"" bit is middle eight GOLD, and is also the best bit. FACT: All in all, a complete triumph. Well done everyone.

105,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/briefing/mcbusted-press-conferences-pictures-and-waffle/121578/,"Look at this, it's the Soho Hotel, which is a hotel in Soho.  But why are there between six and eight (probably six to be honest) fans outside? Well, this morning we went to a special event at this hotel. A few years ago we went to another event at the Soho Hotel. It was the playback of Madonna's 'Confessions…' album and there were goodie bags and flashing lights and it was frankly fucking amazing. But a few months before that, we went to another event at the Soho Hotel. It was an event at which Busted told the entire planet that they were going to split up due to Charlie from the band having finally had enough. It was a dark moment for pop music and humanity in general but we even­tu­ally got over it because at the end of the day we still had Girls Aloud and, anyway, McFly were knocking around by this point so it didn't feel like Busted were gone com­pletely. But actually, they were gone. That was it. We really loved Busted. They came along when pop was becoming a rather barren place, and they happened a bit by accident. Or if not exactly by accident, then certainly unex­pec­tedly. They didn't have a massive man­age­ment company behind them, they hadn't come from a huge TV show (which, even by 2002, was quickly becoming the music industry's easiest and therefore chosen and therefore sup­posedly 'only' way of launching acts), and they didn't have the world's biggest writers or producers pumping hits into their faces. Labels kept trying to launch boybands and it wasn't working, but Busted came along with their boyband-not-boyband routine and it just seemed to make sense. Also, the three members of the band were extremely funny and kind of eccentric in three quite different ways. They were always fun to interview or go on tour with. Obviously Charlie had to go off and do his Fightstar thing and that makes sense today just like it did when the band split, but it still hurts. IT STILL HURTS. Anyway McFly have continued to trundle along, and with some high profile reality TV appear­ances and knobs-ahoy pho­toshoots they've done a pretty good job of keeping their heads above water when most of their peers have dis­ap­peared, but at today's special event it was announced that they would join Matt and James from Busted to become McBusted. We'd argue that the trick with these compound names is that neither name should appear in full, which is why McFlusted is about 87% better than McBusted, but it's too late to change so there you go. Doors opened at 10.30am but we didn't want to look too eager, so we arrived at about 10.31am. You'll remember that the invite promised breakfast and while there were no sausages on offer we did find some miniature bacon-in-baps, and some egg sand­wiches. And some bacon sand­wiches.  You can tell the Soho Hotel is a posh estab­lish­ment — they've 'decanted' the tomato ketchup into recept­acles we can only describe as RAMEKINS. Here's another shot of the breakfast.  Before the proper press con­fer­ence started we were kept in a room with a TV in the corner. The TV had photofit faces made from James and Matt and Tom and Danny and Dougie and Harry and Not Charlie.  It was a bit like watching an episode of Crimewatch in which detect­ives make one last ditch attempt to trace those respons­ible for repop­ular­ising 7"" picture discs in the mid-2000s. Here are some members of the media.  Note the red scarf. After a while we were led into the proper press con­fer­ence room.  Emma Willis appeared, and made some amusing comments about it being 'bring your wife to work day'.  Then there was a video. It started off with a news report from 'back in the day' regarding Busted's SAD DEMISE then there were some black and white clips of Busted and McFly talking to someone off camera about how they decided to get back together etc etc.  After a while the interview segments were inter­spersed with members of McFly and Busted walking one by one onto the screen and standing in front of that height chart thing from the first Busted album sleeve.  Matt is the best dressed of the lot, not that you can tell in our shit pho­to­graph. Then McBusted came in and there was a polite round of applause.  As you can (probably not) see in our shit pho­to­graph the 'lads' were wearing this morning what they are wearing in the pho­to­graph. It's good that they're not throwing money around on things like 'two sets of clothes' but hopefully they'll at least have an extra set of underwear by the time the tour comes around.  (On the subject of the tour, they just started talking about it without actually announ­cing it properly, which was a bit like at the Girls Aloud press con­fer­ence last year when they went 'HIYYAAAAA' and started chatting but actually forgot to announce anything.) (But the tour is happening next spring.) They said there wasn't a McBusted album planned and we asked them about whether there would be a TV show and they said there wasn't a TV show planned either which makes us think 'yeah right' and 'yeah right' respect­ively. (What we think is this: there'll be the tour next spring and by that point some sort of TV deal will be done if it hasn't been done already, then that gives Busted — not McBusted — the summer to record an album for release in 'Q4' 2014, with a single late summer to coincide with the TV show being on.) There was lots of chat and it was all quite funny and light­hearted although there was a slightly strange moment when Tom started talking about babies and orgies, and then Matt and Emma pretended they didn't go to orgies and it was all a bit ""shall we move this along now"". One thing that did seem inter­est­ing during the press con­fer­ence was the way everyone talked about Charlie. For a start it didn't seem strange that Charlie wasn't there, but nobody really stuck the boot in or talked about him in a dis­missive way. We suppose this is their way of leaving the door open if he decides that, actually, this looks like it could be a bit of a laugh. (And it does look like it will be quite fun, in a way that straight­for­ward reunions often don't and in fact usually look like quite hard work.) Anyway after all that there was a brief video which just showed the tourdates.  Then everyone fucked off out of the screening room because nobody wants to sit in an empty screening room.  This is the exit.  Outside the screening room there was a big cardboard photo of McBusted but it was too big to steal.  We were given press releases on clip­boards.  Seriously guys EVERYONE at the press con­fer­ence got their own clipboard. Imagine the budget! It was like the 1990s all over again. (This said, imagine having to go down Rymans for that lot.)  There was a photocall with McBusted standing in front of the 'height chart' thing.  As you can see they were holding a large McBusted logo on a perspex back­ground. This, too, was too large to steal.  And after that everyone started drifting off. Loads of journ­al­ists got their pictures taken with McBusted. And while all this was happening, the hotel staff somehow carried on as if pop history was not happening right in front of their eyes.  After everyone had pissed off we had a chat with McBusted and it was a bit strange because you want to grab them and go ""OH CHRIST I HAVE MISSED YOU EVERY DAY AND EVERY NIGHT DON'T EVER LEAVE ME AGAIN"" and then on the other hand you know that for the last few years four of the band's six members haven't gone anywhere and have, in fact, been pretty much every­where. So that's odd. And it's also odd that there's just a tour planned, without any apparent plan for an album, or a TV show or whatever. But maybe they're just stag­ger­ing their announce­ments, or gauging interest or something. Either way it was an 8/10 sort of morning (and would have been a 9/10 if there had been sausages on the breakfast platter), and if you'd like to win the clipboard and press release just send an email to [email protected], tell us your favourite Busted memory, and we'll pick the best or funniest or somethingest one as the winner. Cheers!

106,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/briefing/mcflusted-event-must-happen/121501," We'd say this is the best email we've received all week but as those of you who follow us on Twitter know we've already received one from the Christopher Maloney mailing list since Monday, and there was another one about Emeli Sandé ordering a vegan meal in a res­taur­ant, but the news that Busted and McFly are forming some sort of super­group is still pretty exciting. The event outlined above is taking place on Monday. Here's what we would like to happen: 1. Busted need to acknow­ledge the sig­ni­fic­ance of the venue. 2. The breakfast needs to involve a sausage. 3. The whole thing must be tied in with a TV show and that TV show must be on ITV2. Only ITV2 can really fulfil the potential of this pop­cul­tural extra­vag­anza. Hopefully it will reach the dizzy heights of America Or Busted, the not-really-remembered show Busted did for MTV 'back in the day'. 4. Ideally the TV show will be about the general LOLs that surely exist in any and all obviously engin­eered McFlusted situ­ations, but in terms of a story arc you're going to be looking at either the sextet's repeated attempts to get Charlie to sign up OR the band's quest to find A New Charlie. 5. When the six-piece starts 'gigging', support must be provided by 'Hip To Hip' hitmakers V. NOT THE VAMPS. 6. There need to be new Busted songs which pick up where old Busted songs left off, a bit like sequels set ten years on. So there needs to be a follow-up to 'What I Go To School For' in which Miss Mackenzie, by this point a broken woman, reflects on the instant dismissal and criminal charges that arose after her affair with a pupil became public. There also needs to be a song called 'Year 3010'. 7. Hopefully there will be some recog­ni­tion of the fact that Matt's solo album was actually really good. 8. If the breakfast could also involve fried eggs that would be great. 9. We'd like more emphasis on Busted than McFly if possible, McFly haven't been out of the public eye for long (ie at all) and for that reason the McFlusted press con­fer­ence thing cannot be more than 38% about them. 10. Actually some nice black pudding would also be good vis-à-vis the whole breakfast thing, cheers.

Headline facts: WHAT A SONG. We first heard it a couple of months ago and have been obsessing over it ever since. Seriously what a song. It has to be in the all-time Top 2 songs called 'Always On My Mind', surely? Anyway we wanted to know a bit more about Hanna & Andrea so we emailed over some questions. They emailed back some answers. Apparently this is their first ever interview and it is undoubtedly a memory they will cherish in years to come. Who are you and what are you doing?
""We are a Swedish duo called Hanna & Andrea, and we're 16 and 18. We go to different schools but dance and sing together in our free time."" Your song is amazing. Where did it come from, and who did you work on it with? Is it typical of what’s to come?
""Thank you, always fun to hear! Our music label pitched the song to us and we imme­di­ately fell in love with it. It’s written by Mack, Robert Deadbeat Habolin and Patrizia Helander who all are really good song­writers! Right now we are mostly trying out different sounds. But music in the future will probably be similar to this song because we like this type of sound."" What’s the first award you’d like to win, and why?
""We would like to win a Grammy, not to get our hopes up but it feels like an achieve­ment and a reward for the work we put in."" How did you get involved with TEN, and how do you feel you fit in alongside their other artists?
""We wanted to do a cover and release it on YouTube so we got the chance to record the song in one of their studios. After that, we got asked if we would like to be a part of the label as signed artists, which we of course wanted! We fit in because it feels like everyone on the label is different from each other, and everyone has their own type of music and per­son­al­ity."" People haven’t really heard of you yet. But we want them to read this article! What should the headline be, to get the maximum number of people clicking through from Twitter and Facebook?
""Swedish duo Hanna & Andrea will always be on your mind!"" Hanna. You are going to be asked a lot about being Zara Larsson’s sister. The questions will be boring and repet­it­ive. Are you ready for this, and also what did she get you for Christmas?
""Yeah I know, I'm happy that there is music in the family! I just hope that people will under­stand that I want to focus on my music together with Andrea. As for the Christmas present, my sister gave me a perfume that I really wanted to have, so I was super happy!"" Amazing. Let's listen to that song again because it is, quite frankly, not the sort of song you only want to listen to once. You'll be wanting to follow these two because big things are coming.

Lorde — 'Green Light'
Last night someone on Twitter was a bit critical of this song, saying that it sounded like Sia, Robyn, Ellie Goulding and Florence '+' The Machine. Now correct us if we're wrong but a song that sounds like four diverse but brilliant artists — while also still sounding like one of the best popstars of the 21st Century (ie Lorde) with a bit of Niki & The Dove and Icona Pop thrown in — is probably actually quite good, right? Wrong of the week:
Gryffin, Illenium and Daya — 'Feel Good'
This is a bit of a sad one. This time last year Gryffin seemed like one of the most promising producers in pop and his artist project started bril­liantly with a great Josef Salvat col­lab­or­a­tion. But with 'Feel Good' and his last release 'Whole Heart' we've seen him change and dilute his sound into generic post-Chainsmokers Spotpop, to the point where this new one even features Daya. He's a far better producer than The Chainsmokers, he's clearly in this for the long haul and we can see the com­mer­cial sense in trying to blend in, but it's a shame to see Gryffin jettison the sound that made him exciting.

Gabrielle Aplin — 'Waking Up Slow' 
For over half a century music critics have searched for new and innov­at­ive ways to describe how much they like songs. They've deployed metaphor and hyperbole; they've attempted to capture in words the sounds they're hearing and the emotions they're feeling. And after all this time, the best music journ­al­ists still find fresh and exciting ways to bring music to life through text, which is usually a waste of time con­sid­er­ing everyone can hear everything anyway, but let's gloss over that. The point is, on hearing 'Waking Up Slow' we willingly subjected ourselves to an hour of tran­scrib­ing, which is to say the song sounded so brilliant that we got Gabrielle on the phone to talk about it. If you've never had to tran­scribe an interview just take it from us that there really cannot be any higher praise. You can read the interview here, it's quite good fun. Wrong of the week:
Jessie J — 'Real Deal'
Jessie J's latest career move involves teaming up with M&Ms for the release of 'Real Deal'. If she really is so hell-bent on marrying music and food she should at least have held out for a super­mar­ket lunch-based campaign and called it 'Meal Deal'.

Ina Wroldsen — 'Strongest'
It's the wroldest trick in the book: write some songs for other people, launch a solo career of your own. Ina's more than paid her dues though — having made her name as the sixth Saturday, Ina's since become one of pop's most prolific song­writers, with recent credits including Calvin Harris, Clean Bandit, Anne-Marie and Jess Glynne. In the past we've also written about her duo Ask Embla but with a new major solo deal things are now properly kicking off for Ina as a solo artist, and 'Strongest' is her opening shot. It feels instantly familiar — sonically it's not a million miles away from at least two recent hits — but the song covers unusual lyrical ground and her voice is bursting with per­son­al­ity.

The bad news from the pictures we've been sent is that Needleman, an in-demand pho­to­grapher with an impress­ive portfolio, non­ethe­less failed to capture Niall Horan sitting on anything remotely appro­pri­ate for a human arse. Instead the pictures he took tell the story of how this rebel without a chaise will simply not sit on your fucking chair. As a result we are presented with a series of intimate portraits which, put together, depict a troubled, complex man. A man in crisis.  He's wearing his shoes on that nice rug too. The people who rented their home out for the shoot left very clear instruc­tions regarding footwear inside the house. That'll be an extra $90.  Earlier that day it's reas­on­able to expect that Niall did a big shit out of his bumhole, but there he is, bold as brass, placing that very bumhole in close proximity to a food pre­par­a­tion area. On the chairs front, it's clear that he is in a room that surely offers ample seating — possibly even at a 'breakfast bar' — but Niall is unhappy with that arrange­ment. One is inev­it­ably led to wonder if Niall has perhaps suffered at a breakfast bar — perhaps falling off a chair or stool and finding himself attaching a deep sense of shame to all future offers of seating, making him psy­cho­lo­gic­ally incapable of proper sitting.  What is that, a diving board or one end of a surfboard? Or is it just an ironing board? We'll tell you what it's fucking not: a chair.  This is perhaps the saddest of all the shots. Here we find Niall looking nervously at what one presumes is a sun lounger. He knows a sun lounger is prin­cip­ally used in a lying-down scenario, but he also knows that the sun lounger easily adjusts, allowing the user to sit up. Niall is not going to sit on that fucking sun lounger. But if everyone abso­lutely guar­an­tees that they won't adjust it, he might have a fucking lie down. Alright?

130,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/briefing/nine-observations-from-madonnas-la-concert/," There's a theory about Madonna that she's best when her back's against the wall. 'Ray Of Light' reignited her career as a proper global megastar after two relative flops, while the actually amazing but poorly received 'American Life' was swiftly followed by her last truly great album, 'Confessions On A Dance Floor'. While her last three — 'Hard Candy', 'MDNA' and now 'Rebel Heart' — have all had their moments, it still feels like we're waiting for that big rebound moment. After the lacklustre MDNA 'jaunt', perhaps the Rebel Heart tour — a typically audacious spectacle featuring a recre­ation of the last supper as an orgy, men on pre­cari­ous-looking bendy straws and pole dancing nuns — is her way of reminding the world that she's pretty good at this pop lark and has been for over thirty years. Obviously this being Madonna in 2015 you worry something's going to go wrong. After all, this is a tour in support of an album that leaked almost in full months before it was even announced. That was promoted by Madonna utilising some dodgy Photoshop, some black wire and, appar­ently, Wikipedia's random article function. Let's not even mention the unfor­tu­nate Brit Awards cape debacle (I do mention it below actually, apols). So when the clock ticks past the 9:30pm stage time people start to worry. As it edges past 10pm I'm convinced she's not coming out. By 10:15 I'm con­tem­plat­ing the Uber journey home. Five minutes later, however, and we're off, Mike Tyson bellowing from the big screens as 'Iconic' blares out. So, without further waffle, here are nine things I learned while watching Madonna have a singsong in LA:  You know it and I know it: 'Body Shop' is not a very good song. In fact, it's almost embar­rass­ingly shit. That it makes the setlist ahead of 'Ghosttown', or 'Hold Tight' or 'Inside Out' is fairly baffling, but it does give Madonna the chance to roll around on a car bonnet and maybe she's earned that right after all this time. Overall the new songs work quite well out of context of the album, although the opening section — which features four new songs — looks amazing but feels strangely sterile. In fact, most of the new songs are set within the show's more the­at­rical and rigid frame­works, while the older ones are done fairly straight. It means that she seems much more relaxed just having a dance and singsong while per­form­ing 'La Isla Bonita', for example, than she does hanging upside down during 'Holy Water', and not just because of the physical exertion aspect. It sometimes feels like she's forcing the new songs to appear more spec­tac­u­lar than they are. Also, Madonna, get rid of 'Candy Shop' too, please and thank you.  Dotted around the Forum are various fans recre­at­ing various eras of Madonna's career. There are women covered in bangles and lace; one woman is dressed as Dawn French dressed as Madonna doing 'Vogue'; one guy has arrived in a full gimp outfit, although perhaps that was just because it was a Tuesday night. Also dotted about, however, are matadors and people sporting black bull horns. Following the Brits per­form­ance it feels like the song and the outfits have pushed their way alongside Madonna's other iconic looks, which, given the fact I can barely even remember most of the songs/videos from the previous few albums, is a good thing for Madonna's continued ability to inspire her fans' shopping habits. On stage 'Living For Love' was quite a moment too. Obviously — OBVIOUSLY — she still wore a cape but this time it was about twenty times longer, as if she was daring it to go wrong again. This time you could see she turned to her dancers and nodded when the cape was ready to be torn off, and off it came, this time not dragging her down after it thank goodness. That bit got one of the biggest cheers of the night too.  Look at it! Yeah yeah it's a heart and a cross and actually if you had a bar going through the middle of your penis I'd go and see a doctor, but that is meant to be a cock and balls, surely? In fact, I don't know why I'm asking because Madonna agrees. ""Thank you for lighting up my penis"" she says at one point, before adding: ""It's inter­est­ing how much a heart looks like the head of a penis. Honestly I didn't plan it that way."" Cue a very knowing look. NEWSFLASH: Madonna's a really great popstar. She can do the singing, the dancing, she's sweary, she's knowing, she's funny, she looks like she loves doing it and she'd kill your cat to be more suc­cess­ful. What Madonna isn't is a guitarist. And that's fine, obviously, I just wish someone would tell her (I think we have William Orbit to blame for this so maybe he should do it). So tonight we get (an otherwise incred­ible) 'Burning Up' thrashed out on an electric guitar. The lovely 'Secret' is hampered by some 'unique' acoustic guitar strumming and 'True Blue' and a cover of 'La Vie En Rose' are eked out on a ukulele. A UKULELE! She's not Ed Sheeran for Christ's sake! Still, 'True Blue' though, what a fucking tune. Madonna's stage 'banter' consists mainly of ""LA you mother­fuck­ers"" and ""Are you ready to heat shit up Los Angeles"". It does the trick. But just before she does 'Rebel Heart' she gives a lovely speech about her fans and their loyalty and talks about her career. She also at various points mentions how tired she is. During 'Rebel Heart' she shows a montage of drawings fans have made showing her various looks from her various eras and it all feels pretty nostalgic. In fact, all of these things felt quite new for Madonna, a woman who doesn't really enjoy relying on the past or reflect­ing on it for too long. It suits her too, meaning that the show's older songs — at one point she does a medley involving 'Dress You Up', 'Into The Groove' and 'Lucky Star' — feel like a cel­eb­ra­tion rather than some songs she's contorted into new shapes so as not to appear like she's resting on her back catalogue (something her last few tours have stub­bornly avoided). As with Janet Jackson's current tour, it just means she's cel­eb­rat­ing what she's achieved and there's nothing wrong with that is there really. Oh and there's also some self-awareness too! At one point she says: ""You're probably bored of my stupid cliche, rebel heart."" My lips are sealed. The setlist features precisely zero songs from 'Ray Of Light', 'Confessions On A Dance Floor' or 'MDNA', but there is room for one of Madonna's greatest rel­at­ively neglected singles, 'Deeper And Deeper'. Seriously, what a song that is. Plus she doesn't just do a bit of it or mash it up with some other song — she does the full version and every moment of it is glorious. She tells the crowd a few times how happy she is to be in LA again and that she feels like it's a second home etc etc. To honour this fact she decides to do a song that's not in the setlist as a special treat during the 'acoustic section'. 'Oh', I think to myself, 'it will likely be 'Frozen' or some other song that will work quite well 'stripped back''. She only bloody does 'Like A Prayer' and not just in a boring way but the full amazing way. Here's a bit of it as shot by me on an iPhone: Quite good.  Every night Madonna pulls a fan out of the crowd and makes them dance and then gives them a banana. Usually the fan will pretend to give the banana a blowjob or Madonna will hint that it could be used as a dildo or something and that's that. Tonight the 'unapo­lo­getic bitch' is none other than fellow song singer Katy Perry (or Katherine as Madonna calls her (after Katy calls her 'mom')). So Katy does some awkward dancing (obviously), Madonna spanks her, then pretends to have sexual inter­course with her from behind and then gives her the banana. Only this time the banana is a flask and, without knowing what's in it, Perry just downs a whole load of it. Madonna then does the same but recoils in horror. Ergo, Katy Perry can handle her drink better than Madonna.  Sharing a Banana with Katy Perry‼️ Highlight  of  my show at the Forum!

It's been in Popjustice's Big Hit Energy playlist for about a month and, in a rare instance of pop justice in action, over the weekend the semi-ludicrous, 100% amazing pop beast romped to victory at Melodi Grand Prix, meaning that it's now been selected as Norway's official actual entry.

It's the crowd noise, isn't it? The crowd noise when the first chorus explodes. You simply cannot go wrong with crowd noise. The band should put a new version of Spotify which is just the normal version with crowd noise chucked on top.  In an email to Popjustice last month, Tom from the band explained that KEiiNO's goal ""is to make arctic pop-bangers combining joik, nordic folk and camp pop in a synth heavy sound"", which he might have just copied and pasted from some existing text but that doesn't matter because but whichever way you look at it that description's just ideal isn't it? Tom's next email was from ""up here in the mountains"".

136,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/briefing/orla-gartland-makes-good-music-but-hasnt-considered-the-practical-side-of-living-in-a-lighthouse/,"Orla Gartland's a really cha­ris­matic, sort-of-new singer song­writer whose newest release is low-key rumbler I Go Crazy. It's out this week — she made it with col­lab­or­at­ors The Usual Suspects, the newly-formed pro­duc­tion duo con­sist­ing of La Roux's Ben Langmaid and Sean Genockey. There's a great line in the song about being on ""the edge of 22"" which you will be 0% surprised to hear was inspired by Stevie Nicks. ""There's an undeni­able Edge Of Seventeen influence,"" Orla tells Popjustice. ""Although I'd like to think I avoided stealing the groove com­pletely…"" Orla adds that there's a 'What would Stevie do?' poster in the studio, which partly inspired the line. ""I mean the real answer to 'what would Stevie Nicks do?' is probably a fat line of cocaine, but that's not as inter­est­ing as writing a song is it?"" Orla's from Dublin (Grafton Street is now full of busking Ed Sheeran wannabes, she notes) but she's been living in Ealing for two years, and if you're not well-acquain­ted with London let's just say Ealing isn't exactly where popstars tend to live. ""I knew I wasn't cool enough for east London,"" is Orla's explan­a­tion. ""And I'll never be cool enough. I know that. I look at it like this: I can either be the least cool person in east London, or be within the top three cool people on one specific road in Ealing."" Good attitude. If you search Orla on Spotters you'll find a couple of earlier EPs: the first is quite 'real music' so approach with caution but the second, 2016's Shapeshifting, is a bit more elec­tronic. Listen quickly, though, because Orla's thinking of taking her old stuff down. ""It's the most pre­ten­tious thing to do and an entirely selfish move,"" she smiles, although we're on the phone so she might not be smiling, but she says it in a smiley way so let's not think too hard about this whole thing. ""But we all feel like we're getting better at the things we do, don't we? At the same time, though, if I like someone's new song and see their older stuff online, and it's not as good as the new stuff, sometimes I think: 'Well, you've been working at this a long time, so fair play.'"" So she might take the old stuff down or she might not. She has not yet decided. In any case it's the new stuff that's important here. Orla's at Waterloo Station when we speak; she's waiting for a train to take her to the studio. We end up talking about spooky robot-gloved pop wizard Imogen Heap who, Orla declares, is really cool. ""She has her own studio, she lives in a light­house and Taylor Swift wants to make music with her,"" she adds, but that whole light­house thing just sums up Imogen Heap, doesn't it? How would you even put shelves up? ""It's archi­tec­tur­ally difficult,"" Orla concedes. Realistically, the only way you could put a shelf on a curved wall would be to attach it ver­tic­ally, and then everything would just fall off. ""You're putting me off the light­house idea now,"" Orla even­tu­ally says. ""I hadn't thought about that."" Well think on, Orla Gartland. Think on.

But here we are. Here we are with Niall 'Niall' Horan releasing a solo album called 'Fucker'. And you might say well, this is clearly not the title of Niall's album. Niall's debut album is called 'Flicker', you might insist. But the more you find out about pop, and the more you find out about the way pop works, don't you find yourself realising that nothing, not even #susan­al­bumparty, really happens by accident? Because you know, don't you, that dozens or even hundreds of people saw this artwork before it went Out There, and that at a con­ser­vat­ive estimate at least half, if not two thirds, of those people would have seen 'FUCKER'. And some of those people will have thought nobody else would notice. But many would have thought: this is actually quite good. This is edgy if we need it to be, totally non-edgy if we don't. We are winning at musicbiz, they decided. We are having our cake and eating it but in fact not even eating it, we're throwing the cake directly into the bin because we have cracked the code of 21st century enter­tain­ment and money is no longer a problem. The glory days are here again. So what sort of fucker do you think we are dealing with here? What are we, the global pop-consuming community, to take from all this? Is it fucker as in ""you cheeky little fucker, Harry was supposed to have all the best solo songs and now it's all gone wrong""? Is Niall a fucker in the sense of ""no bottoming for me thanks""? Or are we talking about fucker in the broader, almost spiritual sense of Niall fucking with us all by releasing an album called 'Flicker' which looks like 'Fucker' and doing so on purpose because he is — to bring us back to our first pro­pos­i­tion — a cheeky little fucker?

That dream comes a step closer right now with the appear­ance of Tove Ask, who releases her debut EP today. Tove's from Malmö in Sweden (of course she is) and her brand of pop is a bit more club-based than the music we've been hearing from the other Toves. This is her EP's lead track, which is quite jolly. There's a video, too — it depicts Tove des­troy­ing one of Ikea's iconic 'heart with hands' cushions, which we believe is actually a criminal offence in Sweden. ""She looks a bit like Kiesza in that picture above,"" you might be thinking. ""But when Kiesza appeared she had that amazing pensive cover of Haddaway's 'What Is Love?'. I bet Tove Ask hasn't covered an old pop banger in a slightly downbeat fashion."" WRONG. You can find out more about Tove on her Facebook, Twitter and official site.

140,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/briefing/q4-in-crisis-49-things-pop-must-deliver-before-january-1/," Right, we've given it a week and we'll be honest with you: Q4 is under­per­form­ing. Yes, the David Guetta single is good in ways nobody could have expected. Yes, Avicii and Robbie's single is 'a big thing' and bad in ways most people would have expected. Yes, McBusted's single announce­ment is a pretty Q4 event. And yes, we'll accept that the BBC did pull a big rabbit out of the hat last night with the One Direction and Jake Bugg col­lab­or­a­tion. But where's everything else?  As we outlined last year in our intro­duct­ory guide to all things Q4, Q4 is the most special time of year for pop music. Qthousand4teen needs to buck up its ideas, and here's what we want to see before 2015 comes along and ruins all the Q4 fun.  1. Let’s have a Rihanna single. We don’t even need a whole album. Just a single. We'll take anything at this point. 2. McBusted’s ‘Air Guitar’ video needs to be set at a karaoke night; the full McBusted album must include a song about the demise of Busted. 3. Will Young doing The Beloved's 'Sweet Harmony' for the John Lewis ad please. 4. Actually, thinking about it, let’s have a Rihanna album after all. 5. Gwen Stefani’s single has to be almost super­nat­ur­ally incred­ible.  6. We don't care if it's finished or not: Tamera Foster’s debut single needs to come out this year and we don’t want any of this Sade bollocks people were talking about earlier this year. This needs to be balls-out amazing. 7. The only person allowed to release an album that sounds like Sade in Q4 is Sade, and even that’s pushing it a bit. 8. Almost one year ago to the day we tweeted about a new Calvin Harris album coming in 2014. This was based on an email we'd just got from his label but in a reply Calvin seemed quite surprised by the news. He’s since deleted that tweet but ‘Motion’ is indeed coming, and its release date falls in the pop calendar’s most exciting 25%. So we were right about the Calvin Harris album and Calvin Harris was wrong about the Calvin Harris album. The Gwen track obviously needs to be com­pletely amazing, and the album’s not out for a few weeks so there’s still plenty of time for Calvin to release a few more singles, thus achieving the impress­ive ‘half a greatest hits’ feel he pulled off on '18 Months’. (We also like the American Horror Story-esque ‘returning cast’ feel of Ellie Goulding and Theo Hurts coming back to do some more songs.) 9. It’s yet to be offi­cially announced but The Saturdays’ Christmas album must be com­pletely ridicu­lous, but it must also not be total shit. As well as sleigh­bell-strewn original songs the album must include covers of Low’s ‘Just Like Christmas’, Saint Etienne’s ‘I Was Born On Christmas Day’ (with Marvin Humes as Tim Burgess), Hurts’ ‘All I Want For Christmas Is New Year’s Day’ and Leona’s ‘One More Sleep', plus the greatest festive single in recent history — Paul Holt’s ‘Fifty Grand For Christmas’. It must be called 'On Your Reindeer'. 10. Something about Adele. 11. One Direction’s farewell album must follow in the pensive footsteps of ‘Fireproof’. 12. Sorry to go on about this, but about this Rihanna album. We’ve heard mur­mur­ings of guitars. But Charli XCX’s involve­ment has also been mooted. The latter would be accept­able, as would a com­bin­a­tion of both.  13. Taylor Swift’s album must be the album of the year. To give you some idea of the scale of this album's power, Max Martin's done at least nine songs. Don't let us down Max. 14. In other Max Martin news, we’d like to hear the fruits of Tove Lo’s writing sessions as part of Max's team, and in total we’d like to hear three different Max Martin-helmed singles by three different non-Swift US recording artists before Q4 is out. 15. She might be the planet’s least self aware popstar but even Jessie J must know that this new album of hers is make or break, at least in terms of the inter­na­tional superstar status she covets. The good news is she’s got form when it comes to decent songs. 16. Emeli Sandé’s already sidled her way into one big Q4 release (ie that BBC ‘God Only Knows’ single) but there’s still time to whack out a single and album before the end of Q4. Obviously, as she’s discussed in the past, she has strong feelings about how exploit­at­ive shows like The X Factor can be. The good news is that she's more than happy to put her strong prin­ciples to one side if there's a chance of flogging some music, so maybe she could appear (yet again) on one of the live shows.  17. If a 'Bangerz' repack called 'Banger2' def­in­itely isn't happening we want to know why and we want the names and addresses of everybody involved in this heinous decision. 18. It’s increas­ingly hard to see where Madonna’s music promo ends and her hashtag addiction begins, but an album def­in­itely exists and while it's scheduled for 2015 we mustn't forget that she's managed by the same man who 'mas­ter­minded' the U2 iTunes release, and Madonna’s still one of the few artists who could just about cause the necessary fuss a semi-Beyoncé requires. 19. Speaking of U2, isn't there supposed to be another album on its way? Not the forth­com­ing physical release of 'Songs Of Innocence' (which is a release that takes the one good thing about that album — the artwork — and changes it). A com­pletely different one. Given how long they spent between albums there must be several potential U2 albums knocking around. They could chuck an LP onto iTunes once a week for the rest of Q4 if they wanted to, but the one we’d be inter­ested in hearing is the one that contains the RedOne sessions. 20. We’re going to set ourselves up for a fall here but we’re crossing our fingers for a Cheryl album with more than three good songs on it. 21. More import­antly, would a surprise Nicola Roberts track between Christmas and New Year be too much to ask for? She's been in the studio, at least one of the songs must be SoundCloud ready. 22. Do you think it would help if we just phoned Rihanna every two days to ask how she was getting on?  23. 'Oily' Murs has an album on its way. The first single’s not great, but he usually manages a few decent tracks from each album campaign, and given Olly's standing in the British male pop 'community' we're going to have to demand at least one all-out triumph. “I want to be the biggest male artist in the country,” he recently told Music Week. ""I might never get there but I’m going to keep going until that day when you know it’s over.” We’re not sure what to make of that; nor are we entirely sure what to make of this: “I look at the market and always try to challenge myself. So if I hear an Avicii song I might want to write an Avicii song.” (Apparently one song on his album, the Steve Mac and Wayne Hector track ‘Stick With Me’, does indeed sound a little bit like an Avicii song.) 24. The Nicki Minaj album is going to be great, right? 25. One of the things we really love about the current Kylie 'era': the way Kylie's letting leftover tracks find their way to fans. Another thing we like about the current Kylie 'era': loads of these songs are actually really good. We'd like to see another surprise EP release on the morning of December 25. 26. David Guetta's new single is great. Will the album also be great? No, it will contain a large amount of old nonsense, but 'Dangerous' is a good reminder that Dave should never be under­es­tim­ated. 27. Susan Boyle’s album features a version of 'You Raise Me Up’ featuring the Lakewood Church Choir. This must have a massive donk at the end of it. 28. Iggy Azalea's reissuing her album. It'll include new songs with Charli XCX and Ellie Goulding which is all very well but Azo needs to bin off the title ('The New Classic: Reclassified') and call the reissue 'First Things Second'.  29. We're afraid we're going to have to insist that Ella Henderson – whose album is out next week — stages a stu­pendous X Factor per­form­ance with fire and a choir. Fire And A Choir should actually be deployed on all X Factor per­form­ances. 30. This isn't a demand as such but bear in mind Status Quo have an acoustic album coming out. It's called… 'Aquostic'. 31. The thing is, Rihanna's at a point now where if she doesn't want to release an album, she just won't. That's the problem. She's too big. This is our fault, and your fault. We created a monster. 32. Released on November 3, James Blunt's 'Moon Landing (Apollo Edition)’ is perhaps the quint­es­sen­tial Q4 release. You know those 'hilarious' videos of posh actors reading out deranged tweets and YouTube comments? We would like this James Blunt release to include a hidden track in which James Blunt's tweets are read out in a posh voice, ie by James Blunt. 33. Do you think Sia might release a second single at some point? 34. The BBC Music Awards — which take place on December 11 — need to be properly amazing and they need to be a proper snapshot of what people around the country actually enjoy listening to, ie it can't just be a wobble­board player off Jools Holland, Clean Bandit, and a 'once in a lifetime' col­lab­or­a­tion between Tinie Tempah and some sort of symphony orchestra. It’ll be hosted by Fearne Cotton and Chris Evans. 35. Speaking of Fearne Cotton, don’t panic guys — there’s a Radio 1 Live Lounge com­pil­a­tion album out on October 27! We'd like to see Fearne Cotton write track-by-track sleevenotes for this one, and under each and every song title we'd like to see one of these three phrases: ""Goosebumps."" ""Real talent."" ""Just wow."" 36. The 2014 Popjustice Twenty Quid Music Prize has to be won by a brilliant song. This year's shortlist is the strongest in years; if you'd like to join us in London to be part of the judging process see this page for details. 37. Sam Bailey’s due to appear on the X Factor semi-final, flogging the new edition of her album 'The Power Of Love'. We can't seem to find the artwork online yet so we're hoping there's still time for her label to consider one of these sug­ges­tions.  38. 'Christmas At Downton Abbey' is out on November 10. It features cast members singing and if there isn't a version of 'Fancy' by Hugh Bonneville and Maggie Smith the whole release will be entirely pointless. 39. Seriously, if there isn't a sniff of Rihanna by the first week of December we're hiring a lookalike, a sound­a­like, some song­writers and a video director and sorting this out ourselves. Someone has to take respons­ib­il­ity for this shambles. 40. Right. Sugababes. Mutya Keisha Siobhan. Whatever they're called these days. Something, as they posted just yesterday, is actually happening. We know 'something' is 'happening' every fortnight with that lot, but it does seem like something's moving along this time. Moving forward we should probably look at Sugababes not as potential chart-toppers whose releases should be judged on their com­mer­cial success. Instead we must see this whole thing as a beautiful pop miracle that we are priv­ileged to witness. They'll put out some music at some point. It'll be great. And that, really, should be enough. 41. Is there any chance Little Mix could pull their forty fingers out please because a lyrically generic but sonically fantastic empower­ment banger is exactly what we all need during the cold Q4 months. 42. December 13 is Beyoncé Day. Beyoncé Day is the day on which any artist whose release schedule has gone a bit wonky during the preceding twelve months is required, by law, to just chuck an album on iTunes. It's the day on which artists and labels cut their losses on slightly messy attempts to make or release an album. In a way, Beyoncé Day is a solid incentive to labels not to mess around. They can't say ""oh dear radio isn't playing the single we thought we'd launch the album with, let's try again with another one in four months and hope for the best"". Artists, meanwhile, can't say ""I'm not sure if this album is cohesive as a body of work, let's scrap everything and start again"". The rule is this: if you've recorded an album's worth of songs (which is twelve of them), it goes on sale on December 13 whether you like it or not. 43. Beyoncé should beyoncé an album on Beyoncé Day. (NOT A REMIX ALBUM.) (MAYBE THE BEY & JAY DUETS ALBUM.) 44. It goes without saying that if the music industry agrees to stick to the rules outlined above, Beyoncé Day may well be the day we receive a surprise Rihanna album.  45. Remember that thing the other week where Robyn was saying she'd recorded a new EP with Markus Jägerstedt and the late Christian Falk? Well let's have that in the middle of November please, because nothing says Christmas quite like Robyn. If we could have another EP of the Jam & Lewis stuff in Q1 that'd be brill, cheers. 46. Do you think Adam Lambert might sneak a new single out over the Christmas period? 47. The biggest release day of Q4 comes just over halfway into the season of good­cash­cows: on November 24 alone there are album releases from David Guetta, Nicki Minaj, Olly Murs and Susan Boyle. You know it's an important date — the latest Now compilation's out too. On this date we'd also like a surprise release of a Britney EP. 48. A number of proposed Q4 UK releases by Popjustice-approved solo singers of song have slipped back to 2015. These include albums by Tove Lo, Ella Eyre, Charli XCX, Indiana and Rita Ora. Ironically, by attempt­ing to avoid a Q4 solo singer bot­tle­neck, these artists may col­lect­ively have created a brand new one in Q1. Many of these will probably leak in the tail end of Q4, so that will be something to spice up the BLOODY BORING period between Christmas and New Year. 49. Did we mention Rihanna?

This young lady with AMAZING written three times across her face is Swedish 'songbird' Rosanna. She has AMAZING written over her for a good reason: she is amazing, and one of our favourite unsigned pop people. Her song 'Gameboy'… 
…is today's Song Of The Day and as you can hear it is fairly incred­ible. Another of her songs, 'Heartattack', ticks quite a few boxes on the Listenable Song checklist, too. 
She's made a cheap and cheerful video for another song, 'Flashing Lights'. It's got some flashing lights in it. httpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MedN_-dWRcE
There's more info over on Rosanna's MySpace — if you like these tracks, she's also con­trib­uted some bits to 'Stadium Status', the recent (partially very good) album by Kocky, which is on iTunes here. Like we say, at the moment Rosanna is unsigned but she can't stay that way for long, surely?

146,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/briefing/say-hiyya-to-yyz/," We've just put up YYZ's extraordin­ary, slightly unhinged new single 'Lost In The Mix' as a Big Song. We hadn't really noticed them before 'Lost In The Mix' came along but they're quite new, and let us tell you this ladies and gentlemen, it turns out that YYZ are EXTREMELY good. The trio have sort of been on Popjustice before, although not together. DJ person Ed Wilder was behind a highly listen­able vigilante remix of Nicola Roberts' 'Beat Of My Drum', which we featured as a Song Of The Day. Two years before that, as part of a band called Ghostcat, singer Ali and key­board­ist Dan scored another Song Of The Day with a song called 'This Is A Bust'. As well as 'Lost In The Mix' there are three more songs off their SoundCloud — 'Hit & Run' is probably the best of the lot.  As well as some good music — almost as import­antly — they've got a really good logo.  So there you are. A good new pop act to be inter­ested in. » YYZ on Facebook

147,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/briefing/scher-and-scheralike-the-new-nicole-single-and-the-differences-between-it-and-the-demo-of-it/,"It is tempting to think of Nicole Scherzinger (pictured right — don't look at her boobs that's exactly what she wants you to do) and her single 'Poison' as one of last year's most amazing pop surprises, although the fact that it was amazing should not have been sur­pris­ing at all because after the whole 'Her Name Is Nicole' 'debacle' it is not as if Polydor were exactly going to release a new Nicole solo single unless it was really quite listen­able and hitworthy. For the follow-up Nicole has taken the con­tro­ver­sial move of recording a song that is also basically brilliant. It is produced by Dave Aude, it's out in the UK on March 6 and it is called 'Don't Hold Your Breath'. You may well have heard the demo which features another singer and has been flying around all over the place for the last few days. If you have heard it you will already be aware of the following points: 1. It sounds all fizzy and half-danceable and is a cracking ""I've had enough of all this, I am a strong woman and I'm off""-type pop tune. It includes lines like ""it took all the strengh I had but I crawled up on my feet again"" and ""I
loved you so much that I thought some day that you could change"", with a
big old chorus of ""you can't touch me now, there's no feeling left. If
you thinking I'm coming back don't hold your breath"". 2. It is a proper romantic singsong sort of 'song' song rather than some techno nonsense with a load of old shouting about a) being brilliant, b) having a dance in a nitespot or c) being brilliant and having a dance in a nitespot. It is nice to have a decent song about love because love is the official topic of pop and anyone who tries to tell you otherwise is a fool to them­selves and needs to have a long sit down. 3. 
Fans of the metaphor will be cheered by the middle eight which includes
the lines ""jumped off a train running off the track"" AND ""a bad movie
ends and the screen fades to black"". We prefer the second one and we
don't really think Nicole jumping off a moving train is a very good
idea. ""Well that is the demo,"" you are probably thinking. ""Since the events of Holditagainstmegate pre­sum­ably we can now expect a ludicrous dubstep interlude to have been inserted."" Well, we all now know that the dif­fer­ences between an early version of a song (not intended, for good reasons, for public con­sump­tion) and the final proper single version can be pretty radical, but all told 'Don't Hold Your Breath' isn't a very extreme example of this. The song is identical in structure, lyrics and so on, it's just that everyhing is a little bit better and Nicole's vocal is far stronger. Allow us to illus­trate in giftular form.  Differences are really very minor — the finished version starts with a filtery beaty noise, after the first chorus the demo has more of a droppy out bit, and when it comes to the first post-chorus part the breathy bits are far lower in the mix and there's a lovely string
section element. One thing that's the same as the demo is the fact that the end of the breakdown is really let down by the absence of Nicole letting rip with an earsplit­ting ""DON'T HOLD YOUR BREATH!"" prior to the track crashing into its final
victory lap. It's a minor quibble though when you take into account how infec­tiously brilliant the song is. Anyway the Nicole album's also due in March and we're as excited about this as we are about the Britney album, but don't tell any of the Britney men­tal­ists on Twitter or they'll start moaning again. Then again, Britney men­tal­ists are always moaning about something so perhaps it's best if we at least direct what it is they moan about, a bit like those con­trolled explo­sions you sometimes see on the news.

Here are seven note­worthy singles being released between now and June, based on a list we nicked off UK Mix. THREE DAYS AND COUNTING: Another great Calvin Harris single with another terrible Calvin Harris video. :( Also out on April 28 (we've deleted the boring ones):
Kasabian — Eez-Eh << HAHA
Katy B — Still << QUITE SANDÉ BUT FAIRLY NICE
Kid Ink – Money And The Power
Lily Allen – Sheezus
Nerina Pallot – Free As You Wanna Be (EP)
You Me At Six – Cold Night
 TWO WEEKS AND COUNTING: Is this actually coming out in the UK? It says it is in the list we nicked from UK Mix but it's not exactly getting wall-to-wall radio plays is it? Still, any excuse to whack it on the site again because that chorus is really quite excellent, and a UK hit of some sort could pave the way for GRL to come over and release 'Ugly Heart', that incred­ible song that appeared a few weeks ago and, crucially, doesn't feature Pitbull. Also out on May 5:
2 Unlimited — No Limit << ?
Bashy feat Jareth – Bring The Lights Down
Essex Young Farmers – Put That Hoedown << ONE ASSUMES THIS IS AWFUL
Foxes — Holding Onto Heaven
Loveable Rogues – Honest << STILL GOING
Mike Oldfield — Moonshine
Shakira – Empire << OTHER FILM MAGAZINES ARE AVAILABLE
 THREE WEEKS AND COUNTING: Seriously. SERIOUSLY. We know lots of you took an instant dislike to Rita Ora for reasons nobody has adequately artic­u­lated. (Possibly something to do with music fans' perceived lack of involve­ment in the narrative of an emerging artist and the whole thing being presented as a done deal, but that surely can't explain the full force of the vitriol spewing from some quarters?) Either way this track is a certified belter. Look, if it makes it any easier for you, just imagine it was a Whitney Houston comeback single. OH YOU'RE LIKING IT NOW AREN'T YOU. We accept your apology. (The Becky Hill single is good as well but that doesn't seem to be online yet.) Also out on May 12:
Afrojack feat Wrabel — Ten Feet Tall
Becky Hill – Caution To The Wind << THIS IS GOOD
Jake Bugg — Messed Up Kids
Kylie Minogue — I Was Gonna Cancel << THERE'S AN INTERESTING STORY ABOUT WHEN THIS WAS RECORDZZZZ
Lady Gaga – G.U.Y. << QUITE LITERALLY AMAZING
Lethal Bizzle feat Cherri Voncelle – The Drop
Lorde – Tennis Court
Paloma Faith — Only Love Can Hurt Like This << 'QUALITY POP'
Pharrell Williams — Marilyn Monroe << NOT AS GOOD AS THE NICKI MINAJ SONG BUT STILL V GOOD
Taio Cruz — Don’t You Dare
The Weeknd – Wanderlust
 FOUR WEEKS AND COUNTING: What a likeable number this is. Also out on May 19:
Bombay Bicycle Club – Feel << OH DEAR
Clean Bandit feat Sharna Bass – Extraordinary
Eminem feat Nate Ruess – Headlights
Enrique Iglesias – Turn The Night Up
George Michael – Going To A Town << B-SIDE IS 'GOING DOWN THE SHOPS'
Kwabs – Pray For Love
Lana Del Rey — West Coast
Sam Smith — Stay With Me << TOTAL SANDÉ
 FIVE WEEKS AND COUNTING: We have recently been having a con­ver­sa­tion with a US publicist who wants us to feature some crap guitar music on Popjustice. As a broad but useful rule, we've ended up saying, Popjustice just doesn't feature guitar music. It's one of the central tenets of Popjustice. Well let's hope Jeffrey doesn't see this because 'Heart & Soul' is proof that even the most sensible rules can have excep­tions. This is just basically really good, isn't it? Also out on May 26:
Arcade Fire – We Exist
Ashley Roberts – Clockwork
Chicane – No More I Sleep
Ellie Goulding — Beating Heart
Janet Devlin – House Of Cards << SHE GREW UP IN A FIELD OR SOMETHING
Kyla La Grange – The Knife << STUPENDOUSLY ACE
One Direction — You & I
Röyksopp & Robyn – Do It Again (EP)
Stromae – Tout Les Memes
 SIX WEEKS AND COUNTING:  The success of this whole Say Lou Lou 'thing' is impossible to gauge at this stage. Are they doing well? Are they doing precisely as hoped? Or is 'Everything We Touch' make or break? AND WHEN IS 'BELOVED' GOING TO BE A SINGLE? We'll tell you this much, if 'The Lou' don't get to release their album we are going to go bloody berserk, and 'Everything We Touch' is just the tip of the amaz­ing­ness iceberg as far as that album is concerned. We have chosen to journ­al­ist­ic­ally embed a remix here, because the remix is extremely good (although the original version is not exactly shoddy). Also out on June 2:
Blood Red Shoes – Speech Coma
Demi Lovato – Neon Lights
Ed Sheeran – Sing << STILL GOOD
London Grammar – Sights
Metronomy – Reservoir
Sia – Chandelier << ONLY SIX WEEKS TO GO (!)
Wilkinson feat Tom Cane – Half Light
 SEVEN WEEKS AND COUNTING: This song-about-a-song by Disney Channel star Zendaya — who unsur­pris­ingly is signed to Hollywood Records — was supposed to come out in the UK earlier this month, but slid back to June. Since hitting YouTube last year it's already had over 50m views (for context, Calvin's single stands at just over 10m and Pitbull's at the 6.4m mark, albeit over a shorter period) and could be a massive UK hit, due in part to being rather good. Or it could com­pletely sink without a trace. One of the two, nothing in between. It's the Hollywood Records way. Also out on June 9:
Ella Henderson – Ghost << MORE 'QUALITY POP'
Tiesto feat Matthew Koma — Wasted
 And that, ladies and gentlemen, is what the next seven weeks of pop looks like, although there will of course be the usual slew of surprises and dramas that makes this entire list irrel­ev­ant.

149,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/briefing/several-of-the-best-christmas-songs-since-mariah/," Q4 2013 saw the glorious return of the con­tem­por­ary Christmas song, with superior Chrimbo bangerz — Chrimbangerz, if you will [WE WON'T THANKS — ED] — from Global Songstress Leona Lewis (in the shape of 'One More Sleep') and Clive Davis fan Kelly Clarkson ('Underneath The Tree'). While Leona earned a coveted 2014 Popjustice Twenty Quid nom­in­a­tion in October by counting down the nights until she could be reunited with her 'boo', Clarko's still promoting her 'Wrapped In Red' album this year with the surprise video release of its title track, in which Kelly sets out her plan to resolve an unre­quited love. To be honest, it's fine by me if the next 12 years see RCA exhaust­ing the album, one song every Q4. However, my Christmas goodwill is in danger of running out if they don't throw a bit more money at future videos. But what else did 2014 have to offer? The Saturdays took on the Waitresses' 'Christmas Wrapping' for the Get Santa soundtrack, a song last 'tackled' by the Spice Girls in 1998 who'd employed some 'creative license' withthe lyrics, gearing them towards a British audience (all-night garages and a rubbish turkey from Tesco). The Sats' take is alto­gether more faithful, with the original lyrics intact, a backing track that closely resembles the original and even an admirable stab at the Waitresses' weary ennui (they sound bored). As I'm sure you're all too aware, the Vengaboys (who else) returned with 'Where Did My Xmas Tree Go?'. The group's lyrics have taken a dark turn, with the sad rev­el­a­tion that Uncle John of 'from Jamaica' infamy is, in fact, dead. Musically, it's business as usual, chirpily craptastic Casio cod-reggae accom­pa­ny­ing the news that ""me uncle John just passed away"" and featuring Kim's alarm­ingly cold reaction: ""now di good times have come here to stay"". There's an album (of course) called 'Xmas Vengaboys Party Album', featuring 'remixes' of past hits from char­ac­ters such as Treësto, Merry Corsten and Carol Cox (DO YOU SEE?!). In each and every case the 'remix' is literally the original with added jingle bells and jocular ""ho ho ho""s — quite incred­ible.  Meanwhile, the Vamps were hoping for snow with new single 'Hoping for Snow'. A launchpad for a budget 'repack' of the group's debut album, the song boasts a Wham!-aping chorus — ""last year, you took a piece of my heart"" — familiar enough for listeners to think ""ah, 'Last Christmas'!"", yet different enough for the band and their pub­lish­ers to rest as soundly as the little lord Jesus, asleep on the hay. Not one to be left out, Bonnie McKee recently 'unleashed' ‘California Winter’, a jaunty number led by a plinky plonky piano. In the Golden State’s cold months, the ‘Last Friday Night (TGIF)’ co-writer dreams of palm trees and explains to her ‘beau’ that even in Q4 “it’s always summer with you” as “your love keeps me warm”. How lovely. Stooshe col­lab­or­at­ors TLC offered the similarly perky ‘Gift Wrapped Kiss’, where T-Boz and Chilli yearn for “the kind of package that comes with a kiss” from “a special kind of gift wrapped man”. Fair play ladies, even if it's December we all have needs. There’s a bizarre post-chorus ‘feat’ from Santa himself, in which the noted communist suggests: “you’ve been a good girl and I know it’s true, let me reach inside my bag and see what I can do"" (!). SANTA, NO. Oh and dog piss surfer Ariana Grande chucked this thing out, Union J plonked a Christmas cover at the end of their new album and 'Sledgehammer' justice deniers Fifth Harmony covered a Mariah classic. Also appar­ently Bob Geldof did another Band Aid thing too. Naturally it met with wide­spread critical acclaim, the lyrics were unprob­lem­atic and Africa was saved. But what of the Q4s of yore, ie pre this more recent burst of Christmas musical cheer? There are a fair few unsung gems from the last ten years that deserve to join pop's carol canon. So, for when 'All I Want for Christmas is You' won't quite do, here's a guide to some Chrimbangerz [THIS STOPS NOW — ED] that are Literally Above Average: Rather than a one-off single, The Aloud went the whole three-bird roast by unleash­ing a tinsel-adorned mini-album as a bonus disc to their finest album 'Chemistry'. With Xenomania at the helm, there was a healthy serving of original songs alongside the covers, with the yearning 'Count the Days' the best of the bunch. Best bit: ""Count the days til this wait is through / come home babe / Christmas just ain't the same without you"" Originally released as a fan club CD in 1997, this four-to-the-floor yuletide ditty was 'retooled' by Marius de Vries for a new EP during the Boys' Yes tour. The song sets out to debunk the following Christmas myths: that it snows, that the TV is any good, that it's fun for all the family. Thankfully there's some respite in the chorus — ""but I'll still have a glow at Christmas / because I'll be with you"" — which is quite sweet. The track also briefly features the spoken word vocals of Chris Lowe, grumpily wishing listeners a happy new year. Best bit: ""It's meant to be goodwill as well as synthetic fun / what is this year's festive number one?"" (per­form­ing in Manchester during Ragegate, Neil exclaimed ""not X Factor!"" after singing this line. Poor Joe.) Readers with syn­es­thesia might exper­i­ence this song as the smell of a) mulled wine, b) poppers and/or c) mulled poppers. Ian Masterson's twinkly electro pro­duc­tion underpins Sara and Keren's trademark deadpan vocals, and while the wistful verses are rel­at­ively serene they soon give way to an explosive, hi-NRG chorus, cul­min­at­ing with the glorious couplet; ""remember how we kissed that time / the mistletoe and too much wine"". This is an absolute cracker. Best bit: ""So baby just stop, stop pulling my heart strings / won't you come back and make my heart sing?"" Also: SLEIGH BELLS! Hurts' Calvin Harris/Alesso col­lab­or­a­tion is very good, but the last truly great Theo and Adam moment was this bleak number in which they 'eschew' the joys of December 25, instead clinging to the hopes of the new year. There are tubular bells. It's quite majestic. Best bit: ""All of the bells ringing out for Christmas / I'm not supposed to feel this way / all that I want this year for Christmas is New Year's day"" :( Mariah's 'sophomore' seasonal album 'Merry Christmas II You' (do you see what she did there?) included not only a ludicrous dance version of 'Auld Lang Syne' and a ""Super Festive"" remake of her most famous hit, but this original com­pos­i­tion. With Jermaine Dupri at the mixing desk, it's one of the best Mariah Careyoke songs of the last ten years. Best bit: ""Ho! Ho! Ho! Santa's gonna come and make you mine this Christmas!"" In which Chris Martin pops to Oxford Street to ""try to right a wrong"", which probably just means he needed to return a cardigan or something. There's an undeni­ably Richard Curtissy feel to this piano-led blubathon, which peaked at a fairly un-festive Number 13 in the singles charts. Best bit: ""When you're still waiting for the snow to fall / doesn't really feel like Christmas at all"" Tracey's Christmas album is very lovely indeed and its opening track is just sublime, explain­ing a childlike Christmas magic from a defiantly optim­istic per­spect­ive. Best bit: ""You loved it as a kid and now you need it more than you ever did / it’s because of the dark, we see the beauty in the spark / that’s why, that's why / the carols make you cry / joy…"" Comments are closed.

153,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/briefing/some-pathetic-glimmers-of-hope-on-a-dark-day-for-pop/," Girls Aloud. They came, they conquered, they went away and came back and conquered a bit more but it wasn't very con­vin­cing because Cheryl had already blown the ending with that bit in her auto­bi­o­graphy, they cleared off again. Anyway it's difficult for all of us so here are some dim, pathetic rays of optimism (trans­la­tion: we're in denial) that we can all cling to in this dark time.  Their statement just says they've come to the end of their incred­ible time together. Maybe they know that the rest of their time together will be pretty mediocre. Maybe there's an average new album on its way. IT'S FINE GIRLS ALOUD, AT THIS STAGE WE'LL TAKE AVERAGE.  However nuanced or gram­mat­ic­ally cavalier one's approach to split state­ments might be, it's extremely unusual (and actually quite difficult) to leave a full stop floating between two words like this. The way this usually happens is if you've deleted the end of a sentence. So we conclude that 'we have now come to the end of our incred­ible time together' actually led to something that either qualified the statement or offered some sort of hope to sad fans. Why was it deleted? What did it say? ""…but maybe we'll meet again in the future""? ""…and as for the future, who knows""? ""…and yes we agree that 'Girl Overboard' should have been a single, sorry about that""? We may never know. Amazing as Girls Aloud might have been in almost too many ways to com­pre­hend, the band never made too many decisions that didn't have a big bag of cash attached. And the bag of cash they'll get for a comeback in 2017 will be a lot bigger if people think they have properly split up. Ideally, for a big reunion to really seem exciting they would have staged a huge falling out, but maybe that's still to come. Just remember, over the coming weeks, months and years: anything that makes it seem like Girls Aloud will never get back together is just a carefully con­struc­ted ruse to make their eventual comeback seem even more exciting (and lucrative). It is essential for most modern celebrit­ies and per­formers to 'recharge' their fame every few years. Cheryl may well be exempt but for Sarah, Kimberley, Nadine and Nicola it's possible that their passions away from the band — however cre­at­ively rewarding they might be — will require a bit of a jumpstart in the coming years. And for these five artists a Girls Aloud tour, single, TV-talent-show-search-for-the-new-Kimberley-because-she's-having-none-of-it or whatever will be the best way to get things moving again. Bring on the sub-units. Is now the time for Chimola to release their debut single? YES. Girls Aloud, the ITV girlband who were probably going to be a crap version of Atomic Kitten, became the Girls Aloud we are sad about losing today because from the very first wobbly guitar twang of 'Sound Of The Underground' their music estab­lished a band identity that allowed each member's per­son­al­ity to even­tu­ally — during the second album campaign — flourish and make sense. Well Brian Higgins has not split up. He still exists as a music-making person. All we really need is one song a year that's as good as 'Call The Shots' and life will be man­age­able. It seemed pretty clear that 'Beautiful 'Cause You Love Me' was the band's favourite among the new songs from 'Ten'. But 'Beautiful 'Cause You Love Me' was not exactly what anyone wanted from a Girls Aloud single. This makes us nervous about what a full studio album might have been like. The first Nicola album laid the found­a­tions for a future mas­ter­piece. Cheryl delivers at least one great song with each album campaign. Pop will be a worse place without Nadine's extraordin­ary vocals. Kimberley seems to have 'found her groove', as it were. And the world is surely crying out for a Run For Your Wife sequel. Actually, let's be honest, that's not the worst idea of all time. ""If you love someone set them free,"" Sting once sang. Well fuck you Sting. You didn't know the pain we are feeling today. You never had to deal with losing Girls Aloud. The thing is, would it really be so bad to lock up Girls Aloud and force them to make an album a year for the rest of their lives? Obviously there are a few moral grey areas we'd need to look into here but come on, where's the real harm in this? We'll put them in a house, keep them fed and watered, and everything will be as fine as long as they sing for us. SING FOR US GIRLS ALOUD. DON'T LEAVE US. DON'T LEAVE US. NOT NOW. NOT LIKE THIS. Sometimes pop just has to move on, and this is one of those times. Farewell Girls Aloud. You were extremely good for an extremely long time, and you made us extremely happy.  :( ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912203548.81/warc/CC-MAIN-20190325031213-20190325053213-00128.warc.gz

You'll know that she's written and produced her own music. You'll know that she called herself SoSo for a bit, too, but you might not know that in the time since we first wrote about her — around the time of 2008's 'Laptop Diaries' — she's also been calling herself other things, secretly writing Billboard Number Ones with Max Martin. To cut a long story short, she's quite a woman. Her new mini-album 'Freudian Slip', out today and streaming below, is abso­lutely brilliant. She's worked with outside producers for the first time, pulling in names like Patrik Berger (Robyn, Lorde, Lana) and Michel Flygare and Tobias Jimson (Zara Larsson, Tove Lo, Madonna), but where some artists lose their focus when they let others in you'll hear that these hand­picked col­lab­or­at­ors have only exag­ger­ated the clarity of Sophia's pop vision. Here's the stream — we asked Sophia for some of her thoughts on the songs and you'll find those under­neath. They make for 'quite a read'. Sophia writes: ""This album is an important milestone in my life both per­son­ally and artist­ic­ally. It’s about craving change. Wanting to be hit hard and reminded of what it feels to be alive. To break free from ill-fitting ideas of myself that I have grown out of, but became so used to identi­fy­ing with that I’ve held myself back. Most of the songs on this album started out as impro­visa­tions over the music — I just sang something and  when I listened back to what I’d said I was often surprised by how pro­foundly truthful I had been without meaning to be. That’s why it’s called 'Freudian Slip'. Accidentally insight­ful. Clumsily candid. Some of the songs have been active wishes for something. Like 'Klein Blue', wanting to be iden­ti­fied as something other than dark and broken; wanting to be light and vibrant and par­ti­cip­at­ing. Or 'Mouth To Mouth', were I am literally asking the universe to take me hard, shake me up, save my life. In both cases, I have gotten what I asked for. The universe has answered. 'Amphetamine' is a con­fes­sion of sorts as well — I talk about my ADD, how I sometimes just want an easy fix, and how the world doesn’t have time for the indi­vidual. It only treats masses. One size fits all and for the ones who don’t fit — 'fix them'. The irony of dulling the side affects of a super­power with med­ic­a­tion out of laziness instead of learning how to use it properly. They system isn’t made for us. That’s why it’s important to stay on your own case. Rage against the machine, stay brilliant and insane. 'Sapphire' and 'A Million Songs' started out being about something (I thought) and then, in ret­ro­spect, I realized they were about something else. I had processed something sub­con­sciously in writing the songs that my heart and active mind hadn’t caught up with yet. The man in the music video for 'Sapphire', for example, was at the time my fiancé of 6 years and we acted out the story of the song. Just weeks after, we went our separate ways. It had become a story about us. It had become real. Self expres­sion through art is a powerful thing. It’s a direct medium to the truth. Lastly, 'The Last Summer' is about finally growing up. It's about starting to live in the person you have spent so much time designing. If my twenties were about figuring everything out in theory, then my thirties are for prac­tic­ally living life. I am ready to be real.""

155,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/briefing/ten-features-we-want-in-the-lady-gaga-ipad-app/," As you may have read, Lady Gaga's upcoming album 'ARTPOP' will be accom­pan­ied by some sort of app. She's written quite an extensive note about it here. (We like the bit where she says digital music is over­priced then goes on to say she'd like to work with Apple.) Anyway she explains among other things that it'll work across various platforms, but it seems fair to assume that its natural home will be a touch­screen tablet. So here are some features we have decided are vital to the success of the 'ARTPOP' app. 1. A song that never ends
Let's have a song — let's called it 'The Infinite' — which just goes on forever. It would be like our amazing 45-minute version of 'Alejandro', but would last a lifetime. Fans would stage events all around the world where they listened to 'The Infinite' for days, weeks, months on end. One fan, whose Twitter name would probably have 'HausOf' in it somewhere, would actually devote his entire life to listening to 'The Infinite'. 2. Angry Madonnas  3. Telephone
This is basically Skype-type func­tion­al­ity built into the app, but you can't call anyone with it. What's the point? Well, imagine browsing the 'ARTPOP' app one day, when the music suddenly drops out. A message appears on the screen. 'GAGA CALLING'. You press 'answer'. And on the other end of the line is Lady Gaga. She's called for a chat! After a few minutes she says her goodbyes. That would be pretty incred­ible. We suppose this feature has a bit of a 'golden ticket' element to it. We reckon Gaga would need to make one call a day for this feature to be useful. Maybe the audio from each call could instantly be published to the user's Littlemonsters.com page? 4. A song that changes every time you listen to it
What you'd be wanting here is something like this Gwilym Gold album, but confined to one song only because a whole album that didn't know if it was coming or going would probably get on your tits after a while. The important factor here is that Lady Gaga should never release 'her' version of the song — there should never be a defin­it­ive version. The song should be regarded as an organism. 5. A sound­board
A simple way to play out famous Lady Gaga phrases. ""Paws up!"" ""I was born this way!"" ""I will look you in your eyes and tell you that I am not dumb enough or moronic enough to think that you are dumb enough or moronic enough not to see that I would have stolen a melody!"" 6. The full album somehow bundled with the app
In her note about the app Lady Gaga said that it would have a similar price to an album. We'd be happy for this app to go for something like £9.99 as long as it included some sort of con­ven­tional download of the album's sound files, otherwise fans are going to effect­ively buy the album twice, and surely that's not what Gaga or her man­age­ment have in mind. SURELY. 7. A song that is com­pletely personal to each and every listener
Let's say the song is called 'I AM ARTPOP'. This is a bit like the sug­ges­tion in point four, except the random factor is removed. Instead, the listener inputs various inform­a­tion about them­selves — their date of birth, their house number, their lucky number, their eye colour, their shoe size or whatever. The app then uses this data to generate a com­pletely unique version of 'I AM ARTPOP' for every listener. It's their personal version of the song. The song can be exported to be used as ringtones, doorbell chimes and so on. It's offered to the world com­pletely copyright free; Gaga takes no ownership of the music as the music essen­tially belongs to the person whose life pro­grammed the song. Naturally there would be some sort of place probably on Littlemonsters.com where you could upload your song, download other versions and so on, but it would be important that there is no way to vote for a favourite, to click a 'Like' button or whatever, because all fans should be regarded as equals etc etc. 8. All the bits of all the songs
Acapellas, drums, synths, more synths, a deranged choir, the sound of a vacuum cleaner being thrown through a patio window, the whole lot. Play one bit, play everything except the lute solo, tinker to your heart's content. This is fairly standard we suppose but it would be good anyway. 9. The 'I don't speak German but I can if you like' trans­la­tion feature
This includes sound­files of various key phrases — ""where is the train station?"", ""if you're a strong female you don't need per­mis­sion"", ""twelve frank­furters please, I wish to wear them as a hat""  trans­lated into German. Useful if traveling abroard. (Specifically to Germany.) 10. InstGagaram
Take a picture of someone and apply a series of filters — 'rendered in Word then pho­to­graphed on a laptop screen for texture', 'meat dress', 'Kermit shroud' and so on. Look we know it's not reas­on­able to expect all of these features but if she could sort out six or seven we and she could have a 'Pad romance.

156,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/briefing/thank-u-next-an-event-video-in-search-of-a-point/,"After a LOT of teasing — remember 2012? Great days —  Ariana Grande's thank u, next video is out and it's totally efficient. For an event video, it's also curiously unevent­ful. It's not without its GIFable moments, and you can expect Troye Sivan being shoved into some lockers to land in your timeline soon, along with Kris Jenner waving around a camcorder. Will this video break records? Probably. Also, top marks for deliv­er­ing a video that has a logical reason to include Santa outfits, in December, for a song that has nothing to do with Christmas. Beyond all that, the video feels strangely unsat­is­fy­ing. Movies aren't homaged or ref­er­enced — they're recreated, but with no clear reason why in either the song's lyrics or the video's narrative thread. There are some lightly amusing parts, but nothing you'd say was actually funny. The Amusing Event Video against which all AEVs should be judged still feels like it's Katy Perry's Last Friday Night (TGIF). It has a few things in common with thank u next — there are cameos, it's nostalgic, it brings a song to life in an unex­pec­ted way. But Perry's video is also smart (Corey Feldman's Lost Boys reference, for instance, is almost so subtle that it goes by unnoticed), warm (the rein­ven­tion of Rebecca Black!) and genuinely funny (""I got some crazy text from Uncle Kenny who said he was going to start playing the sax again"") in a way thank u, next kind of isn't. Maybe the biggest 'this doesn't quite work' element, however, is that as a song thank u, next was something that arrived out of nowhere, when Ariana should have still been promoting her previous album, and became one of the year's biggest songs. It subtly rein­ven­ted what big pop acts are supposed to do. So a big-budget, heavily trailed and ulti­mately under­whelm­ing event video feels like a small step back, in a year that's otherwise seen Ariana taking huge, bold steps forward.

No, No, No…' leaked on the web at around 2.21 this morning. Within hours there was a dodgy video on YouTube with the song over someone else's video… httpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbvGf0BFruk
…and seven pages of chatter on the Popjustice forum. Here are some bits of what's being said. ""Once again Girls Aloud and Xenomania deliver something completly left-field."" ""Parts of it sound like Klaxons and Betty Boo having a musical gangbang."" ""I love it. And I'm not even pre­tend­ing to like it in the same way I did with 'Long Hot Summer'."" ""Can't wait to have this blaring in my car. I want to go driving now."" ""It is a freaking amazing track, but we all have to admit that it's not as radio friendly or instant as 'Something Kinda Ooooh' — therefore it will have a hard time to grow into the massive hit that the Aloud need to launch their 4th album."" ""It is all over the place, but there are moments of per­fec­tion.  The intro is fantastic, I wish they'd do an entire song like that."" ""Nicola's bit is the best! Again!"" ""Oh my fucking God! I'm literally sitting here GASPING at how amazing it is."" ""Please tell me I'm not the only one who has had this on repeat for over an hour now…"" ""It's refresh­ing that Nadine doesn't have the opening lines."" ""I have it on repeat too, and I still can't figure out the fucking lyrics."" ""It's abso­lutely brilliant: chaotic yet with clear direction, sexy and dirty and classy all at once, fantastic vocal deliv­er­ies by Nadine and Nicola, and the intro sort of makes you want to jump off a bridge, it's the perfect pop single! For heaven''s sakes, can they do something terrible for once?"" ""The intro sounds like a man."" ""Loud and messy and hookless but good."" ""What's fairly amusing is that this track is going to peak at #73 or something terrible on last.fm — the track certainly sets the record for most possible incorrect tags…"" ""It isn't as catchy as Biology, or most of their singles really, and the intro just sounds wrong — but apart from that it is a number one…"" ""I LIKE XENOMANIA SO MUCH."" ""Nicola gets the best line. Not that I know what she's singing."" ""Not to piss all over the parade here but its not as amazing as most of you want to believe. I know most of you are not going to agree with me but when I first heard the track it sounded dead horrible. After a few listens I noticed what stood out (in a positive way) and what was dragging the track down. In my opinion the intro­duc­tion is the best thing about the song."" ""Too much Nadine as usual and it's quite risky with the general public, but it's a great indic­a­tion of what to expect from the album."" ""I am not exag­ger­at­ing when I say that this is my dream Girls Aloud track."" ""I don't get what is so amazing about it, it's not as instantly catchy as Something Kinda Oooh but give me a few more listens when I am fully awake and I'm sure I will be loving it."" [Added three minutes later] ""*EDIT* Already love it! It's like they have gone back to their original times and it really is what I wanted them to come back with!""

But… A few listens in and its good, not as good as SKO mind, but good."" ""Hopefully the proper version will have much more of a bass line and the hook will made more dominant. At best it's a grower. At worst, it sounds like some session singers singing over a [generic] dance act."" ""I was in love with it right from the first listen.

160,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/briefing/the-eight-highlights-of-mutya-keisha-siobhans-slightly-odd-flatline-video/118803/,"Mutya Keisha Siobhan's 'Flatline' is a sad song about the end of a rela­tion­ship wrapped up in a pretty melody. Siobhan's first verse is about a drunken argument and the chorus is about a rela­tion­ship dying, before Mutya sings about the fact that even crying through all the pain won't make it right during the second verse. All this makes the sun-dappled, Instagram-filtered, beach-modelling, arm-waggling, high-fashion video — which 'premiered' at midnight last night/this morning/whatever — pretty baffling, the whole thing screaming 'WE'RE NOT MOODY AND ALOOF ANYMORE YOU GUYS' while losing a bit of what makes them special. It's not bad, per se, it just doesn't really help the song and weirdly has the feel of a behind the scenes video of a music video — or, worse, a behind the scenes video of a pho­toshoot. In fact, the director, KT Auleta, is primarily a fashion pho­to­grapher. Still, the first video to feature Siobhan, Mutya and Keisha together since 2001's 'Soul Sound' (basic premise: three girls house-sitting for a rich family friend), is worth cel­eb­rat­ing, so here are the Top 8 moments.  I'm not sure what sort of hat this is to be honest. Is it just a fancy beret, worn at a jaunty angle? It certainly has the whiff of something French. Regardless, not everyone can 'rock' a hat and Keisha does it very well, so credit where credit is due.  In a lot of ways, Mutya is the real star of the show here. Whether it's carrying her shoes while trying to run across boiling hot sand, or peering over mirrored sunglasses, you can't take your eyes off her. There's a great bit where a normal member of the public is beckoned over to the 'girls' and Mutya does a really exuberant double-high five that involves an often under-used backfoot-propelled launch. Siobhan, as you can see, can only stand back and admire.  There are a lot of extras in the video, most of them only appearing briefly before another edit jumps in and shows us some more arm-waggling (more on that later). So I could have picked the man in his pyjamas who does a handstand, or the small child that gets a wave from Keisha when they're all sat on a motorbike thing, but the real star is the man at the popcorn/ice cream stand who waves at  the camera behind an oblivious Siobhan. Take a bow young man.  I mean, come on.  ""BYE BABES"".  The director's, er, dir­ec­tions for this video seem to have been, 'when in doubt, just put your arms in the air'. It happens a lot. Sometimes they all do it unison, with both arms.  Sometimes one of them will put both hands in the air, while the other two only raise one, and during one awful moment, Siobhan forgets and doesn't do it at all, choosing instead to point her arms downwards. :(   All videos would be improved by an unex­pec­ted marching band, spe­cific­ally if they suddenly arrive in a desert scenario. This is the only part of the video that calls for any real 'acting', with the three 'girls' looking shocked before jumping out of the car and joining in for some mum dancing and general jumping up and down. There's a lot of arm-waving in this section.  Just as Siobhan (sensible des­ig­nated driver incarnate) drives the car over the crest of the hill, she suddenly hits the brakes as if she's seen something terrible. What has she seen? Perhaps we will find out in the band's next video. TO BE CONTINUED. ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202131.54/warc/CC-MAIN-20190319203912-20190319225912-00354.warc.gz
161,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/briefing/the-eoghan-quigg-album-its-turned-out-not-to-be-very-good/48908/," When people say that the best album of all time is Michael Jackson's 'Thriller', they tend not to mean that the best album of all time actually is 'Thriller'. 'Thriller' is nominated as the best album of all time, again and again, because it is an album which people can agree is the best album of all time, even if they indi­vidu­ally feel that another album really deserves the title. ""I per­son­ally think that 'Nevermind' is the best album of all time,"" the logic might go, ""but 'Thriller' is clearly an amazing album, and I really don't  think I could argue that it isn't the best album of all time."" It might be a cliche that 'Thriller' is the best album ever, but in all ser­i­ous­ness what else are you going to choose? Well, the worst album of all time has been less easy to identify but from this week onwards, decades into the future, Eoghan Quigg's album 'Eoghan Quigg' will be the one that scoops the accolade. It will take on a sense of legendary badness. Its badness will become a cliche, trotted out on terrible 'talking heads' TV shows. But, as with 'Thriller', what else will it be  possible for people to choose? 'Eoghan Quigg' is sort of the anti-'Thriller' — a record which manages to be as bad as Michael Jackson's opus is good.  Those of you who have not yet heard 'Eoghan Quigg' might rightly be thinking that this album was always going to be bad, and that it's unfair to single out this sort of album — quickly recorded in the wake of X Factor success — as being worse than any of the other X Factor, Pop Idol or Fame Academy albums. Well you're right that this was always going to be a bad album, but only in Simon
Cowell's wildest night­mares was 'Eoghan Quigg' ever going to be quite as bad as the
reality unleashed on record stores this week. It's a badness that sometimes feels
as if it could tear a hole in the fabric of time
and space. What we will say is this: listen to the album. Then, and only then, will you be able to really under­stand how inter­galactic­ally bad 'Eoghan Quigg' really is. Imagine the three worst reality pop albums you have ever heard. Let's pick the Michelle McManus album, the David Sneddon album and the Journey South album. Imagine the combined badness of all those albums, then somehow imagine that ALL per­son­al­ity has been sucked out out. Then imagine that they kept on sucking, long after there all per­son­al­ity was gone, until there was a sort of per­son­al­ity prolapse. You are still only half way to under­stand­ing just how empty these record­ings are.  To clarify, it is not shit in the same way that some people (not us) might say that Same
Difference or Shayne Ward record­ings are shit. It is the sort of shit that even
the most delib­er­ately obtuse, most tra­gic­ally deluded and self-defensive
pro-pop evan­gel­ist would have to call shit. And it sounds cheap. So very, very cheap. 'Eoghan Quigg' — an album so ines­cap­ably awful that when coming to the title only the words 'eoghan' and 'quigg' were capable of sum­mar­ising its shod­di­ness — sounds like it will have recouped all recording costs after selling four copies. It is an album entirely without merit, recorded so cheaply and with
such little regard for the art of pop that the final product simply
does not count as music, and should not be included in the album chart. It is just as well that this album was not out in time for Mother's Day, because it would only have been a suitable Mother's Day present if your mother was Hitler. Listen to the album in full at Spotify — here's the direct link  — and tell us we're wrong.

162,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/briefing/the-five-major-merch-opportunities-from-troye-sivans-lucky-strike-video/,"Troye Sivan has just premiered his best-ever pop video and that's all very well but the real question is this: what impact could the Lucky Strike audi­ovi­su­lar extra­vag­anza have on the mil­len­nial pop elf's future merch stands? Let's find out.  If Kylie can get away with it there's no reason Troye Sivan can't flog red cushions for — and this is a con­ser­vat­ive estimate — £18 a throw. Maybe he could literally also sell matching throws for £18 a throw.  This item's appear­ance in the video sort of points to the fact that towels with ladies' bottoms on them already exist, but this is actually ideal because there need be no initial expense in terms of design, R&D and so on. Towels can be ordered in bulk at wholesale prices and there's no reason absorbent beach ponchos can't fetch upwards of £25.  This would actually be a really good t-shirt design were it not for the fact that it could be mistaken for a gunshot wound and might therefore be seen as being in slightly poor taste. A bit of forward-planning from the wardrobe depart­ment, making the stain more clearly in a heart shape, could have avoided this problem. It's all about attention to detial.  Before moving on with the squishy com­ment­ary it's very important to state here that the 'attention to detial' typo above was an exquis­itely con­struc­ted joke, and not a mistake. Anyway: heart-shaped squishies could easily go for £10 on a merch stand, if you take into account the idea that normal non-merch squishies are getting on for that price anyway even though they clearly cost about nine pence to make. Massive margins to be had here. In fact why not chuck in a free Troye Sivan fidget spinner while you're at it?  A big statement parasol, where the statement is ""I have sensitive skin and/or am mindful of what harm the sun's rays can cause, and also I am either quite-to-very gay or an ally whose allyship stretches to the com­pletely unreas­on­able sum of £68 for a fabric umbrella"". Actually this isn't the proper rainbow flag colour scheme is it? No matter: people at gigs are in such a state of euphoria that they'll be halfway home with this beast before they even realise. Lots of money to be made with this one.  You could have 100 people in a room and even the one who wanted to see Lady Gaga in a film wouldn't guess that the  Lucky Strike video was made 'in col­lab­or­a­tion with' (thanks to a pile of cash from) popular file hosting company Dropbox. Hard to see how this might extend to a merch stand. Cardboard boxes? Filing cabinets? Actually, a Troye Sivan-branded Bisley would be pretty special. This is Popjustice's 2019 merch dream: a Troye Bisley. Would pay £80. This is not a joke. There is £80 here for anyone who can man­u­fac­ture a high quality Troye Sivan filing cabinet.

If you're the sort of music listener who consumes albums by dragging, dropping, ordering and chopping — which is to say, you're a sensible person who creates playlist edits of new albums because life is short and albums are long — don't allow yourself to think your first edit is the final edit, because the song you thought was boring might suddenly become very non-boring indeed. 2. If you're a popstar, and by popstar we mean the sort of popstar with a sense of adventure, a fluid approach to the creative process, and a surplus of ideas, and by that we mean 'not Liam Payne', try to remember that you can breathe new life into a song in ways vastly more exciting than 'whacking out an acoustic version for Spotify numbers' or 'throwing thousands of quid at Cheat Codes or R3HAB and hoping for the best, for Spotify numbers'. (When this new version of Slow Disco first emerged a few weeks back, Vinco explained that ""I always felt this song could wear many different outfits and live many different lives. Here she is in disco pants, sweating on a New York dance­floor."") 3. If you're Robyn and you don't release a new Robyn single, someone else is just going to step in and release a Robyn single for you. 4. If you work for a record label please view Fast Slow Disco as per­mis­sion to rein­vig­or­ate the grand and much-missed pop tradition of 'the single version', aka 'the radio edit', aka 'let's stick a rocket up this and watch it go'. 5. If you're going out this weekend, please seriously consider crowd­surf­ing over a lot of high-spirited chaps in a gentlemen's club, because on the evidence laid out here it looks like a lot of fun.

164,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/briefing/the-important-matter-of-comparing-all-one-direction-solo-launch-singles-via-a-graph/," It's hard to say how long One Direction's ""hiatus"" will last, but it seems safe to assume that it will go on for at least as long as it takes for each of the band's members to launch solo careers. With this in mind, and taking into account the fact that it's both fair and deeply important to judge artists against each other, we'll be keeping track of the five members' launch singles in one handy graph. When the final member releases his first single, we will add a picture of one balloon to the graph, to signify PARTYTIME. Launch singles will be graded according to a number of factors which will then be fed into a complex equation in order to arrive at a final score. Leaks will not be counted but 'teaser songs' may be included depending on the severity of the marketing activity around their appear­ance. MALIK
The year is 2016, and the bit of that year is January. Having pulled off the boyband equi­val­ent of fans leaving an arena show before the encore in order to avoid a rush at the tube station, Zayn Malik dEbUts 'Pillowtalk'. It exceeds expect­a­tions, sounds incred­ibly 2016 but doesn't forget to have a chorus, has a very exciting first one second, and reveals that Zayn's seduction technique tends to involve kicking things off with a cry of ""climb on board"". In fact there is only one problem with the song: the fact that it, or at least the album that followed, should have been called 'Reckless Behaviour'.

'This Town' is a surprise release, in its delivery (it appears suddenly on September 30 2016) if not in its content (stripped-back acoustic). When unveiling the Greg Kurstin-produced pens­ive­banger, Niall tells the world: ""I'm excited to announce I have signed a record deal with Capitol Records USA and released my first solo song. Thank you to all the One Direction fans for your love and support as always. I'm looking forward to the next part of this journey together."" 'This Town' is a song that sounds terrible on paper but ends up being rather spell­bind­ing in real life and slightly exceeds expect­a­tions, but could have done with a tropical remix. STYLES

165,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/briefing/the-jepsellephant-in-the-room/,"As you know, Carly Rae Jepsen released two new songs this week: Now That I Found You and No Drug Like Me. If you find them on Spotify you'll notice they've been bundled with Party For One in a sort of three-song EP format. A 3P, if you will. It's a Carly Rae J3Psingle.  On January 18, CRJ posted this on her Facebook page: This week- not unlike weeks before I stressed right out about song selection and instead of going nuts, called my trusty friend/ guitarist Tavish Crowe who helped me dig to the bottom of some 100 plus songs. (More like 200). This process happened w Kiss and emotion and I want to give cheers to the truth that asking for help when you need it is never a bad thing. I find that it’s strong to know your weak­nesses. Needless to say we have a favs list now and a song order and he’s the one friend I turn to when I need to hear my OWN opinion still cause he lets me battle it out without weighing in to hard but instead, con­tinu­ally asking- what feels right to you??! So hold tight loves. I’m re- learning lessons I need to and short­l­ist­ing this bad boy for your pretty ears. Thanks for patience. Here a pic to remind me of the wishful thing I was before over writing and over thinking things. Soon I think, we get to dance. So what we're looking at here is a situation where Carly Rae Jepsen has a pile of up to 200 songs, and the best ones are the two she's released this week: Now That I Found You and No Drug Like Me.  How does that make you feel? How does it sit with you that from up to 200 songs sitting around on Carly Rae Jepsen's hard drives, those two are the best? First: a note about 'best'. People who work in pop have different, confusing and sometimes con­flict­ing ideas about what 'best' means, but it doesn't always (or often!) mean best best. The best song for the moment can just as often mean 'best to get streaming numbers back up' and 'best to fit in with the pop landscape right now', or 'best to act as a bridge and get us to a point where we can do something else'. Popstars sometimes don't ever release their best best songs. Still, the fact is that Now That I Found You and No Drug Like Me have been deemed the right songs to release right now. Best in some way, for some reason. Another note, before we continue: as we all know, the 'pick songs from a pile of hundreds' idea hasn't always brought Carly Rae Jepsen's best best songs to the surface on the first or even second attempt. Cut To The Feeling missed the cut on both E•MO•TION and the sub­sequent E•MO•TION: Side B album, meaning it was passed over not just once but twice. Which makes you wonder — of that par­tic­u­lar batch of songs, what else never made it out? And now the meat of the situation: neither of these two new CRJ songs is great. Come on. It's okay, you can let it all out. You're among friends.  Both songs are fine! Both are better than bad! But they're not Jeppo great. They're not Run Away With Me or Your Type. They're not the songs you would play someone to show them that, hey, perhaps they need to think twice about the person who made Call Me Maybe and perhaps they also need to rethink their thoughts about what pop and popstars can do. The most troubling thing about Now That I Found You is that it's the sort of thing people who don't listen to Carly Rae Jepsen think Carly Rae Jepsen songs sound like. And this week, they're right. There's a lot to unpack among all this: per­sist­ent questions about whether everyone or anyone in Camp Jeppo has ever really under­stood exactly how and why E•MO•TION did what it did and was what it was, whether goodwill and support from the more leftfield side of the media was help or hindrance, whether The Jeppsinator herself hears her music and likes the same things the rest of us do. There's also the question of whether niche success (which in 2019 is still quite a lot of success) is enough for Carly and her team or if, as the Spotpop-friendly sound of something like Party For One suggests, the ambition and aim is to move her on from her current position by crossing over into a less idio­syn­cratic pop space. It'll be inter­est­ing to see and hear what lies ahead for Carly Rae Jepsen as 2019 plays out. One surprise so far is that on the evidence of what's already out there she's not taking things back in the sonic direction of 2008's pre-Call Me Maybe album Tug Of War, which felt as if it was one of the ways things could end up panning out. It'd be good to hear that one day. Maybe that's still on the planner for sometime in the future. Maybe she doesn't want to go back there at all! Who knows. For the time being, the frus­trat­ing thing is that you know, somewhere in that pile of 100–200 songs, there's probably the perfect Carly Rae Jepsen album for right now: an album full of her best songs and her best best songs. And you know that for whatever reason, half that brilliant album's songs could easily end up staying in the pile forever.

166,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/briefing/the-jungle-is-about-to-be-massive/115482/," It's not every day we get excited about a new girlband — it's more like every two to three days — but new RCA four-piece Neon Jungle are just a little bit special. They are (left to right in the picture above) Jess, Asami, Shereen and Amira, they're from various parts of the UK, and the exper­i­ence of being in a room with them feels a bit like what people always used to bang on about when they described being taken hostage by the Spice Girls. In a nutshell, they are 'quite a handful' but also 'quite good'. You may recognise them from the 'Here's your next favourite girlband' post we published in April, which included this Vine of the band per­form­ing at a Sony pissup.  That chap in the red cap doesn't look very impressed, does he? Well that chap in the red cap is a fuckwit because Neon Jungle are AMAZING X100, and their first single, 'Trouble', is one of the smartest and most unusual debut singles in recent girlband history. It's written and produced by two Popjustice favour­ites Anita Blay (ie CocknBullKid) and Ben Berry (ie Fear Of Tigers) and like the recent Big Song from Megan & Liz it's not exactly unlike Icona Pop's 'I Love It'. (We think a lot of songs this year will use that tune as a jumping-off point.) But rather than being a cupcakes-and-rainbows version of 'I Love it' softened up for a major label girlband, the lyrics, pro­duc­tion and overall hysteria of the tune feel even harder. It's fresh and fiercely elec­tronic without being 'EDM', with a chorus of ""I don't look for trouble but trouble looks for me, and it's been waiting around corners since I was 17"". It's basically mental. Here's another clip of them doing it live, at last month's Future Hits Live event. ""Hey hey"" indeed. Want to see Neon Jungle moving around a bit more? Here they are in the studio.  The best thing about Neon Jungle is that they don't feel like the sort of band who've been invented as an easy copy of something that's already in the charts, but nor do they seem like  a straight­for­ward reaction against what's out there. Obviously they're stage-managed to a certain degree — the best girlbands always are — and 'Trouble' is about as subtle as Christopher Maloney in a spraytan booth when it comes to pos­i­tion­ing them as the sort of girlband your parents might be a bit iffy about, but being with them and listening to their music and seeing them dick around on Twitter and Instagram it all feels quite instinct­ive and spon­tan­eous, meaning that the band feels fun and reckless in a way Little Mix never will. ALSO: There's no endless dicking around with 'limited releases' and 'buzz singles' and all that sort of endless balls-free, fence-sitting taste­m­ak­ing shit that bands like WooWoos or Kitchen Party or whatever they're calling them­selves today get bogged down with. Just a day one, straight-out-of-the-traps, like-it-or-fuck-off pop banger. Basically we love this band and their music is really good. THE END. » Neon Jungle on Soundcloud (there's nothing there yet)

167,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/briefing/the-new-pj-almighty-marina-madonna-tori-kelly-sharks-et-al/," It has been 'quite a while' since we did a new PJ Almighty on Popjustice. For those of you who don't recall, it's a list of amazing popstars (with a shit pop thing at the bottom). At the very start of the year, in a piece about popstars' imperial phases, we wondered which acts might enter their imperial phase in 2015. ""Marina looked like she had the potential to enter an imperial phase,"" we wrote, ""but we’re not convinced the ‘FROOT’ campaign to date has laid appro­pri­ately robust found­a­tions."" Actually, that was a load of shit. With the added context of 'I'm A Ruin' it's clear that what's actually happening now is the metic­u­lously orches­trated rebirth of an actual pop superstar. And it's very exciting. Marina's official site Pop needs a new superstar and Tori may be just that. She's been knocking around for a few years, she can be quite good on Twitter, and her backstory's full of stuff like American Idol auditions, self-released music and a record deal at the age of twelve, but having signed with Scooter Braun she's now on Capitol Records. Tori's been working with Toby Gad, Pharrell Williams and Ed Sheeran (mind you who hasn't) and her new single, 'Nobody Love', was co-written with MAX FUCKING MARTIN. Given all that, and over a million YouTube sub­scribers, the new song's off to a sur­pris­ingly slow start on YouTube — 60,000 views in two days doesn't feel like much — but you get the impres­sion that when they properly push the button on Tori's career the whole thing could easily go berserk. As for 'Nobody Love' itself: it seems to position Tori somewhere between Ariana Grande and Jessie J. Tori on Twitter Kygo's one of our favourite remixer-type people at the moment (this Seinabo Sey one's good, as is this Kyla La Grange one — it doesn't really matter which one you listen to because all his stuff sounds the same) but his own tune 'Firestone' is also really really great. The song's been around since last year but we saw someone on Twitter saying that it's getting a proper UK push in the coming months so that's nice. (It's already on iTunes if you want to buy it.) Kygo on SoundCloud Katy dances with them and Rihanna is relaxed about being eaten by them but the Sharks we're most inter­ested in are the Swedish duo whose MAX FUCKING MARTIN co-written single 'Wait', released last year, is basically a super­charged Icona Pop tune. We were thinking about Susanna and Sophia the other day and wondering if right about now might be a good time for a new single. Maybe a hundred or so words on a UK pop website will force the issue. Anytime in the next week or so would be fine, cheers. Sharks on Twitter We're standing by what we said on Twitter the other week: we'll look back on 'Rebel Heart', once we've all deleted the nonsense off iTunes, as a great ten-track album. MAYBE EVEN A GREAT TWELVE-TRACK ALBUM. Madonna on — where else — Instagram  It's tra­di­tional, in the days that follow the Grammys, to find oneself increas­ingly frus­trated as due to copyright nonsense each YouTube clip, each Daily Motion clip and finally every other piece of video footage capturing the evening's per­form­ances dis­ap­pears from the internet. This year, we're not feeling quite so sad about how hard it is to relive Grammy per­form­ances, because if it means there's zero chance of acci­dent­ally clicking on Jessie and Tom honking their way through 'You've Lost That Lovin’ Feelin’', it's a sacrifice worth making.

170,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/briefing/the-vmas-blow-by-blow-in-excruciating-detail/," Posters like the one above have been all over Los Angeles for the last few weeks. There are others where the 'Pablo The Blowfish' hitmaker straddles her own tongue or looks as though her stomach's being consumed by flesh-eating cartoon insects. They all seem to suggest that this year's MTV VMAs — a show that Miley desec­rated in the eyes of literally no well-balanced people two years ago, and is now present­ing — will be a gonzo, anarchic and con­tro­ver­sial LOLfest. The truth, as is the way with these sorts of things, is slightly different. For a start the MTV VMAs take place in what looks like a cinema in a sort of precinct bit near a massive indoor arena. To get there you have to walk past various chain res­taur­ants and bars and flustered touts. Obviously in an ideal world all pop music would exist in some other realm away from normality, and away from heavily-sponsored atmo­sphere-free emporia, but we don't live in an ideal world. There is, however, something exciting about the fact that somewhere within this innocuous-looking building, Taylor Swift's rehears­ing her various accept­ance speeches, perhaps while sur­roun­ded by some close friends.  So yes, the cinema. Well it's not a cinema but as you go up the escalator onto the first floor it basically becomes a cinema lobby.  This was quite a popular site for a selfie, as you can imagine. (Selfies in America are tire­lessly organised and metic­u­lously crafted — one guy made his friend check the picture he'd taken twelve times before they could move on to pho­to­graph­ing their dinner). Here's a photo of my dinner.  Well, this was just the starter. If you had a fancy shiny wristband all the food and drink was free and, dear readers, I had a fancy shiny wristband. With drinks and food collected and partially consumed I decided to start my maiden MTV VMAs odyssey. The anti­cip­a­tion was high: would I witness three female popstars kissing while dressed as brides? Would a popstar reveal their pregnancy live onstage? Would a rapper frighten a defence­less popstar by sug­gest­ing that perhaps another popstar deserved the award more? Would said popstar then allow the defence­less popstar to come out onstage and accept the award properly? Would a female popstar arrive dressed as a man? Or maybe in a dress made of char­cu­terie? Whatever was about to happen I had a feeling that there would be surprises (ideally involving Rihanna and a new album, but this is just a pipe dream of course). 4:15 I march over to my seat to survey my sur­round­ings. I take a picture. I then get asked to leave as they aren't supposed to allow anyone in. It's an aus­pi­cious start. 
4:22 Earlier outside the venue harassed looking record label employees were handing out placards with 'What Do You Mean?' written across them. Inside I overhear a confused dad trying to interact with kids holding the placards. ""Are there any other questions?"" one asks. ""Well, what's the answer?"" Indeed. 4:35 Courtney Love wanders past me with two guys in ridicu­lous linen outfits. She seems to be heading towards the same seats as me, perhaps banished from the famous people seats after she threw her MAC compact at Madonna twenty years ago. 4:58 After my initial faux pas I decide to head into the arena again. There's a remix of 'Bad Blood' playing, which then morphs into Kygo's very good remix of Seinabo Sey's 'Younger'. 5:14 To be honest it's around this point that I start to regret arriving so early. I start playing games on my phone to pass the time. 5:17 That DJ Snake remix of AlunaGeorge's 'You Know You Like It' comes on. Whatever happened to AlunaGeorge? There was that new song a little while ago and then nothing. Shame really. It starts to feel like a very strange club, with really loud EDM being played to an audience mainly sitting down eating hotdogs. 5:31 Becky G's 'Break A Sweat' comes on. It's a good one. By this point I've had two beers, a box of popcorn, some nachos and cheese, and a bag of M&Ms. I feel a bit sick. 5:45 TEN MINUTE WARNING! 5:50 FIVE MINUTE WARNING! 5:55 — The famous people start to arrive, camera flashes going off every­where. All the excitable fans in the pit at the front turn their backs to the stage to look at them. 6:00 Nicki Minaj opens it all, which is quite exciting. 'Trini Dem Girls' sounds pretty fucking amazing blaring out of a rib-rattling sound system. From a distance it looks as if Nicki's lost her keys and she's trying to find them, with lots of frantic patting of various areas of her body.  6:03 Oh here comes Taylor. I guess this is classed as the first real surprise of the night and yet there's a pungent whiff of the inev­it­able about it all. Still, nice that after Taylor gra­ciously offered to let Nicki share a stage with her, it's Nicki that budges up for a brief 'Bad Blood' interlude. When the lights go down the pair do another slightly strained-looking hug and leave in separate dir­ec­tions. 6:05 That's not before Nicki has to introduce Macklemore and Ryan Lewis who perform a song in downtown LA. No thanks. 6:10 Shrinking violet Miley Cyrus arrives dressed in a comedy get-up created by Jeremy Scott by sliding out of a psy­che­delic worm hole. 6:15 I lose the thread of what's going on and before I know it Rita Ora's in a paddling pool full of spaghetti having her picture taken. She seems happy to be there so that's good. 6:17 Miley intro­duces VMA veteran Britney Spears to the stage by saying she's the only person who answers her calls in an emergency. Britney then emerges out of what looks like a cat's bumhole (see below) to make a joke about how she thought it was Taylor Swift calling. This is about the four­teenth time Taylor Swift's name's been mentioned in the first twenty minutes. 
6:18 The first of many many ad breaks causes everyone to go to the bar which has been closed for half an hour. Following Nicki and Taylor's onstage embrace the voiceover lady says, ""what other girl beef will be buried tonight?"", which is a fairly brazen set up. 6:24 Jared Leto comes on to introduce The Weeknd. People in the crowd go batshit mental for him (The Weeknd that is), espe­cially when he starts dancing like Michael Jackson. There's a bit where he tries to set himself on fire, much like Michael Jackson did while shooting a Pepsi com­mer­cial (advert) that time. 6:30 Okay so this is the other 'beef' the voiceover lady was referring to. Nicki Minaj wins Best Hip Hop video and after saying things like ""Where all my girls at getting their own money?"" and thanking her pastor she says the following things. As you can see in the video Miley looks pretty surprised by it all. OH MY GOD NO NO pic.twitter.com/sZUSleOR0Y — armin (@urlbadman) August 31, 2015  6:39 Things probably aren't helped by the fact that in the next video interlude (most of which just ramps up Miley's 'I'm mad, me' shtick which sometimes feels in danger of eclipsing her), there's a Meek Mill/Drake reference. As is the way with the VMAs in the age of Twitter, no zeit­geisty stone is left unturned. 6:42 Personality vortex Nick Jonas walks out to read an autocue. It doesn't go well. 6:44 Taylor beats Beyoncé to Best Female Video and guess what? Yep, Kanye pretends to go up and collect it. Oh how we laugh. No, but seriously, it's pretty funny. But again, it feels quite pre­dict­able. Taylor lets 'Blank Space' director Joseph Khan come up and collect the award with her. Shen then allows him to speak and that's when everyone bar the caterer gets a thank you. It goes on a bit. 6:51 Hailee Steinfeld shows up on a big screen to introduce Demi Lovato. Demi performs 'Cool For The Summer' outside the studio, which is a bit annoying. Still it's not as annoying as when Iggy Azalea pops up out of the stage to mumble a super­flu­ous rap part. There's a funny bit when the woman next to me asks who she is. ""Is that Christina Aguilera?"" she says. :( 7:01 Straight from the ad break and into Justin Bieber's big MTV VMA comeback (he hasn't performed since 2010). Obviously the world has forgiven him now for throwing eggs and pissing in buckets etc, and 'Where Are U Now' has def­in­itely helped with that. It sounds amazing, espe­cially during the various breakdown bits. It morphs into 'What Do You Mean?' (next single: 'What Time's Dinner?' 'Why Didn't You Set The Recorder For Bake Off?', 'Why The Long Face?'), which feels a bit flat in com­par­ison. At the end of the per­form­ance a Bieber monologue about learning from your mistakes and growing etc plays and then suddenly Bieber shoots up from the stage, resur­rec­ted.  To complete the rehab­il­it­a­tion he appar­ently bursts into tears at the end. Perhaps the harness was chaffing WHO KNOWS. 7:19 Another video interlude about weed and being stoned etc. Do you see? Miley enjoys recre­ational drug taking. In one of them she eats weed brownies with Snoop Dogg who then turns into a pig. Or something. 7:21 Poor Tori Kelly. She's got an amazing voice and some good songs but when she's intro­duced there's a small chorus of  ""who?"" that bubbles around me. 7:26 I have another beer and a hot dog. 7/10. 7: 28 It's a good logo, isn't it. Also, nice of James Bay to show up.  7:30 Kanye West is this year's recipient of the Video Vanguard Award and so a video trailer thing plays that's actually pretty amazing. The whole thing feels quite exciting. 7:34 Taylor Swift arrives onstage to present the award. Yes, that's right Taylor Swift is there to present a special video award to Kanye West. Not any of the myriad people he's worked with or his long-term friends or the person he's married to. ""I first met Kanye west six years ago at this show actually,"" she says, which gets a big laugh. She then talks about how good he is at sewing, which rightly gets no reaction what­so­ever. 7:38 And so starts one of the most amazing and baffling speeches of all time. Of all time! Basically he picks up on Taylor's comment about what happened six years ago and runs with it; jumping from chatting about whether he'd do it dif­fer­ently now to grocery shopping with his daughter to making it seem like that one event changed the fabric of society. He doesn't mention the award or his videos once. This weirdly means that Taylor Swift is still the focus of his speech and the show in general. People start getting angry. Someone shouts ""get off"", while a lady near me quite right­fully just shouts ""BEYONCÉ"". ""I just want people to like me,"" he says, which then seems to win people over again. Then he starts slagging off MTV them­selves, which puts people's backs up again. Then, just when it feels like he might never stop, he says ""I have decided in 2020 to run for president"". Amazing. 7:48 It feels like the show should probably just end there. It doesn't though and the announce­ment that Pharrell is coming up doesn't really register. Poor Pharrell. 8:02 I decide to have another hotdog. 8:07 Twenty One Pilots and ASAP Rocky perform. 8:17 The big one — Video of The Year. Of course 'Bad Blood' wins, despite being literally not very good at all. Me and the woman who shouted 'BEYONCÉ' earlier both look dis­ap­poin­ted. Still, there's no denying this has been Taylor's year 'vis-a-vis' the whole being the biggest popstar in the world and selling loads of albums thing. It's just that it feels like the Taylor Swift Show and a bit of variety might have been nice. 8:20 Miley flashes her boobs. 8:25 Having teased it all evening, the show ends with a per­form­ance of a new Miley song called 'Dooo It' involving streamers, confetti, drag queens, Wayne Coyne from The Flaming Lips and just about enough star quality to hide the song's lack of bril­liance. It looks a bit like this:  Right at the end of the per­form­ance she announces a brand new album called 'Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz' and that it's free to download right now. It's an exciting end to a show that felt like it was missing a truly amazing per­form­ance. While there were shocking moments — most of Kanye's speech carried a frisson of WTF — it was also incred­ibly pre­dict­able, with each 'con­tro­ver­sial' moment related to the show tied up in neat little bows. Even the Nicki and Miley thing, while appar­ently genuine, was curtailed quickly by Nicki's mic being switched off. Regardless, I got to eat two hotdogs while watching some pop-related enter­tain­ment, so that for me is a positive evening. To end, here's a picture of a man holding a dog with drawn on eyebrows dressed as a Mexican. It was the first thing I saw as I left the venue. You're welcome.

183,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/briefing/things-the-rihanna-albums-better-than/,"This is an official list and is not open to question… 1. Trees
Trees are all very well but they don't tend to contain songs called 'UMBRELLA'. We said that 'Umbrella' was good ages ago and, to our credit, we were right. Let's bang on about how right we were about 'Umbrella' and ignore all the terrible, success-free and com­pletely unlisten­able music cham­pioned by Popjustice over the years. 2. Air
Air is good for you but if you hyper­ventil­ate it is bad for you. It's swings and round­abouts. There is no such thing as too much of the new Rihanna album because there are only twelve songs on it – ie it's the perfect length for an album. There are also NO inter­ludes. Amazing. 3. The internal com­bus­tion engine
The internal com­bus­tion engine is fairly useful but you wouldn't want to put the sound of it on your iPod. 4. Dogs
If you can show us a dog which builds on the reggae-pop promise of 'Pon De Replay' with a dis­tinct­ive and easily-pin­point­able sonic defin­i­tion of 'Rihanna as an artist', thus proving that she is a popstar and is more than a faceless session singer who got lucky, then go right ahead. We are confident that no such dog exists. But there is an album which does that job and that album is this album. 5. Arriving home after an evening of binge drinking to discover that instead of there being no inter­est­ing food in the house there is in fact a frozen pizza waiting to be badly cooked and then eaten
Finding a frozen pizza in the freezer when drunk inev­it­ably ends up with the pizza being on fire because you fell asleep two minutes after you put it in the oven. You would not put 'Good Girl Gone Bad' in the oven in the first place, thus min­im­ising any risk of a blaze. 6. Electricity
If you piss on an electric fence you will cause yourself some damage. Pissing on the new Rihanna album will result in no such injury. 7. The ability to see
The only reason people are hung up on the whole 'sight' business is that there are too few inter­est­ing things to listen to. However, there are twelve inter­est­ing things to listen to on the new Rihanna album, making blindness slightly less unap­peal­ing. 8. Cats
Same reason as dogs except smaller. 9. Almost every other album released this year
We can only think of one album we've heard this year which is anywhere near as good as this and the way things are going we'd be surprised if that ends up being released, meaning 'Good Girl Gone Bad' wins. 10. Everything on the internet
The internet does have some amazing things on it but because the things on the internet are not ALL about Rihanna — some websites are about fish, others are about computer games and so on — the Rihanna Percentage of the internet is quite low, whereas the Rihanna Percentage of this album is roughly 100%. 11. The last Rihanna album
This album has ten more than two good songs on it. 12. Trains
We're not saying trains are bad or anything – we're just saying they're not as amazing as the Michael Jackson-sampling 'DON'T STOP THE MUSIC', track three on the new Rihanna album. What makes 'Don't Stop The Music' so incred­ible is that it sounds like the world's first electro-R&B-filter-house track, and if it is not the first then we would like someone to email us now with the info because we'd like to hear a million other songs like this. 13. Christmas Eve
The new Rihanna album doesn't require you to run around town like an idiot buying presents for people you don't know or like. 14. Christmas Day
Unlike Christmas, the new Rihanna album is not a complete anti­cli­max and is, in fact, a lot better than you thought it was going to be. 15. Boxing Day
On Boxing Day one tra­di­tion­ally begins con­sid­er­ing the previous twelve months and how terrible they have been. 'Good Girl Gone Bad' prompts no such depres­sion and is, in fact, quite a cheery listen. Hoorah. 16. Vegetables
One in every twelve veget­ables is dis­gust­ing. One in every twelve songs on the Rihanna album is not, meaning that 'Good Girl Gone Bad' wins HANDS DOWN. 17. You would expect it to be
Even on the basis of 'Umbrella' you'd have no idea how good this album really is. It's a complete surprise and pop music is all about surprises.

18. Mobile phones
You would never drop 'Good Girl Gone Bad' down the toilet, because there would be no reason for you to have 'Good Girl Gone Bad' with you in the toilet in the first place. Unless, we suppose, it was on your iPod. But still. 19. Ceilings
Ceilings are boring unless you get some fancy-pants artist in to paint them for you like that place in the Vatican City. 'Good Girl Gone Bad' is never boring – there's even something inter­est­ing to listen to in each of the ballads. Fancy that! 20. Doorbells
Doorbells are fine but you can't imagine someone writing, producing, singing or recording what is essen­tially the new 'Maneater' and the whole thing sounding like a doorbell. If someone were to invent the new 'Maneater' it would instead sound like woman-scorned anthem 'BREAKIN' DISHES' from the new Rihanna album. It's got everything – brilliant ""I don't know you who think I am am am am am am am"" chants, a chorus which goes ""I'm breaking dishes on your head all night, uh huh, I ain't gonna stop til I see police and lights"", and another catchy bit in the shape of ""a man, a man, a ma-e-a-a-an"". Finally, a light-hearted and danceable take on domestic abuse. 21. Desks
You can put the Rihanna album on your desk, but you cannot put a desk on the Rihanna album. Right? Right. 22. The rare sight of a sheep sprinting across a field and jumping over a small stream
Jay-Z has never gone on record admitting to any involve­ment with sheep jumping over small streams. 23. Cars
Cars are useful but what if you were to combine cars with the medium of popular song? Well, if you were to do that you would have 'SHUT UP AND DRIVE' from the new Rihanna album. Rihanna sings things like ""my engine's ready to explode-splode-splode so start me up and watch me go"", so we think it's more likely to be about sexual inter­course than actual cars. 24. The old Lisa scott-Lee doll which is in a box in your loft
'Good Girl Gone Bad' will never be boxed up and forgotten.

25. Vacuum cleaners
The new Rihanna album doesn't need emptying. 26. Jaffa cakes
Everyone likes a Jaffa Cake but, unlike 'Don't Stop The Music', Jaffa Cakes have NOTHING to do with picking up boys on dance­floors with hilarious chat-up lines like ""your aura is incred­ible"". ""I wanna take you away,"" she sings. Someone needs to tell Rihanna that men are not things you order over the counter at your local Chinese res­taur­ant and that to treat them at such is very demeaning. 27. Beaches
The new Rihanna album will not be respons­ible for particles of sand falling out of bodily crevices for three days. 28. The sight of a small child throwing them­selves on the floor in the super­mar­ket because they are not allowed a Kinder Surprise
The child's per­form­ance will be over as soon as its mother (or father — it's the 21st century!) even­tu­ally gives in, which is usually within three minutes. The Rihanna album is far longer than three minutes and therefore rep­res­ents far better value for money, or something. 29. Spectacles
Serial killers wear spec­tacles, the new Rihanna album does not. 30. A smiling old lady
The new Rihanna album is unlikely to suddenly blurt out a stream of racist and homo­phobic abuse.

31. A buffet
Everyone likes a buffet. That is fact. But buffets do not contain numerous extended metaphors and the new Rihanna album is bloody full of them.

32. The last Beyonce album
The best bit on 'B-Day' was 'Ring The Alarm', and 'Breakin' Dishes' is the same song PLUS 'Maneater'. Something with 'Maneater' in it is always better than something without 'Maneater' in it. 33. All religion
Oh yes. 34. Anything you can buy from a branch of Argos
Argos does not sell CDs, will therefore not be selling 'Good Girl Gone Bad', and as a result its entire catalogue is full of items less good than the new Rihanna album. 35. Pop tarts
You do not have to put 'Good Girl Gone Bad' into a toaster to make it palatable.

36. Skimmed milk
It might be good for you but skimmed milk, being entirely silent, doesn't sound like the Rihanna album track 'SAY IT', which has a sort of weirdo backwards backing track and is the nearest this new album has to a con­ven­tional R&B mid-tempo waily ballad. It's not boring. Nor is it com­pletely inter­est­ing, but neither is skimmed milk, unless you chuck some Nesquick in it, and that would probably undo all the healthy good work of the whole 'skimmed' angle.

37. Reggae Reggae Sauce
Reggae Reggae Sauce goes off only five days after being opened. 'Good Girl Gone Bad' will be amazing for more than five days and will in fact probably end the year as one of the world's biggest-selling albums.

38. An episode of Coronation Street
This is no criticism of Corrie per se but if you look at the writing and pro­duc­tion credits at the end of your average episode you're unlikely to find Timbaland, Ne-Yo or Stargate listed ANYWHERE. 39. The last Christina album
'Good Girl Gone Bad' sounds like it was recorded in 2007, not 1927. 40. The new Kelly Clarkson album, probably
You can't imagine Rihanna stomping around refusing to record brilliant pop songs in favour of some old tripe she's copied out of some terrible diary entries from seventh grade. 41. The new Amerie album
It's sad but it's true. This Rihanna album shits from a great height all over the Amerie album. In fact we will probably never listen to the new Amerie album ever again, such is the power with which 'Good Girl Gone Bad' has com­pletely blown it out of the water. Well, we might listen to 'Crush' every now and again we suppose. 42. Gardening
Gardening doesn't have the same name as an Amy Winehouse song, unlike 'REHAB' on the Rihanna album. Is it a cover of the Amy Winehouse song? No no no. It is about ""my lover and my best friend all wrapped into one with a ribbon on it"". So it is about sort of being addicted to somebody. Unless Rihanna is singing about crystal meth. 43. The Olympics
The Olympics is all about showing off. 'Good Girl Gone Bad' – despite all the bells and whistles – sounds com­fort­able in itself with a self-con­fid­ence which negates any need to show off. 44. Football
Only men and lesbians enjoy football. 'Good Girl Gone Bad' has far broader appeal.

45. The concept of higher education
Going to uni­ver­sity is all very well and will teach you many things but will your three years of debt and depres­sion include a duet with Ne-Yo? No, they probably will not. 'Good Girl Gone Bad' does however include just such a duet – it's called 'HATE THAT I LOVE YOU' and despite being a ballad is a real cracker. For the chorus, Rihanna sings ""I hate how much I love you boy, I can't stand how much I need you, I hate how much I love you boy, but I just can't let you go, and I hate that I love you so"", and then Ne-Yo sings it back to her. Changing the boy bits for girl, obviously. It's not gay or anything. It ends in a slightly drippy mess but if they have to release a ballad off this album then it might as well be this. 46. Seeing someone almost trip over in the street then pre­tend­ing they meant to do it with some sort of elaborate and com­pletely uncon­vin­cing cover-up
Satisfying as it is to see someone almost trip over, there is no guilt about enjoying the new Rihanna album. It's fun and it's pop but it is also CREDIBLE and PROPER, meaning that your The View-loving older brother might admit to liking one or two songs on it. 47. Snow
It has to be cold for snow to happen, meaning that snow is imprac­tical in the summer months. The Rihanna album, however, is VERY summery. 48. Anything The Twang have ever and will ever record even if they live to be a million years old
Obviously. 49. 'Imagine' by John Lennon
People think John Lennon's some sort of lyrical genius but did he ever – EVER – come up with this line – from 'Breakin' Dishes – ""I'm roasting marsh­mal­lows on the fire and what I'm burning is your attire""? No he did not. 50. Anything which will inev­it­ably be voted above it in the Q magazine end-of-year poll
Because all Q ever do it those inter­min­able 'Top 100' lists and everyone knows that Top 100 lists are a complete copout. 51. Haircuts
Haircuts are driven by fashion and date quickly. 'Good Girl Gone Bad' will still sound like The Future in the year 2133. 52. Making pancakes
Having no eggs in the house will not prevent you enjoying the new Rihanna album. 53. Having a comedy hooter on your desk and honking it when something amusing happens in the office
Only 33% of people in PJ Towers think that the above is as amazing as we do, but 66% think the new Rihanna album is great. 54. iPods
There is no point in being able to carry 8,000 songs in your pocket if you are only ever going to listen to the twelve songs on the Rihanna album between now and the day you die. 55. Fortune tellers
Because ""fortune teller-eller-eller"" doesn't sounds as good as ""um-ber-ella-ella-ella"". 56. Ben Hur
Fair enough, it's a cinematic classic. But could you dance to Ben Hur? Of course you couldn't. You could try but you'd be very dis­ap­poin­ted. This means it's offi­cially less good than 'PUSH UP ON ME', which is track two on Rihanna's 'Good Girl Gone Bad'. 'Push Up On Me' is a sort of booty­boun­cing pop banger which sounds like it's based around a sample of the metallic intro noise from the start of Michael Jackson's 'Beat It' but probably isn't.  57. Gravel
Fine for a driveway but no good in a CD player. 58. Going on holiday
Going on holiday is incred­ibly time consuming – unlike 'Good Girl Gone Bad' which only takes up three quarters of an hour of your time. 59. Scotland
Scotland never sampled Soft Cell on its last album and is therefore unlikely ever to follow up that album with an album as good as 'Good Girl Gone Bad'. 60. Camping 
If you go camping you WILL wake up in the middle of the night to the ominous sound of 200 enraged cows charging towards your flimsy tent. You would be far better off having a listen to a song about shagging, like Rihanna's 'Push Up On Me'. It's one of the best songs on the album, its chorus a cheery cry of ""the way that you stare starts a fire in me, come up to my room you sexy little thing"". Amazing. 61. Every summer festival in the UK and abroad
There is no hint of Snow Patrol or Razorlight on the new Rihanna album. 62. Tap dancing
Tap dancing sounds like twats in stupid shoes. 'SELL ME CANDY' on the new Rihanna LP sounds like one of the best songs on the Timbaland album. 63. Every song in the Eurovision Song Contest for the last eight years
That is right, readers. 'Good Girl Gone Bad' is even better than the Scooch song. 64. Seeing a traffic warden receiving 'a mouthful' from someone who knows full well they were illegally parked but is hellbent on having an argument to the contrary non­ethe­less
If you live in London you see a traffic warden alter­ca­tion twice a day. But you only get one or two albums this good every year. Meaning that 'Good Girl Gone Bad' is better.
  65. Hair straight­en­ers
The new Rihanna album is not the sole reason for the success of the boyband Blue. 66. Shower curtains
Shower curtains do not stop you falling out of the bath when you reach out to steady yourself. In fact they mean that you land on the bathroom floor covered in shower curtain. The new Rihanna album would never let you down like that because the new Rihanna album is SOLID and DEPENDABLE. 67. Disco glit­ter­balls
Glitterballs might work quite well in a nitespot envir­on­ment but they do not work as impas­sioned pleas to treat young girls properly in case they go off the rails. The title track from 'GOOD GIRL GONE BAD' does do this, however. It's a big old ballad (but it's really good) and its chorus changes gear halfway through before exploding into a cry of ""you'd better learn how to treat us right, cos once a good girl goes bad we gone forever"". God help the mister who comes between Rihanna and her sisters, eh viewers?  68. Battlestar Galactica
Battlestar Galactica is amazing but at least the new Rihanna album won't hit you over the head with stuff about 'politics' and 'the real world' when all you want to do is watch a load of robots being blown up by fit people. Which is not to say that 'Good Girl Gone Bad' doesn't have a social con­science, because it probably does, somewhere or other. 69. Staying out quite late at night with your friends
'Good Girl Gone Bad' won't give you a hangover. Although it might get you a bit drunk if you play the 'shot of tequila every time you hear a good song' drinking game, because you would end up knocking back twelve shots in 46 minutes.  70. Staying in quite late at night with your friends
You don't need to kick 'Good Girl Gone Bad' out at 3am, or find it a taxi. 71. Parties
For every twelve people at a party, two are always annoying and rubbish. None of the twelve songs on 'Good Girl Gone Bad' are annoying or rubbish, making the Rihanna album offi­cially better than parties. 72. Poppers
Every song on 'Good Girl Gone Bad' lasts for longer than 42 seconds. 73. Party poppers
The Rihanna album doesn't end in tears when some pillock explodes it into someone's face and everybody has to go to the nearest hospital because Auntie Kathy has got paper streamers and gunpowder stuck in her right eye socket. 74. Peeling the plastic film off the screen of a new mobile phone
Always ends in tears when you end up having a huge row with O2 about the fact that the phone doesn't work. The new Rihanna album will not require anyone to spend eighty minutes being put on hold by the most useless tele­com­mu­nic­a­tions company in the history of useless tele­com­mu­nic­a­tions companies. 75. Bitter
The worst drink in the world. 'Good Girl Gone Bad' isn't even a drink, so it wins. Also – on a serious note, readers – the concept of 'bitter' as a drink does not take in Serious Issues like body dys­morphia or whatever it is the Rihanna song 'QUESTION EXISTING' is actually about. The first line is ""take off my shirt, loosen my buttons and undo my skirt, stare at myself in the mirror, take myself apart piece by piece"" so it's probably about something like that. 76. Paper
What's paper ever done for the world? Exactly. 77. The postman
'Good Girl Gone Bad' rep­res­ents Rihanna's maturing voice but it is never nasty, unlike some members of the so-called 'postal service' who spend more time stealing, rifling through and pooing in envelopes than they do deliv­er­ing them. 78. Getting quite a good grade for an essay you knocked out in fifty minutes while coming down from a four-day-long drugs binge
Unlike the exper­i­ence mentioned above, the new Rihanna album won't be tricky to explain to your parents. They will actually really like bits of it. 79. Getting the biggest bedroom in the house
Big bedrooms require more cleaning than small bedrooms, meaning that your initial excite­ment even­tu­ally gives way to dis­ap­point­ment. No such problems with the Rihanna album. 80. Painting a wall
The Rihanna album doesn't get paint in your hair.  81. Receiving an email intended for someone else followed by a lame attempt by the sender to 'recall' the message in Outlook which doesn't work and just adds to the hilarity of the whole thing
Receiving such an email is fun, but will never be as amazingly brilliant as the title track on 'Good Girl Gone Bad'. 82. Fireworks
Due to busybody killjoys and political cor­rect­ness gone mad you won't get fireworks at Club Popjustice, but you will get 'Don't Stop The Music', 'Shut Up And Drive' and a few other ones from the Rihanna album.  83. Instant barbeques
So-called 'instant' barbeques take ages to get going but 'Good Girl Gone Bad' does not – it kicks off with 'Umbrella' which is actually very instant indeed. 84. Shelves
You can't put up shelves in rented accom­mod­a­tion but you can listen to the Rihanna album wherever you live, making it perfect for students.  85. Bathroom radios in the shape of dolphins which don't really get any reception and take three batteries when you only ever have two lying around because you bought a packet of four batteries and EVERYTHING ELSE EVER INVENTED uses two batteries
The above-mentioned radios are frus­trat­ing but 'Good Girl Gone Bad' is not – it's a really easy listen. It's also a really complex listen if you want it to be. It sounds par­tic­u­larly great on head­phones. It is an album for every occasion. 86. Birthday candles which don't blow out
Amusing the first time, boring the second time, annoying on each sub­sequent occasion. The Rihanna album starts amazing and gets even more amazing with every listen. 87. Shazam
We like phoning Shazam in order to find out what songs DJs are playing on the radio, but Shazam has a habit of sending you annoying pro­mo­tional text messages and the new Rihanna album does not, what with it being a series of musical tracks and therefore an item incapable of sending even the most simple of text messages. 88. Dialling Shazam and holding your phone up to Track Three on the new Rihanna album 
The new Rihanna album is better than asking Shazam to identify Track Three on the new Rihanna album because Shazam can't identify Track Three, whereas the actual album can identify Track Three because its name is written on the back. (It's 'Don't Stop The Music' FYI.) 89. Any Questions Answered
AQA is almost as good as Shazam because it will give you the answer to literally any question you text to it, except we only remember it exists when we don't have anything we need to know, which is annoying. The new Rihanna album is not annoying. 90. Texting Any Questions Answered to ask 'What is the new Rihanna album better than?' and receiving the answer ""the new rihanna album is better than 1 of those 1970s Top Of The Pops albums of anonymous cover versions, but not as good as Tubby Hayes' '100% Proof'.""
That is the actual answer AQA sent us back. Amazing as it is, it is not as amazing as the new Rihanna album, for reasons mentioned elsewhere on this page. 91. All jewellery
Jewellery is only ever one of two things: expensive or shit. 'Good Girl Gone Bad' is more than two things, and none of those things is 'shit'. 92. Lampshades
This one speaks for itself, quite frankly. 93. Rollerblading cleaning ladies
The nice lady who cleans up the mess we make at PJ Towers rollerblades to the office but takes her rollerblades off when it comes to doing the actual cleaning. If the Rihanna album was a cleaning lady – we hasten to add that it is NOT – it would not only rollerblade to work but it would also do ALL the Hoovering in the rollerblades and would even have a go at emptying the bins in the blades too. It would try that little bit harder. 94. Coats
NB: The new Rihanna album is not better than jackets, the greatest garment of all time. If you are still reading this idiotic list you are fucking mental. 95. Ludicrously shoe­horned systems of grading albums based on the 'ella ella ella' bit in 'Umbrella' and a small picture of three Ella Fitzgeralds
Although if we were to award 'Good Girl Gone Bad' some Ella-Ella-Ellas out of ten, it would look like this:  96. Setting fire to the Cutty Sark 'for a laugh'
Yes, everyone enjoys torching 19th century vessels, but the Rihanna album won't get you in trouble. 97. Realising the pub you are in does not actually shut at 11pm and will in fact continue serving booze for ANOTHER WHOLE HOUR during which time you will tri­umphantly 'move on to shorts' under the mistaken belief that this will prevent you getting more drunk which is ridicu­lous anyway because the whole point of going out in the first place was to drink yourself into oblivion
Unlike 'Shut Up And Drive' on the new Rihanna album, moments like the one mentioned above do not end with a police siren and the sound of a car crash. Well, not always. 98. Sky+ and any other 'PVR' devices
You won't sit down at the weekend looking forward to catching up on the week's tele­visual high­lights only to discover that the new Rihanna album has chosen, com­pletely of its own accord, to video eighty hours of Snooker. 'Good Girl Gone Bad' would only record EXCITING and AMAZING tele­vi­sion, all of which it would obviously be better than, but you would still have something to watch. 99. Converse boots
The new Rihanna album will not make a complete mess of the heels on every pair of socks you own. 100. Bacon sand­wiches 
Actually this one's not definite. Bacon sand­wiches are pretty tasty. The Rihanna album: it's quite good. ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202804.80/warc/CC-MAIN-20190323121241-20190323143241-00090.warc.gz
184,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/briefing/threes-a-trend-remember-the-old-days/,"Hey readers! Do you remember the olden days? The wide­spread pro­duc­tion and use of bronze — amazing!  The sad dis­in­teg­ra­tion of Pangaea — great times! Opposable thumbs — what a day! Well you are not alone in recalling Simpler Times because based on this week's new releases today's popstars also have strong memories of days gone by, or if they don't then they can at least use Wikipedia, and ref­er­en­cing the songs previous civil­isa­tions once danced to is THE BIG NEW THING. EXHIBIT A: Anne-Marie's 2002 is a strangely joyless cel­eb­ra­tion of childhood, namecheck­ing Britney's …Baby One More Time (1998), *NSYNC's Bye Bye Bye (2000), Nelly's Ride Wit Me (2001) and Jay-Z's 99 Problems (2004). In some ways it's almost impress­ive that someone could write a song cel­eb­rat­ing 2002 in which precisely none of the ref­er­enced songs actually came out in that year, and it's even more impress­ive that when she thinks back to 2002 Anne-Marie has such fond memories of a Jay-Z song that wouldn't come out for another two years. EXHIBIT B: Incredibly Hello, the lead track from Prettymuch's new EP, is the second of this week's new releases to reference the same *NSYNC song: ""used to be like 'bye bye bye', now you’re here and I don’t mind"". (It makes sense that Prettymuch should include an *NSYNC reference — their whole sound and style is obsessed with throwback boybands to the point of just seeming dated.) EXHIBIT C: The new Naughty Boy, Ray BLK and Wyclef track All Or Nothing is beautiful and amazing in a dozen different ways and of all this week's olden days-ref­er­en­cing new releases it's the only one that delivers with a sense of warmth and soph­ist­ic­a­tion, and it actually seems to do this without any sense of a crowbar or wink to camera. In fact, All Or Nothing pulls off a double-whammy: Wyclef's ""when I say 'someone please call 911', that's 'cause I realised the wrong that I've done"" line is an obvious callback to his 2000 Mary J Blige duet, but Ray BLK's later statement that ""when I said I want TLC, didn't mean somebody that creeps"" is the jewel in this par­tic­u­lar pop crown. What does this mean? Why has this happened? What happens next? Does this mean there will be a second Brexit ref­er­en­dum? What this means, in the first two of the above instances at least, is that popstars are trying to surf a contrived Buzzfeed-style nostalgia wave, which con­sid­er­ing the age of most Prettymuch and Anne-Marie fans is actually nostalgia for something they didn't even exper­i­ence, and which therefore means we're into the dark and gloomy realm of Connoted Authenticity. This has happened because pop is an inter­tex­tual wonder that consists of layer upon layer of its own history. What happens next is that Little Mix reference Nelly & Kelly's Dilemma. No there will not be a second Brexit ref­er­en­dum. (At least not because of this. That all-important vote will actually come about when Robyn releases new music and the UK realises that freedom of movement is vital to decent promo.) BONUS! BONUS!! BONUS!!! Forgot about this — another track that came out this week is this abso­lutely stu­pendous remix of Tracey Thorn's Dancefloor, which ref­er­ences Bowie's Golden Years, Evelyn 'Champagne' King's Shame, Chic's Good Times and Shannon's Let The Music Play.

BUT FLEUR EAST IS NO CLOWN — as you can see from Favourite Thing, a new song/video combo from the singer, who you'll remember competed in a slightly demeaning ITV show, and also took part in I'm A Celebrity. It's Fleur's first big release since leaving Syco and Favourite Thing is about four times better than it has any right to be, as well as being pretty bloody good in its own right. ""The song has influ­ences from my mother's side of my family in Ghana,"" Fleur tells a press release. ""My mum has always made sure I know a lot about my heritage."" It's hard to predict how this sort of release will pan out in the streaming era but it deserves big things, as does Fleur.

188,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/briefing/troye-sivan-is-the-flickering-tealight-of-hope-in-a-dark-terrible-world/,"Let us just pause for a moment this Thursday morning to appre­ci­ate how lucky we all are to exist on the same physical plane as mil­len­nial pop elf Troye Sivan, whose new single My My My! appeared online at 5am for reasons appar­ently connected to its Beats 1 premiere. 1 Troye Sivan is the port in the current pop storm storm. He is a big deal and the real deal. He is the popstar we need and only occa­sion­ally deserve, a man who reflex­ively under­stands that only through being a pop fan does one have any hope of being a decent popstar. He is big enough to break the most sacred law of New Music Friday but amiable enough to do so without causing offence. He combines lightness of touch with a firm steady hand. He under­stands that pop isn't just about extraordin­ary music but he knows popstars are nothing without it. He feels, as many of the best artists have always done, like safety and danger. He is the absolute opposite of shit and he is only just beginning. Sidenote — if 5am song premieres based on ludicrous timezone dif­fer­ences are going to become a thing in 2018 Zane Lowe can, with all due respect to the great man, abso­lutely get fucked.↩ ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912205534.99/warc/CC-MAIN-20190326135436-20190326161436-00166.warc.gz
189,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/briefing/troye-sivans-subversively-queer-bloom-is-here-and-its-9-10/,"Back in the distant past when life was much simpler and all our futures seemed so much less fragile — ie, the end of February — Troye Sivan had a chat with Popjustice and talked for the first time about an upcoming track called Bloom. It was, he said, ""complete pop. Like: ‘Katy Perry Teenage Dream’ pop."" Sonically light, Troye said; lyrically cheeky. A fun song. Very con­sum­able pop. ""Lyrically I think it's the most sub­vers­ively queer song on the album,"" he added. ""I don’t even think it’s neces­sar­ily the big single or anything like that, but I really hope the song ends up spreading its wings way further than the people who wouldn’t normally listen to my music."" Comments on all this now that Bloom is now out in the open: 1. If this exquisite bumbanger is not neces­sar­ily the big single 'or anything like that' then TS2 is going to be very good indeed, which is to say that if the big one is still to come we are in for Quite A Treat. 2. The idea of it being 'complete pop' is quite inter­est­ing. It's hard to think of many current artists who'd stick out something this melod­ic­ally or struc­tur­ally straight­for­ward in 2018, still less get away with it. Mind you perhaps the key factor here is that the Teenage Dream feel, now eight years old, is now firmly in the realm of nostalgia. It reminds the listener of being young, or at least eight years less old. Still sounds like a 2018 song though, doesn't it? 3. This is 2018's best song about bumming but while the sub­vers­ively queer element shouldn't be under­es­tim­ated, it's worth noting that pop music is often at its best when it brings people together and Bloom is actually incred­ibly inclusive because many straight people are also very keen on anal activity. 4. If the CGI Troye from Bloom's lyric video and the puppet Ed Sheeran from the Happier video spent time together do you think they would get on? Do you think they'd discuss the things that made them different, or would they bond over the things they had in common? Would their chat skim the surface of life's peri­pheral concerns, or would they find the con­ver­sa­tion heading quickly, inev­it­ably, towards an intense dis­cus­sion of what it means to be human, and what it means to be something other than human? And would they accept that they are less than human, or would they find clarity in the notion that they are somehow more than human: each here on Earth to do a popstar's bidding in the world of pro­mo­tional pop video clips, but each also with their own hopes, dreams, fears and passions? As the evening wore on would they realise that the things that made them so different, Troye's flick­er­ing pixels, Ed's sponge and fabric, were the opposites that were always destined to attract? Would there be a moment, later on, when their eyes met, but somehow — they'd both realise — not in the same way their eyes had been meeting all evening? Would there be something else this time? Something neither of them could deny any longer? Would they kiss? ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912205534.99/warc/CC-MAIN-20190326135436-20190326161436-00077.warc.gz

Here we have a blue hand on a lady's legs, sitting on top of the planet Earth as it passes through a hole into another dimension. And in a way aren't we all, sometimes, a blue hand on a lady's legs sitting on top of the planet Earth as it passes through a hole into another dimension? Makes you think. Anyway we have listened to Clean Bandit and Demi Lovato's new song Solo precisely ten times and are now in a position to share the following ten facts: 1. Solo is a song about finding strength in self-imposed solitude, and salvaging the power of inde­pend­ence from the wreckage of a rela­tion­ship. 2. That's right: like all the best songs it's about having a wank. 3. Well it's a bit more complex than that: this perky mas­tur­b­anger is about suddenly realising you were a twat for ending a rela­tion­ship, being too sad to have rebound sex (‽) and taking matters into your own hands. Seven decades into this thing we call pop song­writers may be strug­gling to find new ways to talk about love and rela­tion­ships but with this tribute to the sadwank Clean Bandit might be sailing in uncharted waters right here. 4. There's an amazing WOO WOO WOO WOO WOO WOO WOO near the start: a siren that says ""leave your work­sta­tion, leave your belong­ings, there's a pop jug­ger­naut about to smash through the wall"". The middle eight sounds like BLOODY ABBA. Credit here should go to the people who are literally credited on the song: it was written by Jack and Grace from the band with Fred Gibson (who's well on his way to becoming the UK's next super-huge pop person) and the per­sist­ently excellent Camille Purcell. 5. There's also some Anywhere-by-Rita-Ora chopped up vocal business going on here but fear not because there are strings and swooshes as this is quite unmis­tak­ably a Clean Bandit single. It's — and this is a phrase we'd like to see used more in everyday con­ver­sa­tion — Totally Bandit. 6. Demi Lovato's vocals sound like Demi Lovato once you know they're Demi Lovato, but they could also be lots of people, and in a way that's the beauty of Demi Lovato isn't it? 7.  🚨 THIS SONG INCLUDES THE PHRASE ""DANCING ON MY OWN"". 🚨 8. At this stage Clean Bandit are the UK's most reliable pop inventors. Even that last one with Julia Michaels ended up being 7x better than you thought it was, right? Obviously reli­ab­il­ity isn't the most exciting trait in a pop act, but when it's based around the idea of how reliably exciting songs are, maybe it isactually exciting? 9. At this stage it also looks like Clean Bandit may never release a second album so we've decided to make it for them. Already up to five absolute belters and that's before you even add Solo, which is out next week (and pre-orderable todayif you're the sort of person who pre-orders songs in 2018). 10. There was a point when we were listening to Solo and Rockabye was playing in the back­ground, because we'd tried to stop the player in the record label's pro­pri­et­ary digital music delivery service using the pause key on our keyboard and had actually started a different song playing in Spotify, and actually the two songs sounded totally amazing together, so if Clean Bandit fancy going for some extra streams by making a mashup that's literally two songs playing at the same time they could have a big hit on their hands.   ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202496.35/warc/CC-MAIN-20190321051516-20190321073516-00360.warc.gz
193,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/briefing/which-x-factor-finalist-would-have-the-lowest-selling-christmas-number-one/," Following news of its release being pulled forward yesterday evening, we put a bet on Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars' 'Uptown Funk' being this year's Christmas Number One. It's already Number One on iTunes (with Fleur's version at Number Two), but its main com­pet­i­tion comes from this year's X Factor winner, so it's important to figure out which winner would achieve the lowest first week sales, then vote for that finalist. To start with, let's have a look at the week one sales (nicked off Twitter's Samuel Bailey) for all X Factor winners so far. As you can see, last year's winner Sam Bailey only achieved 149,000 sales, while the previous year's winner James Arthur shifted almost half a million copies of his own winner's single. It's therefore fair to say that some winners connect with a record buying audience, while others simply don't. So where does this leave this year's finalists?  The threat of a full Andrea artist album is not a pleasant one, but Andrea's whole mum-loving, jumper-wearing schtick is Christmas catnip. Still, while children like him and The Olds like him, what about pop's squeezed middle? Predicted first week sales: 290,000 All-bets-are-off secret weapon: We've said this every year for the last however-many-years-it's-been-since-the-song-came-out but one day an X Factor winner will cover Carolina Liar's 'Show Me What I'm Looking For', and it will be an extraordin­ary pop moment. If Andrea performs this for his winner's single it's game over for Ronson & Mars.  She should win and she should have the full might of Syco hurled in her direction during 2015, but would Fleur East be the biggest-selling winner out of this year's final three? Well, yes, probably. Her appeal crosses numerous bound­ar­ies, she'd be unlikely to inspired a 'protest vote' for Ronson & Mars simply because there's nothing shit about her, and goodwill towards her 'Uptown Funk' cover will carry on over into purchases of her winner's single, even if it's not 'Uptown Funk'. Predicted first week sales: 410,000 All-bets-are-off secret weapon: Ideally we'd like her to cover Tove Lo's album, Charli XCX's album and Rita Ora's album so that each of their release dates is brought forward to 2014.  Without a doubt the most useless of this year's three finalists. Predicted first week sales: 149,000 All-bets-are-off secret weapon: If he covers Crowded House's 'Don't Dream It's Over' the ""hey now, hey now"" bit could secure a romp to festive victory.  It's not too late for the poten­tially brilliant girlband from earlier in the series to be sen­sa­tion­ally brought back into the show. They should call them­selves Wildcard. Predicted first week sales: 5,000,000 All-bets-are-off secret weapon: It's been a while since the quint­es­sen­tial girlband Christmas Number One, 'Sound Of The Underground', has had a go at the festive top-spot. If Wildcard covered this, they'd be laughing all the way to the bank (in order to point and laugh at us not depos­it­ing our winnings). Please vote for Ben Haenow this weekend, we stand to win over £300 if Ronson & Mars hit Number One and a win for Ben Haenow would give us the strongest chance of scooping the prize. Cheers!

194,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/briefing/win-a-load-of-amazing-pop-tat/,"We recently received an email from Form, one of our favourite design agencies. You'll remember that about a year ago we wrote about their 21st birthday exhib­i­tion, and wrote the foreword for its programme. (Form also designed the current Popjustice logo.) The email was basically along the lines of ""we're having a big old clearout, do you want to have a rummage?"" and we thought well actually yes we do want to have a rummage. So we went to their office, rifled through two decades of pop stuff and came away with a big box. We'll be honest with you here, we're keeping the best stuff, but we came away with a few doubles and having checked The Archive it turns out we've got a few of these things already, so we're going to offer a big bundle of stuff to win in one poptat­mega­bundle. Here's a photo of some of the stuff.  Here's a photo of the rest of it.  As you can see there's limited, promo and generally amazing stuff here from Annie, Rachel Stevens, Atomic Kitten, 2wo Thirds, The Saturdays, Busted, Deuce and so on. YES IT INCLUDES AN ATOMIC KITTEN PUZZLE, PENCIL AND BADGE SET.  We know that quite a few of you are already going slightly berserk at the idea that this heap of pop history might make its way into your 'abodes' so without further waffle here is what you'll need to do to win it. 1. Have a look in the photos above.
2. Find a single, album or EP release that you like.
3. Design a new sleeve for it. It doesn't need to be tech­nic­ally good, it just needs to be a good idea.
4. Email your design along with your proper name, address and favourite animal to gene[email protected]. Do all that by midday this Friday (July 5 2013) please, for that is the closing date. We'll show the best entries on the site and the best of the lot will win the box of stuff. Good luck! (And thanks to Form for all the stuff!)

195,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/briefing/years-years-have-announced-their-album-so-heres-a-live-video-of-king/," They have had a Number One single and now they are going to release an album. They are Years & Years. That is their name. Their album, meanwhile, is called 'Communion' and it includes songs called things like '1977' and 'Track 10'. You can pre-order it here. (The band's official shop is banging out a 2x vinyl version which sounds quite nice.) Anyway in honour of all that here is the video of the band doing 'King' at Heaven in London.  That song is still amazing. Oh, you might as well have a stream of a song called 'Worship' while you're at it.  Hurrah.

Some people on the Popjustice forums have taken personal offence at the fact that we haven't put it on the frontpage yet, so here it is. Here is all you need to know about it. 
1. It is the first Girls Aloud video to have a budget any higher than the loose change in your pockets right now. 
2. It is the first Girls Aloud video to steal all its ideas from Christina Aguilera's 'Fighter' video. 
3. It is the first Girls Aloud video in which every member plays a valid role. 
4. It is the first Girls Aloud video in which Girls Aloud wear rubber.

198,popjustice.com/,pop,https://www.popjustice.com/briefing/your-definitive-guide-to-the-new-official-chart-rules/," Today the UK's Official Charts Company have announced The Sheeran Clause which, along with the continued avoidance of figures from sources like YouTube, ensures the charts continue to very poorly reflect the songs people are actually consuming. According to the new rules a maximum of three singles by a lead artist will be allowed in the singles chart (yes this makes sense) and tracks that have been on the chart for more than ten weeks and have seen declining sales for more than three weeks (hang on) will have their streams-to-sales ratio (WHAT?) reduced from 150 to 300 (EH?!). This is great news because it means the charts will be able to simply ignore some of the country's most popular songs! But not all the rules are as easy to follow as The Sheeran Clause. Here's the full list of revisions we'll see when the new chart rules come into effect. 1. THE SOMETHING JUST LIKE THIS RULE
Instant dis­qual­i­fic­a­tion for songs in which a young act seeking legit­im­acy works with an older act desperate to stay relevant, meaning that such col­lab­or­a­tions will move overnight from win/win to lose/lose. 2. THE DUA LIT TOASTER
Any song featuring Dua Lipa as the lead artist which has been described as 'lit' on social media will have its streaming numbers 'warmed up' — being awarded an extra 20% streams because Jesus Christ the UK needs to break a new pop artist. 3. THE LIPA SUCTION
Any song featuring Dua Lipa as featured artist will absorb an extra 5% streams, which will be extracted from the stream counts of the three songs below it. This is per­miss­ible up to a maximum of three Dua Lipa features per song, so in the instance of a song with 100,000 streams, combined with The Dua Lit Toaster, The Lipa Suction could result in a hefty boost for a song released by Dua Lipa (+20%) feat Dua Lipa (+5%), Dua Lipa (+5%) and Dua Lipa (+5%) — 138,915 streams in total.  4. THE BIEBER DIVIDER
All songs with a hastily-whacked-on Justin Bieber vocal will have their stream count reduced by 12% in an attempt to prevent labels gaming the chart. This also counts for songs promoted on social media by Justin Bieber if they are released by artists managed by Scooter Braun. 5. THE FEAT SUBTRACTOR
Zero tolerance on strug­gling female solo artists attempt­ing to prop up their success by appearing on tracks by solo male aiming for little more than the ability to charge more for their DJ sets. (Dua Lipa exempt.) 6. THE ""HEY ON, WHY?"" LITERACY FAST EVAL
This rule will quickly evaluate whether songs con­tain­ing a ""HEY!"" do so only due to the lyrical ineptitude of the song­writer. If the ""HEY!"" has been included to fill space because nobody can think of a decent lyric, the song will not be permitted to enter the Top 10.  7. THE BANDIT MULTIPLIER
Instant Number One for any Clean Bandit song with a decent video. 8. THE PUTH AMENDMENT
Reduced streams-to-sales ratio for all songs by Charlie Puth until he bucks his ideas up. 9. THE EU REVISION
Brexit does not apply to the Official Charts. All songs from the EU will be guar­an­teed full freedom of movement in the UK charts and songs by Eurovision winners will have their streaming figure decided by a series of inter­na­tional panels (midweek chart) in addition to a phone vote (Friday chart). 10. ARTICLE SHIFTK3Y
Upon activ­a­tion this rule will state that all songs recorded, produced or co-written by Shiftk3y receive an extra 150,000 streams, which Shiftk3y can add to one weekly sales count of his choice. (Cannot be activated on week of release or after a song has been available for more than three months.) 11. THE 1D 1'LL FLY AWAY STIPULATION
A maximum of two songs by any former One Direction member in any Top 40 chart. This is operated as a strict one-in-one-out policy: whenever a song by a former 1D member qualifies for a chart, the oldest song by another former 1D member is imme­di­ately dis­qual­i­fied from the chart.  12. THE PINEAPPLE PRONOUNCEMENT 
No tropical house unless it's really good, ie that song Matoma did with Becky Hill. 13. THE MENDES MANDATE
All Shawn Mendes songs have to be at least as good as 'There's Nothing Holdin' Me Back' or they risk being docked 20% of their streams. Song titles that end some words with ing and others with in' will also lose 5% of their streams. 14. THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM
James from Busted will receive 500,000 bonus streams for writing a sequel to 'What I Go To School For?' in which Miss Mackenzie is arrested for inap­pro­pri­ate conduct with a pupil. 15. THE REGULATE REGULATION
Warren G and Nate Dogg to be guar­an­teed a spot in the UK Top 40 every summer between the months of June and August. 16. THE NICKI MINJUNCTION
To be honest the thesaurus is running out of synonyms for 'rule' so let's bring things to close. The new rules come into effect next week. Good luck everyone! ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202804.80/warc/CC-MAIN-20190323121241-20190323143241-00527.warc.gz
