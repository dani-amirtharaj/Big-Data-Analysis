1,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/10-philanthropic-facts-you-may-not-know-about-tupac-shakur-uALil8jITUGFDg6WXSkYUA/,"Tupac Shakur accomplished a lot before his murder at the age of 25. Beyond his industry rivals, complex persona, and entertainment career this iconic artist had another side that’s been widely overlooked. As the child that wrote his own family plays, and the son of community activist, Afeni Shakur, he had a natural compassion for helping disadvantaged youth. To honor his humanitarianism, AllHipHop wanted to share some philanthropic acts that went under the radar. Here are 10 philanthropic facts, you may have not known about Tupac Shakur: 1. TUPAC & JOSHUA In 1993, Tupac received a letter from the parents of a dying boy, named Joshua. They said it was Joshua’s last wish to meet Tupac. Tupac flew to Maryland to meet Joshua and took him to a basketball game. Soon after Joshua’s death Tupac renamed his publishing company from Ghetto Gospel Music to Joshua’s Dream. 2. TUPAC’S CELEBRITY YOUTH FOOTBALL LEAGUE Before his death, Tupac was in the works of developing a Celebrity Youth Football League. Each celebrity involved would sponsor a youth sports team, by buying uniforms and hiring a staff of coaches. 3. A PLACE CALLED HOME Tupac put together a benefit concert to help a growing non-profit organization, A Place Called Home, raise money for a new building. Founded in 1993, A Place Called Home is a safe haven in South Central LA where at risk youth are empowered to take ownership of the quality and direction of their lives through programs in education. 4. TUPAC’S SPECIAL BBQ Through his bodyguard, Tupac heard about a 14-year old girl who was paralyzed from the waist down and confined to a wheelchair after a terrible car accident. Tupac called the Make-A-Wish Foundation to inquire about this little girl. During the phone call, Pac learned the girl was scheduled to meet her celebrity idol, but the celebrity canceled just before the meeting date. Tupac stepped in and flew the girl and her aunt to California to join him on the set of “Gridlock’d.”Afterwards he took them to the recording studio and later hosted a personal BBQ cookout at his house in honor of her.Tupac later donated a brand new audio system to her school. 5. TUPAC GOES TO THE PROM A Tupac fan wrote a letter to his fan club, asking the late rapper to be her prom date. About a month later, Tupac showed up at her doorstep. He came inside the home and talked to her family and offered to purchase her prom dress & escort her to the dance. Before leaving her home, Tupac gave the family $1500. When her prom day came, Tupac arrived in a limo to pick up his fan. At the school function Tupac signed autographs, took photos, and even got on the dance floor with her for five songs before he left. 6. TUPAC RACES TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM During a promo tour stop in Washington, DC, as Tupac was on his way back to the airport, he heard on the radio about a young girl who was in the emergency room after being attacked and mauled by a dog. Tupac told the driver to turn around and take him to the hospital where the young girl was located. He stayed with her and her family until she fully recovered. 7. TUPAC STARTS PETITION TO KEEP COMMUNITY CENTER OPEN In his early teens, Tupac solicited people to sign a petition to keep a community recreation center open. After accumulating a significant number of signatures the building was torn down anyway in spite of his efforts. This experience helped cultivate Tupac’s vision for a center that would provide a positive environment where young people could learn skills and performing arts. He wanted to call the center Thug Mansion. After his early death, his mother maintained the vision by opening the Tupac Amaru Shakur Foundation in Stone Mountain, Georgia. 8. PUSHED UNITY BEYOND SO-CALLED EAST COAST/WEST COAST BEEF Tupac was often accused of instigating war between coasts, but there’s plenty evidence to the contrary. In 1996, Pac invited the Boot Camp Clik, the Brooklyn Hip-Hop collective, to record The One Nation album at his summer mansion. The album has never been released, but the effort was definitely there before his death. Furthermore, Pac had rock solid relationships with East Coast folks like Busta Rhymes and Treach from Naughty By Nature. Not exactly philanthropy, but definitely for the greater good. 9. TUPAC’S PARTNERSHIP WITH J COLE He may not be here in the flesh, but his work continues on. The Tupac Amaru Shakur Foundation and J Cole’s Dreamville Foundation recently joined forces and started a youth book club in North Carolina. The first book read and discussed was, A Rose that Grew from Concrete. Tupac’s non-profit organization recently celebrated 15 years of serving the community. The center teaches vocal training, ballet, jazz, recording & engineering, theater and creative writing. The nonprofit is still spearheaded by Afeni Shakur. Other family members including Tupac’s sister are active volunteers and staff. 10. TUPAC’S C.O.D.E FOUNDATION  From June 1994 to April 2002, Ms. Erica Ford ran Tupac’s Code Foundation even after the rapper had passed away. Erica, Tupac, and his stepfather Mutulu Shakur, established The Code in 1994. The mission was simply to keep young people out of jail and to decrease “Black on Black” crime.

3,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/10-weird-disturbing-and-laughable-facts-about-r-kelly-in-chronological-order-Kt89MW4hm0G7G-dm1RvVqA/,"With over 50 million albums sold worldwide and numerous awards, he  is both a critical and commercial powerhouse.  In addition to his iconic  career in the music industry though, he has also had many things happen  that make for a checkered past. With R. Kelly’s new album, Black Panties, making its way to  the masses, AllHipHop.com takes a chronological look back at 10 weird,  unusual, disturbing, and awkward experiences of his in and out of the  spotlight.  And while AHH in no way excuses or minimizes how Kellz and  other individuals have been affected by the events in this list, R.  Kelly is proof that great music can overshadow even the craziest of  circumstances.  (Wether or not it should is another discussion.) Black Panties is significant because R. Kelly is an  incredible musical talent, but here are some other reasons that people  have been talking about the Chicago native for decades. Childhood Abuse, circa 1975: In his 2012 autobiography, Soulacoaster,  R. Kelly reveals that he was sexually molested from age 8 onward by a  woman he doesn’t identify.  He also says that an older man, who was a  neighbor, sexually propositioned him once when he was a kid. Marriage to Aaliyah, 1994: One of the first  demonstrations of real-life weirdness in R. Kelly’s life after he became  famous was his marriage to R&B singer, Aaliyah (R.I.P.).  When the  couple married in 1994, she was only 15 years old.  While the two of  them denied that they had wed, a marriage license was uncovered for the  couple which was dated August 31, 1994. The document proved that they  lied about Aaliyah’s age by stating she was 18.  When her parents found  out, the marriage was annulled.  “You Remind Me of Something,” 1995: Common set the bar  pretty high for Chicago artists using metaphors with “I Used to Love  H.E.R.”  However, that didn’t stop Robert Kelly from doing it a year  later.  Considering how sexual and detailed his lyrics had been in the  past (see “Sex Me Part 1 & 2”), comparing women to a jeep seemed  like a step backward and sort of laughable.  Tiffany Hawkins Lawsuit, 1996: R. Kelly was sued by a  woman for $10 million who claimed that she was forced to have sex with  him when she was 15 and participate in group sex in order to keep being a  back-up singer.  In 1998, the lawsuit was reportedly settled for  $250,000. Barry Hankerson Resigns, 2000: R. Kelly’s manager  Barry Hankerson resigns from that position.  In a letter to Kelly’s  attorney, Hankerson says that R. Kelly needs psychiatric help for his  interest in underage females. Sex Tape Controversy, 2002: While Kellz was  performing at the Opening Ceremony of the Winter Olympics and set to  tour Jay Z for their Best of Both Worlds album, a tape emerged which  allegedly depicted him having sex with and urinating on an underage  girl.  After numerous delays, the case went to court in the spring of  2008.  The jury found R. Kelly not guilty on all charges.  “Hotel” Music Video, 2003: The Spanish guitars on the  Swizz Beatz-produced “Hotel” are all well and good, but seeing R.Kelly  in a pink Zorro mask takes it over the edge.  In a little over four  minutes, the brilliance and bizarreness of Robert Kelly are both on  display.  His technically-skilled and catchy chorus outshines Cassidy’s  raps, but his look in the video has nothing to do with the content of  the song.  Even considering the aforementioned guitars, it’s still  pretty goofy.   The Best of Both Worlds Tour**, 2004:** The sex  tape controversy had died down a bit, Jay and Kells had both released  multiplatinum solo albums, and their performance together at Hov’s  “farewell” concert was outstanding.  Therefore, they decided to give  fans the tour that they’d first talked about two years earlier.   However, at the Madison Square Garden stop of the tour, tensions boiled  over between the two camps.  Subsequently, R. Kelly was kicked off the  tour. Lawsuits from both sides followed, but the most memorable  addressing of the matter was Jay Z’s verse on the remix of Snoop’s “Drop  It Like It’s Hot.”   “Trapped in the Closet,” 2005-2012: This is arguably  the most polarizing piece of work in R. Kelly’s catalogue.  Its massive  33 chapters has been rightfully praised and parodied for its ambition  and sometimes ridiculous content.  For instance, the cliffhanger lyrics  and ending scenes are great transitions from one chapter to another.   They do coast sometimes though in terms of quality and just go for  shock. For evidence, see the end of Chapter 9.  “Now, pause the  movie, ‘cause what I’m about to say to y’all is so damn twisted—not only  is there a man in his cabinet, but the man is a midget!”   Illiteracy, 2009: He touched on it in a Vibe  cover story in June 2004, but it wasn’t until 2009 that Kellz really  addressed the issue while speaking at the Midwest Music Festival.  He  said, “I don’t even read really and I’m not afraid to say that.  My  cousins and brothers used to tease me ‘you can’t even read right.  How  you think you’re going to come up?’  The only reason I graduated from  grammar school is because I had a great jump shot.”   What do you think of the Pied Piper of R&B?

4,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/15-facts-about-eminem-before-the-slim-shady-lp-y_HusN3iUkiUk-iBE6SmZA/,"And  exactly fifteen years ago today, Eminem released his proper debut, The Slim Shady LP  – an album that superbly showcased years of struggle, a razor sharp  wit, and rap skills worthy of Dr. Dre’s beats and midas touch. In honor of The Slim Shady LP’s 15th anniversary,  AllHipHop.com has come up with a list of 15 things about Eminem from  before and during the creation of it that not only turned the project  into one of the 90’s last great rap albums, but also helped shape Eminem  into the icon that he is today. Respect due to one of the most successful artists ever for the album  which started that ascent and the lifelong journey which went into it. 15). During grade school, Eminem was beaten up so badly once  by a school bully, D’Angelo Bailey, that he fell into a coma.  On “Brain  Damage,” Eminem got his revenge for that beating and others by hitting  him over the head with a broomstick til he broke the wood.  In 2001,  Bailey sued Eminem for $1 million dollars for invasion of privacy and  slander.  Two years later, the case was thrown out of court by a Judge  who delivered that ruling in the form of a rap. 14). Eminem was first introduced to Hip-Hop at age nine when his Uncle Ronnie played him “Reckless” by Ice-T.   13). Kid Rock released his debut, Grits Sandwiches for Breakfast,  in 1990, and he was doing an in-store in Detroit not long after when he  was approached by Eminem who challenged him to a rap battle.  Rock  encouraged him to slow down his flow.  Years later, but before The Slim Shady LP, the two collaborated on “F**k Off” from Kid Rock’s breakthrough album, Devil Without a Cause.  12). When Eminem heard Treach rhyme, he wanted to stop rapping.   Eminem once said, “Proof (Em’s friend and fellow Detroit rapper) brought  over the Naughty by Nature tape and played it for me.  When I heard  “Yoke the Joker” and then “Wickedest Man Alive” came next, I was like,  ‘Okay, I don’t want to do this anymore.  I ain’t that good.’”  11). One of Eminem’s first crews, Soul Intent, released a single  called “F***in’ Backstabber.”  The song also featured Proof.  Around  that same time, the all-star collective, D12, was put together.  The  group included Proof, Mr. Porter, Bizarre, Kon Artis, Swift, and Bugz –  while Eminem was just a transitional member.  But after Bugz’s untimely  passing in 1999, Em officially joined D12.   10). Mr. Porter produced all of Eminem’s 1996 release, Infinite, and Proof did the drum programming. 9). Infinite put Eminem in a position where he was being compared to  Nas and AZ.  However, that should come as no surprise since, as Eminem  once pointed out when discussing his beginnings as a rapper, “I was  making raps to other people’s songs.  I remember especially writing a  lot to Nas’ first album.”  8). After Infinite was not a success, Eminem hit a really  rough patch.  He was broke, had been evicted, his girlfriend, Kim, also  left him and took their daughter, Hailie, with her.  And in December  1996, he attempted suicide.  The event was even commented on (albeit  playfully) in “Cum on Everybody” at the beginning of the second verse.  “I tried suicide once and I’ll try it again / That’s why I write songs where I die at the end.”   7). According to Eminem, he thought of the name Slim Shady while  on the toilet.  “”Boom, the name hit me, and right away I thought of all  these words to rhyme with it,” he explained in a 1999 interview with Rolling Stone.  “So I wiped my ass, got up off the pot and, ah, went and called  everybody I knew.”  And while “Just Don’t Give a F**k” is certainly a  standout on The Slim Shady LP, it first appeared on The Slim Shady EP.  It was there that Em’s new alter-ego really emerged.  https://youtu.be/wIQWRHJq_kE  6). Eminem was invited to The Rap Olympics in 1997, a  nationwide Hip-Hop battle in Los Angeles.  He didn’t win, but did come  in second. 5). In the March 1998 issue of The Source, Eminem  appeared in the magazine’s “Unsigned Hype” column.  As Riggs Morales put  it in the article, “Point blank, this ain’t your average cat.  This  Motor City kid is a one-of-a-kind talent and he’s about to blow past the  competition, leaving many melted microphones in the dust.” https://youtu.be/Q79WrTHMBQ8  4). Dr. Dre became aware of Eminem when Jimmy Iovine played  him Em’s tape after receiving it from an Interscope intern.  In 1999,  Dre told the press, “In my entire career in the music industry, I have  never found anything from a demo tape or a CD. When Jimmy played this, I  said, ‘Find him. Now.'” 3). The very first time that Dre and Em worked together in the  studio, the majority of the material that they recorded made it on to The Slim Shady LP.   In a VH1 documentary series, Dre said, “I met with Eminem up at  Interscope, we talked for a little while, and then went to my house and  started recording.  I think that night we recorded like four songs and  three of them went to the album, so we just clicked.”  Eminem also  commented too by saying, “I had never done that before, making that many  songs in that limited time frame that were actually good.” 2). Eminem asked Marilyn Manson to collaborate on “97’ Bonnie  & Clyde,” but Manson declined.  “He asked me to sing on his first  record, and I would have, except that the song he asked me to sing was…  too misogynistic.  It was the [song] about killing his girlfriend and  putting her in a trunk,” the shock rocker told Spin in 2007. “It  was on a record I could listen to, but it was too over-the-top for me  to associate with. It didn’t represent where I was at.”  https://youtu.be/sNPnbI1arSE  And the rest is history. What do you think of The Slim Shady LP**?  Where do you think it ranks in Eminem’s discography?

5,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/1993-hip-hop-the-10-best-rap-albums-from-20-years-ago-AnUaMsQrtUqCbuLW4ubBMQ/,"But rap has a really short memory. So while the nine-three offered plenty of quality Hip-Hop albums, some of them have aged better than others. Therefore, AllHipHop.com has put together a list of rap albums that came out the same year that the Chicago Bulls achieved their first three-peat. These releases are just as memorable to Hip-Hop listeners as John Paxson’s 3-pointer is to basketball fans in the Windy City. So without further ado, here are the 10 best rap albums from 20 years ago. 10). Bacdafucup by Onyx: Considering Onyx were signed with Jam Master Jay (R.I.P.), it shouldn’t be surprising that they incorporated rock into their music. But where Run-DMC did records with Aerosmith, Onyx ventured further with it and entered into heavy metal territory. To this day, “Slam” can still start a mosh pit. The group was no fluke; their follow-up LP also delivered, and group member Sticky Fingaz even dropped a great solo album in 2001 as well. Onyx - Slam 9). Black Sunday by Cypress Hill: As the title suggests, this is a dark collection of songs. “Insane in the Brain” was a huge hit and it allowed them to showcase their skills to the masses as a result of this project going multi-platinum. The group’s support of weed also extends beyond the music and makes its way into the liner notes with facts about marijuana and the drug’s positive attributes. Cypress Hill - Insane In The Brain (Official Video) 8). 93 ‘Til Infinity by Souls of Mischief: Released when they were just teenagers, this Oakland, California, Hip-Hop collective dropped a too often overlooked West Coast gem. The four rappers trade-off rhymes smoothly, and many of the tracks transition into each other without any break. And while the title track is arguably the album’s highlight, the entirety of it proves that the Native Tongue sound wasn’t just limited to the East.  93 Til' Infinity----Souls Of Mischief.(HQ)  7). Enta Da Stage by Black Moon: This trio isn’t super lyrical, but they make up for it with delivery. Buckshot especially is able to switch up his style, and that makes the album a great listen. And while it didn’t perform as well commercially as other notable East Coast releases from that time, it still deserves as much credit as them from bringing New York back from years of Hip-Hop obscurity. Black Moon - Who Got The Props 1993 HQ 6). Buhloone Mindstate by De La Soul: Unfortunately, this was the last De La album that Prince Paul produced. Things on this album like the live instrumentation (courtesy of the JB Horns), the musical interlude (“I Be Blowin’”), and homage to old-school (“Breakadawn”), maintain the group’s avant-garde approach. The intro sums it up best: “It might blow up, but it won’t go pop.” ​ 5). Return of the Boom Bap by KRS-One: For Mr. Parker’s first official solo album, he connected with producers DJ Premier, Showbiz, and Kid Capri, so that it could live up to its name. The project succeeds and then some. There is the autobiographical “Outta Here.” The powerful “Sound of da Police” which compares officers to overseers. There’s also “I Can’t Wake Up” where he raps from the perspective of a blunt. And that’s just naming a few.  KRS-One - Sound of da Police  4). Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z. by 2Pac: While this album doesn’t embody the “Thug Life” tattoo on Pac’s torso that some of his later work would, it certainly captures the attitude of the city streets at that time. From the frustration on “Holler If Ya Hear Me” to the compassion for women on “Keep Ya Head Up,” Afeni’s baby boy was clearly a rebel with a cause who left few stones unturned. ​ 3). Midnight Marauders by A Tribe Called Quest: The follow up to The Low End Theory was two years in the making, but the wait was worth it. When Q-Tip says, “Lyrically I’m Mario Andretti on the momo,” he isn’t kidding. Couple that with the intricacy of the album’s beats and the result is a beautifully sequenced piece of work which is one of the most memorable releases in ATCQ’s catalogue. A Tribe Called Quest - Award Tour 2). Doggystyle by Snoop Doggy Dogg: While the chemistry between Dre and Snoop had already been established on The Chronic, Snoop’s official debut surpasses it because of its perfect balance between gangsta rap and pop. The project has no filler and album cuts like “Tha Shiznit” and “G’z and Hustlas” hold up just as well blockbuster singles, “Who Am I (What’s My Name)?” and “Gin and Juice.” Snoop Dogg - Gin & Juice 1). Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) by The Wu-Tang Clan: This album was a game-changer. The nine-man collective made the most out of raw beats and martial arts metaphors. The underground feel of the 12-track set was a great contrast to the clean sounds of G-funk. In short, the Wu presented something amazing and original. Two decades later, it’s been often imitated, but never duplicated.  Wu Tang Clan - Protect Ya Neck  What do you think of the list?

The concert was a huge success as concert goers had the chance to see several major acts perform if they donated an unwrapped toy for a child in need. The show did however come to an end before some of the major acts such as Young Thug, Rich Homie Quan, Bankroll Fresh, Young Dolph, K Camp and Boosie were able to hit the stage.

8,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/3-questions-with-dice-raw-jimmy-s-back-KOz_LaszEE-Km8sbS7w6mg/," Fluffy, white cotton, plucked by oppressed souls, blazing crosses consumed tarred-and-feathered skin, and America still sacrifices melanin for money. While Lincoln may have physically “freed” the slaves, Big Brother Willie Lynch and Brother Crow, have ensured their descendants continued psychological confinement. A nationally clouded-consciousness, coupled with a resentment of a mistreated people, has created an undulating fear which creates and sustains an institutionalized system of oppression.  Dice Raw, of The Roots, extended an invitation to AllHipHop to meet up at New York Live. There the Grammy-nominated MC spoke candidly about his upcoming solo-project, Jimmy’s Back: AllHipHop.com: In the past, you’ve earned artistic respect from your diligent work with The Roots. With your release of your second solo project, Jimmy’s Back, how are you able to broach such topics as: the mass incarceration of the melanin-enriched; the war on drugs; and the damning stigma that’s attached to words like “felon” in an insightfully compelling way rather than being preachy? Dice Raw: Basically, the one thing I can say is that I don’t come off preachy on the album. Also, most of the features that I have on the [album] are people who did eight years in jail, ten years in jail, or six years in jail. Like, K Dot The Show Stoppa, is an artist that I have a tremendous amount of respect for; I’m looking forward to seeing his career blossom in the future. He’s only 26 years old, but he’s done eight years in prison, you see what I’m saying. One of my best friend’s, growing up in the streets, his name is, Wallace Peoples. Wallace Peoples is 34 years old and he’s done 21 years in jail. You see what I’m saying; so, it’s not a big preachy thing.  To me, the War On Drugs is really a war on black men. It’s a war on the poor community that’s always been masqueraded behind—a war on drugs. Even when they wanted to get rid of the Chinese people who were building the railroads— [and back] in the mid 1800’s when the Opium—the war of Opium with the Chinese people. You want to lock up the Chinese people, but you can’t just lock them up for being Chinese. So, what do you come up with? ‘Okay, we’re gonna lock them up for being Opium heads.’  [Ed. Note: Through the 1700s China’s imperial system flourished under the Qing dynasty. It was at the center of the world economy as Europeans and Americans sought Chinese goods. In China’s favor, Western nations experienced an outflow of silver bullion to China. Westerners brought Opium into China to reverse the flow of silver. China attempted to ban the sale of Opium leading to the War of 1839 and they were defeated by the British.]  Once you’re labeled as felon it’s mission impossible. In some states, you can’t even get a Driver’s License. With dealing with the small, basic, civil rights—a human right—which is being able to transport yourself from on destination to another; it’s crazy! Barack Obama getting rid of 1.8M felon’s right to vote, that’s a problem. Once you got it, the stigma is here to stay. The thing is, how do you not get the stigma? How do you not get arrested? How do you not become a product of this mass-incarceration, prison-industrial complex?  The one thing is do not sell drugs. Do not do crime. To be honest with you, it’s like you have to do a lot of crime in order to get caught. Or, you have to be really stupid at doing crime. Marijuana is the biggest charge that young black males are being arrested for. Besides the more serious crimes, like homicide, rape, extortion, stuff like that. But it’s basically marijuana.  https://soundcloud.com/raw-life/wake-up-by-dice-raw-produced AllHipHop.com: Today, are you creatively and financially in a place to where you feel comfortable speaking on social evils; who and or what compels you to voice your opinion on what’s going on in society? Dice Raw: As far as finances, I’m very comfortable, I co-wrote and produced over 30 to 40 songs for The Roots. You know, I’ve worked with Jill Scott, I’ve worked with Young Jeezy, and I’ve worked in television and film. So, making money in the music industry is pretty much like a no-brainer. Right now, while I’m standing here with you I’m making money. Finance is not really a big problem for me. It never really was a focus. It never even came into my creativity [realm]. ‘I can’t say this because—or I don’t want to say this because’— of anything in particular—I’ve never felt that way. I’ve always been the kind of person who was going to say what I wanted to say and when I wanted to say it. I don’t care about money. Money is one of the least things on my mind. The biggest thing on my mind is taking care of my family. Being healthy, loving people that I love and who love me, and staying focused; that are [some of the things that] I’m focused on.  This is why I’m passionate about these things. Dr. Michelle Alexander, her book, The New Jim Crow, is one of the main reasons why I made this album. Reading her book—or listening to the audio book. I was blown away by her statistics, and the way she puts it all together, and the way she adds it all up. It makes me want to open up a different narrative to Hip-Hop. It’s kinda what I do on The Roots albums with my partner, Black Thought. It’s the same things which I did with this record. It’s more of a social commentary and it’s more specific. I think what The Roots have always done is they've always been champions of injustice, trying to enlighten, and to inspire people. AllHipHop.com: In life, sometimes our blessings may be camouflaged as challenges. Who and or what circumstances have best taught you to use your discretion, strength, and loyalty to navigate stressful situations? Dice Raw: Well, the first thing is that I try not to even subscribe to stressful situations or even to the word stress. Stress is fear. Basically, I’m not afraid of any outcome. Man makes the plans and God makes the outcome. So, stress is not something that I subscribe to. One thing I can say is that there are different times in my life where I feel like they’re harder than others. The way I get through those things are by being honest with myself. I try to tap into my own emotions on determining how I feel about these situations and not let it become masqueraded behind anger, or greed, or different things that can only lead down a dark path. The Sidebar: “Well, I just want to let everyone know that the album is coming out December 10th. You can pre-order it right now on iTunes , Amazon, or CD Baby. I also want to thank Dr. Michelle Alexander for being so supportive with everything she’s done for the cause. And I want thank AllHipHop’s Grouchy Greg and Chuck!” – Dice Raw ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912204768.52/warc/CC-MAIN-20190326014605-20190326040605-00363.warc.gz

But thinking all battle emcees are like the Chappelle Show skit is not even fair! This is true of a few but not of the majority and some are even able to crossover and graduate to the type of booth and stage emcees that seem to get more respect. Let us be clear, having a battle background makes those artists even more well rounded and solid within their crafts! A battle emcee will still tear everyone in the room up with their verbal ability regardless of if they are battling other emcees or merely battling themselves on a verse!  Check out 5 former battle emcees that made the transition whom we enjoy in either realm. This list is in no order and by no means are these the only guys out here who have done it but we must start somewhere! That said check out the list! Loaded Lux Rone Serius Jones Soul Khan  And finally the way the song is REALLY supposed to go!

So, now we're counting on you to shout them out in the comments! Who is the dopest battle emcee that you know of who is making that transition? Who do you feel we should acknowledge next? Let's discuss it!  ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202889.30/warc/CC-MAIN-20190323161556-20190323183556-00030.warc.gz
10,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/5-times-hip-hop-videos-games-made-great-music-B5ZVPJjc1UCAFnubfC7uwA/,"AllHipHop Features) Fortnite is everywhere right now, from memes and the news to the UMBC men’s basketball locker room. Back in February, Fortnite solidified itself as the top game with 3.4 million players online at once. If you’re old and dusty and wondering what Fortnite is, it’s a popular multi-platform battle royale game. Battle royale games are basically a video game version of The Hunger Games; players start with nothing and have to search for guns to fight to the death. 100 play, but only 1 wins. So why does all of this matter in the context of Hip-Hop? Last week, Twitch streamer and Fortnite pro Ninja teamed up with Drake for what was the largest stream by an individual streamer in Twitch history, drawing 628k viewers at its peak. Travis Scott and Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster even joined in for a few matches. This isn’t the first time we’ve seen Hip-Hop and video games come together. The two may not be as intertwined as rap and sports, but you can find video game references and influence all throughout rap. In honor of this unlikely yet entertaining moment, here are some of the best fusions of Hip-Hop and video games. 5. Beanie Sigel - “Mac Man” A hardened street vet like Beanie Sigel may be the last person you’d expect to pick up the sticks, but his 2000 song “Mac Man” was a masterclass in video game metaphors. The beat is mostly comprised of Pac-Man eating dots while Beans imagines a world where he and his video game cohorts run the drug game. Donkey Kong, the Mario Brothers, and Frogger all play a hand in the virtual trafficking that makes this one of the best video game–related tracks of all time. 4. Def Jam video games If you’ve never played the Def Jam video games, stop reading this, buy them off eBay, and dust off your PS2. As gimmicky as these games looked, all but the first actually had really solid fighting mechanics and a fire story mode. Plus, who wouldn’t want to beat the hell out of people with N.O.R.E. or show somebody what happens when you don’t move for Luda? 4. NBA Street Vol. 2 There were so many great things about NBA Street Vol. 2, from the odd cast of characters to the classic commentary. But what I remember most about this game is the soundtrack. As soon as the game is done loading, you’re greeted with Pete Rock and CL Smooth’s “They Reminisce Over You (T.R.O.Y.).” From there, you get everything from Redman and MC Lyte to Erick Sermon, Nate Dogg and Eve. As far as video game soundtracks go, that’s a hard lineup to beat. 2. Sonic the Hamilton mixtape A lot of rappers like video games, but few have dedicated an entire mixtape and persona to it. For Charles Hamilton, Sonic the Hedgehog is more than a video game. Sonic the Hamilton was not only a great mixtape, it was unique; it used samples from the games’ various zones and was absolutely packed with Sonic references. This is a great tape if you like some nostalgia in your music, and it’s one of the better Charles Hamilton projects. 1. “Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis…” These words are so iconic that even the whitest of suburban dads could probably finish the bar for you. A Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis might not sound like much to today’s youth, but it was the stuff of dreams at one point in time. And for somebody who came from nothing and became the king of New York, these words symbolized a historic rise. 22 years later, BIG’s “Juicy” is still one of the most popular Hip-Hop songs and the blueprint for anybody on the come-up.

While in police custody, Mr. Gray would later succumb to fatal injuries that he allegedly sustained at the hands of his arresting officers. Given his untimely demise, the city of Baltimore collectively voiced its frustration and held several protests.  Back on April 19, Freddie Gray died from the fatal injuries that were inflicted to his spine. On the day of Freddie's funeral, April 27, an ominous newsletter was issued on behalf of the Baltimore Police Department's media office. It insisted that the Crips, the Bloods, and the Black Guerilla Family threatened violence, this according to VICE.  Since then, a a widely circulated email communication has surfaced from employees of the Department of Homeland Security. It strongly questions the validity of the BPD's initial newsletter. Earl Rose IV, a DHS intelligence officer, received an email from a concerned employee who works at the Maryland Fusion Center in the intelligence & analysis. That source conveyed his angst regarding the supposed threat of gang violence and wrote the following message: “The gist of this alert asserts that the BGF [Black Guerilla Family], the Bloods, and the Crips, have partnered to ‘take out’ law enforcement. The alert says this is a credible threat, but, I do not know if that ‘credible threat’ means that they actually have specific information or that the 3 groups involved have credibility in taking that kind of action against law enforcement, I would assert that it’s the latter...""

McColister opens the 13-track collection by asking the listener: “If I give you all of me, would I get all of you?” - letting us know the Floridian is not only about to share his personal thoughts, but he’s also requesting we use his words as motivation to reflect on our own perceptions and emotions. In my one-on-one conversation with Ace, the Hood Nation label founder delves even deeper into the concept behind Trust The Process. He also explains his progression as an artist and as a human.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnoQmPzsoDc  AllHipHop: Are you still living in Florida? Were you affected by the hurricane? Ace Hood: Yeah, I live in Florida. I’m always going to be a Florida boy. I stayed through the hurricane. We had power outages in my neighborhood where we were for about a day. A lot of big trees were lifted up but there wasn't too much crazy damage, thank God. AllHipHop: Let’s get into the project. Can you explain your thoughts behind the title? Ace Hood: I’ve always been a man of faith. For anything I’ve done in my life, God has always been at the forefront when it comes to decisions. So for me, it’s always been about trusting what’s happening around me and keeping faith that things will work out for the better. For my career and for obstacles I’ve been dealing with in my life, I have to trust the process. It was about trying to find a title that represented where I am, where I came from, and where I’m going. Trust The Process was just the perfect title for anybody in a situation that believe things are going to work out and who just trust that path, trust that journey, and trust themselves enough to be able to pull themselves out of that. AllHipHop: I noticed that you limited the features. Was there a particular reason why? Ace Hood: It’s my story. I wanted it to be as true to me as possible. I just really wanted to get across to people, not only to highlight my creative side, but to also show them my lyrical side and show them my songwriting side. The old stigma placed on me before was I always have features. So for me, it was to mainly show the fans that I’m more than well capable of always holding my own on any record.  The deluxe version has two features on it, but just with the people I have real relationships with, not industry relationships. People that I got love for who are up-and-coming. But I just wanted to get my story across. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJNuCpwJkZc  AllHipHop: You mentioned the word “stigma.” Do you feel like the industry or consumers placed you in a certain box musically? Ace Hood: I think they tried to at some point. People are used to seeing me a certain way, seeing me with Khaled. You know, everything’s large with the cars, clothing, and jewelry - the lifestyle. I can understand that. I was implemented into a system, so I think for a while the fans tried to box that in. What I wanted to show on this project is that I can’t be boxed in.  My whole transition from where I was before to where I am now was to relieve myself of all stigmas and be a free, independent artist. That was really my main focus. The artist that I am is about not wanting to be boxed in, but I saw my history going to a place where people expected me to talk about this thing and only this thing. But I feel like we’re slowly transitioning people into seeing things in a very different manner and seeing me in a very different light. AllHipHop: You don’t necessarily refer to Trust The Process as a mixtape or an album. Ace Hood: It’s a project. AllHipHop: Do you plan on dropping an official studio album? Ace Hood: Absolutely. I want to connect with the people a lot more - being that this is a new energy with a more laser-focused direction. It’s all new, so I think it’s important that we work the people into that slowly, letting the people know I’ve grown tremendously, but haven’t totally forgotten who I was or where I’ve been.  That part of me still very much lives as well as the new Ace that lives in me now. In order to do that, I think it takes Trust The Process and a few other projects for them to start getting on board and knowing what’s happening. Then when the time is right, we’ll drop a studio album. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYij6nUnLfk  AllHipHop: You’ve talked about this being a transition for you. How have your longtime fans responded to that? Ace Hood: They responded tremendously. It’s not a full transition. I’m a more focused individual than I was before. I’ve always made the records that could move people like ""Hustle Hard"" and “We Outchea,” cool records like “Bugatti.” I think now it’s I’m able to focus that in and not be all over the place.  Records that I probably wouldn’t choose as singles before, I would choose them now. Because I’m bringing to the forefront this whole human thing. People are coming along very well with it which I’m very happy about. AllHipHop: Speaking of “Bugatti,” that’s one of your biggest hits. Future and Rick Ross are on there. You’ve worked with Ross a lot throughout your career. You talked before about how you wanted to limit your features to people that are close to you. I was wondering what is your relationship with [Ross] like now because you guys have had that long history of collaborating? Ace Hood: At this point, we have a mutual love and respect for one another. I don’t talk to Ross as often as I have done in the past. But if I see him, it’s all love. Dealing with the situation I was dealing with, I think things kind of got a little different which is normal. But it’s love and it’s always going to be love. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djE-BLrdDDc AllHipHop: Over the last couple of years we’ve seen a lot of artists from Florida emerge on the national landscape. With you being one of the most successful rappers to come out of that state, what are your thoughts about the Hip Hop culture in Florida, particularly South Florida, right now? Ace Hood: I think it’s in a very different space. I think it’s in a very interesting space, to say the least. I just think that it’s interesting to see how the times have changed, where it’s leading, and where it’s gone at this point. In my mind, anybody that has an opportunity to feed their family and loved ones, I salute you. More power to you. But I think it’s in a very, very different space. AllHipHop: We've talked about the project. You have a deluxe version and maybe an album coming in the future. Are you planning to do any videos? Ace Hood: I’ve been shooting visuals as we speak. I’m planning on shooting a majority of the visuals off Trust The Process. Just because I want my fans to not only be able to feel the music, but I want them to see it and understand my thought process and ideas behind all these records. So a bunch of visuals are coming soon off of the project. AllHipHop: Will this be an actual visual project? Are all of the videos going to be connected in a story? Ace Hood: Yeah. They can expect like a short film.   AllHipHop: You’re very open about your life on social media. Have you ever thought about transitioning from the internet to doing reality TV with your family? Ace Hood: No. AllHipHop: That was pretty definitive. [laughs] That was really straightforward. You didn’t even think about it. Ace Hood: [laughs] Yeah, that was pretty straightforward. It’s so funny because anybody who tries to involve me in that - because we get calls about it - I’m always like, “Nope.” I just have nothing to say after that. It just isn’t me, isn’t us. It isn’t what me and my woman are trying to represent. It’s not what I want for my family.  I don’t need to promote my life for any type of financial gain. My lifestyle is kind of like a “take me how I am” type thing. The closest I would get to that is acting and doing TV in other ways. I don’t necessarily even support reality TV, so for me to be apart of it wouldn’t be authentic to who I am. I ain’t that type of guy. I’m not built for the drama and people lying. I live a very different life, thank God.  I wouldn’t be interesting enough for reality TV. [laughs] People want drama, negativity, and commotion. People want all that, and I ain’t got nothing but love. We deal with all our sh-t with love. AllHipHop: But you would be interested in doing scripted work like a TV show or film? Ace Hood: Definitely, when the time is right. I want to branch off into acting, modeling, and owning cologne lines. I’m a huge cologne connoisseur. I’m definitely the type of person who wants to be universal. I’m going to be all across the board when it comes to branding myself. Acting is definitely one of the key components that I want to tap into at some point in my life. AllHipHop: I noticed you sent out a tweet where you said, “Happiness is the new rich.” Can you just expound on that thought? Ace Hood: I think people are starting to wake up more. People are investing in themselves a lot more. That’s what I mean. It’s not from a financial standpoint. It’s just evaluating what’s important to you and to nourish and put life into that. Because happiness is the purest form of love - whether that’s love with yourself, love in a job that you love doing, love for your partner, or whatever it may be.  Granted people would say, “That’s coming from a person who’s rich.” It isn’t that because I actually found it’s less about the money. My true happiness started to come when I invested more in myself. I was able to be a happy person and love what I’m doing as opposed to looking for outside validation.  I think people are waking up and understanding what’s valuable out here in the world. Being happy is amazing, and I think that’s true richness. Being happy looks like taking care of yourself, being healthy, representing yourself well. People can have all the money, but I’m centered, strong, and healthy. To me, that’s true richness. Purchase Ace Hood’s music on iTunes. Stream his music on Spotify, Tidal, and SoundCloud.

What began as an independent emcee adding a free debut mixtape to SC turned into a Grammy-winning career and a coveted hosting gig on Saturday Night Live. Following the success of Uzi, Post, Chance, and others, fans have even dubbed a new class of performers as “SoundCloud Rappers.” Acts like Lil Pump, XXXTentacion, Tekashi 6ix9ine, and YBN Nahmir currently monopolize the site as Millennials and Gen Z members repeatedly stream the rhymers' songs on the app millions of times a week. SoundCloud hosts over 165 million tracks, and more than 10 million creators are heard on the platform monthly. The audio service founded by Alexander Ljung and Eric Wahlforss in 2007 has undoubtedly found favor with music lovers and has cemented its place in the modern entertainment lexicon. While the creative side of SoundCloud seemed to flourish, the financial side faced a public relations nightmare this summer. Reports began to circulate that the business laid off 40% of its workers and it only had enough funding to survive through the fourth quarter of this year. Not long after those negative headlines had many users and artists worrying about what would happen to the digital music hangout spot, it was announced The Raine Group and Temasek invested a reported $169.5 million into the company. In addition, former Vimeo CEO Kerry Trainor was named SoundCloud’s new Chief Executive, replacing Ljung. I had the chance to speak with Trainor about the state of SoundCloud and its mission to enable creators to connect with worldwide listeners. He also discussed rap’s preeminence on the platform, the Premier Partner program, and the popularity of podcasts. AllHipHop: Congratulations on the new position as CEO. Kerry Trainor: Thanks, Yohance. I appreciate it. AllHipHop: Have you had time to settle into the position? Kerry Trainor: We’re getting there. I’m excited to be part of the platform. I’ve been a fan for a long time, since before I had the opportunity to join. We’re getting settled in. I completely believe in the mission. It’s an incredibly exciting time at SoundCloud. Particularly for everything that’s happening in Hip Hop. AllHipHop: I was looking at the Top 30 tracks on SoundCloud’s music chart, and I noticed all of them are Hip Hop/Rap. Why do you think SoundCloud has become such a popular platform for rappers and rap fans? Kerry Trainor: I think it’s been an incredible few years for Hip Hop in general. We’re excited to be part. SoundCloud’s mission is we’re here to empower creators and give them the tools to build their fan bases and careers on their own terms and connect with a level of immediacy with their fans that’s really only possible through an open platform. We’re all about being first, and SoundCloud is first for creators in terms of where they bring their art to the world. And it’s first for listeners, in that, if you want to discover what’s really new and coming next in music, you come to SoundCloud. That’s why we're incredibly excited to see the huge blowout on the charts this year from Lil Uzi and Post Malone. The artists that are having so much success now started on the platform years ago. The reason is because SoundCloud is the truly open platform where creators can get their start and connect directly with their audience. It’s unlike any of the other streaming services. I think what we’re seeing today is incredible growth and progression of these artists who started on SoundCloud years ago. AllHipHop: You mentioned how artists like Lil Uzi and Post Malone first started on SoundCloud. Traditionally in Hip Hop, deejays have been the outlets that broke new artists. Do you feel like SoundCloud has replaced that? Kerry Trainor: I don’t know if it’s replaced that, but it’s certainly provided a new powerful channel for any creator to have access to a global audience. That’s an incredibly powerful effect of technology and the web. So for these creators to be able to start on SoundCloud, develop access to a global audience, develop their following, have that following help spread the word - I wouldn’t say it’s replaced [the deejay]. The impact of great curators can do that as well. But SoundCloud provided a powerful new channel for these artists, and I think they’re taking advantage of it by having this direct connection with their fans when they’re dropping new material, stuff that’s a work in progress, collaborating with each other, and using SoundCloud to its full potential. AllHipHop: Over the last year or so, there’s been this new subgenre of Hip Hop that’s referred to as “SoundCloud Rap.” Does the company embrace that name for this new generation of artists? Kerry Trainor: In terms of this group of artists, to me, they are about their immediacy and connection to their audience. The way that they access their audience through SoundCloud speaks to connecting with that fan base without anybody else in the way. Our mission is to provide the tools, the platform, and the environment for creators to do their best work. Then we want to be out of their way. So for us, [""SoundCloud Rap""] encapsulates that. It’s a mission we believe very deeply about, and that’s what we’re in the world to do - empower artists and be that first place where they access their audience and that first place where listeners can find those creators doing incredible things. AllHipHop: You’ve been talking about how a lot of artists started on SoundCloud then became stars. I noticed that a lot of the top rappers or the most popular ones on the platform at the moment are associated with major labels. But what advice would you give to an indie artist or an up-and-coming artist looking to gain traction on SoundCloud? Kerry Trainor: I think in terms of choosing SoundCloud to be that first place, there are lots of different approaches, and that’s what is exciting about it. Whether creators choose to put a work-in-progress out, start with mixtapes or smaller EPs, or collaborate with other artists, there are tons of ways to start to build traction. Whether an artist chooses to go with a major label or a label of any size is totally their option. I think it’s a great path and makes sense for some artists. Then you also have incredible creators like Chance [The Rapper] who chooses to stay independent, continue to use SoundCloud, and demonstrate that’s a viable path as well. I think the key for artists starting out is to get that immediate feedback from your audience. You can post on SoundCloud and get those first few comments, shares, and likes. This isn’t a one-way pipe. This is about a two-way experience between the creator and the audience. It starts by getting that feedback and using SoundCloud to build those first interactions. That’s what it’s all about. AllHipHop: You mentioned Chance. He’s been a very outspoken supporter of SoundCloud. He even gave you guys a shout out at an Awards show. How involved is he with the company? There were reports that he is helping the development of SoundCloud or helping financially. Kerry Trainor: Chance is an incredible creator. We love that he chooses SoundCloud to be the place to bring his art to the world. I’ve been in touch with him and his team multiple times since I’ve joined. We’re really excited to support him in any way we can, and he’s been incredibly supportive of SoundCloud as well. So we’re excited to continue to do things together in the future. AllHipHop: Another artist I thought about is Russ. He uploaded a song to SoundCloud [a week]. He even called himself the “King of SoundCloud."" How do you think his rise on the platform impacted other artists in the way they use SoundCloud? Kerry Trainor: I think it’s another example that there are so many different approaches. That’s another powerful thing about SoundCloud which is you don’t have to release tracks, albums, or anything in prepackaged shapes or sizes. You can do it in whatever way which suits your creative vision and suits your connection with your audience. Whether it’s multiple tracks at once, whether it’s spread out, whether it’s about collaborations, whether it’s about remixes - it’s really whatever the creator chooses to do. I think every example of pushing the boundaries of the formats, shapes, and sizes of tracks that ultimately reaches the audience is incredible. That’s one of the things that makes the platform totally about free expression of the creator. AllHipHop: Another way Hip Hop fans interact with SoundCloud is by following podcasts like The Brilliant Idiots, The Read, Bodega Boys, and The Joe Budden Podcast. They’ve become an important part of our culture. How valuable has the podcast community been for SoundCloud? Kerry Trainor: Podcasting is a huge part of SoundCloud. It’s not as large as the music side, but we are one of the largest hosting platforms for podcasts in the world. It’s something that we continue to hear great feedback on. We’ll absolutely be developing something as we move forward, so stay tuned for more to come on the podcast front. We’re doing more for creators there as well as making podcasts easier to find and consume alongside your favorite music. AllHipHop: Can you give information about the Partners program? What’s the status of that? Kerry Trainor: SoundCloud Premier is something we’re really excited to expand. This is a program where artists can have a direct revenue sharing relationship with us. If they decide not to go the route of a major label deal or a publishing deal, they can work directly with us to get a share of the revenue associated with their music. So we support hundreds of artists today, and those artists receive millions of dollars in revenue sharing from SoundCloud. We’re excited to expand that in the future. AllHipHop: So right now it’s limited to certain artists? Kerry Trainor: We set up the first round and, like I said, we have hundreds of artists in the program. We’re excited to expand that and build out some of the tools so we can open that up to more artists. AllHipHop: There’s been some concern about the future of SoundCloud. Can you reassure the public that the platform is stable? Kerry Trainor: We would love to reassure the public that SoundCloud is 100% here to stay. The deal that we did over the summer fully capitalizes the company so we could keep it independent and make sure we have the resources we need to build out this awesome platform for serving creators. So that mission of empowering creators and being the first place that they come to build their careers and the first place the listeners discover them is absolutely here to stay. The company is in great shape from an investment perspective. That’s why I’m incredibly excited to be part of it, and I look forward to the next chapter. ​ Follow SoundCloud on Twitter @SoundCloud and Instagram @soundcloud.

14,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/a-conversation-with-phresher-on-eminem-cardi-b-brooklyn-new-music-9Qq8vVv0x0CcvYnYt-6cyQ/,"The man born Kashaun Rutling then got a bonus package when his appearance as the performer on Slim Shady’s original ""Chloraseptic"" hook was extended to include a full verse on the remix. Veteran Atlanta rapper 2 Chainz was also given time to spit bars on the newer version of the cut. Before linking with Em and Chainz for ""Chloraseptic (Remix),"" Phresher had already recorded tracks with Desiigner, Remy Ma, Jim Jones, and Cardi B. The Brooklyn-bred MC initially gained traction on the net and in the club with his 2016 banger “Wait A Minute,” and he’s now close to dropping a full project titled PH. Tidal recently highlighted Phresher by allowing him to introduce the world to his East New York neighborhood in the Where I'm From documentary. I got the chance to chat with the DGYGZ artist about the mini-film, his high-profile collaborations, his hometown rap scene, and more. AllHipHop: Your year ended on a big note. You appeared on Eminem’s Revival album. I saw you reposted a video where Danny Duces was talking about people hating on you for a minute then when you got on the album they started to show you love. Have you experienced people approaching you differently or having a different opinion about you since that album came out? Phresher: Yeah, of course. I expect it though. I never take it personal. It’s music. Critics and people are either going to love you or hate you. If you f-ck with me, I appreciate it. If you don’t, I appreciate it too. Hate is a form of flattery to me. I always just try to find the good in everything. Some people wrote me off, and they’re now back on the bandwagon. It’s all good. AllHipHop: I’m sure you picked up a lot of new fans too. Being on an Eminem album is huge. Especially since you were the only rapper. Phresher: It’s a little different now. I’m getting people from Germany. I got a lot of white fans now too. They didn’t really know me before. It’s broadened my horizons. It’s like it’s brought me a new set of fans, and I appreciate that. Shout out to the new fans. I’m coming with a new mixtape, so they’ll really understand what PH is all about. AllHipHop: A lot of people were shocked when the remix dropped. You had talked about how you recorded a verse and 2 Chainz talked about recording a verse, but I don’t think people were expecting that remix. Phresher: I knew it was coming.  AllHipHop: Was that the original verse you recorded? Phresher: Yeah, that’s me and 2 Chainz’s original verses. AllHipHop: Obviously, Em’s verse was different. What was your reaction when you heard that verse? Phresher: I was not shocked. I was more amazed. Em is my favorite artist, so that’s not surprising to me. I know how Em gets when you get on his nerves. He lashes out, and I loved it. That’s the Marshall Mathers I know.  AllHipHop: You also collaborated with Cardi B. Can you talk about how “Right Now” came together? Phresher: Me and Cardi are actually good friends. She was supposed to do the “Wait A Minute (Remix)” but due to a lot of bullsh-t we couldn’t release her part. Cardi B was actually in the video and everything. Some people were hating on her situation. That’s before she really broke, but I seen it. I was going through it with a bigger artist about her being on it, so she didn’t make the video. So we just decided we were going to do our own thing. We got together and did “Right Now.” AllHipHop: Do you mean the official remix? Was she supposed to do the video with you and Remy? Phresher: Yeah, she was actually on it. It was crazy. But a lot of bullsh-t happened and we weren’t able to release that particular footage. It’s all good though. Shout out to Cardi. AllHipHop: I saw the documentary you have on Tidal. What did it feel like going back to your neighborhood to shoot that doc? Phresher: That was awesome. Shout out to Tidal. I’m really thankful to them for appreciating my music and documenting my story. Going back to the neighborhood, the hood appreciated it. I try to inspire people. Where I come from, nobody makes it out. I’m like the first one from that neighborhood on a big scale, so they appreciate when I come back. I’m just trying to inspire the young boys and the older guys too. I got good standing in the neighborhood and I’m well respected. But what I’m doing right now - they're wearing it like it’s them on the album, they sing “Wait A Minute” like it’s their song, because I’m like all we got.  AllHipHop: There was a moment in the doc where your mom talked about how you decided to leave school and pursue music. At what point did you realize that was the direction you needed to take? Phresher: My parents are big on school. My dad was a thug in the streets, so he didn’t finish school. My mother was big on education. She’s in the education system now, so she’s been a teacher for years. So I told my mom that I could always go back to school. Sometimes you gotta take chances in life, you got to get yours. Some people don’t see it like you see it sometimes. My mom couldn’t see it. I had to prove to my mom: “Let me go for it.” I did it and now it’s starting to pay off. She never doubted me, but she’s a ""Plan B,"" ""Plan C"" kind of person. AllHipHop: You’ve talked about being a big fan of Jay-Z. I think it’s an inspirational life journey that you went from being his fan to having your content on a platform that he’s part of.  Phresher: That’s what I’m saying. It’s amazing. I’m always trying to do what’s next. It’s so funny how things work out. I didn’t see this happening in a million years. When I was doing music, I was just doing it because I wanted to be known, I wanted to be famous. I just felt my character is so big that it’s bottled up if I’m not on TV or on the radio. To be on Eminem’s album and then to be on Tidal, my favorite artists’ platforms, is amazing. AllHipHop: And it happened back to back. Phresher: On Eminem’s remix I said, “I feel entitled to Tidal. F-ck it, man, I want the title. Submission, they gotta go viral.” That sat right with Tidal. People were talking about it. Certain people from Tidal called my manager. I had to give the exact lyrics. When I wrote that, it wasn’t about [connecting with Tidal]. I was doing it because I mentioned my favorite artist [Jay-Z]. It’s crazy how things work out. AllHipHop: What are your thoughts about a lot of attention being back on Brooklyn, in part because of artists like yourself, Jay Critch, Young M.A, and 6ix9ine? Phresher: This is what it’s supposed to be like. This is the way it used to be. There was a drought. There’s no doubt about it, there was a drought in Brooklyn music as far as artists being really known outside of New York. It’s a collaborative effort. We just gotta keep working and keep putting on for the city.  AllHipHop: You've mentioned that you have another project coming out this year. Phresher: Yeah, PH. It’s coming out next month. AllHipHop: Is that going to be a studio album or a mixtape? Well I guess nowadays it doesn't really matter. I’m just wondering how you’re labeling it. Phresher: Yeah, mixtape, album - it doesn’t matter. It’s a project. It’s getting to know who I am, what I do, and how versatile I am. I just gotta go into 2018 the right way. AllHipHop: Can you talk about any of the producers or features you have on there? Phresher: For producers, I got Reazy Renegade. I got IllaDaProducer. He produced “Wait A Minute.” I got Go Grizzly. For features, we got Jay Critch, Don Q, DreamDoll, Cardi B, and a couple more. We’re waiting for some things to come in. It’ll be wrapped up in the next few weeks. I’m very excited. AllHipHop: Those features are very New York.  Phresher: Oh yeah, we got Philthy Rich from the Bay. We got Derez De’Shon from Atlanta. We’re working. AllHipHop: You’ve been releasing music through Empire Distribution. Are you interested in signing with a major? Phresher: We’re working all that out right now. I got some unfinished business with Empire. Then we’re going to jump into a major situation. AllHipHop: What else do you have planned for the year? You’ve got the project coming. I’m sure there will be visuals with that. Phresher: We’re shooting a lot of visuals now. I want to say we’ll be putting out two visuals per month. That’s the goal now, no less than two. Maybe three sometimes. Some people don’t even know how I look. That’s from a lack of content out, so we want to definitely put out more content. A lot of visuals. A lot of audio. We’re going to really hit the ground running this year. I have so much music. We’re holding nothing back this year. We’re letting go. Watch Phresher’s Where I'm From documentary on Tidal.

15,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/a-conversation-with-q-money-on-going-viral-cheez-app-challenge-more-DSy3dnxSRESkRvv2s_D69w/,"Q Money may not be a household name at the moment, but a vid of the Cleveland rapper dancing to his own song “Work” did ignite the #QMoneyChallenge. After millions of views, it wasn’t long before established stars such as Meek Mill, Teyana Taylor, and Tony Romo were acknowledging Q’s social media impact. The “Never Had it” rhymer is now giving fans the chance to win $5000 in cash and $2000 of Popular Demand merchandise. Q Money partnered with Live.me’s Cheez for the video maker’s Dance Off feature. Users can enter for a chance to win the prize by downloading the app and submitting their own #QMoneyChallenge performances.  ""We're having a lot of fun creating different features for Cheez that allow us to develop unique partnerships like the one we have with Q Money. It's great working with an artist who is so excited about new technology, and isn't afraid to experiment and create unique experience to their fans,"" states Khudor Annous, Head of Marketing and Partnerships for Live.me Inc. ""The Dance Off feature in Cheez has been a huge hit and users are going to love seeing some of the surprises we have planned for them in the future."" Find out more about Q Money and his online ascension in the latest edition of the Conversations series. AllHipHop: How did you first get started making music? Q Money: I first got started rapping about a year and a half ago. I used to sell drugs. Me and my partner used to always go to the studio. That’s where we conducted business and had people meet us because he was really into rapping. There was a time where I caught a case. So I was like, “I’m done with this. I have to stop selling drugs and find something else to do.” So I’m just in the studio, and one day I was just like, ""Let me hop on this song.” They were struggling on the last verse, so they said, “Okay, go head.” So I hopped on there and spoke my piece. Everybody was surprised like, “How long you been rapping.” I was like, “This is my first time.” Then I let my momma hear it. She said, “That sounds good, Q. I think you should make a song yourself.” So then I ended up making a song. I started getting addicted to recording. Every time I got like $25 I would record a song. I just had money, but I went broke ‘cause I caught this case. I had to pay for lawyers to fight the case. It was to the point that I was scrambling to get that $25 to go to the studio. AllHipHop: At that point, did you just start putting music online? Q Money: Nah, I never had the courage to put the music up. I was sitting on all that music. I didn’t know if people were really gonna listen to my music. One day I finally got the courage to put my song up. I’m thinking when I put my song up I’m about to crash the internet with 700 followers. I finally put the link out and only got 130 views on the song, so I was disappointed. I was thinking I would at least get 1000 views. I saw the result from just putting “click the link in my bio.” So I said I gotta find something else to do to separate me from the rest of the people. I found something else, that was dancing to my own music. I was known for turning the whole club up, so I started doing that to my own music on Instagram. AllHipHop: At what point did you realize “Work” and the #QMoneyChallenge was taking off? Q Money: When I got out of jail, I started recording more music. I recorded “Work” and then did a dance video to it with a real mirror in my hand. It went viral.  AllHipHop: What was your reaction to seeing Teyana Taylor and Tony Romo talking about your dance and your music? Q Money: That was big for me. That was the last two people I would expect to see talking about the dance and the music. I was like, “Wow. That’s crazy."" It motivates me because I’m thinking, “If I got legendary people talking about me, then I’m going to be legendary.” AllHipHop: There was also a video going around of Meek Mill checking out your music. Did you get the chance to talk to him? Q Money: I actually talked to him right before he sent that video and right before he went through everything that he's got going on with court. I talked to him right before that. He was telling me he was gonna see if the judge would let him come down to Atlanta. If he did come down to Atlanta, we were gonna link up. I wrote him a letter. I’m waiting for him to respond. They confirmed he got the letter, so I’ll still be keeping in touch. AllHipHop: You put out a collaboration with Cuban Doll. How did that come together? Q Money: We was in the studio. The first day I met her, I was feeling her. We put the beat on and it just went down like that. AllHipHop: Did you shoot your shot? Q Money: I definitely shot my shot. You know I shot my shot. AllHipHop: How’d that turn out? Q Money: [laughs] We don’t kiss and tell. You know females like when somebody can dance.  AllHipHop: Do you have any other collaborations on the way? Q Money: I got a few with Money Man. I got a few with my fellow Cleveland artists - my brother Chrisbo185. He’s from my area. We got some stuff coming. I’m going through a tracklist right now to see what other people I should put on my songs.  AllHipHop: You talked about working with other Cleveland artists. Cleveland has a long history in Hip Hop with acts like Bone Thugs, Kid Cudi, and MGK, but the city hasn’t seen that big wave like you’ve seen with other cities. What are your thoughts on the Hip Hop scene there right now? Q Money: It’s on the rise. AllHipHop: Do you see the city having its breakout moment like other cities in the last few years? Q Money: I definitely do if we all support each other and stick together. We got a lot of different artists. There are signed artists coming out of Cleveland. AllHipHop: What’s your relationship with TIG Records? Are you signed to them? Q Money: No, I’m not signed. I’m weighing my options. But I knew somebody on TIG that’s close to the label that I trust, but I never did nothing like that. It was one of my friends that I been had a relationship with. AllHipHop: So you are open to possibly signing with a label? Q Money: Yeah. AllHipHop: How did you connect with Cheez for the dance challenge? Q Money: I met them when we were out in LA. We were throwing ideas around. We came up with an idea to do a Dance Dance Revolution type thing. Then we said let’s make it happen and we went from there. AllHipHop: Have you played the game yourself? Q Money: I was just playing it. I’m about to hop back on there. AllHipHop: What were your scores like? Q Money: I got like a 5000. It’s up there. AllHipHop: Can we expect more from that partnership with Cheez? Q Money: Definitely. Everything’s going good right now. A lot of people are engaging with the app, so it’s looking like it definitely could be more on the way. AllHipHop: Earlier, you talked about going through a tracklist to decide collaborators. Does that mean you have plans to release a full project? Q Money: Yeah, I’m releasing a full project real soon. I don’t know the exact date, but it’s gonna be within the next two months or next month and a half. Stream Q Money’s music on Apple Music, Spotify, Tidal and SoundCloud.

16,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/a-conversation-with-ray-romulus-on-3-grammy-noms-bruno-mars-more-_Z6kVjq56kqdCVbDDgPxoQ/,"For that chart-topping single, Bruno joined with the LA-based production team known as The Stereotypes. The musical collective made up of Ray Romulus, Jonathan Yip, Jeremy Reeves, and Charm also assisted in providing the soundscape for the 24K Magic title track and the album cut “Finesse.” Additionally, The Stereotypes’ 2017 included producing Sevyn Streeter’s “Before I Do,” Fifth Harmony’s “Deliver,” Iggy Azalea’s “Bounce,” Lil Yachty’s “Better” featuring Stefflon Don, and Kyle’s “Sunshine” featuring Miguel. The Recording Academy recognized Romulus, Yip, Reeves, and Charm's prolific output over a 12 month period by nominating the foursome for the Producer Of The Year, Non-Classical award.  By ending the year with three Grammy noms and platinum-certified singles, The Stereotypes are going into 2018 as some of the most lauded music creators in the industry. I recently spoke with Ray Romulus about his squad’s remarkable run in ‘17. We also chatted about their upcoming work, the profitability of music streaming, and more. AllHipHop: First off, congratulations on the Grammy nominations. Ray Romulus: Thank you. I really appreciate that. AllHipHop: What was it like finding out you’re up for three awards? Ray Romulus: Honestly, it was a very stunning moment. We all kind of froze when we heard the news that we were nominated for those three awards. Especially Producer Of The Year because it’s one of those things where you work so hard, you feel like you’re doing great stuff, but you never think that people are actually paying attention. So to wake up in the morning to hear that is like, “Wow! That’s really crazy!” AllHipHop: The other two nominations are connected to Bruno Mars’ “That’s What I Like.” At the time you were putting that song together, did you have a feeling it was going to resonate with so many people? Ray Romulus: I didn’t know the song was going to be as big as it was, but we knew the song was really dope. We all came together and it was like one big party while creating it. Obviously, we were super excited about Bruno having us involved in that creative process. AllHipHop: How did you all connect with him? Ray Romulus: Our relationship with Bruno goes back to 2007 when we were all into songwriting and trying to get placements. They were like our go-to team. We were just friends that were making music every day. We were basically coming up together. Bruno produced and was featured on a song with B.o.B - “Nothin’ On You” - and he got his solo deal at Atlantic. He put out a solo project and became huge. We didn’t work [together] for awhile. We then reconnected last year. He asked us to come in, and it was like a party again. As soon as we came back in, it was like no time had ever passed. We were just happy for us reconnecting. AllHipHop: I read that you guys were actually considering stepping away from music at one point. Ray Romulus: Yeah, up until like the middle of last year we felt like we were working our asses off, putting everything into what we do every day, and it can be very demoralizing when the results are not what you want them to be. I’m married with two kids and another on the way. I got partners that have families, and we have to support them. It’s not like we have a company supporting us to help fund what we’re doing. So it was like, “Man, we gotta figure out a way that we can support ourselves and our families when the music thing is not panning out. We know we’re doing great stuff, but the results are not reflecting that.” But everything was in God’s time that we were able to work with such an amazing artist like Bruno. That helped change a lot of the trajectory of where our success has gone. AllHipHop: I’m sure you guys are getting a lot of calls now. Ray Romulus: Yeah, the calls are loose right now. [laughs] It’s a blessing. AllHipHop: Going through your catalog, I noticed you guys have worked with so many different artists. Do you have a different approach to when you’re working with a Pop artist like Justin Bieber, a rapper like Dumbfounded, or when you’re doing R&B music with Mary J. Blige? Ray Romulus: It’s definitely a different approach because we want to tap into what that artist brings to the table. So you’re coming in as the canvas. You’re literally listening and figuring out at what point in their life they’re in, what they want to talk about, and the mood of the music. It’s definitely a different approach every time.  AllHipHop: The makeup of Stereotypes is so different culturally. How does that play a role in the production? Ray Romulus: I think that’s another thing that benefits us. I’m from a Caribbean/West Indian/Haitian background. Charm is Samoan. Jeremy is German/Russian. He’s like a Viking. John is Chinese. We come from different backgrounds and different upbringings. The common denominator for us is the music. That’s what brings us together, so I think that works for our benefit. AllHipHop: How did the Kyle track with Miguel come together? Ray Romulus: We happened to be working with Miguel on a couple of other things. He was in a session with us, just coming up with ideas to write hooks. Miguel had an idea for that particular track. That just happened to be around the same time we were locking in a session with Kyle. When he came in, the first thing we said was, ""We have an amazing idea for you."" He said “load it up” and jumped in the booth. Then Miguel came back in and fine tuned it to fit exactly what it is now. AllHipHop: Now the song is being featured on ESPN. Ray Romulus: Yeah, that’s one of the main songs for the NCAA. AllHipHop: What other work do you guys have coming up? Ray Romulus: We’re really excited about this Pitbull song. It’s called “Jungle.” It’s Pitbull and The Stereotypes featuring E-40 and Abraham Mateo. We worked with Meghan Trainor on her upcoming album. We’re looking forward to developing a couple of new acts. AllHipHop: Have you thought about putting out your own album as The Stereotypes since you have this song with Pitbull? Ray Romulus: Yeah, we kind of look at this Pitbull song as a good launchpad for us to do a lot more collaborative songs and definitely focus on a Stereotypes project. AllHipHop: There’s been a lot of conversation over the last few years about producers and the way they’re credited. You even had Sonny Digital saying producers should think about having their own union. From your experiences in the industry, how have you guys managed the business end of it? Ray Romulus: I think that’s something that’s serious, especially for the songwriters. That’s why we’re definitely more involved with the Grammy Advocacy program to help with the rates we’re getting paid as songwriters from streaming, because streaming is the platform that’s the leader of music consumption right now. At the rate that it’s going right now, none of us will be able to support ourselves. That’s why we’re really fighting and coming together to help let Congress know the songwriters are important. That’s a serious thing. AllHipHop: We’re coming to the end of the year. This is around the time a lot of the year-end lists start coming out. Outside your own work, was there any other music or artists from 2017 that you found yourself listening to more? Ray Romulus: I really love one of the other nominees for Producer of the Year which was Calvin Harris. That album is amazing to me. I’ve been listening to a lot of Daniel Caesar. The new Dipset just dropped, I’m definitely on that. Oh yeah, and Bruno Mars’ 24K Magic. I’m still playing that. [laughs] AllHipHop: He has a good chance to win the big one - Album Of The Year. Ray Romulus: I definitely think he has a great chance to win that. Follow The Stereotypes on Twitter @Stereotypes and Instagram @stereotypestv.

17,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/a-conversation-with-rico-nasty-on-working-with-lil-yachty-hip-hop-s-generation-gap-sugar-trap-2-KBlYftVJfU-2KJliqaFXcA/,"Before the 20-year-old Marylander provided exclusive info about her next mixtape, the Tales of Tacobella creator discussed working with Atlanta rhymer Lil Yachty as well as the widening musical chasm between Generation X and Millennials. She also revealed the greatest accomplishment of her career so far. AllHipHop: You were on The Fate of the Furious soundtrack with Lil Yachty. Rico Nasty: That was also spur of the moment. I went to the studio and my boyfriend was like, “You got this song to do with Yachty.” I didn’t know what it was for. He just told me not to curse on it. I was like, “That’s obvious. It will probably go on the radio.” But then the tracklist for Fate of the Furious came out. I was like, “What the f-ck? This is crazy.” I kind of knew before it came out, but I wasn’t quite sure. I didn’t know if I was on the song alone. I didn’t know what they were doing with it. I saw it on Twitter and texted [Yachty] like, “Bruh, we’re on Fast & Furious.” He was happy. AllHipHop: You and Yachty have done a couple of tracks together. He did a remix to one of your songs. Rico Nasty: Yeah, “Hey Arnold,” and then “Mamacita.” That’s it. We’ve been in the studio. I was nervous as sh-t recording in front of him. He’s very smart with how he places sh-t and how he does sh-t. It looks like it comes so easy to him. That was my first time in the studio with him. I’ve hung out with him but never in the studio. I was nervous as sh-t, but it was still lit though. We still talk til this day. He’s a great person. Exactly how he is to everyone else, that’s how he is in real life. He’s nice, happy, positive, and smart as sh-t. He’s f-cking awesome. AllHipHop: I live in Atlanta so I kind of have a better understanding of Yachty. But he gets a bad rap from some of the older Hip Hop heads... Rico Nasty: Don’t we all? [laughs] AllHipHop: Well, yeah. [laughs] How do you feel about this generational gap that’s happening in the culture right now? Rico Nasty: The old n-ggas just want us to bring real rap back. [laughs] They’re sick of this sh-t. But back in the day, music was like all people had. In the 90s, yeah they had TVs and computers. But did they have social media? Did they really have new rappers popping up every day online, blowing up overnight? No. I don’t know what they expect from us. We don’t expect this sh-t. Nobody is sitting around like, “Yeah, I’m going to blow up.” The sh-t just happens. People are just out here judging somebody’s art. It’s like going to a gallery, walking around, and saying, “This is ugly.” Just because you don’t understand it. It’s childish. You’re old as sh-t, but you’re sounding young as f-ck. You sound like a little baby that’s mad because you don’t get what we’re talking about. The young kids - we speak our own language. And they’re just not aware. They didn’t live through what we live through. Everything was so fresh to them, and now we’re almost at the point where it’s like, “What else can we do?” Because everything has been done. Somebody’s always like, “You’re copying” or “You’re influenced by.” It’s not even that deep. Get the f-ck out of here. [laughs] It’s not that serious. Nobody is worried about you or your 90s album. We’re gonna play you at the parties though.  AllHipHop: I heard your dad was a rapper. Rico Nasty: My dad was a rapper. AllHipHop: Having somebody around you that’s familiar with the business, did that affect you as an artist? Rico Nasty: My dad didn’t really share any of his cheat codes with me until he knew I was serious. When I started having label meetings, that’s when he was like, “Okay, let’s see how far this can go.” He’s 100% on board. He does give his input on the music. Some sh-t he don’t like, because of what I say. The old people don’t get it. And some sh-t he does like. He says, “This is so different.” That’s usually what I go for. I don’t really go for, “I’m gonna mumble rap on this song. I'm gonna super rap on this song.” I’m just like, “Does this sound fun?” It’s just: Am I going to be able to hear this and not dance? That’s what it’s about. Am I gonna be able to hear this and stand still? That’s how I determine my music. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOTfQ4NjIKs AllHipHop: You’re coming up in an era where we’re kind of coming out of this hole in female Hip Hop. Nicki’s been out here killing it for eight years… Rico Nasty: Ten years, bro. For a decade. AllHipHop: Now we’re seeing more female Hip Hop artists starting to get attention. What are your thoughts about where the culture is now as it relates to female rappers? Rico Nasty: I feel like if you’re meant for this sh-t, then you’re meant for it. Being a female rapper right now is like getting dreads back when Wale and Waka Flocka were out. [laughs] Everybody’s doing it. Everyone’s trying it. It’s like crack in the 80s. Everyone wants to know what it’s like. [laughs] The best of the best will make it. Nicki has already made it. She’s a big inspiration to a lot of females. She’s not really my top inspiration per se, but if you’re going to sit here and say she didn’t influence this sh-t then you’re f-cking stupid. She was the only person we had. She was monopolizing the rap game. As an up-and-coming female, the big thing right now is remaining humble. You can really think you’re big sh-t and the next day you can get put in your place. So be humble, work hard, stack up, and be thankful. Because not a lot of b-tches get to see that sh-t. At the beginning of last year, I was not doing anything. I had a baby and I was working a job that I hated. And look now. Look at this. It’s f-cking crazy. I get why everyone wants to do it. I get why it’s a trend now. But y’all gonna see in like two years, maybe in a year, some of these b-tches ain’t gonna be doing anything but sucking d-ck and hosting clubs. AllHipHop: You talked about your rise on “Wanna Know.” What would you say has been the best thing or the most memorable thing about your music career so far? Rico Nasty: I think the most memorable thing about my career was stuff was picking up around my son’s first birthday, and I was able to go all out. I was able to be that mom and do everything for him. I had the whole party set up like a Winter Wonderland. I bought him a car. He had a cake with his face on it. Everybody came out. We took pictures. I put something together for him and I was able to afford it. When I had my son, I was broke as sh-t. I did not know what the f-ck I was gonna do. When I started getting shows, I was making like $700 for a show. So I was happy about that $700. I was happy I could take that $700 for a 15-minute set and go get my child everything he wanted. That’s what matters to me. That’s been the best accomplishment I’ve made thus far - just continuing to be the best mom to him. That’s what this sh-t is about. https://www.instagram.com/p/BXGSZXqH2hy/?taken-by=rico__nasty AllHipHop: I was first introduced to you through Jay IDK. He put me on to your music. Rico Nasty: That’s my n-gga! AllHipHop: I think the first song I heard with you was the one with you and WillThaRapper. It made me think about what’s happening in that region right now as far as Hip Hop. You seem to be on pace to be the first female rapper to really break out from [the DMV]. Are you ready to have that title on your back? Rico Nasty: You asking me that question got me hella emotional because I’m by myself and looking at myself. I’m like, “Damn, bro. The face of the DMV? The first female face?” That’s an honor. People out here, they don’t go for bullsh-t. You gotta be real to make it out or good at what you do. Damn, bro. I don’t even know. That sh-t is crazy. I love that. I love where I’m from. I love everybody - DC, Maryland, Virginia, Baltimore. I’ve lived all around the DMV. Everything that I’m influenced by will be on Sugar Trap 2. We got the club mixes. We got remixes of my songs that I did myself, punching on the keyboard myself, staying in the studio for 32 hours straight. I’ve been working hard as f-ck. So if they are willing to give me that title… f-ck yeah! I’m gonna carry the DMV on my back with pride. AllHipHop: When can we expect Sugar Trap 2? Rico Nasty: Sugar Trap 2 is 98% done. We got a feature from Q Da Fool. I’m famous for only doing one feature on the tape, so he is the only feature that will be on Sugar Trap 2. We got more of a “Poppin” sound and how I sounded when I first started rapping. The fans heard Tales of Tacobella, and it was good, but they wanted me to rap more. Even on the hooks. I get it. Tales of Tacobella was about my life and what I went through to get here. Sugar Trap is like “I’m that b-tch.” That’s the soundtrack. It’s “I’m that b-tch” music. It’s more of a project than I’ve ever created before. So I hope with Sugar Trap 2 I can continue to evolve. That’s what they always expect, so that’s what I'm doing on this tape. It’s completely different from anything I’ve ever done. I’m excited for you guys to hear it. Read part 1 of A Conversation With Rico Nasty HERE. Purchase Rico Nasty's music on iTunes.

18,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/a-conversation-with-stalley-on-going-indie-mental-health-more-puQTV9Kstk6HwScLjSJ9Yw/,"Songs such as “1 Deep (Solo)” cover the Blue Collar Gang leader’s departure from Maybach Music Group and Atlantic Records. “Jean Jacket” allows listeners into the emcee’s mind as he delivers rhymes as a coping mechanism to manage the unavoidable ills of the industry.  By teaming with Atlanta's rap superstars Migos for “My Line,” Stalley lets the world know his smartphone is for closing lucrative deals not engaging in casual convos. Young Scooter - another ATL resident - shows up on the EP’s closer “Green Eyed,” a cut about jealous ones unintentionally displaying envy. With 2017 also seeing the arrival of the New Wave and Another Level projects, Stalley is planning to continue his impressive musical output in the new year. The product of Massillon, Ohio will be back with two more volumes of Tell The Truth. Find out what Mr. Myricks has to say in this Q&A about his most recent release, the importance of paying attention to mental health, and progressing as an artist.  AllHipHop: You dropped a lot of music over the last year. What led to you being so productive?  Stalley: Just having time to myself to put together bodies of work, record as much as I wanted to, and just bury myself in the work. I was in a situation where I was basically working out of another situation. So I thought I’d just take that time to be as productive as possible. AllHipHop: How has releasing music as an indie artist been different from doing so with a major label? Stalley: It’s a breeze being able to have that freedom to create when I want to create and how I want to create, to put the music out at the pace that I want to put it out, and not have to answer to anyone or have people question me about what I’m doing.  AllHipHop: So outside of the business side of it, you felt like you had more creative freedom this time? Stalley: Yeah, 100%. I had way more creative freedom all across the board - visually, artwork, everything. AllHipHop: You kind of mentioned your situation with MMG on the project. Was that split amicable when you decided to leave? Stalley: Yeah, it was kind of agreed to on both sides. It wasn’t no issues. It was a natural progression just like growth. You know how you grow apart from somebody? It’s kind of like being in a relationship. Sometimes it just don’t work out and you grow apart from each other.  AllHipHop: On “1 Deep” you made a reference to Atlantic. I recently watched an episode of Everyday Struggle when K. Michelle was on there. She talked about how she felt like Atlantic seemed to be focusing more on Internet celebrities like the “Cash Me Outside” girl. Did you see a shift happening while you were there? Stalley: You definitely see them focusing on weird things or things that are just trendy. You just see it’s not focused on the music and the creative part of being an artist. It just becomes about everything else. I can definitely see how they’re going more towards the popularity of “social media darlings” or people that are popular on social media. I tell people all the time that once you get over a certain amount of followers on social media you can be whoever you want to be. You can be a rapper, you can sell clothes, you can be a therapist.  AllHipHop: I noticed you’re active on Twitter but not as active on Instagram. Is there a particular reason why? Stalley: I had a lot of pictures [on Instagram]. I just started over with a clean slate - new music, new Stalley, new everything. It’s a new situation.  AllHipHop: Going back to the music, it seems like “Jean Jacket” is one of the fan favorites off the project. That song includes lyrics about how some fans don’t really understand the politics of the game. How do you personally balance dealing with the negativity that comes with being in the business and maintaining the creativity needed to be an artist? Stalley: Well, I don’t deal with it no more. [laughs] Thank God. With “Jean Jacket,” that was definitely a song that was personal. At the time, I was going through a lot, and I just wanted to let the fans know they don’t understand the politics or what we go through. As consumers, they just want the product. Sometimes they don’t care to get into what the artist might be going through. Sometimes I just want to sit back and chill, take care of my kids, and relax for a second. But they don’t want to hear that. They just want the music. Or they don’t understand how a label could be holding you back in any type of way. They might be the ones that's not allowing you to put out the music at the pace that you want. Sometimes it falls on you because they don’t see what’s behind the scenes.  AllHipHop: People in the industry kind of have a sense of what the creatives have to deal with. Obviously, I’m not an artist so I don’t completely understand your lifestyle, but after having conversations with people, I feel like I have a better understanding than a general person. From my experiences, I often wonder if we, as a culture - meaning the artists, journalists, executives - pay enough attention to mental health issues. I noticed you sent out a tweet about how important mental health is. Can you expound on that thought? Stalley: I actually make that a priority now, to put myself first. I actually focus very much on my mental health and my physical health. Sometimes that’s the first thing to go before your mental health - letting your body go, gaining or losing weight. That’s when the depression starts setting in and you see yourself transforming mentally and physically. But I feel refreshed and great now. I feel like a new person. And I don’t think that the execs, artists, and others pay too much attention to it. I feel like we’re in a culture where we are always told to “man up” and get over something. I hate that. A lot of times we don’t even know who to turn to or how to get this help. Sometimes when we go to a big brother, a cousin, a parent, or a friend, they’ll be like, “Get over it. You’ll be alright. Toughen up.” It’s like, “Nah, I’m really crying out for some help.” It’s tough on us as a culture. Some people might listen to “Jean Jacket” and be like, “Man, that n-gga got some ill bars.” I was going crazy [lyrically] and it was coming from the heart. But at the same time, some of that stuff at the time was me calling out for help. I’m glad I put those feelings out, and hopefully those feelings can help someone else. AllHipHop: Was that therapeutic in a way? Stalley: Definitely. I was in my homie’s studio. He got a studio in his basement, and it gets a little cold down there. He has a makeshift booth built out of plywood. I’m down there and I got my jean jacket on. I don’t write no more. I just go into the booth, put on a beat, and just kind of freestyle my thoughts out. As I’m in the booth, I’m looking at this jean jacket I got on. That’s how the song came about. I was in the booth with this jean jacket and the sh-t is feeling like a straitjacket. Everything started spilling out just naturally. I just got so much off my chest.  AllHipHop: It almost seemed like you had a different voice on this album, not necessarily a voice as in the way you sound. It’s more like your whole approach [was different]. Stalley: Part of it comes from the freedom I had to have that carefree spirit, not worrying about anybody, knowing that when I put this music together there wasn’t going to be no one there to listen and pick it apart or hint that it’s not radio-ready. Also that freedom of not writing anymore, just going in the booth and getting my thoughts out, no pen to pad, just being free. AllHipHop: I noticed there are only Atlanta acts featured on the project. Was that on purpose? Stalley: Yeah, definitely. Again, it’s a transition, it’s part of the growth. A lot of people might not know, but for the past seventeen years, I lived in Brooklyn, New York. That’s like really home for me, even though I rep Ohio to the death. Ohio is home too. So moving down to Atlanta in the past year and a half was the first time I’ve lived somewhere different over the past seventeen years. So it was just about connecting with different producers and artists. It felt like home as soon as I got here. Everybody was welcoming. Migos, Young Scooter - everybody here wants to work and got the same goals in mind as I do, and that’s just to be great and put out dope music.  AllHipHop: I read that Tell The Truth: Shame The Devil is part of a series. When can we expect the next edition? Stalley: Very soon. Top of the new year. Yeah, you can expect Vol 2 and Vol 3 very soon. But I got a lot of visuals coming out from Vol 1. AllHipHop: I did an interview with you in 2016. At the time, you said you felt like Saving Yusef was your best project up until that point. What does Tell The Truth: Shame The Devil represent for you at this point in your career? Stalley: It’s a benchmark. It’s my championship. It’s a graduation period. Back then, I was still learning and trying to figure things out. Like the title goes, I was trying to save myself. But now I feel like I’ve graduated and stepped into independence. These next three projects are definitely, hands down, my best work. I know I said that about Saving Yusef, but this trilogy of Tell the Truth: Shame The Devil is definitely my best work to date. AllHipHop: I think that’s how it’s supposed to be. With every album, you’re supposed to grow. Stalley: That’s what it is. It’s natural progression and growth. As long as I can outdo myself and keep pushing myself to be better - and I feel like I’m getting there - then I’m satisfied. Stream Stalley’s music on Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal, and SoundCloud.

19,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/a-conversation-with-teecee4800-on-his-new-project-picking-up-the-baton-for-west-coast-rap-more-2DjpDKEh20u5kU9BtRH9Zg/,"TeeCee incorporated the traditional sounds of Cali rap with contemporary vibes on his latest project Realness Over Millions 2. That vintage-modern approach presents a 16-song collection that is easily digestible to Los Angelenos as well as listeners beyond the Mojave Desert.  The sequel to his 2016 mixtape features established West Coasters E-40, Ty Dolla, YG, and Staples. East Coast representatives Wiz Khalifa and Ransom show up as well. Of course, the one-time resident of Mid-City also recruited his MVMNT brethren 24hrs and D.Loc for contributions. TeeCee closes out ROM2 with a song featuring his currently incarcerated cousin Big TC. I spoke with TeeCee4800 about his new project. The interview also includes him discussing his early days with YG and Ty Dolla $ign , starting as a DIY artist, celebrities claiming gang affiliation, and being part of the Priority Records legacy. AllHipHop: What does this project represent for you? TeeCee4800: Just letting the world know that I’m still doing this sh-t and also reaching fans that I haven’t reached yet. I’m just trying to get bigger. I’m just trying to get my foot in the door. That’s what this project represents. AllHipHop: Since you’ve dropped the project, do you feel like you've reached a different audience? TeeCee4800: I do, actually. I feel like I’ve reached people that I haven’t reached before.  AllHipHop: Why did you decide to come back with a sequel now? TeeCee4800: When I did the first one, it was already in my head that I was going to do a sequel to it. It was already on the agenda. AllHipHop: So were these all new tracks? TeeCee4800: There all new tracks over a period of like ten months to a year. AllHipHop: You have quite a few features on there. In particular, you do a lot of work with YG. How did you build that relationship? TeeCee 4800: “Toot It and Boot It” was the first time I met YG. After that, we linked up and never looked back.  AllHipHop: You were on the original version of “Toot It and Boot It”? TeeCee4800: Correct. It was actually just me and Ty’s song at first. I didn’t know YG. I went to Ty’s house, and we did the song. I wasn’t a rapper at the time. I just went over there to record the song with him. The next day he had YG on [the song]. I was like, “Who is that?” He was like, “YG.” I was like, “Damn, that sh-t’s hard.” Then I met YG when we did the video. I guess Def Jam wanted it for YG’s solo project, so that’s when they took me off and did another verse. AllHipHop: You said that you weren’t rapping at the time. At what point did you decide you wanted to be a rapper for your career? TeeCee4800: It was after “Toot It and Boot It” took off. A lot of people in LA were singing it and knew me from being on the original version. I just took advantage of the opportunity that I had in the music business because I did what a lot of people wanted to do and they’d been rapping for years. I did it in a week, so I just took advantage of it. I bought my own music equipment and taught myself how to record myself. AllHipHop: We’re kind of in this “Do It Yourself” era, particularly in entertainment. But with you being Ty Dolla $ign’s cousin, I’m sure the idea of nepotism comes up, like, “He only got on because he’s connected to Ty.” How has that affected you as you move through the industry? TeeCee4800: Of course, Ty helped me in a lot of ways. But at the same time, “Toot It and Boot It” was all of our first hit single - me, Ty, and YG. Him and YG blew up. I’m still a West Coast legend, and I’m just trying to get worldwide. So we all did it ourselves. Ty is my cousin and he helped me in a lot of ways, so did YG, but I still did it myself. AllHipHop: You have a lot of West Coast artists on [*Realness Over Millions 2*]. You have Vince [Staples] on the “Crippin” song. We’ve seen celebrities that didn’t grow up in that culture claim they’re affiliated with certain gangs. How do you feel about people that got famous and then decided they wanted to claim Blood or Crip?** TeeCee4800: It’s crazy that everybody be claiming, especially a lot of out-of-towners. That’s one of the reasons I did the “Crippin” song. I knew everybody would like it because it’s authentic and from a real person’s perspective. Everybody just wants to do it and they're getting away with it. That’s what makes it really bad. AllHipHop: You have your other cousin Big TC on “This Ain’t Love.” How difficult was it to get him to record for that song?  TeeCee4800: He actually sent that song to me. So it wasn’t difficult at all? He sent me the song. It was incredible. It was produced by D’Mile. Big TC is incredible. He gets all types of good beats in prison. It’s crazy. He gets better beats than me a lot of  the time. AllHipHop: I’m sure he has to be proud watching you guys and the success you’ve reached. TeeCee4800: Yeah. He’ll be home soon. He’s gonna be right here, proud with us. AllHipHop: On “Roaches,” there’s a bar where you’re talking about XXL**. Every year the Freshman list sparks controversy about who was selected and who was snubbed. Is making that cover something you’d like to achieve?** TeeCee4800: I would love to make the XXL Freshman cover. That bar was, “No XXL. F-ck it. My n-ggas got the mags."" It wasn’t nothing towards the [magazine]. But they do gotta start paying attention to these real artists out here. That’s all. AllHipHop: You’re a lyricist. But we’re living in an era now where lyricism has taken a backseat. It’s more about the beat or the vibe.  TeeCee4800: There’s nothing wrong with that. The Lil Uzi Verts and Lil Pumps are cool. That’s the young guys. I like all that music. I don’t bang all of it, but I bang certain songs. I don’t feel no way about that. But you’re right, the lyrical rappers are not getting as much recognition. But we’re still gonna have our fans. Everybody’s gonna get this money.  AllHipHop: Your album does present different generations. You have a certified legend in E-40, and then you have people like 24hrs. Was it important for you to have that mixture of old school and new school? TeeCee4800: Yes it was. Especially, the old school that’s still relevant. I feel like 40’s always gonna be in the game. I definitely wanted to get 24hrs on there because we’re part of this movement. He’s another new cat that’s blowing up. So it was definitely good having the old and new schools. AllHipHop: You’re obviously close to Ty, but also with Wiz. Are you officially affiliated with Taylor Gang? TeeCee4800: Nah, they're just the homies. Shout out to the Gang. AllHipHop: Realness Over Millions 2 was released through Priority Records. That company has a long, storied history with West Coast Hip Hop. Do you see yourself as the latest extension of that legacy which includes N.W.A, Ice Cube, Ice-T, Eazy-E, and Snoop Dogg? TeeCee4800: Of course. I’m about to be up there with all of them.  AllHipHop: So where do you see yourself in five years? TeeCee4800: Every year, I’m moving up. So in five years, I’ll be moved up five times, five levels. I see myself in movies. I’m trying to do a spinoff of Blame It On The Streets. Yeah, more mixtapes, more content, and more money. https://www.instagram.com/p/Ba18hzln3vi/?hl=en&taken-by=tcdaloc_mtm Stream TeeCee4800's music on Apple Music, Spotify, Tidal, and SoundCloud.

That changed in October when The Boy Illinois returned with a 9-track audio dedication to his hometown. Windy features fellow Chitown representatives Rico Recklezz, YP, Saba, Frsh Waters, and others. Sections of the mixtape once again showcased Illi’s admiration for the iconic emcees that laid the groundwork for him to build his brand of Hip Hop. Last week, The Boy Illinois and I connected on the phone to discuss his latest project. Other topics like paying tribute to OutKast and Tupac Shakur as well as the problematic personal life of R. Kelly were part of the conversation too. AllHipHop: What led to the two year break between the last project and Windy? The Boy Illinois: A majority of that was because I was on tour with Lupe for like a year and a half, so we weren’t able to sit for two or three months to do a project. It was like we were on the road for three months, off another month, then we’re back. So I was dropping songs, but I couldn’t put a project together. I like to sit with it for a second. After the tour, it was like, “Alright, we’re going straight to the studio 24/7."" We got like three other projects besides Windy finished. AllHipHop: So you have more projects on the way? The Boy Illinois: Yeah. The original project that was supposed to come out under Priority as my EP was Road Winds. But I had a conversation with my manager and Malik Yusef, and they told me I needed to put a mixtape out. I had all this material that I was sitting on. It was like literally a must that we made Windy. It was just me linking up with all my people from Chicago. It’s pretty much all Chicago producers and features. My publicist named the project when we took it to her to listen to the songs. She was like, “This is just Chicago, so you gotta call it Windy.”  AllHipHop: You mentioned Priority. Can you explain your relationship with them? The Boy Illinois: They’re a very good middleman. We have a great relationship with the people there. I think Trackster is at Priority. He’s from Chicago, so we got some fam up there. No I.D, he’s from Chicago. That’s Capitol which is like the same thing. They’re the third party, strictly distribution. So whenever we got some sh-t and we feel like we need a bigger platform to release it on, instead of doing it ourselves, we can pitch it to them and see where we go from there. That door is open now off of the “Dancing Like Diddy” joint. So we’re gonna use it to our advantage and hopefully we’re both gonna gain something good out of it. AllHipHop: Do you know if Diddy saw that video? The Boy Illinois: I have no clue. Everybody is like, “Yeah, he’s seen it by now.” My big homie Twista was like, “He sees everything, so he’s probably seen it by now.” I was like, “I don’t think he’s seen it.” Twista said, “Nah, I’m pretty sure he’s seen it.” Somebody else in the industry told me, “Yeah, he probably saw it already.” It would be dope. Even if I don’t know nothing about it, as long as he’s seen it, that’s cool with me. AllHipHop: When I saw the cover art for Windy, I instantly recognized you were paying homage to OutKast. Why did you draw inspiration from Aquemini?  The Boy Illinois: I get a lot of people saying I look like André 3000 because of my hair and the way I dress. That’s one aspect of it. On the spiritual aspect of it, we had just come into the Age of Aquarius and you have Aquemini the album. So it was paying homage to one of my favorite groups, and at the same time, being it corresponds with the universe, I wanted to do that. And [OutKast] had the women [on the album cover], and women represent a powerful aspect of the forces of nature. The woman at the top is Oya. In the Yoruba religion, she is like the storm that comes through and destroys thing so that you can build anew. The woman at the bottom is her mother Yemaya which is the ruler of the waters. So the spiritual aspect and Hip Hop, mash it together and you got Windy. AllHipHop: Besides the OutKast connection, when you listen to the project you hear that you make a lot of references to legendary artists, like with the 2Pac soundbite on “Salute.” There’s been a lot of conversation in the culture lately about the “generational gap.” Why is it so important for you to show love to the emcees that came before you? The Boy Illinois: I was raised by good OGs. No matter what they were into in the streets, they knew what they were doing was ultimately going to lead to some sort of demise. I got a lot of the ""you’re a hooper” or “you rap, you need to move from this area.” So being raised on that and being around older cats, this was the music I grew up on. I hung around older folks, me and my homie Rel who’s one of my producers. Hanging around older folks all the time, you pick up certain traits and values. Not only that, you pick up the music they listen to. Because of the lack of education being passed down on a cultural basis, you want to reinforce it without having to preach it. That’s kind of one of the ways I do it. AllHipHop: You recently dropped a video for “Didn't I.” Are you planning to create more visuals from tracks off Windy? The Boy Illinois: We’re probably gonna do seven of the nine videos. We finished “90/94 Freestyle"" with my brother YP. We’re getting ready to shoot ""Cool"" with Saba and Frsh Waters. After that, we’re gonna be running with Rico Recklezz. Then at the end of the year, I’m probably gonna shoot “Run Around.” So we’ll probably have four more videos coming out before the end of this month. AllHipHop: Before the end of the month? The Boy Illinois: Yeah, well, probably two of them. I know my folks are gonna be like, “Nope. We’re not gonna release all of them.” [laughs] But we’re shooting all of them within the next two weeks. So who knows? AllHipHop: You stay on it. The Boy Illinois: Yeah, it’s no games. I’m at a point now where I haven’t been in this position before, so I gotta keep showing and proving. It’s work, work, work. AllHipHop: What was the thought process behind the “Othello” track posted to SoundCloud? The Boy Illinois: That’s a great question. I really just posted that to post it. I had been sitting on that for a minute, and I was like, “I’m not even gonna tell nobody I released it, so whoever follows me on SoundCloud are gonna be able to hear it."" It was just something I did in the studio. I have tons of songs. Free Chill. I record out of 1st & 15th Studios. Since the top of the year I’ve just been recording. So I just put it out there to put it out there. People will probably stumble across it later. AllHipHop: I noticed a tweet that you posted where you tweeted about R. Kelly still having this large support, even after all these years of abuse and sexual misconduct allegations. There’s been a lot of news recently about these famous men, and in some cases women, facing accusations. Why do you think R. Kelly still has this large, supportive fan base despite all these allegations? The Boy Illinois: As I said, we as people, men and women, and especially melanated, black, or whatever you refer to yourself as - we have a syndrome and condition that we keep going back to the people that don’t like us and the people who abuse us for some reason.  AllHipHop: Like Stockholm syndrome?  The Boy Illinois: Yes. If you look at R. Kelly’s victims, they’re young black women. Then you go to his fan base, and his fan base is older black women. There aren't dudes like, “I’m finna go to this R. Kelly concert.” I’ve never heard that before. If a dude goes, he’s going with his girl or because a lot of women are gonna be there. So predominately, the people that support him are the people that he’s abusing. The same goes to the retail game with things men and women buy, knowing that these people don’t like us, we still support them. That’s a big part of it. And when the fashion or the music is so good, it’s hard to detach yourself from it.  AllHipHop: On a lighter note, I asked this question last year, so I wanted to check back in with you. How many pairs of loafers do you own now?  The Boy Illinois: Oh man, I have more gym shoes now. But I feel like I’m at like five pair of loafers. I live with my girl now, so my closet is pretty small now compared to hers.  Stream The Boy Illinois’ music on Apple Music, Spotify, Tidal, and SoundCloud.

21,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/a-conversation-with-translee-on-hustle-gang-new-projects-rapping-about-political-issues-more-NPSDfnjeFkODerKJG0XmEA/,"One of those apprentices working to elevate himself to Top 40 status is Alabama’s Translee. The emcee derives directly from the lineage of other southern wordsmiths such as OutKast, Goodie Mob, UGK, J. Cole, Big K.R.I.T., and of course his Hustle Gang boss Tip. But at the same time, Translee’s tunes embody elements of musicality that originated outside the South. Along with his Digital Nativ3 Culture colleagues Chris Hunter, Todd Marshall, Tha Officialz, Darius Jackson, and Jervon Morgan, the Huntsville-raised front man made moves to grab the attention of rap followers. Translee’s appearances on We Want Smoke (and Hustle Gang’s 2016 mixtape H.G.O.E.) came after his own Culture Junky and M.A.O.T.P., Pt. 1 projects circulated online. A few days after he finished shooting the video for “Humble/TTY” in his hometown, I chatted with Translee about his buzzing career. We also discussed Hip Hop culture, politics, and more in the latest installment of the Conversations series. AllHipHop: You seem to be a student of Hip Hop. You make references to lines from legends like André 3000, Jay-Z, and 2Pac. When did you first start studying rap music? Translee: I first started really studying rap around the T.I./Kanye days. Those were the two people I was most influenced by. Kanye for his content, and Tip because we had similar stature. It was easy to idolize these guys. I ultimately started rapping because my momma died, but then I found these artists I could look up to, that I felt like I could relate to. After studying them and the OutKasts of the world - when I say study I mean listening to them a lot - those guys really helped me to craft my talent, my skills, and where I wanted to take it. So I definitely gotta give them big props. AllHipHop: It’s interesting that Tip was one of the people that influenced you and now you’re working directly with him. At the time, could you have imagined you’d be on tour and doing an album with him? Translee: I never would have imagined. I’m from Alabama. These people are like unicorns to us. Me and my team always had a grind, so we knew that we could get somewhere. It was a “shoot for the sky and if you miss, land in the stars” type of thing. We were blessed for him to even hear the music. I don’t even think it was a difficult thing for him to want to work with me. When he heard the music he was pretty much on board with what we wanted to do. It was a blessing to work with a legend. AllHipHop: One of the things I like about Hustle Gang is that there are so many [musical] styles as part of that collective. What is that creative process like when you’re trying to manage all these different artists on a compilation project? Translee: It’s shockingly easy. You would think with all these different personalities, artists would have egos. But I think everybody realizes ain’t none of us “made it” except for Tip, Dro, Trae tha Truth, and B.o.B. We look at each other like we haven’t made it to where we want to go. So we look up to our OGs and come together. Egos be out the room so we can make the best record. I’m really proud of this project, and I’m excited to put out We Want Smoke 2. AllHipHop: Speaking of sequels, do you have an idea when you’re going to release part two of your project? Translee: That is very, very, very top secret. I’m actually working on [M.A.O.T.P., Pt. 2] now. I will probably wrap that up in the next month or so. I just moved, so my life is changing now. Shout out to Grand Hustle. They got me a nice crib in Atlanta. We’re trying to get the studio up and going. I already have a lot of songs done, but we gotta spend a few weeks putting it together. I’m also working on my next album after Pt. 2. Freedom Summer is gonna be the album I drop after that. You’ll get Pt. 2 by the top of next year, if not this year. AllHipHop: There’s a line on “Humble/TTY” where you say women sometimes refer to you as the male version of Erykah Badu. On your Instagram page, you have pictures of Erykah, Lauryn Hill, and Solange. Do you draw a lot of inspiration from R&B/Soul singers? Translee: Not necessarily lyrically, but their calmness.There’s a certain calmness about their music and they’re very vivid in their lyrics. André 3000 is the same way. They can say the most with the least. Like when Erykah Badu sings, “It ain’t like he ain’t got education. I was right there at his graduation.” When she says stuff like that it just hits you. They can say a lot with a few words, and that’s what I’m trying to master. Lauryn Hill is one of my favorite artists ever. Even though she put that one album out, it’s still one of the greatest rapping-singing albums I’ve ever heard. I definitely take a lot of inspiration from them because they’re so unapologetically themselves. AllHipHop: You use melody in your music. Do you consider yourself to be a singer? Translee: Nah, I’m definitely not a singer. I can hold a tune. I’m also a fan of saying, “Hey, I’m going to lay this down, but I’m going to have a background vocalist back me up a little bit.” That always sounds better. I’ve mastered doing my own uplifting, but it helps when you have more people that can bring it all together. That’s what we’re working on now, bringing in background vocalists and adding extra layers and textures to the records. That’s what makes it special. AllHipHop: I can hear you mastering being a lyrical rapper who’s giving you content and then having your hooks be radio-ready. There aren't too many artists in the space now that can have that mainstream/Pop appeal and still keep it lyrical. Translee: Me and my manager always say we gotta make something that makes people want to bob their heads to the beat and nod their heads in agreement. That’s our goal, that’s our mission statement. So if that’s how you feel then that’s exactly what we’re going for. AllHipHop: You also seem to be outspoken about politics and social issues. Do you think Hip Hop has a role to play in social change? Translee: Everything. We have the youth’s attention more than Barack Obama or anybody ever would. He definitely had people’s attention, but Drake could get out here and say something and it mean a lot more to young people. Or Cardi B could say something to make more people vote than Barack probably could right now. Hip Hop has major influence. I’m proud of Hip Hop for stepping up because that’s not even necessarily what most of us get into it for. For me, it was a release from my momma dying and I just got really good at it. Today, we’re forced to be models, actors, politicians. You might have just got into it for rapping, but you gotta be all of that. Now, even more than ever, it requires us to be in that political space because it’s a lot of bullsh-t going on that we gotta speak on. We would be fools not to. Whenever historians look up this sh-t in 100 years from now, we don’t want them to think it was just Molly and Percocet. We want them to know the sh-t that was going on, and we can tell them what’s going on through the music. AllHipHop: I was watching your Sway interview and noticed you talked about the “money phone” trend. That was back in April. Then Jay-Z rapped about it on 4:44 which started a conversation in the culture. What was your reaction when you heard that line on his album? Translee: I was in agreeance. Some people had something to say about it because some people like living in a world where it’s “I don’t give a f-ck. I’m gonna get this money.” At the end of the day, for all of us to come up as a culture, definitely as a black culture, we all have to be on the same page. That’s the hardest thing in the world to do, because we’re so discombobulated. We’re separated - light skin/dark skin, iPhone/Android. We’re so separated it’s hard to even get on the same page. It killed me when Jay did that. That was such a good thing for black people. Then you got the Futures of the world - which I don’t got no problem with, Future’s the homie, we’re cool - but they had their rebuttal and it kind of gives the “ignorant” people a team to be on too. We gotta just push the culture forward and up that level. Other races are focused on the betterment of their race. We’re one of the only cultures that don’t do that. So if I can be a beacon of light to anybody or if I can put out a song that inspires someone... We have a real purpose out here to better the culture. AllHipHop: So you embrace that responsibility? Some artists don’t. Translee: I fully embrace it. If I gotta get into politics 15 years from now, then that is what it is. I must stand on something my damn self. But for right now, I’m speaking through my music. I just want to leave something that puts some meat on your bones when you listen to it.

22,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/a-conversation-with-zoey-dollaz-on-his-new-music-working-with-future-florida-hip-hop-more-Z9l-NkseZEyJ81F6o1C8wA/,"The Miami-raised rapper of Haitian descent is preparing to drop the sequel to 2015’s Who Don't Like Dollaz. Zoey already freed “Move Like The Mob,” his WDLD2 collaboration with Young Thug and Lil Durk. Dollaz is also pulling off double duty by sustaining his promotion of M’ap Boule. He recently released the video for “Post & Delete” featuring Chris Brown. The clip has collected nearly a million views in its first week on YouTube. I caught up with the Freebandz/Epic artist on the phone to talk about his latest records. We also chatted about his connection with Future, his thoughts on Joe Budden, and the rise of South Florida Hip Hop. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-V3vMulJA&feature=youtu.be AllHipHop: Can you explain the project’s title - M’ap Boule? Zoey Dollaz: I picked that title because it’s part of my first language. Also, the title means “I’m on fire.” AllHipHop: Since you’re Haitian, I’m assuming that’s French. Zoey Dollaz: That’s Creole-French. AllHipHop: On quite a few of the tracks you use a melodic delivery. Why did you decide to take that approach on this particular project? Zoey Dollaz: I wanted to try something different with the melodies. People know me for doing the hardcore raps and freestyles, so I wanted to take a different approach on my album and give them something they’re not used to. AllHipHop: Are you going to go with that style on future projects? Is that a sound you find yourself enjoying? Zoey Dollaz: I’m gonna do it probably on a few more. My next project is Who Don’t Like Dollaz 2. It’s gonna be all raps, aggressive, and street. AllHipHop: When can we expect that? Zoey Dollaz: I’m gonna drop it in like mid-October. AllHipHop: Have you worked with any artists or producers for that project? Zoey Dollaz: So far, I’ve only worked with Thug and Durk. AllHipHop: When artists tend to do sequels to a project, the expectation level is a bit higher. Are you worried that people are going to hold you to a higher standard because you’re making this a sequel? Zoey Dollaz: It’s definitely gonna be on fire. That’s mandatory. I can’t even play around like that. AllHipHop: With you being on Freebandz, how involved is Future in your creative process? Zoey Dollaz: Super involved. He’s one of the people that gives me my titles, the name of my tapes. He’ll be like, “You should name it that.” Then I’m like, “Oh crap. Alright, let’s get it.” AllHipHop: Freebandz is a subsidiary of Epic which has been going through some executive turnover at the top of the label. Has that affected you at all? Zoey Dollaz: It definitely don’t. It works itself out. AllHipHop: Earlier this year, you did a freestyle where you called out Joe Budden over his comments he made about [former Epic Records CEO] L.A. Reid. Have you had the chance to talk to him and settle that situation? Zoey Dollaz: Nah, f-ck Joe Budden. AllHipHop: BET Hip-Hop Awards weekend is in Miami. Has BET approached you about participating in the cypher, being a presenter, or performing? Zoey Dollaz: Most definitely. You know I gotta kill the cypher. That’s mandatory. AllHipHop: You’ve been releasing more songs like a new freestyle and the song with Thug and Durk, but none of those songs appeared on M’ap Boule. Are those tracks precursors going into your next project? Zoey Dollaz: Yeah, those will definitely be part of Who Don’t Like Dollaz 2. AllHipHop: Speaking of that “Roll In Peace (Freestyle),” that was a song by Kodak Black and XXXtentacion. As a Miami native, what are your thoughts about how Kodak, XXX, Lil Pump, Ski Mask, and other guys from Florida have dominated SoundCloud? Zoey Dollaz: It’s their time. They gotta shine. We’ve been in a hole for a little minute. XXX is definitely empowering all of his opportunities. Lil Pump is from Miami, so I’m standing behind him 100 percent. Kodak do his thing. Ski Mask The Slum God is just a super humble individual, so I rock with him. AllHipHop: A couple of years ago, I did an interview with Denzel Curry, and he talked about how he kind of felt like the old heads in the Miami region weren’t really supporting his movement. Do you feel like it’s different now, where some of the people who are established in the city are taking these younger guys and helping to push them? Zoey Dollaz: I fully agree with Denzel Curry. That’s my brother. AllHipHop: So you feel like people in the city could be doing a little more? Zoey Dollaz: Definitely. AllHipHop: One of the things you hear about Atlanta is that they all work together which is why the city has been running Hip Hop for the past 15 years or so. But it seems like Miami is on the cusp, like you guys are the next ones up to have a really strong run in the culture. Right now the city is kind of dominating the internet, but what do you think it’s going to take for Miami Hip Hop to break into the mainstream? Zoey Dollaz: Atlanta, for sure, is super strong together. Them boys is like, “We’re all together. We’re gonna get this money together. We’re gonna put each other on.” I feel like South Florida is coming like that little by little. It’s a great move, and I feel like everything great is yet to come for us.

26,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/ahh-alternatives-3-questions-with-glenn-lewis-EmtPdEEEZkmHrTWeP0MiYg/," On his new album, Moment of Truth, Lewis returns to his musical roots with an album that is very Caribbean flavored. Lewis’s latest album features productions from Grammy Award winning pair Dre & Vidal, DJ Camper, Carvin Haggins and Ivan Barias, and upcoming producers Matrax. He also has a duet with Roc Nation vocalist, and “hometown heroine” Melanie Fiona. After a hiatus from the spotlight of the music industry Glenn recognized, with his latest work, that his primary audience were women, and credits his focus for the album to having fun with his listeners, and making hits the ladies can vibe to. AllHipHop.com: Can you talk a little about the music scene in Toronto? Glenn Lewis: Toronto is really aesthetically a cross between Chicago, aspiring to be bustling like New York, and culturally like London. There has always been great talent here; it takes a while for the music to break out from just the Toronto scene; Artists like myself, Deborah Cox, and Tamia, brought attention to Toronto. Toronto has a cool night life, just like New York. There is the Caribana Festival, where everyone comes out to in summer, and it brought another level of attention. There are a lot of interesting aspects, from the people to the culture. AllHipHop.com: After you released World Outside My Window in 2002, you went on a hiatus for several years, what made you want to come back and record your new album? Glenn Lewis: I’d always been working on music the entire time. I’ve been in different situations and different deals. I had completed a number of projects in that time but for one reason or another — timing wise or just different things had caused those projects to not come out. I guess the stars aligned so to speak with the Ruff House/Capitol situation and I did the deal in 2011. AllHipHop.com: Tell us about your new album Moment of Truth and how it's different from your previous work? Glenn Lewis: Basically, the mindset going in was that I didn’t have to show growth or evolution as an artist. I believe that just with the time that has passed; I just felt that it was something that would come across regardless in the content and the approach on the record. I felt like my first album was more introspective, therapeutic and a collection of experiences that led up to that moment. That album was like 25 years in the making. My current effort is not a complete departure from the introspective scope. In Moment of Truth I seek to bridge the era of the music that I come out of, to the R&B music of today. Moment of Truth is available now on iTunes.

27,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/ahh-review-talib-kweli-gravitas-YA6fy7sv5UubUzB_9zr0hA/," Getting the album off to a serious, hard-hitting start is ""Demonology"" produced by Lord Quest . Guitar riffs and hard bass drum hits. Make sure your sub is connected to hear those hard drum bass hits. Talib goes in like usual “No wonder I’m losing blood, everybody taking a cut, speaking in tongues, quit depicting your funds.”  I played ""Violators"" which features the legendary Raekwon five times over before finishing the rest of the album. The ill ILL combination is like a sailboat flowing effortlessly over the waves. The beat gets you stuck in the moment like a war call. Listen closely, the flow is quick. Talib, “This cat, y’all call a rapper is weak, my honor matter more, you? The shot to your Kenny I mean the latter more”, Rae “Blessed with the belts, flying in the stealth, Jewelry on neck, diamond on the cheals...”  ""Art Imitates Life"" features Black Thought and Rah Digga and is produced by Oh No. This single was out earlier in the year and still is a banger with ill rhymes. Oct 3rd brothers Talib and B. Thought show why they are some of the best in this young or old. The beat gets me nodding quick off the bat, with that champagne glass ring. Thought comes in with the sick thoughts as always “I’m out of Philly where the ecstasy and syrup is, and we don’t need Theraflu, we need therapists”. Then Talib to match, “That’s when I’m letting the Brooklyn out when they pull it out, Better let it off cause you set it off.”  This album is a must for any collection. Talib is a lyrical master who has paid his dues three times over. This is another classic delivered by a man who has held his own since he came out.

Throughout history women, in particular, minority women have always been the backbone—the support and the drivers of love, strength, and change in the world. It has finally come to a point where the recognition of how exceptional women are, is not only encouraged, but it is expected and demanded. The world’s largest and oldest digital source for Hip-Hop and Urban Culture, AllHipHop.com has taken the initiative to kick off Women’s History Month with the #AHHPowerfulWomen Campaign to honor powerful women on the scene and behind the scene. These women inspire and serve as trailblazing executives, lawyers, publicists, and influencers impacting the urban music and hip-hop industry. During the month, we will highlight different women daily on the AllHipHop.com site. Before we begin honoring these women, take a moment to think about what makes someone powerful. This isn’t only a measure of physical strength, or who is the loudest or has the highest executive position. Those are only fractions in the total measure of power. Being powerful is to be inspiring, to establish a reputation as a confident and knowledgeable expert with the experience to guide others. Developing and executing a plan, while understanding when to say “no.” A powerful person respects their own power and has the ability to find and accentuate the pieces of power and inspiration in others around them. That is POWER, and that is what makes each and every woman so powerful! Join us to not only honor the successes these women have attained but to also celebrate their fearlessness as women, mothers, wives, sisters, daughters, and professionals! Happy Women’s History Month! ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912203755.18/warc/CC-MAIN-20190325051359-20190325073359-00130.warc.gz
29,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/ahhpowerfulwomen-biba-adams-takes-detroit-rap-gives-it-to-the-world-NxL1O2SlRE2osMAE9YP1sw/,"Biba also worked for seven years at Year Up, Inc-a national workforce development program for young adults where she taught and mentored hundreds of students. Her passion for hip-hop is only matched by her belief in urban young adults and love of community service. She recently relocated back to her hometown of Detroit where she founded The Detroit Hip Hop Organization, a non-profit focused on preserving, promoting, and protecting the legacy of Detroit’s hip-hop music and culture. She also serves on a variety of boards and is active in local politics. A valued Digital Marketing and Content Strategist, Biba Adams is also a Brand Consultant to a variety of lifestyle brands, high-profile clients, and entertainment companies.  A classic “Gemini,” Biba is known for the quick wit, insightfulness, and playful energy that she brings to every project she puts her hands on. AllHipHop: You recently moved back to you hometown. Talk about Detroit and how it factors into who you are. Biba Adams: Detroit  is everything to me. I grew up in the 80s which was a very tumultuous  time in Detroit. Like most major cities, we were heavily impacted by the  crack epidemic, we also had a very contentious mayor in the late  Coleman A. Young. Detroit also experienced a very high rate of white  flight, for most of my life the city was about 90% black. As Detroiters  we learn very early that we are the center of the state, and a very  powerful city (being the hub of the auto industry), but our blackness  also made us heavily disliked and the butt of national jokes and  disdain. It puts a chip on your shoulder. You can see that in the  artistry and the images of Detroit. People think we are some gangster  town, but the way ""they"" talk about Detroit is all just code for black.    AllHipHop:  You are Detroit's Daughter. I've always had a love of the brand of  Hip-Hop Detroit produces and you as the conduit to the industry.  Biba Adams: Aw,  thanks. It's hard for me to say, but is factual that I am a Matriarch  of Detroit Hip Hop. There are never a whole lot of women on any hip-hop  scene and that was true here too. I was very passionate about the  Detroit hip-hop community because we were a community. We were (and  still are) friends, family even. The brand of hip-hop that we make here  is born out of that same need to prove ourselves and our worth to the  world. As well of a little bit of ""F**k you."" Detroit has always been a  musical city. When you grow up in the shadows of Motown, that doesn't  leave. Although the company left, the energy that created it, and a lot  of people who were responsible for that sound were still here. We are  the children and grandchildren of Motown, which is probably one of  America's most recognizable and influential musical eras. We have a  strong sense of pride. These are also just amazing emcees, they are  really smart, amazing dudes. Guys like Royce, Guilty, Elzhi, Black Milk,  Marvwon, the rappers from my hip-hop shop era, as well as younger  dudes. There are a lot of people that I can't mention because of time  and forgetfulness, but this is a city full of amazing rappers. Steel  sharpens steel. I admire them a lot.    AllHipHop: How does business factor into the art of Detroit?Biba Adams: One  of my favorite music business people from Detroit is Al Nuke. He  currently manages Zaytoven. Nuke is under-credited, but he was always so  innovative. He was one of the first guys to promote our music across the  river in Windsor, making him one of the first international Artists.  But, there is also a dearth of business here. There are a lot of amazing  rappers, but not a lot of amazing writers, publicists, managers, etc.  So we still need more of the business polish to get what it is that we  deserve.    AllHipHop: Explain what your present role entails work and business-wise?  Biba Adams: I  wanted moving home to be something special. I tried the label thing in  New York and Atlanta. I knew that when I came home, in the midst of this  amazing resurgence that is largely benefitting white people, that I  wanted to serve small, black businesses and artists. I recently founded  The Detroit Hip Hop Organization which is a non-profit organization that  is focused on protecting, preserving, and promoting the legacy of  Detroit Hip-Hop through events, educational programming, and strategic  partnerships. Right now, a big part of what I do is getting people to  work together productively. I brokered the deal for Detroit vs Everybody  to offer discounts to customers of Dilla's Delights donut shop, for  example. I'm really big on cooperative economics because Detroit has a  big underground economy and a lot of minority owned businesses.    AllHipHop: What’s the most enjoyable part of the job and your duties? Biba Adams: Being  home is the best part. Being with my family. Seeing friends. Seeing the  success of people that I love. My sister just opened an amazing French  café, Le Petit Zinc. I love just being a part of the city again. I'm a  very passionate person, and Detroit is so full of opportunity that every  day can be exciting and interesting.    AllHipHop: What is the hardest part:  Biba Adams: It's  hard, sometimes, to find forgiveness. I still feel under-respected,  underutilized, underpaid sometimes. So, I have to go within very often  and realize that the work that I am doing is bigger than me. I want kids  to write book reports about Detroit hip-hop. I want the city, it's  artists, and myself to have the respect we deserve (and the money that  comes with it on a larger scale.) I'm fortunate that I have an amazing  family, and my brother, Dean, works with me, as well as runs his own  marketing company, Humble Flei. The hardest part exists mostly in my  head. When I get out of there and just do the work, I have great  days.  AllHipHop: Can you describe a moment of adversity personal and in your career?  Biba Adams: I  feel like, as a woman in this industry, that I haven't been given (or  taken) opportunities. In addition to my work in hip-hop, I also work in  the non-profit/service space. I've been discriminated against, I've been  gossiped about. I've had the struggles most people have, and especially  people who have any kind of high-profile. It's important for me to  always stay clear about what is an adversity? Am I causing it? Can I  change it? Most importantly, can I go around it to get what I want?    AllHipHop: What keeps you from giving up?  Biba Adams: I  love my city. I love the music we make. I am a fan first. I am a fan of  the people that I work with. I love J. Dilla with all my heart, I loved  Proof with all my heart. The love and legacy for Detroit and Detroit  hip-hop makes me want to keep going every day. I had a difficult time in  my late teens and early 20s, I wouldn't be exaggerating if I said that  this music and this culture, in this city, saved my life. I owe it my  best.    AllHipHop: Who inspired you to become a leader or boss?  Biba Adams: My  Grammie. My grandmother always worked two jobs. If you didn't have a  job and a side hustle, she questioned your character. She owned a flower  shop when I was growing up and I admired her tenacity. After the flower  shop, she made and sold church hats, successfully. She is a very  hard-working woman. She's also really funny, loves God with her whole  heart, and loves her family. She, my mother, and my daughter inspire me  every day.    AllHipHop: How do you balance work, and personal life?  Biba Adams: What  personal life? I have kind of resigned myself that I am an extremely  independent woman. I'm not in a relationship right now, because it is  sometimes a challenge for men to have to play the background to a woman  who works as much as I do. I really like the Chris Rock analogy that  being in a relationship is like being in a band. Sometimes you are on  lead vocals, and sometimes you play the tambourine. But, when you do,  play it with all your heart. Don't compete, support each other's  success. That's what I'm hoping for in my next relationship. As far as  my family life, I give myself in service to my family. I take the trash  out, I clean, I take my grandmother to doctor's appointments. I give,  give, give...somehow, I find that it also fills me, in return.    AllHipHop: What do you like to do for fun?  Biba Adams: How  awesome is it that my professional life is fun for me? I don't really  have an ""off"" switch. But when I'm not working, I LOVE to read. I  learned to read at 3 years old and haven't stopped since. I read a book a  week, at least. I also have a pretty strong spiritual practice, so I  like to read stuff about metaphysics, A Course in Miracles, that kind of  thing. My mom is a big movie buff, so I watch a lot of movies with her  or on my own. And, I hang out with my dog.    AllHipHop: Final words?  Biba Adams: I  am thankful for this opportunity. You are a dear friend and AllHipHop  will always feel like home to me. It's SO important that hip-hop music  and culture love and celebrate women. We contribute to it, we make  amazing music, we run these labels, we love this culture as much as the  men do. I hope that we continue to open doors for female emcees, and  other contributors to the culture. Respect women, Listen to women, Trust  women, Love women, Invest in women, especially Black women.     AllHipHop: Oh, do you hate ironside hex (formerly known as hex murda)? Biba Adams: [Laughs] No... Hex is a big old pumpkin. He is such a legend in Detroit hip-hop.  I'm so grateful that he is embracing his talent as a writer, and  telling all these amazing stories. He just wrote a mini-history for the  D-Cyphered book by Jenny Risher. I love how active he is on social  media. I could never hate Hex. I love him very much. He hates you  though. Kidding, I think the only person he TRULY hates is Trump.  Detroit, What?! .[Laughs]  ​ ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912207618.95/warc/CC-MAIN-20190327020750-20190327042750-00023.warc.gz
30,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/ahhpowerfulwomen-chandra-g-pitts-uses-hip-hop-to-create-kings-Aj02etvFmUiQymnBaGqMvA/,"Chandra Pitts began her life’s work organizing youth in Jamaica whose families could not afford to send them to school. In 2008, she developed the largest school-based mentoring program in Delaware’s Christina School District serving 247 at risk youth. In 2009, she founded The Village Learning Center securing a 2.1 million dollar federally funded contract to continue her work with marginalized youth. Her company's innovative education model was adopted by the Department of Education in Delaware and New Jersey, implemented in 42 schools throughout the region, and created 62 new jobs in its first year alone. She used this successful social enterprise to launch non-profit, social impact agency, One Village Alliance, Inc. As founding President & CEO, Chandra’s primary work takes a gender specific approach to growing purpose-driven youth into their true greatness with a strong focus on education, global leadership and social enterprise. “Girls Can Do Anything!” empowers hundreds of girls throughout the Delaware Valley to redefine womanhood and what it means to be a girl. Raising Kings changes society’s prominent image and expectations of men and boys of color by elevating the level of positive male engagement in the lives of boys. And Suitable Men provides fatherhood training, man-to-man mentoring, and leadership support for dads in our ""village"" approach to holistic youth development. In 2017, Chandra Pitts became the youngest person ever inducted into the Delaware Hall of Fame for Women, an esteemed honor she accepts on behalf of all the extraordinary women who paved the way before her. Also,Chandra graced the September 2017 cover of Delaware Today Magazine as one of the most Intriguing Delawareans.  AllHipHop hopes to add to her numerous accolades but connecting the dots between her work and the Hip-Hop community.  AllHipHop: First of all, tell me about the Wakanda Warrior photo shoot you recently put together inspired by the Black Panther. My daughter and I were included and loved it. Chandra G. Pitts: It was such an honor to have you and your daughter join us for this fun celebration of all things Black and Beautiful! The idea of the Wakanda Warrior photo shoot was something that I knew my artist friends would share my excitement about. I called my girlfriend who makes jewelry, a few of my photographer friends, natural hair enthusiasts and of course, my Marvel fanatics and it was on! We were all so excited to be a part of history through this project that everyone who collaborated on the project fully sponsored their time, talent and resources.  Seeing the marvel of Black Panther on the big screen was not just for comic fanatics. I appreciated the film as a Black culture fanatic. Seeing Hollywood depict a truly Black superhero, African culture celebrated for its wealth and beauty, the worlds wealth buried on the continent, and such intelligent, strong and beautiful Black siblings, scientists, and warriors; AND STRONG BLACK WOMEN at that!!! For many of us living in America as a ""Black"" person, Wakanda is a real as anyplace we've ever traced the African part of our ""African American"" existence too.  We showed up in theaters around the world like we were from Wakanda! Tribal make-up, African garb, special order t-shirts, and most importantly, proud to be Black! As a result, the Black Panther film made history. The truth is WE made history! Our Wakanda Warrior photo shoot during Black History Month captured all this beauty, culture and melanin in a way that we will never forget. #WakandaWarriorsDE forever!!  AllHipHop: Explain what your job entails? Chandra G. Pitts: I have six jobs! I'm the CEO of a social impact agency called One Village Alliance. This is my dream job, which allows me to create my own course and determine my own destiny. It's a purpose driven journey to grow youth into their true greatness and transform lives through education entrepreneurship and the arts. Having started this organization myself as a social entrepreneur, I still do much of the work. My job consists of everything from HR to advocacy including: fundraising; grant writing; organizational development; program development; even the administrative management. My dynamic role requires me to be a boss in business, build relationships at the legislative and corporate level, as well as stay connected on the ground to stay in tune with children, families and the community we represent.https://www.instagram.com/p/BfpSUybDiNY/ AllHipHop: Tell me how Hip-Hop has factored in the work you do in the communities you serve. Chandra G. Pitts: I was born and grew up with Hip-Hop and it's still very much a part of who I am today. Hip-Hop was created to represent a culture for those most marginalized in high-poverty neighborhoods and give voice to the struggles devastating people's lives. Even as Hip-Hop continues to be bought, sold and co-opted, the culture is still growing as a global social justice movement. My work is a part of that activism that was and continues to be inspired by hip-hop. Like Tupac, Public Enemy, KRS-1, Queen Latifah, and many others who used their platform to share the struggles of youth growing up in extreme poverty and call for action, I use every platform possible to raise awareness and bring change to the communities we serve. What defines the greatest lyricists is their storytelling ability. The most important part of my work is telling the story. In order to do that with integrity I work closely with our youth. That means staying relevant in our approach. My goal is to continue the movement toward social justice while building a counterculture of greatness, fortitude and power for our people.  AllHipHop: What’s the most enjoyable part of the job and your duties: Chandra G. Pitts: I love waking up every single day with the knowledge that I'm living in my purpose. I enjoy using my voice to change people's mind; about education and their ability to learn; about black males and mass incarceration; about themselves. Our words have the capacity to change the world. I'm a research person. The more information I have, the more empowered I become. I enjoy sharing information with others. Numbers are one thing. Everything in my world is data driven but without the narrative, the numbers can lie. I enjoy using the power of my voice and the capacity of words to bring truth to life.https://www.instagram.com/p/BePDqgpDerW/ AllHipHop: What is the hardest part: Chandra G. Pitts: Building the right team around me is by far the most difficult part of my job. It's right up there with dealing with the suffering and loss of life of youth in our streets. Seriously. It's a world changer when you have the right team of passion-driven, uniquely qualified, creative professionals working together with integrity and a standard of excellence.  Strong leadership is highly respected in the world we live in... Unless you're a young woman of Color. I'm a first generation Mexican American and a Black woman. It has definitely presented more than one challenge that people have had to overcome or not. But it makes building that loyal, dedicated team a very conscious, strategic and tireless effort. It means having to deal with funding partners in an almost exclusively white world of philanthropy; personal agendas, jealousy and complacency among staff; dare I mention the lack of willing mentors committed to cultivating the next generation of Black and Hispanic women leaders. Yes. I've received lots of accolades and have become a well respected for all that we're accomplishing in the world. I've worked very hard and earned every ounce of it. But the knowledge that there is always someone there to underestimate, undermined and undervalue me is something that I'm very conscious of. That's okay. My staying power is unquestionable. https://www.instagram.com/p/BeLKoE0Dmdy/AllHipHop: Can you describe a moment of adversity personal and in your career? Chandra G. Pitts: As a philanthropist, everything I do is for the love of humanity. I face my greatest moments of adversity when I'm fighting against a system with no army. I distinctly remember walking through the neighborhood one day early in my work in an effort to mobilize residents to fight for equitable education for their own children. While many thanked me for the work we were doing on their behalf, they declined to join the movement. Most are so disenfranchised and locked out that they feel they no longer have a voice. The uphill battle becomes a lot more steep when the people who are most impacted by injustices are immobilized.  AllHipHop: What keeps you from giving up? Chandra G. Pitts: My son. I remember my conscious thought the moment I found out that I was going to bring a child into this world. I knew I had a lot of work to do. And raising him has made me even more aware of the sense of urgency. There's no way I can turn my back and walk away from the injustices facing our sons and daughters.. It's not in me. I'm clear about my purpose. I feel a great sense of personal responsibility to my ancestors who came before me and risked their very lives; the elders who gave their freedom, many of whom are still incarcerated even today; and most importantly, the generations who are coming up in this world. It's really that deep for me.  It's our responsibility to do something and there's an urgency. I remember when I was developing our Raising Kings initiative to change the image, expectations an outcomes for our men and boys. I came across a music video that had a huge impact on me. It showed me what was happening right outside my door with our children in a way that I had never seen it before. Through the lens of Hip-Hop, I was able to experience life, being a kid, fatherhood, even youth engagement in ""Out Delaware"" by local rapper known as Bobby Dimes. Just a few short years later when the same young man who enlightened and inspired me lost his life to gun violence, I was painfully reminded of the extreme urgency to keep going.  AllHipHop: Who inspired you to become a leader or boss? Chandra G. Pitts: I was raised by a civil rights activist. With the constant support from my dad, my mom was a fierce advocate for justice in education and beyond. She continues to serve as my inspiration, role model and trusted confidant.  AllHipHop: How do you balance work, and personal life? Chandra G. Pitts: That's a challenge. My work is a huge part of my personal journey. But I make it a point to stay physically strong through proper, eating, rest, and breathing. I give my mind a rest through comic relief and make time for frequent world travel. And most importantly, I remain spiritually grounded with lots of prayers of gratitude!  AllHipHop: What do you like to do for fun? Chandra G. Pitts: I travel. I love to cook. And I'm a great cook so I entertain friends often which is a lot of fun for me.  AllHipHop: Final words? Chandra G. Pitts: Keep going!  Click here for One Village Alliance.

Chanel is a Brand and Media Director for top brands across multiple genres including music, fashion, and technology. She is the co-host of a new podcast for the millennial mom “Our First Time; AMommyCast” which has been mentioned on AllHipHop, Hot 97, Bossip, VIBE magazine and more. She also was also the recipient of the Essence of a Woman award from the Queens chapter of the NAACP (March, 2012) and named top 45 publicists you should hire (May 2014). AllHipHop: You have been one of the few people in PR that are native New Yorkers. How do you feel about the changes in the city? Chanel Rae Pettaway: Its been a blessing to see some of the neighborhoods ""cleaned up"" as in less trash and less rats but heartbreaking to see the natives - along with the culture - pushed out just as they did the trash. If you came to New York for the cool factor/culture but don't want cats in your bodega, ice cream trucks to play music, or hire locals for your new coffee shop than I question how much you actually love this city. AllHipHop: Dipset is a handful - with Jim, Cam, Juelz, Freekey and them. What is the experience like working so closely with an iconic rap collective? Chanel Rae Pettaway: Sometimes I have to pinch myself. I remember being an intern at their early label and to now be their publicist is surprising to even myself. If only I could go back and tell my college self to relax - you will figure this out. What people should know about them is that they are as authentic as you can get. They are an open book, where their heart on their sleeve and because of that they will forever influence our culture. AllHipHop: Who else do you work with? Chanel Rae Pettaway: I work with Joell Ortiz, Chinx (Forever RIP), Salaam Remi, Par-City, Iman, Cipha Sounds, Peter Rosenberg, DJ O. Minaya, DJ Drewski, Hip Hop Mike, DJ Juanyto, DJ Spynfo, DJ E. Stylez, and more. I also have been working as a Public relations consultant for Hot97 itself.  AllHipHop: What makes The Legion Media Group special? Chanel Rae Pettaway: The Legion Media Group (TLMG) is an integrated marketing, branding and public relations group based in New York City, assembled to harness the talents of its‘ creative, dedicated and astute professionals in response to the questions and complexities concerning the rapidly evolving landscape of media and communication. Our goal: to create comprehensive and insightful strategies, utilizing the ideal media mix, to best convey their client’s message and to help clients identify, manage, publicize and protect their brands. AllHipHop: At this point you are a vet. What are you thoughts on the game of public relations now? Chanel Rae Pettaway: I think its an over saturated industry and easily manipulated. People can easily call themselves a publicist without any merit and people will believe them. Right now there are people who are more interested in being talent than the publicist. Yes, self promotion is is a very necessary in this social media landscape but it is a very fine line. AllHipHop: What do you feel is the highlight of your career thus far?The highlight of my career? Chanel Rae Pettaway: I honestly don't think i'm there yet. That feeling that keeps me motivated to accomplish more. AllHipHop: What’s the most enjoyable part of the job and your duties? Chanel Rae Pettaway: The most enjoyable moments is talking to people daily and forming new relationships. I love meeting new people and genuinely getting to know their interests, not just what it would take to get a media placement. I'm proud to say most contacts become friends. AllHipHop: What is the hardest part? Chanel Rae Pettaway: The hardest part is explaining to people what actually is public relations. My mom still thinks i just go on Facebook all day and party every night. I tell people my job is not to create the news, its to publicize the news. AllHipHop: Can you describe a moment of adversity personal and in your career? Chanel Rae Pettaway: Most people thought me having a child at 30 (so young in industry years) would be a setback for me. Chanel maybe you should wait i was told. Instead my son Chase has been my motivation and my drive to continue. I have to succeed for him. It is NOT an option. AllHipHop: What keeps you from giving up? Chanel Rae Pettaway: Again my family. I have to keep making them proud. AllHipHop: Who inspired you to become a leader or doctor? Chanel Rae Pettaway: I've had many mentors along the way, but my mother has been the one to show me you can have it all. AllHipHop: How do you balance work, and personal life? Chanel Rae Pettaway: Self-care is truly necessary. Schedule sleep just as you would that meeting or call. Learn to say no even when the guilt sets in. AllHipHop: What do you like to do for fun? Chanel Rae Pettaway: I love to travel. I love the beach. You will always find me there (if you follow me on social you will know most times im even on a beach in my head). AllHipHop: Final words?

And with every breath I take, I will continue to fight for our cause and for the foot soldiers who have been on the front lines, making it easier for those who have followed us. Members of the media are diverse and we have our own opinions which are based on our personal experiences. Too often, these opinions are not being respected by the larger community, partially due to lack of understanding and in some cases just the unwillingness to respect opinions that are diametrically opposed to someone else’s.  But I am an optimist and continue to be inspired by those who say that I inspire them. As a result, I embrace the various forums that we have for self expression i.e. the blogs, websites and niche publications that have emerged in the past decade or so. I remember when there was a time when we had a small handful of major newsstand publications that targeted our culture: Ebony, Essence, Jet, Black Enterprise and Right On!. We were the leaders in various genres. Of course, with the changing landscape, we have others, but we still do not have the support of the community to keep many other publications afloat. But we matter, and I intend to make sure that we continue to matter. Solidary is so important. There are many, many journalists and publicists who embrace me, and I feel that it is important that we take care of each other. Too often we are tunnel-versioned and are not cognizant of the world around us and it takes hearing of a death of someone we respected to remind us of our vulnerability. Nothing is promised, therefore we must make our mark every single day.  AllHipHop: What do you think your legacy is thus far and when are we going to get that memoir?  Cynthia Horner: My legacy reminds me of a globe that continues to turn. Every time I sit down to write another chapter, we either lose another important figure to whom I had a personal attachment or I am blessed with additional opportunities to share my knowledge with the world in other mediums. But that memoir is coming. It’s being prepped. I just haven’t decided how and where it will end. It’s an important story, however. I’m constantly reminded by people about my contributions and my place in the industry. It’s important for anyone who has dreams, regardless of their age or ethnicity. I was taught by my parents to dream big, and throughout my career I have helped entertainers make their dreams come true. AllHipHop: You have interviewed everybody from Michael Jackson, Prince, Janet Jackson and so many more. Can you talk about some of those experiences and what, if you can, was the highlight interview of your career? Cynthia Horner: Wow, I have had so many highlights that it is even difficult to say what experience ranks number one. I remember once reading that Beyoncé said that she had had many big days. I’ve had them, too, as a journalist. Since Michael Jackson and Prince are deceased, I would suppose that getting to know them on an extremely personal level would rank at the top. I don’t believe that there will ever be another Michael Jackson or Prince, so my time with them was very special. I’m proud that I can say that I had a hand in their success and that they appreciated what was done for them. I was able to have so much direct contact with them and interacted with these entertainers socially.   I was simply devastated over the death of Heavy D, an artist that I just adored as a friend. I’ll never forget the time when we ate at a restaurant and when the other diners recognized him, he graciously took care of all of their checks!  - Cynthia Horner Just imagine me jet setting around with these people who are two of the biggest names that ever lived. That was pretty much unheard of and could never happen today.  I never abused their friendships. I am so grateful that I experienced having such an impact on their careers and I miss them. As you know, I have a very unusual speaking voice, but those entertainers always told me that my voice was my calling card. I still can’t believe that they are gone.  Since this interview is for AllHipHop, which has remained at the top of my list of these types of sites, I must confess that there are several hip hop artists that I miss. I was simply devastated over the death of Heavy D, an artist that I just adored as a friend. I’ll never forget the time when we ate at a restaurant and when the other diners recognized him, he graciously took care of all of their checks!  And Biggie and Tupac, my God, what tragedies.  AllHipHop: Word on the street is you or your husband has purchased Right On! or Word Up a magazine, which was infamously mentioned by Biggie Smalls.  These magazines are part of my legacy and I will always cherish them. It was always a dream that I would own these magazines. I have a lot of exciting news which will I’ll share at a later date.  Cynthia Horner: I’m good at keeping secrets but I’m ready to burst at the seams (LOL). AllHipHop: Explain what your present role entails work and business-wise? What are you up to these days? Cynthia Horner: I have my fingers in many pies. In addition to editing several magazines, I publish my own and I still have a public relations firm called Cinnamon CHIPS Media. My husband and I specialize in working with young artists like Jahee (an R&B singer who is featured on the song “Uncongenial Lover”) and several other artists.  AllHipHop: You were running Right On! magazine at the age of 21. How was that for you? Cynthia Horner: I had to be one of the world’s most responsible employees. The job fell into my lap but I had to put in the work. I entrusted with a huge amount of responsibility and had to walk a fine line, especially when I had to work so closely with the biggest names in the entertainment world---The Jacksons, Soul Train dancers, Janet Jackson, New Edition, and then spearheading the hip hop journalism movement. Although I never thought I would get involved with entertainment journalism, my first job blossomed into becoming my life. AllHipHop: What is the hardest part of being successful these days? Cynthia Horner: I need to find more time to do things for myself. The only occasion where I have downtime is when I am not feeling well. The rest of the time I’m awake 24/7  AllHipHop: Can you describe a moment of adversity personal and in your career? Cynthia Horner: I like to keep things positive, especially since I’m the keeper of the legacy of Right On!, which is an expression of positivity. But it’s disconcerting that some people who are in the entertainment field do not understand the value of people of color who work in the media field. But nothing will ever stop me. If our ancestors could survive in the face of adversity, then who am I to complain about the small stuff? I’m still out here doing what I love and enjoying reinventing myself all the time. AllHipHop: What keeps you pushing forward? Cynthia Horner: Knowing that there is a need for my skills. Also,  while I am want to make sure that I correct a lot of misinformation about entertainment journalism.  AllHipHop: Who inspired you to become a leader or boss? Cynthia Horner: Initially I inspired myself. I always wanted to be a role model. That was my thing. As an adult, however, I was inspired by Suzanne DePasse at Motown Records. She is a person who has since made her mark in the areas of film and television but a very long time ago, she spearheaded artist development at Motown. The artists were trained to be their best and that was so important. I incorporated a lot artist development techniques with our magazines in terms of  styling photo sessions, media training, etc., so that the celebrities would shine. Alex Haley, author of “Roots,” was another hero. And, of course, the late broadcast journalist Walter Cronkite. I have a lot of heroes and sheroes. It’s disconcerting that some people who are in the entertainment field do not understand the value of people of color who work in the media field. But nothing will ever stop me. - Cynthia Horner AllHipHop: How do you balance work, and personal life? Cynthia Horner: I try to make sure that I do some normal things that are not entertainment-related as I have been accused of being a workaholic. I am married to a wonderful man, Ken Harris, aka KENTHEPHOTOGRAPHER, and that helps. He and I have been married for nearly 9 years, and he keeps me grounded. My wedding day was the biggest day of my life; I felt like the true Princess Bride. AllHipHop:What is something most people don't know about Cynthia Horner? Cynthia Horner: I am a shopper who won’t spend a cent unless it’s a bargain. Every single “big day” outfit was purchased for so little money that it is unbelievable. That is total fun to me. I also loved reading romance novels written by Rochelle Alers who was a special surprise guest  at my wedding. And I have a collection of well-loved stuffed animals and I am a member of Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority, Inc. AllHipHop: Final words? Cynthia Horner: I can honestly say that I have done my job well, but the job isn’t done. Look out for the stories that I am telling on digital platforms, magazines and other places… ​ ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912203462.50/warc/CC-MAIN-20190324145706-20190324171706-00555.warc.gz
33,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/ahhpowerfulwomen-erica-bowen-from-def-jam-to-dream-job-pAD8r2NaS02Qh6KV7TCrkA/,"(AllHipHop Features) Erica  Bowen, founder and CEO of Blanco Entertainment believes that its easy  to be in the right place at the right time by simply following your  heart. Being true to herself and doing what she loves with the people  most important to her have always opened up doors for Bowen, whether it  was promoting Mad Wednesdays alongside the now legendary Maria Davis  (featured on Jay Z’s 22 two’s), or filling in as the assistant for Def  Jam honcho and close friend Nicole Jones when her hired assistant would  miss work. Bowen’s willingness to play her part for the team has lead  her to roles that are bigger than she could have ever imagined for  herself.  From  2000-2006, Erica Bowen rose swiftly through the ranks of Def Jam,  filling the positions of file clerk and manager of business affairs all  the way up to her final position of A&R  Administration. During her  time with Def Jam & Island Records, Bowen oversaw projects for  iconic artists like Jay Z, Kanye West, Rihanna and Ne-Yo. She also  managed records for Young Jeezy during his time at Def Jam and  eventually traded her New York offices to become General Manager of CTE  from 2006-2017 in Atlanta, GA.  Bowen’s  11 years with one of Atlanta’s most cherished artist & creative  minds afforded Bowen numerous opportunities to to create success for  Jeezy and CTE’s special style of southern hip-hop, blending the booming  808’s of early trap with lyricism that was real as it was fun. As head  of CTE, Bowen was able to take that raw energy and help artists channel  it into amazing street records like “Corporate Thuggin” and into full on  social commentary like Young Jeezy’s 2008 album “The Recession”. Bowen  counts the album as a career highlight based off of its commercial  success and its cultural impact, with Obama himself paying thanks to  Young Jeezy and company for their voter registration drives and other  educational efforts during his first run for office. Other service  initiatives through the Street Dreamz Foundation have flourished under  Erica Bowen’s leadership; among them are the Lighthouse Foundation and  Hosea Feeds the Hungry.  Since  departing from CTE in 2017, Bowen has focused all of her attention  towards launching her entertainment company Blanco Entertainment while  directing the careers of artist Cosa Nostra Kidd and her recording  artist son Westside KJ, two of new Atlanta’s hottest artists poised for  the next industry takeover. Bowen also enjoys spending time alone  relaxing, mentoring young women in the industry & running an event  planning business as a passion project.   AllHipHop: What does your job entail?  In  my career I’ve worn a lot of different hats from managing daily  operations at major labels to creating and tracking budgets for album  releases; anything related to recording is my favorite part of the job.  I’ve handled show booking, road management, handling all the travel and  lodging. I’ve even worked on video sets and as street team. I'm proud to  say there is not a role I that have not played. AllHipHop: What's the most enjoyable part of your job?  The  most enjoyable part is I get to do something different everyday.  Everyday is different than the one before. What might’ve worked on  Monday, may fail on Wednesday. It’s so many moving parts and so many  people involved with making an artist successful and making sure they  hit their target audience. Its a lot of trial and error in this career  and this lifestyle but its worth it. The changes are what keep me  excited and motivated. AllHipHop: What is the hardest part?  The disappointment, because again, everything is trial and error. Its hard to see what you thought was a good idea fail.  AllHipHop: Can you describe a moment of adversity in your career?  My  biggest moment of adversity was transitioning from being an employee to  an entrepreneur. I started out working for major labels, the biggest  hip-hop label of all time, Def Jam. From there I went to work with Jeezy  and CTE, and Jeezy is a legend. People think you’re crazy to walk away  from what they think is a good thing, but at the end of the day you have  to be true to yourself. I knew I wanted more for myself and I knew that  I had a proven track record based on my career history. It made sense,  at least to me, to start my own business. That’s why I started Blanco  Entertainment. AllHipHop: What keeps you from giving up?  My  son. He’s my number one supporter and he’s talented himself. Watching  him mature into an artist with his own tastes and opinions about things  reminds me of starting out in this industry. I just want to be there to  give him the advice when he needs it, but also to set an example for him  to learn from. Plus he keeps me on my toes too.  AllHipHop: Who inspired you to become a leader or a boss?  Nothing  is ever handed to you, especially woman of color. I come from a family  of hard workers who instilled the value of being twice as good as  everyone else. People like my dad & my grandmother. My inspirations  in this industry are those who remind me of my family with their work  ethic; women like  Sylvia Rhone, Nicole Jones and Karen Kwak who I  worked under during my time at Def Jam. AllHipHop: How do you balance work and personal life?  Ha!  I have yet to master work & my personal life after almost 20 years  in this industry. The music world is not a 9-5 job. It’s hard to not  bring work home with you, just like its hard to not set aside your  personal feelings at work, because in a sense you’re always at work.  Artists and producers and their teams, they all have a personal  relationship outside of music a lot of the time, whether they knew each  other before the fame or not. I knew that when I started though.  I am  just blessed to have a son who shares a love and appreciation of music. I  love the work that I do and now that my son is pursuing his own career,  my love for work and my love for him intersect a lot. AllHipHop: What do you do for fun?  I like to spend quiet time and doing things to pamper myself. Regular stuff like get my hair and nails done. Go shopping.  AllHipHop: What does it mean to you to be a powerful woman in the hip-hop industry.  Can you define what one is?  I  can say that it takes three things, for sure, to make a powerful woman;  especially in a male dominated space like hip-hop: a positive attitude,  being assertive and being a team player. So many people will set what  they think are impossible standards for you just because you are a woman  and will want to see you fail. I’ve had to assert my opinion in spaces  where my presence wasn’t wanted and my skills weren’t accepted. Being  able to keep in mind that I feel good about myself and what I do makes  it easier for me to speak up when I feel the need but also keep the work  about the artist and the goals we have as a team.  AllHipHop: Any final words or advice?  If  you really want to be a powerful woman, you have to understand that  being a boss isn’t about just being creative or innovative or having the  best idea. Its about utilizing your network and your team; respecting  them by listening to them and creating opportunities around what you  trust them to see. It’s also about being of service to the people around  you and making sure you’re indispensable to whatever part of the  industry you’re in. Catch Erica on social media @MsEricaBlanco!

Spending the last 18 years successfully climbing the corporate  ladder, Cowan has worn many hats throughout her career. Her diverse  experience and dedication to the music industry has built her a  long-lasting career in an industry known for breeding a short life span  for most executives. She has lent her talents to Def Jam, BET, Bad Boy,  Motown, Phat Farm, and Rush Communications, working closely with the  renowned hip-hop music mogul Russell Simmons. In late 2016, in pursuance of her new dreams outside of music, Cowan  relocated to LA to work in scripted television with her friend and  mentor Suzanne dePasse. The journey continues… We caught up with Rhonda Cowan to learn more about her extensive career and transition into a new one: AllHipHop: Explain what you’re job entails: Rhonda Cowan: After a 20-year career in  the music industry and 9 more at BET, I decided to follow another dream  and transitioned to producing television. Right now my job is to learn  all I can about scripted television and film. Currently, I’m working on a  TV movie about Michael Jackson with my good friend and mentor the  legendary Suzanne dePasse. AllHipHop: What’s the most enjoyable part of the job and your duties: Rhonda Cowan: The most enjoyable part of  this job is working in an environment where people are respectful to one  another, and the craft. Where questions are encouraged and welcomed.  Also, working with some of the most respected (brown) faces in TV and  film is definitely a plus. My duties include keeping abreast of matters  concerning production both creative and administrative. I’m here to  absorb everything! AllHipHop: What is the hardest part: Rhonda Cowan: The hardest part of the job is the downtime between scenes and staying away from the crafty table. AllHipHop: What advice do you have to offer people that want to be where you are or aspire to make it in the business. Rhonda Cowan: Lose your ego and don’t be  too proud to accept a lesser position if you learn something while  getting paid, and it takes you where you need to be – it’s a win!  Remember, no task is too small. While working at BET I attended NYU,  interned for a television producer on a reality show and established my  own production company, Life’s a Beach Media. Under this banner, I  developed and cast a show about entertainment attorneys. In 2015 I sold  my first show Money. Power. Respect to WeTV. I never lost sight of my  goals, nor did I care what people thought about my choices. Mute the  distractors. AllHipHop: Can you describe a moment of adversity personal and in your career? Rhonda Cowan: The biggest moment of  adversity in my career came after I left BET in 2013 to pursue my career  as a TV producer. I began by getting what I thought was an amazing  opportunity to produce a reality TV show. Instead, I was met with  hostility by my colleagues. It became my greatest lesson of resilience  and restraint in the face of adversity. AllHipHop: What keeps you from giving up working within a male dominated industry Rhonda Cowan: When I began working at Def  Jam in the early 90’s, Carmen Ashurst-Watson was the President and every  major position at the label was occupied by a woman. Russell Simmons  strategically surrounded himself with strong, intelligent women of  integrity who led by example on how to survive in the male-dominated  music industry without compromising your femininity or reputation. These  indelible lessons are part of my DNA. AllHipHop: Who inspired you to become a leader or boss Rhonda Cowan: There’s a real distinction  between a leader and a boss; anyone can be a boss, being a leader  requires qualities that allow you to put your ego aside and help others  grow without fear of being out-shined. The people who inspired me to  become a leader is Russell Simmons, Suzanne dePasse and Sean Puffy  Combs. Russell, Suzanne and Puff all hire people who are smarter than them  in their respective areas of expertise. They realized early, being the  smartest in the room was detrimental to building their brand and  businesses. Russell would push his team to the forefront and encourage  us to be fearless always telling us to “do what you love and the money  will come” – this taught me to follow my dreams and to never put money  before my own happiness. Puffy used to say, “I pay for your opinion”  which gave me the courage to express myself in any room. Having survived  white male dominated Hollywood, Suzanne dePasse is a born leader who is  the queen of politics and has mastered the art of the deal. She has an  eye for talent and is always dropping gems for me to grasp.  Understanding my journey Suzanne once said, “She stoops to conquer.” (Editor’s note: She Stoops to Conquer is an 18th-century stage play by Oliver Goldsmith) I was fortunate to be raised by leaders instead of by wolves, which is common in entertainment. AllHipHop: How do you balance work and personal life? Rhonda Cowan: I make sure to hit a beach as often as possible for my sanity. AllHipHop: What do you do for fun? Rhonda Cowan: Hit a beach, read scripts, swim laps, drink Rose, rinse repeat. AllHipHop: Final words? Enjoy the journey!  Oh and –  Life’s a Beach Hey lady luck 🔊🌏🎶🎶👣🤝🍸🥂 ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202326.46/warc/CC-MAIN-20190320105319-20190320131319-00318.warc.gz
35,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/ahhpowerfulwomen-jamila-mustafa-is-the-next-level-of-media-Ny53QG84CEusTPWrmTe79Q/,"(AllHipHop Features) With a name like Mustafa, you have to learn how to be a beast. Jamila Mustafa is an award-winning broadcast journalist from Wilmington, Delaware. Growing up as a child Jamila hated her name because it was foreign. With Jamila meaning “Beautiful” and Mustafa meaning “the chosen one”, she had no idea how worthy her name really is. Jamila started to embrace her name during a class trip to China where she first started realizing why her ancestors created that name. Her parents were so impressed with her natural talent they decided to hire an agent to help build her career. After taking many trips to the Big Apple Jamila finally landed a deal on a hit Fox a television series called “The Philadelphia Eagles Kids Club” the show lasted for three long seasons. With having many talents such as acting, dancing and extreme karate fighting she was destined to become a household name. Confidence and poise have gained Jamila to be featured on Black HBCUBuzz 30 under 30, BET 30 under 30, Young Black and LIT, plus many more. Her goal as an entertainer is to be receiving an Oscar than covering the show. Ms. Mustafa has made history leading a tour for NBC’s “Hall of Fame Tour” as the youngest headliner ever! After denying her request the first year in 2016, she came back again in 2017 demanding that she is what the tour needs. She toured colleges such as Alabama State University, Bethune Cookman University, and Texas Southern University. During her tour, she raised scholarship money for each school in hopes of spreading knowledge and unity among each other. Her goal is to raise enough money in the school to help pay for their new equipment in order for the students to express themselves. Jamila’s infamous quote “I am aiming to be significant and not famous” came about when she met Oprah Winfrey. Her mother kept an old news article which called Jamila to be the prophet of her generation. As others would have given anything to meet the Daytime Queen herself, it would be opposite for Jamila. She claims to not know who the legend is, it wasn’t until she did her research that she got a peek into Oprah’s career. The first time she met Ms. Winfrey she had her pen and paper ready. Jamila claims everything she heard Oprah say was very unexpected “she was so before her time, she gave me 3 quotes that I still use today.” 1.) Be true to who you are. 2.) Be successful for something 3.) Always do the right thing But for young Mustafa she was caught off guard with the simple quotes, she had no idea how these steps could make her an icon. Winfrey’s easy yet complex phrases have help guide Mustafa as a young entrepreneur. To determine whether your life is a prophecy you have to have a defined feeling of the social world and events to come. A journalist back in 2007, claimed that Jamila will be a star. Here’s an actual quote from the article “Jamila Mustafa on kids Eagle TV show—one day she’s going to be so famous she’s going to hire her family to work for her—she’s going to be a household name.” Growing up in Wilmington, Delaware the options of having a role model was limited. Often she had to use her imagination of what her life would be like if she came from a big city. Which wasn’t hard for the child star, her confidence is shown through her actions, which has intimidated her competition. Her imagination often came to play when she entered competitions in her tween years. Throughout her life journey she’s been a keen player, taking the crown home five times as Delaware’s very own pageant Queen. Mustafa has destroyed the competition when she ran for Ms. Delaware State University. But her success didn’t come from winning the crown, it came when she was able to voice the problems of Black Colleges everywhere not having enough earnings for their scholars. She conquered the dreams of so many little girls around the nation, that she knew many of her competitors wondered why Jamila? And Jamila response is “what’s for me is for me.” With a mouth as powerful Sojourner Truth, with a mind like Oprah Winfrey, and a fight like Malcolm X, how can she fail? Her journey through life is nothing less of resistant. Every loss she has taken has been a lesson, every step she has taken has been a blessing, and when true talent walks into the room everyone becomes obsolete. The leader of the millennial generation has so many plans for the next year and we can’t wait to watch her grow. It was an honor for us to converse with the next Queen of the Jungle for Women’s History Month, here are some additional questions we asked Jamila: AllHipHop: ​During Women’s History Month who do you admire the most?  I would have to say, my mother because she’s the one who encourages me the most throughout my life. AllHipHop: ​Does it frustrate you when you see people acting as though they can do your talent.  I think of it as, everyone has their own destiny, I can’t allow myself to get upset if someone has the job I want, I just push myself harder the next time. AllHipHop: ​What do you prefer to read as a journalist?  I read books that will make me think, I like to be able to challenge myself as a journalist. AllHipHop: ​How do you manage your personal life and your career?  My personal life is my career, all of my friends are in media too. I always plan my time away from work, weeks in advance so I can be with family. AllHipHop: ​What’s the most enjoyable part of your job? I love that all my co-workers are different in their own way. I love how throughout the day there are last minute changes that I can adjust to. ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202474.26/warc/CC-MAIN-20190320230554-20190321012554-00409.warc.gz

Jasmine’s goal is to foster change and create awareness about the leading socioeconomic issues and challenges of today, like poverty, education and hunger. She has hosted activations in more than 20 US cities and the UK and Haiti and has has collected and donated over 2 million items to causes worldwide and fed over 80,000 people through the Sunday Soul Homeless feeding initiative. Through  her years of work feeding vulnerable populations she saw a great opportunity for technology to solve a real problem - hunger. In January of 2017, she created Goodr, a tech enabled sustainable food waste management company with a goal to eliminate hunger and reduce food waste. Under Jasmine's direction Goodr has now diverted over one million pounds of food from landfill and serves clients including: Atlanta's Hartsfield Jackson Airport, NFL, The Georgia World Congress Center, MetLife and more. Get familiar with change maker, Jasmine Crowe - a #AHHPowerfulWoman! AllHipHop: OK, you have made huge waves in social entrepreneurship.  What made you start Goodr for those that don't know? It was a true organic start for me. For years I had a community service initiative called Sunday Soul ATL where I would cook food for hours in my kitchen, I'm talking like 15-20 hours and the head to the streets and feed 300-500 people who were experiencing homelessness. One day a video from one of my popup restaurants went viral and people were asking me who donated the food? For me it was a light bulb moment, I though for sure someone should be donating the food and from there, Goodr was birthed. AllHipHop: What is next for Goodr and do you have plans to expand or replicate it in other major cities like Atlanta. Expansion is next for us, we've recently launched in Washington, DC, Chicago and Raleigh/Durham, NC. Our goal is to be in 10 cities by the end of this year and 20 in 2020. I want to solve this problem all over the world. AllHipHop: You also are legendary for BlackCelebrityGiving.Com, which is where I saw the pivot, but it was a great look into the other side of celebrities. What made you start it and any chance you will bring it back? I started BlackCelebrityGiving.com because I saw a lack of media exposure for people that we're doing good things and I felt like that was important to highlight. I  loved my work with BCG and it's through that work that Goodr was birthed. I saw great opportunity to give back continually and not only with celebrities, I saw that I could do good on my own. I am revamping BlackCelebrityGiving but not the website, we will focus on mission trips and celebrity giving partnerships - stay tuned. AllHipHop:  For us, what do you think about the state of social entrepreneurship? I think social entrepreneurship is on the rise. More people will see that you can do well, by doing good. We have to continue to highlight our entrepreneurs in this space to encourage others to take this good journey.  AllHipHop: What’s the most enjoyable part of the job and your duties? I get to feed people who would otherwise go hungry and there's nothing better than that. This is the best job ever. AllHipHop: What is the hardest part? I think just knowing that there's so much more work to be done, more people to feed, more cities to get to and just not being able to do everything I want to do right now. AllHipHop: Can you describe a moment of adversity personal and in your career? I have so many moments (laughs). I think the fundraising process was a big eye opener for me, I faced a lot of adversity being a Black woman, living in Atlanta raising money for something like hunger. It was hard to get meetings and then I was told no so many times, I almost gave up. Yet, I knew what I was fighting for was worth it so I kept going. AllHipHop: What keeps you from giving up? For me its that people are going to bed hungry, I will never give up on them. I want to solve hunger more than anyone else in this world. AllHipHop: Who inspired you to become a leader or boss? I would have to say I inspired myself after working in corporate America, I was like this is not for me. I started with my vision board and just decided I wanted to be my own boss and do good things. AllHipHop: How do you balance work, and personal life? I think I am lucky here, I am single with no kids, so I don't have a lot happening in my personal life. I make time for self-care every weekend, I spend time daily with someone I love like my best friends or sisters and always take time for a glass of wine. AllHipHop: What do you like to do for fun? Travel, attending sporting events, dine out, relax at home and travel some more. AllHipHop: Final words? Never give up on your dreams, don't leave anything on the table that can change the world.

37,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/ahhpowerfulwomen-scholar-nola-haynes-takes-talk-shows-to-bold-new-directions-Z-Rcgs0HyUu6w-QiyqG8GQ/,"(AllHipHop Features) Los Angeles is a tough town to thrive in, but the true cream rises to the top through innovation, creativity and tenacity. Nola Haynes current PhD student in Political Science and International Relations, but has garnered out attention through an incredibly unique venture, NHTV.  NHTV is hosted by Haynes, also a seasoned talk show host.  Nola turned towards a career as an academic after she was an union actress, living and working in Los Angeles.  Following the devastation of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in Nola’s native home of New Orleans, LA., she decided to return to college. Nola attended UCLA, Harvard Divinity School and is currently in a PhD program in Political Science and International Relations at USC in Los Angeles. After graduating from Harvard, Nola returned to Los Angeles. Nola created NHTV in a down period, between jobs. NHTV is an independent, docu-style, traveling, online-based talk show. NHTV highlights the professional lives of creatives, entrepreneurs and innovators. The show documents real life, a feature that sets NHTV apart from studio-based talk shows. It draw conversation and context together in a manner we almost never see. AllHipHop: It is a little known fact that you once wrote for AllHipHop, back in the day! I checked and the articles are there, deep in the archives. Nola Haynes: Yes, that’s true. Thank you AllHipHop for reaching back to highlight a past writer for your March celebration of women. I feel at home in this space because Hip-Hop is the soundtrack to my life. AllHipHop: You are the first scholar we have featured in this series. But, you have the other side, which is NHTV (Nola Haynes TV). How do you manage both? Nola Haynes: Really? That blows me away. That fact makes this more of a honor, thank you for including me.  In all honesty, managing both is exciting and strikes balance in my life. However, managing both identities, scholar and creative has its challenges. To me, scholars are creatives, the training is just different. Scholars, create and write all day. NHTV is the visual representation off all that thinking and writing. We simply bring context to the conversation.  AllHipHop: The optics of your show are very different from other talk show ventures. What is the motivation for this? Nola Haynes: I love texture, background and context. On NHTV, we try to capture these elements. I interview creatives, entrepreneurs and innovators. I think it makes sense to show our audience what that world actually looks like. If we cannot get access to a person’s work and professional life, we still try to capture some element of their life or shoot where it makes sense for their brand. Documentaries and shows the late Anthony Bourdain gave us inspire me. AllHipHop: What’s the most enjoyable part of the job and your duties? Nola Haynes: I get to truly represent a teaching pedagogy that I live my life by. Paulo Freire talked about the importance of both theory and praxis. I get to do both in each role I occupy. I love envisioning an episode or research question. I also get to put it out in the real world by testing ideas, failing, retesting, retooling then trying again. It’s imagining it then doing it that gives me all the positive feelings. AllHipHop: What is the hardest part? Nola Haynes: The hardest part is growing your audience in a crowded field of amazing, Black content creators. It’s tough for NHTV because we interview unsung community heroes and that’s a niche sort of thing. So, someone popular in Oakland, may not be a celebrity in everyone’s eyes, but in that community that person, movement or business is vital. NHTV provides a peek into the lives of creatives, entrepreneurs and innovators. AllHipHop: Can you describe a moment of adversity personal and in your career? Nola Haynes: I’m going through that moment now. I had to readjust much of my life since last summer due to school related things. I recall two back-to-back days where my knees literally buckled from devastating news. It’s in those moments you hurt, cry then figure out how to healthily move forward. Filming season 3 of NHTV was cathartic because we grew as a production and we had memorable experiences hanging out with chefs all season. That is to say, NHTV Season 3 almost didn’t happen because I hit a major barrier at work.  AllHipHop: What keeps you from giving up? Nola Haynes: My village, tribe, community. I’m surrounded by too many strong women and men of color to just stop. I’m still close with folks from elementary school in New Orleans - that’s a blessing. From, UCLA, Harvard to USC, my village has expanded and I’m sincerely grateful. No one can live or thrive in this life solo, so when I’m having a rough day, I draw on the strength and journeys of those who came before me and sharing meaningfully with my tribe. AllHipHop: Who inspired you to become a leader or boss? Nola Haynes: Well, that inspiration came early in elementary school in New Orleans. Elementary school in the Catholic system (not all schools) meant pre-K through 8th grade. In that environment, we had a few, not enough, impactful Black, female teachers, along with the sauciest Irish, Catholic nuns you’d ever want to meet. However, my 8th grade teacher, Mrs. Paul, a Black women who was a force of nature intrigue me early on. She embodied all things Black Renaissance, intelligence, creativity, power and an unapologetic blackness that resonates with me to this day. As a scholar, I can’t help but to be drawn to powerhouses like Angela Davis and Kimberle Crenshaw. As a creative, I’m definitely drawn to showrunners like Yvette Lee Bowser, Shonda Rhimes and Issa Rae. My life has always existed at the intersections of education and creativity. So, I appreciate women, especially women of color that create their own lanes and make waves in professions that were traditionally straight, white male. We have an upcoming segment on IGTV, highlighting folks that create their own lanes. I’m so inspired by lane-makers. AllHipHop: How do you balance work, and personal life? Nola Haynes: I find true balance, which includes fitness, hard to strike now-a-days. When I was a grad student in Boston, my life was so disciplined, the train schedule, school, fitness and clean eating ruled my days. Now in LA, I have my car, guest lists, the beach, mountains, happy hour and my friends from undergrad. My quality of life is expanding, which can impact work life, especially when work life triggers anxiety and imposter syndrome. AllHipHop: What do you like to do for fun? Nola Haynes: That’s definitely changed over the years. A few years ago, I would say, lifting weights and hiking. Today I’d say, traveling, creating something and spending quality time with my tribe. AllHipHop: Final words? Nola Haynes: Be your authentic self. I am a Black, female, political scientists who researches at the intersections of national security and identity. I also executive produce and host an indie talk show that is not politics or opinion based.  I am warned all the time not to let the creative subsume the scholar. The way I envision things, one informs the other. So, just because someone else does not share or understand your vision, don’t sacrifice it to satisfy someone else’s idea of your life. If you do, you kill all things authentic about you. And, I’m here to tell you, it’s the unique things that stands out, not the bland bits. We can all do bland, but I prefer cayenne in my food.

38,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/ahhpowerwomen-meosha-a-davis-offers-a-triangle-offense-of-entertainment-dl5ucMIgK0CmfPifiP_OpQ/,"(AllHipHop Rumors) Meosha A. Davis is a shape shifter of sorts. Getting her start in journalism, ""Mimi"" has steadfastly ascended by approaching the entertainment gave from a variety of angles. These days, she is acting and producing content for TV, most recently The Lineup (2018), but continues to make business moves with her company, The Affluent Agency. AA has boasted the luminescent likes of Idris Elba, Lincoln Motor Company, DeSean Jackson, X-Box, Stephen A. Smith, Monster Products and others as clients. AA touts, ""Our number one priority and commitment is therefore to offer, at all times, a world class service to all our clients through marketing, branding, product placement, event planning, and all aspects of lifestyle and entertainment."" Get more familiar with Meosha A. Davis, who is steadfastly creating a whole universe, one planet, star and moon at a time. AllHipHop:  We have seen you rise from early on, here at AllHipHop. Talk a bit about your rise and where you see yourself going. Meosha A. Davis: I started my journey in journalism, and from there I continued to build. I've always had a passion for writing and always loved music. I just didn't know at what capacity I wanted to work in entertainment. I just knew I wanted to write and be around music. I tried my hand at every aspect possible. I've been a stylist, creative director, publicist, manager, and even a nanny for celebrities. I was willing to do the work to rise to what I felt was ""making it"", but writing has always and will always be my first love. This business is mostly who you know, and who knows you, so word of mouth helped me prosper and get consistent work. I see myself being the most sought out writer, director, and producer in the next 2 years. AllHipHop:  Do you ever tell people about AllHipHop's place in your journey? Just wondering! Meosha A. Davis: All the time! I am grateful for having the opportunity to write for one of the most respected and top sites. You guys believed in me and trusted me to represent your brand on video sets and in interviews, and for that I am forever grateful! AllHipHop:  But seriously, you are deep into the Los Angeles and Hollywood circuit. How is that life for vs primarily in music? Meosha A. Davis: Hollywood is a totally different beast than music. Even if you aren't an ""actor"" you have to act and play the game. There are a lot of fake smiles, and let's do lunch and dinner's that never actually happen. Also people who you feel are in position, really don't have the power they portray to have. It's just like High school all over again, and everyone is in cliques, you just have to be apart of the right circle. If you are lucky enough, you meet like minded people who genuinely want to see you prosper. Music is similar in ways, but I feel in music popularity is more praised than actual talent. In Hollywood either you have it, or you don't. AllHipHop: Who are some of your clients and what is the special touch that you offer at The Affluent Agency? Meosha A. Davis: I've actually taken a step back from being so hands on at The Affluent Agency to focus on my personal career in television and film. I was blessed to work with some dope people and brands from: Idris Elba, DeSean Jackson, Stephen A. Smith, X-Box, Lincoln Motor Company, Monster Products, Lance Stephenson, Belvedere, Trent Richardson, Converse, Rasual Butler (RIP), Rico Gathers, and many others. The Affluent Agency also produced several events for great causes including  Marshawn Lynch's Family First Foundation, and the Lupus Foundation which aired on National TV. The Affluent Agency's special touch was that we treated every client as if they were A-List, even if they were unknown. We made our client's feel like family, not just a paycheck. AllHipHop: Is there another level for you with your career and your company? Meosha A. Davis: Yes, I always said I won't stop until I'm on a yacht in Cannes discussing my next film with Stephen Spielberg, but seriously I just want to be a new voice for women and people of color in film/television to tell the stories no one has. I also plan on turning The Affluent Agency into a production company as well. AllHipHop: What’s the most enjoyable part of the job and your duties? Meosha A. Davis: Being able to assist in making others dreams come true is a feeling I can't put into words. To know that what the public see's, I orchestrated behind the scenes is powerful. Also being able to have total creative control of my vision and to have it trusted is priceless. I love the fact that I'm able to travel, and be in the same rooms with people I grew up watching. The free clothes, trips, and shoes is also a plus. AllHipHop: What is the hardest part? Meosha A. Davis: The hardest part in the beginning of starting The Affluent Agency was being taken seriously. I had to compete with larger agencies and agents who were more established. So I worked for free for a lot of clients just to prove myself. It was hard seeing certain people hire white publicist with less experience, paying them and trusting them just because they were white but wanting the ""hook up"" and Free 99 from me. I got to a point where I said if you can't see my worth, then you aren't a client I need on my roster. On the Film/TV side, just dealing with some men in power is hard. They will try you to see if you are weak. AllHipHop: Can you describe a moment of adversity personal and in your career? Meosha A. Davis: Too many to mention! Personally just realizing that no one owes me anything, and I can't expect everyone to have pure intentions, even when I do. In my career I had an incident where I trusted someone to handle business on an event we were producing until I flew in. The day of the event literally hours before it was supposed to start, I found out that the person I trusted lied, and never but a deposit on the venue. I thought my career was over because so many big names had RSVP'D and I had no venue, and this was my first major event. I prayed and cried, and cried some more. Then I received a call from a person I call my guardian angel. Crying hysterically I told them what happened. The said hold on and called me back 5 minutes later. They had a better venue for me, free of charge. So I did damage control and had my assistant send out emails saying venue change due to capacity issues. The event was a great turnout and no one ever knew what happened just hours before. Now I'm very picky about who I allow close to me, and who I do business with. AllHipHop: What keeps you from giving up? Meosha A. Davis: The fear of failure. I have a certain vision of the life I deserve to live, and I refuse to give up until I achieve that, even then, I won't stop because it has to be maintained. AllHipHop: Who inspired you to become a leader? Meosha A. Davis: My grandmother. I saw how she came from nothing, very little education, and literally worked her way to owning houses, land, and a business. She showed me that anything is possible with hard work, and how to be a boss. AllHipHop: How do you balance work, and personal life? Meosha A. Davis: It's all about time management. Sundays are my ""me"" days where I do nothing but things for myself and relax. I don't answer phone calls or texts unless they are emergencies. I literally unplug from the matrix. AllHipHop: What do you like to do for fun? Meosha A. Davis: I love going to the movies, especially matinee's. I also started trying new restaurants every other weekend, that's my new thing. I'm pretty low key outside of what I do. AllHipHop: Final words? Meosha A. Davis: I just hope to inspire the world with my testimony and through my work, and let whoever wants to get into this business know you can make it. No matter who doesn't believe, support, tells you to get a ""real"" job, tells you to go back to school, calls you crazy, or doesn't help you, as long as you believe in yourself, and never stop, you will be successful. Thank you for this opportunity! ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202433.77/warc/CC-MAIN-20190320150106-20190320172106-00166.warc.gz
39,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/aj-tracey-flexes-versatility-in-uk-us-on-self-titled-debut-WwByd2JJGE2UH8Dv68Qekw/,"Having made music since the young age of 6, it’s wild to think the “Psych Out!” rapper only took things seriously in the last 3 to 4 years. Now with over 451K followers on IG alone, he arrives in Los Angeles in good spirits, celebrating the release of his highly-anticipated self-titled debut AJ Tracey. AllHipHop: At what point did you realize this music thing was forreal? AJ Tracey: When I got my first booking for a thousand pounds. I was like “okay, that’s a substantial amount of money.” I showed my mom, she was like “I guess it is going to work out.” That was about 3 years ago, I was 21. I went to college for a year, didn’t really like it. Did a couple of not so legal things to make some money… that’s about it. AllHipHop: They say you haven’t freestyled in the UK in a year. Why is that? AJ Tracey: My freestyles are special. When I do a freestyle, it has to be a fire freestyle. It’s the same reason I don’t do any interviews. When I do it, for it not to be oversaturated. Like “oh he’s done this before, he’s done loads of those.” Each one is impactful.  AllHipHop: “Psych Out” is at over 1M on Youtube in just a month. Did you foresee it blowing up like this? AJ Tracey: Yeah, I thought it’d do well honestly. I got quite a strong fan base, they ride for me. I know whatever I put out, even if they’re not completely rocking with it, they’re gonna push it anyways. ‘Cause they like to see me do well.  AllHipHop: What can we expect from your debut album AJ Tracey? AJ Tracey: You can expect loads of different styles. A lot more of American friendly songs on there. It’s a lot easier for Americans to take in because I know the accent’s a bit hard to get over. I got one with Jay Critch from New York, which we just shot the video for. We’re from the same island, from Trinidad. We just linked up over a mutual. That’s my guy. AllHipHop: Why self-titled? AJ Tracey: Because it’s my debut album and the narrative is really just about me. It makes sense to name it after myself. I didn’t really want to do too much. Nothing crazy, I’ll save that for the later albums. AllHipHop: What is it you want fans to get from your story? AJ Tracey: Basically that I’m versatile. A little bit about my life, how I grew up, how I’m living. It’s an insight for fans and even friends as well. What it feels like to be me, get a little taste of it. AllHipHop: What are some goals yourself as an artist at this point of your career? AJ Tracey: Only goal is I want more people to hear me internationally. London’s cool, everyone knows me in London, but I want people all over the world to hear my sound and enjoy it. I want to be able to go to Japan and people know who I am. AllHipHop: Who’s in your Top 5 in the world? AJ Tracey: Nas is #1. He’s the best rapper ever, I grew up listening to him. Gunna second. We saw him earlier in Barney’s. Mobb Deep. I like Blueface, Blueface is fire. And Vybz Kartel from Jamaica.  AllHipHop: Talk about connecting w/ Baauer on “3AM.” AJ Tracey: That’s my guy! He’s really humble. My management and his are friends. We spend some time together just hanging out, outside of music. One time, he was in New York like “I got the studio, you want to come through?” I was like “yeah man.” We made like 5 songs, and that’s the one he liked. He came up with the idea for the video and we shot it. He’s a really cool guy, one of the nicest artists I’ve ever met. Really down to earth, not a show-off. Just a normal guy. AllHipHop: What was it like because he’s super EDM right? AJ Tracey: Yeah, he’s super EDM. [chuckles] But the stuff he puts out and the stuff on his hard drive are 2 completely different worlds. His hard drive has a bit of everything: dancehall songs, reggaeton sounding, rap, trap, everything. He just basically asked “what vibe do you want?” And we just worked with that. AllHipHop: What is your take on the music industry? AJ Tracey: Super fake, and boring. [laughs] Honestly, I just think everything’s a facade. I just stay out the way. I just play Fortnite and stay in my house. AllHipHop: How have you been able to sustain while staying independent? AJ Tracey: Literally my fans. My fans riding for me. My booking fees are my life. It’s the age of streaming now. Being able to put the music out myself and get all the rewards from streaming has kept me afloat. I always reinvest in myself. The more you invest in yourself, the better results you get. You make more money, and repeat. AllHipHop: What did you do with your first check? AJ Tracey: This is so cliche, but I gave it to my mom honestly. Everybody’s going to say that, but I did actually give it to my mom. She’s been supporting me all my life, so it was only right. AllHipHop: What do your parents think now? AJ Tracey: My mom doesn’t like the content of my lyrics. which is fair enough. She’s super proud of me. She’s just happy I’m doing something positive. I’m not like on the streets or some shit. AllHipHop: How important is social media for your career? AJ Tracey: It’s important to my career, but not my life. I don’t personally as a human care about social network. But for my career, it’s amazing. Fan interaction, engagement, sending things, pushing your music, it’s a really good tool. Especially if you’re independent, it’s a really powerful tool. You need it. You survive off of it. I’m for the social media thing, I just think as humans, we need to relax a little bit. Everyone’s so concerned with how they look online, it’s a bit crazy. AllHipHop: What’s the best encounter you had with a fan? AJ Tracey: On my birthday 3 years ago, these 2 girls DMed me like “we made you a cake. Can we bring it to you?” Everyone around me was advising me not to, like “no don’t let them bring you a cake, that's weird.” But I met them anyway. They were just young girls, really young. They gave me the cake, it was really nice. Me and my mom ate it. They were like “we listen to you forever, we love you.” AllHipHop: How old were they? AJ Tracey: They were like 15, and they made the journey all the way to my ends, all the way to my hood. It was cool. AllHipHop: You're from the hood? AJ Tracey: Yeah, we all are. [points to entourage] Actually she’s not. Neither is he, these two are not. Not that's there's any problem. AllHipHop: Describe the hood. AJ Tracey: Our hoods are like yours, literally. We have projects. We call them housing estates, which is essentially a project. With little parks in the middle, that you’d see maybe in New York. Obviously, it’s quite impoverished, but they’re communities. Everyone looks out for each other, it’s quite nice. A lot of Carribean food shops, because we have a strong Caribbean community in London. AllHipHop: Are you still in the hood? AJ Tracey: No, I don’t live in the hood, but I go there 3x a week at least. Because my mother lives there, she refuses to leave. She loves it too much. She will not leave, so I try my best to make her as comfortable as possible. ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912203755.18/warc/CC-MAIN-20190325051359-20190325073359-00117.warc.gz

Best known for his 2016 mixtape Tangerine Dream, the singer-songwriter blends the genre of hip-hop, R&B, and electronic into one, creating a musical soundscape audiences can’t help but love. AllHipHop sat with Alex in Los Angeles ahead of the release of Tangerine Dream II to chat about his lifestyle change, friendship with Chance The Rapper, and why he deserves to the King of R&B title. AllHipHop: Can you talk about losing 100lbs? I feel like that’s really admirable. Alex Wiley: I still feel pretty chub game, but it was pretty crazy. I did that s##t in a year and some change. AllHipHop: What worked for you? Alex Wiley: I do intermittent fasting. I don’t eat before noon and try not to eat after 8pm. That alone helps a lot. I was living in Glendale in 2017. I got a stationary bike in the crib and just started going HAM on that b##ch. Over the course of living a regimented way for hella days and weeks in a row, I was losing hella weight. I would look up and lose 2 or 3 pounds in 7 days, then 8 or 9 for the past month. I was like “damn in 5 months, I’ve dropped 35 pounds.” I just kept going. AllHipHop: What advice/tips do you have for someone who is struggling with their health? Alex Wiley: The intermittent fasting s##t is super crucial. Even with that, you don’t even have to eat super healthy. Obviously that’d be better and ideal, but if you just give your body more time to process that s##t, then it’s helpful. To me, that’s one of the easiest ways. You basically just skip breakfast and eat 2 meals a day. You eat lunch and dinner, period. If you do that, you’ll be more in the game than you were. AllHipHop: What is it that you want fans to get from your story? Alex Wiley: I don’t know what I want you to get. If you get something from it, that would be fire. If not, that’s arguably equally fire. I hope people like the way it sounds. I hope that for sure. AllHipHop: And you’re independent? Alex Wiley: I guess not really anymore. I got really used to saying it, but it’s not true anymore.  AllHipHop: Who are you signed to? Alex Wiley: I’m with Empire, it’s a joint with them and Universal. We do well with television show placements and s##t. The dude Barry Cole at Showtime puts my songs in a lot of shows over there. That’s been really helpful on getting better deals with Empire. I like it. I’ve been with Empire for years, but this new deal is the first one with Universal’s involvement as well. AllHipHop: Talk about your friendship w/ Chance. Alex Wiley: s##t, that’s my boy. I’ve known him for a super long time. I met him the first day of kindergarten. Mark T. Skinner Elementary School. Day one. You know the first day of kindergarten? Our parents were standing behind us. We were sitting in the last chairs. It was the first day of us going to school, so our parents were still in the class for orientation. He sat a couple people away from me, and my dad and his mom knew each other. They went to high school together. I remember that exact moment, my dad being like “oh s##t, Lisa?” Then I met Chance. AllHipHop: What was it like seeing his career just take off? It’s pretty surreal that this dude that I’ve known for a long time, I can basically namedrop to anyone in the world and they know who I’m talking about. That s##t’s pretty crazy. Other than that, it’s not that weird. Because he was very lit in Chicago from the jump, from one of the first tapes. It’s like that now, just literally on the entirety of the earth. It’s still that same energy, just way more widespread. I’m going to his wedding in a couple weeks, it’s just cool. I’m grateful because his involvement in my s##t has definitely been a big help for me. I appreciate that. We really grew up together. I have memories of him before we made music. We went to elementary school together until 8th grade, then we went to different high schools. By then, I had already known him for a decade. That was my boy. AllHipHop: Where’s the wedding at? In Chicago? Alex Wiley: No, it’s out here actually. I don’t know if it matters I said that. I don’t know if they were trying to keep it a secret in some way. It’s going to be hella famous people there… AllHipHop: What’s the best piece of advice he’s given you? Alex Wiley: I was signed to an indie label in Chicago up until mid 2015. I split with them in a real public and nasty way. It was f##ked up for our whole scene in Chicago. It was impactful and divisive for a short amount of time. He was the first person that called me. He was touring crazy off of Acid Rap at the time, even out of the country for a long time. I hadn’t seen him in a minute. He called my phone like “dude I just got back. I saw the s##t, come to my studio session.” Literally the day after all the s##t blew up on Twitter, I was just sitting in his studio session, we were talking. He basically gave a lot of advice and support. Really, it was the support that I needed, because I really wasn’t sure how my standing in the scene was gonna be after that. That s##t was nasty. My whole place was uncertain.  He gave me my feature for “Navigator Truck” literally the next day after that. Basically just gave me the load of confidence like “bro, you should just be indie for a while. Just do it.” I was like “yeah cool. Bet, let’s do it.” I was going to do it anyway, but he was just there for me. I was going through some s##t that was very uncomfortable to me at the time. A lot of people reached out, it was very cool and humbling. I remember Action Bronson called my phone, Isaiah Rashad hit me up, a lot of cool people. Because that s##t was spilling on the internet in a nasty way. I had a f##king sold out show at SOB’s in New York and the same night, this s##t was happening. AllHipHop: 3 things you need in the studio? Alex Wiley: I don’t really need s##t. There’s things I want. I would like for there to be fresh fruit. That would be great and amazing. Fruit, weed and Backwoods. That would be delightful. Some smartwater. I got a little mini studio rider. It’s very mini. I rarely ever need meals in the studio unless we’re going to be there for a really long time. Which in that case, Postmates is my really good friend. Another thing that would be really great though is a TV with Planet Earth on mute. That’s cool to have. Incense is cool. Hella candles in the studio is a vibe. I think I’m the king of R&B by the way. [laughs] AllHipHop: I just linked with Jacquees! Alex Wiley: When I saw that whole debate, I was personally offended nobody threw my name into the ring. I was like “really? We all just going to… alright.” AllHipHop: Why do you think you’re the king of R&B? Can you clarify this for me? Alex Wiley: That’s one of those things: I shouldn’t even tell you about it, just listen. Check me out bro. Use your ears, and you tell me. While it is my opinion, that’s still only my opinion. But if you really are going to refute it, refute it with your ears. ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912203755.18/warc/CC-MAIN-20190325051359-20190325073359-00236.warc.gz

The 25 year Hip Hop veteran refers to ""CPR"" as the first track he ever created without his ego being the motivation.  Beyond dropping ""CPR"" and marching in the streets, Ali is further bringing awareness to reforming America's justice system by calling for new legislation on rules of police engagement. The Brooklyn-bred producer/emcee is also promoting cooperation with civil rights and community organizations to address the civic and social concerns underscored by the killing of Eric Garner, Michael Brown, and other unarmed minorities at the hands of law enforcement.  AllHipHop.com recently spoke with Ali Shaheed Muhammad. Part one of the exclusive interview covers the making of ""CPR"" and another major collaborative effort on the near horizon. “CPR” is a very powerful statement about what is taking place in the country right now. At what point did you decide you wanted to address those issues?  It was when the announcement was made that the grand jury in the case of Eric Garner against the police officer decided not to indict him. I think Ferguson was upsetting, and I instantly went out and protested then. The news of Eric Garner - it definitely was like somebody punched me in my gut and took all my wind out. Not only just the wind out of myself, but everything that my father, my mother, my grandparents, and all my ancestors fought for in this country.  To get to that kind of injustice, especially after there being clear proof that he was murder by law enforcement... I cried for maybe like 5 hours. At that point I stopped crying and it hit me - make a song. Make a song expressing how you’re feeling. How did you pull together the different artists on the track?  I’d been working with Merna. While that ruling was read, she and I had been writing a song together. I had to tell her, “Let me call you back and figure something out.”  Later that morning, when I had the idea of me doing something, I reached out to David Luke, one of the producers in my camp. I don’t know why I wanted his voice on there. I know that David is an emcee, but our working relationship is more as a producer.  He’s an incredible songwriter and beat maker, but I just had it in me to ask him to listen to this song to see if he would be part of it. David is a young father. He has a three-year-old son. I felt like he would understand. Just to get that young father’s voice - What’s the world going to be like for your child?  After that, I sent it to Merna. I didn’t instantly hear a singing part, but I just knew that Merna's music is in a sense of calling out a certain type of oppression. I felt like her spirit in what she and her people, the Palestinians, have gone through in being oppressed... I felt she would have something to say.  JaPoet is another artist that I work with, and someone that is slightly younger than I am. Knowing that he’s a prolific poet, I felt that he too would be able to add his emotion. I didn’t have anything specific I thought he could bring, but I just wanted him to put his Black male perspective on tape. You’re also selling t-shirts to raise proceeds for the Eric Garner Family Fund?  I made the song strictly from the perspective of ""I’m an artist,"" and I didn’t know what else to do outside of marching and lifting my voice. I didn’t want to sell the song. I just wanted to put it out. Then I also thought of the word “equality” while I was making the song. It’s a basic word. It’s what we all want from this situation, just to be treated as equal.  So I came up with this idea of “equality” as a shirt, and I thought it could be cool if something was done with it. Merna also said, “What about donating the proceeds to the Eric Garner family?” I said, “Yeah, that would be dope.” So I did it.  In addition to that, I wanted to do more than just give to the Eric Garner Family Fund. I wanted to put a word out there for people if they also want to do that. I think there are other organizations that we need to support to fight those legal battles. There’s the National Urban League, the NAACP, and the ACLU. I feel people should donate to these organizations, and if not money, then time. Use those resources to help battle these injustices. With the release of ""CPR,"" are you thinking about releasing a sophomore solo album?  I’ve been working on a solo record, so that’s something for my 2015. I’m doing a couple of things. There’s a record with Adrian Younge. He and I are working on an album together. That’s slated for early 2015. I’m working on my solo record for mid-2015.  It’s interesting. There’s nothing out there that sounds like what [Younge and I] are doing. It’s pretty exciting.  -  To purchase Ali Shaheed Muhammad’s ≠quáḽįty apparel visit here.

Oh and he said ""I'mma lean until I'm the king of New Orleans"". YUUUCK! Millions [Prod Southside, co-Produced by Kanye West] ""This that shit that y'all wanted/This shit cook up hard don't it/y'all gotta beg my pardon on it/But this sh*t sound like God, don't it?""  Pusha T’s fixation with God metaphors continues with the collaboration with an MC who made sure we understood he didn’t forgive even though God does. Very forgettable Rick Ross verse not ripe with his drug witty humor or visceral imagery that made songs like “I’m Not A Star” and “Yellow Diamonds” addictive. The chorus will break a few necks. Doesn’t Matter[Prod. Renegades] “Since y’all claim I’m Illuminati, tell me why would you try me/Kennedy/John F or Bobby/Almost caught Reagan too but they stopped us in the lobby/And that was broad day so how the fuck you going to stop me”  Syrupy French Montana glides in out of beat pockets awkwardly in his usual drugged flow. The subdued beat contrasts Pusha’s brash delivery nicely leaving open space for his words to shine through. Blocka[Prod. Young Chop] “Teamwork make the dream work/All my n*ggas done seen work/All my n*ggas ain’t make it through/So much death that my dreams hurt.”  Newest hip hop producer sensation, Young Chop laces the black Ric Flair with the minimalist heat rock for Pusha to speak his ghetto gospel. Pusha sounds extra hungry on this song (He doesn't have to sell...ok?!) and the reggae influence on the chorus (which interestingly permeates the majority of this tape) creates a banger.  Road Runnerfeat./ Troy Ave [Prod. Harry Fraud] ""Snub 38 with the Mac black trigger/When ""how can I be down?"" was filled with crack n*ggas""  Nothing against Troy Ave but his gravely voice does not help harmonizing on this chorus and actually made me think ""French Montana should be on this."" Short song, not much but a few slick street talk and typical recounting. Revolution [Prod. The Neptunes] “I was lost, I was jaded/Malice found his way to our Savior.""  Light keys tip-toe around a bare Neptunes beat until the blaring horns and light whirling strings. Pusha gives his a rather impressively succinct analysis of his career in the music business (business partner indicted for drugs, Malice finding God, So Appalled) and This just further proves that the majority of Pusha T songs should be handled by The Neptunes. Only You Can Tell Itfeat./ Wale [Prod. Boogz-N-Tape] “We aint hating, cause we aint y’all/Too much Ciroc(C. Rock) you seen be fore(CB4)”-Wale  After an onslaught of seemingly irreprehensible drug tales throughout this tape finally finds a sort of conscience. Pusha takes his time to give the human context of ""these drug dealing Picasso's."" Wale playfully contorts his flow around a bouncy Boogz-N-Tape beat. Trust You[Prod. SK & Arthur McArthur] ""I'm good money, got you talking in dollar signs/it's all good that she the top b*tch, but she just want to know the bottom line.""  Play this. Close you eyes. Watch a strip club appear in your mind. While Future was caught up in a real-life Maury episode, Pusha enlists Kevin Giles for a more than serviceable replacement. Pusha attempts to relinquish his abrasive flow for a more seductive tone as he talks to his stripper love interest, but it comes off as odd aggressive flirting. Take My Life[Prod. Jake-One] “It aint enough that I struggled through my career/Less appreciated when I was apart of a pair.""  With a simple trumpet, 808s and with a reggae-infused chorus, Pusha Ton waxes poetics about the haters(local n*ggas and the law) trying to alter the life he’s established, no matter how detrimental it can be. Jake One production has been unf*ckwittable for quite some time and Pusha does this joint justice. Liva- Re Up Gang Motivation[Prod. !llmind] “Polaroids being shown in every jail, every tier/Representing, all my niggas known I share..from the heart.”-Liva  Re-Up Gang veteran Liva (Formerly known as Ab-Liva) loses all parts of his mind on this hard-hitting !llmind production. Even his most simplest lyrics (""I am Heath Ledger Joker to you jokers"") comes off with enough conviction to bring this song to life. Great choice by Pusha T to let his Liva let loose. I Am Forgiven[Prod. B!nk] ""I asked forgiveness Lord/in hopes of getting more/Then beg forgiveness for the same thing he forgave me for.""  Hall of famer producer, B!nk laces Pusha T with an head-bop inducing with cymbal crashes, tight drums and a hypnotic vocal sample. Pusha's greatest skill is how conversational he can make his internal battles with the life he's chosen, his past and the Man upstairs.  Overall, Pusha T sums up the feel of this tape with one sentence found at the end of ""I Am Forgiven"": ""this is just an appetizer."" Wrath of Caine is plagued with repetitive subject matter and some questionable length choice, but Pusha's sheer charisma saves alot of those from a Recycle Bin fate. The bars are still there and potent as they have ever been in his 10 year+ career. If this is a precursor to his major label full length debut, My Name Is My Name then that album could potentially be the monster this mixtape scratches the surface of.

Throughout history  women, in particular, minority women have always been the backbone—the  support and the drivers of love, strength, and change in the world. It  has finally come to a point where the recognition of how exceptional  women are, is not only encouraged, but it is expected and demanded. AllHipHop enters Women’s  History Month with the #AHHPowerfulWomen Campaign to honor powerful women on the scene and behind the scene.  These women inspire and serve as trailblazing executives, lawyers,  publicists, and influencers impacting the  music, entertainment and hip-hop  industries. During the month, we will highlight different women daily on AllHipHop. Take a moment to think about  what makes someone powerful. This isn’t only a measure of physical  strength, or who is the loudest or has the highest executive position.  Those are only fractions in the total measure of power. Being powerful  is to be inspiring, to establish a reputation as a confident and  knowledgeable expert with the experience to guide others. Developing and  executing a plan, while understanding when to say “no.” A powerful  person respects their own power and has the ability to find and  accentuate the pieces of power and inspiration in others around them.  That is POWER, and that is what makes each and every woman so powerful! Join us to not only honor the successes these women have attained but  to also celebrate their fearlessness as women, mothers, wives, sisters,  daughters, and professionals!Happy Women’s History Month! -The AllHipHop Team ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202526.24/warc/CC-MAIN-20190321152638-20190321174638-00369.warc.gz
45,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/allhiphop-com-classics-hip-hop-reflects-on-9-11-2002-Zh6WApW-hEmb0dQUjjdvLQ/,"By: Grouchy Greg Watkins On September 11, 2001, masses of Americans witnessed firsthand aspects of a new sort of war unseen since World War II, but one year later the nation is reflecting on the attacks on New York City and Washington D.C. The attack on American soil, the first since Pearl Harbor and the worst ever, resulted in the creation of a worldwide coalition aimed at rooting out “terror,” alleged Anthrax attacks via the postal service, a war of biblical proportions in the Middle East, a faltering economy and yes, an impending war which seems to have the entire world divided. Most Americans seemed unaware of the anti-American fury that brewed overseas, or even more oblivious that it would be unleashed in such a deadly, destructive manner. “What’s so cold is that shit was totally unexpected – way outta the normal,” Scarface told AllHipHop.com. “It let me know anything can happen.” And for the past year, it seemed anything would happen. Bush named John Ridge director of Homeland Security, a new position to monitor possible terror attacks and issue warnings to the public. For the months after the attacks America, especially New York, was on high alert and as time passed, many were forced to return to their normal grind. Scarface continued saying, traveling didn’t make a difference to him and even revealed that he has a plan should terrorists attempt to hijack a plane while he is riding.   ""When I get on the plane I take two Sprite cans and two pillow cases. Now you can’t kill somebody who already wanna die, but you can administer some immense pain, he quipped. That’s where the soda cans come into play. Ima hit him with the pillow cases and soda cans and get some respect outta his ass.” Despite his valor, Face isn’t the norm. A recent survey showed 42 percent of people surveyed reported depression, 21 percent difficulty concentrating and 18 percent trouble sleeping. “The big thing in my life is flying,” Memphis vet 8Ball said. “Before that shit, I used to fly everywhere, two or three times a week and since that, I think Ive flown maybe four times. If Im able to take the bus where Im going, if its close enough, Im doing that first.” Similarly, Nelly also stopped flying after September 11th and tours the country by bus. And most people seem to be overcome by a sense of lingering anxiety. ""Im in New York now and I was here last year at the same time and it feels weird. I can’t make up my mind whether I feel safe or not because anything is possible,” Skillz of Rawkus Records said. “I always get nervous on the George Washington Bridge,” Kimora Lee Simmons said referring the New York City landmark that once offered a clear view of the Towers. Simmons acknowledged that she and her husband, Russell Simmons, no longer fly on public planes. “It’s expensive and not everyone can afford to do it, I realize that but it gives us a better peace of mind, so we do it when we can,” she said.  The Simmons’ were affected by the tragedies directly, losing their lavish penthouse on Liberty Street, which was right across from the World Trade Centers. “Yes, on September 11th we lost our house, which was worth millions,"" Kimora Lee said. ""That cannot possibly compare to the value of all of the innocent souls lost. When I think of what I lost on those terms, it’s extremely small.” “I go to sleep and I am horrified when my phone rings early,” California rapper Mystic concurred. “I don’t want someone to call me and say something awful has happened.” While Mystic admits to the anxiety that all of us feel in some form or another, whether it's flying on a plane, taking a train, riding over a bridge or through a tunnel, she said that the attacks didn’t change her over all attitude or change her work schedule. “I went out on tour within two weeks of the incident and there were very few other groups touring at the time,” she said. “It felt healing to acknowledge and to talk to people about what was going on.” For a short period, even battling rappers appeared to embrace each other, just at the attacks seemed to unite the country. Jay-Z, Hammer, Mystikal and Young M.C. tossed their weight behind the cause recording songs and freestyles addressing the attack. Canibus even recorded a record, “Draft Me,” supporting the war in Afghanistan. “I recorded that song because I was angry,” Canibus told AllHipHop.com. ""I truly felt like going to war.” Nevertheless, more than a year later, hip-hop is as divided as ever and things seem to have picked up in hip-hop right where they left off. “Ni##as don't mind, we been getting f##ked up, drunk and high this long, why not ride out like this?” Scarface asked. “We ain't did nothin since the civil rights. You can know what’s wrong, but what you gonna do to fix it? I gotta a lot of respect for a motherf##ker who is willing to die for what he believes in and no one here is.” The events of September 11th forever changed the way people viewed themselves and for most, served as an awakening to what was going on in the world around us. “The United States as a whole has been oppressing people and killing innocent people for a long, long time and these are facts. You can only beat someone down before they stand up and say ‘hell no,’ Mystic said. What some people are fighting for is much different than anything we know. We don’t understand what it’s like fighting to eat, fighting just to live.”  “I feel like our country does a lot of dirt that’s kept from the awareness of the American people. It jeopardizes the lives of many citizens when the victims of our own government do things to retaliate,” Kool G. Rap said previously to AllHipHop regarding Sept 11. “It’s a shame innocent people have to suffer for their [the governments] actions.” Kimora echoed the sentiments of G Rap and Scarface as well. We’re supposed to be one of the most powerful and we need to change our foreign policy because it’s affecting us,” she said. The actions of September 11th, 2001 proved one thing for certain – it made Americans feel vulnerable and human. A poll conducted last month said 73 percent of Americans felt another terrorist attack would take place on American soil at some point in the future. “Hell yeah, and when we least expect it,” Scarface said. “They not gonna strike right now, they waiting. They waited, what, 8 years to hit the Towers again?” “I think other things are gonna happen. Things will happen in forms we can't pull together in our minds right now,” Mystic said somberly. Conversely, Kimora was more optimistic.  ""I hope not, let’s pray nothing more happens. We need to figure out how we can improve these things and think about how it’s going to affect our children’s children. We have to bring about change.” “There are a lot of people who dont believe in voting to bring about change,” Mystic added. I have been voting since I was 18. You have to try. It’s f##ked up, especially with the elections of last year, you have to try.”  50 Cent summed his feelings up in one thought. “Nobody would care if planes hit the projects. I’m from the bottom so my feelings on 9-11 is ‘s##t happens,"" the Queens-bred rapper told AllHipHop.com. i still remember where i was that day  ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912201812.2/warc/CC-MAIN-20190318232014-20190319014014-00496.warc.gz

The Underground. We are back with our picks for the Top 50 Underground/Independent/Emerging artists of the year 2013  and we must say it was even harder to produce this year’s list than it  was last year. So many artists gave us a run for our money when it came  to trying to narrow the names down to only 50! As this past year we saw a  return to lyricism in a huge way which is a win for Hip Hop across the  board but made it harder for us to chose as a result! So trust us…this  list was very hard to do! We wish this was tee-ball where everyone could  get a trophy and we could take all our favorite rappers out for ice  cream afterwards but unfortunately it just doesn’t work that way…no  matter how much we may want it to. We really want to remind everyone that this list in no way discounts  or invalidates the hard work that artists have been putting in for the  past year. We know there are far more than 5o so we urge fans and  supporters to talk to us in the comments section and let us know who you  liked off our list and who you would love to see featured in 2014 that  we might have missed! With that said check out the AllHipHop.com picks for 2013 and remember they are in NO PARTICULAR ORDER!! We did NOT  put any sort of ranking to this thing…they are all equal in our eyes!  This is one of the few lists that did not go off of budgets, popularity  contests, numbers of likes/followers or flat out bribes! So enjoy! YC The Cynic We’ve been telling you guys for a few years now about YC…now finally  the “others” have caught on to him too! Once again an epic year was had  by young Mr. Cynic and his growth from album to album has been  phenomenal. In 2013 YC came in to his own with his “GNK” project and he  lyrically kicked doors in! 2013 found even Hot 97 playing him in their  rotation. We knew it was just a matter of time! So in 2014 just  remember…you probably saw him here first! Childish Gambino Okay so we know there will be heartburn for some about this pick but  that almost makes us like it more! Donald Glover aka Childish Gambino  can spit…and he’s clever….and the kid has punchlines and quotables for  days. So why wouldn’t we like him? Isn’t that what it’s all about? With  that said the project he released in the late fall made us smile…and  this underdog proved to us it ain’t a gimmick with him! He says it like  he means it and it’s good! Roc Marciano Surprisingly one of the most slept on artists of the year! Seemed  like almost everywhere we went we heard rumblings of how much fans were  enjoying the new projects put out by Roc Marciano this fall but the fan  fare was no where near what we thought it would be from the media  considering what solid work he put forth. All we know for sure is we dug  it and we know a whole lot of others did as well. This is another  example of how important it is to make your voice heard when you enjoy  something as a fan. It’s more important to troll sites to speak about  what you do like rather than what you don’t! Everyone should have been  on this one this year…we’re just saying! Final Outlaw Unapologetic and in your face Final Outlaw released a lyrical beast  of a project in 2013 and didn’t ask for any fan fare at all. He  metaphorically spit his face off and its dopeness was appreciated… so it  found its way through the underground and beyond. If that ain’t Hip Hop  then we aren’t sure what is! In the tradition of EPMD he skipped the  ‘“Crossover” games and just did good work. Black Milk One of the most underrated projects of 2013 belonged to Black Milk.  The rhymer was not afraid to get open with his latest project “ No  Poison No Paradise” and we for one were grateful! Talk about a year full  of impact! Black Milk killed it from the music to the stage and  everywhere in between. Big Pooh Big Pooh was back in 2013 in a big way. We’ve known of his diligence  and hard work for years and he never lets us down lyrically. But it’s  his solo work apart from Little Brother that lands him on our list. His  Fat Boy Fresh series was just that…fresh! And we can’t wait to see what  Big Pooh has in store for 2014! Senica Da Misfit Senica Da Misfit finally made his presence felt on the performance  tip this year and rocked stages everywhere from popular Hip Hop  festivals to accredited Hip Hop conferences. But  the show he put  forward with a Grammy award winning band on the “Wake Up Show Unplugged”  with King Tech, Sway and DJ Revolution was by far his dopest of the  year! And that is saying a whole lot! We are anxious to see what he puts  forth in the new year. Soul Khan What can we say…this guy is nothing if not consistent. Project after  project dropped this year with Soul Khan as either the lead or as the  feature and he murderlized verse after verse. Just when you think he  couldn’t possibly be any more clever you get a new song from Soul Khan  proving you wrong and this year was zero exception. One Dae Another battle rap kid makes our list for 2013. One Dae is reppin for  Planet Brooklyn and showing us that you don’t have to be in the heat of  battle to make an impact. He’s clever and witty just  as any good  battle emcee should be but it’s more than that. His voice is seasoned  and confident and as a result we’re appreciative of the rhymes he put  forth this past year. Psalm One This chica once again used her powers for good not just within her  music but also within her community. When you support a Psalm One  project you are literally supporting the kids as she is another one of  those artists that walks the walk by giving back to the kids of the Hip  Hop world. She spit her heart out in 2013 but allowed herself to retain a  little bit of energy…only so that she could go back and teach the next  generation of spitters, producers and directors how to do the same. This  Rhymesayer is one of a kind in her voice, flow, delivery and love for  the culture! And we are all better off for it! Rasheed Chappell In 2013 this New Jersey spitter brought intelligence to the table and  the people ate well as a result. His creative way of delivering a  thought provoking rhyme coupled well with his energetic stage show and  Rasheed reminded the listeners why they ever started paying attention to  him in the first place. He was consistent and steady…each song was good  whether he was the headliner or just featured on a track. He gave the  people what they wanted from…dope music without gimmicks…who in the  world could ask for more. Loaded Lux We only need one word for this guy…BELOVED! Making the crossover from  battle emcee to solo artist is never easy and very few have done it  successfully. This year Loaded Lux made strides toward doing just that  and upon releasing a song that stayed a virtual mantra for us over the  summer months we decided that maybe he was right…maybe we are gonna get  this work! We’re excited to see where things go for him in 2014! Tanya Morgan Von Pea and Donwill make up the Duo Tanya Morgan and they blew us  away with their “Rubber Souls” album in 2013. It was eclectic lyricism  at it’s very finest and we’re starting to believe these two have figured  out the formula. Their efforts this year were definitely celebration  worthy and we’re glad we weren’t the only ones who noticed! Rebel Diaz This duo is definitely putting the Rebel in Diaz and the two are  proving through their actions as well as their verses that they stand  for something. In fact in 2013 they triple dog dared their listeners to  fall for anything. Their music is demonstrative of this and as with the  proud traditions of Public Enemy and KRS before them…they’re teaching  all those within ear shot of the troubles that plague the Hip Hop  culture and society at large. They rocked stages and and dropped music  all year long and we for one were thankful for their voices and their  services in 2013. KENO Sacramento spitter KENO put out an eardrum friendly project in the  way of an album called “The 1derful” and it was nothing short of the  laid back wonderfulness that we have come to expect from the Cali  rapper. Down with the TUS crew KENO found his very own voice this year  and it was certainly praise worthy…so we’re praising it! RoQy TyRaiD We’ve been talking about RoQy TyRaid for a few years now and for very  good reason! In fact we take credit for breaking him on a national  level! This kid showed off in front of King Tech, Sway and DJ Revolution  at the “Wake Up Show Unplugged” and trust us when we say he left  everyone gasping for air by the time he was done spitting. RoQy unloaded  a murderous barrage of nouns and verbs on the mic so severely that even  Talib Kweli would have to say, “Wow fam take a breath between all those  words!” if he ever heard it! RoQy TyRaiD truly killed it this year! Joey Bada$$  Joey Bada$$ impressed us this year in ways that are almost  indescribable. He was one of the first to reach back for the elder  statesmen of Hip Hop and ask for guidance and that was just about  everything to us! To now witness a new phenomenon of young artists  teaming up with older mentors and running the Hip Hop tables with their  collaborations is so much more than we ever even hoped to ask for! In  2013 Mr. Bada$$ set the tone for his fellow artists and ever since it’s  been happening all over the Hip Hop community. The results for Joey were  hot tracks and a bright future! We’re anxious to see what he does in  2014! Natural Boston rapper Natural is a spitter that took things to a totally  different level in 2013. He put out a cohesive project that took on the  topic of the Boston bombings in a very endearing way. But don’t get us  wrong…he rapped about light hearted topics too and entertained listeners  all the while. We’re glad that we stumbled upon this artist over the  course of the year as there was clearly a whole lot worth finding out  about. Our eyes will stay open for his movements in 2014. Silent Knight This New Jersey son had a great year in 2013 as he rocked both stages  and the booth with force! Silent Knight went from a featured favorite  to a stand out seemingly over night and we are not the only ones who  noticed his growth this year! We’ve been talking about this guy and his  lyrical adeptness for a few years now and we’re anxious to see where he  is able to take things in the new year! Mitch Littlez Mitch Littlez (the “Dominican Duke” as we call him) is an emcee  straight out of Harlem. The guy is as lyrical as he is clever and twice  as dope with the flow. Mitch easily grabs the attention of the room with  the abundance of energy that surrounds his performances. Like a panther  approaching his prey, he’s cagey and calculated with the punchlines and  you know by the look in his eyes when he’s about to attack the verse!  We are convinced that 2014 is going to showcase his talents even further  and we can’t wait! MoRuf This artist gets heavy praise everywhere he goes and being compared  to the likes of 3 Stacks does not exactly suck! The rapper put out an  album that set the tone for 2014 with his “Shades.Of.Moo” project which  dropped in the late fall and Outkast fans are seemingly gravitating  toward it…nice right? We are pretty eager to see where he takes it in  the new year! Rocky Rivera A favorite from the Bay area, Rocky Rivera once again owned the year  through both solo projects and collaborations. But this shocks no one as  it’s something that most have come to expect of her. She’s lyrical,  verbal, intelligent and she can a punish a beat as well as any of the  guys surrounding her! In fact, hearing her brutalize a song is what is  now the norm…and it’s just how we like it! The Audible Doctor As one of the most sought after up and coming lyricist/producers in  New York City at the moment, this kid is shaking the underground scene  by the shoulders and awaking the masses to his abilities in a major way.  The Audible Doctor is versatile and his rhyme schemes and flows are the  cross-roads where verbal adeptness and cleverness meet.  But what  impressed us the most with him this year was how far he was willing to  go when he wanted to be a part of King Tech and Sway’s Unplugged  project. He was suffering from an awful case of the flu and could hardly  speak at all…but the guy sucked it up, got on a plane, traveled across  the country and spit his verse anyway! JohnNY UniteUs It was a great year for JohnNY UniteUs indeed! In 2o13 the Brooklyn  spitter dropped a new project and got back out to crowds in a big way.  When you throw in a JohnNY U song you’re going to enjoy yourself. His  delivery is smooth no matter how jaggad the verse and it’s head bob  worthy music that keeps one hitting repeat and looking for more. We  can’t wait to see where he goes in ’14! SonReal Canada’s son SonReal brought it yet again this year with more of the  head bobbing, smile inducing goodness that we wish more artists would  find their way toward. His lighthearted way of tackling a beat is  impressive as he is slowly becoming one of the hottest storytellers out  here. Sure there are plenty who do it but he does it well! Over the last  few years we’ve watched this guy grow and we’re positive that he’s  solidifying his position in this game. To be honest we’re not sure why  more American artists aren’t looking at him for features and why  American media have yet to catch on…all we know is that we’ve been  paying attention for some time now! Blax Midwestern rhymer Blax had one heck of third quarter this year with a  new LP entitled “Everyday” which featured a song for everyday of the  week. Clever, witty and head nod worthy are but a few words we heard  used to describe the project and we agreed wholeheartedly. We’ve been  watching this artist for a few years now and we’re consistently  impressed with what he puts out. 2013 was just another example of  another solid project from Blax. Jasiri X He’s not only lyrical he’s a beast when it comes to savagely  attacking truth and throwing it in the face of power through verse!  Jasiri has become a real life revolutionary in the Hip Hop game and in  the Hip Hop culture at large.  His spit game is beyond ridiculous and  his ability to hit up everyone’s collective truths in a verse while  somehow personalizing the message for each individual listener  simultaneously is a talent that has been seen rarely since the days of  Chuck D and KRS. Chaundon Charming and cocky as ever, Chaudon was back to explain to all who  listened why he is one of the dopest to pick up a mic and few disagreed  with him. In 2013 he continued to master the art of combining smart  assery with hard hitting, gritty lyrics so that just as the listener  began to smile at something he said… that smile was immediately wiped  away by a somber thought in the next line of the verse. To put it simply  Chaundon did a hell of a job illustrating pictures through words in  2013. Charmingly Ghetto Charmingly Ghetto is much more than a wild name! In 2013 he lyrically  choked out beats and used his own unique knack for spitting complete  thoughts across a track to reel in new fans everywhere. The Boston  spitter took to the booth and used a mic as his weapon of choice. The  result was a project full of metaphorically murdered nouns and  verbs..yeah…he did that! And it was not to be undone! We’re looking  forward to seeing what he delivers in 2014! The Narcicyst Never one to be still, The Narcicyst was still dropping the dopest of  gems in 2013. Whether referencing political actions or hazelnut  spreads, Narci delivered his brand of Hip Hop his way. The Canadian  spitter gave us what we have become accustomed to with him…dope flows  and rhymes set to dope beats. In essence he gave his listeners a  complete verse every time he stepped to the mic. How is it that this man  hasn’t become a bigger name in the US? It truly boggles the mind! Bodega Brovas We’ve dubbed them the “Beastie Boys Of The New Millennium” and not  for nothin! The Bodega Brovas are complete energy on stage and on wax  and they show in every performance why they deserve to be some of the  next to blow. Their act is pure polish and they are some of the last  showman in the genera. The Brovas are clever, lyrical and able to fill  the void that has been missing with Hip Hop groups for quite a while  now. Dee-1 This guy did something this year that made us proud…he signed to RCA  Inspirational! Dee-1 is a shining example of what can happen if you stay  true to yourself as an artist and refuse to give up your creativity for  a few short lived dollars! People told him he had to change…and that he  was either doing too much or not enough throughout his journey but he  held to his beliefs and continued to impress the fans as well as the  media with dope projects done his own way…and by the end of this year he  had an announcement to make to his followers that would literally  change the game! Dee-1 reminds us all that there is still good left to  do in this world and through his rhymes and his actions he is showing us  all how we can go forward and do it! Reks Recks jumped out of the box once again in 2013 and this time he spoke  on his country and the way he felt it ought to be versus the way it is.  While there are plenty of artists that get political with it, Reks  showed up in a big way with his song flags and got people to discuss  things that were very far out of certain comfort zones. If we remember  correctly…before the bling..the brods and the benzes became the norm in  every rap song…speaking on one’s surroundings, beliefs and ideas for  solutions used to be what Hip Hop was about or at least in part. So  agree or disagree with Reks but salute him for his willingness to stand  up and speak out…because that is in fact..Hip Hop. Torae No shock for us that Torae once again knocked it out of the park with  “For The Record” in 2013. He lived up to what one would expect from a  Torae offering with several cuts that were catchy to the point that you  couldn’t get them out of your head for awhile after hearing them…if that  isn’t high praise then we really aren’t sure what is! As one of the  most consistent emcee’s out here Torae made sure that whether he was on  stage, on radio, hosting a live show or in the booth that his presence  was going to be felt someway somehow and it was! Gilligan Gatsby In 2013 Gil Gatsby came through the door, grabbed the mic and had his  way with both his flow and the music. His voice was more than deep…it  was commanding and by the time he finished spitting he convinced us all  that it was more than a dope tone of voice that got him there…simply put  the boy spits gems! Double threat! His new project is going to set him  up nicely for 2014…there’s no doubt in our minds! Yamin Semali Yamin Semali is a complex, verbal, cerebral spitter that does  something on the mic that many have either forgotten how to do or have  simply just disregarded as a responsibility of their platforms  altogether…what is that thing you ask? Well simply put…the guy  entertains through his music. Not in a buffoonish sort of way but yet in  such a way that you want to hear what he is spittin about. He is what  we used to call a complete entertainer….and we’re glad that we caught on  to him as an emcee…no matter how late we might be to the party. 2013  saw dope collaborations on his project “Senior Dues” and our curiosity  is piqued by him for 2014. Wildelux Coming to us from Japan by way of NYC Wildelux has proven that  sometimes just getting out of your own area code is the answer to  succeeding in this rap game. 2013 was a heck of a year for Will as he  continued to rock stages and speakers worldwide. No stranger to the  industry and it’s ills this spitter kept honesty as the star of his  rhymes this year and for that we found respect. Oddissee Those who know Oddissee’s work don’t really even need to be told why  we continue to dig this guy’s projects…they know! But for those who  still haven’t gotten hip to him…we’re all wondering what you’re waiting  on! Oddissee put out yet another complete body of work in 2013….clever,  smart, witty, intricate and amazing are but a few words to  describe “Tangible Dream.”  If you haven’t heard him before… now would  be a great time to see what all the fuss is about. He’s inspired and it  was clear in 2013! Loch The ATL stood up proudly with this artist and for good reason… he put  out good product in 2013. Loch released “Afro American Horror Story”  which was a very dope blend of gritty down South beats and an almost  northern sounding rhyme scheme and delivery. Loch almost single handedly  proved that everyone can in fact all play nicely together on the  metaphorical playground that is this Hip Hop ish. Action Bronson This guy was everywhere in 2013! We saw him lyrically destroy stages  to the point that headliners didn’t even want to follow his show! Action  Bronson took listeners by storm and made his presence felt in the  realest of real ways and when they tried to diss New York Hip Hop he was  one of the very first artists that sprang to mind to contradict the  argument…now that says a lot! Luke Christopher Luke Christopher is another artist that just recently signed to RCA  and not for nothing because the young man has bars. But it’s more than  that….there is something soulful to his music that leaves you feeling  relaxed upon hearing it. It’s got that feel good Cali vibe as well as a  throwback quality that makes you want to hit repeat a time or two once  the tracks end. He may be young but he feels familiar to the listener  and that is a good thing…a very good thing. Chris Young Chris Young’s mic skills took us by surprise in 2013. Don’t let his  smile fool you into thinking there isn’t poison about to be spit from  his lips! This kid is unassuming but when he grabs a microphone it’s  curtains on the kindness as he is about to murder every lyric in the  song. His abilities to spit his truths and to share his story are  nothing short of genuine gifts and every verse is Christmas! Blu Los Angeles artist Blu was a beast on stages in 2013 as well as in  booths. He featured and collabed all over the place and his smooth  delivery and word play gave audiences permission to just sit back and  enjoy the ride that any of his music took you on. It’s easy to like this  artist and hard to find fault with the complete works that he puts out.  He makes moves with very little fanfare and we appreciate him for that  even more. He does it for the love and not just for the hand claps and  gestures….how can you not love it! Alage Boston’s son was still steadfast on his mission of love toward his  city in 2013. Lage continued to shed light on Boston’s Hip Hop scene and  their rich history through his rhymes and the videos that he put out.  This artist is yet another example of growth from last year and we are  happy to say we saw him early on. He exudes something that is lacking in  a lot of the music that we’ve been receiving lately and that’s passion.  Alage could probably get over on his verbal ability alone…but he goes  the extra mile to educate the listener about his surroundings which is a  bonus. We hope Boston realizes what they have with this kid! Brown Bag AllStars Here we go again with this talented group of four that drop music  seemingly every darn day! Okay that may be exaggerating a little bit  (But honestly not by much) and the difference between other artists that  drop as much music as they do and them is…pretty much all of their  music has been extra dope and 2013 was no exception! We don’t know how  they continue to come up with all the bars that they do…we’re just glad  they are still motivated to grab mics and have their way with  beats…consistently! We don’t know what 2014 holds for these guys but one  thing we’re pretty sure of is this…we need to get bigger email inboxes  to hold all the work we’re sure to get from them…and we ain’t mad about  it! R-Mean R-mean‘s rhyme scheme is the very definition of the kind of laid  back, super chill, California Hip Hop that we find ourselves in need of.  In 2013 R-mean brought us that head bobbing, feel good type of vibe and  delivery that people crave from LA artists and it was dope! However,  our favorite part of his story is that even though he is from LA he grew  up overseas! Again we love stories like that! His influences are vast  and it’s completely apparent in his rhymes. Playdough This year reminded us of why we liked Playdough in the first  place…Simply put…he’s clever and silly and it’s just crazy stuff to  listen to without feeling like you’re losing brain cells for doing so.  He’s been creating his own lane for awhile now and that lane is getting  bigger as time goes on. Playdough incorporates that dirty Dallas vibe  with lyrical ability and it’s often the perfect marriage of humor,  adeptness, timing and delivery that allows us to bob our heads and laugh  with Playdough instead of at him. In 2013 we saw him take over  unassuming crowds time and again from festivals to conferences as well  as his own shows and it was an awesome sight to see. Political Animals This Hip Hop band out of CT gave crowds the business in 2013 and we  were happy to have caught them more than a few times on stages  throughout the year. Their sound is not pre-fab manufactured beats but  live music and it’s a really cool, bob your head type of vibe that  anyone in earshot can truly appreciate. Score one for the musicians this  year as these kids reminded us what this music thing must remain to be  about. It made us want to go support our local public school’s music  programs in fact….because we need to continue to show love for real  instruments as well as the computerized variety.  David Dallas The kid coming straight out of New Zealand brought Hip Hop in ways  that shocked the Hip Hop realm in 2013! We keep trying to tell people  that some of the biggest Hip Hop heads are far away from the United  States! Welp in that same spirit, some of the dopest emcee’s are not  from the US either! This spitter is a very good case of that principle!  The funny thing is we didn’t tell you he was from a country outside of  the US many wouldn’t have even known. David Dallas made huge moves in  the last twelve months and our guess is this is just the beginning!  We’ll definitely continue to watch him in the next year!

Recently, Nicki shouted out AllHipHop when she defended claims that she was not supportive of other female emcees in an interview with Genius.  To her credit, Nicki told no lies when she included Foxy Brown, Remy Ma, Lauryn Hill and even her historical nemesis Lil Kim. Truthfully, we haven't talked to Nicki much since that time, but to further keep it 100, we figured it was only fair to re-publish this infamous interview that has gotten new life. Check out Nicki Minaj's Top 5 Dead or Alive exactly  as it appeared on AllHipHop in 2009. April 15, 2009 ByMarisa Mendez The hip-hop industry has had quite a drought in estrogen as of late. Remy Martin is locked up, Foxy Brown has had her fair share of issues, Eve crossed over into acting and never came back, and Kim is busy dancin' with the stars. But Southside Jamaica, Queens looks like it has a cloudy forecast, and just may be providing us with the rain to end the drought.in the form of Young Money Entertainment's Nicki Minaj. At 23, this female emcee already holds the coveted ""first lady"" position on the label of one of the music industry's biggest stars, Lil Wayne. So what's all the hype about? Minaj has been honing her skills for years. An alumnus of the famous performing arts high school of FAME notoriety, Nicki is actually not only a skilled rapper, but trained in writing, acting and singing as well. Lending vocals to local acts in her Queens neighborhood garnered the attention of popular DVD magazine The Come Up, providing Nicki with the now infamous segment that caught Lil Wayne's attention. He quickly courted her to be the only female representer of his Young Money imprint in 2007, and two whirl-wind years later, nearly every record company now has a bid in to this femcee. With a brand new mixtape, Beam Me Up Scotty, just released, a successful run on Wayne's I AM Music tour under her belt, and two critically acclaimed mixtapes, Playtime is Over and Sucka Free in the bag is it safe to say Nicki Minaj is hip-hop's next big thing? You decide. And while you do, you can read the influences behind the raptress that has the industry buzzing. Lil Wayne His creativity is I just think really unmatched. I think his ability to stand out in a crowd is unmatched. And I think that he's one of the only people that still have fun. You know Wayne can say the hottest lines but he's still having fun with those lines. He'll make you laugh; he can make you angry wit his raps, he can make you cry. But he's very versatile I feel. He does the singing and all that stuff and he's the only one that's not afraid to venture out and try new things. I think that's dope. Jay-Z His swag. I dont think anyone in the WORLD has more swag than Jay. He also is another one that I felt is really, really creative. But I think with Jay he kind of always played his role. Never tried to be someone else, never tried to do anything else but just be Jay-Z and it works really well for him. His lyrics are incredible and you know I think he did a great job to put New York on the map. Jadakiss I think Jadakiss is the most consistent with punchlines. And me being an underground rapper, I feel it's very important to kind of have everybody going ooh! You know every other line when you listen to a Jadakiss rap you're going to be like ""ooh did he just say that?"" You know, he knows how smart he is with his raps and I think he's a good indicator that rappers are very intelligent people. Just putting poetry to music and making it happen. Lauryn Hill I think Lauryn Hill is like a goddess. I love her. She was the first person that did the rap/singing thing and everything was so authentic. When you listen to her sing you don't feel like this is a rapper trying to sing or when you listen to her rap you don't feel like it's a singer trying to rap. She just does her thing and she's always so knowledgeable and eye opening with her lyrics that you got to give it to Lauryn. Remy Martin, Foxy Brown and Lil Kim Remy, Foxy and Kim are tied for the 5th slot. Remy’s just a beast, Foxy has impeccable timing and a delivery to die for, Kim is the pioneer for my generation. She’s the trend setter. She’s the Queen Bee. THE SIDEBAR Nicki explains why she should be considered for the Top 5 Dead or Alive: Then there's a very special newcomer who I really think has been slept on but you know what? I really think this person is about to take the game by storm. This person has the swag, they have the punchlines, they have the fun aspect. They have the dope girl sound, the dope girl feel. Women love her, dudes love her. We got to give it up to Nicki Minaj! She talks about what sort of deal she is looking for and the bidding war around her: In regards to me being signed, let me just say thanks to all the record companies that have approached us with record deals. Just about everybody has placed their bids. But we have to do this special. I think its going to be a big statement, you know, for a black woman to get a catastrophic deal right now. I think we really need to put females back on the map. Females have been settling for horrible deals for so long and it's a lose/lose situation because when they give you a horrible deal with no marketing budget and you have no way to promote yourself, you're going to fail. So with the Nicki Minaj project, they have to step it up. They have to come big and we're not doing anything if it's less than big.

51,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/aquaman-the-non-spoiler-allhiphop-review-nYrlvdePpEWoY-tHS2dMYA/,"(AllHipHop Features) Aquaman is an action packed adventure film that is seriously epic in scope and scale. The opus is a self-contained movie in the DCEU (DC Extended Universe) with a simple and effective three-act story structure, but was a really good origin story for Arthur Curry, the aquatic hero's real name. Jason Momoa is excellent as the wild, half Hawaiian, beer guzzling Aquaman and all of the supporting cast nail their roles as well. As villains, Orm Marius aka The Ocean Master (Patrick Wilson) and Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) have understandable motivation for why they do what they do but are still savages. Director James Wan brings his A-Game here: From his storytelling, to the kinetic action sequences, even down to his horror sensibilities being on full display. Wan's action set pieces are extremely creative and, for most of them, he uses long, one take, tracking shots that are all stylish and fluid. The direction, cinematography and fight choreography are all on point - really smooth work here. From a technical aspect, the CGI, VFX, colors and underwater sequences are all amazing and beautiful to experience. It's truly a visual spectacle! Critically, the biggest issue I had is that in the 2nd act, the tone momentarily shifts to a comedic/campy vibe where some of the dialogue and jokes are hit and miss. But fortunately, this is brief and the tone quickly shifts back into action/adventure mode which is where the movie shines best. There were also some musical choices in that same 2nd act I could have done without as I would have preferred the actual score be used throughout. Lastly, I wanted more Black Manta in the movie, because he was extremely dope. He'll definitely be back. This film is a comic book sci-fi/fantasy/adventure movie in the vein of the Star Wars, Lord of the Rings and Indiana Jones films and it really works! At nearly 2.5 hours, it’s a massive film that has action, humor, thrills, and fun. It also has some of the best visual effects of the year, in my humble opinion. Comic book fans can love and appreciate it, but it's also a film that can be enjoyed as as a family. Highly Recommended - Go see it!

Today's installment of ""Ask Ash Cash"" comes from Ms. Laura Goldstein... But, as I said last week, I also want to hear from you. If you have any business or finance questions, please tweet me (@IamAshCash) using #AskAshCash, or e-mail me your video or question to Questions@AskAshCash.com. I also stream live every Monday at 9PM on Wave45.tv!! Dear Ash Cash: What are some things to be careful about when using my credit card?  There are many things that you should consider when using your credit card, but the two most important are: 1) Keeping your usage down and 2) Watching out for interest rate increases.  It is important to know that you should not be using your credit card to make everyday purchases for items like food, clothing, and gas. Credit cards should be used for emergency purposes only; using your credit card as a substitute for cash can put you into serious debt before you even know it. With that said, make sure you stay within 30% of your credit limit to avoid damage to your credit score.  Your credit score is broken down into five (5) categories... 35% is Your Payment History, 30% is your Usage, 15% is the Length of your Credit History, 10% is your New Credit, and 10% is your Credit Mix... With Usage being a large part of your credit score, make sure you are keeping your balances low to help keep your score high!!  Lastly, pay attention to your interest rate, and make sure it hasn't increased. Your credit card's interest rate can increase when you've defaulted on the original credit card terms. For example, you were late on a payment, went over the credit limit, or bounced the check for your payment.

54,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/atlriseup-earthgang-is-crafting-authentic-music-refreshing-atlanta-s-hip-hop-sound-n9K_c6z3PkefqW1NW19-xQ/,"Two decades later, there is a new duo grabbing that baton handed off by ATL icons OutKast and Goodie Mob. While they may not acknowledge it, EarthGang is helping to restructure the musical foundation of their hometown.  Johnny Venus and Doctur Dot have constructed a discography that combines alternative soundbeds, socially aware lyrics, and an authentic Atlanta aura. Even with a vibe that leans more towards perceptive thinking and emotional connection, Venus and Dot do not embrace the “conscious” or “gospel rap” stamp. “That whole conscious thing is the elephant in the room. When you label something ‘conscious,’ it gets a label that I don’t necessarily want,” Dot relays to AllHipHop.com. “Does that mean I’m not a conscious human being? I don’t know who is and who isn’t. I know our music is based on authenticity more than anything. We call it ‘authentic.’ You can call it ‘real.’ But ‘conscious’ is just a word that's become almost taboo at this point. So why even say it at all?” Venus adds, “Nobody’s really trying to listen to Gospel rap. It can be entertaining like Lecrae, but if it’s boring nobody wants to hear that sh*t. You have to entertain while you’re bringing your message. A lot of times, entertainment is done by exaggeration, hyperbole, jokes, and saying wild sh*t.” During their 9th grade year at Benjamin E. Mays High School, the two Southwest Atlanta natives united under the goal of providing edutainment. The story goes Venus and Dot met while on a field trip. When they arrived back at school, the building was ablaze. Much like the prophecies of the Red Priestess Melisandre from Game Of Thrones, the fire was seen as a sign the future would be bright for the pair. “At that moment, we said this is something special, this is something crazy. We started kicking it hard after that,"" states Venus. “We had similar interests as far as music and learning. We could teach each other about music and other sh*t.” That initial meet led to several classmates interested in rapping coming together under the name EarthGang. Over time other members parted ways until eventually Venus and Dot decided to go at it as a twosome.  The emcees even stayed together as a group when they enrolled at Hampton University in Virginia. Venus studied graphic design, and Dot studied psychology. But music was still near the forefront of their personal pursuits.  Positive reaction to tracks uploaded to the net provided a push toward the Hip Hop route permanently. Friends and family began sharing those early EarthGang tunes on Facebook which made the tandem take a serious approach to being music artists.  “The internet makes it a more professional thing than you actually are. We put stuff up on the internet, and it started to get traction,” recalls Dot. “So it was like, ‘I guess we’re in it now.’ We were just putting it out to share our art.” By 2011, EarthGang had dropped the projects The Better Party EP, Mad Men, and Good News. Then 2014 included their breakout album Shallow Graves For Toys released via Spillage Village Records.  SV is a collective of Atlanta/Baltimore acts that united during their college days. EarthGang, J.I.D., Jordxn Bryant, and Hollywood JB also joined forces for the Bears Like This and Bears Like This Too compilations. “Spillage Village was generated out of a community that comes from being artists who ain’t got sh*t. We were all using each other’s studio time,” Dot explains. “We were always around each other anyway and helping each other. So it was Why don’t we take it to the next level?Why don’t we call ourselves something? It was something between the n*ggas that started to take on a brand of its own.” A faction of like-minded funk/soul influenced Hip Hop artists based in the southwest section of Atlanta sounds very similar to the aforementioned Dungeon Family. Goodie Mob once walked the same Mays High School hallways as Dot and Venus as well. So the inevitable Spillage Village/Dungeon Family and EarthGang/OutKast correlations were sure to come.  “Some people give that as a lazy comparison without going through the music. It’s two cats from Atlanta who really got some content, so we’re going to put them in the OutKast lane,” responds Venus. “On the flip side of that, it’s still cool when your name is brought up - not on the same level - in relation to people that have done so many things. It’s motivating and ensures you’re on the right path. It’s not a glass ceiling. That’s not how I see it.”  EarthGang have no problem naming OutKast's Big Boi and Andre 3000 as rhymers they listened to growing up. Venus lists Bone Crusher and Lil Jon as performers he followed as a youth. Dot refers to T.I. and Baby D as middle school favorites.  Yet as self-described “kids of the LimeWire Age,” Venus and Dot had the opportunity to be exposed to music beyond what local radio and mainstream TV outlets fed to the public. That counterculture openness and individuality created by the internet saturated into the brand and mindset of EarthGang as well as the art they present. “What n*ggas don’t realize, Hip Hop is West African transformational storytelling that we brought over here. We don’t get a chance to tell our stories in the media,” says Venus. “When we do our storytelling - when we say what we say - it’s our authentic experience. It’s all the experiences of Black people."" He continued, ""It’s an education message, because people don’t know themselves. That's why when people hear Hip Hop, they appreciate the real, the truth. As an educational tool, it’s passing down information in the context of how we’re living as a people.” Unfortunately, that message still involves addressing the issue of race in America. EarthGang had the opportunity to travel the nation as part of separate tours with Ab-Soul and Fashawn. Their experiences on the road included reminders that some citizens of this country still have an issue with young, Black males simply because of the color of their skin. “One time we got kicked out of a hotel for smoking weed. We smoked zero weed. We didn’t even pull the sh*t out in the hotel,” conveys Dot. “We were in Kansas City, Kansas. We went right across the bridge that same day to Kansas City, Missouri. Not only was the staff a different shade of people, they were very hospitable. We got our first taste of that.” Both rappers mention similar incidents in other states. One unwarranted police stop happened outside the same city where Caucasian software developer Michael Dunn murdered 17-year-old African-American Jordan Davis over playing rap music too loud. “We were driving to Jacksonville on the Ab-Soul tour. One of the service vehicles - not highway patrol - pulled us over. He was an off duty officer. He told us, ‘You’re going too fast. That’s how people end up getting shot down here,’” states Venus. “He didn’t give us a ticket, because he was off duty. He didn’t have the jurisdiction to do any of this stuff. He low-key threatened us. That sh*t is commonplace.” Like Bob Marley, Nina Simone, Marvin Gaye, and Lauryn Hill before them, EarthGang use their art to shine a light on the political and social concerns of the greater society. Songs such as “New Malcolm X” and “Mojo” are rhythmic presentations equivalent to HBCU poli-sci lectures. Doctur Dot and Johnny Venus are set to continue their authentic entertainment instruction with the forthcoming Strays With Rabies album. The project features production by DJ Khalil, J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League, Mike Will Made It's Eardrummers, and the Dungeon Family’s Organized Noize. The latter two beat making teams suggest the LP will contain some of the diverse styles radiating from the ATL.  Could Strays represent the intersection between Organized Noize’s Southernplayalistic sound and Mike Will Made It’s Trap tendencies? Listeners will have to wait until EarthGang’s latest work hits stores to find out, but the Georgia boys definitely recognize a common bond with their street-centered A-Town counterparts. Venus declares, “We’re not seen as the Trap guys from Atlanta, but we go through the same things that they go through. Same day, same city, same troubles.” Read other installments of AllHipHop’s #ATLRiseUp series here. To purchase tickets to Mac Miller’s “The GO:OD AM Tour” featuring EarthGang visit haveagoodam.com.

This project is far from it, but harkens to the worldly views of Kanye West as Yeezus. Also known as “JUICE”,JuiceMan, or Young JUGO, the South Bronx native has taken off in full force in the game after years in the Hip-Hop underground scene. To some, he is already stamped as a future King and a notable to look out for before he blows. He also has declared that boom bap and punch lines are still relevant in today’s rap. He's proven himself time and time again, on a plethora of platforms. Now, the New York homegrown emcee has been able to satisfy his supporters with his “‘Juicus Christ” mixtape. In the “Intro’’, Axel distributes heartfelt pain on a slow pianola-laden beat. He reflects on past experiences and struggles he has had to encounter. Fans of Leon’s will be contented with ""Juicus Christ"" even though this is not a lyrical piece of art. It's a moderately personal tape with different element of lanes, you may have not seen him in before. He steps out of his element and give audiences a dose of catchy and some R&B trap content. “High Rollers” has a Sasquatch beat and will have audiences head-nodding while still listening. “Phases” is a zoned- record with a slow-tempo lit beat but will have you jigging. It is not intend to be a club anthem, but will make a car ride with friends an adventure.  “Cloud 9” is a rhythm and blues appeal with trap intent, featuring another Bronx rookie Angelica Vila. This is the Axel Leon fans have never heard from. The record is a obscene trapsoul allure with weed-smoke as the prime topic. “Real Life’’ is a hypebeast- motorsport pattern record, that mimics a song from off a Fast and Furious soundtrack. “Regrets” has a gospel- spinet feel but flows and lyrics grabs audiences. It resembles acclaimed song “Lean on Me” but has a more wavy feel. Juice rides the beat cool, calm, and collected, while spilling out his thoughts and foreshadowing.  On “Sometimes” Axel Leon expresses his anxiety and feelings and tellings listeners how “he really feels”. He sing-talks the chorus and surf-boards the beat. “Bad Habits” is most-likely the best song on the tape. Axel has perfected the artwork of storytelling and picture-painting lyrics. The song is very relatable and is very-much both sided. He lets audiences into the thought process of both characters. Axel Leon has already established that he's a certified spitter. “Juicus Christ” is proof that he can emerge from underground freestyle sessions into stardom.  My peeps who love spitters will love this kid!! he's nice as fucc...I dl'd his J.U.G.O. tape a month ago and been banging it ever since..

56,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/azchike-has-a-message-for-too-short-rYqxIaRJq0K5LTLba_hzpA/,"AzChike explodes onto the LA rap scene with dark, enticing bangers that scream all things West Coast. With the success of “Burn Rubber Again” catapulting him into the mainstream light, the South Central rapper drops off My World earlier this year, recorded solely off vibes. AllHipHop talked w/ AzChike about his breakout single “Burn Rubber Again,” and his immediate thoughts and feelings on Uncle Too Short not reaching out to him after he hit success with the remake. AllHipHop: What was the inspiration behind your name? AzChike: I used to conscious rap before I got on the West Coast party s##t, before I got the style that I have today. Basically, I used to try to be deep with everything. Chike is Egyptian. I actually did my research on it. I just wanted something different. It was AzGang or some bulls##t. I didn’t like that because everyone was putting “gang” and all that. I changed it to Cult, then I looked it up. It’s originally Chike Bes, I just say Chike though. Chike stands for power of God and Bes means brings joy, so it means “power of God brings joy.” I just like having something to stand on, having substance and s##t. I don’t like being flimsy and just throwing s##t out there. AllHipHop: Top 5 LA rappers & where do you fit? AzChike: This is not in no type of order, but for sure Roddy Ricch. Shout out Roddy Ricch. For sure Blueface. For sure (1Take)Jay. My brother Saviii 3rd, he just can’t stay out the law way. If he can do that, I’ll put him in this s##t. I want to put him in this s##t. AllHipHop: Didn’t Blueface get locked up recently? AzChike: Yeah, but they let him go. They’re keeping a hold on Saviii 3rd. They don’t have to keep him in jail right now. They’re just keeping a hold on him until after Christmas. I think he gets out on the 28th of December. He’s got to miss the drop of his album and Rolling Loud, so it’s f##ked up. Roddy Ricch, Blueface, 1TakeJay, myself and Rucci. That’s who is doing the damn thing right now, fresh on the come up. Everywhere. Who’s about to get signed, who’s already signed, and just promising futures. That’s my top 5 right there. AllHipHop: “Burn Rubber Again” is at over 7.2M on Youtube. Did you foresee is blowing up like this? AzChike: Hell no. We knew it was going to go crazy, I was talking about having everyone do a challenge, and I don’t even like challenges. I never did it. Never will. Never do that s##t. You couldn’t tell me it was going to do 7 million and help change my life. The s##t just hit 7 million, it was on 6. It’s f##king wild.  AllHipHop: Do you think Too Short heard it? AzChike: I know the f##k he heard it! I know Too Short heard it. Look Too Short, don’t take it too personal, but your old ass got me f##ked up. AllHipHop: Why? Did he get you in trouble? AzChike: No. He was supposed to say something or tap in. I’m not looking for my ass to be kissed, or my d##k to be rode or a handout, but n##ga, period. I don’t care. AllHipHop: He shows mad love to the Bay cats. AzChike: Exactly. AllHipHop: Have ya’ll met? I’m sure it’ll be all love. AzChike: I’ve never met Too Short. He knows everybody I know, I don’t see the difference. I don’t know no other “Burn Rubber” that went up like mine besides his. Even the one with TeeFlii, it wasn’t represented like mine. They just had the same sample in the beat. But me, it’s really called “Burn Rubber Again.” You get what I’m saying? That s##t’s going stupid. It’s already been out for a year and people still hearing it today.  AllHipHop: It’s almost like these new cats haven’t heard the old one, they just know yours. AzChike: Yeah! I’ve brought that s##t back to life. It’s like “damn Short, you were supposed to been said something to a n##ga a long time ago.” I was supposed to have been got that cosign honestly but hey, to each their own. He’s probably a busy man. He be f##king with young n##gas out here in LA though. I know one of his artists. We just did a song together.  AllHipHop: Who is it? AzChike: Radio Base from the IE, he got the song “Bless the Bottle. ”He’s signed to Too Short. They know who the f##k a n##ga is. A lot of these big rappers know what the f##k it is. They want to see if you’re going to be a fluke, or for the moment. Because people will do s##t, shout me out, play my song, and that’ll be it. People will be thinking I got to link up and do a song with them. I’m like “f##k that.” I’m not finna d##k ride you. I’m going to say thank you and give a good appreciation, like really thank you. If you don’t elaborate off of that and really f##k with me, then there’s nothing really to talk about. I said thank you, you said you’re welcome, we move on with our lives. A lot of these big motherf##kers know who I am, but I don’t care. Want me to perform in front of ‘em, so the whole crowd can sing it and be like “oh, that’s you?”  That’s what they want. That’s what they wait for, until you’re in person with them. That s##t is gay. A lot of people that though. Not even just bigger rappers, but bigger blogs, all that. s##t pisses me off. Ya’ll supposed to be the ones tapping in and finding the fresh talent. Not like that, but not everybody’s doing the numbers we’re doing. The least you can do is put respect on somebody’s work ethic and results that came out, and not overlook them. When you do see them you don’t say s##t, but you’re supposed to be this big music head.  AllHipHop: Are you concerned at all promoting guns in your music? AzChike: No, not at all. Whatever energy you bring out is what you’re going to get. I understand what I’m doing, I’m not oblivious to the s##t. I understand consequences, and how s##t works out. I believe my fate is my fate. Whatever happens is supposed to happen, it’s going to happen. I can do nothing about it until it happens, so I don’t worry about nothing. I don’t trip off that. For kids who listen to it, if your parents don’t like it, take it up with them. I don’t parent nobody’s kids. I can’t tell you what to do. When I do talk about guns, it don’t just be about “oh I got a big gun: bang, bang, bang.” I like gun flips. There’s many ways you can maneuver with that. You can talk about the size of the gun, the type of gun, how many bullets the gun holds, cocking the gun back, when a gun hits you. There’s a lot of s##t you can get into. Being basic is where it goes, but I say other s##t when I talk about guns. I don’t just say “big gun, I’ma shoot you, he’s dead.” I like guns. I don’t be that basic, so I feel like I’m good.

58,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/b2k-is-back-a-conversation-with-raz-b-_2RSQADjAESRgWgf-9Oycw/,"(AllHipHop Features) During the early 2000’s, B2K was riding a wave of success as the most popular boy band in contemporary Black music. With their harmonious vocals and laser-sharp choreography, B2K was on the fast track to dominant the entertainment industry. With smash hits like ""Uh Huh,"" ""Gots Ta Be,"" ""Bump, Bump, Bump"" (featuring P. Diddy), and “Girlfriend,” playing to sold-out concerts across the globe, B2K was a force to be reckoned with. Capitalizing on their crossover appeal, B2K starred in their own feature film You Got Served, a cult classic that went on to gross over $46 million dollars at the box office. But while at the zenith of their success, in January of 2004, amidst a cloud of controversy, Omari ""Omarion"" Grandberry, Jarell ""J-Boog"" Houston, Dreux ""Lil' Fizz"" Frederic, and De'Mario ""Raz-B"" Thornton, abruptly disbanded, leaving their loyal fan base in complete shock.  In just over two years, B2K had fallen apart. The reasoning behind the split was allegedly due to wanting a change in management from Chris Stokes. Stokes had been long accused of sexually abusing members in the group. In December 2018, he again denied those allegations. On Instagram, Stokes said, ""Negativity I will never play into. I never hurt any of B2K & Always had their best interest at heart including financially. I forgive any negative energy or tweets! God forgives and so do I. They back! Now stay positive in 2019 & Go get your tix! Enjoy them being back! Much love!I"" 15 years after their initial breakup, B2K has reunited and are headlining the Millennium Tour which will hit cities all throughout the U.S beginning in March. This will be the first time the band has performed together in over 10 years. B2K will be accompanied by Mario, Ying Yang Twins, Lloyd, Pretty Ricky and Chingy. I caught up Raz-B and we discussed the legacy of B2K, his successful rebrand in China, his producing and managing new artists, and the possibility of B2K releasing new music. AllHipHop: Tell me how was it growing up in Cleveland, Ohio? Raz-B: I was born in Cleveland but my mother moved to Oakland, California when I was about nine months. So, Oakland is actually where I’m from. AllHipHop: As a child, did you always know that you wanted to be in the music business? Raz-B: From doing talent shows with my brother and being from a musical family, I would say ever since I was 10 years old that I knew this is what I wanted to do with my life. I loved singing and dancing in front of a crowd from an earlier age. Yeah man. Music has always been a part of my life since I could remember. My family was in the music business. Growing up watching Immature make it in the game was a big influence on me. My cousin, Chris Stokes managed Immature as well. I was a part of several groups before B2K got together so I was always focused on making it in music. AllHipHop: How did you and the other members of B2K meet? Raz-B: Me, Fizz, and Boog we already in a group called Melodic and then we met Omarion at Marques Houston’s 18th birthday party. We all knew that O was special. The way how he was dancing and singing, we all knew that he was the missing piece of the puzzle for the group. AllHipHop: After the initial success of B2K, how did you handle everything that came your way at such a young age? Yo it was crazy. But I must say that our team really helped us to stay grounded through everything. Don’t get me wrong, we did have some wild times being young and out on tour. But for the most part, we were taught to treat everything like a business. But at time it would get lit!  AllHipHop: In your estimation, what caused B2K to break up? Raz-B: Really, a lot of misunderstanding and miscommunication. Me, Fizz, and Boog wanted to move in another direction with our management away from the Ultimate Group, ran by Chris Stokes. We had a different perspective on how our careers were going then Omarion at the time. So, the three of us decided that we would refuse to work as B2K until there was change in management. Then the three of us were in Las Vegas and it came across the T.V. screen that Chris Stokes said because of internal issues, B2K was breaking up. They caught us by surprised. AllHipHop: After the B2K, you did the unexpected and left to live in China. Ironically, Stephon Marbury retired from the NBA around the same time and moved to China and he is now an icon over there. What’s your take on the appreciation of black music and culture in China? Is it different from the U.S? Raz-B: First of all, I lived in China for seven years. China is on fire! It has the fasting growing economy in the world and a very large population. I would say that I became a man in China. I even learned the language. In China, I learned who I was outside of the image and identity of B2K. I grew up as person in China. I started to produce and design clothes. It’s a great culture to be a part of. China has a deep appreciation for art all the way around. They embraced me over there as family. They do love Black music and culture. From the moment I got over there, they supported me. That’s why I stayed so long. China is a second home to me. AllHipHop: Who broke the ice when it came to getting you guys back together? Raz-B: It was like all of us. We realized that there was some opportunities on the table and we decided to take advantage of them. Through everything we been through, we always had a special bond as brothers. We’re looking forward to getting back out there and performing for our fans after being away for so long. AllHipHop: I was excited to hear that you guys are getting back together because there aren’t any R&B there's no groups anymore. Why do you think that's the case? Raz-B: That’s a good question. There’s been a big void in R&B for the last few years. R&B groups have been on the decline for minute now. Hopefully, with our reunion we can help bring R&B groups back to the forefront. AllHipHop: Are there any plans for the group to create new music or you just won't see how the tour goes? Raz-B: Man, that’s a good question too. I think the guys just want to get our feet wet with the tour and then we’ll see what happens. If we would come to a place where we could record some new material, I would definitely be down with it. AllHipHop: You made a full transition from a successful teen artist, an international personality, and now you’re developing your own artist such as Mordecai and Rumzellie. How do you feel about this aspect of the music? Raz-B: Working with artists like Mordecai is very important to me in the next phase of my career. Mordecai is a very talented artist that I’m supporting. I want all yall to check out his single “Netflix and Chill.” In China, I was doing extremely well producing and developing artists. Rumzellie is crazy too. He sounds like no one out there. He has a unique sound that’s all his own**.** Make sure all yall check out Mordecai @mordecai_music and Rumzellie @rumzellie on all Social Media. AllHipHop: My last question is one that everybody wants to know, I mean the real hardcore B2K fans would like to know this one. Is there any plans for a You Got Served sequel? Raz-B: Haha! I don’t know about a You Got Served 2 but I will drop this on you. I’ve been in talks about creating the Boogaloo Kid. We’re working on that as we speak. AllHipHop: Wait…………. Are you planning on starring in it? Raz-B: I can’t get into all the details right now but just be on the lookout in the near future.

60,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/before-black-panther-15-things-to-know-about-the-super-hero-king-u7tgUefMZEmP1GRGUs-sLQ/,"Groups of people (OK, BLACK PEOPLE!) are gleefully preparing to don traditional African clothing and Afrofuturistic garb to their various outings. Others are swept up in the mania, as “Black Panther” has garnered the best Rotten Tomatoes rating for a superhero movie since Christopher Nolan’s “The Dark Knight,” over a decade ago. Let it be known, Dark Knight continues to be the gold standard of excellence, but Black Panther is a natural breaker of tradition. There is a new dark knight, people. Unlike Batman, the story of Black Panther has not been regurgitated over and over and over through the annals of time and space. Here are 15 items to help you grasp the movie when you undoubtedly step into the theater.  Black Panther Was the First Black Superhero In Mainstream Comics Superman. Batman. Spider-man. The Hulk. Iron-man. Captain America. And Wonder Woman. Black Panther was the first major superhero in comics. He came well before Luke Cage (Power Man), The Falcon, John Stewart (Green Lantern) and Black Lightning. The Black Panther Was Created By Two Revolutionary White Guys! The Black Panther was created by Stan Lee (writer/editor) and Jack Kirby (artist/editor). Clearly they saw the greatness of Africa as well as the parallels the advanced civilization has to history. They took it a step further in the height of racial tension and revolutionary activity by Black people at that time. They gave T’Challa superior intellect, strength, advanced technology and more money than even Tony Stark! The character was like Mansa Musa, the richest person in history, Hannibal, the greatest military leader and the ancient Egyptians all rolled into one body. Kudos to Lee and Kirby for blessing us with such a powerful hero king. The Black Panther Pre-Dates The Formation Of The Black Panther Party I was astounded when I found out that the first major Black comic hero was created before the revolutionaries of the same name. That’s right, the Black Panther - Wakanda’s king - was created in 1966 months before the Black Panther Party For Self Defense. The Black Panther first came in July of 1966 in the Fantastic Four (#52) and The Black Panther Party would shake up the world in another way in October of 1966. Shout out to  Bobby Seale and Fred Hampton! The two entities did not stand in solidarity or anything like that. (For the record, The Black Panther Party was not named after the  superhero.)  The Black Panther Fell Back Due To The Black Panther Party Unlike Wakanda and T’Challa, America was super real and extremely cruel to the Black Panther party. The party, who implemented a lot of community-based initiatives, were treated like terrorists while real terrorists like the Ku Klux Klan were permitted to permeate society freely. Co-creators, Stan Lee and Jack Kirby temporarily changed the Black Panther to Black Leopard in 1972 to make sure real-world politics did not mix with the fictional world they had created.  We May Get A Black Panther / X-Men Crossover  In my opinion, the “Black Panther” will be a massive success that the comic world has never seen before. Such a financial windfall will produce many positives, the most obvious being a sequel. However, Disney recently acquired all the Marvel assets from Fox (The X-men franchise, Deadpool, The Fantastic Four and more). In the comics, Black Panther, real name T’Challa, is married to Storm of the X-men, who is also African. The frequent leader of the X-Men and the ruler of Wakanda got married in a traditional Wakandan ceremony with super heros all over the place. I won’t tell you how things ended up since most people won’t read the book. Just know that this can happen now.Will it? Only time and Marvel will tell. Wakanda Is The Most Advanced Nation In The World Once upon a time in the Marvel universe, a meteor landed in the nation of Wakanda, smack dab in Africa. Vibranium was in that meteor and it help propel the nation forward. Wakanda continued their self-imposed isolation from the rest of the world and promoted an advanced understanding of Vibranium. In the movie, the knowledge and wisdom of Wakanda is put on center stage, as it is a central theme of the whole “Black Panther” movie. Black Women Rock In Marvel's “Black Panther”  If the trailers were not clear, know that the women of “Black Panther” are the real stars of the movie. That is not to take anything from Chadwick Boseman, who plays T’Challa, but the women are badass af! I have already gotten my daughter some toys from the movie and definitely want her to pay close attention to the tech-wiz Shuri, T’Challa’s younger sister. Forget about damsels in distress, as they don’t exist in “Black Panther.”  The Dora Milaje are Black Panther's security force and they are all ALL powerful sheroes. These warriors are well represented in the movie and really steal the show. The Black Panther Is More Than A Superhero.  A Black Panther is a warrior that earns that position. In the movie, this notion is on full display. T'Challa goes through rigorous training, mentally, physically and more. He also presides over Wakanda as a leader, strategist, politician, scientist and much, much more.  Wakanda Helps White People :) Wakanda has been able to strengthen itself and continue to be a powerhouse, because it has never been colonized by White people. But White folks have always needed Black people! Captain America’s famous shield is made of a nearly-indestructible hybrid of  Vibranium-adamantium. So, that American shield actually has some African in it. Go figure. The Black Panther utilizes a Vibranium uniform that bullets bounce off, claws that slice through just about anything and even boots which kick a lot of butt. Wakanda has a lot to consider in “Black Panther,” namely how to expand its influence to better the rest of humanity.   The Black Panther Speaks In An African Accent...  In an interview, Chadwick Bosemen explained why Black Panther uses an African accent.  ""Colonialism in Africa would have it that, in order to be a ruler, his education comes from Europe. I wanted to be completely sure that we didn't convey that idea because that would be counter to everything that Wakanda is about. It's supposed to be the most technologically advanced nation on the planet. If it's supposed to not have been conquered – which means that advancement has happened without colonialism tainting it, poisoning the well of it, without stopping it or disrupting it – then there's no way he would speak with a European accent.""  Source: CNET  Wesley Snipes Deserves More Credit, But It Is Complicated When Wesley Snipes was at the height of his success, he wanted to play the Black Panther on the big screen. He made that reveal in June of 1992. Here is what The Hollywood Reporter stated: “Yet, some 25 years ago, it was a much different story. Snipes' uphill battle was plagued with script re-writes, director uncertainty, storytelling clashes and inadequate CG capabilities needed to truly bring the marvelous fictional African nation of Wakanda to life.” It was not meant to be, but Snipes successfully jump-started Marvel in movies with the highly heralded “Blade” trilogy in 1998. The series paved the way for the X-Men, Spider-man and The Hulk on the big screen. Ultimately, his efforts as a Black vampire - rather than an African king - saved Marvel, which declared bankruptcy in 1996.

Marvel’s “Black Panther” introduces Shuri (played by the adorable Letitia Wright), the sister of Black Panther, who is one of the breakout stars of the movie. also has gone through the rigors of training like her big brother. In the comic, we see her assume the role after some dramatic events mess with T’Challa.  Black Panther Has Been In Almost Every Marvel Super Team! He has been in: The X-Men (affiliated through marriage to Storm) Fantastic Four The Defenders The Fantastic Force Avengers The Ultimates And More...  Black Panther Is In The Illuminati  In the comics, The Illuminati are a group of superheroes that are super smart as well. They are not the clandestine and allegedly evil group that serve as the world’s puppet masters - again allegedly! Iron Man pull all of these heroes together to create a new government that decide the fate of the Earth on their level of intergalactic warfare.   Black Panther Is Rich AF!  He’s worth $90 trillion, more than anybody else in the Marvel or DC universes.   ‘Nuff Said  The Black Panther is here and he’s not going anywhere. The movie, the latest in a string of wins by Marvel, is set to hit theaters nationwide on February 16. The saga stars: Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, Martin Freeman, Daniel Kaluuya, Letitia Wright, Winston Duke, Forest Whitaker and a gang of others incomparable talents.

The debut album which was written in the projects was now being performed on a massive stage and broadcast on public television. It was clear that hip-hop has not just grown up, but has become a cultural force. The performance is not the first nor will it be the last that an orchestra has backed up a rapper.  Common and Kanye have both performed with classical artists. Miguel Atwood-Ferguson composed A Suite for Ma Dukes with an orchestra in 2010. Hip-Hop and classical music make a unique pairing because they seem so contradictory. Rap is the music of the streets, while orchestral sounds conjure images of elitism. Yet, the unique production of hip-hop is sonically complimented by orchestral sounds. On March 5, 2019, hip-hop and classical music will once again join forces when Nas will again perform Illmatic with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra for only the second time. The Detroit concert will be nearly 25 years from the release of Illmatic and the show is sure to be a great event.  ""When you hear an orchestra playing behind something, it changes the way you listen to it,"" says Erik Ronmark, Vice President of the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, ""It's a cross genre experience that we hope will move the audience."" The Detroit Symphony Orchestra knows that the legendary rapper will appeal to not only their regular guests, but to many who have never been to the orchestra. ""For some this will be the first time they have been inside the hall,"" Ronmark says, ""Or their first time hearing an orchestra."" Orchestra Hall is nearly 100 years old and is considered one of the world's most acoustically perfect concert halls. The show is presented by The Detroit Pistons, who are on the board of the orchestra was coordinated by Adam Schneider, CEO of APS Presents-a California-based entertainment production and management company. Schneider's relationships with both the Pistons and Nas helped when the DSO was listing artists for their Black History Month events. ""We had talked about a few artists,"" Ronmark states. ""But, Nas was right at the top of that list."" Tickets for The Detroit Pistons Present Nas and the Detroit Symphony Orchestra are nearly sold out. Tickets are being resold for as high as $8,000 at press time. Proceeds for the show benefit The Sphinx Organization, a national non-profit organization that supports the careers of young string players of colors.

Real money and marketing efforts started  being used to bring Hip-Hop’s growing popularity to the masses. In March  of that year, DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince won the first Grammy  for Best Rap Performance, and Yo! MTV Raps debuted in August. The greatest example of Hip-Hop capitalizing on all this though was  the amount of quality music  that was released that year.  There was so  much of it that 1988 is widely regarded as rap’s best year ever.  And so  AllHipHop.com rose to the challenge of ranking its most remarkable  releases. These are the best of the best.  Here are the greatest Hip-Hop albums  from ‘88.  It is referred to as rap’s first Golden Era, and for very  good reason. 10). Straight Out the Jungle by The Jungle Brothers:  While De La Soul and A Tribe Called Quest are often recognized for their  contributions to the Native Tongues movement, it officially began with  the Jungle Brothers’ debut, Straight Out the Jungle.  From sex  raps to Afrocentrism, the album was clearly a well-rounded piece of work  that presented the trio as daring emcees.  They weren’t afraid to  explore real topics.  The trail they blazed is still being followed to  this day.  9). Lyte as a Rock by MC Lyte: MC Lyte’s first album was a  breakthrough in Hip-Hop.  Her commanding vocals, sense of style, and  rapping abilities made her a tour de force.  “Paper Thin,” “I Cram to  Understand U,” “10% Dis,” and the title track proved that she could hold  her own in the male-dominated world of rap.  Public Enemy’s Chuck D put  it best, “S**t, she’s the bomb.  Lyte is the ultimate MC, with the voice, style, and the ability to cut a rhyme and make it hurt.”   8). Power by Ice-T: Ice-T’s sophomore effort is one of  Hip-Hop’s most honest evaluations of the crime life that would be  glorified in the coming years by countless others.  However, songs like  “High Rollers” and “Drama” both expose the real consequences of that  lifestyle.  And as a former criminal himself, Ice-T’s rhymes are some of  the best commentary on the subject that Hip-Hop has ever heard.   7). By All Means Necessary by Boogie Down Productions:  After the death of Scott La Rock (R.I.P.), KRS-One returned with this  Hip-Hop classic.  From beginning to end, this 10-track set is very  potent.  “Jimmy,” “Stop the Violence,” and “Illegal Business” confront  sex, violence, and drugs.  And while a record like “My Philosophy”  discusses BDP’s evolution, it still manages to take a subliminal shot at  Run DMC.  This album has a lot to teach, but one of the most memorable  lessons is “Don’t f**k with Kris.”   6). Follow the Leader by Eric B. & Rakim: Most people  would fold under the pressure to follow up a monumental debut.  But Eric  B. and Rakim aren’t most people.  Atop improved production courtesy of  Eric B., Rakim again delivers of some of Hip-Hop’s greatest lyrics.   This is the duo in their prime.  Like Ra said on “Microphone Fiend”: Spread the word, cause I’m in E-F-F-E-C-T/A smooth operator operating correctly.  5). Strictly Business by EPMD: EPMD was ahead of their  time.  For a case in point, check out how “It’s My Thing” opens with  helicopter sounds and samples “Seven Minutes of Funk.”  Erick Sermon’s  productions served as a precursor to the G-Funk sound that would soon  emerge from the West Coast.  In terms of rapping, “Jane,” another one of  the albums many highlights, has the two guys from Brentwood, Long  Island, seamlessly rhyming back-and-forth with each line.  4). Long Live the Kane by Big Daddy Kane*:* The  first solo offering from Big Daddy Kane is one of rap’s best albums.   He has raps for days about how great he is, but unlike most rappers,  Kane’s boasts are justified by his incredible skills.  “Raw,” “Set it  Off,” and the flawless “Ain’t No Half Steppin’” are all reasons why  “[his] rhymes will remain like a hieroglyphic” like he says on “Just  Rhymin’ with Biz.”   3). The Great Adventures of Slick Rick by Slick Rick: This  is an album which lives up to its title as a result of Slick Rick (and  his alter-ego MC Ricky D) covering a lot of ground in 49 minutes and 46  seconds.  Because of Rick’s personality and amazing storytelling  prowess, songs like “Treat Her Like a Prostitute” and “Lick the Balls”  appear comfortably alongside records like “Teenage Love” and “Hey Young  World.”  “Children’s Story” though is LP’s magnum opus.   2). Straight Outta Compton by N.W.A: Never had the streets  been addressed with such explicit ferocity.  “F**K tha Police” in  particular got a lot of attention.  And while some of it was violent (Without a gun and a badge, what do you got?/A sucker in a uniform waitin’ to get shot), it also raised awareness about police brutality (Police think they have the authority to kill a minority).  Neither of those things should’ve been ignored.  And because of the controversy N.W.A created, they weren’t.   1). It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back by Public Enemy:  With the crack epidemic and Reaganomics in full swing, Public Enemy’s  second album transcended music and served as a call for social change.   There is a sense of urgency in everything that’s heard.  And that helped  create the album’s most enduring quality which is that it provides  hope.  Even after a quarter of a century, It Takes a Nation remains one of the most righteous recordings of all-time.

Well, whenever she did it, Beyonce sent her warm regards - in advance - for Mrs. Obama being one of the best role models that her daughter Blue Ivy will witness growing up. And, she also shouted her out and empathized with her having to deal with the spotlight every moment of her life, but continuing to remain level-headed.  Aww!! How cute!

The event will take place on October 7, 2017 at the University of Delaware. More info at the bottom of this interview.  AllHipHop: First of all, what inspired your to do this event and what do you mean when you say ""where art and fashion dream together""? Janieka Brown: I really have a love and appreciation for art, fashion and the creative process that goes into bringing an artistic vision into fruition.  This is an event where aspiring artists and fashion designers who dream of attaining the next level of success can forge their ideas and work ethic into a joint collaboration.  I truly hope the event benefits so many in Delaware as the intended purpose is giving back to artists in pursuit of their dreams.  A portion of the proceeds collected will go towards art related activities and programs in Wilmington, Delaware as well as The University of Delaware's School of Fashion student organization (Synergy Fashion Group).  There are many children and young adults in Delaware dreaming about a career in the Arts but may not know how to go about attaining those dreams or have the resources to pursue those dreams. This is simply my contribution to help and assist them in reaching their goals. Why in Delaware? Earlier this year, I came across The University of Delaware's school of fashion student group: Synergy Fashion Group.  I watched and their  fashion show on YouTube and was extremely impressed with their creative designs.  In meeting some of the members from the group, I was made aware that many of the also had a love and passion for art as well.  From there, I sought to bring art and fashion together for this showcase in our State. In addition, while in the process of organizing this showcase, I have come across so many artists with the state with minimal backing or promotion who have been looking for an outlet to showcase their work.  It is my hope that this opportunity will help their artistic visions be seen by the art community in Delaware.   What is the scene like there, Terrance: Terrance Vann: The scene here is one that is growing. I remember when I first started having shows in Wilmington there was nothing really happening and the art scene seemed stagnant not because of a lack of talent but alot of artists didn't believe it was possible to have big shows here. After organizing like 10 shows that year I met tons of artists and we all started to connect the dots to make a new culture in the city. My first show was 2 years ago and Ive been able to pioneer alot in the city because of a new appreciation and renewed love for the arts here in Wilmington.""  Demitrius ""Motions"" Bullock: The art scene in Delaware from my perspective is that it's beginning to thrive. People have taken a general interest in artists and their work. The downside has been the advertisement of events. The word doesn't seem to get out as it should.  How this event is unique compared to other visual experiences.  For me, this is a labor of love Chuck.  I have been painstakingly adding talent to the showcase, piece by piece over the last several months.  I am ensuring that each artist added a diverse offering to the show.  The show will feature a plethora of diversity down to the art styles on display to people creating the art and the type of crowds their art attracts respectively.  Everyone in the show is creative in their own different way and that dynamic will create such a unique experience.  I refused to be afraid of boundaries and I didn't even acknowledge them.   Terrance Vann: This event is unique in the fact that it is blending a bunch of elements together and having a diverse roster of artists. I think alot of folks will be excited to see how the different styles and perspectives come together under one roof. Demitrius ""Motions"" Bullock: For me, this is special in the collaboration of artists and the combination of the fashion show. The room is going to be filled with creativity. I'm looking forward to the show and being around so many talented individuals.   What made you get into such a competitive space? Fear!  When the concept came to me, I dared myself to follow bringing this ""dream"" about.   In spite of the challenges and being fairly new to this world, I am driven to make the show a success! What do you think of the state of the arts and fashion? I think there is still a lack of diversity on the grand stage.  In addition, there are a lot of unsung, talented artists and fashion designers who have been denied the opportunity to showcase their dreams because their identity may not be as prominent as well-known artists. Most of them that I meet are not looking for anything free, but just want to have the opportunity to be seen on a bigger stage. I hope this show gives them that opportunity. Talk about the overall theme of this show. What do you want people to walk away thinking? Art is Great: Invest in it, embrace the beauty in diversity and appreciate it.  Behind every great painting, photo, or design, there is a wonderful story to be told.  This is how artists speak to us: Through their work.  Last words or things you would like to add? Please join us on October 7th for a wonderful evening! Terrance Vann: My goal when I create art is to make it a one of a kind experience just to look at a piece and take it all in. I like to shift the viewers to a whole other place that can unlock their minds and make them think differently. I call my style ""Terranceism"" because I have developed my own aesthetic over the years with how I use colors and put vibes together so even though the painting is standing still it can take you for a ride that you want more of since you haven't seen anything else like it. My goal is to be the best artist alive and have my work in history books one day as someone who pushed the culture forward and broke barriers. A Celebration of Art with renowned artist showcasing and selling art. A Celebration of music with live Jazz at the evening show. A Celebration of Fashion with original designs. A Celebration of diversity. A Celebration of scholarship. “Dream Big- Where Art & Fashion Dream  Together” takes place on October 7, 2017. There will be two Shows: 3:00pm to 6:00pm will be Semi-Formal and 7:00pm to 10:00pm will be Black Tie.

66,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/black-panther-a-conversation-about-the-deeper-themes-IddZAsczkk-oDILoBGuTcA/,"​(AllHipHop Features) The Black Panther has created a buzz that transcends the traditional blockbuster notions, ideas and themes. ""Street Soldiers"" with Lisa Evers  recently covered the dense topics intertwined in the Marvel movie that has overtones of Afrocentricity, Black rage and colonialism.  By Lisa Evers Marvel's Black Panther is in movie theaters now. Black Panther the superhero is here to save the world but he represents so much more than that.    Stan Lee and Jack Kirby created the comic book character in 1966—and predates the Black Panther Party, according to Chuck Creekmur, the CEO of AllHipHop.com. The character is a king, warrior, and scientist—an alpha male on another level, Creekmur says.   ​Black Panther is king of a fictional technologically advanced African country that hides its riches and intellectual wealth from the world until the Black Panther must fulfill his destiny.   The movie has great action, strong female characters, a multi-layered plot and a predominantly black cast. It is groundbreaking in many ways.   ""You have a $200 million budget given to a person of color, Ryan Coogler, 31 years old, has only directed two other films prior to this—Fruitvale Station and Creed,"" says Clayton Davis, a film critic and the editor in chief of awardscircuit.com. ""And he's given the keys to a big franchise like Black Panther.""   The film's positive portrayals of a black civilization untouched by racism or colonialism can have a profound effect, especially on children.   ""We've all been conditioned to see Africa and Africa's children, whether they be in Africa or in Brooklyn, in a negative light,"" says Brian Favors, an educator with the Nate Parker Foundation. ""And I think this is going to be something that's going to help defy some of those stereotypes.""   ""Any time an individual can see themselves in a positive light, that can only increase their self-esteem,"" says Dr. Elisa English, a clinical therapist.    Image: Marvel ​ ​ This theory is a good one when you think about it. In the comics Thanos is a deviant offshoot of the Eternals. The Celestials created all the various species of eternals in the universe through genetic manipulation. They would then let their creations grow on their own for thousands of years before returning and judging if their creations were worthy or not. If found unworthy the planet was sterilized. Maybe the eternals of Titan were deemed unworthy and that clip is showing the result of this judgement. Recently watched movie on TeaTV http://teatvappdownloads.com/ The Black Panther comic book/character debuted in the same year as the Black Panther party but the Black Panther symbol was popular in the black Community before hand.

The two-night series will  follow Brown's successful solo career.

Woody McClain has returned to reprise his role as Brown, one of the  original “Bad Boys” of R&B whose life has been a true representation  of the highs of incredible success and the lows of tragedy and trying  times. Mekhi Phifer, Gabrielle Dennis, Lil Rel Howery, T.K. Carter, Laz  Alonso, Lance Gross, Alyssa Goss and Sandi McCree are set to star in the  biopic as Brown’s brother, ex-wife Whitney Houston, manager, MCA  producer-executive, childhood friend, current wife and mother. The  two-night miniseries is slated to premiere September 2018. AllHipHop sat down with the one-and-only Bobby Brown to discuss his highly-anticipated biopic series. AllHipHop: How does it feel to see your biopic come to the television screen? Bobby Brown: It feels great. I just feel like I'm glad I'm here to  see it shown and done because I'm the only one who can tell my story, so  I think it's great. AllHipHop: What's your role? Are you the executive producer? Bobby Brown: Me and my wife's company are producers on the film. I'm  just glad to be a part of it. To be out here and to be in the trenches  with these actors to help them understand and realize the roles that  they are actually playing. AllHipHop: What direction are you going with this project? Is it raw  and unfiltered because you've always been transparent and honest, and we  love that about you. Bobby is authentic. Bobby Brown: I have to be authentic. That's how my mother raised me,  and yes this film will be all-out. It's not about my book. It's about,  you know, different times in my life that really meant something to my  being, to me becoming the man that I am. AllHipHop: What's your favorite reenactment? Bobby Brown: I don't think I've seen it yet.... I don't think I've seen  it yet. I think all of the scenes that we shot so far are great. I'm  really looking forward to, you know, most of the good times other than  just the bad times. That's where I think I'm going to really appreciate  the work that these actors are doing. AllHipHop: So I know you had a lot of incredible memories on the road  from New Edition to your solo career. Off the top of your head can you  give me your wildest craziest moment? Bobby Brown: The wildest...... It's been too many. It's really way  too many for me to even start to even think about the wildest times we  had. Just all of the times we had right before we would go on stage how  goofy all of us were. We would laugh; we would joke with each other. It  was just a great time in our lives. We were young boys. Sometimes we  fought. Sometimes we had fun with each other. Sometimes it was just work  time. I think every moment with New Edition has been a great moment in  our lives. AllHipHop: What eras of Bobby Brown are we getting? Bobby Brown: It's going to start pretty early, and then it's going to  go into the times when I was put out of New Edition. Then it's going to  going to go to the times when I was married to Whitney Houston. Then  it's going to go to my life right now with my wife Alicia. It's going to  be a lot of times where you see me and Alicia meet and we were only  friends. But then now to be in love with this woman and to be married to  this woman is something totally different from any other relationship  I've had in my life. So I'm just grateful to have her as my wife and  mother of my children. It's a good time in my life right now. AllHipHop: Who are your ""Top 5"" favorite rappers dead or alive? Bobby Brown: Rakim, Eminem. Kool G Rap, KRS-One, and ME. ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202589.68/warc/CC-MAIN-20190322014319-20190322040319-00434.warc.gz

Through their poetry they can describe entire worlds in 16 bars. For Logic, he's been able to build a strong and loyal fan base through talking about his life and history growing up biracial and poor in Maryland. One of rap's most unique young voices, Logic's authenticity appeals to his fans. In his teens, Logic was kicked out of high school for failing every class except English. His early writing talent has translated to more than just a successful rap career, he is now taking his turn at writing fiction. Supermarket is Logic's first novel written under his real name, Bobby Hall. The book is a dark journey into the mind of a talented young writer who is in the grip of severe anxiety that has crippled his life. Trapped in a dead end job, in a dead end town, Flynn's only means of escape is through the words that he puts on the page in the ever-present little notebook in his pocket. ​  ​ The cast of characters inside of the supermarket are a bunch of weirdos to put it mildly. There's Frank-a sociopath who seems to steal and joke more than he works and Ted-the store manager who is a total goofball. There are a bunch of minor characters who only serve as interesting people for Flynn to fill his little notebook. Then, there is Mia. The pretty girl who works behind the bakery counter has captured Flynn's heart and his mind. Or has she? In fact, is any of this even happening at all? Supermarket is full of twists and turns as well as characters who are interesting. The writing is pretty good for an untrained novice author. Logic's fans will enjoy the work and as a writer, he has a lot of natural talent that I hope to see him continue to grow and develop. Supermarket is a cool ride through the mind of a twisted character invented by one of hip-hop's most impressive voices.

69,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/book-review-the-autobiography-of-gucci-mane-tells-all-qZVZNzdlLEy7GV_eCenL8g/,"(AllHipHop Features) I’ve read a lot of music autobiographies. From Marvin Gaye to Diana Ross to Rick James. I’ve read a lot of hip-hop autobiographies as well from Scarface to Common to Eminem. I can definitively say that ""The Autobiography of Gucci Mane"" is one of the most compelling music autobiographies that I have ever and might ever read.  It’s more than just the story of how one man went from rap reject to the most magnificent “glow up” ever seen. It is a story of black manhood in the American South as never described before. Written by Gucci and former XXL Editor, Neil Martinez-Belkin, the book is an eye-opening look into the life of the Trap God and the sound he influenced.  “Trap music. To some it’s the subject matter. Stories of serving fiends through burglar bars. To others it’s a style of beatmaking. Sh*t, today there’s a whole audience of white kids who think trap music is about poppin molly and going to a rave.” He explains, “In a way it’s all those things. But when I think about trap music I think about those early days in Zay’s basement…. The whole process was crude and unrefined. What we were making wasn’t radio-ready and definitely not destined for the charts. When I think about trap I think about something raw. Something that hasn’t been diluted. Something with no polish on it. Music that sounds as grimy as the world that it came out of.” (p. 52)  The story begins with the turning point that landed Gucci in federal prison for a 39-month sentence, immersed in a promethazine-induced haze he found himself in an altercation with Atlanta police where he required two shots of sedatives to calm him. From this turning point, that is revisited toward the end of the book, Gucci Mane introduces us to the origin of Radric Delantic Davis in Bessemer, Alabama at 1017 First Avenue to be exact. In the book, he explains his complicated family structure one of unmarried parents, half-siblings, and a close network of grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins. He reveals that it was from his father Ralph “Gucci” Dudley that he got his rap moniker. Gucci’s early life reveals a lot in common with many rap artists, an early exposure to hip-hop music from a savvier older brother, good grades, and a passion for making quick money fueled by a working class economic status.  As one would expect, the story then diverges into his own interest into making rap music. Gucci was at first interested in being a CEO styled after Master P, this would later emerge in his signing and promotion of dozens of Atlanta rap artists including Waka Flocka Flame, Peewee Longway, Young Thug, and Migos. His relationship with his primary producer, Zaytoven is explored at depth. In the book, it is truly understood how much of an effect they had on each other. Zay with his calming presence, the son of a strict Christian family and Gucci with his relentless work ethic. Together they have gone on to create classic trap music that defined the sound of their city.  Undoubtedly, one of the most riveting sections of the book is the time that Gucci spends explaining his beef with Jeezy. It’s a beef that was seismic in its effect in Atlanta. The two titans and their rival crews divided the city for years with only brief, tumultuous moments of peace. The beef eventually caused Gucci to catch a murder charge that he later beat due to self-defense. “I was angry. Directly or indirectly this guy had put me in a situation where I had to fight for my life in the streets, and now I was going to be fighting for my life in the courts. Meanwhile he was out there enjoying all the success of his debut album.” (p. 110) It is when Gucci talks about his various prison stints that the reader really gets an insight into what life for him was like, it then to understand what was going on in his mind with his seemingly endless trips to prison, and tattooing an ice cream cone on his face. “After what happened in ’05 and all my scuffles in the streets, I already had serious issues with paranoia. I would use the drugs to numb those feelings but really they magnified them. People have called me bipolar or that I suffer from depression, but I always identified most with the symptoms of someone with PTSD. Like a soldier who came home still dealing with the effects of being in a war zone.” This brief passage situated in a chapter that is mostly about his relationship with Waka Flocka Flame is where Gucci truly begins to speak for the voiceless. It is not the first time that growing up poor, black and male in America can trigger behavior similar to PTSD, but it is the first time that someone of his stature has made that claim and it makes perfect sense.  In November of 2013, Gucci was indicted by a federal grand jury on two counts of being a felon in possession of a firearm, he was prosecuted by Sally Yates, the federal prosecutor who would go on to become Acting Attorney General of the United States and later fired by Donald Trump after refusing to defend his travel ban. During this stint in prison, unlike his multiple trips prior and his various stints in rehab, Gucci dedicated himself to sobriety, working out and reading inspirational books. The evidence of which has been seen in his newly defined body, and Twitter account that reads like an excerpt from a self-help book. Incarcerated, for what we hope is his final time, Gucci learned, “It’s about how you bounce back from those moments that make you who you are.”  ""The Autobiography of Gucci Mane"" is a book that shines like Gucci’s dazzling new smile as he stands next to his love, Keyshia Dior Ka’oir. It is a revelation and a welcome addition to hip-hop’s literary legacy.   Biba Adams is a NYC-based writer with strong ties to ATL.

Currently at 13 years old, it was 2 years ago when he picked up the moniker Lil Blurry, a phenomenon he describes as “blocking out the haters.” As a young white kid who barely just finished 7th grade, it’s crazy to think real name Aidan Farazdel has signed to Boosie’s label, Bad Azz Music Syndicate — a cosign that speaks volumes in itself. AllHipHop caught up with Blurry to discuss what it’s really like working with the legendary Boosie and what that entails for his future. AllHipHop: You’re so young, how did you start rapping? Lil Blurry: I started rapping a year ago. I been Lil Blurry, that’s always been my name, but I’ve only been rapping for a year.  I started playing music since I was 3. I’ve been playing piano, then I started playing the drums. I wanted to be a musician and songwriter. AllHipHop: Who are your biggest influences? Lil Blurry: Rae Sremmurd, Justin Bieber! Drake, G-Eazy from the Bay! Mac Dre. The bay is lit. AllHipHop: You keep looking at him (Jet). Lil Blurry: I got ADHD man, my bad! AllHipHop: Are you going to finish school? Lil Blurry: They’re actually just happy that I can do this career. I have homeschooling, that’s easier for me to learn. I wasn’t really learning in school really well. It wasn’t meant for me. AllHipHop: When did you stop going? Lil Blurry: August of last year. When I started poppin’ off a little bit, I decided it’s time. My teachers were treating me kind of poorly. AllHipHop: What do your friends think? Lil Blurry: I don’t really have a lot of real friends. My friends are all pretty chill. They’re supportive of my career, but I wouldn’t know. I stay to myself.  AllHipHop: At what point did you realize this music thing was forreal? Lil Blurry: I would say when Boosie signed me, because a legend like him showed that I can do it! The stuff I do with him, the activity type of things, we get a lot of stuff done. We travel. I’ve met a lot of legends throughout the time of this little process. A lot of huge artists. People that I look up to, so that’s how I know. Boosie helped me with that, my management. AllHipHop: How did he find you? Lil Blurry: I was grounded at the time. I did this little Instagram skit and apparently he saw that. He found one of my older records and said “this kid’s funny, he’s fire.” He hit me up, flew out to SF the next day. We met, deal secured, Syndicate. Just like that, he came the next day. The very next day. Jet: Came to the W Hotel. Crazy story, ATL to SF. He DMed me and my team, blowing us up. His team was hitting us up... AllHipHop: How? Lil Blurry: Luck. Best day of my life. AllHipHop: Did you even know who he was? Lil Blurry: Yes! Boosie Badazz. AllHipHop: But that was before your time too. Lil Blurry: Still, that’s a legend.  AllHipHop: Favorite song by Boosie? Lil Blurry: I like his newer one like “I’m Sorry.” I like “Love Yo Family,” that’s a slapper. I like his newer songs because I feel like they’re more balanced. Compared to back then, he’s chillin’ now. He’s happy. His new sound, I really like it. His newer album. ​ AllHipHop: Can you talk about the dynamic in the studio with him? Lil Blurry: He’s really energetic! He has a very insane energy. Whenever I’m recording, he’s always hyping me up. It’s always good vibes when we’re working. AllHipHop: How much of a hand does he have in your music? Lil Blurry: Big! Helps me out a lot for sure. He’ll give me advice on my music, how to make it better. Add more substance in my music in a real way. Jet: It’s funny, Boosie put Diddy on FaceTime the first time he met him. Blurry goes “who’s that?” AllHipHop: I didn’t know who that was. [laughs] Jet: Diddy goes “I’m going to put you on my show The Four this year!” all this stuff. Blurry goes “who was that?” Completely just asked Boo who that was. It was this whole funny thing.  AllHipHop: How did you build your fanbase? Lil Blurry: I built my fanbase through more the music side. I think people had a lot of disbelief that I could actually do something, but the ones that believed in me kept following and those are the fans I have today. AllHipHop: What can we expect from you music-wise? Lil Blurry: I have a lot of crazy little things coming through this year. I have a lot big drops. I got a record with DJ Khaled, another legend to this game. Super fire track coming real soon. AllHipHop: How did that happen? Lil Blurry: Boosie set it up for me. Single and music video coming soon, exclusive. Shout out to Motion Family. Those guys are didall legends. AllHipHop: Is there anything else you want to let us know? Lil Blurry: One more thing: Lil Blurry is the best freestyler in the game 2019. Editor I wanna hear those bars This kid extremely luck to have the legend boosie behind his music.

Red Bull has partnered with Live Nation this year to bring together this absolutely unique musical performance that clashes classical music and breakdancing.  The four-­time World Breakdance Champion Flying Steps and renowned opera director Christoph Hagel are proving that breakdancing and classical music are an unusual but dope match with a 70 minute show  The show itself is a blend of the minds of Artistic Directors Vartan Bassil (choreography) and Christoph Hagel (piano, musical director).  “We can’t wait to hit the road again with Red Bull on this massive US tour!” said Bassil. “The American audience has the most incredible energy, making it an absolute treat for us to perform there.”  [video width=""1280"" height=""720"" mp4=""http://allhiphop.malt.maven.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Flying_Bac_Teaser.mp4""][/video]  This innovative adaptation of Johannes Sebastian Bach’s “Well­Tempered Clavier,” breaks down the barrier between high society and urban culture featuring head spins, power moves, freezes, and awe ­inspiring visuals.

Let's get into some basic background information about you and what you have accomplished so far.  Bronze Nazareth: I live in Detroit, but I was born and raised in Grand Rapids, Michigan. We call it ""Gun Rule"" because the same thing goes on. It's all the same, it's all one hood. It has the highest Black population besides Detroit. I've been in Detroit for a couple of years now.  Allhiphop.com: You sound just like a New York cat, though.  BN: You ever heard of LA The Darkman?  Allhiphop.com: Of course.  BN: He's from Grand Rapids, too. He's back and forth between The Bronx and Grand Rapids.   Allhiphop.com: What do you have in the works right now as far as projects are concerned?  BN: Right now, I got my own album, The Great Migration, that's about 50% done. I'm trying to do it right and make it a classic. I just did some joints for RZA's album. I got four joints that GZA's fucking with, and I got some joints on the Masta Killa album. Hopefully, all of them will make it to the final cut. You know you got to deal with sample clearance and all that bullshit. Also, I'm reaching out to Immortal Technique. We've been in contact, so we should be doing something together.  Allhiphop.com: How did you wind up becoming affiliated with Wu-Tang in the first place?  BN: Back in '96, '97 or '98, me and my brother Kevlaar 7 had done this album called The Unknown. We was selling mad copies off the internet. I was shipping shit to Australia and Japan. I think I sent an email to Cilvaringz, because I was always loved Wu. They started listening to the shit, and they was feeling it. So, we started building or whatever, and we went to New York. We was in D&D for a couple of weeks in the summer, doing Cilvaringzs album. He took me to see The RZA, and I did three tracks for one of the group's he got on his label. He came in there, and he was bobbing his head or whatever. They was about to go to the club, and I was like, ""yo RZA, let me get five minutes, that's all I need!"" He gave me five minutes; he's a very gracious man. I showed him one song, and it was Wu Elements from there.  Allhiphop.com: Is there one Wu member that more fits your style of production than any of the rest?  BN: I'd have to go with Ghost and RZA probably. Ghost the most, because I'm a Soul fiend, man. I got all the old Soul in me that I grew up with like everybody else. When I start digging (in the crates), you get deeper and deeper in the samples, and I got trash bags full of old Soul CDs. I dip into classical, too.  Allhiphop.com: About how long would you say you have been in the production game?  BN: I've been producing since '94, man. I used to have the straight Hip-Hop style. It's always been hardcore, like a street style, but I really didn't start the heavy Wu type of shit until I got with Wu. Outside of Wu, I've got a Hip-Hop personality.  Allhiphop.com: Do you foresee yourself getting some work on the next Wu-Tang album, provided there is going to be a next album?  BN: RZA mentioned something to me about that. They'll definitely let me turn some shit in for that.  Allhiphop.com: With The Great Migration album, who are you expecting to make appearances on the album?  BN: I got some niggas on it already. I know my man Hell Razah from Sunz Of Man is going to be on there. Usually when I fuck with niggas, it's like I do a beat for you, and you rock me a verse. I know GZA and Masta Killa is going to be down for it. I'll probably get RZA on there. Cilvaringz is on there, for sure. My man Baretta 9 from Killarmy is on there, and hopefully I can get (Immortal) Technique on there, too.  Allhiphop.com: Is your project going to be pushed by a major or totally independent?  BN: I'm searching right now. I got some offers and shit. I might just fuck with independent distribution and make more money. I'm in no position where I'm going to be platinum; I'm going to get some attention with this joint.  Allhiphop.com: With the style of music that you bring forth, what kind of frame of mind do you have to be in to create it?   BN: I'm a deep thinker, you know what I mean? I remember we were in 4th Disciple's studio one day, and Baretta said my music is like pain. Alot of my music is mad emotional. When I listen to a sample, I hear the pain in the sample. Alot of niggas may hear the rowdiness or the griminess of the beat, but my specialty is pain. I love the grimy shit, but I'm blessed with an ear, man.   Allhiphop.com: What do you believe is the reason for so much pain in your music?   BN: Shit was real wild when I was growing up. I just feel shit like that. If I hear something painful in the sample, it just hits my ear. I want to go grab that.   Allhiphop.com: You bring out something I call ""cry music."" When you put your whole soul and being into a sound, the sound is you. It is what is in your heart and how you feel on the inside.   BN: Word!   Allhiphop.com: Finally, in what direction are you looking to take your craft? Are you looking to revamp the way the world sees and hears Hip-Hop music?   BN: There's so many people in Hip-Hop right now, I think it's hard for a nigga to come out like that. You remember how Bone (Thugs -n- Harmony) came out? Nobody had ever heard anything like Bone had. I think it's hard for niggas to drop right now. There's so many different styles and so many different cultures within Hip-Hop, and it's hard to bring something new to the table. But, I feel like if you always bring something that's refreshing, you are going to be alright. I feel like I'm bringing something refreshing to the game. I'm trying to take it back to '92, man. I'm taking it back to the Timberlands and the hoodies, man.   To hear samples of music and to get more information about Bronze Nazareth, please visit http://www.bronzenazareth.com.

After serving all eight years, Tru was released in 2016 and signed to Future’s Freebandz label a year later. Now, he returns with a banger called “Baddie” featuring his long-time friend. AllHipHop: Can you name your top five rappers dead or alive? Tru Life: Tupac number one, definitely. Tupac, Tupac, Tupac, Tupac, Tupac. [laughs] Those are my top 5’s right there. AllHipHop: No more? Give us three. Tru Life: Tupac, Tupac, Tupac. Ain’t really have no other favorites like that. Tupac was my favorite and most influential artist that I feel like I related to like that. AllHipHop: Can you talk about how hip-hop today compared to when you were locked up? Tru Life: It's definitely different, night and day. It’s similar things, we talk about what goes on in the streets pretty much. Hip-hop is always a reflection of what's going on the hood, but it's just done differently, said differently. The vibe is just different and the beats are different, but I actually enjoy it.  AllHipHop: Can you talk about knowing Future before he was Future? Tru Life: Yeah when he was Meathead, when we was eating sandwiches in the studio. Future has always been the same, he really hasn't changed much. His name is different but other than that, he's always been a hungry artist who's always had a vision for himself. He’s always had the vision of being where he's at right now. He’s always seen himself at the top and being the best artist and always wanted to compete with the best artists. He never wanted to guy that played with the best, he wanted to be the guy that competed against the best. I'm proud to see where he's at right now.  AllHipHop: What's the greatest moment that you share with him? Tru Life: I don't know, we shared a lot of great times together. Probably just seeing him where he's at right now. The first time, I came home and going to the club with him and just seeing how people react towards him, because I didn't know how big he was while I was away. When I came home, I was like “wow.” It just made me really proud to see — like damn, that's my brother that I came up with and used to share slices of pizza together and just have a dream. Now I'm seeing how people react to him and to see it come to life, that was probably my proudest moment. AllHipHop: What was the greatest lesson or life epiphany that you learned while you were locked up? Tru Life: That's a difficult one man, it's so hard to answer. It's so many. When I was away, I first looked at it like it was a bad thing. I felt like God was punishing me and locking me up for a crime I didn't do but then after awhile I looked at it like “maybe this is a blessing.” Maybe God put me here and saved my life. I could have been out there and got hit by a bullet. Maybe the bullet that took this guy's life could've been for me. Maybe I could have got hit by a car, maybe it could have been whatever. I just felt like I was moving left and God wanted me to move right, and that was only way that he can do it. By sitting me down and doing something so drastic like that to me. I just learned a lot and it taught me a lot about myself. ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912203947.59/warc/CC-MAIN-20190325112917-20190325134917-00401.warc.gz
76,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/c-murder-hunger-strike-man-doing-life-over-phone-comes-forward-L6e7vAe9Kkay4XUwV7bPvg/,"C-Murder is serving a life sentence for the 2002 slaying of a 16-year-old. The rapper and several inmates launched a three-week hunger strike over the wretched conditions they are being kept in. While Angola Prison received some positive press last week, thanks to the death of the Reverend Billy Graham, but the inmates continue to suffer. Prisoners at Angola constructed the coffin Rev. Graham was buried in and were rewarded by having their names wood burned onto his casket.  But shortly before the news of Rev. Graham's death, a new account highlighted the harsh circumstances these very inmates are still kept in.  AllHipHop.com's original story about C-Murder's hunger strike inside of Angola led to an independent investigation by The Daily Dot.  The website received new footage inside of Angola, provided by a guard who wished to remain anonymous. ​ The latest video shows inmates having to clean up flooding, with their bare hands. The inmates claim Angola is infested with rodents, cats, and dogs, who all roam freely around the jail. To make matters worse, some inmates insist worms come out of the shower heads when they turn on the water as they attempt to wash.  ​ ​ ​Inmate Keith Kisack was one of the several inmates who joined C-Murder in his hunger strike to protest the conditions inside of the prison. Keith Kisack is serving a life sentence in Angola, after a case that made headlines throughout the state of Louisiana.  Keith Kisack received his life sentence when he was convicted of having a smuggled cell phone while he was locked up in a different prison. On December 27th, 2011 a correctional officer at Orleans Parish Prison discovered the phone inside of a black sock, which was hidden inside of the crevice of a wall.  When investigator's examined the cell phone's contents, they found a selfie of Keith Kisack, along with hundreds of text messages, including a few sent to an attorney named Jason Williams, who represented Kisack in a 2011 murder case.  Keith Kisack, who had been caught with a phone inside of the jail twice, was promptly charged with possession of contraband, while his then-attorney Jason Williams was called to testify about his communication with the person on the other end of the phone.  Several messages Jason Williams had sent to the device were addressed to someone he identified as ""K.K."" and included personal messages and holiday greetings.  In July of 2014, Keith Kisack's former defense attorney worked with prosecutors and testified against his ex-client regarding the messages sent to the cellphone.  Jason Williams testified there was no way he knew who was receiving the messages since he represented dozens of defendants over the years, and that he didn't know the phone was inside of the Orleans Parish Prison.   Keith Kisack's new lawyers argued that their client was being singled out after a shocking video leaked in 2010, showcasing prisoners inside Orleans Parish Prison using drugs and drinking beer, handling a loaded gun, and even leaving the facility to hang out on Bourbon Street.  A jury convicted Keith Kisack of having the contraband and in less than 20 minutes, handed him a life sentence with hard labor in Angola, with no chance of parole, for being a habitual offender.  ​ ""On the surface, life imprisonment for possession of a cell phone is seemingly 'too severe' in light of the particular circumstances of the case; however, when considering Kisack's long criminal history, and that he was incarcerated at the time of this offense awaiting trial for second degree murder, we cannot conclude that the trial court was manifestly erroneous in handing down a life sentence for this fourth felony conviction. In fact, we could conclude the possession of a cell phone in prison poses a clear opportunity for a threat to prison security,"" wrote Judge Daniel L. Dysart in a March 2016 ruling. Jason Williams went on to become city councilman at large for the city of New Orleans.  As of March 2018, Keith Kisack has not been tried or convicted for the murder case since the main witness was killed and the state allegedly believes Kisack was involved. ​ Keith Kisack reached out to AllHipHop.com to discuss his situation, and even though he has ended his hunger strike too, he maintains he continues to be targeted for protesting conditions inside of the jail.  ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912201812.2/warc/CC-MAIN-20190318232014-20190319014014-00132.warc.gz

AllHipHop.com: Taking care of yourself now, the business is up and popping. You’re free and single. Your circle is back tight again. Ceaser: Yeah, my circle is back tight. AllHipHop.com: I got to tell you, it hurt my feelings when you and Puma fell out. I used to go to those parties in the backyard- Ceaser: I ain’t going to lie to you bro’, it hurt a lot of people’s feelings. It’s something that I felt like it was like, we could’ve mended it but it’s gone now. You feel me? It’s too many people in between us. Like we can’t sit here and talk like … it’s too much this and there’s too much of a past bulls##t. If we can’t sit here and be like, “You know what, man? The past is the past. Man, f##k with this blame game. Who did this and who did.” You got what you got and I got what I got. We ain’t bad right now. You got your own business. I got my own business. What the f##k are we even beefing about, bro’? AllHipHop.com: My father always said, “If didn’t nobody f##k nobody’s wife, send nobody to jail, or kill nobody’s kids, we can work it out. Ceaser: It’s nothing when you look at like, “ni**a, we fought over chicken.” Like, come on bro’. Like we really don’t have nothing that we sitting here like man, f##k that n*gga, f##k that. Why? It’s nothing. It’s no … I have no malice towards you. I don’t hate you, no nothing; but when it comes down to it, it’s just like everything that comes on that side, like “f##k Ceas, f##k Ceas, f##k Ceas.” So, I just keep to myself, bro’. I don’t want … like, I’m not going to sit there and instigate nothing, bro’. I was never a person who instigate. I don’t be on the offense. I’m always on the defense, you know? I’m not going to sit out there and just come at you like that. You feeling me? I feel like when you do s##t like that, you’re begging for trouble. You know? AllHipHop.com: I’m holding out hope that y’all can squash it. I think it can be squashed. I think it can get back right. Maybe y’all won’t be hanging out at each other’s houses like you used to, but I’m holding out hope that there will be a party that you guys throw together, and everybody be good like that. Ceaser: I tried last summer. Went down there, talked to him. Like go see if he really want to squash this bulls##t, just been going on too long. It was a whole bunch of other s##t, like … At the end of the day, I wish that man the best. I mean like, he has a family and regardless of how he think I think about him, I wish his family the best. He, Puma, how can I say this? With Puma now, I’m proud of him. Yeah, we went through our bulls##t, but as a man, what you’re doing on your own, I’m proud of you bro’. Even though you have malice toward me and you have hatred, I don’t have that. He don’t remember that we know each other. I know what you been through, just like you know what I been through. You might sit there and say, “f##k Ceas.” I’m not saying that. I still got love for you, homey. That’s why I can sit there and say, “I’m proud of you.” At the end of the day, I know it ain’t the same, how you feel towards me. So, I keep my distance. At the end of the day, I got to stay positive. I can’t be going back to that old bulls##t. It’s never that serious. It wasn’t about no money. It was just egos, bro’. Then when men have their ego problem, what we do? We scrap it out. Yo, we come back, we hug. Guess what?

81,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/christian-rapper-addresses-his-macklemore-response-jay-z-pushing-the-gay-agenda-manipulation-PgCsqbZ-WEywBolM7S0XmA/,"(AllHipHop Interviews)  It was at that point that Felder says God broke  him down and then eventually put the pieces of his life back together.  The result of that experience was a man who was willing to turn his life  completely over to the Lord, and the faith-based emcee named Bizzle was  born again. Bizzle has released numerous projects since 2008. His 2013 album The Good Fight included  production by Boi-1da and a guest feature from No Malice, but it  was his recent response to Macklemore & Ryan Lewis’ pro-gay rights  song “Same Love” that started a firestorm. People on both sides of the gay marriage debate strongly voiced their  opinion about the God Over Money founder’s single with some championing  his right to freedom of speech and others calling the song homophobic,  hateful, and disturbing. Bizzle connected with AllHipHop.com to speak about his controversial  “Same Love (A Response)” and the reactions it has received. He also  addresses religious imagery in Hip Hop, what he views as rappers being  used to promote the gay agenda, and whether homosexuality is a condition  that can be cured. Macklemore and Ryan Lewis released their version of “Same Love” in 2012. Why did you decide to release your response last month? I know the song is old. I thought it would fall off and disappear  once they put out new material, but I saw the media keep trying to  breathe life into the record and turning into a “gay anthem.” I think  [Macklemore and Ryan Lewis’] Grammy Awards [performance] was the last  straw. I feel like we have conversations behind closed doors, but  everybody’s afraid to speak, because nobody wants to be labeled a bigot,  homophobic, or full of hate. I got tired of walking on egg shells.  There has to be an opposing side. The media can’t make people afraid to  disagree. What’s your response to those people who say your “Same Love” response track is homophobic? I’d ask how? As far as I see, disagreement automatically means  homophobic. I don’t believe that. You would have to really show me what I  said that leads you to believe that I’m scared of you which is what a  homophobe is. You made a reference in the song about rappers that promote the “gay agenda.” Which rappers do you feel are doing that? The biggest one who co-signed gay marriage was Jay Z. I would say  he’s at the top of Hip Hop, and if you wanted to push something to Black  people that would be who you’d take anything through. Just because he’s  powerful. Also, anybody you’ve seen in a skirt  – A$AP Rocky. Anybody  who they’ve put on a platform and made them say, “this is just like what  we went through.” That was another point you made in the song, the idea that the gay  struggle should not be compared to the Black struggle. Do you dismiss  the entire idea of equal rights for the LGBT community? No, not at all. They should get the rights that married people get as  far as tax breaks, but if your right to marry violates the pastor’s  right to not marry you because of his religion, then I can’t be for this  right against that right. Also, I know that gay people suffered. A lot of people seem to think  that I’m just disregarding any of gay people’s struggle, and that’s not  what I’m doing. What I’m saying is don’t compare them. I don’t compare  slavery to the Holocaust. Don’t compare this to that, because the moment  you start comparing similarities, then you make it okay for me to  compare the differences. I do believe there are differences. Which would be what in your opinion? I don’t believe people are born gay, though I do believe we all are  born with temptations. But, a child born Black in that time period, from  day one had the world against them. If a child is born gay, we won’t  even know until about six or seven. At this point now, the punishment is  far worse if you commit a hate crime. Back then not only was it not a  hate crime, you could murder us for fun. It was in the law that we were  only three-fifths of a person. I think that the level of oppression was a  lot different. You said that you don’t believe people are born gay. Do you think  it’s a condition that can be fixed? Do you think someone can stop being  gay? I know a few people who’ve been delivered from homosexuality. The  thing is, if I tell a homosexual that they say, “they’ve just been  brainwashed or tricked into believing that it’s not normal.” I know a  good three or four people who’ve been fully delivered, and it was by God  so if you’re not a Christian you probably won’t believe it. There was another part of your song that got a lot of reaction.  That’s when you made the comparison between homosexuals and pedophiles.  Do you believe that a gay sexual act between consenting adults is the  same as a pedophile having sex with children? What I’m saying is, before the pedophile ever touches a child his  desires are already disgusting to the homosexual. They hit me like, “I’m  disgusted you would compare me to that.” I have yet to meet anyone who  could give me a reason that the pedophile cannot use. Whether it’s “born  this way.” Whether it’s “I didn’t choose this.” If you’re not a Christian, a lot people say the Bible’s outdated.  They throw our laws away. Well, if that’s the case the pedophile can  say, “your laws are outdated, and girls are having sex at twelve these  days, so let’s throw your laws away.” I’ve yet to hear anybody use an  excuse that the pedophile can’t also use. I’m talking before he’s  even touches a child he’s still disgusting to you, but if I say your  desire is disgusting to me I’m wrong. My obligation is to not only love  the gay person. It’s to also love the pedophile even if I don’t agree  with what he does. I think some would argue that the difference is that one is  between two consenting adults and the other is an adult taking advantage  of a child. There are pedophiles who don’t act on their desires, but if he told  you that he wants to, even if he doesn’t, you still look at him with  disgust. At that point the argument for him touching a child is  irrelevant, because he hasn’t done it. Even if he’s sought help, he’s  still disgusting to you. I’m talking at the desire level, not on the acting level. At the  desire level I feel like they’re in the same boat. You say one is  between two consenting adults, well, there are different countries that  have different laws where 16 might be the consenting age. I’m not for  the pedophile. What I’m saying is how do you get to throw out the Bible  and say that law is outdated, but he has to stick to your law that says  14 is not old enough? That’s the argument he can make, based on the  argument you’re making. You have Kanye West’s Yeezus. You have A$AP Mob about to drop  their L.O.R.D. album. There have been a lot of religious references in  Hip Hop recently like J. Cole’s Born Sinner and The Game’s Jesus Piece.  What is your take on Hip Hop’s use of religious imagery? I don’t rock with it when it’s used out of context. I definitely  can’t support it. Sometimes people use it and have a righteous thought  behind it, but when it’s used for mockery I don’t rock with it at all.  If I decide, when I’m writing, to put in a rhyme about something that  you feel mocked by, then they should honor that same freedom of speech  that gave them the right to do that with the Lord’s name. Would you ever consider collaborating with an openly gay artist? It depends on what the topic is about. If he’s pushing a message  that’s contrary to mine –  that would be for anybody – I wouldn’t rock  with any artist I feel stands for everything I’m against. But, if he  wanted to talk about his struggle, I’d get on there and talk about mine.  Of course I’ll pray on it like I do anything else. Ultimately, what would you like to see happen as far as the gay community’s role in the media and entertainment? I’d like to see an opposing view be honored and respected. I want to  see the manipulation come to an end. I always say when a dude tells a  female if you don’t have sex with me you don’t love me; that’s  manipulation. Of course when a dude is telling a female that, he doesn’t  feel that way, but if a dude was telling his daughter that he would  definitely feel that way. I feel the same when the media pushes: if you  don’t agree with me then you hate me, but if you love me then you have  to agree with what I do. That’s manipulation as well, and I’m not with  the manipulation.

82,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/cinematic-s-luh-soldier-soldier-mentality-OS5YYWGTRES73ShpwrJ2yA/,"Luh Soldier is here to prove he has what it takes to make it in the rap game, bringing back that raw, real life s##t hip-hop was founded on. At only 19-years-old, the Alabama native has already caught the attention with Jonny Shipes, who signed to his thriving Cinematic Music roster. Now, the ""Soldier Mentality"" spitter touches down for the first time in Los Angeles and caught up with AllHipHop to discuss his sound, his journey, and why the current rap game is weak. AllHipHop: For those who don’t know, who is Luh Soldier? Luh Soldier: I'm a young black male out of Birmingham, Alabama. Grew up in the street life, who’s coming out with this rap s##t and doing something better with himself. Other n##gas going to jail, becoming a statistic — I'm still a statistic but I’m making the best with what I got going on. That's all I can do to explain Luh Soldier. AllHipHop: Where do you fit in the realm of hip-hop and R&B? Luh Soldier: I fit in my own lane. Trap gospel, that's what you can call it. We gonna call it trap gospel. AllHipHop: At what point did you realize this music thing was forreal? Luh Soldier: The whole time goddamnit! The whole damn time. When I was spittin’, even when I was just keeping it to myself — I used to let my mom hear that s##t. She’d tell me “oh yeah, boy you blessed.” That s##t wasn't even in the booth. I took that s##t to the booth and motherf##kers reacting like “bro you telling stories with that s##t.” n##gas can’t wake up without listening to Luh Soldier. It’s real motivation. When motherf##kers telling you that, people reassuring you, you just gotta have the right people in your corner. Everybody around me, we all move and elevate together. That’s one thing about it. As long as you have the right people around you, the top is the only place you can go.  AllHipHop: You just dropped Soldier Mentality. What was the creative process & how long did it take you? Luh Soldier: That s##t was beautiful, a masterpiece put together. I wanna shout out Cinematic Group for helping me organize it. I really love ‘em, I can't tell them enough. It was me putting out my past struggles, what's going on in my life and trying to bring people on. Just to wake people up ‘cause there ain't nobody rapping like this. Ain’t nobody out here talking that s##t. If you really listen to it, it's gon’ get you. No matter where you from, you could’ve grown up with Tiger Woods and you gon’ feel it. You gon’ think you from the streets because it’s so real. You can feel the presence. That’s what separates me. AllHipHop: Talk about your journey with Cinematic. Luh Soldier: Cinematic was f##king with me when I first started buzzing. I was talking back and forth with Shipes. I knew from the getgo he was a cool ass n##ga. I knew we was gon’ be like that. [crosses fingers] AllHipHop: He's the only one I actually haven't met from Cinematic. Luh Soldier: I f##k with Shipes. AllHipHop: How did you guys meet initially? Luh Soldier: Through texting and calling me. AllHipHop: He just found your music or what? Luh Soldier: Yeah, my manager was pushing my music and he caught the ear for it. He was telling me s##t like “I ain’t gotta vibe from you since T.I.” He turned the switch on for me rapping too, made me wanna turn up even more. When I went to jail, he made my bond and wasn't getting nothing in return — ‘cause I could have signed with somebody else. When he did that, I knew it was real. A real relationship, real established base, a real solid foundation. He wanted to see me progress in Luh Soldier life too. That felt like the best route, we gon’ keep working together. AllHipHop: How long were you locked up for? Luh Soldier: I wasn't locked up for no time. I got out that b##ch ‘cause they made my bail, so I’m straight. But I been locked up 4 or 5 more damn times before then. I’m a man. I’m down but as long as I progress every day, that's all that matters. AllHipHop: What's the longest you've been behind bars? Luh Soldier: I’ve been sent to bootcamps and s##t, but never over a week. I’m only 19, I’m just blessed to be able to say I done survived. ‘Cause I know plenty of n##gas that... it's really real where we from. You can't do s##t. s##t getting shot up, motherf##king police f##king with you. Some people don't understand, don't even think about Birmingham what the f##k going on there. It's crazy as hell, I'm telling you now. I'ma be the one to vouch for it. AllHipHop: What's the biggest lesson you learned behind bars? Luh Soldier: That s##t bring you down to a humble state. Every time I got out of my body, God bring me back down. Out the gate. My grandma used to always tell me. I get on the phone with her, she’ll let me know. She’ll give me that talk every time. It just brings you back to your state of mind. But at the same time, it's a lot of bulls##t. AllHipHop: What do you parents think of your rap career? Luh Soldier: They love my s##t. They're my biggest fans. They know every song, front and back. They luh that s##t. They like rap, so they really got a reason to cheer for me. ‘Cause the route we were going on, we were gonna be convicted felons. [laughs] They love it though. That's what a parent wants, their child to have an opportunity to be bigger than what you been through.  AllHipHop: You just dropped the visual for “What Happened.” Talk about that being the title track. Luh Soldier: “What happened to keepin' it gangster? What happened to keepin' it street? These f##k n##gas cappin' and rappin' 'bout money, but they can’t even buy the beat.” I had to name it “What Happened” just ‘cause of that. Sum up this rap game, sum up what the f##k going on today. These n##gas out here snitching, telling on each other and s##t. “Look at me getting robbed,” then rapping and s##t. These n##gas out here are some jokes forreal. The rap game I'm seeing, this s##t a joke! That’s why Birmingham, Alabama is one of the realest cities in America right now. We gon’ bring what we got to the table, change this s##t. Put the ankle down.  AllHipHop: I was watching the video for “45 and a a Glock 9.” Are you concerned at all promoting guns in your music? Luh Soldier: Uhhh, I don’t give a f##k. Tell Jefferson County they can suck my d##k. [laughs] Let me stop. I f##k with some of the officers, but ya’ll got some dirty mothaf##kas in that offices. That’s all I got to say. I mean, you got the right to bear arms in America. I ain’t promoting guns, I’m just showing you I got that b##ch. When a n##ga run up, I ain’t gon fake it. It’s on from the dome. A n##ga play wrong, he gon’ get chromed. ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202433.77/warc/CC-MAIN-20190320150106-20190320172106-00379.warc.gz

AllHipHop interviewed Tatiana King Jones (aka The Grand Duchess of Tech) of Fanbros to talk about Black Panther and the Crown Wakanda movement. AllHipHop.com: Why is this movie so important, both as a pop culture event and within the MCU? Tatiana King Jones: Black Panther, on the most basic level, is a continuation of the MCU story which started with Black Panther's introduction in Civil War. What you will learn in Black Panther will provide a direct lead in to May 2018's Infinity War. Infinity War is absolutely huge as it shows all the Marvel heroes we've met over the last 10+ years (and some surprises/new characters) heading up against one of the most ultimate villains, Thanos. Black Panther is the first time you'll see the character of the same name completely in his element of his country of Wakanda and for the first time get to see on-screen in live action what Wakanda looks like, how he gets his powers, all the important people that will have an impact on this story and future stories and how the world of Black Panther ties into the greater MCU AllHipHop.com: Why is it important to Black people, particularly African Americans, in your view? Tatiana King Jones: From a much more complex level, Black Panther goes beyond the figurative and literally represents a huge Marvel mainstream character on screen that is black and has the full financial, promotional, and technical weight and expertise of Marvel/Disney. With the exception of Spawn and Blade in the 90s/early 2000s, it's essentially unheard of to have a black-actor led superhero movie. And there's already a 1-2 generations beyond the aforementioned films that a great deal of people never even heard of--so Black Panther will be the first time they see powerful black male and female heroes on screen to this incredible magnitude. That's absolutely necessary as many times people don't believe they can be or achieve something until they see it--until they can see themselves.  Within the film industry we're already grossly underrepresented in just about all the different genres (fantasy, sci-fi, action, drama, etc.) so it really matters that this film has finally arrived. It's also a film that is helmed both in front of and behind the camera by majority black crew, cast, and production. It's inception in a way--the film is feature a self-sustaining, never colonized country of Wakanda and the production of the film reflects that (costume design, director, writers, actors, etc.). Black Panther represents one of the many heights that can be attained when black people are allowed to shine and reflect their full glory upon the world without interference. And quite simply Black Panther is bad ass, is smarter than Tony Stark (his sister Shuri is smarter than anyone on the planet in the MCU [confirmed by Marvel], Wakanda is richest and most technologically advanced, and on and on---there's nothing (in superhero/Marvel sense) that has been shown that feature black people, and really, the greater African diaspora, in this way. African Americans particularly have been deprived of this (in the mainstream) so its incredibly important to all of us on an emotional, social, mental, and entertainment level. AllHipHop.com: What, if any, has been the back lash. I've heard the standard, ""If there was a movie called White Panther..."" comments recently. Tatiana King Jones: The back lash seems to come from misguided people who don't understand business, social constructs of black people, and basic logic. The idea of ""White Panther"" or ""White Entertainment Television"" (to use another analogy) relies on false premise that properties that feature or target Black people are created to be exclusionary. To the contrary, these spaces were/are created to be inclusionary of a group of people that have systematically been ignored or oppressed despite their very existence.  Plus there is literally no need for ""white entertainment television""--W.E.T. is every channel, every movie, etc. as the social ""default"" (in America) has been cis-het white males (which has spread across the world via a combination of white supremacy and patriarchy). They have *always* had these spaces. It's Black people and other people of color who lacked these spaces. As for Black Panther itself that's literally as he was created--an African man who's power story revolves around a panther god. So any comments like what you mentioned to me are ridiculous, unfounded, and hold no real weight. And it just sounds like a bunch of haters. AllHipHop.com: Why do you feel this movie has sold so well, even though its not out? Tatiana King Jones: This movie actually already has thousands of sold out viewings in theaters across the country and in some areas overseas. Literally the day the tickets went on sale to the general public, Lupita Nyong'o tweeted that she couldn't get a ticket--and she's in the movie. So when you say ""sold out"" I'm not 100% what that means...there's always going to be a showing or two where people may still be able to get in (maybe midday matinee where most people are still at work), but essentially all the premiere and primetime weekend stuff is a done deal. Plus the movie already broke records as the highest selling Marvel film ever in presales. And as far as sales tracking, as of Jan 31st its expected to make $100-$120M opening weekend. That was 2 weeks ago with tickets still being sold at an exponential rate; so that range is higher. I feel the movie has sold so well based on what I said previously--that you have a huge contingent of straight up movie go-ers that thing the film looks cool and wants to see what its all about; you have the comic book and Marvel/MCU contingent of fans that are hype to see the next installment in this Phase of MCU films and are fans of the Black Panther characters; black people, especially children, who have never seen any form of black hero (regardless of gender expression) on screen in a live action film, let alone something on this scale. So basically--everyone across ethnicities, age, gender, and interests want to see this movie. AllHipHop.com: Talk to me about Crown Wakanda and why it is so important. Tatiana King Jones: Crown Wakanda seeks to use the Black Panther film as a catalyst to further education and empowerment. We're having a big private screening of the film with red carpet entrance and VIP treatment for our guests. That expanded to hosting a free screening for youth on Feb 16th where they can also enjoy a premium screening experience but with free popcorn and soda. The Brooklyn NAACP provides the opportunity for kids through their youth council program. The ""Crown Wakanda Curriculum"" as we call it involves a visit to Weeksville Heritage Center to learn about one of the first free-Black communities in America located in what is now modern day Crown Heights, Brooklyn to learn what came before them. They then screen the film and get an opportunity to participate in STEM workshops to ""Build Your Own Wakanda"".  They will work with city planners, engineers, and architects to create real city models based on concepts they are taught and the details they've learned from their Weeksville tour. We then seek to couple this with a greater understanding of Afrofuturism and how it ties in to the greater African Diaspora--with Black Panther as the inspiration. Our first tour was on Feb 10th. Brooklyn NAACP will host the workshops through March, so we're using Crown Wakanda as the vehicle to raise money to extend it beyond that time and provide more screening opportunities for more youth. GoFundMe: https://www.gofundme.com/crown-wakanda-curriculum/ .  The whole point is to build a self-sustaining vehicle both in Crown Wakanda and the youth we're looking to influence and inspire. We are completely convinced that once they see Black Panther (we saw it back in January) that their world-view and self-view will change dramatically. So we want to supply them the tools to take their experience beyond a movie watching event and enrich them further. AllHipHop.com: What made you pick the Weeksville Heritage Center as the location for this event? Tatiana King Jones: Through discussion and collaboration with Brooklyn NAACP. They identified and expressed the ties Weeksville had to the ""Build Your Own Wakanda"" initiative so we're tying in the entertainment aspect. Not enough people (including ourselves) even knew Weeksville existed let alone is right in the middle of Brooklyn--so its important to raise the profile of that space, support it, and teach our youth of what was there before and what is possible now and in the future. Weeksville could have been considered the Wakanda of Brooklyn.  AllHipHop.com: Any early feedback from the kids? Tatiana King Jones: The kids that attended the tour on the 10th were very into visiting Weeksville and asked tons of questions about the community and what it represented. They were also incredibly excited that they get to go to see Black Panther for free. They're super appreciative of everything and we just want to make a tangible impact in their lives. AllHipHop.com: Any last words or things you want to add? Tatiana King Jones: We are appreciative of the overwhelming love and support we've already received as well as the partnerships between Brooklyn NAACP, Black Girl Nerds, Universal FanCon, Blerdsmeet and more. We've even partnered with several groups in St. Kitts and Nevins ( Market Street Community Development Group) to help them also send youth to see the movie for free, as well as help them develop curriculum. Crown Wakanda started as a response to jokes about people ""dressing up like they're in Coming to America"" and evolved into spreading upliftment and empowerment within the black community by the black community. We seek to introduce and reconnect African Americans to the greater African Diaspora. ​ ​ Amazing movie to watch. I have recently watched it and its pretty awesome movie.

Slated to be released on February 18th is “Full Frequency,” his sixth official studio offering; which boasts interesting collaborations from artists including Damian Marley, Iggy Azalea, and American emcees Nicki Minaj, 2 Chainz, and Juicy J.  We spoke with Sean about his reintroduction to a new audience, recent triumphs, and plans for the future: AllHipHop: You were directly responsible for popularizing dancehall in entirely different countries; how do you feel about the direction that the genre has taken? Sean Paul: It has grown way bigger than when I first started. I think that the state of dancehall is bigger, but just like the music industry itself, sales have dropped. Do you stay in tune with the younger generations potentially following your footsteps?  I’m actually really proud of the kids now coming up in the arena. A lot of people are out of touch with what they’re actually doing. Are there any trends that you’ve noticed or different sets of challenges that you’re seeing them encounter?  As I said, sales have dropped as a lot of tracks have become digital. You definitely need to have a team around you, and know how to work in this new market. I’ve learned to adapt and write music that works on the internet as well. Fans will finally see collaboration between yourself and Damian Marley, what took so long for this to finally occur?  It was just timing. I’d been going to his studio already, but we wanted to wait until we had the big one. We also just had a concert together recently, on the “Reggae Cruise.” How did you actually go about choosing which artists you wanted to work with on this project?  I don’t necessarily go out searching to work with certain artists. I like dope people and I like to work with people that want to work with me. With 2 Chainz I went to the studio but ended up playing basketball with him. It was pretty cool, just a natural and organic link. It just worked. There are strong ties between Caribbean and African music, especially as Ghana’s Azono scene has exploded; do you see yourself working with any artists in connection with it?  I’ve worked with Afro beats artists, one in particular who’s from Ghana but based out of England. I’m always open to it. A lot of people have already decided on their own version of what Jamaican life is like; is there anything that you hate about the portrayal of it?  I know school teachers, those involved in urban Jamaican life; there are people working two jobs, real upstanding people that are just trying to come up. People only want to see one aspect of the country, not the grimy or the real shit. We don’t want to push this tourist, paradise fantasy, but nobody wants to always be portrayed in a negative, stereotypical way either. What do you think your legacy in the game will be?Life is harsh and hard. My music puts you in a good mood and just makes you dance. The love that I get just for this is amazing. Your latest project “Full Frequency” is set to drop February 18th, only a few weeks away; can we look forward to anything else from you this year?I have two other dancehall oriented projects on the way as well. Can we look forward to seeing you in the States more frequently?  [Laughs] I would love to. I haven’t done a major tour there since 2009, but did a smaller tour of House of Blues venues in 2012. For 2014 I’m looking forward to it. But make sure you look out for the Arsenio Hall show on February 13th with me and (fellow Jamaican artist) Konshens.

87,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/dear-migos-bizzy-bone-of-bone-thugs-n-harmony-has-something-to-tell-you-rSmrrS06GUeUi4_mu4dubg/,"Bizzy Bone is back with vengeance. The legend talks about his new single, “Carbon Monoxide” (Migos/21 Savage diss), dropping new music all year long and more. (AllHipHop Feature): There are not many that can claim collaborations with the likes of late greats such as, 2Pac, The Notorious Big, Big Pun and Eazy-E, as well as the legendary Phil Collins. That is a title that legendary Cleveland, Ohio based group, Bone Thugs N Harmony can claim exclusively. Discovered by, Eazy-E in the early 90’s, BTNH has maintained a career that has lasted for two and a half decades. Their 1994 debut album, Creepin on ah Come Up, was a certified classic as was their sophomore effort, E. 1999 Eternal. In 1997 the group won a Grammy for their hit single, “Tha Crossroads.” The fast rapping, tongue twisting melodic sounds of the group soon became a staple in the music industry and was often imitated but never duplicated. The group compiled of, Bizzy, Krayzie, Layzie and Wish are truly living legends who broke barriers with their contrasting sound and talk of Ouija boards during the early part of their careers. A limitless list of hits and classic studio albums will assure the group a solid place in several musical Hall of Fame venues. I had the chance to speak with BTNH member, Bizzy Bone about his new single, “Carbon Monoxide,” taking aim at Migos and 21 Savage, his desire to put out new music this year and much more. AllHipHop: It’s always an honor to speak to a legend. You are truly a legend and I appreciate your time. Bizzy Bone: Thank you very much. I appreciate that, man. The honor is mine. I appreciate you guys covering the stuff that we putting out. It’s back and forth. The feeling is mutual, my brother. AllHipHop: “Carbon Monoxide,” is a well thought out diss track aimed at guys like 21 Savage and Migos. You referred to them as “culture killers,” on that track. Could you elaborate on that line? Bizzy Bone: We need to start with the history of it, so it don’t just look like I’m going in on these motherf#ckas. It started off to where, a lot of the people that love, Bone Thugs N Harmony as a group was coming at me and saying, “Did you hear what they said? Did you hear what they said?” They were trying to amp it up. So, I did a live Facebook video and throughout that whole Facebook I was sending out love, you know what I’m saying. I was uplifting them etcetera etcetera. There were certain people who were taking snippets of what I said and putting a title, “Bizzy disses the Migos,” so on and so forth just for click bait. That’s when it started to take off. What I felt like was, if some people are trying that hard to make it like I’m saying something bad to these boys, then they must be feeling something in their spirit. Let that sizzle in your spirit. So, after all that was said and done, “Big Boy” get them on an interview and basically ask the young cat, “Qua” “So, ya’ll still feel ya’ll are the biggest group?” Once again, he said it with a little extra authority after people had took what I said out of context. So that’s when Layzie got upset. And then that’s when dude said something about fucking the homie wife and your money this and your money not looking right and throw up some money. And then that’s when the record came out. Everybody was talking shit about the record and that’s when people were like, “B, we really not trying to hear nothing from you, but what’s going on now.” So, fast forward to where I pull out the “Elmer Fudd,” (the shotgun) on the live video stream. Again, everybody is trying to say, “He pulled out a gun on live and was talking…” I ain’t said nobodies name. But they really-really-really wanted that issue. So, after all of that, that’s when I decided to go ahead and make “Carbon Monoxide” and really shut things down to the point where I’m like, “Okay, what are we talking about now? What’s up?”  Now, as far as them killing the culture, I think it’s starting to manifest itself and it’s starting to take a life of its own. We already know the gentleman, “St. Laurent” not even from America. So, we get that. You pushing pills, you pushing lean, so on and so forth and you not from here. Now we got people in Africa that think that lean is what we do. They have people dying out there because of that because they think that’s what rappers in America is doing. So that’s one thing. Pushing pills and drugs to the kids. It’s deeper than killing our culture, it’s killing our kids. But I could understand being young. I’m still for uplifting our people because they are still my people. We still from the same gang. We are still from the understanding that we are people of color. So therefore, we must support each other as well, but it’s still there in saying all of that. I decided to address that issue just because it had got to the point… man, you can’t say you done f#cked the homie wife and talk about money and all of this. I’m alright. I’m good, so let me address this. AllHipHop: Do you feel like that has become the younger generations go-to? Money this or money that, especially when they are going at the guys that came before them. Bizzy Bone: I think that sometimes it’s an excuse. It’s like dealing with a stupid bitch or a stupid girl. Pardon my language, I just call them bitch because I don’t know their name and bitch is a name. Instead of her intelligence, instead of her class or her respect for herself, she’ll just put her ass in front of the camera and get all of the likes that she wants. They not liking your personality “boo-boo” they liking your ass. But when she opens up her motherfucking mouth, you realize you dealing with a dumb ass motherfucka. That’s how I look at motherfuckas putting money in it or other issues when rap has always been a sport. It’s always been a sport and if you’re going to claim boldly, that you’re the best doing it, then just be prepared to prove it. And if you’re not prepared to prove it, then dude quit saying it. You’re saying that strongly. You making people mad as fuck, bruh. Then when you can’t prove it and me putting put this new single, “Carbon Monoxide” everybody got blinders on. Now it’s the “Bird Box Challenge.” But they doing little stuff in the background with your lil companies, like trying to address it with their lil companies and shit; which is some backdoor, barnyard and shit as well. It could mean something, or it could not. But yeah, when people throw up the money and everything other than what we are talking about, that’s just to hide the fact that on paper you’re a 4th grader.  AllHipHop: “Carbon Monoxide” confirms that you not only still got it, but you never lost it. It also confirms that we need some more music from, Bizzy Bone. Is it helpful every now and then to have someone pull on your coattail to force your hand to put that pen to paper? Bizzy Bone: No, I don’t need anyone pulling my coattail. The last project that I came out with was with,
“Krayzie.” I put out some singles because the game is singles. I have done various projects with a few different people in the industry. I have put out a few movies. But it’s definitely time for some more Bizzy Bone music and it’s going to happen all year long. I been cooking for about a year and a half with my production team and my kids. I been cooking with my boys. As you know we did the Wiz Khalifa. We dropped the, Wiz Khalifa track, we dropped the “Berner” track. We been cooking. But it don’t take nobody pulling my coattail. I’m just a musician. I be up late at night while my baby sleep and my girl sleeping or what not. It be 3-4 in the morning and my creative juices start flowing and I’ll write like 3 or 4 songs. That’s just me. AllHipHop: I spoke to the OG, Spice 1 and he said, no group with 2-years of popularity should ever go at a group who have enjoyed a 30-year fan base. Do you feel there is a lack of respect or disconnect from the cats who are just getting their break? Bizzy Bone: I feel like that is there. But I tend not to pay attention to that because the more you shine light on it the more, you’re giving that foolishness shine. With social media, it’s electronics. It’s one or two things, positivity or negativity; that’s it. It’s a positive charge or a negative charge. There is only two currents. When it’s something that is blatantly out there and obviously wrong as f#ck, people will tend to gravitate to it. So, not shining light on it, tends to not trend. So, it’s a samurai game to this social media sh#t. That’s very-very important. You just gotta be a f#cking ninja. You gotta samurai that sh#t. AllHipHop: How different is it for you to put music out on YouTube and streaming sites because when you guys first came out it was nothing like it is today. Is it just a matter of adjusting to the times? Bizzy Bone: Yeah, you definitely gotta adjust. It’s what life is, man. You go from tapes, to VHS, to CD’s, DVD’s to iPhones. Technology has not stopped progressing. We’re 10-years ahead of ourselves technologically wise already right now. That’s just what we already have. Yeah, it’s just adjustment. Your samurai game just gotta be on. AllHipHop: The “Carbon Monoxide” track is a certified diss track and I feel like we don’t get a whole lot of that anymore. You put a lot of thought into it. This just wasn’t an on the surface attack. I thought it was really dope. Bizzy Bone: You have… it’s just like back in the day. Take the East Coast for example. You had Eric B. and Rakim and you had Kid ‘N Play. These guys now are more Kid ‘N Play with dance and they are more fun. But as soon as they start trying to get deep, everybody is like, “That’s not you, bro. What the f#ck are you talking deep for? That ain’t what the fuck we want to hear from you.” I think that that’s where you start to see them decline. When they start really trying to act like they are really deep on some sh#t, you’re really not. You’re a pill popper, my love. You sip lean. You snort coke. That’s what you do. That’s just what you do. You talk about guns, repeat yourself a whole bunch of times and you adlib the f#ck out of yourself. That’s just what you do. You make people dance. You got the right amount of DJ’s and your region is just real hot right now. There is nothing wrong with that. I don’t think it is lack of creativity, it’s just, the party music ain’t never been battle music. It’s never been battle music. Kid ‘N Play dare not battle Eric B. and Rakim. They better not or they going to lose every time. Eric B. and Rakim are the streets and Kid ‘N Play secular, it’s TV, it gloss and dancing. And there is nothing wrong with that because we need that too. I think it’s just the lane that they drive. I don’t think it’s a yes or no answer, I think it’s just the lane that they are in. Once they start trying to get deep, that’s when they fuck up. AllHipHop: You said that we could expect music all year from you. Do you have a timeline or are you just going to be dropping things here and there throughout the year? Bizzy Bone: All year long for sure. Right now, we’re doing the “Carbon Monoxide Challenge.” We are on the “Carbon Monoxide run. We got another one coming within the next couple of weeks; actually, I believe next week is when we are going to premier it. We are going to premier the video on the 9th and it will go up on sale as well the following week. Then we got the next single coming, “Running From One Time,” but right now we are running with “Carbon Monoxide,” then we got “Enigma” coming, “Running From One Time,” and then “Cleveland” coming. We have a bevy of other songs that’s going to be coming out all year. All year we’re going to be dropping singles that builds up to the project. That’s just what we’re doing. I’m introducing “Bloodline Harmony” as you guys know is my kids… my sons. I’m introducing my niece, Ajanae into the game. She’s going to be on some of this upcoming music. I’m introducing my producer, Blais who is also an artist.

The unique docu-series gave viewers a raw, inside look at the record label that pushed West Coast Hip Hop to outright dominance with a concentration on the label's artistic geniuses, conflicts, and court cases. 'Death Row Chronicles' gave firsthand knowledge and commentary from not only Suge Knight  himself, but also from those on the world's most infamous record label,  and those that knew the roster and no-nonsense label head the best. Death Row Records was living large as they changed the face of music with a massive impact.  The  series and narrative alone prove to be a cautionary tale of what can  happen when a label, its leadership, artists, and street politics  all spiral out of control.  Though  the series did highlight some of the label's turbulent past, it emerges  as one of the most balanced and objective documentaries that we've seen  on the subject of Death Row and Tupac's murder. Although  'DRC' sheds light on some of Suge Knight's run-ins with the law and  alleged violent rumors and myths, the series also painted Suge as a  brilliant businessman and people's champ. Viewers are taken through the journey of the label from Suge's introduction into the music business, the success of Dr. Dre's 'The Chronic' along with Snoop Dogg's 'Doggystyle', the addition of Tupac [to the label], to the demise of the label and the departure of its artists, the death of Shakur, and the imprisonment of Knight. Death  Row's story is told by a montage of commentary and [sometimes archival]  interviews by Death Row artists, journalists, professors, label heads,  former security guards, and even former interns. The documentary also included various reenactments of legendary Death Row stories.  Suge Knight, Kurupt, Danny Boy, and Michel'le are a few of those featured in the documentary who give their versions of what happened back then. “We  traced [Knight’s] evolution from a guy from Compton, who was not   necessarily associated with gangs, who had a promising football career,   then his left turn to music. He learns how to influence people,   sometimes through intimidating tactics, sometimes because he’s just so   business savvy. And then [we look at] how he steered Death Row, what  things helped to make it great and what things he did to bring it down,”  said Mario Diaz, executive producer of the series. The  documentary served as a platform for many involved with Death Row to  tell their truths, and it truly gave Suge an opportunity to debunk a  number of violent and aggressive myths associated with himself and the label. While  it was always believed to be much craziness, media hype, and menacing  appeal surrounding the label, 'Death Row Chronicles' shows  that it  seems to have been all of the above.    Hip Hop fans were reminded here of how all of Death Row's releases were huge hits, but the label was still spiraling out of control which was evident with so many criminal cases pending against it's members.  Perhaps  the most intriguing part of the series was the firsthand eye-witness  account of Tupac's murder by Keffe D. Keffe essentially alluded to and seems to confess to his nephew, Orlando Anderson, being the one to pull the  trigger in Tupac's murder. ICYMI watch all of the episodes on BET.com now!

The spectacle drew a huge audience of 14,069, the second largest boxing draw at the popular New York venue. (Thurman vs. Garcia boasts the highest attendance number for boxing at Barclays Center.) Even though Wilder personifies bad intentions in the ring, outside of the ring he was a class act. “A true champion always finds a way to come back and that’s what I did tonight. Luis Ortiz is definitely a crafty guy. He put up a great fight. We knew we had to wear him down. I showed everyone I can take a punch,” Wilder stated in the post-fight press conference. “When he leaves tonight Ortiz can hold his head high. He gave the fans a hell of a fight. Continuing, the Alabamian said, “He was hitting me with those furious punches but they didn’t have sting on them. He was throwing combos that knocked me off balance. I just had to get my range back and my fundamentals back. And I was able to do that. I showed I was a true champion tonight.” Wilder’s recollections may have omitted the 7th round.  Saturday night meant more than his 40th professional win – Ortiz also presented Wilder with his toughest test thus far. Wilder appeared out on his feet after Ortiz hurt the champion with a barrage of blows in the 7th round. It seemed that Oritz had a great shot at taking the crown.  Ortiz continued to assault the into the 8th, but failed to drop Wilder. Eventually, Wilder found his legs. He then unfurled a vicious attack that dropped the Cuban fighter in the10th round. Wilder would pummel Ortiz, dropping him again. After a hellacious uppercut, the referee. Wilder floored the Cuban challenger twice in the round, forcing referee David Fields to stop the fight at 2:05 of the round. Wilder talked about his fearless resolve.  “I just showed that I can punch on the inside as well, too. A lot of people don’t think I can punch on the inside, but I showed them,” he said. “Now I can say there’s no man that stepped in the ring that I haven’t put on their ass.”  “Luis Ortiz was one of those fighters that everyone ducked, even champions ducked him. I wondered why it took so long for him to get a title shot and now we know. “I’m ready right now. I always said that I want to unify. I’m ready whenever those guys are. I am the baddest man on the planet and I proved that tonight. This solidified my position at the top of the food chain tonight.” Ortiz spoke to the press with his daughters in tow. “I feel fine. I did receive a right hand, but I’m OK,” he stated with his translator to his left. “I was listening to the directions that my corner was giving me. In this sport, any punch can end a fight. In the ring anything can happen.” Wow! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Nx8RUut1MWhen he walks right up to them and stretches out his arm no head can stop it. This kid is the real deal. I love watching him let his arm go. It's so long and he's so strong the power that comes off his punches is incredible.

From the tradition of great Detroit musical artists like Diana  Ross, Smokey Robinson, Stevie Wonder, Aaliyah, Eminem, and J. Dilla,  emerges “The D’s” next creative representatives Hip Hop group Clear Soul  Forces. Clear Soul Forces consists of emcees E-Fav, L.A.Z., Noveliss, and  rapper/producer Ilajide. The four-man group released the well-received  digital album Detroit Revolution(s) in 2012 and now are about to drop their latest LP Gold PP7’s. The same way the Gold PP7 gun in the GoldenEye 007  video game takes out any opponent, CSF hope this new collection of  music slays anyone who doubts their drive to takeover the rap game. “The meaning of the title is just that fact that a Gold PP7 gun is a  one shot kill,” explains Noveliss. “Everything that has to do with this  project, everything that we do, we just feel like it’s just a one shot  kill. Beats, rhymes, anything we do is a one shot kill.”  Gold PP7s Album Cover The collective was formed after L.A.Z. moved to Michigan to attend  Oakland University. He eventually met E-Fav who introduced him to his  cousin Ilajide. L.A.Z. and Ilajide then began recording tracks together  before E-Fav decide to pick up the mic as well. As separate acts they  each performed at a local showcase thrown by Robo Rob. It was at that  event where they connected with Noveliss. The story goes the four rhymers, still not an official group at this  point, spit for fellow Detroit emcee Royce Da 5’9 at a studio one night,  and Royce suggested that they combine their talents. With that E-Fav,  L.A.Z., Noveliss, and Ilajide formed what would later become known as  Clear Soul Forces. “It’s kind of wild the way that we came together and met,” says L.A.Z. “A lot of it is just luck and fate.” While the group’s star in the music world continues to rise, regular  life for the members has not changed too greatly. They still work day  jobs as they record tracks at night in order to support themselves and  their families, but it probably won’t be long before their bosses have  to hire replacements. “For us a lot of this sh*t that has come with the album is like a  fallacy, because life ain’t really change for us from how things move on  a day-to-day basis,” says L.A.Z. “We’ve had success with [Detroit Revolution(s)], but people  got to remember we’re a four-man group, and we got a manager too. That’s  already a five way split, and we ain’t talking about no major, millions  of dollars where even if it’s split it’s life altering. It’s  maintenance money, keep the ship afloat,” adds E-Fav. The guys may not  be millionaires at the moment, but according to one member their real  worth is greater than their current bank accounts. “We got million dollar f*cking raps. N*ggas with a million dollars  don’t even rap like this, and they can’t even rap like this,” states  Ilajide. “We rap better than them, so we deserve their f*cking money.”  Clear Soul Forces are not reserved about their opinion of the current mainstream rap scene. They cover that topic throughout Gold PP7’s  specifically on the track “War Drums.” The song includes a skit where  Noveliss performs a freestlyed impression of Arnold Schwarzenegger that  takes comedic shots at rappers who pop bottles and mollies. “I went in there and did that sh*t one time, and it came out like  that. It was funny,” says Noveliss. “Hip Hop don’t exist in the  mainstream. That’s how I feel. There is no such thing as mainstream Hip  Hop. It’s f*cking commercial rap, and that sh*t sucks d*ck.” E-Fav reinforces Noveliss’ perspective that real Hip Hop does not  have a voice in the mainstream, “They’re rapping good and sh*t, and the  beats are not bad, but they’re not Hip Hop records. They’re commercial  rap records. They’re meant to be sold. Hip Hop records, I feel like they  are just made to be enjoyed versus just to be sold. That’s just my  opinion.” Some of the Hip Hop acts that do get regular rotation from CSF are  The Roots, Slum Village, OutKast, Redman, and Method Man. They  appreciate the work of these artists, but say that they get most  inspired by each other. The camaraderie between the four emcees is  evident through their music and at their live shows.  Clear Soul Forces live at Public Assembly  At a recent concert in Erie, Pennsylvania, Noveliss altered the  group’s set a bit when he decided to punch Ilajide and L.A.Z. in the  stomach right on stage as they were rapping. The prank did not stop  Ilajide from flowing, but L.A.Z. had the wind knock out of him. It is  these type of crazy antics that fans can expect to see at a CSF  performance. “We be catching the f*cking holy ghost on stage. You never seen that  sh*t before,” expresses Ilajide. “N*ggas be knocking each other out.  N*ggas be choking each other. N*ggas be beating each other up. We just  be f*cking wild. That sh*t be cold.” Clear Soul Forces are heading out on their first European tour which  includes stops in Amsterdam, London, and Paris. They also book their own  shows in their hometown with other acts from the city, but according to  E-Fav fans in Los Angeles may not get to see the group in the near  future.  “We’re supposedly blackballed from doing shows in L.A.,” reveals  E-Fav. “I don’t know if this is true, but this is supposed stuff. This  is what people say.” “It’s a lot of motherf*ckers that went out of their way to make sure  that we didn’t get on stages for shows and put in extra effort to make  sure that we weren’t able to do things that would have put us in a  better position,” says L.A.Z. explaining why he addressed concert  promoters on Gold PP7’s. “That sh*t just stems from the politics, all the politics in the game. Sh*t is wack.” Even with haters trying to hold them back Clear Soul Forces have an  objective to breakthrough the obstacles and leave a mark in Hip Hop as  both a group and as individuals. The Gold PP7’s album is just  one step towards CSF’s goal. Expect more music videos (the first being  for the track “Freq Freq”), perhaps another album, and eventually solo  projects from the Detroit collective over the next several months. “We got another project in the chamber. I don’t want to say sh*t, but  Noveliss is going to be doing some solo sh*t. I’m going to be doing  some solo sh*t. L.A.Z. is going to be doing some solo sh*t, and so is  E-Fav. We’re just going to be taking the f*ck over. 2014’s going to be  crazy,” says Ilajide. Clear Soul Forces’ Gold PP7’s will be available September 17th via Fat Beats Records.

This is false and a long-running rumor that the group had denounced as pure conjecture.  (AllHipHop Features) When I say this had to be one of my favorite interviews, I definitely mean it. AllHipHop.com had the phenomenal opportunity to connect with one of Hip-Hop's most notable trio, Digable Planets. They made their way to Washington D.C. for a make-up show at the Howard Theatre, and per usual, the vibe was real. In case you didn't know, Digable Planets is a trio comprised of Butterfly, Ladybug Mecca, and Doodlebug that grew to national prominence in the early 1990's with their smooth, jazzy form of Hip-Hop. Their first two album, Reachin' (A New Refutation of Time and Space), went gold, but it was the single that immortalized them. ""Rebirth of Slick (Cool Like Dat)"" was an award-winning, gold selling smash hit that also went gold in 1993. Their second album Blowout Comb was a far more dark, political opus that eventually lead to their dissolution. Digable Planets broke up in 1995, then briefly reunited in 2005, and last performed together in 2011. In 2016, the group reunited once and for all. We sat down with Ishmael ""Butterfly"" Butler, Mary Ann ""Ladybug Mecca"" Vieira, and Craig (Cee) ""Doodlebug"" Irving to discuss their reunion and the subsequent tour. We also got their take on music today and their excitement to rock the stage together on their old stomping grounds of Washington, D.C. AllHipHop: I’m so sorry, but yes, I must start with the generic question. How did you all meet? Butterfly: It's ironic to be here in D.C. really, because it's where a lot of this started, c being here and mac being from here and I would always see c when I would be down here from Philly or New York. We would always see each other at the parties, but I think we formally met in Philly Cee: Yea, during our college days, yea we would see each other at the parties, and I actually knew you from back in the day before I met him. Point at Ladybug... Ladybug: Oh really? Before you met him? See I didn't know that? (jokingly) AllHipHop: How does it feel to be back on tour and being back in D.C. performing? Ladybug: It's a good feeling, we’ve been touring for about 1 year now on and off, and it's cool. Were a lot older now, the b and is really dope, the energy is good. And Being in dc is special for me because you know I’m from the DMV. and it's kind of surreal. I was walking the streets and this guy was yelling out of the speakers about Go-go and Puerto Rico and it great to experience that type of time travel earlier today. So, it was good. It's good to link up with them again and we're moving forward. AllHipHop: What's it like performing for your fans, especially as a reunited group? Ladybug: Performing and connecting with the fans is what it's about. And that energy exchange is probably one of the most important things to me. Aside from making the music AllHipHop: What is your most memorable performance experience: Butterfly: James brown and Sade at the Apollo theatre it was in Brazil and my mom came and I remember we had to wait after his show for him to get his hair done, it was crazy but I remember how excited my mom was, because he was like her generation’s Michael Jackson. I remember her face on that day. Ladybug: Yes, definitely when we opened for Sade’ I remember learning about her, buying the cassette for my walkman, and then getting the news that she wants us to open for her. It was dope. AllHipHop: Why do you think rebirth of slick is such a multi-generational song that can be played at any time? Cee: Music is opinionated sometimes. Different vibes resonate with people in different ways, and you feel it in your soul and luckily, we were able to hit something, a mark with everyone because I think its originality. Maybe even timing, because what would that song do if it came out today. But you know, good music is timeless. Our music is different and you get how genuine and authentic it is. Butterfly: I agree with that AllHipHop: Speaking of timeless music, how do you feel about the music today? The Rap and hip-hop, are you enjoying it or miss how music used to be? Butterfly: I like a lot of the music now. The music is always going to represent the social times that the people lived in. We lived in a time where we were coming from our parents were in the movement and thinking about civil rights. These kid’s parents were coming from off Facebook. Ha-ha it’s not bad, it just what it was. So, music is more about fast surface stuff, you know what I mean. But a lot of it is good. It’s like good ideas, crazy ideas. I like Ladybug: Me too, I like seeing a level of camaraderie between the artists that I didn't really notice before. I like Travis Scott, Kendrick, Frank Ocean, I’m really feeling them. Cee: I don't really have an opinion. I just don't really have an opinion about it. I couldn't even name anybody and I listen to what I like to listen to. Stay in my own music bubble. AllHipHop: What do you think sets you all apart from other groups or artists now or today. Butterfly: I don't know if it sets us apart, but what makes us who we are which is going to be unique, is the mere fact if you can image there are ups and downs, but we're here. You know what I’m saying. It takes your own will but other wills too. It happens for us. That unique. You know a lot of group can’t even get to that point even. And you got to have passion for what it is. Ladybug: I agree with what he's saying. The fact that we are who we are, we are unique together. it’s not better or worse, it just it. And the root is definitely the passion Also, the time we got together, it was a rich time. You would be around that of the most electric and explosive people, and you carry that and it helps you in your personal life, and we're lucky to be here. AllHipHop: I thank you so much for chatting with me, it is an honor and a blessing.

However, a tragedy five years ago led to the Gaithersburg, Maryland native to step behind the microphone. “My homie ‘Gino’ Cosgrove passed in 2011. He was doing the whole rap thing, and I would try to manage him - you know, set him up with producers and studio time, sh-t like that,” Ace explains to AllHipHop.com. “When he passed, I started to live at my homie Shane’s house where he had a studio set up. I would just see a bunch of rappers come by, and I kind of just started rapping myself.” While Washington’s Hip Hop scene has been building its reputation over the last several years, at the time Ace began rapping, the city was mostly getting national press for political battles and the controversy over the football team’s mascot. A young Cosgrove initially had to travel outside of The District to locations like New York and Philadelphia in order to gather fans for his growing brand. DC is now demanding the attention of the Hip Hop industry. Ace is a member of a collective of local artists known as Hostile Youth, a unit helping to raise awareness about the talent surging in the nation’s capital.  “My homie Hassani Kwess had the whole Hostile Youth thing already going. I met him, Vaunfe, and Black Diamond through Uno Hype. We just started connecting and making music together,” Cosgrove states. Besides DC, the DMV region is also composed of another major city in Baltimore, Maryland. Forty miles to the north of Washington is the site where Freddie Gray fell into a coma while in police custody and later died as a result of the questionable treatment by BPD officers. The 25-year-old’s death led to a youth driven uprising and the State's Attorney charging six officers with various crimes. Beatles legend John Lennon is quoted saying, “I think the music reflects the state that the society is in.” The current state of American society involves necessary public conversations about police brutality and social justice. Cosgrove personifies Lennon’s declaration by using his music to confront the relevant issues his generation has had to face. In particular, the song ""Freddies Dead"" addresses the anger many young people felt after learning of the circumstances of Gray’s killing. “I think what happened in the Freddie Gray case is sad as f-ck. I think music is the most powerful thing in the world,” says Ace. “So as a Hip Hop artist, I think it’s my job to express with my music what other people are feeling but are scared to say.” The 24-year-old performer is not afraid to speak on the subject of spirituality either. His catalog features cuts like ""Lost Of Faith"" and “Lord Have Mercy.” The latter song has a hook where Ace announces “the devil couldn’t stop me.” Those are not just inconsequential lyrics. The words represent a personal mentality that drives the man who recites them. “Religion plays a big role. I'm not a super-religious person, meaning I don't go to church every Sunday, but to me I feel like I made it this far because of my guardian angels and hard work,” responds Cosgrove when asked about the role of religion in his creative process. “I think sometimes when we as humans reach a low point we tend to lose our faith, so I talk a lot about that in my music.” Like any person walking this Earth, Ace Cosgrove experiences moments of dejection and disappointment. On his song “Burning Slums,” he opens up about having to deal with individuals around him being jealous of the productive moves happening in his life. However, the ascending rhymer is attempting to avoid those resentful cynics in his outer circle.  “I'm a pretty distant person to begin with, so I deal with envious people by just saying, ‘F-ck it, f-ck them. I'm going to make the music even better and see if they are more envious when I drop this new sh-t.’ I've always been the type to not need people in my life anyways. If they stick around, cool. If not, f-ck em. They can eat a d-ck,” Cosgrove declares. The number of haters surely rose when Ace’s 2014 song “Making Moves” was featured during a recent episode of House Of Lies. The popular Showtime series starring Don Cheadle and Kristen Bell selected the track for the season five premiere which aired earlier this month. “Making Moves” has currently totaled over 24,000 plays on SoundCloud. Going by the user comments on SC or the top search suggestions on Google, House Of Lies sent a large number of listeners in Cosgrove’s direction. “I got connected to House Of Lies through ‘the plug’ [laughs],” says Ace.  He continues, “My reaction [to the song’s placement on the show] was just like, ‘Yes, I'm doing something right here.’ I think the song started picking up a lot because of House Of Lies. The song is almost two years old. Before the House Of Lies placement, the views were much lower than that, so shout out to the plug.” More tunes from A.C. are on the way. Just this week he dropped his Lil Jon & The East Side Boyz inspired single “Bia-Bia” produced by Super Miles. A follow-up effort to Baby Need Food is inevitable, and other festival appearances such as the one at Broccoli City is likely in the future as well. As his fan base expands, Ace Cosgrove is ready to take on the position as one of the musical leaders of the DMV. But don’t look for the creator to become part of the paparazzi culture that dominates entertainment news at the moment. His focus is the artistry not the fame. He conveys, “I never want to get super-duper famous to where I'm in TMZ every other day. I just want to make really epic music that inspires people, move to London, and get paid well because of it.”  Read other installments of AllHipHop’s #DMVOnTheMove series here.

96,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/doctor-boyce-watkins-how-to-create-a-brand-and-make-money-part-1-LplBg_xluE2pACK3Fv0_Cg/,"AllHipHop.com: Explain to our audience who is Dr. Boyce Watkins? Dr. Boyce Watkins: Well, I will say that he is a black man. He is a man that loves his family, and that believes in doing his best, believes in doing what he can for his community, believes in the power of intellect, the power of thinking. I like to think a lot, you know, and there's always something to think about. There's always something intellectual happening around you, no matter what. So, I enjoy just processing life. Life is a university, in my mind, and there's always a lesson, you know. It depends on whether or not you pay attention to it, you know what I'm saying? AllHipHop.com: Yes, sir. Dr. Boyce Watkins: And I would say that's pretty much who I am, as a person. AllHipHop.com: How did you become so popular as it relates to the hip-hop culture? You've got such a big digital footprint now. And I'm like how did you do this? Dr. Boyce Watkins: Well, most stuff like this tends to come from planning and energy. About maybe, about 12 years ago, I kind of started off on a journey where my goal was to see how I could play my role in uplifting my community, right? So, I left my job and I just said you know what? The internet is here. The technology is dope. It's a great opportunity to turn the world into a classroom. It's not just a university, but it's also a great problem, because there's students everywhere. People are learning all the time. So, I just pretty much took what I was doing inside the university, and I translated that into pop culture and what was happening in the world. And then, on top of that, marketing is important. Yeah. So, in order to build the brand, whenever we made money, we'd reinvest a lot of it to push the message further. So the way I kind of think about wealth-building, black power, black economic empowerment, things like that, I think of that as a gospel. You know what I mean? So, if you're a pastor, then that's ... pastors understand it, because I pretty much, I guess you could say, I'm a little bit like a preacher, but I don't try to preach at people. I try to support, and teach, and do what I can to help. AllHipHop.com: So, what did you do, in terms of marketing? What did you do to get the message out? Dr. Boyce Watkins: Well, I paid attention to the latest technology. I tried to hire people who were smarter than me, who knew more than I did. I also studied branding, and the thing that people don't always understand is that fame is manufactured. Like Beyonce, for example, Beyonce is a product. Jay-Z's a product. Just like Coca-Cola's a product. You know? And if you think of it that way, then you understand brand building is the same, across the board, whether you're branding LeBron James or branding laundry detergent. And a lot of us, unfortunately, our limitation, our challenge that we have to overcome as black people, is that we're not trained on that. We're not trained on where brands come from. We think that to be the most famous singer, you have to have the most talent. When we don't understand that there's a million talented singers that no one will ever know about. Shit, it's all about the branding. I had a conversation with a young rapper I mentor, the name's Dre Priest, out of Kentucky. And the first thing I told him, was I said, ""Look man,"" I said, ""If you want to be a respected artist, you need to study business as much as you study music."" I said, ""If you listen to Jay-Z, Jay-Z talks about how I'm a businessman. And I bet you, that if I was to sit down and talk to Jay, we could talk all day about business without even bringing hip hop into the picture. So, every black man in America should go with me to go to business school every single day of his life. Every black woman in America needs to do the same thing, because all this stuff out here in the world is won by economics, making deals, marketing, branding, and all these other fundamentals. The other stuff is just extra. AllHipHop.com: Right. So, was the YouTube videos a part of that strategy? Dr. Boyce Watkins: Oh, hell yeah! AllHipHop.com: I would probably consider you a master YouTuber, by the way. Dr. Boyce Watkins: Oh, well, thank you, brother. I appreciate it, man. You know, they don't let niggas like me on TV. You know, guys like me, I get on TV, I get on radio, if I had a TV show, they would take it away in about two weeks, because the things that I say just don't fit their agenda. So, YouTube was my version ... it's like a digital version of a chitlin circuit, where the chitlin circuit ... you know, you can eat good of a chitlin circuit if you make it work, right? AllHipHop.com: Right. Dr. Boyce Watkins: So, we built up a nice little base. We got about a quarter million subscribers on the YouTube channel. We reach about three million people a month. And we also do a lot through Facebook and all that. It's all about the numbers. It doesn't matter how you reach people, whether you reach them through television, radio or print. What matters is that you reach them. It's just reaching them. So, people were really sleeping on the Internet, and even I slept on it, up until about 2013. If I had actually started it when I planned. I had planned to start all of that back in '07. If I had started in '07, we'd have over a million subscribers, but until 2013 when I really analyzed it and saw the power. And now, the YouTube channel isn't just a great source of revenue, but it's also a tremendous vehicle for just reaching lots and lots of people. So, it worked out pretty well. AllHipHop.com: Well, what I can appreciate about you, is that you have like a good sales strategy leveraging pop culture . Like you know how to do the video teasers really well then drive, people to your website, and i'm like wow, that's pretty clever. Dr. Boyce Watkins: Thank you. AllHipHop.com: How did you meet Dame Dash? Dr. Boyce Watkins: You know, Dame and I met because two things, we were just kind of destined to become friends. One time, I made a quote on my page, where I was talking about a Jewish guy who said that he refers to black people as liquid money. Because the way liquid gold flows through your hands, and they look at black people like they're easy money, because they spend all their money. They give it all away, almost like a ... you know, almost like a cheap hoe, that's just fucking everybody that walks through the door. Like that's how black ... black people literally are the economic whores of America. We're really seen as the people where you get easy money from them, because they don't see the value in what they have. They give it away cheap, because they all want the red bottoms, we want to go to the club, to the movies and all that. And we have a completely warped way of seeing money, sometimes, and it's very unfortunate. But anyway, I had made this quote, and what happened was I guess because Dame and I look alike, they attributed the quote to Dame. And so, Dame, he had told me later, he said, ""Yeah. Everybody was saying, yeah, I liked your quote about liquid money."" He said to me, ""I would tell them,"" he said, ""like man, I didn't say that. I don't know who said that."" You know. So, that happened. And then, Charlemagne, after Dame went on to Breakfast Club, and kind of did his epic interview, which was one of the most classic rants of all time. Charlemagne called me and Charlemagne was like, ""Hey dog. You gotta talk some common sense into people, 'cause now, we got all these people saying I'm gonna quit my job, 'cause they saw Dame saying you ain't a man if you got a job."" I said, one thing I will not do, is I'm not going to bash this man for challenging the manhood of black men in America. See, 'cause black men have been emasculated. When you go to other countries, and you see real men getting married and raising children, going to work every day, starting businesses, busting ass. They ain't in the koonery. It reminds you of just what white supremacy has done to the mindset of the black American male. White supremacy makes the black American man into a little boy, you know? Into a clown, a court jester. He thinks he's supposed to sing and dance, and all this other, and put on wigs and dresses and shit. And that's how he fits in. That's how he survives. And it's not natural. So, long story short, I love Dame's interview, because we need calls to manhood, in that way. But the thing was, with that interview, the goal was like not to bash Dame, which I didn't do, it was to say okay, let's talk about a strategy, so that when you quit your job, you've got a better plan B. And so, at that point, we just kind of became friends. Somebody connected us, and the rest is history, I guess. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUs6cPch_j4 AllHipHop.com: Right. So, was that the tipping point in your career? Dr. Boyce Watkins: So the tipping point in me becoming who I am, was when I was 28 years old, and I was ... I spent many years working very, very hard to turn myself into a white man and to fit in. And I said this shit ain't working. I was in this fucking job, getting yelled at every day. Things weren't working out. My woman had just left me, 'cause I was so busy. I was trying to do this whole academic thing that I didn't give her the time that she needed. So, I was just heartbroken, man, I literally hit rock bottom. Imagine like every area of your life like being totally obliterated, all at the same time. No money. No woman. No nothing. You know, no future. All of that. That was when I kind of just realized that I had to rebuild myself, and I had to rebuild myself in a better way. And the way that I did that was I said you know what? First thing I'm gonna do is make sure that I'm not afraid of being who I am. Because by being who I am, while it's a little risky, what it does, is it gives me a monopoly. You have a monopoly on you. Can't nobody else be you, as well as you can. So, I figured hey, if I commit to being Boyce Watkins, in his entirety, loving him even for his flaws, then I will definitely win on that. I'm gonna be the best in the world at that, because nobody will ever do it better than me. And then, the second tipping point, I guess, in terms of success and things working. I owe a lot, as far as getting out there publicly, I owe a lot to Wendy Williams. In 2006, her and Charlemagne had me on their show a few times. Back when she was doing radio, that really helped through the years. It was really just kind of learning the technology, honestly though. I mean, as far as like building the brand, I can't think of any one moment that sort of just propelled everything forward. It was really just kind of like this day to day grind, when the good thing from being in school for so long, and doing the PhD thing, was that it taught me how to work eight, nine, 10 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 a year, because that's what it takes to be excellent at something. I learned that, because I was sitting in classes with motherfuckers from China and Russia, and places like that. And they never stopped studying. It wasn't like oh, we gonna study three hours and then go to the club. It was like I will study from the time I wake up, until the time I go to bed, and then, I'm gonna go to bed, and then, I'm gonna wake up, and I'm gonna study again. I'm gonna keep going until I get what the fuck I want. And that's something that black people still have to learn. We don't get that yet, and that's really the kind of approach I took to everything. And if you have that approach to life, you're always going to be successful at something. ​  ​ AllHipHop.com: What music would be on your spotify playlist? Dr. Boyce Watkins: Oh, man. You're telling on me now. My buddy, D1. Killer Mike. Of course, Spice 1. Let me see. What else is on my phone? As far as my hip hop stuff goes. TI ... AllHipHop.com: Okay. Dr. Boyce Watkins: I even got a couple old songs from like C-Bo, from back in the day. Yo Gotti and E-40. Well, the thing is I'm real picky with hip hop. Like most songs bore me, right? AllHipHop.com: Right. Dr. Boyce Watkins: But usually, every artist will have like two songs, where I'll be like oh, my God. Loop it so I can listen to it over and over again, and music, you know, it's inspirational. You know, it gives you an energy. So, I'll listen to that ... I'd rather listen to that same song over and over, than to listen to a bunch of wack songs from a whole album, right? So, Yo Gotti and E-40, That's Law, the song they did together. I love that song. AllHipHop.com: Okay. Now, what's up with that guarantee that you made to parents that you were going to make their kids rich, by the time they turned 21? That what I've been hearing. Dr. Boyce Watkins: Well, it's not 21. It's actually 40. The thing is that there's a basic formula. Finance is my thing and I know all the equations, and formulas, and all that. And basically, what I explain to people is if there is a way that your child can have an 80 to 90% chance of being a millionaire by the time they're 40, would you do basic things for them when they're born? Or even before they're born? The key thing is to understand you have two main types of wealth in most people's pockets. There's many split, the two types that people have are either a little bit of money, and everybody has a lot of time. You always have time. The younger you are, the more time you have, and really, in wealth equations, when we do the math to explain how wealth is built, time is the most important variable in that equation. You think about growing a tree. If you give yourself 400 years to grow a big tree, then you've got plenty of time. You can grow a really big tree, right? But if you've only got 10 minutes, you can't grow a tree in 10 minutes. ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202872.8/warc/CC-MAIN-20190323141433-20190323163433-00100.warc.gz
97,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/docu-series-rapture-is-brimming-with-authenticity-7uYP6AGbbEaEe4fLsRWHww/,"(AllHipHop Features) If you’ve been waiting for the next, thought-provoking hip hop documentary, wait no more.  Mass Appeal and Netflix has released a new Hip-Hop docu-series called “Rapture,” and the premise is pretty intriguing. Throughout eight episodes, each of which features a recording artist in Hip-Hop -- Nas and Dave East, T.I., Rapsody, Logic, G-Eazy, A Boogie wit da Hoodie, 2 Chainz and Just Blaze – Rapture provides an insight look these artists’ lives with their families and friends. But it’s more than just a mindless whirl of stage performances and studio sessions. Where this project wins is production cadence unique to each artists actual statement within this particular snapshot of time in their lives.  For example, the deliberate pacing of T.I.’s reflective episode is directly reflective of his psycho-social journey to make a difference in today’s socio-politically driven world that is tense, in large part, due to race relations in America today. From T.I.’s meeting with legends from Harry Belafonte to Andrew Young (though we would have loved to see inclusion the artist meeting with such Black female legendary activists as Angela Davis or others) we witness the unfolding of T.I.’s approach to using his cultural platform to drive awareness about sensitive issues in our society today. However, the rich and very often-times humorous cadence of Nas’ navigation of status as Hip-Hop legend is fast-paced. This is a rare look at Nas’ interaction with other artists, thoughts on his impact over the years and much more. Nas’ brother “Jungle” is a true stand out here who told me, “I love how they used a lot animation to get my points across when I was telling certain stories about me and Nas back in the day.” The particular integration of Dave East, his backstory told by both him and his parents, and his journey into the Nas camp is, at times, very, profound yet definitely entertaining.  In short, “Rapture” is a well-produced package though we would have loved to see more women included in front of and behind the camera. Perhaps in the near future. “Rapture” can be seen on Netflix exclusively. ​ ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912205597.84/warc/CC-MAIN-20190326160044-20190326182044-00003.warc.gz

The ""black carpet"" featured Sonny Digital, Sahbabi, Kawan ""KP"" Prather, and Isaac Hayes III.  At the closing of the red carpet, attendees had a chance to view the first two episodes of season 2 of 'Atlanta' which has been titled, ""Robbin' Season"". The  cast and Glover also joined those in attendance for an after party that  featured Atlanta-based rappers and an ATL-themed video booth. In  a red carpet-turned-press conference, the media had a chance to hear Donald Glover's thoughts on trap music, how Atlanta as a city is  perceived and reflected in the show, and his epic Migos shout out. On trap music: ""It's  like Reggae or something where the elements are very small. It's like  five major elements, and then you just do what you do with it...I feel  like everybody around the world can do it. It's kind of like soccer; all  you need is a ball. All you need is really like the bass drum and the  trap drum, so like everybody can do it. But everybody can't make it good.  I feel like it's a great equalizer of music,"" said Donald.    On ""Bad & Boujee"" Migos shout out:   ""I .....did not...... I mean this like  honestly. I  said it as a joke, cause I was like yeah everybody knows that song is  hot. Then at that moment when I saw the crowd, I was like none of them know this song, like none of them have heard this song. I've heard this  song like 20 times this week,"" Glover added. Donald Glover expressed that the  show and the city of Atlanta represent how the city is a city with a lot  of finessing, and a city where you can truly be whomever it is that you want to be.

99,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/edi-don-of-tupac-s-outlawz-calls-out-clout-chasers-and-talks-group-documentary-AWPMbBRYQUuEkVZflKUziQ/,"(AllHipHop Features) After several features on Tupac’s 1996 posthumous album, “Makaveli,” the world took notice of the Tupac founded group, “The Outlawz.” The group consisted of, E.D.I. Mean (E.D.I. Don), Hussein Fatal, Yaki Kadafi, Young Noble, Napoleon and Kastro. Tupac would also feature the group on one of the most notorious diss tracks of all-time, “Hit Em Up” where shots were fired at the Bad Boy label. In 1999 a collaboration album from 2Pac & The Outlawz was released entitled, “Still I Rise.” The album debuted at #7 on the Billboard 200 and in February of 2000 it was certified platinum after selling over 1.6 million units. It was Tupac’s third posthumous album release. Much like, Bone Thugs-N-Harmony who lost their founder, Eazy E shortly after debuting,  group was forced to surge forward despite losing the two men (Tupac and Kadafi) who brought the group together. As a group, The Outlawz have released 10-studio albums and several mixtapes dating from 1999- present. I had a chance to rap with, Outlawz member, E.D.I. Don. He talks about coping with the losses of Tupac and several Outlawz members, recent Kay Slay influenced collaboration with “The Lox as well as his new album, “The Hope Dealer 2.” AllHipHop: I read where you said recently that The Outlawz were working on a documentary that focused more on the group and not so much about, Tupac. Being that you, guys were all from different areas and walks of life. How did the group come together? E.D.I. Don: Basically, long story short, we were all brought together by a common bond and common interest that linked us together. But the spearhead of that whole thing was of course, Pac and Kadafi. We all knew each other through them two individuals. AllHipHop: You were a west coast guy being partnered up with guys from the east coast, during the height of the east/west thing, was there ever any awkward moments there? E.D.I. Don: It ain’t have nothing to do with a coast with us. It was just a family thing. AllHipHop: Everyone remembers the loss of Tupac because he was so instrumental in launching you guys, but you also loss, Hussein Fatal, Kadafi and Moozaliny in a short period of time. How did you cope with those losses? E.D.I. Don: I’m still coping with it. I’ll let you know when I’m done. AllHipHop: Has keeping their name alive through music been one of the coping agencies for you? E.D.I. Don: Yeah! Music is definitely one of them, absolutely.  AllHipHop: During the movie, “All Eyez On Me,” before the shooting scene where, Pac was shot while in the car with, Suge he played an “Outlaws” song. Where can I find that song? E.D.I. Don: It’s on the hard copy deluxe version of my album that I just put out, “The Hope Dealer pt.2.” You can only get it from me. That was produced by, L.T. Hutton. Shout out to, L.T. Hutton for letting me get that track from the movie. But I got you, just give me your address and I’ll send you one. AllHipHop: I think because of who introduced you guys into the game, the fact that ya’ll were dope artists does get overlooked at times. Can you just speak on the fact of how serious you were about the music side and how sometimes that may have been overlooked. E.D.I. Don: It’s definitely one of those situations where, the light that we were around was shining so bright that our contribution gets overlooked by people who only look on the surface. But that comes with the territory and it’s a gift and a curse. We were gifted to be associated with an icon and put in the game with an icon, but that icon was such a huge and bright light that we get lost in the shadows. That was kind of the idea behind it anyways. We never got in it to be as big as, Pac or bigger than, Pac. We just wanted to add on to what he had already accomplished and to what he was already doing and never make him look bad for fucking with us. We appreciate it all and we take it all either way. AllHipHop: Young Noble has you on some tracks on his new album, but on the surface it does kind of feel like all of you guys went in different directions. Realistically, do you feel like a documentary or movie type of situation could actually go down? E.D.I. Don: It’s an epic story that has to be told, so it will be told in some form or some medium in the future. We just gotta work out the logistics and really make up our mind up on how we want to do it. We have a couple of different options that we can go with and it’s about choosing one of the options. I think the timing has a lot to do with it as well. I think if we try to rush it or force it before it’s time, it won’t be done right, and we could miss our mark. So, we’re going to take our time with it and as so long as the people want to see it and there is an audience for it that cares about our story, it will get out there. Definitely! AllHipHop: Do you feel that there are a lot of things that people would be surprised to learn about The Outlawz while navigating through a documentary, movie or book? E.D.I. Don:  Yeah absolutely! Each member of The Outlawz played an important position and an important role in the whole picture that is, Tupac and The Outlawz. The documentary or the movie… whatever the case may be and how it gets told, it will get told in its entirety and people will definitely get answers to a lot of questions. AllHipHop: In one of your features on the, Young Noble album you wore a hat that said, “Make Hip Hop Great Again.” Is that hat a testament to where you feel Hip-Hop is at today? E.D.I. Don: Let me be clear, I really just liked the hat. That was a hat that Cross Colours” made. I picked that up at my homeboy shop out there in Vegas, “The Palace.” I just liked the hat. There is a lot of great things about hip-hop right now today. I don’t want to make it seem like hip-hop ain’t great, but at the same time, there are certain aspects in the past that get lost when things evolve. I think new artist should always reach back to bring the culture forward. That’s what we did. I think we need a little bit more of that. Other than that, I think there are a lot of great things going on in hip-hop. AllHipHop: Do you feel like artists… especially the younger guys are too comfortable saying things like, “Tupac’s music wasn’t that good,” or just taking little shots at legendary guys in the game today? E.D.I. Don: Yeah! A few years back it wasn’t as much thirst for clout. It wasn’t that much thirst for getting headlines. There is so much competition and it’s so crowded that cats gotta find ways to separate themselves from the pack, get the views, get the likes and the followers. Pac is still the standard in hip-hop as far as greatness in concerned. He’s still top one or two in everybody’s list that matter or that counts. So, when an artist wants some attention or anybody for that matter wants some attention, you say, Pac’s name, you know what I mean. Pac name is going to get a certain amount of attention to this date and that’s just a testament of who he is and what he put down while he was here on this earth.  AllHipHop: “The Hope Dealer 2” album is out; “Dreams” is my favorite track on the album. The album feels to me, like you are geared more towards uplifting and awareness as opposed to anything else. Was that the approach for this album? E.D.I. Don: Man, I’m not that clever, so my music is just a direct reflection of what I’m going through whenever I’m recording it. If that’s what the album sounds like to you when you listened to it, then that’s where I’m at in my life; period point blank. AllHipHop: I see you are in the studio with DJ Quik. Anytime, Quik is involved you could expect some fire. What you got cooking with him? E.D.I. Don: Man, stay tuned. It’s a wonderful thing to be able to work with a legend. I used to watch him when I was younger. I was always a fan of his music and his production, the whole thing. The whole, DJ Quik movement, I was a fan of. To be working with him now at this point in my career is just like another check on the bucket list. A long list of things that I never imagined as a young emcee coming into the game. For him to be like, “Yo, I want you here. I need you on this.” It’s dope and I appreciate the opportunity. AllHipHop: When you look back at some of the things you were able to accomplish in this game, you have to be proud because you have worked with legends. E.D.I. Don: My momma and my lady often tell me I need to stop and smell the roses because I’ve always been working. I always wanted to work and establish myself and add on to a great tree. I never wanted to be a weak branch, so I was always in work mode. At this point I’m starting to smell the roses a little bit now. I’m thankful is all I can really say. I’m just thankful for the opportunities that I continue to get, 20-plus years in the game. That in itself is quite a feat. I stayed on it like I wanted it and that’s why I’m reaping the blessings. AllHipHop: Being that you have over 20-years under your belt and you have endured the ups as well as many losses, what keeps you motivated? E.D.I. Don: I have highly self-motivated people in my life. Like my partner, Young Noble is a self-motivated dude. He is a hard-working cat and he never slowed down either. He’s always working hard. And my partner in my other company, Sinatra is another self-motivated dude. I think the people around you that is self-motivated will have an influence on you. It’s very important to have like-minded individuals in your circle. People that think like you and people who you share a lot of your energy with. That’s what I’m around, so it keeps me motivated as well as other things like, living, surviving, having personal goals, my children, my woman and people in my life like that adds on to the pot. It gets me out the bed in the morning. AllHipHop: Is there anyone out there who you would like to collaborate with that you haven’t had the opportunity to work with yet? E.D.I. Don: Man, I tell you one thing; shout out to, Kay Slay. He made one of my hip-hop bucket lists come true this year and that was the record we got with, “The Lox.” I always respected their music, respected their hustle and how they got down and to get that done was dope. Shout out to, Kay Slay for making that happen. Other than that, I really don’t have no other… I recorded with all of my favorites literally. All of my favorites in hip-hop from my generation I got to work with in some capacity. I really don’t have any desires in that area. It’s just great to still be relevant 20-something years into this game and still get these opportunities. ​ 2PAC WAS THE HEAD OF THE WEST COAST BIGGIE WAS THE HEAD OF THE EAST COAST.""WHEN YOU KILL THE HEAD THE BODY DIES"" ALL THEM NIGGAS THAT WAS RAPPIN WIT THESE GREAT LEGENDS NOT HOT TODAY.

100,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/eminem-s-revival-is-a-mixed-bag-at-best-nZGSJZ3yg0GxOuyo1iq_Tg/,"By Shad Reed  (AllHipHop Features) After over twenty years in the game, including an unprecedented run from 1999 to 2002, Eminem’s name is forever etched in the annals of Hip-Hop history.  Now, in 2017, the man born Marshall Mathers is 45 years old standing alongside a generation of artists he influenced.  And while his latest offering, Revival, has a few moments of brilliance, it is more so an overstuffed album which relies too heavily on old tricks and tactics.    Whereas Em's ""Renegade"" collaborator Jay-Z pushed Hip-Hop forward with rap's version of an adult contemporary album this past summer, Eminem's mostly stuck in the past.  Unlike Jay's 4:44, which addressed an artist at middle-age with a great deal of wisdom, Marshall's 19-track collection of songs finds him rehashing subjects listeners have already heard about and making another attempt for shock value when, at a time when both beheading and hardcore porn videos can be witnessed at the click of a button, the mere idea of such a thing may be outdated. One thing which fortunately hasn’t changed though is that Eminem still has the instinct of a battle rapper, and, while he has dissed everyone from LFO to his own mom during his time on the mic, the current targets are Donald Trump and the Make America Great Again agenda.  Conceptually, “Untouchable” finds Mr. Mathers rapping from the perspective  of a Caucasian male and an African-American one; it’s him demonstrating and acknowledging the privilege that his skin color provides.  It’s a very commendable act.  Between this and his famous cypher at this year’s BET Hip-Hop Awards, the politically charged and Alicia Keys-assisted “Like Home” is a bit of letdown.  Em’s lyrical shots at 45 are solid.  “Everybody on your feet / This is where terrorism and heroism meet, square off in the streets / This chump barely even sleeps / All he does is watch Fox News like a parrot and repeats / While he looks like a canary with a beak / Why you think he banned transgenders from the military with a tweet?”  However, they lose some of their strength when he says, “You don’t have to agree” before the rapping even starts.  This not only undermines the “line in the sand” that he drew in the aforementioned awards show rhyme, but takes some of the sting out of the song as a whole.  The olive branch he extends to his ex-wife, Kim Scott, in “Bad Husband” is not unlike the one he extended to his mother on his last album’s “Headlights” song.  Powerful and compelling stuff, but a little too late.  Eminem is still an emcee very attached to the people and events in his personal life when it comes to his art, and while the public was once fascinated by it, not nearly as much of it care as would’ve 10 years ago.  Even if reboots are currently in style, nothing new is being discussed here.  Before he killed Kim on track 16 of The Marshall Mathers LP, he screamed, “I love you” and so the fact he expresses the same sentiment rationally seventeen years later on ""Bad Husband"" isn’t mind-blowing.  That being said, Eminem has a way with words, so the last verse is still touching.  “This is so tough, I’m gettin’ choked up / Oh f*** it, we both suck / We broke up, got back together / We both thought we had forever / Not bad people, just bad together.”  Elsewhere, the Rick Rubin-produced records “Remind Me” and “Heat” find Eminem rapping over rock music.  The former, with its Joan Jett and The Blackhearts sample, misses the mark completely and the latter doesn’t fare much better.  Thankfully, in addition to Revival’s lead single “Walk on Water” with Beyonce, Rubin makes up for the few missteps with the album closer, “Arose.”  “Arose” and “Castle"" (the song which precedes it) is Eminem doing what he does best.  The two songs sequenced together find Em recounting his days trying to make it as a rapper and then rising to international superstardom through a series of love letters to his daughter, and finally revisiting some of the darkest points in his life with haunting despair. A tape is then heard rewinding and he goes back to “Castle” and raps with a sense of optimism rather than defeat.  It is truly inspiring and serves as a metaphor for both his life and career. Revival is one of the weakest releases in Eminem’s discography, but that doesn’t change the fact that he is one of the greatest rappers ever.  Why?  Because this album is being compared to his own body of work as opposed to the competition.  In terms of skills, the percentage of people whose talent rivals Eminem’s on this LP is astronomically small.  On the second song he asks, “But how do you keep up the pace / And the hunger pains once you’ve won the race?”  It’s a great question, and one that few people ever get to ask.  Slim Shady’s ninth album attempts to answer it, and, because the response is unclear, the project suffers.  Even with respectable contributions from guests (eight songs have features), those records still feel kinda manufactured and that’s the last thing you’d expect from someone who said “I just don’t give a f***” even before “Hi, my name is.”  In the final two minutes of the 77-minute release, Em raps, “I’ll put out this last album, then I’m done with it / One hundred percent finished, fed up with it / I’m hanging it up, f*** it!”  If so, okay.  But based on this album, hopefully not.  Even if he is over the hill, the last person to count out is Eminem.  He came into Hip-Hop with the ability to get the last word better than anyone; it’s only fitting he leave the same way.  And with Revival, it's as if he's still trying to figure out the best approach to do so.  It’ll be exciting to see what happens if and when he does. ​ What didn’t people like about this album just out of curiousoty? It played like a greatest hits to me. He had something for all of his fans on there, old em, new em, disrespectful em, thoughtful em. I mean he came out and said he didn’t care about reviews or album sales he was just trying to appease his fans. I mean I’ve always loved Em, but didn’t care for his last 4 albums much. But after listening to this album 5 or 6 Times I’m still picking up on punch lines. I mean he touches on everything on this album, Hell he even laughs at the thought of token taking over his spot. I was just curious if it was the beat selection, or features that people didn’t enjoy or what it was about the album people didn’t like.  Editor Yeah ... Have a great day and take care.  Peace. The rest was good. I think we can all agree Em let us down with this album.  Editor Word. I should have just done that.  I'll take the L, and keep it moving.  I was in a very confusing space personally (and still am) when listening to the album for review and writing the article; the quality of the piece was compromised as a result.  I sincerely appreciate your respectful and honest feedback.  Also, thanks for the kind words about the rest of the write-up. He started there because thatss the part he’s rewriting. Feel like youre reaching for justification. Saying that he’s done sets up his comeback for relapse recover and mmlp2 / the verse wouldn’t make sense if he didnt start from there. If you knew that he wasn’t referring to quitting after revival why didn’t you write that to begin with? Just sayin.

When Andre comes to Anika's home in the morning hours to try to win back Rhonda, Anika ends up retching in the bathroom and admits to them both that she is suffering from morning sickness and that Hakeem (Bryshere Y. Gray) is the father. In a classic pimp move, Anika manipulates Andre and Rhonda to set up a Lyon family meeting where Anika tells everyone about her pregnancy and announces that the only thing that she wants, as the mother of the next Lyon, is an uncontested place back within the Lyon clan. Lucious (Terrence Howard) deftly unseats Hakeem (Bryshere Y. Gray) as the CEO of Empire, clearing a path towards regaining the throne for himself. In a series of underhanded moves that include using muscle to sabotage Empire's Anthony and Cleopatra clothing line, turning Andre against Cookie (Taraji P. Henson) and his brothers, planting drugs on trucks carrying Empire concert equipment, and humiliating Hakeem in front of a meeting for Empire's investors, Lucious manages to get Hakeem voted out by the board members as Empire's CEO. Lucious' mother appears to be alive and well of body, if not the mind. As part and parcel of Lucious convincing Andre to give him the insider information needed to embarrass and unseat Hakeem as CEO, Lucious promises Andre at his own mother's grave site that he will be more forthcoming to Andre about her life, as well as and her struggles with mental illness. However, when Lucious' bag man Thirsty Rawlings (Andre Royo) is then seen to be making regular visits to an old folks home to attend to an older woman(Leslie Uggams) who is very much alive but still singing all those sad songs that young Leah Walker (Kelly Rowland) sang to young Dwight Walker all those years ago... well, let's just say Lucious is going to have a lot of explaining to do when the dark truth of yet another huge lie about his childhood gets pulled kicking and screaming into the light.

Henson) in her time of need. In the surprise twist of twists, Cookie, for the sake of Hakeem's (Bryshere Y. Gray) unborn baby, actually calms down Anika when she is on her way to the hospital in an ambulance. When the paramedics can't calm down Boo Boo Kitty's crazy, Cookie is actually a maternal pillar of strength for the corporate side chick that she loves to hate. But wait a minute... why is Anika on her way to the hospital? Anika has some sort of unexplained panic attack that puts her in the hospital.  Right before Cookie is set to 'handle' the problem that Boo Boo Kitty poses as the new human incubator for the next generation of the Lyon dynasty, she runs smack dab into the paramedics taking Anika out of her house on a stretcher. Early on, Cookie calls it as a panic attack - but is it? Honestly, it's hard to tell seeing as Lucious Lyon (Terrence Howard) has threatened Anika's life and Anika has been known to stalk Hakeem's fiancee Laura (Jamila Velazquez), the woman who in all likelihood will be her baby's step mother. Only time, or perhaps the two remaining episodes up until the end of season 2, will tell. Empire board members intend to elect Lucious Lyon and Cookie Lyon as the new co CEOs of Empire. Honestly, with all of the deft public mending that Cookie has done to keep the family together as a cohesive business entity, we could have seen this one coming, but it's still pretty darn shocking. Even more shocking is that Lucious, upon hearing about it from the board holders, graciously declares that he thinks this is a good idea - to the slack jawed surprise of Cookie. Factual hiccup - when Cookie got out of jail in ""Empire"" season 1, didn't Lucious say that per federal law, as a convicted felon Cookie could never hold the office of CEO in a company like Empire, let alone a publicly traded company? Hmmmm. However, no matter what the logistics, seeing the hug that Lucious gives Cookie after hearing the news, one can't think that this hug has less of a relationship to celebration versus direct kinship with the kiss of death. Soon after becoming Empire's very public face for Bipolar Disorder, Andre (Trai Byers) learns that Lucious' mother, Leah Walker (Leslie Uggams) is alive. Courtesy of the rage of yet another woman sexually scorned and betrayed by Lucious, this particular one being that shameless journalist Harper Scott (Annie Ilonzeh), Andre learns the exact details and location of his dear old departed bipolar grandmother, who is in fact not departed at all, as she is living just outside of Philly. With this revelation, it's a good guess that there are more bombshell inconsistencies lurking in the dark picture that Lucious has been painting publicly and privately with regards to his complicated relationship from mother to son. And so the plot thickens....  ""Empire"" airs Wednesdays at 9:00/8:00 c on Fox. ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912203093.63/warc/CC-MAIN-20190323221914-20190324003914-00026.warc.gz

Here is what the press conference participants had to say:  ERROL SPENCE JR.  ""You're going to see the same Errol Spence that you're used to. I can't look ahead because I know how dangerous Lamont Peterson is. I've been in training camps with him and I know what he can do.  ""I've seen too many fighters look down the road and get beat before they get to the big fight. I have to be 100 percent focused and hungry. I'm fully dedicated to this fight.  ""Lamont can push me to even greater levels. I feel like he is a better fighter than Kell Brook and has even more heart than Kell Brook and he can bring out the best in me. ""I think it's going to start out as a boxing match, but as we go on, it's going to be a dog fight. We both have big hearts. I've never known Lamont to turn down any fight. Not a lot of people wanted to fight me. The big names shied away from me but Lamont stood up and said he'd fight me. This is going to be a hard fight. ""I used to watch Lamont and his brother Anthony Peterson before I ever met them. I like their styles, the way they throw body punches and the fundamentals that they learned from Barry Hunter.  ""I think I can be known as the best pound-for-pound in the sport, but I have to take it one fight at a time. I want to be the undisputed welterweight champion. That should be everyone's ultimate goal - to be the best fighter in the sport. But first I have a big test ahead of me January 20.  ""This is the business of the sport. I was a young guy when Lamont was giving me advice. Now we've gotten to this point. It really shows his longevity in the sport and how I've reached the ranks of being a top pro fighter.  ""Sparring with Lamont Peterson was really great work. It was a learning experience. I was an amateur so I was going at a fast pace and Lamont was being patient, blocking and countering and picking his shots. He was fighting at a pro pace and I didn't really understand it until I got farther into my career.  ""You've seen me and Lamont fight. We're not in boring fights. We have fan-friendly styles and you're going to get a really good fight. We have the mentality to really go after it and give it our all to get this win.  ""I want the best in this division to all fight each other. It's time for everyone else to stand up and proclaim that they want to be great. That's how we get this division to the peak. I don't feel like waiting to fight the best. I want to prove myself."" LAMONT PETERSON ""This is a world title fight and I'm thankful for that. I try not to make too much out of each fight. I just want to take it one fight at a time. I've done this for 13 years as a professional. All fights are the same. I'm going to go in there and take care of business. ""As a top fighter, you're obligated to take what comes on the table. Regardless of who it is. It's boxing. It's a sport and we're competitors. We want to go in there and compete to see who's the best. We're going to treat it like business like we always do. ""You already know when I fight, it's a feeling out process to start, but in my head, I'm ready to go. It's going to get rough in the trenches and we'll see who wants it more.  ""I knew six years ago when Errol was in my camp that we'd get to this point. I knew he would be a champion. For the most part, I've seen him improve and progress throughout the pro ranks and I believe he's going to keep getting better.  ""I don't pay any attention to the outside noise. I respect everyone's opinion. I just go out and train to do what I love to do. I do this because I love to box. I'm not here to get on a list. I truly love this sport. ""I can't worry about people thinking that Errol is the next star in this sport. I believe that, but I can't worry about it.  It is up to me and my team to come up with the right type of strategy and execute it.  ""I'm not too worried about figuring out his southpaw stance. I've been around long enough and encountered enough southpaws. I'm confident I'll be able to handle it.  ""The size may seem like an advantage for Errol, but it's up to me and my team to figure out the best way to negate it. I know who I am. I'm a competitive person.

As a co-host of “Ebro in the Morning” and “The Michael Kay Show,” Rosenberg voice permeates throughout New York City and the nation. With all of that going on, he still finds time to host ""Cheap Heat,” a podcast dedicated to wrestling, broadcast WWE shows, host Open Late on the Complex networks, and is a sought after DJ for events throughout the country. In other words, Rosenberg is moving heavy in the media game. Whatever he does, wherever he goes, he always represents hip-hop culture to the fullest. I caught up with Rosenberg to discuss how he juggles two successful radio shows, his love of wrestling, and the upcoming NBA All-Star weekend where he will be an analyst for the NBA Celebrity All-Star Basketball game. AllHipHop: I want to begin on a different note. As a wrestling aficionado, were you always a WWF (Now WWE) fan growing up or did you watch was the other wrestling territories like NWA (WCW)? Rosenberg: Growing up I must say that I was a big WWE fan. We could catch some of the NWA tapings in the Washington D. C. area and some of the other promotions that use to come on T.V. But for the most part, being from the Northeast, I was a WWE guy. AllHipHop: Here’s another wrestling question for you. It’s well documented that Bobby “The Brain” Heenan is your favorite of all-time. Who else would make the list of your top 5 wrestling managers? Rosenberg: Wow. Now that’s a good question. I always loved Sensational Sherri. I think she was so underrated. Of course I would have to add J.J. Dillion who managed the Four Horsemen. I also loved Slick “The Doctor of Style.” People often sleep on Slick. I thought he was an underrated character. He was always entertaining on the mic. For my last pick, I would have to say “The Mouth of the South” Jimmy Hart. AllHipHop: Indeed. Many may not be aware that Jimmy Hart had a successful music career before entering the wrestling business. Rosenberg: You’re correct. Jimmy Hart’s band The Gentrys I believe they were called, had a big hit ""Keep on Dancing,” that sold millions of copies. Hart also wrote a lot of the entrance music for the WWE wrestlers including The Honky Tonk Man, “The American Dream,” Dusty Rhodes, and Shawn Michaels' 'Sexy Boy,' theme. AllHipHop: Without question, you are one of the most well-known radio personalities on the scene. You’re on weekdays from 6-10AM on “Ebro in the Morning,” co-hosting along with Ebro Darden and Laura Styles, one of the most influential hip-hop shows on the air. Also, you co-host The Michael Kay Show on ESPN Radio simulcast on the YES Network,  you work as broadcaster with the WWE, and you even hosted your own late-night show on the Complex networks. How do you manage all of your different media responsibilities? Rosenberg: Yeah it’s insane. Doing Hip-Hop in the morning and a sports show in the late afternoon, no one is doing what I’m doing for sure. I usually wake up a little after 5 and then I drive downtown to Hot 97 for my 6 to 10 a.m. shift. Between shows, I try to catch a two hour nap before then walking to ESPN to join Kay from 3 to 7 p.m. Thankfully all the stations were fine with my juggling both gig and since I came aboard the Michael Kay show has consistently has out-rated the others on the channel. Working with Michael Kay and Don La Greca has been great. Joining the WWE team has been a dream come true. As a life-long fan of wrestling, hosting Cheap Heat on ESPN and being a part of the broadcast team on WWE shows and pay-per-views has been everything I hoped it would be. All of the different media avenues that I work with are connected because they touch on subjects that I love. AllHipHop: Now you’ve played in the Celebrity All-Star game before. How do you feel about going from being on court to now being one of the analysts? Rosenberg: I couldn’t be more excited to be on the mic. I’ll be calling the game along with Cassidy Hubbarth and Mark Jones will be providing commentary. Chiney Ogwumike will be making her first appearance as an analyst with us as well. I’m looking forward to seeing all of the celebrities who think they ball get on the court. Quavo, Bad Bunny, Amanda Seales, and so many others will be playing and it will be a blast. AllHipHop: Tell me what’s the difference between the NBA All-Star weekend and the other major sports? Rosenberg: I think that the NBA All-Star weekend is the best by far. The NBA does a really good job of highlighting their current stars and the players that’s on the rise. Plus, the NBA uses this weekend to connect with the pop culture more than the other major sports. AllHipHop: Historically, the dunk contest is usually one of the biggest draws of NBA All-Star Weekend. What’s your view on how the slam dunk contest has evolved over the years? Rosenberg: Just like in Hip-Hop, it’s easy to fall into nostalgia and believe that everything was better when I was 12. Of course the epic battle by between Michael Jordan and Dominque Wilkins was a classic and Vince Carter probably put on the best performance ever in a dunk contest. But there have been some great dunk contests over the past couple of years. Especially, the duel between Aaron Gordon and Zach Levine. That was one of the best slam dunk contest I’ve ever witnessed. AllHipHop: Out of all the events that take place during All-Star Weekend, what’s your favorite? Rosenberg: Wow. That’s a tough one. From the Celebrity game, to the 3-point shootout, to the Dunk Contest, and the skills challenge. But this year I’m looking forward to the 3-point shootout this year. AllHipHop: Now I need you to give me your predictions for all the events taking place on Saturday of All-Star Weekend. Rosenberg: Let me see. It not’s much of a risk but I’m taking Quavo to win the MVP of the Celebrity game. He’s gonna win it for the second time. Quavo takes this game very seriously. I see him working out a few weeks ago. In the dunk contest, I’m picking Dennis Smith Jr. simply because something good has to happen for Knicks this year. AllHipHop: You don’t think the Porzingis trade was good for the Knicks? Rosenberg: It’s never good when we’re talking about the Knicks. That’s why I’m picking Dennis Smith Jr. For the skills challenge, I’m going with, De'Aaron Fox. And for the 3-Point contest it would be easy to pick Steph Curry but I’m gonna go with a sleeper. I’m picking Buddy Hield. I predict it’s gonna be a big night for the Sacramento Kings.

You put 15 grams of baking soda on 35 grams of  powder cocaine, then cook the 15 grams of baking soda off to bring it to  a rock form of 35 grams or less, depending on how you cook. So, what’s  the difference besides the thousand years the judge is going to sentence  you to in court for the crack instead of powder? The government knows  that crack is sold in predominately Black and Hispanic neighborhoods, so  that’s who their targets are to keep the incarceration rate up. AllHipHop.com: What are your thoughts on the president? Big Meech:  First, I’m thankful that God blessed me to live and see our first Black  president. I feel that the president before him made one big mess of  America that it is impossible for Obama to clean it up, even if he gets a  second term. I feel that all the stimulus packages in the world won’t  revamp our economy, if we can’t create new jobs or new ways to make  money. Violence is high in most of our Black cities and communities  because our children have no guidance or people that they respect enough  to listen to at home or in the community. Hopefully, President Obama will take the time to look out for his  people before he leaves office. Bush pardoned the most people ever  before he left office, which included John Forte who did seven years of a  14-year prison sentence. I’m not looking for a pardon, although I would  take it if he did it for me. I would love to see him change all the  drug laws which are too severe and extreme for this day and age. If you  look at all the fathers and mothers serving lengthy prison sentences,  elderly grandparents are raising their young children. The gap between  the children and their grandparents is so far apart that communication  and understanding between them is almost impossible. So, there’s a lot  of hostility and disrespect between young people and elderly people.  Other than that, I think President Obama and his family handle being in  the spotlight and the scrutiny that comes with that office very well. AllHipHop.com: What are your thoughts on prisons in America? Big Meech: We have the highest incarceration rate in  the entire world, over three million people and counting. America is  supposed to be the land of the free and the home of the brave. Prison is  nowhere near the rehabilitation place the justice system claims it is.  They mix nonviolent inmates with violent inmates. Some people come in  with three or four years, and end up with 20 or more years, or a life  sentence simply because they had to protect themselves. Any and  everything can send you to jail or prison in America, and that’s not  always the right answer. They need to bring back 65 percent (time served  of time sentenced) and parole for federal inmates. In the state of  Georgia, you do 35 percent of your time if your crime is non-iolent or  drug related. The feds are taking over so many state cases, that people  who would’ve gotten probation or county jail time are now getting six  years or more. AllHipHop.com: Describe what your day is like? Big Meech: (LMFAO). I have to laugh at this question  to keep from crying, but trust me, I’m crying inside. I’ve been in the  hold on ’23 and 1′ [23 hours in cell and one hour out per day] since  June 2011. This SMU sh*t is like a torture camp for real. First, showers  are only on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Both me and my celly have to  cuff up whether one of us is leaving to go to rec, shower, or medical,  or if both of us are leaving. Everywhere we go, our hands are in black  box handcuffs behind our back with a C.O. holding our cuffs, walking  with us. I’m always trying to get out of my handcuffs first because you  never know when your celly may have a bad day and jump you while you  still have your cuffs on. There’s three or four fights or stabbings daily, especially since  it’s hot. If you disobey them, you’ll get a heavy dose of tear gas,  which has the whole building choking and coughing, eyes burning. Then  they’ll put you in restraints handcuffed extra tight with a chain around  your waist, shackled. I’ve heard grown men cry crocodile tears from  their hands swelling and nerve damage from the cuffs. If that’s not  enough, they have another form of punishment called “Four Points” where  they put you on your back chained around both ankles and wrists in a  very cold room with the lights on. Everyone who reads this should look  up Lewisburg SMU online and read about the deaths, disfigurements, and  inhumane conditions and brutality that goes on in here. So, my days are  like a living hell. AllHipHop.com: How is your family coping? Big Meech: My family is handling my incarceration  the best way that they can, but it’s very hard on my mother and father.  My father went to prison for 18 months for money laundering, and both  their sons got 30-year sentences which, at their age, seem like life  sentences. I’ve been in the worst mood of my bid because my father is in  a lot of pain due to diabetes and may have to have both of his legs cut  off. I can’t even make a phone call to speak to him or anyone for that  matter. I get so frustrated and agitated at times. I have a really  strong family bond, so when one of us is going through it, it’s like all  of us is going through it.  AllHipHop.com: Do you still talk to Young Jeezy? Big Meech: I haven’t been able to talk to anyone on  the phone for the last five months. The last time I spoke to him was  near the end of last year. AllHipHop.com: How do you feel about his success? Big Meech: Being the person largely responsible for  his success, I’ve always and always will be proud of his success. I  would never wish or hope or his downfall for any reasons. I just  personally feel that he could do more abut helping me to regain my  freedom in a timely fashion, with his success and the position he is in  right now in life. For example, [he could say] ‘I could not rest knowing  he has a 30-year sentence for a first-time, nonviolent offender. I’m  meeting with every reputable attorney in America until I can find one  that can at least get him a sentence reduction, if not bring him home…’ …but that’s me and the love I have for him and the majority of people  in my B.M.F. family. To be honest, I get ask so many questions about  him – from C.O.’s to convicts to random people in the mail – some of  which I have no answers for, ’cause for me to have the answers to most  of the questions, I would have to have an excuse which there is “NO  EXCUSE.” AllHipHop.com: What do you think of Rick Ross making the song “B.M.F.”? Big Meech: Actually, I appreciate all of the music  that Rick Ross and MMG has put out period. But in 2010, when I first  heard my name repeatedly in the “B.M.F.” song, I was like, “Damn, that’s  hot.” And it’s a hit. To this day, he has people from all over the  world saying, “I think I’m Big Meech,” which is a priceless way of  recognizing and paying homage to me and the B.M.F. family. We all have  100% love for Ross and MMG. I think he is a helluva artist and mogul. AllHipHop.com: Does it bother you that he was once a corrections officer? Big Meech: (LMAO). I think this question is old and  irrelevant, because I have friends and family that are C.O.’s. I’ve ran  across some good men and women C.O.’s. I think that Ross is a great  example of being a dreamer and dreams coming true, just from what I know  about him being with Suave House and writing rhymes and rapping and for  all the years he stuck with it. And now he has built a brand and an  empire. So the answer is no, it doesn’t bother me that he was a C.O. It  would only bother me if he was a “rat.” AllHipHop.com: Or that he is in a fight with “Freeway Ricky Ross” for the use of his name? Big Meech: I know “Freeway” but I’ve never spoken to  him about his name, but in my opinion, if I felt that we had to get an  understanding about the use of my name, then we would arrange a meeting  at everyone’s convenience in a comfortable environment not a courtroom. I  personally don’t see anything wrong with him using the name. I think he  made the Rick Ross name popular and positive; it would be great and  more beneficial if they did some charity events together instead of some  senseless feud. AllHipHop.com: Would you ever permit an aspiring rapper to use your name? Big Meech: I wouldn’t have a problem with it as long  as he’s good at his craft, especially if he’s as successful as Rick  Ross and 50 Cent. Both of those men made their names worldwide household  brands, and I respect both of their grinds to success. They both are  very blessed, whether they realize it or not. AllHipHop.com: Is it possible that you could come home? Big Meech: I have an out-date where I could come  home one day, but I’m not trying to wait until the “Elroy Jetson” date  of 2032 that the BOP has given me. If some of these political figures,  ACLU, or NAACP would speak up and stand up for me, which would put my  unjust 30-year plea deal in the spotlight, I probably would’ve been home  three or four years ago. Those types of people only seem to speak up  once one of us has been killed, then it’s too late. If enough people  come together with voting power, I could see a change in my sentence or  come home, just like when Russell Simmons helped change the RICO law in  New York. AllHipHop.com: How do you keep your sanity? Big Meech: I’ve been through so much in my lifetime  to make me the strong-minded man that I am. They can’t break what they  didn’t create, so I stay focused on the future and being free again. I  try to stay in tune with what’s going on in the world today in music,  entertainment, technology, and sports, just to feel like I’m still up on  everything. But for real, I refuse to lose anything more than the time I  have already lost that I can never get back. They can’t undo what I’ve  already done and they can’t change or erase my memories and history. I  know I have more life ahead of me than behind me so like I said in my  letter on MySpace in 2006, “Nothing beats the trials of the present like  the EXPECTATIONS of the future.” ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912201922.85/warc/CC-MAIN-20190319073140-20190319095140-00510.warc.gz

[ALSO CHECK OUT: Bone Thugs-N-Harmony “Everything 100″] “I’m perfectly healthy. Everything is lovely. I’m probably the  healthiest I’ve ever been in my life,” says Bizzy. “It’s difficult when  the camera’s on to try and turn on your best ‘picture face.’ You wanna  be normal so much and you wanna give the realness to the people so much,  so in the course of that you’re gonna catch some funny faces.” There has been speculation that Bizzy’s recent weight lose was the  result of a substance abuse problem, but the original member of Bone  makes it clear that his drop in mass was from his own personal decision,  and he is not currently involved in excessive drug use despite what  some observers may draw from certain pics. “A brother done lost 70, 80 pounds. I had to. I was too damn fat, and  it was all from alcohol. As far as me drinking and things of that  nature, I’ve gone out maybe six times in a year and six months. My  fiance hated it every time. Never have I done anything else. No Mollies,  none of that sh*t. No crack. No coke. The farthest I’ve ever been is  opium back in my younger days,” explains Bizzy. “I’m not suppose to be  cute all the goddamn time. I’m a man, so sometimes you gonna catch me in  my manly mode. It’s difficult to keep a model face and suck your teeth  in and all that bullsh*t. I ain’t got time for that.” For an entertainer, even the mention of hard drug abuse can  negatively affect business relationships which is why Bizzy wanted to  clear up the matter. “I can’t walk into any business places that’s conducting  distribution, marketing, promotions and them take me serious if I don’t  answer these things,” says Bizzy. “So if I leave it out there and say I  don’t care what anybody say about me it starts affecting my business. I  have to say, ‘Nah, it nothing like that. I ain’t never done no sh*t like  that’.” Bizzy also made headlines recently when he spoke on how he felt that  his mentor Eazy-E’s death from AIDS has prevented the former N.W.A.  member from being held in the same esteem as other fallen entertainers. [ALSO READ: Bone Thugs: Eazy-E Doesn’t Get Cred He Deserves Because Of Death From AIDS] “It’s the energy that’s going around of what people consider violent  and what people consider a tragedy, of what people consider a culprit  and what people consider a victim. It’s so much about AIDS going on in  people’s mind that it’s a touchy ass subject, so that’s why I think  mostly it’s not really spoken about. It’s like let’s stay away from  that,” says Bizzy. “The gunshots with Pac and B.I.G. and even Left Eye  getting into the accident, our beloved sister Aaliyah, they can talk  more about that more so than the AIDS issue. It’s just a crazy issue.” Bizzy and the rest of Bone will do their part in honoring the legacy  of Eazy at this year’s Rock The Bells Festival where the group will  perform alongside a virtual Eazy-E. Bone will begin rehearsing with the  hologram about two weeks before the traveling festival starts in San  Bernardino, California on September 7. “It’s going to be monumental. It’s a major thing for Bone  Thugs-N-Harmony to bring Eazy to the table. It’s not enough exposure of  Eazy E so every time we bring Eazy to the table it rejuvenates  everything and makes all the old stuff new.” [ALSO READ: EXCLUSIVE: EXCLUSIVE: ODB and Eazy-E Holograms Will Perform At Rock The Bells] ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202671.79/warc/CC-MAIN-20190322135230-20190322161230-00257.warc.gz

The New Music Seminar’s “Artist on the Verge” shot a “day in the life” video for the Jay Z led platform. The clip included Bizzy meditating at Los Angeles’ Runyon Canyon Park, visiting the office of the Young & Reckless fashion brand, and stopping by the studio to record new tracks.  AllHipHop.com spoke with Bizzy about being featured on Tidal Discovery, growing his brand as an indie performer, and what the future holds for the No Hard Feelings mixtape creator. How did you get involved in the Tidal Discovery program?  Tidal reached out to my management. I think I was one of the first people to tweet about Tidal when it first launched. Somebody at the office that was familiar with my music passed it on. They heard the music, and they wanted me to do it. As an indie artist, what do you see are the advantages of working with a company like Tidal?  The fact that it’s such a new company that somebody like Jay Z is still pushing. So a lot of people are going to tune in. It’s a great platform to get your music on. I went up to the Roc Nation office, and that’s where the Tidal office is. You get the best of both worlds. Tidal and the attention of the Roc Nation people too. In your mini-doc, you also visited Young & Reckless. What’s your relationship with that brand?  Drama and Keith, those are my guys. Those guys are hip. They catch a lot of stuff early. They always see the vision. Young & Reckless reached out to me about a year ago during last year’s BET Awards.  They had me model some things. Those guys know the culture, and they are very good at predicting what’s next. They’re with Post Malone now. Yeah, they know what they’re doing over there.  So for the Tidal Discovery documentary, we ran through the office, took some photos, and chopped it up with Drama. We’re definitely looking forward to doing some things. You’ve done a good job building your brand independently. At this point do you have any interest in signing with a major?  I’m not opposed to it. But as far as signing just because? Nah, I’m not really interested in that. What I am interested in is continuing to build, and eventually finding a partner that sees the level we’re doing already and not change that. They just want to partner up and help us do bigger things.  That I’m all the way with, but right now we’re learning the game. We’re learning how things work. We do have a lot of great relationships with people at labels. You recently released the new track ""John Geiger."" Have you had the chance to meet him?  Me and John haven’t linked yet, but we’re definitely talking about doing a visual. Being an avid sneaker lover, John is somebody that's important to the culture.  I did the “John Geiger” record initially just referring to the misplaced checks, but then we ended up chopping it up. We had a lot of things in common. It’s almost like what John is doing in the sneaker world, I want to do in the rap game. It’s like we’re underdogs. I saw an interview where you said you wrote that song right after the XXL Freshman list came out. Some people were surprised you didn’t make it this year. Were you disappointed at the fact you weren’t picked?  I wasn’t disappointed. I felt like I just gotta step it up and go harder. I took that as motivation. I’m not one to get disappointed by not getting things my way. I’m more of the kind of guy to take that, flip it and just go harder.  When I didn’t make the Freshman cover, I said, “Okay.” If the Freshman list is about longevity and the future of Hip Hop that doesn’t change the fact this is my freshman year. Speaking of the future, do you have plans to release another project anytime soon?  Absolutely, right now I’m working on a very special project. It’s called From Nothing Came Everything. This one right here is going to change everything. It’s going to put my mark on the game and give me the respect I deserve.  I’m planning on doing a lot of things with Tidal. They have a great platform for artists like me - like I said earlier - because of the fact that it’s a new company that Jay Z’s behind it, and he’s still actively pushing it. A lot of artists are behind it - Kanye, Rihanna.  So there’s a lot of attention on Tidal right now. It’s good for indie artists to upload their music on there, and they’ll have a very good chance of being heard. Just like I did. This all started with a tweet.

Gray is part of a cast that includes Keith Powers (Ronnie DeVoe), Woody McClain (Bobby Brown), Elijah Kelley (Ricky Bell), Algee Smith (Ralph Tresvant), and Luke James (Johnny Gill). AllHipHop.com spoke with the 22-year-old rapper/actor by phone from rehearsals for the New Edition miniseries, and Yazz discussed his preparation for taking on the role of Biv. “I’ve been working with a dialect coach. I went to Boston for about four weeks to really live that Boston life to understand where Michael came from,” says Gray. “I was just learning a lot about him, so I can take that home with me. It’s fun.” In order to perfect the singing, rapping, and dancing associated with hit records such as “Cool It Now” and “If It Isn’t Love,” Gray and the other performers have been practicing for twelve hours a day. The opportunity to present the story of the founding member of Bell Biv DeVoe was a special assignment for Yazz. “What made me interested in the project? Anything that’s legendary I want to be part of. I had to be part of it,” adds Gray. “Michael Bivins is the character that stuck out to me from day 1 when I heard New Edition. I was really lucky for them to have me play Michael Bivins, because I love New Edition so much.” According to Gray, the 3-part biographical movie will cover New Edition from their childhood into the their 30’s. Dante Hoagland (Bivins), Caleb McLaughlin (Bell), Jahi Winston (Tresvant), Myles Truitt (DeVoe), and Tyler Williams (Brown) are set to portray the singers in their younger days. New Edition: The Movie is scheduled to premiere in 2017. All the members of New Edition are signed on as co-producers. The script was written by Abdul Williams (Lottery Ticket) with Chris Robinson (ATL) directing. Yazz’s talents will also be part of the Empire: Original Soundtrack, Season 2 Volume 2 album being released on April 29. AllHipHop.com recently premiered “Got That Work,” the Philadelphia native’s single from the forthcoming compilation. ​ ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202658.65/warc/CC-MAIN-20190322115048-20190322141048-00431.warc.gz
111,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/exclusive-cmurder-hunger-strike-update-in-angola-prison-week-2-tfTQvBdUMEqKT-DbpEet0w/,"The rapper, born Corey Miller, was convicted of the 2002 murder of a 16-year-old named Steven Thomas, inside of a Jefferson Parish nightclub. His initial conviction was overturned in March of 2006, after prosecutors were caught expunging the criminal backgrounds of their witnesses, in order to bolster their credibilty in court.  The case went all the way to Louisiana's Supreme Court in 2009,  a jury found the rapper guilty, he was sentenced to life in prison and sent to Angola Prison.  In 2014, his lawyers filed an appeal citing the statement of a juror named Mary Jacobs, who admitted she was pressured into casting a guilty vote even though she felt he was innocent.  On January 30, 2018, CMurder told AllHipHop.com that he was embarking on a hunger strike in protest of the way guards are treating the inmates.   Representatives for the rapper told AllHipHop.com that CMurder has been punished since speaking out against what he feels are injustices inside of the notorious prison and launching his hunger strike to protest the conditions in Angola Prison. CMurder has been placed in solitary confinement with no light, in a frigid cell.    In addition to his own mistreatment, CMurder has accused the guards of systematic abuse of other inmates.  His latest round of accusations include:  - Instances of guards placing inmates that are on suicide watch in cells with other suicide watch inmates, and neglecting them. - Instances where inmates have had shards of glass in their food and have been poisoned.  - Instances where wardens and officials have allegedly falsified  documents, made up false allegations to cover-up their wrongdoings, leaving inmates with no other choice but to accept the punishment that they are given. In his previous statement announcing his hunger strike, CMurder's reps said that in March of 2017, guards placed the rapper in handcuffs for nearly 24 hours in ""the hole."" His hands were so swollen, the handcuffs had to be cut off his arms.  According to CMurder, he is very active inside of Angola Prison as he serves out his life sentence.  In addition to playing on every sports team the correctional facility offers, CMurder attends church every Friday, is an avid reader, and also takes care of another quadriplegic inmate named Kentrell Parker.  CMurder says he was enrolled in trade school at the time officers locked him up three weeks ago on contraband charges, which he has denied.  The rapper said he realizes there is a debate over his trial, and whether or not he is guilty or innocent. But, he says any abuse of the inmates is intolerable under any circumstance.  Earlier in the week, No Limit founder Master P and Silkk The Shocker weighed in on their brother's challenges. ""Somebody has confessed and they even have footage, that they don’t want to put in the case. My brother is no angel and has done a lot of dumb stuff like most,"" Master P said. ""But I love him and I will fight for him to bring awareness to this injustice. You can’t choose your family but you can choose your friends. When it gets real we all we got."" ""Keep him in Prayers. And if you on the fence. Know that he is 100 percent innocent. Not that it's my brother but it's facts,"" Silkk The Shocker added. ""This system and correctional system in Lousiana is unlike anything u ever seen. When you at least try to be human they want to break you. Will give more details later. But really just a prayer and stay woke."" PRISON C.O.'s like Officer Ricky Don't Give a F*CK if he eats or not....

AllHipHop.com spoke with Fashawn about his current music collection, working with Exile and Nas, touching on deeply personal subjects in his songs, and more. It’s been six years since your last album. How does it feel knowing your official sophomore album is set to be released?  It feels incredible just to still be here six years later. Artists in general have that sophomore slump superstition hanging over their head. I don’t think that’s the case with me and this album. I’m happy we finally have a birthday for the album. It’s been our album for a while, but once it drops it belongs to you guys. Do you feel like you’ve changed as an artist between the two albums?  I think I’m clearer now about what I want to hear from myself than I was back then. I really know when I’m at my best, and I know when I’m at my worse. I’d be the first to tell you, “That was a trash verse.” Whereas times back then, they would have to tell me to rewrite stuff. I think now I have a clear view of what I want to hear and what I want to see. What was the creative process like working with Exile for this album as compared to the first time?  The first time there was a lot more emails back-and-forth. It was like a battle of the emails. I recorded a majority of those vocals in Fresno, California, while Exile would be in Los Angeles or somewhere else around the world.  So the difference between that project and this project is he was more hands on this time. He was there for every session. We were just really perfecting the sound and making sure everything was right for this album. Nas is listed as an executive producer for the album. What was his role in the project’s creation?  Nas was overseeing every song. Every song that I recorded, I would get the critiques from Nas the next day. He played a major role. I can’t thank him enough for that. He actually heard the project when I was still initially working on it. He decided he wanted to executive produce it, so pushing the album back gave him more time to flex his muscle. You also have Nas on the record “Something To Believe In.” What was it like recording with him?  We actually didn’t record that song together in person. That happened over a course of a month or so. Aloe Blacc originally sent me the record, and we just tried to build it from there. I had no clue we could get Nas on this record.  It was one of the more powerful records out of the collection of music we had. Then DJ Khalil took what Aloe and his band had done and gave it a whole new lifespan.  Lastly, we got the verse from Nas. That was incredible. I scratched that off my bucket list instantly. It was a phenomenal experience knowing I’m listening to a verse from Nas that no one else in the world has heard before. “Golden State Of Mind” with Dom Kennedy almost feels like your version of Jay Z’s “Empire State Of Mind.” What was the inspiration for that track?  Shout out to “Empire State Of Mind,” but my influence goes back to Nas’ “New York State Of Mind” off Illmatic. I always wanted an ode to my state. I felt like I was finally ready to do that. I’ve done songs about my region before, but I never really did it on this scale. My coast needed that. My coast needed an anthem. There are a few songs on The Ecology that are very personal like “Man Of The House” and “Mother.” At the beginning of “Mother,” you say, “this is kind of like a love song, but it sort of hurts though.” Was it difficult opening up about such personal issues on a record?  Absolutely, It’s like sharing your scars with society. With “Mother,” I remember my manager specifically asked everyone to leave the room while I was recording that particular song. It’s a touchy subject when you’re not just doing flamboyant and metaphorical raps. You really tap into your personal life, it gets a little more intense. I wouldn’t call it difficult, but it’s definitely different from the normal day at the studio. A lot of artists say they use the recording booth as their own personal psychotherapy session. Did it feel like that for you?  Absolutely, my music is my medicine. That padded room - that place they call the booth - that’s where I’m allowed to go insane or express whatever I’m feeling. It’s a whole other world in there. That’s my utopia. I get to create the world I want to see, as opposed to the world we see outside our windows. It’s a blessing to be able to call myself an artist. I saw you posted on Instagram you recently debuted The Ecology documentary. What’s the idea behind the film?  The documentary is simply my life through the lens of my longtime video director/videographer Punit Dhesi. I chose to do it with him, because I don’t have a relationship with too many directors like I do with him. We’re actually from the same block, and he’s literally been there since day one.  We really just wanted to bring people in closer to my world. They've been seeing me in action, seeing what I do on the microphone. But they don’t know why I do it or the people who helped mold the person they see today. When you came out the gate, you got a lot of exposure. Particularly from being on XXL’s Freshmen cover. Some people feel like that list can be a gift and a curse. Obviously, it gives you publicity, but at the same time it may put a sense of pressure on an artist to reach the level of success of other rappers on the list. Did you ever feel like being on the Freshmen cover put any pressure on you to reach a certain level of success?  I haven’t felt the pressure. I’ve never felt the pressure in that sense. I guess even when you graduate from the Freshman cover to being a sophomore, junior, or senior, you’ll always be put in the “freshman box.” Even in 2015, they’ll always say “2010 Freshman,” and I have no problem with that at all. I’m happy to be part of history with that cover.  Salute to all the guys out here doing their thing. Everyone has their time, and I think mine is now. It might not have been that other year, but that’s between me and God. I feel no pressure to be able to succeed like anyone else. I succeed on my own terms. You end the album with the bonus track “Just Remember Now.” What are some of the moments in your life right now that you know you’ll definitely remember for the rest of your life?  February of 2015. This whole month, maybe this whole year. This is going to be a year to remember for sure. It already has been, but this month for sure. Giving birth to the new album will be a milestone in my life.  -  Follow Fashawn on Twitter @fashawn and Instagram @therealfashawn.

He's a traditional producer and self-taught instrumentalist. The Queens, New York native completely immerses himself in the full creation of the music, and his tracks provide a throwback feel to classic Soul/R&B while bringing in a touch of modern Hip Hop.  AllHipHop.com recently interviewed James Worthy to discuss his buzzing career. The DreammusikGroup CEO talked about his production influences, his affiliation with Jay Z's Roc Nation, appearing on the Centric reality series From The Bottom Up, and more. How did you get involved in making music? I’m originally from New York. That gave me a lot of inspiration growing up with different genres of music. I was a big fan of A Tribe Called Quest, and my favorite producer was Q-Tip. My favorite R&B group was Dru Hill.  I started researching, honing in on the craft, and checking out different producers. I learned about instrumentation. I was fascinated with the production aspect, and I started making my own tracks. Were there any other producers that you studied? Besides Q-Tip, I studied Timbaland, Organized Noise, and Pharrell. It really came down to anybody that was innovative at the time.  Do you typically work in the studio with the artists or do you send tracks to them?  It depends. Sometimes you’ll have a label who wants you to do a record with someone, and sometimes you can’t sit in the studio with that person. I do make it an effort to be in the studio with the artist, because it’s more of an organic feel. You want to have that vibe and make sure everybody’s on the same page. Sending stuff back-and-forth through email, something could be left out that could be very important to the song. So it depends on what the situation is. You mentioned labels. Can you talk about your affiliation with Roc Nation? Shout out to Roc Nation. I’m not signed to Roc Nation. My cousin is an A&R for Roc Nation, so we do a lot of work with them. I do songwriting with Roc Nation, and we’re getting more into the production phase over there as well. You’ve embraced working with artists of different eras. Do you change your style when you’re working with a more established artist like B Angie B and Robin S? I like to work with artists from the 90’s or even before that who really had their time, but they were kind of left out of the transition of the industry. These are artists that have made their mark in the industry, so why not give them another hit record? If you’re doing that, then everyone's going to come to you for that sound.  I also work with a lot of mainstream, modern artists. I’ve worked with Future, Young Thug, and Tip [T.I.]. I just did a record with Bone Crusher. I’m hands on with the new generation as well. My focus is to bring back good music. You’ve worked closely with Sara Stokes of Making The Band. How did you connect? I’m Sara’s producer. I do all of her new music right now. We’ve known each other for a while. We met and hit it off. Our chemistry is dope, and she has a great personality. I love her energy. Once we got in the studio, we never stopped making music.  Now we’re working on her new album. She’ll be on the new reality show From The Bottom Up. It’s a lot going on. The show focuses on artists that are trying to rebuild there lives and careers after going through some tough times. With you working so closely with Sara, did you get any insight about ways to avoid some of the pitfalls that come with being part of the entertainment industry? She’s been through a lot. I’ve been through a lot. Her thing is just to keep positive energy and positive people around her. I do the same thing. She’s turning over a new leaf, so she’s letting everyone know what’s going on. Everybody saw the TMZ stuff, the bad stuff the media wants to put out.  She’s embracing that, because it’s all about growing, letting people know your story, and overcoming that adversity. When you see this new show, you’ll see she’s letting it all out for the world to see.  We’re letting everybody know that you can overcome anything. The success we’re having with our single, the success she’s having with this show, and future successes we’re going to have - that’s all God. I read that you’re making a cameo on the show. Yes, I’ll be in an episode with Sara. You’ll see us in the studio working on our single “Sneak Peak.” It’s a good platform for both of us. Do you have any interest in doing your own reality show? I’m not opposed to it. I’ve done other TV work before. I always say if it makes sense, then I'm definitely interested. Everything right now has to coincide with the brand. You also worked with Bobby Brown Jr. Or is he going by… King Jayare? I don’t really know what he’s going by now. But I’ve been working with Bobby Jr. for years. We’ve done a lot of music together. I’ve done records with him and his father. He’s a good kid.  I found it interesting he veered more toward rap as opposed to R&B, especially with his dad being the self-described “King of R&B.” He does a lot of R&B as well. He raps, sings, and dances. He’s an entertainer just like his pops. You’re from New York, and you work in Atlanta. There’s been a conversation over the last week about the state of southern Hip Hop. There’s some people that say rap music in the south - as far as its dominance - is on the decline. Do you feel like there’s a very distinct difference between what’s happening in Atlanta and other regions? In the industry period, there’s a lot of creativity, but the actual substance or content in the music is lacking. A lot of times, you don’t really know what’s a “hit record” right now. It’s 50-50.  In the south region, I think a lot of the rap music - which could be considered Trap music - is going to fade out. It’s the same stuff being recreated over and over. I think people are kind of getting over it.  I think it’s time for good music to come back which is why you’re seeing a lot more R&B and older heads from back in the day coming out. Even rap music - I think more quality rap music is going to come back. As a producer, I know you keep your ear to the street about the music scene. Are there any up-and-coming artists that have caught your attention? There’s a ton of them. There’s an African pop star I’m working with right now. Her name is Zaena Morisho. She’s very huge in Africa and overseas. She’s gaining a fan base in the States right now. She has a lot of other artists around her that are doing very well like Rey Fonder. He’s a phenomenal indie artist. I also like female rapper Marlé Blu out of Atlanta. There’s so many of them. What can listeners expect from you this year? You can expect so many things - singles, TV appearances, films, albums, modeling. I have a couple of singles coming out. Zaena Morisho’s “One Thing” is out now. I have a brand new single with B Ange B entitled “Shake.” That’ll be out on the 29th. I have a new single with Bone Crusher featuring Dave Tolliver of Men At Large. There’s so many different things.

DJ Drama added his influential Gangsta Grillz tag to the tape, and other acts such as Young Thug were recruited for guest appearances. Kap G’s i am OTHER imprint founder Pharrell Williams provides production. In addition, Squat Beats, KE On The Track, Zone 36, and others constructed the sounds found on El Southside. Kap G is looking to eventually drop a 10-track studio album via Atlantic Records. But before Young Migo lets loose an LP, he spoke with AllHipHop.com about El Southside. The ""La Policia” performer also touches on starring in Dope, Donald Trump’s plan to build a wall on the Mexican border, and more. Was it your intent to combine your Atlanta influence and Mexican roots on El Southside? Yeah, in my own way. I felt like a lot of people rocked with my first mixtape Like A Mexican, but I felt like some people didn’t understand it. So with El Southside, I just wanted to bring them to my side of town, let them know what it is. Kind of dumb it down for the people, but still give my type of style. Whose idea was it for El Southside to be a Gangsta Grillz release? It just kind of happened. At first I was going to do an EP. I record at DJ Drama’s Mean Street Studio. One time I had a meeting with my team. We were just talking about what if Drama hosted the mixtape and it’s a Gangsta Grillz. We chopped it up with Drama, and he was with it. That’s a pretty big stamp of approval when you get that Gangsta Grillz on the cover. Yeah, definitely. Shout out to DJ Drama. He’s been rocking with me since about 3 or 4 years ago. I met Drama on Peters Street, and he’s been a cool cat ever since. He’s definitely a legend, and I appreciate everything he’s done for me. On the project, you feature a few Atlanta artists. You have Young Thug, Lucci, and Cash Out. As a young artist from the city, do you feel like Atlanta artists are open to working together? I feel like we work together. It’s not really too many people that’s on that, “I’m not really f-cking with him.” A lot of people get along. I feel like that’s what makes the culture go further for Atlanta’s music. We support each other. You have the song “Power” with YFN Lucci. Was the theme of the song’s video based on real experiences? That was just a concept I had. It didn’t happen just like that. I could relate to it. A lot of it is kind of [based on real experiences], but I didn’t try to do [what happens in the video]. Your song “La Policia” came out before the Mike Brown killing and the Black Lives Matter movement became a big news item. Why was it important for you to speak on that issue at the time that you did? With my music, I want to be able to touch somebody’s heart. I want the listeners to relate to me. I feel like there’s not a lot of people still doing that. You might listen to the radio and hear songs about having fun, but you don’t really hear songs with substance much no more. I just wanted to give that to people. Also, it was based on a real experience I had. Something happened to me the day before. I got pulled over and the police were on some real f-ck sh-t. I went to the studio the next day and wrote that track. Unfortunately, all the stuff happened with police taking a lot of lives, so the song was brought back into action some months later. I wrote that song like a year before it started buzzing. One of the things you talk about on the song is how people treat undocumented immigrants in this country. That’s a big topic now with Donald Trump. What are your thoughts about Trump saying he’s going to build a wall to prevent Mexicans from coming into the country? That’s just pure ignorance. I can’t relate to that. At the end of the day, I feel like it’s just entertainment. To me, it’s not real at all. If it was anybody of color saying that, the media would make it a big thing. But because it’s Trump, they're not going to say nothing to him. That’s why it’s our job as artists to be the voice for the people. How involved is Pharrell in your career? He’s very involved. I just seen bro like 2 days ago. He flew me out to L.A. to work. He’s a mentor. He really supports me. He tells me, ""You need to do this with your music."" If he sees anything wrong, he just keeps me on the right track. He played a role in you being featured in Dope. Pharrell actually helped me with that. I was in Atlanta. I got a call. They said, ""I want you to audition for this Dope movie."" I was like, “Cool, I’m with it.” I play a character named Fidel. He’s like this Mexican gangster dude. They didn’t really want me to play it at first. They wanted more of the typical cholo with a bald head and tattoos all over. They gave me a try, and when I got on set they were happy with what I did. Do people ever come up to you and say, “Are you a real? Or are you a fake?” [laughs] Yeah, people ask me that. It’s crazy to have an impactful role that a lot of people remember. I remember growing up watching films that were classic to me. When I see people that were in those films now, I’m like, “Damn, that’s bro right there.” I never thought I’d be in a movie. It’s crazy. Are you interested in doing more acting? Definitely. One of your label mates, Bia, was on Sisterhood Of Hip Hop. Any chance we could see Kap G on a reality show in the future? Not really. I don’t really do the reality shows. Shout out to my homie Bia. She’s killing. She got that song “Gucci Comin Home.” It’s going crazy. Are there any particular artists you’d like to work with? I want to work with Kanye one day. He’s my favorite rapper and one of my favorite producers. I want to work with Pharrell on a song, not on production. We always work on production, but we never did a song together before. That would be dope. And just my partners that’s around me. You did some modeling for Rocksmith. Is that something else you’d like to pursue? Yeah, I’ll do that. Anything for the check. Shout out to Rocksmith. I like fashion, so hopefully I’ll get into it more. You’ve said your music is based on your experiences in life. So with your track “Girlfriend,” are your boys now more cautious of you being around their girl after that song came out? [laughs] Nah, man. I’m a loyal individual. I wouldn’t do my partners like that, and they wouldn’t do me like that. Like I said, that was real. We take flicks with people’s girlfriends. [laughs] What else do you have coming up in the near future? I’m definitely shooting the video for my song “Move On Up.” I want to shoot one for “Don’t Need Em” with Thug. We’re going to have new visuals coming soon. Purchase Kap G’s El Southside on iTunes and Google Play. Follow Kap G on Twitter @TheRealKapG and Instagram @therealkapg.

117,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/exclusive-shawnna-says-if-dtp-chaka-zulu-ludacris-want-to-go-to-war-with-her-she-s-ready-KZb4dc5pWkWkU5u68y2SzQ/," AllHipHop.com broke the story that Zulu  supposedly made the decision to prevent Shawnna from walking the event’s  red carpet at the last minute. [ALSO READ: EXCLUSIVE: Shawnna’s Rep Claims She Was Denied Access To BET Hip Hop Awards, Replaced By Lil Mama] Shawnna split with Zulu, Ludacris and DTP years ago, and by all  public accounts it seemed to be a civil separation. Or at least, that’s  how the parties involved presented it in the media. According to  Shawnna, that was just a facade done out of the belief in loyalty. Behind the scenes issues over lost million dollar deals, allegations  of owed money, and contract disputes actually forced a not-so-friendly  divide between DTP and the “Gettin’ Some” performer, but both sides  still kept the drama in-house. The closeted problems weighed on Shawnna. The dark side of the  industry became so hard to deal with that she says it killed her passion  to make music. Shawnna decided to step away from Hip Hop and returned  to Chicago to work at a club owned by her father – Blues legend Buddy  Guy. After a few years separated from the business, Shawnna could not  reconcile just walking away from something she committed nearly a decade  worth of time and effort. A need to be an inspiration for her children  and seeing female rap re-emerging in a major way sparked the emcee to  rediscover her enthusiasm for recording. She hoped the BET Hip Hop  Awards would be the site of her national return to the spotlight. But  that ambitious move would not happen. AllHipHop.com spoke exclusively with Shawnna about what went down in  Atlanta and her current feelings about the Disturbing Tha Peace camp.     https://soundcloud.com/shawnna-guy/shawnna-getting-to-it  What happened at the BET Hip Hop Awards? It’s crazy. We put a lot of money and effort into getting down to  Atlanta for BET Hip Hop Awards weekend, so we could promote my new  single “Gettin’ To It.” It’s getting a lot of buzz here at home in  Chicago, but it takes more than that to break a record. So we were all  set up, ready to go down there, mingle with DJs, and get a good look on  the red carpet. I actually didn’t even know they were considering me for the cypher.  We were right outside of Atlanta, and they contacted my manager and  said, “We might have another slot in the cypher, and we’re considering  Shawnna.” So we hit the metal a little harder [laughs]. When we get there, my manager says, “Shawnna I need to talk to you.  Our PR person just got word from BET that you have been denied access to  the red carpet and the BET Hip Hop Awards.” At that moment, my whole  world stopped. It had been a minute since I had been this excited about  getting back on the scene and letting everybody know I’m ready. I was  embarrassed, hurt, angry, all in one. That was the straw that broke the  camel’s back. A lot of people have been asking me the past four years, “What’s up  with you and DTP? What happened?” It just brought back old emotions of  the same type of stuff I was dealing with when I was with this label. I  said, “I’m fed up. I’m not taking this anymore.” It’s been four years.  I’ve been nothing but cordial about the situation. I never bad mouthed  this company. I never said a bad thing about Ludacris. I just wished them all the best. Knowing that I knew other things  could be said to ruffle the feathers, to play the dirty side. This is in  no way a ploy to promote a mixtape, cause I don’t even have a mixtape  right now. All I was trying to do was get down there and make a little  noise with my single, network, communicate with people. They just tried  to put a stop on everything. But God is good. We kept grinding. We kept  doing our thing. All-in-all it didn’t turn out to be a bad situation. But the things  we had planned to do never happened, because of some situation with  Disturbing Tha Peace not wanting me to be involved in it.  “Gettin’ To It” Cover Art There was never really any public discussion about exactly what  happened with the split between you and DTP. From the outside looking  in, it seemed like it ended with everybody being cool with each other. I made the decision to keep it cordial. I’m not the type of person  that likes negativity. The way my faith is set up, I feel like they’re  going to get it back from a Higher Power. So, I never wanted to go out  and blast the company or Luda, because overall it was one of my best  experiences in my career. Don’t get me wrong, there were a lot of things I didn’t agree with. I  just chucked it up to being part of the business. But something would  say, “Nah, this ain’t good business.” It’s no secret I was with them for ten years, and all I had was two  albums. I had a feature here and there, but it wasn’t enough. People  would come up to me and say, “Shawnna didn’t get the push that she  needed.”  I don’t have to say all these negative things about them. The  proof is there. After four years of me being cordial, me not saying anything, they  want to take the position to still try to keep their foot on my neck.  What could I have done – me independently with my own cash – walking the  red carpet? I know what I could have done if I got in that cypher.  Don’t get it twisted. But me just trying to network and letting the  people know I’m back working, how could that have hurt them in any way? I  don’t understand it, and I’m sick of it. Nobody’s over there. I left.  Everybody else left. It ain’t rocket science. I haven’t signed any deals. I haven’t done anything in the industry  since then. If they think that I’m still going to allow them to have  publishing on me after I broke away from that company, they got s**t  f**ked up. They’ve awaken a sleeping giant. I wanted it to be a situation where we kept it cordial and walked  away amicably. But when they made this move and took this shot at me,  they knocked the top of the pot off. What was BET’s reason that they gave on why you weren’t allowed to participate? BET was just saying that they had gone into a partnership with  Disturbing Tha Peace. They came together to present the festivities.  This, in my opinion, is what gave [DTP] the authority to do so. No shade  to BET. BET has always shown me mad, mad love, so I know this had  nothing to do with them. That’s the other reason I’m so upset. I know  exactly where it came from. In any interview you’ve seen or heard me in, I’ve never said anything  bad about [DTP]. After four years of being silent and turning the other  cheek – to still try to take this slap from them. I’m not taking it  laying down in no way. To me it’s saying they still want to go to war  with me. They got a problem. If you got a problem with me, okay we can  address it. We can get it out there. What you wanna do? You can’t keep  going in my pocket. Are you still contractually tied to them? No, I’m not. I have not been signed to Disturbing Tha Peace for four  years. I have no connection to them. I haven’t even spoken to Luda since  before we even got to the split. I haven’t spoken to Luda since we were  in the studio working on [the intended Shawnna-Ludacris collaborative  album] Battle Of The Sexes. I don’t understand why after four years, y’all still wanna take this  shot at me. I have no idea what their next move could be, because I had  no idea they’d make this move. I honestly thought they were on the same  page as me – we’re going to let what happened between us, be between us.  Let’s move forward on our own paths amicably. Obviously, I was wrong. Do I just take this and walk away with it? Or I do let it be known  I’m not going to take this. I rep my city. So if I take an “L”, my city  takes an “L”. I can’t do that. I love them too much, and they love me  too much. Females in the industry cannot afford to take “Ls” like that. If I  win, females win. If I lose, females lose. That’s how I look at it. So  even if I wanted to say, “Ah man, whatever. I’m gonna just walk away.”  It’s not just doing that for me. We already got so much against us. It doesn’t seem like there’s issues from your side. From what  you’re saying, the problem is coming from them. Is there anything they  could do at this point to smooth the situation over? You ever heard of “too little, too late.” Ludacris knows. DTP knows.  They see me. They’ve seen my interviews. They’ve heard my records. They  know I never said anything negative about him nor his company. They know  that. So why would you take it upon yourself to try and stop me from  doing what I wanna do? It was a complete slap in the face. It would be different if  something was building or if we bumped into each other and had words or  my camp was shooting shots at their camp. It was nothing. The waters  were calm. So over the last four years, they haven’t given any indication they had an issue with anything that you were doing? Nothing at all. It was: I don’t speak of him and he doesn’t speak of  me. When people would ask me, “What happened with the DTP situation? Why  did you leave Luda?” I would just say, “I wish Disturbing Tha Peace and  Ludacris nothing but success. All good things come to an end.” That’s what I said each and every time. I am a very loyal person.  Regardless of what people said at the time of our split – I mean they  threw me way under the bus. I let them go with it, because the media,  they don’t care about the real story. They want that story. So I let them go with it, but I’ve always been loyal. I know you’re in the studio right now putting in work. Yeah, I need to be heard. I need for this to be known. People think  I’m dead, gone, buried alive. People think I just walked away, I’m done.  No, I’m out here working. It’s just so many situations with people  trying to have their foot on my neck. For so long I was always playing the nice guy. Saying, “Things happen  for a reason. It’s gonna get greater later.” F**k that s**t! I’m done  with that. I’m done playing the nice guy. If that’s what I gotta do,  then that’s what I gotta do. You wanna go to war with me,  I’m war  ready. Point, blank, period. You wanna leave me alone, then leave me  alone. You wanna go at it with me, let’s go.

119,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/exclusive-struggle-jennings-addresses-black-curtains-video-controversy-more-YN5EeiumXEOYphFawxecgA/,"The grandson of legendary country singer Waylon Jennings admits to  losing his way to the streets for a while, but when the man Struggle  calls his “father figure” passed away while he was locked up in 2002 he  decided it was time to take his rap passion seriously. With a goal of  carrying on Waylon’s legacy and creating his own, Struggle set out on a  musical path that has led to an international fan base that  appreciates his heartfelt lyrics and personal story of redemption. Part of that connection was established by Struggle’s latest video  “Black Curtains.” The song serves as a message to his son, “Little  Will,” who actually stars in the clip. The video also made headlines earlier this month after  Tennessee’s Davidson County Sheriff’s Office accused  the incarcerated emcee of misleading jail officials in order to film  jailhouse scenes for the video. Struggle, currently housed at the  Northeast Correctional Complex, has denied that he tricked DCSO  officials and wanted the opportunity to set the record the straight  about the situation. AllHipHop.com connected with Struggle through his reps via e-mail to  get his side of the story. The Nashville native also discusses the  inspiration for his video, when he’s scheduled to be released, and what  his fans can expect from him next. AllHipHop.com: Why were you placed in jail and what is the current status of your incarceration? When will you be released? Struggle Jennings: I was arrested on charges of  conspiracy with 200 keys of cocaine and 300 pounds of weed, but it was  dropped down to conspiracy of cocaine “of special amounts,” and they  gave me 13 and a half years at 30%. The DEA had a three-year  investigation on a suspected drug ring from Nashville to California, and  my voice was caught on phone taps with suspected cartel members. I really can’t talk too much about it though because they’re still  going to trial on it, and I don’t wanna incriminate any of my charge  partners. I’m also serving time for a federal drug charge that I caught  in 2010. I’ve been incarcerated for 2 years now but I just made parole  on my state charges, so I’ll be transferred to federal custody in  February. I’ll be home by the summer of 2014. What was the inspiration for your Black Curtains song/video? Man, a couple of years ago my brother Jellyroll said something to me  about my son. He said, “little Will is gonna be just like you bruh.” And  it took me back to when I was younger, remembering people saying that  to me about my dad. I remember always hearing stories after he was  killed about how he was hustling and he had all these cars and guns and  jewelry. I didn’t realize it at the time, but my whole life I strived to be  just like that. It was like a curtain blocking my view of any other  option. So when Jelly said that it finally clicked. I gotta change that.  I gotta tear down that black curtain so he’ll have a clear view of his  future. You know I got 5 kids, and I want them all to reach their full  potential and live out their dreams, not get caught in the same cycle  that I did. You know, it’s dark when you’re living in the shadows. What exactly was the arrangement between yourself, the  production company, and the Davidson County Sheriff’s Office concerning  the filming at the site? Well here’s the real deal, from the horse’s mouth. We were shooting a  documentary before I got locked up. I was at a crazy point in my life,  facing 30 plus years, struggling to record the album I always wanted to  make, and lay down my testimony. Trying to hold my family together at  the same time. My brother Yelawolf and my whole extended Slumerican  family pushed to get a film crew to follow me and document everything  that was going on, but we were interrupted by the U.S. Marshals. So while I was at Davidson County Jail awaiting trial, we asked to  get clearance so we could shoot more footage. It was a long shot, but  they allowed us 45 minutes supervised by an officer and a public  relations representative from DCSO. I signed all the release forms  saying I was allowing them to film me and interview me. During the  shooting we asked if we could do a performance scene of me rapping the  verses to one of my songs. Of course they said yes, or we wouldn’t even  be talking about this. There was an MP3 player sitting right on the  table in front of me playing the song while we filmed four or five  separate takes of the whole thing. Then they let the film crew walk me  back to my unit. We even asked if they needed to review anything before it was  released, and they declined the offer. So when “Black Curtains” was  released, I guess someone got in trouble for the decisions they made,  and they tried to push the blame off on me. So it is what it is. We’re  still working on the full version of the documentary. We’re actually  about to launch a Kickstarter campaign to raise the funds to finish it.  I’m in prison so it’s not like I’m in here making money, but as soon as  the rest of the budget’s in place it’ll be finished. We didn’t try to  “trick” anybody. We just used a bad situation to put out a positive  message, and we didn’t let any obstacles stand in our way. Have you been admonished or punished in any why by jail officials? Nah, everybody up here at Northeast is cool. It’s all love and  respect as far as the staff and everybody goes… so far. I mean, I might  end up in the hole after this interview, but we’ll jump that hurdle too. Has there been any word about the suspected lawsuit by the DCSO? Nah man. There’s no word of lawsuits. We didn’t break any laws. What  are they gonna do? Sue us for the money that we charged people to watch a  free video on YouTube?! Like come on, for real? If they do, it wouldn’t  be my first time in a courtroom anyway. Do you have any plans to edit the video like the DCSO has requested? No. There’s no reason to. We didn’t depict anybody in a negative way.  The message of the video is positive, and I’m not going to change that. Despite the story of you “tricking” officials, the response  on our site has been overwhelming positive towards your music. Do you  see the whole situation as possibly being a blessing in disguise?  Yeah, it’s definitely been a blessing. It helped a message that  needed to be heard reach an audience that I might not have been able to  reach. The song, the video, it’s all part of my testimony. And God works  in mysterious ways, you know? It shows that if something needs to be  heard it will be. You can’t hold back the truth, and the world is in  dire need of some truth and optimism right now. So I don’t even care  about the backlash, as long as people hear the message. If it changes  one person’s life it would be worth a few years in court anyway. So I’m  gonna keep making music that’s true to me and hope that it reaches the  people that need to hear it. Any other music projects on the way? Yeah this is just the beginning. Of course we got the documentary  coming up real soon, and we’re about to drop some more videos over the  next few months. I just released my debut album I Am Struggle a  couple of months ago. We’re talking about doing a remix album based off  those songs because there’s a lot of producers reaching out to my camp  right now. We also came up with the idea to do a live album using just  my vocals with a band replaying all the tracks, so we’re working on  putting that band together down in Nashville right now. I recorded a lot of music before I got locked up though, and we held  on to some of my biggest records, so I’ll definitely be putting out some  new songs this winter. I’m just riding the wave man. Seeing where this  all takes me. I had a vision to speak the truth and put a positive  message out there, but do it in a way that people would really pay  attention. So just to know that they’re listening is really all that  matters. For more information about Struggle Jennings visit his Facebook page. Stream/purchase Struggle’s I Am Struggle album below.

I’m in here for a simple probation violation. I was on five year suspended sentence probation. Me and my b*tch were arguing and the neighbor called the cops and I was arrested two months later because I had come in contact with the police. I was at the house chilling and they arrested me. I was thinking that I was going to get right out but I violated my probation. In California if you are on probation and you come in to contact with the Police, that’s a violation of your probation. I have to finish my suspended sentence but they are only having me do eighty percent of it. AllHipHop.com: I had read reports on various gossip sites that you had beat up your girlfriend. Tha Chill: It was a simple argument. The neighbors called the cops and we were in the front yard talking sh*t. My girl didn’t call the Police on me – it was the neighbors. We didn’t even know that they had called the Police – we left. I didn’t know any of this until two months later. The cops showed up at my doorstep with a felony warrant and I’m like, “For what?” They told me that it was because the cops were called on me and I was on suspended sentence probation. AllHipHop.com: Man, they can take you in as easily as that? Tha Chill: Yeah, it was something I learned. Instead of fighting it, and with my prior record, it was worth it to take the deal just to get it out of the way, so that’s what I’m doing now. I’m just sitting here and getting it over with so I can get out and not be on probation anymore. AllHipHop.com: How much time have you officially served already? Tha Chill: I’ve been down for two years and I’ve got one more to officially go. Time is ticking and I’m getting this sentence behind me. I miss my family, my kids and making my music. AllHipHop.com: How are you holding up inside there? Tha Chill: I’m in here doing my thing, with the whole Hub to Dub car (Compton & Watts). A lot of people recognize me but they know that I’m a street dude first before a rapper. Nobody’s trying to step to me or be on some bullsh*t. There be sh*t happening but I’m not involved in any of that sh*t. AllHipHop.com: What’s your Prison day like? Tha Chill: I wake up at 4 a.m. and do about a thousand push-ups, brush my teeth, take a shower, and shave my head. Go eat some food like oatmeal with an apple pie. I’ll go chill with the homies and see what’s up with them for a minute. I’ll watch some news, TMZ, and Wendy Williams. Then I’ll go work out some more and then work on my Compton’s Most Wanted book that I’m trying to put out. I’d love to make a movie about it when I get out. It’s the story of me and MC Eiht on our beginnings and how we got to this point. I think my story can encourage people whether they are in Prison or on the streets and help them to stay out of trouble and how the California system works. AllHipHop.com: Are you able to make any kind of music at all in there? I’ve spoken to several artists who were incarcerated and some even had access to recording equipment. Tha Chill: They have programs in Church. I play drums for a band. There are real talented people in here that unfortunately will never see the streets. We have fun together and I’ve learned a lot from these guys. There are drum machines and other instruments in here but you can’t just go get them whenever you want them. AllHipHop.com: Your camp recently released a new album from you called Chillstrumentals that’s on iTunes. Tha Chill: My partner has a lot of the music that I’ve made and he convinced me to not let it sit while I’m in here. We put together some stuff from my catalogue to make an album and secured distribution through Empire. I reached out to the people on my Facebook and asked for suggestions on a title and so many responded. One of them hit me on my inbox and suggested Chillstrumentals. I thought it was good idea to do something like Pete Rock and play a beat before a song comes on. I also put some cuts from my 1st Generation(includes Kurupt, Jayo Felony, King T, Sir Jinx, MC Eiht, DJ Battlecat, Gangsta) group on there to just let people know that we still plan on rocking together. We just all want to be present. I want people to hear my talents as a Producer. A lot of people think that I just rap. Then there are those that think that I just produce and don’t rap. Chillstrumentals is just a reminder to people while I’m away of what I can still do. AllHipHop.com: I’m glad that 1st Generation is still in the plans because I honestly gave up on it. Tha Chill: Nah, what happened was Gangsta (formerly of Tha Comrads) went to jail and we were waiting on him to get out. Then Jayo Felony went to jail too. It’s crazy because I’m trying to keep all of my homies out of jail and I end up here. We’ve got priors and that’s California for you. I spoke with the other members and we decided that we are still going to do it but we need everybody present for it.

121,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/exclusive-ty-dolla-ign-sounds-off-on-new-ep-and-imitators-duUWIBnqqUmtgb9NLnZeIQ/," It’s called Beach House the EP. I’m keeping the Beach House name because it was successful as a free Mixtape series but now I want to make it as something that I can sell. It’s going for Pre-Sale on January 7 and available on January 20.  You probably should’ve started selling your projects from the start.   I wish I did but there were still a lot of people out there unaware of me. The free Mixtapes were for advertising.  So what’s in for us on the new EP?  Avatar 2.  Avatar 2?  It’s a sequel to Avatar – the best movie (laughs). Oh I see. You’re going James Cameron on us. What about an official album? I hope to have that done by June of 2014 so I can take the summer. I’m just trying to perfect it and it to the next level from Beach House the EP, because the EP is on another level than the Mixtapes.  Earlier on stage, you jumped on the MPC and started playing something and you told the crowd that you produced YG’s first hit, “Toot It and Boot It.”  I produced “Toot It and Boot It” and half of the songs on Beach House 1 and 2 – just like on the upcoming EP.  A lot of people don’t know of your producing side. I actually taught DJ Mustard how to produce. I gave him the sounds and he passed me up on producing – so shout out to him. That’s my little n*gga, ya know? He teaches me sh*t now.  The Student surpassed the Teacher. Exactly.  You and DJ Mustard created a new path for artists on the West Coast, because there was a time when artists from the West couldn’t get on the radio, and that started to change after the “Toot It and Boot It” song.  My big homie Big D, he put us all together; Me, YG, and DJ Mustard. We were all up at my old house in Baldwin Hills, at the top of the hill, and we would make music every day. We came up with this sound and people later on ended up calling it the Ratchet sound.  Were you following a blueprint?  Not really. I was listening to the Atlanta stuff because it was real popular at the time with 808’s and snaps. I took that and sped it up to how we were listening to music out here. The Bay was popping with the Hyphy sound at that time. I was on that same speed but I took the Atlanta drums and mixed it with samples because I love to sample. I like J. Dilla and producers like that. I took a little sample mixed it with some drums and made “Toot It and Boot It.” From there I just started exploring and made different types of beats from House to Cabana. DJ Mustard told me that I was tripping and to just make club sh*t and he went off on that route. Do you think that you get enough credit on the West Coast?  It’s cool. I don’t care about that. I want to make good music and they are going to recognize it. The music will speak for itself. I’m not one of those dudes that will trip off it and try to get attention – I don’t give a f*ck. I’m going to make good music and all of my family is going to eat.  I ask that because I saw a post on your Twitter feed where you were talking about Ty Dolla $ign and DJ Mustard imitators out there.  That post was about others making up their own sh*t. That’s what we were trying to do. If it starts growing that’s cool, but try to make a new sound. I’m never going to try to copy what’s out and I felt that was the problem with music for the longest time. No matter which producer is hot at the moment, you’ve got a bunch of others trying to copy their sound. Everybody is copying each other but its better when everybody does their own sh*t. If you go back to the 70’s and listen to groups like Lakeside, The Isley Brothers and Earth, Wind and Fire – they all had their own sound. We are the Pushaz Ink band and we make our sound, and so all of the other n*ggas that copy what we do, they lose – straight up. They say imitation is a form of flattery though.  It definitely shows that we are doing our sh*t. Really, I’m glad to see dudes from L.A. on. When you look back at Snoop Dogg when he first came out, everybody was trying to copy the Death Row sound. It’s cool that we are out here and we are the new Death Row and these other n*ggas are like Ruthless (laughs). No disrespect to Eazy-E – shout out to him and what he did. I’m just saying some real sh*t. Dr. Dre had his sound and everybody else was trying to copy him. Then Dre came out with a different sound on Chronic 2001 and everybody started to copy that too. N*ggas be biting. That sh*t is weak.  What’s next for your sound?  I’ve got a new sound on the EP. There’s the club sh*t too like on Paranoid and the remix. I hooked up with Young Chop and I’ve got one of his beats on there. I got some sh*t with Cardo but the sample didn’t get cleared so I grabbed my guitar, my other homie got on bass, another played the organ and violin and we created something new that sounds like a sample. You can’t stop this.  You made a few songs with Terrace Martin that had a jazzy vibe and I think that’s a good style for you.   Thanks. That’s where I kind of originated. Out here in Los Angeles, there is a station called KCRW with a DJ named Garth Trinidad – a mixture of soul and hip-hop sh*t. Also, back in the day I used to sing background for Sa-Ra Creative Partners. I listen to J. Dilla and all that type of sh*t so that’s what I love and like to do – but the people really like what I’m doing right now, so I’m going to keep on doing it (laughs).  Earlier, you brought out Wiz Khalifa during your performance.  That’s my big homie in the Taylor Gang. I hit Wiz up to see if he was in town for the show and he was like, “What’s up n*gga? Happy Turkey Day.” He definitely came out and killed it.  ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202525.25/warc/CC-MAIN-20190321132523-20190321154523-00361.warc.gz

The Louisiana native talks about surviving the New Orleans streets, his 24-year career and time spent on No Limit Records. (AllHipHop Features) Although the early 90’s New Orleans rap scene was predominantly held down by Cash Money Records, another locally owned record label by the name of Big Boy Records slowly created an exceptional roster headlined by Mystikal. Along with the, then “braided up pimp” was a raspy voiced self-proclaimed, “Baddest Motherfucker Alive,” Fiend. That would be the single that burst, Fiend (New Orleans native) onto the scene. His first album, “I Won’t Be Denied,” released in 1995 was a local classic. Fiend, would find national success 3-years later after signing with Master P’s, No Limit Records. After appearances on several No Limit projects he released his first studio album on the label in 1998 entitled, “There’s One In Every Family,” which peaked at No. 8 on the Billboard 200 and No. 1 on the Top R&B-Hip Hop Albums chart. Fiend would go on to enjoy much success under the No Limit banner and had hit collaborations with the likes of Mystikal, Master P, Snoop Dogg, Mac and Mia X. During a brief stint on the Ruff Ryders label, he collaborated with the legendary Memphis group, Three Six Mafia on a track titled, “Touched Wit It.” With more than 10-studio albums to his credit and a 24-year career under his belt, Fiend, much like his popular track with now deceased, Mr. Magic, has been through it all. He’s seen the peaks and valleys of being an artist/producer and much like the No Limit Tank in the 90’s, he continues to march on and soldier through the good and the bad that this industry has to offer. I had a chance to speak with “Mr. Whomp Whomp,” to discuss his first interaction with Master P, KLC, Mia X and Kane and Abel’s influence on getting him TO No Limit Records and holding his own lyrically on great rosters. AllHipHop.com: In the early 90’s, when you hit the scene, being called a fiend was an insult, but you made it work. Where did the name, Fiend come from? Fiend: I looked up to the greats that came before me like, Rakim. He called himself “The Microphone Fiend.” Fiend just seemed to stick, and I made it more about fiending to take care of my family, fiending to better myself or fiending to bust rhymes. I was fiending to battle cats and annihilate them on the microphone. AllHipHop.com: You are 24-years into your career. How did you stick around this game for so long? Fiend: How I have stayed in this business for so long and kept my head high is I stayed “fuck boy” free. I stayed “fuck boy” and “fuck girl” free. You don’t have to be running with the in-crowd just because they are the in-crowd. Sometimes you have to be in the in-crowd even if you’re dolo. I’m well-grounded and that’s what works for me. I move around, I’m the type of dude that’s always moved without any kind of security. Not so much that I didn’t need it to maneuver a lil bit at certain heights of my career, but I just thought it was crazy to hire somebody that is ready to die for me at a certain wage. It’s like, how is this going to go? I’ve always had great parents, great family and great friendships. I never jeopardized anything for the in-crowd. AllHipHop.com: The title of your debut album was, “Won’t Be Denied.” Was that the mentality coming into this game? Fiend: Yeah, I was going through a real unique time. I went through a lot of losses and that was just my goal. I didn’t know what could have been before me but being a cat from Louisiana… we’re just not scared of a lot of things. I felt like I had survived the warzone. I survived this neighborhood; I survived school and my teachers being on strike. I done sat at bus stops hoping and praying that I make it home. I had been through so much I just felt like, as long as I can block out all of that noise and keep going, with nothing on the other side of fear, I could get there. I have a song with the late, Mr. Magic called, “Been Through It All.” I was a kid in the passenger seat, so it allowed me to be able to talk about a lot of things. I seen a lot of things and experienced a lot of things, so “Been Through It All” with the late, Magic is a title than can describe then up until now. It’s relatable. AllHipHop.com: Most will remember you from your days with No Limit, but I go back to the Big Boy Records days with, Mystikal, The Ghetto Twiinz, Black Menace, Partners N Crime and that was a hell of a lineup as well. You have always been able to hold your own lyrically while being a part of some great lineups; whether with Big Boy or No Limit. Fiend: Right! I think iron sharpens iron and steel sharpens steel. I think the creative ancestors were just with me the whole time. At one point and time, it was like, “Son, I want you to be great and by all means you’re going to have to get there. You’re going to be able to predict the time it takes to get there, but I had to continue pushing.” I had a passion that ran so deeply I never monitored the time. I was just doing what I was doing. I firmly believe that, when you tap into something, this super power that I feel like everybody from Louisiana possess, I think it attracts that other type of light. That other type of great energy for whatever attribute you need to help push you to the next level. AllHipHop.com: Most, if not all of No Limits albums started with the all-star cast spitting a verse for the intro of the album. With the talent there, you, Mia X, Mystikal once again, Silkk The Shocker, P, C-Murder, Mac, how did you guys keep the egos in check and the jealousy down? Fiend: How do you keep the egos down when you have all of these great artists and everyone wants their turn and their look? We genuinely all cared for each other. Outside of music we were pretty much familiar with each other. That played a very very big part. Of course, there were times where you wanted to be promoted more or get more exposure or pay and things like that; not so much compared to anyone else, but to grow as an artist. I can’t speak for everybody, but I will say it really helps when everyone has a genuine type of love for each other. I think that made it that much more easy for us all to stand and cross over that bridge together as far as all of these artists chasing their dream and pursuing their dream. I believe that everyone gets their turn depending on the type of work they put in when it’s your turn. AllHipHop.com: When you have 10 artists on one track, was there a process to the order in which you appeared on that intro? Take for instance, ‘Make Em Say Ugh,” how was that order selected? Fiend: There were times where we got together and it was like, “This-this-this and this.” But, most of the time we just was gelling. That just was that. AllHipHop.com: Do you remember the first time you met, Master P? Fiend: Believe it or not, I saw him… my buddy Damian had took me to a concert at the Riverboat Hallelujah. Funny- funny- funny, P was in there selling their music and performing. I was like, “That’s dope!” My buddy, Damian liked this, Master P dude. I didn’t get into the music like that. I couldn’t recall so many songs and this that or the other. Damian was my dawg, so I was just going with him. I knew Mia. I go to it like any other concert. We get up in that thang, you know what I’m saying. And, I’m like, ‘This is cool. This is who Mia with right now.” I go to support and buy a CD or cassette, I bought it from, Percy Miller. He was behind the table selling his stuff. He got these high socks up to his knees and I’m like, “This dude must be from somewhere else.” I wasn’t dissing him or nothing I just thought the cat was from somewhere else. I didn’t know he was from home, ya heard me. I bought his stuff I bought Mia stuff. I’m just supporting because I think this is dope. These people out here selling their own music; this is the era I’m from. That’s when I first met him. He probably don’t even remember that. My buddy, Damian was trippin that I ended up getting with people who he had been supporting since “99 Ways To Die,” you know what I mean? AllHipHop.com: That’s crazy. Okay, that was your first time meeting, Master P, but how did you become a, No Limit Soldier?” Fiend: What happened was, I was working with Kane and Abel, I was working with KLC and I was working with Mia. Mia had brought me to get on one of her projects. She had wanted me and Mac on one of her projects. What we did was we ended up working that out. This guy by the name of Corey Bush, a good friend of ours was like, “I go to school with him. I’m in college with him.” He had just started going to college at SUNO. So, Corey… we fresh out of high school or still in high school like 12thgrade. He came and got me and was like, “Mia want to sit down with you and get you on something.” I’m like, “That’s dope.” So, I met Mia at like Schwegmann’s [grocery store] or something (laughing). We walking through Schwegmann’s getting her groceries. She was like, “Yeah baby, I want to get you on my album. I think you dope. I got a song I want to get you and Mac on.” And I’m like, this is cool. I’m walking through Schwegmann’s grocery shopping with Mia right now. It was so ill. It was too cool, bruh. She said she was going to get me out there to the studio. She came to my house, I guess to vibe with me or for me to run my verse to her or something. She came to my mom’s house and I remember me and Mac getting up even more so after she put us together. So that was dope, next thing you know, Kane and Abel wanted to work, and I started working with them a lot. I went out there and I was on a song with them. KL was like, “Forget that, bruh. I’m about to take you out there with me.” So, he took me and when you walk in, you walk straight and there is an office to your left and an office to your right and in the middle was a conference table. So, we were recording… well, KL was in there making beats. I’m up in there chillin with him while he’s working on songs. He got headphones on and next thing you know, P opens the door and sticks his head in. I turn around and he was real dry like, “What’s up.” I said what’s up back, and KL got headphones on, so I tell him, “Ya man saying what’s up.” So, KL say what’s up and P was like, “Say KL, let me holla atcha.” He pull, KL in his office and I hear them having a disagreement. P wasn’t too keen on meeting new people in that manner. They talking amongst themselves and I hear, P like, “Man, who this dude is you bringing up in here,” and KL is like, “Man, I’m telling you, we need this dude, bruh. He wasn’t too mad on that type of level, but it caught him off guard or whatever. They were in there for a few minutes or whatever and he walked in and it got quiet again, but I remember them going in that room. KL opened the door and they walked up in there and he said, “Yeah, everything cool, bruh.” He went back to making beats. I remember him bringing me up there every chance he could get. It was never like, “Hey KL, can you bring me up there.” It was always him, “Say bruh, I think you need to be over here.” Mia, Kane and Abel and KL, made it official for me to go around. I never stopped going in. I used to get up with KL in his blue Suburban. His Dallas Cowboys blue Suburban, he was a die-hard Dallas Cowboys fan ya heard me. I don’t know how, but that’s his thing. We used to drive out there, bruh and it used to be like magic. I was there to see him produce “Watcha Think.” I was there for all of these situations. I was there for the finishing of the “Bout It Bout It” soundtrack. It was just sick, man to know how dirty and grimy you can make music to represent the picture of our culture. It just threw me, bruh. “I gotta get a meal ticket.” I got to see that first hand, bruh. That’s the process that I didn’t mind waiting for when it came to time. That was the process because in between those times of waiting for whatever, I was able to record me an album, “There’s One In Every Family,” piece by piece by piece. AllHipHop.com: I think your debut cut, was one of the most arrogant debut singles ever and we loved it; “I’m The Baddest Motherfucker Alive!” Fiend: Bruh… now that you say that, I never looked at it like… those words. I never looked at it like, “Me, yeah, me, I’m the baddest.” It was just a phrase that was stuck in my head. I promise you, it was just a vibe and I’m happy I stuck to it and I’m happy DJ Precise didn’t hinder me because of the track. I’m happy that the people was around to say, “Let’s make this happen.” I didn’t hinder myself. I just kept pushing. I didn’t hear the naysayers. I couldn’t hear nobody, but the sounds of me wanting to murder a track. That song happened on “Big Boy Records” and you can say the rest is history. I had a lot of ups and downs, but in the city, that one song… it was no looking back, bruh. At the end of the day, bruh, I wanted to represent us so bad. I was going to be whatever I was going to be and I had it on my mind not to care about the judgement and just go. I had so much on my mind. I wish I could tell you I had this perfect blueprint, but I didn’t. All I knew was to work. Do the work, do the work, do the work. I never left the studio. That’s why I was on so much stuff. I’m just grateful. If my career was over with tomorrow or whatever the case may be I could be grateful knowing that I accomplished a lot of dope things, reached a lot of dope fans, met a lot of great new people, traveled the world and left an imprint. AllHipHop.com: I’m sure the opportunity to work with Snoop Dogg when he was signed to No Limit ranks high up there as well. Fiend: It was dope. Snoop is just an all-around dude and I am grateful for somebody like him. Not only being a fan at one time and growing to be friends, but I was able to see what it was like to have Love and Hip Hop before there was Love and Hip Hop. AllHipHop.com: When you see, C-Murder go do a bid, Mac, go do a bid, the unfortunate passing of, Mr. Magic, and you’re still here, you’re still doing what you love, one of the last Mohicans, so to speak. What is that feeling like? Fiend: You don’t know when it’s going to be your number. I’ve seen some real close friends pass away and you just scratch your head. I’ve been able to avoid a lot of things. Maybe I had a different right of passage something bigger for me to do. I don’t look at my life more greater than theirs, I just look at it like, I’ve been preserved and it was on me to do something with it. I got low for a minute from a lot of things just being paranoid. People following you, special agents following you trying to take you down because of your success and your color. I don’t know why it was the agenda to focus on us like that, but it’s just real, man. Of course a lot of people are going to get it in my book and my documentary. It wasn’t an easy path. I never thought I would be here to be talking about, I’m still here. You get past 25 and you doing big business. That’s just really what it is. I’m just more in shock. I never thought I would be the dude saying, “Back in my day.” To still be in the heart of what’s poppin and the movement, ya know… I’m grateful. AllHipHop.com: It was a pleasure speaking with you and I wish you continued success moving forward. Is there anything else to add before I let you go? Fiend: I appreciate your time, Mr. Crawford. I really appreciate your time. I want to be able to utilize the company and the outlet that you are working for more often. I would like to go about it using the correct procedure, so that I could be more consistent. I know that there are no promises behind it, but I have a lot of music and a lot of vibes and I want to be able to put it out there. I’m appreciative for all blogs and websites who show me support and follow me on social media. I think it helps to have great young writers that know the story and know how to get great stories out. If people can tune-in to me and follow me on Instagram @504fiend, Twitter @FIEND4DAMONEY, Facebook is 504Fiend or Richard Jones and Snap Chat is Fiend Whomp Whomp.

127,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/free-speech-10-of-eminem-s-most-political-moments-LjxQjV6NDkeuSXNtbMpl6Q/,"(AllHipHop Features) At this point, unless they’ve been living under a rock, everyone has seen the recent cipher from the BET awards where Eminem ethers 45. And while Eminem hasn’t always been the most political of rappers, the 4 and a half minute video of him in a Detroit parking structure is far from the first time Em has touched on social issues or serious current events. Yes, in additional to being a master emcee and wordsmith, his ascent can largely be traced to his unique ability to make hardcore rap funny via his Slim Shady persona. However, Eminem’s 21 year career (and counting) is no joking matter and one of the ways he has remained as relevant as long as he has is his ability to speak up for those without a voice. Whether getting back at bullies like on “Brain Damage” or criticizing the Commander-in-Chief for an unjust war like on “Mosh,” the Detroit rapper has always been willing to fight the good fight and that is very admirable. Em’s BET freestyle solidified that he will be remembered on the correct side of history when Trump’s presidency is analyzed in the future. And so in honor of that and, as AllHipHop.com’s co-founder Chuck Creekmur said on MSNBC recently, “[Eminem is] using his privilege for good on one of the biggest platforms in a Hip-Hop space to get [his] message across,” AllHipHop has made a chronological list of ten other times Eminem has addressed politics in one way, shape, or form. Respect due. “Without Me”: For the lead single off The Eminem Show, “Without Me,” one of the many characters Eminem dressed up in its corresponding video was Osama Bin Laden. In spring 2002, rumors began to circulate that this didn’t sit well with supporters of the Al Qaeda terrorist organization and they had allegedly threatened his life. These rumors were later proven to be totally false. “White America”: In one of the most powerful tracks in his iconic catalogue, “White America,” Eminem acknowledged the role that race played in his ground-breaking success as an emcee. “Let’s do the math / If I was black, I woulda sold half / I ain’t have to graduate from Lincoln High School to know that.” “We As Americans”: On this song, which first appeared on the Straight from the Lab bootleg and was then released on the bonus disc of Encore, Em spit, “It’s funny, we got a buzz spreadin’ quicker than makin’ paper airplanes out of a twenty / F\*k money, I don’t rap for dead presidents / I’d rather see the President {dead}*.” Even with the word “dead” censored on all official releases, the Secret Service investigated the line because it was seen as a possible threat against then-President, George. W. Bush. The Shady National Convention: In the fall of 2004, when George W. Bush and John Kerry were running for president, Eminem put on a mock political convention to promote his fifth LP, Encore. The man who introduced Slim Shady prior to him approaching the podium was none other than Donald Trump. Times sure have changed. “Mosh”: While Eminem’s fourth Aftermath LP received less favorable reviews than his previous three, one of its undeniably powerful moments was the song and video for “Mosh.” There were even two versions of the clip’s ending. One, prior to the 2004 election, where a large group of people burst into a vote registration site, and another, after the election, where the group invades President Bush’s State of the Union Address. Eminem’s Support of Barack Obama: During a 2012 interview, Eminem came out in support of Barack Obama saying, “Obama’s great. Obama is giving people hope. Not to sound too political… He seems like he’s a great f*****g guy. He’s got a great head on his shoulders. He speaks with authority and confidence. He’s got an aura about him that’s just incredible. I’d never followed an election like [2008] like I did. He’s given us a sense of hope.” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTtxnAYDr_A&feature=youtu.be How to Make Money Selling Drugs********\:** This entertaining and educational documentary examined the flaws of the “War on Drugs” and dissected the drug business via interviews with notable and successful dealers like “Freeway” Rick Ross and Bobby Carlton as well as high-profile celebrities and activists such as Russell Simmons, Susan Sarandon, Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson, and, of course, Marshall “Eminem” Mathers. “Campaign Speech”: Fittingly released on the day of the third debate between then-presidential-candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, Em’s “Campaign Speech” freestyle was a nearly eight-minute song that name-dropped celebrities, but also, and more importantly, commented on the current social and political climate. “I’m givin’ Daniel Pantaleo a refresher course on excessive force and pressure points / And dressin’ George Zimmerman in fluorescent orange / Dress and four inch heels to address the court / With a bullseye on his back, his whole chest and torso / And left on the doorsteps of Trayvon’s dad as a present for him.” “No Favors”: Earlier this year, Eminem collaborated with fellow Detroit emcee Big Sean on the record, “No Favors” and, in addition to taking shots at President Trump, he took the opportunity to diss right-wing pundit Ann Coulter and dedicated it to Sandra Bland and Philando Castile. “That’s for Sandra Bland, h\* / And Philando*.” “F**k Trump” Chant: Just this past August, at London’s Reading and Leeds Festival to a crowd of approximately 90,000 people, Eminem briefly spoke to the audience between songs saying, “I’m not about to stand up here and use this f****n’ stage for some kind of a platform to be all political and s**t ... but this motherf****r Donald Trump I can’t stand.” He then proceeded to go, “When I say, ‘F**k,’ you say, ‘Trump.’ The audience was more than happy to oblige. https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=687&v=rkUyxFy4Pqk ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912203326.34/warc/CC-MAIN-20190324043400-20190324065400-00059.warc.gz
128,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/freeway-rick-ross-artist-nakuu-knows-how-to-make-it-with-persistence-teamwork-wobqAkw5GkyG-jDarITIuw/,"Nakuu has the look and the sound to be a star in the music industry and the York, Pennsylvania native is just getting started. By Percy Crawford (@MrLouis1ana) With the emergence of R&B songs being harmonized over Hip-Hop beats, budding artists, Nakuu shows his range in that realm on his latest single “Give It To You,” where he opens in falsetto followed by lyrical harmonizing. The same can be heard in his song, “People Really Change.” He also shows a wide range in, “Depression,” where he attacks suicidal thoughts and the potential of the afterlife being more suitable than being on earth. Nakuu, is signed to street legend turned inspirational speaker/businessman, Freeway Rick Ross who discovered him through super manager, Haze. Although, Nakuu is a late 90’s baby, he already has 10-years in the game and with his all gas, no brakes approach, there are no signs of slowing down anytime soon. I had the chance to speak with, Nakuu about the power of the internet, his music not sounding like everyone else’s and the advantages of having Freeway Rick Ross in his corner. AllHipHop: You come from a musical background. Both of your parents were heavily involved in music. I’m sure that has helped you along the way. Nakuu: Coming from a musical background helps me a lot because I have been around it so much. You do what you learn you know what I mean. So, growing up, my dad started the S.O.S. Band. They were originally from Atlanta. Growing up, I got used to watching them practice and see what they used to wear and things like that. They used to wear different clothes to make themselves look flashy. I remember watching them get ready for shows. Plus, my mom was singing too. She was part of the band too before she had me. She still does her thing too. Growing up in a musical family just as its own effect on me and it’s a big influence. AllHipHop: You have had an in-home studio since the 9th grade. How does a 13-14-year-old kid acquire an in-home studio at such a young age? Nakuu: That’s when I started taking music more seriously. It all started because I went to somebody else’s studio and I was a young bol, so when I went there, they charged me like $100. I was a young bol, so I was like, “I ain’t gonna be doing that all the time.” So, I found a way to get my own computer and somebody put the programs on my computer and I basically learned from trial and error. It took me awhile to get it done, but that’s how it really started.  AllHipHop: You really used the internet to build your brand and let your voice be heard. Nakuu: With the internet, you can reach all types of people. I make a lot of music that’s relatable. They see my music as something for relationships and stuff like that because I’m always singing about relationship stuff. My music comes from real life experiences. I go through stuff just like a lot of people go through stuff, so I make those situations into music, so it relates to a lot of people. I guess it just happened from people spreading the word and sharing it. The internet is a powerful tool if you know how to use it right. It just all worked out in a positive way for me. AllHipHop: The internet also provides an immediate reaction in terms of what fans like and dislike based on likes and shares and I’m sure that helps with the type of content you choose to put out based on the fans reaction. Nakuu: Yeah! Especially because you hear what a lot of other people hear because the internet is powerful, so that has an influence on what kind of music you make as well. It all comes down to the same things. AllHipHop: You said you make music based on personal experiences; I have to ask about your song, “Depression,” because it seems very personal. Is that something you went through or just you speaking on what a lot of people can relate to these days? Nakuu:  I have a friend that… that whole situation that happened in that song, it based on him. I basically put his life into a song. He gave me his full consent to do that, so I ran with it. I felt it was a good idea because I know a lot of people that go through depression. I even went through depression one time, so I know how it feels to be depressed. There are times when people go through certain situations in their life and it always helps to have that kind of music out to motivate them. I would go through the comments of that video and it got deep to a point where people would say, it helped them and prevented them from committing suicide. I was like, “Dang, that’s real powerful.” For them to say something like that, I’m just glad I could help. AllHipHop: You seem to be very versatile in the sense that you’re not only a vocalist, but you also play piano and you’re mixing and things like that. How key is your versatility in terms of the direction you are heading? Nakuu: As a musician, I want to explore a lot of different things. I want to learn more instruments, mixing, and mastering. I have been playing the piano since I was little. I learned by my ear. I didn’t really have a teacher. I still learn to this day. Every time I see a piano, I go up to it and get on it and stuff like that. I learned quick too. In the future, I want to add more musical instruments to my performances. You may see me with a band soon. AllHipHop: Your man, Haze put you on to Freeway Rick Ross and now he’s guiding your career. What is that like for you to have him in your corner and have that backing? Nakuu: It’s real amazing. It’s a blessing. Coming up, you never know who is real and fake in this game. People will say they can do a lot of stuff, but when it comes down to it they can’t do what they say. They don’t have the connections and stuff like that. I been through a situation where people tried to stir me in the direction they thought was good and it really was the wrong direction. So, to have somebody with me and it’s even better because he knows my people and my family knows his family. It’s more of a trust thing. It feels more right than it does wrong and that’s always a good thing. AllHipHop: You’re a youngster, did you know of Freeway Rick Ross prior to meeting him?  ​ Nakuu: To be honest, I heard of the “The Real” Ross, but I also heard of the rapper, Rick Ross. I was born in the late 90’s, so growing up we heard that, I think I’m Big Meech,” and stuff like that. The rapper Rick Ross was there. You never knew… a lot of people in our generation didn’t know about the real Rick Ross. That’s crazy because people gotta know where this stuff comes from. For me, I found out late, but I know now and… the real Rick Ross is not a rapper (laughing). AllHipHop: Your latest song, “Give It To You.” I love the track, I was trying to think of who you sound like and I couldn’t come up with anyone. That’s the highest compliment these days with so much of the music pattern sounding alike. I’m sure the goal is to not blend in and set yourself apart from the pack. Nakuu: Definitely! Growing up, you listen to a lot of artist and I know a lot of people sound the same in this generation because they are influenced by a lot of the same people. As a true artist, it’s okay to be influenced by people sound and stuff, but you got to learn to make your own out of that sound. I have been making music for a long time; 2019 is my 10th year making music. I’m molding my sound and I’m creating my own sound which is unique, so it’s good to know that people say I have my own sound. I appreciate that. AllHipHop: Is there anything that you have coming up in the near future that you want to touch on before I let you go? Nakuu: I got a big project coming out and we got some major producers that’s going to be on that. It’s going to come out this year. Like you said, I got this song, “Give It To You,” that is out on all platforms, so everybody go check that out. We got a lot of things coming this year. Just tell the world to get ready!

The young rapper from Chicago has emerged on the Hip-Hop scene as one of the best artists to hit the scene. However, Herb has continually worked on his craft even without an album on the market (several projects though). And now, he’s finally ready to present his debut after years of mangling mics, impacting social media and YouTube views as well. Humble Beast is a rock solid collection of work that only adds to the legacy that the rapper has already amassed. In this exclusive interview, the Chicago emcee talks to Miss Lissa, whose inquisitive demeanor throws a myriad of questions at Herbo. Is Chance The Rapper, his fellow emcee from Chicago, an industry plant? Who does he have a crush on? Who does he want to meet and learn from (hint: Jay-Z)? What has he taken from the Chi-Town greats like Kanye West, Twista and Common? Furthermore, he reveals the artist he met that caused him to pause at the immensity of all that he has accomplished. Check out this insightful conversation between Miss Lissa and an artist rapidly blossoming into greatness. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbpRUnsjZ48&feature=youtu.be Listen to Humble Beast in full. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFAWgF1Ik1Va3T1bfUFfcgMC32-PzbXUq ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202640.37/warc/CC-MAIN-20190322074800-20190322100800-00324.warc.gz

Khan's less than rock solid chin has been a factor in past fights, and the move up in weight for Khan should be another advantage for Canelo. Considering these factors, Khan was likely the better bet on paper when compared to the unknown threat that Golovkin's vaunted KO abilities pose that have yet to be tested against cream of the crop bankable A list opponents like Canelo, Miguel Cotto or the recently retired Floyd Mayweather (49-0, 26KOs). So once again, Golovkin is left a bit out in the cold, fighting someone who is undefeated but still less than substantive when it comes to that highly definable real deal versus real deal fight fever that turns it's participants into undisputedly iconic material.  Rather than bemoan their situation too much, team Gennady, while pointing out that Wade is their mandatory to keep a hold of GGG's impressive coterie of belts, namely the WBA Super World Middleweight Title, the IBF World Middleweight Title, the interim WBC World Middleweight Title and the International Boxing Organization World Middleweight Title, chose to see the irony of the situation by drawing similarities between Wade now and Gennady Golovkin in 2011 when he got the career boost of fighting Kassim Ouma (28-9-1, 17KOs) for the WBA World Middelweight title : ""Dominic is in the same place where Gennady was five, six years ago,"" said Golovkin's longtime K2 promoter, Tom Loeffler, adding, ""If he had the opportunity to fight one of the top fighters and show that he was the best in the division, that's all that he was hoping for.""  Hopefully Dominic does prove to be worthy or at least competitive against Golovkin, as this is rhetoric that we have heard from team GGG before - specifically when it came to GGG's fight against the then undefeated Willie Monroe Jr. (19-2, 6KOs), which also took place at The Forum. However, if tomorrow night does prove to be another unmitigated blow out for Golovkin, at the very least it should be another hole in any argument that the winner of Canelo vs. Khan would attempt to cobble together in order to further delay the ""Good Boy"" from Kazakhstan finally participating in his true big drama show.

132,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/get-ready-for-chariah-and-riah-nation-1Qn5Y9TKrkC0WhGjzySfzw/,"Beyonce has her Beyhive, and Chariah has her Riah Nation. Trade Houston for Chicago, and Riahhfbaby is ready to debut herself as a recording artist, specifically bringing back that old school R&B feel we all know and love. AllHipHop caught up with the 23-year-old in sunny Los Angeles to chat about her transition from battle dancing to the studio. AllHipHop: Can you talk about your battle dance days? Chariah: Ooooooh. [laughs] Well Wala Cam started back a few years ago, before there was an Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, any of that. Wala Cam was based on YouTube and every Sunday, people from all of Chicago — the West Side, South Side, East Side — would come together and battle each other. It was like, who was the best in the city? There was nothing else for people to get into, so they would click on YouTube and watch the videos. Literally, all the people from out of town would have their favorites. That just really gave me my name. AllHipHop: How good were you? Chariah: I was going hard. ‘Cause I would be the baddest in the South, I wanted the queen or princess title. I was literally dancing my ass of every Sunday, making a name for myself, and it worked. Like I said, there was no Instagram, Twitter, nothing like that, so the views used to come in so heavily. And we used to battle on TV too. It just was super dope. I didn’t know how many people watched it until recently. I was in Atlanta in Wet Willie’s and I was sitting out eating. This girl kept looking at me and I’m thinking, “What the hell are you looking at?” She goes, “Excuse me, I just really have to ask you something. Are you Riah from Wala Cam?” Mind you, it had been like 5 or 6 years. I’m like “yeah.” She said, “I live in Atlanta and I literally have been watching ya’ll since I was younger. I really loved it.” She was like “you grew up.” ‘Cause I was 14 or 15, I started dancing when I was 13. She was like, “You all gave me a lot of ammo for dancing. I was like, “Oh that’s so dope.” I didn’t know how big it was, for real, for real. That’s how I got my name first, and then it transferred to music. AllHipHop: How’d you get into music? Chariah: Because I always loved music. Since I was young, I’ve been in singing lessons and piano lessons, but dancing was my first love. Then one day I was like, “You know what, I want to sing and dance. I could combine them together. Then I just start writing music, getting in the studio and recording, and it worked. AllHipHop: At what point did you realize this music thing was for real? Chariah: When people used to send me videos singing my song. I was like, “Oh s##t, this could be something.” It kind of gave me chills to see other people vibing out to me, so I’m like, “Okay cool, I can do this.”  AllHipHop: You just released the visual for “Crushin.” Talk about the inspiration behind this record & your creative process. Chariah: The creative process had liquor involved. [laughs] A little tipsy and in the studio. Me and one of my writers were just vibing out and we came up with it. We were just like, “Oh we like this.” We were just drunk, don’t tell Manny (manager). Honestly though, it just turned out to what it was. “Crushin” is actually one of my favorites, a lot of people like that record. It’s just a vibe. It’s bringing back something new. A lot of the new girls that are coming out now, they’re rapping. Nobody is really singing no more for real, especially giving that R&B feel. I think I’m bringing something that the game is missing right now. ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912203947.59/warc/CC-MAIN-20190325112917-20190325134917-00418.warc.gz
133,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/get-to-know-singer-songwriter-levina-lye-BFuQHSYPiU2QxJ63r1zcDg/," The 22-year-old Puerto Rican/African American beauty attended Catholic school in New York when her parents uprooted from the Bronx and the tranquility of life upstate is where she nurtured her natural ability and discovered her love for poetry and music. Music gave way to an artistry that would help her get in tune with the emotions of transitioning from adolescence to womanhood grappling with loneliness, fear, hope and peace. With her upcoming EP “Pieces of Me” Levina Lye gives you the most intimate pieces of her life through her music and the feelings are paramount in every delicately maneuvered octave scaled by the vocalist. The single “Fade Away” is currently available and Levina Lye has a conversation about all the pieces of her. AllHipHop: How old were you when you started writing? Levina Lye: I actually started writing poems at 15 and when I turned 16 I was like oh shoot I can write songs. As a singer/songwriter why did you decide to start remaking cover songs to release?  Initially, I did put out original music but no one would really give me the time of day because my former management didn’t really know how to market it. My new project manager and me then sat down and said how can we make people know who I am in a way that’s familiar to them. So we decided to do covers and I started picking cover songs that pertained directly to what I was going through or feeling so that’s why they came out so passionate. They’re other peoples songs, but it’s the way I felt. What I loved about the Rihanna song was your passion and vulnerability gave it a different feel from Rihanna’s rendition of “Love the Way You Lie”. How do you develop your interpretation to make it your own?  I really focus on the lyrics. I really focus on the words they wanted portrayed because sometimes artists don’t really write for themselves so it’s harder to try to tap into that emotion. I truly understood what that artist meant so it was easier for me to just go in and say boom bam, this is mine now. This is Rihanna’s song but this is my version of it and sometimes people like the rendition better than the original. With respect to The Weeknd’s cover of “Wicked Games,” I read about how important it is to you that people live their truths and in that video, your truth is told in your performance to a female lover. What made you choose todo the video in that way?  Well I really like the song and the message of the song. I truthfully didn’t want to take anything away from what The Weeknd was saying. I thought how can I switch this in a way that I can do it because he was talking about a girl. I said let’s have a girl in the video. Let’s truly show what this song is really about because beyond all the sex appeal and all that stuff there really was a deeper message. The message is about how people use things like sex, drugs and alcohol to escape which kind of ties into my single “Fade Away”. I guess I’m just a deep thinker, everything I do there’s a message behind it if you really pay attention. There’s more than just sex, drugs and pretty girls. So when we hear your own music, who will we find out you really are?  I’m human and by that I mean I go through hurt and pain. I have my struggles. People have to sit down with me and help me understand things sometimes and all that good stuff. My music speaks a lot about who I am. My EP “Pieces of Me” will pretty much define me. Tell me about the single “Fade Away”.  “Fade Away” is about any type of escape that anyone uses. Life is hard and sometimes you do need that drink after work or that friend’s shoulder to cry on, or something else. That is what “Fade Away” is about. It’s a feel good song for whatever you do to make yourself feel better. How did you get into music at this level? I met Be N Original, my wonderful project manager, who changed my life. He’s definitely someone who has been on my team and in my corner from day one and without him my team wouldn’t be a team. To be so young you seem wise beyond your years what or whom do you attribute that?  Well, I pay attention to life. I pay attention to the things other people go through and I watch the struggle from that. There’s always room to grow from watching other people even though it’s sad, it’s still a learning experience. In the current landscape of female entertainers what do you look to contribute to the world of music?  I feel like I’m going to be one of those artists who helps bring back the true essence of music and what it means to feel. When you sit down and listen to a body of work and actually think and dwell on it and tap in to some type of emotion that hasn’t been tapped into for a while, that’s really what I want to do is be a person to inspire for the better.

Flash:    But as I was coming up, this became a major focal point and starting point for me. It's called 23 Park, right here on 166th Street and Tinton Avenue, which was really important to me and where I used to play, it's this placed called the Parky House right there. Your man calls it Park and Recreations. No, it's the fucking Parky House, man. Two parks I used to play: 63 and Park, I would call it the mid-size park, and at 23 Park, which is probably the major place. I used to ask permission to run an extension cord out of the door of the Parky House, and we used to set up right here. Chuck Creekmur:    Okay. Flash:    And we used to play. So this was kind of my area for trying new music, like ... And you gotta understand, hip hop at that time was based on what the DJ was playing, and he who was the holder of the hottest break was the man at the time. So sometimes it was Herc, and sometimes it was Bam, and sometimes it was Flash. So, when I had Bob James ""Take Me to the Mardi Gras,"" I was the man. When Herc had ""Apache,"" he was the man. And when Bam had ""Trans-Europe Express"" and ""Indiscreet"" and all these things, it was like he was the man. This thing called the Bronx, man, is where it all started. Chuck Creekmur:    What would you say your experience was like? Paint the picture for us. How many people were out here with you? 500, 200, 20? Flash:    I'd say somewhere around 1,000 people was here. G. We had some of the most dopest break dancers. We had some of the most incredible people that did that dance called ""The Hustle."" You know? We had the most amazing graffiti artists because you got to understand, during this time period, talking to the beat of music did not exist yet. Not yet. I hadn't perfected the quick mix theory yet. Chuck Creekmur:    Yeah. Flash:    Where the body of music was a bed for a human being to speak on. I was still in the perfecting aspect of it during this period of time. For me, this was a testing ground for a pop break, a rock break, a jazz break, a blues break, a funk break, an R&B break, a disco break, an alternative break, a Caribbean break. This was testing period.  Chuck Creekmur:    Right. Flash:    While the Godfather was smashing it on the West Side of the Bronx, little Flash was over her doing a little something with my little wack ass system. You know, so pretty much. Chuck Creekmur:    In August (2017) Google paid homage to what was largely considered to be the birthdate of hip hop.  Flash:    Right. Chuck Creekmur:    You responded in your way. Flash:    Sure. Chuck Creekmur:    With your open letter to Kool Herc. Flash:    Yes. Chuck Creekmur:    I had a lot of questions before your open letter, and I have questions after your open letter. Flash:    Sure. Chuck Creekmur:    So, let's talk about the open letter. What prompted you to do that? Flash:    I think what happened was when I was asked to be a part of it, I applauded the fact that finally this platform as huge as Google wants to take this era and time that a lot of people don't know about, and they're going to send it out to billions of people.  Chuck Creekmur:    Right. Flash:    I was really wonderful about that. But what I wanted to make really clear is there's technical aspect, and there's advance in time and places, people, and things that need to be addressed during that period of time ... Chuck Creekmur:    Right. Flash:    That I really wanted to address, and I wanted to make it clearer how things took place, and how it was done. Chuck Creekmur:    Right. Flash:    I come from a place where I'm always respectful. There's Grandmaster Flash the performer, but then there's Joseph Saddler, the scientist. I wanted to make it absolutely clear that we need to make it clear how this thing broke down from a microscopic perspective, where a lot of times things are done in just a huge, brilliant picture, and it's like, ""Whoa. Wow."" Chuck Creekmur:    Right. Flash:    But then that tiny part of the painting right there wasn't looked at. Chuck Creekmur:    Right. Flash:    So, if we're going to look at it from a painting's perspective, we need to know what the reds represent, and what the blues represent, and what the turquoises represent, and what the yellows represent, so I was more or less going into the colors they're depicting. Okay, this yellow is why this blue came into it that made it green. Chuck Creekmur:    Right. Flash:    Because yellow and blue make green. Where the yellows were big during this announcement, and the blues were big during this background announcement. Nobody said, ""Okay, so green."" Green wasn't depicted. So, I had to express that there was someone thinking about this, and these yellows and these blues were experimented on, and they made green. Chuck Creekmur:    Okay. Flash:    So, when you're looking at green, let's look at yellow and blue. Oh ... I look at Herc as an individual who took bastard music, music that main media didn't care for, and brought that to the forefront. I look at Bam has having the most, deepest collection than the two of us together of this bastard music that the world didn't want. I look at myself as coming up with a delivery system, how to deliver it. This is where I'm talking about the different colors that needed to be depicted. That's where Joseph Saddler comes in.  When I talk about Einstein, and the Theory of Relativity is when I'm watching heads on the floor, I am absolutely making sure that what I'm playing, while the female and males heads is going up down, whether I'm playing pop or rock, as I go to the next song the heads are still going up and down. Then I talked about Benjamin Banneker. When I want you to stop because he is the inventor of the traffic light. Chuck Creekmur:    Right. Flash:    When I want you to stop, I want you to stop at the same time. This is where my area is, where Herc was more or less into the major crowds, but I called the Law of Disarray, where things are not totally in line. Chuck Creekmur:    Right. Flash:    Not making it no more, or no less than what I did, but just basically microscopically managing how the music was distributed to the heads in front of us. Chuck Creekmur:    Right.  Flash:    Who's playing the major role? But at the same time, we played this music that mainstream America didn't give a fuck about. Herc did it first. We took breaks from pop, rock, jazz, blues, funk, disco, R&B, alternative, Caribbean, and once we found that piece, and I figured out a way to connect this according to the Theory of Relativity, which is matching it. This is hip hop for me. Chuck Creekmur:    Yeah. Flash:    You understand what I'm saying? And when I wanted you to stop is when I'm using Benjamin Banneker. This is how Joseph Saddler thinks.  I think like Erik von Braun, with the creator of the jet engine. The jet engine hasn't changed in 40 plus years. When you look at a plane, and I'm on planes all the time, it's still a gigantic fan that sucks in air, and the air that blows out the other end propels the engine. The Quick Mix Theory hasn't changed in almost 40 years. It's bigger, it's faster, and then some kids do it in a way that I woudn't fathom knowing how to do, but it's the same way. So, this is how Joseph Saddler thinks. 2017 is what I call the cyclical year of the birth of hip hop. It's because 2017 there are more young people, more kids that want to know what the 70s was doing than ever. So, we were talking about the 80s, and how they get credit, it's just that the 80s was the cake finished. The 70s was the bakers at the time. So, now the 70s for me is so, ""How was the cake made?"" It's the flour, the water, the eggs, the vanilla, the secret ingredients. Now, with the interest of the 70s, it's really important that we as hip hoppers ... Chuck Creekmur:    Yeah. Flash:    Whether here in the Bronx right now, or in Japan, or in Australia, like people need to know where this thing truly started. You need to know Kool Herc is, you need to know who Afrika Bambaataa is, you need to know who Grandmaster Flash is, and all out prodigies that come after. It's really important. Chuck Creekmur:    Absolutely. You made the distinction between looping versus repeating.  And that's a major distinction for people that know hip hop. Flash:    I'm not trying to school the scholars like you. I'm trying to microscopically school the layman's that might look at that and say, ""I don't see the difference."" So, if we were to quantify the professionals like yourself and myself, let's just say they're 30,000. There's seven billion laymen. These are the people I need you to say, ""Look at these moving pictures and tell me if you see the difference."" This is how we can tell the difference between ""Bounce, Rock, Skate, Roll"" by Vaughan Mason and Good Times. You put the two together, the notes are playing exactly, almost the same, but it's two different records. . You play ""Mary Jane"" by Rick James, and then you play ""Keep Risin' to the Top"" by Keni Burke, they sound almost the same, but they come from the minds of two different people. Chuck Creekmur:    Right. Flash:    These are the laymen that you really got to be careful because long after god takes me, I want these little kids to understand where this important thing came from. These three people.  Chuck Creekmur:    Okay. Now, in the video, another little distinction you said, and this is not to focus on anything traumatic. Flash:    Right, right. Chuck Creekmur:    But you did say it, ""There's only two of us left."" Flash:    Right. Chuck Creekmur:    You know what I'm talking about? Flash:    Yeah. Chuck Creekmur:    What made you say that? Flash:    You know, as human beings we make mistakes. I'm getting a little teary eyed right now, and we do things that are not really right when it comes to people. Bam is accused of doing some things that are really horrific. Extremely horrific ... I feel for the families that it happened to. I really, really, really, really, really feel for the families that this happened to, but he is one of the people that's responsible for this. Like this is why I said ... Me and Herc, yo man, we don't speak too much anymore. As a matter of fact, we don't speak at all, and it's sad. It's because we should be speaking. When I talk to journalists, I will always give them one/third the story. Because I haven't been sitting down and had a coffee with Herc. In decades! Chuck Creekmur:    Right. Flash:    Haven't sat down with Bam and talked over a coffee or a tea.  Chuck Creekmur:    Right.  Flash:    In decades.  Chuck Creekmur:    Right.  Flash:    I so badly want to do that. When journalists ask me, how does this work? Or how does that, that, that? I'd rather give three/thirds, which equals a whole for every journalist that I speak to. I can only give my history. Chuck Creekmur:    Yeah. Flash:    The other two parts is his story. Chuck Creekmur:    Yeah. Right. Flash:    So, it makes it still to some degree incomplete. So, a horrific thing happened, so I say to Herc, it's only two of us now, and I haven't seen Bam in a long period of time.  Chuck Creekmur:    Yeah. Flash:    But bad things that took place are really horrific bad things, but ... He is a third of the story.  Chuck Creekmur:    But you still said, ""Two left."" Flash:    It's two left with just me and Herc. Chuck Creekmur:    Yeah. Flash:    I'd love to be sitting down at a table ... Chuck Creekmur:    Yeah, yeah. Flash:    Like this. Chuck Creekmur:    Right. Flash:    And saying, ""Herc, tell me who you are. Introduce yourself to me."" Because now this story, this period of time is so intensely interesting to so many people in the world. Chuck Creekmur:    Absolutely. Flash:    So, now I want to know, ""I'll tell you who Joseph Saddler is, you tell me who Clive Campbell is."" Chuck Creekmur:    Right. Flash:    Then let's go into how we became who we are. Chuck Creekmur:    Right. Flash:    When I was doing this, I was just in this for the moment. There was no plan like, ""Yo, this technical thing that you're going to do, and it's going to become the thing that every DJ does."" I wasn't thinking that way. Chuck Creekmur:    Yeah. Flash:    I heard music a certain way, and I'm like, ""It's not taking place, let me use Joseph Saddler, the geek, to figure this out."" This is all that I can say. Chuck Creekmur:    Yeah, but why aren't you and Herc talking? I mean, there's no beef, right? I mean, there's no ... Flash:    I don't know. I don't know why we're not talking. I don't know. It's sad. Chuck Creekmur:    Yeah. Flash:    Because sooner or later god will come calling. Chuck Creekmur:    Yeah. Flash:    Then it will be one. Then god will come calling again, then it will be none. The way that a lot of media does today, yesterday's not important.  Chuck Creekmur:    Right. Flash:    They move onto the next thing. Chuck Creekmur:    Absolutely.  Flash:    So, I think for me, I looked at a lot of documentaries in this past year-and-a-half, and they can not be complete because you're not hearing it from here, from Joseph Saddler. Chuck Creekmur:    Right. Flash:    If Joseph Saddler, and Clive Campbell, and Bam, whose real name I don't really, really know, was sitting here talking then you would hear an authentically, incredible, powerful, powerful, powerful, accurate story from the three people that physically did it. Until that point happens, all the documentaries will be inaccurate in one way or another. Chuck Creekmur:    I would love to sit down with Kool Herc, but it's been difficult. Flash:    Okay. Chuck Creekmur:    It's been a challenge. Flash:    Maybe before I leave planet Earth, this can happen.  So, if there's ... Like there's this slang term they use now, ""The Big Three."" Chuck Creekmur:    Yeah, yeah, yeah. For basketball. Flash:    LeBron, and the people with the Golden State Warriors. Then there was Boston. If that's the case, what does that make us? Chuck Creekmur:    The Big Three. Let me ask you this, are people jealous of Grandmaster Flash? I'll just tell you my opinion is, I think they are. Flash:    What do you mean? Chuck Creekmur:    Okay, you want me to tell you what I know? Flash:    Yeah. Chuck Creekmur:    I know that a lot of us see you, you're on tour all year, you're in control of your brand, you have multi layers to your success and your career right at this point, and then honestly a lot of others are not in as such a good position.  Flash:    Right. Chuck Creekmur:    Ultimately, that breeds envy. You've never felt that at all? Flash:    Like I told you earlier in the interview, it's critically important that I go around the world and tell these people where this thing comes from. Now since I'm only one person, and I can only be in one place in one time, a lot of times people don't see me, but when I find out about certain events, I make it a point to go to them. When I walk into a room and I see some of my old friends, it's powerful love. Chuck Creekmur:    Right, okay. Flash:    It powerful, powerful love. Like I just came from doing an event that was in honor of DJs that passed away in the Bronx area, at Sal's. Sal who used to own Disco Fever has a club called Club Evil. I was just there.  Chuck Creekmur:    Yeah. Flash:    Got all the love. It's incredibly ... It was incredible. This is what I say, I personally feel whether you are in music, machinery, medicine, or whatever it is that you do, it is your own personal responsibility to be up on the times, and make yourself visible to people because it's all a people business. Chuck Creekmur:    Yes.  Flash:    It's extremely important. I've had some real rough times. Chuck Creekmur:    Yes. Flash:    I've been fucked over. I've had some people that were near and dear to me that I raised fuck me over. I was on the ground at the lowest of my low. I went through a period of time where I was sniffing cocaine, smoking it, drinking, walked away from my turntables, almost lost my life, not once, but twice because of the overdose of cocaine. I've been through some real fucked up times. I watched my mother, my father, and my grandmother all die at the same time, in the same month. Chuck Creekmur:    Wow.  Flash:    As I passed out this particular time from cocaine, I went into somewhat of a coma like. I had this intense conversation with god, and I begged if you could allow me to wake up one more time with the fucking over that I had, if you just allow me to wake up this one time, I will drop cocaine, I will forgive the people and the fellas that used to roll with me for fucking me over, and allow me to rebuild my career. The first person he got me with, and this was an 18 year walk, the first person they got me with was  Blue who started doing bookings for me. Chuck Creekmur:    Okay. Flash:    There was this other person by the name of Greg Cannon. Greg Cannon was this white guy who done this interesting thing for a job. He says, ""Flash, although there are these confusion on whose Grandmaster, and whose not, I'm going to introduce you to this new thing that's happening, but here's the key, you have to tell people what you're thinking. You have to tell people how you're feeling. You almost got to tell people what kind of cereal you ate this morning. You got to kind of ask people when you stubbed your toe."" Chuck Creekmur:    Right. Flash:    I'm like, ""F*ck you, Greg. I'm not doing it. I'm a real private person."" Chuck Creekmur:    Right. Flash:    ""I'm not telling people sh*t."" He said, ""Flash, if you do this they will know the difference of Joseph Saddler/Grandmaster Flash, and the people that used to roll with you."" Chuck Creekmur:    Right. Flash:    ""You will now become your own person."" I'm like, ""Greg, fuck you. I'm not doing it."" He says, ""Flash, please."" Eventually he wore me down. He did this work for the Army, and this place where they used to sell electronics downtown called J&R Music World. Flash:    He said, ""It's called the internet."" I says, ""It's what?"" He says, ""Flash, just listen to me before you curse me out again."" He says, ""There's these places where you could put sentences on how you're feeling today, and what you're dealing, and I'm going to build this virtual house for you called a website."" I'm like, ""What?"" Chuck Creekmur:    Right. Flash:    ""A what?"" He says, ""In this house, there's going to be pictures of you, and things, and stories, and this and that, that, that, and I promise you if you feed this house ... "" Chuck Creekmur:    Right. Flash:    ""And you feed this thing called the internet, people will find out who Joseph Saddler is."" Chuck Creekmur:    Yeah. Flash:    To this day, I kiss the ground that he walks on. Because when I was flat on my face and coked out of my mind, and lost everything that I loved, I had to figure out how I was going to do this.  Chuck Creekmur:    Yeah. Flash:    So, my sister, Penny, and Greg Cannon, and a woman I tell you that I loved that lived three blocks from here. Her name was Paula Jeffrey. These three people figured out a way for me to get up, and I'm getting a little teary eyed right now, and do what you did before these people joined you. ""People will accept you."" Chuck Creekmur:    Right. Flash:    ""But you have to keep feeding the machine. You got to keep putting things in this place called a website. You have to start putting these things, verbiage of what you did today. You trip and you was on the swings today, and you fell off them."" Chuck Creekmur:    Yeah. Flash:    ""A fly flew in your mouth, and you had to spit it out. You have to tell people these things."" I'm like, ""Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay,"" and I did this for the past 18 years. I've separated myself back to the place I was when I was alone before anybody joined me, and now I do this around the planet. God is wonderful. Today I have a team, I run a business called Grandmaster Flash Enterprises, and like you said, the layers of people, I have 10 people. Two attorneys that protect my trademark.  I have an online specialist. I have my person, my PR, who's Melissa, who is with me today. I have technicians that are in my recording studio. I also own a video studio. I have all these people around me that are connected in the way that I think that allow me to do what I do. Chuck Creekmur:    Yeah. Flash:    Because I feel in my heart that I'm still needed. Chuck Creekmur:    You are. Flash:    Where I was in some situations where people said, ""What you do don't matter."" Chuck Creekmur:    Yeah. Flash:    ""And you are not needed."" Chuck Creekmur:    Yeah. Flash:    I am doing Madison Square Garden as a DJ September 12th. Two days later, I fly to Brazil, and I'm playing in front of 20,000 people waiting for me, and I'm headlining.  Chuck Creekmur:    Right. Flash:    Me, my two turntables, mixer, and a microphone. I have to tell you, Chuck, I come from a school of people that have the same knowledge that I have, and under all the adversity that I had, god put the right people with me and said, ""I'm going to allow you to live again. Get up."" I call it the slow walk to the big tent. The reason why I call it the slow walk to the big tent is when I do these festivals, at first, they would put me in the little tent.  I'd look and I'm like, ""Who's playing in that tent?"" So, here's five years later, now I play in the big tent.  I play in the big tent. I'm playing ""Mardi Gras,"" ""Apache,"" ""Johnny the Fox,"" ""I Can't Stop,"" I'm playing breaks in the big tent in front of 20,000 people. I'm taking what I did right here, and I'm bringing it over there. Flash:    God is absolutely wonderful. Chuck Creekmur:    That's beautiful.  Flash:    For me, I disagree with you saying that people are jealous of me because I'm taking what we all collectively did, and I'm playing with the big boys. Chuck Creekmur:    Yeah. Flash:    With this little music that comes from this little town called the South Bronx.  Chuck Creekmur:    Yeah. Well, I salute you, my brother. You're a true king. Flash:    Thank you.

137,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/greg-mack-shares-more-kday-history-and-discusses-racism-in-radio-Mh1abHGk8UWbGAn0nXBNEQ/,"Tell me about the time that you first heard “Boyz N Tha Hood” by Eazy-E before you premiered it on KDAY.  I was at the Casa Camino Real and Dr. Dre came to the club and said, “Greg. I’m working with this new kid and I just did a record with him. He’s going to invest in me. I want you to hear this record and give me your thoughts.” We left the club and went to the car and popped in the cassette. We listened to it and I told him that it just might work but he needed to clean it up if he wanted it on the air. He agreed to clean it up and I agreed to try it out on the air. The kid was Eazy-E of course. That was about midnight and the next day by 2 pm, Dr. Dre had me a clean version. We played it and by nightfall it was the most requested record. People reacted to it quickly and it stayed number one for a long time.  Even when Dre did a song with me and Eazy called “Radio,” it was the same thing. He called me and told me that he needed a DJ on it, so he had me listen to the record and I asked him what he wanted me to do. He told me to just talk and pretend we were on the radio. I did my part and he told me that was it. I was like, “In the first try?” And he said, “Yeah. That’s what I wanted. You nailed it.” I left, never signed anything, never got any royalties on it (laughs). I didn’t know that “mutha” was going to be a platinum record. We were just cool like that.  When N.W.A. started fighting with each other, were you involved in any way? You were cool with all sides.  It was like you said, I was cool with everybody. I never got involved in the business side of things.  Nobody ever came to you with their problems or frustrations?  Yeah but only about this b*tch or that b*tch or lend me some money to help me pay for this abortion – but never really anything on the business side. I’m just a radio guy and people seem to forget that. The music side kind of propelled my name out there but that’s because the people that I played became stars. Salt-n-Pepa wouldn’t have hit if I didn’t play their B-Side “Push It” and the same with J.J. Fad if I didn’t play their B-Side “Supersonic.” I get all of that but that’s my DJ side. I didn’t go in to the studio and create anything. I don’t know how to make a hit. I’m just the radio guy.  So many legendary acts came to you to break their records. Aside from N.W.A. there were acts like Salt-n-Pepa, Will Smith as The Fresh Prince, J.J. Fad and so on. Digital Underground, 2Pac, Big Daddy Kane – we can go on and list about 40 to 50 names. I’ve got a story about each and every one of them too. Big Daddy Kane, people don’t know that he was so shy and quiet. I’ve got so many stories. I’m praying that God allows me to write a book one day. There’s so much behind these people than what you see. What’s funny is that it’s all good stuff. There’s really no drama. A lot of the rappers are really good people but there’s an image that they have to uphold to keep street credibility but when you get to know them, they are really good people – even Suge Knight. I knew him before the world did and he’s a really good guy. It’s the same with Jerry Heller – he’s a great person. A lot of people in the business that have been characterized as evil, are actually good people. In Hip-Hop, a lot of bullsh*t gets said and people would rather believe the bullsh*t than hear the real story. I remember when MC Hammer and 3rd Bass had their beef, I had the group come to the station to get on the air with me and Hammer (who was on the phone) and we talked about it and I was under the opinion that we squashed it all. About 6 months later I was at a convention and their DJ Richie Rich came up to me and grabbed me by the collar. He was like, “Motherf*cker you almost got us killed! You set us up!” I was like, “What the f*ck are you talking about?” Come to find out after they left the studio that day, they stopped to get gas down the hill from the radio station and somebody started shooting at them. I had heard nothing about it at the time. They were mad at me because they thought I was setting them up. That’s how quickly sh*t can get started and it just goes to show the bullsh*t that people can believe in the world of Hip-Hop. It wasn’t someone from Hammer’s camp. I know all of those guys and I really don’t think any of them would have done some bullsh*t like that. It was some listener that got caught up in the bullsh*t and thought he was helping one side.  After your time at KDAY you got involved in radio ownership.  A lot of people don’t know that MC Hammer helped me get my first station; however this was around the time that he went bankrupt. I had to bring in another investor because he never got to finish the deal. Then Eazy-E and I were going to buy a group of radio stations together with the first one being in Phoenix. Right as we were getting started, he died. After that, me and Dr. Dre were going to do it and we applied for a Fresno, CA station – which we won. We got that station for like $500 because the FCC gave minorities preference on applications. Lo and behold, Dre and Suge start having their problems so we didn’t get to finish the deal because he would have gotten twisted up if he bought a radio station at that time. It seemed like every time I was about to get one of my guys to help me, some bullsh*t happened. In an editorial that I wrote for Billboard, I said that before I die I want to see at least one rapper own a radio station, whether it’s with me or not. I still haven’t seen that. Rock, Country and Spanish singers own radio stations but not rappers. Once one does they all will because they copy each other.  I can’t think of a better outlet for an artist to have. If you own your own station, nobody can ever deny your records being aired.  Thank you. The game is changing and radio stations are becoming cheaper to own. Once I see rappers start to own their own stations, I’ll feel like I’ve accomplished something.  KDAY was resurrected on FM dial a while back and more recently in the past few years switched to an all Old School format. What are your thoughts on that?  There are bands that go around and do Tours playing songs by The Temptations and other great artists – and those are called “tribute bands.” I tell people that KDAY is a tribute radio station. It’s a tribute to me although they will never accept that. On one hand I appreciate it and on the other I hate it. To me, they are perpetrating a fraud because KDAY was very aggressive and groundbreaking. Basically what they are trying to do is imitate what I did. I touched on this in an L.A. Times article last year and someone commented on it and said that “Greg Mack is turning in to a bitter old man.” I just want that person to know that I am not a bitter old man but if you see someone that is taking a picture that you painted and they are changing the lines and putting new paint on it, it might upset you. If you see somebody that is trying to take credit for the hours, energies, and marriages that it cost me and have no respect for you whatsoever, then it could make you bitter but I am not a bitter person. I want to see them do well. I do think that they have been very disrespectful towards me and they’ve been very disrespectful towards my Mix Masters. They need to understand that they were a whole lot of people, not just me, behind the legend of KDAY. If you’re going to live that lie, at least put some of the people that were a part of that team, whether it’s me or not, I don’t care. If I never hear from anybody there, I don’t care and it’s funny because one of the current owners (now former) is a friend of mine and we laugh about it. He lets his guys do whatever they want to do and that’s the reason why I’m not there. I look at them as a tribute station, a tribute of what I did, and that’s cool. If they ever want to keep it real, call me and we can get KDAY back cracking. We were groundbreaking. We did some things that radio just doesn’t do.  Like what?  Our street team meant something. We had artists like LL Cool J, Ice-T, Eazy-E, Dr. Dre, Run-DMC, and Tone Loc on our street teams and we would go in to a new school every single day. Ed Kirby our General Manager, made sure that we did community things like the Challenger’s Boys and Girls Club, which was struggling at the time. Jack Patterson our Program Director, I give him kudos because he allowed me to do what I wanted to do. One of the things that made us different and you don’t see nowadays is that we had an open door policy. If you had a song that you recorded in the studio last night and it was good, you could bring it to me. We didn’t have Payola. Not once did I ever accept Payola. I was accused of Party-ola, which might be true. If we’re going to play your record, then you need to go meet our listeners. We made the people that we played come out to our events because we want our people to meet these artists, which is why Hip-Hop took off because they were accessible. The Gap Band wasn’t going to go to World on Wheels but the rappers did. That’s what made us different. We actually cared.  What bothers me about radio is that they wait until someone has a huge buzz first before they will really pay attention.  There’s a lot of stuff that doesn’t get played these days and it’s sad. I’ve heard some songs and was like, “Wow! That’s a jam!” but because that artist didn’t have $300,000 to give an independent promoter, he doesn’t get heard. Whereas if I was still on the air in Los Angeles, they could have come to me and they would have been number one. Look what we did with Lisa Lisa. Her manager, the late Steve Salem, came to me with a cassette and told me that her record company wouldn’t put out her record and asked for my help. I listened to the song and it was “Take You Home.” I tried it and about a week later it became the most requested song. The record company got so many calls for it that they ended up putting it out. It’s stuff like that which doesn’t happen in radio anymore –everything has to be bought. There are stations that have “inside” independent promoters, so they are getting the money and playing the song. It’s so illegal what’s going on. You’ve got major corporations that own the venues and manage the groups.  When you look across the nation and see what you started in the radio industry, what goes through your mind?  I’ve thought about that a lot. It shows me the racism that exists in radio and let me tell you why. The white man took what I did and went to their white bosses and said, “Here’s what I’m going to do on your radio station” and just copied everything I did. It exploded and they took the credit for the idea. Never once have you heard any of those guys acknowledge where it started. Do you know why? Because I’m black. Not one of those guys can go back to August of 1983 and say that this was their idea of radio. If you look at the number of Rhythmic programmers out there, I can count on one hand the amount of Black program directors that are out there. There’s a lot of racism in today’s radio world. I’m not racist. My boss Rick here at 94.7 the Wave doesn’t have a racist bone in his body. Same with Rick Cummings over at Power 106. I had a meeting with him one time and he said, “So I guess you’re the one that started all of this?” However, I did see an article with him one time claiming that he started the Rhythmic format. I’m like, “Wait a minute!” I know if I was sitting in front of him he’ll say that he was misquoted. I have a lot of respect for him and Jimmy Steele. There are white programmers that know what they’re doing and there are a lot of new jacks that are basically just following the corporate lead and have no idea where the game started. I’m not going to hate on them but I would like for them to acknowledge that it was a Black man who did it.

138,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/happy-4-20-celebrating-the-progression-of-cannabis-and-hip-hop-culture-S3yJjawKx0-I2MWZHuj_Vg/,"Hip-hop was a subculture and art movement that developed in New York City during the late 1970s. During this time, pot smokers were already trying to advocate for cannabis after all the propaganda that had happened in the 1930s, and the Boggs Act of 1952 had just created severe mandatory sentences for a variety of drug-related offenses, including cannabis.  The ​final nail in the coffin for cannabis came when Congress passed the Controlled Substances Act of 1970. The act created individual schedules or categories that the various drugs fit into because of the potential for their abuse.  The plant was placed in the most restrictive category, Schedule I, as the government concluded that cannabis had no valid medical use and that there was potential for abuse of it. But, hip-hop has played a role in cannabis advocacy since its inception, perhaps because of all the political turmoil that was happening on the topic around the time of the early hip-hop movement.  Various artists have played a role in this, both legally and illegally, and have certainly been influential in normalizing the cannabis conversation. ​Cypress Hill began some of the earliest advocacy efforts in the 1990s, even going so far as to light a joint on stage during ​Saturday Night Live ​in 1993, and have now even formed a partnership with Bhang Chocolates and ​officially become a part of the cannabis industry​. B-Real, lead artist for Cypress Hill, said, “It feels amazing that 25 years after we put our first album out, where we openly talked about legalizing marijuana, taboo at the time, that we finally as a people are living in time of legalization and now have opportunities to be a part of the blossoming industry.” ​Throughout his rap career, Snoop has performed songs such as ​​Smoke the Weed, Kush Ups, ​This Weed Iz Mine, and of course there’s Snoop’s now catch-phrase lyric from ​The Next Episode “smoke weed every day” which hit the market in 2000 and has become one of the hashtags still used most frequently by stoners on social media. He has been in the forefront of this movement for over 20+ years now, being featured on Dr. Dre’s album ​The Chronic in 1992. Snoop has recently ​entered the industry​ as well, launching his own line of products, Leafs by Snoop, that is based in Colorado and a venture capital fund called Casa Verde Capital with $45 million to invest in the cannabis industry.  Even in 2011, at the age of 23, when he was asked about cannabis, Khalifa said, “It’s not just a musical thing, not just a creative thing. I just like to be in that zone. And it helps me just do everything. Pot just plays a huge roll in the everyday mechanics of my life. It totally keeps me grounded,"" Wiz said in an interview​. He has advocated for the plant through his music and public appearances every since. Khalifa ​has partnered with RiverRock Cannabis ​and now has a strain all of his own, Khalifa Kush. You can watch B Real of Cypress Hill and Wiz Khalifa talk about the topic of cannabis together on ​Smokebox. It is no secret that New Orleans rapper Curren$y loves weed. He rhymes about it, he talks about it in interviews and continually helps to normalize the cannabis conversation in his music and outreach to fans. In 2012, when the very first United States (Colorado and Washington) legalized cannabis, he even offered a free weed rolling tray to anyone who pre-ordered his album ​Stoned Immaculate. Recently, Curren$y (aka Spitta Andretti), has partnered with long-time growers and attached his name to an OG strain after discovering it at a High Times Cup, and it has been coined “​Andretti OG.” This OG strain survived years of raids, relocations and was originally popped from seed. ​San Francisco based rapper Berner is a weed enthusiast and a businessman who grew up selling weed and making music because he enjoyed it, as did many other cannabis and hip-hop pioneers. Then, when his mom died of cancer, his mindset shifted and he became even more passionate about the cannabis movement. To date, Berner and his fam have created and marketed several unique cannabis strains, and he has also become a fashion and marijuana industry entrepreneur with his own medical marijuana dispensaries, Cookies SF, Collective Efforts, and H2C Cookies 707. He also owns two lifestyle clothing companies: FreshKo and Cookies​and runs a line of hemp water named Hemp20. Now, aside from seeing hip-hop artists both advocate for cannabis and enter the cannabis industry, we are seeing other cannabis collaborations that are hip-hop themed pop up, such as Green Hop​, which is the first historical hip-hop dispensary and is based in Portland, Oregon. Karaja Crews is the founder co-owner is the owner of Green Hop and said, “I was raised in the era of the early hip-hop movement and my adolescent years were spent being educated about who I was as a young black male by hip-hop artists,” and added, “I believe hip-hop helped cannabis become legal. The culture was unapologetic about the use of cannabis, artists kept talking about it and have ultimately help normalize cannabis.” Crews created the store to pay homage to the culture and to keep that story in the forefront, that “if it weren’t for hip-hop cannabis wouldn’t be legal and one of our key missions to help stop the cannabis stigma and to help promote science and medicinal benefits of the plant,” he explained. The shop does educational “know your bud” seminars, and is one of the only black-owned dispensaries in Portland. They are having their grand opening party on June 16th, and the headliner is Dead Prez. With how adversely minorities and especially young black men have been affected by cannabis prohibition and the overall drug war, it is critical that people of color who are entering the cannabis industry have equal access.  Organizations such as ​The Hood Incubator in California are trying to do just that. Their mission is to increase the participation of Black and Brown communities in the legal cannabis industry- as investors, owners, workers, patients, consumers, and advocates through community organizing, policy advocacy, and economic development. Crews says Green Hop is creating a business incubator similar to this and hopes to advocate for the same things in Oregon. ​ ​While some people think the term 420 originated from a police code, ​the association of 420 and weed ​originated in the 1970s with group of San Rafael High School friends known as the Waldos (because their chosen hang-out spot was a wall outside the school) who used the term in connection with a fall 1971 plan to search for an abandoned cannabis crop that they had learned about in a nearby forest.  They designated the Louis Pasteur statue on the grounds of San Rafael High School as their meeting place, and 4:20 p.m. as their meeting time. The group referred to this plan as ""4:20 Louis."" After having no success in finding the crop, they eventually shortened their phrase to ""4:20,"" which quickly spread through the early ‘70s stoner culture and has now evolved into a codeword that cannabis consumers use on the daily. 4/20 has become a day that pot smokers all over the world celebrate each April 20th. The day has managed to become something of a national holiday for cannabis consumers everywhere, even in the face of prohibition. So, what’s your 4/20 on this holiday?

Inspired by his association with the early Hip Hop Bboy breakdancers, namely the infamous Rock Steady Crew and the works of photographer Eadweard Muybridge, Modernists like Umberto Boccioni, Marcel Duchamp and Kandinsky whose work with dancer Gret Palucca is where Mare found a semblance in the distillation of the body and movement through the use of simple geometry. Breaking/Algorhtyhms is a mixed media exhibition that is both a testimony and an inquisition into the space where art, entertainment and technology converge. Mare’s earlier work in drawing, painting and sculpture will be featured, marking watershed moments of his 32 year exploration and innovation within this space. In his perpetual pursuit of the cutting edge, Mare’s centrepiece is the result of a groundbreaking collaboration with contemporary luminaries in the fields of animation, dance and motion capture. In his dynamic installation, Mare explores the intersection of new tech and performance through the direction and capturing of Bboy Ynot of the legendary Rock Steady Crew via the Rokoko Smartsuit, the first independent motion capture body interface of its kind. T obias Gremmler , data visualization programmer and animator, transforms the information into an emotive and captivating visual display. The work is true celebration of the human innovative spirit and the foundations of iconic Bboy Dance forms in a virtual, cerebral space. It is a glimpse into uncharted territory, where technology, movement and entertainment collide. Carlos Mare began his creative career during the formative years of NYC subway painting of 1975‐1985 (the Golden Era), he was among an elite group of artists who paved the way for the transition off subways and into the gallery world. Exhibiting and lecturing throughout the US and Europe as a US State Department Cultural Ambassador he lends voice to the importance of arts advocacy and art literacy to ensure and promote the rich cultural legacy of urban arts. His most notable work in this space is the creation of the Annual BET Award. His works have been exhibited at The Grand Palis in Paris, The Sharjah Museum, Pera Museum, Brighton University of Art, The Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art and El Museo del Barrio in NYC. ​ ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912204736.6/warc/CC-MAIN-20190325234449-20190326020449-00192.warc.gz

Don’t worry about it.” So I had to tell them, “alright, we gotta push it back again.” 2 weeks later, he sent me a text message with a high five and a happy faces saying, “50 is in the booth right now!”  I was like “oh s##t.” Then after he did it, we reached out and got the video set up. 50 pulled up to the shoot, and he actually ended up co-directing the video. It was crazy. It was a great experience too. I had to fly to New York to catch him, so I flew out there. He was booked for 6 hours, but ended up staying for 8 because he f##ked with us. It was cool. AllHipHop: Can you talk about your journey with Young Money? Fre$h: That was one of the best damn experiences of my life. Being around somebody as dope and Wayne, you can’t help but to have some of that rub off. AllHipHop: Were you at the Carter V  listening session? Fre$h: I wasn’t at the [Carter V] listening, I had my own event that same night. We ironically dropped on the same day, so that was pretty cool. Like I said, it was some of the best memories, some of the best experiences I’ve ever had. I got to work around Wayne a lot, and learn from him. He actually boosted my work ethic. At first, I felt like my work ethic was kind of… like I’d do a few songs a week and I’d be good. But nah, this man is working, doing songs every night. It just prompted me to make myself more available for the studio and less available for the bulls##t.  AllHipHop: What happened? Fre$h: You know, over time, I just saw something different for my career then what was offered at the time. Because Wayne wasn’t the boss of Young Money at the time, so what I wanted out of my career, they couldn’t give. It’s still all love. I was just with Gudda a couple weeks ago just kickin’ it, like we bros. I just wanted to go and make myself: my own name, my own brand. ​  ​ AllHipHop: Who are some producers that you’re fucking with? Fre$h: As you see, ISM did the whole project. That’s why it’s called frēsh•ism. ISM definitely is a guy that I have grown fond of working with, for the last year and a half. I like Chase and XL, they produced “Paul Masson.” Man, there are a lot of guys out right now, Mike Free just sent me some stuff. Honorable C-Note, that’s my man. We’ve been working together since the beginning of my career. Honorable C-Note, that’s my big brother. When my album first dropped, that’s the first person I text. I was like, “Ay bro, I wanted to holla at you man.” ‘Cause we’ve both been on this journey for a minute. We both literally came from doing songs in his basement, both of us. When I lived in Atlanta, we was together everyday. Me, him, and KY (the engineer). We was just all trying to get it, all on the same path of just seeing this thing through. I am happy for his success, like bro is so talented. He don’t even understand how dope he is. He hustles so hard. That’s my brother, we really came up together. I just included him on a list for Top 10 producers on LA Weekly. He definitely Top 5. He’s dope. AllHipHop: What are some goals for yourself as an artist at this point in your career? Fre$h: I mean at this point, I just want to make sure I touch as many fans as possible. Whether it be from my music, my interviews, or just the way I carry myself, I just wanna go down as one of those people that did it on all levels.

Having made music since 8 years old, it was at 15 that he starting recording in the lab. With songs like “Plot Twist” and “Fake Friends,” he touches on real-life experiences and hardships that make him the man he is today. AllHipHop caught up with the 25-year-old at the Spotify Best New Artist party during Grammy Week in Los Angeles.  AllHipHop: For those who don’t know, who is TEC? TEC. Luwhop Hussein. Representing Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The best, the illest rapper out right now. All the other s##t is bulls##t. AllHipHop: Where do you fit in the realm of hip-hop and R&B? TEC: I don’t fit in neither, I’m really a poetic activist. I wouldn’t call myself a rapper or singer. AllHipHop: You’re from Baton Rouge, how does that play into your life and career? TEC: It just helps me a lot to be prepared for whatever, knowing I could survive. It helps with my sound of music too. We got our own sound out there. AllHipHop: But you reside in Texas? TEC: I wanted a new scenery. Baton Rouge is just too easy to lose focus. It’s really not much if you’re trying to pursue the music type s##t, I needed to get somewhere else. Houston is a nice place to f##k with. They show me love out there. AllHipHop: When did you move to Houston? TEC: About a year ago. I just had to get away from Baton Rouge. I was losing focus out there, getting in trouble. It’s so easy to get into trouble, beef, s##t like that. I wanted to focus on my career. I really left, took a step, and did it all for my career. AllHipHop: Talk about the H-Town influence. You didn’t really come up in Houston, so you weren’t really around the Screw era. TEC: I ain’t gon’ lie, I don’t even really like screw music. I don’t f##k with that s##t, but I f##k with Pimp C. I f##k with Bun B. They’re legends. I f##k with a lot of artists from Houston, new artists like Lil Germ and Sauce Walka. I f##k with them, they got nice music. AllHipHop: What was the inspiration behind your name? TEC: I like the gun. It’s my favorite gun. When I was little, my favorite rapper’s name was Mac. I just wanted to name myself after a gun, and it was TEC. AllHipHop: Mack Maine? TEC: No, it’s another Mac. He went to jail a long time ago. He ain’t really have a long career like that, but he was a hard rapper back then.  AllHipHop: You released your project Web Life Vol.2. Can you talk about that? TEC: It’s the hottest s##t in the motherf##king streets. If you ain’t on the Web Life 2, you sleep. It’s up man, you get caught in the web and get stuck. This real spider s##t. I’m an 8-legged human and s##t forever. Go get that Web Life 2 and stream it everywhere. It’s over a million streams every motherf##king site it’s on. Gang s##t. AllHipHop: Was there a specific situation or moment that inspired the record “Fake Friends”? TEC: One of my closest of the closest friends showed me some fake s##t. I knew he was fake. After that, I just knew he was a snake. It started making me look at everybody like that. Because somebody so close to me was doing all this and I was blind to it, until I really started paying attention. Now I’m woke. Now I know. I look at everybody like they’re f##king snakes. It’s f##ked up. AllHipHop: Talk about being completely independent. TEC: The s##t hard work, but you’re gon’ see all of your money. Labels don’t do nothin’ but give you money that you have to pay extra, extra, extra interest on, and babysit you — when you can do all of the s##t yourself. It’s just hard work, but it’s going to pay off in the end. If you want the big bag or you just want the fame. It depends on which one what you want. AllHipHop: What happened with No Limit? TEC: I went to jail. When I got out, that kind of stopped the momentum we had going over there. When I came home from jail, I was trying to build that s##t back up when I got back out. But I was like “f##k it I got to start from scratch, so I might as well do my own s##t.” In the No Limit thing, P wanted me to work as a group with other artists. I just wanted to be solo, so I fell back from the s##t.  AllHipHop: How long were you locked up? TEC: 3 years. Real s##t. I was 18 when I first went to jail. AllHipHop: And you were signed before that? TEC: Yup, I was signed to P. AllHipHop: Can I ask what for? TEC: Armed Robbery and 1st Degree Murder. But the murder got dropped, and I didn’t do that s##t. But the armed robbery, I had to do time on that s##t. They dropped it, and I ended up getting 3 years. AllHipHop: Was that back in Baton Rouge? TEC: Yup in Louisiana. They extradited me. I went to jail out here in Cali. I was at the Twin Towers County Jail. Now I’m back out here at the f##king Spotify event with you. We doing this s##t. Not to be funny or sarcastic which I normally am but the interviewer must be really young or not know much about late 90's or early 2000's Down South Hip Hop Records. Mac was an artist ironically on No Limit Records. ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912203755.18/warc/CC-MAIN-20190325051359-20190325073359-00284.warc.gz
143,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/how-rolling-loud-became-the-biggest-hip-hop-festival-on-earth-TuRNR_PJqES-zXyxKWTVSQ/,"With Rolling Loud taking over Los Angeles this weekend (December 14th and 15th), music-lovers, artists, executives and everyone in between is looking forward to the two-day festival taking over Banc of California Stadium near USC. Created four years ago in Miami by Tariq Cherif and Matt Zingler, the world’s biggest hip-hop festival to date is only growing bigger and getting better. This year, Cardi B, Lil Uzi Vert, Post Malone, and Lil Wayne pave the way as headliners. AllHipHop caught up with Tariq Cherif a few days prior to the festivities, to talk about his immediate feelings and future goals. AllHipHop: How are you feeling now that Rolling Loud is a couple days away? Tariq Cherif: Feeling good! Always a little nervous, anxious but it’s what we do man. It’s exciting. AllHipHop:Tariq Cherif and Matt Zingler, what’s the dynamic between you guys? Tariq Cherif: That’s my dawg man. We have different ways of doing things and we have similar ways of doing things. We just try to capitalize off of each other’s strengths and just overcome each other’s weaknesses. AllHipHop: He’s the wild one, and you’re the calm one right? Tariq Cherif: I can get wild but he looks wild or whatever, so people put him in the wild box. But he’s pretty chill. AllHipHop: Is there a part in the festival where you are able to completely enjoy it? Tariq Cherif: There’s moments, there’s like a few moments where I am really able to enjoy myself. For the most part, I am just running around, making sure stuff is happening on time or trying to get it back on schedule, whatever might be the case.  AllHipHop: Explain some of the business that goes into running Rolling Loud? Tariq Cherif: It’s a lot of back and forth with booking agents to book the artists, and then back and forth with vendors to supply us with the supplies that we need and the labor that we need for the shows. The balance of those two. There’s a lot of business that goes down that I don’t really know how to describe. AllHipHop: What are some of the key obstacles you face as a business is scaling up? Tariq Cherif: In our international expansion, the key obstacles is getting Visa approval for artists to travel to different countries, and just dealing with other countries not being as embracive of hip-hop as America is. But we’re getting through it.  AllHipHop: I had the pleasure of attending Rolling Loud in the Bay Area this year. What was the best part? Tariq Cherif: The best part of Rolling Loud in the Bay Area, I’d say Ski Mask and Juice WRLD had great sets and Travis Scott. Wifi killed it. E-40 was really awesome. Berner. Having those Bay Area legends come and up and comers All Black and P-lo. The Bay has so much love for their own, and just for hip-hop in general. It was just awesome. I love the Bay Area, it’s one of my favorite places in the world. AllHipHop: Any behind-the-scenes catastrophes that took place? Tariq Cherif: I don’t speak on those. If it’s a catastrophe and you haven’t heard about it, then we did a good job of you not hearing about it. Try to keep it that way. The Bay was a pretty smooth show. I can’t think of a problem and if there was a problem, I forgot.  AllHipHop: What are you most excited for in LA? Tariq Cherif: I am most excited to have Cardi B headline our show. We have never had a female headliner and we are really proud of that. Super excited to see her representing. AllHipHop: Who are some artists that you are most excited for on the bill? Tariq Cherif: In particular… let me pull it up, it’s hard to say. I am excited for Yung Bans. I am excited for Wifi and Rob to do a shared set. I’m excited for Shoreline Mafia, Mozzy, SOBxRBE, Playboy Carti, Kodak Black, really excited for Kodak Black. That’s probably what I am most excited for is Kodak just because he’s from the crib. We just love Kodak in Florida, just excited for him to be a free man and have some fun.  AllHipHop: Talk about the local Toy Drive with Shoreline Mafia (the proceeds of which go to benefit East L.A. Rising and Schools On Wheels). What inspires you to give back? Tariq Cherif: This is Shoreline’s idea, but I love it. It’s funny ‘cause at the same time, we’ve been internally speaking within the Rolling Loud team about doing charity stuff, just affecting the community even more. We have some endeavors in the works but right now, we got the Toy Drive poppin’. Bring a toy to the show, unwrapped, and hopefully we really get a lot of toys together to benefit East L.A. Rising and Schools On Wheels to organizations in downtown LA that really benefit children in real need. Super excited about that.  AllHipHop: You’re expanding in Japan, China, and Europe. How far do you plan on taking this? Tariq Cherif: Well China is on pause until they figure out how much hip-hop they wanna accept. But we are looking at Hong Kong and going to Australia, Europe. There are a lot of territories that we are currently speaking with that even if they don’t happen next year, they might happen the year after. It just depends, it depends what the future holds. AllHipHop: What are some goals for yourself at this point in your career? Tariq Cherif: Man, I just try to do better every day than the day before. I just try my best to try my best. I’m not the type to set big goals. These big like mood board goals, like buy a house. make this much money or do this many shows a year. My brain doesn’t work like that. I just handle my stuff and just try to do better the next time.

144,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/hurricane-harvey-houston-and-the-aftermath-a-story-of-humanity-and-loss-OsycN6DxVESBCq8YgmRlKg/,"I grew up in Houston and I love the city. My career in the entertainment business started in H-Town and many of the people in the business there are family to me. My heart is torn right now. In the wake of the storm I reached out to my H-Town music family to ask them what was going on, to ask them to tell me the story of their city in their own words. As you read, please remember that this is the fourth largest city in the United States with many of the residents hailing from the previously devastated New Orleans. New Orleans has yet to recover from Hurricane Katina in 2005 and the work still isn't done. Houston faces a multi-decade recovery and the people in the community need all the love and monetary support that we can offer. It was August 24, 2017. The day before Houston experienced a biblical deluge for four days that flooded more than 30% of the city. Everything was different. The rich folks looked down on the city's poorest neighborhoods from their glass towers, ignorant that the playing field was about to be leveled by nature's most powerful element: water. As local music producer and my mentor Kojack said during our interview “Fire can't put out water, but water can put out fire.” “This sh-t affected everybody from the top of the food chain to the ants. White people, Indians, black folk, Lebanese – you can have everything, money in your bank accounts but you stuck in the shelters too,” Kojack elaborated . “You can't get to your money, no ATMs operating. We aren't any different than each other, we're on the same playing field now. That'll humble a mother f—ker” And sure enough, it's humbled people. This humility has created a newfound sense of community. Local business man and record label owner Tha Natural, from Houston's Northside best describes it in my opinion. He said, “I feel like really and truly, the storm, we look at it as a disaster, but at the end of the day, I feel like this storm is what's going to help bring this city back together. With humility comes prosperity. Now, you have to talk to your neighbor, you have to knock on the door to see if people are OK, but y'all ain't spoke the whole time y'all been living next door to each other.” Now lives have been lost. Neighbors are dead or displaced. As local legend Derrick “D Wreck” Dixon said, “Even the people who lost, if you still have the ability to cleanup and stand on two feet than you're blessed because some people lost their lives.” However, the general unity is still overshadowed by skewed media coverage and criminal neglect on the part of first responders. Willie D of the Geto Boys, who has evolved into an outspoken man of the people, didn’t mince words. “There is a sense that people are coming together, but it is tempered by the blatant neglect of first responders, and emergency workers for Houston't poorest neighborhoods. Some of them saw people stranded, and drove right by the them in emergency vehicles.” The absolute disregard for America's poorest citizens and preferential treatment of the rich is a problem in the wake of every natural disaster. I know when my home state, Louisiana, was rocked by hurricane Katrina it was no different. The media looked down on 'looters' as police murdered starving citizens in the streets. Cajun Navy, from my native Louisiana, got more media praise than Houston's own citizens and that is pathetic and unbalanced reporting. That’s not to take away from their efforts. Local DJ, Buddha, who acted as a remote first responder in collaboration with Southeast Rescue to save over 500 lives recounted, “Those Cajun Navy motherfu—ers showed up with their boats and a coonass can-do attitudes, they're true heroes.” The issue is: The Cajun Navy's fearless efforts weren't the only ones in boats helping, a narrative shaped by the media. Willie D chimed in, “One thing you likely didn't see on the news are the number of specifically Black men who stepped up during the storm and rescued people in the Black community using their own boats, pickup trucks, and fuel. We didn't wait on the government. I think the whole Katrina, FEMA thing was in the back of everybody's mind.” Leading the charge were Bun B and Trae Tha Truth, a pair of Hip-Hop’s finest-turned-heroes. Trae was literally at ground zero as the waters started to swell and pulled people out of flooding homes. Bun B was the spokesman and mouthpiece for the city, organizing a massive fund raiser. There were more though. Paul Wall using both music and movement, helping raise money and helping fix homes. Z-Ro recorded ""Houston 2Gether,” the first song about the tragedy after Hurricane Harvey. The American Red Cross' efforts are another media driven phenomenon. Kojack said, “Red Cross ain't giving no bread to the people. JJ Watt (the football player is) doing more for the people than the Red Cross. The Grammys did for me [more] than Red Cross, their Music Cares Foundation is sending me a check.” So the real question is where do we put our money if we want to help? Where do we donate responsibly to ensure that our funds touch the people of Houston? The JJ Watt Foundation, named after the All-Pro defensive end for the Houston Texans, and Gallery Furniture’s Jim ""Mattress Mack"" McIngvale has been hailed as a hero for his response in the wake of this disaster. JJ Watt has already raised $30 million and Mack continues to accept donations at all Gallery Furniture locations. So do Trae's We Are One GoFundme efforts. All go directly to the folks who need them. These storms won't stop coming. Right now, Hurricane Irma is sweeping through Florida and wiped out islands in the Caribbean. We have to remember human, which trumps American. We must remember that people's lives, their futures and their families are being disrupted and destroyed by this weather and well as the inevitable “hurricane gentrification”. Please, send help if you can. In this uncertain future the only that is certain that we must take care of each other or no one will.

145,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/ice-cube-talks-barbershop-the-next-cut-and-a-new-album-RrCb2fu0k0OMTY-zD5cVBg/,"Here are some questions and answers from our one on one candid conversation with Ice Cube: AllHipHop: Of the three “Barbershop” movies, how does this one rate for you? Ice Cube: Well, it’s hard to beat the first one. I mean it’s 1 A. So what does 1A mean? I mean it’s just as good as the first, it’s just not the first. Your character comes full circle from the first “Barbershop” movie in “Barbershop: The Next Cut.” In the first one, your character Calvin wasn’t sure that he even wanted the barbershop he had inherited from his father. Now in this movie, he is an elder statesman in the community because of his barbershop and what it represents for so many. Do you think that because of this “Barbershop: The Next Cut” is likely the last of the franchise or is there more that we haven’t seen? I think there is definitely more there. As long as there’s situations that people go through we can always highlight them and talk about them in “Barbershop.” And I still think Calvin – he was still trying to get out of there. He was still thinking about abandoning the neighborhood and going somewhere else and doing what most people do in these situations, so I still think he has some growing to do. As a producer on this movie, you came up with a large chunk of the dramatic A story – the barbershop holding a 48 hour cease fire – from an article that you happened to read about a real life barbershop in Memphis, Tennessee that did the same thing. If you hadn’t read that article, do you think that “Barbershop: The Next Cut,” while still very funny like all of the “Barbershop” movies, would have had such a timely but politically based bent? I think we would have – I was looking to connect it with what was really happening in Chicago, so I think that that element came out of it dealing with the son trying to stay out of the streets while trying not to get shot. I don’t know if the barbershop 48 hour free haircut day would have happened. I think we would have found the story because we were looking for it so hard, looking for what this movie needed to be. Either we would have found it or we wouldn’t have done the movie. So it really had to be about something. Yeah. I didn’t want to do it without having a good reason to do it. I didn’t want to do it because – I don’t think nobody did without having that good reason. Maybe MGM did, but we wanted to have a good reason to shoot this movie and talk about things that were really happening on the ground in Chicago. With “Everthang’s Corrupt,” it’s been awhile since you’ve come out with something new musically. Why now? You know, I haven’t promised a record yet. I’m still working on it. But I had to put it down for a minute to finish these movies and make sure they were right. To make sure “Ride Along 2” was right, “Barbershop” and “Straight Outta Compton” – and this is going to be the end of it. I did a movie called “Fist Fight.” I just didn’t want to spread myself too thin. Finish these movies and finish this promotion and then finish the record and put it out. “Everythang’s Corrupt” – was that title inspired by the Oscar nominations snub with “Straight Outta Compton”? Oh no. I named that album three years ago. So then where does that title come from? What’s that about for you? Everything is corrupt. Everything has a form of corruption. It has poison in it. It’s like a cancer. Everything. So just aside from current politics, Donald Trump and everything else? Oh yeah. Way aside from Trump. Everywhere. There’s corruption everywhere. That’s the problem. So is this album your way of dealing with it? I mean that’s just the title of what I’m talking about on the record. That we have to look at everything because everything is corrupt, and it’s a shame. But you know the hook on the song says: “For my birthday buy me a politician/ It’s a shame that we gotta teach the children/ Everything is corrupt/ Everything is corrupt.” Everything is corrupt so it’s kind of like that’s the theme. Do you think you’ll be working with your son O’Shea Jackson Jr. at all? Does he rap? Yeah. Yeah he do. He’s good too. He’s real good. I don’t know if he want’s to do that yet. He’s still in the process of landing his second movie, so I think he wants to be a movie star. I’m fine with that. So he can’t do both like his dad? Yeah, he can if he want’s to. I think he should focus on one over the other. I think the movie lane is open. You know, he’s second generation Hollywood. I think he should go that route and do music after he solidifies himself in the industry. Having been very successful both industries, do you see one as being easier than the other? The movie industry is a lot cleaner than the record business – it’s dirty. It’s a dirty business. It’s still harder to get a movie made than a record of course, but they pay you. They pay you right. You talk about the music industry being dirtier and of course you’ve got that whole business with Ke$ha and her lawsuit that she lost against her record label Sony\****, and her producer *Dr. Luke*\ based on her allegations of longtime sexual abuse from Dr. Luke. What’s your take on that?** What happened with her? In a nutshell, she’s accused Dr. Luke of having been sexually abusive to her since she first signed with him at 18 years old. Her contract with Dr. Luke’s company, Prescription Songs and his label, Kemosabe Imprint\****\, which is a Sony imprint, stipulates that Dr. Luke must produce at least six songs on all of her albums. Ke$ha claims to have sued because she doesn’t want to continue working with him, even though she has no problem staying with Sony, but Sony won’t let her out of her contract. Different female artists have come out in support of her since the ruling went against her. I know that this particular brand of ugliness hasn’t been your experience, but do you think that this level of “dirt” might be due to the fact that the music business might not be as transparent as the movie business when in comes down to it?** I think the same sort of stuff happens in the movie industry. If you really dig deep, there’s probably people who are victims of the casting couch, so to speak. With her, I think as a record label, I understand them not wanting to release her cause she’s a hit artist and they didn’t do nothing to her. If they assigned her that producer, they might be at fault but as a producer I think the fault is with the producer and they just need to get her a different producer. According to Ke$ha, that’s what Sony won’t do – though Sony has legally claimed otherwise. Oh well then yeah – I definitely wouldn’t record for them again. They might as well release me because I’m not doing another record. I’m definitely not working with this motherfucker. So I side with her if they feel that way. And so what’s next for you? Because you were talking about your next movie “Fist Fight” – what’s that about? Charlie Day is in that movie and we play two teachers who decide to have a fight after school at 3 o’clock. Kick yo’ ass. It seems like you are doing all of these projects that are speaking straight to being a dad or a father figure and things that men have to teach to the youngsters about manhood and what you should do as a real man versus what you might want to just run off and do. Is that a calculated choice or just an organic thing that has happened with you career? I think so. You know, I think it’s really organic to just be going that way. You know, I ain’t no young buck no more. I’m big daddy. Has time mellowed you out at all? It would seem that it hasn’t if you are writing “Everythang’s Corrupt” paired with what you wanted to get across as a producer in “Barbershop: The Next Cut” in regards to real life community situations for many people living in Chicago. I haven’t mellowed out at all as a person. People might see a character I play and for some reason they think if you play a preschool teacher on a movie then you’re into doing kid’s movies now and you’ve changed your life and that’s what you’re doing. It’s like naw, I just played this dumbass preschool teacher and there’s nothing different about me. I’m just trying to be a good actor.

With slingshot in hand, he tackles a myriad of topics, including mental health, love, social justice, God and coming up in his native New Orleans in a Cash Money-ruled world.  Now, this conversation is not short, but it is worth your time. Why? Because we love Hip-Hop and we appreciate the soldiers that remain principled in the face of Goliath. Dee-1, while smaller in stature, will square up to the beast and look it dead in the eye.  He talks about Jay-Z, 50 Cent, Lil Wayne, his efforts in a secular world, saving sex for marriage, his incredible new album and so much more. “""If Nas was a Hot Boy, that would be Dee-1,” he says confidently.

147,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/j-cole-roc-nation-s-young-gun-95iZQ-IVoEucDNE7pa-xTw/,"AllHipHop.com: So now you are the first artist signed to Roc Nation; very prestigious. How did you end up meeting Jay-Z and getting the deal? J. Cole: Well, as the story goes, somebody ended up playing the song I had [called] Lights Please for Jay. And from what Im told, he heard it, and as soon as he heard it he was just like yo, who is this kid, like what the fuck, I wanna set up the meeting. When it was told to me I didnt believe it, like I always say and a few weeks later I got the call out of nowhere. Just as I was starting to lose faith that is was real, I got the call that he wanted to meet. So I just flew out to the city, met with him for like three of four hours and the rest is history. Couple months later were doing a deal. AllHipHop.com: Did you ask Jay any of those fan ""if I ever meet Jay I'm definitely going to ask him..."" questions? J. Cole:Aww man, I still havent, I ask him questions but I havent asked him some of those questions like Yo one day Im gonna ask him I dont feel that comfortable yet. But I did tell him this funny story about how I stood outside the studio all night just waiting for him to come and I had beat CD for American Gangster, I was trying to get (a beat) on American Gangster and I tried to give it to him and he just played the shit out of me. He was just like yo, I dont want that shit. I told him the story, its a hilarious story. AllHipHop.com: So Roc Nation is not your run of the mill record label. How does your deal differ from an artist that signs with an Atlantic or a Def Jam? J. Cole: I dont know how their deals work over there now, so it might be similar but my deal is almost like all levels, obviously. Its not just record sales anymore its touring, its merchandising, actually I dont think they get merchandising, but its a lot more well rounded. But this works to my advantage because Im not just left out there to dry if my album doesnt do well. Which Im not expecting, but lets just say it did, I wouldnt be left out to dry, they would still be booking me shows cause they have an interest in that, theyre taking a piece. AllHipHop.com: Ok so you have this mixtape The Warm Up about to be released. What can people look forward to on that? Whats the sound like? J. Cole: I guess just an overview of my sound meaning you can expect a lot of storytelling, witty lyricism, introspective lyrics, you know, I get deep. I got some fun shit on there. But one thing you can expect is, whats the word, like a concise sound. Its me doing most of the production so its not one of those mixtapes where its like every song is different. Its not like that. Theres a sound, it almost feels like and album, it flows. So you can expect that. (There is) a lot of production from me. (There are) only two other producers on it, two songs. (not produced by me) AllHipHop.com: So you are from Fayetteville NC which is a big Army recruitment town. What was it like for you growing up? J. Cole: Well, the whole reason I was there is because I was an army brat. My mother and my father were in the army when I was young, so thats how we ended up there. Its diverse, theres a whole bunch of different types of people. You got, White, Black, Asian, Latino. So you meet a lot of different types of people, (I have had) a lot of different types of experiences. I done seen it all from the worst side of town to new kids from the best side of town. AllHipHop.com: I can imagine it must have been a big change moving to NYC. What kind of adjustments did you have to make? J. Cole: First of all, I had to get my sense of direction around here, its such a big city. [I had to] figure out how things work as far as trains and shit. I had to adjust to attitudes. Its faster paced so people have much shorter tempers and just different interactions with people. So I had to get used to all of that, get adjusted to being in school and not being around any family and having that to fall back on. AllHipHop.com: Now you graduated from St Johns in 2007 and from what I understand you were an excellent student. Since you were obviously not relying on your talents as a rapper to be your meal ticket, what was your major? What were you planning to do if the rap thing didn't work out? J. Cole: I started out a Computer Science major as a freshman but I switched quick as hell cause it was boring, to me. Then I switched to Communications a couple years later. It seemed like a generic major but I couldnt picture myself doing anything else. But the honest truth is I never ever even visualized any other career, I never even decided on the type of job I would look for. I knew, at least I hoped, I just knew it would be rap. AllHipHop.com: Shifting gears, your first mixtape The Come Up hosted by DJ On Point came out in 2007. How did you connect with On Point and how did this tape help you get the attention of your new manager Mark Pitts? J. Cole: I got On Point for the mixtape through my man Aristotle. We were working together for a while, back in 07. So he set up the On Point thing. As far as the mixtape goes, it didnt get me to Mark Pitts. (laughs) I dont even know if Mark Pitts honestly has heard The Come Up, it was so under the radar like that. I got to Mark Pitts through other avenues. Actually someone that works for him happened to hear my shit and got it to him. So The Come Up was really under the radar, people are just now going back to listen to it. AllHipHop.com: You recently went on a small tour with Wale. Was that your first time on tour? What was that experience like? J. Cole: Yeah, that was my first time on tour. I really didnt even go to every city with him, I was doing east coast cities. It was fun man, it was literally just me and my team hoping in the whip and driving down the east coast to the shows. It was fun. It gets no more fun than that at these beginning stages. Were paying for shit (like) food out our pockets, hotels and shit. Its just really the grind. It was the best man because people dont know you when you get on stage and they dont know whether they want to cheer for you or be like get the fuck off the stage. By the end of the show hopefully I grabbed their attention enough for them to be like yo that dude was sick, what was his name again? AllHipHop.com: These days it seems like artists need to saturate the market independently before they are able to get a deal which can be a problem because when they do get their deal and its time to release a project, their is no anticipation because they have released so much material. You on the other hand got you deal before the buzz really even began which is reminiscent of a 90s marketing format. Do you feel like that gives you an advantage? J. Cole: I hope so. I hope that gives me an advantage. I think so and I hope so but that was all planned. Three years ago when I was really like Im getting a deal, fuck it. Everybody was saying that you have to go out and get your buzz first before you get a deal. You have to put out mixtape after mixtape, you have to do this, you have to get radio, you have to get your myspace friends up. I think right now I probably got 2,000 myspace friends. There are independent artists with way more friends than me. I have no buzz, or had no buzz up until right now. So I never believed in that theory. I was always the one that was like I dont HAVE to do that I dont have to fuckin follow that way of thinking And I didnt I got a deal based off my music with zero buzz. And it does help me out because Im sneaking up on the game rather than already having my name out there. Now people are more curious like who the fuck is this that just got signed. Its just like what you said, the way it used to be. AllHipHop.com: Hopefully theyll start doing that again. J. Cole: Yeah, I hope so. AllHiphop.com: Another artist whose buzz is defining right now is Drake. I have heard people compare you to Drake several times in the past few weeks. I don't really hear the similarities, have you been getting a lot of that? J. Cole: Ive been getting enough of it to hear about it but I wouldnt say Ive been getting a lot of it. But Ive definitely heard it. AllHipHop.com: When I listen to your music, I hear subtle elements of 2pac, Nas and Kanye West. Who are your biggest influences? J. Cole: Damn, everybody you just named definitely. 2pac is just my favorite rapper, period. Kanye, hes one of my favorite rap ARTISTS, period. Not even just rapper/producer, just one of my favorite rap artists ever. Nas, Im a huge fan, huge studier. Eminem as well was big for me. Even Royce Da 59 in that same 98/99/2000 period, Royce was huge for me, Canibusand Jay of course, a sprinkle of Jay. These are artists that all had huge influence on me. Kanye definitely though with the beats, and Dilla and Preemo (laughs) as I fade out with all of the greats. Simba AllHipHop.com: I have heard a great deal of your music but the record I have seen generating a buzz online is ""Grown Simba"" what's the reaction you have been getting from that song? J. Cole: Its been great. From what Ive seen from it, its a good response. People are really feeling the beat. Im proud of that. And I just see people saying oh he goes hard. But I look at it like, those songs that I put out, other than Dead Presidents 2, I feel like the other songs that I put out, theyre dope, I like them and I stand for them but they dont even really truly reflect me. Youre gonna see the ENTIRE me on the mixtape. Thats why Im really adamant about people listening to the whole mixtape and not judging based on Grown Simba or Dead Presidents 2, hearing everything. But Grown Simba yeah, I love that song. video platformvideo managementvideo solutionsfree video player AllHipHop.com: Have you begun working on the album? What producers have you been getting in with? Any secret Jay-Z colabs we should (or shouldn't) know about? J. Cole: (laughs) As far as my album, yeah Ive been working for the past two years on my album, so I been working on that but once this Warm Up shit kinda cools off, little play on words, (laughs) Ill be able to really get in. Two weeks from now Ill be able to really sit down, analyze what Ive got, what needs to go, what needs to come in. As far as secret Jay-Z collaborations man, I mean all I can say is, (laughs) if there were to be any secret Jay-Z collaborations, I wouldnt be able to speak on them. BUT, you know, I would ASSUME that by this point I might have been in the studio with him. If I was an outsider looking in I might assume that, but Im not saying anything in particular you know... (laughs) AllHipHop.com: What can the people look forward to from J. Cole in the coming year? J. Cole: This bangin ass mixtape that I need you to dive in (to) and explore, in an out, which is called The Warm Up. Im on Wales mixtape as well, Back to the Feature. Im on Wales album which comes out I think end of the summer. I might, I got some top-secret shit lined up, top-secret features lined up. And then look for a big college tour from me. Not big in terms of size but big for me in terms of my idea for it. So look out for that next semester, whats that fall 09 for all you college kids. And you know, just look for me around, Im working hard. I havent gotten a deal and gotten comfortable, I feel like I havent made it yet. So I still got a lot of work to do.

Clive's legendary Pre-Grammy Gala was held at the Sheraton Times Square and  included guests such as Diddy, Quincy Jones, Jimmy Jam, Jamie Foxx,  Timbaland, Remy Ma, Fabolous, Jadakiss, T.I.,  Monica, John Legend & Chrissy Teigen, honoree of the evening Jay-Z, his wife, the first lady  of music Beyonce, Barry Manilow, Gladys Knight, Jerry Seinfeld, Martha  Stewart, Tina Fey, Nick Jonas P, Sting, Pink, Lorde, Cardi B, Khalid,  Ludacris, Maxwell, Lil Uzi Vert and many more! As  usual, Clive was such a gracious host as he took time out to recognize  all of the A-listers and big names in the room between each break. Davis even poked fun at Jamie Foxx & Katie Holmes for [still] pretending to not be together by sitting at separate tables. “If you’re going to sit together what better night than  tonight,” said Clive. The night truly belonged  to Jay-Z, who honored with the Recording Academy's Industry Icon award  at the gala, and  he was nominated for eight Grammy Awards at Sunday's  ceremony. Jay-Z took the stage to accept his award, and while doing so, he reflected on his relationship with the Recording Academy. Hov  explained that there once was a time period where he boycotted the  Grammys for six consecutive years starting in 1999 when he felt that DMX and other Hip Hop artists were snubbed. Jay-Z didn't  return until 2004 ""when a beautiful young lady whom I love dearly,"" said Jay-Z was  nominated for their collaboration ""Crazy In Love"". Jay-Z filled everyone in with the obvious allusion to his wife as he added, ""the beautiful Ms. Beyonce,"". Jay-Z  revealed that he decided to attend the ceremony again with the belief  that he could use his voice and platform to enact change. ""Art is super-subjective and everyone's  doing their best. The academy, they're human like we are and voting on  things that they like.  We can pretend that we don’t care but we really care — we care ’cause  we’ve seen the most incredible artists stand on that stage and we’re  inspired to be that, so I was like, ’I have to be here. That is the idea for all of us to get involved and to push this thing further no matter what happens at the Grammys, it’s going to be what it  is. Bob Marley is going to be Bob Marley, whether he’s nominated for a  Grammy or not. Tupac is going to be Tupac, Biggie is going to be Biggie,” said Jay-Z Hov  also noted that The Recording Academy hasn't always elevated Hip Hop  and rap or it's artists, but he acknowledged that it does now. He also  encouraged those that care about music to get involved to bring about  the change they want to see. Davis  also honored Beyonce early on in the ceremony by highlighting her awareness of music and her 62 Grammy nominations. Davis referred to  Beyonce as the ""first lady of music."" This declaration gained the Queen Bey a standing ovation. Alicia  Keys also took the stage to pay tribute to Jay-Z by running through a  piano-accompanied medley of his hits. The set list included a soulful  version of fan favorites ""Hard Knock Life"", ""Run This Town"", ""Encore"",  and ""U Don't Know"", and their collaboration, ""Empire State Of Mind"". Keys referred to Jay-Z as “one of the greatest that’s ever done it."" ​  Clive always has the perfect mix of music industry newcomers and veterans and  legends performing at the gala. This year's gala saw performances from  Luis Fonsi, Gladys Knight, The Migos, Barry Manilow, and Jennifer Hudson closed out the evening. Gladys Knight performed  “Stand by Me” and “Midnight Train to Georgia"", Khalid performed ""Young  Dumb And Broke"", and Jennifer Hudson closed the evening with a tribute to  Aretha Franklin, who happened to hand-pick her to play her in her  upcoming biopic. Check out our interviews with Remy Ma and T.I.

The lines to enter the venue extended down the street and the space was packed to capacity as fans anticipated a great show. Tone The Goat hit the stage with high energy that caused the packed house to quickly get into his vibe as he performed “Burn Slow,” a song specifically for Dutch Maters. “Mr. On the Way” himself, DJ Luke Nasty, hit the stage for a surprise performance during DJ Esudd’s set and it was a crowd favorite. The tattooing goddess known as Dutchess Lattimore, formerly of “Black Ink,” also surprised the attendees with her very first music performance alongside Ricky Blow. Da Deacon of Miami shocked the crowd when he brought a marching band on stage to perform his hit song “Michael Jackson.” Kenny Burns, the host for the packed event, kept the crowd energized between performances, while DJ Esudd made sure the party atmosphere continued to heighten as he played hit after hit. In between the non-stop partying and musical madness, attendees were gifted with Dutch Masters swag and made slow motion social media videos via the interactive stations.https://youtu.be/GivF1eudeYo Before hitting the stage, Jeezy sat with Kenny Burns for a Q&A. When asked by Kenny his definition of what it means to be a master craftsman. he answered, “It’s never been about the money; it’s always been about the movement and what you represent. If you gon’ be a master craftsman, you have to treat this shit like every verse is your first verse, every show is your first show, every song is your first song, and every ad lib is your first ad lib.” By the time Jeezy performed, the crowd was already unbelievably hyped. They recited his lyrics word for word, as Jeezy commanded every inch of the stage and room. When the lights came on indicating the end of the show, there wasn’t one dissatisfied face in the house. Dutch Masters delivered a great show with a dope ambiance and left all attendees with an enhanced awareness of what it means to #BurnSlow.

Executive produced by Collins, The New Edition Story broke BET  ratings records, won over the hearts of many, and undeniably became a  new classic biopic when it aired in January 2017. BET has now returned with, The Bobby Brown Story (also executive  produced by Collins) which picks up where the previous biopic left off.  The two-night series will follow Brown’s successful solo career.  Woody McClain has returned to reprise his role as Brown, one of the  original “Bad Boys” of R&B, whose life  has been a true  representation of the highs of incredible success and the lows of  tragedy, trials, and trying times. Brown's life epitomizes hits, classics, sex, drugs, and R&B. While Brown kept himself on the top of the charts, he also kept himself on the front pages of media publications as well. Mekhi Phifer, Gabrielle Dennis, Lil Rel Howery, T.K. Carter, Laz Alonso, Lance Gross,  Alyssa Goss and Sandi McCree are set to star in the biopic as Brown’s  brother, ex-wife Whitney Houston, manager, MCA producer-executive, childhood friend, current wife  and mother. The two-night miniseries is slated to premiere September  2018. AllHipHop sat down with The Bobby Brown Story's executive producer,  Jesse Collins, to discuss just how raw and entertaining the series will  be. ​ AllHipHop: How did the New Edition Story come about? Jesse Collins: So when I was five years old I was watching the  Jackson Five movie, maybe I was a little older than that. But then I saw  that, then I watched the Motown 25, and I saw The Temptations, and then  I was like one day I want to make a music biopic. So the New Edition  biopic came about where I had done BET's 25th anniversary. It was a  reunion show where I got all 6 original members together. They hadn't  been together in a while, and in the process of that, I really got to be  brought in behind the curtain to see the function and dysfunction of  the group, and that's just when I just really fell in love with the  story and potential of it all. So then it was the process of getting the  guys on board, finding a writer, going out and shopping it to multiple  places, and BET was the one that really stepped up and said yes. It took  a while, but eventually it wound up on screen, and everybody was right.  So we are real happy with that. During that process we always talked  about doing the Bobby story, and we purposely left a lot out of Bobby, a  lot of Bobby's story out of New Edition, so we could come back and tell  the story of a guy that's been greatly misunderstood by everyone.  In  this movie you are going to find out the most important question is. ""Why?""  Why so many tragedies happened in his life and how he got to the  incredible levels of success that he did as a solo artist. So you really  will gain a deeper understanding of who Bobby Brown is."" AllHipHop: What can we expect from the movie? Is is raw? Is it uncut?  Is it comedic? Is it gritty? What can we expect from this? What's the  different direction maybe a little bit  from [The] New Edition [Story]?  The story's different, but is the production different? Is the direction  different? Jesse Collins: So yes, the Bobby Brown movie, it goes very deep; it  goes very deep into the heart and soul of Bobby Brown, which is gritty,  which is raw, which is also fun. So we're going to hit all of those  touch points. I think New Edition was trying to tell story of 6 people, 7  with Brooke, so you couldn't really dive so deep into everyone's true  journeys. It was more the journey of a group. This is, we're just  getting in, we're getting in. We're showing you stuff that Bobby never  thought he'd never actually share with people. But it's what you had to  do to make this movie interesting. AllHipHop: What's your favorite reenactment thus far or your favorite reenactment that's coming in the script? Jesse Collins: Well I love that we're going to match the ""My  Prerogative"" video. I love that we're going shot for shot with that. We  have the wedding, and we are doing a little bit of the reality show.  We're matching a lot of things which  I think people will be excited  about. I think what I'm most excited about is the stuff that nobody  knows: the conversation with Bobby & Whitney after the Diane Sawyer  interview, and how that affected their relationship, and where they went  after that. It's that kind of stuff, and really also understanding like  everybody thinks that, while the relationship did start at Soul Train  [Awards] we're going to show the connection wasn't based on her poking  him in the back. There was something else that happened that night that  drew them together. And that's the story. You're going to find out why  they really fell in love and what that relationship really was  like,  and then you'll see how he's come back from that and survived a lot of  death; a lot of tragedy and really found peace and serenity in his new  life, in his new wife and his children. He's a completely different  Bobby Brown, so we get to see full circle of this guy. AllHipHop: What's next for Jesse Collins? Jesse Collins: We want to get this out, and we have the BET Awards  coming in late June. We're really excited about that. So that's what's  up next on BET. We have the third season of 'Dear Mama' which is a great  special we do with Queen Latifah, celebrities honoring their mothers.  That's coming up in May, and the third season of Hip Hop Squares which  is going to be ratchet fest extravaganza. We have some moments. We have  some Tamar Braxton stuff that is a movie. We do a Love & Hip Hop  episode. That is wow. It is amazing! AllHipHop: Who are your ""Top 5"" rappers dead or alive? Jesse Collins: In no particular order right. Alright here we go.

The first trial ended in a hung jury, while the guilty verdict in the second trial was overturned after a judge limited the mogul's defense's line of questioning in relation to testimony given by a man named Brian McCleod. McCleod testified in Jimmy's first trial and claimed the mogul never used words like ""kill"" and ""murder"" in relation to Lowell Fletcher's death. The rap mogul is betting the flawed evidence will help undo his murder conviction and life sentence, in addition to invalidating a lifetime punishment for drug dealing, since the conviction is based on the same witnesses statements. Check out Jimmy Henchman's open letter to the prosectutor, as his third murder trial and fourth overall trial in connection to drug dealing and murdering rapper 50 Cent's friend begins next week. OPEN LETTER TO THE PROSECUTOR Dear Mr. Prosecutor, Trial? Really? Again? I cannot believe that you are actually taking me to trial again. Our first trial ended with a hung jury, and while a guilty verdict was delivered at the end of the second trial, that conviction was promptly overturned by an appeals court based on the finding that you and the judge had gravely denied me my constitutional rights. So here I stand again for the third time. I ask what exactly is your reason for subjecting me to yet another trial when I already have such a substantial sentence? This will be my 4th trial in 6 years. At this point, your obsession with my persecution appears to be nothing more than a thinly-veiled vendetta. You seem to have forgotten the great ethical responsibility which falls to a prosecutor--your job is not to win a conviction at any cost, but rather to ensure that justice is granted to all, regardless and in spite of your personal agenda. Mr. Prosecutor, I know this is a game to you and you're acting out a role in your personal theatre, where my life & freedom hangs on the balance of the scales of justice but only I am the one with something to lose. You have no ""skin"" in the game. That would make sense why you feel the need to take me back. Or maybe this is your Moby Dick moment - the thrill of the kill - like hunting a lion to hang on the wall or lassoing a wild bull; or is it a chance for you to take a photo pose in front of a tree and I am your ""strange fruit?"" You're employed by the Criminal Justice system that allows you to live out your wildest imagination to the fullest. ​  ​ Mr. Prosecutor, its hard for the issue of race not to be questioned here, when its a factor of all genre of today's life: politics, mass incarceration, entertainment, sports, healthcare, Blacklivesmatter, etc; while documentaries like 13th and books like The New Jim Crow capture the quintessential scheme of the Criminal Justice System. In fact, when I look around, I'm surrounded by Black and Brown men. Truthfully, most of these men need mental health rather than lengthy jail sentences. One would be led to believe that minorities are the only ones that commit crimes, yet we know that is simply not the case. My 16-year-old daughter questioned me one day were there only black men that were incarcerated. Just recently, the lost essays of George Moses Horton were found at the New York Public Library. Mr. Horton was a slave that taught himself to read and write and became the first Black author in the South to be published in 1823. Scholars have said his discovered writings sound strikingly similar to today's issues when it comes to ""race, power and free speech."" ​  ​ Mr. Prosecutor, this is particularly true in the Criminal Justice System for a Black man sitting in a courtroom where the jurors are not my peers and the mention of rap music is code word for rape (sex), illegal drugs (cash), and murder (guns and violence). Its the same code words used to the nation when #45 says, ""please don't treat them nice"", and when Jeff Session tells his prosecutors to ""prosecute them to the fullest extent of the law."" Can you please explain to me who are ""them""? Its the same epithets used during my three prior trials, ""they, them, hip-hop, rappers, rap manager"", etc. Just because I wore a suit you said I was a ""gangster in a suit"" or because I ran a successful artist management company and my roster included some famous hip-hop artists, you labeled my company a ""crime organization."" I must ask why? Is it your preconceived notions about the color of my skin that prevent you from presenting me as a legitimate executive successfully operating in the entertainment industry? During the trial you referred to the facts of my case as a war, invoking images for the jury of an event plagued with continuous bloodshed when really, at the heart of the case, was a 14-year-old child being assaulted by grown men with guns. ​  ​ Society relays on prosecutors to be an officer of the court that follow the facts where ever it takes them and present the truth to the jury, not to win at all cost. Prosecutors have too much power that has no checks and balances to temper their ambition to make headlines or their selfish run for office as politicians, (e.g., Rudy Giuliani, Todd Kaminsky). This is why most prosecutors will hide evidence or take a man to trial without evidence because they aren't punished even when they intentionally send innocent men to jail. It becomes a number game with hitting a quota than sending the guilty to jail. Benjamin Franklin said it best, ""it is better for 100 guilty men to be set free than one innocent man to be sent to jail."" ​ ​  ​ You are intent on making a name and career for yourself as the prosecutor who will take down hip-hop as a culture, and you have chosen me as your poster boy for this movement. I question if this singular objective is personal for you, or if it is merely indicative of the motives of our entire criminal justice system, comprised of prosecutors, judges and law enforcement. I wonder is this a reprisal on Hip-Hop as a culture, due to its undeniable social influence over the past few decades, or is it the unfortunate but continued the government-sanctioned systematic persecution of men of color in this country? ​  ​ Mr. Prosecutor, I will not be as judgmental of you as you have been of me and call you a racist. Albeit, a look at the roster of defendants that you have prosecuted might prove otherwise. I curse the day that you chose me as the face of your crusade against the hip-hop community. You reserve for me the harshest allegations and punishments available. You have saddled me with charges on par with those received by El Chapo, and sentences normally reserved for terrorists. Yet you say this is justice. Your foremost duty is to follow the facts of a case, wherever they may lead, and present only the facts to the jury. You are not only compelled but also obligated to, not so much focus on winning a case but ensure that justice is done. I sincerely hope that you are able to look past your personal ambitions and desires to create headlines for yourself and ensure that I get my justice that is long overdue. ​  ​ And even if this ends with a hung jury, guilty or an acquittal you will always be known as the prosecutor that could never win a victory over me - and even when you did - the court of appeal reversed you. And for playing me you shall forever remain nameless and hopeless. While you look for glory, you will find shame and made an example of while you turn into a pillar of salt. If it is true that the universe bends toward justice, then this trial outcome will vindicate me.

Jurors deliberated for roughly an hour and after almost two weeks of witness testimony, Jimmy Henchman, born James Rosemond, was found guilty of hiring gunmen to kill an associate of 50 Cent. Prosecutors maintain Lowell ""Lodi Mack"" Fletcher was shot and killed in retaliation for an incident in which several G-Unit members including Tony Yayo, were accused of smacking Jimmy Henchman's young son back in 2007. Prosecutors claimed this act set the murder plot in motion. Jimmy was accused of handing over two kilos of cocaine to members of his drug gang as compensation for the hit, which took place in 2009. During the latest trial, prosecutors brought out many of the same witnesses who testified against Jimmy during his two previous murder-for-hire trials. JImmy's first trial over Lodi Mack's murder ended in a hung jury, but he was convicted after his second trial in 2015. The CZAR Entertainment mogul was granted a third trial last year , after it was discovered the judge had improperly limited Jimmy's defense team in questioning a key witness. Representatives for Jimmy Henchman told AllHipHop.com they plan to appeal the latest guilty verdict. At the height of Jimmy's career, he managed artists and celebrities like Mike Tyson, Wyclef, Game, Brandy, Gucci Mane and others. Prior to the murder convictions, Jimmy was serving four life sentences for allegedly running a massive, coast-to-coast drug operation that supposedly started in 1996, and lasted until 20111, when the Feds broke up the operation. The government has seized over $10 million in cash, as well as $4 million worth of assets from Jimmy Henchman. Appeal again? How many times is the state gonna try this rat?

155,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/jimmy-henchman-murder-for-hire-trial-3-jury-selection-4eJLpqLKeEaPonxM3BnUTw/,"November 6, 2017 By: DJ Sikorski As a citizen of the United States of America, the federal criminal justice system is a foreign land to the majority of people. Only those who work inside it or those facing criminal charges get to see the systems, its corruption, and at times, pompous proceedings that take place inside federal court buildings up close. In New York City, there are two cathedrals of justice: They are commonly called the Southern District, which is located in downtown New York City in a cavern of buildings as imposing as Roman coliseums. The Eastern District is located in downtown Brooklyn, an area being gentrified as we speak by European and hipster money. The “Districts,” is where legal genius is practiced on both sides of the aisle, and it also is where careers are made, lives are ruined, and headlines are grabbed in the New York daily papers or national news. Disciples of the Eastern and Southern Districts know it is where U. S. Attorneys go to make their bones. Lawyers, such as Rudolph Giuliani, Michael Chertoff, Preet Bahara, Todd Kaminsky, James Comey, and Mob bosses: John Gotti, Carmine Persico, and celebrities like Martha Stewart have fought battles inside these hallowed courtrooms. On Monday, November 6, I traveled to the Southern District to observe the murder trial of James Rosemond, also known as Hip-Hop Impresario, Jimmy Henchman. Rosemond is on trial for the third time  for a murder-for-hire plot of a known gang member, and G-Unit entourage member, Lowell ""Lodi Mack"" Fletcher (seen in the white coat below). The first trial ended in a hung jury, and the second trial resulted in a conviction that was very quickly thrown out on appeal. In a prior proceeding years ago, Rosemond was charged and ultimately convicted under the federal Drug Kingpin Act. He is currently serving four life sentences under that charge and case. I have covered at length in print and also as a documentary film titled ""Unjust Justice,"" the drug case. Now, I will be addressing the issues inside this murder trial from the front row. Over the course of the trial, I will try to view the case with fresh eyes. Similar to how a jury will now look at Rosemond, the evidence, and the two stories presented in front of them. I will make no assumptions about his guilt or innocence until the end. I will, however, have my focus on the system of justice: What does justice means in 2017, and is this federal criminal trial fair and just? I stood in line at 500 Pearl Street on Monday at nine in the morning. . . the first stop was an extensive, security checkpoint. It was similar to an airport with metal detectors and imposing federal security. You are required to check all electronic devices via a cloakroom. From there, I took an elevator to a designated courtroom, in this case, 21B, the domain of Federal Judge Lewis Kaplan. This white-haired, gruff, yet eloquent, elder statesman runs his courtroom with precision and some bad, tonal humor for anyone willing to listen. ​  ​ The first day in any federal trial is jury selection. Prior to that, there was a brief hearing and a request by Jimmy’s lawyer, David Touger. Twenty-four hours prior to the trial starting, the United States Attorney-led by Samuel Enser, Drew Skinner, and Elizabeth Hanft dropped four-thousand pages of Facebook posts as discovery on the defense. Touger asked Judge Kaplan if the government could provide Jimmy and the defense with a paralegal to go through the discovery. Kaplan, with no sympathy or compassion, stated that if Jimmy could afford two lawyers, he could also afford to pay another paralegal to go through this new evidence. The problem in addressing that issue is Jimmy has been in jail for at least eight years. Where could he find additional money that wouldn’t be an immense strain on his family or friends? It is obvious, that the government didn’t want him to have a fair, playing field. I asked the defense if the four-thousand pages of Facebook posts were actual evidence or a sheer game of brinkmanship by the United States Attorney. The posts, I later found out, belonged to Jason Williams, who has been in jail for more than five years. He had been previously charged with conspiracy to commit murder in this very case. In the first two trials, Williams did not testify for the government; however, he was promised that he would be home by Christmas. Now, Williams will be testifying against Jimmy. One has to beg the question, how does someone inside a federal jail have close to four thousand pages of Facebook posts, and secondarily, what does it have to do with this story? When you spend any time with criminal defense attorneys or investigators, whose job it is to fight for the defendants, you quickly learn that the system is rigged in favor of the government to convict the clients. You have to suspend belief that almost ninety percent of the cases brought by the prosecutors are successful. One would think that these young, pit bull attorneys for the government are that good, but upon any further research and off the record conversations, I realized that isn’t the case. The corridors of justice are just plain unjust. And to further their success rate, they will pull any trick out of a book, as they are not held to any level of ethical or moral expectations. In observing the government’s team against Rosemond, they remind me of robots without passion, soul, or warmth towards any jury. They have all of the tools that far outweigh the defendants’ right to have fair trials. In the case of Rosemond, the government has the luxury of arguing this case for a third time. In essence, they can hone their delivery and theatrics. They can train witnesses to give an even better performance to a jury, who has no prior knowledge that this same charge has played out two times prior with the end result not in their favor. Why would a government spend millions of dollars and thousands of manpower hours to convict a man, who currently is in a federal prison four times longer than his actual expiration? Is it revenge? Is it fear? Is it a stat to perpetuate that ninety-percent conviction rate? Or is something bigger playing out? Is the government worried that Rosemond might beat the case? It is flimsy, at best, and perhaps, it could ultimately fall apart. The Jury The federal jury selection exercise is much different than the selection for state courts, or any legal procedurals on CBS. It is a quick procedure; there are not any fancy, jury experts, and to be honest, it really comes down to luck and gut instincts as they select the jurors. Forty-two, prospective jurors show up; twelve of which, with a few alternates, will decide Jimmy’s fate. Judge Kaplan told everyone that the entire process would be done by lunchtime. It is hard to believe that in this rush to judgment in a two-hour span, a jury will be selected that will inevitably decide a man’s fate. Is that just? Shouldn’t there be some form of extensive questioning to determine their insights. I wondered how a judge could expedite the process? If the defendant is facing life in jail, who would you want as a juror? Young males? Stay-at-home Moms? The working class plumber from the Bronx? One defense attorney told me that he never wants immigrants because they came to the United States and now hold its values in a higher esteem than the working class stiff. As a seasoned, Hip-Hop executive, and entrepreneur, Rosemond is an African-American in a system that was built to enslave, to imprison unjustly, and incarcerate at an alarming rate. As I cover this case and many others, I have come to realize that the Southern and Eastern Districts are corrupt wheels of justice that cloak themselves in purity and truth. These districts have not been established to play fair; they are rigged in the favor of money and power. This money and power comes in the form of a pay-to-play scheme, where defense attorneys are enriched to the tune of millions of dollars. United States Attorneys work long hours for that cushy job at a white-shoe law firm or a seat at the coveted wheels of political power and prestige. As the government presented their first few witnesses, court ended at 4: 30 PM. ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202781.33/warc/CC-MAIN-20190323080959-20190323102959-00265.warc.gz
156,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/jimmy-henchman-murder-for-hire-trial-3-kilos-in-exchange-for-murder-HRPC2Rm6FUOieopMAYoa1g/,"By: Don Sikorski As the early stages of the trial progressed it was obvious the early set up by the government was over, and the meat of their case was now going to be presented to the jury efficiently as possible. Khalil Abdullah was called to the stand, and his relationship with Jimmy is a key component to every charge Jimmy faces. Khalil Abdullah is a seasoned hustler, someone who has been playing the drug game since he was a teenager. In order for the jury to believe Abdullah, they have to take into consideration a few things. Khalil, like Mohammed Stewart, has a storied criminal past, one that not only includes gun violence but prior narcotics charges. In the investigation that I undertook when I produced the documentary series, ""Unjust Justice"" I met personally with Khalil in Harlem. My hope was to hear a different perspective or his side of the story. For the record, I did not record our encounter or take notes. Khalil was not sure he wanted to be a part of the film, and he decided not to. It was obvious from the conversation that there was no love lost between Jimmy and Khalil. In the drug kingpin trial, the government did a great job of describing a pyramid structure of Jimmy’s so-called drug organization. In that pyramid, Khalil was below Jimmy and if you believe the government Khalil answered and only moved if Jimmy told him to. In our conversation, it was apparent, that Khalil was equal, and in his mind, his trafficking was on par with Jimmy. The truth always falls into some grey area, and in this story, there is a ton of grey. Khalil and Jimmy were introduced at a Mosque in Harlem.  In transcripts and other sources that I talked to in respect to the drug conspiracy trial, both Abdullah and a West Coast gangster Henry “Black” Butler were the governments star witnesses. How the operation was managed, how the hierarchy was established if you believe the government it was a top-down drug corporation. ​ ​ But, there is another explanation. With some of the sources I spoke with, the crew operated more like a cocaine investment club. Each hustler, staking his claim to parcels or orders of drugs, that were parceled out. Money was grouped together, and there was a lot of freelancing among the so-called players. In the current murder trial, the government again has used both Khalil and Stewart to paint a portrait of mayhem. Funny enough, no one has spoken about any violence in regards to the drug operation, the only violence comes from this feud between G-Unit and Czar Entertainment record labels. So the government is peppering questions about drug dealing, and then Hip-Hop violence. To the jury, the testimony of Khalil Abdullah must have been an alternate reality, one that they probably are not familiar with. Car bombings, shootings, the intimidation of witnesses. The shooting of houses, to the average citizen, must seem like moronic and unnecessary considering at the time, most of these guys - according to their own testimony - were making hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars, traveling to Miami, and LA, and in the case of Jimmy to Europe. If there was violence or shootings, you would make the assumption that at least it would involve retribution in the course of running a drug operation. The proceedings at times take on a surreal bent. Both the prosecution and the defense ask questions, where at times, it seems the definition of what the truth is, has completely gone out the window. For the last two years, I have examined, investigated and talked at length with many of the players, and at times I find myself straining to really figure out where the truth is anymore. I guess the only people who really know the facts are both Khalil and Jimmy, and for everyone else, we will never know. As Khalil Abdullah continued his testimony, the key part of it has to do with a meeting that took place at Mobay Restaurant in Harlem. At this restaurant, Khalil describes an encounter between Jimmy and himself. The restaurant was crowded, so they didn’t eat. Khalil states at this encounter, Jimmy told him about the conspiracy to murder Lowell Fletcher. For this to be believed, you have to ask a few questions. Would Jimmy talk about a murder at a public restaurant? Would he trust Khalil enough to give him this information? Why would he randomly boast about the murder, knowing that at any time, that information could come back to haunt him? On cross-examination, David Touger did a good job asking a very pointed question...if Khalil even remembered the exact date that they met. He did not. He also asked if there were any travel records that Khalil provided the government as he stated that he traveled from Atlanta back to New York City, to take this meeting among others. With Touger’s questioning, the courtroom took on a combative tone at times and comedic also. This is the fourth time Khalil has testified, so by this time he is very comfortable sitting in the chair. He also is very calculating, if not savvy. Touger did rattle him at times, but his arrogance and his annoyance were palpable. In my meeting with Abdullah, it was clear he felt very strongly that he had to become a government witness because, in his words, Jimmy was going to testify against him. So he felt it was a race to proffer and get a better deal. The only problem with that logic, is that is has become glaringly obvious, the government had a vendetta against Jimmy, there would be no time that they would accept Khalil over convicting Jimmy. On redirect, Abdullah was again clear on his story about Mobay, and the implication Jimmy told him what happened. In Abdullah’s testimony, there was also the story on how Jimmy paid the murder crew and that was done not with cash, but the agreement of two kilos of cocaine. If you believe Abdullah, when Jimmy and he went to tally their weekly drug expenses, Jimmy told him to give a kilo of cocaine to the members of the murder crew. Which at that time, on the street would have been worth at least thirty-thousand dollars. Was that the price agreed upon? Would someone murder for a kilo, that they then, in turn, have to sell? If I was a jury member, I would be confused, I have studied this stuff and til to this day, the number of individuals involved, the nicknames, the inside baseball of Hip-Hop violence and feuds, I would be asking a lot of questions and hopefully keeping very detailed notes. The jurors don’t have the luxury of Google or reading transcripts, so the presentation by the government has to be precise and to date, it has not. Khalil was subpoenaed by the government to testify, he did not go willingly to the stand, but not that it mattered. When I met him, he felt that he was done with his obligation, but with the Feds, you are never done, and when you have a cooperation agreement, the heavy hand of the DEA, FBI, or United States Attorney is like a noose around your neck. If you piss them off, they can and will make your life miserable. With the end of the day, came the witness that has not previously testified in any prior proceedings. ​ ​ Jason Williams, Jimmy’s driver, jack of all trades took the stand, and his presence was the polar opposite of what Mohammed Stewart and Khalil Abdullah brought to the courtroom. Both Stewart and Khalil, they were hustlers, they were arrogant at times, they were for all intents and purposes gangsters. When Jason entered the courtroom, his presence was not that. He was meek, reserved, and although he is thirty-five, he came off like a stunted youth. His answers were very non-committal, almost shy and I wonder if that will play differently for the assembled jury. If Touger, does not do an incredible job on cross-examination, I think Williams could be a witness the jury actually believes. Editor This is a saga. Whateva they say he did  he did that lmao ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912201812.2/warc/CC-MAIN-20190318232014-20190319014014-00537.warc.gz
157,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/jimmy-henchman-murder-for-hire-trial-3-murder-crew-member-testifies-qo4grsoj_keaAekFCWg-JA/,"By: Don Sikorski With the start of day two of the trial, news came from the defense that in the 4,000 pages of Facebook posts handed over by the United States Attorney, there is the possibility that those posts contain “Brady Material.” “Brady Material” is any information, reports, records, documents, or anything else held in the possession of the prosecutor that is exculpatory or potentially exculpatory for the defendant. It is called ""Brady Material” after the Supreme Court case that handed down the decision that prosecutors were required to give such material to the defense in Brady v. Maryland. “Brady Material” is requested and required in every case. The material in question is messages and communication on Facebook by Jason Williams, the government’s star witness. Williams worked for Jimmy at Czar Entertainment, and the few times I met him, he was always a quiet, office worker who ran errands. He also was an assistant to Jimmy in the music business. Jason, Jimmy’s driver, was charged with conspiracy to commit murder when the government brought the initial case against Jimmy for the murder of Lowell Fletcher. Jason took a plea deal that put him in jail for twenty years. Williams pleaded guilty to driving the car the night the murder crew shot and killed Fletcher. ​ ​ The government asked him to testify against Jimmy; however, Williams refused to take the stand in the first and second trials. I was informed through confidential sources that the government told Williams if he would now testify against Jimmy, he would not serve anywhere close to twenty years. He would be home with his family in time for Christmas. It is rumored that his possessions had already been shipped to his mother’s house. The government is giving the defense the Facebook posts; however, you have to understand that the federal prison inmates have a robust life on social media. Williams was allowed to send and receive messages, and now, the content of that information is admissible in the Criminal Justice System. The defense has to review all of this information and pinpoint any communication between Jimmy and Jason. They are looking for any “Brady Material” that they can use at the last minute. It is presumed that Jason will be the last witness the government will call to the stand. It seems simple enough; the only obstacle is a race against the clock to read through this material. However, the United States Attorney did not make this process easy. He will not allow the defense to actually possess this discovery information. The mandate for the defense is a lawyer has to read the evidence while he/she is being monitored by a U. S. Attorney in his office. How is this a fair practice? Why is a defendant not allowed to go through the information while he is in jail? Why can’t his legal defense review the material at home or anywhere for that matter? The government’s excuse is pretty standard in these circumstances: They will state that there is personal information and/or pictures in these posts, which they deem confidential. They will present the argument of security of witnesses in order to again run a game of deflection, where the only person who is hurt is the defendant facing a life in jail. The average citizen does not have any idea how long it takes to examine 4,000 pages of information. The government makes it even more difficult because the information is dumped on your lap and out of order. Often, it is presented in a software program, which creates great difficulties in getting access to the information unless you have a computer degree. The timeline is laughable as the examination of the evidence often times is done a few days before the trial or sometimes in just twenty-four hours. Is this fair or just? As day two progressed, the government set the table for the jury. They called Claude Crooks, a security guard from the Bronx, to testify. He stated that he saw a tall, muscular male dressed in all black shoot at Lowell Fletcher. On cross-examination, David Touger, Jimmy’s lawyer, asked Crooks if he saw anyone’s face the night of the murder. Crook replied NO! At this point, the only information presented to the jury is a medical examiner stating that Fletcher died of gunshots wounds. Additionally, a crime scene investigator presented seven shell casings, and a good Samaritan nurse spoke about giving CPR to Fletcher’s body. The government methodically explained the crime scene; however, they did not present how and where Fletcher died. The questions have been tedious. In fact, during a brief break, Judge Kaplan basically admonished the government for their slow pace, and a deluge of information that basically told the jury that Fletcher had indeed been shot and killed. He told the U. S. Attorney, Sam Enser, that the four-hour dissemination of information could have been summarized in ten minutes. In the afternoon session, the government presented one of the key witnesses to their case. He is an individual who has testified in Jimmy’s Drug Kingpin case, as well as two, prior murder trials. He is being given a great opportunity to shape, hone, and communicate the most damaging testimony. ​ Mohammed Stewart or Tef was an associate of Jimmy; he was self-described muscle, who was not afraid to shoot, maim, or intimidate anyone. There is no doubt that Tef was heavy in the streets, and as the government questioned him, he explained that he was the main aggressor in the Hip-Hop feud that started when Jimmy’s thirteen-year-old son was assaulted by members of G-Unit. G-Unit, the record label started by 50 Cent, included Tony Yayo and Lloyd Banks. The government spent some painstaking time walking the jury through this clash of record labels, where Jimmy and his cohorts sought revenge against 50 Cent, Chris Lighty, Tony Yayo, and a street thug named Baja Walters. For a jury member, who has no knowledge of Hip-Hop or the underbelly of the business that ties street beef with music, drugs, and guns, his testimony would sound odd and unfamiliar. Although Teff, through his own volition admitted to acting on his own in firebombing attacks, shootings, and assaults on government officials, he also alleged that he followed Jimmy’s instructions concerning various instances that he carried out. These incidents were interesting because they didn’t actually include the motivation to murder anyone. It seemed as if the whole point was to send a message. There were no intentions to shoot anyone. Scenarios where bulletproof trucks were fired on and the shooting of empty office vestibules were done many times when no one was present. At times, Tef seemed to assume the identity of The Gang who couldn’t shoot straight. Additionally, Tef testified that he was joined by Jimmy or that Jimmy participated in random shootings, such as the one at Tony Yayo’s house. I am sure some of the jurors wondered why these Hip-Hop stars, who were traveling the globe, would risk their prestige by participating in random, gun violence. What the jury may have been surprised to hear is that in a prior drug case, Tef wore a wire for almost a year. He also recorded phone conversations between himself and Jimmy. I had an opportunity to listen to all of these recordings by reviewing the Legal Discovery. During the time that Tef states he was a big-time, drug dealer, sometimes moving more than 100 kilos of drugs, there was not one recording of Jimmy talking about any crimes he had committed. David Touger, on cross-examination, did a good job in pointing out a key fact to the jury. For most of Tef’s life, he has been lying to cops, lawyers, judges, and anyone else involved in the Criminal Justice System. It is no secret that his criminal history and his previous crimes involving gun violence would have put him jail for more than twenty years. His testimony for the government in four trials has allowed him to be a free man. It is rumored that he lives in Atlanta. The phrase, “Jimmy told me to do it “ has been Tef’s get-out-of-jail, free calling card that he has used again and again. In closing, there are big questions to ask. Tef was not involved in any part of the murder of Lowell Fletcher. He was not involved in the conspiracy; however, he did say that Jimmy shared information with him about the shooting of Fletcher. Can the government have it both ways? Can they paint Jimmy as this criminal mastermind, who simply talked about murder plots in everyday conversation? Or is Tef telling the honest truth? The government is using Tef to paint a picture of Jimmy for the jury: Was Tef successful in presenting Jimmy as a drug dealer? Previously, had Jimmy been a part of the violence? Unfortunately, when it comes to proving beyond a reasonable doubt, Tef’s canvas reflects the violence of the world he lived in. Additionally, it is possible that he had some knowledge about the murder of Lowell Fletcher, but he did not give any information concerning a conspiracy. It came out in trial that he would put out a contract on people have the gangsters do the work but wouldn't want to pay up when the work was put in. The same shit puff did that got biggie killed fucking with them rolling 60's out in Cali!   Some of Them young dudes told on jimmy because he wouldn't pay when they did violence for him or bail them out of jail when they was arrested for these acts for him.

Los Angeles, CA. 2010. ALLHIPHOP.COM: How long have you been taking photographs for, and how did you get started?  I got involved in photography during the summer of 2006 through a series of events where I met celebrity jeweler Ben Baller who later introduced me to DJ Skee. At the time Skee co-owned an entertainment public relations company called “Hype PR”. I worked with Skee that summer lending my talents to whatever I could at the time. Throughout my months working with Skee I always carried my camera with me to document my experience at Hype. Everything was new and exciting to me, and I felt that photos would help preserve those moments as keepsakes for me later on. After a couple of months working with Skee he asked me if I could take some new publicity shots for him. I gladly accepted his request and in the end Skee liked the portraits I shot of him. A few weeks later I received a call from Skee asking if I was interested in photographing Game and his team for a new project they were working on together entitled “The Black Wall Street Journal Vol. 1”. Again I took advantage of the opportunity and headed down to his office to meet with Skee and Game. That night I shot with Game, Ya Boy, Juice, Skee and a couple of other guys who were present for the studio session. From that night on I dropped by a couple of more studio sessions with Game and began to build a rapport with him. Once I realized that my photographs had something special to them, I dedicated more time to the craft and learned about the art and business of photography. I started shooting regularly and publishing my work online. Soon after, I started receiving commissioned work from different publications and artists. I then took it a step further and implemented my other talents to my work. I think the one that’s complimented my photography work the most is my graphic design talent. It’s allowed me to express myself fully as an artist when shooting and designing projects. The most recognized projects being Nipsey Hussle’s “The Marathon”, DJ Quik’s “The Book of David” and Schoolboy Q’s “Habits & Contradictions. I think those projects earned me recognition and respect on my art and branding execution. Game sits comfortably at his private estate getting Pharrell’s signature “Star Trak” logo tattooed on his forearm. Glendale, CA. 2010. ALLHIPHOP.COM: What photographers have been your greatest influences and why?  I admire the talents of photographers such as Mario Testino, Helmut Newton, and Gordon Parks to name a few. These guys are true heavy weights in the game, continuously bringing the world visual masterpieces through their personal and editorial work. When it comes to influence, Annie Leibovitz is at the top of my list. Her dedication to her craft throughout the decades and body of work is incomparable. She’s photographed many generations of American history in a way no one else has before. Rightfully so, she was awarded as a “Living Legend” by the Library of Congress. Her portrait work is one of a kind and the growth of her work is amazing. I’m personally a big fan of her photo-reportage work from the 1970s for Rolling Stone Magazine. The height she’s reached professionally and artistically is admirable to say the least. ALLHIPHOP.COM: You've photographed some of hip hops biggest stars. From Kanye west Lil Wayne and Nas, to Rick Ross, Tyler the Creator, Nipsey Hussle, Kendrick Lamar, Game, Black Eye Peas, and I heard even Diddy's talking about you. What do you think has made all that happen?  From the moment I embarked on my journey I took my responsibility as a photographer seriously. I handled it with care and always put my best foot forward to create work I’d be proud of. I think that quality is evident in my photographs. The foundation to my work is the relationships I build with my subjects. This allows us to understand each other and create the most powerful portraits. The artists I work with are usually fans of my work, just as I’m a fan of theirs. That’s always exciting because right off the bat we understand that the images we create together are going to be special. The more we work together, the further the evolution in the work we create together. Diddy’s recognition of my work is really appreciated. He’s someone who’s business acumen and branding genius I’ve admired since I was really young. To know someone you grew up admiring take notice of your work is indicative that you’re doing something right; especially in a world that’s been inundated with photographer hopefuls. When he spoke about my work with Andre Harrell they both understood my vision as I intended it to be understood. Hopefully we can work on something together in the future.

ALLHIPHOP.COM: We see it on movies and hear it in the music all the time but to understand the gang culture of LA you have to be there to experience it. Your work has seen you in some of the most dangerous neighborhoods in the world - and they’re right in your back yard. How has that influenced your work?  Gangs are as much a part of LA culture as Hollywood. For hip-hop culture in LA, this statement is even truer. Our identity and first imprint on the rap game was through the birth of Gangsta Rap with artists and groups such as Ice T and N.W.A. The genre was a direct byproduct of what was going on in LA with gang culture at its height of its existence. This tradition has carried on to the present era. A lot of the artists I shoot come from different neighborhoods around LA. My camera has given me the license and opportunity to document a lot of the gang culture from an insider’s perspective through working with different artists. The way it’s influenced my work is by reinforcing the notion of always telling the truth. There’s nothing more valuable in the world then the truth, unfiltered and raw. That’s probably why a lot of my work is shot photo-reportage style. There’s no setup, it’s just my camera, my senses, and a heightened awareness ready to capture the next moment. ALLHIPHOP.COM: Having worked in these neighborhoods has there ever been a situation where you feared for your life?  Fortunately nothing serious has occurred as of present date. There’s definitely a risk I’m conscious of when I’m in a neighborhood that’s active. The biggest nuisance I usually face is the Police interrupting my shoot in a gang-injunction area. In many instances I’ve found myself hand-cuffed side-by-side with my subjects as Police search through our belongings trying to find an excuse to arrest us. It’s becoming something I take as part of the job now in certain circumstances. ALLHIPHOP.COM: Your work is personal and honest. You have an ability to capture your subject’s personality and environments completely. What goes into planning one of your shoots?  My focus on every portrait shoot is to get something personal from my subject. Before their shoot with me I ask them to be prepared to take me to a couple of different personal landmarks that are significant to them. Somewhere like their favorite hangout or where they go to get inspired. I feel my responsibility, as photographer is to tell the story through my images. I focus as much on context as I do on my subject. There has to be a clear and evident connection between the two. When you allow people to take you where they’re must comfortable at they’ll give you the most genuine representation of who they really are. I don’t give my subjects too much instruction, I let them tell the story and I capture it. The end result is a collection of images that are honest and intimate. ALLHIPHOP.COM: You had your first billboard on Sunset Blvd in 2011 for DJ Quik’s 8th studio album ""The Book of David"" that you worked on. How did it feel seeing that for the first time?  I found out about the billboard through a friend of mine who called me to congratulate me on it. It was a great feeling to drive down Sunset and see my work presented at such a large scale. Being a proud Angelino, it was surreal to see my work that big on a street that is synonymous with my city and globally recognized. It was definitely something I was able to check off my bucket list early on. Since then I’ve done another billboard with Nas. Two legends, two billboards. Not too shabby. My eyes are on Times Square in New York City next. DJ Quik billboard for “The Book of David” sits prominently on the world famous Sunset Strip. West Hollywood, CA. 2011 ALLHIPHOP.COM: Your also write, which makes you a favorite of editors all round. Do u have the same passion for writing as you do photography?  They both hold an important stake in my expression as an artist. I enjoy writing a lot, but the immediacy of photography is incomparable. I feel that I can say things through my photography work that can’t be articulated in words. Ultimately, in the grand scheme of things I think these talents compliment each other in expressing my ideas to the world. Having both these skills in my arsenal of talents empowers me as an artist. ALLHIPHOP.COM: You photographed ""God's Son"" not to long ago. How did that shoot come about and what was it like working with Nas?  That’s correct, I had the privilege of working with the legendary Nas to shoot a billboard for “Salon Ramsey”, a high-end salon in Atlanta. I was commissioned for the shoot without being told who the talent was due to privacy reasons. Once I agreed to do the shoot they revealed his name and I immediately started brainstorming. The shoot was scheduled for a week from the day I agreed to shoot the billboard. Preparation for the project went down to the last minute. Decisions on whether it would be shot in LA or New York, whether we’d use a female in the shoot, and what the concept would be remained the topic of discussion. All while this was being prepared a terrible flu was going around, and as luck would have it I got infected with the flu 2-days prior to the shoot date. Fortunately I sweated it out and when the shoot came around I was at about 50% better, but still ached and pained by spine tingling chills. Nonetheless, I knew the show must go on. My team and I set everything up, had my shot list ready in my head, and I waited for Nas to arrive. Not a minute late, Nas arrived at the East LA studio - were we shot - only to find out that he too had the flu, and to his luck he had just got infected the night before. It was all too fitting that both of us had the flu, I sympathized for him knowing how he probably felt and I assured him that our shoot would be short and sweet. With Marvin Gaye and Frank Sinatra serving as the soundtrack, Nas got his signature cut with a half moon part as we shot the billboard photos on a milky white cyclorama. I posed our females hands with the straight edge and scissors in different positions, and within 30 minutes we had our billboard. “ILLmatic”, indeed. ALLHIPHOP.COM: What has been the greatest moment of your career so far?  I don’t know if I can single out a particular moment just yet. I think it’s been more of a culmination of things that have moved me forward in my craft. I would have to say the journey has been the greatest moment. My camera, talent, and hustle has allowed me to meet a lot of very interesting people from all walks of life. Getting a better understanding of the world through these encounters and experiences has enriched my perspective on things which is something I can’t really put a price tag on. Nipsey Hussle meditates in his car after leaving his last day of probation. Los Angeles, CA. 2011. ALLHIPHOP.COM: You are business partners with LA rapper Nipsey Hussle. How did that come about and what are you guys working on at the moment?  I first heard of Nipsey’s music in 2008 through a good friend of mine who recommended I listen to “Bullets Ain’t Got No Name Vol. 1”. I played the project from beginning to end and was completely taken aback. It was raw, real, and powerful unlike anything out at the time. It was the new soundtrack for the streets of LA. I followed Nipsey’s music from that point on. Shortly thereafter he released Vol. 2, which further solidified his place in the West Coast rap world as an elite artist in the game. I reached out to Nipsey via MySpace in 2009 to see if he’d be interested in working together on some new publicity photos for his album. He invited me to his neighborhood for the “Hussle In The House” video-shoot which marked our first face-to-face meeting. We shot photos in between takes and during the actual filming of the video. We remained in contact after the shoot, and worked together again on the artwork for “Bullets Aint Got No Name Vol. 3.1”. This was our first time working together on album artwork. In 2010 Nipsey extended the olive branch to work together as a team to create classic projects that would set precedence for the rest of the hip-hop world. In that meeting we talked about music, culture, branding, art, and many other things. It was clear from that conversation that we saw eye-to-eye on a lot of different things, and understood our talents complimented each other. Since then we have had huge success collectively and individually do to our “Marathon” campaign that we created. At the moment we’re currently working on the last chapter of the Marathon series which is appropriately titled, “Victory Lap”. This is Nipsey’s best body of work by far. I’m excited for people to experience it. ALLHIPHOP.COM: The Internet is a powerful tool; you've capitalized on it and are set to release your own app and emoji language for the Android and iPhone platforms under your creative company “pLAyground App$”. What is pLAyground and what can we expect from the upcoming releases?  pLAyground is a collaborative art duo which consists of myself and ArcherOne. pLAyground App$ is a subsidiary company of pLAyground dedicated to innovative and fashion-forward app development. The first app we’re releasing is #pLAypix, which is a fun photo overlay app that features some of our characters that will be included in our emoji language. We’ll also be selling exclusive artist sticker packs with Nipsey Hussle, Dom Kennedy, Freddie Gibbs and a couple other artists. My very talented partner ArcherOne is the mastermind behind all the one-of-a-kind illustrations. He’s one those talents that a year from now people will be talking about a lot. I’ll just leave it at that. Following the release of #pLAypix this year, we’ll release the highly-anticipated #pLAygroundemoji language, which will feature over 300 never before seen emoji characters such as Hood Rat, Double Cups, Tacos and much more. I think our slogan best describes what we’re doing and why we do it. “Everybody doesn’t speak the same language. Why should you?” The smiley face of the 1960s will be respectfully buried this year. Make way for the Goon, Hood Rat and House Shoes. Leave your generic emoji icons at the door. Leimert Park’s finest, Dom Kennedy rides his bike to his private studio on a sunny California day. Los Angeles, CA. 2011. ALLHIPHOP.COM: Your work ethic is undeniable from the countless achievements to your name. How does a 25 year old accomplish so much?  I’ve accomplished a lot of great things early on in my career, but my work has merely just begun. What I’ve accomplished to present date are merely stepping-stones to the things I want to accomplish in the future. The things I have been able to accomplish have been through hard work, vision, consistency, and dedication. I think these are principles that are universally understood and valued when referring to the hustle and success. ALLHIPHOP.COM: What are you currently working on?  Currently my time is dedicated to getting pLAyground App$ up and running with our first two offerings for the mobile world, #pLAypix and #pLAygroundemoji. I also have a documentary project that I’ve started working on a couple months ago. I’ll get things in full motion for the documentary once my App Company starts to find its own legs. There are definitely some exciting things over the horizon. ALLHIPHOP.COM: Any exhibitions in the works?  None in the immediate future. I’ve had many proposals recently to do a solo exhibition of my work. I feel it’s too early in my career to really showcase what I have in mind. I want my exhibitions to be comparable to Testino and Leibovitz. They’ve worked hard and long to reach those heights. Once I cross that bridge I know I’ve arrived as an artist. Even then, they’ll still be infinite art to create. Nickerson Gardens Housing Project kids gather around Jay Rock, the local hero who brings hope to the community. Watts, CA. 2008. ALLHIPHOP.COM: I'm going to reverse a question on you that you ask at the end of all your articles. When it's all said and done, how do you want people to remember you?  This is great question. I always ask this in my interviews because I’m a firm believer in legacy over personal fortune. In other words how did your personal success and accolades contribute to the world and people you met or who met you. I’d like people to remember me as someone who was honest, loyal, hard working, and innovative. Most importantly, I want to be remembered as someone who never made any excuses and confronted all his battles with his head up. I really believe you can do whatever you set your mind too. I don’t say that to be cliché. I really believe everyone is endowed with intelligence and talent. It’s just up to us individually to key in on these talents, hone them, and remove ourselves from the fear of failure. I want my work and life to embody that philosophy, and act as a reference point for someone with similar ambitions in the future.

159,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/justice-league-is-enjoyable-despite-flaws-VJI36X8QrE-JuOD7c6xyFA/,"(AllHipHop Features) Let me start this review of ""Justice League"" by saying that I didn't really grow up on D.C. Comics. I was more into reading novels and the encyclopedia to say the least. So, I went into this green. However, the ""Justice League"" is almost a guaranteed win with some of the biggest super heroes in the history of comic culture. The movie directed by Zack Snyder exuded stellar graphics and storyline was great, though the plot was a little predictable. At some points I felt like I was  a character in the game ‘Heavenly Sword’ for Play Station all while learning the history of the worlds that seemed to intertwine into present day realities. It’s almost like D.C. Comics meets The Matrix. A war breaks out between three worlds. Enter Steppenwolf played by Ciarán Hinds who is in search of three boxes which is referenced as “Mother”. Mother is the equivalent of the knife in the “Golden Child” starring Eddie Murphy (I Digress). A force that can either create or break mankind existence in the technological age.    Henry Cavil who plays Superman dies…Batman played by Ben Affleck and Wonder Women  played by Gal Gadot decides to defend his legacy while dealing with a guilt only one knows  if they are into the series, yes the tension and chemistry is that thick.  They enlist the help of Flash played by Ezra Miller, a socially awkward yet sarcastically and quizzically funny kid. He very much knows his powers but is more eager to make friends.  They also recruit Cyborg played by Ray Fisher who once was human and then robotically re-modified due to a severe scientific accident. Cyborg is also a product of  “Mother” and the force that science has become. Aquaman played by Jason Momoa is the heir and current ruler of the Atlantis underground. His macho demeanor gives strength to his already superhuman abilities . Steppenwolf is wreaking havoc with two of the boxes in his possession at this point in search of the third. The Justice league then decide that they are going to bring Clark Kent aka Superman back to life to help fight the war. Well…lets just say they succeed but Superman comes back and it seems like they instantly feel like they made a mistake! If you are looking for something to keep you on the edge of your seat and make you laugh, Justice League delivers. They take you through the underworlds of the Atlantis and a Grecian desert war so dangerous it’s threatening mankind's existence.  Justice League is in theaters nationwide.

This time with a ""Battle Of The Bands” concert featuring K-Ci & JoJo, Dru Hill, Tony Toni Tone, and Next.   ​ (Photo credit: InDaHouseMedia/Jerome Dorn The sold out R&B concert took place at the Fox Theater in Atlanta, Georgia. Whoever thinks R&B doesn’t sell or people don’t still love classic R&B think again! It was a packed house of all ages! Everyone in attendance was on the edge of their seats waiting to see their favorite groups perform. All four groups brought the house down while performing their classic hits, mostly from the golden era of 90s R&B. K-Ci & JoJo performed their hits as a duo as well as their fan-favorite hits as members of the legendary group Jodeci. Dru Hill even joined K-Ci & JoJo on stage to help sing some of Jodeci's biggest songs such as ""Come & Talk To Me"", ""Love You For Life"", ""Freek N U"", ""Feenin'"" and more! Dru Hill ran through their hits such as ""In My Bed,"" ""Beauty"", ""Never Make A Promise"", and ""Tell Me"". ​ Next had fans rocking to their Billboard hits ""Too Close"" and ""Wifey"". It wouldn't be a NEXT show if they didn't perform the oh-so-classic ""Butta Love"" as well. Tony Toni Tone stole hearts with their performance of ""Anniversary"" and ""Whatever You Want."" AllHipHop's Rea Davis had an opportunity to catch up with Jeremy to find out what drives him, and what motivates him to put on such incredible shows. ""The most exciting thing is actually seeing the audience have a great time and a great experience. God made me where it actually does my heart good to see others have a great time. I started off doing parties, and it boils down to seeing people have a great time. I kinda worked my way up and saved my money, and put on my first show. It was Frankie Beverly & Maze, The Whispers, and Tank, in Macon Georgia. Fans can expect just an awesome show with legends from the 90s R&B scene that produced real R&B music, a lot of hits, a lot of love-making, baby-making music that's just classic in our community. Next here we will continue with the Fox Saturday Soul series. We have a show with Lalah Hathaway, Avery Sunshine, Avant, and Jon B. Then I have some things going on back at Wolf Creek on Sept. 30 with Stephanie Mills, El Debarge, and Stokely from Mint Condition.""What I love the most about R&B is there's nothing like R&B to me. It's just that music that comes from the soul, that music that you can listen to with your significant other that brings out emotions in each other. It's that chill music, that grooving music, that love making music.""""I eventually want to dabble into doing some festival type of events maybe in the Caribbean. I'm involved in too many things to list outside of concerts. Concerts started out as a hobby, then it became something I was very good at that became very profitable,"" said JD.

161,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/k-michelle-s-rebellious-soul-music-love-and-fire-ua2Id72g306LhBm7E-TnMQ/," Composed of eleven songs, Rebellious Soul serves as a musical therapy session for K. Michelle. On the album’s first track “My Life,” which features label mate Meek Mill, she aggressively opens up about the struggles she experienced in her past and how that has lead to her adopting a candid persona.  Songs like the piano-driven ballad “I Don’t Like Me” reveals K. Michelle in a depressed state because the guy she cares for desires nothing more than sex from her. She discloses the love she shares for her son on “A Mother’s Prayer,” while on “When I Get A Man” she expresses all the intimate things she’ll provide to the next guy who captures her heart.  K. Michelle talked about her new album, if she’s worried about ""Love and Hip Hop: Atlanta"" tarnishing her image as an artist, and why she enjoys using music as a form of therapy. AllHipHop: A variety of emotions can be heard on Rebellious Soul: from feeling happy to sad to sexy or just fed up about the way things are going. Is it safe to say that you live through your music?  K. Michelle: I absolutely write about my life. I don’t want to do it if it’s not about my life. I don’t feel like it’s genuine singing about other things. I like to convey what I’m going through.  What was the best part about creating this album to you?  Getting in there and using it as therapy. The album process was very simple for me. It was just genuine and true to me. Do you have a favorite song on the album?  My favorite song on the album would be “Sometimes.” The reason “Sometimes” is my favorite song is because it has like an Etta James-type of feel. It’s a very old soul type of feel. I absolutely love that song. In your music, you not only touch on your experiences, but you use that as a way to provide a sense of wisdom to listeners. Where does the desire come from to do that?  If God gives you a gift, you have to use it in a great way. You can’t just go around and do what you want to do. That gift was given to you to help people, and that’s exactly what I do. What were some things that inspired you when you created Rebellious Soul?  Whatever I was feeling at that time, I wanted to write about it. That’s where the inspiration for the album came.Similar to the cover art for your mixtapes, 0 F*cks Given and Signed, Sealed, Delivered, the cover art for Rebellious Soul is relatively provocative. What made you go with that cover art for your debut album?  It’s really not even provocative. It’s me in a dress. I wanted it to have a very dark feel, so that’s why it’s the red and the black. It’s very sexy. That’s the feel I wanted it to have. You’re largely known for your appearances on ""Love and Hip Hop: Atlanta,"" and your outspoken personality. Do you think being seen in that light hurts your image as an artist? Or do you think it potentially makes it that much more unique?  Yeah, [I think it makes it more unique], because I tell [listeners] who I am. A lot of artists are fake. They put on this persona, and it’s not relatable. We all get angry. We all have issues. We all are happy and sad and when someone is relatable, you want to see them win and you can relate more to what they’re singing about. Looking forward, what are your plans as far as music and television goes?  We’re about to go on tour. This single hasn’t even reached its peak yet. It’s in the Top 20. We’re going to aim for Number 1 with the single. I have two more singles off this album. It’s all music for me. Is there anything you would like to tell your fans?  Thank you. This has been amazing for me and it could not happen without their support. Everybody has been supporting me and has made this an amazing process for me.

After a period of answering phones for the station, Brandi  earned her way back on the air and runs the station’s popular “Tweet at  12” segment where listeners tweet their requests in via Twitter and get  an on-air shout out when their song is played.  In the midst of listener  call-ins, prize giveaways and classic old school Hip-Hop, Brandi took  the time to answer a few questions about her life as a radio DJ/Host,  including the infamous Houston firing in 2010 over an artist banned by  the station. How long have you been involved in radio? I started as an intern when I was 15. 15? Isn’t that kind of young to be an intern?  In Florida they have an Externship program for gifted students which  allows you to be one. I was a nerd (laughs). I started at a classic Rock  station working behind the scenes. Growing up, I was the little kid  that always called in to a station requesting favorite songs. I used to try calling in myself but I could never get through to the stations.  I would get through but I also sat there and tried calling in for a  long time. I was an annoying little kid. My sisters are prize hogs. To  this day they call in to stations and win iPads, money and other prizes. When did you start your DJ journey? I started hosting a mix show when I was at radio station. The DJ’s  would be next to me while I was on the microphone but I had no clue how  to do it. This was during my time in college at Florida State University  and I thought DJ’ing was the coolest thing but I never saw any female  DJ’s at the station – only male ones. I decided that I wanted to learn  because there weren’t any female DJ’s in my area. You see Female DJ’s in  New York and on the West Coast but at the time there weren’t any in my  area of Florida. I asked the guys to show me how to DJ and they told me  that I first had to buy my own set of turntables because they wanted to  see if I was serious. I went and maxed out two of my credit cards much  to my mother’s dismay. Did you even know what you were buying? They told me to buy 1200 Technic Turntables. They said that if I was  serious, I should get those instead of the starter DJ turntables. The  starters are a waste of your time. If you’re for real about this, you  need to get the right equipment.  My friends taught me what to do from  there. How bad were you as a DJ when you started? I sucked horribly bad. I was working for this one station and I don’t  know why I thought I was slick but one time during an overnight shift I  decided to start mixing on the radio. My job was only to talk on air at  that point. Someone from the station heard me and he called me from  wherever he was and said, “What the hell are you doing? I’m going to say  two things to you. You suck real badly and you’re train-wrecking all  over the place but you’ve got balls to actually try to pull this off and  I respect that. I’m going to get off this phone and not say anything  about this.” What time in the night was this? This was at 3 am. He must have been coming home from a club or  something. He said it was terrible but he respected the fact that I  really wanted to try it that bad. What in the hell got in to you? I don’t know! I was crazy as a kid. Looking back I guess I just  didn’t realize what big of a deal it was. I know that if someone were to  ever try to do that out here in Los Angeles, all hell would break  loose, but this was Tallahassee. I just didn’t think it was a serious  deal. It was fun although I was bad and train-wrecked everywhere.  Everybody has to start somewhere. I sucked at radio and DJ’ing but I  wanted it so bad. You sound like a natural when I listen to you talk on air and when you’re spinning records.  It’s all practice, practice and more practice. After all of these  years, I still sit in my car and do fake mic breaks just to practice.  That was one of my techniques when I first started. One of my co-workers  advised me to start practicing in the car. Practice on controlling your  voice and the way that you want to talk. My radio voice is distinctly  different than when I’m normally speaking. The first time that I told my  boss that I wanted to speak on the air, he laughed in my face and told  me that I sounded too white. I took it as a personal challenge to sound  the way that would get me on the radio. I went overboard at first and  that was kind of interesting but it all balanced out. I finally found  the voice that I wanted.  It helps to also write down your mic breaks. I  did that for a number of years and sometimes I write key reminders. Have you had any other big on air mess ups? I’ve cussed on air before and that’s why we have those dump buttons.  Back in Houston, I had an overnight mix show called “Brandi Garcia &  the Hollywood Boys.” One night I was reading a reported story on  Beyonce’ and Jay Z vacationing in St. Tropez. I don’t travel overseas so  I read the name of the town as its spelled (with the Z pronounced) and  they paused the music and said ”Where?”  I pronounced it with the Z  again and said it real country-like. That was very embarrassing. That’s like the “Versace” moment in that “Showgirls” movie. Exactly like that. Oh my God. Tell me about cursing on the air.  Sometimes you can get so comfortable in a moment that you forget that you’re on the radio and it comes out. What’s the worst thing that you’ve said? I’ve said “sh*t.” I don’t think I’ve ever said the F-word. We have a  dump button and with a 10 second delay, you can catch it. There hasn’t  been anything too crazy. I’ve always been chill. Let’s talk about your controversial firing from Houston’s  97.9 The Box. Trae the Truth was banned by the station and you were let  go because you played a song that featured him at a non-station event.  It was a Waka Flocka song, “O Let’s Do It” and Trae recorded a verse  over it. According to the station, it was a station event but I don’t  consider it one. The event was promoted on several other stations too. I  was not there representing the station. I was representing myself and  it was on my day off. Looking back on it, I think they felt that I was  siding with Trae over the station. I was devastated. I really loved that  station and I loved the people in that city. Knowing that Trae was on that remix, did you feel any reservation at all about playing it? I wasn’t even paying attention – that’s the funny part. I was just  playing songs. I wasn’t trying to purposely play a Trae record to be a  martyr or make a statement. I was shocked when I walked in that Monday  after and got fired. Why would I try to lose my job? Everything happens  for a reason and I wish them all the best. I’ve had the opportunity to  come out to Los Angeles and be successful here at 93.5 KDAY. I’m  thankful for the time that I was at The Box in Houston and I can say  that now because I’m not angry anymore. I bet there was a time where you couldn’t say that. Absolutely but I’ve come to a place of closure and there are more  important things in life. I’ve changed my mindset since then and I try  to look at the positive things in life. Had that firing not happened, I  wouldn’t be in Los Angeles doing all of the things I’m doing. It  happened for the greater good in my life and I’m cool with it. You run like 20 miles a day with your running crew all around  the city. Your Instagram is poppin’ with all of your running photos.  I ran cross country for Florida State. My time in Houston was the  least active I’ve ever been in my life and I started to get a little  overweight. I love to run and I love Sports. Music and Sports are my  equal loves. I had one without the other for so long and I missed. When I  came out to Los Angeles, I rediscovered my love for running and I’ve  been great at balancing the two ever since. I just started my own run  crew called WeRunLA. We go out on Wednesday nights and run in different  parts of the city each week. I accept anybody in the crew. My whole  mission is to get people that feel intimidated by run crews and to make  it a fun experience. In Hip-Hop it’s not necessarily cool but in the  past few years we’ve seen more fitness awareness. It’s good to see Paul  Wall’s and Slim Thug’s transformation. I see pictures of Bun-B working  out with his wife. It’s good to see music and fitness come together.

163,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/kidz-in-the-hall-celebrate-a-very-special-occasion-HdhK2_KPYEqTtkmJwEnWVQ/," In Naledge and O's eyes, making music isn't always about trying to top what you did the last time around, it's about creating a unique sound that is fresh, maturing, and overall, feel-good. With the release of Occasion, they successfully managed to do all of the above, yet still provide fans and listeners alike with something truly worthy of being a Kidz in the Hall album.  AllHipHop.com spoke to both of the Kidz before the release of Occasion and got the guys to talk about the creation and recording process of the album, what is was like working with artists like Bun B and David Banner, their personal highlights from Occasion, the loss of Heavy D, who needs to buy this album, and much more: AllHipHop.com: First off, I want to congratulate both of you guys on the release of Occasion, which is going to be your third album with Duck Down Records. What about your business relationship with Duck Down works so well for you guys and allows you to create the music that you want to? Double-O: I think they just let us make the music that we want to make. We’ve never had to compromise ourselves at all and they’ve never asked us too. AllHipHop.com: Last week, a few of us actually came to visit your video shoot in Brooklyn for “Pour It Up” with Bun B and David Banner. Can you guys explain the robbery concept we witnessed? Kidz In The Hall: (Laughing) Double-O: It’s about someone listening to my f*cking idea, that’s what happened. It’s basically like our version of Clerks, if you’re familiar with the original Clerks. You know that mundane kind of job but with that Kidz twist on it and some crazy sh*t goes down. AllHipHop.com: Is there a specific reason why you guys chose to shoot the video in New York as opposed to your hometown of Chicago? Double-O: We go to Europe on Monday, so it made more sense for Naledge to come here, cause I was already here, and then go off to Europe from New York, cause that’s where we’re leaving from. So really it was just a logistical thing. AllHipHop.com: And what are you guys about to be doing in Europe? Double-O: Shooting the second season of our reality show. AllHipHop.com: Can’t wait to see that! We did get to speak to Bun B at the video shoot, and he was talking about the song being an homage to Pimp C. What can you guys tell me about your relationship with Bun, and how did you all link up for “Pour It Up”? Naledge: Bun made a concerted effort as somebody who is more of a pioneer in the game to reach out to younger artists who are doing their thing and really make relationships with us and really network, and it’s crazy cause when you see someone who has accomplished so much and be willing to really put in their own groundwork. In our eyes, he’s giving us a blueprint. Bun is like family man, he’s like your uncle and lets you know in a cool way what’s going on; if you’re doing something right or you’re doing something wrong. He’s somebody who’s been there and done that and will always lend a hand and lend an ear. It’s just one of those things. AllHipHop.com: So if Bun B is your uncle, what would that make David Banner? Naledge: He’s like the crazy cousin. He’s the nicest dude you’ll ever meet, until you get on his bad side [laughter]. AllHipHop.com: I hear that. When do you plan on releasing the visual for “Pour It Up”? Double-O: Whenever it gets done. I know that there’s going to be a little bit of a delay, but hopefully not too much. AllHipHop.com: I’m not sure if it was two or three weeks ago, but you guys did something very creative and unique for your album listening session’s where you had party buses pick up passengers around the city to hear the album, party, and kick it with you guys. Whose idea was that, and overall, how did the experience go? Double-O: Logistically, it’s always been about getting it to work, but we had actually been throwing that idea around from the time we had our first meeting with Duck Down back in 2007. So it was really just one of those things where this was the right time. There’s a very certain idea that we wanted to convey with the party bus. AllHipHop.com: Well I think it was pretty genius to approach the listening like that and from what I’ve heard of the album, it certainly sounds like some of, if not your, best work to date, and definitely has a more up-beat sound to it. Would you agree or disagree? Double-O: I mean, we always like what we just did, you know. We always like that newest thing that we made. So for a record like Occasion, that most people haven’t heard, and we’re like “this is the greatest sh*t ever!” I think that we try to improve with every album whether people think we need to or not. Sometimes, people get introduced to us in a variety of ways. There’s people who say that Attention is the best thing we’ve ever did and that was a mixtape that we put out such a long time ago but then, you know, there’s some people that really love School Was My Hustle and then there’s some people that love The In Crowd, and some who love Land of Make Believe. So we are always just trying to do something that is better than what we did last time but hopefully gain new fans also, and I think that’s what we’re doing. Naledge: I think it’s one of those things where, at least me being the MC, I’m just talking about what’s going on in my life and I’m telling people where I’m at in my life. So some of out older material, it was like an older time, so I don’t really look back and I realized that somebody might be a fan of something that I don’t feel like making right now, so it’s like that’s cool, but there’s fans for what we’re doing right now, and right now everything is more me. It’s more of a place where I don’t feel like I have to prove certain things that I felt like I had to prove on our first couple of albums. I’m more interested in song structure than I ever was. I’m less interested in trying to prove to somebody that I’m dope. I know I’m dope. I don’t need to give you the most intricate rhyme pattern anymore to let you know that I’m dope. I play around with cadences more and I find nuances playing with the English language and playing with melodies, and just trying to create a feeling, and I think that’s what this album is about. It’s creating a feeling of an occasion and that’s how it came together. AllHipHop.com: What was the actual process like? Naledge: We went to L.A., we rented a house, and we made music that felt good to us with no qualms. We weren’t reading no blogs, we wasn’t checking no websites, wasn’t listening to nobody else’s stuff in the Rap world, and just made what we fell like making, and this is the result. That’s what I love about this album is that it wasn’t contaminated by what’s going on on the radio, or BET, or MTV Jams, or none of that, so I love this record. I think it’s our best work. I think it’s our most palatable album period. I think it stands up to anything we’ve done before. AllHipHop.com: Is it safe to say that you guys are less concerned with trying to top yourselves and the work you’ve done in the past and more focused on just creating the best music you can possibly make right now? Double-O: Yeah, I mean, I think that’s definitely it. We just kind of realized, that with this reality show and the other branding opportunities that we’ve been getting, we can make new fans everyday and just be appreciative of the fact that we can do this for a living and just vibe off of that and make everything an “occasion.” AllHipHop.com: So what is so significant about the album title, Occasion and the cover art as well? Double-O: I mean honestly, like, calling the album Occasion, it was a little bit of a marketing thing because it was kind of like, we had a song called “Occasion,” that we felt a lot of what the album is, is really based around and we knew that it was one of those important records that we really wanted to push. You know, it’s really me that gets caught up in it sometimes I try to be a little too subversive, where there’s like a billion different layers. Like people were like “Land of Make Believe has all these different meanings,” and it’s supposed to be meaningful and all that and with Occasion its just an occasion. The song, the vibe, everything, is very simple but on the flip side, I got to be a little subversive with the artwork, I mean the artwork is essentially confetti falling. It was just a really dope picture that I found. One of the photographers we work with a lot in Chicago, he had it on his website and I was just like “this is what it needs to be. This picture represents everything about the celebration of this type of album. The occasion.” That’s really how the title and art came to be. AllHipHop.com: That’s awesome. As far as the actual recording process, I know you guys said earlier that you got the house in L.A. and were recording there. You’ve got a wide list of eclectic features on Occasion, did any of the artists actually come to the house with you guys and record? Double-O: I mean, some of them were around. Some songs were done a little earlier then when we were in L.A. You know, we had a lot of ideas prior to recording and we were just fleshing them all out and so what ends up happening is, you can listen to a song a billion times, but before you can complete it, you’re like “aw, this is who I need on it!” Or even saying, “this is what I need to make this song complete.” There were a lot of those kind of brainstorming sessions that we had alongside the demos that we had done that led to a lot of the features. AllHipHop.com: Looking back, is there anything that sticks out as a crazy moment during the making of the album? Naledge: We had a lot of hoes around man during the making of this album. The album talks about the life or a real person that gets hoes. Not like, “I’m a player or I’m out here pimping, etc. I go to the club, I walk right in and I got like 80 girls.” No, man, not at all. I fight with women, argue with them, but at the same time, I love women and I talk to them and have meaningful conversations with them; I invite them to the studio. I drink with them and sometimes they smoke me out, I smoke weed with them. That’s really what this is about; it’s an occasion! It’s not an occasion if bad women - bad meaning good - if you don’t have great women around the environment than you can’t create that type of music. It might be a laughing moment or a laughing matter, but it’s the truth. I don’t know any heterosexual dudes that can hang out and have a great time with music without women involved. That’s just real. AllHipHop.com: So for someone who goes out and picks up a copy or two of the album, where would you say is the perfect place or environment to hear the album? Naledge: Anywhere that bad b*tches reside at. You know what I’m saying? Double-O: [laughter] Naledge: Car, strip club, party. You could be at your job right now and a bad b*tch could be at a cubicle next to you, and you might just be playing our song and that might get you in the mood to go rap to it like “let’s go hit this happy hour real quick.” (laughs) That’s who we are. That’s who Kidz In the Hall are. We understand that nine to five, office mentality. We’re those guys, who although we were pegged to be that if you look at our resume, we took it and made it to rap music. So I still hang out with people that graduated college and work that nine to five, but I’m like the coolest motherf*cker to them. We have always been – when people go right, Kidz In the Hall go left – so the music reflects that; it’s a fun time and we’re fun people and we found a way to mesh our wittiness and tongue-in-cheek humor into having fun and also attacking real issues. Did I mention that bad b*tches should buy the album? AllHipHop.com: At least twice [laughter]. Naledge: For real. Attention all bad b*tches, buy Kidz in the Hall’s album. We are the leaders of the bad b*tch movement! Double-O: (Laughs). AllHipHop.com: Do each of you guys individually have a song on Occasion that is a personal favorite? Double-O: For me, I love the way the whole album kind of rocks. I think what we did with this album was rather than try to tell a story or connect dots, we just picked our 14 favorite records and just put it on there. AllHipHop.com: Ok. Double-O: So I think that kind of like, this is the best of our life, right now. I think that’s why it maintains a certain amount of energy throughout the whole thing cause we just did the reverse of what people kind of tell you to do. AllHipHop.com: Naledge? Naledge: “Pour It Up” to me is the jewel of the album, only because, like, the way it came together, not necessarily because of Bun being on it or because of David Banner being on it, it celebrates the life of legends that passed away, but in a way that’s a little bit different. I was talking to Bun about the fact that down South, when people pass, you don’t get sad, people have a party for them, so that’s kind of what the idea of pouring out a little liquor for the homie or pour it up and toasting to the homie. That’s what we’re doing is toasting to the homies that we lost and toasting to the legends that we lost and we found a way to integrate that into a lifestyle. If they were alive, they’d be in the club and pouring it up and having fun. That was the energy that they exuded when they were here. So Pimp C, Biggie, and Tupac were the three legends that came to mind immediately but I really wanted to shed light on the memory of Chad Butler, specifically because I feel that Pimp C, you know, everything aside, the large character that he had, like he was a very, very talented individual. AllHipHop.com: Absolutely. Naledge: It just permeated really deeply in the Rap industry and I think it largely went unnoticed when he was alive. AllHipHop.com: Well, even more recently the world lost Heavy D, and it is just amazing to see how iconic these people were and the legacies that they leave for people to hold onto for years and years after they pass away. Double-O: It’s unfortunate and this goes even outside of Rap, I mean, we don’t celebrate people, unfortunately, until they’re gone a lot of the times because we’re forced to reflect on how important they really were in our life or just in the world. So with Heavy D, it’s just crazy. It’s wild sometimes how you can just go to sleep and wake up the next morning and look on Twitter and you find out somebody is gone. And the way that we look at death now, I think is about to evolve in such a wild way over the next couple of years. AllHipHop.com: How so? Double-O: You have kids growing up in an era where if someone passes away, there’s still a digital footprint of them. How many people were retweeting Heavy D’s last tweets you know? It’s a wild thing and just a very interesting concept of what death is nowadays. AllHipHop.com: That’s very true. Just to finish up, looking ahead to next year, what do you guys have planned and in store for the fans and the industry in general? Double-O: We’re definitely going to be working on solo stuff. There’s going to be the second season of the reality show and I think that with that, we’re going to have some new music. It’s funny too cause originally Occasion was going to be an EP and then it turned to an album, which seems to always happen, so I can say right now that I know we have a couple of songs that we’re going to attach to the show’s new season. Whether or not it will be an album, I don’t know, but it could be. AllHipHop.com: Looking forward to hearing the new stuff, and congratulations again on the album’s release.

166,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/knockout-nation-foe-of-lucian-bute-and-friend-of-50-cent-AFeKEbZNjEeymFu6n3WZAw/," The fighter Jean Pascal faces Saturday night (January 18) is Lucian Bute, and it’s a “superfight” that marks a return to elite competition for both men. While the fight has drawn much attention in Montreal with over 20,000 paid fans, questions remain regarding if these two men still have the ability, and more importantly, the mindset, to deliver world-class performances.  In this exclusive interview with Knockout Nation, Jean Pascal answers the criticism about being a “four-round fighter, why he’ll defeat Bute, and how the Hopkins fights made him a better fighter. Knockout Nation: This is a significant fight for Canada and the light-heavyweight division overall. How did you adjust your training for it? Jean Pascal: I basically approached this fight as it’s the biggest of my life and career. This fight is Canada’s Pacquiao-Mayweather. I know Bute will be well-prepared but so am I. I went all the way to Big Bear [California] to get away from any distractions to remain focused. One thing that people don’t understand is that you win the fight at training camp, not press conferences. When I train good, no one should beat me. Knockout Nation: It’s interesting you bring that up about focus because the knock on you is that you are, as Hopkins coined, a four-round fighter that lacks stamina and focus. Do you feel this camp has completely eradicated those bad habits? Pascal: Well, people make me laugh. The only fight that I faded was against Bernard Hopkins in the first fight. The reason was because I didn’t have the proper training. I trained hard, but sometimes hard is not enough. You need the good work.  If you look at my second fight with Bernard, I finished strong and stunned him in the 12th round. Even though the judges gave him the 12th, I don’t know how or why, but he was stung if you look at the fight. With Dawson, exploding the last minute was a tactic. I told myself I’ll let Dawson punch himself out the first two minutes of the round and then I’m gonna come on strong every round until I knock him out. If he’s still around in the 12th, I’m gonna go all out for the KO. That was a technical approach for me.  Saying I fade or only fight for a minute every round is not true. People think just because it’s a big rush for a minute I’m not doing anything else. I’m boxing the entire round. I am an accomplished fighter that knows what he’s doing. Knockout Nation: You’ve had a year-plus layoff before. However, you had the luxury of coming back against a lower-level tune-up opponent. Bute is jumping right back into the elite level. Knowing what you went through, how rusty and gun-shy do you expect him to be early on? Pascal: Honestly, it’s hard to say. It’s all about confidence – if we see a lack of it like in the Grachev fight, he’s going to be in a lot of trouble. Boxing is 75% mental and 25% physical. I don’t think it’s going to be a war because I don’t think Bute wants that. I think it will be a chess game. But if he wants to brawl, I’ll be ready for a war. Knockout Nation: I noticed you were ringside at the Dawson fight with 50 Cent. Any plans for you guys to do business in the future, boxing or otherwise? Pascal:  Who knows? 50’s a friend of mine but we really don’t talk too much about boxing business. He’s a cool dude to hang around. He very gentle, simple and down earth – that’s what I like about him. We may do business in the future. Go to KnockoutNation.com for more.

167,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/knockout-nation-lil-bear-lawson-makes-it-to-mma-BeAeeiXgnE-PpDzdOmJeCA/,"Knockout Nation: Tell me about the new situation? Holly “Lil Bear” Lawson: Bellator signed me to their featherweight division. I'm the 5th woman they've signed, the only one with no [MMA] fight experience. I'm super excited to be fighting for Bellator, especially under Scott Coker, he did a great job with Strikeforce and has a proven history with building fighters, particularly women. He was the first major MMA promoter to see the value in female fighters and their audiences. You came from boxing so you are not exactly new to this. What made you switch and how hard has the transition been?  I love boxing and my life's goal had always been to become a world champion. Unfortunately the boxing world - American promoters particularly - don't see women as marketable and not only are we paid a fraction of what men make, we have to deal with the ""major"" promoters basically having blackballed women from fighting on their cards. I trained for years with MMA fighters at Wildcard and they were always trying to ""convert"" me. I finally thought, “What the hell I might as well go see if I like it, if I have the capacity to learn and if it's something I am interested in.” Fortunately I was introduced to Antonio McKee and his team at The Bodyshop and they took me under their wing and have been fundamental in me growing into the fighter I'd like to become. MMA grows on me every day! I never thought I'd enjoy grappling as much as I do. It helps to be surrounded by world champions, men who I respect as people not just as fighters Do you catch flack from people in the game that feel you are just riding the MMA wave?  A little.... But MMA is so much more accepting of female fighters and our space in that world. Generally everyone has been really excited about me entering the sport. I've made it a point to try and be low key about it. I learned on boxing not to count my chickens before they hatch so I've waited until now that I have a fight lined up until I wanted to come out and tell everyone what I'm doing. What advantages will your boxing background have for you? Is there a downside?  I’m not going into the sport thinking I have any advantages, I feel like that's an easy way to get caught up in overconfidence, but I do know that my grappling is what I work on daily. You can never know everything, just like boxing - it's a constant evolution. You have a fight coming up. Tell me about it.  I'm fighting in Iowa Oct 17, I literally just found out about it less than 48 hours ago so I'm still getting all the information, but so far the date and the opponent have been confirmed. Who are you fighting?  Jozette Cotton. I’m fighting on Friday, October 17th from the Mid-American Center in Council Bluffs, Iowa. Sorry, Bellator guy just sent me that. (Laughs) I'm the first female fight to be happening for Bellator under Scott Coker! Which is huge. Final words?  I'm humbled and honored to be fighting for what I consider to be the best mma promotion on the planet and I'm looking forward to bringing something different to the women's MMA world.

Homeless at the early age of 6, Anthony and his older brother (by two years) Lamont found themselves on the streets of D.C. after no longer being able to endure a chaotic home life. They were 2 of 12 other siblings whose father battled drug use and went to jail, and their mother abused alcohol. While hanging around a boxing gym, now 8-year old, Anthony was discovered and trained by now father figure, Barry Hunter who took both brothers in and have been with them since. Despite the rough childhood, Anthony says it taught him the importance of waiting his turn and being patient. One glimpse at his career and you could understand why those attributes are so important to the 33-year old pugilist. Despite having only one loss in 38-fights, Anthony have yet to compete for a world-title; a fortune he hopes to change this year. First things first though, Peterson is up against former world-champion, Argenis Mendez on March 24th on FS1 at the MGM National Harbor in Maryland. Peterson-Mendez will serve as the co-main event to Anthony’s older brother Lamont’s bout against, Sergey Lipinets. I had a chance to speak with the 38-fight vet to discuss his extended layoff, regaining his spot, Argenis Mendez fight and future move up to welterweight. AllHipHop: How are you doing? Anthony Peterson: I’m talking to you again, so at least I’m headed in the right direction. AllHipHop: It’s always a pleasure. It’s been a long time coming, March 24th, a win over Argenis Mendez could put you in a good place in terms of a potential world-title shot. Despite the layoffs, injuries and fights falling out, is that essentially what keeps you motivated? Anthony Peterson: It’s certain things that I had to go through in my life as a youngster that I draw back to that keeps me in that state of mind. We had to wait to get on the list to be placed in a shelter, we had to wait to be on the list for foster care and just to be homeless we had to wait. We had to wait for bad things, so why would I not wait for good things you know what I’m saying. If you truly love what you do, and you love your craft… of course I’m human. I had my down ends with it. I’m seeing guys fighting for championships in the welterweight and the junior welterweight division and the super welterweight division that I knocked around in sparring sessions. I know I see a lot of great guys coming through, I see a lot of guys winning, but I can’t let that get to me to the point where I’m like, “Man, forget boxing. I’m going to do something else.” It’s something in me, that I just explained to you that makes me patient. What else can I do? AllHipHop: For sure. Does that mentality have to carry over to the ring for you in order not to have a letdown? Anthony Peterson: Yes, for sure. Note that I’m not a tough guy. This is a way of life. There are people out here going through way worse things that I could ever imagine. We just talking about going in a square ring and doing something that I have been doing since I was nine against somebody. To me it’s not that big of a deal. AllHipHop: What do you see when you watch, Argenis Mendez? Anthony Peterson: I watched him last year and no disrespect to him, I haven’t watched him. Once they told me that the fight was on, I didn’t really have to watch him. Once the Mickey Bey fight had fell out, I was supposed to fight, Mendez. I studied him a little bit and then that fight fell out. So, I already had him on the radar. I know what he can bring, I know what he’s going to do, and I just prepared myself for a little less than a month from now, to do what I do best and that’s win. AllHipHop: You have been fighting, but it’s been off the radar, to come back, co-main event to your brother at home, I’m sure that is a big deal for you. Anthony Peterson: It’ a great feeling, but it’s not enough. I’m appreciative for everything that comes my way, but if you could recall, May 25th, 2007, I headlined on ESPN while Floyd Mayweather and everybody was in the house. That was the best performance that I ever had, I believe. It was against a rugged southpaw Dominican fighter named Ernesto. He was real rough and I stopped him late. I have been headlining since day one I just haven’t been given the opportunity lately to display my talents in a main event slot. I’m going to work my way up and do whatever I gotta do to get that spot back.  AllHipHop: Mendez does have some slick counter punchers and he is a rhythm guy. What do you have to do to break that rhythm and not let him get in his groove? Anthony Peterson: Just keep a good consistent jab all night, good footwork, movement, rhythm, style and reflexes gotta be on point. I know a lot of people feel like I’ve been out of the ring for a while, but I’ve been in there with guys; Lamont Peterson, Shawn Porter, Jarrett Hurd, Austin Trout. Any names that you can name that’s out here right now, I’ve been in there with them. I know what time it is. It’s a fight and I’m just ready to do my thing. That’s all I can say. AllHipHop: Do you feel like we still haven’t seen the best version of, Anthony Peterson? Anthony Peterson: For sure. And then the styles. You gotta have a good dancing partner. I truly believe that, Mendez is the perfect dancing partner. He’s not awkward. He’s not a person that shy’s away from contact. I don’t gotta look for him, he’s going to be there. The only thing I saw when I watched him, like you said is the counter punching. He has a counter left hook and an overhand that comes. I have been in there with guys that counter, I have been in there with guys who are strong; the whole nine. It’s nothing that I have never seen before. AllHipHop: You were at 135-pounds for a long time. How has your body acclimated to being at 140? Anthony Peterson: Actually, welterweight going to be soon. This summer I got up to the biggest I have ever been. Not fat, but it was muscle. I’m a big fan of my body. My body… I have been knowing my body since 1985. I know the end and outs like my thighs, my hamstrings, my shins and my neck is growing. I know I can’t make lightweight. That’s out. AllHipHop.com: Even if 140 is a pass-through division for you, there is some great competition there. What do you see when you look around the division in terms of talent? Anthony Peterson: I can’t really pronounce the guy name, but I like him a lot. He’s a southpaw. AllHipHop.com: Regis Prograis. Anthony Peterson: Yes-yes! I like his style. He’s a dog in there, he seems to have a good ring IQ and good hand speed. But there is something about him, like Mikey Garcia is looking at Spence, there is something I see in him that I know my style will definitely beat him. I can’t really nail it down, but trust me, if we were to sit down in front of a television, I’ll show you. And I’m pretty sure he would say the same thing about me. It’s business. AllHipHop: What can we expect on March 24th from you? Anthony Peterson: The basics. In my time off I was teaching boxing. It’s crazy because now I’m looking at it from a coach point of view now. It’s like I’m a coach and a fighter at the same time. He basics. People get away from the jab. The jab is the heartbeat of a fight. It’s the most underrated punch, it’s the hardest punch to stay disciplined by and it’s the most important punch in boxing. As we are having this conversation right now, I’m looking over at the MGM and watching that. I can’t wait. AllHipHop: How do you not let the pressure of fighting on the same card bother you? Anthony Peterson: We’ve done it before. January 5th of 2007 we fought on ESPN together, January 4th of 2008 we fought on a card together and like I said May 25th of 2007. We fought on cards a lot in Biloxi, Mississippi. We know what time it is. It ain’t nothing personal it’s business. We know what can happen stepping in that ring and we understand on both ends. We keep our faith in the work that we put in and understand that we come a long way, but we got so far to go. There is nobody that’s going to stand in our way and stop what we got going on. We believe in our talent and our skills that God gave us. AllHipHop: I look forward to seeing you back in there, good luck and we will speak afterwards. Is there anything else you want to add? Anthony Peterson: Like I have said in every interview since September 25th of 2004 when I made my pro debut, keep God first and anything is possible.

169,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/kur-the-next-great-philly-rapper-ofwE8fibXkOfIRsDkmzgmA/,"(AllHipHop Features) When considering up and coming MC’s that are primed to make in an impact in the rap game, without question, Kur should among the top names of every list. The Philadelphia native has been making major moves since he first burst on the scene. After getting the ultimate co-sign from Meek Mill, Kur released a slew of highly regarded tracks and mixtapes including a collaborative project with Harlem MC Dave East. With standout cuts like “33 Shots,"" ""Lion Hearted"" and ""I Don't Give A F**k,” and his latest “Crack,” Kur is poised to take the rap game by storm with his street narratives, raw honesty, and rapid-fire delivery. I sat down with Kur to talk about his upcoming project entitled Shakur, growing in Philly (Uptop), his creative process as an MC, and why he feels it’s important to stay grinding in the game. AllHipHop: The Philly Hip-Hop scene has always been diverse, and it has a great history. From Schooly D, The Fresh Prince, Black Thought, Beanie Sigel, State Property, and so many others. How has the legacy of Philly hip-hop influenced your approach to music? Kur: The Philly legacy of MC’s definitely has influenced me. I remember riding in the car with my mom and she would be playing Cassidy who was killing at the time. So, when I actually met these people, and they was like, “Yo, you hot,” that meant I must really be hot because I grew up listening to them. It meant the world to me to get the co-sign from some of the Philly legends. AllHipHop: Indeed. I know you’re from the Uptown (Uptop) section of Philly. Tell me about the uniqueness of that part of the city and how growing up there shaped you? Kur: I feel like it’s unique in its own way because people might take Uptown the wrong type of way, you know based off how it looks. It may not look like the worst area, but a pile of sh** be going down around there for real. I feel like the uniqueness of Uptown helped me to paint a picture of what it’s really like and how it all goes down there. I wanted people from different neighborhoods to be like “yo, the same sh** that’s going down in my hood, is going down in his.” Everybody has their picture of Uptown and I just wanted to paint my own. AllHipHop: You have a very descriptive, intense style of lyricism. In your own words, how would you describe your style? Kur: Intense would be the way I would describe it too. Yeah, I’m trying to grow as an artist but sometimes that street is like, “F**k it, to get back to the raw sh**.” So, my style is raw, aggressive, and hungry, you what I'm saying? That’s how I would describe me style. AllHipHop: What’s your thoughts on the current Philly hip-hop scene? Kur: You know, it much better now that when I first started. It’s a bunch of talent coming out of Philly and their always has been hot rappers coming from Philly. Listen, I be happy to see other rapper’s coming up too. I'm embrace mothef***ers that’s coming up. I mean you don't even gotta have a whole clout behind you and all that sh**. If I f*** with it organically, I just reach out to see what’s good. I feel like the scene is doing way better than it was before because multiple people getting shine. AllHipHop: Now tell me how the feeling was when you went on Twitter and saw that Meek Mill shouted you out? Did you a relationship with Meek before that? Kur:  Nah, we didn’t have no relationship before. I remember when I saw it, it was on a Thursday and I just finished recording this record called “33 Shots.” I dropped it that night and we posted it online. When I use to drop tracks, me and my homies use to ride around and listen to the track that I dropped and look at it from a fan’s perspective like we wasn’t nice. So, no bullsh**, when Meek tweeted it, we almost crashed the car like, “Oh sh** this nigga tweeted it?” You gotta think coming into this sh**, you don't know how is going to go, if people are gonna get with you are not. So, to have Meek think my s***was hot was a major stamp for sure. That made me know it was real. We made some songs together. We been rocking together ever since.  AllHipHop: Out of all your material, I love your project with Dave East. I consider you too in similar spaces as the next generation of MC’s for both of your respective cites. Yall have great chemistry together. How did you two link up? Kur: The day I signed with E1 (Entertainment One) he hit me and said, “Slide to the studio.” He told me he was trying to knock this tape out in a day. But I’m not gonna lie to you, when I record it literally takes me like 40 hours to write a verse. So, I’m like, “Damn a whole joint in one day?” But I couldn’t back down from a challenge, so I was like, “Come on let's go.” I went over there we knocked out like three records. When I was done, it was like four in the morning, so I was like f**k this, I'm going back to Philly. We only had two or three joints done and I'm surprised we got those done in a day. So, when I left, East texted me like, “Damn bro, I'm trying to get this shit done.” We only got like maybe two or three records anyway because I think we only have like five records on there. So, East came out to Philly and we knocked out two or three more records. No bullsh**, we really did that in two days, and I feel like it could have been 10 times harder if we would have took our time but being under that sort of pressure, he was like “If I don't get it done man, we ain’t never gonna get it done.” We banged out that project in a couple days. AllHipHop: Your newest track “Crack” is a banger for sure. Tell me how you came up with the concept? Kur: I felt like it was a more polished version of myself. Rich Nyce directed the video. I was trying to be like a more polished version of myself and show my growth as an artist. I still came with the intense, aggressive style I’m known for. I just wanted the streets to know that I got some fire coming.  AllHipHop: What inspires you to create? Kur: You know what? Somebody just asked me that. I was just like, I feel like it's just everything. It's to get to this point it's like, why would you give up now? The rap game comes on a lot of sh**. I mean like it is some good, you get a lot of light, but it comes with a lot of sh** you know. People don't really see that so it's like as much as you sacrifice and to give up now would be crazy. That's what really inspires from day to day to get up off my ass. I got a homie that’s locked up and if I give up, how's it gonna be for him? You know what I mean? That’s why I do what I do. AllHipHop: Lastly, what other projects are you working on? I see you hitting the road for some dates. Kur: Yeah, I’m excited about dropping my first full-length project entitled Shakur. I got some dope music that’s gonna be on there. I’m on the Between Somewhere tour with Token right now. I love performing for my fans and this tour has been fire! Me and Token been killing. Be on the lookout because I got some heat coming for yall.  ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202433.77/warc/CC-MAIN-20190320150106-20190320172026-00072.warc.gz

By the time my son was a little over a year old, I wound up in Prison. What did you do?  I was robbing people. Was this like a straight thug “give-me-your-money” type of robbery?  Yes. People always tell me that they can’t believe I was like that. My father is a lawyer, after all. What brought you to do that?  It was sheer ignorance, lots of it, and desperation for funds. Part of it was rebellion and proving a point that I didn’t need anyone. I knew what I was doing wasn’t right. It didn’t take long for me to realize that I needed to stop. I didn’t have to go through a bunch of bad experiences to finally learn. I took that one lesson and grew from it. You took steps to start improving your life once you got out of jail? I actually started doing that during my rehabilitation period. I began to read books, pursue my cosmetology license and obtain my GED. I already knew how to sketch since I was an artist so that made fashion my focal point when I was released from Prison. I went back to school and attended Long Beach City College to further pursue my fashion goals. As soon as I did what my father originally wanted me to do, which was get an education, things started to fall in place naturally. So you are a natural artist? I loved comics but I could never bring one to life but the idea of it pushed me in to the fashion world by being able to sketch. I just celebrated my 10th year in the fashion industry. I’ve presented for two years in a row at L.A. Fashion Week. Angela Simmons recently wore one of your designs?  She wore my “Lovers” T-Shirt on 106 & Park for a whole hour and I almost died. She also wore one of my pants with my name on the back of it. That was amazing. I had to grab my phone and post pictures on Instagram of her wearing the Kym Couture Kollection. I’m getting ready to have a Grand Opening In February for my Boutique store in Beverly Hills, so I’m real excited about that too. What’s your message for other young single mom’s out there?  Love your children enough to do better for yourself. The well-being of your children comes first and you should do everything in your power to make that happen. And to those who have made wrong decisions that have landed them in jail?  Don’t allow yourself to be labeled by others. People will try to label you and put you in a statistical group- don’t fall for that. If you’re a good person, it will come through. I can’t say that everybody that has made mistakes is a good person but if you are a good person it will come through eventually. Where can people find your work and learn more about you? You can learn more about me and my designs at www.kymcouturekollection.com and you can follow me Instagram @kymquaintrelle – especially because I’m addicted to that!

171,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/lecrae-when-the-saints-go-marchin-in-to-hip-hop-ZfCTWIxcXkS3F_YRBCDxMg/,"At Rock the Bells in San Bernardino, while Juicy J was on one stage  rapping about “Bandz will make her dance,” you had Lecrae rocking the  stage across the grounds rapping about faith, love, and encouragement to  a group of excited young people hanging on his every word. That’s no  knock on Juicy J by the way, rather it’s just an example of Lecrae’s  amazing accomplishment in bringing what’s considered “gospel rap” to the  forefront and on the same levels of it’s more popular counter-parts,  something that pioneering gospel rap groups like Soldiers For Christ and  D.C. Talk set out to do long ago. Personally, I’m happy to see something like this succeed. First off,  Lord knows that there are people out there that need to hear a good  positive message and secondly, Hip-Hop always thrives in diversity. AllHipHop.com sat down with Lecrae before he took the stage at Rock  the Bells to discuss this amazing feat and more. Oh, when the Saints go  marching in! AllHipHop.com: Let’s start off by giving the people out there an idea of what it is exactly that you do.  Lecrae: I do honest Hip-Hop. A lot of people don’t want to address  issues in life, not to say that everything is so serious, but if I’m  going to talk about then I’m going to talk about it. I remember a time  in Hip-Hop when there artists talking about a variety of things, whether  it was N.W.A. talking about Police brutality or Public Enemy talking  about standing up or A Tribe Called Quest just being themselves. I was  fortunate enough to have Uncles that grew up on all of their music, who  put me on to all of their music. For me, I’m a part of that situation in  just being honest about everything whether it’s faith, love,  relationships, or whatever. Christian rappers have been around since the late 80’s and I  can remember a time where they weren’t seen on the same level as the  mainstream secular artists. Here you are rocking the same venues and on  the same cards. It’s really come that far. Lecrae: This is no knock to any Christian that has ever done Hip-Hop  before but I think a part of it as that I’m not a Christian trying to  rap. I’m a Hip-Hop artist that’s part of the culture who loves Jesus –  and that’s going to come out. It’s not about me trying to be like  someone else or the Christian version of a certain artist. It’s me being  the first me and doing what I love to do. Do you get a lot of resistance in the Hip-Hop world for your faith?  Lecrae: What’s funny is that I probably get more resistance from Church people! Why is that? Lecrae: Because it’s probably harder for them to comprehend due to thinking within a box. I see. They probably think that you are still a part of the “world” as they say in some Christian circles. Lecrae: Exactly. I’ll be honest, I don’t get resistance when I’m at  something like this (Rock the Bells). I actually get more respect that  I’m standing out. People respect that I’m willing to be myself and come  to grips that I love God and I don’t care. Do you consider what you’re doing as a ministry? Lecrae: The word ministry just means to serve. Anytime I make music, I  think I’m serving people. If I’m working at In-N-Out Burgers, I’m  serving people by feeding them. So yeah, I’m feeding people  artistically, spiritually, socially, politically – absolutely.  Do people let you know that your words have touched and helped them? Lecrae:Earlier today, I was at one of the Westfield Malls out in West  Covina, CA and we were at a store shopping for my Rock the Bells  performance. My boy was talking to one of the employees at the store and  told him that I rapped and he asked to check out my music. Right then  he starts searching for music at the store and he starts playing one of  my songs as I was leaving. I’m walking down the Mall and soon enough  he’s chasing me down and taps me on the shoulder. He told me that he had  just listened to two songs and that what I said really touched him. As a  matter of fact, he said it was the “Just Like You” song that rocked him  and touched him in a special way. That kind of stuff right there is  powerful. Why would you not want to create music where you can be honest  and tell your story? It affects people’s lives. Tell me about the GRAMMY award that you won. Lecrae: I feel fortunate. In some sense, winning a GRAMMY is  shocking. It just says to me that I should keep going instead of  thinking that I made it. I see it as an incentive to keep making music. I  don’t do it to be acknowledged but I’m appreciative of the  acknowledgement. I’m going to keep going. Out of all of the rappers out there, not a lot can say that they have a GRAMMY on the shelf. Lecrae: Yeah, I know. There are some artists that I believe that  should have one. Nas, in my opinion, should have one. I don’t make the  rules in that situation. I just make music and let the chips fall where  they may. What’s next on your agenda? Lecrae: Right now I’m working on Church Clothes Volume 2. Don Cannon hosted Volume 1 and we had over a half million downloads. We had production from 9th Wonder and Boi-1da. Church Clothes Volume 2  is coming and it’s crazy. I’ve got production once again from Boi-1da,  and also David Banner. I’ve got features from people like Paul Wall and  from my own camp a rapper named Derek Minor who is a ferocious animal on  the microphone. I’m opening up doors for him to run through. After  that, I’ll be working on my album. As a person of faith, do you think you could ever be goaded in to a diss war with anybody? Lecrae: (laughs) Maybe in fun but never something like I’m going to  tear this person down. We play around on the tour bus and battle each  other for fun. It will never be to tear someone down, maybe something  along the lines of playing one on one Basketball on the court. Have you ever been dissed? Lecrae: I’m sure there have been some slick things said out there but  nothing direct. I think more people respect what I do and the rest  don’t even know who I am, so it’s cool (laughs). I’m not trying to get  in to no beefs. People love drama and negativity and they feed off of  that stuff – I prefer Chicken. That’s my thing. ​ ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912205534.99/warc/CC-MAIN-20190326135436-20190326161436-00231.warc.gz

This was when things got a  little tricky. In one of hip-hop’s most controversial moments, rapper LeShaun who  was prominently featured on the song was excluded from the video and  replaced with a model. But, there is more to the story. LeShaun wasn’t  just a feature on “Doin’ It,” the song was for all intents and purposes a  remake of her song, “Wild Thing.” She explains that it was Chris Lighty  who came to her personally when LL wanted to remake the song, so they  did, and she was on it. But, as Hype Williams prepared to shoot the  video, LeShaun was not included because she was 7 months pregnant with  her now teenaged daughter. So, she sued… and she won. Since the lawsuit, LeShaun pursued a career in photography and is a  “body work” expert, she performs massages, does personal training and  she lives what she teaches as demonstrated by her own amazing body. She  is too often remembered for being one-half of one of “hip-hop’s biggest  beefs,” but in reality, she and LL are still friends, and she would love  to perform “Doin’ It” with him if, and when, he is inducted in the Rock  & Roll Hall of Fame. AllHipHop.com caught up with LeShaun about LL,  photography, female rappers, and if there is any such thing as life  after hip-hop.  AllHipHop.com: Being part of Flavor Unit seemed like  it had to be so fun, jumping on and off of each other’s records. Take  us back to some of the early days in your career. LeShaun: Wow. It was fun. But, at the same time it  was stressful, because there weren’t very many females, doing what we  were doing. There were some that were out, but they weren’t writing  their own shit. So it was really nerve wracking to say the least,  because those of us that were really talented and writing our own stuff,  we weren’t depending on a ghost writer. But, it was kinda like, ‘Are  you kidding me?’ like this person is doing this that and the other she  did not even write that, you know, it would piss me off, you know.   Because we knew we were writing our own stuff and we had the talent,  but it was just so hard for us to really get our foot in the door and  get the recognition that we deserved you know as female artists that  were doing our own thing. AllHipHop.com: Why do you think things are so challenging for female artists in hip-hop? LeShaun: I don’t know it’s almost as if guys don’t  wanna hear girls rapping, I mean, not only just guys, I guess. People  just don’t want to hear females rapping. I’m not sure. I love it (to  hear female rappers), of course, obviously I’m a little bit biased, but,  you know, I have always loved it. I’ve always loved to see women get  involved in something that is male dominated and then do their thing. I  am the type of girl that loves to watch a movie and then there is a bad  a** chick in the movie and, I’m like ‘Yeah!’ I have always been that  type of girl. It’s weird now because it’s still that same struggle that I had when I  was younger.  Rap is still very male dominated, and you have one or two  females that are doing something, and it’s like there is not enough  room, but there is enough room for a hundred male rappers to all be  doing well at one time. And that kinda sucks. I don’t know I don’t know I  don’t know what it is about the culture. But you definitely you got a  lot of females that are out there, some that have not even been  discovered yet–that are dope as hell, that write their own stuff and can  can spit like like the guys you know just right off the top and it’s  just harder for them.  You know, it’s just weird. AllHipHop.com: Can you talk about “Doin It,” and why it was important to you to speak up for yourself and and take legal action. LeShaun: Ummm well… Let me see…First of all, I need  to say there was a lot of stuff going on as far as me not being visible  in the video.  Because LL was the person that I was doing the song with,  and he was the talent, he was the one that they sort of put in the  forefront (as making the decision to exclude me from the video), but it  wasn’t LL It was the people behind him saying, ‘you know we can’t do  this; she is pregnant.’ The media, they don’t care about the middle man,  or anybody behind the scenes they want to make it about the talent, the  artist and the person that people know that they are familiar with  which was LL. And so… we had our issues. I was really upset about the situation because I was pregnant, but I  still felt like I wanted people to know who I was, you know? Someone  else was going to get the recognition for the hard work that I did, and  that’s what really upset me.  I really wanted to make a statement that I  thought it was unfair for me to not be able to do my thing.  It was not  fair for me to just you know sit back and say here’s my voice and  nobody knows who the hell I am. This was one of the biggest songs of you  know of his career. It was huge, “Doing It” went triple platinum and  that could have done a lot more for me career wise. And still to this day, I feel like had I been in the video, I think  it would have probably helped my music career move along, but then again  I had to think that everything happens for a reason. I was pregnant.  When I look at pictures of myself when I was pregnant, I ask myself if I  really want that to be looping over and over and over again 20 years  later with my pregnant face when they were shooting the video, I had my  daughter, but I still had that pregnant look.  You get that pudgy face  your nose is wide and you just don’t really kinda look like yourself, I  don’t know if you have any kids or if you’ve ever had any children and  went through that but your face looks different. You know, And so I  don’t know, I’m kinda like did I really want that to be the face that  people remember 20 years down the line, I don’t know. AllHipHop:  Have you left rap behind and, if so, what is that like? LeShaun: No I haven’t, I still write pretty much  every day. I still write songs, I write poetry. I am actually about to  finish up my book of poetry. So some of them are funny, some of them are  cutthroat, they come from life experiences. Some of them are street, I  mean I’m still Brooklyn (laughter). Some people that have run in my  circle are gonna say, ‘holy sh*t she talking about me.’ I am planning to  tie in my photography with the book. I am definitely not giving up on  hip hop. I would love to get my ass back out there on stage and do a  show or two.

174,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/liberation-yDr1otQXXU6tXcTI3jSKeg/," Running nine tracks and only available on the net, Liberation is by no means lazy. As a matter of fact, lazy in Hip-Hop usually means when the artist is too arrogant and complacent to edit his album to a reasonable length. Talib and Madlib, however took the time to string quality songs together and it shows in Talibs intricate flows and Madlib's crisp vinyl-researched beats. Lyrically, Talib has stepped up his Webster game. On the intro track, ""The Show,"" he goes on a lyrical stream of consciousness: ""Popping fresh, caking up and breaking up the monotonous/Flow they cant write or plant life like a botanist, grow/A new crop and just roll it up blow it up/Excuse the calculus, though."" Talib and Madlib also lean toward concept songs as tracks like ""Over The Counter"" and ""Engine Runnin'"" with Consequence spice up the album's already high caliber content.  The strongest track on Liberation is by far ""Happy Home"" featuring Candice Anderson. Its an ultra poetic retelling of the Kweli family tree, and definitely has one of the longest rewind half-life of any rap song put out in all of '06. Mr. Kweli has a big reputation for dropping bold chunks of knowledge, so in a way Liberation is not a surprise. But what sets him apart on this release is that instead of relying on his reputation, he builds on it.

And Hip-Hop is an accelerated art form, so for music from that culture to have maintained or even gained relevancy from when Do the Right Thing dropped to today is especially astonishing. Plus, 1988 was the biggest year Hip-Hop had seen at that point, but by the grace of beats, rhymes, and life, the momentum kept going through the end of decade. 1989 was a great time for Hip-Hop too. And in recognition of that, AllHipHop.com put together a list of that year’s best rap albums. These are the essentials from Sunday, January 1, 1989, to Sunday, December 31, 1989. These projects were amazing at the time of their release. The mark that they and their creators made can even be seen in current Hip-Hop. Here are the 10 best rap albums from 1989 and the reasons why Hip-Hop and pop culture wouldn’t be where they are now without them. 10). Ghetto Music: The Blueprint of Hip Hop by Boogie Down Productions: BDP’s third release found KRS-One bringing together the battle attitude of Criminal Minded with the consciousness of By All Means Necessary. The result of that combination helped position Mr. Parker as the great teacher he is still widely regarded as. Whether questioning Hip-Hop’s commercial aspirations (“Ghetto Music”) or educating listeners about African-American history (“You Must Learn”), KRS-One had valid points to make. And with everyone from 50 Cent to Black Star paying respect to BDP in one way or another, it’s safe to say that KRS-One got those points across and then some. 9). The Iceberg/Freedom of Speech…Just Watch What You Say by Ice-T: This album is an excellent conceptual piece wherein Ice imagines an America where the government has control of everyone, á la George Orwell’s 1984. Prior to this album’s release, Ice T was dealing with censorship issues. In his 1994 book, The Ice Opinion, Ice wrote, “People had already told me what I could not say on stage in Columbus, Georgia. You couldn’t say anything they called a ‘swear’ word.” The rights and limits of free speech have been a constant battle and there is no end in sight. However, this is a great advocate for the First Amendment if ever there was one. 8). The Cactus Album by 3rd Bass: This interracial rap collective made quite an impression with their debut. Backed by production from The Bomb Squad, Prince Paul, and Sam Sever, the album proved that successful Caucasian rappers were not a fluke. In fact, on the album’s first song, “Sons of 3rd Bass,” MC Serch even disses The Beasties to avoid comparisons: “Swam to the lyrics ‘cuz Serch is your father / Screaming ‘Hey Ladies,’ why bother?” And while Serch would be later recognized for helping get Nas his big break, this album is memorable too because it introduced MF Doom to the world (as part of KMD) on “The Gas Face.” 7). Unfinished Business by EPMD: EPMD followed up Strictly Business with another great collection of songs. Erick Sermon sticks to his winning formula of funk-inspired production and Parrish’s flow complements its nicely. Lyrically, the content is mostly B-Boy boasting. However, the highlight of this 12-track album is the humbling “Please Listen to My Demo.” Even to this day, it’s still a song that every aspiring artist can relate to. In 2012, Erick released the Breath of Fresh Air mixtape- a piece of work that successfully brought together stars of different eras (i.e. Rick Ross, Too Short, Method Man) and showcased newer talent (i.e. Fred the Godson, Twone Gabz). 6). It’s a Big Daddy Thing by Big Daddy Kane: It’s a Big Daddy Thing finds Big Daddy Kane reaching for a wider audience. To a lesser artist, that would be a hindrance. However, not in Kane’s case. While his debut mostly presented him as a just rapper, his follow-up shows him as a true Hip-Hop artist the can be everything from a social commentator to a ladies’ man. The beats could be a bit stronger (Marley Marl is only responsible for two songs this go-round), but that’s just a minor misstep because it doesn’t stop Kane from showing why he was and still is one of the dopest emcees ever. It’s no wonder that Jay Z had to bring Kane out at his first Barclays Center show. 5). Done by the Forces of Nature by Jungle Brothers: While the impact of Straight Out the Jungle is undeniable, it doesn’t excuse the fact that the Jungle Brothers’ sophomore effort is more overlooked than it should be. The production is better on this album and the quality of the instrumentals and the raps reflect that. Topic wise, there’s Afrocentric themes as well as fun party music. The balance of the two make for a well-rounded listening experience, which is exactly what a classic album should be. Spiritually (“In Dayz “2” Come”), socially (“Acknowledge Your Own History”), and even sexually (“Belly Dancin’ Dina”), this is some of the best music that the Native Tongues ever put out. The double disc reissue of the album does the project’s legacy justice. 4). No One Can Do It Better by The D.O.C.: The album title lives up to its name. While many of the artists The D.O.C. wrote hits for were gangsta rappers, the poetic sensibilities that he displays here not only prove that he was diverse with the pen, but that his own skills were more akin to Kane and Rakim. The possibilities for The D.O.C. seem endless when taking those factors into consideration, but that’s what makes listening to this album bittersweet. After the release of it, The D.O.C. was in a car accident that damaged his voice. While being interviewed by Playboy last year, The D.O.C. said, “The whole West Coast movement changed direction the night I had that accident.” I couldn’t agree more. 3). Road to the Riches by Kool G Rap & DJ Polo: G Rap’s multi-syllabic rhymes from this release are now the stuff of Hip-Hop legend and Riches’ scratching and production (courtesy of Polo and Marley Marl respectively) gave the LP a refreshing sound. From the saxophones on “Truly Yours” to G Rap getting it in on “Men at Work,” G Rap and Polo’s debut album and subsequent material definitely raised the bar. Their influence can still be seen in 2014. Want proof? Check the title of Joey Fatts’ upcoming mixtape, iLL Street Blues. That’s also the name of a classic G Rap and Polo song from 1992’s Live and Let Die. Kool G Rap & DJ Polo - Road To The Riches - FULL ALBUM 2). Paul’s Boutique by Beastie Boys: The Beasties’ sophomore set is phenomenal. The Dust Brothers’ use of samples is astonishing and all three rappers hold their own. It’s a different sound than their debut, but this album allowed the trio to evolve from frat boys who rapped to legit emcees. One of the best examples of this is Adam “MCA” Yauch in “Year and a Day.” His passing in 2012 was certainly tragic, so the playground in Brooklyn that was renamed after him in 2013 is a touching tribute. “And lookin’ out at the world through my window pane / Every day has many colors cause the glass is stained / Everything has changed but remains the same.” 1). 3 Feet High and Rising by De La Soul: This is an amazing album from start to finish. The project has a cohesion to it that remains unmatched since it came out. It not only introduced skits, but also served as a great contrast to the emerging popularity of hardcore Hip-Hop at the time. De La Soul provided great rhymes that covered a variety of subjects and Prince Paul’s production was innovative to say the least. The album is timeless, so it’s not surprising that today’s top Hip-Hop crew, Black Hippy, was inspired by the trail that Posdnous, Trugoy the Dove, and P.A. Pasemaster Mase blazed with this masterpiece. HONORABLE MENTIONS: Even though these albums didn’t make the list, they’re still really good and worth checking out. All Hail the Queen by Queen Latifah: For skeptics who thought “Wrath of Madness” was all Latifah had to offer, they were sorely mistaken. Grip It! On That Other Level by Geto Boys: This album was good enough for Rick Rubin to want to go in and make a few minor adjustments. Once he did, the project went from good to great. See The Geto Boys. GETO BOYS DO IT LIKE A G.O  We’re In This Together by Low Profile: The re-introduction of this album was long overdue. It had been out of print and then thankfully arrived on iTunes. Youngest in Charge by Special Ed: Released when he was only 16, Youngest proved that Special Ed had skills beyond his years. As Nasty As They Wanna Be by The 2 Live Crew: It laid the foundation that countless T&A-inspired artists have been building on for decades. Do you agree with the list?

The rapper, born Durk Banks, is not only consistently releasing hot records, but also turning his OTF family into a label. Durk is way more than your average street rapper. His music is a combination of real-life experiences, butter-smooth flows, and trap-heavy production. Earlier this year, he released his critically-acclaimed project titled ""Just Cause Y'all Waited,"" with features from Lil Baby, PartyNextDoor, Ty Dolla $ign, Gunna, and TK Kravitz. Now, fans wait patiently for the upcoming compilation mixtape, ""Signed to the Streets 3.""  AllHipHop recently caught up with Durk at OG King Louie's studio/dispensary in downtown LA.  AllHipHop: On “Homebody” you actually rap about Percs, how has your outlook changed since Fredo Santana’s death? Lil Durk: I stopped. AllHipHop: Really? Lil Durk: Yeah, I don’t like Percs. It was already like, I was cool on them anyway, but with that situation... AllHipHop: Right, so you stopped doing them after that? Lil Durk: Yeah. Actually, I was high when I got the phone call. I was panicking like “damn.” AllHipHop: Good for you, that makes me so happy Lil Durk: Yeah fa sho. It’s like everybody’s going to do what they’re going to do regardless, but by him dying, by Lil Peep dying, a lot of people are going to stop the situation, and a lot of people are going to keep going. It’s your choice.  AllHipHop: How did you end up mediating the 6ix9ine/Chief Keef beef? Lil Durk: I went on Instagram live with 6ix9ine and what I was explaining to them was, I don’t be keeping up. I look at that s##t like a joke. No matter how ya’ll take it, how ya’ll do it, it’s a joke. So... I’m like, “That’s not how ya’ll are going to end it.” He was like, “Oh s##t, I ain’t know that s##t was like that.”  AllHipHop: What have you learned most now that you been in the business for almost 10 years? What’s the difference between 17-year-old Durk and 25 year old Durk? Lil Durk: I’m a businessman now, definitely. I’m more mature. I learned from my mistakes, definitely know how to change everything around me, change everybody around me. Like my management, they all went to college. I’m being smart about the situation because I want to grow. I don’t want my managers to be high, just grow. AllHipHop: Who are the Top 5 producers you’ve worked with?

177,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/lumidee-break-away-v3nShxll5U-meAk4IEAwVA/," The album is following a similar path to her first release in the form of the club hit Shes Like the Wind featuring Tony Sunshine, and has elevated to an even hotter buzz with her second single Im Up featuring Jim Jones. This time however, Lumidee is ready for whatever might come, and is fully prepared to take advantage of her second chance at success in an industry where many people dont even get a first.  AllHipHop.com Alternatives: The new album is being released by TVT Records. How did that relationship come about?  Lumidee: Basically, I was with the last label for the last three years. We were ready to release the album overseas and decided to shop it in the U.S. We got some interest from a couple of different labels, but when I met with TVT, we had a good meeting and they were ready to move the fastest on the project. It seemed like a better place for me to be, seeing as I had already came from a major and I know how it goes there [competing with] so many other artists. It was the right time for me; being with an independent like TVT, I get the attention I need.  AHHA: You rapped here and there on the first album, but people know you better for singing. On your single Shes Like The Wind, youre rapping and Tony Sunshine handles the singing. Does the single choice indicate that the overall album will lean more towards rapping as well?  Lumidee: Nah, not at all. This wasnt ever really intended to be a single. It was just something that was leaked out and the people grabbed onto it. The response was so big that it was like, Okay, thisll be the single since it was on the album anyway. Personally, I never wouldve picked this because I think it doesnt really tell you whats on the album. I am doing the rapping thing more than on the first album, but Im still doing my singing thing too. I didnt abandon one thing for the other. Im not trying to be a rapper or anything; this is just what I do.   AHHA: Which talent developed first for you; the singing or the rapping?  Lumidee: I actually was doing the rapping thing before I started singing. I was a little bit of a tomboy growing up and started out with freestyling in middle school. I got sick when I was 14-years-old with rheumatoid arthritis, so I was homebound for two years. I was really depressed so I started writing poetry, which turned into writing songs and then singing. It happened that the it was the Uh Oh record that popped off with me singing on it, so thats what the people basically got. It all happened so fast that it was like the world heard my demo, but if Id had more time, it wouldve been more like what youll get to hear this time.  AHHA: So you see the rapping as a natural extension of your talent more than a deliberate move to change your image?  Lumidee: Exactly. Im doing it all and mixing it up, but it all makes sense. Its not like youre gonna get confused and wonder what it is she does because Im doing it the right way. I have two other singles [in Europe] where I rap and sing. Shes Like the Wind wasnt even intended to come out in the States. It just happened like that, but Im happy the people grabbed onto it and love it. It opens the door for both for Tony and for me and leads us into our albums.  AHHA: Will this be a dual single that appears on Tony Sunshines album too?  Lumidee: Yeah, hell be using it as well. My label came to me with the idea and played me a demo of this guy singing the Patrick Swayze song [from Dirty Dancing]. I heard it and was like, Okay what do you want me to do with it? They asked if I could think of a credible artist that would do this justice, and I thought of Tony Sunshine automatically since we were already planning on working on something. We bumped into each other on the set of N.O.R.E.s video shoot and talked about working on each others albums. I sent it to him to see if hed even do it since some people might think it was corny, but he did his thing and sent it back to the label and they loved it.  AHHA: Your career has also run somewhat parallel to Nina Sky. You came out around the same time, and are once again releasing your albums fairly close to each other. How do you plan on setting yourself apart this time around?  Lumidee: Im not mad at [the association]. At the end of the day, when I came out, I knew that no one was doing what I did. I opened the door for certain things to come through and its all good as long as everybody does their thing. I think were pretty different; the only thing is that were all Spanish; theyre from Queens, Im from Harlem. We get compared more for the image than the music. I understand the comparison, but when you go deeper into what they do and what I do, I think people will see the difference.  AHHA: Youre not a reggaeton artist, but because of Diwali riddim on Uh Oh, youre still associated with the American resurgence of dancehall that morphed into the reggaeton movement. How do you feel about the state of reggaeton right now, especially with a lot of people saying that its dead or over?  Lumidee: I dont think its dead; were just in a period right now where certain people just need to step up. Major labels got involved that had no clue what it was about and messed things up a little bit, but Reggaeton has been going on for years way before the majors came in and had any interest. They got interested in the hype and the big records, but as soon as it stopped selling they tried to throw it away. Theres so many good Reggaeton and Latin artists that itll keep moving though. All it needs is that next big joint and its back on.   AHHA: Does having less attention on reggaeton free you from having to do it just to live up to an expectation?  Lumidee: I definitely still mess with it on the album because of the Latin roots, but I do World music. Im just doing me and you take it how you want it. I have a track called Did You Imagine with the reggaeton drums on it, but when it here it, its a lot bigger than that. Its something you could hear on Z-100 or on La Calle [New York radio stations]. Ive traveled so much since the last time I came out that everything Im doing is for the world. Im not just trying to cater to one audience, I want it all.  AHHA: Has being on TVT opened you up to more collaborations for Unexpected?   Lumidee: Of course theres Tony Sunshine, and I have a joint with [TVT labelmate] Pitbull. I worked with N.O.R.E. and Jim Jones, Wyclef is on a record that he produced as well. Snoop Dogg is on the album, and Ive got a track by Scott Storch.  AHHA: What are your plans over the next few months while youre promoting the album?   Lumidee: My focus is completely on the album right now. I cant say that I wouldnt do those things if the opportunity came and it was something I could do well, but I dont wanna suck at anything. Im definitely focused on the album right now and want to make sure the world sees my face and knows what Im about. Its a different feel from the first time around; the world heard my demo, this time youll hear my album.

180,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/mashonda-s-open-letter-to-alicia-keys-Kzh8JRyZeUOjiRqKiB89_g/,"She wrote the open letter to Alicia Keys, who is allegedly involved in an intimate relationship with Swizz. Mashonda felt the need to get some things off her chest, as written below. After having a great evening with my son and enjoying some fun twit chat, I decided to sign off and get some work done. However, a few hours later I was advised that I should check @aliciakeys twit page (twitter). I’ve never reached out to her on twitter before. I feel our issues are a lot more serious than a website conversation. Not to mention that I’ve reached out to her many times in the beginning of this whole thing, as any wife would do. Unfortunately, I never succeeded in getting a response. The 1st time I meet AK, my husband introduced us to each other at an event. ( I have no choice but to call him my husband, until he is not anymore) In the messages that I sent to her (AK), I made it very clear that on the contrary of what she might be hearing, I am still married to my husband, living with him and just had a child. Its been two years and I still have not received a response. What I do receive, is constant displays of selfishness and disconcern to me and my son. Mashonda’s “Back of Da Club” I was a fan of AK’s last album, we were both signed to J Records and I always checked up on her projects. I sang her songs and admired her for creating Superwoman and Karma, I would never deny her, her talent. I believed in her until I found out she was possibly sleeping with my husband. The affair was denied by both, until it was finally admitted months later.Already I can hear some of you saying ” why are u blaming her, You cant make someone leave their wife, You cant break something thats broken”. Well, my marriage was not broken, as far as I knew we were celebrating our sons birth and getting ready to celebrate our 5 year wedding anniversary . Call it blind love, whatever. I call it being a devoted wife.. As far as me blaming her and not blaming him, thats false. Me and my husband have worked out our differences. We are in a good place as people and as parents. I accept his choices and I am comfortable enough with myself to move on. I am so very blessed in many ways.My concern with AK is no longer the fact that she assisted in destroying a family but that she has the audacity to make these selfish comments about love and wanting to be with someone, even after knowing their situation. How is this the same Superwoman that I sang out loud with in my truck? I ask myself sometimes.If you are reading this Alicia, let me start by saying, you know what you did. You know the role you played and you know how you contributed to the ending of my marriage. You know that I asked you to step back and let me handle my family issues. Issues that you helped to create. Im not saying everything was perfect all the time but no relationship is perfect. We made a vow to God and I believe you should have respected that, as a woman. I know you owe me or my son nothing but I just wish you would’ve handled things more carefully. I’m not judging you, I put you and the whole situation in the hands of God, the Higher Power. Just know that as a woman, I expected so much more from you. I never had intentions on reaching out to you this way but after reading your twits tonight, and the constant disregard, you left me no choice. I feel that after 1 and a half years of you hiding this affair and acting like it doesnt exist, that now is the time to confront it, since you talk so openly about it nowThis is not a publicity stunt, I dont have a record coming out. I just need to close this chapter in my life and that means confronting our issues. There is a small child involved. His dad loves him to death and he wants to spend more time with him but hes afraid because he knows we don’t have a relationship. This is my main concern. My son NEEDS his dad and I NEED to be comfortable with you. For him!I know many will see my point and many will not be able to look into what’s real because they only want to see Alicia Keys the celebrity, not the human. This is not for the “people”, this is for you. Like I said I was left no choice but to reach out to you this way. By now, Im sure you want to find a balance in this as well.I read your tweets tonight and I felt they were very insensitive. You have no idea how much pain I was caused because of this affair. Its baffling to me that you don’t understand what I might have gone through with this situation. I dont consider myself a victim anymore, Ive learned alot from this! I just ask you to try and be a bit more realistic and delicate to the situation, at least until my divorce is final. I felt me attending the party would have been a starting point for us, since you shook my hand after I offered it, but I suppose I was wrong.If its so, that you and my husband are meant to be together, then God bless you both and I hope you never have to deal with what I did. I would not wish it on my worst enemy. If you two being together forever is the case, its more of a reason for us to get along, because I’m not going anywhere. Theres a child to be raised.To answer your tweet, choose smart over spark. Sparks burn everyone, be smart! Its simple actually, just think of the shoe being on the other foot.Stay blessed and lets work this thing out with respect and dignity. @ some comments: ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912204790.78/warc/CC-MAIN-20190326034712-20190326060712-00065.warc.gz
181,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/maybach-music-s-rain910-talks-about-his-deal-new-music-and-more-OvfzPVf4wkWIy_FvW_BM6w/,"At 9 years old, he began writing rhymes. By 13, he was already meeting with major label record companies.  Shortly after dropping out of school to pursue his dreams, he moved to live with his father in New York.  Today, Rain910 is starting his latest chapter, being Maybach Music Group’s newly-signed artist. Rain910’s biggest ambition is wanting to be remembered as one of the best artists ever. Another one of his goals is “writing one of the greatest albums of all time.” His focus is to “continue making good music on the highest level possible.”  Rain910 discusses the life experiences he has gone through with AllHipHop.com. AllHipHop.com: How does a rapper from Fayetteville end up in the game like this? Explain that. Rain: Man, hard work and dedication. You know what I'm saying? It definitely couldn't have happened just by sitting here in Fayetteville. We had to take this show on the road.  The whole thing was just not letting them tell us what we can and can't do and understanding there's other places in the world that have better opportunities and you can't be scared to leave your comfort zone and go see what it's about.  AllHipHop.com: What power moves did you actually make in order for this thing to happen?  Rain: I moved to New York when I was 16. I dropped out of high school and moved to New York. Not to say that's the thing to do you. I honestly had time, but you know when you're young, 16 years old and you got talent, you want to rush.  You want to get it right then at the moment. You want to have your Benz and be retired and your big house by the time you're 22. That was the whole mindset. It was like, ""Yo, I just want to get in the game, get in the game."" It didn't go that way, it took a little more time, and I could have actually finished school. Nevertheless, it was just like okay, I'm getting up to go get it. I ain't sitting around.  AllHipHop.com: Walk me through this journey. The first step that you took, you got in the studio or you became a battle rapper or what? What was it? Rain: It started off with just me rapping. I would be in the streets battling, trying to get my name up, then I realized I got to learn how to make songs. I always kind of knew how to make songs too because the first time I was ever in the studio, I was 13. I made a song. I didn't go in there and do a bunch freestyle, you know what I'm saying? It was like my man, he's a producer and I still work with him to this day. I grew up next to him. I remember I was 13. He'd play this beat and I'm like, ""Yo, this is crazy."" That was with my formula. To write the hook first. Then write out the topic, and then fill it in with the verses. It took awhile finishing the work because I was so young, and the s##t I was rapping about, it was what I was seeing in my neighborhood, and it was kind of like, ""Whoa, gangster s##t."" At 13, there's no way to market that. AllHipHop.com: How do you get the ears of Maybach Music, man?  Rain: Who you know gets you in the game. What you know determines how long you're going to stay there. AllHipHop.com: Oh man. That's incredible man. Basically, is this a management deal or the label deal?  Rain: This is a label, dude. This ain't no management. AllHipHop.com: Let's get into the project, man. Tell me something more about the new project that you're working on.  Rain: The project I got out right now called, ""Who the F##k Are You To Tell Me Anything."" It's a CD full of instrumentals. Rare instrumentals, though. You know what I'm saying? AllHipHop.com: Right. Rain: I wanted to put a project out, but I didn't want to spend too much time of coming up with the beats and writing the music. It took too long. I had to come up with an idea of being able to make some music that feels like it’s good quality, but without having to spend too much time on it. What I went and did, I went on YouTube and found a bunch of rare beats from some of my favorite producers.  Rain: I'm releasing a new song everyday. I'm calling it 1FanADay. I feel like people respect hard work and consistency so it's time to show them that no one is outworking me. We still trying to put them pieces together now but for now I'm working on the new self made album. AllHipHop.com:  Any future projects with J. Cole? You all from the same city. Rain: I won't be. I won't be working with J. Cole. He's somebody I know from back in the day that was coming up. We were both cool, but I feel like there were times where he gave his word on something and couldn't keep it. I'm really big on that. You know what I'm saying?  I don't really care about how much money a n##ga got. I don't think he really respected me in that way. What I can't accept is people who give their word that they're going to do something and don't do it. AllHipHop.com:  Right. What single can we expect from you, and what lane are you going to take in terms of the single too Rain: Yeah. The same s##t. The same s##t I been doing. For those who familiar, they know I come with the street tales and stories. AllHipHop.com:  Okay. Rain: And also, I try not to spread it, but it's always like, first person perspective. I'm not the dude looking out from the outside either. I've been through it. And I'm right in the middle of the hurricane. You know what I'm saying? I know exactly how I'm supposed to talk about this in a very specific ... In detail. You know what I'm saying? But we've got a joint out right now called, ""What Up, Woe!"" ​ ​ AllHipHop.com:  Okay. Tell me who influenced Rain910? Rain: Okay. I'm influenced by the art. You know, music. Living that beat. I look for a lot of '90's hip-hop. I also look into like Curtis Mayfield.  It's like I listen to anything. Everybody inspires me man. Everybody. Even the young dudes. They're saying the young dudes ain't putting any words together. AllHipHop.com:  Right. You killed the Hot 97 Freestyle with Flex. You killed it, son.  AllHipHop.com:  Definitely man. Yeah man. Anything else you want to say to the audience, man? Rain: I just want to say, thank you for the big favor and support man. That s##t really be keeping me going and same for the love and out to everybody who ever listened to some music from me or bought a CD or whatever. You know what I'm saying? Or even told somebody about me man. I appreciate all of that. .I know on everything.  AllHipHop.com:  Is Rick going to be on the album? Rain: Hopefully.  AllHipHop.com:  Thanks for your time, my brother. Rain: Thank you now. I appreciate your work. AllHipHop.com:  Yes sir man. God bless. Anyone Signing THEIR RIGHTS AWAY to that FAT FRAUD-OfficerRicky-the FAKE RickRoss is an IDIOT-a Fool & LAME as F*CK!

182,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/mc-sole-the-return-of-whitenoise-dPZS7jzzd0G9TzQpMxKaJQ/," I first met MC Sole at Scribble Jam in 2000, the hilarious one where Sage Francis won the MC battle disguised as the Soundman. Sole told me way back then that he felt you can't be a well-rounded MC if all you write are battle raps. Since then he continues to break with many hip-hop traditions while leaving behind a body of work that is undeniable. Sole is best known as the founder of Anticon records, a label that gained worldwide recognition under his guidance. Sole eventually left the label he created, and was forced to sue to get back his catalog. Now he hangs his hat with the embattled Fake Four label, owned by currently imprisoned Ceschi Ramos. His sophomore instrumental album WHITENOISE “nomoredystopias” was created with his wife, Yasamin, and is a wild ride of analog samples and plaintive drum programming showcasing the creative mind of one of Hip-Hop’s most interesting artists, who’s grown from an obscure New England solo act to international boss.  Gentle Jones: Have you and your wife worked on records together before? How is the experience?  MC Sole: Every once in a while I’ll be stuck on a beat and I’ll ask her to help finish a track. Her preferred genre is electronic music and dance, so I always want her input on beats cuz that’s her shit. She contributed to Mansbestfriend3, Desert Eagle, a couple records. With WHITENOISE, I was happy with where I got it on my own and asked if she would play on everything and she did and it came out awesome. We’re currently working on another instrumental project that will be more collaborative. I love working with her, we’ve been together over a decade so the idea now of us using occasional free time to make music is an awesome way for us to hang out and be creative. I would love if we built up this instrumental project to be something we could tour on together, score films, have excuses to take working vacations in cabins, etc.  Gentle Jones: Have you grown musically through the making of No More Dystopias?  MC Sole: For sure. This music was actually the hardest music I’ve put out, its music I’ve been working on for years. It’s a lot easier for me to rap on someone else’s beat and know it’s good, but when I’m making my own music on my own sometimes I over-think things and implode...that’s kinda why I had to call Yasamin in in the end. That said I have learned a lot about music theory, song structures, melodies, really learned a shit load about making music on an iPad, and expanding the way I’m using my equipment to make things feel more organic. Through all of this I also started having revelations about my live performance, so I abandoned Ableton/laptop and now I’m mostly rocking my SP 404 sampler instead.  Gentle Jones: Compare the equipment you used to record your early Northern Exposure projects to how you created Whitenoise?  MC Sole: Northern exposure... I don’t even know what kinda sampler that was made with... SP900 maybe, was the MPC 3000 even out by then? We recorded vocals/beats on ADAT, mixed in a pretty expensive studio, released on tape.  Whitenoise was recorded on a computer but everything was run through an old school analog 8 track. The drums were done mostly in Ableton. The music and tones were all made running samplers/keyboards/iPad shit through this noise rig... Kaoss pad, reverb pedals, delay, 90s multi effects processors, SP 404 sampler, Metal Muff pedal, etc. Whitenoise is basically running electronic shit through a guitar rig.  Gentle Jones: How did you come up with the title WHITENOISE?  MC Sole: Lots of reasons. Mainly because that’s what I like the most about my instrumental music, is creating tones, and using various tape/noise textures to make digital stuff come alive, to make it feel real. I got the original idea of Whitenoise from a Dellillo novel, people say it’s the first postmodern novel...that’s prolly why I latched onto it even though I didn’t know what post modernism was at the time... I think the term Whitenoise really describes the world we live in... It’s hard for me to even focus long enough to finish a sentence anymore... so fucking distracted all the time... overwhelmed with Whitenoise....  VIDEO: WHITENOISE - Fallujah & The Military Entertainment Complex  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ubnd_SO6fxU  Gentle Jones: Are you currently with a label?  MC Sole: I count myself as part of the Fake Four world, but that’s more of an emotional support/ mutual aid relationship then a straight label/artist relationship. I release most of my music on my own, DIY style, through my website and Revolver distribution. I could be linking up with an overseas partner for label stuff pretty soon & might even put my next album out on another label. Anything goes, as long as it makes sense. I’ll work with a label if they can do things for me I can’t do for myself.  Gentle Jones: How has your relationship with Fake Four changed since Ceschi’s incarceration?  MC Sole: I guess its stronger now. Last time I put out a record with Fake Four was 2010 (Hello Cruel World), but me and Ceschi have stayed in pretty constant contact, communicating, helping each other when we could. I’ve said it a million times, when I was down and out, had nowhere to turn, felt like my career was over, Anticon situation was in the dump... Fake Four stepped in and had my back, they put me on awesome tours, promoted the fuck out of my music, and welcomed me into one of the last-great-DIY-experimental-communities in rap! Now that he is the one in trouble I’m happy to do whatever I can to shed light on his case and make his time in there as bearable as possible. I talk to David and Jeep now, they run the label in his absence... its so heart wrenching to think of Ceschi in prison, who is literally the nicest guy I know. Even writing this I realize I haven’t written to him, and I’m a shitty friend for that. I’ll do it today.  Gentle Jones: Has a major label ever approached you for a project?  MC Sole: Not really, to be honest. From the moment I stepped in the game I had my middle fingers up, no management, no bullshit. Even before I was very political, dealing with me would always be more difficult for labels then its worth, every time I’ve asked a label for my masters back I can always sense a feeling of relief, “Oh thank god no more of this asshole”. I think if motherfuckers thought they could make money out of me they woulda stepped up though.  Gentle Jones: Do you consider yourself an MC?  MC Sole: Yeah sure. I’m a rapper. Not so sure I wanna be something like a “master of ceremonies” though. What kind of ceremony should I be “mastering?” I’d turn it around... most of these motherfuckers ain’t MC’s, they’re Instagram accounts that shit out music!  Gentle Jones: In the industry today who do you consider your peers? Whose current work inspires you?  MC Sole: My peers, B. Dolan, Sage Francis, Busdriver, Astronautalis, Ceschi, Bleubird, Jel, Nosdam, Jared Paul. All for different reasons, but those are who I consider my peers to be. Other than them I’m always inspired by Godspeed You Black Emperor, Witch House stuff, Pictureplane, really into the new anarcho-folk stuff like Andrew Jackson Jihad and Ramshackle Glory, gangster rap. I grew up on NWA, Spice One, my favorite rapper growing up was Ice Cube (big surprise). Nowadays I really like listening to overproduced rap albums, stuff like Yeezus, Jay Z, I like listening the new rappers to hear what kinda styles/beats they are rocking, the lyrics are generally awful, but it still inspires me. Trae the Truth, 2009 Lil B, Future, fuck it even Chief Keef, whatever, I can listen to anything really.  Gentle Jones: Do you think the current “Battle Rap” event trend is good for Hip-Hop?  MC Sole: No, not really. It’s just re reinforcing the worst things about hip hop culture; ego, racism, misogyny. When I was coming up, a freestyle battle was how you settled disputes, it’s how you communicated with other artists, it’s something you did for fun, and also for competition. It’s a skill you had to keep sharp because if you wanted to say you were the shit you had to defend it. Somewhere in the past 20 years the term freestyle started to mean, “verse I have laying around” and battle became something you wrote in advance! I think its wack as fuck. Not only does it enable people who can’t write a song to save their lives to feel like mini celebs on a shitty reality show, most of these grind time kind of battles I’ve seen are just “racist slam poetry.”  Gentle Jones: I’ve seen a picture of you performing as a teenager with house music legend Robin S., tell me how that happened?  MC Sole: Hahaha. Wow. I won a rap battle contest to perform with Robin S at a local club called BBC (in Portland, Maine). In the contest I tied with some R&B group that I was friends with, so together we had to put together a set and then I got to perform a rendition of “Show Me Love” with Robin S. I was 15 or so. It was hilarious and shitty.  Gentle Jones: Did you get to meet Robin S?  MC Sole: I met her. She was nice. That’s all I remember. My brain wasn’t fully formed at the time. I just remember I got to do one of those shitty Heavy-D esque rap verses at the end of show me love and people went crazy! This wasn't my first show. I had performed many times before that. I performed weekly at the local dance club, put on shows at skate parks, etc. But this may have been the first time I opened for someone with a hit record.  Gentle Jones: Did you sue your old label Anticon? Did you win?  MC Sole: About 4 years ago I entered into arbitration (out of court way of dealing with “internal” corporate/legal issues) to get the legal rights to all my music back from the label and to repudiate my shared in the company. I got my stuff back and now I earn more money from my music than ever and it’s amazing! But it’s hard to describe something as traumatic as that, winning. It feels like a win but it also represents a kind of failure.  Gentle Jones: How has the internet changed the game and how important are services like Sound Exchange to you as an artist?  MC Sole: The internet changed everything. It’s like the plow. It’s made everything more difficult, and cheapened everything as well. What it means to be a musician has been changed a lot, and I’d argue that’s technology not just the internet. Before you’d have to save up to buy equipment, thousands of dollars, then to get it out would cost additional thousands. It was a serious venture, you were fully invested in it, but when you released music people bought it. My first 12” sold 2,000 copies, imagine some no name selling 2,000 copies today. I sold 10,000 copies of Bottle of Humans without sending out a single promo! Then when Indy began creeping into the more mainstream world everything changed, you had publicists, distributors, booking agents, everybody getting a cut... then everything imploded people stopped buying music, anyone with a laptop could make an album, but the labels and related industries still were there. If I could sell 10,000 copies of a new CD out the box, today, I’d buy a house tomorrow with the money, but it’s just not like that. People think that the internet has made music more democratic but it doesn’t, blogs only wanna post what will drive traffic, what drives traffic is what’s popular, what’s popular is usually a mini update on something else... with hip-hop it’s even worse, labels do this “ghost A&R” thing like they did with artists like Odd Future, even cats like Action Bronson, Death Gripz, etc. They’ll be signed to a label but no one will know, and they’ll market them like they are underground and fans can’t tell the difference... motherfuckers just sop up whatever is put down in front of them! It’s harder than ever for new artists to break through if you ask me. I don’t fuck with sound exchange, but I do earn money from streaming revenues, it currently counts for about 15% of my digital revenue....  The positives of it, and I’m not even convinced it’s positive.... you can make something in your bedroom and put it out in the same day. There are people in the world who pay for mp3s. You can use social media to reinforce the alienation of American society while selling shit to your fans... you can have a website that sells stuff.... you can sell stuff on Bandcamp... you can make videos.... best thing about this sort of digital technology is that it does, by its very nature want to cut out the old middlemen (labels, publicists, etc.) Problem is, the digital technology, the internet, becomes the middleman for the world.  Gentle Jones: What direction do you think American music is heading?  MC Sole: We’ve become so decadent. Our music is escapist and it doesn’t reflect any sort of reality whatsoever. Music helps us make sense of a situation, when the popular culture can’t even communicate what is on people’s minds, their hopes/fears, etc. people ain’t gonna question shit, the power structure stays in place. There are people doing cool music in America, but not many people, what becomes popular is not the good/creative/political stuff... it’s not a good trend.... some of the most successful Indy artists these days are reality stars and YouTube viral celebs... we’re doomed.  Gentle Jones: Where have you found the most receptive audiences to your musical vision, in the U.S. or overseas?  MC Sole: I mean... nothing beats a dope LA show to be honest. For some reason southern California has always been my favorite place to play. That said; yeah consistently Europe, Australia, Japan are always the best shows... I have better shows in Canada then the U.S., typically.... people care about culture overseas and there is a radical infrastructure that supports it... here its Clearchannel or bust....  Gentle Jones: Do you think there is a “homemade” music movement right now?  MC Sole: Is that an official name? Yeah of course, lot of music is being made at home, most of it; it’s been that way for 15 years. There would be no DIY rap movement, no beat scene, no punk bands, etc. were it not for home music, homemade music is without a doubt, the future... motherfuckers don’t need a studio with a million dollars’ worth of great to make an album that will be lucky to sell 200 copies, that’s for sure! When I think of homemade music I think of people like Walter Gross, who are sitting at home making this Woodie Guthrie noise shit, totally original, releasing it on their own, and making more music and not giving a fuck.

183,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/meet-sha-money-xl-s-new-artist-tedy-andreas-zu8SvNdf1UOb8wjwyk8hkg/,"Tedy Andreas acknowledges some of the best rappers of all time are his influences. If he has what it takes to be one? Tedy Andreas is a product of that 90’s hip-hop we all grew up on and love. Hailing from Connecticut, but raised in Houston (which he calls his city), the “Dynasties” rapper stays in his lane for a reason. Each song is equipped with gritty bars and punchlines, spitting nothing but truth from his own life experiences. AllHipHop sat w/ Tedy in Los Angeles to chat about his upbringing, the first album he fell in love with, and the struggle of social media. AllHipHop: Can you talk about your New York influences as opposed to Houston? Tedy Andreas: Growing up, I didn’t get into Houston music until middle school, 8th grade. I actually got into the screw stuff ‘cause a lot of kids were listening to a couple of songs that were famous and big out there. I really dug into it, downloaded a lot of screw tapes. The NY influence was Nas, Mobb Deep, Prodigy. When I was younger, I loved Biggie. I still do. Nas and Hov are my favorite rappers. I was introduced to it at a young age. I was rebelling against a lot of things that were going on. The first album I actually heard was 50 Cent’s Get Rich or Die Tryin’ in 4th grade. My sister’s friend had it at the crib and left it there. I was in elementary school and saw that album everywhere. All of the kids were talking about it and I never heard it. I saw the cover art — when I put it in the CD player, I just fell in love with it. AllHipHop: That’s how I was with The Eminem Show. Tedy Andreas: I like Em too! My favorite rapper early on was 50 Cent, then Jay Z’s Black Album was the next album I got. I remember playing Tony Hawk’s Underground and Nas’ “The World is Yours” was in it. I didn’t know anything about Nas, I was so young. My mom and I were at a pawn shop and the Stillmatic album was there. It said Nas and I was just like “yo mom, I want that.” It was $4 or something, I think it was the edited version. She got it for me. I thought “The World is Yours” was gonna be on it, I didn’t know anything about Nas like that. I just started to listening to him and that song wasn’t on there, but that’s how he became my favorite. I just started studying Nas like crazy. AllHipHop: Can you talk about the irony in Sha Money managing you? Tedy Andreas: Yeah, it’s super ironic. We used to talk about that a lot. It’s crazy. It’s some meant-to-be type s##t.  AllHipHop: Talk about putting on for real hip-hop, real bars and lyrics. Tedy Andreas: It’s just how I always rapped. I love DJ Premier because he’s from Houston and made his name in NY. He was doing his thing, making the boom bap stuff. I didn’t even realize it, it was what I grew up on. I just kept with it over and over again, and getting better and better. I just do my thing. People say I’m putting on for it, which is really dope but it’s not intentional. Either way, it’ll catch on. There’s a lot of ill splitters out here. AllHipHop: You released your “Word Life ” visual. Talk about bringing the record to life. Tedy Andreas: We shot that in March in NY. That song is pretty old, I’ve had it for a minute. We had an idea for the video and The Digggers came out and they shot it. We shot it in Queens, it turned out dope.  AllHipHop: How important is social media for your career? Tedy Andreas: It’s super important and I suck at it. [chuckles] I barely post and people get on my ass all the time. It’s scary how important it is. I’m only 24, but I’m still adjusting. It’s really gotten there. I didn’t grow up with a smartphone. I didn’t get a smartphone until I was in 12th grade. I didn’t really adjust to the times we’re in. I don’t post for a week and people are asking me if I’m okay. I’m realizing this s##t is mad important, just the livelihood. I hate that s##t. I really don’t even like to get on it. When I wake up, I need a cool hour or 2 to chill. I know people that wake up and just check Instagram. It gives me anxiety. I can’t do that. Too many people hitting me up, DMing me. “Yo, I thought you were gonna post that yesterday? What happened?” Nah but in this era, you have to have a strong presence. I need to get better at it. AllHipHop: What can expect music-wise? Tedy Andreas: I’m trying to put out an EP soon. Maybe even a mixtape, I don’t know yet. I’ve just been making a bunch of records. I’m going to keep dropping loosies and videos for now. Hopefully within the next 2 months, I can get a project out. Then I’ll do the actual album. ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912203755.18/warc/CC-MAIN-20190325051359-20190325073359-00319.warc.gz

Stream the entire EP on all platforms here. ""September 2018"" is part of a twelve series EP release project and the music capture a year’s worth of the highs and lows of a relationship. Born in the heart of Los Angeles, the singer-songwriter (and now actor) delivers nothing but smooth, laid-back R&B, full of love, emotion, and heartbreak. AllHipHop caught up with Mila J to discuss going independent, dating in the industry, and new roles in acting. Btw, she's Jhene Aiko's older sister, and good genes definitely run in the family.  AllHipHop: How has your sound evolved over the years? Mila J: I definitely matured vocally. Before, the only people that knew that I sang was my family. I didn’t really publically sing. I was like, “I’ll rap for you, but I’m not singing.” I think every time, every single session, every time somebody made me be like, “No, you’re doing the verse,” it just helped me be way more confident vocally, to where I’m not shy. I can hear myself or listen to myself, and it’s not weird. AllHipHop: What happened with the label? Mila J: Basically, when I was in the groups and still signed to Motown, I ran into the same things a lot of the other artists ran into. It’s like, “Okay, you hurry up and wait.” You’re recording, you’re in all these sessions, but nothing is ever being released. You’re not allowed to release. You can maybe put something on SoundCloud... that whole issue, I went through another drought of music not being able to be released. I went independent after that. Everyone was always like, “Yo, I see you working on the album, how come we don’t get any music?” I decided I just needed to put music out. I was like, “I’m about to give ya’ll music, and I’m going to give it to you every month.”  AllHipHop: On “Business and Pleasure,” you talk about meeting someone in the studio. Talk about being a female in the industry and some of the obstacles you face? Mila J: For sure, that people don’t take you serious. On top of that, when you do have to be stern or put your foot down, you have to worry about being called a “b##ch” or “she’s a diva” — which we shouldn’t have to worry about. When you see men literally having the same behavior as you. Not even being disrespectful, just being stern, knowing what you want and not taking no s##t. But I am a person who cares what people think about me. I don’t want people walking around thinking I’m a b##ch or a diva. For me, it always is that battle because I know for some people, it’s like, “Well I don’t care, yup, label me that.” I don’t want you to label me that, but I’m still going to probably act the same way and be stern and have an opinion. AllHipHop: Where do you get that from? Mila J: I came from a family of all strong women who speak their mind. As far as that part goes, it’s always been natural for me to be comfortable being stern because I was supported like that in the house. I didn’t come from, “Mila, be quiet.” It was like, “No, speak your mind no matter what.” But that obstacle of not being taken serious and people feeling like “who are you” or “are you the girlfriend?” You spoke to every man in the room but you thinking I’m just sitting here just as a… things like that. Other than that, everything else is how you carry yourself is how you’ll get treated. I haven’t really come across a lot disrespect, as far as people feeling like they can do certain things, because I don’t come in with that energy.  ​ AllHipHop: Is it okay to date in the industry? Mila J: The heart wants it wants. I definitely would say it’s not a preference, but it can happen. Wherever you work anywhere, you’re taking a chance. I don’t care if you work at a call center. If you’re dating somebody that you’re seeing every day and then it goes wrong, it’s hard s##t. Ya’ll got to see each other. Any industry you’re in, it’s a small world. It’s not just music. If ya’ll are working at a college, if ya’ll are working at a hospital, you see the drama on Grey’s Anatomy! You’re going to take a chance if you’re dating someone within what you do because if it doesn’t go well, it’s harder to remove the situation. AllHipHop: What are some goals for yourself as an artist? Mila J: Selling out tours! I love traveling. Connecting the people in whatever form. I also don’t see myself just staying in music. I got my feet wet in acting and that whole world, I really love a lot. I love the consistency. I love that lunch is scheduled. I love that you’re protected by a union! And then you just get to be different people. It’s a new world. I’m not this thespian or what not, but I really do like it and see myself getting a lot more into that. AllHipHop: What gigs do you have coming up? Mila J: I shot a film tentatively called ""The Trap,"" with T.I., Mike Epps, Lil Duval, DC Young Fly, Teyana Taylor — she’s really funny in it. They’re all funny. It’s a super dope comedy. Then I did another musical film called Howard High. I don’t know when both of those are coming out, but I’m acting in those. That was fun.

Bringing in strong bars and storytelling in his lyrics combined with his ability to create and hit melodies, the New Jersey native proves his worth in the rap game. Stemming off his debut project Camden released in 2017, named after his hometown in South Jersey, the rapper, real name Jamir Daaliya celebrates a new deal with Empire — ready to unleash music on his own terms. AllHipHop caught up with Fontane during Grammy week in Los Angeles to chat about his Jersey roots and what fans AllHipHop: For those who don’t know, who is Mir Fontane? Mir Fontane: Mir Fontane is just a young rapper coming out of Camden, New Jersey. Trying to impact the culture in a different way and put my stamp in the game before I’m out of here. AllHipHop: What was the inspiration behind your name? Mir Fontane: Mir has always been my nickname. Fontane came from the godfather, Johnny Fontane. He was dealing with the mob but at the same time, he was an aspiring musician and actor. When I first started making music, I knew I wanted to get into movies too. I was also dealing with shady people just like John Fontane, but they wanted the best for me. The same way the mob and the godfather wanted the best for Johnny Fontane. I just adapted the persona. AllHipHop: You’re from Jersey, how does that play into your life and career? Mir Fontane: When you’re from Jersey, you’re kind of playing the game backward. Most people get rich then come to Jersey to live. Jersey has everything and nothing at the same time as far the music scene. Well, South Jersey I can speak for. South Jersey is different from North Jersey. North Jersey has the New York outlet, South Jersey is more so Philadelphia. South Jersey itself doesn’t have any venues, studios, things where you can hone your skills. You have go over to Philadelphia to do your shows. You have that going against you because Jersey doesn’t have an identity of its own in this day and age of music. You gotta find your own in places like New York, Philadelphia, places you can reach. That’s what I built my career off of: just traveling and performing, spreading the word of who I am.  AllHipHop: Do you get more love from Philly or Jersey? Mir Fontane: I can’t even gauge it right now, but Philly definitely showed me love before Jersey. I got mad love for Philly. Jersey probably followed suit after the buzz to the point where people were speculating if I was from Philly. I was over there so much performing. Those in Philly don’t understand we don’t have those resources they have. They’re confused why a lot of us come over there to perform. We had to start our own movement, force the music scene in South Jersey and share it with Philly. It’s been doing well ever since. AllHipHop: What keeps you back home? Mir Fontane: I still have work that I want to get done there. I don’t want to up and leave until I have something cemented in the community that I’m leaving. That way it’s not like I’m just abandoning where I came from or forgetting about it. There’s several things I want to do. Whether it’s purchasing a house in the community, so you’re keeping the money in the community. I take that prideful. I’d rather buy my first house in Jersey before coming to LA and shop for a house. A stay home for everyone here. AllHipHop: You dropped Camden in 2017. How has your sound evolved since? Mir Fontane: I started training my voice now for more melodies. Since Camden is more about growing as an artist both on and off the stage, I’m trying to develop that new sound. Trying not to get too comfortable in my pocket. I like challenging myself and experimenting with different stuff. My influence from my earlier age is starting to peak out now, like the old 70’s Funkadelic stuff we used to listen to. Isley Brothers, The O'Jays type, I’m trying to tap into that more. See where that takes my music. AllHipHop: What was it like seeing Fetty Wap come up out of Jersey? Mir Fontane: When we first saw Fetty Wap come up, it was crazy. But we always seen Jersey as 2 separate states. He’s from North Jersey. North Jersey has been on in our eyes. They had Lauryn Hill, etc. We were always just waiting for somebody from around here to do something in the music industry. It was dope to see Jersey for that moment to be at the top of the game. We had the biggest artist, but we didn’t really take it too personal where we’re from. It was more so an up top type thing.  AllHipHop: You recently unleashed “Real Life Lit.""  Talk about your mindstate creating this one. Mir Fontane: That was more so a collaboration song with my boy JP. We went in there and really didn’t have an idea of what we wanted to do. The producer played the beat, I came up with the first line: “Real life lit, pardon my French, most of these n##gas be real life b##ch.” We just ran with that and called it “Real Life Lit.” How Meek Mill and Wale did the back and forth thing, I always wanted to do that with a couple of people I actually had chemistry with. I was like “let’s just do it now instead of talking about it.” I said “I’m going to start it off.” I wrote my first couple of bars. I was like “we’re not going to do verses.” While I was recording, JP was writing. He stood up, did his, I sat down. Wrote a couple more bars, stood up, recorded. We were just trying to out do each other. Once we got to that sing-songy part, ‘cause we didn’t hear that part of that beat, we were just going off of it. Once it started slowing down, I didn’t know JP had a little melody to him. I was like “we can just loop it and keep rapping,” but he was like “nah, I want sing too.” I let him start off because I knew I wanted to come back in when the beat came back in. We were putting it together on the fly, it didn’t really have a structure. JP is from Jersey too. He’s an up and coming artist from around the way. Just trying to reach out and show love. There’s a lot of talent around there: dope people, dope rappers. AllHipHop: What is your take on the music industry? Mir Fontane: It’s everything I thought it would be. You’ve got your fakes, you’ve got some real people in there. They’re going to try to get you if you’re not paying attention. If you’re not on your P’s and Q’s, you might f##k yourself up for years. I’ve seen it happen to people on the label I just left. It just made me proud of myself for how I carried myself as a youth. I took reading very important. I understood that you need a lawyer, you need to read through contracts. Don’t just jump at every bit of money somebody’s throwing at you. It is what it is. It’s exactly what you think the music industry is.  AllHipHop: What are some goals yourself as an artist at this point of your career? Mir Fontane: I want a Grammy. I need a couple of plaques. I want to eventually come out with this cartoon I’ve been talking about for years. It’s a black hip-hop cartoon. I want to open a Boys & Girls Club type school, but just for music. An afterschool program where I have staff on payroll that are teaching these kids song structure. Teach you how to do Fruity Loops if you want to be a producer. Teach you how make a hook, teach you about melodies, teach you about contracts, all these things so you’re not getting f##ked over. We’ll have all top of the line flat screen Macbooks, desktops. Probably have a basketball court in there. Since we don’t have studios, it’ll be a big place to bring money into the city, but I also want that to franchise into most poverty-stricken, violent neighborhoods. Go from Camden to Chicago, call it Southside Studios or Fontane School of Music. It’ll have a theatre for people, finally have stage for people to perform. Have a spot where all your friends will actually come to. ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912205600.75/warc/CC-MAIN-20190326180238-20190326202238-00263.warc.gz

Coming up out the mud in Memphis, the “Okay"" rapper is a representation of the struggle, and the hope that comes with overcoming adversity. Following the release of numerous successful mixtapes, including ""Federal 3x"" and ""2 Heartless,"" Reset serves as a fresh start from the runaround with labels and industry bullsh##t. Fans can look forward to guest features from J. Cole, Kodak Black, Jeremih, and more.  AllHipHop: Why are you so adamant in remaining independent? Moneybagg Yo: I think it’s better like that. You can just control the situation. Controlling the situation is everything. AllHipHop: What is your take on the music industry? Moneybagg Yo: It’s fake. The industry fake. It is what it is. Just because you get with a label and sign with a label, that doesn’t mean stop. Don’t stop what you do. You still have to pump your campaign. Do what you do. Pump your all into what you do like you’ve been doing. That’s something I had to learn and that’s what Reset comes from. I’m just putting myself back where I was at.  AllHipHop: How long did Reset take you? Moneybagg Yo: It took me like a month, just to put it together. But that’s good! That’s different for me because I usually drop stuff in like 2 weeks. Actually the ""Heartless"" that everybody love, that took off, I did that in 5 or 6 days. Not even a week. [laughs] AllHipHop: What’s the best piece of advice Yo Gotti has given you? Moneybagg Yo: Chase the dream not the money. The bag is going to come. Sometimes, the opportunity is bigger than the bag, so you just have to stay focused on what matters. Like me, I’ll take pay cuts just to pay for the radio, etc. It’s not all about the money to me. I understand the situation. I just put it back into my craft: money off shows, everything.  AllHipHop: Three things you need in the studio? Moneybagg Yo: Drink (Codeine). Weed, of course. I need everybody out the studio. I need nobody in there with me. Because people be all in there and then when they hear you say certain stuff, they’ll be like, “Nah, I think you should say this.” Like I don’t need your opinion. That’s it really. AllHipHop: With the recent deaths of Lil Peep and Mac Miller, are you worried at all about the drug culture that you’re promoting? Moneybagg Yo: You can’t let the drug do you. Rest in peace to those guys, but you can’t let the drug take over you. I don’t abuse the drug. I do it before I go into the studio just to stimulate my mind, help my mind flow. I don’t do it before shows. I have a plan how I do my stuff, I’m not reckless with it. AllHipHop: Someone was just telling me how they can’t record without Percs. Moneybagg Yo: The world is on drugs, to be honest. That’s facts. AllHipHop: What would you be doing if you weren’t doing music? Moneybagg Yo: Probably in the streets somewhere, I ain’t gon’ lie.

I think the most interesting thing about life is that it changes every second literally. Sometimes we can be up and so excited at 5pm and then be down and out by 5:01pm. We never know where life will take us or how it will get us to our goals. I'll never forget I went to an art show with my mom that I didn't want to go to at all. I ended seeing someone who needed help moving sodas so I helped him move them. He ended up being the founder of the whole art show and offered me an internship with them. I was going to school at Lincoln University in Pa at the time and his office was all the way in Mt. Vernon, Ny. I took the internship and would travel there every week to be there. During that time I began to learn what a grind is. The late days and early mornings became the normal. He would let me in on big meetings and introduced me to people I never thought I would network with in years. But the moral of that is I never would've thought helping someone move sodas would help me move forward in life.

191,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/nas-dj-premier-a-countdown-of-their-collaborations-PHsRnnFGtk66xSFgXCQARw/," One of the things discussed in the magazine’s pages was a  future Nas album produced entirely by DJ Premier.  Hip-Hop purists  rejoiced, but the project never materialized. Years passed.  And while it was brought up from time to time, nothing  definitive was ever stated.  However, when Preemo discussed it recently  in Atlanta and said, “It’s coming,” it became clear that enthusiasm for  the LP hadn’t diminished. One of the reasons for this is that Nas and DJ Premier have made  incredible music together.  Therefore, in recognition of their work and  in celebration of the anticipated album, AllHipHop.com has ranked their  collaborations to date. In other words, these are the nine biggest reasons to be excited for  the Nas and DJ Premier album.  It is proof for many as to why this album  can’t come soon enough. 9). “Re:Generation”: Nasir Jones and Chris Martin are not only  legends in Hip-Hop, but they also have an undeniable respect for  culture.  It is fitting then that the two of them were part of the Re:Generation  music project wherein five traditional styles of music were recreated  with contemporary sounds.  The project had DJ Premier creating a track  with classical music and the 58-piece Berklee Symphony Orchestra.   Preemo conducted it himself and then had Nas rap over it.  The resulting  piece of music is nothing short of a great display of artistic  diversity and talent.  8). “N.Y. State of Mind Pt. II”: By the song’s end, it’s clear  that this sequel doesn’t top part one.  However, it does impressively  describe the breakdown of a crew all in the first verse.  Nas’ lyrics  are rich with detail throughout, and DJ Premier’s beat bumps like a  respectable remake of the original.  At the end of the day, it’s the two  of them playing to their strengths.  Ultimately, the record turns out  to be a song sequel that surpasses many others.   7). “Come Get Me”: Because of the reputation that Nastradamus  has as one of Nas’ weaker albums, this song gets overlooked by more  people than it should.  Put simply though, Nas’ delivery is great here.   Plus, with Preemo scratching in Nas’ vocals from Mobb Deep’s “It’s  Mine,” this record is a solid example of dope New York Hip-Hop all the  way around.  It still holds up almost a decade and a half since its  release too.   6). “Represent”: While the chorus to this record is just a  glorified chant courtesy of Nas’ cronies, the real significance of it is  what it symbolizes.  Nas is making a statement that he is here to hold  it down for QB and not only make a better way for himself and his  generation of emcees, but also honor those who came before him such as  Marley Marl and MC Shan. The rhythm of Premier’s beat here is unforgettable and the verses are outstanding.   5). “2nd Childhood”: The commentary that this song provides about not wanting to grow up is very potent.  It is as if Tyrese’s opening words in Baby Boy take  the form of a song.  DJ Premier’s instrumental fit Nas’ lyrical content  perfectly and so the combination of the two make for a great record.   It’s no surprise that Chris Rock mentioned this song specifically while  praising Stillmatic in Rolling Stone back in 2005.   4). “I Gave You Power”: Outlawz member Young Noble told the press  in 2003 that 2Pac got the concept for his “Me and My Girlfriend” record  from this song.  And that’s saying a lot, especially considering that  Nas gets dissed more than once on Makaveli (the same album that contains “Me and My Girlfriend”).  But who could fault Pac for liking this It Was Written joint?   Nas’ rapping from the perspective of a Desert Eagle was very powerful  and it gave him a place to vent his frustrations about the ongoing cycle  of gun violence.   3). “Nas is Like”: This song found Nas returning to his comfort  zone.  However, he was still far from complacent here.  Over a beat that  Premier made using a record he almost threw out, Nasir Jones stepped  away from the commercial sounds that he had recently been dabbling in.   He instead crafted a song that proved he was still capable of making  music like he did at the beginning of his career.   2). “Memory Lane (Sittin’ in Da Park)”: Placed between the singles “Halftime” and “One Love” on Illmatic,  this record masterfully utilizes a Reuben Wilson sample in order to  juxtapose a melody with the bleak inner-city environment that is  described in vivid detail.  “My window faces shootouts, drug overdoses/Live amongst no roses, only the drama…”  Nas and DJ Premier make for one of Hip-Hop’s most memorable pairings, and this song is one of the reasons why.   1). “N.Y. State of Mind”: When Nas first made his introduction on  the rap scene, he was referred to by many as the successor to Rakim.   And so it was only right, that the original God MC be sampled on the  first song from Nas’ debut album.  The combination of Ra’s “Mahogany”  vocal scratch, Preemo’s drums, and those memorable piano keys made for  the perfect soundscape for Nasir Jones to deliver flawless rhymes.  “I never sleep, ’cause sleep is the cousin of death,” is one of the best rap lyrics ever.  [Writer’s Note: I Am…’s “Album Intro,” is not part of this list  because it is not a song.  “Turn up the Mic (DJ Premier Remix),”  “Classic,” and “Hip Hop” aren’t included either because there are more  people attached to those songs than just Nas and DJ Premier.] What do you think of the list?

The highly anticipated blockbuster is “Big” meets “Superman”. It  is a superhero movie, an endearing family film and a heart-felt coming-of-age story all rolled in one.

""Shazam"" is a self-contained origin story, of the super being of the same name, but it does take place in the larger DCEU. There are plenty of of DC character references, Easter eggs, nods to previous events and new surprises. The film also has an excellent John Williams-like score that perfectly fits the heroic tone of the film. As far as Zachary Levi, who plays the hero, there were initial doubts about his casting, his physical stature, his costume, and more. Forget all of that. Zachary Levi completely nails it! He has the charm, charisma, comedic timing, physicality and most importantly, makes you believe that you’re witnessing a child in a grown superhero’s body. Those that know the backstory of Shazam from the comics will understand that, those that don't, will need to find out on their own. The remaining cast all do a great job as well. Jack Dylan Grazer (“Freddy”) in particular almost steals every scene he’s in – He and Zach have excellent chemistry. In terms of the action, there are awesome sequences of Shazam being heroic in various life-saving situations as well as several great fights and battles that all roll into an action packed climax. Very Impressive.
 If there's a down side, ""Shazam"" tends to move a bit slow in the first act to set up the backstory of Dr. Sivana and Billy Batson, the super guy's alter-ego. But once that's established, nonstop laughs and action ensue. Also, if you're not familiar with the character and tend to favor superheroes, of a darker flair (and I don't mean melanin), you have to know going in that Shazam is the polar opposite of that. The comic book nature of Shazam embodies bigheartedness, gut-busting hilarity and over the top fun. With that said, the movie still has enough scares, magical elements and exciting action scenes to provide plenty of edge and excitement. This film truly has something for everyone regardless of age or style of comic book movie you prefer. It’s a charming superhero film that's humorously self-aware but also very clever in its execution. I highly recommend checking this one out! Lastly, there are TWO post credit scenes so stay seated! ✌🏿 ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912203755.18/warc/CC-MAIN-20190325051359-20190325073359-00374.warc.gz

Whether it’s joints or Backwoods, the Louie the XIII marijuana strand stands by its slogan “Quality Is King.” If you like joints, his 100% organic, pesticide free, hand-rolled, indica dominant hybrids will have you living your best life. Now, he brings that same energy into the rap game, creating his own Original Louie Studios in downtown LA and even building a small independent record label right out of this glorious space. While most growers say they have the best weed, Louie’s reputation in LA does not go unnoticed. In fact, if you’ve seen Ty Dolla $ign perform in the city you may have seen Louie up on stage with him at countless shows in the past. Now, he teams up with Snoop Dogg for his first single as a producer, “Picc Up The Bands.” AllHipHop caught up with Louie during the music video shoot at Snoop’s compound in Inglewood.  AllHipHop: How did you fall in love with marijuana? OG Louie: I’ve been in the game for a minute. Shit, how did I fall in love with marijuana? When I was 13 years old and I took my first hit. That's where Louie XIII comes from. AllHipHop: What sets your weed apart from the other brands? OG Louie: I got the best growers on my team. That's about it, hands down. I got the best product out there. AllHipHop: Talk about being a former DJ and your love for music. OG Louie: Oh man. When I was younger, I used to deejay. I love music. I always had the turntables and everything. I did my thing here and there. When I started the marijuana brand, I just jumped back into the music. I built me a studio. I started working with producers, getting beats together. Artists started coming around, so I started putting artists on beats. Right now, I got an album that I'm working on, but I’m probably going to drop single after single. AllHipHop: You’re not actually producing, you’re executive producing? OG Louie: I’m executive producing but, also I am producing. AllHipHop: Was “Picc Up The Bands” your beat? OG Louie: Yes, purchased. It's my beat and I helped, so it's mine. [laughs]  AllHipHop: Talk about your relationship with Snoop. How did you guys link initially? OG Louie: I have a great relationship with Snoop. I’ve known Snoop for about 13, 14 years. Just a very cool dude. When he came across my product, it became a great connection. We started talking again. Next thing you know, he loves my product and he smokes it damn near everyday. AllHipHop: He has his own strain right? OG Louie: I think he does have his own strain or he’s working with somebody. They’re doing something but right now that I know of, he has a couple of favorite strains that he loves to smoke. AllHipHop: But that's interesting because he loves to smoke your weed. OG Louie: Oh definitely. People do love to smoke quality and I'm known as the guy with the best quality out there.  AllHipHop: Talk about the shooting the visual here at his compound for “Picc Up The Bands.” OG Louie: It was for what was going to be an album, but now I’m just going to drop singles. First single I’m gonna drop is “Picc Up The Bands” featuring Snoop Dogg. After that my second one that is going to drop is going to be with K Camp. I got Sada Baby, Tyga gonna be on it. Shout out to Jay Rock for just winning that Grammy.  AllHipHop: Is he on there too? OG Louie: He’s going to be on it. Shit, I got quite a few people. Kap G. I had a joint from Dave East, but he’s going to take it for his album. That's going to be one of my first placements right there. He a monster. AllHipHop: They all come through LA right? OG Louie: Everybody comes to LA. AllHipHop: Can you talk about your studio downtown. OG Louie: Oh yeah, I got a studio. Instagram is @lastudio13
<https://www.instagram.com/lastudio13/>. You can definitely rent the studio. It has a great vibe. Great munchies in there, everybody loves those. Everybody’s that came has always came back. I’ve had big names in there renting it out. It’s pretty crazy ‘cause I be shocked like “wow, he’s in my studio right now recording,” but I can’t mention names because… yeah. AllHipHop: Can you talk about your vision with the independent label? OG Louie: You could say I’ma be the DJ Khaled, but in the marijuana game and the music game, because I definitely work with some great producers. I’m working with very talented artists and also a lot of new talent that’s coming out. It's gonna be a beautiful thing. AllHipHop: Talk about how the video came together. OG Louie: We got it together with LOUIEKNOWS.
<https://www.instagram.com/louieknows/?hl=en> He’s done a lot of videos. I heard he does some of the best work right now so I hit him up, we sat down, lined everything up with Snoop. We went in and just shot it today. We just called it a rap about 20 minutes ago. AllHipHop: How many joints did you smoke during it? OG Louie: I don't even know, but I got cottonmouth right now like a motherf##ker. AllHipHop: Is there anything else you want us to know? OG Louie: Follow my Instagram @oglouiethexiii.

195,allhiphop.com,rap,https://allhiphop.com/features/og-spice-1-talks-the-migos-wack-100-and-the-politics-of-respect-in-hip-hop-mpM99FGHJEKpABiZltbojg/,"(AllHipHop Features) As we rolled into the 2000’s the west coast hip-hop scene had taken a backseat to other regions. Fast forward to 2019 and we are seeing a resurgence from the Westside of the nation. Los Angeles native, Jay Rock recently won a Grammy and Nipsey Hussle was nominated for one, officially solidifying the revival of west coast rap. There are also several young budding stars and veterans who are putting the quality of life back on the hip-hop scene in California. However, long before, Jay Rock was “winning” and Nipsey Hussle was taking his “Victory Lap,” Hayward, California produced Spice 1 (Sex, Pistols, Indo, Cash and Entertainment). A brash, street O.G. who’s lyrics mimicked the meaning of his name. Spice, was discovered in the late 80’s by Too Short, a popular emcee out of the Bay area. At the time of Tupac’s death, Spice 1 was collaborating on a “One Nation” album with the fallen star. Despite several studio albums, Spice’s notoriety came from his hit song, “Trigga Gots No Heart,” which was featured on the Menace II Society Soundtrack and later added to his “187 He Wrote,” album. Now, his focus is solely concentrated on his new record label, “Thug World Music Group,” and his first artist, “Q Bosilini.” I had a chance to catch up to the west coast legend to discuss the record label, what he’s looking for in an artist and his ongoing feud with manager, Wack 100 as well as the popular group, Migos. AllHipHop.com: What’s up with you, OG? Spice 1: Man, it’s good. Just holding shit down. I’m trying to get “Thug World” [Music Group] off the ground. I’m trying to get something going as far as selling these records and doing something big. Making something happen real big with “Thug World.” AllHIpHop.com: You were discovered by Too Short, now you’re in a position to recruit talent. What has that process been like and what are you looking for in an artist? Spice 1: I just look for talent straight up. There is a difference in somebody being able to do something and being really-really good at something and when somebody has talent at doing something. Michael Jordan have talent. Allen Iverson have talent in the things that they do. That’s what I’m looking for. I look for that in my artist as far as that eye of the tiger syndrome and shit. As far as them being talented and being able to attract a world- wide audience and entertaining the fans. As long as they are entertaining and talented, I could work with them. If they can build a nice fan base then I can push them and promote them and try and get it poppin. AllHipHop.com: I’m sure some are surprised that your first artist isn’t from the west coast. Tell us about Q Bosilini. Spice 1: I always be thinking like, “I got a record label.” I’m not going to hold no bars on where my talent comes from. This is a business. As far as where my talent comes from… that doesn’t matter. I came from a place nobody ever heard of called, Hayward, California. I’m doing quite well as a Hayward nigga. Wherever you’re from, it don’t matter where you’re from it just matters who you are and if you’re good at your craft and if you’ve mastered your craft. If you can attract fans, that’s really all you need and a little bit of luck. Luck plays a part in this shit too. You don’t just blow up. I done seen them put $50 and $60,000 and close to a half-a-million dollars behind an artist and the shit don’t go nowhere. I don’t know where that nigga at today and I done a song with him. And this is 10-years later type shit. It all depends on if they are entertaining or not and if they have a wide following hell yeah. AllHipHop.com: Ice Cube once rapped on Scarface’s “Hand of the Dead Body,” “Gangsta N-I-P, Spice 1 or Tupac never gave a gun to me.” That seemed like forever ago and yet you’re still here, still in the game, what are the keys to your longevity? Spice1: I couldn’t tell you, man. On some real sh#t, I feel like I’m a part of Hip-Hop. I came from break dancing, graffiti on the walls and trying to DJ. The whole five elements of hip hop, I haven’t mastered them all, but I have tried them all and the one I was the best at was rapping. With all of that said, I am hip hop. I am a part of Hip-Hop. I can’t go anywhere. This is me. It’s a part of my life, I’m a part of hip hop and I’m not going to let them have no rap game without me. I ain’t going nowhere without my bag either. I could sit here and do my music and push my record label, but at the end of the day, I’m trying to make my bag. When I first came into this industry, writing my songs and making my music, I wasn’t in it for the money. But now, I kind of am. I’m pushing my record label and I’m trying to get my money now. Back in the day I didn’t feel like I got my fair chance at getting my bag because I had so many people in my way and the people that I trusted wasn’t really down with me. People that I thought would be down with me now not down with me like I thought they would be. So, it brought new meaning to me putting a “1” at the end of my name. It means a whole lot more. It’s crazy right now with me and the label and everything. I’m heading into uncharted waters as far as being a record label CEO. And we gangsta all the way. We ain’t trying to be gangsta, our opinion on shit is gangsta. We pushing, man as far as what the record label is doing. Hopefully we are a real success in the years to come. AllHipHop.com: You have been very vocal as far as the situation with Wack 100 and the situation with Migos. I definitely wanted to give you a chance to speak on those situations. Spice 1: This is what these younger guys gotta understand, we are them 10 to 15-years from now. We are them and they are us, we the same. So, how can they expect for a nigga like me to not say nothing. What the f##k? Soulja Boy was saying sh#t about anybody saying something. For them to expect for me not to say nothing… especially for the sh#t that Wack 100 was saying about Pac and his momma, I guess he just thought a motherf#cker was going to let him slide with that sh#t. You think you ni##as could walk around and say, “I’m the shit. Fuck all these ni##as. They weren’t the sh#t, but we the shit now,” and completely disrespect our legacy and expect for us to fade away quietly into the fucking night, they got a goddamn problem. They got a whole other motherf##king problem. They got life and bullsh#t f##ked up if they think that we… well, me is going to fade quietly away in the night without my motherf##king bag. AllHipHop.com: I loved the point you made about Migos claiming to be better than Bone Thugs N Harmony, but you said, Bone has a song with Biggie and Tupac. That’s big time. Not to mention Phil Collins. Spice 1: And Eazy-E brought them in the game. They ain’t been around nothing but bosses the whole time and all of their fans, they have a cult following. They fans have been their fans for like 30-years. You can’t compare 2-years of fame to 30-years of fans. That’s hypocritical and something an idiot would do. AllHipHop.com: You also are not letting anyone get shots off on Tupac at all. Spice 1: It’s just so fucked up. I would never want anyone to be able to do that to me. When I’m gone, some old bitch ass nigga, some old Barney Rubble looking ass nigga, try to come out of the blue and fade my legacy and get away because he’s a bitter motherfucker for no reason. Especially if I didn’t even know the nigga before I died. I don’t even know the motherfucker and he don’t know me. I hit him [Wack 100] up when he first dissed, Pac like that. I hit him up and I tried to talk to him. I was on some, “Hey man, that’s my potna, man. Chill out. I see you mad and you might be in your feelings or whatever, but just chill. That’s my potna. If you cool with me then chill, my nigga.” He never responded and I hit him with that shit months ago the first time he said some shit. Now because I said something to him, he in his feelings, but nigga, I tried to get at you the right way. I tried to come at you like a black man, but now you going to make a nigga act ignorant because you out here talking that shit and you didn’t respond to me. But with the Migos, it wasn’t really directed towards the Migos. It was just directed towards motherf##kers that be wearing dresses and fingernail polish and shit. I’m lost. I’m like, what the f##k are you niggas doing? And the word f#g, that’s just a word when I’m pissed off. I don’t mind gay motherf##kers. Let gay motherfuckers be gay, that’s more women for us. I’m not hating on gay people. When I’m pissed off and I start talking bout shit, my words just become what the fuck I want to say. I’m gangsta with the shit. I didn’t mean to offend no gays or no shit like that. A fag is a different thing. These niggas are f#gs. They walking around acting like they straight, but they gay. That’s a f#g. A gay person is a gay person who says, “Hey man, I’m gay.” But a f#g is a motherf##ker who tries to keep the shit on the under, like the b#tch did with Young Buck. That’s f#g shit right there. That’s a f#g. That kind of sh#t, like I’m a dress like a gay motherf##ker, but I ain’t gay, but people going to call me that and I just need attention. What really pissed me off is that they call themselves thugs. When they said that, now they coming into my motherfucking category; with me and Tupac, Thug Life and The Outlaws. Them niggas is not us. They not us. Them ni##as is not us. They want to say thugs, they not thugs, they some other sh#t. Half of the thugs is dead. It’s only a few riding around this motherf##ker. That was my whole point. I wasn’t disrespecting gay motherf##kers. But I will disrespect a fa##ot ass ni##a though with that bullsh#t. Just like the ni##a did Young Buck. Ni##as like that, who dress up like a bitch and try to fool a ni##a. “He like men.” Ni##a he didn’t know you were a goddamn man. He had no f##king idea. That’s f#g shit right there. “Thug World” is in this motherf##ker trying to make it happen. We are welcoming all entertainers and anybody with some good talent that can attract a crowd, get this sh#t poppin and come f#ck with us. We over here trying to push your sh#t and we going to keep this sh#t real. “Thug World,” ni##as, this is really-really thug world, so stay tuned. Here's some of the back history on the beef with Spice 1 and Wack 100.     GTFOHWTBS ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202658.65/warc/CC-MAIN-20190322115048-20190322141048-00463.warc.gz

But, the movie is so much more and truly challenges Hollywood tradition. “Sorry To Bother You” will force audiences to think deeply about the systems capitalism U.S. has created that have allowed for the rich to get richer off of the backs of the poor, disenfranchised people.

The institution's founders Ron Clark & Kim Bearden, Oprah, and RCA's very own students sourced so much inspiration as they shared testimonials of students who had gone on to do amazing things after graduating from the school as well as families who'd been impacted by and helped by the institution. Since 2007, over 45,000 teachers, administrators, and superintendents have participated in the school's professional development programs to learn how to replicate its student engagement and philosophy model in their own schools. These educators have gone on to impact the lives of over 10 million students around the word by returning to their classrooms with the training received at RCA. ​ ​  Photo credit: Ron Clark Academy The 10th anniversary celebration was an action-packed evening of musical performances and special guest appearances. The peak of the evening was Oprah announcing her donation of $5 million towards the school's $15 million dollar capital campaign goal. The campaign's central focus is the creation of the Ryan Marshall Performing Arts Center, a 32,000 square foot multi-purpose facility that will help the school train 150,000 teachers over the next 10 years. ""We are extremely honored that Oprah Winfrey served as the host for our anniversary event. What better way to commemorate this special time in our history than with an electric, fun-filled evening that truly harnesses the energy, love, and passion for learning that our staff, students, and visiting educators have generated over the past decade,"" said Ron Clark. Throughout the celebration, several organizations gave some pretty large gifts to the campaign. Georgia power gave $750,000, the Coca-Cola Foundation gave $500,000, BB&T gave $500,000, and NanoLumens gave $1.5 million. We can't wait to see the next group of leaders that the Ron Clark Academy produces! ​ Always helping white organizations and ignoring your own people in Chicago. In my opinion no love for Harpo.

It's sad that in today's music world we're not used to hearing real live vocals anymore however Mack has mastered the art-form. He's polished and has the entire showmanship aspect to performing down pat. We'd be remiss if we didn't discuss the fact that he had women of all ages on the verge of fainting! From what we observed, this kid is the entire package and he sat down with AllHipHop.com to discuss everything that is going on. So please check out our interview with Mack Wilds! AllHipHop.com: So Mack, TV, Movies and now Music, which one has challenged you the most in terms of conquering the art form? Which would you say has shown you the most about yourself? Hmm... It would probably be music. Mainly because of the stigma actors who go into music tend to have. Also, because I write a lot of the music, there's a level of soul searching needed to do something real. AllHipHop.com: What has been your favorite part of putting together this new project? What's the title of it and who worked on it with you? Well, the album is called New York: A Love Story. It was put together by myself, Salaam Remi, Pete Rock, DJ Premier, James Poyser, Havoc from Mobb Deep, Bink!, James Fauntleroy, Ne-Yo, Rico Love, and features from Method Man, Raekwon, and Doug E. Fresh. So as you see, my favorite part was actually creating the songs. (Laughs) AllHipHop.com: Sir! That is mos def a who's who of a music list that you have going on there! It may have been easier to ask who you didn't work with! Okay dope, so then let us ask this, what do you hope the listeners get from checking out your music? I hope they understand that there's a new kid in town. And he's not playing around. AllHipHop.com: Wow you're putting folks on notice! We can dig it. Can you give us 5 words that best describe you as an artist? Fresh, Real, Dope, Intriguing, Intricate. AllHipHop.com: Intricate is a great word! Nice...tell us, what is one thing that you wish the fans knew about you that you know they are in the dark about? Follow up, are there any misconceptions out there about you that drive you crazy? Knew about me? Nah. Let the music speak. You'll learn more about me from there. The only misconception I had was about where I'm from. And of course, I'm from New York.  Speaking of you being from New York, let's take a look at ""Own It"". We understand the Album is dropping on 9-17 as a tribute to the 917 and you've got the city as a co-star in the video! AllHipHop.com: Where have you found your greatest source of inspiration? Can that inspiration be found in your music?  I draw inspiration from everything, be it my family and friends, my relationships and environments I'm around, or different forms and pieces of art I come across. It all comes together and is shown through the music, the characters I play, or any other way I creatively express myself.  AllHipHop.com: You have your fingers in almost every pot of the entertainment industry and therefore are always entertaining people in one way or another. Tell us, what do you for entertainment?  I write, I take pictures, I play video games, watch cartoons. I'm really a big kid at heart! Mainly just have fun. AllHipHop.com: What excites you the most about the idea of singing live in front of crowds? What scares you the most about the idea of singing live in front of crowds? The same thing that excites me, scares me as well. It's the reaction. There's an energy they give you on that stage whether you do good or bad. I always just pray for the good. AllHipHop.com: Oh yes we completely understand that one! Lastly, what's next up for Mack Wilds and how can the fans keep up with you and what you're working on? More music. More films. Just more art as a whole. And the best way to stay updated would be my Instagram @MackWilds or [twitter-follow screen_name=""MACKWILDS""] .

Grouchy Greg: How did you link with Snoop? Martellus Bennett: I was in L.A. doing some press and I dropped by to do Snoop's YouTube show GGN Network and whole the crew was giving me a tour. They were like ""Snoop is actually in the studio right now, do you wanna go back there?"" And of course, I was like ""yeah,"" walked in and he was working on some music.  When he stopped for a quick break, I was like ""we should do a song together."" He kind of laughed it off like ""hahaha you funny,"" and ""I was like nah I'm serious bruh."" He was like ""you rap?"" I said, ""yeah man I got a few bars."" He said ""let's do it then"" and we went thru a few beats, picked one, I pulled out my pen and notebook, and [the single] ""Take A Flight"" was born. Grouchy Greg: What was it like recording with Snoop?  ""Working with Snoop was easy. He's a great dude. I was a little nervous because he rapped first and it was smooth as f##k.""  Martellus Bennett: Like butter melting on the instrumental. After he rapped I threw out my first verse and wrote what you hear now. He was dope to work with, I think he was pleasantly surprised, because he came in the booth when I was struggling with my wordplay in one section and said ""You got this, you got bars. Which is very true. I do have bars!""​ ​Grouchy Greg: How long have you been rapping and releasing music? Martellus Bennett: This is my seventh musical project. I'll release two or three more this year. I grew up in band playing different instruments and stuff and I've always rapped as long as I can remember. Grouchy Greg: What makes you different than the other athletes who have dropped mixtapes? Martellus Bennett: I don't know. I don't consider myself a rapper, I just try to express myself and my creativity in as mediums as possible. This is just me creating. Take a listen to Martellus Bennett's new mixtape ""Polka Dots: The Mixtape"" below.  ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202728.21/warc/CC-MAIN-20190323060839-20190323082839-00421.warc.gz
