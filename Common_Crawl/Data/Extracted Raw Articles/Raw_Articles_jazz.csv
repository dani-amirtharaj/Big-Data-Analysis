3,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/betweenthegrooves/jazz-fest-diary-john-ellis-at-louisiana-music-factory/,"John Ellis Jazz Fest week doesn’t really kick in until the start of the Louisiana Music Factory’s in-store performances. It’s a tradition that goes back 18 years, to when the French Quarter CD and vinyl outlet opened its doors on North Peters, around the corner from its current digs on Decatur Street.

Tenor saxophonist John Ellis and Double-Wide kicked off the 2010 lineup Thursday in great form, with music drawn from the New York/New Orleans jazzer’s recently released Puppet Mischief and earlier recordings.

Ellis was joined by irrepressible tuba man and Jazz Fest MVP Matt Perrine, playing a silver sousaphone with a mic mask-taped to its bell; pianist Brian Coogan, using a well-worn instrument, its innards exposed; and drummer Simon Lott, filling in for Jason Marsalis.

The saxophonist’s music isn’t neatly categorized. “Dubinland Carnival,” with its alternating currents of light and sadness, and breaks for waltz time, felt like lost European circus music, suitable for a Fellini circus-style music.

“Fauxfessor,” as its name suggests, was a slab of funk and vintage R&B that nodded to New Orleans piano professors. Ellis leaned into the tune’s bluesy lines, and Coogan led Perrine and Lott in some rhythmic stretching, breaking up and reassembling, his phrases hinting at Thelonious Monk.

The hourlong set, pumped up by Lott’s revved-up, interactive drumming, also included the softly swaying, somber ballad “Prom Song,” which featured Perrine’s surprisingly melodic and unsurprisingly (for the sousaphonist) fluent  and beautiful solo; and the rollicking, color-shifting “Okra and Tomatoes.” Perrine, all over the place during Jazz Fest, is also celebrating a new release with his Sunflower City band, “Bayou Road Suite” on Threadhead Records.

Day One of the LMF in-store shows also included a performance by New Orleans blues man Spencer Bohren, who elicited haunting sounds from his acoustic lap slide guitar on “Ode to Billie Joe,” “People Get Ready” and “The Long Black Line,” an elegiac response to Katrina that served as the title track for his 2006 CD.

As with everything else related to New Orleans music, Jazz Fest has had a dramatic affect on the success of LMF, store owner Barry Smith said. Old favorites Tower Records, Virgin Records and Record Ron’s are long gone. A new Peaches Records is located in the old Tower store, but it’s yet to become a local favorite.

“If it weren’t for Jazz Fest, I would never have made it thus far,” said Smith, who estimates that 20 percent – or more – of his annual income derives from sales that take place during fest season. “Jazz Fest is instrumental in bringing New Orleans music to music fans all over the world. So many of our customers come back year after year.”

The in-store shows at LMF pick up again on Monday.

4,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/cadenza/goodmans-bad-movie/,"At summer camp in 1960, when it rained too hard for outdoor activities, the campers were herded into a rec building to watch 16 mm movie rentals.  One night we were subjected to The Benny Goodman Story, released five years earlier.  Even at that tender age, we knew we were seeing something we shouldn’t:  proof that grownups were hopelessly addled.  In later years, I heard many people who had caught it on TV parrot the line, “Fletch, would you hold this for me, please,” which Steve Allen’s Benny says to Sammy Davis Sr.’s Fletcher Henderson as he hands him his clarinet so he can race off to talk Donna Reed’s Alice Hammond and filmgoers everywhere into a coma.

Still, when Universal recently released it on DVD at a bargain price, I bought it in a flash, thinking, ah, at least the three-strip Technicolor will be restored and there’s all that good music and screwy jive-Gene Krupa actually suspends his gum-chewing to say of BG, “Yeah, he’s a mean man on that licorice stick.”  Well, forget it.  I realize now with a renewed empathy why, on the occasion when I asked him about it, Goodman scowled, turned red and changed the subject.  Even the cropped transfer is lousy.  During one number all you see of Krupa is his right shoulder.

As is often the case with bad old movies, however, this one has value as an anthropological relic, a Dead Sea Scroll of the era when jazz was entombed in a supercilious nostalgia fed by poor memory and self-importance.  The latter emanated chiefly from screenwriter Valentine Davies, who began his film career by selling a story for the 1942 Syncopation, which told how jazz came up the river via white orchestras (Goodman, Krupa, Harry James), while the black Hall Johnson Choir sang “Slave Market.”  He scripted a dozen or so films, among them The Glenn Miller Story, in which June Allyson pouts, “Oooh, Glenn Miller, you are the strangest boy!”  But he directed only the movie at hand, displaying the eye of Ed Wood Jr.  One band number is shot entirely from behind the musicians.  At least you get to hear Stan Getz on the soundtrack.

The Benny Goodman Story is dedicated to exposing highbrow snobs who look down on hot music (the word jazz, by my count, is heard only once), but it ends up doing the snobs’ work for them by pickling the swing era in a cocoon of weary condescension.  It gives the game away during the credits: The score begins with Goodman’s band swinging 16 bars of “Let’s Dance,” only to drown in a symphonic mood-enhancement-crashing cymbal, massed brasses, weepy strings.  It’s an arrangement that all but shouts: “Swing was fun, but for serious, substantive, soothing music, ain’t nothing like good old Hollywood hackwork.”  God must have agreed to rock ‘n’ roll after seeing this picture.

As the work of Hollywood liberals, the movie never mentions Goodman’s valor in racially integrating his trio; in this version of American history, his band was mixed from the start, by Buck Clayton of all people.  Yet Benny is a visionary:  “I have a few ideas.  I don’t know if they’re crazy.”  You want to tell the poor sap, “They’re not so crazy, Benny.  They worked for Henderson, Webb and Ellington-they can work for you too!”  But oy, de vay dey treat Jews is verse even den de colored, alla dem bed ector people doing shtick from The Goldbergs.  “From love I know,” Mama Goodman advises Steve Allen, who exudes the charisma of a clarinet reed with glasses.  She don vant her bagel-Benny to marry a caviar shicksa until suddenly she does.  So go figure.

The wildest scene occurs when Benny discovers jazz on a riverboat, standing about two inches from Kid Ory’s slide.  Kid tells him that half his boys can’t read:  “You just swing on out and play the way you feel.”  Benny asks to sit in, and damn!-first time out, at 15, he plays exactly like Benny Goodman.  Every time Benny says anything in favor of hot music, someone declaims, “Don’t be that way!”  Rehearsing for the 1938 Carnegie Hall concert, which his brother tells him to cancel although the place is sold out, Benny decides to use the phrase as a song title, apparently unaware that Chick Webb recorded tune and title (by Edgar Sampson) four years earlier.  Meanwhile, suspense builds:  Donna Reed, as the jazz-hating scold, Alice (the real Alice was a fan, not to mention married), is on a plane:  Will she get to the concert in time?

The Benny Goodman Story is a postcard from an era when jazz could engender a middlebrow entertainment as long as it was sentimentalized into banality.  Just as all modern jazz films have the same plot-a black genius fights drugs, liquor, racism and bad weather, and dies-all the swing-inspired movies concerned wrong-side-of-the-tracks white guys who fought old-world prejudices against pop music and emerged as national idols who will live forever even if, like Glenn Miller, they are blown to kingdom come.  It’s a tedious way to learn a useful lesson:  Denatured reverie is no better than patronizing disdain.

5,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/cadenza/oliver-overhauled/,"The conductor Otto Klemperer once said, “Listening to a recording is like going to bed with a photograph of Marilyn Monroe.” Recordings have long been demonized-accused of destroying amateurism and live music, promoting soul-killing perfectionism, cheapening appreciation. The jeremiads have a grain of truth, but only a grain. We would no more give up on recordings than we would electric light. For one thing, they define the difference between Buddy Bolden, a subject of eternal speculation, and King Oliver, the object of eternally strained ears.

The strain has just gotten easier. Archeophone, the indispensable company that resurrected the complete Bert Williams a few years back, is distributing one of the most vital jazz reissues in many years: King Oliver Off the Record: The Complete 1923 Jazz Band Recordings. The careful title reminds us that only the Gennett sides were credited to King Oliver’s Creole Jazz Band; “Creole” was dropped for the selections he made for OKeh, Columbia and Paramount. Here they are: all 37 tracks in presumed chronological order and in startlingly resonant audio transfers. Given the tradition of Oliver mastering breakthroughs, I wouldn’t bet a nickel that these CDs will remain the last word in audio redemption forever and ever-just for the next few decades. All earlier editions are now obsolete.

According to engineer Doug Benson, who co-produced with annotator David Sager, he elaborated on a method pioneered by the lamented John R. T. Davies. When I visited Davies 15 years ago, he explained that the grooves of 78-rpm discs contain more information than is usually retrieved, especially in the groove walls, which an ill-fitting stylus will not fully engage. His solution was to make a stylus that snugly fit the grooves of a particular disc. He excoriated the kind of digitalization used by major labels, which sacrifices musical information, especially in high and low frequencies, to blot out surface noise and create a “modern” sanitized sound.

Of course, to mine the details, you need good copies of the originals. Benson provides documentation of his success in finding the best 78s (more than half are graded excellent or better), crafting more than a dozen styli (he gives the size of each and whether it is elliptically or conically truncated), and correcting pitch with playback speeds ranging fractionally from 78 to 81 rpm. The result is a kind of time machine, only better: What was it like to buy, in 1923, a brand new platter of, say, “Weather Bird Rag” and “Dipper Mouth Blues,” and play it at home for the first time? Chances are your gramophone and stylus would not have been as good as Benson’s.

The main thing this set restores is presence, ambience-the very thing that early digitalization removed. I recall the horrified response of Erroll Garner’s manager, Martha Glazer, when she heard the first Garner CD on Columbia. “They made him sound as if he didn’t swing,” she said; an exaggeration, I thought, until I heard it. The brittle, processed, midrange sound emanated from a vacuum that shortchanged his momentum along with overtones and spatial resonance. Swing thrives on resonance, and that’s what this Oliver set recovers after nearly 85 years. One aspect of Oliver’s music that distinguishes it from other New Orleans ensembles is its massed charge, its rhythmic unity. His best performances sustain a proud vertiginous energy, whether the tempo is slow (“Riverside Blues”), medium (“Working Man Blues”), or up (“Snake Rag”).

With these transfers, the massed force gives way to something more human: The band sounds like real musicians in a real place-breathing, thinking, interacting. At the same time, greater resonance increases the group’s rocking and rolling certainty. For one example, consider the prosaic chimes strain in “Chimes Blues,” two blues choruses where Lillian Hardin plays piano triads against the ensemble’s first-beat-of-the-measure chords. I usually roll my eyes with impatience, waiting for it to end and Louis Armstrong’s magnificent trio recitation to begin. Never again: The augmented ringing of the piano and its palpable relation to the ensemble underscores the swinging forthrightness of the passage, now revealed as an agreeably coherent setup for Armstrong.

In the same passage, I am now struck by the dense written flurry of brasses at the turnback between Lil’s choruses. Returning to previous transfers of this music, I could hear that the turnback was always there, always audible, but I had never much noticed it: a lovely two-bar detail. I found myself going back often to LPs and older CDs to check details that had previously escaped my attention. I could always find them. But then the music was hardly impenetrable: Four decades ago, Gunther Schuller transcribed Oliver’s three-chorus trio solo on the Paramount “Mabel’s Dream” and (even more impressively) Oliver’s lead and Armstrong’s obbligato in the first trio chorus of the Gennett “Mabel’s Dream.”

I wonder if even, or especially, Schuller might not uncover overlooked facets in the Archeophone discs. The biggest surprise concerns the Paramount session, once dim, now bolstered with electrifying sharpness-possibly, the producers speculate, because they were recorded electrically in the first place. I marvel anew at the work of each participant. Never did Johnny Dodds sound more warmly personal and evocative than on “Canal Street Blues,” “Dipper Mouth Blues,” “Sweet Lovin’ Man” and “Buddy’s Habit.” How unfairly neglected was Honore Dutrey, whose phrases once struck me as sentimental but now seem witty, knowing, at times almost sardonic. He is variously a rhythmic enabler (“Canal Street Blues”), rock of support (“Froggy Moore”) and formidable lead-his twisty glissandi and boozily whimsical playing on “Tears” is a perfect foil for Armstrong’s nine mind-bending breaks.

Another point clarified here is Oliver’s desire to shift to a weightier big-band style three years before he launched his Dixie Syncopators. Whatever other reasons Oliver had for enlisting Armstong, he clearly relished the opulence Louis brought to the band, his presence indicating a transition from standard New Orleans polyphony to a more cosmopolitan orchestration. That shift is underscored at the last Gennett session with the addition of Stump Evans on C-melody saxophone (possibly doubling on bass saxophone, too), and at the OKeh session with the recruitment of the mysterious trigger-happy bass saxophonist Charlie Jackson. On “I Ain’t Gonna Tell Nobody,” Oliver’s team jets into the zone between embellished and written music, on a flight no one else quite matched.

6,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/cadenza/pilgrims-progress/,"When he had the wind in his sails, which was pretty often during a tragically curtailed career (he died at age 33 from complications incurred in a car accident), Chu Berry was a terror. Few musicians combine, as effortlessly and consistently as he, fearless aggression with sensible demeanor. Jazz in the prewar era was often a high-wire act. If all you got to show for yourself in a three-minute record was eight or 16 bars, you wanted to make the most of it, a situation that called for creativity, coordination and concentration. Berry took every cue as a challenge, restively running up against the waves, not unlike his most constant and inspired partner, the firebrand Roy Eldridge. We follow each of them with the slightly inflamed pleasure we get watching a great athlete, certain that he is having the time of his life and vicariously sharing in his daring.

Mosaic has released Classic Chu Berry Columbia and Victor Sessions, an anthology of the tenor saxophonist’s best work, excepting a 1935 Red Norvo session for Columbia, which is in Mosaic’s Bunny Berigan box; Count Basie’s “Lady Be Good” (on Decca); and the indispensable Commodores (decisive alliances with Eldridge and Hot Lips Page), which Mosaic released long ago as part of its in toto presentation of that label’s catalog, now way overdue for a reissue series. Don’t miss this one. If you have been collecting jazz records for any length of time, you almost certainly have some of its contents-sessions by Fletcher Henderson, Cab Calloway, Gene Krupa, Wingy Manone, Lionel Hampton, Henry Allen, Teddy Wilson, Mildred Bailey and others. Get it anyway. Chu (pardon the informality, but who can resist that name?) recorded for only eight years, and this set is both a panorama of the 1930s and a Pilgrim’s Progress with a hero who brakes for nobody.

Context counts for a lot in these comprehensive box sets; most of them are de facto storage bins to be rooted around in. But sometimes, as happens here, they unveil a compelling narrative. This one would be a lot more compelling if most of the alternative takes had been shunted to a separate disc. For the very patient listener, even they may add to the suspense generated by the nominal star, prone to tweaking his ideas on each outing. I’m not that patient; the value of three takes of “Papa’s in Bed with His Britches On” escapes me. Papa would do better to have a remote control in hand. Still, the upshot of 178 tracks, 34 of them alternates and breakdowns, is a vivid, twisty, usually beguiling portrait of a contradictory era when swing was a way of life, masking Depression, discontent and the only fear we had to fear.

As linchpin, Berry valiantly stalks the perfect solo while documenting the jazzman’s travail, lending himself to settings that range from sublime (Krupa’s 1936 Victors, for example) to “A Chicken Ain’t Nothin’ But a Bird,” involving not only swing, but also New Orleans polyphony, ballads, rhythm and blues, and novelties-all in a day’s work. Occasionally, he was given free rein, as in his rendering, with Cab Calloway’s band, of “Ghost of a Chance.” This performance is purposefully in the tradition of Coleman Hawkins’ “Body and Soul,” though it isn’t in that class-what is? As a rule Chu is more affecting at brighter tempos, like Henderson’s “Blue Lou” and “Stealin’ Apples,” Bailey’s “Lover Man” and “Thanks for the Memories,” Manone’s “Annie Laurie” and “Limehouse Blues,” and Calloway’s sleek “Bye Bye Blues.”

The great thing about “Ghost of a Chance” and other ballads (Calloway’s rapturous “Lonesome Nights” is exceptional), beyond the penetrating beauty and insights of his ideas, is that we get to hear Berry think in slow motion, choosing his moves with canny deliberation, weighing one gambit against another. When he throws in a glissando or riffs that come straight from Hawkins, they underscore the unmistakable originality of his timbre and the governing framework of his solos.

Berry is always conscious of the specific environment in which he solos. Henderson’s “Blue Lou” is in the major key, but it opens with a two-note riff in the minor mode. Berry begins his solo by echoing that riff, increasing the drama of the performance; at the bridge, his rhythmic attack seems to trigger the bassist into a sturdy walking figure. On Teddy Wilson’s magnificent “Blues in C Sharp Minor,” the great Israel Crosby (all of 17 years old) requires no such trigger; his bass ostinato is the heartbeat of the piece, and Chu draws from it a tapestry of dark emotions. Both these sides pair Chu with Eldridge, and they have their first face-off on Putney Dandridge’s “When I Grow Too Old to Dream.” Berry rides the whirlwind on that, a preview of Krupa’s euphoric session, where everyone generates serious adrenalin, despite that dreadful tune “Mutiny in the Parlor.” If Chu, Roy, Gene and Benny Goodman in full throttle don’t raise your temperature, you’re reading the wrong magazine.

As guest of honor, Chu is invariably the one we keep waiting on, no matter how great the other players. He rarely disappoints. If the kettle is hot, he brings it to a boil; if it’s boiling, he makes it brim over. Charlie Parker apparently felt that way the first time he saw him in Kansas City. His young wife Rebecca remembered his excitement and her surprise, a few days later, when she found him in the living room, “blowing his brains out,” inspired by Chu’s solo on Henderson’s “Stealin’ Apples,” which he played repeatedly. Two years later, Parker named his firstborn Leon after Leon “Chu” Berry. Berry got his much-misspelled moniker (Choo, Chew) from musicians, because he chewed on his mouthpiece or had Fu Manchu facial hair or both. He earned the name all over again chewing up the changes on Lionel Hampton’s “Sweethearts on Parade,” a 1939 Chu extravaganza that is a candidate for his finest ever recording-a good place to start.

Mosaic’s package is characteristically attractive, with fine full-bleed black-and-white photographs, excellent biographical and critical liner notes by Loren Schoenberg, and superb transfers. The sound is bright and real-don’t hesitate to give it juice. People often treat this music as nostalgia, as if they pined for the world that produced it. Screw that. That world was roiled by a Depression; lynching was virtually legal; the airwaves were flooded with racist and anti-Semitic ranting that makes Don Imus sound like Gandhi; the world was readying itself for war, the Holocaust and nuclear annihilation. Only the music was supreme and the music is still here-there is nothing nostalgic about it.

7,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/cadenza/player-piano-man/,"The magnificent Art Tatum album, Piano Starts Here, which combines his first four solo recordings from 1933 with a slightly abridged version of his 1949 Shrine Auditorium concert, has been chosen as the second “re-performance” release in a series created by Zenph Studios for Sony Classical. The most prosaic question it raises is this: In what end-of-year awards category can you vote for it? It is obviously not a new performance, because every note (save two minutes that Columbia cut from “Gershwin Medley,” rendering it as “The Man I Love”) has been available for decades-on 78s, 45s, 10- and 12-inch LPs and CD. But neither is it a reissue, because it is entirely unconcerned with transferring or improving old records. Zenph goes beyond the recording process in an effort to recreate the performance itself.

If this sounds like science fiction, join the club. I’ve interviewed two Zenphians and spent many hours with the Sony disc, now called, inaccurately, Piano Starts Here: Live at the Shrine (the 1933 solos are still included), along with computer-generated transcriptions of four performances, and I am still in the technological dark. But let me, as a semi-reformed Luddite, try to explain.

Zenph digitizes recordings to learn precisely how every note is played-in the words of project manager John Q. Walker, “how the note was touched and released, the dynamic range, how and when the pedals were used, and so forth.” Tatum’s playing was turned into high-resolution computer files, which, through solenoid-driven electronics built into the hardware of the piano by Yamaha, manipulate the piano’s hammers. On the most basic level, they have created a reproducing player-piano of unparalleled sophistication and nuance.

But that’s just the beginning. While Walker and his team will admit to no guess-work in reclaiming the actual notes, which are timed to within 200th of a millisecond to the original, they concede to speculation in re-creating the performance. No one, for example, knows what kind of piano Tatum played at the Shrine-though the timbre, as conveyed by the recordings, suggests a six- or seven-foot Baldwin. So Zenph took a state-of-the-art concert grand, the Yamaha Disklavier Pro, voiced it to replicate the Baldwin, and placed it onstage at the Los Angeles Shrine for a September 2007 concert before an audience.

The new CD is a recording of that 2007 concert, not a restoration of the 1949 recording. They used two discrete microphone designs, both included on the disc: The 13 selections are offered first as a concert performance, with the microphones placed in accordance with modern recording techniques rather than in an attempt to replicate the microphone placement in 1949, and then in a “Binaural” version. At the concert, Zenph put a Tatum-size dummy at the keyboard, with microphones in each of its ears. The “Binaural” recording, which is meant to be listened to with headphones, is an attempt to recreate what Tatum heard while he was playing.

Is the “re-perfomance” any good? Is it necessary? Well, it has proven necessary, even if you hate the result, because in the course of analyzing the performance, the Zenph team-which had no prior familiarity with Tatum as an artist-discovered that Columbia had been issuing this music at incorrect pitch: everything is slightly flat. As a Zenph analyst, Anatoly Larkin, points out, it is not impossible that Tatum used a slightly off-pitch piano (only someone who attended the concert and has perfect pitch can testify to that). Yet that seems unlikely, knowing what we do know of Tatum’s phenomenal sense of pitch and of the professionalism of Gene Norman, who produced the Shrine concert. Zenph has restored the correct sequence of Tatum’s program, which was accurate on the 10-inch LP, but not on the 12-inch or the CD. With the help of Tatum discographer Arnold Laubich, it also restored the missing two minutes from “Gershwin Medley.” All of these corrections ought now to be high on Sony’s to-do list for a reissue of the Tatum album: The Zenph recording is by no means a replacement for it.

But it does offer a new way of enjoying Tatum’s music. My own response wavered for a few weeks, beginning with instant elation, modified by increasing trepidation as I compared the Tatum record (which, notwithstanding the issue of pitch, is acoustically sound, eminently listenable and ultimately irreproducible) to Zenph, before settling into a mildly qualified enthusiasm. Serendipity played a part in my conversion. For some reason, the NAD player in my office cannot read the Sony disc, so I listened to it on a computer and iPod. Eventually, I took it home and played it on a much better rig, usually reserved for vinyl, and it blew my socks off.

At first, I considered the Zenph a Tatum aide-the clarity of recording and the differences in microphone set-ups, pianos and vintage recording equipment repeatedly focused my attention on details that seemed new to me, sending me back to Tatum for a comparison. Using Zenph as a way of getting closer to Tatum, I sometimes found it lacking: Is the second note Tatum plays in “The Kerry Dance”-a D natural-really the same as the note sounded in Zenph? Is the bluesy momentum of his intro to “St. Louis Blues” accurately captured by Zenph? Zenph insists that they are (“we slaved over every note,” Larkin says), though they acknowledge that other audio distinctions are inevitable.

Yet it’s a mug’s game to compare the two-that’s Zenph’s problem and not ours. What excited me about hearing Zenph on a good system was not the clarity it brought to Tatum, but the restoration it brought to the piano-the actual pressing and releasing of the keys, the extraordinary dynamic range, the ambient echoes, the overtones, the beauty of the instrument itself, all of which combined to put Tatum in the room. I wouldn’t recommend a recreation, re-performance or reproduction of anything over the original, but I do find this technological rapprochement with the past to be irresistible. I wish, though, that Zenph and Sony would avoid hyperbole on the order of “Tatum Lives, Seriously.” That goes without saying, with and without Zenph.

Piano Starts Here is the second of 18 projects Zenph has contracted to do with Sony; the first was Glenn Gould’s 1955 recording of Bach’s Goldberg Variations. I hope they continue to keep jazz in the mix-Teddy Wilson’s 1930s solos, for instance. John Walker says that in years to come they might be able to digitize all instruments; they have already begun on bass, working with an Oscar Peterson-Ray Brown performance, at Peterson’s request. They concede that the system they have is imperfect and there are things they’d redo; their software will evolve, as all recording techniques have. To underscore the point, they have scheduled a Tatum concert to be played on a seven-foot Steinway at the Apollo. I’ll be there.

8,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/cadenza/shipp-shape/,"Bet on it: Just about every Matthew Shipp album will spur someone to write that it is more accessible than its predecessors, an observation that says more about the observer than Shipp, who has never been all that inaccessible. His reputation for obscurity, as opposed to, say, obliquity, of which he is indeed a master, is somewhat patronizing, with its insinuated subtext: “We can appreciate his music, but it may be beyond your less-evolved sensibility.” Shipp’s music is too diverse and expansive to fit anyone’s pigeonhole, but for the most part it is decidedly listener-friendly.

Piano Vortex (Thirsty Ear), one of the outstanding discs of 2007, has proved particularly conducive to claims of mainstreaming, and I’m not sure why. For one thing, it’s less traditional than such previous group works as Pastoral Composure (2000) and Expansion, Power, Release (2001), or the gripping solo recitals, Songs (2002) and One (2006). Like most of Shipp’s music, it is entertaining and demanding in equal parts. If it gets a broader hearing than usual because it is reputed to be more conventional than usual, fine. But I fail to see the virtue in suggesting to those who fear or applaud Shipp’s avant-garde status that Piano Vortex is regressive or uncharacteristic, especially in light of his decision to open it with the longest and most challenging track.

Piano Vortex is significant on a few counts. It reunites Shipp with two longstanding collaborators: drummer Whit Dickey, who worked with him for much of the 1990s, in and out of the David S. Ware Quartet; and guitarist Joe Morris, who has partnered with Shipp on and off for a quarter-century-only this time, he plays bass, not guitar, and with unexpectedly impressive authority. It is Shipp’s first recording since Ware’s Renunciation (Aum Fidelity), a candidate for the best CD of 2007, which signaled the quartet’s dispersal, at least as far as American concerts go. The rave-up enthusiasm this superb group invariably triggered in live performances never transferred into record sales, which may be why the label included several minutes of applause, a sentimental but understandable gesture.

Renunciation, recorded in New York at the 2006 Vision Festival, captures the quartet (tenor saxophonist Ware, Shipp, bassist William Parker, drummer Guillermo E. Brown) with flags flying: the “godspellized” sublimity of “Ganesh Sound,” the strenuous exchanges between Ware and band on the title suite (including one cadenza that whirls briefly into “Bags’ Groove” before rising into a series of the purest spectral saxophone hollers on record), and an emphatic reprise of “Mikuro’s Blues.” This is rousing stuff, and in the wake of its receding overtones, Shipp’s Piano Vortex may sound relatively quiet, settled and understated, but its power is deep and circuitous, the eight tracks held together almost suite-like by apparent pairings, conceptual echoes and pounding rhythmic figures that take off like Möbius strips.

The title track begins almost gingerly, a meditative checking out of the terrain in which each dissonance is nicely italicized. There is a feeling of intuition reminiscent of Paul Bley-spare, lyrical and observant, as melodic fragments and harmonies unfold in a stream of remembered bits, shadowed by Morris’ alert bass, all of it coming together and coagulating midway. “Piano Vortex” is a piece that needs to be returned to after the rest of the album has been absorbed, as if it were a round. In sharp contrast, “Key Swing” is short, repetitive and rhythmic, with little in the way of improvisational variation; its recurring eight-bar piano figures recall pieces by Herbie Nichols in their tricky hops and minor mood.

“The New Circumstance” sets out in another direction, introduced by bowed bass and drums, and emerging as a rubato cluster of chords that in turns leads to a simple melody with an Eastern accent, which builds in rhythmic intensity until it emerges in a brief headlong groove (plucked bass, pattering snare drums) that opens up to bass and drums solos, until Shipp wraps it up so that the other guys can take it out. In other words, you cannot predict where the hell this thing is going, though it never slumps in getting there. Again, in sharp contrast, the shorter “Nooks and Corners” is all forward momentum. The theme is a witty and engaging riff, naggingly repeated, complete with some Morse code plinking and riotous swing: great fun-the kind of thing Jaki Byard would have dug.

And then the disc attains a deeper level with two masterly performances that show how really resourceful this trio can be. “Sliding Through Space” opens with a disarmingly lyrical melody, but the axis of interest ricochets from one corner of the triangle to another while stacking cumulative timbres. Morris’ bowing makes pitches sound as if they were played backwards, and slips through piano chords as Alan Silva once did with Cecil Taylor. Shipp pummels a characteristic rhythm, pedal pressed to the floor for maximum thunder. Yet overall, the drama is held in reserve, waxing and waning and waxing and finally waning into lyricism. “Quivering With Speed” is possibly the most Taylor-inspired piece; firmly grounded by Dickey’s drums, it is rigorously controlled, as Shipp reasserts pedaled dynamics (he really likes these chords), rolls vivaciously through the treble keys, and cuts out on a surefire vamp.

The final two pieces indicate yet another pairing. “Slips Through the Fingers” is an unaccompanied piano solo that uses a technique associated with Thelonious Monk: playing plush chords and then raising all the fingers but one. This is Shipp in a romantic, classical mode, though just when you think he is meditating on the 19th century, he mixes up the rhythm and fills out the body of sound with left-hand forays. The piece is short (little more than three minutes) and the abrupt ending is the album’s one disappointment; every time I play it, I play it twice. “To Vitalize,” the closer, does what it promises, demonstrating especially impressive digital command as Shipp sustains the rhythm established by a strict bass walk, improvising eight-bar phrases that are as conspicuously lacking in reiteration as some of the previous pieces partake of it.

After “To Vitalize,” go back to “Piano Vortex” and notice how relaxing it is, how sensible, even logical, it now seems. Vortex-like, this album sucks you in and keeps you spinning. ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912204768.52/warc/CC-MAIN-20190326014605-20190326040605-00159.warc.gz

 Cradling the body of a brown Zeidler archtop, his left foot rested on the rung of a bar stool, Peter Bernstein pauses during an extended intro to “Yesterdays.” In moments, a trail of changes resonates around the listening room. A familiar melody follows.

Developed over more than a dozen records as a leader and countless records as a sideman, Bernstein’s artistic evolution began as a young instrumentalist, eager to learn from his heroes, his peers and his most inspiring mentor, the late Jim Hall.

“He’s just one of the masters-all-time poets of the music-beyond any instrument,” Bernstein says. “He happened to play the guitar, and was gracious in that the way he played was about the guitar but [at the same time] really wasn’t; it was about his aesthetic. He was that kind of master where his instrument disappeared into his musical persona.”

Hall’s influence on Bernstein’s playing as a twentysomething musician in New York City proved enduring. More than harmonic ideas and rhythmic inspiration, Hall shared with Bernstein the true resonance behind his own expression. “Just to see someone have that kind of identity,” says Bernstein, “and then to be up close and see the specific things he did that made him sound the way he did, I realized-as I did being around all the great players-that it’s really about the details.

“It’s really about the minutiae. He was very careful about his choices orchestrating for the guitar. He was an orchestrator; he really improvised like a composer. He was a thoughtful musician, but also had a great degree of spontaneity in his playing. So he really embodied all the good aesthetics about art in general: curiosity, creativity and imagination.”

Bernstein credits what many peers consider his intuitive understanding of the music to an artistic approach he learned from observing his mentor. “All the choices [Jim] made were very hip choices, based on what he wanted to hear, not on what the guitar led [him] to play,” he says. “Still, the things he came up with on the guitar were very ‘guitaristic.’ He wasn’t shying away from the [instrument]. He was in tune with getting a beautiful sound out of the guitar, but I know in his imagination he was thinking about singers; he was thinking about Ben Webster. He used to talk about being influenced by things beyond the guitar: Ellington arrangements, classical music, great singers, great tenor players, people with big sounds. So he had that-he had a big sound, [but] he found his own way to do it.”

Hall’s sensitive and supportive comping style also deeply influenced Bernstein’s personal aesthetic. “He was a great accompanist,” Bernstein says. “He showed that you are what you play.

“I remember in class [at the New School], Jim would play behind all the students, and kind of make us sound good. He had the ability to make people comfortable, to play their best-play beyond themselves. And yet [he was] challenging, too-he would throw stuff at you; it was exciting! But he also supported you, and I was attracted to that element of the conversation-of playing music with people-that social part of it.”

Decades spent observing Hall inspired Bernstein to explore his own musical expression, and nurture an appreciation for playing alongside other equally expressive musicians.

On comping:
“I just always loved it. I was into it. It’s a great part of playing music-getting to comp for someone and follow their thoughts, to lead and follow at the same time. I’ve been lucky to play with so many great people of my own generation like Brad [Mehldau], [Larry] Goldings, Jesse Davis, Eric Alexander, Joshua Redman-all these cats-and then also many great horn players of the elder generation.

“I’m trying to get better at it; I listen to piano players. I always go check out guys like Harold Mabern, and I’d always go hear Mulgrew Miller, Herbie [Hancock], of course, people like that. I’d listen to [Herbie] and McCoy [Tyner] records, back to Red Garland and Wynton Kelly and Nat King Cole-where they come from. [I’d listen to them] as orchestrators and arrangers. [Listening to those guys] gives you great ideas on ways to accompany, too-what people have done to orchestrate songs, and how they voice sections.

On soloing:
“Comping makes me listen better when I solo. The experience of comping makes me more attuned to listening in general, because the attention’s not on me. I get to focus on what the [other players are] doing, so then when I’m soloing, I really try to listen and get some kind of conversation happening with the guys who are accompanying me.”

On solo guitar:
“Playing solo is its own thing, and it’s terrifying, in some cases. Take chances but be grounded; that’s the whole tension. Your entire experience with the tune comes into play; any time you’ve ever played it, that [experience] should be in there. You [have the chance] to meditate on your own thoughts about a tune and try to enjoy that experience, too, as opposed to missing the other guys.

“When you play solo it’s on you to be rooted, because there’s nothing else tying you down. It’s also on you to take chances.”

On the organ-trio format:
“As a guitar player, if you’re into jazz and swinging music, you can’t really avoid the organ. It’s one mind doing both things. The thing about playing with [an organ player] is that you just have to get in between their right and left hands; if they had a third hand, that’s where they’d want to play. It’s kind of different than putting your attention on how the bass player is approaching things, and then the soloist, because they’re two different minds. This is one mind. So you kind of focus in on that, and it’s cool. There’s a role for you as a guitar player.

“It’s a great instrument in the right hands. I’m fortunate enough to have played with Dr. Lonnie [Smith], [Larry] Goldings for many years, [Mike] LeDonne for many years, Sam Yahel for a while there, and a little bit with Joey DeFrancesco. It’s great. As a guitar player, you know you have a role, and you can blend. It’s fun.”

Bernstein’s profound creative partnership with Goldings developed when the two were in school together. “Goldings was my musical partner when we were still in high school,” he says. “He played piano, but there happened to be this gig where there was no piano, and we jury-rigged two keyboards to be an organ.”

From that gig, Bernstein set out to understand and internalize the mysterious language of the music he and Goldings began playing purely by accident. “I knew some of those organ records from Wes [Montgomery] and Jimmy Smith,” he says.

“That’s some of my favorite stuff ever-that blew my mind. … [A]s a guy coming from rock and blues I could hear that was blues music, but there were other elements-a lot of it coming from the excitement of the organ, and the way Wes comped behind the organ-the conversation between them, back and forth, that was thrilling to me.

“I heard the blues, but then I heard lots of other, different flavors in there. I wanted to figure out what those colors were. If it’s a language, there are too many words I don’t understand. I’m getting the feeling, but I’m missing the meaning. I wanted to figure out what Wes was playing, what Wynton Kelly was playing, what Charlie Parker and all those guys [were playing]-how are they forming those musical sentences?”

On Monk (Xanadu, 2009):
“The guitar and Monk have something in common,” he says. “When you play the guitar, you have to reduce. You have to figure out what notes you can leave out, because you don’t have 10 fingers to play at least 10 notes. You have six strings, at the most, and even that’s hard-it’s lots of juggling. [Most of the time] you’re dealing with three or four notes. Jim was all about counterpoint and voice-leading, and making other lines give the illusion of harmony, other than playing big chords all the time, like a piano.

“Monk was very much about that sparseness, deciding to leave certain notes out of the chord so that the chord would ring together in a way that he specifically wanted. When I started trying to learn [Monk’s music] on the guitar, I was surprised that things lay better than I thought they would. Certain things are pianistic, of course, but more than you’d think actually lay [well on guitar].

“I heard [Bill] Frisell play a lot of Monk with Paul Motian and [Joe] Lovano. He had a beautiful way of bringing out just the necessities of the tune-reducing it to what was elemental. He had a whole different approach [from Jim’s], but paid very much attention to detail, and just sonic relationships. He’s something special. So, he was an inspiration playing Monk; he said, ‘Yeah, you can get that vibe on guitar.’

“For me, I just love Monk. I wanted to play trio without piano and see if there was some way to focus it and think pianistically-have it make sense that there’s no piano there. You wouldn’t want to put the piano player in the position of having to play a whole record of Monk tunes, so it just made sense to make a trio record.”

On Let Loose:
“I feel very fortunate that [the record] came up and came together so fast. Paul [Stache] and Damon [Smith] from Smoke Sessions Records said we could put it out in May and get the session done in early January, and it turned out everyone was available: Gerald [Clayton] and Doug [Weiss] and Bill [Stewart]. We played some of my tunes [at the Vanguard last May], and it was a fun week. I thought we played well together. One day in the studio was a little nerve-racking, but I think it sounds OK. I’m happy to get to play my tunes.

“All those guys are master accompanists because they have strong personalities. They don’t blend into the woodwork, but they can get into the essence of a tune and bring it out. They get to the heart of it. I hope we can play more, and build on it.”

 For those unfamiliar with the vocoder, a shorthand description of the instrument could simply be “the robot voice.” That might come off as dismissive to an artist like Casey Benjamin, who has emerged as a modern master of the vocoder through his work with the Robert Glasper Experiment, if not for the fact that this robotic element attracted him to the instrument in the first place. “When I was 7 or 8, I really thought that I was a cyborg,” Benjamin recalls with a laugh. “I was obsessed with RoboCop, and you could not tell me different. So in part I guess it’s a nostalgic childhood thing, but I think it’s beautiful to have a robot being romantic.” The vocoder seems to be enjoying a renaissance these days, especially at the crossroads between jazz, R&B and hip-hop. Benjamin’s work can be heard not only on the Experiment’s Blue Note releases, including the band’s latest, ArtScience, but also on the new album by A Tribe Called Quest, We Got It From Here… Thank You 4 Your Service. In-demand producer and musician Terrace Martin uses it as a key part of his toolbox, on his own acclaimed recent album, Velvet Portraits, and on projects he’s produced including Kendrick Lamar’s landmark To Pimp a Butterfly. Long before it entered the music world, the vocoder, short for “voice encoder,” was invented in the late 1930s at Bell Laboratories, as a voice synthesizer to help reduce bandwidth on phone lines. Experimental electronic musicians began to take notice of the technology in the 1950s, and later Bob Moog and Wendy Carlos worked together to develop their own version, which can be heard on the soundtrack to Stanley Kubrick’s A Clockwork Orange. The vocoder’s first heyday occurred during the 1970s and ’80s, when it was used to provide “futuristic” vocals by groups like Kraftwerk, Electric Light Orchestra and the Alan Parsons Project, while Stevie Wonder and Herbie Hancock gave the tool a soulful gloss on albums that blurred the lines between soul and pop and jazz. It also provided actual robot voices on occasion, whether for Styx’s “Mr. Roboto” or the Cylons on the original Battlestar Galactica. Benjamin and Martin—both saxophonists also adept on keys—got started on a path toward the vocoder by hearing a different instrument: the talkbox, an effects pedal that channels the sound of an instrument into the mouth, creating a fusion of voice and most often keyboard or guitar. Roger Troutman, lead singer of the R&B group Zapp, used the talkbox on numerous songs, including the 2Pac hit “California Love.” (These days, both could be confused with Auto-Tune, the pitch-correction software that works by manipulating the sound of the voice itself, but can achieve similarly “cyborg” effects when pushed to extremes—think Kanye West or the once-ubiquitous T-Pain.) Benjamin and Martin were captivated by Troutman’s voice, but both say their lives were changed by hearing Hancock’s use of the vocoder on late-’70s albums like Sunlight and Feets, Don’t Fail Me Now. Martin also credits Teddy Riley, a master of the vocoder and the talkbox, and the producer of a who’s who of hip-hop and R&B including Michael Jackson, Usher and Bobby Brown. Unlike Benjamin’s android dreams, Martin was satisfying more human desires by picking up the vocoder. “I wish I could sing,” he says. “The vocoder lets me play my voice. There are masters out there, like Al Jarreau or Kim Burrell, who can do intricate things with their voices. Sometimes people need different vessels to get those things out, and the vocoder is just one of those things.” Vocoders require a vocal signal, either spoken or sung, and an instrument or synthesizer that will turn those words into musical pitches. (Benjamin uses a keytar as his vessel; Martin opts for a conventional keyboard.) For those looking to develop their technique, Benjamin suggests thinking vocal-first. “Like Auto-Tune, the vocoder sort of corrects your pitch, but if you don’t sing with the right inflection or the right phrasing it’s going to come off extremely robotic and very unnatural,” he explains. “That’s why it doesn’t sound right when a lot of keyboard players try to play vocoder—because they’re thinking of it as a keyboard player and not as a vocalist. I’m a big fan of Ronald Isley, Marvin Gaye and Gladys Knight. They don’t do a lot of riffing or a lot of technical things, they just sing the melody and their phrasing is so amazing. I advise people to get some formal or basic training in singing.” A major challenge of singing through the vocoder can be making your lyrics understandable. Hancock’s vocals were uniquely legible thanks to the Sennheiser equipment he was using, but that model was prohibitively expensive. Benjamin tweaked his set-up for years to improve the clarity of his words, though he says that learning to be expressive on your instrument is equally important. “We still have many people coming to our shows who say they can’t understand a damn thing I’m saying,” he says. “But they get the feeling from it. They understand the inflection. That’s the way I win them over—with the expression rather than a whole bunch of notes or shredding out.” With popular artists like Daft Punk, Chromeo and even Coldplay recording with it in recent years, the vocoder, once relegated to gimmick or special-effect status, is growing in popularity, and Benjamin and Martin encourage its use in a wide variety of settings. “The right place for vocoder is wherever you park your car, take it out and plug it in,” Martin says. “One day I took the vocoder to church because I forgot my saxophone—don’t ask me how; it was a crazy night. I sometimes take the vocoder to a jazz jam session where they’re playing standards, or to a blues session. The vocoder can go anywhere you want to go. That’s the freedom of jazz.” “Don’t be afraid to try anything,” Benjamin concludes. “That one thing that you think is too quirky or too weird could end up being trendsetting.” Read Brad Farberman’s interview with Kamasi Washington.

 When it comes to a musician’s practice regimen, there are two-and perhaps only two-things that everyone seems to agree on. First, practice is absolutely necessary. Second, musicians should do it as often as possible. What precisely those things mean, though, gets complicated. How much is “as often as possible”? What exercises and concepts are absolutely necessary to practice, and how best to go about it? And how do these things change as one’s career advances, or as one gets older?

All of these answers depend, of course, on the individuals-their personal styles and unique paths of musical development. But those paths do tend to begin in the same way. “When I first started, when I was 15, it was an obsession,” says bassist Kris Funn, 35. “I would do it till dinner. Three or four hours a day, at least!”

Tenor saxophonist Chris Potter was a non-stopper as well. “I started when I was 10,” he recalls. “By 12 I had already graduated to copying Charlie Parker records and trying to figure out how in the world he did that.”

It’s after one starts the professional life that practice comes at a premium. Some early-career musicians have to take a day job to make ends meet, severely curtailing their time to work on music. But even a successful fulltime musician has the set of complications called “life.” “Now, having a wife and a dog alone takes so much time!” Funn says. “You can’t afford mentally, physically or financially to put that much time into it.” Still, the young bassist says he tries to practice for at least an hour a day, in the morning.

Funn, based in D.C., works primarily as a sideman, including gigs with Christian Scott aTunde Adjuah and Warren Wolf. Potter, 45, has a more complicated itinerary: leader, sideman and educator. “It varies wildly, the way life is now,” he says. “There’s no set practice schedule; when I’m on the road it’s almost impossible to get in any time at all-maybe practice a little bit before the sound check.

“As far as being home, there’s always something that ends up going on at home that keeps you from working on music,” Potter adds. “There are plenty of days when I just don’t get any time at all, for various reasons. But normal practicing, if there is the time, five or six hours can go by and I don’t even notice it. It feels like I’m just getting started.”

For many jazz elders, however, the equation changes. At 80, drummer Albert “Tootie” Heath spends far less time on the road. He also has a settled lifestyle that doesn’t include a regular gig-but no less need for regular practice. “I practice every day, for two or three hours a day,” he says. “I wake up at about 5 every morning; hit a practice pad from 5 to about 7; then go brush my teeth and get my day started.” (Unlike Funn’s bass and Potter’s saxophone, Heath’s practice pad can fit in his suitcase and be used in his hotel room when he is on tour.)

What the musicians practice is just as important, and wide-ranging, as how often. “When you get in two to three hours, that’s when you’re on track to learning something new,” Funn says. “When I get half an hour to an hour, I mean, I’m just trying to maintain the basic ability to play. Just being able to do it. I will do a lot of running scales!” Because of the nature of the bass, manual dexterity is a prime focus. “And when you miss a lot of time, you go backward. You lose some of what you were able to do before-physical ability and mental quickness. You have to get back to work on it to catch back up to where you were before. And you’ll be sore as hell if you take time off from it and then come back.”

For Potter, “the only constant is that there is no constant. I usually just start by getting the horn out and playing, and if I’m honest with myself I usually come across something within five minutes that’s something I wish I could do but can’t. So I work on that and see where it goes. It’s a pretty stream-of-consciousness process.”

Potter also notes that as a saxophonist manual dexterity is important, but secondarily so. “The fingers aren’t usually too great an issue; muscle memory kicks in to a great extent,” he says. “The muscles that really need to work are the diaphragm muscles; those are the ones doing the actual physical work.”

Dexterity does take pride of place with Heath and the drumsticks, because of the instrument’s design as well as the facts of age. “There’s an awful lot of things that as a young person you can do much easier on the drums,” he says. Much of the time he puts into practicing involves developing and refining workarounds for his physical restraints; also, he says, “I work on a lot of endurance techniques.”

For Heath, with age has come increased concentration on the actual ideas he works on in practice. As a younger man he sometimes put in more hours, but “I wasn’t focused on specific things.” These days Heath is learning rhythms from other parts of the world, an ambition that requires more targeted sessions.

In short, practice methods and regimens are as individual to a player as his or her phrasing, a point Potter emphasizes. “Everyone has a different rhythm, a different kind of path,” he says. “[When I’m teaching] I try to show what you have to work on in terms of sound, rhythm, harmony-you have to get these things to a high level. You have to listen to lots of music and understand what’s going on. After that, anything can work. You have to find your own way, pace and style of doing it.”  Purchase this issue from Barnes & Noble or Apple Newsstand. Print and digital subscriptions are also available.

 I first experienced tenor saxophonist Joe Henderson’s playing on the 1966 Lee Morgan record Delightfulee-a record I literally stole from my parents’ basement. With some musicians, hearing them as a sideman on just half of an album-the other half of Delightfulee features a large ensemble playing arrangements by Oliver Nelson-might seem like a small sample, but, oddly, Henderson can sound more like himself on other people’s records. In fact, his most iconic turns happen on other people’s records: Morgan, Kenny Dorham, Larry Young, McCoy Tyner, Nat Adderley. In each case he morphs himself, channeling many modes of playing, reflecting the language of the musicians around him.

During my studies with George Russell, I found that Henderson seemed to reflect a lot of the values in Russell’s Lydian Chromatic Concept of Tonal Organization. His extensive use of the Lydian Major seventh flat five, and his pioneering use of the Minor seventh flat five not just as the ii chord in a minor progression but as a harmonic destination in itself (“Inner Urge,” ex. A), suggest an exposure to Russell’s Concept or some similar sense of organization. (Henderson actually played on Russell and Bill Evans’ Living Time and recorded Russell’s “Ezz-Thetic” with Grant Green.)

What are some other hallmarks of Joe Henderson’s style? The singing quality of Sonny Rollins, a thorough study of Bird, an understanding of Middle Eastern elements, gutbucket R&B tenor playing, a love of hemiola and the motivic tendencies of Lester Young all come into play. In interviews he talks a lot about Stan Getz (certainly a child of Young), though it’s hard to pick up the physical influence of Getz. There is a group of quotes that recur in his playing: One particular blues figure appears in many Henderson solos (“Straight Ahead,” “Una Mas,” ex. B, both found on Dorham’s Una Mas LP), in addition to fragments of popular songs such as “Heat Wave,” “Johnny One Note” and “Without a Song.” He quoted songs that interested him intervallically.

The thing that really makes a Henderson solo blossom is his ability to develop interval motifs. One senses his total commitment to groups of intervals, and his playing suggests a practice regimen. Once he is committed to playing a group of intervals, his commitment extends to every step of his modal choice: all seven positions (of a seven-note scale) in all 12 keys. This figure (ex. C) appears in several of Henderson’s solos. The figure itself is six notes, and more often than not he uses it rhythmically to create a kind of 4 over 3 hemiola. While the figure is made up entirely of seconds and thirds, the qualities (major, minor) of the intervals change with each diatonic step.

Composers and improvisers can define chord changes in the listeners’ ears not only by spelling chords up from the root, but by maintaining a constant interval structure and letting the changing accidentals and subsequent changing interval qualities do their work. Something in the human brain can assemble harmonic content and movement from the sustaining of one pattern through a single chord or a lengthy progression, changing the accidentals needed to fit each chord. The work of many composers, including Bach and Brahms, is built on these techniques. In short, one uses a figure to drag the listener through the changes. The figure could be anything: a scale in thirds or this Prez-like figure (from Tyner’s “Passion Dance,” ex. D). In this excerpt from “Tres Palabras” (ex. E), he drags a figure through a series of chords while cleverly dividing the bar into 11 parts.

Like many of the modern-sounding saxophonists of his era, Henderson uses alternate fingerings generated from study of the overtone series. The source of this may be pedagogical, probably emanating from one of the most influential saxophone books, Sigurd M. Rascher’s Top-Tones for the Saxophone, an oddly melodic study of saxophone overtones. It was most certainly a big part of the pedagogy of Joe Allard, who taught both John Coltrane and Eric Dolphy. Henderson was a student of Larry Teal, an equally admired saxophone teacher. While Coltrane tended to use the alternate fingerings to repeat a note (with a slightly altered texture), Henderson’s use of the overtones is quite different. Sometimes he spins a Rascher-like melody (“Passion Dance,” “The Real McCoy,” ex. F); other times he uses alternate fingerings of the same note to play a constant trill-using the alternate fingering the way a guitar player might apply distortion (“Black,” “Mode for Joe,” ex. G).

What makes his playing unique is the way he combines all of these disparate techniques. His solo on “Passion Dance” goes from the most inside playing to a substitution that’s further out, to noise, to polyrhythms that he builds sixteenths on top of. He is one of the least predictable improvisers, even when he uses elements you’ve heard before. His playing is episodic, yet his solos hang together as a single statement. He is seldom successfully imitated, as his work reflects a lifetime of uniquely varied musical study.

 If you’re a drummer who developed your approach and skills playing rock and you’re interested in playing jazz, you’ll most likely need to concentrate on three main areas: time-feel, touch and inner dynamics.

Most of today’s rock music is built on a feel where the quarter note is divided into halves or quarters, while in the swing rhythm that defines most jazz, a quarter note is subdivided into thirds. This hasn’t always been the case. Rock and roll from the 1950s and early ’60s was based on a shuffle feel, which is essentially the same as the jazz swing beat, with extra emphasis on the 2 and 4 backbeat. That shuffle feel is less common now, and drummers growing up on punk, metal and rock in general may never be asked to play a shuffle. Still, the shuffle of early rock can be a good place to start your studies as a jazz drummer because the quarter-note pulse is the same.

One way to play a basic shuffle is to play quarter notes with your bass drum as you play “hand-to-hand” triplets on the snare drum starting with your right hand. Accent your left hand on beats 2 and 4 and play all the other notes softly. (Ex. 1) Once you become comfortable and relaxed doing this, keep the left-hand rhythm the same and have your right hand play quarter notes on a ride cymbal in unison with your bass drum. (Ex. 2) Now you are subdividing the quarter note into thirds, with your left hand playing a syncopated quarter-note triplet to your bass drum, and your right hand playing quarter notes.

The next step is to play the jazz swing beat with your ride cymbal. To do that, have your right hand add the beats that your left hand is already playing just before beats 1 and 3-these are called the “skip-beats.” If you are playing with an evenly divided triplet feel, then the skip-beats will fall in the correct places for a basic swing feel. (Ex. 3) Play this beat over and over again until it becomes comfortable. I suggest playing this pattern along to some classic jazz recordings-like “So What” and “Freddie Freeloader” from Miles Davis’ Kind of Blue-to really get the feel of quarter-note swing.

Next you should focus on your touch. Most rock is played with electric instruments, so it’s easy for this music to be played loud; the players can simply turn up their amps. In this environment, the drummer is usually the only acoustic musician. In jazz you’ll mainly be playing with acoustic instruments, and you’ll need to control your overall volume in order to blend with the double bass, piano and horns. You do this with your touch.

The first step is to simply to allow your stick to fall to the cymbal and drums and not actually “hit” the instrument with any force. Gravity provides enough velocity to get a nice sound out of your instrument. Adjust your volume to sound musical in the size and acoustics of the room.

With rock drumming the inner dynamics emphasize the bass drum and snare drum rhythms; with jazz drumming the focus is the ride cymbal rhythms, and the snare drum and bass drum are played at a lower dynamic level. Except for occasional snare and bass drum accents, the predominant voice in jazz is the ride cymbal, and the other voices are played at a dynamic level below the volume of the cymbal.

You’ll also need to address tuning, starting with your bass drum. Take the pillow out of the drum and put a head with no hole on the front. You can use some dampening, but no more than a few felt strips, since you want a full sound with a minimum of sustain. Address your bass drum technique by keeping your pedal tension loose, and make sure the beater comes away from the bass drum head with each stroke and you don’t choke the sound by keeping your beater on the head. You may have to tighten your toms to get a more melodic tone versus a low-pitched thud. These adjustments will help you control your overall level, and the sound of the kit will blend with and support the other instruments.

As your swing feel, touch and inner dynamics develop, you’ll find that playing jazz relies less on the repetitive patterns of rock drumming and more on a swinging feel that can have a varied beat while maintaining steady pulse. For me that’s a lot of the fun of jazz. I can be creative and imaginative in what I play and make sure that how I play is supportive and complementary to the other players. Listen to a lot of classic jazz recordings to get an insight into the jazz-drumming concept and then play as much as possible-that’s where you’ll get your best lessons. Play, record yourself, listen back and discuss the music with your fellow musicians.

How will all of this affect your rock playing? You’ll become a more versatile musician, and your rock drumming will take on deeper roots because rock drumming actually developed out of jazz drumming!

14,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/chops/gospel-rb-singers-jazz/,"Lizz Wright (photo by Jesse Kit) R&B rewards the grandiose: There’s a reason the appellation “diva” gets tossed around so frequently when discussing the style. And while a soulfully ornamented vocal line can wend its way into the gut and plumb the deepest emotions, the vocal acrobatics associated with R&B singing all too often make for a shallow pyrotechnical show. Despite its spiritual intentions, the same can be said for gospel, where many singers seem to labor under the impression that octave leaps and eardrum-piercing shouts are the only way for their words to reach the heavens. Both styles have, of course, yielded their share of gifted jazz singers who’ve brought valuable lessons from R&B and gospel to bear. But entering the vocal-jazz tradition with either background can mean shedding some bad habits, as vocalists Lizz Wright and Will Downing recently shared. Downing has straddled the fence between jazz and R&B throughout his entire career, beginning with the house-music version of “A Love Supreme” on his self-titled debut album from 1988. He continues to strike that balance between “art and popularity,” as he defines it, on his latest album, Soul Survivor (Shanachie). He’s learned a thing or two about subtlety over the past three decades, and cautions other singers trying to transition into jazz to hew close to the timeless melodies that have made standards into, well, standards. “R&B vocalists are so busy sometimes trying to show off our vocal acrobatics that we can miss the beauty of the melody,” Downing says. “So sing the melody—at least one time. At least for the first verse. In the second verse you can add a little variety to it, and then by the time you get to the bridge, go ahead and do your thing. But come over to the melody side. That would be my highest priority for R&B singers trying to sing jazz.” Wright got her start singing in church, and was thrilled to find that she could apply the same heartfelt expression to a broader range of topics through jazz. She hasn’t turned her back on her spiritual side—witness the title of her latest release, Grace (Concord)—but says she’s found an ideal marriage between the emotion of gospel and the rich complexity of jazz. “Jazz involves a different study of the music, the melody and the chord structure,” Wright says. “The beautiful thing is if you walk into it from a gospel or church background, you’re already thinking about the sentiment and the feeling that you want to create with it. There’s a beautiful meeting place, because a lot of times the delivery of a standard can come across as a little institutional; the warmth will be missing, if we’re not careful. So coming from a background where there’s such an emphasis on emotional and lyrical delivery is a great plus.” The trick is to not get carried away by that emotion. As Downing says, “Less is more. With jazz, you’re not necessarily the focal point of the song. The joy of working with jazz musicians is that one of them might do something that will inspire you, or vice versa. You need to listen more to what the musicians are doing and it will add that element of creativity. There’s a marriage, a dance that goes on.” While it’s best not to fall back on the power and acrobatics of gospel and soul, it can still be valuable to have those abilities in your pocket. As Wright says, “It’s important to live a nuanced life where subtlety, softness and tenderness are allowed but where power is welcome when you feel it. I think it’s important not to over-identify with any end of the spectrum. It’s very difficult to sing what you don’t live, and sometimes what we hear in people’s voices is just a lot of work. The odd thing is that it’s still a human sound, so it still triggers compassion and interest. But it’s important to respect the power of your full emotional and dynamic range.” As always, the best path is to learn from the masters. Wright points to legends like Billie Holiday, Betty Carter or Ella Fitzgerald, and to a singer who stands as one of the best examples of tastefully melding R&B and jazz, Nancy Wilson. For male singers, Downing suggests a generational span that includes such artists as Frank Sinatra, Johnny Hartman, Nat “King” Cole and Gregory Porter. “Learn how to listen and don’t be afraid to expand who you’re listening to,” he says. “There’s a little bit of jazz in every genre of music, so look for it. Don’t be afraid to listen and learn.” Preview, buy or download songs from the album Soul Survivor by Will Downing on iTunes.

15,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/chops/jeff-baker-on-making-elevator-music/,"Jeff Baker (photo: Steve Korn) Not long ago, Jeff Baker, the vocalist and educator, observed a building in the initial stages of construction next to his apartment in Portland, Ore. “They were building this tiny tower right in the middle and I couldn’t for the life of me figure out what it was,” Baker says. “Then I realized, Oh, that’s the elevator shaft. They have to finish that before they can do things around it.” Baker used the metaphor of the elevator shaft and building from the inside out—a concept he also gleaned from producer T Bone Burnett—in creating his latest album, Phrases. For the recording, Baker wrote several new songs, adapting texts by Pablo Neruda, J.D. Salinger, and other well-known authors, and also chose some covers, including both jazz standards and pop tunes by Billy Joel, Ryan Adams, and Bonnie Raitt. Then he arranged the songs for a 12-piece ensemble (including himself) featuring such heavies as drummer Brian Blade, alto saxophonist Steve Wilson, tenor saxophonist Geof Bradfield, and trumpeter Marquis Hill, along with a string quartet. Sign up for our weekly newsletter, full of reviews, profiles and more! “The elevator-shaft idea really opened up a lot in my composing because it gave me an anchor,” Baker says. “Everything started to flow for me when I started to think inside-out instead of bottom-to-top or vice versa—just thinking about one thing that was really strong musically, and then allowing that to bring about other ideas and more creativity.” In Baker’s view, Phrases is less a novel with an overarching theme and more a series of short stories on love and loss—stories that he feels are written and arranged in an authentic way, rather than as prescribed for a typical jazz outing. “I guess you can tell what part of a relationship I’m an expert at, which is the end of them, for the most part,” he says, laughing. “And I wasn’t just going to tell these stories with a Latin thing here, a swing tune there. I’m a white guy from the Pacific Northwest, so I needed to write in a way that’s true to me.” As for arranging these stories, Baker drew on his proficiencies in keyboard harmony and music theory—skills that allow him to interface with instrumentalists on a technical level. “That’s not to say that there aren’t other ways to think about arranging,” he says. “I know a lot of singers who think more in emotional gestures, or in being guided by lyrics—and those are all super-valid places to draw from.” While Baker played a significant role in making the arrangements of Phrases, the process was highly collaborative. His friend Darrell Grant, the pianist, was heavily involved as well. “In the past, I worked with amazing pianists and arrangers who did the work for me,” Baker says. “In this situation that wasn’t the case. It was taking the songs to Darrell, who would say, ‘Here are other ideas and other things you could think about and other harmonic choices that you could make, or other form choices, or solo sections.’ I would take these ideas home to work on, and then I’d come back with some more stuff.” “Jeff has very much an instrumentalist’s sensibility in his singing and in his writing,” Grant notes, “so this was not the typical ‘Let’s write an arrangement for a vocalist.’ Jeff really saw himself as another voice inside the music … It’s rare that you get to be involved in a project from the conception. Jeff brought me sketches of the songs when he was just writing them. We tried various chord changes and sonic perspectives; we fleshed the songs out with parts and figured out who we’d want to play them from the very beginning.” The arrangements that Baker and Grant arrived at were open-ended, allowing room for contributions from the other musicians who would participate on the recording session. Some of the results were not exactly surprising. “I’ve played with Brian [Blade] for a couple decades now, so the sound of his drums is in my head,” Grant says. “I had a good idea of what he would contribute to the arrangements—which was great and exactly what I was looking for.” On the other hand, some musicians took the program in unexpected directions. Gregory Uhlmann, the guitarist in the band, gave the sort of harmonic input that comes from a deep knowledge of the fretboard, while using his electronic effects pedals to suggest new directions for the arrangements. “Greg would twiddle all these buttons and knobs and these amazing sonic things would come out,” Grant says. “That guitar wizardry informed the arrangements; we might simplify a horn thing or move it to a different octave, for instance.” Baker says it’s ultimately that sense of openness that helped him realize his own vision for Phrases. “I wrote thinking about these incredible musicians looking at my music and having their own set of choices to make. It was so much better than me saying, ‘You have to do this—or it’s not going to work!’” ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912203438.69/warc/CC-MAIN-20190324103739-20190324125739-00160.warc.gz
16,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/chops/living-for-the-city/,"Kassa Overall. Photo by William Brown Jazz has changed a lot over the past hundred or so years, but at least one thing about it has remained a constant: New York is—and probably always will be—its undisputed hub. Ever since Duke Ellington decamped from Washington, D.C., for Manhattan in the early 1920s, eventually establishing his orchestra as the house band at the storied Cotton Club in Harlem, New York has been a kind of Emerald City for aspiring jazz musicians. And every year they pour in, instrument cases in hand, hoping to make an impression. The city is much more welcoming than it used to be (the Cotton Club audience, remember, was exclusively white). But it is prohibitive in other ways, with a high cost of living that can be particularly hard on creative types with no fixed income. Still, there are ways to get by, and plenty of young-ish jazz artists who’ve managed to make it work. One of the best things you can do for yourself, a number of musicians say, is to move to New York with a little money saved up. Rent alone can drain your bank account in a matter of months, so if you give yourself a buffer, you’ll be in better shape. More to the point, the padding will, ideally, give you the chance to focus exclusively on your art. Musicians who move to New York without any savings are often forced to work side hustles or day jobs to make do, which can be draining. If you can’t afford to save, says the drummer Kassa Overall, 35, then you should use your connections to seek out a cheap living situation. Overall, who moved to New York from Seattle in 2006, originally bunked with a family in the Fort Greene section of Brooklyn for just $200 a month, allowing him the financial latitude to pursue his craft. Those in the house didn’t mind when he played, but he also split a cheap practice space with friends. “That’s pretty important—for drummers especially,” he says. “You split a room for four or five people and get a Google calendar [to arrange everyone’s practice times] and it can be pretty cheap.” Ben Williams, a 33-year-old bassist who has lived in Hamilton Heights since 2007, says he’s never needed a practice space because his instrument isn’t that loud. But if you’re going to practice at home, as he does, you should be respectful about sound and get acquainted with your neighbors. “They might be a little more reasonable about you making noise if they actually know you,” he says. Leaving the house and insinuating yourself into whatever scene appeals to you is probably just as important as practicing. When Williams moved to the city, he says he went out every night to absorb the music and make connections, and he suggests that other musicians do the same. Of course, club-hopping can get expensive—tickets at some of the swankier New York venues like the Blue Note and the Village Vanguard can put you $50 or so in the hole—which is why Williams says that young musicians should get to know club owners and managers, who may let you in for free if they see you often enough. It’s also important to remember that jazz isn’t the only cultural offering in New York. Young musicians should try to mingle with the wide variety of visual artists, actors, dancers, and fashion designers who have made the city their home. You never know what kinds of collaborations might come from such encounters. Putting yourself in situations where you meet people outside your usual network is something María Grand, the 26-year-old tenor saxophonist, made an effort to do when she moved to New York from Switzerland in 2011. Her goal, in particular, was to find older musicians who knew more about jazz than she did. “Sometimes people only hang out with their peers,” Grand says. “I really believe that it’s good to have intergenerational communication.” Grand went to City College for three semesters before dropping out and going on an artist’s visa. Indeed, for most foreigners, it can be useful to pursue a music degree in the city as a means to bring yourself there. That’s according to Gilad Hekselman, the 35-year-old guitarist who decamped for New York 14 years ago from Israel, his homeland, to attend the New School on a full scholarship. Not that he thinks you necessarily need to go to music school in order to be a working jazz musician. “You need to play your ass off,” says Hekselman, who spent a lot of his early time in New York proving himself at Smalls and Fat Cat, two clubs in the West Village. “You need to have something to say, and you need to be really good at it.” Even if you aren’t moving to New York from another country, music school can help you make connections. “You have an immediate peer group you’re handed,” says the Canadian guitarist Matthew Stevens, 36, who came to New York from Berklee College of Music in 2005 at the age of 23. He originally lived in Dyker Heights, southern Brooklyn, far removed from the city. “It really sucked,” he says. But he was fortunate to have a steady gig lined up with the trumpeter (and fellow Berklee alum) Christian Scott that kept him busy and engaged. Ultimately, you don’t need to move to New York all at once, Kassa Overall says. The city can be overwhelming, and it might not be the best fit for you. To find out if you like the scene, it’s useful to visit for a week or two before you have any commitments or rent obligations: “You can return for a month if you liked what you saw and heard, and then for six months, and then perhaps for a year or for good.” Either way, you should be prepared for a lifestyle that is unlike anything you’ve experienced before. “It’s not an easy place to be,” Stevens says. “But what you get out of it is, by comparison, unlike anything else.” Subscribe today to JazzTimes magazine and receive reviews, industry news, profiles and much more brought right to you!

17,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/chops/pianist-pete-malinverni-playing-jazz-church/,"Pete Malinverni (photo by Sally Green) One glorious, soul-filled Sunday morning years ago, in the choir loft at the Devoe Street Baptist Church in Brooklyn, I had an epiphany. While I often found myself worrying if I was playing “real,” valid jazz onstage, the music at Devoe always flowed easily and authentically. I wondered why. Well, it was because in that setting, with everyone open to the spirit, I was feeling it too. I wasn’t taking ownership of the music, or feeling responsible for generating it. Rather, I was trusting my years of preparation to give me the language to be a vessel for it at the moment of its creation. Since then, my professional performance life has benefitted greatly, as I’ve learned to be a purer vessel for the jazz I love. I feel freer now than I ever have. Religious gigs can be transformative for a musician’s work and spirit, and the practical and financial benefits of such jobs can be important too. Consider: That said, we all know how it feels to play in an uncomfortable situation, so don’t seek such employment strictly for financial reasons. You won’t do good work and you’ll likely do more harm than good—to yourself professionally and to others who may need the religious experience offered at services. If the ethos isn’t where your heart is, and if you can’t at least be open to the good that is done as a result of what’s being espoused, it’s not worth it. Find another day job—seriously. OK, so, assuming you want it, how does one get (and keep!) a religious gig?  Our experience as jazz musicians prepares us well for these gigs. We’re good at adjusting to situations as they arise/change, we can play in different keys and we’re good listeners—both to the music that’s happening around us and to the human equations that precipitate it. As bandleaders, we know how to respect and value the contributions of our colleagues; as band members, we know how to give the leader what he or she wants while still expressing ourselves. If you decide to seek this kind of work, trust your hard-won instincts. I’ve certainly found that playing jazz prepares us well for life’s surprising moments, musical and otherwise. You have, too, I’m sure! Pianist, composer and educator Pete Malinverni is Head of Jazz Studies at the SUNY Purchase Conservatory of Music. He also serves in religious settings, writing for and directing choirs in English and Hebrew as well as curating jazz vespers and other performance series. He currently works as the pianist and conductor at the Westchester Reform Temple in Scarsdale, N.Y., and as Director of Music at the Pound Ridge Community Church, also in Westchester County.

18,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/columns/from-4-years-old-to-84-a-jazz-band-ball/,"Randy Sandke I listen to all the jazz-for-kids recordings that come in, with hope they’ll generate future audiences, and for my own kicks. Now, the most groovingly joyous of all the recordings I’ve heard has arrived: Randy Sandke’s Jazz for Juniors on Mat Domber’s Arbors Records, where Domber has often reminded us how much fun jazz can be.

Trumpeter-composer-leader Sandke, a global performer, tells me he’d been thinking about “exposing this current generation of young people to jazz since they’ll be the ones to keep this [music] alive,” when a critical development impelled him to gather Wycliffe Gordon, Wayne Escoffery, Ted Rosenthal, John Riley, Jay Leonhart, Ken Peplowski, Howard Alden and Chuck Wilson to play music (with lyrics and drawings) that would answer the question, “What is jazz?”

The critical motivation, he says, was “when my wife Karen and I adopted a newborn infant two years ago whom we named Bix. Bix showed that a love of music develops very early in life-even before any comprehension of spoken language.”
This music for juniors so lifted this 84-year-old columnist out of the gloom of my day job-documenting how President Obama is continuing the Bush-Cheney anti-Constitution legacy-that I decided to get a more age-appropriate second opinion from my 4-year-old granddaughter, Ruby.

I sent the CD to my daughter Mandy (Miranda), who is a pianist, singer,composer and music teacher. Mandy soon called with a glowing review: “Ruby loves it, and keeps playing it! And when one of the instruments is featured, she runs to her toy box, and if there’s an instrument like it there, she grabs it and joins in.” Mandy added her own review: “Brilliantly done! And what a band! The musicianship is so high.”

When I relayed the response to Sandke, adding my own wish that I still had my clarinet so I too could join in, he said, “It doesn’t surprise me at all that you’re still a kid at heart.” And, without a doubt, so are the musicians on this gig-including vocalists Allan Harris and Carolyn Leonhart. But then, so are jazz people of all ages. A recent Sandke discography, published by Dutch jazz scholar Gerard Bielderman, runs 52 pages, and I doubt any of those discs will be spinning as much in nurseries and children’s playrooms as Jazz for Juniors (and then again later as the kids grow up).

As Sandke says, “There’s really no age limit for Jazz for Juniors.” So even if you don’t have children or grandchildren, you may well be following the travels of Sandke’s jazz-playing animals as they search through the world for other animals to join their band. There’s Tiger Tiger who volunteers-in song and in the lively booklet-to define “jazz” for new listeners. “It’s a kind of music where you make up your own song as you go along,” he says. “Or you add onto someone else’s song in your own way. You’re free to put all your own feelings into the notes you play and tell your own story. It’s just like talking to your best friends and telling them how you feel.”

That’s why Tiger Tiger “boarded a steamship bound for Africa, where he’d heard there were many wonderful animals who loved to make music.” So he found, among other swingers, “An Elegant Elephant,” “The Hip Hippo,” “The Drummin’ Dromedary,” “A Penguin Who Plays It Cool,” “A Cockatoo on the Clarinet” and “The Blue Bison.”

By the way, when this CD is played on a PC computer (not a MAC), you-and the kids-can see a slide show with illustrations and music. But I remember, as a kid, how unleashed a youngster’s imagination can be-like when I listened faithfully every Saturday morning to the fairy tales on CBS Radio’s Let’s Pretend. I was inside those stories before there was television, let alone computers.

This CD, Jazz for Juniors, is a microcosm of this music all by itself. And I believe that as my grandchild Ruby and the other juniors grow up, they’ll be drawn for the rest of their lives to this music that was so resoundingly put into words by David Baker in the October 2009 DownBeat: “Most important of all, jazz is synonymous with freedom. Jazz embraces all that freedom stands for. There is the freedom to create on the spot that is given to the individual soloist. There is the freedom created within a group of talented individuals coming together, each approaching his or her respective role with a creativity that results in a whole greater than the sum of its parts. … [And] jazz musicians not only bring their great art to the population of the globe, they bring the concept of freedom that is the very foundation on which this music was created. That is what endures.”

Randy Sandke, his fellow kids at heart, and Mat Domber have opened the souls of who knows how many youngsters to lifelong delights in what Baker calls the “wonderful sense of anticipation on the part of both players and listeners alike, knowing that each performance-whether live or recorded-will present spontaneously created music combining elements of the familiar and the unexpected in new and exciting ways.”

With regard to Jazz for Juniors, Sandke says (and I, with applause, agree): “Fortunately Mat Domber went along with the idea and decided to record the project for Arbors Records.” If there is a Hall of Fame for jazz record producers, Domber should join Norman Granz among a few other nurturers of the jazz life.

19,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/columns/hearing-voices-from-california-with-love/," Rare is the American jazz artist whose career hasn’t been expanded, extended or otherwise enriched by Japanese fans. Now, more than a dozen West Coast performers are reciprocating with From California With Love. Masterminded by Bill Reed of SSJ Records, all proceeds from the 13-track compilation will be contributed to the ongoing relief efforts for the devastating earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan this past March.

The project was born the morning after the disaster when Reed phoned vocalist Diane Hubka to inquire about the welfare of several mutual Japanese friends. Hubka suggested the multi-artist CD idea. Reed immediately reached out to current and former SSJ artists and received unilateral support for the idea. Almost all have either toured Japan or gained career support through Japanese reissues of their work. All currently reside in California. The artists were welcome to choose whatever song they preferred, with one caveat: Reed wanted the album to be thematically upbeat, ideally filled with selections that reinforced cross-cultural empathy.

Sue Raney, teamed with Alan Broadbent, opens with a lilting blend of “Blues Skies” and “On a Clear Day You Can See Forever.” Broadbent then takes a solo spin through “Sweet and Lovely.” Johnny Holiday, together with his frequent recording mate, saxophonist Sam Most, offers a rousing “Strike Up the Band,” made all the more delightful thanks to Most’s reedy vocal contributions. Former Ray Anthony vocalist Dick Noel, whose six-decade career has produced only two albums under his own name, offers a sweet rendition of Johnny Mercer’s “Dream.” Pinky Winters, who reignited her career a decade or so ago and has been recording steadily since, adds a stirring “You’ll Never Walk Alone.” Sixties pop crooner and Sinatra acolyte Frankie Randall sounds sprightly as ever on “The Wave,” which, not to be confused with Jobim’s “Wave,” is a new tune that speaks directly to the disaster and the courage that followed in its wake. Randall wrote it expressly for the album.

But From California With Love is not solely the purview of septuagenarian artists. Singer/guitarist Hubka (whose most recent album is the SSJ release I Like It Here: Live in Tokyo), accompanied by Dan Sawyer on ukulele, contributes a shimmering “Sweet Happy Life.” Leslie Lewis, often linked with the Gerald Hagen Trio, teams with pianist Hagen for a gorgeously muted “Skylark.” Likewise Tierney Sutton, who hasn’t recorded in years without bandmates Christian Jacob, Ray Brinker, Kevin Axt and Trey Henry, takes a duo outing with pianist Jacob for a tenderly haunting “Beautiful Love.” Jacob also provides a stunning solo interpretation of “Ue Wo Muite Arukou” (popularized in 1963 by Japanese vocalist Kyu Sakamoto and released as “Sukiyaki” for the American market-a rather preposterous renaming, since the Japanese title actually translates as “I look up when I walk”).

But it is studio pianist Jim Cox, whose immense list of credits includes sessions with Barbra Streisand, Elton John, Willie Nelson, Burt Bacharach and Robbie Williams, who gets the most play. It is Cox behind Winters on “You’ll Never Walk Alone.” He also supports vocalist Kurt Reichenbach (who also designed the album cover) on a superbly understated “Here’s to Life,” and is alone in the spotlight for a majestic rendering of “We Can Work It Out.”

There is also a 13th track, the only one that veers from the all-Californians mandate. Contributed by Chris Connor’s longtime manager Lori Muscarelle, it is a 1987 recording of Connor performing “I Feel a Song Coming On” at the Tralfamadore Café in Buffalo, N.Y. The sound quality is less than great, and the track is less than a minute-and-a-half long, but its rarity makes it a valuable addition.

From California With Love is currently available (CD or download) from CD Baby.

 At the end of this scene from the 1970 documentary Chicago Blues, Muddy Waters names a few of the essentials that make for “deep” blues singing, and concludes, “You gotta go to church.” In many respects, Houston Person’s a tenor player who goes to church every time he picks up the horn, and the style of jazz he embodies makes him something of an endangered species today. That’s not to say there aren’t other soulful tenor players on the scene, but Person’s among the last who add just the right touch of the black vernacular to ballads, bebop and blues. And he’s among the few jazzmen who plays R&B and pop tunes with the same inventiveness he brings to the great jazz standards.

In a recent conversation, Houston said that his open-mindedness to a wide range of material was fostered in his South Carolina youth where he heard music with “no barriers, no obstacles. I liked everything.” His mother was a schoolteacher who played piano, and his parents “required” him to listen to the Metropolitan Opera radio broadcasts for at least an hour every Saturday afternoon. “I knew Milton Cross’ distinctive voice better than anyone’s,” he said of the Met’s legendary radio host.

As far as his own repertoire is concerned, Houston says, “I like to introduce people to something new when I play. There are a lot of songs that haven’t been treaded on yet,” and he insists, “They all have something to say.” He cited “My Funny Valentine” as one of the few standards with which he had to spend a little extra time in order to appreciate it, but it was a frequent request of fans in Hartford, and he was committed to playing it with conviction. “Once I went back and really listened to the lyric, I got it!”

As strategies for building new audiences for jazz are eagerly sought these days, I’d say that Person’s already got the solution. “I care about the audience, and try to give them something they’ll like and understand,” he says. “I’m working for the audience.” If you’ve seen Houston before, you know he’s no Johnny-come-lately to this user-friendly approach. Dan Morgenstern picked up on it 44 years ago when he wrote, “Houston Person does little things with each tune that reveal thought and planning, but the routines are fitting, not cute…And he is just as honest in his playing, which is free from phony effects and is never meretricious.”

Ironically, there’s been a glaring paucity of critical acclaim for Houston in the jazz press. No one knocks him, but very few write about him either. The tried and true doesn’t inspire the scribes, and that’s had an impact not only on his potential audience, but on how jazz is defined overall. Swing and soul hasn’t the same intellectual zing as so-called edginess, but jazz could use more of the downhome elegance that Houston purveys. When he was at the Clarion last spring, the room buzzed with folks saying, “Wow! I always took this guy for granted.” Person himself is patient. At 77, he says, “You get it sooner or later.”

Person was born in Florence, S.C., on November 10, 1934, and attended South Carolina State College before enlisting in the Air Force. While stationed in Heidelberg, Germany in the mid-’50s, he often sat in with the 7th Army Jazz Band, an outfit that included Cedar Walton, Leo Wright, Don Ellis, Don Mensa and Eddie Harris. Following his discharge, he enrolled at the Hartt Conservatory of Music at the University of Hartford, and remained in the area for several years after his graduation. During this time, he often played at the Sundown Club with pianist Norman Macklin, and backed the singers Arthur Prysock and Little Jimmy Scott. He also made regular Sunday night sessions at the Famous Door and Jinxy’s in Springfield. Though it was 50 years ago, Houston says he’s still “got a weak spot for the area. Besides the service, it was the first time I was away from home, and people took care of me.”

He played New Haven too. In John Chilton’s biography of Coleman Hawkins, Song of the Hawk, he refers to an engagement Hawk played in New Haven in 1962. The 58-year-old tenor saxophone patriarch began his opening set annoyed over being introduced as a “classy old man,” and didn’t take kindly to a reporter’s questions at intermission about his work of 40 years earlier. But as Chilton reports, by the second set, “Hawkins had mellowed and invited the local tenor player Houston Person up to play duets…[Hours later} as the waiter was turning the lights out, Hawkins was still on stage” with Houston and organist Ray Jackson.

Person spent three years working with organist Johnny Hammond Smith’s combo in the mid-’60s, and made his debut as a leader for Prestige in 1966. He first worked with Etta Jones in Hammond’s group, and they went on to tour and record together for 35 years. Houston also worked as Etta’s manager and producer, and many assumed that the two were a married couple, but as with Billie Holiday and Lester Young, the romance was strictly musical.

Houston’s maintained a prolific recording output over the course of his career, covering the bases from soul jazz and funk, gospel and disco, classic blues and organ grooves, to intimate duo sessions with bassist Ron Carter and pianist Bill Charlap. Of his dialogues with Carter, he told Stanley Crouch, “We both have a feeling for the blues and for all the good things that created the music we play. Music comes from a feeling about life, and Ron and I share a great respect for all of the black music of quality, from the church to the tavern to the dance floor.” Carter views him as “the last link” in the tenor tradition that includes Person’s major influences, Illinois Jacquet and Gene Ammons. Bob Porter, who produced reissues of Houston’s Milestone recordings, sees him as”one of a dying breed: a jazz musician who makes his living playing nightclubs. No teaching gigs, no grants, no fellowships, no benefits, no perks.”

But he plays on his own terms, and happily they’re the same that a devoted following has found agreeable for the past 50 years. What’s not to like? Houston sticks to the basics, but to be sure, they’re essential basics: an approach to melody that keeps the tune in the foreground and to rhythm that keeps the beat prominent and danceable. What Gary Giddins said of Count Basie applies to Houston too: he knows that once he’s got your foot, it’s only a matter of time before he’s got your heart.

When I asked Houston if anyone else was still taking care of business in his soulful manner, he named Jimmy Heath and Benny Golson. When I pointed out that they’re both older than him, he mentioned Harry Allen, Ricky Woodard, Grant Stewart and Ken Peplowski as younger keepers of the flame. Then he was quick to add, “Everyone tells me I’m the last, but I’m not convinced. I think somebody, maybe, will come along. But all this talk scares me and I think, ‘Gee, what if I go down?’ But music will keep going. That’s for sure.” When I insist, however, that it won’t be quite the same, he relents and says, “OK, I’ll take that!” ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912205597.84/warc/CC-MAIN-20190326160044-20190326182044-00172.warc.gz
21,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/columns/jaki-byard-an-appreciation/,"Jaki Byard I wrote several weeks ago about the jazz-deprived time I spent in 1977 in Eugene, Ore., where the only saving grace was the Prez Records shop. When I flew into Boston for the Christmas holidays that year, I made sure to arrive on a Wednesday so that I could see Jaki Byard leading his big band, the Apollo Stompers, at Michael’s Pub on Gainsborough Street. The band was stocked with students from the New England Conservatory, where Byard had begun teaching in 1969, and even though they were young and unseasoned, under Jaki’s direction they congealed into a dynamic outfit with a fascinating repertoire.

Before leaving for the West Coast that summer, Michael’s had been a regular stop for me on Wednesday nights. The place was a shot-and-a-beer dive with leaky ceilings and overhead steam pipes under which spaghetti pots were strategically placed to collect dripping water. Students from nearby NEC and Northeastern wandered in at night and spruced it up a bit, and the Stompers gave it a lift on Wednesdays.

As tired as I was upon my arrival at Logan that December night, I was determined to hear the music at Michael’s, but no sooner had I arrived and grabbed a chair near one of the sputtering radiators in the rear than I fell asleep. How long I was out I don’t recall, but what awakened me was Jaki himself, who though best known as a pianist, was playing his old standby, “When Sunny Gets Blue,” on alto saxophone right in my face. Whether this was the same method he used to get the attention of students dozing in class I wouldn’t know, but it sure snapped me out of my slumber and into a dream come true, a personal wake-up call from Prof Byard.

June 15 was Jaki Byard’s 90th birthday anniversary. Like me, he was born in Worcester, and he blazed his own trail, so I’ve felt a desire to celebrate Jaki all my life. I love his eclecticism, his unpredictability, his restless engagement with tradition, his humor, even his sarcasm, which he displays in a 12-second intro to a Thelonious Monk medley he played at the Maybeck Recital Hall in 1991. Jaki tells the audience, “There was a composer in Paris [sic] was commissioned to write a composition for some big shot for the left hand, so I’m going to do this thing just with my left hand only,” then proceeds into “‘Round Midnight.” Jaki’s “big shot” taunt rings with a Worcester-like clarity that’s as resonant as the many I recall hearing on the streets of my old hometown.  Chet Williamson, the Worcester-based jazz harmonica player, has been a keeper of Jaki’s legacy since Byard’s unsolved death by gunshot at his home in Queens in 1999. Chet’s research and writings on Jaki’s Worcester background, including his co-founding in 1938 of the Saxtrum Club, a cooperative established by the city’s black musicians, as well as a video-taped symposium he hosted on Byard at WPI in 2001, are a cornerstone of the Jazz History Database.

Byard also figures prominently in a lively and resourceful new book by Richard Vacca, The Boston Jazz Chronicles: Faces, Places, and Nightlife 1937-1962. Vacca’s chapter on Byard begins with Nat Hentoff’s assertion that Jaki “was a pervasive influence on nearly every young Boston jazz musician who was interested in discovering new jazz routes.” Following his Army service in World War II, Byard toured with Earl Bostic, then was on the Boston scene throughout the late ’40s and ’50s, where he played with Ray Perry, Herb Pomeroy, Charlie Mariano and Sam Rivers, and lesser known outfits like Jimmy “Bottoms Up” Tyler and Jimmie Martin’s 17 Exponents of Bebop, a band that also included Gigi Gryce and Joe Gordon. He led his own trio at Wally’s and a big band at the Buckminster Hotel, was at the center of activity at the Melody Lounge in Lynn, a venue favored by the modernists, and was the “intermission pianist” at the Stable in Copley Square. Marc Myers devoted a JazzWax column to Pomeroy’s legendary recording Life Is a Many-Splendored Gig, a state-of-the-art late ’50s big band session that showcased Boston players and introduced Byard’s delightful original, “Aluminum Baby.” By the way, Jaki plays alto on this session while Ray Santisi, who still plays at the Marriott Copley, is at the piano.

Jaki went on the road in 1959 with Maynard Ferguson’s big band as pianist and arranger, and made his first date the following year at age 38, the solo piano Blues for Smoke, which Hentoff produced for Candid. In 1962, he joined Charles Mingus, with whom he toured extensively through the mid-’60s; Jaki arranged most of the music, including “Meditations on Integration,” for the landmark concert Mingus at Monterey. On Eric Dolphy’s Far Cry, he recorded his celebrated compositions, “Ode to Charlie Parker” and “Bird’s Mother.” Here’s Jaki with Mingus and Dolphy playing “Take the ‘A’ Train.”

Speaking of routes, one of the most impressive of Byard’s compositions is “European Episode,” which he recorded with tenor saxophonist Booker Ervin and trumpeter Richard Williams in 1964 on Out Front! The work was composed as a dance suite in six parts inspired by a European sojourn that wound its way from Brussels to Paris to Milan. Jaki’s boyhood friend Don Asher, who wrote of the transforming influence Byard had on his young life in his superb memoir Notes From a Battered Grand, describes “European Episode” as “kaleidescopic…a hurly burly of urban streets in a lively excursion of shifting tempos, rhythms, and evocations.” It reminds me of the amazing version of Bud Powell’s “Parisian Thoroughfare” that Jaki and Roland Kirk recorded in 1968 on The Jaki Byard Experience.

Byard returned to Boston in 1969 at Gunther Schuller’s request to establish the Afro-American Music department (now Jazz Studies) at NEC, and he also taught at the Hartt School, the New School and the Manhattan School of Music. Among the well-known musicians who credit Byard as a teacher and mentor are Ricky Ford, Marty Ehrlich and Jason Moran. Thirteen years after his death, Byard’s legacy remains significant and cherished at NEC. In a note to Jaki’s daughter Diane on a YouTube  clip of Byard’s performance at the Pittsburgh Jazz Festival, the pianist Alan Pasqua writes, “Your father changed my life by encouraging me to move to Boston to study with him. When I got there, he was there for me, in every way. It was not lip service. He was my friend and mentor.” Pianist Moran, who recently became the advisor for jazz at the Kennedy Center, selected a  list of a dozen favorite Byard recordings for jazz.com

The late George Russell, another legend among NEC faculty, offered this knowing appreciation of his colleague: “Jaki Byard always personified the past, present and future of jazz, wherever or whenever one might have been fortunate enough to experience his challenging ideas. An icon in the history of jazz, Jaki was Art Tatum, Earl Hines, Bud Powell, Ran Blake, Cecil Taylor and Bill Evans, all in one. Yet, like these fellow icons, he was his own uncompromising, unique, living entity. He isn’t a household name, but most likely his low profile is the result of an irresistible need to constantly reinvent himself, the sure sign of the consummate artist. His history, from Boston’s Storyville to the countdown year of the millennium, leaves us with a rich history of his music, his life and times, allowing us to experience the intense struggle of a dedicated artist to keep his essence alive while still making us laugh with him along life’s corridor. There will never be anyone who can take his place.” ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912203991.44/warc/CC-MAIN-20190325133117-20190325155117-00220.warc.gz

23,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/columns/paul-butterfield-origins-of-an-originator/,"Paul Butterfield Blues Band members Mike Bloomfield, Butterfield (bottom) and Jerome Arnold at the Newport Folk Festival, 1965 Martin Scorsese captured something of Paul Butterfield’s heroic stature in the way he framed the harmonica player’s appearance in The Last Waltz. Preceding an interlude in which the Band recounts meeting Sonny Boy Williamson near the end of his life in Helena, Ark., the blues portion of the concert begins with Butterfield, who was essentially the blues harp’s proxy in rock, framed in a long shot against a black background with no other musicians visible. Eventually Levon Helm comes into view; otherwise it’s all Paul as the band shuttles through the rhythms of “Mystery Train.”

A few years earlier, at another celebrated concert, Greil Marcus observed Butterfield backstage at Woodstock and was impressed with how deferential the Band and members of Blood, Sweat and Tears were toward him. Marcus wrote, “Butterfield’s…impact on rock and roll is incalculable and he is very much a father of the modern scene, as crucial to the emergence of San Francisco or Bob Dylan as anyone in the country. Butterfield’s first band and his first records broke down the doors and brought hundreds of musicians that are now famous into the light…[and] the jovial respect the Band showed him that night was simply more proof of his dignity. He’s a dignified fellow – black tie shoes, beat-up jacket, his hair cut in the style of Chicago’s hillbilly ghetto. He was, in fact, the only bluesman on the stage, and the way he carried himself provided a sense of what that word really means.”

You might assume that a player of such singular renown would be a first ballot shoe-in for the Rock ‘n’ Roll Hall of Fame, which the Butterfield Blues Band was nominated for this year, but they didn’t make the cut. It’s not that the Hall means that much to me, but as an institution that will inevitably grow in stature as an authority on how popular music history is written, it does matter that it honor the right players and get the story straight. Twentieth century American music is rife with tales of neglected, exploited and forgotten originators, but the Hall’s main criteria for membership, “influence” and “significance of contributions,” suggests that it’s trying to make an accurate accounting of a legacy that’s often obscured by time and secondary, show biz motives.

Time may well be the chief reason why Butterfield, and his band’s legendary guitarist, Mike Bloomfield, were neglected by the Hall as individuals, and have now failed to garner enough votes as the collective Paul Butterfield Blues Band. They’ve both been dead for over 25 years, their most significant work was done over 40 years ago, and neither had a hit record. Those are difficult odds to surmount, but the historical record still speaks resoundingly for the “influence” and “significance” of the band and its leader.

Paul Butterfield is an archetypal figure in American music, a young white man who played the blues with startling authenticity and projected through black music a figure both daring and romantic, an iconic blend of dedicated virtuoso and pugnacious street tough. B.B. King’s biographer Charles Sawyer saw him as a figure who went directly from boyhood to middle age, skipping adolescence altogether. Butter was only 22 when he cut his debut recordings, but he came across as startlingly mature, and his no-nonsense approach raised the stakes for everyone else. Barry Goldberg, the keyboard player who worked with Bob Dylan and was a founding member of the Electric Flag, says, “Paul’s whole vibe, his whole persona, was of greatness.” Songwriter Joel Zoss, who first met him in Chicago around 1963, told me, “To know Paul was to touch real greatness. You knew you were walking with a master.”

In a 1971 interview, Butterfield allowed that when Muddy Waters first invited him onto the bandstand, he wasn’t yet a master of much, “But everybody there was saying, ‘Yeah, go ahead man, out of sight!’ They were humoring me, but that was okay because if they had said, ‘Please, man, come on, stop,’ I might never have gone on.” In a joint interview with Waters and Butterfield that Downbeat featured as a cover story in 1969, Muddy remembered of his young charge, “He wasn’t too good when I first noticed him, but he got good…And you always had this particular thing, this something that everybody don’t have, this thing you’re born with, this touch. ‘Cause you used to sing this little song and have the joint going pretty good. As soon as you’d walk in, I’d say ‘You’re on next, man.”

For many who were captivated by Butterfield’s legend as it came to light in the ’60s, he embodied the myth of a hero whose quest requires him to journey through forbidding lands. Mike Bloomfield was a witness to Butter’s odyssey, and related it in these words in a Rolling Stone interview in 1968: “Butter wanted to play harp. And he went down there, Butter went down there when he was a young man, right down on the street which was the hardest scene in the world, the baddest, filled with bad motherfuckers…Butter went down there with his harp and he sucked up to Junior Wells, and [James] Cotton, and Little Walter. After a bit, Butter got better than them…I was just sort of a white kid hanging around, and not really playing the shit right, but Paul was there man… He held his own. God, did he hold his own.”

Actually, Butter didn’t go “down there” so much as he went “over” to the South Side from his boyhood home near the University of Chicago. His father was known on the South Side for the pro bono work he provided as a lawyer, his mother worked at the University, and his older brother Peter kept jazz and blues spinning on the turntable at home. Music and art lessons were encouraged, and Paul studied flute with the Chicago Symphony’s principle flutist, sang in the church choir, and played baseball and ran track and field. The latter brought him a scholarship offer from Brown University, but a knee injury curtailed that dream and kept him closer to home at the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana. Before his first semester was over, however, he was back in Hyde Park, where he soon met guitarist Elvin Bishop, a U of C student who’d caught the blues bug as a teenager in Tulsa.

Bishop told Butterfield chronicler Tom Ellis that his subject was a quick study. “He was playing more guitar than harp when I first met him. But in about six months he became serious about the harp, and he seemed to get about as good as he got in that six months. He was just a natural genius. This was in 1960 or 1961. By this time Butter had been hanging out in the ghetto for a couple of years, and he was part of the scene and getting accepted.”

Butterfield’s main model was Little Walter Jacobs, who established in the early ’50’s the style of amplified harp playing that remains the norm to this day. Jacobs and Louis Myers, who’s best known for his guitar playing with Walter and Junior Wells but was also a fine harp player, spoke of Butterfield in a 1967 interview. “This kid, this Paul Butterfield, white boy playin’ harp, he play pretty good…I had been minglin’ with this kid all the time,” Myers recalled, “He was huntin’ sounds, you know.” Little Walter interjected, “Tryin’ to find that little thing in there,” then Myers continued, “He was looking for sounds…he determined that right away…and me and him would have harp battles…I know what he’s huntin’, sounds, [’cause] that harp is more than a notion, boy.”

Few roads taken in rock have entailed what Butterfield risked as a young player seeking to master an idiom in the presence of its creators, some of whom were supportive, others hostile or skeptical. Sam Lay, the great blues drummer who eventually worked with Butterfield, says that when he first heard Smokey Smothers tell of a “white boy” who was going to sit in on harp, he thought, “I’ll believe it when I see it.” Lay added that Butter’s playing “shocked me.”

What shocked Sam Lay was not only Butterfield’s youthful, race-transcending mastery of the humble 10-hole Marine Band harmonica (of which he utilized the instrument’s first six holes only), but the emotional expressiveness he projected through it. As his music quickly evolved beyond the basics of the 12-bar blues to incorporate jazz, soul, and modal forms, he crafted a deeply personal sound in which tone was never sacrificed to technique. Bloomfield humorously asserted, “If Butterfield was a tuna-fish sandwich, he’d still be blues,” and his ability to cut through complex arrangements and horn-laden charts with the textures of blues feeling induced awe in his fans and the legions of would-be harp players he spawned. Butterfield invariably said that at its heart, music comes down to the expression of a “feeling,” and in 1983 he cut a harmonica instruction tape in which he called the instrument, “the heart’s horn,” and said, “It can cry better than most…and can bring out a lot of different kinds of emotion and feelings.”

Butterfield was hardly alone as a young white kid in the ’60s with a passion for blues. The Windy City was home to other aspirants including Bloomfield, Bishop, Nick Gravenites, and the transplanted Mississippi native, Charlie Musselwhite, who was initially puzzled when he ventured into South Side clubs and heard the locals addressing him as “Paul.” (Another example of how unusual the presence of whites was at South Side venues was related by Muddy, who said that when he first saw Butterfield show up at Smitty’s Corner, he took him for an IRS agent.) In New York, Al Kooper and Danny Kalb formed the Blues Project, while Geoff Muldaur and other folk musicians in Cambridge dug deep into country blues and jug band music. Bob Dylan absorbed everything, of course, while across the pond the Stones, Yardbirds, Van Morrison, and Eric Clapton made no secret of their devotion to American R&B. But outside of Clapton’s humbling encounter with Sonny Boy Williamson when the irascible blues great toured England in 1963, most of these players learned the music from records, while the Chicagoans honed their chops under the scrutiny of the originators themselves.

By 1963, Butterfield’s local renown led to a long residency at Big John’s, a North Side establishment in Old Town that Bloomfield likened to Haight-Ashbury. At Big John’s, he not only began to establish a reputation for himself with industry executives like Paul Rothchild, who signed him to Elektra Records in 1965, but also helped Chicago’s finest get their first local bookings outside the South Side. A few years later, Bill Graham would credit the Butterfield Blues Band not only for putting the Fillmore West on the map, but with encouraging him to book Muddy, B.B. King, Otis Rush, James Cotton and Albert King. In 1973, when he introduced Butterfield’s Better Days at the Winterland Ballroom, Graham said, “Without Paul, I don’t know if a lot of us would be here tonight.”

As it happened, it was Albert King, not the Butterfield Blues Band, who got elected to the Rock Hall this year, and who knows but that Paul would have deemed that the right choice? For all his drive and competitiveness, Butter revered the old masters, and he enjoyed at least one glorious moment at the Hall when he gave the induction speech for Muddy Waters in 1987. In April of that same year, Paul was one of B.B. King’s guests on a television special that featured him blowing harp with his host as well as Gladys Knight, Etta James, and Eric Clapton, and on one selection his plaintive vocals nearly stole the show from Albert King and Stevie Ray Vaughan on the Elmore James original, “The Sky Is Crying.” Alas, it was Butter’s last testament. He died a few weeks later on May 4 at the age of 44.  B.B. lauded Butterfield in his autobiography as a “bad white boy…who had all the grit and grind of the old masters.” He dedicated B.B. King & Friends to Paul’s memory.
 December 17 marked the 70th anniversary of Paul Butterfield’s birth. ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912203438.69/warc/CC-MAIN-20190324103739-20190324125739-00274.warc.gz

 Bassist and composer Giulia Valle is a rara avis on the Spanish jazz scene. Born in Italy, she established her professional career in Barcelona as an artist and is now also an educator, teaching at Conservatori del Liceu. Driven by a strong sense of discipline and an undeniable natural talent, Valle has established herself as a unique voice on the contemporary and avant-garde jazz panorama. She has played with many different renowned musicians, including John McNeil, Guillermo Klein, Bill McHenry and Jason Lindner.

Today, Valle is focused on two new albums that will be released at the end of the year: Líbera and Giulia Valle Trio Live in San Francisco. She has also performed at many international jazz festivals and clubs, including the London Jazz Festival, Jazz a Viènne, SFJAZZ Center, and the Blue Note Jazz Club in New York. We spoke to her in Spain.

It feels like you get more recognition in other countries, like the United States, than in Spain, where you live. What do you think? 
Well, I wouldn’t say that I get more recognition in the States than in my country because where I live, in Barcelona, which is a city that has a very rich music scene, I’ve always been supported by the audience and the bookers. I would say that the rest of Spain, with few exceptions, usually ignores pretty much what happens in Barcelona, especially Madrid. But those are political issues that have nothing to do with music and that are damaging the art scene all around. On the other hand, I’ve very much felt the support from people like Randall Kline from the SFJAZZ or Jeff Levenson from the Blue Note, New York. They’ve brought me there already twice, and made it possible for me to tour around other American and Canadian cities, which is something gorgeous as this is where jazz vanguard has always been.

Your music reflects a very personal aesthetic that explores different dimensions and possibilities of the contemporary jazz language. 
I’ve noticed that in my audience there are people of different ages and social conditions, which makes me very happy. It means to me that music is basically a matter of energy. To have your own voice is just the result of what you are as a human being. Even if we always get inspired by other musicians, as composers we should always avoid reproducing a specific style, but of course we should let this style be an influence. We should also avoid trying to be someone else. Everyone has something to say if they really explore it honestly. This is probably one of the most creative paths we can follow but it is also quite painful as you are alone sailing in the middle of an ocean of possibilities and uncertainty.

You are considered by your colleagues a really good musician, able to work on your own ideas, having a strong knowledge of the development of jazz, and also being really demanding with yourself and the people you work with. 
 Oh, really? I’m glad to hear that! I’ve noticed how complex it is to write the right line for every instrument. I can tell that all the musicians I’ve been surrounded by have been really committed to my music and its changes despite the fact that what I do is an endless work in progress. At every concert the same tune might have some differences and that demands some specific attention and creates a certain tension, which is good for music: It keeps the artist connected to what he’s playing: nobody takes anything for granted.

Does this affect the emotional sense of your compositions? 
Yes, the emotional aspect concerns me as well. One song can cover a wide emotional range, which implies, among many other things, that dynamics would radically change during the development of the piece. I might have written more than 20 different versions of many of my tunes, the most sophisticated ones. I also might write simple forms, which usually happen to be the easier ones to adapt to different contexts. The more I go into complex forms, the more specific the writing has to be, as I usually write knowing exactly who’s going to play every part of it, who’s going to take the solo section, who’s going to play the lead voice, etc. That makes each musician more comfortable as they feel you’re aware of their possibilities and this is what you want, to make people around you shine as much as possible.

How do you lead the band on stage? 
My rule as a bassist is to push the band and spread the energy, to conduct with my playing into the dynamic changes, and this can only be executed by great skilled sidemen with a sense of drama and a sense of humour. I also totally believe in the concept of “group” as a team, more than a bunch of musicians strategically placed on stage or studio under marketing criteria.

You are eclectic, something evident in Líbera, one of your richest and most appealing projects. Líbera is alive, a changing body in constant evolution. 
The Líbera project was created in 2010 and was supposed to be [performed by] a work in progress band. It started as a trio and now we are eight people on stage! I’ve been adding musicians according to the evolution of the music and in 2012 we did a record. But this album, for which I’ve been working on postproduction, for two years, still hasn’t seen the light. I’ve been waiting for the right moment for this record to be published and I feel that now’s the time! It will soon be issued by the Temps label. Being, as you say, a very eclectic project, Líbera is very difficult to define. It covers a wide range of feelings, from punk to rhumba to free jazz, and flows from very lyrical moments to a really intense rhythmic activity. There’s still a lot I feel I can do with this band. Let’s hope that in the near future Barcelona will be able to provide more spaces and clubs to play experimental music, because there’s a huge scene around here with brilliant ideas and a potentially growing audience.

Who is your music aimed at, other musicians or an audience with a large capacity for the abstract, or both? 
I try to be as honest as possible with my work and what I want to explore in music; I always write what I can sing and try to avoid unnecessary elements. I also try to never forget that there’s an audience that deserves the best from the band. And to me the best I can do for both the audience and my music is to carry on juxtaposing different elements in order to reach all kinds of possible moods through the notes. So this is not only a matter of eclectic music taste, which is something really common in today’s creative musicians, but a matter of feeling an emotional range you’re able to provide to the public.

You are also working on a new album with your trio, recorded at SFJAZZ Center last June. What will we find in it? 
Listeners will find in the Giulia Valle Trio a group that speaks with its own voice and that has been playing together for more than seven years in the Giulia Valle Quintet, a band that I’ve already recorded four albums with. Both piano player Marco Mezquida and drummer David Xirgu are unique and great musicians. Marco has an overwhelming energy and virtuosity and is a team player. As for David he’s considered one of today’s most creative drummers. He has played and recorded with many important jazz musicians such as Ben Monder, Dave Douglas, John Abercrombie, Vince Mendoza and Mark Feldman. He is one of the most intelligent musicians I’ve ever played with.

What are the main characteristics of the music you shape for this trio? 
Being a piano-based trio and not a sextet, some part of the writing gets lost, however some new dimensions emerge through specific voicing and chords, as well as new instrumental interactions. I could define the music as a strange ensemble of cool and different melodies that work over more or less complex rhythmic patterns: easy to follow but very tricky at the same time. I could also define it as unpredictable and intense. I think that any further consideration should come from the listeners!

Did the American audience give you good feedback? 
The audience’s feedback was just great. To perform in the States should be a must for any jazz musician, if I can be defined as a jazz musician. I’m not that sure I fit into that pattern though.

Could we consider these projects as different but complementary?
I guess so: Líbera and the trio’s album are going to be, respectively, my sixth and seventh record. And while Líbera floats into a more abstract concept, the trio provides a much more “figurative” side of my music. But there’s still a lot to say, or at least I hope so. And the more I go on, the more I dig simplicity, both in art and in life. ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202496.35/warc/CC-MAIN-20190321051516-20190321073516-00113.warc.gz

 Before we get to the message, let us praise the logistics management. What poor, sleep-deprived soul was tasked with editing down Friday evening’s White House jazz concert, hosted by the Obamas, which stretched toward two and a half resourcefully efficient hours, into the single hour that aired on network television Saturday night? It was a necessary duty, sure, but also an absurd one. This was already an all-star bonanza engineered like a Swiss watch. Headliner-caliber musicians from around the globe rotated in and out with enough ease to suggest an oldies roadshow. Individual performances were kept to pop length but didn’t feel truncated.

Well, with some exceptions. Chick Corea, on keys, guitarist John McLaughlin, Wayne Shorter, on soprano saxophone, tabla master Zakir Hussain, trumpeter Terence Blanchard, electric bassist Marcus Miller, drummer Kendrick Scott and second keyboardist John Beasley performed Miles’ “Spanish Key,” to a three-minute countdown projected onto the house teleprompter. With a harder-grooving backbeat than the headlong surge of the Bitches Brew version, and more emphasis on the themes, it was a jazz-rock moment worth savoring. As a colleague to my right chuckled, he could have used plenty more of that. I felt the same way, about the program on the whole.

Practice is making perfect for UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador Herbie Hancock and musical director Beasley. The show was the centerpiece of this year’s International Jazz Day, a celebration launched by UNESCO and the Thelonious Monk Institute in 2012, and bookended that year by concerts in New Orleans and New York. It has since been centralized in Istanbul, Osaka and Paris, with satellite events in nearly all of the world’s nations. Its goal, explicated in many earnest speeches, is to hold up jazz as an allegory for the kind of global democracy and dynamic interdependence that human civilization should strive for. Which might seem a quixotic aim in the age of ISIS and total-loser! tweets, but that doesn’t make it any less honest or real.

In opening remarks so deft you might have wondered what professional cultural critic was called in for the assist, the President outlined jazz as an American art form generated by the black American experience and gifted to the world. “It speaks to something universal about our humanity-the restlessness that stirs in every soul, the desire to create with no boundaries,” he said. The concert, hosted by Morgan Freeman and held in a soundstage-equipped tent on the South Lawn, bore those sentiments out while also reflecting the multicultural reality of the current jazz-festival scene-pop and R&B concessions included. It was a generous, engaging representation of the music tailored for TV, with a blind spot for the avant-garde-understandable given the circumstances, until you recall that George Wein booked Cecil Taylor at the White House in 1978, to Jimmy Carter’s eventual delight. Some sort of acknowledgement of recent Pulitzer Prize-winner Henry Threadgill would also have been welcome.

If you’ve watched or attended any of the previous Jazz Day shows, or the gala concerts that close each year’s Thelonious Monk competition, the cast and flow would have been familiar; there, musicians end up in sometimes head-scratching combinations, but things tend to work, with enough solo space to understand where a given player is coming from. A few of jazz’s contemporary marquee artists were surprisingly absent-say, Jon Batiste, Gregory Porter, Cécile McLorin Salvant, Kamasi Washington and the trumpeter who is arguably the most famous living jazz musician, Wynton Marsalis-but the music’s celebrities overflowed still.

There were also celebrities, period. Aretha Franklin, singing and playing piano, accompanied by Hancock on keyboard, bassist Christian McBride and drummer Brian Blade, offered an oddly bittersweet opener with “A Song for You,” and turned up later during a Prince tribute, taking her still-striking vocal instrument to “Purple Rain.” That medley homage also featured Hancock, keyboardist Robert Glasper, saxophonist Terrace Martin, guitarist Lionel Loueke, bassist Ben Williams, drummer Terri Lyne Carrington and, driving home a smartly chosen nod to jazz and hip-hop’s abiding kinship, the MC Rapsody. Sting, introduced by Helen Mirren and backed by guitarist Pat Metheny, Hancock, Glasper, Loueke, Miller and Carrington, crooned through his spiritual-noir groover “Sister Moon.” He gravitated toward the grand piano and Hancock, whose solos were daring given the context, forcing aggressive, etude-like lines atop seductive R&B.

In all, and not unexpectedly, this was a vocal-heavy program. Al Jarreau, with Corea, McBride, Blade, guitarist Lee Ritenour and saxophonist Sadao Watanabe, acted as ambassador for jazz’s more intellectual and idiomatic voice traditions, giving a tutorial in vocalese and scat on “Take Five.” Dianne Reeves also made her mastery of wordless singing known, on Metheny’s “Minuano,” alongside the guitarist, pianist Danilo Pérez, Beasley, Hussain, McBride and Scott. Reeves’ athleticism also came to the fore during the tongue-twisting climax to her “Nine,” where her band included bassist Esperanza Spalding, who didn’t sing until the evening’s finale, an all-hands-on-deck take on John Lennon’s “Imagine”-a requisite “We Are the World” moment.

Two pop-jazz marvels delivered their respective gifts. Jamie Cullum, per usual a ball of barely contained energy, sang “Just One of Those Things,” fronting the band of German trumpeter Till Brönner, saxophonist Bobby Watson, Williams and Blade. Diana Krall, in duo with Christian McBride, swung slyly through “East of the Sun (and West of the Moon).” Pointing up how effectively jazz can serve as hammy, humor-soaked entertainment, Dee Dee Bridgewater and Kurt Elling dueted on “St. James Infirmary,” with proper New Orleanian backing from Trombone Shorty and the Rebirth horns, plus pianist Kris Bowers, Williams and Blade.

Latin-jazz was showcased via a performance of Bebo Valdés’ “Con Poco Coco,” by an ensemble boasting the composer’s son, pianist Chucho Valdés, saxophonist and clarinetist Paquito D’Rivera (invoking “Tequila” liberally), Hussain, Loueke, Williams and the Australian trumpet virtuoso James Morrison, who wasted no time before flaunting his high-note technique. Hard blues got its due in the scrappy and stinging licks of Buddy Guy, performing his “Meet Me in Chicago.” Postbop was underscored twice, first with a steamrolling rendition of Corea’s “Straight Up and Down,” charged through by the pianist plus saxophonist David Sánchez, Blanchard, McBride and Blade. Later, pianist Joey Alexander, Spalding and Shorter, again on soprano, played Shorter’s “Footprints,” in a way that allowed 12-year-old Alexander to impress the core jazz audience deeply, perhaps at the expense of the laypeople. In plainer language, he played with all of the harmonic artfulness, clever use of space and dynamic nuance you’d expect from a veteran professional who is sincerely seeking out the essence of the music at hand. This was not the Joey Alexander Prodigy Show; he wasn’t cute or circuslike, just excellent.

Illustrating jazz that is conceptually self-contained, that exists for its own sake, was an essential and wise programming decision. But time was also reserved for music that directly engaged with International Jazz Day’s credos. No performance spoke truth to power more pointedly than when Hugh Masekela, on flugelhorn, sang and played his “Bring Him Back Home (Nelson Mandela),” along with Bridgewater, Bowers, Ritenour, Brönner, Watson, Miller, Scott and the Israeli saxophonist Eli Degibri. Composed three decades ago, when Masekela was in exile from apartheid-torn South Africa, it was a reminder of the tangential social might of music, and how it can act as a force of human influence to transcend all manner of speechifying.

The program mostly did the jazz tradition proud, as well as the tradition of hosting jazz in the White House, a narrative that includes the Nixon, Carter and Clinton administrations. Most important, it served as one component of a bigger picture. To say nothing of the Jazz Day satellite events happening the world over, Washington hosted a dense map of special events on the following Saturday, including workshops, panel discussions, film screenings and performances by local and national musicians. In the case of Reeves’ early-afternoon quartet gig at an area church, sponsored by the shelter organization Thrive DC, that meant a mix of both. Fronting the combo of pianist Cyrus Chestnut, bassist James King and drummer Nasar Abadey, Reeves used the cavernous, sloppily resonant acoustics to her advantage in stunning ways. Summits during the brief set came early and often; to open, she sang and scatted “All Blues” off-mic, and to absorb her crystalline vocal gymnastics in that low-key setting was akin to watching LeBron James shoot around a local high school gymnasium. Another Saturday highlight was a conversation on human rights featuring UNESCO Director General Irina Bokova, former Minister of Justice of France Christiane Taubira, Hancock and Masekela. In these settings, the South African icon tends to steal the show, albeit unintentionally; his brilliantly patient sense of humor-a necessary buffer for the gravity of the experiences he describes-is irresistible. But he’d already made his most salient points the night prior. ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912204969.39/warc/CC-MAIN-20190326095131-20190326121131-00415.warc.gz
26,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/final-chorus/born-in-israel/,"Randy Weston can’t be mistaken for anyone else. As he once said, “I don’t like the electric piano because my sound is my voice, and my voice is what makes me unique. A personal sound is the most difficult thing to achieve-it’s an extension of yourself.”

I have been listening often to the unmistakably personal voice of pianist/composer Anat Fort on her recently released ECM CD, A Long Story. Like Anat Cohen and other Israeli musicians who came here from the lively Israeli jazz scene, Fort has worked New York clubs. As of this writing, an evening with Fort is scheduled at the Rubin Museum of Art on June 27 as part of the JVC Jazz Festival.

Fort assures me that she also does not play electric piano, and she feels constricted by the term “jazz.” So did Charles Mingus, who insisted he played “Mingus music.” On her CD, while there is much deeply intimate and reflective lyrical music, there are bursts of forceful swinging. All but one of the tracks are her compositions, and each is an extension of her personal voice.

Born near Tel Aviv, she started on the piano when she was 6, and though classically trained, Fort was always driven to improvise. “It drove my teachers mad,” she says. “But I was far more into improvising on Chopin’s music than just playing it straight. Some classical players are afraid of improvisation, but that’s what makes me buzz.” It wasn’t until her late teens that she truly found her jazz calling. “I was listening to the radio [at] about three in the morning, and I heard John Coltrane playing ‘You Don’t Know What Love Is.’ I couldn’t go back to sleep.”

I asked why Coltrane had so jolted her. “The sound was such a unique voice, so much like himself because it sounded like no other voice. It really spoke to me! It got me where it really mattered.” The next day she bought the recording at a Tel Aviv music shop. Inevitably, Fort came to the United States to study jazz. Her teachers have included Rufus Reid and Harold Mabern, and a vital part of her education in this music of autobiographical improvisation came from her studies in the jazz program at the William Paterson University of New Jersey. (In a future column, I’ll try to indicate why that is one of the premier immersions into this music of insistent self-discovery. Clark Terry is vividly associated with the program.)

Although Fort’s reputation keeps growing on the New York scene, where she has been based since 1996, she is binational, often going back to Israel to perform and to fulfill composing commissions, like her arrangements of Israeli songs (“my standards, in a way”) for the Tel Aviv Opera House, where she also performed last year. Her American influences, she notes, include Bill Evans, Keith Jarrett and Paul Bley. (One day I’d like to see a penetrating study of Bley’s impact on many players’ lives over the years. His playing and writing are still underappreciated.)

For Fort, a key figure in jazz has been Paul Motian since she first heard him on a Bill Evans record. “I was blown away,” she recalls, “and I dreamt of someday playing with him.” Bassist Ed Schuller turned out to be the matchmaker when, in New York, she started working with Schuller, who had been in many of Motian’s bands.

Now was the time to find out if her dream could come true. When Schuller called Motian to be part of Fort’s ECM CD, “My first reaction,” says Motian, “was to say ‘no’ because I didn’t know her music.” But Schuller persuaded him to come to the date anyway. And as in an Anat Fort dream, Motian was so surprised and pleased that, he says, “I liked the music so much that I recommended it to ECM. And I love the way the album came out.”

So do I. Along with Schuller and Motian, yet another singular jazz voice is present: Perry Robinson on clarinet and ocarina. As Richard Cook writes in his invaluable Jazz Encyclopedia (Penguin), “Robinson is one of the very few to make a go of creating a place for the clarinet in the jazz avant-garde.” Actually, whatever “avant-garde” means in the flow of fashion, Robinson plays what I call “soul music.”

In Steve Lake’s excellent liner notes for A Long Story, he says Fort “is an intuitive musician firstly … Israel being a complex melting pot, [her] memories may also include glimpses of an older Eastern European heritage.” And Fort adds: “Sometimes I’ll listen back and hear echoes of Gypsy music or Russian music.” Also in her personal roots are echoes of klezmer improvisers that bring me back to the music I first heard as a child at Jewish weddings. One afternoon, after expressing delight to the clarinetist in the swinging klezmer band, he winked at me and asked, “Where you think Benny Goodman came from?”

Hearing Fort tell of how Coltrane’s transformation of “You Don’t Know What Love Is” changed her life, I also remembered what changed mine when I was 11 years old. Until then, the only music that had gotten me where it mattered was the improvising cantors in the synagogues and the klezmer players. But one afternoon, on a Boston street, coming from a record store, I heard Artie Shaw’s “Nightmare” and yelled aloud in joyous pleasure. Years later, I found that Shaw had based “Nightmare” on a ningun, the kind of melody that the cantors used to improvise on. In Anat Fort’s music, I also hear an imperishable flavor of ninguns and, as Dizzy Gillespie used to say, the endless, flowing music of the universe. ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912206677.94/warc/CC-MAIN-20190326220507-20190327002507-00296.warc.gz
27,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/final-chorus/he-made-festivals-happen/,"I first met George Wein in 1949, when he was a pianist working with the renowned Edmond Hall at the Savoy Café, Boston’s “Home of Hot Rhythm.” In 2005, the National Endowment for the Arts designated Wein a Jazz Master (Jazz Advocate Division) “for dedication to the advancement (and perpetuation) of jazz,” adding that “Wein has had a mighty hand in shaping the course of jazz both on and off the bandstand.” The citation omitted a most valuable achievement by this impresario: He has provided more jazz musicians with jobs than anyone so far in the history of the music. In addition to running far-flung festivals in this country and abroad, Wein began the “jazz festival era” in 1954 in Newport-the first jazz festival in the United States. At George’s request, I wrote what turned out to be a wooden history of the music for, as I remember, Stan Kenton to deliver to start off that event. Fortunately, it was immediately submerged in the exhilaration of the music. On recordings and in memories, the following Newport years included the regeneration of the careers of Miles Davis and Duke Ellington amid an actual living history of the music. Also, some of the panel discussions presaged the current growing focus on jazz education. At jazz historian Marshall Stearn’s invitation, for example, folklorist Willis James illustrated the pre-blues field hollers and the pre-gospel music at the roots of jazz. When the New York Times reported on Jan. 25 that George had sold his Festival Productions company to the Festival Network, I recalled many of those summer afternoons, and realized that for all my occasional criticism of George’s programming over the years, he has indeed been a vital force in “shaping the course of jazz.” It is not in his nature to retire, however. George will have a direct role in the festivals he already produces, and will be consulted about the new ones in the now continuing, expanded international network. As for his merger with the Festival Network, George told me, “If I don’t like something they’re doing, they’ll hear from me-fast!” Characteristically, George insisted that as a condition of the sale, the jobs of his longtime colleagues would be protected for at least three years. And if anything goes wrong with that agreement, George adds, “I will protect them. They’re my family.” Among those remaining is publicity director Charles Bourgeois, whom I’ve known as a source and a friend for more than half a century. I see Charles as a kind of Fred Astaire of jazz promotion-his wit, graciousness, and steel-like integrity. With all the stories he can tell of his years in jazz, I keep hoping that Charles will write a memoir. The truly inside story of the Newport jazz festivals, under their various names-and of George’s long-term relationships with many of the entries in the Encyclopedia of Jazz-is his unusually candid book, Myself Among Others: A Life in Music, still available in paperback. Written with Nate Chinen, a chronicler of jazz for the New York Times as well as the magazine you’re reading now, it’s published by Da Capo Press. This book-an essential source for future historians, not only of the music but of its times-reflects a continual refrain by Bill Cosby in his foreword: “George ain’t afraid.” He is also more than an international impresario. He has devoted his life to this music and the family of jazz has included him. George started out as a player (he still works gigs as a pianist) and his life would have been barren without the music, particularly without his having known-off the stand as well as on-so many of its creators. Toward the end of his book, he writes of players who were sidemen during much of their careers. “What set them apart,” George writes, “was their humanity-which went even beyond that of an artist playing from his heart. In some musicians the feeling for communication transcends the music itself and becomes part of their personal life. “Buck [Clayton] and Buddy [Tate] and Sweets [Edison] and Clark [Terry] and a number of others like Willie ‘The Lion’ Smith-all had something very, very special as human beings; they were strong people, and had tremendous pride in what they could do. But if you showed them respect, their egos would not come into play… “This was a rare and special characteristic among these musicians, almost as special as the music that flowed through their bodies … They might not have been the geniuses [of the music], but they were the troops. They made jazz happen, and we owe them an unfathomable debt.” When I was interviewed recently by Loren Schoenberg for the Smithsonian Jazz Masters Oral History Collection, it was that passage in Myself Among Others that came back to me deeply. George and I have known many of the same musicians-starting at the Savoy and then at Storyville, the jazz room he created. During the oral history interviews, as I went back to the sidemen and the leaders, I realized with particular acuteness how impoverished, how diminished, my life would have been if-starting in my early 20s-it had not been continually regenerated by the conversations and the storytelling of these “very special human beings.” They were so singularly special that they could have been in classic novels-the ones that George names and also Frankie Newton, Herbie Nichols, Rex Stewart, Paul Desmond, Charles Mingus, Thelonious Monk, Jim Hall, Al Morgan, Marian McPartland, Pee Wee Russell, Mary Lou Williams and many, many more-including George Wein. Read Lee Mergner’s Farewell remembrance of Nat Hentoff. ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912206677.94/warc/CC-MAIN-20190326220507-20190327002507-00256.warc.gz
28,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/final-chorus/oprah-the-jazz-image/,"Preparing for an interview at New York’s Blue Note jazz club with Ron Carter-master bassist, cellist, challenging leader and composer-I read something he said in Jazz Improv-New York that is seldom said in public: “The black press, the black media has a great deal of responsibility for the lack of-and the possibility of-increasing the visibility and viability of jazz.”

In our conversation, Ron elaborated: “Papers like the Amsterdam News, the Chicago Defender, the L.A. Sentinel, the Pittsburgh Courier, assuming all of them still exist, they
have a responsibility not just to advertise Kangol hats and the latest wedding and church services, but also to say, ‘This music is your contribution to more than your neighborhood!'”

I told him that when I was in my teens, I’d regularly read some of those newspapers for civil rights news, but hardly ever found any jazz. But speaking of spreading the word, I said to Ron, “Currently the major figure in media, all across the country, is Oprah Winfrey. Has she heard much jazz?”

“No,” he said. “The story is she’s not a fan of the music. A person like her has so much power. She’ll say, ‘This is my favorite book of the month,’ and it’ll sell a million copies in two weeks. She makes stuff move!”

“Maybe,” I asked, “since she’s a strong supporter of Barack Obama, if he knows anything about jazz, he can get her involved.”

“Well, the story is that he’s got John Coltrane on his iPod, so we’ll see if Obama has interest in anything other than Coltrane.”

Since Ron mentioned the venerable and still forceful Amsterdam News in Harlem, I told him of the time when Adam Clayton Powell, the formidable congressman from Harlem, started a newspaper there in competition with “The Amsterdam,” as it was called. I knew the editor, and often saw him at jazz clubs, but the music was scarcely covered in the new paper. I asked him why. Usually forthright, the editor vamped for a while, and finally indicated that jazz didn’t have the “image” the paper wanted to be too closely associated with.

That reminded me of conversations I had long ago with Sterling Brown, an extraordinary poet, folklorist, expert on the blues, and author of such seminal books as Southern Road, for which James Weldon Johnson wrote the introduction, saying that Brown “had deepened the meaning and multiplied the implications of black folk poetry.”

Starting in 1929, Sterling Brown taught English for some 40 years at Howard University, where his papers are archived. When we spoke long ago, he startled me by saying that during all the time he was at Howard University, he was not allowed to include jazz in his courses. It was a question of the music’s origins in such bawdy places as Storyville in New Orleans, and its early denunciations in some pulpits as “the devil’s music.” A matter of “image.”

“So what I did,” Brown told me, “was bring in recordings such as Stravinsky’s ‘Ragtime’ and certain works by Darius Milhaud, who had been influenced by jazz.

“Then I’d say to the students, ‘Now I’ll show you where this music came from,’ and I’d put on some stride piano recordings by Luckey Roberts, and the music of Duke Ellington.”

Other jazz musicians who’d attended black colleges also told me that jazz was, to say the least, frowned on by those in charge.

In his introduction to Ralph Ellison’s masterly collection of writings on jazz, Living With Music (Modern Library), Professor Robert O’Meally, who founded the Center for Jazz Studies at Columbia University, where he taught comparative literature, writes of when Ellison appeared at Harvard University in 1973.

O’Meally, a student listening to the panel discussion, indicated to Ellison his concern that the contributions of black culture, including music, remained greatly unrecognized. He asked Ellison, “Don’t you think the Harlem Renaissance failed because we failed to create institutions to preserve our gains?”

Recalled O’Meally in the book’s introduction, “Given that I was a black student in a dashiki, he probably took this to be blankly black-nationalistic. Ralph Ellison drew on his cigar and calmly told me, ‘No.’

“Just before being led toward the stage, he paused to look at me with steely eyes. ‘We do have institutions,’ he said. ‘We have the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. And we have jazz.’

Sterling Brown, during all his years at Howard University, could only teach that truth indirectly. But these days, I’m told that at a number of predominantly black colleges and universities, jazz’s “image”-internationally and here-is one of respect and achievement.

I’d be grateful to learn about the current state of jazz at largely black colleges from students, faculty members and graduates. Please write me c/o JazzTimes.

Toward the end of my interview with Ron Carter, I asked how optimistic he is about the future of his calling. “One sign of jazz’s survival, in this country,” he said, “is that schools of high educational level, colleges and universities, are teaching it. And there are still jazz camps. There are some wonderful young players out there who are determined to make the music theirs. As long as they can maintain that focus, we’re going to hear the music and be with it for a very long time.”

In Paris in 1969, when Carter was being interviewed by Art Taylor for his indispensable book, Notes and Tones: Musician to Musician Interviews (Perigee Books), Ron spoke of “the awareness that black colleges must have of our music. I’ve played at some black colleges and we only get booked because the students raised such a clamor to get some jazz. The dean of the school, the dean of music, were making a point of not encouraging jazz.”

Wouldn’t it be splendid if Oprah Winfrey did a show with Ron, musicians from some of the black colleges and universities, and youngsters from all backgrounds from summer jazz camps? Maybe President Obama could do a walk-on. ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912203326.34/warc/CC-MAIN-20190324043400-20190324065400-00134.warc.gz
29,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/final-chorus/passing-the-jazz-torch/,"Jazz Boston's Pauline Bilsky Like many who care deeply about this music and hope for future generations to keep it thriving, JAZZed publisher Rick Kessel makes the obvious point that “to make sure the torch is passed,” there must be “writing, educating, and, of course, performing for as many young audiences as possible” (May 2011).

As I noted here last month, the non-profit organization JazzBoston, in its fifth year of swinging existence, is doing just that and more. For example, this year, a proclamation by Boston mayor Thomas Menino heralded the annual JazzBoston Jazz Week (April 29 – May 8), “which will include a wide variety of collaboratively planned, independently produced performances and educational events in all kinds of venues throughout the city of Boston.”

When I was on the full-time staff of radio station WMEX in Boston 60 years ago, I got to interview current and past mayors of Boston, and not one of them gave a damn about jazz. And when Fats Waller took me to dinner one evening at a hotel in town where he was playing, no one there seemed to be aware that an international celebrity was in the room. No autograph seekers or even looks in his direction.

Having been educated by JazzBoston, Mayor Menino cited in his proclamation “the unique mix of young musicians and internationally recognized artists living, teaching and performing here”-and participating in this year’s Jazz Week.

I have space for only a brief roster of the events I couldn’t have dreamed possible when, at 20, I suddenly decided never to return to Harvard Graduate School because Sidney Bechet was opening at the Savoy in Boston. I had discovered my vocation.

One Jazz Week presentation I wish I’d known about, “Nat Pierce, Jaki Byard, and the Battle of the Bands,” focused on two deceased musicians I knew very well. Presiding was Boston jazz historian Richard Vacca, who is working on a book that will be the first comprehensive history of Boston as a major presence in the story of jazz.

That Jazz Week program took place at the main Boston Public Library in Copley Square. As a kid, I was awed to be in the vastly engaging Boston Public Library; now, as a partner with JazzBoston, the library has funded what the organization describes as a multigenerational educational program encompassing all 26 branch libraries.

Here, as described on JazzBoston‘s website, is a challenge to library systems and educational institutions across the nation that would like to help young people in their cities learn more about this international language: Riffs & Raps: Jazz for All Ages, “a family of community-based programs designed to connect audiences from toddlers to seniors with the music and the musicians who make it.”

Among its progeny is Riffs & Raps: Find Your Jazz, an “innovative after-school program for teens in underserved communities,” using “jazz as a tool to introduce young people to the power of expression, build their confidence in themselves and their pride in their cultural heritage, and foster the development of the skills they need to succeed in work and life.”

What skills? Dig this: “Six weeks of hands-on workshops lead to a closing performance that puts the kids themselves up front with their teachers and other professional musicians. By performing their stories for an audience of parents and friends, they share their experience, and their pride, with their community.”

Shortly after Charlie Parker died, a greatly saddened Art Blakey said to me, “I wonder how many black kids knew who he was?” And how many white, Hispanic, Asian, Jewish, Christian and Native American kids knew? To be an American and know little or nothing of the most vital, life-enriching gift that this country has given the world is to be truly disadvantaged.

I keep being astonished at how creatively JazzBoston is passing the torch. At the heart of JazzBoston’s rhythm section is Executive Director Pauline Bilsky, a former trustee of the New York Foundation of the Arts and the manager of saxophonist, flutist and composer Henry Threadgill from 1990 to 1997. Since jazz had long been central to her life, on moving to Boston in 2005, she became involved with the formative nonprofit. “I want,” Pauline tells me, “to see jazz continue to evolve and continue to be part of daily life, especially the life of young people. And I want jazz musicians to have more places to perform.”

Almost every time I talk to her, she’s planning ahead. “Right now,” she says, “JazzBoston is facing the challenge of transitioning from a start-up to a stable sustaining organization that will be around for the long term. I have a vision for making that transition that I will soon present to JazzBoston’s board. Stay tuned.”

I will, and I’ll let you know, too. Meanwhile, another Riffs & Raps program, Jazzin’ the Generations, seeks to bridge the musical generation gap. Says Pauline, “[It] takes audiences from the roots of jazz in blues and spirituals through the Great American Songbook and right on to the sounds of today, with excursions into other music traditions at home and abroad. Informal conversations with the musicians during and after each performance engage audiences and entertain them.”

I haven’t been to Boston for years, but JazzBoston is drawing me back. Fortunate to be in JazzTimes, I can use this forum to help inspire other Pauline Bilskys around the nation to prove, as Sidney Bechet said, “You can’t keep this music down.” Pauline says she’s never worked harder in her life-but, she adds, “It’s fun.” That’s also what keeps jazz going.

30,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/final-chorus/torture-chamber-music/,"Rosanne Cash The restorative powers of music are being increasingly documented-as, for instance, in the Louis Armstrong Music Therapy program at New York’s Beth Israel Medical Center. But music can be used to torture, as I’ve discovered in my day job, reporting on the CIA’s “enhanced interrogations” in its allegedly closed secret prisons and during its “renditions.” The latter violations of international laws and our own involve kidnapping terrorism suspects and storing them in foreign prisons specializing in torture. There, music played incessantly at unremittingly high volume can “break” any prisoner.

I’ve written a number of syndicated columns about British citizen Binyam Mohamed who, finally released after years without charges, recalls his CIA experiences in our own overseas prison in Kabul, Afghanistan, and during “renditions”: “It was pitch black. … They hung me up for two days. My legs had swollen. My wrists and hands had gone numb. … There was loud music [by] Slim Shady and Dr. Dre for 29 days. … It got really spooky in this black hole.”

Since the CIA’s playlists are classified as “state secrets” (as are many other details of President Obama’s continuation of the Bush-Cheney “renditions”), I don’t know if any jazz combos, classic or cutting-edge, have been torture apprentices. But I expect that any of us for whom music of any category is a vital life force, would agree with Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine (reported by Andy Worthington on commondreams.org on Oct. 23): “The fact that music I helped create was used as a tactic against humanity sickens me. We need to end torture.” And Rosanne Cash, phoning the Washington Post, adds: “I think every musician should be involved. … Music should never be used as torture. … It’s beyond the pale. It’s hard to even think about.”

Cash’s call to the Washington Post resulted in this report by Eva Rodriguez there on Oct. 29: “Rosanne and crew filed Freedom of Information requests with some 10 U.S. agencies demanding all records pertaining to ‘the use of loud music during detention and/or as technique to interrogate detainees at U.S.-operated prison facilities in its War on Terror at Guantanamo, Iraq and Afghanistan during 2002 to the present.” (They omitted the CIA secret prisons.)

Note that her FOIA request was made toward the end of 2009! Soon after taking office, President Obama pledged to end the Bush-Cheney no-longer-secret practice of torture. So why are he and his CIA director, Leon Panetta, continuing CIA “renditions”? They won’t tell us, despite Obama also promising to stop the Bush administration’s use of “state secrets” to end court trials involving torture before any evidence is even heard.

But Obama is vigorously wielding the “state secrets” privilege in several so far aborted court cases in which his administration demands secrecy even beyond the Bush-Cheney Justice Department. So we may never know who else is on those CIA playlists-and which CIA music critics put them there. We do know this from Andy Worthington on commondreams.org about further musicians’ protests: “As was reported widely yesterday, also launching a formal protest against the use of music as torture were REM, Pearl Jam, Trent Reznor … Jackson Browne, Billy Bragg, Michelle Branch, T-Bone Burnett, David Byrne, Rosanne Cash, Marc Cohn, Steve Earle, the Entrance Band, Joe Henry, Bonnie Raitt, Rage Against the Machine, and The Roots.”

I don’t know if any of them are on President Obama’s iPod, but I’ve heard that John Coltrane is, among other jazz musicians. This prez obviously cares about music. Since he has continued the “legal black holes” of “renditions,” is he at all troubled by the possibility that other terrorism suspects are being relentlessly assaulted by music in what the CIA used to call “black sites”?

This formal request by these musicians-also demanding song titles [for royalties?]-was filed by the valuable non-government National Security Archive in Washington. It has a good track record on penetrating government secrets, and I am impressed that this large part of the music community has done more than express “disgust” (Rosanne Cash’s term) at the defilement of their music by their own government. They’re actually trying to do something about it. Jazz musicians should not sit on the sidelines, but should get involved too. Jazz is an expression of freedom and the way music has been used in these facilities is an affront to that freedom and our rule of law.

If you want to know more about the extent and depth of torture in our name, the most definitive book so far is Administration of Torture: A Documentary Record from Washington to Abu Ghraib and Beyond by Jameel Jaffer and Amrit Singh of the American Civil Liberties Union (Columbia University Press).

Included are official autopsy reports (detailing the tortures), e-mails from FBI agents in the field aghast at these practices and interrogation directives, among many other government documents. Says one dedicated interrogator, describing preferred techniques: “sleep deprivation, white noise … fear of dogs and snakes appear to work nicely. I firmly agree that the gloves need to come off.” That last phrase is exactly what Dick Cheney said soon after 9/11. There are musicians, including many jazz musicians, who have the ear of Barack Obama. I wish they’d tell him-as Bessie Smith, Louis Armstrong, Dizzy Gillespie and John Coltrane would have-“Dammit, put those gloves back on!”

31,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/flatfive/inspiration-information-shuggie-otis-takes-manhattan/,"Shuggie Otis, Highline Ballroom, NYC 1-10-13 When the 59-year-old Shuggie Otis played Manhattan’s Highline Ballroom Jan. 10, his first New York City date since 2001, the buzz was palpable in the room. The West Coast-based soul/funk singer/songwriter/guitarist has largely been out of the limelight since the 1974 release of his third album for Epic Records, Inspiration Information.

On the recording of Inspiration Information, now a cult classic, Otis, the son of legendary rhythm and blues bandleader Johnny Otis, played virtually all of the instruments, and arranged and produced the album as well. The psychedelic-cum-romantic, Hendrix-esque lyrics are his too. Released in the era of Herbie Hancock and the Headhunters and a year after Pink Floyd’s Dark Side of the Moon, Inspiration Information is also one of the earliest examples of electronic music, featuring synthesizer sequencing that would seem passé today-if the music weren’t so delightfully damn campy. And perhaps it is in consideration of this, that on April 3, 2001, it was rereleased on Luaka Bop Records, David Byrne’s independent label. The reissue that came on the heels of a new vogue for the album in the ’90s features the nine original tracks, plus four tunes from his 1971 record (released on Epic), Freedom Flight, which features Otis’ classic, “Strawberry Letter 23,” covered by the funk group the Brothers Johnson, who launched their version of the song to number one on the Billboard Top R&B Singles chart in 1977 (Quincy Jones was the producer). Despite a performance in Otis’ hometown of Los Angeles in December that, according to critics, did not go smoothly at all, Otis’ New York City performance was a magical event. The concert was stellar, actually doing justice to Otis’ studio genius.

On April 16, Epic/Legacy will rerelease Inspiration Information once again, this time with four unreleased tracks, plus a second CD of 14 previously unreleased tunes, Wings of Love. In April, Otis will hit the road again for a more extensive tour. Otis took to the stage of the Highline with a full band: bass guitar, Hammond B3 organ, synth, drums and a three-piece horn section. He was wearing a long black coat and puffy white scarf: “New York City is a gas!” he exclaimed. “I went over to Sony music and met some of the most beautiful people I’ve ever met in my life.”

Otis played a red ’60s Gibson ES-335 sent through a “toy box” of old-school effects such as phaser, wah-wah and fuzz, and then into a Marshall stack amplifier. For some of the tunes, he switched to a black Stratocaster, strung for a left-handed player (although he played it right-handed). He opened the evening with “Inspiration Information” the title track to the aforementioned album, and closed with a double encore of  “Strawberry Letter 23” and “Ice Cold Daydream” from Freedom Flight.

Throughout the evening, Otis played songs from Inspiration Information and Wings of Love. His soulful vocals evoked a wide range between guttural throat clearing and high-pitched falsetto; his rhythm guitar playing was akin to that of Curtis Mayfield.  As Otis revived his classic repertoire with the delicate groove of “Aht Uh Mi Hed” and the stop-and-start tempo-shifting funk dance “Sparkle City,” an invisible Day-Glo rainbow of nostalgic psychedelia flashed over the ballroom. The title track from Wings of Love, meanwhile, featured a two-chord vamp with the Stratocaster dripping in phaser, chunking out the simple harmony. Many may have wondered over the years where Shuggie Otis went but there is no denying that he’s back.

32,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/flatfive/john-scofield-in-jerusalem/,"John Scofield appeared at The Jerusalem Theatre in Jerusalem, Israel, on June 4, 2012 with his quartet. I had a chance to catch up with him backstage.

Scott Krane: We’re here in Jerusalem, the symbolic home of the three monotheistic religions. Now, Piety Street, is a gospel project. Let’s talk spirituality…On your website you say this hasn’t been done before. I was wondering if you remember the record The Word with Robert Randolph and John Medeski?

Oh, I guess it had been done before. Did I say on my website that it hadn’t been done before?

Well, you said something to that effect. 

I was trying to be humorous, but, actually the word is a great example of what we tried to do on Piety Street.

That is an example? 

That is an example.

So you weren’t necessarily trying anything new? 
Well, the whole thing of jazz and gospel is that they are very related and jazz music and gospel have always been that way. So Piety Street is not new at all in that way.

Well, it’s a great album. 

Thank you

Thank you. You’re mentioning Steve Berger on your site. Do you still have Doug Proper work on your guitars? 

Well, Doug Proper has done some work for me and Steve Berger too, and I have another guy who I really like, who works on my Ibanez. It’s a company called Imai Guitars. So I use a lot of guys to fix my guitars.

Who are you playing with tonight? 

Tonight is a quartet with Bill Stewart on drums, Ben Street on bass and Mike Eckroth on piano. I’ve been playing with these guys a while. This is the same group that you can hear on a live DVD that we put out last year called Live in Paris. It’s a really nice quartet. I’ve been playing with Bill Stewart for over twenty years and Ben Street is one of the really good bass players on the scene in New York. And Mike I met when he was a student as NYU and I was teaching there.

Are you still teaching at NYU? 

Yeah, I do it seven days a semester.

Are you teaching guitar, or jazz theory? 

Guitar. Well, I do two things. I am teaching a guitar class which is really like a combo. And then I do an ensemble where we play my music.

Now, changing gears. You know, Chuck Brown just died last month. 

Bustin’ Loose! Chuck Brown. Bustin’ Loose! I love that stuff. When I first learned about Go-Go music it was from Dennis Chambers the drummer. He’s from Baltimore. There is a lot of Go-Go music in Baltimore as well as Washington D.C. This was back in the early ’80s. I had a tune that we were rehearsing and he put a Go-Go beat on it. That tune was “Blue Matter.” So, Dennis got me into Go-Go, and Chuck Brown, he was the king.

Can you talk about upcoming projects? 

I don’t even know what my next record’s going to be. I put out a record called A Moment’s Peace, that’s all ballads. That is me and Larry Goldings on all his different keyboards. Some original, some standards. Brian Blade played drums, Scott Colley played bass. I got to make a new record now but I don’t know what the concept is going to be. I have like ten concepts floating around. I’ve got to choose.

Is that it for you? Are you a strictly conceptual player and writer? How do we look at Scofield in the jazz canon? 

Well, I like fusion and I like funk and I like jazz bebop. And I like playing free music sometimes. I don’t have any one style.  I guess the way I play is my sound, and I try to make that work in different ways that are fun.

But there is no pressure to be a straight ahead player? 
Actually, I love straight-ahead. Tonight we’ll be playing bebop tunes because I love listening to that music.

Do you have a set list? 

Yeah. You wanna see it? It may get tweaked a little. “Steeplechase,” the Charlie Parker tune. “Green Tea,” I did that with Medeski Martin and Wood on A Go Go. “Season Creek,” the third tune, it will be a world premiere tonight. I just wrote it; we just rehearsed it. “Slinky,” that’s a tune I’ve been doing with these guys a while, you can hear on that live DVD I was talking about.

How long have you been playing with this quartet? 

Two years. Then, “Still Water,” we’re going to play that, that’s a real old one of mine, then, “Woody’n you,” that’s a Dizzy Gillespie jazz classic. “I Want to Talk About You,” that’s from my new record, and Coltrane played that.

You know what that means. That means you have to do the five minute…

Cadenza…

Are you allowed to do that? 

I am allowed to. I don’t know if I could do it. [laughs] ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912205597.84/warc/CC-MAIN-20190326160044-20190326182044-00122.warc.gz

In 2001, The Smithsonian launched Jazz Appreciation Month, which has grown to include celebrations in all 50 states and 40 countries that the music as a living treasure. It is designed to spotlight the music and, one would hope, extend the depth of that appreciation to casual listeners, and introduce it to fresh ears that have been tuned elsewhere. It is a movement that has a lot of variations and offshoots.

Last June while meeting here in Rhode Island, the U.S Conference of Mayors proclaimed April 9 as Jazz Day. Jazz at Lincoln Center is using that day for its inaugural A Taste of Jazz event in Manhattan, which will feature music and food at the Time Warner Center to celebrate the cuisine of some of the country’s greatest jazz cities, including New Orleans. The musical set and discussion that night will feature a septet led by saxophonist Walter Blanding.

Oh, but there is much more here and there. As they say in the TV genre, check local listings.

From April 23 to May 2, the nonprofit JazzBoston is celebrating Jazz Week with 230 events at more than 80 venues to celebrate the special role the Boston jazz scene plays as incubator and stage for a lot of creative musicians. Only in greater Boston, it seems, can a “week” have 10 days. But that 10-day period, Made in Boston, Played in Boston, will include a lot of great programming, including rare films, jazz dance, and children’s events. Here is the schedule.

But wait, there’s more

SIRIUS XM Radio is paying tribute to the rich history of jazz with a lot of Jazz Appreciation Month programming. Its Real Jazz channel, SIRIUS channel 72 and XM channel 70, kicked off the month on April 1 with bassist Christian McBride hosting a three-hour JAM preview, and to introduce the debut of his SIRIUS XM show, The Lowdown: Conversations with Christian, which premiered yesterday and will air every Saturday at 1 p.m. ET on Real Jazz.

Also on April 9 – Jazz Appreciation Day – on Sirius, Jazz at Lincoln Center Artistic Director Wynton Marsalis will unveil the 2010-2011 season of Jazz at Lincoln Center at 3 p.m. ET on RealJazz, and Nancy Sinatra will present a special edition of Nancy For Frank, showcasing the jazz side of American Songbook legend and her father, Frank Sinatra, on April 9 at 3 p.m. ET on Siriusly Sinatra, SIRIUS channel 75 and XM channel 73. There is much more to discover on the Sirius channels. (For more information, visit the Sirius web site or the XM web site.)

Jazz Day, Jazz Week, Jazz Appreciation Month. (The latter may have the only acronym I can tolerate.) All of this is admirable. It also begs the question – How much of this is just preaching to the choir? Some of us would argue that in our in our hearts, in our psyches, in our ears, and in the venues to which we go… every day is jazz day. And that’s just the listeners. It certainly is true for the musicians, at least as a goal.

If the April spotlight in some way brings more serious listeners to the music – and more opportunities for musicians to play jazz – these initiatives are doing what their creators and supporters are seeking.

 This is the 16th consecutive year that faculty members from Boston’s Berklee College of Music will jet to San Juan for one of its (now global) outreach programs. Berklee in Puerto Rico will provide classes and award $300,000 in scholarships for young musicians to attend Berklee. Saxophonist Miguel Zenon, a participant in Berklee in Puerto Rico’s first year, is one of more than 100 such scholarship recipients from Puerto Rico.

This year, more than 200 young musicians will take part in the program June 1 to 6 at Escuela de Bellas Artes de Carolina. And on the final day of the jazz education program, a group of top students will perform as the opener at the Puerto Rico Heineken JazzFest’s final evening at the Tito Puente Amphitheater in San Juan. (This year’s festival runs June 3 to 6.)

Berklee will also honor Puerto Rico’s strong musical roots that evening by awarding an honorary doctor of music to percussionist, composer and bandleader Giovanni Hidalgo (pictured).

The Puerto Rico native is considered one of the best conga players of his generation – and possibly the fastest. Hidalgo, a member of late trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie’s adventurous United Nation Orchestra, taught in Berklee’s percussion department from 1992 to 1996.

Hidalgo will receive his honorary degree in a terrific festival spotlight: between sets of the festival’s finale. It is a big band extravaganza featuring 10 special guests: Eddie Gomez, Dave Valentín, Paquito D’Rivera, Michel Camilo, Alex Acuña, Eddie Palmieri, Chick Corea, Andy González, Gato Barbieri – and conguero Hidalgo.

That evening figures to be a dandy – and a great way to put a wrap on the festival’s 20th annual edition To read more of Ken Franckling’s blogs, you can also go to his  blog site. ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912203991.44/warc/CC-MAIN-20190325133117-20190325155117-00270.warc.gz
35,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/franckling/looking-at-festivals-at-newport-saratoga/,"George Wein’s team released the full CareFusion Newport Jazz Festival schedule for the August 6 to 8 weekend in the Rhode Island resort city. It’s a wide-ranging musical agenda – from mainstream jazz to Latin, traditional swing, instrumental pop, the avant-garde and a jazzy take on hip-hop. The  lineup is peppered with a lot of up-and-comers. See the link for a full schedule, but I will note some groupings of interest.

By the way, ticket sales start on Friday, March 26 – and there is a great discount for something new – advance walkup sales at the Newport Convention and Visitors Bureau downtown before April 9 ($50 per day instead of the usual $69).

So here’s my take on the Newport schedule:

English piano jazz poster Jamie Cullum is the Friday night headliner at Newport Casino, with teenage alto sax phenom/vocalist Grace Kelly opening. Cullum is also back at Fort Adams on Saturday afternoon. Let’s hope he avoids the 2008 Chris Botti faux pas – when the trumpeter played the exact same set in both venues, right down to the stage patter. And let’s hope Botti brings some new music and conversation for his Sunday appearance rather than rehash 2008.

Chick Corea, Kenny Garrett, Christian McBride and Roy Haynes headline Saturday as the Freedom Band. The main stage opens with Jazz Mafia’s Brass Bows & Beats – a 45-piece Hip Hop Symphony. Ahmad Jamal and the Maria Schneider Orchestra complete the main stage on day one. There is lots to savor on the two supplemental stages, including the trio Fly, Darcy James Argue’s Secret Society big band with special guest Bob Brookmeyer, and saxophonist J.D. Allen’s trio. Wein also performs Saturday with his Newport All-Stars.

Now here’s something cool for Sunday. Herbie Hancock closes out the afternoon with his band. Earlier in the afternoon on the Harbor Stage, Conrad Herwig’s band presents the “Latin Side of Herbie.” The day also includes a return appearance by Ken Vandermark, whose trio tore up the Harbor Stage two years ago, as well as Jason Moran, Matt Wilson and Ben Allison and their always-interesting bands. As I noted earlier, check out the lineup for much more to appeal to a wide variety of tastes.

Looking west
Also this week, producer Danny Melnick released the lineup for the 33rd annual Freihofer’s Saratoga Jazz Festival, which is scheduled June 26 and 27 at the scenic Saratoga NY Performing Arts Center. Headliners include Gladys Knight, singer Al Jarreau & The George Duke Trio, Taj Mahal, Al Di Meola, Ramsey Lewis, Ahmad Jamal, and Juan De Marcos & the Afro Cuban All Stars. Full details and the lineup are at their their web site.

Wein created the festival at SPAC in 1978, eight years after rowdies sent the Newport Jazz Festival packing – and he found a 10-year exclusive home in Manhattan. It was a move that kick-started Wein’s career as a global jazz impresario. (Wein returned to Newport in 1981.)

Saratoga’s atmosphere has made it an annual must-do for loyalists who arrive year after year with their coolers, blankets, tents, umbrellas, friends and families. Melnick has been its artistic director and producer since 1999 – for most of that time as a member of Wein’s team.

Like Newport this year, Freihofer’s Jazz Festival has a nice mix of established and rising talent. The latter includes the bands of J.D. Allen, singer Alyssa Graham, trumpeter Mario Abney and bassist Linda Oh. While Grace Kelly shows off her talent at Newport as one of the Berklee College of Music’s prominent undergrads, at Saratoga, the showcase falls to 20-year-old saxophonist Hailey Niswanger (pronounced “NICE-wonger”), another Berklee student getting significant attention.

Two dandy weekends. I can’t wait. ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912203438.69/warc/CC-MAIN-20190324103739-20190324125739-00528.warc.gz

That’s the only word that seems to fit this year’s primetime Sunday night glitz that was the 53rd annual Grammy Awards.
If you saw it, you know what I mean. If you missed it, you didn’t miss much, trust me.

Sure, there were scattered poignant moments – beginning with the opening tribute to the ailing Aretha Franklin.

But they were outweighed by the sheer spectacle of the night and artists who felt they had to make spectacles of themselves, starting with Lady Gaga’s eggular entrance. What? And then her blatant performance ripoff of Madonna’s “Express Yourself” in the guise of “Born This Way.” And how about the bicycles zooming around the stage near night’s end? And the heavy use of the bleep button by the network censors all night long.

But let’s look at the important stuff, to me anyway, the jazz side of the night – two pros and a con.

– Drummer Roy Haynes – the oldest teenager in jazz – was honored with a richly deserved Lifetime Achievement Award.

– Esparanza Spalding’s first win by a jazz performer of the Grammy for Best New Artist was most welcome – and came out of left field. Particularly since the singer and bassist didn’t even have an album in the running this time. (Her third CD is just out on Head’s Up International). And today, that upset had the legions of fans of the $100 million teenypopper Justin Bieber atwitter with their outrage. I say, quality music prevailed. And to quote Ozzy Osborne at the end of the new Best Buy commercial “What’s a Bieber?”

Here’s the affront to jazz that took place moments later.

– Do you get outraged when your given a serious listen in a jazz club to a great band – and two or three people at the next table won’t shut up, oblivious to the music?

That happened last night when Spalding was performing with the Grammy student jazz ensemble. Two folks on stage – one of them a high-ranking exec from The Recording Academy – blathered on about their programs. Wouldn’t it have been nice if they’d shut up and given the millions who’d never heard of the 26-year-old Ms. Spalding a chance to hear the music she’s made of?

But, hey, we are talking Grammys. Why should I be optimistic something like that will ever happen.

And isn’t it curious that they can only find time to bestow 10 of the 109 awards during the 31/2-hour prime time event.

Despite those failings, jazz did show itself well in the pre-telecast portion.

37,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/ggjazz/bobby-lyle-in-the-moment/,"Bobby Lyle Throughout my career I have conducted numerous interviews with some of the most influential jazz legends and artists of our time. The musical artistry of Emmy-nominated, pianist, keyboardist and composer, Bobby Lyle has fascinated me to the point that I made it a priority to reach out to him and speak with him about who he is as an artist and his life experience in the industry for over forty years.

His latest release, The Way I Feel, is a heartfelt tribute to his late, great friend and mentor, Hammond B-3 organ player,  Jimmy Smith and the late, great guitarist, Wes Montgomery.  On this recording, Bobby Lyle takes on the Hammond B-3 with fire and brimstone, grooving throughout each session with precise purpose and a uniqueness all his own.   The personnel choice is a one-of-a-kind selection, which iced the cake with Brennan Nase on guitar; Patrick Williams, Mark Simmons, and Mark Prince on drums, Keith Vivens on bass, and Milton Comeaux on percussion.

I had to admit to him that I have been a fan of his since the late 1970’s and that I was elated to have the opportunity to learn and speak with this vastly, multi-talented, veteran artist…Bobby Lyle.

Gigi Brooks: I would like to talk about your life and career. It has been over forty years that we have had your music in our lives. I read that you took music lessons from your mother, who was the church organist. Take me back to that time.

Bobby Lyle:  Yes, this is true. I had an older brother who was already taking lessons and it really looked like something fun to do, so I begged my mom to give me lessons. She started me out and became my first teacher and then passed me onto a private teacher. I wanted to follow through with it and it seemed that the more that I learned, the more I was intrigued to want to learn; especially when it came to jazz music, it seemed that I was gifted with an ear for that early on and probably because my mom was a collector and she had the big band stuff like Count Basie, Billy Eckstine and Duke Ellington. So I was listening to a lot of stuff at a very early age I didn’t know what genre it was, it just sounded good.

Gigi: I learned that Oscar Peterson, Bill Evans, Errol Garner, Art Tatum and Ahmad Jamal had a profound influence on your early years and also for your ear and I wondered if their skillful use of loudness changes and playing chords slightly after the beat have any effect on the way you approach the piano today? 

Bobby:  Yes. I mean that’s really one of the big differences between jazz music that swings and European classical music that’s pretty regimented to the exactness of the beat.  Jazz musicians learned early on that taking the liberty to come just a little bit behind the beat lent to the overall feel of what you were trying to establish groove-wise, and then when you add the harmonics on top of that, which is what the players would improvise and solo on, their solos would also be influenced by that interpretation of the beat. The combination of these things is what really gives jazz its total uniqueness .

Gigi:  Then you’ll be able to expand on it yourself with what you done on the different types of keys, because they weren’t using Fender Rhodes and Hammond B-3. 

Bobby:  Yes, that’s true I mean, the instrumentation and the technology will probably continue to evolve, but the basic principle has pretty much and will stay like they are, but still be flexible enough. The rhythm section can change with the times, because I always say that jazz purists and people who write about jazz have a concept that jazz is just locked into the swing,  big band or the Dixieland era or whatever… I don’t know.  I’ve always felt that they’re trying to make jazz a museum piece and jazz is anything but that. The fact that it’s flexible and that it transcends eras and the different ways that the bass players and trumpeters are interpreting jazz music… to me that keeps it alive and organic and expanding.

Gigi: Not only that, jazz is a living thing. 

 Bobby: It’s a living thing and it’s created in the moment, and whether that moment happens to be in 1945 or 2015, each moment is going to speak to what’s going on at that point in time and younger players coming in to participate… and that’s the other thing; when Miles Davis embraced the fact that it was okay to not always be locked into swing, but to bring in some funkier beats and Go-Go and all of that …when he embraced it then, it sort of opened up the floodgates for everybody to know that it’s okay to do that and to incorporate things that are going to bring in younger listeners you know, its just that way. The music is assured. It will have longevity.

Gigi: That is so true. When you’re composing and writing your music, how do you decide whether to use the piano, Fender Rhodes or Hammond B-3 organ? 

Bobby: Well, I still consider myself a pianist, but since it has been so many years… back in my younger days growing up learning how to play the B-3, I think it was almost a mistake that I went so many years of recording without including that sound in my recordings. Perhaps, it was the influence of the record companies, who had fully embraced the idea of the smooth jazz sound and that being pretty much piano, guitar and saxophone driven and I’m sure that contributed to it, but now I’m more concerned with the legacy of honoring the heroes of the past and if it takes this B-3 organ CD, which is the first one in my career, to let folks know how I feel about Jimmy and his influence, then so be it. My next CD will probably be back on the piano, but this is a project that just had to be done.

Gigi:  He was also your friend and mentor as well.  What did you learn from him during those years? 

Bobby: Well, yes.  Jimmy and I did have a relationship that kind of expanded over the years. I learned the dedication that he had to just being excellent in his presentation and just bringing a certain kind of energy to it every time he performed and making a connection with your audience, because we don’t just do this so that we can provide some candy for your ears, we also want to touch you at a heart level and a soul level.  I really got some clarity on that by being with Jimmy and watching him perform and a lot of that has to do with… I’m sure with the organ coming from the church where people are dealing with spirituality and soul from this light in that environment.  Jimmy brought that over into the jazz venue which kind of tied it all together, so at some point during my performances you’re probably going to hear me make a lot of references to church and incorporate that into the whole performance side by side with the be-bop, swing and the modern funk. It all ties together in my mind… it all comes from the same spirit.
‘
Gigi: I want to ask you about the moment that was supposed to happen, which didn’t happen with Jimi Hendrix, which is a real tragedy. What would that have been like? What do you think would have been between you and Jimi Hendrix had he lived? 

Bobby:  You know… it is hard to say in a definitive sort of way, but just looking at it in a general way, I know that we had elements that we were going to bring to him and he already had elements in place that made him a legendary rock player… so it would have been right during that time that so-called fusion music was big and blossoming and Jimi himself had started listening to Miles and different jazz musicians.  So it would have been some kind of combination of the two elements of jazz and rock and it would have definitely been in a way where we could have gotten a lot of interplay and groove and just really have been influential to each other and not to mention the fact that you know, we weren’t really into drugs. Hopefully, that would have had a positive influence on Jimi, because obviously that’s ultimately what took his life. There’s no way to rewrite history, but it’s always good food for thought when I see a picture of him or listen to a song of his… you know?  Jimi and artists like Miles Davis made bold statements. He went his own direction, regardless of what everybody else thought or what was going on around him.

Gigi:  Miles actually was going to do some work with him as well, and then he said he suddenly passed away.  I’m sitting here just wondering what would have been… 

Bobby : Yes,  it is something that I’ll always play with mentally. You can’t rewrite history, but it would have definitely been a golden era for all of us involved.

Gigi: Yes, it would have been. You’ve played with Sly and the Family Stone, Ronnie Laws, Wayne Henderson and the Jazz Crusaders, George Benson and so many other great musicians and legends, which took you to another level in music where you became a music director, directing for stars like Bette Midler. How did that come about? 

Bobby: Well, the Bette Midler gig actually came about, because of her guitarist, a guy named Buzzy Feiten at the time. She was going to start performing on stage again and she didn’t have a musical director, because her original one was Barry Manilow, he had moved into a successful solo career and so the chair was open and Buzzy Feiten, whom I had known for a few years from studio sessions  just kind of threw my name in the hat as someone who should be considered and bless his heart… I got a call from her to come and audition.  It was a very unusual audition, because most of the time we just sat and talked about music and our respective backgrounds and right before was time to leave she was like ‘Oh! I guess I should hear you play something!’

Bobby : [laughs]

Gigi:  [laughs]  

Bobby: So, I think it was because I came highly recommended, so I’m sure she knew that I could play, but you know a part of any audition has to include some kind of playing.

Gigi:  She already knew she had the Gold right there! 

Bobby: Yeah, she probably went through everybody that was on her list, I guess just to make sure. She interviewed everybody. Needless to say, I was on pins and needles waiting for that call , but it took more than a week before they finally called, but it all worked out and we had some very successful tours together.

Gigi: That’s wonderful! I want to make a mention of the Emmy nomination that you received for your musical direction on her HBO special, “Diva Las Vegas,” that is pretty impressive. 

Bobby: Yes, I was very happy and proud about that whole thing. It culminated our whole relationship and is quite gratifying to have received.

Gigi: That is tremendous! You have also done music direction for Al Jarreau, Anita Baker and many other people correct? 

Bobby: That is true. When I look back on that whole period most of this happened after I was signed with Capitol Records and after my third album with Capitol, they sort of disbanded their whole jazz division.  I guess they figured it wasn’t profitable enough and so we were all kind of cast adrift. I figured the best way to keep going was to hire out as a musical director; there was a lot of “being at the right place at the right time” that happened throughout that period in the 80’s, which led all the way up to my signing with Atlantic Jazz and beyond. I still maintained a relationship with Bette Midler, even after I got the deal at Atlantic, but that whole musical director period covered Bette,  Al,  Anita Baker and little bit of Phyllis Hyman.  It gave me an education in another direction, which is being a vocal accompanist and that’s an art form that is different. Being the lead player in a group requires another kind of listening and empathy towards what’s going on, so you can become more of a facilitator for the person who is up front. I learned a lot during that period that I can pass on to some of my piano students and make them aware of the difference between the two idioms. When someone’s singing you don’t just solo and play all over them, you learn to operate in spaces that they need when they take a breath and you learn to color around them as they present the song.

Gigi:  Are you still doing any music direction for anyone today ? 

Bobby: I am not. These recent years have been pretty much dedicated to just trying to establish and maintain myself as a solo artist and you know, get some bookings with the festivals and clubs. This current CD, The Way I Feel, is actually a milestone in another direction. It’s the first time that I have created my own record label and put some gradus down on it…I sort of  look at it as my freedom, autonomy…my independence,  whatever you want to call it. I may not sell as many copies, but I definitely will get a much larger proportion of each sale than what I would get if I were signed with a label.

Gigi: Absolutely ! That is very true! Well, right before we touch on that I want to say that I have just about every recording you have made. I have a stack of your music, but I want to tell you one of my favorites is New Warrior from 1978 and that’s when you really you incorporated your funk, fusion- jazz, it was just beautiful and my favorite song  was “Good Inside” and this time you were singing! Your voice is remarkable! 

Bobby: Well, I felt very adventurous back in that day and I presented as many different flavors of jazz as I could and some vocal stuff you know.  I was just bold enough to try anything and I think the only reason that I stopped with the vocals on the records was because I had really started to listening to people like Luther Vandross and Jeffrey Osborne and I was like why am I trying to do this? [laughs]

Gigi: [Laughs]  The singing was great! You were using strings on this particular recording and I really love strings! 

Bobby:  Well, there’s another explanation for that as well. That was at a time when jazz artists were really able to get decent budgets and it was when the budgets started being widdled away that you hear people not doing as many string sections or using synthesizers for strings… you’re right! It’s a shame!  There’s nothing more beautiful than that element on top of the other music and when we could no longer afford to do it I really hated that, but it was just a sign of the times I guess…

Gigi:  That album like I said is one of my favorites! I can listen to that album all day long. I can play that one song over and over again, because it has so many changes and is so funky, but yet silky and its moving… it’s wonderful! 

Bobby: Well, I don’t know.  I had actually almost forgotten about that project and somebody posted up on my Facebook page the tune on there I think of “Believe” which is another vocal tune which was done in 5/4 meter and I was like ‘Oh my goodness!’ Man, I forgot all about this stuff! [laughs]
I’m such an “in-the-moment,”  “always looking ahead” kind of person that I guess I don’t have time to keep reviewing that which is already done and passed, but it’s nice every once in a while to revisit those things and be able to listen to them without thinking as a producer… it takes a long time to be able to hear your own stuff and not be critiquing it and all of that and just listen to the music and enjoy it.

Gigi: Yeah, well I can’t really listen to myself on the air still to this day. 

Bobby:  Yes, you know a lot of people are like that and I guess that’s surprising to some folks who are fans of yours and they just don’t understand, but after some years have gone by then I can sit back and enjoy some of my work and I’m really appreciative of that even though again I’m still focused on what I’m doing now and what I’m getting ready to do.

Gigi: When you were discussing your new release, The Way I Feel, you mentioned that this is your first recording with you playing the Hammond B-3 organ in  honor of Jimmy Smith and also Wes Montgomery . You’ve got some great musicians on this project.  Brennan Nase on guitar… 

Bobby: Yes, he’s a very, very fine guitarist. Probably the best guitarist no one’s ever heard of, because he lives in Houston and has never really ventured outside of this local bubble here, but I’m going to make him one of my future products on my label just to try to help him get out there because he is so talented.

Gigi: We’re going to have to do an interview on him and get him really out there. 

Bobby:  Definitely.

Gigi:  Patrick Williams, Mark Simmons and Mark Prince on drums; Keith Vivens on bass and Milton Comeaux on percussion. The album is a remarkable work! Tell me about the project. 

Bobby:  It was one of my longest running projects. I think the initial seeds were planted in 2010. We were working here in Houston over at Texas Southern University. They have the radio station which has a recording studio. We were invited to do the project there to help us get it done and to also give their studio a little notoriety for having done a national project there, but the flip side of that coin was we were subject to wait for the engineer and the studio to be available, so sometimes they were booked up for weeks and we just had to wait before we could get back in there. Also, because I was financing the project myself, sometimes I’d have to wait to accumulate enough funds to continue going forward, so the combination of these things made the project take much longer than it probably would have ordinarily.

Gigi: Well, that’s understandable. 

Bobby:  Believe me we toasted a glass of wine when it was finally done and mastered. [laughs]  I was like a ‘whew at last!’ It seems like it was just going to go on forever, but we got it done and for that I am grateful.

38,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/ggjazz/chris-massey-creating-forward-momentum/,"Chris Massey I was clicking through some emails, when I came across a jazz promotion of drummer and composer Chris Massey. His new digital only release, Whosoever; on Power Cosmic Records with his band The New Jazz Project, featuring Adam Larson on tenor/soprano sax, Benny Benack III, trumpet, Willerm Delisfort, piano and Chris Talio on bass, took me for a ride of musical changes, exquisite compositions and thorough arrangements. I contacted him immediately for an interview.

Chris Massey’s music has taken me through these moments of excitement in the past on his Jazz Times and DownBeat  reviewed 2010 release, Vibrainium, which I wore a hole through the CD on my radio show. It is no wonder he has this affect since he was mentored by jazz legend, Shedrick Hobbs, who played with legends such as Charlie ‘Bird’ Parker and Dizzy Gillespie. Massey’s other drummer inspirations derive from the technique and approach of notable drummers and composers, Jeff “Tain” Watts and Brian Blade; which can be heard in his performances.

In this interview we discussed his life with the drums, new release and his giving back through drum lessons to students of all ages. Whosoever is a must hear!

Gigi Brooks: I always think it is important to go back into an artist’s life. Lets go back to the beginning and your fascination with the drums.

Chris Massey:  I am originally from Ohio and it started sort of like many kids in the Mid-West, kids going to band. Ironically, when we were picking instruments when I was in the fifth grade, I remember picking up a saxophone and liking it, the person who was talking about instruments mentioned something about saxophones needing a lot of extra work, because of the reeds. So the next thing sitting right next to it was the drums, so at random I said let me try the drums and when I picked up the drum sticks for the first time, I realized that was exactly what I wanted to play.

I took drum lessons, but what really sparked the interest of jazz for me was playing with my mentor when I was in college, Shedrick Hobbs; he played with a lot of famous musicians like Charlie “Byrd” Parker and Dizzy Gillespie who were coming through town, because it was a steel belt town. Shedrick was the drummer on-call and was the house drummer for a lot of the venues. As time went on and he got older, I really shadowed him and he taught me the organic nature of music and that for me was probably my biggest influence in not only my perception of the music, but my talent as well.

How were you fortunate to meet him? 

Well he was one of the local legends. He never really left the hometown where he was from, so I went to see him and I sat in with him. I would go two or three times a week even, just hanging out with him, learning everything I could from him. Sometimes he would do things like…when I played along with his band he would take cups from the bar and click them in my ear as loudly and as off-beat as possible, just to keep my concentration and focus going…lessons you don’t necessarily learn in the classroom; he taught those life lessons about playing the drums.

I have never heard of that before. When there is noise you do have to stay in the pocket and on beat…like you said that is a street lesson. 

Yes. Absolutely! He was hugely influential on my style in that aspect, sort of playing organically and internalizing all the music that is around you at the time.

He was a great teacher. I read where you stated that “jazz is a state of consciousness”. What do you mean by that? 

What I mean by that is that jazz is something that translates throughout and outside of the music itself. It translates to everything you do in life. Having the mindset, I think jazz is one of the most organic forms of music…one of the purest forms of sound productions that can be done, because the musicians are creating art instantly at a flash in the pan moment and once that moment is over it never happens again. It’s just like conversation, this conversation while others will hear it and it can be recorded, it happens organically. To be able to do that throughout all aspects of life, that’s really the state of consciousness I mean about that and I think a true person who is dedicated to the art in that way-to jazz, understands and appreciates the fact that jazz sort of translates to everything you do in life as well.

That’s very true. It is not just a genre. I want to talk about your light style of brushing and lightly tapping on the cymbals, which is very effective and I hear you using them to create your music. What are sound and effect are you bringing to the music? 

I really try to treat the cymbals as a separate drum kit, so a huge part of the cymbal has different timbres and different sounds and it’s like an artist with a color palette on using an easel while painting different colors on the music; hitting the cymbal in different areas constantly making different timbre effects creates an almost constant color blend that I hear in my head. So I do focus primarily on my cymbals, because to me that’s the most prominent sound and the most defining of a drummer. When  you hear Elvin Jones hit on that Ride cymbal, you know exactly who that is playing on the Rides…Art Blakey…it doesn’t matter who it is… the cymbals are always the most defining part of a drummer’s style.  I really take in a lot of thought as to not only why that is, but how that is. I really think it has to do with the color palette that the cymbals can offer to the music.

What does that do to help the other musicians in the band? 

My job as a bandleader and drummer is to create forward momentum; even if the tempo is on the slower side or whatever it is to create that forward momentum and create the kindling for the fire as it were. That way the horn player has a foundation to play off of, play on top of or play around. That way I am giving them constant colors to work with as they also take those colors and paint the music as well.

You last album Vibrainium was so strong and aggressive and was a thrill for me, because I enjoy that kind of aggressiveness in music; especially in jazz and drumming. What do you think you did differently this time with Whosoever?

I had more of a concept with Whosoever than I did with Vibrainium. Vibrainium was a debut album to say here I am, this is what I am about, this is what my concept is about and Whosoever had more of a game plan I would say in terms of how I set it up. Without going into too much detail about each particular title, I will say right now that I planned it around an overarching theme and I turned each tune to that theme and even with the originals and the actual arrangements and compositions of the standards. I went into the album with that mindset before I even began writing the music and I think that’s what separates this album from the first.

Your band, The Nu Jazz Project is brilliant. Tell me about those guys. 

Well..actually this a two-part overage of my group, they are my working band. I always feel really strongly about  having people on my recordings who I play with extensively, because I think that gets the most organic sound. A lot of the guys are up and coming themselves…my saxophone player, Adam Larson, recently graduated from the Manhattan School of Music, Benny Benack, my trumpet player also graduated from there as well as my bass player, Chris Talio. Willerm Delisfort has been a very staunch player in the New York area and we played together a lot, so a lot of my band has a combination of unique personalities that compliment eachother. I’ll probably explain this in a little bit, but I am very big into comic books, Sci-Fi and things like that and one of my overarching themes is that I often times view jazz ensembles like super hero groups, like the X-Men and The Avengers. I feel that the best groups just like the X-Men and The Avengers, have unique individuals to make up that part of a whole. We all have different personalities and we all have different ways of doing things, but we work really well together and that’s what I look for in a band.

You know what to expect from each other when you’re playing together. 

Absolutely. In fact it is to the point where the studio we were recording in had us isolated and looking away from each other, we didn’t have any eye contact while we were playing, but we’re so used to each other’s style that we didn’t need to see each other.

Where did the title of the album Whosoever come from?

It comes from a metaphysical reference. The whole album and all of the original titles of the album are from the comics, I am really big into comics. My first album Vibrainium is from the Marvel Universe. My dad got me into comics when I was really young and I’ve always had a passion for them; it is my guilty pleasure. My favorite super hero growing up that my dad introduced me to was Thor. It got a lot of popularity over the years with its own movie and The Avengers movie and it’s become a little more mainstream, so I can let it out of the closet a little bit more. The word “Whosoever” is actually the first words on Thor’s Hammer. It is Viking Mythology and on the cover of my album you might notice I am holding something and it’s actually Norse version of Thor’s Hammer.

Tell me about the track “Onyx Guardian.” 

I actually wrote that tune after the actor who plays the “Guardian of the Rainbow Bridge” in the movie; I wrote that as sort of a theme song for him.

There is a mixture of classic standards and original compositions such as “Old Devil Moon” and John Coltrane’s “Giant Steps” and then “Warriors Three,” which is very elegant and beautiful. Also “Return of the Jitney” a Jeff “Tain” Watts composition. You have worked with him before and he is one of your mentors.

Yes, he has been a very big influence on me and I’ve had the pleasure of meeting him and seeing him play a number of times. I’ve was happy to get a copy of the score from him and it really has been great to do that tune. When I first heard it, it was something that changed my perception of how drummers can actually compose and it really influenced me- it was kind of was almost my motivational point into doing this album. Hearing that kind of compositional style and a tune that intricate and that well done which still really had that drive of power that I look for in my ensemble was a really big push for me to get writing again.

It is beautifully done. And then you have Pedal Up by Rashaan Roland Kirk…I love it! 

Yeah! That’s a song you don’t hear people do very often. It’s one of my favorite tunes. I really like how it came out so I just said lets do this tune.

I want to mention the fact that you are teaching and sharing your knowledge and talent with young people. I am so pleased to know it. 

Absolutely! I think that music is taught through that mentorship aspect of it, many crafts and many arts were taught that way. The teacher would teach the students and then you go on from that mentorship relationship to really learn the craft. I think this music is something that can be passed down generationally and transverse all of the other music we think about in the current generation, whatever music they listen to for pleasure, its interesting to see how they can connect with artists who have been dead for forty or fifty years. It’s like my parents used to listen to old Motown records when I was a kid and I would dance around the house to it, because good music is good music. Keeping the music alive for future generations to appreciate through music and education is really important to me.

 The 2011 Clearwater Jazz Holiday located in Clearwater, Florida was four days of sheer musical talent. Its headliners, Christian McBride & Inside Straight along with Dianne Reeves, brought people from all over the country to watch in awe these great performances.

As usual Christian McBride held listeners captive while he tore into his bass with an approach and a fingering precision that makes him the world renowned innovative, Grammy Award-winning bassist that he is. There is no bassist quite like Christian Mc Bride in jazz today. His straight ahead quintet, Inside Straight, featuring alto/soprano saxophonist Steve Wilson, vibraphonist, Warren Wolf, jazz pianist, Peter Martin and drummer, Carl Allen performed tunes from their latest release The Good Feeling  and tunes from the previous CD Kind of Brown, which takes one down the road of pure yet good ole’ down-home jazz.

One thing I know for sure is that the performance of a true legendary Jazz Diva, (I mean Diva in the sense of presence, style and elegance) cannot be put into words when you are sitting smack center in front of the stage listening to indescribable vocal talent that saturates your soul with pure joy.

I sat with my mouth wide open the entire time during the performance of Dianne Reeves.  As a jazz radio personality and a lifetime collector of jazz music; I can say that I am the proud owner of all of Ms. Reeve’s recordings. However, nothing prepared me for what I heard live and in the flesh on that balmy Sunday evening as I watched her perform for the very first time.

Dianne Reeves commands the attention of her audience with her beauty and strength of presence on the stage. She approaches the music with a soulful, deep clarity and an understanding of her gift and what a voice is really meant to do. At times, she was a trumpet and saxophone. Other times she held her voice softly to every note, lightly stroking the listener into a dream-like trance.

Throughout her performance she wowed the audience with her brilliance, humor and wit. At times she was almost operatic and at others grippingly earthy and robust. The introduction of her band was done as an impromptu song in which she sang about each musician and their meaning to her in her life, which I found to be highly unusual and extremely creative.

Hours before the show I had the pleasure of interviewing Ms. Reeves. I was sitting in her trailer waiting for her to return from sound check. I had never met her before, nor had I interviewed her on the radio.

I looked up as the trailer door opened as she walked in wearing a sparkling white warm-up suit, her face not yet in make-up, but gleaming with perspiration from the Florida heat and rehearsal; which gave her a glow. She sat down across from me on the sofa and began to share with me her lifelong love affair with the stage and jazz.  Gigi Brooks:  When I heard that you were performing on this festival, I knew I had to get here to see your performance. Thank you for taking the time to speak with me. Your musical family background is quite interesting in that your mother played the trumpet, which is very rare.

Dianne Reeves:   It’s interesting…she did, she played in high school. It’s funny because I said that in an interview and it will not go away. I told my mother… I said so you used to be a trumpet player… but she played in a school band and never pursued it.

However, you do have a family lineage of musicians, your cousin, keyboardist, George Duke who we all know. How important is it to know your gift? 

I think in anything that you do when you love something and it’s something that you want to dedicate yourself to…it is very important to refine and define it, because it is something that you love, something that you enjoy doing. And it will take you and you can grow and it can feed other parts of your life…. and so I think it’s very important whether you’re gifted as an orator or doctor, you know, everybody has a gift and I think that the best thing you can do for yourself is to find out what that gift is and let that guide your life.

Otherwise you’re wasting your time? 

I don’t think you’re wasting your time there are a lot of people that never really, really get to that, but it sure makes life a little easier when you’re doing something that you love.

Yes, it does. Now I would like to talk about your influences like Ella, Billie and Sarah. What have you taken from them to create your own voice? You have your own voice and your own style. 

Those are the ones that we always go to and absolutely they were played in my home and the one thing that I love was all of the great vocalists I listened to growing up and I would add fabulous people like Marvin Gaye, Aretha Franklin and Tami Terrell who I loved when I was a kid growing up. All of these people had one thing in common and that was that their uniqueness was in tact and from note #1 you would always know who it was; and that’s the gift that they taught me…that they gave me and that is to define your own style and your own way of addressing the music and that’s what I’ve done.

How did you go about doing that?  Or how would you advise a singer to do that? 

Early on you sing songs of people that you love… you step in their shoes you know? I have an uncle who’s a great bassist, jazz and classical; and I remember when I came across this Sarah Vaughan tune that she did “What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?”  that she recorded with Michel Legrand with strings and it was arranged for big band when I was in high school; and I used to sing it verbatim and then he came to me and said “You know it’s really wonderful how you’re doing that, but just know that, that was the was the ‘take’ that they took, maybe that she did it three times”. And then he said “….and you better believe that if she did it three times….she did it three times in a different way; so you find your own way to do it. You find your own way over the chords.” He would say “It’s nice that you can stand in those shoes, but you have something to say.” And that’s what I would say to any young person it’s like you have a way of singing, a way that you present yourself in everyday life, take that thing and put it in the music.

Your style has been described as slow and languid. What makes it so successful, the way that you perform a song and the way that you approach it? 

I think slow and languid could be part of it, but it’s fiery, it’s strong. I have found that I’m a storyteller that’s part of my music. I love to find lyrics that really address my life, my mind, my spirit in some kind of way, because those are the things I can best express. So I have to find something that is attractive to me, whether it’s something that’s already out there or something that I’m writing for myself and I think that’s the thing that makes everything stronger.

That’s so true. Let’s talk a little bit about Sing The Truth. I’m excited about that by the way. I read about that and I am so happy! 

Sing The Truth is a pretty amazing experience. It started out a couple of years ago with me, Angelique Kidjo, Lizz Wright and Nina Simone’s daughter, Simone. We did a tribute to her mother and we toured all over Europe and it was really powerful. And then she (Simone Simone) was going off to do things, I guess to be a part of the film of her mother that was coming up, but me and Angelique and Lizz liked it so much we thought “wow lets do this again!”; and we got Terri Lyne Carrington, our musical director and a bunch of great musicians; Geri Allen on piano, my guitarist, Romero Lubambo, James Genus, who is on Saturday Night Live and Munyungo Jackson. Amazing band! We went out and we toured this summer in Europe and have had a hard  time having people wanting to have it here, but slowly people are catching on and starting to book us here in the United States; it’s a very powerful show.

Well, also it doesn’t just consist of jazz you’re doing a little bit of everything. 

Well, particularly the concept of this one is that we would do some of the songs that we’ve written, but also great songs of great composers; so the show can change from night to night,
it will be something different every night and that’s what makes it powerful.

What do you think it is that’s keeping them from bringing it over here? 

Well…I don’t know. Sometimes people are not sure and it has to just catch on and I’m sure it will catch on.

I’m sure it will. I hope it does very soon I’m so excited about that.  You performed in April at the 120th Anniversary Gala of Carnegie Hall with all of the great artists and even actors and President Bill Clinton was there. Tell me, because you did get great reviews, especially on Billie Holiday’s “Don’t Explain” the New York Times said, “You killed it”. What does that mean to you? 

One hundred and twenty years of a place that is an institution, a musical institution in America; it’s like a cathedral of all kinds of music and great, great, great artists have walked across that stage. I always said that their sounds which reverberated against the walls are all a part of it
and to be a part of that… knowing that Billie graced that stage, knowing that Ella graced that stage, knowing that Aretha, all of these great people have walked across that stage and all of my life I’ve always heard “How do you get to Carnegie Hall ?” Practice, you know? And I have had the opportunity to perform at the hall many, many times and this was a wonderful celebration and I’m looking forward to 2013 when I go and perform again there.

That’s exciting! What do you think if Billie were here, what would she say? 

You know…I don’t know. She’s a realist, you know. I would be very interested like everybody else to hear what she would have to say. I have no idea.

Do you think she would be proud of you? 

Well, I hope so… you know…I don’t know.

I think so. Performing in concert which is what you are doing and you’re touring all over, your schedule is quite full by the way. What is it that you get from performing at a jazz festival? 

Any stage. Stage is a sacred place for me and it’s the place that I love. I always say, they pay us to travel and the performance is free, because this is what I love. So coming to festivals…I was here at Clearwater many years ago and I did quite a bit. I see how it has grown and the stage and everything from when I first did it. I’m glad to be back here. I love festivals, because they’re a celebration of music.

I think so too. Don’t you think that you get a vibe and an energy that you can’t replace anywhere else from a jazz festival? 

I think everything is different. I mean I like it, I love this festival. I love to be on stage.

Yes! And what today will you do? 

Oh, I never say, because I never really know until I get up there.

You’re just going to surprise us and make us happy like you always do. 

Hopefully…yes. [laughs]

 Over the last six years the Hudson Valley Jazz Festival has attracted people from New York City to the far countryside in the beautiful Catskills region of New York’s Hudson Valley. The festival is a rare find, with performances by both local artists and jazz legends taking place in various venues in the area from bistros to inns to the Sugar Loaf Performing Arts Center.

This year’s the lineup was thick with phenomenal talent, including keyboardist Jason Miles and trumpeter Ingrid Jensen supporting their album Kind of New; Andy Ezrin, Adam Nussbaum and David Finck; and closing with the grand finale, the Wallace Roney Group, featuring two jazz legends, bassist Buster Williams and drummer Lenny White.

It was a special evening of celebration for HVJF founder, Steve Rubin, who I spoke with about the festival’s history and future.

Gigi Brooks: How did this all begin for you?

Steve Rubin: It started in 2010 as the Warwick Valley Jazz Festival. I’m a drummer and when I moved up here I began thumbing through a lot of musicians here. When you move from Manhattan to Warwick, you think that’s the end of your cultural life and in some cases it is, but this time it was not. [laughs] I met a lot of great musicians and it took an event to bring people out and so I thought of having a jazz festival for a couple of days. Then it turned into four days, so I did that for a couple of years. I then changed the name to the Hudson Valley Jazz Festival, because it was pretty obvious that, one, there are a lot of musicians in the Greater Hudson Valley and, secondly, we started to repeat the same people. So by opening up into other areas we were meeting new people who were supporting the music, and the word started getting out a little bit. We got lucky the first year when the Village Voice covered it, which thrilled me. I didn’t expect it … I grew up my whole life reading the Village Voice since I’m a Greenwich Village guy originally.

GB: That’s fantastic! It’s a great feeling when people celebrate what you’re doing for jazz.

SR: Yes it is. Each year the idea was to always have local musicians presented in a variety of settings, to have this collaborative series in different locations, with different styles of jazz in different environments, and to always have one or two main headliners, because that’s the way it is in the arts in general. However, I always wanted to focus on the local musicians to help raise their profile, because we always go to the films and concerts of the names we recognize, but that doesn’t mean that people who live in small towns aren’t just as good. We’re all guilty of that; we all pick up the paper like in the old days, and we go to see entertainment often based on name recognition.

GB: It’s not fair.

SR: It’s not. I thought, here’s an opportunity to present the people that I knew and put them in a jazz festival context, alongside of some big names like in this festival: Wallace Roney, Buster Williams, Lenny White and so on-obviously names that any jazz fan would know. So, each year the idea would be to include different players, different towns, different venues and continue to expand the exposure of both the local jazz musicians and any venue that’s going to hire jazz and, hopefully, maybe create a little incentive for other people to hire jazz. For example, this festival might make people feel, wow, I could be a part of this.

GB: Do you see this evolving into a large outdoor festival like the Newport Jazz Festival or something like that?

SR: I really like this theater, Sugar Loaf Performing Arts Center. An outdoor festival is a difficult thing to plan with weather consideration. We don’t have that kind of infrastructure or funding. What we’re really looking at this point is for someone to come along and say, “We’d really like to help this Hudson Valley Jazz Festival.” Then that would enable us to be better funded. We want to launch an education program weeks before the festival; we’ve toyed with that idea.

GB: Where you can have artists conduct masterclasses?

SR: Exactly. We have a couple of potential locations. We also have an opportunity to have a student performance as part of the festival.

GB: Including young students is always a good idea.

SR: Yes, it is. We just need that support to help us move forward. That’s really been the idea: grow the festival, maintain its identity as something that highlights local musicians in different environments I still like. Some people really don’t want to sit in a theater and some people will only sit in a theater. We did have a couple of outdoor shows; we had a great outdoor show last night in Warwick and people brought their chairs and sat out in the rural setting with a city vibe going on. It is a gorgeous landscape and a terrific environment. This way if we have a show in a library, cafe, restaurant, a theater, an art gallery, everybody feel like, “Hey, I like that vibe.” ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912205597.84/warc/CC-MAIN-20190326160044-20190326182044-00144.warc.gz

 On Saturday, June 29 and Sunday, June 30, 2013, the Freihofer’s Saratoga Jazz Festival will celebrate its 36th anniversary at the Saratoga Performing Arts Center in Saratoga Springs, NY.; thanks to jazz impresario, producing partner and Artistic Director Danny Melnick.

Melnick’s company, Absolutely Live Entertainment, LLC., has produced some of the greatest tours, concerts and special events throughout the world. Its extensive list of highly successful tours and events include the four month-long Blue Note Records 70th Anniversary tour; commemorating the 50th Anniversary of Miles Davis’ Kind of Blue recording; Wayne Shorter’s 75th birthday concerts in NYC and Boston; “The Rumi Symphony Project,” the first Persian headlining concert at Carnegie Hall; and many others.

Melnick also serves as Artistic Director of Carnegie Hall’s “The Shape of Jazz”, series; now in its 10th season. In August 2011, he was chosen by Newport Jazz founder and producer George Wein to serve as Associate Producer for the Newport Jazz Festival. Danny Melnick has also played a major role in the production of such annual events as the JVC Jazz Festivals in Newport and New York; the Bermuda Music Festival; the Verizon Music Festivals; all in all he has helped to produce over 95 jazz festivals in the U.S., Japan and Europe.

Last week I had the distinct honor to speaking with somene whom I consider to be one of the most creative producers in jazz. In a time when jazz is now in need of more recognition and exposure to our youth and the world, Danny Melnick has done his due diligence to see that it remains in the forefront and has successfully exposed some of the now most accomplished musicians of our time.

In our conversation, we discussed the 36th anniversary of the upcoming Freihofer’s Saratoga Jazz Festival and touched on his illustrious career.

Gigi Brooks: I want to congratulate you on the upcoming 36th Annual Freihofer’s Saratoga Jazz Festival, I am so excited about it. Let’s talk about it and your involvement.

Dan Melnick: The festival is June 29 and 30 at the Saratoga Performing Arts Center in Saratoga Springs, NY. It is the 36th annual festival, we have two stages. The Main stage in the amphitheater goes from 12:00 p.m. until about 10:30 p.m., on Saturday and Sunday. The Gazebo stage, which is a smaller stage where we do a lot of showcase performances usually goes from about 12:00 p.m. to about 7:00 p.m.

Gigi: I’m looking at all of the wonderful headliners that will be there. I see Tony Bennett… 

DM:  Yes, Tony Bennett. There’s also going to be on Sunday, June 30, Buddy Guy and a lot of really great, fantastic artists. The thing about Saratoga that’s so cool is that we do a lot of different styles of music there. So we try really hard to do as much as we can a little bit of everything so that people who have all different tastes can come to the festival and have a good time and come and check out some artists that they really don’t know a lot about. You know? So it’s not one style of music we try to do all types of different things at Saratoga.

Gigi: Not just one style of music. We are talking about all of the different types of jazz correct? 

DM:  Yes. We do straight-ahead jazz, we do a little smooth, funk, soul, latin, avant garde, we have world music, blues…..we really try to give people opportunities to hear and experience all different styles of music.

Gigi: I just want to mention your background that you’ve produced many tours with your company Absolutely Live Entertainment and you’re responsible for the continuation of the Newport Jazz Festival and Miles Davis’ 50th Anniversary recording and tour of Kind of Blue. Just so many great events when it comes to jazz and I want to recognize you. One of the main focuses of my radio show and the work that I do in music is the continuation of jazz and I so admire your work and accomplishments in this same purpose and focus. I want to applaud you for all of the great things and the work you have done with the JVC jazz festivals, what you’re doing as Artistic Director at Carnegie Hall, “The Shape of Jazz.” I want to thank you. 

DM:  Thank you. I really appreciate that. You know my goal is to keep it going too. I think the music is awesome and I think the guys and the ladies who perform are incredible and talented people and I have worked really hard over the years to allow them more and more opportunities to be heard and to turn more and more people on to the music; so that society can be a better place. [laughs]

Gigi: [laughs] Yes! I agree! 

DM:  At the end of the day for me…I enjoy it a lot…I love being a part of the scene and I like when people have a really good time at the concerts or the festivals, it makes me really happy! We do stuff that gives people a chance to get away from their daily lives and enjoy. They don’t have to come to these events, you know? These are all optional for them and we really so appreciate the audience and we really love the musicians so we’re just trying to bring everybody together.

Gigi: I love the line-up! I know the turn-out will be spectacular because of the the line-up and also due to what you’re doing with the festival. I would like to name a few of the artists here: Arturo Sandoval, David Sanborn, Bob James, Gregory Porter, McCoy Tyner’s Quartet, The Cookers …so many great artists and even Carmen Souza! I wish I could be there! 

DM:  I appreciate that. I mean it’s really a beautiful line-up and we have fireworks on Saturday night after the festival is over and on Sunday we’re putting in a bronze star into the cement at the Plaza there in Dave Brubeck’s honor and his daughter Kathy and grandson Daniel will be there to be a part of the celebration. Dave played the Saratoga Jazz Festival more than any other artist during the history of the festival. So we are going to honor his memory with a star in the Plaza there.  And we have an amazing crafts section and we do a lot of CD signings with the artists. It’s a really cool event where people can come and bring a lot of stuff in. We don’t really hassle people. They can bring their own blankets, lawn chairs and umbrellas. We have reserve seating and lawn seating and they can park for free. It’s a really fun and pretty amazing space up there in Saratoga.

Gigi: Can they bring their own wine and everything as well? 

DM:  Well, we have a huge bar there so they’re not allowed glass containers, but we do have a really big bar area there and they can sit on the outdoor Plaza there and have drinks and we have different types of beer on tap and we have barbeque and other foods…so it’s a pretty great scene. The Amphitheater and the Performing Arts Center is a historic place, they’ve been open now for more than 40 years and they are my partners and are fantastic people.

Gigi: Along with the festival I know sometimes there are buses that will transport people from New York and the DC area. Will you have something like that available to people who want to get transportation to the festival? 

DM:  The festival itself does not get involved in any of that. We tried in the past to do it, but it was really difficult for us to coordinate, everybody had their own agendas in terms of when they could travel and where they were going and coming from. I know there are companies that do it, but there’s nothing official. People can take buses, Amtrak and there are cabs and other types of trollies available in Saratoga to get people to the festival site; but a lot of people get here on their own steam, because they are coming from all different places and the hotels are really spread out in Saratoga and towns surrounding Saratoga. We have a big local following as well. There are options, but we’re just not involved with them officially.

Gigi: Understandable. Since this is your production, with your company what do you want most importantly for people to take away from your events? What is it that you want people to remember and bring more people back? 

DM:  Well, we work very hard to put on very high quality events. We’re very cautious and conscious about sound and about the artist’s equipment and we really want the audience to feel very comfortable at the events we do. Obviously we are fortunate that we work in pretty prestigious places so we know that there’s quality control at places like Newport, Carnegie Hall, Saratoga and some of the other places that we work in. On our website homepage we have a line there that says..“Trust us..we know entertainment.” We feel really strong about that, we want the audience to trust us and we really want them to know that if they’re going to an event produced by Absolutely Live that it will be the very best it can be….we really care about everyone’s comfort and we’re trying very hard to put on the best presentations that we can. Obviously we can’t guarantee that they will love the music, but we are very careful who we present. We are very aware of the artists, we know who they are, we know what kind of music they play, what kind of bands they have and the sideman and stuff like that. We have worked really hard to get that across to the audience that we know what we’re doing…and we really care.

Gigi: That’s wonderful to have on the website. People will see that you bring them the best in music. I want to make note about your career and thank you for what you have done throughout the years. I going back to the years as a booking agent and your years at the Blue Note jazz club as Director of Marketing and your experience in PR. We need more people like you to do this around the globe, especially here in the U.S.

DM: Thank you! We’re trying really hard to spread the love and keep the music going all over the place. We just did a very big Monterey Jazz All Stars tour that played four shows in Florida and we did 45 other shows around the country and we went to Calgary, Canada, we were up in Alaska, we did every part of America that you can ever imagine. It was really successful, it played in a lot of really great performing arts theaters and concert halls and we tried to get that out there as much as we could to get the music heard by as many different people in different places. The tours like the “Kind of Blue” tour, that for us is really cool stuff, because we get to send these bands out to be able to go play at different theaters and we work with some great agencies and try to have those agencies sell the products that we put together. That’s how it works and it’s really a very exciting thing for us.

Gigi: And the festival will take place on Saturday, June 29 and Sunday, June 30? 

DM:  Yes. It’s the Freihofer’s Saratoga Jazz Festival. Freihofer’s is a really big bakery company up in New York State and they have been sponsoring the festival for a long time and they are great people. It’s going to be fun!

Gigi: The festival has been going on for last 36 years. When did you actually take over the festival, its production and its artistic direction? 

DM:  I started working on the festival in 1991 and I started booking all of the artists in 1999 and I’ve been booking the festival ever since 1999, so every year since then I’ve been booking it. I became a partner and took over the festival in 2008, so it’s been a long road and I’ve been there a long time and I really do love it very much and I have a long history there. For me…I’ve done a lot of things as you said, but this festival really is the “jewel in the crown” I really love it.

Gigi: Why is it so special to you? It seems like it is your baby so to speak. 

DM:  The festival is in a beautiful location, it’s at the Performing Arts Theater and the audience is dedicated. I have the opportunity to book a lot of different types of groups and give the audience a chance to hear new groups and to learn about new music and to have the band get in front of a new audience and it also gives me the the opportunity to discover on the small stage a lot of new artists. The last fifteen years or so I have been able to introduce young artists like Esperanza Spalding, and Lizz Wright and a lot of other artists to that crowd and now they have become much more popular artists. I booked them years and years ago when nobody knew who they were.

Gigi: Exactly! 

DM:  Yeah! So because of that stage and the way that the audience is, they are so open-minded, it really gives me a chance to be creative and that’s super important for me. So that’s just kind of why…I really love it.

Gigi: That’s beautiful, I wish I could be there! I have to ask…with all of the years of involvement in jazz for yourself and even for me, people always ask me if I play an instrument and I say when I was a child. So my question to you is do you play an instrument? 

DM:  I played clarinet when I was a kid from the time I was in fourth grade until I was a senior in high school and I really loved it and I was pretty good and I actually sat in the first chair in the high school orchestra; so the truth of the story is that I got in some sort of argument with the band teacher when I was a senior and he took my solo away from me for the spring concert and I had an attitude and I quit. So, I always loved music, I’m a big record collector and I spent a lot of money on concerts when I was in high school and college and I still do, but I gave it up. I gave up playing and I’m really sorry that I did that.

Gigi: I know what you mean. 

DM:  You gave it up?

Gigi: Yes! I could just kick myself! I wish I had stayed with it too! So what’s next for you this year outside of Newport Jazz Festival? 

DM:  The first thing I am doing in a few days from now is John McLaughlin in Boston, I’m producing his concert and we have Saratoga of course and Newport and then in the fall we’re staring up the jazz series at Carnegie Hall “The Shape of Jazz”. We’re doing some “Treme” touring concerts and we’ve worked with HBO for quite a few years doing these “Treme” brand of New Orleans music celebrations at different performing arts centers, so we have some shows in September, October, November and we have some touring projects in 2014. A big thing that we do all year around which is a different brain if you will, is we manage the saxophone player, Rudresh Mahanthappa, he is really busy and has a lot of shows coming up. He’s playing at the Winnipeg Jazz Festival, he’s playing the Chicago Jazz Festival, at the Jazz Standard in New York City and in Europe. He’s won a lot of awards and is a great saxophone player.

Gigi: That is fantastic! What website can we go to to find out what events you have going on around the world? 

DM:  It’s AbsolutelyLive.net. You can go there and our calendar is there and you can read about who we are and what we do and the services we provide. Check it out! ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912203991.44/warc/CC-MAIN-20190325133117-20190325155117-00087.warc.gz

 Gigi Brooks:   You have such an incredible legacy in music. I want to start with your early beginnings and your love for the piano. Tell me about those days.

Kevin Toney:   I come from a musical family really. My two older brothers and older sister, played music, so my oldest recollection was that there was a lot of music around the house. My first piano lesson came at age five I could barely reach the piano maybe I was playing at age four. Piano and I found each other very early in life and I took lessons, I had an interest in writing music and I was writing short classical pieces. By the time I was eight years old I added cello and alto saxophone to my playing instruments and I played all three of those instruments essentially throughout high school; piano was always there.

Then I got interested in improvised music in jazz in the seventh grade. I went to junior high school with a friend of mine named Charles Jackson and we were going to do a performance and he said “look man, we should play this song”. So I went over his house and he pulled out Horace Silver’s “Song For My Father.” I fell in love with it and I learned the melody of it and I learned two or three choruses of the solo and that was pretty huge for me to play by memory.

I fast forward to high school, by the time I got to high school in the tenth grade I went to this high school in Detroit named Cass Tech High School, that school is the equivalent to 2 years of college in terms of its concentration in the musical knowledge that you got. There were a lot of great musicians who were there before me like Donald Byrd, who I went to study with at Howard University, Ron Carter went there, so I began a rich legacy. Even Ray Parker, who is a buddy of mine, was there with me. Later, after I graduated people like Geri Allen came there to study and then she came to Howard. So anyway Cass Tech was really a very fertile ground for me. My journey really received a booster there in terms of jazz and improvisational techniques.

I met this other musical mentor named Billy McCoy, a pianist and he worked in a record store and one day I came by the record store after school and I was browsing through some records and he came over immediately and asked what I did and I told him I was a pianist. Then he asked me have I heard of Herbie Hancock, McCoy Tyner, how bout’ this Miles Davis? I knew about Miles Davis, but he was having me check out all of this music that Herbie Hancock was playing with Miles. It really opened up my ears! He turned me on to Bill Evans and Art Tatum…all the ground breaking musical benchmark pianists, Wynton Kelly, Red Garland, these guys from out of that period. He opened up my ears to Chick Corea and Keith Jarrett. When I think about what Billy McCoy did for me it was such a pivotal point.

There was a pianist by the name of Hal McKinney, who was an outstanding pianist. He and trumpeter, Marcus Belgrave ran a Metropolitan Arts program; it was federally funded. After school, kids could come there and learn how to play jazz from the masters.

By the time I was in eleventh grade I was playing with Detroit’s top jazz musicians. What’s interesting is this – people say to me, ‘you’re from Detroit. Did you do much Motown?’ [laughs].

 [laughs] Tell me about your experience at Howard University and how your connection with Dr. Donald Byrd came about. 

My next section of my development came in D.C., I owe a lot to D.C. besides the fact that I was a founding member of The Blackbyrds; a group that was started by jazz legend, trumpeter, Donald Byrd; Donald really formed that group from his course students.

What did you learn from him? Of all of the best lessons you’ve had in music with other great musicians, what did you take away from your experience with Donald Byrd, because we both know how incredible and phenomenal he is. 

Well, there are several aspects and I’ll give them, because this is a very important question. Musically speaking I learned a lot; I learned how to take my style…he was able to take my style and show me how to develop it into a personal style and how to approach my improvisation from a compositional point of view. When I came to Howard I was a jazz studies major and composition major, so he gave me some techniques on how to…again approach my improvisation from a compositional point of view; he gave me the platform to practice and get paid. Me and another student named Barney Perry, began to work with him right away…he took us under his wing right away. We began doing gigs with Donald on the weekends, when he wasn’t teaching and when we weren’t in school. We worked with Donald’s top New York band, cutting edge “A-1” jazz guys and here we were 18 years old just coming to Howard, so we had the experience of being able to play with people of Donald’s caliber and that’s invaluable!

I also learned business wise too…we had the opportunity of being full-time students and the distinction of having a recording career. I learned the ins and outs about touring, of having a record deal and what the relationship of the record company is to the artist. I also learned through the “school of hard-knocks” what not to have in a contract. It is ironic that…with all due respect to Donald, we as The Blackbyrds went to school to study not only music, but the business of music and as we ended our relationship with Donald, we ended up dealing with some things that should have never even went down. The other lessons I got from Donald were paid lessons on how to be a better…how can I say it?

A businessman in music? 

Yes, how to be a better businessman in music and how not to pass on unnecessary procedures.

…And hardships. 

Right, in other words, how not to pass on old school philosophies and steps that aren’t necessary. So, I was able to move forward and take the positive and the things that were negative into fact so that I think it helped me to be the person in how I treat people who I work with now. Let me just tell you this…in saying that if I had to go back in time and I had to do it again from after high school into college I would just really pray that God would bless me again with a situation like that. The situation that I had with The Blackbyrds and Donald Byrd, being a full-time student and studying with him and that experience… I could never buy that. You cannot buy that experience and it was my introduction and it was my start and it still is the core of my entertainment career; so I owe a lot to that experience and I am indebted and grateful for the opportunity that Donald gave us all.

Not only that The Blackbyrds are a legendary jazz, R&B group. For those of us who know and understand our music we can’t think of Donald Byrd without the Blackbyrds; or anytime we think of Bobbi Humphrey, we know The Blackbyrds are going to be on the record. 

Absolutely! You know it’s important that I make the distinction, I always try to clarify. Many people remember the group as Donald Byrd and The Blackbyrds, but the fact of it is we were Donald Byrd and The Blackbyrds only on our live shows; on records we were The Blackbyrds. On records we performed and played our own music, Donald was our producer; we had a separate contract and together as Donald Byrd and The Blackbyrds we played his music and as The Blackbyrds he played our music…that’s what the deal was with that.

Yes. I should have made that distinction. Thank you for clarifying that for us. 

Sure. Going back about The Blackbyrds, I’m blessed that I was able to write half of that catalog in its capacity. It was a group effort and a lot of our hits were group songs like “Rock Creek Park,” that was written by the band; “Walking In Rhythm,” was written by the guitar player; “Unfinished Business” was a composition I wrote that received a Grammy nomination. It was an ideal situation for all of the members that we were able to contribute songs and get them recorded and produced. It really set the stage for what I’ve done over the last 30 years as a composer, producer and performer.

All the time that I was with The Blackbyrds, I was playing straight-ahead jazz when I was not on the road with The Blackbyrds in D.C., because D.C. was such a fertile ground. I really matured and really got my style together in Washington, D.C.; it was my finishing touches in terms of being a musician.

I used to play with this guy named Andrew White, a lot of people do not know who he is, but he is from Washington, D.C. and one of the leading specialists of the music of John Coltrane.  I made at least fifteen or sixteen records with him in the John Coltrane style and original songs from John Coltrane themes. So, when I wasn’t on the road with The Blackbyrds, I’d be in town in D.C. in the clubs with Andrew making records and playing jazz and stuff. Playing jazz to me has been always a part of what I do, even though with The Blackbyrds we played less than the mainstream stuff and more of the new stuff, but jazz has always been the underlying thing.

I’ll fast forward to my first solo release which was called Special K, in the early ’80’s and I was still trying to find myself as an artist and it was a great experience, but that was the beginning of my solo career. People wonder what I was doing in between that time. Well, my next record that came out as a solo was in 1994, twelve years later. That was really when I established my solo career as what was then known as the budding Smooth Jazz market. I had a record called Lovescape, which is still my biggest selling record and most well known piece.

What other projects have you worked on in your career using your talents as an artist? 

It’s interesting, because I began to work in musical theatre. Musical   theatre found me. I became musical director of shows like Ain’t Misbehavin’, the music of Fats Waller. I was doing shows like Five Guys Named Mo, I did a national tour as one of the music directors; the music of Louis Jordan. I was doing shows like Harlem Suite.

I was able to do so, because God has given me the gift to be able to play anything on the piano. I’ve never been limited to just playing R&B. I found it appealing, especially with black based theatre, because I could go back in time and play all of that stride piano stuff. I love the history of our music and to know it so that I can move our music ahead.

You’ve recently written a book called The Virtuous Man- Breaking the Men’s Code. Tell me a little about that. 

My music has been a set-up and a journey to now be able to…through my music get another message out there that men need to hear…that young men need to hear as well, about how to break this cycle of infidelity in marriage and remain faithful in your marriage and those tools that you can use to do that based my fallen experience; how God restored my marriage and restored me as a man.

The book is very informative and I wish you the best on that.  I have to ask you about the years with producers and song-writers Larry and Fonce Mizell, because they were such talented producers and innovators. What did you learn from them?

Also, I noticed you’ve got Don Mizell as producer on your new release Kevin Toney 3-New American Suite. 

Well, actually Don Mizell is the cousin of Larry and Fonce. The Mizells, Larry and Fonce were two of Donald Byrd’s earlier students; they were at Howard University before we came there. Donald’s first success into what you call cross-over jazz really came through the production work of Larry and Fonce and they produced his record called Flight Time. That’s when Donald began to have this new sound…new success into the 70’s, we weren’t The Blackbyrds yet, so we initially as a group, The Blackbyrds, being part of just the Donald Byrd septet began to work with Larry and Fonce on the live shows when we would go off to California and so we had a chance to know them personally and musically.

It was a great experience in that their approach was pretty much the opposite approach of academic; in other words the charts were sketchy, there weren’t any in depth charts kinda’ stuff. It would be more or less “here’s a letter A section, here’s a letter B, and when I say go to it, go to it!”

That was cool as opposed to the academic point of view that we were studying, you know you have charts and the arrangements are written out or there’s a lead sheet. So they were very intuitive and this was a good thing, because again I think and know that both approaches are valid. I mean a musician should be able to not only know the academic stuff, but the street stuff, here’s the bridge, here’s letter “A”…here’s “B”.

It was a great counter to our academic approach and what I learned from them is simplicity in song structures and arrangements. Two or three sections can be played. I didn’t have to write Beethoven’s “Fifth Symphony” or write everything I knew I could write or play everything I knew I could play. So they showed us simplicity, they also showed us… I would call…how to think out of the box in terms of chord changes. From a musical point of view…some of the stuff they had at first listening, I’d say “wow!” This isn’t a 2,5,1 change; this isn’t normal jazz changes. I think because they came from an island beat background and then writing songs for Donald, really gave Donald a whole new approach, because they didn’t come in there with the typical jazz stuff. Yet it was made jazz with Donald’s background and history and of course like ours when we got to work with them.

Back to Don Mizell, many people know him as being one of the producers of Genius Loves Company, Ray Charles’ Grammy-award winning record back in 2005. Don Mizell is an industry veteran. He is a lawyer, confidant and advisor to me. He is our Executive Creative Producer.

Your trio is Kevin Toney 3 and your new release is New American Suite, which is a soulful, sometimes funky, full jazz album with a touch of rag-time; Michael Bradford on bass and Chris Coleman on drums. I read that you wrote this album in honor of America’s music. Where did the concept for this album come from? 

We came up with the concept of this album in several ways. First, we came up with the idea that we should get an art piece to put on here from one of my friends, Bernard and Shirley Kinsey. Don and I came up with the song titles in one evening. The music for New American Suite was written first. I joke about this with the band members, Michael Bradford and Chris Common in that when we had these songs; they only had numbers…”New Jazz #1″, “New Jazz #2, all the way up to “New Jazz #8” .

Later, I came up with this concept that the title track should be “New American Suite.” I decided that because it was a suite composition and it was sectional that at first, I should call it “American Suite.” I had this conceptually as a title, but Donald and I researched it and found that Dvorak had a piece called American Suite, so let’s don’t call it that, let’s call it New American Suite. So from there these titles came out. Don has got to be one of the most brilliant people I know.

When I saw another Mizell on the album I thought to myself there’s got to be something here, because we know the great producers that Larry and Fonce were and what they brought to the table; my deepest condolences to Larry and Don on the passing of Alphonse (Fonce) Mizell. 

With passion I say that Fonce and Larry have written a chapter in American music.

I agree! 

The end result of what you hear on New American Suite, are really some men who share the same spiritual beliefs. Our music is more than just a bunch of guys who got together to play and get together having a vibe. Our layers of our faith are relevant in these songs. I tell you this is the best band that I’ve ever played with in terms of my own groups. That gets to the point of what’s different about this record, I mean this is my tenth record by the way. I know people will be surprised.

This record is different, because of collaboration. I’ve got collaboration with Michael Bradford and Chris Coleman on the songs, Don Mizell on production. We’ve got collaboration from adding a piece of artwork right here, because if you just wanted to look at the album’s artwork, you can have a conversation about that, because there’s a piece of fine art on there by an artist named Richard Mayhew “Fugue 2000”. The way that we got permission to use this was through my wife’s and my friends, Bernard and Shirley Kinsey, who had the largest collection of African-American and African artifacts in the United States. It has been on display at the Smithsonian and other museums around the country.

The fact that you revisited Scott Joplin’s “The Entertainer” on this album is very unusual in jazz today. What made you go that route? 

Don Mizell. I remember sharing these songs with Don and he suggested that I do a Scott Joplin piece or something and do a modern take on it. Scott Joplin was one of our first great American composers; he was there before Gershwin and a lot of people don’t remember that. So it was our way to say new America lets go back and get something from the old America.

So he said lets pick a song, because there were several songs of Scott Joplin’s that I liked, but there was something about “The Entertainer”… the arrangements fell in place for me just like that! I went to the piano and started playing it and writing it out and God blessed me with what you hear there. Everybody knows it. We wanted to take his masterpiece and put it in 2012. It is suite-like, it starts off with just the piano making a statement, then we bring in the band, we have this reggae-swing feel, we paint our jazz textures over it and finish the piece with a rag-time feel to remind people of where it came from.

The entire album recreates jazz as we know it. 

That’s a good way to look at it. Even though we have a lot of different styles here, it really comes together as a seamless thread. ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912204969.39/warc/CC-MAIN-20190326095131-20190326121131-00474.warc.gz

 We all know him as detective Rico Tubbs from the iconic 80’s hit television series, Miami Vice; which is still in syndication on cable. Philip Michael Thomas possesses one of the most memorable television and movie careers in the world, which propelled him into the status of “Icon.”

Over the last few years it has been my privilege to know him as my mentor, confidant and closest friend.

Recently, I had the pleasure of sitting down to talk with him and the extremely talented gospel jazz singer, Kathy Yolanda Rice about their new single, written by Philip Michael Thomas, “Flesh of My Flesh.”  The duet between Philip Michael Thomas and Kathy Yolanda Rice is breathtaking to say the least. We talk in depth about their successful careers and how they came to perform this work of art together.

I hope you will enjoy it as much as I did!
 Gigi: Philip and Kathy you have just completed your collaboration on the new gospel jazz single release, “Flesh of My Flesh”, which was written by you, Philip some years ago. What inspired you to write such beautiful lyrics? Where were you in that time in your life when you wrote that song?

Philip:  This was the wedding song between Mary and Joseph….Mary the mother of Jesus Christ and Joseph. I had an opportunity many, many years ago to write a gospel musical called “Emmanuel,” with a very dear friend, Bishop Williams. He’s the Bishop of the Ethiopian Coptic Church in New York. We met back in 1980 when he was a priest and we always talked about the Lord; he’s one of the few men in my life that was a confidant and a friend to me. In fact, when I turned 40 we went on a forty day fast together. This song has reaching value in terms of my spiritual roots and how God has moved with me to send this love message to the world. If God chose Mary to be the chosen woman to bring forth the Son of God…then whew!

Anyway…back to the story…and so as I was praying and working on this, God gave me this beautiful song “Flesh of My Flesh” and the words are biblical.

Gigi: It is important to point out that this is not the first song you have ever written, you’ve written many songs and your music career goes back way before your television career. 

Philip:  Oh, yes! I was blessed to write my first song at age eleven. It was called “Trouble Child.” The first song I recorded in 1968 was called “All My Love”, which was on my album Living the Book of My Life, which was released in 1986. I have written several musicals or co-written and I have a treasure chest full of wonderful spiritual music…I know you’ve heard some of it.

Gigi: Yes, I have. 

Philip:  That’s one of some of the things that brought Kathy and I together; we met on MySpace about five years ago and we began to share music and that’s what brought us to this point to finally record this sacred duet.

Gigi: Kathy, you have a pretty extensive career and you have been playing piano and singing since you were very young; you are a musician in your own right. What was it about this song that made you want to join forces with Philip and actually record it with him? What was it about the song that made you want to put your voice on top of it? 

Kathy:  The song just resonated really, really deeply with me, because every time I would hear it…the very beginning of the song when Philip would sing… “I do love you”; I felt a spirituality in those words that I just kinda’ locked onto and it was more than just romantic; I felt like the song gave me hope to someday have a loving relationship that would be ordained by God. And so it took on a much deeper meaning and purpose in my life. It was not just an ordinary love song; this is the voice of someone who is pledging their love and commitment to you for life. That’s what really brought me in…the words and of course the melody was beautiful and the bridge in the song had a change you wouldn’t expect and I liked that. The song was structured somewhat differently than what you would normally expect..the mood slightly changes and then it goes back and I just loved it. And I said that’s one I would love to do.  Ironically at that time that Philip and I were communicating and sharing the music, I was going through a tough time in my personal life and over the years I have come to have the Lord bless me with a good husband where I can actually live this “flesh of my flesh” type of relationship in real life. I think if I had not had the spiritual guidance from Philip, my heart may not have been ready for a godly, loving relationship and so I have to thank him for that…keep your heart open.

Gigi: That is wonderful advice Kathy!  Philip, I’d like to go back to what you were saying about your meeting Kathy and that you’ve known her for years. You mentioned before that you both have never met and I think it’s incredible that you have collaborated on a song together and recorded it. What was it about her voice that you knew was right for this particular song? 

Philip:  Well, from the first day I heard Kathy’s voice I felt a kinship with her tone…there was something in the tone of her voice that just magnetized me to listen over and over again. I was drawn to it and I knew as time went by and years went by… that we would finally do some magnificent work together. I knew that we wouldn’t just go into the studio and record some songs on an album…we would do classics! I feel that God has given her a voice that she may not even understand or over-understand  what God is about to do with her voice. As a composer I have been fortunate to take years sometimes in developing a composition and I’ve had conversations with great artists that I’ve communicated with like Miles Davis and a few others that have done similar things you know…you get an idea and you put it up in your treasure chest and you go back to it, because everything’s in its own time. This song “Flesh of My Flesh” was an idea whose time had come and Kathy’s voice and my voice and our creative relationship just bonded. My feeling is about what this song is…it’s the cornerstone in the development of the true, true soul musical vibration that we’ve been gifted with and I’m so happy to be a part of it.

Gigi: I clearly get what you are talking about Philip, and I have heard the song and I must say it is a one-of-a-kind, very special song. Kathy, what do you want people to know about you and your music? 

Kathy:  That I’m honest. I won’t do a lot of things musically just for show, you know? I generally perform the way that I feel…that would be the main thing to know. I want to interject something regarding Philip…Philip and I communicated for quite some time just through email and when we finally spoke on the phone I said wow I really need to know that I am talking to you! I remember rushing to my office and waiting for that call. It was so funny, when I heard his voice I felt like he was a relative, I didn’t feel like he was a stranger at all; it was a type of kinship…it was remarkable! We are just very close in the way that we communicate and we’re on the same page in our thinking about a lot of things as we navigate through our creative process.

Gigi: Do you believe that it comes out in your music? 

Philip & Kathy:  Absolutely!

Kathy:  I think when we do meet it will be monumental!

Philip:  It’s very interesting…because of the way modern technology is today, we can do things now that I could have never done 30 years ago when I first built my Spaceship recording studio in Miami. I spent a tremendous amount of money in developing and things like that…but the things you can do now with a little investment is incredible! The most important foundation of any success as far as a song is concerned is the song! It takes a good singer to make a song great, but a great singer can’t make a bad song good.

Gigi: That’s right! 

Philip:  So, it’s the foundation…that’s one of the things Kathy and I do agree on; that we’re using material, this being the first one that we’ve been blessed to do that we’re  praying and asking for guidance, because people might not understand this today in 2013, but surely years from now when God brings the things down from heaven all of the blessing and dreams that I’ve been visualizing about, they’ll say ‘Oh, my God!’

Gigi: Yes! Do you see in the near future a tour promoting the song? 

Philip:  Absolutely! We’ve been  discussing orchestras…[laughs] and some wonderful things! I don’t think it’s going to be limited to “Flesh of My Flesh”. As a performance, it’s nice to have one song that is great, but when you go to really perform you have to have a concert and Kathy has wonderful music and I have wonderful music, but it will be interesting to see how we continue to put the building blocks together so that we have a performance that is says…’ this is what we do’. Even though I’ve been extremely successful on every level entertainment wise that you can think of, I never take it for granted when I’m working that I can stand on that as a measuring stick for anything…I forget about all of that and I take this moment in time and say ‘God, what are You going to teach me about this?’ I’m very humble in that way. I feel that there’s an education taking place between Kathy and I as musicians right now and it’s going to overflow into the world and they’re going to be touched just a little bit different than the “norm”.

Gigi: I think so too. Kathy, you have worked with so many people in your career. Let’s talk about the producer of this record, Kelvin Wooten, from the ’90’s R&B group, Tony! Toni! Tone! what did he bring to the table to make this such a wonderful experience for you? What did you learn from him? 

Kathy:  Well, Kelvin was responsible for the musical production and he has done all of the musical production of all of the songs that I have recorded; he did the music for my debut album as well as the other projects. He is a very gifted instrumentalist and he has been working with major artists you hear on the radio, especially in the R&B, neo-soul genre. As a matter of fact, he worked on quite a few hits with singer, Anthony Hamilton and Jill Scott. In fact, he was one of the co-writers on the duet that Jill Scott and Anthony Hamilton did that went to number one on Billboard and I think it stayed there for quite a few weeks…so he’s got quite a reputation. Kelvin and I work very well in the studio together and I listen to his instructions as well as he’ll listen to some things that I’ve asked for on the production; so I would say that I’ve executive produced “Flesh of My Flesh.” Philip and David Michael of KDS Studios in Orlando, Florida, did the final mixing and mastering; it was quite a process.

Gigi: When will it be available for purchase? 

Kathy:  It’s available right now at Amazon.com, CD Baby, as well as iTunes and you can listen to the full streaming of the song on Sound Cloud and my official website, KathyYolandaRice.com.

Gigi: I am so thrilled and I wish the best for you both on the success of this single and for future projects. Philip, some people have no idea what a music career you have had and this will bring everything to light. Many are so accustomed to seeing you on television and movies. They will be in for a shock to find out what a beautiful voice you have and also how great a musician you are. I want to thank you both for sharing this beautiful collaboration. 

Philip:  Thank you, it’s such a pleasure! ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912203991.44/warc/CC-MAIN-20190325133117-20190325155117-00250.warc.gz
45,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/ggjazz/qa-dianne-reeves/,"Dianne Reeves (photo by Jerris Madison) There are rare moments in music that take my breath away. One in particular was Dianne Reeves’ recent July performance at the Westhampton Beach Performing Arts Center in New York. The evening sparked off with her band-guitarist Peter Sprague, pianist Peter Martin, drummer Terreon Gully and bassist Reginald Veal-tearing into Afro-Cuban rhythms and rich textures, filling the auditorium with wild anticipation.

Enter the five-time Grammy Award-winning vocalist, composer and producer, beautifully draped in a golden ethnic wrap, her braided hair in a stylish upward swoop. The band became one with her as she stepped into the spotlight, while the audience roared with applause and welcome. This was a chance to hear one of jazz’s most versatile improvisational scat singers.

As she approached the stage with a smile, I noticed a hint of sadness in her eyes. It was at that moment that she encouraged the audience to stand strong and to love their fellow man, in the wake of recent violence by and against law enforcement and the racial tension in this nation and abroad. I felt her pain.

A few song selections were reflective of her life, like my favorite, “Nine,” which took us back to her childhood and our own; we joined her in remembering how we as children could not wait until we were 9, then 13, then 20 and so on. This joy of living is also reflected in her latest album, last year’s Concord release Beautiful Life, which won her a Grammy for Best Jazz Vocal Album and a nomination for the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Jazz Album.

There were also a few covers, including her impeccable scat of Pat Metheny’s “Minuano (Six Eight).” She managed to bring many of us to tears by the concert’s end, bidding us farewell and offering a reminder to love our fellow man. A lengthy standing ovation followed, with an arm-in-arm bow.

Following the concert, I was able to speak with Reeves (for the second time) about her life in music.

GB: Do you feel you’re where you want to be in your career at this time in your life? You’ve been at this for a few decades now.

DR: Yes, I really do. I feel like I’m in a good place. I’m in a place where I can make all kinds of choices. I can just be myself. I can make the music I want to make, and sing in the places and go to the places I want to go to, so it’s a good time. I love that [there are so many musicians with] a collaborative spirit that’s so available right now. I think it’s always been [that way], but even more so now. So I’m loving that, because it’s in those collaborations that you find new things about yourself.

Yes, I heard that in your Beautiful Life release. I noticed the collaborative gathering of artists such as Esperanza Spalding, Gregory Porter, Gerald Clayton, Robert Glasper and your late, great cousin George Duke, along with many others. I thought to myself, “I wish I had been present during those recording sessions.” I read where you said that the meaning of Beautiful Life was recognizing and walking in the blessings. Where are you in your life, with walking in that place with God and music?

Yes, [I’m] holding on. You know, try to really keep the hope alive, as we’ve heard many times. Also, trying to shine as bright as I can. This is a time that we need to shine the light on a lot of the darkness that is encroaching upon us today. I feel everything that’s going on, all sides of it, and one of the things that I know for sure is that music has always kept me pretty centered, and it’s a place where I can let go, and be, and share, and give, and be the light that I want to be. So I’m always praying to God to keep me lifted, to keep everybody lifted and in a place where I can think clearly, and be conscious, and really, really hear in my spirit the direction I’m to go.

I saw that this evening when you were onstage and you mentioned what’s going on in this nation and in the world. And I saw the pain in your face, because we know we’ve had some news today. [Ed. note: Reeves’ concert took place on July 17, the day three law enforcement officers were shot and killed in Baton Rouge, La.] I thought, “I can’t take another bad report.” Like you were saying, we must be conscious and be able to hear.

Right. This is a time, because of the news outlets and social media, people are expressing their anger and their emotions without clarity. We have to see the bigger picture, that we really are a nation in need of healing … everybody. I was talking to a friend of mine the other day, and we were talking about how, when we were kids, we used to say the Pledge of Allegiance in school: “One nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.”

I had forgotten about that. I mean, we used to say that every single day. We didn’t know at the time what we were saying, but it was getting into our spirits. We just have to remember that, and we have to remember that without humanity we will descend into something that will be like hell.

Do you think you’d like to participate in something similar to Quincy Jones’ “We Are the World,” where [musicians came together to raise funds for humanitarian aid in Africa?]

I’m open. Absolutely. I know that Harry Belafonte is putting together a big project in October in Atlanta, with musicians from all over the world. It’s starting to come out and be announced, and he called and asked me if I would be a part of it and I said absolutely.

When you were walking around onstage I could see this light on you, and it wasn’t the light from the spotlight. It was the light in you. … Do you know that you are bringing people to an awareness that there’s something greater than themselves?

I am so glad to know that. I submit. I’m always just submitting daily, because you just have to, you know? Especially when I walk onstage, because words are powerful and [because of] the energy that music has. And I have a very, very special band that supports me not just musically but spiritually. They feel it and everybody’s obedient; we try to be as much as we can. We let go and basically let God.

Yes. Obedience is key to walking in the Blessing.

So that you can hear, because sometimes you want to go … I thought maybe I should sing this or that, then I said, “God, whatever You want me to sing, I’ll sing. However You want me to do it, I’ll do it.”

I agree. I love you with your band, of course, but do you ever think you’ll record an album a cappella? Your voice is as clear as a bell.

I never thought about it. I’m open.

Do you sing to yourself?

To myself? No! [laughs] That’s funny! You know, I have a hard time even listening to myself.

You do?

Yeah, I do. I’m very critical, but I don’t have a hard time in the moment when it’s happening, because it’s like being taken over, so that feels good.

If I had a voice like yours, I’d sing myself to sleep. What can we look forward to next with your television projects? I recall watching an episode of Sex and the City and I saw you singing “Is That All There Is?”

I’m open to all of that. I’m getting ready to do a record in Marciac, France, in August, so I’m looking forward to that. ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912203991.44/warc/CC-MAIN-20190325133117-20190325155117-00029.warc.gz
46,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/gratalks/saxophonist-bill-evans-music-is-music/,"Bill Evans The interview took place with the 25-year-anniversary Walk Away tour, in Rybnik, Poland. The author thanks Jacek Panek for his help in preparing the interview.
 Grażyna Studzińska-Cavour: You were born ninth of February… that’s exactly the same day that my son was born!

Bill Evans: Ahh!

GSC:  You are Aquarius, I am Aquarian so we can talk not about music and your family life… but about stars for example…

BE:  Here we go! Whatever you want!

GSC:  I’m a big fan of Walk Away since my first year of studies when they started… you recorded “Petite Blonde”… lots to talk about! But just say: why Walk Away?

BE:  Well… I mean, I usually play with my band all year. And I heard the music of Walk Away fourteen years ago from Chris (Zawadzki) and he said “would you like to do some concerts?”  and it was in between tours for me and I thought “why not? Let’s try”. And we had the relationship since then.

GSC:  So he was the “agent provocateur” of those common gigs?

BE: Yes. He heard me and called me first asking me if I wanna to be a guest.

GSC:  Both in Gliwice and here in Rybnik you made extremely lively and energetic performance together, full of vigorous elements, funky and groovy. Sax conversations with Adam Wendt seemed to fake some arguments, you were also a bit rude while trying to get Krzysztof (Zawadzki) mistaken in his rhythm. Do you like the atmosphere in Walk Away?

BE:  I like funky-groovy music, it’s interesting to me and similar to some other staff I do so we complement each other and it’s a lot of fun. So I played with them several times and it’s a lot of fun for me, cause I like to play with musicians that are very good and the musicians I have fun with and that’s what I have with these guys!

GSC:  I can hear that your style varies.  The project is in the mood of “Push” with Marcus Miller and Bob James rather than your Touch” CD.

BE:  You know, Touch is with a little bit more variations but all the records I’ve written so far or I made content to, they all come from a rhythmic base so people while listening can get something of that in all my records.

GSC:  Your album The Other Side of Something as well as  Soulgrass, Have Fun… most of your records are very crowdy, are full of musicians, full of people. Victor Wooten, Bela Fleck, Richard Bona, Dennis Chambers, Randy Brecker, Vinnie Colaiuta, Lee Ritenour, even Willie Nelson or Adam Rogers (with whom I had pleasure to talk a month ago at the Palm Jazz Festival) and many many more… do you like crowds in music?

BE:  Some are. Certainly yes. But I’ve done some CDs where it’s been just a few… but I make sure that whichever musicians play on the record the record sounds like it’s coming from the same group. And I don’t do all different kinds of music on one record I usually do different records. Just like my last CD, you mentioned, called The Other Side of Something. That’s sort of another kind of record after Soulgrass because the music in the last five years has been with banjo, violin… and now it’s a different kind of music, but it all sounds like it’s coming from the same men and the same area. I’m trying to do that.

GSC:  …but you were also the member of Mahavishnu Orchestra….

BE:  A long time ago, yeah. Yes, I was. And that music was very funky and groove oriented also. You know, I like rhythm. And I like drums and I like things that inspire me rhythmically and that’s the kind of music I usually like to play…

GSC:  I had pleasure to talk to Trilok Gurtu a month ago. Did you have the opportunity to play with him in Mahavishnu or was it later?

BE:  No. I played and recorded with Trilok and with his own group a number of years ago and we have plans of putting a trio together in next couple of years so me and Trilok will be doing something together once again.

GSC:  Dean Brown on your Soul Insider and now here doing a stage show. Are you both the fun-loving personalities that fit together? Friendship maybe?

BE:  Yeah, of course! We think alike in a lot of different ways. We come from similar backgrounds, we’re both from New York, I mean, we lived in New York for a long time and he did many tours with me and my group. I like his music and he likes my music, we like playing together so it works all perfectly well. But it’s also personalities not just music but personalities of two guys.

GSC: You were the third Bill Evans in Miles Davis team. Bill Evans, piano player, and Yusef Lateef, the “hidden” Bill Evans of sax. Did you have the chance to play together?

BE: No. Unfortunately not. I didn’t even know Lateef played with Miles!

GSC:  As a young and shy boy you must have felt awarded by playing with Miles Davis? Was it a kind of practice school, a workshop for you? Push was a kind of tribute.

BE:  With Miles, I was just coming from college so it was a learning experience. I knew Miles very well but it was really a learning experience for me because it was a first well known band I ever played with and it was great. Just great.

GSC:  You talk about learning experience and is there any teaching in your life now? Do you lead your master classes?

BE:  You know, I do sometimes, and I like to but I travel so much with my group that I don’t have the opportunity as much but I enjoy it because I took a lot of lessons and met a lot of good teachers as I was coming up so I have a lot of knowledge from different teachers that I would like to pass on so when I get the opportunity I do.

GSC:  Do you somehow promote young musicians?

BE:  Sure, I do. I play with them. My banjo player is young, he’s new, my drummer Josh Dion who plays in my group is also young. I love them. I love to play with young musicians and have the opportunity to bring them out.

GSC:  Bring out, you say and what about bringing up? What about your father? He was a piano player, was he inspired by a famous “jazz name” of the big two and predicted the music career of his son at birth or was it just coincidence?

BE:  Nooo. The coincidence, I think. He basically played piano when he was very young. Up to twelve years old or so but he used to teach me classical piano as I was a kid. By ear. I was learning piano by ear so that was really helpful in my future job.

GSC:   Your style. You play fusion but in the lyrical way, are you romantic? Is it anything except music in your life or are there any other hidden features or hobbies of Bill Evans?

BE:  Yeah, many things! Music is only one part of my life. Depends on a time of a year  but I like to ski, I like to play golf, I like to go fishing and I like to do lots of other things. I started painting so I’d like to do that. So I do different things. Musing is only one part, it’s not everything.

GSC:  The technique you use is rather rare among saxophonists. A lot of staccato, changing instruments… What is so special in your attitude to sax? Why sax, why you chose the instrument?

BE:  The instrument sort of chose me. I was listening to a high school, a middle school band playing jazz and I saw the saxophone players get up, you know, they take solo in starlight, and I thought “that’s what I wanna do! That’s the instrument for me!” And I liked it from that point on. I was eleven years old.

GSC:  Soulgrass was nominated for a Grammy… what does it mean to you? Are awards important?

BE:  No, not at all. Because it’s a popularity contest and music is not a popularity contest. Music is not a sporting event, music is music. That’s why I don’t like that. People seem to like awards but for me it’s not what music is about. At all.

GSC:  Stage or studio?

BE:  Stage.

GSC:  Big stage or a tiny one as in Jaworki? And why?

BE: I like different kinds. I get different kinds of inspiration from different sizes.

GSC:  A friend of mine, reminded me of the great concert of you from the beginning of nineties, namely in 1991 in Paris, with Miles, Al Foster, Herbie Hancock.  Do you remember it after so many concerts worldwide? Is it a kind of professional co-operation and atmosphere you like? Are some gigs more memorable than others?

BE:  Yes, of course I remember it! But do I remember every concert? No, not even close. There are a lot of good concerts that I play with my group but it’s hard to remember sometimes. That is what I do for a living so I play sixty or seventy per year, so in ten years it makes seven hundred concerts! It’s impossible to remember but that was a special concert. It was so many great musicians on stage, Herbie and Miles together, so that was memorable. Absolutely.

GSC:  Do you prefer to be a leader or the member of the group?

BE: Leader.

GSC:  And if you’re not a leader, like today? What is the difference?

BE: Oh, here it’s fun, you know. I’m a leader most of the time. On occasion it’s fun to not to have the responsibility of the leader. Sometimes you just come up and play. As a leader you always have things to do and think about.

GSC: As you are not for the first time in Poland, what about Poland, what about the Polish audience?

BE:  Polish audience is great! You know I find people here like music. Of course, they like it everywhere in the world it doesn’t matter whether you are in Spain or China or Thailand, or United States or wherever, people are people on the little planet and when they like this kind of music, they come.

GSC:  Your contact with the audience is great. You are not only the performer but also the devoted news blog-writer, how do you find time for that?

BE:  Well, I forget. Sometimes my webpage is empty. I just forget it. I did it just a few days ago but sometimes… I just get lazy and I don’t do it enough but I want to do it more. Some people do it every day but I’m not like that. I write when I have the inspiration.

GSC:  But that is an important feedback. What kind of feedback is better and more informative for a musician-onstage applause or the written one?

BE:  On stage of course. I’m not a real computer blog person.

GSC:  You write about your professional life as it was just a hobby and fun but it is hard work.

BE:  Of course…

GSC: The job of leaving and returning, changing places and people, always on the run, difficult for a family member, what do you like in it?

BE:  It has big highs and big lows, you know. The lows are travels. That’s difficult. You are away from home and stuff like that but the highs are getting to play music and you draw yourself and play with the musicians but always big highs and big lows are the part of the job.

GSC: Ok, so coming back to Aquarians: Aquarians are the signs of freedom, what does the word ‘freedom’ represent to you in music?

BE:  To be able to play music you wanna play. That’s the freedom. And fortunately I can do it.

GSC: Your plans for the future? Do you know which way to go?

BE: No idea. Just to keep playing music. Learning how to sing better. And to continue let the music grow. That’s my plan. To keep it simple. ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912203991.44/warc/CC-MAIN-20190325133117-20190325155117-00309.warc.gz
47,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/hearingvoices/cilla-owens-teacher-and-students-unite-for-cd/,"Cilla Owens Apart from occasional festival appearances, vocalist Cilla Owens’ work has largely been restricted to New York City and its environs. Now, with the release of her first album as a leader, the self-produced and self-released ‘Tis What It Is, the rest of the world finally gets the chance to discover what jazz-savvy New Yorkers have known for years: that Owens is a superbly gifted musician. Her sound, shaded and enriched by her extensive, intersecting experiences within the jazz, soul and spiritual spheres, is as smooth as Nancy Wilson, as authoritative as Sarah Vaughan and as deeply informed as Carmen McRae, yet remains distinctly her own.

A lifetime of preparation has gone into ‘Tis What It Is. Owens’ somewhat circuitous musical path began at Hunter College High School, where she raised her voice in the Christmas chorus, but was more interested in dancing than singing. At Boston University, music (and dancing) took a back seat to language studies, and upon graduation she began a teaching career with the New York Board of Education.

Owens’ musical commitment was ignited by a chance encounter at an open mic night. Sharing the stage with an unfamiliar pianist, Owens cut loose with a blistering “My Funny Valentine.” The pianist turned out to be Hank Jones, who encouraged her to pursue a professional singing career.

She began gigging around town, experimenting with pop, R&B and jazz, and joined the band Moment’s Notice. Much of her experience was, however, garnered from pass-the-hat street performances, where she formed longstanding professional relationships with a wide assortment of first-rate musicians, including pianist Arturo O’Farrill and saxophonist Sylvester “Sly” Scott.

Ultimately, Owens returned to school, obtaining a B.A. and Master’s in Music from Hunter College. She also indulged her broadening musical tastes by joining the Great Day Chorale which, with its commitment to the preservation of Negro Spirituals, was, she says, populated with “people who were living parts of African-American history.”

While at Hunter, Owens assisted various directors of the resident jazz ensembles and, after graduation, decided to stay, founding the performance workshop Jazzvox, where amateurs and professionals intermingle, and rising to the position of Director of the Jazz Vocal Workshop. She regularly augments her campus duties with work as a private vocal coach and club dates, including headlining appearances at Smalls and the Blue Note.

At Hunter, Owens befriended a trio of student buddies, bassist Ed Kollar, pianist Glafkos Kontemeniotis and drummer Vince “Kazi” McCoy. The threesome formed the band Monk for President which, alongside Sly Scott (doubling on tenor sax and flute), forms the backbone of ‘Tis What It Is.

Indicative of Owens’ wide-ranging tastes, the album is a cornucopia of delights. Half of the dozen tracks are given over to classic standards, extending from a petal-soft “The Nearness of You” and an exquisitely haunted “You Don’t Know What Love Is” to an easy-swinging “Thou Swell” and boisterously adventurous “Take the ‘A’ Train.” From there, Owens and her mates move on to more challenging pieces from the jazz canon, with particular focus on the Jon Hendricks oeuvre, assuredly boppin’ through “You Know Who” (based on Monk’s “I Know You”) and injecting “Little Niles” with an otherworldly lilt. Their “Twisted” is appropriately unhinged, and Freddie Hubbard’s “Little Sunflower,” superbly embroidered by Scott, unfolds like a shimmering, cloudless dawn.

The balance of the playlist comprises two originals. Owens’ “Simple Samba” is more complex than its title suggests, peppered with hints of salsa and calypso, its sun-dappled vigor providing ample space for all five musicians to stretch out. The bouncy title tune, though written for Owens by Kontemeniotis and British vocalist Aimua Eghobamien, best showcases the vividly skilled interplay of the Monk for President lads.

48,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/hearingvoices/dara-tucker-from-gospel-roots-to-jazz-expression/,"Dara Tucker CD cover Oklahoman Dara Tucker was barely old enough to speak when she first learned about harmony, teamed with her six siblings and placed in front of a church mic by her minister father. Gospel was the music of choice in the Tucker household, and mama Tucker was a gifted practitioner. But young Dara was also allowed to listen to secular music, developing a fondness for Broadway tunes and the great pop-jazz vocalists-Sinatra, Bennett, Clooney, Cole. Music as a vocation was not, however, anywhere on her radar. At university she majored in International Business and German. Meanwhile, her appreciation of top-flight vocalists broadened to include Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan and her personal favorite, Mel Tormé.

Tucker briefly joined the nine-to-five world as a corporate language trainer, but a study sojourn to Switzerland ignited a new passion: songwriting. Determined to carve a new path as a singer-songwriter, Tucker relocated to Nashville six years ago. Her debut CD, All Right Now, released at the beginning of 2009, cautiously clung to the safety of an all-standards playlist, but revealed a vocalist who blended the soulful creaminess of Nancy Wilson with the sass ‘n’ grit of Dinah Washington. Impressively wide-ranging in its approaches to such vintage material, All Right Now showed Tucker to particularly strong advantage on a steamy, samba-fueled “On the Street Where You Live” and a dark, prowling “What Is This Thing Called Love.”

Now, with the release of Soul Said Yes (Watchman Music), Tucker’s wider craftsmanship is revealed. Standards remain her trump suit, filling half of the album’s dozen tracks. Again the treatments are-excepting a “Pure Imagination” that is a shade too urgently strident, spoiling the delicate tune’s incandescent quality -strikingly original, ranging from the clouded silkiness of “Easy to Love” (where Tucker’s stylistic kinship to Wilson is most startlingly evident) and gentle perplexity of “Body and Soul” (its stark beauty realized by showcasing Tucker against the backdrop of Paul Horton’s solo piano) to the easy-flowing, deeply sensual, propulsion of “Poinciana.”

The balance of the album, six richly varied tracks (four featuring Charlie Hunter on 6- and 7-string guitar), allows Tucker to revisit her gospel roots, explore the work of more contemporary composers and exhibit her own, considerable songwriting skills. Soul master Hamilton Bohannon’s “Save My Soul,” arranged by Tucker and combined with her own “Soul Said Yes,” is transformed into a first-rate, electrified, Sunday-come-to-meeting rhythm fest. Likewise, Mahalia Jackson’s signature “I Will Move On Up a Little Higher,” again arranged by Tucker, is superbly funkified. The quiet majesty of Tracy Chapman’s ode to inner truth, “All You Have Is Your Soul,” is gorgeously realized, with Tucker’s crystalline vocal backed solely by James DaSilva’s acoustic guitar. Sade’s “Stronger Than Pride, expertly re-imagined by bassist Greg Bryant (also the album’s producer), is affectively floated across a hypnotically soulful groove line.

Two Tucker originals complete the playlist. The gently percolated “Partly Cloudy” cleverly examines a one-vibrant relationship that, thanks to hard-won revelation, is growing increasingly dim. Equally fine, and somewhat thematically akin, is “The Space,” a free-floating affirmation of individual strength in the face of false, depersonalizing expectations.

Soul Said Yes and All Right Now are both currently available from Amazon, CD Baby and iTunes.

49,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/hearingvoices/hanjin-the-hong-kong-firecracker/,"Hanjin Discovering the unexpected is always one of the sweet benefits of a jazz festival. But surely no one at this year’s Cape Town fest, where the emphasis is split between African artists and American headliners, expected that one of the highlights would be a cyclonic Singaporean vocalist named Hanjin.

A delightfully animated guy, with charm and personality to burn, the baby-faced 35-year-old has been around the music business all his adult life, carving out a major Hong Kong career as a songwriter (with more than 400 Cantopop songs – a blend of Chinese music and western pop – to his credit), producer, arranger and mixer. Only recently did he add jazz singer to his long list of talents.

With no vocal experience, Hanjin (whose full name is Tan Hanjin, he drops the “Tan” for stage performances and recordings) first tested his singing skills a few years ago when he was invited on stage by his pal, pianist Jason Cheng, to perform a couple of standards. “That gave me the balls to attempt jazz,” he says, “and that was the first time the concept of [doing a] jazz album crossed my mind. Jazz in China is linked with luxury. It’s high class, but actually finding the music is tough.”

To fill the gap, Hanjin recorded Raw Jazz in 2009, an all-standards set, each of the 11 selections recorded in one take, featuring Cheng plus bassist Paul Candelaria and guitarist Skip Moy. Hanjin’s joyfully, loose-limbed style and honey-and-whiskey voice – a potent blend of Chet Baker, Al Jarreau and Sammy Davis Jr. – are ideally suited to his rollicking arrangements of swingers like “Sweet Lorraine,” “Cheek to Cheek,” “Honeysuckle Rose,” and “That Old Black Magic.” But his handling of ballads, including velvety treatments of “Skylark” and “The Nearness of You,” is equally adept. Impressively, he also handles the tricky curves of Jobim’s “Wave,” Corea’s “Spain” and “Moody’s Mood for Love” with fearless aplomb.

The CD’s title is, he says, “translated from the idea that this is jazz in its most primal form.” Much of that primal energy also translates to his stage shows, where the human firecracker bounces and struts with Jagger-like glee.

Even with his high profile within the Hong Kong music world, marketing Raw Jazz has been an uphill challenge. Young fans, who know him for his pop and rap work, aren’t the audience for such bespoke material, and exposure to older jazz fans has been tough to navigate. Broader awareness, thanks to international opportunities like the Cape Town date (where Hanjin easily won a couple thousand new, jazz-savvy devotees) will help, and he’s hoping to soon start work on a sophomore jazz album. In time, he could, and deserves to, be the Eastern answer to British dynamo Jamie Cullum.

A downloadable version of Raw Jazz is currently available from iTunes and Amazon, or you can visit Hanjin’s  website. Also check out this clip from YouTube, where you can see his dandy performance of “Wave” on a Honk Kong music show:

 If cabaret is a dying art form, Jane Krakowski might be just what the doctor ordered. Yes, the plucky blonde who was, once upon a time, the best thing about Ally McBeal and currently reigns as the best thing about 30 Rock is a brilliant comic actress (who, strangely, remains Emmy-less). But, as the occasional 30 Rock snippet reveals, she is also a damn fine singer with a Tony (for her show-stopping performance as Carla in the 2003 revival of Nine) to prove it (clearly the folks who distribute theatre awards are a whole lot savvier than those who hand out TV prizes). Krakowski has also headlined productions, here and abroad, of Guys and Dolls, Grand Hotel, Company and Damn Yankees. She is, in other words, a Broadway baby through and through.

When, last autumn, Krakowski decided to add nightclub appearances to her burgeoning resumé, she could easily have opted to present a straightforward evening of show tunes at, say, the Algonquin’s Oak Room, where the likes of Harry Connick Jr., Diana Krall, Andrea Marcovicci and Michael Feinstein first clicked with Manhattan sophisticates. Instead, Krakowski chose to dive headlong into the classic cabaret pool, and selected Feinstein’s new home – his plush, eponymous boîte at the Regency – to get into the floorshow swim.

As proven by artists as diverse as Julie Wilson and Baby Jane Dexter, being a terrific singer isn’t fodder enough to become a great cabaret performer. You must also be a top-drawer storyteller with quick comic wits. That Krakowski is tailor-fit came as no surprise to the cognoscenti who flocked to Feinstein’s every evening of her too-brief run. Night after night the SRO sign was posted, and dozens of eager fans were turned away at the door. Admittedly, many were there to see Jenna Maroney in the flesh, hoping to witness the character’s dimwitted logic and ingenuous narcissism first-hand. Instead, they were treated to the genuine Krakowski – smart, sexy, charmingly funny and sophisticated in the same chummily intimate way that kept Wilson atop the cabaret roster for more than a half-century.

Fortunately, DRG Records has preserved the live show on CD. Ironically entitled The Laziest Gal In Town, given Krakowski’s tireless energy, it is her debut solo recording. Wisely, throughout much of the 55-minute set, Krakowski draws on such legendary practitioners in the art of audience pleasing as Marlene Dietrich, Carol Channing, Eartha Kitt and Ann-Margret while, with considerable assistance from arranger and music director Michael Kosarin, making each slinky number uniquely her own. Krakowski opens with the title track, taking the smolder of Dietrich’s famously indolent interpretation and turning the heat up several notches. Her “A Little Brains, A Little Talent” mirrors Gwen Verdon’s stage and screen versions, though Krakowski rather effortlessly trumps even the sultry Gwen in the art of devilish seduction. Kitt is twice saluted, first with the playfully suggestive “An Englishman Needs Time” and again with the delectable homage to golddiggery “An Old-Fashioned Girl,” cleverly entwined with Jerome Kern and Johnny Mercer’s “I’m Old Fashioned.”

No true cabaret artist arrives onstage without a pocketful of double entendres, and Krakowski comes fully loaded, harkening back to the glory days of Ethel Waters and Alberta Hunter with Eubie Blake and Andy Razaf’s naughty, bawdy “My Handy Man,” then shimmering through Ann-Margret’s bizarre, post-apocalyptic sex fantasy “Thirteen Men.” And in what may be cabaret’s first commemoration of recreational drugs, she pays double (though unacknowledged) tribute to Ella Fitzgerald by combining the early Ella hits “When I Get Low, I Get High” and “Wacky Dust.”

Cunning as all eleven numbers are, two rise above the others. Krakowski’s “Diamonds Are A Girl’s Best Friend,” sung relatively straight against a delightfully incongruous gangsta backing, is augmented with a rap bridge complete with shout-outs to Gwen Stefani, Giorgio Armani and 30 Rock. Even craftier is a modernization of Rodgers and Hart’s “Zip,” the pair’s brilliant examination of ecdysiast intellect from Pal Joey. With lyrical help from Hairspray co-composers Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman, she shifts the proceedings from burlesque parlor to the high-tech arena, substituting “tweet” for “zip” as she navigates the pop culture landscape to praise or skewer such topical boldfaces as Madonna, Kanye West, Beyoncé, Brangelina, Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes, Jon and Kate Gosselin and President Obama.

Oddly but effectively, Krakowski finishes with a nod to an enduring icon, dipping into the Sesame Street songbook for a rendition of “Rubber Duckie” that is equal parts Marilyn Monroe and Helen Kane.

Alternatively campy, giggly, raucous and mischievous, her invariably lively act is a welcome addition to cabaret’s rich, if fading, legacy. Bravo to Krakowski for not only helping to keep the tradition alive, but for doing so with such pluck and sincerity. Somewhere, surely, Eartha Kitt is purring in appreciation.

51,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/hearingvoices/joanie-sommers-her-generation/,"Joanie Sommers The voice of American youth and vigor is soon to turn 70. Joanie Sommers, who encouraged millions of teenaged baby boomers to “come alive” and take their rightful place within the “Pepsi generation” back in the early 1960s, will enter her eight decade next February. So, it seems high time that Sommers get her due, and for far more than shilling soda.  Back in the day, Sommers had everything going for her: a terrific voice (if you’ve never heard Sommers sing, she sounds uncannily similar to Stacey Kent), a major label (the freshly-minted Warner Brothers Records) backing her, strong TV promotion with guest spots on all the popular variety shows, bookings at topflight night clubs stretching from New York to Vegas and, of course, near-ubiquitous exposure thanks to Pepsi. In the studio, such fine players and arrangers as Neil Hefti, Marty Paich, Shelly Manne, Buddy Collette, Russ Freeman, Bobby Troup, Conte Candoli, Al Caiola, Bucky Pizzarelli and Laurindo Almeida supported her.

So, with so many oars simultaneously pulling in the right direction, why didn’t Sommers star rise higher? Three reasons: She was the victim of bad timing and murky marketing, and fell prey to the ironic curse of a single, iconic hit.  Sommers was born in Buffalo, where her pre-teen rendition of “You’re Cheatin’ Heart” earned her a prize on a local TV station.  She relocated with her family to California at age 14, and was often the student singer at Venice High School sock hops. At 18, she was discovered by Tommy Oliver (who would contribute arrangements to two of her early albums), was signed to Warner and cast for a guest appearance on the studio’s breakout TV hit 77 Sunset Strip, co-starring Edd Byrnes as slang-slinging beatnik Kookie. Sommers recorded two utterly forgettable duets with Byrnes, released as singles after his pairing with Connie Stevens on a bit of absurd teen abstraction called “Kookie, Kookie (Lend Me Your Comb)” became a surprise million-seller.  Neither caused a dent on the charts.

Then, in 1959, Warner execs decided to take a different tack with Sommers. Paich and Oliver were hired to shape an album of standards. The title, Positively the Most! was chosen because “most” rhymed with “Drost” (Sommers’ real name), but the switch to the far more rhythmic “Sommers” occurred before the album’s release. Sommers, still just 18, rose to the occasion with remarkably mature, pop-jazz renditions of both swingers and ballads. Particularly impressive were her dew-soft “Heart and Soul” and a nicely percolated “Too Young for the Blues.” Indeed, the album included only one serious misstep, an unduly histrionic “What’s New.”

Warner continued in the same vein for Sommers’ 1961 follow-up, The Voice of the Sixties. Neil Hefti’s arrangements proved ideally suited to Sommers youthful panache, though it is the most modulated of the album’s twelve tracks, a slow, smoldering “Cherokee,” that proves most enticing. The album also provides the earliest hint of Warner’s desire to hedge their bets by cross-promoting Sommers as a teen sensation in the mold of Connie Francis or Brenda Lee. The track is Rodgers and Hart’s “This Can’t Be Love,” fit to a pop-rock arrangements that surely had the notoriously persnickety Rodgers fuming.

Trading on Sommers’ growing recognition as Pepsi’s peppy spokesgirl, they brought Paich back to fill the first half of 1962’s For Those Who Think Young. Paich arranged six tunes, with the teenage-appropriate “A Lot of Livin’ To Do” from Bye Bye Birdie and a slightly unhinged “Hey, Jealous Lover” served up alongside “Round Midnight” and “Blues In the Night.” The album’s second half, recorded live on campus at Cal State Northridge in the San Fernando Valley and arranged by the more circumspect Bob Florence, returned Sommers to a safe, temperate standards zone, with lovely if tepid treatments of “I Feel A Song Comin’ On,” “I Feel Pretty” and such.

By this point, Warner’s A&R department must surely have recognized that even the biggest names in jazz vocals – Fitzgerald, Vaughan, Clooney, Tormé – were fighting a losing battle for airplay and record sales against the likes of Francis, Neil Sedaka and the myriad Bobbys (Vee, Vinton, Darin, et al.) So the decision was made to re-fit Sommers as an angst-ridden teen queen. She hit paydirt with a spirited ode to high school heartache, the infectiously bouncy “Johnny Get Angry.” The song zoomed to number seven on Billboard and Warner quickly cobbled together an oddly schizophrenic album that interspersed such sugary dross as “Since Randy Moved Away” and “Shake Hands With a Fool” with polished readings of “A Nightingale Sang In Berkley Square” and “I Don’t Want to Walk Without You.”

When none of Sommers’ additional slices of adolescent heartbreak lived up to the promise of “Johnny Get Angry,” it was back to square one. Oliver returned to shape the concept album Let’s Talk About Love, featuring superb renditions of, among others, “Make the Man Love Me” and “Till There Was You.” Sommers, now 21, had grown into a first-rate standards-bearer; yet would forever be tarred as the ponytailed lass desperate for boyfriend Johnny to flex some muscle.

Another concept album, the ’round-the-calendar venture Sommers’ Seasons followed in 1963. Again Sommers demonstrated marvelous dexterity across a twelve-tune playlist that extended from the barren chill of “Early Autumn” to the playful effervescence of “Spring, Spring, Spring.”

As is so often the ironic case, Sommers delivered her finest album (then or since) just as Warner decided to drop her from their roster. Softly, the Brazilian Sound, conceived and conducted by Laurindo Almeida, ranks among the loveliest, most accomplished Latin albums of the day. “Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars,” “Meditation,” “I’ll Remember April,” “Softly, As I Leave You” and “That’s All” are all delivered with exquisite tenderness.

After cutting ties with Warner, Sommers recorded a few singles (including an excellent, if vastly underappreciated, “Alfie”) and one album, the ultra-rare Come Alive! featuring great renditions of “The Shadow of Your Smile” and “Girl Talk,” for Columbia. By 1970, she had removed herself entirely from the music scene, focusing instead on raising her kids. The 1980s saw a brief Sommers resurgence, both as Pepsi booster (this time promoting Diet Pepsi) and as jazz stylist. Two indie albums, Dream and Tangerine revealed that Sommers’ voice had lost none of its warm, slightly hazy appeal, but few were paying attention. 1992’s A Fine Romance, a lovely collection of Jerome Kern tunes, gained a tad more notice, and remains relatively easy to find on CD.

Another decade passed before Sommers’ returned with Here, There and Everywhere and the estimable Sings Bossa Nova, a disc so rare that on the odd occasion a CD copy surfaces on auction sites, the price invariably soars to triple digits.

Sommers continues to perform to this day, and still sounds terrific. Her Warner albums are all available on CD (via a series of Collectors Choice reissues that have remained steadily in print) and on iTunes. She had her blazing moment in the sun, thanks to one iconic hit (and one iconic soft drink), and revealed a vocal deftness that kept her in the public eye for more than half a century. Still, it’s tempting to ponder how much bigger and brighter her career might have been, and how richer vocal fans’ record collections might be, if she’d arrived a decade earlier, or a couple of decades later. She certainly could, and should, have been at least as popular, and as widely respected, as Kent currently is.

If you’ve never taken the time to fully appreciate Sommers, do yourself a favor: buy or download those early albums, all reissued by Collectors Choice and all but one, For Those Who Think Young, still in print. Also check out Look Out! It’s Joanie Sommers, a 20-track collection of tunes, widely available on CD, recorded with Manne’s quintet and Troup’s sextet in 1962 and ’63 for a 15-minute radio program called The Navy Swings. If you have the patience and financial resources, search for the later material too. Wherever you start, you’re in for a delightful treat.

 A dozen years ago, I remember being surprised that the passing of Mel Tormé caused barely a ripple. His departure was newsworthy for a day or two, and there were the requisite obits in the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Washington Post and other noble outlets that still appreciated such seminal, if faded, figures; yet the outpouring seemed pitifully inadequate for one of the greatest jazz vocalists of all time.

But the attention paid to the death of Margaret Whiting, three weeks ago at age 86, made the Tormé trickle seem like a torrent. Granted, Whiting was never as pivotal or prolific a performer as Tormé. Even among the coterie of white songbirds who emerged from the ashes of the big band era as solo stars – Doris Day, Jo Stafford, Peggy Lee, Kay Starr and Dinah Shore – Whiting was the least popular and the least distinctive.

Still, Whiting had a significant impact on the popularization of the Great American Songbook and a decent, even occasionally stellar, career that survived seven decades. The Times, Post and others did, again, rise to the occasion, with solid, if hardly effusive, obits that centered around the same key facts: she was the daughter of popular songwriter Richard Whiting and, after her father’s death, was mentored by Richard’s longtime friend and frequent collaborator Johnny Mercer. When Mercer founded Capitol Records in 1942, Whiting, then age 16, was among the first artists signed to the label, scoring a significant hit with “That Old Black Magic” when teamed, for her debut recording, with Freddie Slack’s orchestra. A long list of chart hits followed, notably “Moonlight In Vermont” (with an uncredited Les Brown), “Far Away Places,” “It Might As Well Be Spring” and, with Mercer, “Baby, It’s Cold Outside.” She also proved popular among country music fans, scoring a string of hit duets with warbler Jimmy Wakely.

Though never as strong a chart performer as Day, Stafford, Lee or Starr, Whiting remained a decent seller of singles straight through the mid-fifties, when she finally parted ways with Capitol. Like her contemporaries, she recorded her fair share of dreck. But there was plenty of cream among the sour milk, including covers of “Guilty,” “Old Devil Moon,” “A Wonderful Guy,” “My Foolish Heart” and “I’ll Walk Alone” that, if not definitive, are unquestionably fine.

Unlike Lee, and to a lesser extent Stafford and Day, Whiting never quite succeeded as an album artist; a significant contributing factor to her comparative obscurity. Between 1950 and 1990 she released a scant 16 albums (not counting Greatest Hits compilations). None were major sellers. Yet there are precious gems among them. Most have, over the years, surfaced on CD, though by the time of Whiting’s departure, few remained in print. (She has fared better on iTunes, where more than half of her album-length output, plus several excellent compilations, is available).

Whiting’s best albums all predate 1962. There were three for Capitol: the stunning EP collection Sings Rodgers and Hart from 1950 (never formally released on CD, though most of the tracks exist on various Capitol collections); 1954’s Love Songs which, though primarily a hits collection, includes terrific renditions of “I’ve Never Been In Love Before” and “He’s Funny That Way;” and 1956’s Songs for the Starry Eyed, conducted by Frank De Vol and featuring “Why Shouldn’t I,” “Like Someone In Love, “I Hadn’t Anyone Till You” and other top-drawer ballads wrapped in distinctly Day-esque arrangements.

In 1957, Whiting moved to Dot and released the underappreciated Goin’ Places, a swinging portfolio of travel-related tunes. Likely because of the popularity of her Wakely duets, Dot next served up a platter of country pop. Simply titled Margaret, the album’s roster of songs is surprisingly excellent, and Whiting is in fine form as she winds her subdued way around “I’m So Lonesome I Could Cry,” “Cold, Cold Heart,” “Your Cheatin’ Heart,” “Anytime” and “Tennessee Waltz.” Whiting’s third and final Dot release, 1960’s Just A Dream is a real rarity. It has never resurfaced in any format.

Toward the end of 1960, Whiting traded up to Verve (at the time, recently purchased by MGM), where she immediately delivered the finest album of her career – the four-sided Sings the Jerome Kern Songbook, conducted by Russ Garcia. Never before or since would Whiting be in better voice – pure, clear and warm throughout – or work with better material or classier arrangements. It helped, of course, that she’d known Kern since childhood and was intimately familiar with her “uncle Jerry’s” entire canon. Whiting’s readings of “Why Was I Born,” “Why Do I Love You,” “All the Things You Are,” “Remind Me,” The Way You Look Tonight” and “You Couldn’t Be Cuter” are among the most dazzling you’ll ever hear. It wouldn’t be a stretch to suggest that her Kern songbook is every bit as superb as the Ella Fitzgerald collection that would follow on Verve three years later.

Also in 1960, Whiting teamed with Verve label-mate Tormé to record a dozen current Broadway tunes. The resultant Broadway Right Now! is not either singer’s finest hour, largely because the material is sub-standard. But there are a handful of notable tracks, particularly Whiting’s solo handling of “Make Someone Happy” and their combined take on “Far Away from Home” and “Angelina” from the Lucille Ball vehicle Wildcat! (Interestingly, their joint version of the show’s rollicking hit, “Hey, Look Me Over” is remarkably lackluster). There was one more Verve album, actually released on the MGM label. Past Midnight again casts Whiting in a Day mold, mixing upbeat numbers like “Sing for Your Supper” and “People Will Say We’re In Love” with such moodier entries as “Twelve Past Midnight” and “Ballad of the Sad Young Men.” Past Midnight isn’t the magnificent achievement that the Kern project is, but is nonetheless distinguished and can rightly be considered that last excellent album of Whiting’s career.

After a long silence, Whiting landed at London Records in 1967 for a trio of mediocre albums that have all, justifiably, been left on the discard pile. Another, longer gap ended in 1980 when, Whiting now established as a respected cabaret performer, she joined Audiophile and added three more albums to her resumé. All are good, if not sparkling, ably showcasing Whiting’s now deeper, darker voice. A final album, for DRG, was released in 1990. A nostalgic revisiting of several early hits, alongside a smattering of contemporary compositions, Then and Now, featuring Gerry Mulligan, it is a fitting adieu to a performer who never quite got her due, yet persevered (longer, in most cases, than her peers) and remained estimable to the very end.

Among the smattering of Whiting obits that did appear a few weeks ago, all committed considerable space to her mentoring by Mercer. Few, however, noted that Whiting herself had served as mentor to, and champion of, dozens of aspiring vocalists throughout the last three decades of her life. Despite her many hits and sustained career, such wholehearted encouragement of emerging talent may well be the biggest contribution Margaret Whiting made to music.

(Note: Among Whiting’s Capitol, Dot and Verve/MGM albums, Love Songs, Songs for the Starry Eyed, Goin’ Places, Margaret and Sings the Jerome Kern Songbook are all currently available on iTunes. Broadway Right Now! with Tormé, and Past Midnight were recently re-released on CD in Japan and are available from Amazon. Among her late-career albums, only Then and Now is listed on iTunes.)

53,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/hearingvoices/marilyn-maye/,"Marilyn Maye By all rights, Marilyn Maye, who burst onto the national scene around the same time as Barbra Streisand, should have had a Streisand-sized career. All the right cues were in place: coast-to-coast exposure on The Steve Allen Show, a recording contract with RCA that resulted in a series of excellent albums, unprecedented support from Johnny Carson (who welcomed Maye as a Tonight Show guest a record 76 times) and a sterling vocal style that prompted no less an authority than Ella Fitzgerald to single her out as “the best white female singer in the world.”

But major stardom wasn’t it the cards. Still, Maye persevered, carving out a solid career in musical theater and on the cabaret circuit. An indefatigable trooper, she’s still going strong at age 83; still headlining the top spots, including a two-week New York run at Feinstein’s at Loews Regency that continues through November 12 (with a return visit to the Manhattan nightspot already booked for next May).

Though Allen is often credited with discovering Maye, by the time he encountered her in the early 1960s she had already amassed more than a quarter-century’s worth of experience. Her story begins in Topeka circa 1939, when first prize in an amateur contest led to weekly radio appearances on WIBW, the top local station. A few years later, following her parents’ divorce and a move to Des Moines, she landed her own weekly show while still in high school and, upon graduation, signed on as staff vocalist at WHAS in Louisville.

After Louisville, Maye struck out on her own, playing clubs throughout the Midwest. A three-week gig at the Colony, a posh Kansas City establishment, turned into an 11-year engagement. During that period, she made her recording debut with the locally produced (and now extremely rare) Marilyn the Most. It was soon afterward that Allen arranged the first of her several appearances on his syndicated late-night show. RCA came knocking, and Meet Marvelous Marilyn Maye was released in 1965.

Featuring top-drawer arrangements by Manny Albam and Don Costa, it offered up a mix of swinging show tunes and soft ballads, including lush renderings of “Misty” and “Where are You,” plus a terrific, high-octane “Take Five.” Six more albums followed through 1970, including The Second of Maye, captured live at Manhattan’s intimate Living Room, and The Lamp is Low, from which her version of “Too Late Now” was subsequently selected for inclusion, alongside tracks by Sinatra, Fitzgerald and Vaughan, in the Smithsonian Institute’s permanent collection of 20th Century recordings.

Another RCA track, the bouncy title number from her 1967 album Step to the Rear, provided Maye with an interesting sideline. It was chosen as the theme for a series of Lincoln commercials that ran for several years, and Maye traveled the country as the carmaker’s radio spokesperson. (To date only two of her RCA releases-Meet Marvelous Marilyn Maye and The Lamp is Low-have found their way onto CD, issued in 2001 as a twofer on the Collectables label and still in print).

After parting company with RCA in 1970, Maye focused on live appearances and turned her attention to musical theatre, starring in productions of Can Can, Hello, Dolly!, Mame and Stephen Sondheim’s Follies. She has remained in constant demand since, though there was a 14-year gap, beginning in 1992, when she was absent from the New York scene. That changed in 2006, with a triumphant return to Lincoln Center as a special guest at the annual Mabel Mercer Cabaret Convention. More recently, she appeared at Carnegie Hall with the New York Pops, performing “I’m Still Here” as part of Stephen Sondheim’s 80th birthday celebration.

Over the past dozen or so years, Maye has also returned to the recording studio, crafting a half-dozen albums, including a collection of tunes she performed on the Tonight Show (featuring Carson’s personal favorite, Johnny Burke and Jimmy Van Heusen’s “Here’s That Rainy Day”), a Ray Charles tribute and a compendium of songs from Hello, Dolly!, in the liner notes of which composer Jerry Herman praised “her extraordinary combination of acting and singing talent.”

These recent recordings (all available from Maye’s website: MarilynMaye.com), and her ongoing club dates, demonstrate an artist still at the very top of her game. The voice is as impressive as ever, suggesting the power of Eydie Gormé and the purity of Doris Day, her repertoire vast and vivid. In the liner notes to her 2000 release Rapport (a stunning set of ballads with pianist Mark Franklin), Gene Lees singled Maye out as “the best singer I ever heard of either gender, in any language, in any style and in any idiom.”

High praise, especially from the author of two books devoted to the great pop and jazz vocalists and a lyricist whose work has been interpreted by Sinatra, Fitzgerald, Carmen McRae, Mel Tormé, Peggy Lee, Tony Bennett and dozens of others. Peter Nero, who has conducted Maye’s appearances with various pop and symphony orchestras, adds that, “She sets the standard for the way any pop, jazz or big band singer would like to sound.” And, in a 2010 review in the Wall Street Journal, Will Friedwald enthused, “Marilyn Maye is pretty much every singer you ever wanted to hear: She has the rhythm and musicianship of a great jazz singer, the projection and personality of heavyweight Broadway diva, and creates the intimate bond with her audiences that we demand from a cabaret artist.”

54,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/hearingvoices/mike-janzen-reimagining-broadway/,"MIke Janzen Jazz and Broadway musicals are often cited as the two most distinctly American musical forms. Their relationship, though, has always been a bit one-sided. Where jazz has only occasionally invaded the Broadway stage, show tunes have long been jazz fodder, dating all the way back to the 1927 Kern/Hammerstein masterpiece Show Boat which, with its landmark integration of book and score, can be considered the grandfather of all subsequent stage musicals. Indeed, it’s safe to assume that the repertoire of every jazz artist, instrumentalist or vocalist, who has traversed the Great American Songbook includes several selections that debuted on the Great White Way.

Among vocalists, all of the usual suspects – Ella, Sarah, Carmen, Sinatra, Bennett, Mel Tormé, Anita O’Day, Mark Murphy, etc. – have dug deep into the Broadway catalog. But some of the most interesting Broadway-oriented vocal albums have come from unexpected sources. One of the best, 2008’s Stage Door Johnny, was recorded by sexagenarian bassist John Miller, whose resumé also includes musical direction of more than six-dozen Broadway and off-Broadway shows. The gruff-voiced, cunningly sardonic Miller delivers remarkably fresh takes on such chestnuts as “Wouldn’t It Be Loverly,” “Ol’ Man River,” “Real Live Girl,” “Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin'” and a half-dozen others. His funky, postmodern reimaging of Peter Pan‘s “I Won’t Grow Up” is alone worth the price of admission, as is his loping rendition of Guys and Dolls‘ “Fugue for Tinhorns.”

Now, Winnipeg-born, Toronto-based pianist and composer Mike Janzen has, with his trio mates (bassist George Koller and drummer Ben Riley), crafted a Broadway salute, Try to Remember, that is equally distinctive and sublime. Like Miller, the decades younger, classically trained Janzen, is only an occasional vocalist whose jazz work represents just one aspect of a multi-faceted music career. In the decade-and-a-half since he graduated from the University of Toronto with a masters in Composition, he has composed and arranged for the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra, contributed to film soundtracks and become deeply involved in spiritual music, performing and recording both classic and original hymns. His 2009 collection of inspirational tracks, Little Trinity Worship Sessions, recorded at Toronto’s historic Little Trinity Anglican Church, represented his first full-length project as vocalist.

But Janzen has also been a lifelong jazz devotee, and has studied with several of the most distinguished Canadian players and instructors. His first recorded foray into jazz, with Koller and Riley, was 2005’s aptly-titled Beginnings, an impressive assortment of mostly original tunes, though it did include one Broadway selection, a feisty treatment of Fiddler on the Roof‘s “If I Were A Rich Man,” and also introduced audiences to Janzen as a jazz singer with his delicate reading of Sting’s “Fragile.” A second trio album, Mombacho, followed in 2008 with even greater focus on original compositions.

Try to Remember was originally conceived when Janzen and his wife were trying to conceive, and was finally realized when the couple welcomed their firstborn, daughter Haddie, into the world. Janzen’s specific goal was to concentrate on Broadway tunes (three of which are actually from film and TV musicals) that, directly or indirectly, celebrated children. He opens with the only song that overlaps Miller’s album, a loose, joyous “Oh, What a Beautiful Morning,” then reshapes Mary Poppins‘s sprightly “Chim Chim Che-ree” as a twilit exploration of shadowy delights. Like Miller, there’s a smoky huskiness to Janzen’s voice that arrestingly tempers such inherently sunny material. Oliver!‘s “Consider Yourself” is superbly handled with angular jauntiness, as is “If I Only Had a Brain.”

There are two selections from the child-focused musical Annie. “Maybe” is one of the album’s three instrumental tracks and, as such, is stripped of its syrupiness and handled with enchanting elegance. “NYC,” originally sung by a father figure (Daddy Warbucks) to his wide-eyed ward (Annie) as a celebration of her exciting new habitat, is a clever fit with Janzen’s theme of welcoming home a newborn. More directly apropos is Les Miserables‘ “Bring Him Home,” which Janzen strips of its overblown theatricality and transforms into a gentle lullaby.

The title track from The Fantasticks seems a somewhat odd fit, with its backwards-glancing wistfulness, though Janzen’s take is masterfully rendered. The remainder of the album includes three of finest love songs ever to emerge from musical scores. Janzen takes a breezy stroll through Guys and Dolls‘ rapturous ode to freshly minted passion, “I’ve Never Been In Love Before,” and provides West Side Story‘s towering “Somewhere,” the album’s second instrumental track, precisely the august tenderness it demands. Most stunning though, is the third of the instrumental tracks, a richly imaginative rendition of Rodgers and Hammerstein’s “Do I Love You (Because You’re Beautiful” (from TV’s Cinderella) that, in contrast to the dewiness of most previous versions, is wonderfully jubilant.

55,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/hearingvoices/movie-songs-random-pre-oscar-musings/,"Dooley Wilson, Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman in Casablanca It’s countdown-to-Oscar week and, as become the norm in recent years, the 2010 Best Song nominees are stupefyingly underwhelming. So lean are the musical pickings that there are only four nominees. If I had a vote, it would have to go to “We Belong Together,” simply because I recognize (and admire) its author, Randy Newman, and Toy Story 3 is the only one of the four films in this category I’ve seen.

Rather than ponder which tune from a so-so slate will take home the gold (or if, as is the likeliest scenario, Newman cops his second trophy), I thought it would be more fun to tally up 10 tuneful facts from the entire span of Hollywood history.

1. Best song to lose at the Academy Awards
Though the first Oscars were given out in 1929, the Best Song category wasn’t added until 1937. Nominees that year included Harry Warren, Al Dubin, Sammy Fain, Lew Brown and Leo Robin. But the obvious frontrunner was George and Ira Gershwin’s stellar “They Can’t Take That Away from Me” from the Fred Astaire/Ginger Rogers musical Shall We Dance. Shockingly, the prize instead went to Harry Owens for “Sweet Leilani” from Waikiki Wedding.

2. Best song from a really bad movie
There’s plenty of competition, but the hands-down winner must be Johnny Mandel and Paul Francis Webster’s hauntingly beautiful “The Shadow of Your Smile” from the 1966 Elizabeth Taylor/Richard Burton travesty The Sandpiper. Fortunately, the Academy were clever enough to recognize the song as the film’s only real asset and honored it with the Oscar. It bested, among others, Michel Legrand’s equally lovely “I Will Wait for You” and Burt Bacharach and Hal David’s “What’s New Pussycat?”

3. Best song cut from the movie it was written for
Michel Legrand was commissioned to write the score for the 1971 coming-of-age drama Summer of ’42. He asked his pals, and frequent collaborators, Alan and Marilyn Bergman to write the lyrics for the main theme. They delivered “The Summer Knows,” one of the most gorgeous tunes in the Bergman canon. The song was intended to play over the closing credits. But director Robert Mulligan opted to end the film with a different Legrand piece. The Bergmans’ lyric was never heard on screen, and only a snippet of Legrand’s accompanying music was heard. Fortunately, “The Summer Knows” went on to become one of the most durable of modern standards.

4. Best lyric added after a film’s release
David Raksin composed the main theme for the classic 1944 film noir Laura, directed by Otto Preminger. But it wasn’t until 1945, well after the film’s release and its massively successful run, that Johnny Mercer was asked to create an accompanying lyric. The result, simply entitled “Laura,” became, during Raksin’s lifetime, the second most frequently recorded song after Hoagy Carmichael’s “Stardust.”

5. Best Cole Porter movie song to clock in at under one minute
In the 1949 battle-of-the-sexes comedy Adam’s Rib, arguably the best of the many Katharine Hepburn/Spencer Tracy screen unions, Hepburn and Tracy portray married lawyers Adam and Amanda Bonner, representing opposite sides in a headline-grabbing, attempted murder case. The Bonner’s next-door neighbor is bon vivant songwriter Kip Lurie (David Wayne), who is infatuated with Amanda. At one point, Kip serenades Amanda with a tune he’s written especially for her. But only a sliver of the kitschy “Farewell, Amanda,” words and music by Porter, is actually performed. Later in the film, another snippet from the song is heard on the radio, and the singer is obviously, if uncredited, Frank Sinatra.

6. Most obscure Sinatra appearance on a film’s soundtrack
In 1964, director Richard Quine reteamed Sabrina costars William Holden and Audrey Hepburn for the soggy comedy Paris When It Sizzles, or as it has become more commonly known since its egg-laying debut, Paris When It Fizzles. The silly Parisian storyline involves a playboy screenwriter (Holden) and the secretary (Hepburn) who comes to his rescue as he tries to concoct a storyline for a film with the working title The Girl Who Stole the Eiffel Tower. A single line (actually, just the title) from the would-be film-within-a-film’s musical theme is heard in one scene. The one-line lyric was credited to Quine, Nelson Riddle composed the music, and the cameo voice was Frank Sinatra’s. (The soundtrack for Paris When It Sizzles also features Fred Astaire’s recording of “That Face,” an obviously playful reference to the earlier, Paris-set romantic comedy Funny Face that had paired Hepburn with Astaire).

7. Most iconic movie song that didn’t qualify for Oscar consideration
Ever since the 1942 release of Casablanca, Dooley Wilson’s tender version of “As Time Goes By” has stood out as one of the film’s most memorable moments. Indeed, in 2004, the American Film Institute cited Wilson’s rendition as the second greatest onscreen song performance of all time (nosed out of the top spot by Judy Garland’s “Over the Rainbow” in The Wizard of Oz). But “As Time Goes By” couldn’t be included among 1942’s ten Best Song nominees because it wasn’t written for the film. The tune, words and music by Herman Hupfeld, was actually penned eleven years earlier for the Broadway musical Everybody’s Welcome. So, though Casablanca was named the year’s Best Film, and director Michael Curtiz and screenwriters Howard Koch and Julian and Philip Epstein were also winners, the Best Song prize was awarded to Harry Warren and Mack Gordon’s “You’ll Never Know” from Hello, Frisco, Hello.

8. Best movie song co-written by a teenager
Johnny Mandel wrote the main theme for 1970’s M*A*S*H. The same theme was again used when M*A*S*H was adapted for TV in 1972. For one of the movie’s pivotal scenes, the staged suicide of dentist Walter Koskiusko (John Schuck), Mandel required a lyric for the song. That lyric, which earned the song the oft-cited subtitle “Suicide Is Painless,” was written by Mike Altman, the 14-year-old son of the film’s director, Robert Altman.

9. Best song from a film you’ve likely never seen
Though it garnered a Best Actress nod for Jean Simmons, who contributed a stellar performance as the dissatisfied wife in a stagnating marriage, 1969’s The Happy Ending failed to ignite the box office and has flown largely under the radar ever since. (It surfaced briefly on VHS several years ago, but has never been issued on DVD). In addition to Simmons’ performance and the equally strong presence of Bobby Darin in a small supporting role, one of the film’s highlights is the twice-featured song “What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?,” music by Michel Legrand with lyrics by Alan and Marilyn Bergman. The song did receive an Oscar nomination, but lost to Burt Bacharach and Hal David’s über-popular “Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head” from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.

10. The “no contest” Oscar contest
The year 1939 is widely acknowledged as one of the greatest in movie history. But the year that produced Gone With the Wind, Ninotchka, Dark Victory, Stagecoach, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, Gunga Din, Wuthering Heights and The Hunchback of Notre Dame wasn’t a great one for songs. Only four tunes made the final Oscar ballot, with “Over the Rainbow” facing off against a trio of lackluster competitors: “Faithful Forever” from Gulliver’s Travels, Irving Berlin’s “I Poured My Heart Into a Song” from Second Fiddle and, best of the three, Buddy De Sylva’s “Wishing” from Love Affair. That “Over the Rainbow” would win was a foregone conclusion (even though MGM executives had originally wanted to cut the song, arguing that it slowed down the film.) The Oscar race might, however, have been tighter if Burton Lane and Frank Loesser’s wonderful “The Lady’s In Love with You” from Some Like It Hot (the ’39 Bob Hope musical, not to be confused with the 1959 Billy Wilder cross-dressing comedy of the same name) had gotten the nomination it deserved.

 May 26 would have been Peggy Lee’s 91st birthday. Not a major milestone, but significant enough, it seems, to prompt a small flood of digital releases from Capitol, Lee’s musical home for about half of her five-decade career.

After departing the Benny Goodman Orchestra, Lee signed with the then-fledgling label in 1944 and quickly scored with such self-penned hits as “I Don’t Know Enough About You” and “It’s a Good Day.” She remained a steady hit-maker for Capitol through 1952, just as the LP era was dawning. That year, Gordon Jenkins presented her with a dramatic arrangement of the Rodgers and Hart ballad “Lover.” Lee adored the bold treatment, complete with wildly swirling strings and pounding tempo; and, when the folks at Capitol refused to let her record it, she departed for Decca. “Lover,” with all the thunder and lighting intact, became a landmark hit.  At Decca, Lee waded into the long-playing world with a trio of top-drawer releases, beginning with the classic Black Coffee (issued first as a 10″, then expanded to a 12″), Dream Street and Miss Wonderful. Also at Decca, the first glimpses of Lee’s penchant for otherworldly themes emerged with the release of the high-concept Sea Shells, beautifully realized but commercially limited.

It was, however, with her return to Capitol in 1957, that Lee fully emerged as an album-oriented artist. During the course of her 16-year reconnection with the label, she averaged two releases per year, for a total of 32 albums. Twenty-one of them are included in the recent digital deluge, along with one rare (though previous released) session.

At first glance, it seems a rather scattershot assortment. The latter portion of Lee’s second Capitol phase is covered in its near entirety, covering 15 of the 16 albums she released between 1963’s I’m A Woman and 1972’s contract-concluding Norma Deloris Egstrom from Jamestown, North Dakota. All that’s missing is 1968’s infamous Two Shows Nightly, the live album, recorded at the Copa (though, like all of Lee’s purported “live” recordings, significantly sweetened in the studio), that she insisted be pulled from circulation just days after its release because she wasn’t satisfied with the sound quality. It is, however, a reasonable omission, since the album finally surfaced on CD (and through all the major digital providers) in 2009, complete with a dozen hard-to-find bonus tracks.

The early part of Lee’s Capitol return is less well covered. Only five of the 16 albums she released between 1957 and 1963 are among the digital re-releases, and some of her best, including 1959’s Things Are Swingin’, 1963’s Mink Jazz and the like-minded Latin à la Lee and Olé à la Lee, both from 1960, have been left out of the mix. Again, though, the exclusions make sense, since all but one of the 11 omitted albums were already available through iTunes and other digital sources.

In chronological order, the 21 new digital releases include:

1. I Like Men! (1959), Lee’s lively salute to the male of the species, arranged and conducted by Jack Marshall. Highlights include her sunny reading of “It’s So Nice to Have a Man Around the House,” the bouncy “I Love to Love” and a poignant reading of “When a Woman Loves a Man.”

2. Beauty and the Beat (1959) showcases Lee’s delightful pairing with George Shearing for a performance at the Miami Disc Jockey Convention (and, yes, heavily sweetened in studio after the fact). Lee and Shearing, who only recorded together this one time though both were under contract to Capitol, are wonderfully simpatico, particularly on their saucy versions of “You Came A Long Way from St. Louis” and “Always True to You In My Fashion.”

3. All Aglow Again! (1960) is the first of three compilations Capitol released during the 1960s. Since Lee’s massive 1958 hit “Fever” had only been released as a single, Capitol were eager to build an album around it, so dug into the vaults for an odd mixture of 1940s tracks like “Mañana” and various singles and unreleased tracks from the late ’50s.

4. Basin Street East Proudly Presents Peggy Lee (1961). Under the direction of Joe Harnell, Lee serves up a terrific set of recent hits, show tunes and Tin Pan Alley favorites. She is in great form throughout, charming and kittenish. The 21st of the new digital releases is an alternate version (Peggy Lee at Basin Street: The Unreleased Show, released on CD in 2002) that captures Lee’s closing night performance. It is one of the few true recordings of a Lee club date because, since it was never intended for commercial release, it has not been tidied or otherwise tampered with. In Lee’s opening number, “Day In, Day Out” you can hear her come in a couple of bars early, stop and then start again. Various other minor flaws are equally evident. Also, the playlist is substantially different from the “official” Basin Street East release.

5. If You Go (1961) marks Lee’s first session with Quincy Jones. It is a lovely, subdued set that includes stellar readings of “As Time Goes By,” “Here’s That Rainy Day” and “I’m Gonna Laugh You Right Out of My Life.”

6. Bewitching-Lee (1962) is another compilation that borrows heavily from Lee’s 1940s Capitol hits (“Why Don’t You Do Right,” “Golden Earrings, “I Don’t Know Enough About You” and, once more, “Mañana”), and again includes “Fever. “

7. I’m A Woman (1963) is worth the price of admission solely for Lee’s sassy treatment of the Lieber and Stoller title track, but also features her slinky reading of “The Alley Cat Song” and first-rate renditions of “A Taste of Honey,” “One Note Samba” and “I Left My Heart In San Francisco.”

8. In Love Again! (1964) blends several terrific swingers – “A Lot of Livin’ to Do,” “I’ve Got Your Number” – with such masterfully handled ballads as “I Got Lost In His Arms” and Jobim’s “How Insensitive.”

9. In the Name of Love (1964), conducted by Lou Levy, includes some of Lee’s standout 1960s tracks, including a delectable “The Boy from Ipanema,” a masterfully sly “Talk to Me Baby” and what may be the definite version of Cy Coleman and Carolyn Leigh’s delightful “When In Rome.”

10. Pass Me By (1965), is best remembered as the album in which Lee embraced both the rock era, covering Lennon and McCartney’s “A Hard Day’s Night,” and pop culture, with “Bewitched” (the TV sitcom theme, not the Rodgers and Hart masterpiece). But she also delivers an enchanting interpretation of Jobim’s “Corcovado” and a finger-snappin’ treatment of the title track, from Father Goose, the second-to-last film starring her great friend, Cary Grant.

11. That Was Then And Now Is Now (1965) is a varied assemblage of tracks, conducted by Sid Feller, that extends from haunting readings of “The Shadow of Your Smile” and “(I’m Afraid) The Masquerade Is Over” to a less-than-effective cover of Willie Dixon’s down ‘n’ dirty “Seventh Son.”

12. Guitars à la Lee (1966). Again, a rather schizophrenic assortment, with the lilting “Sweet Happy Life” and such modern-day standards as “Nice ‘n’ Easy” and “Strangers In the Night” standing shoulder-to-shoulder with “Mohair Sam.” Best of the 11 tracks is Lee’s soft-swingin’ handling of Tony Hatch’s “Call Me.”

13. Big Spender (1966). Arguably Lee’s mid-decade best, with a great, heavily caffeinated reading of “Come Back to Me,” tender treatments of “I’ll Only Miss Him When I Think of Him” and Legrand’s “Watch What Happens” and raise-the-roof renditions of the title track and “Alright, Okay, You Win.”

14. Extra Special! (1967) isn’t that special. Just a mishmash of selections from previous albums and a few unreleased tracks.

15. Somethin’ Groovy (1967). Title notwithstanding, it’s hardly the grooviest of LPs, but there are several excellent tracks, including Lee’s wistful take on Mancini’s “Two for the Road” and, plucked from her mid-’50s screen success Pete Kelly’s Blues (for which she earned an Oscar nomination), the sweet “Sing A Rainbow.”

16. A Natural Woman (1969). Like so many of her contemporaries, Lee was experiencing a downturn in record sales amid an increasingly teen-oriented music market. Adopting an if-you-can’t-beat-em-join-em, she dives headlong in the current pop-rock pool, covering everyone from Otis Redding (“Sittin’ on the Dock of the Bay”) to Blood, Sweat and Tears (an ill-advised “Spinning Wheel”). She does, however, leave room for a heart-rending “Don’t Explain” and a singularly fine reading of Randy Newman’s “I Think It’s Going to Rain Today.”

17. Is That All There Is? (1969). The Lieber-Stoller title track proved one of the year’s most unexpected hits, returning Lee to the upper reaches of the hit parade for the first time in ages. The album built around the song is a bit haphazard, extending from the sublime (“Don’t Smoke In Bed”) to the ridiculous (Neil Diamond’s “Brother Love’s Travelling Salvation Show”).

18. Bridge Over Troubled Water (1970). Paul Simon’s delicate title tune is ideal Lee material, and she handles it expertly. She also delivers fine treatments of such varied selections as “The Thrill Is Gone,” Bacharach and David’s “Always Something There to Remind Me” and Newman’s “Have You Seen My Baby?” The world probably could, however, have lived without her cover of “Raindrops Keep Fallin’ On My Head.”

19. Make It With You (1970), the limpid Bread title track notwithstanding, Lee serves up some choice (and rarely covered) tunes, including Lew Spence’s “I’ve Never Been So Happy In My Life,” Paul Anka’s “That’s What Living’s About” and Neil Sedaka’s underappreciated “One More Ride on the Merry-Go-Round.”

20. Where Did They Go? (1971) includes the good (Joe Raposo’s peppy “Sing,” Stephen Sondheim’s “Losing My Mind), the unexpected (delicate treatments of George Harrison’s “My Sweet Lord” and Kris Kristofferson’s “Help Me Make It Through the Night” and the unnecessary (Andrew Lloyd Weber’s “I Don’t Know How to Love Him”).

21. “Norma Deloris Egstrom from Jamestown, North Dakota) (1972). A truly bizarre mix of tunes, with Leon Russell’s “Superstar” alongside Harry Warren and Mack Gordon’s “The More I See You.” Sadly, a rather lackluster adieu, though Lee does cleverly conclude her Capitol years with a hushed “I’ll Be Seeing You.”

Remarkably, given the breath and depth of existing and new Capitol material on disc and online, there remains one elusive Lee album. It is 1961’s Blues Cross Country. Briefly available on CD in 1999, it has long sing been out of print and is currently unavailable in any format. (Used copies of the CD, on the rare occasion they surface, tend to sell for upwards of $100). It was Lee’s second union with Quincy Jones and provides, as the title promises, a coast-to-coast musical tour that travels from “New York City Blues” to “Los Angeles Blues,” with stops along the way for “Goin’ to Chicago Blues,” “Kansas City,” “St. Louis Blues” and “I Lost My Sugar (In Salt Lake City”).
Given the quality of the material and Jones’ wailing big band arrangements, it seems a strange oversight. Maybe, though, the folks at Capitol felt they had to keep something in reserve for Lee’s 92nd.

57,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/independentear/fab-5-freddy-a-jazz-upbringing-at-the-roots-of-hip-hop/,"Fab 5 Freddy Back in the early 80s, when hip hop was in its nascent stage, a young man who grew up in Brooklyn-definitely one of the root beds of the form-named Fred Brathwaite, Jr. was making his moves on that cutting edge. Originally an aspiring graffiti artist, young Fred immersed himself in those early experiments, basement-rapping with an aspiring DJ friend in the rawest sense of what became hip hop.

According to Freddy Brathwaite’s Wikipedia entry: “As a teen in the ’70s he was a member of the Brooklyn-based graffiti group The Fabulous 5. He got his name for consistent graffiti “bombing” of the number 5 train on the IRT [subway line]. In the late 1970s and early 1980s he was an unofficial bridge between the uptown graffiti and early rap scene and the downtown art and punk music scenes.”

Eventually Freddy Brathwaite made some pioneering moves that elevated what was originally designated rap music, then morphed into a global form of its own known as hip hop. But long before that he’d come under the spell of jazz music, a form which was never far below the surface of his music consciousness as rap music was blossoming and coming into its own.
Freddy grew up in Brooklyn’s fabled Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood in a household where jazz music was king. And besides the influence of jazz platters constantly spinning on his mom and dad’s turntable and wafting out of home radios, young Fred’s godfather was none other than than the great drum pioneer Max Roach.

During the course of our many interviews for his autobiography African Rhythms on his growing up in Brooklyn and all the people who influenced him in the borough-musicians and lay people alike-Randy Weston often spoke of Freddy’s dad, Fred Brathwaite, Sr., Max Roach, sculptor Jimmy Gittins, and jazz enthusiast-photographer Jimmy Morton. And Randy mentioned on several occasions that one of the younger keepers of that legacy, one who had collected many of Jimmy Morton’s Brooklyn jazzlore photographs, and one who as a youngster had really paid attention to the influence of jazz music around his home and neighborhood was, as Weston characterized him “the rapper, Fab Five Freddy.”

About 18 months ago when I was blessed by the Weeksville Heritage Center with the opportunity to conduct oral history interviews with Brooklynites-interviews which for The Independent Ear have yielded priceless insights into such Brooklyn venues as the East and the current successor Sista’s Place (scroll through the archives contents) – interviews largely focused on the borough’s rich tradition of jazz venues, clearly I had to catch up with Fab Five Freddy. What follows is part one of excerpts from our interview with the loquacious brother with a keen memory. One gorgeous fall afternoon we caught up with Fab at his Lower Manhattan studio.
 Willard Jenkins: Since your father was so heavily involved in jazz, what’s your earliest recollections of jazz music?

Fab Five Freddy:  My earliest recollections were [of] jazz being played all the time in the house, along with fiery discussions about everything affecting us as a people. I’ve got vivid memories of jazz being played in the house going way, way back. The jazz station that I can recall was WRVR with Ed Beach, who was a hipster with a massive collection of the music. I remember as a young kid wondering how they could know who a guy was just by the instrument that was playing! I would later learn to do that myself.

My dad and Max Roach were friends from teen years at [Brookyn] Boys High School. Max played in drum & bugle corps as a kid and then he became this young whiz kid drummer playing with big bands. He quickly rose in the 40s to be one of the architects, and my dad was right along with him. There was a group of friends who had formed a social group that referred to itself as The Chessmen; they developed a love of chess during World War ll.

Max lived in a big, kind of old mansion at 212 Gates Avenue. This house, I understand, had a huge living room and a huge baby grand piano and they would have these sets. As Max became prominent he would bring other Brooklyn jazz guys to come and hang with my dad and his friends. Hence that became a scene of jazz hipsters and frontrunners in Brooklyn.

(Writer’s note: Read about those days from Randy Weston’s perspective in Chapters 2 and 4 in African Rhythms, and also in Robin D.G. Kelley’s extraordinary Thelonious Monk bio An American Original, about Monk’s days performing in Brooklyn when loss of his cabaret card prohibited his playing Manhattan clubs.)

Was it your sense that this group of guys, the Chessmen, was hanging in clubs in Brooklyn? 

Yeah…there was the Putnam Central, which I heard a lot about. Along with having these gatherings-sets as they called them-at the house on Gates Avenue there was a period of time where my dad and his friends were promoting their own [jazz performances] at this place called Tony’s Grand Dean, which was on Grand and Dean Streets in Brooklyn. I’ve got a series of photos [from Jimmy Morton’s collection] which I let Robin Kelley use for his Thelonious Monk book which document that scene.

The interesting thing about these pictures [displays one with Monk, Mingus, Miles, and Max on the bandstand in Brooklyn]-[they were] in color, one of the first 35mm slide cameras, the beginning of that technology, and Jimmy Morton had one. It’s very rare to see color shots of jazz guys from the early 50s, everything is always in black & white. These slides that Jimmy has given me over the last 20 years document this scene. I’ve heard stories about countless times when the vibe would hit the right pitch at our house and the music was right, my dad and his friends would always go back to things that happened at Tony’s. It was always exciting to hear these guys get real geeked up talking about what happened and I would often be a little kid playing in the room with my toys and things, but would tune in to these stories.

During a critical period for Monk when they had taken away his cabaret license, which as you know was his ability and legal right to play in clubs… he couldn’t feed his family. So these particular gigs [primarily at Tony’s] were gigs that helped keep Monk alive. Robin even found a little ad in the Amsterdam News archives of one of those gigs at Tony’s that Jimmy Morton blew up and I framed.

You talked about those sessions the Chessmen used to have at Max’s house on Gates Avenue; what were they like? 

That was more like jam sessions. The musicians would come and play and it was just like a scene. The thing that was infectious to me was the enthusiasm and the energy they would have when they would get into those conversations. Jimmy Gittins, who I would say was such a huge influence on me and what I even do now, was like a big brother/uncle to me. It was Jimmy Gittins, Lefty Morris, my dad, and [drummer] Willie Jones. Willie was always there, and Willie was an activist. He was at my house three days of every week until I was an early teenager; he was like a fixture at my house, along with at least three other [jazz] guys.

At what point did you become more conscious of what they were about? 

I was always conscious; as a little boy I was aware of these things and I would hear these tapes, but I was pretty much still a kid playng with army men and stuff that kids would do. I’m a kid with all my issues being taken care of by my parents, so I didn’t get to experience what they knew as black men you had to experience at that time. Especially when musicians went on the road and how they had to live, the situations these young, intelligent men were forced to deal with when they went out into these different environments and were very actively concerned with making change. I’m saying all that to say that I also realized later in life that my dad was a big part of Max [Roach]’s consciousness and awareness at that time.

How so? 

You hear it in [Max’s] music. It was all further explained to me when I grew up and as an adult Max would explain things to me himself. One of my earliest remembrances of a Max Roach record is the “Freedom Now” suite, “We Insist” – that record. One of those records has a photo on the cover of Max and some men sitting at a lunch counter, and as a very small boy I always wanted to know what this was about. My dad and them would explain this to me. I destroyed a lot of my parents’ records as a kid playing with them, but the images on those records… there was great photography at that time, abstract art, etc. I would later see records and I’d be like “Oh my God’!…

My mother had all the jazz singers-Sarah Vaughan, Nancy Wilson, etc., ec. and my dad had a nice collection of a lot of the bebop records and they would listen to them both. But my mother was always into the singers. My mother hung out a little bit with Dinah Washington, she hung out a little bit with Etta Jones, and I remember the imagery from those records. So if I see them now I’m like “Oh my God, I’ve seen this, I know this…”

I have a little collection of photos and I think I was developing my visual sense at that time through looking at and playing with these records, but particularly the “Freedom Now” suite. As I grew up and got to understand a little bit more about Max I realized that was one of the first protest records; the beginning of the 60s, the beginning of anti-war protests, the whole cultural revolution that transpired at that time. I realize that Max was at the forefront, and my dad’s influence [was important], because when they came to my house my dad pretty much held court. He had read the complete works of Mao, Marx, and Lenin-all this stuff.

You say that your dad had an influence on Max Roach as far as his political consciousness. Explain that. 

My dad had read all the works of Mao, Marx, Lenin and also African nationalists; my dad wanted my middle name to be Lumumba but my mother wasn’t going for it [laughs]. But later I learned who Lumumba was and how incredible these guys were and how a lot of my dad’s ideas were right in terms of alternatives that were much more viable – whether they worked or not in other countries – 30 or 40 years later we can see that those things didn’t pan out as well as they were sketched out in those books… But that’s what went on at my house. These guys would roll up and do their thing, listen to music, and have these intense discussions and debates. Often my dad would have the most insight because he had read the most and had this kind of broader understanding of what was going on in Africa, what was going on in China… as all these African countries were getting their independence.

What’s your recollection of how the music interacted and spurred some of that discussion, because the music was obviously more than a soundtrack for those discussions? 

Yes, absolutely! My dad’s den/study was in the basement where the real shit would go down. Thelonious Monk… as I’m growing and becoming a young teen I’m beginning to now discern who the musicians are that I like, that I’ve been hearing forever and ever. Monk becomes that musician; I became fascinated about this whole thing with Thelonious. One day I looked in my father’s phone book and I saw Thelonious’ phone number, and I call his house and I speak to Nellie [Monk, Thelonious’ wife].

How old were you at the time? 

Twelve, maybe a little younger. Remember, I’m still kinda little boyish because when I look back to that I think ‘God, that’s such a kid thing to do!’ She could tell it was a little boy calling and I said ‘hi, I’m Freddy Brathwaite’s son and I want to talk to Monk, I know my dad knows you.’ She was really sweet and I started talking to her and I guess I was telling her that Monk was a musician that I really liked and in the course of discussing that she said, “you know Freddie, jazz is like a conversation, and in the beginning of the conversation somebody makes a point and then they go on to explain that point.”

I’d been listening to this music all the time and from that I now get what’s going on: the song starts off, the theme is stated, and then these guys all go off and do their own interpretation and you could still hear the theme going through there, like that’s the point. And I get it now, this became really apparent to me and I was like ‘wow, yes…’ and now when I’m hearing songs I could understand them and see how different guys do their thing as they get into the improvisation and all that stuff. But I guess I also began to understand that the guys making this music were really intelligent and they were really aware of their times, so the music was a reflection of this, therefore the music was an articulation of the intelligence and point of view of these very sophisticated and modern musicians.

I knew that Max and my dad were in synch with a lot of the same thoughts, and then once I got older I figured out a lot of these things for myself. You just realize that these are very intelligent men and they’re very concerned. I’m not trying to say that all jazz music had this protest, let’s make revolution thing but it clearly was an affirmation of us as these modern individuals, which I guess is the thing that had the most impact on me because I always saw them in that light. Those conversations that went on, I realize that these particular individuals had a lot of conversations like this.

I remember later, when I became a young man and spent a lot of time with Max and things that we would do together. I remember Max telling me how when Olatunji first came over [from Nigeria] how he and Dizzy were so excited about this new thing going on. And I remember Max explaining this to me because Max was a very big, early supporter of me being involved in hip hop music and culture. So Max essentially instigated us having gigs together.

 In part 1 of our lively conversation with Fab 5 Freddy, the graffiti artist who was one of the pioneers of what has become the global pop phenomenon known as hip hop, we discussed the heavy jazz influence on young Fred’s Brooklyn upbringing, which included the significant influence of his godfather NEA Jazz Master Max Roach. One course correction: the crib Fab described in part 1 as Max Roach’s home on Gates Avenue, where Max, his dad Freddy Brathwaite, Sr. and other Brooklyn jazz heads, chess players and advanced thinkers would gather for their jazz “sets” was actually rented by Fab’s dad and several members of his crew as a kind of hipster’s clubhouse. “It was not Max’s but he was surely there often,” Fab corrected. “It was known as and always referred to as 212 Gates Avenue.” In part 2 we explore the continuing influence of Max Roach and his encouragement of Fab’s early forays into what was then known as “rap” music and has become the broader global phenomenon known as hip hop.

*****

Willard Jenkins: Is it safe to say that some of Max’s early consciousness of what was going on in early hip hop culture came from you?

Fab:  Oh yeah. One day Max came to visit my dad and asked what I’m into and my dad said ‘oh, he’s into some rapping thing.’ This was before [hip hop] blew up, this was the early 80s when we were having street block parties and what not [in Brooklyn]. I was already making my moves on the arts scene and I was never trying to be a rapper but I had a few rhymes that I could get on the mic at a block party and do my thing. There was a DJ across the street who had built a nice system in his crib so I would go over there and rap a little bit. So my dad was aware of this, unbeknownst to me; my father was never into much contemporary music-with the exception of James Brown.

So one day I came home and my father said Max had been there and “I told him you’ve been doing this rap thing with your man across the street…” Right away I get kind of nervous because I never at that point considered anything music with the developing rap scene. I knew we weren’t playing instruments, we were making sounds and we were energetic and I knew this was a new thing that I dived into full speed ahead, but I didn’t consider it music-as in musicians. My father said ‘Max wants to check it out’, so I said OK. So we arranged a time a week or two later and he came through, on my block on Hancock Street between Lewis and Sumner [Brooklyn]-which is now Marcus Garvey Blvd… which is very appropriate.

I prepped my DJ and we worked out a little routine. Once again the music is not formulated – the four-minute rap song is not developed, it’s just an in the streets equivalent to just jamming, no real structure. Max comes by and I’m rhyming and my DJ is cutting up, he’s scratching… Max just peeped it. We did a little 20-minute thing and when we’re walking back to the house I’m thinking ‘what the hell is Max gonna think of this shit?’ Max said “Let me tell you guys something, that shit that you and your man were doing was as incredible as anything that me, Bird, Dizzy and any of us were doing…’ I’m thinking to myself [skeptically], ‘that’s so nice, trying to placate a young teenager…’ But that’s how Max was, always very encouraging, but I’m thinking to myself ‘yeah, right…’ Because I’m not seeing this as music, this hip hop thing…

“Rapper’s Delight” was probably out as a big record at that point, nothing really breaking crazy like it is now. It wasn’t long after that through me now making moves on the art scene and people knowing that I’m doing my thing on the downtown scene in New York, graffiti, introducing people to the beginnings of this hip hop culture, that a guy who promotes a lot of things with performance artists says ‘man, I found out that Max Roach is your godfather… We were talking with him about his M’Boom group…’ And he says, ‘man I feel like why don’t you do something with Max together…’ And I’m like thinking ‘huh, how the hell…?’ Next thing I knew Max says “yeah, let’s do it…” So then I started to have these conversations with Max, and Max says “yeah, you’re in charge, put this stuff together…”

This is the kind of enthusiasm he had and how eager they were to check out something new, which is the point Max made to me. He explained how Bird and the guys were about checking out new things, about how when Olatunji came around and they all jumped into the African thing and they were the first [generation] to take African names. He was saying this also to explain how a lot of cats wanted him to continue playing the stuff that they architected back in the 40s and 50s, but Max was always saying ‘I’m always about checking out that new thing…’ Obviously Max was able to put that in full effect. Max had hipped Miles to my show “Yo MTV Raps” and [Miles] was checking it out. This was an extension of how Max would always bring me up when the hip hop thing came up.

Another key thing that Max said to me after I gave him that demonstration with DJ Spy, Max said “…you know western music has for a long period of time been a balancing of three different things: melody, harmony and rhythm in equal ways. As black folks have been involved in music we’ve added an increasing emphasis on the rhythm element throughout the development of this music.” And Max, when he would have a conversation like that would always say “…from Louis Armstrong up until…” He said “what you guys are doing is just totally rhythm…” Now that’s one thing that when he broke it down I said “…oh shit, yeah…” just grabbing a piece of the music and having a way to manually manipulate the record to have this extended rhythm was something Max heard clearly. He also told me “man, if you don’t know it, this is so big what you guys are doing…” I’m like “yeah Max, great…” [still skeptical].

It was the early 80s when I had this conversation with Max. By 1988 I’m the host of the first nationally televised show to focus on this rap music [“Yo MTV Raps”] and go around the country interviewing the different people who were defining this culture-everybody from Tupac and Snoop to Will Smith and Run D.M.C., etc., etc. It would all become so much bigger than I ever, ever could have imagined… I’m talking like on a global basis-where people who speak other languages could adopt this thing and make it theirs in a unique way. I thought back to what Max had said and how he was right, and how when we get into it we were just gonna embrace this whole rhythm thing, and how just the verbal, this whole rapping thing was interesting.

At what point did the light go on and you realized that this was part of a continuum – that what your father and Max and those guys were into… there was a straight-line continuum to what you and your contemporaries were getting into in the 80s? 

It was during that time that it blew up. I’m hosting “Yo MTV Raps,” which just came out of nowhere, that was never an intention of mine to be on camera doing things… I always wanted to do things culturally to help stir it up and create these bigger platforms. A lot of my ability and understanding of that were things that I absorbed around my dad and his friends; knowing that Max Roach and these musicians were loved more so around the world than here… The fact that I knew people who were big in Paris, and Italy, and Japan was just amazing to me, it gave me a sense of the world as a very young kid.

Hence key things that I would make happen or launch or instigate in hip hop were motivated by these ideas – knowing that, wait a minute, this stuff that we’re doing in the ‘hood-in the Bronx or Brooklyn-is not happening anywhere else in the world. To me that was interesting and I knew it would be at least accepted in other places around the world because these people had embraced and understood the music we were making and put musicians like Max and them on a pedestal on a par with the greatest European musicians ever, and I felt that these people would at least appreciate the things we were doing, because at that time it was not in any way appreciated by mainstream culture here in America. And that led me to then do things which would become very significant.

The first film on hip hop culture, Wild Style, I starred in, I did all the music for, I collaborated with a guy named Charlie Ahearn on the film. The initial idea I had was to make a film that showed that there was a link between this music, this rapping and DJ’ing, this break dancing and this graffiti art… there were no links [established previously]. I felt that they were all very similar and if we could put it together in a movie, in a story that depicted it as such, it would create a much more cohesive cultural picture and a look at what we were doing in the streets and the ghettos of New York. There was no positive press or mentions of a young kid with sneakers on and his hat to the side… you were made to look like you were one of those criminals that was destroying the city. So Wild Style the movie became this first look that many people around the world had and a spark that ignited them to get busy, and I’m proud of that. Those ideas came directly from the experiences I had being around those kind of individuals [like Max Roach] and knowing that they made global moves.

OK, so you were sitting around as a young kid doing your thing and these elders were doing their thing, what was it about what you heard or experienced from these jazzheads that inspired you?

Jimmy Gittins had a huge influence on a lot of that because he was an artist, he was a sculptor and he started this program called the Sculpture Workshop that was a community organization that you could work as a kid and teach people sculpture in the Bed-Stuy area, and Jimmy just loved doing that. So these are my beginnings… taking a big chunk of clay and seeing Jimmy carve busts of Malcolm, and King Tut, and just making amazing images of us and things. And then me making something and anything I did Jimmy and all those guys were just encouraging and enthusiastic about. There was no idea or no kind of thing that was beyond at least discussing in my household. Not so much with my father, but Jimmy and those guys that were kind of an extension of [his dad].

It was Jimmy who taught me how to play chess when I was 8 or 9 years old. I felt like their little think tank if you will. They were just the most intelligent men… they were very articulate, they were very hip, they were very slick, they were street, all these things and I guess as those things synthesized in me it was just how I thought. It wasn’t always apparent how connected these thoughts were to what I grew up around, but as I grew older I would realize… and I would constantly think of what I was around as a kid and realize what effect these things had on me. Just knowing that Max was there…

I can remember when I first began to put two and two together and to figure out what I wanted to be a part of, which was the mainstream pop art world, where there was no real precedent of black folks being key in those spaces. It was really like ‘how do I do this…?’ I wanted to be a painter, like the work of Andy Warhol that I had seen as a little kid in a magazine; he looked cool to me… I would find some stuff that inspired graffiti artists, a lot of us that were painting on the trains. So what’s the difference? We’re getting stuff from comic books and ads just like they did, so what’s the difference? I just had to figure out a way to get into the galleries so that people could see me on the same walls they would see a Warhol or [Roy] Lichtenstein and what not.

Through this whole period whenever I would have meetings with Max I would download all this stuff and he would be so encouraging and enthusiastic. The first [art] show that we had, the first press, was at a real prestigious gallery in Rome in ’79. I’m like 19 or 20… it’s crazy!

How did you and Max Roach come to collaborate onstage? 

This story I told you about earlier where the guy put us together, that happened at The Kitchen [NYC]. If you go on YouTube you can find a little clip of it, just a piece of it. I’m like, ‘I’m no musician’ and Max Roach was one of the biggest figures in my life, he’s a musician, how do I even talk music with him? I’m not a musician, but I could make sounds with my mouth. I was so nervous about giving Max instructions, like how do you tell this great master musician how and what to play? I remember at one point we had a conversation after we were rehearsing some stuff. He said “Man listen, I know it’s kind of difficult for you to be able to tell me what to play, but man don’t even worry about that, you’re in charge.” It was unbelievable that he would say some shit like that! I’d have to get my shit together and then figure out how to express it to him.

There’s a recording that I’ll dig up, one of the things that we recorded and I wrote a rap… It was hard for me to instruct Max how to keep like one beat as simply as the backbeat for any one of a million rap records that have been made since then. How do you tell a guy that plays the drums and makes it sound like there are three people playing at once… I don’t even know how to do that, it just seemed awkward. What I thought about doing, which we did and I found a recording of that-and this was before sampling was a big thing-I said “what we’ll do is we’ll record and then we’ll loop a recording of what I hear from what you played and I’ll get the engineers to loop that up and make a track of that, and from that track I made a rap over that: “Max Roach he’s architect, a pioneer, on the drums he’s an architect, an engineer…” I had fly shit that I just wrote about Max. When I played it back recently I was like “Oh my God, that’s nice… yeah!” But once again it was just unstructured, because the whole song structure [of rap] hadn’t developed and it was just me rapping and Max playing. I think it had a hook and it would have been very interesting had we released it.

It’s hip hop in the sense that… Hip hop is more like… I mean people call Kenny G jazz, but you would have a problem saying that, right?

Yep. 

Good, me too. Along that line we could differentiate between, like Blondie, something else that I helped make happen, Deborah Harry making “Rapture”, which was the first rap record to go #1 pop. She’s rapping, but that’s not hip hop. Hip hop bespeaks many things, particularly being part of the culture, adhering to all those things that are just… You know what I’m saying? Like there’s white cats… not to dismiss Kenny G because he’s white, but there’s Gene Krupa, there are a lotta white dudes that you could just feel by how they articulate what they do on their instrument… you’re like ‘OK, dude gets a pass…’

I used to love hearing my father and them listening when I was a young boy… ‘Aw man no, that’s so and so, no that’s not him,, that sounds like blah, blah, blah… no, that’s an ofay…’ They weren’t dissin’ white people, but it really meant most of the time that they weren’t as up to snuff as most of the official cats. I know that Gene Krupa got some love and there were some white musicians that my father and them would okay, but not that many…

What we did you could say it was hip hop, but yeah I was just rappin’, because it’s me, because anything I do is officially hip hop because I’m one of the creators of the brand and what not [laughs].

One of the things that Max always said about the development of rapping and eventually hip hop culture relates to yours being the first generation that was denied the opportunity to pick up any instrument they wanted to learn in school; and as a result your generation created rap and hip hop out of raw materials. 

Great point, key point… Yes Max would bring that up, that instruments are gone from the schools… It’s funny, I do a lot of work with VH1 and they have this big initiative called “Save the Music” which is a big charitable initiative where they raise all this money to put instruments back in the schools because kids from this generation are not aware for many generations that [the availability of instruments to learn in public schools] was a standard thing in schools, almost a requisite. So you’re right, Max and them would speak to that. It is in a roundabout way one of the things that gives birth to hip hop, this form, this new thing was because kids were not able to develop and become proficient on instruments like many would have wanted to or would have dabbled in to a certain extent. That would be a discussion we would have with Max. He was very aware of things going on as they connected to a historical lineage. A lot of this shit didn’t click then, but I’m glad I remembered it because it all fit into place as the years went by.

 Some weeks back an invigorating, spirited Saturday evening was spent at Sista’s Place, a cooperative black enterprise at 456 Nostrand Avenue (corner of Jefferson Avenue; by subway take A or C train to Nostrand Ave. stop) in Brooklyn. The occasion was an all-star band including trumpeter Ahmed Abdullah, baritone saxophonist Hamiet Bluiett, violinist Billy Bang, pianist D.D. Jackson, tubist Bob Stewart, and drummer Andrew Cyrille. Needless to say, with such fire breathers onstage the action was ferocious. And this was an audience that fed the fire in equal turns. Though comfortably mixed, the audience was decidedly African American, and a constant amen corner further stoked the musicians; their delight at playing for such an encouraging audience was palpable on the artists’ faces and in their playing. There’s nothing quite like a thoroughly engaged audience to coax high caliber performances.

Then on a recent Sunday afternoon we had a return visit to Sista’s Place for a book signing with Randy Weston for our book African Rhythms, the autobiography of Randy Weston (Composed by Randy Weston, Arranged by Willard Jenkins; Duke University Press). Once again the Sista’s Place audience was thoroughly engaged, delighting in Weston’s vivid recounting of his life in Brooklyn and in his quest of the spirits of our ancestors.

Located in a very pleasant and spotless corner storefront, with adjacent food cooperative, Sista’s Place can comfortably accommodate about 75 patrons at small tables; that close proximity lending further credence to the amen corner. The walls are adorned with many of the jazz masters who’ve performed at Sista’s, and looming over all is the patron saint, John Coltrane. At Sista’s Place the philosophy of “Jazz, a music of the spirit” is blessedly alive and well. Jazz has a true home at Sista’s Place, a vibrant community center, cultural gathering place, and political pow-wow of sorts where the jazz series runs on Saturday nights. Sista’s Place officially opened for jazz, in its nearby former incarnation, on September 23, 1995 – John Coltrane’s birthday, another reason for Trane’s honored position in the Sista’s pantheon.

As part of our ongoing Brooklyn jazz archives project for the Weeksville Heritage Center (www.weeksvillesociety.org), we had the enlightening pleasure of conducting separate interviews with three Sista’s Place principles – founders community activist Viola Plummer and attorney Roger Wareham, and Sista’s artistic director of jazz programming, trumpeter-bandleader and Sun Ra alum Ahmed Abdullah. This is part one of their commentary on the development of this increasingly rare venue – a black-operated and oriented community house for jazz music. I had previously interviewed Wareham for the former IAJE Journal back in the 90s, at the behest of the former BET Jazz major domo and current BET executive Paxton Baker who had funded Sista’s, so I was familiar with their first locale. Bringing Viola Plummer and Ahmed Abdullah’s voices into the commentary along with Wareham shed much further light.

The whole feel and philosophy behind Sista’s Place recalls the former Brooklyn cultural edifice known as the East, the life of which was detailed in a previous Independent Ear interview with Jitu Weusi, also part of our Weeksville project (check the IE archives). As was the case with the East, Sista’s Place was developed on a political foundation, in this case known as the December 12th movement. We begin with the mother of Sista’s Place, Viola Plummer.

Why is your organization known as the December 12th movement?

Viola Plummer: Some years ago there was an incident in upstate New York where the guards in the Orange County Jail house put on Ku Klux Klan outfits and abused two African American and one Latino prisoner. At that time three of our brothers were on trial in Goshen for weapons’ possession and we had a judge that was from hell. So when we went to court for our three brothers, the mother of one of the victims in the county jail heard us take on the judge. After that she said to us “You know, these young men were brutalized… and nothing has happened… This was in Newburg, NY in ’87 and we need some of your spirit up here.” So we began to talk to her about how we take on the county jail apparatus in Orange County. We had a subsequent date for our three brothers [who were on trial].

Talk about the December 12 movement in terms of arts & culture. 

VP: One of the things is that we – because of our politics – we understand that culture is the transmission belt of struggle, of understanding who you are, what the value of it was. Our advent into needing to have somewhere musicians could play is that we had a series in Harlem called “Jazz Comes to Fight Back,” and the first person we [presented], at the old Music & Arts High School, was Wynton Marsalis when he first came [onto the scene]. Because we understood that jazz expressed who we were, and talked about our humanity and our values; it was in the music, it was in the rhythms, it was in the melody and the riffs. For December 12th it was the way in which we could say to the people that struggle is for liberation and that there is no struggle for struggle’s sake; art is that expression, and the music… sister Thulani always says, and it’s so true, that music saved our lives. From the blues to the gospel, to jazz, to R&B… it really saved our lives. And for the December 12th movement people heard our politics better [as a result of the music]. From Africa, to Brooklyn, to Harlem, to Goshen… it was always the music, it was always the dance…

In the whole development of your efforts through the December 12th movement, what have been your activities in the area of arts & culture?

Roger Wareham:  Politically one of our slogans or mantras is that “culture is a weapon.” For every struggle for liberation one of the most important components, if not the most important component, is culture. And that takes many forms. I always remember a lecture that Amilcar Cabral, who led the liberation struggle in Guinea-Bissau, gave in the Cape Verde Islands. He started off the discussion talking about [Nazi commander Herman] Goebbels, and how whenever the Nazis had a discussion and the issue of culture came up, Goebbels took out his gun and put it on the table because he was really clear that if you were going to suppress a people, to conquer them you had to destroy their culture. We always saw culture as a key component for our struggle for liberation. So the theme of Sista’s Place is “culture is a weapon.”

We opened on September 23, 1995 on John Coltrane’s birthday; we start our season around then and we’ve always had artists who reflect some degree of consciousness of the nature of our struggle. So we’ve never separated the art from the culture. It’s been mainly music, but we also have poetry; Luis Reyes Rivera conducts poetry workshops and we’ve had different people producing plays. But we’ve never separated – and we don’t want those who enjoy the culture to separate culture from the history and the struggle that created it, it’s a part of it and it also feeds and energizes it.

What was the decision behind determining that Sista’s Place was going to have a jazz presence?

VP:  We thought that in this community, after the East was gone, after all the music places were gone… and remember, we had started [the jazz policy] in Harlem [with] “Jazz Comes to Fight Back” because we feel that it is jazz that really expresses, at least for us old people, our culture; it’s the music that grew out of struggle, that got interpreted, and that some of the brothers and sisters [jazz musicians] that are still alive didn’t play in our community, because there were no places to play [jazz in the black community of Brooklyn] when we started. I said the music I like best is jazz, so they called me the jazz policeman; I thought that was the music that was needed in our community.

When we were in the former location down the street, there was a brother who worked for the railroad who had three boys and he would bring them every [jazz] night. Then there was another lady who has passed away, her nephew would come and they would be awestruck at how these brothers had conquered their instruments, and they would listen… they HEARD the music!

RW:  I’m from Harlem [laughs]… When you say you’re from Harlem you don’t deal with Brooklyn; Brooklyn was like you needed a passport to come to Brooklyn back in the day. I don’t know chapter and verse, but I understand the richness of Brooklyn’s contribution to jazz, and maybe more so than Harlem because a lot of folks who played there weren’t indigenous to Harlem, whereas a lot of folks emerged out of Brooklyn. Our first [Sista’s Place] spot was on the corner of Jefferson and Nostrand. Jefferson begins at Claver Place, and Claver Place is where the East was, at 10 Claver Place. So you just walked from the East right up to Sista’s Place; so it’s almost a geographic and physical part of that [East] legacy.

Ahmed Abdullah, when you moved to Brooklyn in 1970, what was it like for jazz in Brooklyn at that time? 

Ahmed Abdullah:  I came in on the decline of the golden era. I’ve talked to other people who were involved in the earlier jazz in Brooklyn when all the other clubs were around. During that time [1970] we had the Blue Coronet, there was the Muse on Bedford Avenue near Lincoln Place; people like [saxophonist and late brother of Kenny Barron] Bill Barron, [bassist] Reggie Workman, [saxophonist] Roland Alexander, and [poet] Louis Reyes Rivera were all at The Muse. Bill Barron ran jam sessions there and it was one of the places that I got my roots in music because he was very gracious in allowing musicians to come and play. There were some great musicians who played there; [pianist] Danny Mixon, for example, would come and play there all the time; all of the cats that were part of the [Muse] staff would also come and perform in these jam sessions. So the Muse was a very important cultural institution, and Reggie Workman was in fact the administrator of Muse at that time.

In the 1970s many of the musicians lived around Williamsburg, around Broadway and Bedford. Rashied Ali had a group there called the Melodic Art-Tet, and the group actually consisted of [saxophonist] Charles Brackeen, [bassist] Ronnie Boykins, and Roger Blank, and we used to rehearse at Rashied Ali’s place; he had a loft in Brooklyn. This was before he got his loft in Soho that became Ali’s Alley in the mid-70s.

Would you say those enclaves of musicians and subsequent performances in such spaces were kind of an outgrowth of the Black Arts Movement?

A.A.: Oh definitely, because there was a lot of cultural awareness happening in the 1970s and we were definitely picking up on what had happened in the 1960s and in fact instituting some of those actions in institutions. The 70s was a realization of the activities of the 1960s in many ways. The East certainly was that, and certainly what we were doing at 1310 Atlantic Avenue was that; it was a very rich time. I played the East a number of different times; I played the East with a group called the Brotherhood of Sound, with a group called the Master Brotherhood, with the Melodic Art-Tet, and I played there with Sun Ra. My very first performance with Sun Ra was at the East, in April 1975. This is a very [ironic] thing, playing at the East; I’m now teaching a block away from the East at PS3, and a block away from that is Sista’s Place! So there is a spiritual connection. I came to the East in 1975, to Sista’s Place in 1998, and I started teaching at PS3 in 2005. All of these things are stacked up in a row on that avenue.

 Without a doubt, jazz-fusion guitar legend John McLaughlin’s East-meets-West explorations with Shakti played a pivotal role in establishing world music as a viable, potent force. Formed in 1974, the groundbreaking group also consisted of North Indian tabla master Zakir Hussain, and violinist L. Shankar and ghatam player T.H. “Vikku” Vinayakram, both of whom hail from South India. The band seamlessly bridged jazz and Indian classical music-genres previously perceived as disparate traditions. McLaughlin’s enormous fan base from his years fronting the wildly popular early ’70s jazz-rock act Mahavishnu Orchestra ensured Shakti had a large audience from the outset. As a result, it opened the ears of listeners worldwide to the immense possibilities cross-cultural musical collaborations can yield. In 1997, a new version of the group emerged as Remember Shakti, a band that continues to this day. In this excerpt from my book Innerviews: Music Without Borders, McLaughlin reflects on Shakti’s achievements, the common ground between jazz and Indian music, and why “music is the face of God.”

What role do you believe Shakti played in the widespread acceptance of world music? 

When I formed Shakti, it was dimly viewed, I should say! After coming out of Mahavishnu Orchestra-a very powerful electric band-here I was sitting on a carpet with Indian musicians. Everyone thought I flipped out. It was not well-received at all by the record company or my agent and manager. Artistically, I thought it was wonderful, but they all thought I was a little loopy. It was not good news to them. But I’m extremely proud of Shakti because prior to it, there was very little collaboration between North and South Indian musicians. Shakti played a role in the reunification of the North and South in the musical sense. Since Shakti, the collaborations between North and South have grown a thousand times. We now have very regular North-South meetings. We were very timely as far as we were concerned. Subsequently in the ’80s, ethnic music and world music became much more popular. People began to seek out a new sound. The globalization of the world is part of the same process. The shrinking of the planet and increased intercommunication between countries and cultures has played a role too.

Remember Shakti’s debut album is much more steeped in Indian classical traditions than it is in any Western forms. 

Yes, things went the natural Indian way. This, of course, included the introduction of the raga, the various ways of collective playing and the principal improvisations from the soloists. As musicians, we are playing notes, music and rhythms, and we hope to play the right melody in the correct way, but this is only part of the process. The other side that is important is the communication of the musicians and the playing and playfulness that comes from that interaction. You can put a piece of music in front of somebody and he may play it perfectly. So what? Interplay and interaction are the integral parts of music. They’re as important as the notes. Without them, I don’t think I’d be here. You can’t just play over someone. There are many examples in jazz-fusion in which you have a soloist playing over a steady drumbeat and I find that terribly boring, because I want to hear the interaction between two people. I want to know what kind of imagination and spontaneity they have. Only in spontaneity can we be who we truly are.

How do you balance the mathematic equations of Indian rhythmic development with the jazz universe? 

There is really a great deal of common ground. The mathematics of rhythm are universal. They don’t belong to any particular culture. It’s true that the sensuality of rhythm is coupled with the mathematical mind in India. It’s not for nothing that India has produced some of the greatest atomic engineers, mathematicians and astronomers. India even has an observatory that goes back many hundreds of years in which the orbits of planets were calculated. So you can say it’s been developed to a more sophisticated level there than in jazz music. But whether it’s from Africa, China, Brazil, or India, rhythm is rhythm. If you try to improvise in jazz without some degree of rhythmical mathematical proficiency, you’ll be lost by the drummer and flounder.

You once said “music is the face of God.” Elaborate on that. 

I am convinced, as many people are, that we all have divine origins and that essentially everything is divine. We all come from the One, we all are in the One, and we can never be apart from each other and the One. This is the personal conviction. It all comes down to an intellectual game in the end if you start to consider truth, goodness and beauty which are probably the essential attributes of what we consider to be God. If something is really true, it has to be beautiful. And music is beautiful, so it has to be true. God is the most beautiful of all the beautiful and the source of all beauty, so music has to be intimately acquainted with God in some way. Let me put it another way: truth without beauty is the atom bomb.

 Spend a few days in New Orleans and see how often the name Fred Kasten is heard and mentioned. Whether curating the French Quarter Festival’s Let Them Talk interviews in April, or curating the Satchmo Summerfest seminars in August, or winning the Edward R. Murrow Award for News Series, or producing his wonderful radio shows, Talkin’ Jazz and Jazz New Orleans, Kasten is an indispensable man in the life of his beloved hometown.

According to his WWNO biography, Kasten “is an independent contributing radio producer/host at WWNO. After working at (the station) for over 20 years as an on-air talent, producer and program director, Fred retired from full-time work in May 2007. Fred is a native of Mobile, Ala., a graduate of the University of Alabama, and a long-time resident of New Orleans. In addition to his work at WWNO, Fred develops independent audio projects from a home studio, producing radio features, commercials and podcasts.”

Quite a busy and fulfilling “retirement”!

What makes Kasten so special? “Fred truly cares about the music,” says Marci Schramm, the executive director of French Quarter Festivals, Inc. “He is passionate, knowledgeable, and has a firm grasp of music history-but also, he is a great colleague and a gentleman. With his work, there is no ego. Even though Fred is a well-known producer, the stories he tells are always about the musicians and their music. He has a great way of getting a fascinating interview out of his subjects every time.”

In 2013 New Orleans Public Radio won the coveted Edward R. Murrow Award for its Kasten-produced series Louisiana Coast: Last Call. Reported by Bob Marshall, this 15 part series, according to the station’s website, examines “Louisiana’s massive coastal erosion, during which every hour an area of wetlands the size of a football field disappears beneath the waves of the Gulf of Mexico. Interviewing scientists, engineers, public officials, fishermen and oystermen, Marshall and Kasten explore the causes of the erosion, the projections of future losses, the regional and national impact on the economy and environment, and possible approaches to restrain the continued land losses.”

So who is Fred Kasten?

He grew up “on the western edge of Mobile, Ala., in a small cottage that my father had built by himself on nights and weekends with the assistance of a couple of ‘how-to’ books he’d checked out of the public library and his own fierce determination to get it done-an accomplishment that still boggles my mind.

“The cottage was situated next to my maternal grandmother’s house on a seven acre plot she’d bought in the late 1940s when the area was a sparsely populated blend of country and suburban living. In my earliest years it leaned more country-but became increasingly suburban as the years went by. Of the seven acres, only one was landscaped, with the rest a blend of pine and hardwood forest-including a modest pecan grove and a few fruit trees. There was also a sizeable scuppernong vine, and my grandfather always grew a big vegetable garden. He and my grandmother also raised chickens, and for a few of my early years had a cow for milk.”

Was any member of the Kasten household musical? “My mother had taken a few piano lessons as a youngster and loved to listen to music, and my father loved to sing. He was a charter member of the Mobile chapter of the SPEBSQSA (Society for the Preservation and Encouragement of Barbershop Quartet Singing in America) and had a quartet, the Note Wits, which occasionally rehearsed at our house. Their rehearsals and performances, in fact, are among my earliest musical memories. My sister Carole, who’s five years older, started piano lessons when she was about 10-and when I followed a few years later we got our first used upright. I was a cliché of a young male piano student-a lot more interested in playing football, baseball and basketball than practicing the piano-but our teacher, Thelma Owens, who had studied at the Cincinnati Conservatory, was very good-and I did get a decent background in the fundamentals of music.”

Seeing and hearing Benny Goodman lit the jazz fuse for young Fred Kasten. “My mother was very good about taking us to cultural events-symphony concerts and opera and the like-and one Mobile Symphony concert when I was about eleven made a very powerful impression on me: the guest artist was Benny Goodman. For the first half of the concert he played the Mozart Clarinet Concerto-then he played a set with his quartet for the second half. This was my first chance to hear live jazz-and I loved it. I’d heard a little big band jazz from a local radio station, and had just a couple of times caught some of the legendary jazz DJ Dick Martin’s Moonglow With Martin on WWL from New Orleans-but hearing Benny really got me motivated to find out more about jazz.

“A couple of other things happened around that same time that further spurred my interest in jazz: we got our first stereo; Mobile got its first decent record store; and I switched from piano to trombone. My mother had gone to high school with the great trombonist Urbie Green, so she bought me some Urbie Green records-which turned out to be great-and I followed the trail of other players on those records, and started to read books about jazz and look for copies of jazz magazines-all of which led me to Thelonious Monk, who became one of my biggest and longest-standing musical heroes.

“Through Monk I started to get hip to Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie, Bud Powell and other beboppers. The Dave Brubeck Quartet was also getting airplay at that time with ‘Take Five’-then ‘Unsquare Dance’-and I really enjoyed Dave’s music. In high school I started to get together with friends from the school band and make some laughable attempts to play jazz-me on both piano and trombone. I also took music theory classes in high school-and composed some contemporary classical and jazz-flavored pieces-all of which, thankfully, are now lost.”

Was there much live jazz to dig in Mobile? “We didn’t get to hear much live jazz, though there was one New Orleans-style brass band-the Excelsior Band-that marched in the best Carnival parades, but we did get to enjoy a lot of great R&B and Soul. Top New Orleans artists such as Irma Thomas, Ernie K-Doe, Lee Dorsey, Benny Spellman and Clarence ‘Frogman’ Henry played in the Mobile area fairly often. I also got to see and hear James Brown, Otis Redding, Wilson Pickett, Jackie Wilson, Percy Sledge, Don Covay and others numerous times-and that music had a profound effect on me-as did the classical music we played in the high school concert band. I also became an early and avid Bob Dylan fan.”

Kasten says that Jazz Fest was the magnet that pulled him into New Orleans music. “I knew very little about New Orleans traditional music-and zip about the city’s modern jazz scene-until I started going to Jazz Fest in the early 1970s. After my first Jazz Fest in 1973 a whole new cadre of musical icons came onto my radar: Ellis Marsalis, James Black, Alvin Batiste, Al Belletto, Earl Turbinton, Willie Tee, Alvin ‘Red’ Tyler, Danny and Blue Lu Barker, Percy and Willie Humphrey, Professor Longhair, James Booker, Snooks Eaglin, Gatemouth Brown, Roosevelt Sykes and the Meters-with many more to follow in ensuing years, especially after my wife and I moved to New Orleans in 1984.”

How early was radio an interest in Kasten’s life? “We didn’t get a television set until I was seven, so I heard a lot of radio in my earliest years. It was the tail end of the ‘golden age’ of network radio, and I remember hearing Jack Benny, Fibber McGee and Molly, Gunsmoke, The Shadow, the soap opera My Gal Sunday, and other weekly shows on a regular basis.”

Interestingly, comics played a big role in Kasten’s life: “More than anyone on the radio, though, it was standup comics-on television and record-who helped shape my ideas about performing. Steve Allen-and The Steve Allen Show with Tom Poston, Don Knotts, Louis Nye, Pat Harrington, Jr. and Bill Dana-was a favorite, and I was a big fan of Brother Dave Gardner, Woody Allen, Jackie Vernon, David Steinberg and Nichols and May. I always looked forward to the great pianist and raconteur Oscar Levant’s appearances on The Jack Paar Show-and later listened over and over to the records of Richard Pryor, Lenny Bruce and the comedy troupes Beyond the Fringe and Firesign Theater. Firesign Theater had started on the radio-and it was while trying to figure out how they put their sketches together that I decided to take a couple of courses in radio and television production in undergraduate school at the University of Alabama.”

Believe it or not, it was furniture that first thrust Kasten into radio. “My major at U. Alabama was International Relations, with a minor in English, and after finishing undergraduate school I did what most International Relations majors from ‘Bama are qualified to do-I got a job selling furniture. That, oddly enough, is how I got my first radio experience. Thanks to those radio and TV production classes in school, I knew enough to write and produce the furniture store’s radio and television ads. And since I’ve been blessed with a decent voice, I also became their radio and TV spokesman.”

Soon the producer at the Mobile NPR affiliate WHIL, Penny Dennis, hired Kasten part-time. “Penny was a top-notch air talent and producer and she convinced the program director to give me an audition-and I got the job. I was totally green as a disc jockey-didn’t even know how to cue up a record properly-and pretty sad on the air-but I saw right away that this was the work I was meant to do-and that trying to get good at it was going to be a challenge that could hold my interest for the long run.”

After Kasten’s wife Jennie earned her Master’s degree in Library Science, she “pushed the idea of moving to New Orleans, for which I am eternally grateful, and we both managed to land jobs within a few days of each other, and moved to the Crescent City in July of 1984.”

After working at several stations-“I learned a tremendous amount of radio programming, production, promotion and sales from WCKW station manager Bobby Martinez and sales manager Ric Frances”-Kasten landed at WWNO in December 1986. “Doing a jazz show five nights a week in the city where it all started was a dream come true. I was glad, though, that I’d been in New Orleans for a couple of years before getting that job, because I knew it-and the jazz scene-a lot better than I had when we first arrived.

“By then, too, I’d also developed a programming philosophy that I’ve continued to employ ever since. It was inspired by something Leonard Bernstein said about the music of Beethoven; he called it ‘accessible without being ordinary.’ I wanted all the music I played to meet that test.” Another Kasten philosophy came from a U. Alabama history professor who said that history ” ‘is just one goddamn thing after another.’ My adaptation of that was to just play one great song after another.” So the Fred Kasten radio mantra became Just play one great-accessible without being ordinary-song after another. “There are, of course, ample other considerations-mood, tempo, key, topicality, message and the like-but I aim for the music I play to pass those first two tests before adding other qualifiers. And WWNO listeners have responded very favorably to that approach through the years.”

In addition to playing records-and later, compact discs-Kasten began a “series of live broadcasts of jazz concerts from various New Orleans venues: the Dirty Dozen and Astral Project from Snug Harbor; Alvin ‘Red’ Tyler featuring Germaine Bazzle from Tyler’s Beer Garden; the Rebirth Brass Band from the Glass House. We worked with Bruce Raeburn and the Hogan Jazz Archive at Tulane-thanks to funding from the Louisiana Endowment for the Humanities-to produce an award-winning 13 part series on early jazz titled Louisiana Swing, which spotlighted through vintage recordings and oral histories the contributions of such early greats as Jelly Roll Morton, Joe ‘King’ Oliver, Louis Armstrong, the Original Dixieland Jazz Band, A.J. Piron, the New Orleans Owls, the Dodds brothers, Sam Morgan and more.”

To this writer, New Orleans feels like a European city plopped down in the tropics. What is it about this city that makes music part of the daily atmosphere? Says Kasten, “I always say that in New Orleans you can knock on any door and a story will answer. I was given the privilege, starting in the late 80s, of interviewing many great Crescent City musicians-at first for intermission features during our live broadcasts, then later for several locally produced arts magazine programs, then finally for features to slot into the local presentation of NPR news.

“Over the years my mandate broadened from mostly jazz musicians to artists of all disciplines-and ultimately to newsmakers and experts on various topics.” Kasten estimates that he’s conducted more than 2000 interviews. “In 2003 I created, secured funding for and started producing a live-to-tape variety show called Crescent City, which we taped in front of a live audience at Le Chat Noir cabaret on St. Charles Avenue. Crescent City featured the great New Orleans modern jazz band Astral Project as our house band; sketch comedy from our Live Nude Radio Players troupe; a special musical guest or two each episode, (such as) Ellis Marsalis, Leigh ‘Little Queenie’ Harris, Coco Robicheaux, Kermit Ruffins, Dr. Michael White, Germaine Bazzle, and Tom McDermott.” The show would also feature “a writer, artist, chef, raconteur or other interesting or significant New Orleans characters, and was hosted by Ronnie Virgets. We did 45 episodes over a four year period, with a six month or so hiatus following Katrina. The show ended when I retired from the station in May 2007.”

Was it difficult growing up to be an open-minded, non-hateful white man in the South of the mid-20th century? Says Kasten, “I was lucky in that racial epithets and racial diatribes were never part of the conversation in our home, as I know they were in the homes of many of my peers…So, I benefited from the relative tolerance in our home-and parents who chose not to associate much with the more strident racists among their kinfolks and acquaintances. I was also fortunate in that many of my friends were fledgling musicians who shared my admiration for a wide range of African American artists, and who understood that we had a lot to learn about life, art and dealing with adversity from them.”

In 1965, Nat Hentoff asked Duke Ellington if he was going to retire. “Retire? Retire to what?” Duke replied.

Even after “retiring” in 2007, Fred Kasten has achieved more than most do in a career. When the New Orleans Times-Picayune decided to cut back on its book coverage, Kasten pitched his station “on a weekly author interview to slot into Morning Edition.” Thus, The Sound of Books was born. “I’d always enjoyed interviewing writers, but reading a book-a-week was pretty intense. I did that show for over two years, then in the spring of 2013, I started my current project for WWNO, Jazz New Orleans (which airs Friday nights 8 pm to 10 pm Central; it also streams live at WWNO. I describe the show as ‘two hours of the best jazz from the last 70 years, with a strong accent on New Orleans-and an extended conversation with our Player of the Week.'” Over the years, the featured players have included Tim Laughlin, Horace Silver, Sonny Rollins, Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter, Dianne Reeves, Karin Allyson, Leroy Jones, Ellis Marsalis, Germaine Bazzle, Shannon Powell, Don Vappie, Poncho Sanchez, and John Scofield, among many others.

Then came The Louisiana Coast: Last Call, the 15-part series about the “dire circumstances of Louisiana’s coast-and what’s being done about it-that won the Edward R. Murrow Award for News Series. I produced the series, which was written and reported by Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Bob Marshall. Last Call aired on WWNO in 2013, but we started working on it in the late fall of 2012. I had long admired Bob’s reporting…and we’d gotten to know each other socially… I called him and suggested we approach WWNO about doing a series on coastal issues…The success of Last Call encouraged WWNO to pursue additional funding for reporting on coastal issues, and they’ve now put together their own coastal desk, with a fulltime reporter and producer.”

And the projects do not end there! “I do MC duties Friday and Saturday nights at Snug Harbor Jazz Bistro, a wonderful jazz club that features top-notch talent. (I also) schedule and conduct the Talkin’ Jazz with Fred Kasten once-a-month interview series at the Old U.S. Mint for the New Orleans Jazz National Historical Park (it streams live at Music at the Mint, where they are also archived for 30 days or so); and I curate the interview series for the French Quarter Festival and seminar series for the Satchmo Summerfest.”

After 30 years in New Orleans, Fred Kasten reflects on what makes this city so vibrantly unique: “New Orleans is a city that, as Duke Ellington might have put it, is beyond category. It’s a metaphor-rich, irony-loaded place where even the most secure land is shaky, the drinking water comes from the Big Muddy, and the citizenry as a whole maintains what I think of as a very mature attitude about life and death: celebrate life to its fullest (and) accept death as inevitable, maybe even throw it a parade and party. New Orleans is the hometown of the cocktail and of jazz, has the rhythms and climate of the Caribbean, values rather than fears eccentricity, encourages-on occasion demands-costuming, and retains, despite Katrina, Congress, BP, climate change threatening to sink it by the end of the 21st Century and a host of other afflictions, an overall joie de vivre… Mostly though, for me, and about 400,000 other people, too many of whom have not yet been able to return following Katrina, New Orleans feels like home-and I love it.”

As we wind up our visit with Fred Kasten, one question remains: What is it about this music called Jazz?

“For me, jazz is one of the most eloquent and evocative forms of expression people have yet devised, with the power to both illuminate the human condition, and ruminate on it. From my earliest encounters with it, jazz has struck a deep resonance in me, which I credit to several things, including the virtuosity of the players and composers and great storytelling skills of its best practitioners-but mostly to the infinite malleability of the blues and emotional richness of blues feeling. Jazz sounds good and feels good. It feeds the mind, gladdens the heart, and enriches the soul. I feel like a very lucky person to have found it, and been granted the privilege of spending so much time with it.” ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912205597.84/warc/CC-MAIN-20190326160044-20190326182044-00546.warc.gz
62,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/inprofile/george-a-santino-a-seattle-crooner/,"After a twenty year gig at Microsoft, George A. Santino has launched yet another fulfilling career-that of smooth crooner of the Great American Songbook.  According to his website, he has “left the rat race for the Rat Pack.”  His fine new cd, Come Fly With Me, a collection of standards associated with Frank Sinatra, is available from his website.

Says the Seattle-based singer:  “I think I bring something back that has been missing.  When Sinatra sang a song he also told a story.  I think it’s important to understand the song you are singing and get that message across in an entertaining way.  I think my life of growing up poor…and my physical and financial troubles early in life, allow me to bring a unique perspective to a song.  When I sing, ‘That’s Life,’ I really know what it means to be knocked down multiple times and, more importantly, what it takes to keep getting up.”

Santino grew up in a Philadelphia housing project “where poverty and violence had a profound effect on his upbringing,” according to his website.  A motivational speaker and writer, Santino will also be releasing his autobiography in 2013.

How did George exercise his singing muscle during his two decades at Microsoft?  “I actually didn’t sing that much other than with the car radio or in the shower.  Of course, if I was at my mother’s house for Christmas I had to sing.   On my wedding anniversary, I would take my wife out to dinner at a place that had a piano bar so I could sing her a song.  One time we were in Las Vegas and I asked the piano player if I could sing to my wife and he said it wasn’t allowed.  When I placed a nice tip in his jar he quickly invited me up to sing a song.”

When asked about his singing idols, Santino replies:  “I like Sinatra because he truly sings with feeling.  I also like Dean Martin.  One of my favorites as a kid was Elvis [Presley] because he was really doing something no one else had done before.”

How is his family reacting to his new career?  “My kids get a kick out of it.  My wife does remind me from time to time that I’m supposed to be retired, but then again, what is retirement if it isn’t doing something that you really enjoy?”

Although he enjoys recording-and this enjoyment can be heard on Come Fly With Me-Santino loves performing live.   “Singing live is great because you get the instant feedback from the audience, and you quickly find out what is working.  You can also interact, have some fun, and change things up.”

What does the future hold for George A. Santino?  “I hope to take this singing career as far as I can-but the real goal is to have fun.  If some day I’m singing in Vegas, that would be great.  But if instead I’m singing in a little jazz club in Seattle, that’s cool, too.  After all, the great thing about waiting to do this until after I retired is that I don’t have to do something to make money at it.  I’m just doing what I think is fun and what I hope my fans would enjoy.  Someone asked me why I was doing another cd [a Christmas album] so soon after I released the first one–that I should let that one sell for a while first.  I replied that I set out to do a Christmas album in the first place and if I want it out this year, now is the time to do it.   Besides, singing Christmas songs is fun.  Even in July.”

George A. Santino-check him out.  You won’t be sorry. ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912203326.34/warc/CC-MAIN-20190324043400-20190324065400-00139.warc.gz
63,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/inprofile/mike-persico-soul-mood-and-emotion/,"We Cape Codders are lucky indeed. Yes, there’s the Atlantic Ocean, fresh seafood and tubby tourists in Speedos. But there is also Mike Persico, trombonist and singer extraordinaire, sure to be gigging somewhere on our fair peninsula.

“I’ve been a featured performer in many different groups my whole life,” Persico says, “but basically I’m a sideman. Last March, I put together a sextet for a Louis Armstrong tribute at a school fundraiser. It was so successful that I decided to form a permanent small group so I could play the tunes I love.”

Speaking of Pops, Mike has become close to Armstrong’s dear friend, Jack Bradley, who also lives on Cape Cod. “Jack is a great gentleman, a chronicler of jazz, a master photographer. I go to Jack’s house to help him with the Herculean task of organizing his files, photos, films and books that he did not give to the Louis Armstrong House Museum in Queens. This is one of the greatest jobs I have-I learn so much every time I see him. Jack is truly a national treasure and I’m so lucky to call him my friend.”

I have a hunch that Pops would have dug the deep trombone sound of Mike Persico. To these ears, Mike’s bone tone is rich, burnished-like dark-brown oak-and he always swings. “On Christmas Day 1973 I received a brand new King 3B trombone,” he says. “Up to that point I was playing an old, turn of the century Muller that was built like a tank and was just as melodic. With the new horn, which my mother bought from the store I was working at, a whole new world opened up before me. God bless Mom: She went into hock for over a year to get me that horn. I still play it today and have no plans to replace it.”

Cape Cod is still mourning the passing of its godfather of Jazz, trumpeter Lou Colombo. Says Persico, “I’ve performed with a lot of truly outstanding players over the past thirty plus years, and I’ve learned a great deal. But as great as they were, nobody comes close to Lou Colombo. I was fortunate enough to be his second horn for ten years-the best ten years of my life. Lou knew every song, and his sound was pure joy. He could produce the most outstanding sounds, right up to the time he passed away. Just when some thought his age might be catching up with him, Lou would play the most astounding stuff-knocked you out cold!”

Colombo was also renowned for being a superb teacher. What did Persico learn from the master? “Lou taught me the value of playing soft and what it meant to be an entertainer. He made no bones about it-musicians are entertainers. Another great thing is that the more we played together, the tighter we got. I’d harmonize all of the breaks or other riffs he played and the audience loved it-just ate it up. Nothing revolutionary like Pops and King Oliver, but not bad. Lou also loved my singing and encouraged me every chance he got. If he called a tune I didn’t know, I made sure I learned it before the next gig. Working with Lou was like a holiday. God, I miss him.”

A 1980 graduate of the Berklee School of Music, Persico is justly proud of his lengthy teaching career. “By January 1983 I was the Mashpee (Mass.) Middle School Band Director (grades 4-8) and for the next 27 years I enjoyed that position. I moved to grades 7-12 in ’97,” he says. “I taught all instruments, had two concert bands and two jazz bands and a marching band. I also taught piano, music theory and theater. I was blessed with great students who made the time quite enjoyable. We even performed ‘Hail to the Chief’ for then President George H.W. Bush with my junior high band in October 1990. What a time that was!”

Persico’s musical idol is Mr. T-Jack Teagarden. “What can I possibly say that hasn’t been said before? Before I heard Jack play, I thought I had heard everyone–J.J. Johnson, Kai Winding, Frank Rossilino-and that’s what the t-bone was supposed to sound like. But in my sophomore year of college, my good friend Phil Person introduced me to the music of Louis Armstrong. I was knocked out by Pops, but his trombone player was like no one I’d ever heard. The song was ‘Pennies from Heaven’ from the 1947 Town Hall Concert. I decided right there and then that this was the greatest jazz trombonist of them all. (Teagarden possesses) such a warm sound and tremendous flexibility; he played so many intricate figures that I first thought it was a valve trombone. I’ve been sold on him ever since. Jack has been a huge influence on both my playing and singing; I’m still finding recordings I never knew he did. No matter how difficult his triplets and other figures were, he made it all sound so easy. Of course, it’s anything but easy. His style, of which I try (and often fail) to emulate is the very definition of relaxed. Jack Teagarden is the greatest trombone player ever-no lie!”

Born in Yonkers, N.Y., Persico grew up in Garnerville, about thirty miles north of Manhattan. “It’s a little suburb, nothing really special. It used to be all apple orchards until the end of World War II, when they built the Tappan Zee Bridge, which opened the area up.

 “I was always interested in music. I learned a lot of the songs I play now after hearing them on Bugs Bunny cartoons. While both my mom and dad encouraged my music, it was Mom who gave me the most support. She’s a real people person who waitressed for thirty years. I started on accordion, but dropped that after a few lessons and then took up the alto horn in fifth grade. My first music teacher was David Buck, a very droll but knowledgeable musician-always wore a black suit every day-looking like a diamond merchant or one of the Blues Brothers.”

After becoming familiar with the trumpet and then the baritone horn, Mike made the final switch to trombone in high school. “My band director was Bruce Robinson, a man I still remember with fondness and affection. He and his wife were a singing duo in the ’50s and used to appear on the Ed Sullivan Show. Mr. Robinson helped instill in me a love of music and entertainment that I carry still.”

A few years later Persico began advanced studies with Bob Nash, “who wrote commercials in New York City for radio and television. Bob had his own studio in the city where I met a lot of great players like Thad Jones and Jon Faddis. I was only a kid, but I knew I was lucky. I was resolved at this point to become a professional musician. I was playing in a local big band and doing gigs by the time I was 15. Too bad I was born 70 years too late!”

Every artist needs a muse, and Persico is no exception. “I’ve been fortunate to have a partner who always supports my efforts,” he says. “My wife Jane is my biggest fan; her encouragement has pulled me through good times and bad. Her father was a huge jazz fan so she’s familiar with a lot of the songs I do.”

So what’s up ahead for Mike Persico? His new group “started rehearsing a few weeks ago and I’m using younger guys. To them, all of these tunes are new, so there is freshness to our music. For piano, I’ve hired a former student of mine, Ben Healy, who is simply amazing. I’m putting together a demo in the studio this December with an album planned to record in early ’14 with some of my favorite players like Phil Person on trumpet; Paul Nossiter on clarinet; and Laird Boles on bass. My drummer, Kareem Sanjaghi, is a blessing. Only 25 years old, he’s been playing professionally for over 10 years thanks to his grandfather, (pianist) Bob Hayes. The first time I played with Kareem his feet barely reached the bass drum pedal. He’s come a long way and I see great things in his future. He plays with such soul.

“Hey,” says Persico, “that’s what jazz is all about: soul, mood and emotion. So I keep rolling along, enjoying every moment I can.” ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912203991.44/warc/CC-MAIN-20190325133117-20190325155117-00129.warc.gz

 “I feel that Mosaic Records is carrying the musical torch of this great art form, jazz,” says Mosaic producer Scott Wenzel, “as well as providing a tangible product where one can collect, savor, hear and read something that isn’t off of a phone or stuck in some other device.”

For those infected by Mosaic fever, receiving the company’s latest box set in the mail brings back memories of childhood birthday mornings. Founded by Michael Cuscuna and the late (and beloved) Charlie Lourie, the label’s very first release, 1983’s The Complete Blue Note Recordings of Thelonious Monk, received the first of the company’s many Grammy nominations.

Says Wenzel, “There’s something about the joy of finding and owning a record or CD that is lost today. It’s a hobby that partly defines who we are…good or bad. Mosaic to me is special because we not only provide the music in this way, but because we make the effort to correct misinformation in our discographies; we gather brilliant writers for our booklets; we search out rare and (if possible) actual photos from the sessions. The sound quality of our pressings and transfers are of the highest order. At least we strive for that.”

This writer owns many Mosaic sets. For example, last summer’s Columbia and RCA Victor Live Recordings of Louis Armstrong and the All Stars, co-produced by Wenzel and noted “Satchologist” Ricky Riccardi, has brought hours and hours of joy to this household. In today’s world of often slapdash “workmanship,” Mosaic box sets provide nothing but class-from their book-like “booklets” to their photography to their crisp sound quality.

How does one nab a job working at one of the coolest record companies in the world? “My father owned a builder’s hardware/light fixture shop in Mamaroneck (N.Y.), and after college, (Towson State University) I worked in the shipping department…One lunchtime I was reading the New York Times when I came upon a review of Mosaic Records’ release of Sidney Bechet’s Blue Notes. (This was a November 1985 review by the late John S. Wilson). I immediately called to see if Mosaic had an opening there and spoke to Charlie Lourie, who invited me to his home (in Stamford, Conn.) for an interview. Mosaic operated out of Charlie’s home after the company’s move from Santa Monica, California.”

Lourie, who died in 2000, is remembered with great affection by all who knew him. Says Wenzel: “Charlie and I became immediate friends and there was a fond loyalty and love of the music that I miss after these 15-odd years that he’s been gone. I worked as a part-time employee for a year and at the end of 1986 went back full-time at my father’s store. During this time I was also a DJ on a 24 hour jazz station in Stamford, WYRS (later WJAZ). I went to say hello to Charlie after one of my shifts and he said that Mosaic was leaving his home and going to a warehouse and office space by the harbor in Stamford. There was to be a full-time office manager and a shipping manager along with Charlie and his partner at Mosaic, Michael Cuscuna. I said that if the guy who you hired as a shipping manager doesn’t work out, please give me a call. Two weeks later I was hired and on January 1, 1989 we started the business up over at Melrose Place.”

Michael Cuscuna is something of a renaissance man. As writer, as producer-from artists as disparate as Bonnie Raitt, Dave Brubeck, the Art Ensemble of Chicago and Chris Smither-as Blue Note Records’ invaluable discographer, the man is everywhere. What is he like? Says Wenzel: “Michael is one of the great producers that has ever been on the scene. He knows what sounds good and how to get that sound. He is also one of the funniest people I know. Michael also has a sarcastic side, enjoys good movies and great food (the hotter the better).”

When asked how Michael and he decide on their next Mosaic project, Wenzel replies, “We just come up with an idea and search through a discography to see if there’s enough material to make at least four CDs. We also talk about how vital the music is and whether we feel it would sell enough copies.”

A lot of love and sweat goes into a Mosaic set. “First, it’s the idea and creation of the set,” says Wenzel. “Then there’s a tedious process of making up a ‘tune stack’ that shows each title along with the composer, publishers and timings. This is sent to the parent label (for example, Sony Music owns OKeh, Columbia, RCA, etc.) and we ask if we can submit our ‘tune stack.’ If it is approved we then hire a liner note writer, start looking for photos, and begin the transfer process with an engineer (or better translated as a restoration engineer). And since we are approved by the parent label, we now have access to the ‘vaults,’ which can unearth previously unissued gems as well as giving us access to the best sound possible. These sources come from either metal parts, test pressings or reel-to-reel tapes. Once these are transferred, the engineer will ‘clean’ them up and then send a ref copy for either Michael or I to listen to in case there are any flaws or omissions. Once that ref is approved, the engineer sends a master disc to the plant. The next order of business concerns the warehouse, which will receive boxes, booklets and either the CDs or LPs from the plant and then they start the collation process.”

What’s up ahead for Wenzel? “I am honored once again to speak at the annual Satchmo Summerfest in New Orleans (July 30-Aug. 2). I also will be a guest on Rich Conaty’s Sunday evening show, The Big Broadcast, over WFUV in New York on July 19th. At Mosaic I’m currently working on a James P. Johnson set as well as yet another Count Basie/Lester Young project.”

Not surprisingly, Mosaic’s  website is magnificent. You can also order an exquisite box set-at the moment a track from Duke Ellington: 1936-1940 Small Group Sessions is playing-by calling 203-327-7111.

 Cape Cod’s loss has been Planet Earth’s gain. After being the voice of jazz and the Great American Songbook for Southeastern Massachusetts from 1977 to the end of 2005, Dick Golden now broadcasts his absolutely perfect show, GW (George Washington University) Presents American Jazz, on Sirius XM Radio-beaming around the globe. For those who wish to bathe in the sounds of Lester Young, Frank Sinatra, Duke Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong, Dave McKenna, Rosemary Clooney, Tony Bennett, Sarah Vaughan, Ruby Braff, Dinah Washington, Coleman Hawkins and countless others, tune in on Saturdays at 10:00 a.m. on Channel 67, Real Jazz. (The show is rebroadcast on Mondays at 12:00 a.m.).

Dick Golden is a man whose work has always stirred deep passions. For over a quarter century, his WQRC evening show Nightlights was a staple of Cape Cod and Southern Massachusetts life, its seamless mingling of Jazz and the Great American Songbook heard in countless restaurants, taverns, cars, and homes. Golden’s in between song chats were always fascinatingly informative, like an enthusiastic friend sharing his bliss. Artists of the caliber of Tony Bennett, Frank Sinatra, and Rosemary Clooney were on record in considering Nightlights one of the America’s finest radio shows.

And Golden received letters from listeners-hundreds of them.

“I spend weekends and summers in my cottage in Orleans,” wrote one eloquent fan. “I purposely don’t have a television so that I can leave the nastiness of the world behind and allow the Cape to perform its transforming magic on my spirit. Nightlights-along with your intelligent, tasteful commentary-is probably the most important element in this transformation. I look forward to your show everyday and never am I disappointed.”

The poet Donald Hall once wrote of New England summer nights being woven together by radios broadcasting Red Sox games. Well, for 28 years Cape Cod was woven together by radios broadcasting the cream of American music, courtesy of Dick Golden. In addition, the gentleman was always willing to take part in charitable causes to aid his community.

In short, Dick Golden was irreplaceable.

However, in February 2005-for reasons that had nothing to do with ratings-WQRC scaled back Nightlights to weekends only. Mike Freedman-who at the time was George Washington University’s vice president for External Relations as well as Executive Producer of GW Presents American Jazz-offered Golden a full-time job. In March ’05 Golden made the move to Washington, D.C., but “returned to the Cape every couple of weeks to record weekend programs. I wrote to (the WQRC manager) in November and said I didn’t think I could be going back and forth because George Washington University’s responsibilities were ramping up.” Golden’s last Nightlights aired on Sunday, December 18, 2005. A golden era of Massachusetts radio had ended.

A talk with Dick Golden is a fascinatingly educational voyage, peppered with direct quotes from heroes as varied as Abraham Lincoln and Larry Hart. Ever wonder what song Cole Porter, in horrible pain, composed in his head after falling from a horse? Just ask Mr. Golden. Need proof? Well, listen to Dick’s story about the generosity of one Francis Albert.

“One adage I heard from my mother when I was young was that if you observe someone doing something well, tell them! Don’t hesitate because you feel you might be embarrassed or misunderstood. Share your admiration and you will feel wonderful when you do.”

These wise words led to Golden writing a congratulatory letter to Frank Sinatra after hearing that Old Blue Eyes was to be a Kennedy Center honoree. “It was a Saturday morning in August 1983. I went for a six mile jog through Hyannisport and in my mind I composed a thank you letter to Frank Sinatra. His music was such an integral and essential part of my broadcasting life.”

His jog over, Golden sat down and “within thirty minutes I had written a three page letter. I mentioned that for me, someone who came of age during the ascension of rock music-which had resulted in the American standard being marginalized and disappearing from the airwaves-it was Frank Sinatra who had introduced to another generation newly visualized versions of the great songs written by Cole Porter, the Gershwins, Irving Berlin, and others. I went to the post office, looked up the zip code for Rancho Mirage, California, put a stamp on the envelope, and dropped it in the out box. That’s it, I thought. Even though Frank Sinatra would never read the letter, I had the personal pleasure and glow that my mother had promised I would have after expressing my admiration to someone who did something meaningful in an extraordinary way.”

However, Sinatra did read Golden’s letter: “In October 1983 I found an envelope in my mailbox with a Los Angeles return address. The letter inside was written on Frank Sinatra stationary and it read:

October 6, 1983

Dear Richard:

I was deeply touched by your warm words about the upcoming Kennedy Center Honors. It was thoughtful of you to take time to share your thoughts with me. It’s always a joy to hear from the marvelous people who have supported my music throughout the years-and I love you all. Please let me know if I can do anything to help your station as a gesture of our thanks for your support and kind letter. Perhaps a holiday message to your listeners? I wish you and your loved ones a long, bountiful life brim full with happiness and good health.

Warmest Regards, Frank Sinatra

A few months later Golden received a cassette in the mail. Popping it in a player, he heard the “most recognizable voice of Frank Sinatra”:

“Testing, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Well, howdy, Dick. I guess you think I probably got lost…but I’ve been pretty busy and then I had some kind of a wild virus they couldn’t even find a name for for about five or six weeks, and that laid me up for a while. I had to cancel a bunch of one nighters and I’m picking them up now as I’m talking to you. Anyway, I thought what I would do is just kind of knock off some greeting for you, for your listeners, and then I think you can probably isolate them and put them on separate tracks. Let’s see, the first one you should have now…well, I guess it should be Christmas time.”

Without any prepared scripts, Mr. Sinatra knocked off one promo after another:

“Hi, everybody, this is Frank Sinatra, wanting to wish you, all your families, and all of your relatives a wonderful Christmas and I hope Santa Claus is good to all of you and God bless.”

Another said, “Hello there, everybody, this is Frank Sinatra, and I just like to say that I’m delighted that Dick Golden is playing my records from time to time on WQRC at 100 FM in Hyannis and I hope the signal is reaching all kinds of people way out on boats, submarines, dinghies, and all kinds of people. And we hope that you enjoy the music from time to time.”

“Howdy, folks, this is Francis Albert Sinatra talking to you from Hyannis, Massachusetts, where Dick Golden plays all the fine music of the great artists like Nat Cole and Duke Ellington and Lena Horne, and Count Basie and Louis Armstrong and everybody you can think of, including myself, which pleases me. Enjoy the music. It will keep you happy.”

Others followed, including messages for New Year’s and Mother’s Day. Years later, after Sinatra’s 1998 passing, Golden met the singer’s daughter, Nancy, at the opening of Tony and Susan Bennett’s Frank Sinatra School of the Arts in Astoria, Queens. Says Golden, “I said to Nancy that she probably has at least 100,000 stories that exemplify her father’s great generosity of spirit and charity-but I wanted to give her the 100,001th tale.” After telling her of her father’s taped messages, she asked Golden “to write up the story so she could post it on the Frank Sinatra Family website. It was personally very gratifying to share with his daughter-Nancy with the laughing face-the love and admiration I have for the artistry of Frank Sinatra.”

Dick Golden-who claims to be “a few years younger than Paul McCartney”-was born and raised in the late 1950s/early 1960s in Quincy, Massachusetts, the “City of Presidents.” Says Golden, “I had a great cultural advantage because so many of the masters of jazz, the creators of the American Songbook, and the greatest interpreters of this music were alive and still relevant in America’s popular culture.”

The gateway for Golden and millions of others to the riches of American music was…the radio. “Radio…the same instrument that opened the ears and imagination of a teenaged Frank Sinatra to the music of Bing Crosby and Rudy Valle. Radio…which carried his voice through the air when it was broadcast from the Rustic Inn in New Jersey where he worked as a singing waiter…The popularity of swing and the music of the Big Band era were fueled by the popularity of radio as it matured in the early to mid-1930s-the first ‘Golden Age of Radio.’

“I grew up in a home where radio was quite prevalent and as a kid it really captured my imagination. The sound of voices and music traveling through the air, and to me as a child, magically coming out of the radio speaker, never failed to intrigue and amaze me. The late 1950s was the time that traditional popular music stations were morphing into Top Forty formats but because the preference in my home was to listen to stations that featured Ella, Tony, Sinatra, et al., my ears were opened, at an early age, to well-crafted songs performed by artists who could communicate to listeners on more than just an audio level…who could make an emotional connection with the listener.

“I’m not sure exactly when the ambition crystallized for me, but sometime in my pre-teen years I had decided that this is what I would like to pursue in my life…to enjoy the solitude and low visibility of a radio studio and create programs that featured a body of music that was so creative and timeless and bought such joy and hope to listeners. In addition to a great knowledge and appreciation of music, the people I listened to on the radio all conveyed, through their words and the selections they played, a great sense of appreciation and respect for the radio audience. You are asking people for their most precious possession…their time.”

As one can tell by these words, Dick Golden is also a poet.

Golden nabbed his first radio job at an AM station in Portsmouth, New Hampshire while still in high school. Then while attending Northeastern University, he worked for two Boston radio stations, receiving valuable “big market” broadcasting experience before moving to Cape Cod. “In 1970 I moved to Falmouth on Cape Cod to become the first program director at WCIB. In June of 1972 I was given the opportunity to join Don Moore, founder and operator of WQRC in Hyannis.”

Don Moore, according to Golden, was an anomaly “in that the quality of the radio content was first and foremost (to him) and not how much revenue he could produce. He understood the unique radio market Cape Cod is–the pride of place so many residents have in that beautiful area. Don’s standards were very high.”

By February 1973 Golden was given the additional duty of creating and producing a weekly hour-long public affairs program. “For 10 years, each week, I was given the freedom to produce a radio magazine using Cape Cod as my source for stories and radio profiles. I got to interview Teddy Wilson, George Wein (who had established Storyville on Cape Cod for a few seasons in the early 1960s); Bobby Hackett (who lived in Chatham); Dave McKenna (who lived in Dennis); and Ruby Braff (who also lived in Dennis). With Jack Bradley and Marie Marcus we did the first radio promotion for the Cape Cod Jazz Society. Over the years other guests included Monica Dickens, great-granddaughter of Charles Dickens. She lived in Falmouth and I got to record and produce a radio version of A Christmas Carol with Monica narrating. For several years, on Christmas Eve, WQRC would feature a live broadcast of pianist Dave McKenna’s holiday concert at the Asa Bearse House on Main Street in Hyannis and then broadcast Monica Dickens’ production of A Christmas Carol.”

The “public service” aspect of Golden’s career afforded him countless unforgettable experiences. “I interviewed Walter Cronkite on his boat in Falmouth Harbor. With News Director Bob Seay, I was invited to an almost two hour one-on-one interview with Senator Ted Kennedy in the living room of the Hyannisport Compound and then had the Senator conduct a personal tour of that historical home. I also co-produced and co-hosted a Cape Cod Cancer Society tribute to actress Lee Remick, who lived part of the year on Cape Cod. The other host was actress Julie Harris, who lived in Chatham. This unforgettable evening was held at the historic Cape Playhouse in Dennis where Lee made her first starring stage appearance with Art Carney in The Seven Year Itch in the summer of 1956. Lee’s spirit inhabited every minute of the event. Roddy McDowell flew in from Hollywood to make a presentation. We had tribute letters from Gregory Peck, Jack Lemmon, Stephen Sondheim (Lee had appeared in Anyone Can Whistle) and Angela Landsbury.” Miss Remick-who this writer once saw in Boston’s Logan Airport looking too lovely for words-passed away from cancer in July 1991.

In addition, Golden served as host for Jazz Society of Cape Cod concerts; served on the board of the Cape Cod Symphony Orchestra; and was a charter member of the Pops By The Sea steering committee that first brought the Boston Pops Orchestra each August to Hyannis’ Village Green. “Among my duties in that project was to serve as program host for the underwriters’ event on the Saturday before the Sunday afternoon concert, and to introduce the honorary chairs for the event, which included Art Buchwald, Walter Cronkite, Joan Kennedy, Mike Wallace, Julia Child, and Beverly Sills. The project led to helping to create the Jazz By The Sea concerts we staged on the Friday night preceding the Sunday concert and we presented artists such as Carol Sloane, Herb Pomeroy, and the John Pizzarelli, Jr. Trio in their first Cape Cod concert.” Due to his public service work, Golden was made a Paul Harris Fellow by the Mid-Cape Rotary Club and honored by groups such as the Cape Cod NAACP, the Cape Cod Conservatory, the United Way of Cape Cod, and The Samaritans, among other organizations. “All of this commitment was a result of the deep appreciation I had for being able to live and work in such a unique and beautiful area like Cape Cod.”

When Duke Ellington died in May 1974, Golden approached his boss Don Moore with an idea: “I convinced Don (not a difficult task) that we should produce a three hour local tribute to this American Master. A friend who worked at WCBS radio in New York sent me the entire memorial service, which gave me some wonderful material (including the eloquent Stanley Dance eulogy) to mix with local interviews and, of course, Duke Ellington’s recorded music. When asking Don for his permission to create and air something that would preempt our regular programming, I thought I could appeal to him by saying, ‘Don, this is something I’m sure that we could get an institutional sponsor for and the station could gain revenue from this.’ His immediate response was, ‘Dick, we would never try and SELL something that is meant to be a tribute to a great and creative American Genius. Go ahead. You’ve got three hours.’ And this was the OWNER of the station!” Golden’s Ellington tribute went on to win a UPI Tom Phillips Award.

So it’s not surprising that in 1977 Moore approached Golden with an idea, a six evening a week, four hour an evening program that would feature “America’s music.” Says Golden, “Again, I was offered something that was more valuable than income and that was ‘freedom of expression’-the essence of the music I was allowed to play.” This Golden show premiered during Labor Day Weekend, 1977.

“One of the great coincidences of establishing the program in 1977,” says Golden, “was that Carl Jefferson had created his Concord Jazz label in California in 1973 and among the first artists signed were Cape Cod’s Dave McKenna and Providence, Rhode Island’s saxophone legend, Scott Hamilton. Soon other New Englanders like Jake Hanna, Carol Sloane, Gray Sargent, Ruby Braff, Lou Colombo, etc. were recording for the label and I had the great joy of being able to share with ‘hometown’ audiences the results of their masterpiece recordings. This all culminated with Carl Jefferson coming to Cape Cod in May of 1992 and I had the pleasure of hosting a Sunday called Concord All-Stars on Cape Cod. I not only got to welcome the guest artists but I also got to bring Carl Jefferson onstage and have him bask in the glow of an audience that was truly grateful that he recognized the major jazz talent that lived in the Cape Cod and Boston area.”

We Cape Codders lived in jazz heaven for quite a while, with Dave McKenna playing regularly at Dave Colombo’s Roadhouse Café. “What a joy,” recalls Golden, “to listen to anything Dave McKenna played, and then to get to know him. His sons Steve and Doug would come to the WQRC studios on occasion to watch me produce the evening program. Dave’s wife Frankie loved Pug dogs and asked me to please bring my pug Curly to the McKenna’s Dennisport home for a visit. She promised to have treats for him. The boys loved Curly and then Frankie said, ‘Dick, bring Curly out to the kitchen…I’ve cut up a jelly doughnut for him.’ While Curly was really going at the doughnut, Dave walked through the kitchen, stopped to gaze at my pug, and then I heard Curly emit a low growl. Dave came into the living room and said, ‘That’s a very smart dog you have. He knew with me in the room that he better be very protective of that doughnut!'”

In 1985 Don Moore sold WQRC and twelve years later a decision was made to scale back Nightlights to just weekends. Golden was “personally devastated” and the public sprang into action. “Hundreds of letters, phone calls, newspaper editorials, signed petitions of protests…all from an audience who for twenty years had found a radio beacon that featured jazz and American standards for four hours each evening. I have a 300 page book compilation of some of the material from that chapter of the story. It is still amazing to read the comments of how important this music is to listeners’ lives.” Among the people who wrote letters were Tony Bennett, Carly Simon, Willie Nelson, Michael Feinstein, Billy May, Bette Midler, Lionel Hampton, George Shearing and the wonderful singer, Susannah McCorkle. Nightlights was restored to its traditional schedule.

It is no surprise that Tony Bennett wrote a passionate letter for Nighlights-for not only is Mr. Bennett a connoisseur of artistic excellence in all its forms, but he is also one of Dick Golden’s closest friends. “Tony Bennett’s personal friendship is something that I count among my greatest treasures,” says Golden. “He is like a wise and caring brother. I’ve known him for over 30 years and each time we talk, I learn something new…I become inspired to read a book, or to look at a painting, or to listen to a piece of music he might suggest.

“One of the most influential books in Tony’s life is painter Robert Henri’s The Art Spirit. It has offered Tony an insight into what every great artist must do to realize the limits of their gifts: to observe nature, which leads to a deep passion for all things living. I have a copy Tony gave me and it is a continual source of insight and inspiration.

“When Tony is home (at his Central Park South apartment) he spends as much time as possible in his painting studio. Two of the four books he’s written are art books. He is as dedicated to painting as he is to singing. He has three paintings in Smithsonian museums. His Ella is part of the National Museum of American History. His Duke ‘God is Love’ painting is part of the permanent collection of the National Portrait Gallery, and he has murals of Central Park at the Renwick Gallery.”

Golden introduced this writer to Mr. Bennett backstage at Boston’s Symphony Hall in 1994. One is struck immediately by the legend’s sincere kindness. It is heartening to know that some geniuses are as good-hearted as they are gifted.

Tony Bennett, by all accounts, is one of those unique human beings (Duke Ellington was another) who simply cannot stop being creative. “One day,” says Golden, “Tony called and told me that he was in his art studio working on a painting of Abraham Lincoln with Turner Classic Movies on in the background. That’s Entertainment was showing and Tony was thrilled at the performances he saw by Fred Astaire, Judy Garland, and Frank Sinatra. Later in the afternoon he wanted to continue reading Roger Housden’s How Rembrandt Reveals Your Beautiful Imperfect Self. He is a natural teacher and a natural lifelong student. (Recently) he fulfilled a long time ambition to create a sculpture. He believes that learning some of the mechanics of the process would better inform his painting. His first sculptured creation was a bust of his longtime friend, Harry Belafonte.”

Tony’s roots, according to Golden, are beyond deep. “The first source of his inspiration to sing and paint was a wonderful, close, and loving family (in Astoria, Queens). His dad died when Tony was ten and his mother raised the three Benedetto children-he had an older sister, Mary, and brother, John-instilling in them not only a set of high personal standards, but also with a great sense of justice.

“(Bennett’s) brother John told me one time that he had gone into the Second World War a few years before Tony joined the Army and was sent to the front lines. Upon returning, the brothers had a long discussion about their shared anger and frustration over segregation in the armed forces. ‘How could we send men into battle to preserve freedom, and then have them denied that freedom by segregation of the troops while in service and…deep segregation upon their return home?’ The brothers agreed that it was their mother and their family who had instilled this deep sense of justice within them.”

With the release of the film Selma, a new generation will learn of the bravery of the men and women who took part in the three marches, led by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama in March, 1965. Taking part in this historic march-which helped usher in the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965–were Dr. King’s friends Tony Bennett and Harry Belafonte. Golden tells a beautiful story of Tony performing for the marchers one night. “Of course, there was no stage-everyone was standing or sitting in a field in Alabama–but a local undertaker provided an empty wooden coffin and Tony stood on it to sing.”

Mr. Bennett’s strong desire to give back to his community continues to this day. Says Golden, “Just as Tony derived strength, values, ambition, and much love and security from his family as he grew up, today his family is the center of his universe. His wife Susan is devoted to helping to create just the perfect environment for Tony to focus on his passions of singing and painting. She and Tony have also created the shining light of performing arts high schools in New York City, The Frank Sinatra School of the Arts, located in Astoria, Queens, Tony’s hometown. In addition to guiding the school, their foundation, Exploring the Arts-Tony Bennett’s foundation for Arts Education-is now subsidizing arts programs in 17 public high schools in New York and Los Angeles.”

With a warm smile, Golden says, “As a radio host, I owe so much to Mr. Bennett because he helps infuse such a great spirit into any program when you include one of his tracks. So often I’ve been asked by listeners, ‘Does Tony Bennett write those songs he sings?’ His honesty/authenticity is so believable that listeners sometime can’t distinguish the singer from the song. To me that’s a grand slam homerun. Louis Armstrong, the father of jazz singing…captured Tony’s gift so accurately when he observed, ‘If Tony Bennett, who sing-swings wonderfully, can’t send you, there’s a psychiatrist right up the street from you. DIG him.'”

And like Louis Armstrong, Tony Bennett is as fine a human being as he is an artist. Says Golden, “Tony Bennett has been my model and inspiration for my career in radio. His uncompromisingly high standards and his quest to record only great songs-and to bring to his live performances a spirit and joy that is so uplifting to the human spirit-has been the goal I’ve set for myself in producing radio programs. His friend, the pianist Bill Evans (with whom he recorded two classic albums), told New York radio personality William B. Williams, ‘Every great jazz musician I know idolizes Tony Bennett. From Philly Joe Jones to Miles Davis, you name it. He puts music first, and has dedicated himself to it. He has great respect for music and musicians and that comes through, and it’s just a joy to work with someone like that.'”

How has Bennett’s dedication to music translated to Golden’s radio work? “Each time you have the privilege to sit before a mic and choose music to create a program, you should always use great care in what you play…and say. I don’t talk very much between selections except to give the essential information a listener would want. Once you say, ‘Here’s the Duke Ellington Orchestra,’ get out of the way and play the music. What possibly could you say that would enhance the listener’s experience? When the selection is over you might say, ‘October 1957, Duke Ellington’s Orchestra featuring Johnny Hodges on saxophone, and Duke’s composition, “Prelude to a Kiss.”‘ By giving this information you’re acting in service to the music and the listener.”

According to Golden, the latest chapter in Mr. Bennett’s career-his best-selling album and sold-out performances with Lady Gaga-is part of his life-long ambition: “to expose young audiences to music they have little access to. The airwaves have abandoned, for the most part, jazz and American standards. This causes consternation with Tony because he believes we are being denied access to our great American musical heritage. He believes when we study jazz and its roots in the African-American experience we are learning about the struggles of a people and how this music is an extension of their experience. As President Clinton once said of jazz, it is a form of music that ‘was forged in great pain, but played with great joy.’ And it is not only the music young people are hearing when they hear/see Tony and Lady, but it is the message of these songs: ‘Love is funny or it’s sad…it’s a good thing or it’s bad…but beautiful.’ Or when they sing Nat Cole’s ‘Nature Boy’: ‘…the greatest thing you’ll ever learn is just to love…and be loved in return.’ Then there’s the style…the clothes…the dance steps, the obvious joy and respect they have for the music, each other, and the audience. It’s a joy to witness.”

Who was Dick Golden’s first radio interview? “It was August 1962,” he recalls, “and I was working at WBBX AM in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Count Basie had been appearing at the Hampton Beach Casino. I did some background research but I knew I was not adequately qualified to ask questions of such a giant.

“I brought my Wollensak tape recorder to the main ballroom at the appointed time and after the first set-which was electrifying-Basie’s road manager came to me, then brought me to the Count, saying, ‘Here’s the kid from the radio station who wants to interview you.’ I don’t know what Basie must have thought. He and the band were on their way to Los Angeles to record their first studio album with Frank Sinatra…and here’s some kid…” However, Basie was generous and friendly. “He suggested we find a quiet dressing room for our talk and on the way stopped at a little clam stand and insisted on buying me an order of fried clams and a soft drink. Once we began the interview, I took out my list of questions and with a quivering voice began… Now with those amazing ears of his, he could hear and sense my nervousness but instead of the short, concise answers he usually gave-he spoke like he played: every note or every word spoke volumes-to assist me he gave long and loquacious responses. He treated me with such respect you’d have thought I was Ralph Gleason or Nat Hentoff interviewing this international giant. When the interview was over, he then recorded two or three station IDs and asked that I rewind the tape and listen to the first fifteen seconds, just to make sure everything was recorded.”

And as the years flowed past, with Golden interviewing musical immortals such as Dave Brubeck, Sonny Rollins, and Oscar Peterson, he realized that America’s jazz artists share a common quality: “They are deeply spiritual people.” In fact, Golden asked Oscar Peterson the question: You knew Basie for such a long time and were such close friends. Would you describe him as a spiritual person?

Mr. Peterson, growing quite emotional, replied, “Well, let me tell you something. Bill was such a kind and humble person. He was like a brother to me and when my wife and I had the joy of our first child, I invited Basie over to the house. When he arrived, I handed him our little baby. Basie cuddled her in his arms and as I looked at him with that little angel, the only thing I could think of was a classic painting of the Madonna and child.” (When Golden told this story to Tony Bennett, the singer replied, “That image would make a great painting!”)

Like any person of substance, Dick Golden is resilient. Despite being “personally devastated” by the demise of Nightlights-(believe me, he wasn’t alone)-he came back swinging. A life-long New Englander, he packed his bags and moved to our nation’s capital to work at George Washington University.

“When I arrived GWU was the venue for the daily broadcasting of CNN’s Cross Fire. This led to other national television productions that our office was involved in producing. The school’s location, which the founders in 1821 said would always be our greatest endowment, is four blocks from the White House and up the street from the National Mall and all the Smithsonian museums.

“There is such a great vitality at the university…year round…and our office gets to interact with some wonderful students and faculty and many other offices within GWU. It’s a community of about 30,000 people. And so much of my work is in External Relations/Office of Events in addition to producing the weekly radio program.

“When Sirius merged with XM, GW Presents American Jazz was now broadcast twice each weekend on the Real Jazz Channel. The Sirius audience is involved and smart! It’s a joy to receive their feedback and as a radio listener, I very much enjoy several of their channels.”

So how does one prepare a satellite radio show? Says Golden, “I usually spend one or two weekend days recording the program in a small radio station at the university. It’s quiet at that time and I’m usually free from my other responsibilities as a member of the Office of University Events. I try to work about a month in advance of programs airing. Unlike the Cape Cod program, which was listened to by people in the same time zone, I do try to keep in mind that when the program first airs (Saturday, 10 am. to noon EST), that the audience is listening in three different time zones (so) their lives have a variety of rhythms and patterns.

“If there are historic tie-ins (the birthday of a composer or jazz icon), I will create a theme around that subject. I think of the program like a jazz performance. You start the set with a few tunes you know you’re going to include and as you listen-(I’m recording the program in real time which means I get to listen to each track)-you often become inspired in your choice of the next couple of selections.”

How refreshing to hear! How different in tone and philosophy from most of the rest of music radio-forced by demographics to play the same mechanical, soulless tunes ad nauseam.

“What guides me in my programming choices,” says Golden, “in addition to listener comments, are the music philosophies of Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington, which have formed my principles. It was Louis who said, ‘What we play is life. The memory of things gone by is important to a jazz musician. Things like old folks singing in the moonlight in the back yard on a hot night or something said long ago.’ And then Duke Ellington: ‘What is music to you? What would you be without music? Music is everything. Nature is music (cicadas in the tropical night). The sea is music; the wind is music. The rain drumming on the roof and the storm raging in the sky are music. Music is the oldest entity. The scope of music is immense and infinite.'” As these quotes show, Pops and Duke were poets of words as well as notes.

A year after Golden joined GW Presents American Jazz, he and Mike Freedman received a conference call from Tony Bennett. “I was taking (his beloved pug) Curly for a walk along Barnstable Harbor, Mike was at this GW office, and Tony was at his New York City apartment. Tony suggested we produce a program that would feature profiles of a group of iconic Americans-everyone from pianist Bill Evans to entertainer Jimmy Durante. He suggested we call the program GW Presents Beyond Category. The series ran on the XM Fine Tuning channel and we created about 50 two-hour programs with themes that included the music of The Gershwins, Billy Strayhorn, Duke Ellington, Nat King Cole, Johnny Carson, Abraham Lincoln, Tony’s great friend, the portrait artist Everett Raymond Kinstler, Quincy Jones, Cole Porter, Count Basie, Yip Harburg, Louis Armstrong, Harold Arlen, Bobby Hackett, WC Handy, Billie Holiday, Fred Astaire, Ella Fizgerald, etc. An essential part of most of the programs was interview comments from Tony. These people are among the ones who nourished his talent and his life.” Not surprisingly, the show was honored at the 2008 New York Festivals International Radio Broadcasting Awards.

Golden is understandably proud of what he’s accomplished at George Washington University-and of the school itself. “We often say that our campus is four blocks from the White House-but we are also only four blocks from Ward Place, the birthplace of Edward Kennedy “Duke” Ellington, (who was born) on April 29, 1899. The university offered the first classroom space to what has become the Duke Ellington School of the Arts in Georgetown.” Alumni of the Duke Ellington School include opera star Denise Graves and comedian Dave Chappelle.

Golden gives a great deal of credit to Dr. Steven Knapp, the president of George Washington University. “He is not only a scholar and university administrator, but also a jazz percussionist and a firm advocate of the humanities being a part of our students’ experience while attending GWU. Dr. Knapp is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and he just recently concluded a project that resulted in GW acquiring the historic 1869 Corcoran Gallery.”

Shortly after Dr. Knapp became the university’s sixteenth president in August 2007, he offered GW’s Jack Morton Auditorium “as a venue to launch Jazz Appreciation Month, which was founded by Dr. John Edward Hasse, the Smithsonian’s Curator of American Music.” Others may know Dr. Hasse as the author of the essential 1993 biography Beyond Category: The Life and Genius of Duke Ellington (Da Capo Press).

Says Golden, “The launch (of Jazz Appreciation Month) included an appearance by pianist Ramsey Lewis. The GW Presents American Jazz program features Smithsonian guests during the four weekends in April and gives us a chance to spread the word to a national radio audience of the vitality of the music. Dr. Hasse brings his wide range of experience and knowledge to these programs, and they also give us a chance to air selections by the Smithsonian Jazz Masterworks Orchestra. As the relationship has grown, Dr. Knapp has collaborated with the Smithsonian to produce two concerts at Lisner Auditorium that are free and open to our students and (folks from the) Foggy Bottom neighborhood. We have an exceptional jazz faculty in our music department and our students perform at the Kennedy Center, the State Department, and other DC venues. They are also very engaged in Jazz Appreciation Month.” Mr. Golden was also asked to narrate Aaron Copeland’s Lincoln Portrait with the Air Force Concert Orchestra at DAR Constitution Hall. “This was an extension of my work with The Airmen of Note Air Force Jazz group that sponsors a jazz heritage series hosted by GWU and open free to the GW and Foggy Bottom community.”

Yes, it’s safe to say that Dick Golden, with passion and resilience, has done quite well since leaving Cape Cod.

Oh, and if this isn’t enough, Golden also produces a weekly three hour program called The American Songbook for the NPR station along Florida’s Treasure Coast, WQCS (88.9 FM and on line at WQCS.org). This equally essential program airs on Saturdays from 8-11 pm following Prairie Home Companion.

Oh, and sorry for keeping you waiting. Mr. Golden? “In October 1937, in great pain and stress after being thrown from a horse, while waiting for help, Cole Porter in his head composed, ‘At Long Last Love.'”

As he dives in to prepare yet another glorious show of the very best of American music, Golden wraps up our interview by saying, “Again, I love the Louis Armstrong quote-because it captures what I’ve always tried to present to a radio audience: ‘What we play is life.'” ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912203991.44/warc/CC-MAIN-20190325133117-20190325155117-00121.warc.gz

 Composer, drummer, leader, conductor LaFrae Sci led her band the 13th Amendment? on a triumphant series of concerts in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, Russia on June 27, 28 and 29. The shows, all sell-outs, featured Sci’s “orchestral jazz piece” of Mikhail Bulgakov’s oft-banned novel The Master and Margarita.

“The novel was published in Russia 27 years after Bulgakov’s death,” says Sci. “Before that, single copies were smuggled into the country and up to 100 people would share one copy, having only 36 hours each with the book before passing it on.” The success of Sci and her band’s concerts is amazing given that The Master and Margarita was “rebanned in Russian schools as of July 1, 2014,” by Vladimir Putin, reportedly because of its author’s use of “profanity.”

The Master and Margarita Meets Jazz, according to its creator, “is often called an opera because of the vocal component, but there is more improvisation than words in the whole suite of themes.”

The 13th Amendment? consists of Alex Blake on upright bass, Brandee Younger on harp, Mazz Swift on violin and vox, Micah Gaugh on alto sax and vox, Tamar Kali on vox and conductor/composer Sci on drums.

“The project,” says Sci, “was two years of writing, teaching and organizing on my part in concert with a team of young, supportive Siberian women, all under 26 years of age, who helped me navigate the political landscape to build this [series of concerts] from nothing in a part of Russia that does not have an established jazz tradition.”

Bulgakov (1891-1940) worked on his masterpiece from 1928-1940, but The Master and Margarita was not published in book form until 1967. The novel describes a visit by Satan to Moscow during the 1917 revolution. When a young Mick Jagger read it in 1968, he was reportedly inspired to write the lyrics to “Sympathy for the Devil.”

Says Sci, “The deputy minister of culture presented to me her grandfather’s copy of The Master and Margarita and thanked me for bringing my culture and Russian culture together in a beautiful way, and inspiring Russians to re-read this book, as our concerts were sold out two weeks prior to the show, and was probably the most talked-about concert of the season.”

The composer took a page from the Beatles, circa January 1969, London: “We also organized the first rooftop concert in the Krasnoyarsk region. We hooked up with a meditation center that had a beautiful fenced-in rooftop. I made a deal to charge for tickets, and all the money earned after my budget was met would be for them, and they would have the added benefit of new people discovering their center. We hired Siberian musicians, rehearsed and we advertised it as an interactive concert.”

In a world rife with violence and ethnic tension, LaFrae Sci was proving true Louis Armstrong’s dictum: “Music doesn’t know hatred; music doesn’t know prejudice. It’s just them notes.”

“People brought pots, pans, guitars, drums,” continues Sci. “We played Mary Lou Williams, Duke Ellington. I got folks to sing, and we did an arrangement of ‘Wade in the Water’ that went into the trad Russian tune ‘Kalinka Malinka.’ I started playing balalaika for this arrangement. We had over 200 people attend, and I was able to pay my band and myself. This was a great thing to me as I discovered once already here that one of the quiet effects of the sanctions is the sabotage of Visa/MasterCard. I hadn’t had access to my bank account since June 2, but I was able to live off the cash from our rooftop success! The sanctions also affected international bank transfers. JP Morgan Chase stopped doing business with the Russian federal bank a few months ago. There were some nail-biting moments, but it all worked out.”

So how did this globetrotting, barrier-smashing musician develop? In an interview with The Independent Ear, Sci says: “I moved to New York City with $600, a drumset and a backpack of clothes. My foundation is church to blues to jazz, but I’m an Air Force kid, born in Okinawa, and traveling for my whole life. I also spent early years in dance studios as my mom was a choreographer for the Dayton Contemporary Dance Company in the ’70s. Lots of drumming there. Later Mom was the director of the Paul Lawrence Dunbar House for over 20 years, and tours with a solo presentation of the African American elocutionist, Halley Q. Brown. I studied political theory and economics at Oberlin, and did several internships in D.C. before I was inextricably bitten by a love of swing, jazz and drumming. I mention these details to suppose that the sum total of those experiences led me to become a cultural ambassador, composer, educator, bandleading drummer, firmly rooted in the tradition, with a developed sense of myself, and my place in the world as an African American woman.”

In an interview with this writer, Sci says, “The musicians that motivate and inspire me were the ones who not only sought to preserve their cultural heritage and legacy, but also used the music to protest, inspire and build within communities: AACM, BAG, Max Roach, Abbey Lincoln, Mary Lou Williams, Art Blakey, Sonny Rollins. These musicians showed me that it was possible to change the world with jazz.”

LaFrae Sci not only “changes the world with jazz” through her global performances, but also with her teaching. She is an educational consultant for Jazz at Lincoln Center, having co-written (with pianist/educator Eli Yamin) the curriculum for JALC’s Middle School Jazz Academy. She explains: “Most people teach, or play. Or play a lot and teach a little. Sometimes I feel invisible because I’ve made a commitment to both, and I focus much of my work educationally with middle and lower grade school kids. You can turn on middle school kids to the point where they can be equally as conversant about swing and Duke Ellington as they are about Lil Wayne.”

Yet although sometimes working within the system, Sci has also found a way to transcend the system. “I have made a journey of working with jazz outside of the confines designed to ensure its survival-outside of the educational structures, summer camps, universities, festivals, competitions and corporate structures who by their very nature create systems. The challenge for the young musician is to figure out a way to take jazz beyond these systems. I personally couldn’t imagine a career of flying to the different parts of the world again and again, only to see the same cats at the festival bar that I could see where I live in New York City.”

Hence the swinging gig with local folks on the rooftop of a meditation center in Siberia!

So how does a gifted jazz musician become a musical ambassador? As Sci told The Independent Ear, “Initially I auditioned for the program that is formerly known as the Jazz Ambassador program that first sent Louis Armstrong and Dizzy Gillespie to showcase this beautiful Jazz music of ours that embodies the very best of what America can be…democratic, and free.” She has visited over 30 countries for our State Department. “The world loves the blues, and every culture has their blues. I teach the folk music of my culture, and in turn I learn other folk traditions. The whole world respects the concept of tradition in some way. This is a real great starting point. Additionally, the music builds a community in the moment, connecting cultures, generations and experiences. The response has been exponentially positive as social media facilitates international connection. One example is getting 75 friend requests from Montenegrin middle school students who are now finishing college, or getting married and still say hello.”

And throughout this discussion, let’s not forget the fact that LaFrae Sci is one fiercely swinging drummer: “I discovered that the blues connects to audiences all over the world. I suspect it’s because everybody gets the blues. In teaching about this music to international audiences, I always have to go back to the source of the blues, which runs right into the spirituals. I decided I wanted to experience singing these songs with my main voice-the drums. In my own way I’m reclaiming the drums to the tradition. I can only imagine the reason why the spiritual tradition is drum-less is because the drum was taken away (during the period of slavery in the American South). The 13th Amendment? is about freedom. We take this approach musically. The 13th Amendment?: It’s jazz, it’s funk, it’s blues, it rocks, it swings, it’s free.”

If you doubt these words, go to 13th Amendment to see and hear the 13th Amendment? live in Paris. This is truly one beautiful, intense, impossible-to-pigeonhole band at the peak of its powers.

While sitting in a Moscow airport in June, waiting for a connecting flight back to New York, Sci poured out her feelings: “At the same time, the romance of the jazz ambassadors is long gone. The foundation laid by Louis Armstrong, Dizzy Gillespie and Dave Brubeck has been reduced to an international exchange program where the young artists from any genre play for embassy parties and events while putting pretty photos on social media. I realized it was over for jazz and the State Department when I saw that the State Department sent a band of Caucasian men with no Brazilian heritage to West Africa to share the folk tradition of Northeast Brazil. I know this sounds like some sort of ironic recolonization joke, but it’s not.

“To be fair, the State Department’s use of jazz internationally was not because of some enlightened moment of government clarity; it was because jazz was the message of the moment. In its own words, jazz was ‘a sonic secret weapon.’ So the challenge I lay to young cats in university programs is how can you create something outside of the systems? I traveled to North Africa with a conscious hip-hop band. (The very fact that the word conscious has to be used to legitimize hip-hop shows its flaw, in my opinion). As a child of the early ’80s, I was fascinated to see the original spirit of hip-hop culture being cultivated as free expression in Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco. However, the evolution of hip-hop culture in the U.S.A. is more troubling to me than the ‘extinction’ of jazz given its present day incarnation of excess, misogyny and anti-intellectualism. Additionally, if one is teaching internationally about the evolution of hip-hop, it’s inevitable to go back to jazz and the blues. Herein lies the opportunity for jazz I have discovered. People internationally really respect culture.”

The June 2014 shows were not Sci’s first visit to Siberia. “I first traveled to Siberia on a tour of Russia with my friend Eli Yamin’s band. We played a few festivals and did the obligatory 4th of July party at the ambassador’s residence. While in Siberia I met some kindred spirits who were curious about the type of improvisation and African American culture masterclasses I conduct. They invited me back the following December and arranged for me to teach masterclasses at a few conservatories, music schools and music stores.

“While there I connected with a talented pianist, Katya Kateva, who is the director of a fledgling jazz department at a music college in Krasnoyarsk. Katya had little support because jazz is often viewed as party or club music. Russia has such a longstanding academic music tradition [yet] Katya has been fighting an uphill battle for resources, students and support. At the same time, I started reading The Master and Margarita. As I read this powerful book, I started to hear some musical themes and I wrote them down, made some mock-up Mp3s, and sent them to Katya, who said she liked the music. I then imagined a collaborative project where I could teach students, help Katya’s jazz department and bring my band to Krasnoyarsk, [which] is not one of the most open parts of Siberia. Other parts have a longstanding connection to jazz [but] Krasnoyarsk opened to the West in the ’90s.

“I returned to Krasnoyarsk a few more times, teaching more improvisation masterclasses. The Ministry of Culture sent me last summer to a camp 10 hours out of the main city. I had an outhouse and had to bathe in a river, but also had an amazing time teaching these students spirituals like ‘Wade in the Water,’ ‘Oh, Freedom,’ and rhythms that they incorporated into their daily evening performances. I wasn’t paid for this work, but I was already in Europe, and I thought by doing a solid for the ministry they would be game for my proposal.

“Fortunately, I had a team of young visionaries in the ministry who guided me and the project through the political minefield. At the end of that summer [2013], the project was approved, and I then met with the teachers at the music college to show them my scores. I have photos. It was an intense meeting-the teachers of each department were being asked to commit his/her students to this project for the year, as the music was going to become part of the curriculum. They scrutinized my instrumentation. Teacher: ‘We have no bassoon.’ Me: ‘Okay, cool.’ Teacher: ‘You didn’t write for marimba?’ Me: ‘Okay, I will write a marimba part,’ and so on. They were concerned that my music was too difficult for the students. They were afraid of the ‘jazz.’ Teacher: ‘Our students do not improvise.’ Me: ‘Okay, I will teach them.’ It was on and agreed to.

“I returned to Krasnoyarsk about every three months after that and rehearsed with the students and checked in on their progress. All rehearsals were like mini-masterclasses. I taught blues expression, form and used Butch Morris-inspired conduction. I emailed Katya new music as I finished it, and she rehearsed the student ensemble every week from October 2013 until June 2014.

“In December 2013 I wrote then Ambassador Michael McFaul and told him about the project, and asked if the embassy could lend support in any way. He wrote me back in 30 minutes, then cc’d his staff. I appreciated their support, but the U.S.A. only put in one-sixth of what Russian sources allocated. This project became the perfect marriage of U.S. and Russian culture. I’ve been on Russian television maybe 10 times, and had countless interviews written. It was interesting to them. They asked, ‘Why Siberia and not Moscow or St. Petersburg? Why the music college and not the philharmonic? Why Bulgakov? How can you write from this perspective and not be Russian?'”

Now back home in Brooklyn, her triumph complete, what are Sci’s most prized accomplishments from this historical collaboration?

She says:
“*I developed my composing chops by getting to write for an orchestra for a whole year;
“*This project connected segments of the community with other segments that have never previously connected;
“*My students learned to ask questions, something that traditional academic music education does not encourage;
“*I put Jazz on a serious stage in Siberia, with lights, orchestra, choirs and my band-taking Jazz out of the stereotypical ‘club’ presentation;
“*Katya says that enrollment is up for her Jazz program, a result of this project;
“*I know, and my students now know, that anything is possible. Today a friend emailed and said, ‘You created something new in Russia! No challenge can be too big now.’
“*The fact that this even happened given the political environment, and that The Master and Margarita was banned in Russian schools as of July 1, 2014.”

LaFrae Sci wrapped up her Moscow musings by saying: “I know that anything is possible…and that jazz is the answer.”

In these troubled times, we are fortunate to have a musician, a composer, an artist as gifted, fearless and open-hearted as LaFrae Sci.

My excuse for not voting for Dizzy Gillespie for president in 1964? I was only five years old.

Maybe it’s time to allow our artists to run our world. ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912203438.69/warc/CC-MAIN-20190324103739-20190324125739-00536.warc.gz
67,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/inservice/bill-cherry-jazz-bartender/,"Bill Cherry, former bartender at NYC jazz clubs Bill Cherry was a legendary jazz bartender, who fell in love with this music in the late 1950s and began serving drinks soon thereafter to such giants as Charles Mingus and Kenny Dorham at a Lower East Side hangout, the Annex. From there he moved through the jazz clubs of the era, attracting a loyal following of musicians and fans until 1990, when he retired from jazz, eventually relocating to New Hampshire to work with his other great love-Harley-Davidson motorcycles.  He was unique in his passion for the music, his admiration of the artists he served, and in being one of the very few African-American bartenders in jazz.

Bill Cherry :

I became a fan of jazz music in high school.  Word went around that Clifford Brown had died and I didn’t know who he was. I could tell that he was a respected and important figure, the way people were talking, but I was not familiar with his music or modern jazz music at all-I was into doo wop, swing, and R& B, of course, music like that. So people were talking about what a great trumpet player he was. Well, I managed to find some Savoy records, checked them out and fell in love with the music. That whole era, the bebop era, was pretty special, the sound really drew me in. To this day, bebop is my main love.

As I said, I was still in high school, George Washington High, living with my family in Inwood, Manhattan, around 200th Street, when my buddies and I began to explore the jazz world. We went to Minton’s Playhouse, Birdland, and the Palladium-where we heard some great Latin music; one of my first girlfriends was Latin and through her I became exposed to that music and loved that also. None of us had much money, but we managed to get around. I had a part-time job and with the money I earned I was able to go out and hear some great live jazz. We were just  kids though and couldn’t afford much. I remember Pee Wee Marquette at Birdland, one of his jobs was to get people to drink. So, after he was done announcing the band, he’d walk the room and if you weren’t drinking or didn’t have a drink right in your hand, he’d say, “Step up to the bar, step up to the bar,” and literally push you up against the bar to get you to spend some money-you’d look around to see who’d done that and you couldn’t see him. He was an obnoxious little guy, but he was so little there was nothing a person could do about it-you couldn’t hit him or nothing.  Anyway, that was part of his job.  You can hear that voice of his on a lot of live Blue Note albums, he’s on quite a few of mine.

Of course I saw and heard Count Basie at Birdland-with the big band with Sonny Payne, a phenomenal big band drummer; that was a memorable experience. And I was fortunate enough to have heard Bud Powell at Birdland once; when I decided to go that night I didn’t even realize-I was so young-that this was a true giant that I was going to hear. I heard Lambert, Hendricks and Bavan; it wasn’t Ross at the time, she’d gotten hung up in Europe, jammed up with some papers or something, but this was quite a group.  I would go out to hear music by bands I didn’t know, too. But I loved the sound. Then I’d buy the albums. Some of my favorites were ones by Jackie McLean, Donald Byrd, Milt Jackson, and George Wallington. George had the theme song “The Peck,” I bought the album with that on it. Something about that music just touched me.

I bought quite a few albums at the barber shop south of me down in Harlem where my friend Fred got his hair cut. This place was around 126th Street, and in those days it was a typical occurrence to be offered goods for sale in barber shops. People would come in with their wares and you could buy all kinds of things; it was quite something. So in the back room, a guy had all these Blue Note LPs for sale-major names like Jo Jones, Art Blakey, Philly Jo Jones, and Max Roach. I bought one record there by Philly Joe that stands out in my memory today: Blues for Dracula .I still have these LPs. I guess I have about 500 LPs, mono, hi fi, stereo, today.  These experiences were the beginning of my exposure to jazz and I was lucky to see and hear some of the very best.

Eventually I ended up on the Lower East Side (a marriage had broken up), and at that point my whole lifestyle changed. I moved to that area because I was poor, and I was studying modern dance; I got into it pretty seriously for a while, taking classes and so forth.  I began bartending because working at night allowed me to take more of these classes during the day. I studied with people from the Alvin Ailey Dance Theatre and others, but I started too late, already in my 20s, to become a good enough dancer to perform professionally.  Still, I did get quite a bit of attention and encouragement while I was involved with it.

ALPHABET CITY

It was a great jazz neighborhood (it was referred to as Alphabet City in those days), with Slugs, the Five Spot and St. Marks Playhouse around, for example. I worked at the Annex over on 10th Street for a few years, a local bar in an area where a number of great musicians lived.  It got its name because it was owned by the same people who owned the Ninth Circle, a bohemian bar in the West Village. We had a barrel of free peanuts in the shell for customers. Mingus lived over on Fifth Street, and he would come in at five or six o’clock before going to work or just to have a drink. He liked a big drink so I served him in the mixing glass rather than a highball glass, and we’d shoot the breeze. We talked about his music some. I told him once, “I’d love to see your dreams-what you dream about.”That was because his music was so out there for the time: you know, Mingus Ah Um,The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady, that music was  very different than what you’d hear even in jazz. I am not a musician, although I did study some piano as a kid, so we did not talk in depth about music. I am a fan of the music. I told Mingus as I have told every musician I have met how much I appreciated the sacrifices he had made for jazz. He’d sit there for an hour or so, eat some peanuts and then go on home. “Nice to talk to you,” we’d say and that was it. Kenny Dorham lived in the area and would stop by periodically. Jackie McLean would be around, too. That was around the time he was doing The Connection, a great movie and play that he was in and that was rehearsing at that time, and the musicians would come into the Annex. So I knew all of them-everyone came through there at one time or another.

The bar became a place for musicians to hang out and I really enjoyed serving them.  Quite a number of artists lived on the Lower East Side because the rents had gotten so high in the Greenwich Village area. But it also drew people from other areas. One day I was passing through the room on my way to the bar and I saw a striking-looking woman sitting at a table with a young couple.  So I walked over and said, “How’d you find this place?” She turned to me and I recognized that she was Melina Mercouri-Never on Sunday had just come out and luckily I had seen it-a  wonderful movie. Anyway, she said in her great Greek accent, “I smelled it!” I’m not the type to bother people, so I just made my comment and walked on to the bar.

Another high point in those early years was being invited to the recording session for Oliver Nelson’s “Blues and the Abstract Truth.” George Barrow, he played with David Amram quite a bit, invited me to that session. George was a neighbor when I lived over on Tenth Street (Morgan Freeman was another neighbor in our artists’ complex on Tenth Street). He played baritone.  Sitting in that studio, watching those giants, hearing them create that incredible music, was a great, fantastic experience, and one I will never forget.

While I was still at the Annex, I occasionally subbed behind the bar at Slugs. A friend was managing the room and asked me if I would fill in for a few shifts. So I got the chance to hear Hank Mobley, Freddie Hubbard, Lee Morgan, people like that, live at Slugs. Lee Morgan died at Slugs, that’s part of jazz history, but not on a night I was working there. He did perform there a lot.

PEEWEE’S & THE NEEDLE’S EYE

From there I went over to 13th Street to a place called Peewee’s, still on the Lower East Side, and they had live music as well.  The violinist John Blair worked there fairly often; he lived nearby:  quite a personality.  John was a light-skinned brother with a bald head and was a wonderful musician (writer: he actually played a “vitar,” which he co-invented, a cross between an electric violin and a guitar). He had a black belt in karate too. He was on a television show where he would come out in his gi, the karate outfit, do some karate moves-kicks and chops and so forth-and then pick up the violin and play some great jazz-which was a complete contrast to the karate, going from violence to beauty . His playing was something else-sensitive and brilliant in a way you couldn’t have imagined while watching his karate demonstration. A couple of years ago, his sister wrote to me to get some background about his time on the Lower East Side, what I knew about him. We had become pretty good friends [writer:  John Blair was widely hailed as a virtuoso for his innovative music, but made only two albums and died homeless in 2006]. I’m glad there is some interest in him now.

The cast of characters down on the Lower East Side in the 60s and 70s was pretty unbelievable. Over at Peewee’s, Tommy Turrentine used to come in all the time; JC Moses, who was an excellent drummer but didn’t get much notoriety, played there quite a bit; Scotty Holt, a great bass player, was a regular, and of course Sonny Fortune was down there a lot; I got to know Sonny pretty well over the years-and I love his sound.

After Peewee’s I went to the Needle’s Eye, on Little West 12th Street, in the Meat Market area. That was a very different area from what it is today. It was a very active meat market neighborhood where the carcasses would get delivered all night long to the wholesalers and the workers would load them in off the trucks on hooks. The Needle’s Eye was owned by Sue Yellin, still a good friend. She knew a lot of high profile people and it was a favorite destination for many black politicians. David Dinkins, for example, before he became mayor, used to come by.  It was a good club with consistently good music! Andy Bey, George Coleman again…people like that. Honestly, I don’t remember a lot. But I do recall that at one point the bands used to play right by the window. That area is very old and the streets were all cobblestone [writer: they still are!].  Around last call, about three in the morning, the guys would come in from the meat market at the end of their shifts, still covered in animal blood, for a drink and to hear a little music. That was something-part of what happened there.

Then Steve Resnick, who owned W.M. Tweed’s over on 72nd Street, named after the old notorious New York politician, decided he wanted to open a jazz place over in Newark. He came into the Needle’s Eye to talk to me about coming out there to help get the place off the ground. I agreed to do that. Since I basically knew the groups of the day, I booked the room, but there wasn’t a lot of money for the music. The first group I booked there was Bill Hardman Quintet with Bill Lee-Spike’s father.  After about six months Steve realized that Newark was too country for jazz right then and we closed.

I went over to Tweed’s itself, 1972-73. They did not have live music but musicians liked it there. Charlie Rouse lived in the neighborhood on the Upper West Side somewhere, and he came by regularly. He was one of my favorites, a very nice guy, and he had stopped into a couple of other places where I’d worked too. He gave me a book once.  Roy Haynes used to come by fairly often to see me and hang out a little; and actors would come by: I met both Faye Dunaway and another one of my favorites, Mel Brooks, who was a regular there. One of the popular drinks at the time was Cuervo Gold, I recall, because we had just introduced it and it was a better tasting tequila than the generic bar brand. That bar tequila could take the paint right off the wall.

BLAZING SADDLES & MR. GOODBAR

I’ll never forget that one day Mel Brooks gave me a script to read. “Bill,” he said, “do me a favor and tell me if you think this script is insulting to Blacks.” “Black Bart” was the working title at the time. Richard Pryor was one of the writers. I thought it was hilarious! This was a cowboy movie that insulted everybody:  Blacks, Jews, everybody.  Anyway, the film was made, with the title changed to “Blazing Saddles.” What a great movie.  In one great scene, Count Basie is playing “April in Paris” with his whole band and Cleavon Little dressed in a suede suit is there out in the desert on his Palamino horse-ridiculous. Apparently, Mel and everyone wanted Richard Pryor to play the part of Black Bart, but the story is that the studio wouldn’t accept him because he was going through his drug thing. It was something that Mel asked me who I thought they should go with. I recommended one of my friends, Ted Ross, who won a Tony for playing the Lion in The Wiz on Broadway. But they gave the part to Cleavon Little, who was great in it. I don’t feel insulted at all that they didn’t take my suggestion. Ha ha.

Tweeds was made infamous by a murder and the bar never recovered from the bad publicity. You remember that movie, Looking for Mr. Goodbar? Well, the woman who died was named Joanne. She lived across the street from Tweeds on 72nd Street and she was one of my customers, I knew her. She taught handicapped kids, a nice person. That night she met a guy in the bar and they went across the street to her place and he killed her there.  I was off that night. So I came in the next day and all the news channels-CBC, NBC, all of them-and quite a few reporters were all over the place, kept asking about the place. It was a very popular hangout; it was quite small, and packed on weekends especially. People would wait outside to get in. A great bar! But after a few months of bad publicity, Steve (he was the one I went to Newark with, as well, as I said earlier) decided to close and reopen under a new name: All States Cafe. That seemed to work, shake that negative association with Joanne’s murder, and All States Cafe stayed in business until just a few years ago.

During the period when the room was closed, I took a job elsewhere. There was kind of an underground place down on 72nd Street owned by an Israeli guy, Nachum Meyers, called the Tel Aviv Cafe, and it had been there for a long time. Now, I believe this was in the early 70s. Anyway, the Israeli guy wanted a change in clientele and he went into business with a Haitian guy; together they renamed the place Au sous-sol, a French name meaning basement.  Theirs was quite a large room. But they also had a smaller room down stairs and Nachum and his partner asked me if I would like to run that place on their liquor license.

A PLACE OF HIS OWN

So I put together a couple of thousand dollars, built a bar myself, and opened up as Bill’s Place. My first act was Roy Haynes. We had music two nights a week, Friday and Saturday, and I didn’t charge a cover. Yeah, free. What the hell? That was my way of saying, “Thank you, guys, for playing this great music.” Roy played the first few weeks and off and on after that. He brought in Don Pate on bass, I remember. Later on he had a couple of Japanese musicians with him. I had no idea that jazz music was so popular in Japan, but it was. I hired some all-Japanese groups later on, they knew the music, for certain. They had learned from listening and imitating what they had heard. They sounded just like any other group. Some were great!  I had Jimmy Heath there, I brought John Blair up, Louis Hayes, Sonny Fortune, Dick Griffin, and the Japanese bassist Teruo Nakamara’s group. Teruo even wrote a tune for me-it’s on one of his LPs. I had others too, but these are some I remember.

I had Bill’s place for almost two years. During that time, the jazz was so popular that the owners would sometimes ask me to bring jazz into the big room of the cafe. I had Betty Carter, “Bebop Betty” I called her, and George Benson when he was doing a lot more singing than guitar playing. Then the Israeli and the Haitian had a falling out and lost their liquor license and packed up. But I enjoyed my time there. I still have some pictures up on my walls from Bill’s Place; I got some mentions in New York Magazine and the New Yorker  magazine too.

Then I went to Mikell’s for a while on 97th Street, after which I went to Russ Brown on 96th. Russ knew all the sports players. Maybe this was 1974-75. You know, I might be mixing up the chronology somewhat at this point. But I know that Cassius Clay would come into Russ Brown’s before he was Muhammed Ali, and a number of ball players. Johnny Hartman would perform there quite often. I believe that if Billy Eckstine hadn’t been around, Johnny Hartman would have been better known. Of course he did some things with Coltrane and people did hear that! I got to know him. He was a very little guy, kind of frail. I recall that he drank white wine.

From there, I moved back to the Village to West Third and Thompson, a place called Barbara’s.  Barbara and her husband used to come into Russ Brown’s and after a while asked me to  work for them at their place. There were Monday night jam sessions and Jo Jones was the house drummer for those. A lot of great guys came in to play with him. I remember Joe Locke was a regular; George Coleman worked in the area pretty regularly and he would come in, and younger musicians would come in and play too. That was the way in the old days-kids would come to the jam sessions to get exposure and the more experienced musicians would hear what they could do, test them a little. Art Blakey, Jr.,  and Evelyn Blakey played regularly, and I  got to know them very well.  Barbara’s was there about two years and I just continued to hear the best music a person could hear.

7TH AVENUE SOUTH & SWEETWATERS

While I was at Barbara’s, Kate, the manager over at Seventh Avenue South, a new place owned by her and Michael and Randy Brecker, came to see me. She wanted me to bartend for them and I thought that I would do it. By then I had a good following of friends and customers from the East Village, the West Village, and the Upper West Side.  A good way to start a bar business is with a bartender who has a following-so I was never out of work.

I worked at the bar downstairs; the music was upstairs, primarily they had recording stars performing at Seventh Avenue South. A lot of musicians would come to hang with me at my bar-I think it was as popular sometimes as the upstairs was. In fact, I have an award, a plaque, hanging in my music room today, that was presented to me while I was working there: “Jazz Bartender of the Year-1979.” It was from Dewar’s White Label Scotch-scotch was a very popular drink at that time and Dewar’s supported jazz, did a lot for the music. They were presenting that award for a few years or maybe that was the only year they presented it; I don’t even know how I got nominated. But I’ve still got that plaque!

Another item I have from that period is a red and white striped bathrobe. Jaco Pastorius-that bass player who was so great and died young-came in one day and said, “Here, Bill, this is for you.” He played at Seventh Avenue South quite a bit. Jaco was a really nice guy, a decent guy. He might have been messed up but I liked him. I kept that bathrobe just because he gave it to me.

From there I went back uptown to Sweetwaters. They had some jazz there, mostly pop, and a lot of singers. I did have a chance to hear Etta Jones and Houston Person. Etta was a really sweet person.  While I was at Sweetwaters I met Duane Tetford. He said he was managing a place on 17th Street, which featured jazz.

Duane asked me to come there, so I went to another place. It was a pretty large place, they had Jo Jones there, Tommy Flanagan played the room quite a bit, Ellis Marsalis. That’s where I first met Wynton. He’d hang out to listen to his father. Another of my favorite piano players, Ahmad Jamal (you remember his “Poinciana”), played there. He was a hell of a nice guy. He lived up in the Berkshires.  A lot of guys-Ron Carter, for example-would just sit at the bar and hang, listen to the music. Other great musicians would come through and at one point or another they would just come to the bar and bullshit with me.

There I met John Condon who was opening a place on 15th Street with Duane, Condon’s, and I went there and stayed there until it closed. Clifford Jordan’s Big Band played at Condon’s regularly and I loved that band, everyone in it.

I’ve got, still, such total respect for these guys, for the artists who create jazz music. Some may not have great personalities, but the music they play speaks for them, and I respect the sacrifices they make.  Kenny Dorham, for example, all the time I was on the lower east side, especially at the Annex, Kenny would be around, but I never got to know him-that was kind of sad. Miles, he was just too arrogant. But others, like Clifford Jordan, Cedar Walton, so many musicians, Ben Riley, Ray Drummond , and John Hicks among them, and the many others we have talked about here, were wonderful people to know.

CODA

After Condon’s closed, I left the music world. That was 1990. I worked for the MTA for quite a while, actually 10 years. I had many years of great times-from the 1950s to 1990-in jazz. I had built a house up where I am now about 20 years before I moved here, just for a place to go. But in 2001 I was offered the job of managing the Harley-Davidson shop in Keen, New Hampshire, and I took it. I’ve been here ever since. Now I’m getting tired of that cold weather we have in the winter. Maybe I’ll get on my Harley and head south. I’ve always been a biker as well as a bartender.

It has been a wonderful life so far. There are certain things I could have done better, some I could have done differently. I met some great people, worked with some great people, and heard some great music; and I have been blessed to be able to make money at the same time I was doing something I loved. I have the utmost respect for these guys, these musicians, and hope the ones who are left someday get the recognition that they deserve.

68,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/inservice/charles-charlie-turyn-learning-on-the-job/,"Charles “Charlie” Turyn Charles “Charlie” Turyn was already legendary by the time the Tin Palace opened in New York and owner Paul Pines sought him out to help establish the place as a jazz room. He’d waited tables at both Five Spots, tended bar at the Dom, and would finish his jazz career as a bartender at Bradley’s. He heard Monk play six nights a week for more than a year altogether, and many other jazz luminaries over the course of their careers. Although his mobility is now restricted by a particularly painful form of rheumatoid arthritis, Charles has a lifetime of wonderful memories in jazz to recount.

***********

Charlie Turyn:

I was a waiter and bartender in lot of famous and not so famous jazz joints, beginning with the Five Spot in 1958 and ending at Bradley’s thirty-five years later.  But I loved the music before that and used to hang out at the original Five Spot from around 1956. It was on Cooper Square, 5 Cooper Square, in New York. If you want to place it in your mind, the Bowery comes as far north as Fourth Street, Third Avenue starts at Eighth Street, also known as St. Mark’s, and Cooper Square named for Cooper Union, the famous art and architecture school, was in between the two.

I started listening to jazz around the time a friend turned me onto grass, when I was 17; he put some Erroll Garner on and I said, “Hey, this is the shit!” So it was grass and Errol Garner that first got me into jazz. I was able to hear a lot of great music performed live at that time. I heard Charlie Parker play on five or six different occasions. He died in 1955, not long after, and the most of the times I heard him he didn’t play wonderfully except once-he played magnificently. Other highlights were a midnight concert at Carnegie Hall with the MJQ and one with Count Basie with special guest soloists Clarke Terry and Wild Bill Davis, the organ player. I really liked jazz immensely and I got to the point where I didn’t have to get high to love it.

I had a friend, Bob Whiteside, with a loft near the original Five Spot; both Elvin Jones and Steve Lacy had lofts nearby too, on Bleecker Street. Bob worked at the saloon as a waiter and I would go to the Tuesday night jam sessions, often. Eventually, though, they started hiring groups. They brought in two groups at first: the Cecil Taylor Quartet with Steve Lacy on soprano exclusively, Dennis Charles on drums, and Buell Neidlinger on bass; and on Cecil’s off nights a jazz violinist named Dick Wetmore. I liked his playing; I don’t know if I would like it now, my taste is more sophisticated now, but as I remember, he swung.

Cecil was playing tunes, then, recognizable tunes. On one New Year’s Eve, I believe it was 1956, I figured I didn’t want to be bothered with any of that New Year’s Eve crap and went to the Five Spot to hear some music. Cecil recognized me as a regular, and around 11 or 11:30 p.m., he said to me, “When Midnight comes around, I want you to jump up and holler, ‘Blues in B Flat!'” Ok, I agreed to do that. The place wasn’t even decorated for the holiday; it was just the Five Spot like it always was. But at a quarter to 12 a bunch of tourists came in and the owners, Joe and Iggy Termini, came out and started distributing noisemakers and funny hats and everything else; so even though I did jump up and holler “Blues in B Flat” when I was supposed to, Cecil was forced to play “Auld Lange Syne.”

Some of the other early groups there included Lou Donaldson’s, his band played there for a while, and Mingus; he had a band there.  Mingus was always unpleasant, as I recall.

Paul Newman Asks Questions

In about 1957, I was still just a customer at the club, and one day I met Joe Termini outside. He was standing there talking with this kind of handsome, bald-headed guy and Termini said, “Here,” to the guy. “Maybe he can help you.” He didn’t use any last names when he introduced us. He just said, “Paul, meet Charlie.” So we shook hands. He asked me, “Are you into this music?” I said, “Oh, yeah, very much.” He asked me one of the stupidest questions about jazz that I had ever heard. I don’t even remember exactly what it was. I said, “You have to be a jerk to ask me a question like that.” Then he made an even stupider comment about music. And as the conversation went on, it got stupider and stupider. Dumber questions and dumber comments. I let my indignation show, and said, “C’mon, don’t ask me these stupid shit questions. You’ve got to be a jerk to make comments like that.” So after about five minutes of talking, he took my hand very warmly and said, “Thank you. Thank you very much.” And he hailed a cab and left. Joe Termini later said, “You know who you’ve been calling a jerk? That’s Paul Newman. He’s on his way to do his new movie Paris Blues and needed information about jazz people for it.” I told that story to Woody-the writer Heywood Gould-and he said, “Hey, your persona might show up in the movie.” I don’t know. I never saw it.

Waiting Tables at the Five Spot-Monk Six Nights a Week

I had a really crappy office job that I loathed at that time. My friend Bob, who was also an amateur bass player, helped me get the job waiting tables at the Five Spot.  I was an amateur alto player-that is, I walked around with an alto, trying to look hip and impress chicks by carrying an instrument. I got more serious about playing years later after I got out of the army. But as I said, we both loved the music. So this was an opportunity to make a living and hear music six nights a week. Thelonious Monk played there six nights a week for months at a stretch.  I could hear Thelonious every night. I heard the band when they made the recording Live at the Five Spot. Because I worked both at the original Five Spot and when it moved around the corner to St. Marks Place, I had something like 14 or 15 months of hearing Thelonious Monk six nights a week. The original band in 58 had Ahmed Abdul Malik on bass and Roy Haynes on drums. I still think that Roy Haynes is one of the great, great drummers. He has a completely individual approach.  Even though he is of the same generation as Max Roach, he doesn’t play in the Max Roach style, or the Kenny Clarke style, or the Art Blakey style-he has his own style.

Nica [the Baroness Rothschild, a legendary patron of jazz] was there many nights to hear Thelonious. I got to meet her several times. She was a very nice person and she came to like me after I commented on something she doodled on the back of one of our “minimum” cards. I looked down and said, “That looks like a Georges Braque still life.” She was very pleased. I wasn’t trying to hustle her for a tip or anything. That doodle really did bear a resemblance to Braque’s work. Nica was a truly wonderful person, very nice.

The Five Spot served mostly drinks but they had ok food too, jazz club food: burgers, southern fried chicken, french fries, food like that. One of the things I remember wonderfully about my time there happened one evening. The music began at 9:30 and I started at about 8 o’clock, setting up, wiping the tables clean, going to the store if the cook needed more onions or lemons or something.  One of the owners, Joe, came out of the back and said, “In case someone calls ahead, Thelonious just phoned and said that Cannonball Adderly will be sitting in for the 11:30 set.” Now Johnny Griffin was the saxophone player in that band.  Griffin is a good player but I don’t believe that he is a good interpreter of Thelonious’s music. So Cannonball came in for that set and played a bunch of tunes. The one that stands out in my memory was “In Walked Bud” [here he sings the tune]. And he just played magnificently-Jesus, he played! And Griffin didn’t get on the bandstand with him. But when Cannonball walked out the door-Cannonball wasn’t a drinker, he just packed up his horn, said thank you and left-Griffin followed him to the door and shouted at the top of his lungs, “Don’t you ever come back!”

Eventually Monk fired Griffin [writer: Griffin has said he left on his own because there wasn’t enough money] because he didn’t really play Thelonious’s music well. He hired Charlie Rouse but Rouse was co-leader with Julius Watkins, the French horn player, of a band called the Les Jazz Modes quintet, which had two weeks’ of engagements left, so Sonny Rollins, Monk’s long-time buddy, filled in for those two weeks while they waited for Rouse. That was just fantastic listening.

Roy Haynes Had the Monday Night Band

I worked six nights a week. One of those was Thelonious’s off night. Roy Haynes talked himself into being the band leader on that night, Mondays, so Roy was at the Five Spot seven nights a week. Wayne Shorter used to come in on Mondays and sit in, still in his army uniform. He didn’t really have that personal of a style yet; rhythmically he sounded like Rollins, but his tone reflected Trane. And it was very interesting hearing this unknown-at-the-time guy and hearing him develop over the years. Roy also hired McCoy for a while, and the same thing was true of him. I got to hear him become McCoy. I was just a jazz hippie!

I got to know Monk’s whole band. Roy was the most personable of them all. I remember one night Thelonious called in sick, legit sick, and he sent in Phineas Newborne as his replacement. Everybody now says “fine-as” but in those days we pronounced his name “finius.” I had only heard him one time on the radio (there was no WBGO in those days), it might have been on Mort Fega’s show, and I thought from that little bit that I heard of his recorded music that Phineas was a cold player. But when he subbed for Thelonious, I found out I was wrong! Thelonious had his set list: he played these tunes the first set, these tunes the second set, these tunes the third set. Phineas followed that set list because Thelonious told him to do that. He swung like crazy and it was very interesting to hear. When Thelonious came back, I said to him, “You know, I had always thought, until I heard him live, that Phineas was a cold player. But he’s not! Not at all.” Thelonious said angrily, “Who’s a cold player?” “Well,” I said, “until I heard him last night, I thought Phineas was.” And he said, “Sheee-it.”

He was kind of distant, Thelonious. He wasn’t cold, just reserved, distant. I liked his playing immensely. Thelonious hadn’t worked in New York in years because of a cabaret card problem. The Termini brothers went to court for him to get him back his cabaret card.

Prez Played the Five Spot

Lester Young worked at the Five Spot for a few months in 1958 after Thelonious left. He had a piano player, Valdo Williams, who is on one of those live Charlie Parker records, not Jazz at Massey Hall, another one that came out after Bird’s death. He’d give you one chorus like George Shearing, one chorus like Bud Powell, another like Junior Mance. Prez used to holler at him, “Be yourself, man! Play yourself!” But this was the way he played. Although 5 Cooper Square wasn’t technically the Bowery, it was close enough that you had a bunch of derelicts and winos hanging outside. They used to press their noses against the glass because they could hear the music through the window and Prez would wave them in, thinking they might be customers. But they were just winos. Once he waved them in, I would have to get to the door real quick and get them out. You couldn’t throw them out, because you might lose a potential tip, so you had to sweetheart them out.

One time, when Prez was playing there Allen Ginsberg came in with Peter, his companion. He wanted to know, “Is this the piano that Thelonious Monk plays? Is this Monk’s piano?” Well, we said, “Yes, Monk picked out this piano and the club got it. Thelonious really likes this piano, probably more than the other piano players do who play it.”

Well, Allen lay down on the floor under the piano after we said that and read some poetry.  So Prez wanted to know, “Who wrote that shit?” “Hart Crane,” Allen told him. “What was his kick?” Lester wanted to know. “Young boys,” Allen said. “Shit,” Lester said. “When those Poles come over here to drop the bomb, I’m going over to Tiffany’s , break a window and snatch up some jewels.”

Fired 

New Year’s Eve between 1958 and 1959 I acted very badly and the Terminis fired me. So I went back to furniture moving, which I had actually enjoyed a lot when I’d done it before. On every job there is a lot of built-in down time: You get paid to ride around in the truck and there’s nothing to do during that period except sit with the driver.  I am very proud of the fact that on one day I moved five pianos. I was the only piano guy the mover had. So I sat in the office until the first piano was ready to come down the stairs. He gave me a bunch of money for cab fare and I went to the job, made sure the piano got well onto the truck; went back to the office,  the second piano was ready to come down, went there by cab; then the first piano was ready to go back up,  the same thing happened five times. Knowing how to lift, it’s not too hard.

Then I got drafted into the army. It was 1960 and I was 24 years old. I thought maybe I’d beat it because someone in my neighborhood had managed to reach the mandatory cutoff age of 35 without being called up. But I was called. And the tour was extended because of the Berlin Wall going up. I hurt my back in the army and would never be able to move furniture again.

Rehired

After about six months of collecting Unemployment Insurance, I got back into the saloon business. I hit on the Terminis-they were opening their new joint-to take me back and I worked there for a year or so. They forgave me.

I enjoyed a drink myself. I preferred Jack Daniels and had been introduced to it when I was a waiter at the first Five Spot. One of the other waiters had a loft across the street. One night we went over there, smoked a joint, and he brought out his bottle of Jack Daniels. He poured me a goodly amount of Jack, added one small ice cube and squeezed a lemon wedge into the glass. I thought it was fantastic, loved it!

Around that time I got another alto, began taking lessons and became serious about learning to play the music that I liked to listen to. There was a flaw in my approach, though, because I was compensating for a pretty bad experience with a teacher in grammar school who convinced me that I was tone deaf.  So I tried to play the saxophone with a completely intellectual approach to music. It took years and years and years before I realized that I have a pretty good ear! I played some gigs, and eventually switched over to tenor. That’s when I started playing and listening with my ear.  I took some lessons with Eddie Daniels, a real virtuoso on a whole bunch of different instruments: clarinet, alto, tenor, flute-absolutely virtuoso. He wanted me to transcribe solos so I brought in a 10-inch LP with a Parker blues on it called “Bluebird.” The structure was simple and I thought I could transcribe that. Anyway, Eddie said, “I didn’t even know this record existed.” Well, I went into my hipster bag, “How could you not know about this classic blah blah blah.” Well, he pulled an album out of his collection and said, “This is the only Charlie Parker record I have ever owned, but I can play you every note on it!” I got the message.

The Dom

The Dom was on St. Mark’s Place between Second and Third Avenues. I worked there in the 1960s for a while. It was owned by a merchant seaman who renamed it after one of three famous cafes he had seen in Paris: the Dome, the Cupole, and the Rotund. Interestingly, the name didn’t change much. The building had been a Polish American organization called the Polski Dom Narodovy -in Polish, Dom means domicile or home. So all these Polish Americans owned shares, hundreds of people had shares, and the man who opened the Dom as a saloon, Stanley Tokens, had to get a controlling interest of the shares. He looked up all the shareholders and offered each one $10 or $20 a share-I don’t really know-but a lot of money for the time. So everyone sold him their shares and he was able to open a saloon with jazz there. The clarinetist Tony Scott had the gig at the Dom that lasted the whole 13 or 14 months I worked there. He had a lot of wonderful people playing with him: Jaki Byard on piano, Paul Chambers on bass for a while, Philly Joe Jones for a while-both of them had their substance abuse problems-Harold Mabern for a while.  Tony Scott was kind of a hysterical clarinet player, a complete virtuoso but not a loving player. One night he played tenor and it was wonderful; he played in a very sweet Lester Young style. I said to him at the end of the evening, “Tony, I really like your tenor playing.” And his answer was, “Yes, I am less ego involved on tenor.” I thought that was kind of profound.  He played tenor really, really nicely.

I worked as a bartender at the Dom-my first bartending job in a jazz joint. I had managed to get a job as a bartender somewhere else first. One of the owner’s friends told him that I was the best bartender they had ever seen. It’s funny; I just learned on the job, learned how to pour a draft beer, and when someone asked for a mixed drink, I’d yell out to one of the other guys: “Tom Collins” or “Martini.” They’d tell me what to do and I did become a capable bartender.

The Tin Palace

Paul Pines owned the Tin Palace, which was on the Bowery at Second Street. He lives upstate now. He’s a published poet, teaches in some college upstate. I was there about a year or two. A lot of very good players performed there. [writer: a 2008 interview with Pines  in the online magazine Perfect Sound Forever by Andy Schwartz has him crediting Charlie with a very important role in the opening of the club: He says, “‘Big Charlie’ was a bartender from the old Stanley’s who played saxophone and had an encyclopedic knowledge of jazz. He put together the Murray Shapinsky Quartet-it was named for some unsung Jewish jazzman that Charlie loved-and we started having live music by the end of the first year.”] I put together a group for the place called the Murray Shapinsky Quartet or Quintet-Murray wasn’t in the band. He was some bass player that Dizzy used to get to sub in his band when Oscar Pettiford or another modern player couldn’t make the gig. Murray was kind of a swing player. I just liked the sound of his name.  You would have had to be a real aficionado of the music to know who he was.

Richie Cole had a band with Eddie Jefferson that worked the Tin Palace a lot. Richie played alto beautifully then. I haven’t heard him recently, not since he did that pop bop album. I disliked that immensely. But Eddie Jefferson got shot in Detroit by somebody who had a grudge against him, something about a girlfriend 10 years earlier. So he shot Jefferson down in the street when they were leaving a gig one night. Now Richie’s father died when he was rather young and here his musical adopted daddy gets killed right in front of his eyes-it really did a number on him emotionally.

Before Eddie died, I recall a funny altercation I had with Richie. Richie had an alto that he liked a lot. It needed work at one point, a complete overhaul. So he had to play his backup horn for awhile that he grew to dislike intensely. I lent him my alto, which he liked a lot. He kept on bugging me to sell it to him. “C’mon, how much do you want for it?”  The answer was always the same. “It’s not for sale, Richie. I lent it to you just because you’re Richie. But I’m keeping it.” Eventually Jefferson told him, “Drop it. He’s not going to sell you that horn.”  When his horn finally came out of the shop, he put his backup horn behind the car and ran right over it. He hated it that much.

Richie used to drive up and down the East Coast in a station wagon that he had made into a motel on wheels, with a bed in the back. In between gigs, he’d go into someplace, anyplace, a pizzeria, to get something to eat, and say, “Ever think of having jazz in here?” A real hustler.

I liked Richie immensely. At the end of each evening, he would have what he called his jazzorama, and some really good players would come up to sit in, including Dave Liebman, who was playing tenor exclusively in those days. He didn’t play a lot of soprano until sometime later when I heard him sit in with Richie Beirach at Bradley’s. On one of those occasions I said, “Dave, I really like your soprano playing. You have a very individual thing on it. On tenor, you sound like any other Coltrane clone.” Beirach told him, “Listen to Charlie. He won’t bullshit you.” Dave played a lot of soprano after that.

Bradley’s

My next and last job in a jazz joint was at Bradley’s. I was working a really crappy saloon job and someone told me that Bradley was hiring. So I got down there and the bar was filled with guys wanting the job. There were a half dozen of them and we all kind of recognized each other, so we drew straws to see what order we would go into the back in to be interviewed. I was the last one. Each one came out afterward and said, “He was really nice to me. I’ve never known him to be like that.” [writer: Bradley Cunningham was a notorious curmudgeon.] When my turn came, Bradley said, very rudely, “You know, I’m talking to a bunch of other people!” I said, “Yes, I know. I’m sitting at the bar with them.” I’d been at the bar quite a while and had had a bunch of drinks, so I was not shy. So he finished with, “Give me your name and phone number and I’m not promising you anything because I’ve been talking to all these guys.” Well, I still had the other saloon job because I needed the money and I didn’t expect anything.

I had met Bradley several years earlier at the Lion’s Head on Christopher Street so I knew his manner; I worked a couple of nights a week there filling in at some point, probably the late 70s. It wasn’t a jazz bar but a lot of musicians and fans would drink there. I served him drinks and the owner said to him, “You should meet this guy. He’s very much into jazz.” “Who’s your favorite piano player?” he demanded in that gruff tone of voice of his, and I said, “Probably Barry Harris.” Well, Bradley became very angry. “Why?” I said it was because Barry knows the entire bebop thing-Bud Powell, Charlie Parker-he knows it cold. And Bradley was irate, furious. “Yeah,” he told me, “Flanagan knows all that and more!” I got to hear Flanagan later at Bradley’s and I came to love him very much. A wonderful player, a wonderful guy.

Anyway, I don’t know if Bradley remembered that encounter when he interviewed me in 1980. But at 8 o’clock in the morning I got a phone call from him. Now 8 o’clock in the morning to a saloon worker is awful early. “Hey, pal, this is Bradley. Can you do me tonight? Be there at 8 o’clock.” I said, “Sure, Bradley, I’ll do it.” He says, “It’s just tonight.” I worked that night. The next day, I got a phone call, again at 8 o’clock in the morning. “Hey, pal, can you do me tonight?” Same thing. That was the hour when he was going home, I think. I said, “Sure,” again. It went on like that for a while until one night in the place, he said, “I can do you like three nights a week.” I think it was Friday, Saturday, Sunday-good in some ways, but the other nights are more sane, with more regulars at the bar. But I took it.

Soon after I started, the bookkeeper called me in to do the paperwork, fill in W-2 forms, give her my Social Security number, you know, all that. “What’s your last name, Mike?” she asked. “My name isn’t Mike,” I said. “I’m Charlie.” And I spelled my last name. Well, she thought it was Mike. I used to work with a guy in another joint called Big Mike, and he was a very big guy-we called ourselves the Dancing Bears because we were so big and so fast. A couple of years later, Mike came to visit me and hang out and Bradley started hollering, “I hired the wrong guy!” By then we were getting along alright. As long as you didn’t challenge his authority, you could disagree with him, argue with him, which I liked a lot.

Tommy Flanagan Quotes General MacArthur

Bradley’s was strictly a piano duo room at that time. I first heard Kirk Lightsey in that room, and of course I heard Tommy Flanagan. I have a funny Flanagan story that you’ll get if you know something about American history. You know, in World War II, General MacArthur left Corregidor, the island in the Philippines, to take up his new posting in Australia. He took with him all the able-bodied troops and the good armaments. He left the remaining commander, General Wainwright, with only the sickly soldiers and no armament to speak of to fight the Japanese. It went badly and one result was the notorious Bataan Death March in which many troops died. Anyway, as MacArthur left Wainright, legend has it that he proclaimed, “I shall return!” So one evening at the end of a set there at Bradley’s, Tommy Flanagan stood up and said into the microphone, “Well, as General MacArthur said to General Wainright at Corregidor, ‘Bye!'” Just wonderful. “Bye!”

There were a lot of other highlights during those years. George Coleman lived near Bradley’s and would sit in a bunch. I liked his playing a lot. I became very good friends with Scott Perez, another bartender that Bradley hired while I was working there. At first, I was very mean to Scott-I thought that the customers would prefer him to me because he was so personable. I thought Bradley would dump me. So I perceived Scott as a threat. But he is the best friend a person could ever have-just a wonderful human being. At some point he got his own place-became a co-owner of Walker’s Bar downtown [where the writer’s husband, guitarist Peter Leitch, has an ongoing Sunday night gig]. We are still friends.

Dexter Gordon would come in-everybody came in. Once Dexter and I were hanging outside the club waiting for Bradley to come out; it was well after closing, probably five in the morning. Dexter said, “You know when I met this guy, we got along great. So I asked him, ‘What’s your name, man?’ He said, ‘Bradley.’ I went, ‘No, no. I mean your first name.’ I figured it must be Robert, Robert Bradley, or something like that. ‘That’s my name. Bradley Cunningham.’  That’s a bad dude. Got two last names!”
Bradley’s was the longest saloon job I ever had. I stayed there probably seven years. I quit before Bradley died but came back for some shifts when his widow, Wendy, took over, to help her out. It’s easier to work if you don’t drink and I did drink.

Customers liked to buy the bartender a drink instead of tip. I was just an ordinary bartender-I didn’t need anybody to buy me a drink, though, the liquor was right there! I used to tell people that in difficult situations, you have more emotional reserves if you don’t drink. A lot of people figure, you have a few drinks, who needs emotional reserves? After a while, it was time to get out of the bar business altogether. One thing that I am proud of is that I never got into it with anybody. I was always able to sweetheart people out the door when I had to.

Another person who stands out in my memory wasn’t a musician or another bartender, but a customer. Merton Simpson is a painter and art gallery owner whose gallery was on Madison Avenue in the 70s or 80s. He used to have incredible parties, with great bands-the George Coleman Quartet or quintet with Danny Moore on trumpet and Harold Mabern playing piano, bands like that. He’d make sure there was incredible food, lots of booze, and this great music. I got to like Merton a lot. He had a stroke recently and I bought some stuff from him, some interesting African masks, and some other art. I gave Scott some things I bought from Merton’s. You meet a lot of good people in the jazz saloons. Like I said, I’m still close to some of them.

When I left the saloons I went to school to learn the Alexander Technique. I had become familiar with it when I began experiencing back problems. Well, I’d had them since the army, but they worsened. Bartenders stand for hours at a time. I don’t know whether I had poor posture-Alexander people don’t say “posture,” they say “poor use of yourself.” An orthopedist who didn’t even know what the Alexander Technique was sent me to an Alexander teacher, because he had found that it did help his patients. It helped me a lot.  Anyway, I was getting fed up with the saloon business: 1958 to 1987 was enough time in the bars.

 For many of us, Dorthaan Kirk is the face of WBGO-a tireless ambassador for the country’s largest jazz station and for the music. Her official title is special events and community relations coordinator, but her work history runs deep; she was a founding member of the station 34 years ago, not long after the death of her husband, multi-instrumentalist Rahsaan Roland Kirk. You’ll read about that in her own words. Her “Service ” work, originating and continuing to book and oversee Jazz Vespers at Bethany Baptist Church for more than twelve years, is purely a labor of love-for her church and for the music. And that has grown and sprouted some wonderful offshoots, the most recent one is her own room! Dorthaan’s Place in NJPAC will host jazz brunch beginning in October, monthly to start but more often as it develops into an event! But well before Dorthaan arrived on the East Coast, she was part of an informal network of families that opened their doors and dining rooms to traveling jazz artists-welcoming places where a home-cooked meal could always be counted on.

Dorthaan Kirk:

Music has always been part of my life. I grew up in Texas-Houston-and so you know there was Blues. I heard Jazz, Blues, Big Band music, even Country and Western. We didn’t separate the music into categories back then.  I liked Dolly Parton, the Coasters, Lightning Hopkins-he’s from Texas, you know. These were some of the popular people of my generation.  Music was in the neighborhood, you didn’t have to leave your neighborhood to hear music. Maybe, if it was a huge concert you wanted to go to, you might go downtown to this big theatre called, I think, the Auditorium. But the music was all over: little bitty clubs, not so little clubs, bigger clubs. Of course, just like kids do now, my friends and I would get smuggled in to hear the music if we weren’t old enough.

I moved to LA to go to LA City College when I was just 17 years old. I thought I was all grown up! The first time I heard Miles Davis was around then, at the Crenshaw Theatre, at Adams and Crenshaw. It’s probably gone now. Shows used to start at 2 a.m. after the clubs closed and that’s when I heard him perform.

I had a little job after school making 90 cents an hour. I was rich! So I hung out, went to hear the music with friends. Everything was cheaper-cigarettes were 17 cents a pack; gasoline was something like that a gallon. We were just having fun. I didn’t try to meet the musicians at that time. I just enjoyed the music; I don’t even recall who the sidemen were with Miles. We didn’t really notice who was who-the headliner was most important to us when we were just young kids having fun. That was who we went to see, party to, or whatever. It wasn’t till my years with Rahsaan that I had any clue about any side persons.

As the time passed, I got more and more of an appreciation of the music. But then, I used to just love to go out and “throw down” to the Impressions, the Coasters, groups like that. We did the whole thing. That was when we were partying back. But as the years went past, and I don’t even know when it happened-I got an appreciation.

People used to categorize different kinds of jazz-east coast jazz and west coast jazz. The east coast jazz was also called progressive jazz. I don’t know if you’ve heard about that separation but that’s the way it was. That is probably why I don’t ever remember John Coltrane coming to LA. But Miles came, and Rahsaan was in LA all the time, and they were in the “progressive” category. Heck, if Rahsaan hadn’t been in LA all the time, I wouldn’t be here talking to you. Of course, I know there were a lot of people coming through LA that I never saw there. Like Mingus, or Dexter. I don’t remember ever hearing Ernie Andrews in LA, but that was maybe because he was on the road with Harry James. I didn’t have an east coast/west coast preference. If you liked it, you liked it.

Long story short, whatever kids do now, go out to hear the music they like, that’s just what we did. There were a lot of musicians who came through Los Angeles in the late 60s, early 70s. I’d go to the Palladium to see big concerts-Creed Taylor would do these dates at the Palladium, have maybe George Benson as the headliner, but would add somebody like Freddie Hubbard and some other big names  on the concert. He would record those concerts and switch up leaders on the records so that different leaders would have records from the same concert date.

And I’d go to the small clubs too. Wednesday nights, there was an organ player, Earl Grant, down at a little club on Figueroa Street, and I’m not usually into organ, but I liked that; I can see his face now. There was a little place on Western Avenue, Tiki Island, I saw Johnny Otis there for the first time. Marty’s was a good local club on Broadway, but it moved to a fancier place after the riots. I remember the day the riots started. I say that we initiated the riots, August 1966. Most of the stores were destroyed in the “Hood” and Marty’s moved to either Baldwin Park or…anyway, it was renamed Marty’s on the Hill. That’s where I first heard Carmen McRae; Horace Silver, too. Then there was Shelly’s Manhole in Hollywood…

When I met Rahsaan, I was still married to my first husband-and Rahsaan had nothing at all to do with our breakup.  We went with our friends to the It Club on Washington Boulevard; it was 1963. I remember who was with Rahsaan because they were nuts! Vernon Martin, Jimmy Hopps, and Rahn Burton were in the group. Everybody wore suits back then.

A Home-Cooked Meal for Travelling Musicians

My first husband was from Baltimore and he was a big jazz listener. His buddies in LA were jazz fans too.  We were part of a community of places that were hospitable to traveling musicians. Musicians knew they could come to this house or that house and get a good home-cooked meal -all over, in a lot of cities. We became one of those homes. I cooked. I have always liked to cook. And I had a husband and three little girls to cook for all the time, anyway. To this day, you’d think I had 25 children, I make a big Sunday dinner every week. Anyway, after we met Rahsaan, he became one of the artists who came around.

Rahsaan was different because he was so visual-even though he was sightless (he did not like the word “handicapped”). It was like “WOW!” So I got to know him.  And the girls got to know him before we were all a family. He loved kids and ended up being like a father to my girls.

Moving East

Rahsaan and I moved East. I had a great job with the Department of Social Services in LA, pension plan, Rolls Royce health plan, raises every year, all that. They allowed me a year off, so I went wandering for that year with Rahsaan to test the waters. This was 1970 and I was still young, in my early 30s. My children were in Houston for the summer already with my mother when I made this decision, so they stayed with her and I visited them often. I kept my little stucco house in LA just in case and we started out in New York for a year.

Rahsaan had the idea that he could teach at a conservatory or his own music school and go on the road too. He felt he shouldn’t have to be on the road 365 days a year. Since most of the work was on the East coast, he’d have less traveling time by living there. At first he had his sights set on Boston-with Berklee and the conservatories there. But rent was sky high in Boston, and Rahsaan, who was very conservative in spending, thought that it was stupid to pay that much money to anybody for rent. While we were living in New York, we went down to Philly to see his friends Bill Carney and Trudy Pitts and they encouraged us to settle in Philly while Rahsaan made up his mind what he wanted to eventually do. Now, time was passing; I didn’t have my kids with me, going from New York to Texas and back, and it was a good idea to go there where expenses were cheaper and money went so much further-even though Rahsaan had resources and was very generous with us.

We found a house at 4714 Greene Street in Germantown, a pretty section of Philadelphia. $120 a month for a two- story three (or was it four) bedroom house-living room, dining room, kitchen, one and a half baths. That sounds so foreign, crazy. What if we made what we made now and the rents were that cheap? Wouldn’t the world be a better place? Anyway, I brought the children back from Texas to that house.

I hated Philly. Coming from the west to the east is a culture shock by itself. And Philly is even more of a culture shock than New York. I still get excited when I go to New York. It was just like you read about in the magazines back then. You say, Wow, this really exists. There isn’t any place like it. You know what I mean?

Philadelphia is old and dirty. I have since learned to appreciate it. But the projects, people stacked on top of each other, were a shock. Even in Watts there is grass, little shotgun houses, it’s not dirty like back east.  In the east you’ve got people on the street. In LA and even Houston, everybody’s in cars, so they’re not making dirt on the streets. You don’t see dirt, you don’t see people. Still, today, when I go back to Houston, it’s a shock. Where are the people? We stayed in Philly 18 months and then moved to the house in East Orange, New Jersey, where I am today.

First Trip Overseas

So initially I had culture shock in the east. Like I had on my first trip to London. Rahsaan was booked there for six fricking weeks! I cried every day for the first two! I hadn’t fully adjusted to the east coast yet and here I was in London in winter. Rahsaan had a circuit of places he would be at certain times-and London was in the winter. People knew that’s when they could come and hear him there, every year or every 18 months. So we went in January 1970 or 71 and were going to be there until March!

Rahsaan had been there many times. He tried to warn me about the ways London was different, like in the hotel, he would say, “Don’t order bacon and eggs, it won’t be what you think.” Me being me, I ordered bacon and eggs. And everything went downhill from there. We went to an Angus Steakhouse. I had to fight with them to get the steak cooked like I wanted it. “No pink, no blood, “I’d say. And they’d just go, “Oh you Americans, you’ll ruin the meat. ” I was so frustrated. And that shepherd’s pie. But that’s their culture.

And the money! The year I went the first time, they were switching over from the shillings to the decimal system. That was a real test. You got this money that looks like play money but that’s what you’ve got to spend. So the first thing to figure out is the relationship between the old money and the new money-and then how much the whole thing is worth in American dollars. How much is a shilling? This all devastated me.

Now Rahsaan had it all down pat. He’d been going there since the mid-sixties. At first he came alone, playing with Tubby Hayes and different people. Eventually he got big enough to bring his own group. So for him it was like being in New York and he loved the money. The bills were all different sizes, and he could tell what was what.  American bills are all the same sizes-10 dollar bill, hundred dollar bill, they’re all the same size.

I cried but I stayed. My ass was stuck. Rahsaan at first went with me everywhere I wanted to go. He paid so I didn’t have to deal with the money. Finally, one day, he said, “Look, lady,” that’s what he said when he was pissed at me.  “Look, we’re going to be here for six weeks.  I can’t go with you everywhere and neither can nobody else! So you’re going to have to figure all of this out. Here’s the money. You go downstairs and ask them to get you a taxi when you want to go out. Then you get back in a taxi when you want to come back.  You are going to have to do that.”

I sat up and paid attention.” I got it from here. I can do this.” And I was ready the next time I went. I learned what to bring from home and what was good there. I brought my own toilet tissue the next time. I brought my own cigarettes-Rahsaan hated me smoking. And I discovered  Indian food-it was good; we also went to an itty bitty German soul food restaurant, they had this pork chop and German potato salad! We could have eaten at Ronnie Scott’s, of course, that was good; Joe was the cook’s name, but we would have had to wait till at least 11 o’clock to eat-Rahsaan didn’t go on till 10, I think, or 11. Who wants to wait that long to eat! I remember Blossom Dearie opened for Rahsaan at Ronnie Scott’s. That’s where I met her.

I got a lot of jazz history from going to record stores with Rahsaan. He would go to record stores literally every week, no exaggeration, and go through all the new releases. It didn’t matter whether we were home or in Colorado or Texas or England, we had to get to a record store. So obviously I had to read to him from the record covers. He wanted to know  the name of the record, the leader, all the side persons, who wrote the liner notes, what did they say, what were the tunes. Everything.  That was a nightmare, but guess what? It stuck with me. You’d be surprised what you would learn and not even know that you knew it until years later.

I met a lot of musicians. Artists of all kinds are different. They’re cool. I guess their minds work differently than ours. They are smart, maybe that’s why their minds are different: Musicians, visual artists, actors and actresses. I got to know some of that theatre crowd that used to hang out at Phoebe’s on Second Avenue because of one of Rahsaan’s dear friends in Chicago, Abena Joan Brown, who was very involved in African American theatre; Woody King had a Black theatre over in Soho, the New Federal Theatre, and Rahsaan’s friend established something like that in Chicago on the South Side. She would come to New York with the group a lot and we would hang out. That’s how I got to meet all those nuts over at Phoebe’s. They were so interesting, and absolutely fascinated me because they were really out there and I was just an average Joe. We became very good friends. And then there were The Last Poets, a group that used to come to see Rahsaan,  very popular in the 1970s-into the Revolution. I don’t know where they are now. But I did not get involved in politics. There was no room for it. My life didn’t get directed there.

Taking Care of Business-Rahsaan’s Legacy

I did not concern myself with the business of music until Rahsaan died. I didn’t have anything to do with it except to collect receipts, and that’s the truth. Rahsaan was real old-fashioned, even though he was only 41 when he died. He looked like he was 60. He was an old soul-he had been here before.  Some people have heard me say that and not known what to think. There’s a guy who performed at my church, Noel, he loved Rahsaan, and we would talk about him. He said to me, “There was just too much energy. He died so young because there was too much energy and brilliance to be contained in one body.” Nobody else ever said that. That’s heavy.  Too much to be contained in one body. It is true.
Rahsaan used to say that he was misunderstood. People didn’t understand him. So he didn’t try.  Even with me. There was stuff I would ask him and he wouldn’t even try to explain.

I was so mad at him! He died and my questions weren’t answered-neither the ones I was brave enough to ask him nor the ones I had in the back of my head to ask him that I never did ask. He could be really weird and not answer stuff.  Like why did he break those chairs? In the early 70s, he would break a chair at the end of every performance.  Did you ever see him perform? His last song was always Volunteer Slavery. So hitting on the gong and all the musicians playing avant garde, the bassists and the drums, this wasn’t enough. He had to break a chair. I didn’t get it.

Well, the breaking of the chair had gotten to be a signature of sorts. Now some places had a lot of money at that time. The colleges had money. The kids could bring in jazz, rock, whatever they wanted. But other places did not.  When Rahsaan broke the chair at Shelly’s Manhole, I remember Shelly made him pay $12 every time he did it.

I finally got the courage to ask him. “Why do you do that? What does that mean?” It was hard work to break chairs. Some of them were put together very well. And the college kids, this was back in the acid days, they would be screaming, freaking out. They got so frenzied, almost riotous. But when I asked him, he was like, “Oh, you wouldn’t understand.” He had a way of dismissing me. I hated that. I asked him one more time.” Is this your way of protesting the system?” Well, he didn’t answer me again. But Rahsaan would not have let me go around thinking something that wasn’t true.  I assumed that was the right answer. I always wanted to do my own interview with him. I needed to know some answers.

Rahsaan was not afraid of dying. He would talk about dying very freely. He used to say that death was just another level of living or something like that. To me, no way. When you’re dead, you’re dead. I can still see Hilton Ruiz once, when he was 19 or 20 years old. We were on a plane, maybe a 747 or DC-8, a big plane, and there was a lot of turbulence. Hilton was all scared. He came up to sit by Rahsaan. Rahsaan was saying, “What’s the matter, brother? Everything’s going to be ok. If it go down, I just go down playing my flute.” He had an almost embracing attitude toward death. Whereas, me, it’s like, “Oh no, not ready!”

When I saw that his health was deteriorating and he’d made out a will leaving almost everything to me with certain stipulations, I would ask him, “Rahsaan, what about so and so with your music?” He used to say, “You’ll know what to do.” Yeah, it made me feel good that he had so much faith and trust in me to leave me with the music and the publishing , to protect his image and the music, even though I did not know a lot about the music and I’ve tried to live up to what he wanted or didn’t want.

Even though Rahsaan had health issues, the day he died it was the farthest thing from my mind. People live a long time on dialysis and with high blood pressure, issues like that. And even though he didn’t always do what the doctor told him to do, it didn’t seem like he was dying. It was a Monday, he died of a heart attack in the car on the way to the Indianapolis airport. We were going to Joe Siegel’s in Chicago. It was like, “I’m out of here.”  Thirty years later his friend Joel Dorn-a week after I did the tribute to Rahsaan-also died of a heart attack in the middle of the day on a Monday not in the hospital (Joel was in his ophthalmologist’s office). That still creeps me out. So similar.

Ok, so he dies. And people come after me with this and that. Now Rahsaan early on had made me read This Business of Music-you know, with the brown cover,  just so I would understand something about what was going on and why he wanted his own publishing company, which he did have, RoKir Music. I read it and I didn’t understand a darn thing. So I read it again. And again. It started making sense when he would go into the recording studio and record his music or someone else’s music; then I was living what the book was talking about. So I’d go back and read it again. Things aren’t a big deal unless you don’t understand them. Then they’re a big deal.

People wanted me to sign away this and that. Lease Rahsaan’s music. I could talk to the entertainment lawyers but the decisions were mine. And it wasn’t my music, even though it was mine now on paper. It was Rahsaan’s music. I have tried to do the right thing regardless of the money offered. And I was someone who could use some money.  But when I didn’t know what to do, I did nothing. And you know what, that worked!

So I had some money. I wasn’t going to be homeless. My two younger daughters were in high school and my eldest was working at Bamberger’s. She had a baby who I looked after during the week.  I sat home with my Yorkshire terrier, a Doberman and a grandbaby. By the way, that baby is 37 years old now. On weekends I went to New York to see friends. And I thought I would just spend the winter-Rahsaan died on December 5, 1977-figuring out what to do with myself.

I did that until February when Steve Robinson and Bob Drinkwater who were running the Vibration Society up in Boston called and started pestering me about what I was going to do. It had been a hard winter and there was still snow on the ground. “Leave me alone,” I kept saying. “It’s too soon.” Steve is out in Chicago now at WFME.  He had done the Radio Free Rahsaan program with Rahsaan, so we were all friends. Well, he insisted on visiting me with Bob, wouldn’t listen to no.

WBGO Is Born-A New Chapter 

Long story short, Steve, who is full of ideas to this day, had an idea that I should meet this guy Bob Ottenhoff who was starting a public radio station over in Newark.  It wasn’t even a radio station yet. It was just a license. Well, I didn’t even know what public radio was, although I figured out later that Rahsaan must have been listening to public radio stations all along. He didn’t like commercial this and commercial that.

Steve insisted that I meet the guy and insisted to the guy that he hire me right then. It didn’t take any nudging. Bob said, “Ok.” Just like that. I was thinking, Hmm. I already know that Steve is crazy. This guy must be crazy too. But it really wasn’t that crazy. Steve knew that I knew every musician that existed back then; he knew that I knew all the record companies. Steve worked in public radio up in Boston so he understood what a start-up station would need and that I was the perfect person to be part of this one with plans for a straightahead jazz format.  At that time, RVR was still on the air with its commercial jazz format, etcetera etcetera.

So Bob was like, ok, I’ll hire her. They had talked and they either knew what they were doing or had a lot of luck. Because now it’s 34 years later, and WBGO is 24 hours on the air and going strong.  But when I came on board in October 1978, the station was located on the fourth floor of Newark Central High School. The license had belonged to the Board of Education and was transferred to Newark Public Radio Inc.  I was the third person that Bob Ottenhoff hired-just because Steve told him that I would be an asset. I didn’t understand it but they did.

We had nothing but a board of trustees and a $75,000 grant from the federal department of Health, Education and Welfare to start. Bob was in the process of doing three things when I came on board:  hiring his own staff, finding a building to buy (he had three that he was looking at), and, most important, easing out of the board of ed format and into the WBGO jazz format that it would become.

This was a big deal in Newark and some people are still mad even though the board of ed had started not to utilize those airways for the kids.  Bob credits Kenny Gibson, who was Newark mayor back then and a saxophone player of sorts, for being behind him. It was really meant to be.

You know that BGO are the initials of Bob Ottenhoff’s name? Robert George Ottenhoff. The station was born to Newark in 1949 and that was when Bob was born, too. And as much as we tried to change the call letters, we could not do it. Every combination we tried was already taken.  So WBGO has been a very unusual experience: a series of coincidences-which are only coincidences to atheists or agnostics, because we are all watched over by a higher being.

Bob chose the building we are in now over one in West Orange and an old furniture warehouse here in Newark that would have needed a lot of work. He paid, I remember, $125,000 for it in 1979. Can you imagine? It was drugland in 1979, though. Where the new New Jersey Performing Arts Center (NJPAC) is now, there were these two-storey motels, you know what kind I mean;  a methadone clinic down the hill…. The neighborhood was really bad. Now we’re in the center of the arts district.

An Exciting Time

People he hired were all really excited about the prospect of being in on something new and wonderful and the music and all that stuff. Everything we did was successful! When we get together now and look back, we’re amazed. Weren’t we stupid? we’ll say. But it all worked! We were too stupid to think that something would not work.

It was a community. Eventually it got to be nine of us, which meant we could be CPB (Corporation for Public Broadcasting) qualified. You had to be nine. Our first program guide was done on a stencil machine. I ruined some clothes. We all did it all. We were the maintenance people, did the coffee, made the program guide.

September 8, 1980, WRVR went off the air. At WBGO we were 18 hours up to then. We went 24 hours that day! Bob had no idea where he was going to get the money to hire a new person for those extra hours, but he did know that he had to take advantage and he did. I guess the rest is history.

My role has changed some over the years; obviously, my strength was with all the artists I knew. My first title was Music Coordinator. None of us knew what that meant because we didn’t have Program Director blah blah when we started. Al Pryor was the music director at first; he was the fourth person Bob hired; later the title of Program Director was created and he did that. He and I are still really good friends.

Ok: when I started, there was Bob Ottenhoff; his administrative assistant, Maxine Biggs; George Achaves, who would be considered the operations person; and he inherited Gil Abby, the engineer from the Board of Ed-he needed him, he kept him. So he had those people, then me, then Al. Bob knew he wanted news and public affairs, so he hired Fred Fishkin, who I think is still at CBS Radio. Then he hired Mercedes Sandoval for PR and Membership. Then we stole Rhonda (Hamilton) from Boston ; Art Vincent; Al Pryor would do a show; James Brown came in-Mr. New York as I choose to call him.  Long story short, it grew from there.

I’ve pretty much done the same thing, just more of it, since we began:  special events and community relations. That’s how we got known-special events, because we didn’t have money to buy ads or take spots on other stations or what have you. So when there would be jazz events, concerts,  shows, we would be there; we would get sponsorships, have our propaganda, and we would get to be known in that manner. And that really worked. We don’t do as much of that now, but I still arrange the interviews, the art shows at the station, and yeah, a lot of stuff.

Bethany Church and Jazz Vespers: A Departure for a Baptist Church

I belong to Bethany Church in Newark; Dr. Scott was the minister there when I joined and he retired after being there 37 years. Dr. Howard came in October 2000 and he is great. Jazz vespers started with him. Bethany had a Saturday service, the first Saturday of every month, that only about 25 or 30 people ever attended. Well, Dr. Howard came up with the idea of making it a jazz vespers, which was unheard of in the Baptist Church. He seemed to know about me before I ever knew he existed, which is amazing, so I guess he was planning for me to be involved with it.

Knowing that the Baptist Church has a philosophy of fire, brimstone, and the devil’s music being jazz yaddadadda, he is so smart, here’s what he did. He told the congregation all about the idea. He said, “Anyone wants to sign up, we’re going to go to St. Peter’s Church in New York, to their jazz vespers.” Girl, we had a busful! And the rest of us, who wanted to hang out after, we drove over. Dr. Howard did not try to sell anybody on this. He just said, “if you want to check this out, come.” So we went over to St. Peter’s, Pastor Lind was the head at that time, and the people saw how the jazz vespers worked. Some people were for it and some were not. Enough were for it that we instituted jazz vespers at Bethany and now we average about 200 people for that service every month, sometimes as many as 350 or 400, depending on the artists. This is a big part of what I give back to the church. I take care of jazz vespers.

Dr. Lind and Dr. Howard had known each other at the New York Theological Seminary when Dale Lind was a student and Dr. Howard was the President-the first African American President. Dr. Howard was the chair of the Rutgers Board of Regents-the first African American chair since its inception in 1766. Because of him we have had some heavyweights come to speak at Bethany: Cornell West, Dr. Gates…. I was able to get Bill Cosby for January 2013 because I have a relationship with him-he sat in and played drums with Rahsaan at the Village Vanguard; that’s when I met him and we’ve been in contact off and on since that time.

Saturday, June 2, ended our twelfth season of jazz vespers and we haven’t repeated the same artists except when we chose to. I don’t know where those years have gone.

We just ask that the people who come understand the value of what they are getting. Of course, we are the church, so we are free, but all this music, all these great musicians who happen to live in the tristate area and are available to come to us, we hope that the listeners are supportive  and show it with their presence and their pocketbooks.  Our budget is isolated from the rest of the church’s budget, we got some grants when we started up, and now we are doing ok. Hey hey.

Jazz Vespers is like a part-time job for me and for the two people who run the technology for the performances: the Lee brothers (I call them the geek brothers because they’re into all that):  Billy does the sound; he used to work for Apple. Jonathan runs the computer plant at Montclair State. So the two of them do the PR and Billy does the booklet, graphics and all that, along with Dr. Howard and Dr. Howard’s secretary. The other people on the committee are great but their responsibilities don’t kick in till right before: the reception committee, you know, greeters. I hand out Hot House and the New Jersey Jazz Society publications with them.

You think that I’m working all the time. But I’m not. Some of it I could do in my sleep, I’ve been doing it so long. I could go home and look in my Bethany files right now and find tons of musicians who are completely appropriate and who haven’t done jazz vespers for us yet.

What I do at Bethany is my spiritual work, my church and my volunteer organization. When I go there on a Sunday, I can’t wait to hear what Dr. Howard is going to say; he is a theologian, and he talks about issues that are staring us all in the face and he makes examples from life. That’s your motivating factor. But yeah, it could seem like a lot of work to someone else.

I guess because of how successful Jazz Vespers has been, Bethany has been asked to be part of a lot other jazz and cultural events in Newark, and I help organize and curate those too. Sometimes things get crazy. I’m looking at October now and here’s what’s going on. I’ve got Jazz Vespers October 6, and I kick off the WBGO Children’s Series; then the Geraldine Dodge Poetry Festival is October 11-14. The organizer of that has been to jazz vespers and he wanted Bethany to host one of the events. So we’ll do that. Right after that is the James Moody Jazz Festival. That’s NJPAC and WBGO. But NJPAC has designated Bethany as one of the venues to present music in.

Dorthaan’s Place-Kickoff October 21, 2012

The last day of the festival is special. October 21 is the kickoff date for Dorthaan’s Place, my own room at NJPAC! I am so excited.  I’ll have one Sunday a month at first-this is a jazz brunch-and we’ll see what happens.  There are a couple of challenges presented that I’m thinking about: How is it going to be structured to keep people happy so that they can both eat and listen to the music? How can we make sure that people aren’t too talkative and disrespectful to the music? And the music has to be jazz brunch appropriate-good music, up-to-date music,  but it’ll be real grassroots.. When it takes off, we’ll do it maybe twice a month and so on.

That’s a lot! It is, isn’t it? ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912203991.44/warc/CC-MAIN-20190325133117-20190325155117-00187.warc.gz

– Sylvia Levine Leitch

Joel Chriss:

Music has always been part of my life. From the age of four onward I heard a lot of music. We lived across the street from the Brooklyn Museum and my father would take me to symphonic concerts there. I went to a great grammar school-the best education of my life was in Brooklyn through sixth grade-Pete Seeger and other folk singers came in to perform for the kids. Everybody-our friends and family-listened to music on the radio too. My father was a big opera buff and had a minor interest in jazz, up to bebop: jazz lost him at bebop but he loved swing and early jazz. So I’d hear everyone from Wagner to Charlie Christian at home. The first thing my dad would do when we moved apartments was hook up his little hi-fi set, one of those Fisher tube things with a turntable. We always had music.

We moved out to Great Neck, Long Island, in 1969 in time for me to go to junior high and high school; I just naturally gravitated to the kids who played music. My father gave me a Gretsch drum kit, which he probably got from a legal client who couldn’t pay him in cash, and  at 12 or 13 I started playing drums: took some lessons, went everywhere with my practice pad, and at the same time developed an insatiable appetite for rock and roll music.

Rock and roll really drew me in even before that, with the British Invasion and bands like Freddie and the Dreamers, Herman’s Hermits, of course the Beatles, the Dave Clark Five, Jerry and the Pacemakers, Paul Revere and the Raiders. We first got hooked on that music in Brooklyn, and listened continuously-my cousins, friends, my sister, we were all into it. Every car trip, every sleepover was a singalong. My sister and I would play this game in the car of humming the rhythms of a tune and trying to guess the melody.

Big Venue, Enthusiastic Crowd-First Time

In Great Neck I found friends ( lifelong friends, it turned out) interested in country rock: Buffalo Springfield,  Crosby Stills Nash & Young, Loggins and Messina. That music really got under my skin. In my early teens I got my first taste of the excitement, the electricity, of a big concert hall filled with music fans. A couple of us took the Long Island Railroad into Manhattan for a Carnegie Hall concert of Delaney and Bonnie and Friends with Eric Clapton and Billy Preston, and the first Loggins and Messina show-before the record came out. Well, I had been to some small rock concerts and heard symphony orchestras, but I had never experienced the enthusiasm of a rock and roll crowd. I thought news of this crowd’s excitement would be on the front page of The New York Times the next day, but I found out that this kind of event happened all the time.

This same friend, a very precocious kid, Bobby, discovered that if you wrote to record labels and told them that you were covering music for your school newspaper, they would send you LPs. So by the age of 14, he had a huge record collection. I would go to his house and we would listen to everything from the Beach Boys to John Coltrane.

There was an important club in Roslyn, Long Island, called My Father’s Place and kids who were also musicians and I would go there with our fake ID. No one would serve us drinks because we clearly weren’t old enough, but I guess the club owners could tell we needed to hear the music. We were basically obsessed with rock and roll-discovering bands before they became bigger names, tracing the genealogy of the bands-and prided ourselves on knowing who was who. At My Father’s Place there was all kinds of music-from Hall and Oates before they became popular to Count Basie, Joe Williams, very early Spyro Gyra, and some of the early CTI artists like Joe Farrell.

At some point I discovered the Bottom Line and some of the other Manhattan clubs of the early 1970s and really began to hear a broader spectrum of music. I still had a desperate love affair with rock and roll, but for example, I was at a Warner Brothers show when they were starting out their jazz label-somehow I found out about this show-and they were trying to decide who to sign. So there was Rahsaan [Roland Kirk], Pat Martino, and George Benson playing at this one show. George was just letting people know that he could sing and be an entertainer; I had been following him as an amazing guitar player and had picked up those CBS records with the black and white covers.  Looking for what the next musical step for me, for my listening should be, I went back to the roots of rock to the blues, to the ancestors, and listened to Muddy Waters, Howlin’ Wolf, Robert Johnson…

Bobby and I would go to concerts in New York. We also went to Max’s Kansas City at Park Avenue and 16th Street. Patti Smith and the whole Andy Warhol crowd would hang out there. I remember hearing Alex Chilton, the Box Tops, at Max’s.  I got a whiff of that Andy Warhol/Lou Reed scene.  But a truly memorable experience was the night we went to the Village Vanguard. Neither of us knew of it before. But we had heard about something great going on there and we went. Well, when we got there, we discovered that the cover charge was way beyond what we could pay. So we sat down on the steps in that hallway on the other side of the door- to maybe hear a little something. After about 10 to 15 minutes, Max Gordon opened the door and waved us in. It was Keith Jarrett’s original American quartet with Dewey Redman, Charlie Haden and Paul Motian.

Jazz Awakening

Nothing was ever the same after that. I had no idea what I was listening to. That music was way beyond my consciousness level at that time. But I knew it was powerful, knew there was communication going on up on that bandstand that I wanted to understand but didn’t. Seeing and hearing these artists truly enticed me and raised my curiosity toward other musical and communication levels-these guys felt different to me. It seemed like they possessed some secret knowledge or understanding. They looked like they were committed to something beyond anything I had ever experienced. And their playing indicated that there was a level of music that was way beyond what I knew.

My other teenage passion was ice hockey. And that was how I got into college, because I was an all-Long Island hockey player. I applied late but was able to make the team at Ithaca College, which I chose because I had friends in the area. I wasn’t really studying music so I couldn’t get in on my musicianship, but hockey-I went to my first Rangers game in 1961 and it made a lasting impression. It was in the old Madison Square Garden, Rangers vs. Detroit Red Wings with Gordie Howe. Alex Delvecchio,  and Rangers Andy Bathgate and Dean Prentiss . Like the first rock and roll concert I went to years later, I had never seen that kind of enthusiasm and passion in the spectators, screaming at every goal, every hit, every fight. And it was a memorable game-the most penalty minutes of all time up to that point. The legendary Terry Sawchuck fought Gump Worsley.

My first day at college I bought a guitar.  Right away, I was torn between music and hockey.  I was there to play hockey and I loved it, but I was hanging out with people who listened to music all day. My first weekend at school I reconnected with my old sixth grade buddy Bobby Stein; we went to a concert over at Cornell, the very early Weather Report on a double bill with John McLaughlin and the Mahavishnu Orchestra. He and I had heard the Mahavishnu Orchestra in Central Park. I remember I went right out after that and bought Inner Mounting Flame.

So my musical tastes were developing, although I had not lost interest in rock and roll. I signed up for guitar lessons at school, but it was classical guitar and it was beyond my abilities. I didn’t even have calluses. It requires years to learn the basics and a lifetime to become a musician, but I stuck with it and learned, and have not really put it down since, close to 40 years. Between playing and listening, I really wanted to develop a more sophisticated way of engaging with music. I wanted to become a player, or at least a more serious listener.

I left Ithaca College after one semester-I was on the bench and it was frustrating; I remember coming home to New York during a big ice storm, and my dad was kind of relieved not to have the expenses of room and board. So I signed up at Hofstra and decided I wanted to write about music. I took some journalism courses and when I met the editor of the school paper, we hit it off right away-he immediately gave me four LPs and said, “Review them.” Luckily, this was stuff I knew: Hall and Oates, Jackson Browne, so the writing came naturally. I did that for two semesters but had a hard time getting to school-15 miles away on the highway-without a car. I dropped out and went to work for a sports newspaper, which turned out to be more of a gambling rag than anything. But this was in New York and I got to go out to all the clubs at night.

Listening to and Playing Jazz Guitar

While I was at Hofstra I also connected with Mathew, a good guitar teacher from Long Beach. He was a fine player who had a picture of Charlie Parker in his kitchen and one of Ornette in his bedroom. He turned me on to Bird and all of Bird’s disciples, as well as some Herbie Hancock tunes-not that I could play them, but they got in my ear. And he turned me on to Joe Pass: I had never heard a guitar player play like that! So I listened to Sounds of Synanon, Django and the Clare Fisher record, his stuff with the Jazz Crusaders and Les McCann, Gerald Wilson, I just developed as full an understanding as  I could of Joe Pass. Then I got into Jim Hall and at that time a record came out of his, Live. It was more uptempo than the other stuff I had heard of his and it was swinging. Then I went back and listened to all of his older recordings with Chico Hamilton, Paul Desmond, Bill Evans, Billy Taylor, the clarinet player Bill Smith. I had a strong desire to understand and really dig deep inside this music-and I was now listening, since the Village Vanguard night, to Milt Jackson, Freddie Hubbard, Trane, Sam Rivers, Wes Montgomery, following all the places that the music can take you.

Now I was 20 years old, hanging out, taking the LIRR into town, going to the Bottom Line, Gregory’s, the Vanguard, Boomer’s-I used to hear Clifford Jordan and Cedar Walton there all the time. (Actually, I’d been hanging out at Gregory’s even before that, when I was a teenager, with Jack Wilkins, Atilla Zoller, Chuck Wayne-Albert Dailey used to play there.) There was also the Brecker Brothers’ club, where the Breckers, Jaco Pastorius and Mike Stern used to hang out, and, later Sweet Basil.

I had a girlfriend in school at Stony Brook, so I went back to college and majored in history and journalism. The first course I ever took was with a New York Times writer, Irving Molotsky. He opened the semester by promising an automatic A to anyone who could name the only opera Beethoven ever wrote. Well, my dad’s opera enthusiasm came in handy. No one else even guessed. “That would be Fidelio,” I said. I did get the A but I went to classes anyway, and he was very encouraging. I worked with the college newspaper, The Stony Brook Statesman, and because it came out three times a week-way more than most college papers- I was able to build up my writing chops. I was arts editor and started the section “Proscenium,” where we reviewed books, theatre, stuff on campus.

Discovering Sonny Rollins 

Stony Brook had  some very good concerts while I was there. Along with James Taylor, the Doobie Brothers and Carly Simon, I heard Sam Rivers, Charles Mingus and Sonny Rollins. Some weren’t even well attended. Sonny was in a 250-seat theatre and there were probably only 100 people there. That was when he had just signed with Fantasy. Looking back, it was probably a comeback time, a resurgence time in his career. The record “Nucleus” had come out on Fantasy, which I still love; maybe it’s not classic Sonny, but it was the first one I had heard. Then I went back and listened to all the earlier stuff, with him and Max Roach, with Clifford Brown, Kenny Dorham, and became enamored with the sound, ideas, look and life of Sonny.

After graduation I moved to Woodside, Queens, in a two-bedroom apartment. I rented out the other bedroom and had enough money to hit the clubs six or seven nights a week, something I was to keep up for years, while I looked for jobs in music journalism-you know, use my education as a means for career development.  I wrote for some local publications: I got a number of bylines in Good Times, a Village Voice   knockoff based on Long Island. I did get a few assignments after sending resumes to literally dozens and dozens of publications:  I covered Sonny Rollins at Carnegie Hall, Gato Barbieri, Codona (Colin Walcott, Don Cherry, Nana Vasconcelos), but not much money.

To add to my meager income, I went to the Bottom Line-where I’d been hanging out for years anyway-and asked Allan Pepper for a job. This was 1979. He hired me to be floor manager/doorman. It paid a couple of bucks and I got to eat for free. I got to hear everybody: Bruce Springsteen hung there, Sonny Rollins played the Bottom Line in those years, and comedy acts, some amazing comedy improvisers. Uncle Floyd was a regular there [writer: didn’t know anyone else loved Uncle Floyd, we used to see him on public access TV in the middle of the night].

Dressing Room Access

Often I’d go in the dressing rooms to give the artists whatever they asked for and cleaned up after the show and that’s likely where I got comfortable being in the dressing rooms or other areas where artists hung out between sets. Sometimes I slept in the sound tech booth instead of going home to Queens and went to a day gig I had for a couple of months at a vanity publishing house right from there. I found a Y I could shower at on the way. Allan Pepper remained a friend long after that, well into my career as an agent.

Trying to piece together a living this way wasn’t working out great so eventually my father said, “Joel, if you want to be a journalist, you’ve got to be able to write about anything, not only music.” He suggested I try trade magazines; I didn’t even know what they were. But I sent out my resume to a bunch of them and got a job. I eventually worked for all kinds of food magazines, among them Dairy Field and, for four years, Natural Foods, and other industry and consumer publications.

Even with my day job, I was still playing guitar, going out to the clubs all the time, and developing my record collection of about 4,000 LPs, listening voraciously.  So when the publishing company got sold, I thought I’d take some time off.

I became a ticket scalper for a while-Yankees and Mets tickets-during the years when they were both very competitive and there was good money in it as well as the opportunity to see the games. I’d get arrested from time to time; there are actually holding cells down in the basements of both Yankee Stadium and Shea Stadium. They don’t take you down to the precinct. No, it’s down to the holding cell with the professional scalpers until the fifth inning, then they let you go. Still, that’s not really a career path.

My love and knowledge of jazz music helped me get the next job, one that was really way over my head. I answered an ad in The New York Times for a marketing specialist for Meredith Publications. The woman who interviewed me was on her way to a Duke Ellington Society party right after. I was enthusiastic and we talked about the great bands, Ben Webster, Harry Carney, Johnny Hodges. I knew way more than she did about Duke even though I was only 26. So she hired me. My colleagues were Princeton and Dartmouth business and journalism grads and they were in a different league. It was tense and I lasted less than a year, but I got a serious education that turned out to be invaluable.

Sweet Basil

I went to Mel and Phyllis at Sweet Basil and asked for a job. I’d been hanging out there practically from the first day it was open, before they owned it [writer: see the interview with Cho in this series for more on early Sweet Basil]. The first show at the club, I recall, was Barney Kessell and Herb Ellis; all the great guitar players played there, and I’d hear McCoy Tyner and Art Blakey there as well. So Mel and Phyllis already knew me, as did a lot of the musicians.

I was never afraid to get friendly with the players all those years I was hanging out, maybe that started when I worked at the Bottom Line and my job involved going into the dressing room. But I would go to the Village Gate, for example, knock on the dressing room door and hang out with Sonny Stitt like I belonged. I don’t know why that felt ok to me, but it did. I hung out in the kitchen at the Village Vanguard long before I had any reason to be there. Musicians didn’t care. I followed Dexter Gordon and Sonny Stitt around, everywhere they played. There was a year or two when they were hanging out a lot together in New York, and playing together too. One place on Fifth Avenue in particular, Chopped Meat Charlie’s or something like that, was a hamburger joint, but they had a music room, the Jazz Emporium, and Sonny and Dexter used to hang out there quite a bit for a while. One would have the gig and the other would sit in or vice versa. It was amazing. I’d sit at the bar, which was very close to the band; I’d even follow them right into the bathroom and watch them get high! Anyway, I got to know a number of musicians; I think they saw that it was more than just fandom, I was seriously interested in learning about the music, about the life, about understanding who they were.

So when I got the gig at Sweet Basil, I had some background. I was prepared to go to all the jazz clubs to find a job, but Mel and Phyllis needed a door guy right away. The title was Floor Manager/Doorman, but it was really a doorman gig. I think Steve took my job when I left [see the interview with Steve in this series].  I have to say that by this time, my father thought I was wasting my life away. Many years later, after Chriss & Company became successful, he said to me, “I just couldn’t imagine in those years that you were actually developing a specialty that would allow you to make a living for yourself.” He became a great supporter when I figured a way to make a life in the music.

I started thinking about how the business of music works. I asked the bartender, Cho, “How does this run? I mean, how do the musicians, the different bands get the jobs, get to the bandstand?”  Cho explained: “They have agents. Mel and Phyllis talk to the agents, or sometimes to the artists directly. They work out a deal and the band is given a date.” Hmm, I thought. Agents? I started hanging out a little more after the club closed, talking to them and to Allyson [see her interview in this series], and a couple of other people who worked there, drinking cognac, asking questions and getting a feel for how it all worked. One day, I said to Cho, “Hey, if any of these agent types come into the club, could you point them out to me?” Cho, of course, said he would.

Turning Point: Working as a Booking Agent

Cho called me over one night during a McCoy Tyner week. “See that guy over there? He’s McCoy’s agent-Abby Hoffer.” So I introduced myself and asked him if I could come to his office sometime. “I’m interested in what you do,” I told him. He said I could call him the next day. So I did. I got his wife Terry on the phone and talked her ear off for a good long time, probably more than half an hour. Well, she must have liked something about me because she said, finally, “You know, Abby’s not really looking to hire someone. But I’ve really enjoyed our phone conversation. So come in tomorrow or the next day, and I’ll make sure he has time to talk with you.” I did that and he was pretty brusque: “Listen,” he said, “don’t give me the hullaballoo you told my wife about how much you know about music. We’ve already had people work here who know the music, the musicians, but that doesn’t sell the music. It’s tough work, you’ve got to pound the phones, go through that Rolodex every week, just make calls, calls, calls. It’s tedious; it’s a pain in the butt. I’ll pay you  $100 a week.”

I told Mel and Phyllis about the interview and that Abby said he’d hire me. They told me I had to choose. I couldn’t work at the club and for an agent. I didn’t see the conflict at the time but they did. So I thought about it-I’d been at Sweet Basil about six months-and decided to go with Abby. I went from making $48,000 a year at Meredith Publications to earning $50 a night at Sweet Basil to $100 a week with Abby Hoffer. Financially speaking, I was going downhill fast. But in some mystical way, I thought I was making progress. I mean, I knew all along that being a doorman would be a stepping stone. But when I started, I had thought it might lead to one day managing or owning a club or going into the food and beverage area in a room with music. I knew that I wasn’t going to be working at a club staying out till 2 or 3 a.m., falling asleep on the subway, forever. There was a lot about working in the club that I liked, meeting the artists especially. I didn’t have to break up fights at Sweet Basil. Look at me, I’m  no bouncer. They’d assign me a bouncer at the Bottom Line-there were fights there, for sure, and John Curtin was the bouncer. (I ran into him years later at the Blue Note, he’s passed away now.) Maybe David Murray and Ming had a fight at Sweet Basil while I was there!

So, the first day, Abby says, “Here’s a desk, here’s a phone, here’s the roster list. Go to work.” It didn’t take long to see that Abby had all the “A” accounts, his son Paul had all the “B” accounts, and I got what was left over-little or nothing. However, cold calls would come in and the two women who ran the front office would decide where to send these calls. I got friendly with these women, taking them to lunch, buying  little gifts-a charm offensive. It worked because I had no competition! Abby and Paul, the whole family, really,  were kind of out of touch and we didn’t see the business or music in the same way.

But I stayed two and a half years with Abby Hoffer. I knew I needed an education in the business. Even if they didn’t teach me directly, I learned by osmosis. I worked in the office in the day and hung out in the clubs at night. Terry, Abby’s wife, used to warn me: “You can’t be both a day person and a night person.” “Well,” I’d think, “watch me!” So I’d strut in at 11 a.m. when I was supposed to be in at 10-and tell them the truth, I was out looking for new clients.  I wasn’t in the business to be disconnected from the music. I wanted to become part of it, to be an agent who represented artists out of a desire to see those artists succeed, because I loved who they were and what they did. I needed to be around the musicians, hear what they were doing, become more knowledgeable about the music, not only for the business but also for my own personal pleasure and growth.

I asked Abby why he couldn’t give me more money or at least a commission on money I brought in. He told me I was crazy. “You’re going to be an expense for at least six months: You’ll have to listen, develop relationships with promoters, it’ll be months down the road before you start making us any money.”  But by the end of the first week I had booked three dates. By the end of the first month I had 15. They weren’t big dates, but they were dates. I filled in some free days on McCoy Tyner’s itinerary and on Stephane Grapelli’s, maybe one or two for Phil Woods or Johnny Griffin. Itineraries were in big loose leaf binders at the time and I remember flipping through them looking for open dates. I had earned my salary for the first eight months in a month.

My secret weapon was an incredibly generous gesture from Art Blakey’s road manager, Mark Romero, before I left Sweet Basil. Art was playing the club that week and I told Mark that I was going to try working as an agent.  I asked him if there was any way that I could see the Messengers’ itinerary to get an idea of how it all worked. Well, he brought in a big memo book full of the dates for the previous five years! I had that book when I went to Abby’s. That’s how I was able to start booking dates so fast.  I could call these places, bring up that Art had played at their venue or festival,  and buyers would feel that I was in the loop.

So I went back to Abby and said, “Abby, this is inequitable.”  He said, “Ok, you’ve got $150 a week.” Then two months’ later, “Ok, you’ve got two percent commission”-or maybe it was five percent on everything I booked, something like that. Within about seven months I was making about $250. I could pay the bills.

I started to bring in artists-with not only no encouragement from Abby, but his antipathy. He didn’t think I could spot talent. “Nobody you bring in here will be bookable,” he’d say. Well, call it the cockiness of youth, whatever, I thought I could do it. “Maybe not right away,” I’d say, “but I can bring in people worth developing, and in a year from now, we can book them.” “What garbage,” he’d come back with. “I hear this stuff all the time and the band is someone’s relative or their wife’s relative.” What can you say to that?  But I did tell him that people I brought in would be on the scene for a very long time.

Art Blakey Lends a Hand Again

Art Blakey was again indirectly responsible for helping me out. The first artists I brought in were Terence Blanchard and Donald Harrison; I had gotten friendly with Blakey and knew Donald and Terence when they were with Art. When they started their own group, I invited them to meet Abby. I believe he was shocked when he met them and heard the music. I actually could spot talent!

That was an important first step in establishing my presence. I can’t tell you who worked out and who didn’t, but Terence and Donald were well respected and that gave me some cred. The next person I brought in was Kevin Eubanks, who I had first met at a Chinatown bar where he was playing with Sam Rivers. I thought he was a unique guitar player; he had been with Arista when Bruce Lundvall was there (Kevin was part of an Arista concert at Carnegie Hall) and later on moved to GRP. Then there was Cassandra Wilson, Geri Allen, and Bobby Watson- I brought them to the agency and they were all bookable or became bookable.

Abby and Paul held tightly onto all the best and most frequent presenters and were booking the bands that I brought them at all the venues with reasonable budgets. I told Abby it didn’t seem right that I introduced all these new artists to the agency and didn’t get compensated when they were booked in the better venues. I thought I should get a small percentage when artists I was responsible for got booked.” “Absolutely not,” was the reply. “Are you sure about that?” I asked. “Yeah,” he said. “We’ll see what happens in a few years.” I began to plan my departure.

The Abby Hoffer office was a duplex. I made my move one day when everyone was upstairs in a meeting with McCoy Tyner. It wasn’t planned exactly. I had brought a canvas bag because I was staying at my girlfriend’s place that night and had a few things with me. But I was alone downstairs and I realized: This is the time. I put my rolodexes, log books,  and some directories in that bag and yelled upstairs, “Hey, Abby, have a good weekend.” I never came back. I did see him over the weekend at the Blue Note-Stephane Grappelli was playing there-and told him in person that I was leaving the agency. Encouraging? No. He said, “If you’re going to start your own agency, that’s a stupid idea. It’s a crazy business and besides, there’s a whole level of finance that you don’t know anything about -it requires that you hire people, have a knowledge of accounting. Don’t try it.”

J. Chriss & Co. Opens for Business

Next day, I started making calls. I was still living in Queens. There weren’t any computers in our business yet and everything happened on the phone and in the mail. You had to make packages to send out and give away. I called Betty Carter and she said, “List me.” It wasn’t exclusive but I could put her on my client list. The same with Bobby Watson, Geri Allen, Kevin Eubanks and Emily Remler. I didn’t call any of Abby’s clients except to let them know that I’d left-and I got a lot of positive feedback, regrets from artists that they didn’t have me to deal with at Abby’s office.

Within a few months, I had put together a pretty good roster. Without any solicitation Johnny Griffin called me, later so did Phil Woods, and then I heard from many artists who might have gone to Abby first in the past, to see if I was interested in representing them. It was a good time to be an agent for musicians here in the U.S. and abroad: the European festival scene was pretty strong at that time; they had just developed the federation of festivals, banding together to block book tours so that they could bring in many of the same artists.

I hired a friend to help me organize the business; he was out of work at the time and I was glad to have his skills, even though he wasn’t into jazz particularly. Then I hired a guy right out of the University of Michigan that I met at a panel discussion.  My mother worked for me for 14 years. I had the good fortune or the knack for hiring the right people at the right time. The music was so vital to me and I think lots of artists and promoters were attracted to the agency because they felt my passion. Seth Abramson, for example, who now books the Jazz Standard, was a long-term employee, and I think stayed with the agency because of its artist-centered culture. Eric Addeo, who now has his own agency, was with me for 13 years. Brian Friedman became a comedy agent. Sam Kaufman went into music marketing. A lot of good people came through as employees and a lot of great people came through as artists. I was extremely fortunate over the course of about 23 years, from 1986-87 to 2008 to have worked with not only established giants like Johnny Griffin, Max Roach, and Phil Woods, but top emerging players too.

So many artists worked with J. Chriss & Co.: Dave Holland, Joe Lovano, Cassandra Wilson, Pat Martino, Bill Charlap, Dave Douglas, so many amazing musicians. We worked really hard at it and I’m proud of the job we did. I created a life and a business that provided immense pleasure. Some artists stick around for many years, and some don’t. As loyal as musicians may want to be or say they want to be, when they feel they’ve gone as far with you as they can, even if they’re wrong, they tend to try somewhere else to know if it is possible to get to that next level. That’s the reality you have to live with and sometimes a heart-wrenching aspect of the business.

The Fluidity of the Jazz Life

At its peak J. Chriss & Company was one of the most active booking agencies in the world. It certainly was not like other businesses. What I’ve spent my life doing over the past 26 years has been a continuing education, more than a bit mind twisting, but I’ve done what I wanted to do. There is a fluidity to everything that goes on in the music booking, management and production business. It’s not always, “Hey, we’ve put together this tour” and everybody does it. So many things can go wrong and they all have to go right or the whole sand castle crumbles. Everything is in motion all the time. At the peak of J. Chriss & Co., with 500 to 600 dates booked a year, there were multiple crisis to be managed every day: people got sick, people cancelled, sometimes one side or the other would try to renegotiate at the eleventh hour. It’s a unique perch into the human heart and mind: competing interests and everyone involved trying to get a seat at the table-literally, musical chairs.

The old school business pros and musicians were masters at finding ways to squeeze more money out of any situation: It was not that unusual for someone to sign a contract, wait till the promoter publicized the event, and then demand more money. So you learn how to cope and what your breaking points are, what your limitations are in dealing with human beings who are capable of a whole range of behaviours-from the most altruistic and giving to, really, near criminal! It’s an education like nothing else I could have had.

Putting It All Together-Recording and Touring

At the same time as I was putting J. Chriss & Company together, I worked as an A & R man for Arabesque Records. They asked me to manage the label when I Ieft Abby Hoffer, but I thought I could still work with them in some other capacity while building my agency. So I got my brother hired to run the label-at that time their focus was mostly classical with a few jazz releases by Billy Taylor-with an agreement that we could actively pursue recording jazz. I brought in the music and my brother did most of the heavy lifting. Over the years we recorded Charles McPherson, Art Farmer, Dave Douglas, Ray Drummond, Jane Ira Bloom, Thomas Chapin, Edward Wilkerson, Jr., Frank Foster, Carmen Lundy, Bobby Sanabria, Craig Handy, Horace Tapscott, and Billy Hart-that’s a partial list. We released around 75 CDs before the business climate changed and the financial backer became less reliable. Having a label to record some of my artist clients on opened up another dimension for my own expression: It was kind of a complementary way to support artists, and build audiences within a creative process and with gifted musicians.

Someone else that I worked closely with and formed a lasting friendship with was Paxton Baker. I met him in the mid 1980s; he was booking music as a student at Temple University. We worked on a Kevin Eubanks concert date together that was cancelled because of a blizzard; but that was the start of a strong friendship, which led to creating a jazz circuit in the Caribbean where Paxton had made important contacts. He’d come to New York from Philly and hang at my place, talk till the wee small hours, listen, dream about a life in the music, brainstorm. To get ahead in anything, I think you have to build alliances, relationships, with people who share your passion, and are also willing to put time, energy and brains into figuring out how to live the life imagined. Paxton and I never forgot those early days. Now, 25 years later, he just donated some musical charts and other possessions of the Dizzy Gillespie estate that he owned to Jazz at Lincoln Center.

An Open Door

My apartment has always been open to musicians who live and play in New York. In addition, a few jazz heavyweights who didn’t live here called my place home when they came to New York City: Johnny Griffin, Mal Waldron, Von Freeman and others I can’t even remember always had a bed or couch to sleep on in the Village.

Griffin’s health was in serious decline the last time he visited New York.  I recall that it was one of the big Jewish holidays-Yom Kippur maybe. Griffin was opening at the Blue Note for a couple of nights and then going on to Duke University for a few days of concerts, clinics and workshops. On the morning of the first night at the Blue Note, Griff was clearly struggling just to get out of bed. I took him to the hospital, to St. Vincent’s in the Village, and he was checked in.  At the very least he needed some IV nutrition and hydration. Well, around 5 p.m. he looked at me, squeezed out a smile, and said, “Get me out of here. I’ve got musicians waiting for me.” He made the gig and went on to Duke. I’ll never forget his courage and determination. He returned home to the south of France where he’d lived since the 1960s, and I never saw him again.

His was the generation that lifted my own personal bandstand. Bebop, the language and the great practitioners, grabbed my soul early and completely. I need all kinds of music in my life, but my music and soul models from my early teens on were: Griffin, Phil Woods, Jackie McLean, Bud, Dizzy, Dexter, Sonny, Blakey, Stitt, Brownie, Miles and Trane. Most of that generation is gone but I still hear their voices-I could list many more, Tommy Flanagan, Hank Jones, Art Farmer, George Adams, Don Pullen, Clifford Jordan, Art Taylor-so many singular sensations that won’t pass this way again.

A New Era-Decision Time

By 2008 the business started to tail off.  You could see the political landscape changing-Republicans paying off their debts. A big change was that the recording industry was no longer a prime mover in the marketing end of the business. I used to be able to call up people like Matt Pierson, Bruce Lundvall, Tom Everett, and George Butler at the major labels and say, “If you want to get your new signings-say Jacky Terrasson or Cyrus Chestnut-on the road, let’s make a tour plan.” I could go into their offices, make a proposal, and something-maybe $5000 or $10,000-would come through for the tour. When it wasn’t money, it might be tickets, or a big PR push for radio. The labels were a powerful source of marketing/promotion in our world-a speck of beach sand compared to other, more commercial styles, but they could pledge something you could take to promoters with the hope of persuading them to book your clients.

That conversation could no longer be had in 2007, 2008. But labor costs and real estate costs were not going down. The era of booking 500-600 dates a year was over, for me. So I made a strategic decision to get out of that office with its $6000 price tag and alert my employees that they would have to find other work; a quarter of a million in salaries was no longer feasible. Most of my decisions were based on gut instinct and that’s still the way I operate. I’m working with fewer artists now but doing other things that are more interesting to me at this point in time. But booking/management will always be a part of my daily work. I’m excited about creating new performance opportunities and developing the next generation of music appreciators and, of course, working with amazing new artists. Really, I’m just trying to contribute in ways that make sense to me now.

As much as the business of music-of all the arts-is going through an upheaval and nobody knows where it’s leading, there are many musicians who really excite me. All of us who care have to invent the next economic model. Transitions are tense but I believe jazz and its principles have to be central to reorienting the world if we’re going to keep our humanity as we progress.

The current generation of players and all generations , say the musicians of Peter’s [referring to Peter Leitch, the writer’s husband] generation who are still playing continue to inspire me. I mean, I just got hip to Don Friedman; rediscovering people like  Peter or Don when they have reached master level is exciting, as is discovering younger artists who are really committed. Maybe the psychology has changed a little, but the commitment is there: Jon Irabagon , Myron Walden, Brian Blade, Jaleel Shaw, Bill McHenry, Michael Formanek, Marty Ehrlich, Myra Melford, Jane Ira Bloom, J.D. Allen-so much inspiring music. But the reactionary forces will continue to present obstacles and challenges.

My father commented years ago when we were sitting in our den, sipping some scotch and listening to something swinging: “You really found some truth in this music.” He helped me find my way.

71,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/inservice/oliva-leauanae-spirit-rhythm/,"Oliva Le’auanae The soft-spoken New Zealander Oliva Le’auanae was a bartender and a doorman in New York City jazz Clubs from the late 1970s until 2001, when Sweet Basil closed. His journey to jazz began when he learned the traditional instruments and dances of his Western Samoan heritage, performing in a family troupe on a global tour that ended in New York City. Oliva was drawn not only to the sound of jazz music but to the warmth of the artists and their families. Here is his story in this latest installment of my “In Service of Jazz” series.

Oliva Le’auanae:

I was a bartender in jazz rooms from the late 1970s, first at Paulson’s, then at Lush Life, and  then at Sweet Basil  for almost 20 years until it closed in 2001, with a few years’ hiatus when I went back to New Zealand, where I’m from. Well, I’m Samoan, actually, Western Samoan, but moved with my family to New Zealand when I was four years old.

At 21, I left New Zealand to travel with a family troupe of Polynesian entertainers- 10 dancers, musicians and drummers known as the Royal Polynesian Revue.  Although I did not at first want to go, my family decided that I should, and so I went: my niece was the founder and the main dancer and her eldest brother, my nephew, was the business manager. My sister would not have allowed her daughter to tour without her older brother-so my nephew, who had a successful career in broadcast journalism, and I gave up what we were doing in New Zealand and went on tour for seven years. That’s how I ended up in New York-at the end of our global tour.

So the first music that I heard and was immersed in was Polynesian music: there are three basic chords-three major and a minor and that covers most of the tunes of the Polynesian islands. The rhythms were very simple, and because of that upbringing I was more in tune with country and western music than any other-country and western was very popular in Polynesia. I drummed, and the drum rhythms were very basic too. They matched up with the Tahitian dancer’s moves-men and women dancers-which told a story.

I played on drums made out of hollowed out logs. Rosewood is the best wood to use for a Polynesian drum.  A Tahitian boy showed us how to make our own, how to choose a log and hollow it out-the sound of a cylindrical log gets deeper the more you hollow it out. He was the lead drummer and his drum was not as bassy as what I played, which was double sticks, later the snare, and there were two or three other drummers. It sounded quite good.

New York-from Polynesian Drummer to Programmer, Fire Knife Dancer and Slap Dancer
When we got to New York we broke up and several of us joined other groups.  But through someone we had met in Beirut, I connected with his cousin In charge of data processing for a bank; he liked me, sent me to a nine-week intensive course at NYU and I became involved in data programming for him for a couple of years.  All the while I was also freelancing with a Polynesian group, not as a drummer at first: I did not offer this group my drumming, but rather the fire knife dance and the slap dance, which I had learned back home in New Zealand. I continued to perform these dances for about 10 years after I came to the States.

I stopped into Paulson’s, a new Icelandic bar in the Upper West Side, with my wife, who would soon become my ex-wife, one afternoon. She was blonde and gorgeous. I’d been in Iceland on tour and we went in to order some seal and schnapps, a traditional combination I’d had in Iceland. Even though we were dressed like business people-I had on a three-piece suit-the bartender later told me that he prepared for trouble when we walked in. He thought I was Latino and would take offense if someone commented on my wife’s looks. He thought I not only would cause trouble but would drive away the regulars that he had worked so hard at attracting to this new bar. I didn’t know this, of course, and asked for a beer; he’d grabbed a Grolsch bottle, prepared to hit me with it, but when he heard my odd accent, introducing myself and asking politely for a beer and a glass of wine for my wife, he put the beer on the bar and said, “This one’s on me.” We later became close friends and when I went through the divorce he was really there for me, I even stayed on his couch a couple of nights during that rough period.

Minding the Door and Tending Bar at Paulson’s 

This bartender, I soon found out, was one of four owners as well as an ex-tae kwon do instructor; his form was of the American Federation (AFT) and mine was international (ITF), so we would meet in the park and practice, learn from each other. Eventually he hired me at as the doorman at Paulson’s. It became a popular place and it could get rough occasionally. I helped out with that as doorman.

Through my experience with the four owners I was able to learn a lot about the restaurant business. I am an introvert by nature-being on stage those seven years, I just spent time with the family. Working at Paulson’s brought me out of myself. I wanted to learn things. I learned from the owners how they treated their friends and contacts. These people came in because they knew and liked the owners. I realized that I had been lonely and enjoyed this camaraderie very much.

Paulson’s laid the groundwork for being a jazz bartender-I learned to communicate with people from behind the bar. I really want to thank those four owners for that: Sella Paulson-actually from Iceland; Steve McGraw,who became  my closest friend;  Bob Anzel; Tim…whose last name I don’t remember (he changed the tunes on that great jukebox), and their assistant Emmett McGraw-Steve’s brother and also a close friend.  A lot of actors and other performing artists went there-I was studying acting at the time and, in fact, shared a mentor with a couple of the waiters, who were also actors-and some of my former customers are quite well known now, Kevin Bacon and John Heard among them.

One night there was a problem at the bar, two or three people were involved and things happened pretty quickly. I laid out one guy, Steve had the other guy, and was about to go for the third. John Heard intervened on that last one: “Don’t hit this guy! I’ll talk to him!” But he had to go anyway; his friends had already been put out.

Paulson’s Built A Jazz Room

At Paulson’s I was introduced to jazz when we built a room with a stage upstairs from the original bar. Sandy and Blaise, who eventually went on to run Sweet Basil, came in to run the jazz room. They brought their own bartender, Scott Sternbach, still my friend today, more than thirty years later.

But before the jazz room was built, I moved from the door to the bar.  I learned bartending by watching the owner tend bar during my shifts. His vision for Paulson’s was that it should be a neighborhood bar where women could feel safe and I liked this. He said, “Oliva, if a couple gets into an argument and someone has to be thrown out, throw out the man-no matter who is right or wrong. ” That’s how he made his bar’s reputation. It even got to the point where we’d escort women home who were too wasted to get home safely on their own: we had a good neighborhood bar. He also built up his clientele by going around to other bars-I usually went with him-and buying rounds for people, the waiters, even the bartender. Then we’d get into a conversation and mention that Paulson’s had a late license, open till 4 a.m. instead of the usual 2 a.m. license, so if they came in after work to unwind, we’d stand them  for a drink. It became a very popular busy place through Steve’s ideas like that one. (Of course, those of us who worked till 4 had yet another place to go after closing to unwind-the Game Room around the corner was open all night and we’d stumble out of there sometimes at 11 a.m.)

Opening Up to Jazz Music and Musicians

After Sandy and Blaise opened the club upstairs, I enjoyed the music, of course, but I remember the first time I was really struck by the incredible minds and sense of humor of many jazz musicians. I think it was a night Junior Mance was playing. Marty Rivera was the bassist and I was bartending in that room. Well, the jukebox downstairs was so loud that the bass came through the floor, boom, boom, boom.  The time was different, of course, than what the musicians upstairs were playing. But Marty went right with the song on the jukebox during his solo and completely adjusted the time to mimic that sound. When I heard that, I just thought it was really neat. From that moment on, I really started listening. I could tell that these were very accomplished musicians-very different from the strumming ukulele players back home.  I didn’t know who was who but I could tell that the level of the musicianship was much higher than I had ever heard-these guys were serious professionals.  At first I thought they must all have been classically trained, but I later understood that they were very proficient in their own form, in American jazz, rather than European classical music.

The syncopated rhythms of jazz, the amazing way the players improvise and take the tune all kinds of places, is amazing. I still wonder how they get back to where they started after the improvised parts. I continue to feel amazed by that.

Of course, having played the Polynesian drums, at first I was particularly attracted to the drums. The first jazz drummer I heard who really impressed me was Philly Joe Jones. He would just scan the cymbals, barely touch them-but make such sounds!

I learned about the sound of the music and of different groups before I became focused on the specific personnel.  I got to know the leaders first because I paid the bands, and I always gave the money to the leaders. But little by little I began appreciating and respecting the individual musicians.

Sheila Jordan and the Night of John Lennon’s Death-December 8, 1980

One memorable night at Paulson’s, Sheila Jordan, Harvie S, Bob Moses and Steve Kuhn were on stage. Sheila had just started a tune when the sounds of sirens outside, a lot of sirens, filled the place. We figured something big had happened and the busboy went out to investigate. When he came back he was in a trance. “John Lennon is dead. He just got shot,” was all he said.

Everyone in the room was shocked. We were all Beatles fans there, and John Lennon had lived just down the street-so were especially John Lennon fans. The busboy was so stunned he couldn’t function. The news got to Sheila somehow, she had just started a song, but turned it into a Beatles song in that way great musicians have of just segueing into something else effortlessly. Experiences like that are unique.

On to Lush Life in the Village

Paulson’s wasn’t really working out as a jazz room around then; Forbidden Broadway came in and did a lot better than the music ever did. So Sandy and Blaise found another place to present jazz-Lush Life down in the village. I asked them to take me with them and they did: Scott, me and a couple of the waiters who were my fellow actors.

At Lush Life I was more maître d’ and doorman than bartender.  By then I really appreciated the music. I guess it had happened by osmosis, seeping through the membrane between me and the personnel. I started to like the artists and respect them. There was nothing nasty about the jazz musicians, even when they were drunk. I could say, “Maybe you shouldn’t drink any more tonight,” to someone who’d had a bit too much and the guy might even say, “Yeah, you’re right.” That surprised me, coming from Paulson’s where drunks could be belligerent. “AAAAh, I’ll have another,” was the normal response, and I’d have to throw him out.  But the musicians were not like that.  Their music showed how intelligent they were, educated through spending so many hours with their art. With people like that who pursue their art so single-mindedly, people who are focused, disciplined, dedicated, committed, you can’t go wrong with people like that.

My acting teacher used to say that I lacked commitment. I don’t think I did. I’d say, “I am trying.” He didn’t realize that, in fact, acting had always been part of my life. I mean, I’m Samoan educated as an Englishman in New Zealand. At home I was Samoan, at school I was English. I had a dual personality-we all did. Samoans are closer to their emotions, I think, and want to get their hands on a situation; whereas the educated Englishman would try to think his way through it. Anyway, I could go either way-asking myself: “Do I react to this as a Samoan or as an Englishman? Do I beat the shit out of someone or talk through it?” I did some Shakespeare, some other roles, and performed in parks, schools, and prisons as well as in theatres before I eventually gave up acting. But I recognized and admired the commitment of the jazz musicians.

One special night at Lush Life, I felt that I really “got” the music. I guess it’s ok to say now, because the place is long gone. Everybody smoked a joint of the same stuff-the band and the bartenders, everybody. I felt so connected to the band and the music that night. They sounded good! And I felt good afterwards. It seemed that I could really follow what they were doing and be right there as they played, know what was going to be played next. The musicians asked if there was any more of that stuff when they came off the bandstand. Maybe the weed brings out the creativity that is otherwise held back. I don’t know. I haven’t smoked a joint in years now.

Back to New Zealand-A Hiatus

In 1982 I went back to New Zealand to be with my father who was dying, and helped him take care of himself. I think being his constant shadow prolonged his life and that was wonderful. I spent four years there, longer than expected. While in New Zealand, I became exposed to reggae music and went to clubs with my nephew, meeting all sorts of reggae musicians. I guess you could say that I enjoy various kinds of music. Growing up with four basic notes seems to have worked well for me.

Sweet Basil and the Rhythms of Jazz

When I got back to New York in 1986 Scott Sternbach helped me get a job at Sweet Basil, where he was working. Of course, he is a photographer as well as a bartender, and was also working taking pictures at the same time as he worked at the bar. Another great thing happened when I was visiting Scott at the bar before I worked there: I met Allyson Paul [writer’s note: see Allyson’s interview in this series], who was waitressing there. We would get together a few of years later and still are to this day. She said after we were already a couple that she’d checked me out one time when I was just visiting Scott, but heard that I was married and stayed away from me. But a couple of years later, I wasn’t married anymore….

I was happy to be back listening to jazz and being around the people. What I find attractive about the music is not so much the lyrics or the melody of a tune, it’s the rhythm.  Certain types of rhythm attract me. Jazz has such a variety; I am just drawn to listening to it. I like the way the musicians in a group follow each other. It’s like the interaction between a Tahitian girl dancing and the drummers. My niece, for example, does this routine where the moves are really fast, then stops, a pause, then duh, duh, duh, unh, dun, uh, duh. She asked Alex, the head drummer, to create sounds for the moves. As the moves and the drumbeats progressed, her steps went first into a hexagonal shape, and that transformed into a circle. I see the interactions in jazz as something like that.

I worked Saturday and Sunday brunches at Sweet Basil. Sundays were Doc Cheatham. Doc was a legend. I also did Sunday nights-so I had 14-hour Sundays. I found that whatever you put out, how you react to the musicians, comes back to you. No musician was ever nasty to me; I had no reason to be nasty to them.  But if someone asked for another drink and clearly shouldn’t have one, I would react compassionately to that person. I was sincere about it.

The Jazz Family

Working at Sweet Basil, I met the families of the musicians: the wives, the other halves. And it was there that I saw the fuller personalities of the artists-not just the music they played-that I had not even considered before. These partners shared with me their concern for the health of the musicians and I, for a long time, didn’t realize that there were other health issues involved with drinking besides “drunk” or “had too much.”  When a musician would pass on and I had served him against his wife or partner’s wishes, I did feel very guilty.

The way I was trained as a bartender, you sell, sell, sell. So if a family member asked me not to serve someone more drinks, and that person didn’t seem drunk to me, often I would continue to serve him. I didn’t consider that the guy was already sick. The wife probably hadn’t made that known to me.

I would monitor someone’s drinking with the way he played. If he was sounding good up there, I figured he was alright to drink at the bar. I thought that was true until I saw with my own eyes that it wasn’t. One bass player came into the club already wasted-he’d just met his future father-in-law and had been drinking all afternoon. On stage, he didn’t miss a beat. He was right there. He looked like he was asleep at one point, but when it was time to come in, he came in. When I saw that, I re-evaluated my way of serving performers. Maybe I was wrong monitoring alcohol intake based on how well they’d played the music.  This guy got it well done but he was wasted. He’d mastered the technique. So I became more concerned about everyone.

Allyson was close to all the musicians, she was part of the jazz family, and as she and I became closer I was included in their birthday celebrations and other events in their lives. It was kind of neat-a real family feeling. She introduced me to their personal world for the first time, and through her I started listening more to individual soloists. Before that, I mostly heard the band sound-the whole group, which I also still like.

Not only did I broaden the number of musicians I knew that way, but I was opened up to a lot of different kinds of jazz at Sweet Basil, from Cecil Taylor and Don Pullen to Doc Cheatham and the wide variety of jazz in between.

Doc Cheatham and Sunday Brunches

When Doc was in his later years and still playing at Sweet Basil, he would come in and order an orange juice. I’d give him an orange juice. Then his wife would come in with a can of Ensure, a drink full of vitamins and a lot of nutritional value. She’d say, “Can you put this on ice for me, please?” I would do that. Then she’d say, “He’s to get this at 4 o’clock, precisely. Don’t forget.” Well, Doc would be on the bandstand and see this happening and roll his eyes. But at 4 o’clock I’d make sure he got his Ensure. Even if he was still playing, going a little overtime, I’d catch his eye and point to my watch.

Chuck Folds was the piano player with Doc and his wife would sit at the bar during the set. She was an artist and was always working on something. She’d just sit there and draw. All her pieces were of Doc, and I have a few of her drawings still. I don’t know if she’s a known artist or not. But I like having those drawings.

Doc used to invite different vocalists to come up and sing with the band. One time my niece did that, went up and sang with Doc’s band. And he remembered. Ever afterwards, he always asked me, “When is your niece coming back?” She was very talented-the youngest of the troupe that came here together.  She has since married and moved away, but she lived here in New York at the time.

Ornette Coleman came in to hear Doc and I later heard that he was married to Doc’s niece. One time when Ornette had come in, Doc said to me, “Ornette wants to do something together.” He looked me straight in the eye and asked my opinion. “How would that sound? How could we do that?” The fact that Doc was asking my opinion was amazing and humorous. Doc had a great sense of humour.

Bringing It All Together with the Spirit of Life Ensemble

Monday nights Miles Evans led his late father’s orchestra when I first started at Sweet Basil. Scott and I hung out at the club before that, when Gil Evans still led the band, to hear the music and visit Cho [writer’s note: see the article on Cho in this series], but it was Miles who I got to know and felt pretty close to through working at Sweet Basil.

Then the Spirit of Life Ensemble took over Monday nights, led by Daoud David Williams. They asked me to join the group and do the fire knife dance at the end of their program on some gigs. We did several gigs in New Jersey, I remember. The money was good and they made a video of the fire knife dance at every performance. I still have those tapes and am thinking of putting them together on a DVD.

How it happened that the Spirit of Life ensemble even knew about the fire knife dance is just one of those coincidences.  James Browne was managing Sweet Basil and had also been asked to produce the Greenwich Village Jazz Festival that year. We had talked about the freelance work I was doing with the Polynesian groups, and I guess he was intrigued. James asked me to do the fire knife dance outdoors-it was in the back of the Village Community School. Now, the fire knife dance is done with a machete that is adapted for the dance with asbestos at each end. Gasoline is poured on it and lit. The day I was booked to do the dance turned out to be very windy and I got burnt. Took the skin right off my hand.  So we went around the corner to the 55 bar and the waitress and bartender were so nice, they got me a big bucket of ice to put my hands in. So I had one hand in the bucket while the other hand lifted drinks between shows. Then I went back and did the second show. You get used to burns; seven years on the road doing the fire knife dance means I got used to burns.

The Spirit of Life ensemble was also booked for the festival and they saw me perform; that’s how they got the idea to include me in their program-just a short piece, only about three minutes a dance, 10 minutes all together.

The End of the Era

The last night Sweet Basil was open, I was the bartender. I worked that night. There was a photographer recording the final hours but I believe I completely eluded him. That’s just my character, to avoid the spotlight-I have nothing to hide. So it is not on record that it was me serving the last drinks there. It was very sad and I just know it could have gone on longer. I decided to give up bar work after that.

Sweet Basil was a blessing, a good choice for me. The musicians I met there and at Paulson’s and Lush Life have played a very big part in my life. I had not met Americans like that before. Jazz musicians should be the one percenters. The talent they have, they should be the rich people. Musicians work hard to prepare themselves, to share their talent.  I bet if jazz musicians all got rich they would figure out a better way of handling it than most rich people do.

 In this latest interview in my series, “In Service of Jazz,” Todd Barkan-Director of Programming and, literally,  the voice of jazz for Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola at Jazz at Lincoln Center, as well as record producer,  former club owner and musician-talks about his life in jazz. That life almost came to an abrupt and violent end February 13, 2011, when Todd was involved in a serious car accident driving home to the Bronx on the West Side Highway in New York in his trusty Mercury Sable from a night working with this music he loves. As he recalls from his hospital bed a week later, “An SUV travelling at least 100 miles an hour rear-ended me and propelled my car with such force that it smashed into a tree and landed back onto the highway facing the opposite direction.” Todd suffered multiple fractures to his lower leg and to his clavicle, and serious bruises from the force of the air bag. “You know,” he shared, “those air bags don’t just inflate around you gently. They explode on impact.” A kind taxi driver witnessed the accident, called the police, and stayed at the scene to tell what had happened-the SUV took off.  And, in an odd twist, Todd’s cell phone redialed the last call received before the airbag hit it. So pianist Monte Alexander was treated to a bizarre soundtrack of sirens in the wee hours of Sunday morning, he and his wife thinking it must be one of Todd’s latest musical ideas. “They had no idea,” Todd chuckled.

“I expect to make a full recovery,” Todd said. “But I’ve got to spend some weeks in rehab  before I’m totally up and at ’em.”

Get well soon, Todd!
 Todd Barkan:

I’ve been a “servant of jazz” for more than 40 years. Today I am Director of Programming at Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola at Jazz at Lincoln Center and I am an independent record producer too.  I owned the Keystone Korner in San Francisco for 11 years, which, I’m proud to say, became one of the legendary jazz clubs of the world. My actual career in jazz started when I was still in college at Oberlin and I helped to promote a number of concerts: I remember especially the Modern Jazz Quartet, a Miles Davis concert with Tony Williams and Herbie Hancock, and, ironically, a 1964 Dizzy Gillespie Quintet concert with Kenny Barron on piano-never imagining that one day I would be involved with a New York jazz club bearing Dizzy’s name and regularly featuring Kenny as a major headliner.

I’d developed the jazz “affliction” by my early teens-as both a jazz piano student and avid listener. Charles Mingus’s “Mingus Ah Um” came out when I was 13 years old.  I listened all the time, every day,  to that record, to Dave Brubeck’s “Time Out, ” and to Donald Byrd’s “Byrd in Flight,” with Hank Mobley, Jackie McLean, Duke Pearson, Doug Watkins and Lex Humphries. Somehow I got hold of those records. That’s the music that really formed my jazz consciousness. These LPs became my university, they brought me in, became my lodestar, my life.  And there was jazz on the radio late at night. Fritz Peerenboom, what a name!, had a show on WBNS 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. called “The Night Owl” that was a big influence on me too. He turned me on to Art Pepper, Carmen McRae, Thad Jones, Zoot Sims, Marty Paitch, Jimmy Smith, Joe Williams, Count Basie, so much great music. Think about it! If you look at all the great American art that came out just in 1959, at the height of the middle class experience in this country, the middle class didn’t survive but the music did. That music struck a chord in me and I knew that it was something I wanted to be involved in whatever way I could: writing, playing, presenting, whatever I could do. There was a passion and integrity about it that I could feel close to.

One of my major mentors back home in Columbus, Ohio, someone who really helped me get as deeply involved in the music as I did, was Roland Kirk, who later added Rahsaan to his name. He was a very dear friend to me and to this music.  He played with many bands in Columbus and throughout Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky and Illinois-one of my favorites was the group including the blind organist Eddie Bacchus up in Cleveland called the Three Blind Mice. Rahsaan [who was blind] and I would spend literally hundreds of hours going through stacks of jazz records in the stores at first in Ohio and eventually from there to California to Europe to Australia-all over; he would have me read the liner notes on the back and I learned a lot doing that; it was an important element of my education. Several other people, too, have been mentors and friends in my life and times, including Dexter Gordon and Grover Washington, Jr.  I took piano lessons from Don Patterson, another Columbus, Ohio, musician and one of my heroes, from whom I learned a lot about this music. Guitarist Warren Stevens and singer Nancy Wilson were also an important part of that scene. I learned from all these people what this music is about.

When I left home for college, I took a thousand jazz LPs with me. I think I freaked out my mother and father when I brought out the records to put in the car. Other kids brought their clothes and books. The hell with clothes and books! What I needed was my jazz records. I had beautiful carrying cases with lids for them that I’d bought with the money I’d made in the summer in construction work-I remember I made four dollars an hour, a good rate that provided enough left over for these cases. They fit albums perfectly.

As I said, I started producing jazz concerts almost as a kid, after being present at some truly memorable ones. I was reminiscing with George Wein last year when I booked his Newport All Stars at Dizzy’s, about   when I met him in 1962. He was co-producing the Ohio Valley Jazz Festival in the same spirit as the Kool Jazz Festivals. He was a major jazz impresario by then and bringing in Duke Ellington, Kenny Burrell, Count Basie et al. and I remember seeing him on stage. I was there in Cincinnati with my family, who knew the local co-promoter, and we actually caught a couple of nights’ of concerts.  Art Blakey, Kenny Burrell, Gloria Lynne, John Coltrane:  George promoted just a cornucopia of great music and he was a major inspiration to me. Here we were, in 2010, sitting there in New York City at Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola with, incidentally, the brother of one of the co-promoters of that festival, Gene Santangelo, talking about Ohio in 1962. The jazz family is like that. That’s the way the music is.

You know, I recently discovered in several conversations with George Wein that he and I share many parallel experiences in our jazz lives, the most remarkable of which is that we both started out as jazz pianists who in our mid-20s opened clubs at first to have a place to play. His was Storyville in Boston and mine, as I’ll tell you about in a minute, was Keystone Korner in San Francisco.

In 1967-the Summer of Love-I took off for San Francisco in a 1941 Cadillac. (It died just at the city limits.) I was a customs broker in the daytime and piano player for various bands at night. Two of my main groups were Kwane & The Kwan-ditos, a Latin jazz band, and a jazz vocal group called Fresh Air. Looking for work for Fresh Air, I went to a popular beer bar in North Beach to meet with the owner, Freddie Herrera. This was in 1972; I’d been in the Bay area four or five years by then. So I went to him and asked, “Why don’t you hire my band?” I gave him the press kit and demo, but he came back with, “I hate jazz. Can’t stand it. It doesn’t sell. But I’m opening a big rock club in Berkeley, the Keystone Berkeley. Why don’t you buy this joint and maybe you can turn it into something, do something with it? You can hire your own band yourself.”  “Well,” I said. “That sounds like a viable plan. But I only have eight thousand dollars.”  “Well,” he says back, “that could be enough to do something. Come back in a couple of days.”

So I did. I came back in a couple of days with a close friend who was a lawyer; the owner had a lawyer there and a guy from the bank with a bunch of papers. So they asked me for $5,000 down, sold me the club for $12,500 in 1972, and threw in two free nights of music-of Jerry Garcia and Merle Saunders, which meant I had two packed houses to help get me off the ground.

Then and there I decided to have a full-time jazz policy. The first main act I brought in was Bobby Hutcherson; then McCoy Tyner. I already knew them both, not only as a musician but from my time in college as a presenter.  So even though I was a young guy, I was not a totally alien person to the jazz world, I had been involved with this music for what seems like my whole life. But owning a club at 25 years of age, a club that became like the Village Vanguard of the West Coast, was a quantum leap forward. I knew nothing about running a business, nothing about running a bar, nothing about the day-to-day challenges of running a jazz club. I just had to learn by doing.

Artistically I’m proud of everything I did at the Keystone Korner. I did make my share of business mistakes, and I don’t regret any of them either, even though it took me a lot of time to pay off some of those mistakes-like giving a party where nobody comes. There were at least a couple of total bombs like that, where great music was played to the tables and chairs. I am also proud of the way the jazz community came together to keep the club afloat at critical junctures. We had opened in July 1972 as a beer only bar with 32 brands of barley and hops from all over the world. That following February, Freddie Hubbard joined forces with McCoy Tyner, Rahsaan Roland Kirk, Ron Carter and Elvin Jones at the 3500-seat Paramount Theatre in Oakland to play a benefit concert for the club to get its full liquor license. A couple of years later, January 1975, Grover Washington, Jr., and George Benson donated their services for a similar fundraising event at the Paramount to pay for a full kitchen for the Keystone, increasing our capacity and the range of clientele we could serve. I do still always say, “Take care of the music and the music will take care of you.” I really believe that and these are just a very few examples. I see no other reason that I have survived out here these last 40 years.

The Keystone Korner was a hippie bar and I was a hippie musician, and we had psychedelic posters on the walls, ionizers on every table so that the pot-or cigarette-smoke would go up in the air and not bother people two rows over from it (those were the days when people still smoked in clubs). We had people coming in in all states of consciousness; the audience was extra special and everyone I had working there was a musician or deeply involved in the music in some way [writer: I know Helen Simpson Wray and Janet Soleski who worked there and have great memories. The late Helen Wray met her life partner George Cables at the Keystone when he was playing there with Freddie Hubbard!].

That was just a fundamental experience. The club was open from July 7, 1972, to July 11, 1983. I was about 36-37 when it closed; I basically grew up in that club. That was where many of the wonderful relationships of my life were formed, and some of them are still a major part of my life: Bobby Hutcherson, Cedar Walton and Maxine Gordon are close friends as was Dexter-it was a very special place to many people.

The Keystone was really a labor of love to the very last day it was open.  And I tried to have the best music in the world there every night. I liked having a range of jazz styles:  for example, Art Blakey, Elvin Jones, then some avant garde. I had double bills, even triple bills. One double bill was Cecil Taylor and Archie Shepp-packed every night.  At the end of the year, I’d have my Keystone Holiday Jazz Festival: Triple bills. One was the Max Roach Quartet, the Bobby Hutcherson Quintet and the Dexter Gordon Quintet. The marquis just said, “Max, Dex, Hutch.” I’d have three bands for 10 days at the end of the year. We sold out every night.

I did tend to underprice my tickets.  I was looking at a ticket the other day that I found going through some of my memorabilia. Kathy Sloane, the photographer, is doing a book about the Korner and I’m thinking of doing one myself, so I’m trying to assemble some of the materials before they completely disappear into the ether; yes, I’ve been thinking about all the great music, the musicians, and the affectionate things people said about the club. It was a lot of musicians’ favorite place to play-in many ways it was part of the New York scene, an outlying post. People could leave New York and relax a little, feel a little more comfortable, on the West Coast, in a place that was part of the scene. New York was, of course, going through its own set of challenges in the 70s, so people did appreciate that opportunity. Dexter called it his “home away from home-this is where the music is played.” Mary Lou Williams called the Korner “the Birdland of the 1970s.” George Benson said it was his “favorite place to play.” McCoy Tyner told me, “You have some of the best jazz audiences in the whole world, just about every night, open and giving a lot of heart and soul to our music.” Stan Getz said it was “far and away the best jazz club in the world” and the inimitable Art Blakey just said, “My heart belongs to Keystone.”

Having come up as a piano player, I continued to practice and sometimes, for example on Monday nights, I would play there myself, or I would sit in with a friend-I sat in with Rahsaan Roland Kirk and with Grover Washington, Jr., on both piano and percussion.  But I feel-felt-kind of awkward about hiring myself. My life’s work is to hire musicians. I am proud of that. I feel great when I hand a musician a check.  Because that’s my gig. That’s part of what God put me on this earth to do-and I feel fulfilled when I do that: provide work! I knew early on in my life that as much as I liked playing the piano (and I still do, still get some great joy out of playing and writing music and lyrics), my creative muse was definitely presenting the music.

Producing jazz records, too, has been and continues to be a vital element of my work, maybe as much as presenting live music. They go hand in hand, arm and arm, hand and glove. The first record I produced was in the early 1970s, something by Tete Montoliu, a legendary, phenomenal bebop and hard bop piano player I met in Europe when I was working with Rahsaan Roland Kirk. I brought him over to play at the Keystone Korner in the early 1970s, with Billy Higgins and Herbie Lewis. He was a true delight to work with.  We recorded the band for a European label, Timeless Records, and just called it Live at the Keystone Korner.  That first venture was followed by several others: There were a couple of wonderful records with Bobby Hutcherson, one I’m particularly proud of was Highway One, with  George Cables, Hubert Laws, Freddie Hubbard, Eddie Marshall, James Leary and Manny Boyd.  Also we did the Timeless All Stars-Bobby Hutcherson, Cedar Walton, Buster Williams, Billy Higgins, Curtis Fuller, Harold Land, and Oscar Brashear. The recordings were interwoven with what I was doing down at the club.

In 1983, after the club closed I moved to New York. My dear friend Michael Cuscuna-one of the great people in this music-and I were roommates at his home at 350 East 78th Street in Manhattan. He is definitely one of the smartest, most capable people in all of jazz, and a wonderful human being.  I worked for the Boys Choir of Harlem as a manager for about five years; I produced a recording for them early on in that association with my friend Kenny Burrell, who was a Keystone regular, and Billy Taylor and Grady Tate were on it too. I took the Boys Choir of Harlem out on the road for the first time and worked with their Director, Dr. Walter J. Turnbull. I believe I contributed to making them a world-class touring company.  It was one of the most satisfying and wonderful experiences in my life.

I stayed active in a lot of areas related to this music after that, even worked at a booking agency, and as an artist rep. I became more involved in record production, booked tours on the west coast, whatever I could do to be in jazz. I worked with a guy named Jack Whittemore-one of the unsung day-to-day heroes of our jazz world-probably the greatest artist manager and booking agent that I have known. When I was still in San Francisco I would stay on the couch in his office sometimes when I came to New York; it was a second floor office on Park Avenue.  He looked just like Jimmy Cagney, a little Irish guy, a drinker, solid guy, talked a little like Cagney too. He managed Miles Davis, Ahmad Jamal, Rahsaan, Sonny Stitt, Stan Getz, Betty Carter and a plethora of other artists-booked and managed them, all without one signed contract. He was that respected and trusted, one of the great men of this music for decades. It is not right that he is barely mentioned in any jazz history book. He died the same year the Korner closed, 1983, and there is a relationship between those two events.

One great Jack Whittemore story that I love to tell, took place during a time that I was in from San Francisco, staying on his couch. Art Blakey had borrowed Jack’s car to drive his band up to Boston to open at Fred Taylor’s-Fred is another jazz lifer-Jazz Workshop. Actually, maybe it was Lee Wiley’s car, Jack’s wife or girlfriend-the jazz singer. Anyway, around 8 p.m. the phone rang. It was Fred. Art hadn’t gotten there yet. Then the phone rang again and it was Art. “Who’s this?” he asked in that gruff voice of his. “This is Todd.” Well, that seemed to be good enough. “Tell Jack that the Messengers are okay,” he informed me. “We just ran into a herd of wild turkeys.” “What?” I asked, dubiously. “A herd?” He insisted, “There were feathers everywhere. There was blood on the windshield.” It turned out that someone had fallen asleep at the wheel and driven into a ditch. Art was being a creative interpreter of the facts of the time, the events of the moment. Of course, they did get there, about half an hour late, but that is just a classic story of the times.

I have been on the road quite a bit and gotten to see how terrible the conditions are sometimes for the people who are asked to create this music. Yet they do create. I was on the road with Rahsaan Roland Kirk, with Bobby Hutcherson, and with some other folks, and have seen, for example, what we used to call PSOs-piano-shaped objects-make real music under the right hands.  Just think what Art Tatum did with mediocre, sometimes terrible instruments, it is nothing less than astounding. Jaki Byard and Errol Garner too: So many giants of this music were able to just transcend the most awful instruments and make great music from them. You hear what those instruments naturally sound like and then hear what they were able to do, create art, I think they were able to suspend disbelief in that instrument’s capabilities. The challenges that an artist has to transcend run the gamut from the difficulties of travel to the technical difficulties of different stages, to the difficulties with these substandard instruments. I am very proud to work with JALC to provide world-class conditions for musicians at Dizzy’s these days: a good sound system, a great piano. Having seen the other side of these conditions firsthand is very helpful in trying to take care of musicians in the best way possible, which is important to all of us who try to present this music today.

I got to Dizzy’s in a natural, organic way, as a result of my history in jazz and the relationships I had formed along the way. A few years before Dizzy’s opened, maybe 1998 , I ran into Wynton Marsalis on Eighth Avenue. Now I had first met and worked with Wynton at the Keystone Korner when he was music director with Art Blakey’s Jazz Messengers 20 years earlier. He was with the Messengers at the Korner a couple of times. Wynton was a young jazz phenom on his way up. He met Dr. George Butler, president of Columbia Jazz, in my office-so we had a relationship, a history. Over the ensuing years we stayed in touch, got to know each other a little more; I had a tremendous respect for what he was doing on many levels.

“We’re thinking of, actually working on, getting a new facility open for Jazz at Lincoln Center, and I’m planning on having a jazz club in that facility,” Wynton told me. “You would be a good guy to help us with this effort.” I said thank you very much, filed that away in my mind, and went on about my business, producing records and working with a few artists. One of those artists, by the way, was  the legendary composer and arranger Chico O’Farrill, whom I helped get  back into the jazz mainstream.   I produced his comeback recordings  for Fantasy Records and his first European tour, and I brought Chico to Jazz at Lincoln Center in 1997.

In December of the year 2000 the executive director of Jazz at Lincoln Center left and Wynton called me. “We need someone here who knows something about the music; can you come work at JALC?” Well, I was out in San Francisco working on a Jimmy Scott recording for Fantasy.  And I was the president of 32 Records. But I came back and we talked in person.  Wynton is such an effective visionary, motivator, facilitator-he convinced me to come to work there for half the salary I was making at the time.

I started right away, in January 2001, at JALC.  We were strongly involved with opening the new facility by 2004. JALC had just moved into the new building at Sixtieth Street where we are now.  So the next few years were taken up with fundraising, planning, and organizing-an unbelievable undertaking with many challenges and heroes. Roland Chassagne, who works with me at Dizzy’s, was on the building team. He’s been there a little longer than I have. We all worked together from 2001; I worked with Wynton booking the concerts at Alice Tully Hall, the Kaplan Penthouse, and Avery Fisher Hall in the first couple of seasons, and when the club came concretely into view, that it would actually open in 2004, I was given the responsibility of booking that room. It is certainly a full-time job and the fulfillment of what Wynton had said seven years before on the street: He is a visionary, an amazing human being. He instilled me with so much enthusiasm.  I certainly have no regrets-a little over six years and thousands of gigs later.

I am still involved in record production too. You have to be able to do a lot of different things to stay in the jazz business over the long haul. I have worked with record companies all over the world-Italian, English, American, Dutch, and, of course Japanese.

I do feel that booking jazz artists in clubs and producing jazz records go hand in hand. I can do something in the studio and work on music that will be presented in the club. Likewise, sometimes I can suggest things for the club that can be recorded, then brought back into the club that much stronger-these are interweaving processes that move the work along.

The sorest need, the most urgent need, is for more and better places to play this music, because live music is such an essential element in growing up in music. We need more and better jazz clubs. If you add up the capacity of all the jazz venues in New York, you might not have more than 2500 seats-all of them together don’t equal one Madison Square Garden. An important part of what we do at JALC and what all people trying to do something substantial for jazz music do-is to let the music be heard by as many people as possible as often as possible.  I think there is more audience for jazz than there ever has been, I’m seeing people get fantastically excited about straight ahead, swinging music when they have the opportunity to hear it. Those of us who are presenting the music have to present it with the most passion and consistency as humanly possible. That’s my mission-to let the music be heard.

74,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/jazz-alone/four-letter-words-rap-fusion/,"We should not care if some rapper claims to be influenced by jazz.  We should laugh at those who make artistic claims for fusion.

Rap is finally being recognized as the minstrel update that it is.  Threatening Sambo. Cursing Sambo. Whorish tramps who get cases of the wiggles any time money is mentioned.  Its popularity among white suburban kids has nothing to do with “hip-hop culture”; it has to do with what I have called “audio safaris.”  One can get to the urban jungle and be among the savages merely by going to Tower Records.  One can always be sure, deep down, that one is far superior to those jungle bunnies hip-hopping along. For at least a hundred years, there have always been whites willing to pay Negroes top dollar if they dedicated their careers to proving the inferiority of black to white.

What rap most importantly proves is that Negro American youth culture-just like every other youth culture suffering from the pop entertainment pressure to shock, to outrage, to scandalize-is as vulnerable to decadence and hollow materialism as anything else.

The hollowness of fusion is another story.  The musical things that jazz-fusioners tried to conquer, or even to incorporate, were too insubstantial and never provided even the faintest aesthetic outlines for deep creation.  What jazz musicians had always done was bring other materials into the world of swing, no matter the source.  As Billy Hart said of the late Billy Higgins, what made him a great master was his ability to play rhythms from other cultures with so much swinging charisma that the drummers in those other cultures started playing their own rhythms the way he did.

What could jazz musicians do with the music of the rock world?  Were they going to take rock melodies and remake them or build upon them as so many jazz musicians had with Tin Pan Alley songs?  Hardly.  Were jazz musicians going to learn new rhythms or new harmonies or new melodic styles?  Be serious.

Beyond Miles Davis’ Filles de Kilimanjaro and a few other recordings here and there, the elements of rock always brought jazz musicians down to where rock was, but in an inferior version: the jazz was diluted, yes, but so was the rock, which became shallower due to the crossover’s ineffectiveness.  Yet there was seemingly no other choice if those who chose to play fusion were to become successful.

Success also meant imitating the immature emotions of rock, not projecting the adult feeling that had been given to jazz through the blues.  Jazz musicians had to emotionally dumb down the passion of an art that had always gone beyond adolescent thoughts and desires, no matter the color or the class of its players.  Even the least vital and most stiltedly urbane version of the music was focused on something other than the sweat, discomfort, insecurity and resentment of adolescence.  Jazz spoke of the world in which grown men and women lived, struggled, loved, lost, dreamed and remembered.

That very quality, that maturity, had always separated jazz from the boyish and girlish inclinations of American popular culture.  One went to jazz wishing to learn how to become an adult, not seeking justification for one’s teenage limitations.  One’s models were men and women, and one was awed by the way those people made adult life seem like much, much more than a loss of connection to the fires of living.

The feeling of much rock, then and now, at its most aggressive is the feeling of a pyromaniac, while so much jazz feels like the work of very, very soulful fire-eaters.  Living could be hot as fire on a stick, the music says, but you can learn how to handle it, how to feel the heat but avoid being burned.  Or, if you were burned, you might learn something about the nature of the human soul and what it takes to rise up from the burn unit of the blues.  You might sing a true song of collective importance, a universal sense of the great sadness that awaits us all and arrives when it will.

The stiff rhythms of rock, the yowling guitars, the impersonal keyboards, the unswingng bass guitars and the adolescent tendencies to self-pity were not, and still are not, compatible with jazz.

But who knows?  I have in my possession a letter from J.J. Johnson in which he recounts going to see “the electric” Miles Davis for some career advice.  Davis told him to get two or three white boys with long hair and electric guitars and have them play loud as a mother.  Then he could do whatever he wanted to do and make a pile of money.  Davis had learned.  Had he lived, he might have become a rapper:

75,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/jazz-alone/piano-prodigy/,"What is actually going on out in the jazz world is very different from what one usually reads about in jazz magazines or what one would conclude from taking critics’polls seriously. There are musicians out here who not only can play but who have continued to develop their skills outside of the praises of the critical establishment, whose words of admiration are usually reserved for those musicians who claim to be moving the music “forward” but who are never heard of outside of their small circles (primarily because they don’t impress other musicians who can actually play).

One ignored example of a consummate jazz musician is Eric Reed, who-with the exceptions of Bill Charlap and Brad Mehldau at their very best-can easily outplay all other piano players under 40. Neither Mehldau nor Charlap can walk past him either; it’s just that all three, for now, are in a circle reserved for the most formidable.

One needn’t be hostile toward any of the younger so-called avant-garde pianists to notice why Reed is superior to all of them. After all, these supposed avant gardists are never caught swinging, but they will annex hip-hop rhythms, use electronic gimmicks and be celebrated for “keeping jazz alive.” Reed has far greater command of the keyboard, the pedals and the touches and the nuances that make one a first-class jazz pianist.

Listen to how soulful and free of clichés he can be on some blues (hear his “Blues Five Spot”on Manhattan Melodies), or how well he can hear his way through very complex harmonies, or the size of the sound he can get out of his fingers-not by banging the instrument with his arms. In the “Jazz Composer Portraits” series that he has produced for Columbia University, Reed has proven himself not only quite an individual but also a charming bandleader and arranger.

At Columbia,I heard Reed give two concerts. One featured the music of Billy Strayhorn; the other the music of Eric Dolphy. Each was well rehearsed, and the musicians did not come on the bandstand looking as though they were rehearsing in somebody’s garage or basement (which is surely the influence of rock, that screw-you conception of looking like an unmade bed.)

At the Strayhorn concert, after his arrangements sufficiently featured fine players such as Frank Wess and Lew Soloff on other numbers,Reed took a very long solo on “Blues in Orbit.” He was absolutely splendid. The improvisation was built on a few motives that were tried in every register, using the whole keyboard, building from trills to a couple of notes to entire phrases to complete choruses phased in one sweep that told the whole story and were rung out in marvelously controlled varieties of timbre resulting from the combination of touch and the use of the pedals.

When playing the Dolphy music,which is extremely hard, Reed managed to still swing, swing, swing. He outplayed everyone, too, which was no simple task since he used Marcus Printup,Greg Osby,James Carter and the marvelous Steve Nelson, the lone vibraphonist between Bobby Hutcherson and Stefon Harris.

Gifted with perfect pitch and soaked in the soul source of Negro church music (his late father was a minister), Reed came to the public’s attention on Wynton Marsalis’ In This House, on This Morning. In that band’s broad context, Reed came to master the sweep of jazz piano, from New Orleans to the present. For an example of Reed’s imagination, listen to his feature on “Brake’s Sake” on Standard Time,Vol. 4: Marsalis Plays Monk.

Or check him out on Marsalis’ Live at the Village Vanguard. Reed’s humorously “out”invention on “Uptown Ruler”contains a startling 24-bar run of sustained and thematic rhythmic complexity that addresses the time, starting at 6:39 into the piece and not ending until 7:04. Then there’s “Pedro’s Getaway,”where-like Wynton Kelly on “Blue ‘n’Boogie” from Wes Montgomery’s Full House-Reed starts smoking on the first beat!

Reed has also learned,from Monk and Ellington, how to creatively accompany in the rhythm section, as if he is playing an arrangement, which means, among other things, laying out chords with a melodic direction, inventing riffs, contrasting piano registers with those of the featured player and moving around in the time so that harmony arrives with the ultimate amount of drama as well as subtlety.

I once saw grand master Tommy Flanagan at a Javon Jackson gig at the now defunct Sweet Basil, and Reed was the pianist. Flanagan stayed all night and raved ecstatically about the younger pianist. Peter Washington, who worked with Flanagan for 15 years and was playing bass that night with Jackson, commented on how well Reed could handle the time and the exciting clarity of his ideas and execution.

If you get a chance to hear Eric Reed, don’t miss your moment. Some changes will be made, some serious rhythmic invention will take place, some deep soul will be displayed and some real jazz will be heard.

76,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/jazz-alone/the-place-of-the-bass/,"In 1947,George Pal made a classic puppetoon called “Tubby the Tuba,”which was the story of a tuba that wanted to go beyond oom-pahing all night and get the front-line attention given to those horns that played the melody. Dismissed as foolish by a class conscious French horn,Tubby became despondent until a bullfrog gave him the confidence to believe in his register; the tale ended with him getting the lead after showing the conductor he could croon his stuff. It was another American fable about democratic values.

In the world of jazz, the Tubby issue has two sides: one good, one bad.

If Tubby was in New York and left after his orchestra gig to go hear Buster Williams at the Village Vanguard some months back when he opened a set with an unaccompanied feature on “Summertime,” the puppetoon hero would have wanted to trade in his brass for lacquered wood, a bridge and four heroic strings. Williams marvelously summed up everything that has happened on his instrument since Charles Mingus,beginning in the middle ’50s,almost single-handedly waged a war in which the bass eventually absorbed everything from blues guitar to Jimmy Blanton to Andrés Segovia to Charlie Parker to Art Tatum to double- and triplestops, as well as flamenco strumming and slurs and just about anything else that worked,whether on simple or complex harmony or some combination of both.

After his virtuoso feature,Williams,true master that he is,went on to swing a hole in the wall for the rest of the night,walking with that sublime fluidity in which the time is kept and the harmony is interpreted for a bass line that carries a melodic direction full of contrapuntal interplay delivered in quarter notes. Even Bach,who was the greatest musician in the history of Western music, would have been profoundly startled had he heard what jazz bass players have done with the bottom,not to mention how overwhelmed he would have been by what the rhythm section-itself a unique phenomenon in Western music-has achieved.

Like everything else in jazz, the development of the bass took place at a very high speed. The central reason that things moved so quickly that was any jazz musician, trained in theory or not,who could read or not, but was capable of meeting the groove and performing with musical logic was welcome. So contributions came from across the spectrum. A sophisticated genius like Coleman Hawkins could be on the bandstand with a genius like Billie Holiday, who had a small sound and a small range but, following Louis Armstrong, was as much a revolutionary as Hawkins himself. Consequently,the music’s development was truly democratic. The intellect was not more important than the ear. Someone who was sophisticated but couldn’t meet the groove was booted out, just as someone who was untrained but couldn’t make it through the forms had to go as well.

In a whirlwind of plucking, the bass replaced its predecessor, the tuba, by the middle ’30s, when Walter “Big Four”Page discovered the two-bar eight-beat cycle of rhythm (1 2-3-4-5-6-7-8, not 1-2-3-4, 2-2-3-4). That two-bar phrasing cycle centered “Kansas City 4/4″in the Count Basie rhythm section and remains the feeling,for all of its many reinterpretations,that those who truly swing use to this very day. That walking is something formidable. Nothing in European music ever made the kinds of physical demands on bass players that jazz does and there is no European music in which the bass player keeps the time,functions within the context of a song,interprets the harmony chorus to chorus and does all of this in relation to his fellow players and to the form of the piece.

In modern times,however,the bass can suffer from the worst version of the Tubby the Tuba complex,which results in overlong and boring bass solos on every tune and too much amplification. Bassists can rightly argue that everyone else plays too long as well and that they turn up so high because drummers can’t control their instruments and play far too loud (which is why we had a period about 25 years ago when bass players gleefully let everybody else know how it felt to be drowned out-or oppressed by volume).

Then there is the question of the Scott LaFaro influence, which is fine for features but conceives of rhythm-section counterpoint in the obvious way it would function had jazz been invented in Europe. That is not as profound, for this music, as what we hear from Paul Chambers on Miles Davis’ In Person: Friday and Saturday Night at the Blackhawk or Ray Brown with Oscar Peterson on West Side Story or Mingus at Antibes to cite just a few examples recorded in the same time period that LaFaro began getting attention.

The LaFaro approach also avoids swing, of which Buster Williams says, “That’s the hardest thing of all to do. It all adds up to that. Swinging. If you can make it happen with that, then you’re really playing something.”

So if Tubby the Tuba showed up right about now and had a revelation listening to Buster Williams at the Village Vanguard,he might understand that he could beef up the beat while walking with a melodic direction in recognition of the fact that it wouldn’t mean a thing if it didn’t have that swing.

77,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/jazzalamode/art-farmer-every-note-means-something/,"Art Farmer Art Farmer holds a special place in my heart. The trumpeter was the first musician I ever interviewed on the radio, and he proved to be as gracious and responsive as one could wish. Farmer had just finished an engagement in Boston and was visiting friends in Worcester when his host, a stranger to me, phoned in the middle of my morning jazz show on WCUW and asked, “How about if I bring Art Farmer by the studio?” Before I’d got a nervous reply like “When?” out of my mouth, they were on their way. Farmer arrived minutes later in sport coat and tie with a Burberry trench coat draped over his arm and proceeded to answer my questions about the famous associates of his that I could quickly call to mind: Clifford Brown, Sonny Rollins, Horace Silver, Jim Hall and Benny Golson among them. He seemed particularly impressed that I knew McCoy Tyner had played with Farmer and Golson’s Jazztet before he joined John Coltrane, and said, “Thanks for knowing something about my music.” A month later, when I took him up on his offer to be his guest at the Blue Note, he invited me to his table and introduced me to the Rev. John Gensel, the pastor of St. Peter’s Lutheran Church and the first official minister to New York’s jazz community.

Farmer came to prominence in the ’50s. He worked with Lionel Hampton in 1953, making his first date as a leader for Prestige with members of Hamp’s orchestra, and then played with Lester Young at Birdland. He told Whitney Balliett for a New Yorker profile that Lester called him “Pres,” and taught him “That every note meant something. When I followed him, I felt like a fool if I didn’t make sense. He made me tighten up and tell a ‘story’ in each solo.” He then spent two years with Horace Silver’s first quintet followed by two more with the Gerry Mulligan Quartet. Farmer said that going from a player as propulsive as Silver to Mulligan’s piano-less group “was a shock…like walking down the street naked.”

Farmer co-founded the Jazztet with Golson in 1959. The group is often lumped together with more loose-limbed ensembles of the day, but as a vehicle for Golson’s harmonically nuanced writing and Farmer’s concise solo style, it was a more tempered band than the Jazz Messengers and groups led by Miles Davis, Charles Mingus and Max Roach. Perhaps owing to its contracts with Argo and Mercury Records, both of which were airplay-savvy, the Jazztet defied hard bop convention by keeping to within a three-to-five-minute time frame on most of its records and hewing to precisely orchestrated ensembles. The group enjoyed moderate success with tunes like “Killer Joe,” “Along Came Betty” and “I Remember Clifford,” but never really took off commercially, and by 1962 Farmer and Golson called it quits.

Farmer, who was born in Council Bluffs, Iowa in 1928, died in 1999. When Mosaic Records reissued the Jazztet’s recordings in 2004, Golson told annotator Bob Blumenthal, “Art Farmer played a ballad more beautifully than any trumpet player I ever heard. That’s any trumpet player.” Following his years with Golson, Farmer put together a critically-acclaimed quartet that featured Jim Hall. Of the guitarist, Farmer told Balliett, “Jim is amazing. I could go in and out of the chords, up and down the chords, and he instantly knew what to do. Whatever I played, he was there.” The same was true of pianist Steve Kuhn, who succeeded Hall in 1965. Kuhn described Farmer to me as “quiet, unassuming, a great talent, and a sweetheart of a man”

But even a trumpeter as together as Farmer had trouble making ends meet in the mid ’60s, so following a visit to Vienna in 1965, he accepted an offer to join the Austrian Radio Jazz Orchestra. “Considering the way things were here and that my whole life had been lived for the possibility of playing jazz music, I decided to give it a try for a year.” It worked so well that Farmer moved to Vienna permanently in 1968, and returned to the States for occasional appearances. In 1982, he and Golson reformed the Jazztet on a part-time basis.

This week’s golden anniversary feature in Jazz a la Mode is Farmer’s 1961 recording Perception. The trumpeter was renowned for his lyrical eloquence by the early ’60s, but in employing the flugelhorn exclusively on this session, he gave further indication of the increasingly introspective direction his music would take with Hall and Kuhn, and later on with European collaborators.

Here’s footage of Farmer relating what a natural fit the flugelhorn proved to be, followed by his performance of Duke Pearson’s, “You Know I Care.” ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912203438.69/warc/CC-MAIN-20190324103739-20190324125739-00313.warc.gz
78,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/jazzalamode/johnny-otis-black-by-persuasion/,"When segregationists urged whites to avoid listening to black music for fear of its irresistible appeal, they might have proffered Johnny Otis as Exhibit A of what they had in mind.  Early in his life, Otis, the son of Greek immigrants who ran a grocery store in a predominantly black neighborhood of Berkeley, CA, followed his black playmates into a church basement for a snack of milk and cookies and came out “captured” by the sounds and style of the music and preaching he’d heard.  He went back for more, of course, and as he described in his memoir, Upside Your Head: Rhythm and Blues on Central Avenue, he was so moved by these youthful experiences that he became “black by persuasion.”

Johnny Otis died on Tuesday at the age of 90.  In a nation of self-styled originals, he was one of the truly unique.   Otis spent his life immersed in the culture and society of African-Americans, and he related his life’s story as if he were black too.  As he explained to Terry Gross on Fresh Air  in 1989:  “I could not veer away [from the black community] because that’s where I wanted to be,” Otis said. “Those were my friends. That’s what I loved. It wasn’t the music that brought me to the black community. It was the way of life. I felt I was black.”  He was also highly attuned to the pervasiveness of racism among whites, a matter he found insufferable and that he later decried in his books, radio shows, and political activism.

But it was music that gave expression to Otis’s heart and soul, and the music was Jump Blues, the lively hybrid of big band swing, gospel and boogie woogie that developed in the late ’30’s and early ’40’s, and that Jerry Wexler later dubbed Rhythm & Blues. Otis, who played piano and vibes as well as drums, began his career as a drummer with Count Otis Matthews and the West Oakland House Rockers, then worked with Midwestern territory bands, including Harlan Leonard and His Rockets.  He spent one grand night spelling Jo Jones with Count Basie, and by the mid-’40’s, he’d become a fixture on the Los Angeles scene, leading the house band at the Club Alabam and recording with Lester Young and Illinois Jacquet.  In 1990, he paid tribute to this era with a set of classic swing tunes entitled  Spirit of the Black Territory Bands ; the cover was illustrated with one of his paintings.

Otis formed his own orchestra in 1945 and scored a surprise hit with “Harlem Nocturne” on his first session, a date featuring Basie’s great singer Jimmy Rushing.   The decline in popularity and high cost of big bands forced him to break down to a smaller combo later in the decade, and his core group coalesced around pianist Devonia Williams; Pete “Guitar” Lewis, a brilliant T-Bone Walker-inspired stylist; and the saxophonists Big Jay McNeely and James Von Streeter, both prototypical “walking the bar” tenors.

But critical to the success of Otis’s Rhythm & Blues Caravan were the vocalists he discovered in the talent contests he sponsored at The Barrelhouse, the Central Avenue nightclub he co-owned with Bardu Ali in Watts.  He described his pursuit of female singers as “a holy grail quest.”  And beginning with Ernestine Anderson in 1945, these included the 15-year-old Little Esther, as well as Big Mama Thornton, Sugar Pie DiSanto, Linda Hopkins, Margie Evans, and Etta James (who died on January 20 at age 73).  Etta’s first hit, “Roll With Me Henry,” was composed and produced by Otis in 1955; three years earlier, he produced and played drums on Thornton’s “Hound Dog.”  Otis hosted talent contests wherever he stopped, and one night in Detroit he discovered Jackie Wilson, Hank Ballard, and Little Willie John.  As he told Terri Gross, it came as no surprise to him that Berry Gordy found such a huge talent pool “right there in Detroit” when he opened Motown Records.  Otis’s ear for talent and success on the charts earned him the title, “Godfather of Rhythm & Blues.”

The classic Rhythm & Blues that Otis specialized in featured both light-hearted jump tunes and plaintive slow blues; the latter, which often echoed the gospel backgrounds of its singers, was especially popular with blacks, but as whites began to swell the market for R&B and figures like Bill Haley and Elvis Presley emerged as cover artists, demand grew for up-tempo, teen-oriented material.  Otis kept pace with his rock’n’roll hit “Willie and the Hand Jive,” but by the early ’60’s, the combination of Motown (“The Sound of Young America”) and the Beatles-led British invasion effectively drove classic R&B underground.  Ironically, the blues revival that folklorists and record collectors fostered in the mid-60’s gave short shrift to R&B, dismissing it as commercialized dance music while glorifying notions of authentic blues purity in the lineage that began in the Mississippi Delta and migrated north to Chicago.

Otis saw the emergence of guitar heavy blues-rock, which drew largely on the Delta/Chicago tradition, as another example of a watering-down process that had begun with white Swing bands in the ’30’s.  In Upside Your Head he wrote: “Without the rich African-American culture, the genuine, nurtured-in-the-South, pure Black blues feeling, jazz is empty…The white boys think they have it..but it was, and continues to be, all copy-cat bullshit.”  Still, he praised “a few white players who have the feeling [to] interpret Black music beautifully: Scott Hamilton, Steve Cropper, Zoot Sims, Jack Teagarden, Benny Goodman…but you put a bandstand full of whites together, and you come up with a Doc Severinson or a Stan Kenton band, all stiff and ungainly.”  Otis also noted the decline in quality of black R&B vocalists, the cause of which he attributed to TV: “In front of the television camera, youth, beauty, and skillful dancing took precedence over artistry….and more and more singers tended to be mediocre.”

Otis made very few records in the ’60’s, but he enjoyed at least one more moment of glory when he presented his Rhythm & Blues Extravaganza at the Monterey Jazz Festival in 1970.  The concert was released on Epic Records and offered stirring testimony of the timeless vitality of the music and a dozen of its greatest exponents, among them Roy Brown, Esther Phillips, Eddie Cleanhead Vinson, and Big Joe Turner.   But by this time, Otis’s interests had broadened.  He’d spent the better part of a decade in efforts to end segregation and redlining practices in Los Angeles housing.  He had also got involved in California state politics, a direction he pursued after the 1965 Watts riots, which he wrote a personalized view of in his first book Listen to the Lambs.  In the ’70’s he became an ordained minister and led the Landmark Community Church, a congregation dedicated to serving the needy and homeless.  Otis acknowledged knowing little “about Heaven.  [But] I know about love and brotherhood, and that’s enough.”  Later he became an enterprising organic farmer, marketing his own brand of apple juice which he sold in a farm store that doubled, to no one’s surprise, as a nightclub.

Here’s a 1958 performance of “Willie and the Hand Jive” from Otis’s Los Angeles television show.



And here’s the entire program, complete with commercials and a couple of features for special guest Lionel Hampton.


Here’s Otis with guitarist Roy Buchanan, who says that he modeled his blues playing on Johnny’s subtle inflections as a singer.

79,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/jazzalamode/lou-colombo-the-capes-leading-light/,"One of the watershed experiences in my early appreciation of jazz was seeing Dave McKenna, Dick Johnson, and Lou Colombo at The Columns in West Dennis on Cape Cod in 1971.  McKenna’s astonishing piano playing was the great discovery of that day, but Johnson’s saxophone and clarinet playing and Colombo’s trumpet work were impressive too.  At that age, I probably recognized the Swing and Bebop tunes they played, but the Great American Songbook was much less familiar to me, and I have these gentlemen to thank for fostering my love of songs by Arlen and Porter and Gershwin.

As I soon learned, McKenna, Johnson and Colombo came of age during the Bebop era, and it was obvious that Bird and Bud and Dizzy were in their hearts, and occasionally in their set lists and recordings too.  But for working musicians, playing modern jazz would hardly sustain a livelihood, so they specialized in standards and Swing, music for dancing and conversation.  Theirs was a social music, and they played it with a sense of style and conviction that I fear is passing right along with them.

From the start, I also found it possible to discern something of the respective personalities of these then middle-aged men: McKenna appeared to be shy and diffident (true to which, he often begged off the critical acclaim he received as one of the world’s greatest jazz pianists, calling himself a “saloon piano player”); Johnson was suave and handsome, exuding an air of iconic cool; and Colombo was garrulous and ebullient, typified by his eye-catching, one-armed trumpet technique which freed his left hand to motion to special guests and friends in the house-and everyone was special in Lou’s world!  Indeed, had Colombo not been such a fine musician (and prior to that, a .302 career hitter for Dodgers and Cardinals farm teams), he may have made a great restaurateur.  As it happens, Lou left that occupation to his son and daughter who operated restaurants in Hyannis and Florida.  On Saturday night, after performing at the family establishment in Fort Myers, Lou was killed in an automobile accident.  With his death, and those of McKenna and Johnson over the past four years, this generation of regional jazz greats has left us.

Lou Colombo may have been the least known of this threesome on a national level, but for thousands of tourists, not to mention jazz-loving locals, he was, as Bob Wilber said today, “the leading light of jazz on the Cape.”  Lou played bars, restaurants, schools, weddings, nursing homes, public parks, and jazz fests from Falmouth to P-Town.  For a couple of decades between the ’60’s and ’80’s, he played on Saturday nights at Wychmere Harbor Club in Harwichport where my family often gathered for dinner and dancing, and where he played for my sister Sue’s wedding in 1984.  Over the past 20 years, he worked every Monday and Tuesday night in season before packed houses at the Roadhouse Cafe in Hyannis.

Colombo was born in the City of Champions, Brockton, Massachusetts in 1927, hometown of both Dick Johnson and the great prizefighters Rocky Marciano and Marvin Hagler.  He began playing trumpet at age 12.  For the liner notes to his 1990 recording I Remember Bobby, he told Ron Della Chiesa, “I used to get together with some of the local East Side kids.  We’d listen to Roy Eldridge’s great recording of ‘Rockin’ Chair,’ and that’s what really got me going, when I heard Roy play, and Harry James too.  Louis Armstrong came later, when I was about 14 or 15, and I said, ‘Oh yeah, this guy is great!’ So that’s when I got into Louis, after Roy.”

Lou spent a couple of years in the service in the mid-’40’s, then played for Dodgers and Cardinals farm teams between 1945 and ’53 when a severe ankle injury dashed his hopes of a career in the majors.  Baseball’s loss was music’s gain.  Lou spent a few years touring with the bands of Buddy Morrow, Perez Prado, and Benny Goodman before settling down to raise a family and make his livelihood on the Cape and Southern New England.  While he worked for the most part on a regional level, he earned the respect and recognition of the greats, from Louis Armstrong and Bobby Hackett to Dizzy Gillespie and Tony Bennett, who made it a point to hear Lou whenever he played the Melody Tent in Hyannis.

Gillespie told Eric Jackson of WGBH in 1988: “Lou Colombo is what I would call a trumpet painter, he resolves. He starts playing and the notes keep going, but the chord keeps changing all the time. He’s a marvelous trumpet player. I went one night to hear him play. Boy, he asked me to play with him and I said ‘No- you got it Brother. I’m not going to jump into that hot water’. Lou’s pretty weird the way he plays because he plays with just one hand. He plays the valves with his right hand but doesn’t hold the horn with his left hand. This guy’s amazing. I’ve been preaching his name ever since that night I first heard him down on Cape Cod.”

In 1983, Colombo joined Johnson in the newly revived Artie Shaw Orchestra that Shaw asked Johnson to lead, and in 2006 he was featured on the title track of Johnson’s tribute to Shaw, Star Dust & Beyond.   Shaw himself occasionally appeared with the band, and here he introduces a performance of “Stardust,” which he refers to only as “the second national anthem.”  Soloists include Colombo, Johnson and trombonist Doug Elliott. In addition to Lou’s tribute to his friend and Cape Cod neighbor Bobby Hackett,  I Remember Bobby, he appeared on at least three releases with the trombonist George Masso.

I heard from several of Lou’s friends and colleagues today, including Tony Bennett, who said, “Lou Colombo was a magnificent musician and was known as Dizzy Gillespie’s favorite trumpet player.  Lou was a wonderful human being and his sudden passing is a tragedy and a great loss to his family and all who have known him and worked with him over the years.”

The bassist Marshall Wood, who plays with Bennett, offered this appreciation of the trumpeter: “I met Lou Colombo in July of 1982. I had the opportunity to play with him and record with him many, many times. First and foremost what stood out about Lou was his immense God-given natural talents, both in music and in sports. Without an inkling of what the changes were to a song, he could masterfully create a solo that was not only supremely melodic and completely made up of jazz language and phrases, but also brilliantly outlined the harmony of the song. That skill is shared by very few musicians. Most have to undergo much study independently or with a teacher to even begin to be able to improvise on that level. Lou was humble in his gift and loved his family and fellow musicians passionately.”

The bassist David Wertman and vocalist Lynne Meryl, who divide their time between the Pioneer Valley and Florida, offered their memories of Lou, who also wintered and worked in South Florida. David said, “I have played hundreds of shows with him over the last 20-plus years. Lou was foremost an entertainer. He had a great following because of the joy he had inside himself which he shared with all the world, his audience and the musicians on stage.  He encouraged exploration of sound, harmony, and melody, all in the name of a good show. This is what I learned most from Lou: ‘Musicians are entertainers and if you want to be successful…then love the people you perform for and let them know it’.  Lou always knew just what to play behind Lynne and would be very supportive, always sending her smiles and love. We did a concert about five or so years ago with Lou in the Berkshires and had Joe Pamilia join us…two great giants who have now passed on.”

Lynne said, “Lou was our friend and fantastic to be with on stage. He was so easy going, joyous and full of fun. His energy was contagious.  His playing was pure and simple and spot-on in any song, in any key.  As Dave knew, he was there to share the music and the fun and to entertain the audience…and he did that every single time …on whatever horn he picked up.”  Here’s Lou playing euphonium and trumpet with David and Lynne on Duke Ellington’s “I AIn’t Got Nothin’ But the Blues.”

Dick Johnson died two years ago, but his son Gary Johnson also enjoyed a long partnership with Colombo and played drums with him at the Roadhouse for over 20 years.  He said, “Even into his 85th year, Lou was still as vibrant as ever, his lip and chops were as strong as a player half his age.  He still had that spirit.  And as a former ballplayer, whenever he talked about baseball, his eyes still got as big as saucers and he talked with the exuberance of a kid.”

Gary’s sister Pam Sargent, whose husband is guitarist Gray Sargent, a member of Bennett’s quartet, said the Colombo and Johnson families “felt melded as one.  Our only solace is the thought that Dick and Lou may now be together again.”

Lou never seemed more than a few feet away in the venues where I heard him play, but despite the remote feel of this footage, little is lost in his sunny performance of “Amazing Grace.” ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912205597.84/warc/CC-MAIN-20190326160044-20190326182044-00370.warc.gz
80,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/jazzalamode/monkoscarevans-live-at-the-bbc/,"I devoted a couple of hours this morning to watching these televised performances by Thelonious Monk’s Quartet and the trios of Oscar Peterson and Bill Evans on the BBC series, Jazz 625. Humphrey Littleton, the jazz trumpeter, critic and raconteur, hosted the series in the mid-’60’s.  Monk’s Quartet includes Charlie Rouse, John Ore and Ben Riley mining familiar repertoire that’s still yielding surprises from Monk’s keyboard.  Ray Brown and Ed Thigpen are with Peterson, whose set kicks off with an original, “Hallelujah Time,” followed by three great jazz originals, “Con Alma,” “Waltz for Debby,” and Ray Bryant’s “Cubano Chant,” all underscored by Peterson’s marvelous orchestral conception.

The biggest surprise here is an hour-plus of The Bill Evans Trio playing twelve tunes over the course of two sets.  Individual cuts from this performance have been circulating on YouTube for awhile, but here we get the performance as it unfolded in March 1965.  Chuck Israels is on bass, Larry Bunker on drums, and while they are less aggressively interactive with Evans than his former trio mates Scott LaFaro and Paul Motian, this is nonetheless state-of-the-art Evans, with the added advantage of intimate camera angles.  Highlights include “Nardis” and “Israel,” the former composed by Miles Davis, the latter introduced on the trumpeter’s “Birth of the Cool” sessions, both staples of Evans’s repertoire.  The trio also plays “Summertime” and the Evans originals “Waltz for Debby,” and “Re: Person I Knew,” the latter an anagram for Orrin Keepnews, Evan’s longtime producer.

Evans’s biographer Peter Pettinger first saw the pianist during the engagement at Ronnie Scott’s that coincided with the appearance on Jazz 625.  In Bill Evans: How My Heart Sings, he makes the following observation based on this footage: “The fact that he ended up hunched over the keyboard could be taken as a good sign-the natural force of gravity was being tapped.  He started each number seated relatively upright; gradually, as the music developed, gravity took over.  The lower the head fell the better Evans played.  Finally, his open mouth showed that he was breathing freely-and only then would the music do likewise.”

Keith Shadwick, author of Bill Evans: Everything Happens to Me notes further that while Evans’s playing in the ’50’s featured long lines “alternated with chordal passages and more broken, rhythmically-jagged phrases,” by 1965 the two hands play “in tandem, the lines rarely reaching the length and melodic elaboration of those earlier years.”

First there was the crushing news of Roy Hargrove’s death (see our obituary; a more in-depth appreciation of that wonderful, and sorely missed, trumpeter by one of his closest friends will appear in our next issue). Then there was the excitement of tabulating our contributors’ votes for my debut year-end Top 50 list as JazzTimes editor (and it was exciting, even though the No. 1 new and historical albums were pretty much foregone conclusions). And then there were the moments that put everything in wider perspective. The most memorable of those happened at the Village Vanguard on Nov. 13, as I watched pianist Marcus Roberts make his first headlining appearance at that club in 15 years, covering his 1990 album Deep in the Shed in its entirety. That disc, his second as a leader, doesn’t generally get great ratings, despite its distinguished supporting cast (including a certain E. Dankworth, a.k.a. Wynton Marsalis). But Roberts has continued to tinker with its material, recutting it in 2012 and using it as a training platform for his students at Florida State University. The way it sounds these days, you’d have to call it a career highlight. On the original Deep in the Shed, Roberts worked with six other pieces. At the Vanguard, he had eight musicians—drummer Jason Marsalis; bassist Thaddeus Exposé; trombonist/tubist Corey Wilcox; reedmen Ricardo Pascal, Boyce Griffith, and Joe Goldberg; and trumpeters Alphonso Horne and Randall Haywood—several of whom studied with him at FSU. The extra instrumentation added a welcome richness to numbers like “Spiritual Awakening” and “Nebuchadnezzar,” which no longer belabor their debt to Ellington. This was no facsimile of a facsimile, but intricate, surprising, thoroughly lived-in music. I took in the set with a special guest: my wife. Twenty-two years ago, on our third date, we saw Marcus Roberts at the Village Vanguard. Jason Marsalis was the drummer back then too, and a mere 19. The mists of time have obscured many performance details, but it’s likely that they played some Deep in the Shed tunes. My wife-to-be then worked for the publicity firm representing Roberts, so we went in the back room to say hi after the show. I’d barely been introduced to the bandleader—who, I’ll emphasize, is blind—before he asked a pointed question: “So what’s up with you two?” Clearly, the man was on to something. And now, sitting in that same club with the same woman and the same people playing the same music so many years later, remembering that long-ago moment and conscious of all that had happened since—the births, deaths, victories, and setbacks—I was happy to be reminded that amid our everyday vicissitudes, some things do steadily improve with age. Like friendship, and love, and great jazz. ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912201996.61/warc/CC-MAIN-20190319143502-20190319165502-00267.warc.gz

www.brianmcmillenphotography.com November is traditionally the month when JazzTimes focuses on percussion, and that’s one reason why Brian Blade is on the front cover. Another reason: The last time he was on our cover, it was November 2000. Having been a fan of his drumming ever since I first saw him in Daniel Lanois’ band back in 1993, I find this 18-year gap—during which he’s played on close to 100 albums, many of them superb—close to unfathomable. Under the circumstances, it only seemed right to have him tackle a Bright Moments feature. Usually, we reserve these catalog-surveying pieces for older players, but given Blade’s track record over the past quarter-century, there was way more than enough to talk about. Elsewhere in the issue, Geoffrey Himes contributes a perceptive story on the Nigerian skinsman Tony Allen, a panel of experts give the drum solo some due respect, and we check in with kitmasters like Adam Nussbaum, Eliot Zigmund, and Allison Miller. Acknowledging that there’s more to percussion than just drums, we also got four of jazz’s leading vibraphonists together for an in-depth chat. Sign up for our weekly newsletter, full of reviews, profiles and more! Looking through these pages, though, I see another theme that goes beyond the musical striking of objects (as profound as that can be). The not-so-hidden leitmotif here is the value of learning. You can sense it in the way Chris Dave talks about Craig Green, his beloved middle-school drum instructor; or in how Nate Smith identifies his time in Betty Carter’s Jazz Ahead program as having changed his whole outlook; or in Joe Locke’s words about the greater responsibility that he feels his more gifted students need to embrace. The concentrated acquisition of knowledge, we are reminded again and again, is of vital importance. And so it’s appropriate that November is also the month when we publish our annual Jazz Education Guide—the second half of this issue. When I think of music education, I immediately flash back to the jazz ensemble I played guitar in when I was 12. We had some knowledge, but only a little, and that, as the saying goes, is a dangerous thing. We thoroughly enjoyed running through tunes by Duke Ellington, Freddie Hubbard, and McCoy Tyner, but most of us had only the vaguest idea of how to play solos. That sure didn’t keep us from taking them, though. The result was cacophony. One day, our teacher finally had enough. He sat us down in front of a blackboard and instructed us to take notes. On the board, he wrote out all the different modes for major and minor scales, plus a few extras like the altered mode. He told us which degrees of each mode were flat or sharp in comparison to a standard major scale, and which modes matched up best with particular chords. It was a mini-course in improvisational music theory, given to us in about an hour. That one hour changed everything—bolstered, of course, by years of subsequent practice. Suddenly I could understand what I was doing, and what other players were doing. And that, as anyone quoted in this issue could tell you, is the value of learning. Kudos to all who pass it on, in the classroom, on the bandstand, and even on the magazine page.

84,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/jt-notes/jazztimes-december-2018-issue-features-tales-of-the-unexpected/,"Ornette Coleman in 1988 (photo: Arthur Elgort) No, your eyes are not deceiving you. The picture on this page is indeed of Ornette Coleman playing alto saxophone while sitting on a red Harley-Davidson motorcycle. Arthur Elgort took that photograph 30 years ago. (You can see more of his images of jazz musicians in the feature on pg. 42 of our December issue.) When I asked him about it recently, this is what he had to say: “I got along with Ornette, and people say, ‘That’s a miracle,’ because he could be difficult. He came to my studio [on Crosby Street in Manhattan] for a Rolling Stone shoot, I think. He had his son”—Denardo, also his drummer and manager—“with him the whole time and he’d ask his son, ‘Can I do this?’ and he’d say, ‘Yes, you can, it’s okay.’ So I had him sit on my Harley, which he liked. We didn’t run it, it was just a prop. First I shot it with no hat, but I had a hat there and I said, ‘Try this hat on, I want to see how you look,’ and he looked more like a jazz musician. He loved it. At least his son did.” More like a jazz musician indeed. The hat is the droll coup de grâce of an image that brings together two great American products—jazz and motorcycles—in an almost comically unnatural way. That Ornette asked, “Can I do this?” makes sense because you wouldn’t expect the great harmolodist, the High Priest of Free Jazz, to do such a thing. At least, not at first. Upon further reflection, though, an obvious question presents itself: Didn’t Ornette make a specialty out of not doing what others expected of him? The same year Elgort took this photo, Ornette’s band Prime Time (featuring Denardo) released Virgin Beauty on Portrait Records. Some critics were put out by the music’s relative commerciality—“relative” being the operative word—and the guest spots by Grateful Dead guitarist Jerry Garcia. They hadn’t thought their avant-garde hero would make such a move toward the mainstream. But Ornette, as usual, was thinking differently. “I always told people I was commercial,” he told Rolling Stone’s David Fricke at the time, “because I was the only person doing what I was doing. Nobody did it but me. There’s not two Coca-Colas; there’s only one Coca-Cola. I thought of myself on that level.” Having seen Prime Time live in Boston on the Virgin Beauty tour, I can assure you that no one on that Berklee Performance Center stage was making artistic compromises in pursuit of sales. When it comes to doing what people don’t expect, the singers and players profiled in this issue of JazzTimes can tell you a thing or two. I’m thinking in particular of Cécile McLorin Salvant and Donny McCaslin, who in their different ways continue to break new ground in their work and leave us listeners wondering what they could possibly do next. That inner impulse to go for the choice that isn’t obvious—to say, “Yes, I will sit on the Harley, because why shouldn’t I?”—is both rare and necessary, and it deserves to be treasured.

The manic optimism of America in the 1920s yielded hot jazz; the conservatism of the Reagan era bolstered the history-minded Young Lions; today, globalization has granted the music an international aesthetic few could have imagined in the ’50s. In the 1960s and ’70s, political upheaval and the spirit of psychedelia inspired musicians in rock and jazz to look for contexts far removed from what they’d been given. Many, including John and Alice Coltrane, looked East, toward Indian religions that offered the promise of inner tranquility and universal oneness. After John died in 1967, Alice found an everlasting salve in Hinduism, and until her death in 2007, she made music that matched the African-American traditions whence she came with the spiritual sounds that reflected where she was going. A brilliant program, organized by the Red Bull Music Academy and held in May, in a cavernous renovated factory space in Queens, celebrated Alice’s two eras of elated music-making. First was a set of her original devotional music, sung by members of her Sai Anantam Ashram, which she founded in 1983 but whose roots reach back to the mid-’70s. Driven via a rhythm section featuring John (and Alice) Coltrane alum Reggie Workman on bass, this music presented a fascinating cross-cultural proposition; keenly, it understood how to fuse the power of repetition inherent in the collective melodies of Hindu music with the gospel-derived grooves of R&B and soul-jazz. In the evening’s second half—after concertgoers were allowed to put their shoes on—a band led by John and Alice’s son, saxophonist Ravi, and including Workman, harpist Brandee Younger, drummer Jeff “Tain” Watts, cornetist Graham Haynes and keyboardists David Virelles and Courtney Bryan, paid pretty faithful homage to Alice’s work as a lodestar of spiritual-jazz. “Journey in Satchidananda,” the genre-defining set opener, sounded just as it should, with a meditative swing and sitar-and-harp scrim that conjured up the requisite atmosphere. And so it went through “Translinear Light,” “Blue Nile” and others, all adding up to the kind of striking musical time-trip that audiophiles spend their lives pursuing.

Fellow jazz obsessives, you know the sort: audiophile turntable that could be traded for a used car; speakers positioned in their thoroughly tested sweet spots; hardwood shelving built into the walls, packed with vinyl and CDs organized by record label; an Eames lounge chair with matching ottoman.

As with most things, reality hasn’t measured up. I live among modest gear in a cramped Queens apartment stuffed to the gills with CDs and books, plus a storage unit whose rental payments have eclipsed the value of its contents 1,000 times over. For a while, this constant, unwinnable struggle to catalogue gave me a different aspiration: to rent one of those clutterless hypermodern pads exclusive to cellphone commercials and CSI: Miami. I could control all of my music through an iPad and wouldn’t have to dust ever again. My girlfriend wouldn’t have to live between boxes of Blue Note promos at the world’s shabbiest performing arts library.

But MP3 and streaming sound does good music no justice, and I loathe reading liner notes online. And in recent years-especially over the past couple of months-a succession of vault releases from Resonance Records has restored my faith in and allegiance to the CD era. This issue is saturated with coverage of those packages, from the main attraction (Bill Evans) through Opening Chorus (the Thad Jones/Mel Lewis Orchestra) and into the reviews section (Stan Getz/João Gilberto, Larry Young, Sarah Vaughan). Usually I’d be concerned about appearances of favoritism, but anyone who owns these sets knows the score.

Most important, the music has been one occasion for reevaluation after another. Through Resonance’s efforts we’ve experienced Coltrane’s singing voice, and with respect to Young or Wes Montgomery, heard fascinatingly unformed playing by musicians yet to settle into stylistic trademarks. In the case of Bill Evans, one of jazz’s great unlived bands gets its rightful studio release a half-century late. (There too the performance differs from our mind’s eye, with surprisingly hard angles.) The voluminous liner essays, interviews and rare photos included in these products might recall the ’90s box-set explosion, but I don’t recall much from that period that exhibited Resonance’s level of dedication to research and excavation. The company does make its releases (and notes) available via download, but you’ll want this stuff in your hands.

87,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/jt-notes/jt-notes-keith-jarrett-political-humorist/,"I received a few sharp emails in response to my January/February column, which opened with barbs directed at President Trump. That rhetoric has no business in a jazz rag, these incensed readers argued, before the obligatory threat of a subscription cancellation. In many ways I agree with the pushback: Here they were, trying to unwind with an article on the best jazz albums of the year, and they’re forced to endure the same kind of political snark that just provoked them to turn off the TV. I understand their pain, and my introduction assumed political affiliation of my readership, which I regret. But the wound was fresh then, our political and cultural environment is spectacularly bizarre, and the arts don’t exist in a vacuum. To prove that last point, I assigned Michael J. West a feature that surveys post-election feelings within the jazz scene, with input from Sonny Rollins, Branford Marsalis, Terri Lyne Carrington, Antonio Sanchez and others. Several of these artists clearly feel compelled to react to the current administration with their music, as if they have no choice. That same sense of urgency was evident at Carnegie Hall in February, when Keith Jarrett peppered two hours of incomparable solo improvisations with anti-Trump commentary that maintained a casual comic buoyancy without obscuring the fury at its core. He read, from notes, a laundry list of disparaging descriptors; he reminded us of Trump’s “unpresidented” Twitter flub; he excoriated the president’s cabinet picks; he questioned aloud the relevancy of the Electoral College; he reiterated that the Constitution is important, and that love is good and hate and racism are bad. And his jokes tended to land. “Dark times call for dark harmonies,” he quipped after one lyrically murky piece. Jarrett’s solo concerts have a romantic history of being inspired by struggle, and his disaffection, emboldened by the packed house’s appreciative response to it, leavened him with good humor while guiding his pianism into the stratosphere. The concert was rooted in Jarrett’s trademarked expert balance of light and night, tension and release. But on this night his spontaneous rhapsodies were so fully realized it was jarring; improv after improv I began searching for the title of a songbook or gospel gem in my mind, to no avail. When he did dip into standards during the encores, he began to tear up. We’re going through a “tough time,” he said, “but it ain’t over yet.” And he closed with an admission: “You’re the first audience that made me cry.” Were they tears of joy, or sadness, or anger? As in the music, all of the above. ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912204969.39/warc/CC-MAIN-20190326095131-20190326121131-00434.warc.gz

But timeliness? Not so much. I’m sending this completed, polished “In Memoriam” issue to the printer at the same time I’m editing an online obituary for Hugh Masekela. Surely the architect of South African jazz should’ve had a major part in this issue’s compilation of loving tributes, but the presses aren’t as easily stopped as they might seem from movies. Luckily we have the website too, so visit JazzTimes.com for a remembrance from a fellow musician who knew and loved Bra Hugh. In the meantime, here are my two cents: In 2009 I traveled to the Cape Town International Jazz Festival, where I was able to glean some genuine understanding of the magnitude of his cultural importance. In a sweat-soaked concert celebrating his 70th birthday, Masekela threaded his lyrical flugelhorn through buoyant endemic grooves; as I wrote at the time, it skewed a bit pop-jazz for my taste. But the spiritual clout that emerged when he shouted and sang was truly astounding—like a salve for the hometown audience, not yet two decades removed from the fall of apartheid. Seven years later, when the Obamas hosted International Jazz Day at the White House, he entranced again, offering his “Bring Him Back Home (Nelson Mandela)” alongside an all-star band. I’ve rarely witnessed such a natural leader, like strength and optimism personified. (There was another in the crowd that night.) Masekela will certainly be included in the farewells segment at next year’s Jazz Congress, an event whose inaugural edition took place Jan. 11-12 at Jazz at Lincoln Center in New York. Presented by JALC and JazzTimes, it featured a diverse program of panels and learning sessions—many of which are still available for viewing through JALC’s website. A few personal favorites: Ethan Iverson and Wynton Marsalis sharing a thoughtful, diplomatic dialogue on jazz and race; an insightful discussion of jazz and gender featuring musicians like Ingrid Jensen and Terri Lyne Carrington; and a motivating keynote speech from Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, excerpted in Opening Chorus.

A profile shot, slightly blurry around the edges, of a man with a dark, sharp-pointed goatee, wearing a green plaid jacket and black fedora. His right eye (the only one visible) was shut, as if he’d been caught in repose, but that slight blurriness suggested his moment of rest was ending and he was about to burst into some unpredictable action. The words in an archaic font running down the left side of the cover were punctuated by two syllable-breaking hyphens: MONK’S DREAM THE THELO-NIOUS MONK QUAR-TET Thelonious Monk? What kind of a name was that? My father had bought the LP when Columbia first issued it, in 1963. I found it in his collection 20 years later. I was 11. For more than two years, I’d been listening almost exclusively to the Beatles and other 1960s British Invasion bands. Their music had inspired me to take up the guitar, and I still loved it dearly, but I was ready for something else. And what I heard when I dropped the needle on “Monk’s Dream”—those fractured piano chords, that melody delighting in its own lack of resolution, that corkscrew Charlie Rouse tenor sax solo, so aggressive and yet so whimsical—was indeed something else. Further epiphanies followed. Some came via my dad’s longstanding interest in the music: Miles, Mulligan and Baker, Brubeck and Desmond, Ellington’s Blanton-Webster band. Others were triggered later by teachers, friends, and even radio DJs: A Love Supreme, Bill Frisell, the Julius Hemphill Big Band album, Henry Threadgill’s Too Much Sugar for a Dime. By the time that last disc came out, I’d already spent two years playing in jazz ensembles in the New England Conservatory’s extension division—one of them led by future Klezmatic Matt Darriau—and another seven years studying guitar privately with Berklee professor Craig Hlady. I’d learned all about ii-V-I turnarounds, the Lydian mode, and the glories (and shortcomings) of The Real Book. The music I was making for myself still leaned closer to rock, but I was using what I’d learned to write more about jazz, first for The Boston Phoenix, then for Musician, where I was on the editorial staff for eight years. As the ’90s turned to the ’00s, my day-to-day awareness of the jazz scene slowly diminished; I got caught up first in writing a book on the rock band Radiohead, then in editing a variety of music education-related magazines. But my love of jazz stayed strong, and so I was gratified when Evan Haga brought me into the JazzTimes fold as a freelancer three years ago. Reviewing worthy new albums, drawing attention to undersung players, interviewing and writing about giants like John McLaughlin, Jimmy Heath, and Ron Carter—it felt like a homecoming. Now, after more than a decade at JazzTimes, Evan has moved on, choosing me to be his successor as editor. It’s a challenging task, and sometimes I find myself worrying whether I’ll be able to uphold the high standards that Evan maintained. Then I remember my dad (now 14 years gone) and his records, and the cover of Monk’s Dream and all that it set into motion, and I know it’s going to be okay. For in the end, this job is grounded in the same thing I felt when I was 11: the thrill of discovering great music. That thrill never fades, and I consider it an honor to keep on discovering along with you.

This column was supposed to be different. This column was supposed to be a fervent, even giddy recounting of an inspired dialogue between two absolute giants of the avant-garde, Pharoah Sanders and Archie Shepp, perfectly timed to kick off this saxophone-themed issue. “At one of the jazz year’s essential events, the NEA Jazz Masters Tribute Concert,” it might have read, “Sanders and Shepp turned the stately Kennedy Center Concert Hall into a sonic cathedral.” I probably would’ve revised that last trite bit, but you get the idea: Sanders and Shepp were in the building, but their axes must have stayed back at the hotel. In 2014, the Jazz Masters induction ceremony reached a kind of tipping point, stretching toward three and a half hours, as the New York Times detailed, too much of that time devoted to boundless speechifying. The 2015 program, which I attended and reported on for JT, was delightfully paced and deftly organized. Most transformative, it saw a shift from artist-to-artist tributes to performances by the honorees themselves. Think about experiencing Carla Bley, George Coleman and Charles Lloyd within the same two-hour concert. Not bad.

The April 4, 2016 celebration, just an hour and 40 minutes long, could have used more bells and whistles. But before criticism becomes cynicism, let’s give credit where it’s due. The skillfully directed enterprise did include a grip of peerless talent and, perhaps most important, was open to the public and admission-free. Its true purpose-to honor the new class of Jazz Masters, not to give jazz insiders the concert of their dreams-was dutifully served, and like the rest of the crowd, Sanders, Shepp, vibraphonist Gary Burton and musicians’ advocate Wendy Oxenhorn received an indelible night. I’m thinking of a medley homage to Shepp, boasting Jason Moran and the locomotive frontline of David Murray, Rudresh Mahanthappa, Roswell Rudd and Ambrose Akinmusire. And a pair of sterling duo performances, including nods to Burton (Chick Corea and Stefon Harris meditating on the former’s “Crystal Silence”) and Sanders (Randy Weston and Billy Harper interpreting Weston’s “The Healers”). And Jimmy Heath, Lakecia Benjamin and Justin Kauflin quickly developing working-band rapport. Not bad.

91,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/jt-notes/together-through-life-paying-tribute-looking-ahead/,"A scene from the 2019 Jazz Congress (photo: Lawrence Sumulong/Jazz at Lincoln Center) In JazzTimes’ first issue of every new year, dated March (January/February doesn’t count because we actually finish producing that issue in December), it’s become our custom to reserve a large amount of feature space for tributes to those in the jazz community who passed away in the previous year. Necessarily, and sadly, this issue’s collection of farewells is only an abridged list of the individuals we lost in 2018. Two more, Jerry González and Roy Hargrove, are remembered in separate sections of the magazine. Another three receive brief notices in our news section, along with two charter members of the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians who shuffled off this mortal coil early in 2019, Alvin Fielder and Joseph Jarman. See our next issue for more on Jarman and the groundbreaking ensemble that survives him. Subscribe today to JazzTimes magazine and receive reviews, industry news, profiles and much more brought right to you! Putting the tribute feature together can be a moving experience. I was particularly touched by Oliver Lake’s poem for his World Saxophone Quartet comrade Hamiet Bluiett; Marcin Wasilewski’s memories of his “musical father” Tomasz Stanko; Ethan Iverson’s tender essay on a tough broad, the Village Vanguard’s Lorraine Gordon; and the frankly beautiful way in which René Marie describes the inspiration Aretha Franklin’s music provided at a critical moment for her family. But I’ve got to be honest: Day after day of going over these words, and rounding up the pictures to accompany them, can take on a certain morbid “I see dead people” aspect as well. Luckily, there were plenty of positive developments to counteract the sadness. The second annual Jazz Congress, co-produced by this magazine and Jazz at Lincoln Center on Jan. 7 and 8 at JALC’s New York headquarters, was an unqualified success. Attendance was way up over last year (the line at the registration desk on the first morning was something to behold), the conference schedule was full of entertaining and informative panel discussions and workshops, and there was much mixing and mingling across all sectors of the jazz biz. As always, whatever the nominal topic, the hang was the main event. Similarly, the Winter Jazzfest in NYC, celebrating its 15th anniversary and stretching over nine January nights, offered plenty of reason to be excited about this music’s future. The kaleidoscopic arrangements of Brian Krock’s Big Heart Machine at the Sheen Center, the quietly intense interplay of María Grand and Fay Victor at Zinc Bar, the brainy grooves of Makaya McCraven at the Bowery Ballroom, the gutsy brilliance of Miles Okazaki’s solo-guitar Monk deconstructions at the Soho Playhouse—these and many more sets continually showed off the mutability, the potency, and the essential vitality of this thing called jazz. You’ll be reading more about both Jazz Congress and Winter Jazzfest in upcoming issues of JT, but the big lesson they teach us can be phrased simply right here and now: Jazz has survived the passing of many elders, and it can survive many more. We who remain are the ones who keep the music alive. And we will, as long as we stick together.

92,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/moja/abstract-jazz-swing-groove-day-8-at-the-montreal-jazz-festival/,"Lionel Loueke & Russ Davis at the Montreal International Jazz Festival 2013 The lineup of the Montreal Jazz Festival on the 5th of July, the 8th full day of this 10-day event, included lots of the tradition of swinging jazz alongside the more modern and world jazz offerings. The great Canadian pianist Oliver Jones, seemingly haven taken the place of Oscar Peterson in the hearts of his jazz-loving countrymen after Peterson’s passing, would play in a solo show. The legendary Preservation Hall Jazz Band would be filling the Theatre Jean-Duceppe with the classic sound of New Orleans as they celebrate their 25th year in existence with their new album That’s It!  The charming Canadian songbird Nikki Yanofsky, performing music from her new Quincy Jones-produced release The Little Secret, would be singing standards new and old in a totally modern way while proving she’s grown from the teenager who played the festival not long ago into a talented young lady and a true vocal star. American Bill Charlap, known for swinging on the piano, as well as being the lucky guy who’s married to Canadian-born pianist Renee Rosnes, would give fans of the traditional side of things all they’d need. I’d seen all of these greats, except for Mr. Jones, and decided to seek out the more adventurous artists on the lineup and to hear more new stars I’d never heard before this trip to Montreal.

I began the day, though, in conversation with an artist I’ve been looking to meet for some time, Benin-born guitarist Lionel Loueke, who was performing at the club L’Astral with his trio in celebration of his latest solo work titled Heritage.  I caught up with him in the afternoon after soundcheck and in fifteen minutes uncovered the story of Africa’s current “Prince of Jazz” who feels a strong connection not only to his home continent but to Europe and The United States as well. Many of the listeners to my program Jazz America on Voice of America are in various African countries and I have received numerous email messages instructing me to have Lionel as a guest on the show. I passed this along to Mr. Loueke and he simply smiled. He appears to be a very deep, humble, intelligent and gentle soul who never overreacts to anything. I could tell he was pleased to be loved by his fellow Africans though his connection to Europe and The USA are just as strong, having gone through some profound changes during the times of his studies in Paris, Boston at the Berklee College of Music and New York where he attended the “Jazz University of the Streets.” His talents garnered the attention of the likes of Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter, Terence Blanchard, Esperanza Spalding, Joe Lovano and others. His solo recordings on Blue Note have been well received and life is generally very good for Lionel Loueke.

I took in his performance later in the night with his trio featuring a Nigerian-born but well-travelled bassist and American drummer. The set began with two pieces that seemed to reflect that gentle side of his soul. I was waiting for the African fire to ignite and only had to wait until the third song of the set. His powerful drummer and that distinctive, thunderous bass of African music were the perfect complement to Lionel’s bright guitar sound. He occasionally embellished the sound inherent in his guitar with simple devices. His voice  is also a major part of his sound and it was presented both clean and sometimes electronically enhanced with great effect. The last song was sung in the Yoruban language, which is not native to him, but he was flawless. There was lots of variety in this show, proving that Lionel Loueke is not just an “African Jazz Musician” but a musician and man of the world in general. One can only imagine how far this fine talent will go.

Earlier in the evening I took in the first of two shows presenting what I might call “Jazz In The Abstract.” This one, the second of three performances in Vijay Iyer’s Invitation Series, featured the dual pianos of Mr. Iyer and Craig Taborn. Knowing that Craig Taborn has been known to get funky and to electrify his sound I wasn’t sure what we might hear on this night, but upon entering The Gesu I saw two grand pianos arranged in a “yin-yang” formation so it was obvious that this was to be an all-acoustic presentation. Both gentlemen play with great energy as well as with gentle subtlety so anything was possible. Craig Taborn, like many pianists, has recently released a solo piano album so he’s capable of holding his own with any acoustic pianist. As the performance began the mood was quiet and the atmosphere intense in a cerebral way. The two pianists traded passages and overlapped just a bit with the lines they played but mostly seemed to be creating a call and response pattern as well as taking some space for themselves during the extended pieces that had a definite beginning but no logical end. I wondered if there could or should be any preparation for a performance such as this.

A couple of thoughts struck me as I took it all in. Firstly, could this be considered jazz? There certainly was improvisation. There was harmony, melody and discord but the rhythm was free and the form seemed shapeless. My second thought was concerning what critics of art thought when painters began to create new works that looked unlike anything that had been done before. What did they think when what had been totally discernable before suddenly looked shockingly abstract and otherworldly? I might call the music made by Vijay Iyer and Craig Taborn otherworldly and abstract. A spirit was conjured, no doubt, as these two keyboard masters expressed themselves in a completely personal and spontaneous way.

One of the joys of a festival like Montreal is that once you’ve been under the spell of one impressive performance you can suddenly find yourself in another world altogether. I emerged from the dark, inner sanctum of The Gesu to the summery out of doors of the festival grounds where I found myself in front of the Scene CBC/Radio-Canada stage to take in the rousing performance by one of Canada’s rising stars of piano, John Roney, and his young trio performing mostly music from his new release St-Henri. It had been suggested by more than a few people that I see this guy and he did not disappoint. I’d heard that he had become one of the popular purveyors of Post Bop but had now moved into more electric and modern jazz. I don’t have many regrets concerning this year’s festival but one is that I missed the performance by the Canadian 6-string bass wizard Alain Caron.

My old friend and radio associate Mark Ruffin had chided me for not seeing that show as he knows my taste in jazz and told me it was right down my alley. He mentioned that John Roney and his drummer were part of the band that backed up Mr. Caron and that they were killing! He also mentioned that John Roney’s band was not to be missed. I always take Mark’s advice and he and I were there in the crowd rocking right along with the powerful bass lines and pounding drums that accompanied John Roney’s multi-keyboard setup. They blazed through a set of Roney’s own tunes as well as a variety of others as diverse as the music of drum & bass artist Squarepusher to a delightfully re-harmonized version of Chick Corea’s “Spain.” The sets are limited to about an hour in the outdoor stages so as to keep to schedule and not overlap with the sound coming from other stages in close proximity but I, and the rest of the audience, could have listened on for as long as Mr. Roney and crew cared to play.

My last stop of the night was back inside the Gesu to hear one of the most inventive saxophonists around today, Tim Berne. The show as billed as music from his recent ECM album Snakeoil, but there were a few surprises in store at this performance. From the beginning I could tell that we’d be hearing “serious” music delivered with a light-hearted flair by Mr. Berne and his quartet of young guns, pianist Matt Mitchell, drummer Ches Smith and clarinetist Oscar Noriega. Again, if one was looking for great improvised music but not traditional swing you were in the right place. Tim Berne has probably heard a bit of John Cage, Philip Glass, Bela Bartok and Stockhausen over the years I would imagine. When new classical music blends with new jazz a most interesting convergence can occur and in the case of this evening with Tim Berne’s musical presentation that is exactly what transpired and, in my opinion, with delightful results.

Montreal audiences are an experienced lot who’ve seen it all and are well versed in hearing most every kind of artistic presentation. This audience was in tune with Mr. Berne and band with every note. They were also listening to every word he had to say between songs which were as entertaining a part of the program as the music. Tim Berne is a FUNNY man who acted as if he was reluctant to speak but because the microphone was there he felt obligated to do so. He mentioned that the band was working on two albums, one that was already finished and the other in the works, and that they’d play music from both. He also mentioned that he was in a “song title slump” and had about 20 titles for each piece and would eventually decide. He then played a song that had the title “Jesus Christ Minibar.” Can you sense the sarcasm? Between each well-crafted piece of abstract Tim Berne jazz that featured stellar performances by this formidable group of musicians came more commentary from Berne as he blasted the “Pirates” who download music for free and the “Pirates” at the record companies who make money while the “Non-Pirates” (the musicians) make much less. The moral of the story according to Tim Berne…invest in the Pirates! At the end of the set the crowd roared for more and he returned to the stage asking them if that was REALLY a request for more or were they just being nice, and didn’t they have a “Law & Order” episode that they could be watching on TV somewhere? The band finished with a beautiful Paul Motian piece and the crowd and the musicians dispersed into the Montreal midnight with stimulated and satisfied minds. Thus my trip to the 34th Festival International de Jazz de Montreal came to a close. I’m already planning for next year! Russ Davis

93,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/moja/moja-radio-celebrates-its-fifth-anniversary/,"Randy Brecker and Russ Davis In May of 2014 MOJA Radio, the online service I call “The World’s MOdern JAzz Radio Channel,” turns 5 years old and I just felt like it was time to take stock of where we came from, where we’ve been, where we are and where we will go as we proceed in the ever-evolving world of jazz in the 21st century as heard in cyber-world. To simply be actively involved in programming and presenting this area of jazz and still be thriving is pretty astounding. I sometimes feel like a jazz musician who has chosen to express himself in a personal way and just let the chips fall where they may as opposed to crafting something that might get me more work in the jazz arena as it exists today. It isn’t that brave an endeavor really. I’m simply doing what I know how to do and building on something that began for me way back in the 20th century.  I hope you’ll indulge me as I tell this story. The beginning was 1978 in Atlanta where my bosses at WQXI-FM (AKA 94-Q) commissioned me to create a Sunday night (7 PM-Midnight) “jazz” show to complement the album rock format that the station presented the rest of the time. I was a bit confused as I told them I wasn’t a “Jazz expert” and not very conversant with the more straight-ahead forms like bop, hard bop, free and other related genres. My mother had raised me listening to the big bands she loved in the 30’s & 40’s and that was cool, but a bit out of date and the sound quality was not up to par with what could be programmed on the air. Plus I couldn’t quote chapter and verse on that music either. At this point in jazz history the Fusion Era was in full swing and this was a music I knew and loved. I remember hearing Miles Davis’s “Right Off” from the album Jack Johnson, the electric shuffle featuring John McLaughlin’s chunky guitar and Herbie Hancock on organ, and thinking “if this is jazz today then I’m a Jazzer!” Contemporary jazz artists like David Sanborn, George Benson, Joe Sample and the Crusaders, Bob James, Pat Metheny and others were starting to move the music toward a more mass appeal and accessible sound and style. My bosses simply said “Do Something!” So the program Jazz Flavours was born with a blend of fusion and contemporary that seemed to strike a chord with the Atlanta audience. For 10 great years the program flourished, expanding to a nightly show and achieving great ratings. Anyone who knows about jazz from 1978-1988 will remember how Chick Corea, Al Jarreau, Stanley Clarke, George Duke, Herbie, Metheny, Sanborn and so many others were hitting their stride and leading the way in creating an engaging and popular form of improvised music.  The format we’d created in Atlanta was noticed elsewhere and in 1988 I was offered the job of programming the startup of a new contemporary jazz radio station in New York City owned by The Tribune Company. They were flipping the pop station WPIX-FM to WQCD-FM (CD 101.9 it would be called) and I accepted immediately but asked that I be given the title of Music Director instead of Program Director as I wanted to spend my time with on air work and music programming instead of with administrative duties. We assembled an all-star, powerhouse staff with a unified vision and a wealth of new music to present that filled an obvious void for a jazz-hungry audience in the world’s jazz capital, New York. Not only did regular programming please the audience but our special programming including my interview program Words & Music, our New Age and Traditional Jazz shows as well as occasional live performances from venues as varied as The World Trade Center Plaza, The Bottom Line, JVC Jazz Festival shows from Houston via satellite and many more added extra spice to the programming. We were playing the music of the established stars and developing new ones with each passing week and expanding our playlist to include new trends like Acid Jazz, the fun and funky style born in the dance clubs of England. Jazz purists might not have heard a lot of what they loved but what people thought of as a new kind of cool jazz was certainly a hit in New York.  For almost a decade we rolled along, achieving ratings and sales figures far beyond the original projections. All was fine until in the mid 1990’s deregulation of broadcasting was made law followed by a group of researchers, consultants, gold-diggers and snake oil salesmen who came along to talk our general manager, and obviously the GM’s of a lot of stations around the country, into abandoning a more adventurous way of programming for one that was totally formulated, predictable (by design) and constrained to include only the music that qualified by achieving a certain score in what was called “auditorium testing.” The methodology for this was placing a number of people in a room for a couple of hours, listening to 8-10 second “hooks” of a few hundred songs. As each segment played they were asked to turn a dial to the right if they liked the song and to the left if they did not like it. Or was that to the left if they liked it and to the right if they didn’t? I can’t seem to remember and I have a feeling neither could the participants. Ear fatigue would set in pretty quickly for many people. Another problem with this testing was that we were not only testing the supposedly most important segments of instrumental pieces but also songs by the likes of Rod Stewart, The Doobie Brothers, Paul Simon, Stevie Wonder ballads, Anita Baker…you get the idea.  I remember asking the guy who brought this into our station whether or not we could test “The National Anthem?” I figured that would get a good rating and we could start every hour with it. He didn’t like that idea and I’m sure he could see I wasn’t on board. We were instructed to take the results and implement the findings into our programming immediately by taking out anything similar to whatever tested badly and put more in of the style that did. What happened was that the Contemporary Jazz format that we had established and with which we had been having such great success was changed overnight to one called “Smooth Jazz,” a name I always thought would be great for a laxative. Our contemporary jazz format was dead on the spot and though these guys would argue that their new format flourished and had great ratings success I ask you where is that format now? I rest my case. I had been keeping my creative chops going with syndicated programs including versions of my original Jazz Flavours show for the Atlanta market and in other cities around the country as well as my interview show that I called Conversations. I had also been hired to do weekly shows overseas, Cool Cuts for Bay FM 78 in Tokyo and New York Jazz Week for England’s Jazz FM, but after a decade of fun, games and success at CD 101.9 I was ready to leave and when Tribune sold the station to a Midwestern radio conglomerate, they were apparently ready for me to leave too.  Luckily satellite radio was starting up and I was hired in 1998 to create two channels for what was then called CD Radio, later to be named Sirius. One channel would be a true contemporary jazz channel and the other more of what would be, for lack of a better term, a smooth jazz channel. This was my first chance to actually delve into the conscious difference in the two formats and to actually formulate the lines of demarcation between them. For a couple of years I worked with a great group of programmers as we did the preparatory work for one of the largest technical rollouts in broadcasting history. We created the formats from scratch and tested them out on the in-house system. Sirius had the philosophy that satellite radio would basically be a music streaming service with minimal interruption only for short bits of identifying audio. The original programming heads had been hired from the Music Choice service so they were doing what they knew how to do, create a form of muzak for satellite transmission instead of cable delivery. I remember one day the staff was called into a meeting to discuss the most recent
ly revealed activities of our competition, XM Satellite Radio, which had just posted their programming intentions online. As we listened and viewed the announcement of what they would be doing it was clear that they were going to “re-invent radio.” It was also clear that this would include real, live people talking about the music, special programming and all the trappings of what people-to-people radio has been about since the very beginning. Drats! Sirius would now have to create “real radio” too! Not long thereafter I found myself at odds with my immediate superior and packed up my things and found the door in 2000.  I was not lacking a creative outlet though as in 1999 I had been hired by the U. S. Government service Voice of America to program and present a 2-hour weekly show that we would call Jazz America. My superior, John Stevenson, told me that I was following the legendary Willis Conover who had presented the only jazz show on VOA for over 40 years. His time on VOA had spanned the years of the Cold War and he’d had a very special relationship with and impact on listeners around the world, but most especially on those behind the Iron Curtain. His form of jazz was almost totally traditional or straight ahead and his personal relationships with artists included the likes of Duke Ellington and Count Basie. I had by this time developed similarly solid  relationships with Chick Corea, Pat Metheny and many others from the more modern side of things and I wondered why John had chosen me over the many other presenters who might have been more qualified to pick up where Willis had left off with a completely traditional jazz approach? He told me that Willis simply would not program this type of music and that this was precisely why he hired me. He knew of my background and that a blending of the new and the old was what he wanted.  Well this was thrilling to me and now, fifteen years later, I continue to present what I term “The best of jazz, past and present, and conversation with the music makers” on Jazz America. I find this work completely satisfying as I have had the luxury of learning about and presenting as much as I want from the glorious past that jazz has created in over a century of evolution while keeping up with all the trends as they’ve emerged. Seeing how all of these styles can blend together seamlessly has been, and still is, a great thrill and learning experience for me and I hope for the listeners around the world.  While I was embarking on the beginnings of my work at VOA and finishing up my work at Sirius I was given another great opportunity, to continue my work in satellite radio and to create a one-of-a-kind radio channel that could define what modern jazz is for the 21st century. I was hired to create the channel Beyond Jazz for XM Satellite Radio. About a week after leaving Sirius I received a call from and took a meeting with Dave Logan, the VP of operations at XM and one of the most brilliant, driven, hard-working and charismatic leaders I’ve ever met in all my years of broadcasting. He asked if I would be interested in creating two channels for XM, a new age music channel called Audio Visions, and a jazz channel that would occupy the space between smooth and traditional jazz called Beyond Jazz. My answer was quickly an affirmative and though the seeds for what would become MOJA Radio had been planted with Jazz Flavours in Atlanta, CD 101.9 in New York and at Sirius, the plant began to grow and reach for the sun with Beyond Jazz.  One of the earliest promotional phrases used to describe the service was “Beyond AM…Beyond FM…XM Satellite Radio!” So when Lee Abrams, the mad scientist and VP of Programming for XM, decided on the name of my channel he envisioned a jazz channel that would be more than jazz and one that would, like other channels in other musical genres on the XM lineup, re-define the genre, just as XM would redefine radio. With Dave Logan giving the staff all the facilities, materials and motivation we’d need and Lee Abrams giving us all the direction and inspiration we’d need there was no way we’d create anything other than radio that was, if not brilliant, at least interesting and different from what had come before. I dare say few people in any field are given a more inspiring commission! Lee Abrams would stage what he called “Bootcamps” for the programming staff at which he’d present his inspirational pep talks with suggestions like “tap into your George Martin gene!” References like this were not lost on anyone who understood how producer Martin had transformed what would have possibly been only a regionally popular little skiffle, rock & roll band from Liverpool into a world-wide phenomenon by redefining the sound and style of what they recorded that was beyond comparison with even the most talented competition. The more ground breaking and creative we could be the better. With my new age channel I could create a meditative, flowing channel that was fashioned to please listeners musically while simultaneously “casting a spell” under which they would be until they turned off the channel. With Beyond Jazz I had something a bit different in mind. It seems to me that the turn of the century was a perfect time to create a new, re-defining channel for modern jazz. Though Free Jazz, Hard Bop and Soul Jazz had certainly marked a shift from straight swing, the Fusion Era had opened up things in an entirely different way, in that it had introduced electric instruments, most especially electric guitar, piano and violin, synthesizers and assorted other devices, into the mix of improvised music. With that came the new rhythms and energy taken from rock and the infusion of world music…thank you George Harrison & Ravi Shankar and all you Brazilians and Africans out there! Contemporary jazz had learned a lot from the soul music of Motown, Memphis and Muscle Shoals. Disco was the bane of the existence of many a jazzer and rocker but dance music and it’s electronic percussion and rhythms were having an effect on the younger generation of improvisers, most especially in Europe and other parts of the world outside of America. Americans would eventually catch up with Drum & Bass, Techno, Jazztronica, Jungle and other forms emerging over the years. For about a decade the movement of fun, up, funky danceable music called Acid Jazz, born in the English clubs concert halls and off-shore pirate radio stations, had swept across the globe capturing a whole new generation of listeners, dancers, music lovers and consumers who may have never thought they’d like jazz. The same can be said for the fans of another America movement called Jambands who took their lead from the likes of The Grateful Dead, The Allman Brothers and Phish. When greats like Branford Marsalis and John Scofield began collaborating with these guys the jazz world knew something was up and that is was not to be ignored. Many may have thought that Hip Hop would come and go and that it would certainly bypass jazz, but when Miles Davis’s last recorded effort Doo Bop embraced the style and legends like Clark Terry recorded with Digable Planets while Greg Osby and Russell Gunn took Hip Hop head on then you knew it was here to stay, in pop music AND in jazz.  All these musical elements, and many more, came into the mix as I created Beyond Jazz. In addition I plugged in specials programs to highlight certain aspects of the movement. They included the all-day Saturday interview special Words & Music, the one-hour focus on one artist or group called Monday with the Masters, This Is Acid Jazz, Jammin’ Jazz-Jazz For The New Generation, hosted by my associate Michelle Sammartino (more on Michelle later), the one-hour live show staged at an “imaginary modern jazz club” called Live @ BJ’s, and the all-day special If It’s Friday, This Must Be Fusion. I also created a four-hour special documentary, The History of Fusion that aired twice each year on the 4th of July and New Year’s Day. From the time
that XM Satellite Radio launched in late 2001 to 2008 when Sirius took over and did away with many of the channels and people of the original XM lineup, Beyond Jazz and yours truly included, the service attracted over 9 million subscribers. Of that number internal metrics indicated that Beyond Jazz had gathered an audience of about 400,000 regular listeners, fewer than the smooth and straight ahead jazz channels as well as the pop music channels, but still a substantial audience for what was in essence a new, never-before-heard jazz entity. And, probably most importantly, the people who loved it REALLY loved it! Those who “got it” REALLY “got it!” They loved not only hearing the artists they’d known and loved from the Fusion Era and beyond, but all the new artists they were discovering at the same time I was discovering and presenting them on the air. There were no “auditorium tests” needed here. The Beyond Jazz listener was a music lover who was hungry to learn and hear more all the time and they told me so in hundreds of emails I received and saved over the 7-year run of the channel while on XM. Plus, the ARTISTS “got it” too. They knew that for many of them this was their best outlet to get out their musical message, and for some their ONLY outlet. When we got the word that Sirius would be taking over in what was billed as a “merger of equals” but was in essence the creation of a monopoly, in total disregard for the original agreement set up by the government, I began to put the word out on the air that I was appreciative of the support the listeners had given me during the past 7 years. I began to receive urgent messages from listeners who were angry and confused about what I meant and said if I was leaving they would follow me to keep getting the music and special programs they loved. A plan to create the next phase of Beyond Jazz was in the works at that time. Early in the life of Beyond Jazz I received contact from an XM employee in the Miami office where designs of the XM units and designing of all kinds were done. Her name was Michelle Sammartino and she introduced herself by telling me she couldn’t believe there was an XM channel where she could hear the Jambands and Frank Zappa! I asked her point blank if she’d ever done on air work and if she’d be willing to volunteer to produce a show of her own creation for the channel. Though our plans were big at XM our budget for adding headcount was small if not non-existent so there was lots of volunteering going on among the channels, a testament to the strong, collegial attitude of the staff in general. Michelle had indeed been on the air in San Francisco and began to produce the weekly show Jammin’ Jazz-Jazz For The New Generation which became an instant hit! Her personal connection to the main artists in the genre from Karl Denson to Will Bernard to Skerik to Dr. Lonnie Smith to all the great artists from New Orleans to Jacob Fred Jazz Odyssey and many more was invaluable. Plus Michelle was a design and web specialist so when we were both “downsized” in the Sirius takeover we plotted to take the channel to the web as soon as we could get it together. If not for Michelle and all the hard work she did on the web side, MOJA Radio could not have been created. Though Michelle left a few years ago to pursue other work she left an indelible impression and her memory lives on in the spirit of MOJA Radio. She even returns from time to time on the air with a special presentation. While she put together the pieces for the website and continued to work on the programming of Jammin’ Jazz, I assembled the audio and technical elements we’d need to put the channel on the air. We did all the tedious work of acquiring the hardware, scheduling and automation software, setting up the streaming, web-hosting and domain name accounts, affiliate programs and social media accounts and licensing agreements with BMI, ASCAP, SESAC and Sound Exchange. Once all this was done and our business was registered as MOJA Radio LLC we were open for business, but how would be pay for all of this? I was opposed from the beginning to playing constant advertisements on the air as I wouldn’t listen to that myself. We decided to see if the folks who were so upset when XM gave up and let Sirius call the shots, would really follow us in large enough numbers as subscribers to pay the bills and give us a chance to truly create, maintain and grow “The World’s Modern Jazz Radio Channel.” The answer is that they did and we have. Folks pay about a quarter a day to hear the stream. The name MOJA is not really a flippant moniker. Yes, it is a bit of a silly anagram that is constructed from MO for MOdern and JA for JAzz but people in the past five years of the life of the channel have now come to call this blending of all these many sub-genres of jazz MOJA without any hesitation. Sometimes I’ll get together with subscriber/listeners and we’ll listen to music and say to one another…”that’s definitely MOJA” or “that’s definitely NOT MOJA!” When you live with this music you just simply KNOW. In addition to serving up the constant variety of MOJA over these five years we’ve continued to present the special programs that have become a big part of what the service is all about. A couple of years ago I was joined by an old friend from New York radio days at CD 101.9, Carolyn Bednarski, who loves the vocal side of things and now programs and presents the special show  “The New Jazz Singers with Carolyn Bednarski”  each month. One member of MOJA Nation wrote me an email once that included the following, “if citizens of America are Americans then we citizens of MOJA Nation must be MOJANS.” The name stuck and even artists like Randy Brecker calls himself a MOJAN now as he did backstage in an interview at The Blue Note not long ago.  In conclusion, I must say how proud I am of what we have created, a platform to present the work of the artists that I believe are the most creative in jazz today. I must say how inspired I am each time I read a message from one of my fellow MOJANS who tells me how they couldn’t go through a day without listening because this is “their music.” A true music lover knows the music that helps him or her define themselves TO themselves, and this is no small thing. Communicating with citizens of the MOJA Nation may be the single most fulfilling thing about doing this work for me. That is besides, of course, the fact that I get to continue my relationship with all of these brilliant, creative musical creatures who come up with the newest forms of jazz, a music that has been around for over a century and refuses to stand still, much less die! When I get a new CD or download a file that presents me with some new pianist from Eastern Europe, a new guitarist from Indonesia, a band from Sweden, a vocalist from Brazil or India, or some funky new group from Texas, a player from Chicago or San Francisco that’s doing something completely different with a horn, some musician with a new idea that I discover walking into one of New York’s many clubs then I know that when you hear talk about how jazz is dead or dying it’s coming from people who just aren’t interested or are not paying attention. I know this multi-culti, electro-acoustic, genre-bending, multi-faceted music I call MOJA is alive and well and that for five glorious years it’s been living and thriving in the home I built for it, online at MOJA Radio!

94,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/moja/to-denmark-armenia-zimbabwe-new-orleans-july-3-2014-at-the-montreal-jazz-fest/,"Tigran Hamasyan and Russ Davis at the Montreal Jazz Festival Question: How does one travel to Denmark, Armenia, Zimbabwe and New Orleans in one day and never go farther than one square mile? The answer is by attending the Montreal Jazz Festival on July 3, 2014 and have your handy festival guide in hand and your walking shoes on! On this, my third full day at the festival, I set out to get a taste of some of the international offerings at the 35th Montreal Jazz Fest, always one of my primary intentions when attending this event, and I began with a visit with three funky dudes from Denmark known as Ibrahim Electric.

Guitarist Niclas Knudsen, drummer Stefan Pasborg and organist Jeppe Tuxen have been at it for a decade now making a name for themselves in Europe for the most part. But news of their eclectic mix of funk, jazz, rock and world music has most certainly reached these shores. I had somehow found a copy of their 2006 release Absinthe a few years ago and wondered what else these guys were up to. Well, after hearing one of their two sets at the festival, their first appearance here, I now know. These guys are not just a fun-time, grooving, party band, though they certainly had heads bopping, feet tapping and booties shaking during their show, they have a wealth of styles that blend in such an inventive way there is simply no way to pigeonhole them.

The set began with a groove that would have pleased Jimmy Smith, Jack McDuff, Robert Walter or John Medeski. Just when I thought I might have them figured out the next song began with a Middle Eastern tinge that morphed into something that seemed like a theme to an imaginary spy movie. Songs followed that incorporated a bit of this and that and exhibited how many different sounds one can squeeze from a Telecaster guitar, a set of drums and a Hammond B3 organ. Can you say “inventive?” I know these guys can. I spoke with guitarist Nicklas Knudsen and got some information on the group, plus three more of their albums I’ll be sharing with you soon. Nicklas told me that they play a lot in Scandinavia but have been to North America a bit and that their main source of inspiration comes from American music from the ’60s & ’70s though he has been to Africa, is heavily influenced by the music from the continent, and also feels connected to the Euro-jazz scene by playing electric, improvised music but also dabbling in electronic music too. You’ll hear more from these guys if I have anything to say about it…and I DO…so stay tuned.

I left Niclas and Ibrahim Electric to their own devices and made my way to The Gesu Theatre for another trip to another part of the world to hear the young Armenian-born piano master Tigran Hamasyan who now goes simply by the single name Tigran. After winning the Thelonious Monk Piano Competition a few years ago he’s made such a name for himself that the Montreal Jazz Festival gave him three spot-light shows this year. He set up shop in the Gesu to play duet shows with Ambrose Akinmusire, then Brad Mehldau and on this night with his own quintet to perform the music of his latest work titled Shadow Theater. I’d spoken to Tigran at the 2011 Montreal Jazz Fest and found that his musical vision comes from a few varied sources including classic rock as well as classic jazz, the traditional music of his homeland, Armenia, which includes folk and classical traditions.

He mentioned that jazz was not a foreign sound or style to him growing up as there was a true jazz tradition in Armenia from the 1930’s and beyond. You learn something every time you talk to an artist and this was certainly something I never imagined. Tigran is creating his own tradition and exhibited this in his performance as he took the stage alone to play some solo piano with some electronic embellishments. As the piece continued he was joined by his quintet and the music developed nicely to present Tigran’s complete stylistic intent. Instead of continuous improvisation by himself and his band mates Tigran primarily established rhythmic patterns to convey the musical message in this performance. There is a modern jazz-rock timbre to the sound and it’s decidedly electro-acoustic as well. I heard a lot of classical influence too with an operatic tone that came from the vocal work of Tigran and the female member of his band. There were Eastern overtones too that obviously come from Armenian folk. Tigran is an artist that is sure to develop wonderfully and that I’m sure to follow.

I was on my way to my next stop, the beautiful Theatre Maisonneuve to hear Terence Blanchard, a great side trip would be to Africa, Zimbabwe to be specific, to hear the energetic sextet Mokoomba. These guys were playing the second of two free shows outdoors and by all accounts had become one of the sensations of the festivals many free offerings. Their blend of world-jazz coming from the Tonga rhythms of their homeland, modern hip hop, rock and blues was a pleasing mix for the festival audience who couldn’t stop moving to the groove. Their latest album, Rising Tide, was recorded in Belgium and features not only their great vocalizing and the band’s fine percussion, keyboard and guitar work but a large horn section too. If you wonder what might have inspired Hip Hop look no further than a place like Zimbabwe and a group like this one. I always seem to discover a unique African band or artist when I come to Montreal and this year it was Mokoomba.

Off to Maisonneuve I went to settle in for two sets featuring the trumpet master from New Orleans, Terence Blanchard to close out the day. Terence would perform first with his own quintet and then with L’Orchestre National de Jazz de Montreal led by their local musical treasure composer, bandleader and saxophonist Christine Jensen. Christine would be directing the Orchestra on this evening in the second set, but to begin the evening Andre Menard, the esteemed co-founder and director of the Montreal Jazz Festival for these 35 grand years took the stage to present Mr. Blanchard with the 21st Miles Davis Award. It was a touching and entertaining presentation as Terence told a personal story of how Miles had complemented him for his work and been a friend since the early 1980’s when Terence was only a young gun coming into his own. That being done, it was time for the music.

Terence and his quintet played a set primarily from his latest release Magnetic. If you came to the hall on this evening to hear “When The Saints Go Marching In” or a salute to Louis Armstrong you were in the wrong place. No traditional New Orleans music and not much straight swing would be coming in this set. There was plenty of high-level improvisation from Mr. Blanchard and most especially saxophonist Brice Winston and young Cuban-born piano discovery Fabian Almazan, but the music came from a free and dreamy place and stayed there for the most part. Terence has spent a lot of his time writing soundtracks and arranging music for large ensembles so the craft is strong for him and it seems that even with a small group the orchestration and composition is a major focus. Combine that with his awesome ability to emote via his instrument and you’ve got a real treat.

After a short break the quintet took the stage again along with the members of Montreal’s Jazz Orchestra with Ms. Jensen directing. Terence made a major point in the beginning of stating that when he began composing for film, and that was back in 1992 with the soundtrack for Malcolm X, he was sometimes told in meetings that jazz didn’t work in film soundtracks. He begged to differ and in his career, as well as on this night, went about the business of proving them wrong. He reached back into his 1999 release Jazz In Film to bring on the theme from “Taxi Driver” and other pieces. He then gave the spotlight to Christine Jensen and her large aggregation. This is indeed an Orchestra, not a jazz big band, so there was not much hint of swing to be found in the next four tunes, all written and arranged by Ms. Jensen. There was a dreamy, jazzy spirit conjured by most of the music as if the soundtrack for the film titled July 3rd at the Montreal Jazz Fest was being performed. The show ended with one last piece of evidence being presented my Mr. Blanchard to prove his case of the fact that jazz and films DO match. The performance of Duke Ellington’s “Anatomy of a Murder” was a perfectly, sweetly swinging end to the set and to a night of “jazz as high art” and to my third day at the 2014 Montreal Jazz Festival!

 In 1996, PBS interviewer Charlie Rose conducted an enlightening, and at times a racially wincing, interview; with author Albert L. Murray about jazz and the African-American experience. Murray immediately dove into an explanation that encapsulated what he feels drives art. He said, “Any aesthetic statement has to do with the basic attitude toward the experience of a given cultural configuration. In other words, a work of art is the ultimate extension, elaboration, a refinement of a survival technology” of a given culture.

Murray, a critic famous for his denunciations of overly simplistic attitudes about black and white relationships, elaborated on the importance of rituals, saying they take place in order to re-enact the survival technology to help cultural traditions survive. Many times these rituals are strictly supervised as in religion, but Murray emphasized there is also a playful aspect to these rituals, and to play one needs to combine individuality with collaboration, and “out of that playful re-enactment comes art.”

The Sunday evening jam sessions led by drummer Rob Henderson and jazz promoter Kim Tucker at the La Rose Jazz Club on Germantown Avenue in Philadelphia for the past two years are the epitome of this playful re-enactment of traditional rites of passage between the young and the old, the neophyte and the old head, the apprentice and the master, the eager and the cautious.
Henderson, a jazz drummer since 1976 who cut his musical teeth (and school) hanging out with R&B musicians in the back of a jewelry store, told me, “When Ortliebs’ JazzHaus closed down and their Sunday sessions stopped, we needed a place for young people to play and network with older players. I thought it was my time. Music has always been very good to me and I learned to play this music on the scene, not in a classroom.”

He picked La Rose because of the acoustics and for their grand piano (Ortliebs’ was infamous for its awful piano-one thing no one misses). Henderson said the place reminds him of “the days of the old union halls, like the old Clef Club,” and indeed, La Rose has that homey Philly feel to it that says, “Come on in and play.”

Kim Tucker, daughter of the late Sue Ford, a Philadelphia musician and jazz advocate, is a jazz promoter very active on the scene, and she told me that she got involved early on with the Sunday Sessions at La Rose when she “stopped in and saw how positive it was. . . I’ve been promoting it for free ever since!” (In the spirit of full disclosure, Tucker is also on the board of Jazz Bridge, a nonprofit I founded).

But Tucker and Henderson found out quickly that promotion was easy through Facebook. Tucker said that reaching out to the “the young ones,” as she calls the young players who come in with their parents, was a cinch using social media. Facebook is word of mouth on steroids and has resulted in the up-and-coming, social-media-savvy teen musicians flocking to the place. Tucker said, “They learn microphone skills, how to act on the bandstand, which tunes they have to know in the Real Book – it’s the business of music in real time.”

Many of the “young ones” come from Cheltenham High School, University of the Arts, Temple University, and the Kimmel Center and Clef Club youth jazz ensembles. Some of the standouts are 19-year-old saxophonist Dahi Divine; 16-year-old pianist Jordan Williams; 11-year-old drummer Nazir Zbo, the little brother of Philly phenom Justin Faulkner; 17-year-old bassist Bruce Ketterer (whose father drives him in from Reading, PA); drummer Ben Singer; and 17-year-old violinist Ben Sutin, whose band has appeared at Chris’ Jazz Café, one of the few remaining jazz clubs in Philadelphia. Photographers L. David Hinton and Anthony Dean make it a point to be present to document these early moments of what could be the next generation of young lions.

La Rose is an incubator for jazz babies who hunger to learn about playing music for a living, and at this special place, they learn it from the likes of Philly mainstays such as bassist Mike Boone, formerly with the Buddy Rich band; bassist Steve Beskrone, an alumnus of the Pat Martino band; pianist Orrin Evans, featured in the current issue of JazzTimes; and more importantly, celebrated drummers 86-year-old Earl Curry (who regularly played with Coleman Hawkins and Billie Holiday) and 91-year-old Charlie Rice (a veteran of Louis Jordan’s band and the Chet Baker Quartet).

La Rose is just one Chehaw Station where writer Ralph Ellison’s little man is definitely behind the stove, where art demands that you play your heart out because there is usually someone listening that knows the music. This is where jazz begins and how the tradition continues in Philadelphia. Like Albert Murray’s blues hero, the lessons learned span lifetimes; the rituals the old heads consistently teach insist that while you may not always nail every solo, you’re definitely going to go down swinging, ready to jump up and start it all again.

The La Rose Jazz Club is located at 5531 Germantown Avenue in Philadelphia, and the Sunday Sessions run from 6 – 10 p.m. The club has no website. For information, call Rob Henderson 267-231-6779.

97,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/phillyjazzjournal/alex-delcourt-new-kid-philly-block/,"Alex Delcourt (photo: Susan Medina) Who would ever have expected a young man from a tiny medieval town 10 kilometers outside of Versailles to land in the gritty center of Philly jazz? Many of us in the Quaker City would have expected nothing less after meeting Alex Delcourt, a self-taught French bassist who had James Jamerson licks burned into his brain from an early age. Delcourt attended the School of Modern Music in Paris after high school, but things didn’t really begin to click musically until he got a chance to visit Philadelphia, tagging along with a drummer friend who had a gig here. Alex bumped into one of the city’s top bassists, Steve Beskrone, when he signed up for a year-long exchange program at the University of the Arts. Within moments, Hank Mobley’s “This I Dig of You” was ringing in his head. Beskrone, a musician with a solid bio that reads like a bassist’s dream, played with the Ray Charles band early in his career (with Philly musicians Johnny Coles and Albert “Tootie” Heath in residence), Horace Silver, Pat Martino, and Philly Joe Jones. His experience—including stints with the 5th Dimension, Freda Payne, Martha Reeves and the Vandellas, and even touring with the Broadway show Dreamgirls—seemed made to order for Alex’s wide interests. “He taught me way more than lessons—everything!” Delcourt recalled breathlessly over the phone. “He knew so many different styles. Jazz, Cuban, rock. And he was so positive.” Beskrone was equally impressed: “Alex was completely all-in, no bullshit. He kicked ass. Everybody kind of rallied around him. And he loved jazz. He’s got an edge. And he’s become a fine composer.” Back in his little French town of Galluis, the young musician took Skype lessons with the master bassist and a strong connection developed between them. “It was super-direct,” said the elder bass man. “Looking at each other, we zoned in through a computer screen.” Later Steve had a gig in Paris and the two hung out, talking, listening, and playing together, and the gates of jazz wisdom and wit opened wide for this young man. In 2013, Delcourt moved back to Philly, which has been his home ever since. On his website, he says he loves the city: “When I moved to Philadelphia, I felt that I found what I was looking for: the luxury of studying with my heroes and being surrounded by so many talented musicians, each with their own unique sounds.” The minute he rolled into town, Delcourt sat in with bassist Mike Boone, who has a solid rep for mentoring young musicians, de rigueur for any aspiring bassist. Nervous he was, but Boone put him at ease, even surprising Delcourt by showing up at his apartment to give him some lessons. Delcourt is currently working on his second CD, featuring all original compositions, with trumpeter Eliot Bild, saxophonist Henry Tirse, John Swana (who plays everything, but on this CD it’s valve trombone), drummer Steve Perry, pianist Nathaniel Hawk, and guitarist Zion Fritzinger. You can catch him at the club Time on Sundays and at Chris’ Jazz Café on Monday nights. Or pick up his debut CD, The French Quarter—but please, don’t look him up in France. He’s staying in Philly.

Joining him onstage at Le Poisson Rouge (in a performance that was part of the Red Bull Music Presents concert series) were saxophonists Shabaka Hutchings, Nubya Garcia, and Josh Johnson; violist Miguel Atwood-Ferguson; harpist Brandee Younger; guitarist Jeff Parker; bassists Junius Paul and Dezron Douglas; vibraphonist Joel Ross; and percussionist Carlos Niño. Before a packed house, the ensemble played for almost two hours with hardly a break in the action. The buzz surrounding this show was so sizable, and the line outside the club so long, that many would-be concertgoers were shut out; luckily, Vincent Tullo of the Red Bull Content Pool was there to document the night in photographs, some of which are in the following slideshow.

105,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/photos/photos-fred-taylor-scholarship/,"A scholarship at Berklee College of Music was created in the name of longtime Boston concert producer Fred Taylor. On September 12, a benefit concert featuring Kurt Elling, Danilo Perez, Terri Lyne Carrington, Catherine Russell, Kat Edmonson, John Patitucci and Grace Kelly was held at the Berklee Performance Center. Kelly, along with her parents Bob Kelly and Irene Chang, organized the concert.  And it was Kelly, in tandem with one of her mentors, trumpeter/vocalist Bo Winiker, who initially proposed the scholarship to Berklee.  The concert was emceed by WBUR radio host Robin Young.  Trumpeter Jason Palmer was the musical director for the performances. Before working with Scullers until his recent dismissal from that venue, Fred Taylor had managed two of the seminal jazz clubs in the Boston area – Paul’s Mall and the Jazz Workshop – where a veritable who’s who of jazz (and rock) greats played from 1965 until 1978. Taylor also promoted the famous comeback appearance of Miles Davis back.  A lifelong champion of emerging artists, Taylor was an early supporter and advocate for artists such as Eva Cassidy, Norah Jones, Terri Lyne Carrington, Esperanza Spalding and most recently, Grace Kelly.  Spalding was among the many notable artists who contributed video tributes to Taylor.  Others included Christian McBride, Harry Connick, Jr., Steve Tyrell, Bill Charlap, Ahmad Jamal and Sean Jones. Among the speakers was Pat Metheny who shared his experiences in dealing with Fred Taylor over the years. Metheny said that when he was first playing around Boston both as a sideman with Gary Burton and as the leader of the Bright Size Life-era trio with Jaco Pastorius and Bob Moses, Taylor was encouraging and gave the trio its first real engagement with a week at the Jazz Workshop.  Metheny noted that he has been working with Taylor as a promoter ever since. During his segment of the performance at the benefit concert at Berklee, Kurt Elling said that Taylor’s greatest attribute was his faithfulness to the music. In 2015, Taylor was the first recipient of the George Wein Impresario award, presented by Berklee. According to the event program, the Fred Taylor Endowed Scholarship Fund at Berklee “is designed to nurture gifted and deserving students who are in need of financial assistance and who are studying in the area of music business/management or professional music.” All photos by Kofi Poku.

 Jimmy Haslip is perhaps best known as the bassist and founding member of the contemporary jazz band, the Yellowjackets.  In addition, he’s released several albums as a leader including Arc and Red Heat and he’s performed and recorded with a virtual who’s who of jazz and pop, including Bruce Hornsby, Pat Metheny, Bonnie Raitt, Rod Stewart, Al Jarreau, Donald Fagen and many others. However, for the last twenty or so years, Haslip has been producing a variety of artists, mostly but not exclusively within the jazz/rock genre.  Most recently, Haslip co-produced the Jeff Lorber Fusion album, as well as guitarist Dave Hill’s most recent CD.

Given his double life as musician and producer, we thought he’d be a great subject to kick off this series of interviews with producers, who do their best to bring the creative vision of artists to the fore.
 How did you make the transition from musician to producer?

It started really with the Yellowjackets. Once I got in that band, we did the first record in 1978 with Robben Ford. It really was Robben Ford’s project, but that was the first thing we all did together. That was produced by Steve Cropper. It was called The Inside Story for Elektra/Asylum. It was an interesting record and the process was great.  It was great working with Steve, who was a legendary guy at that time, and still is, for that matter.  Shortly after that, we ended up getting a separate deal with Warner Brothers.  That’s what ended up becoming the Yellowjackets and Tommy LiPuma produced that record.

I had been working on stuff in the late 70s and early 80s with a lot of different producers, from Ron Nevison to Tom Dowd and Eddy Offord and Steve Cropper.  I was always interested in how all that worked.  I kept my eyes and ears open, and listened to what people said and what people did.  I watched how the production was handled. I took a lot of mental notes during that time, never really thinking that that’s what I would lean toward later in my career, but it was just something I was interested in. I was fortunate enough to work with a lot of heavyweight producers, including Gary Katz who produced Steely Dan. At one point, he took me under his wing. I know that the 70s and 80s were an educational period of time for me to pick up on things, because I was working with really well-known producers.

What did you learn from people like Katz and Dowd?  Was it about the little things or the bigger things?

Both.  As far as the bigger message, I would say organization and having a lot of resources.  And as much as injecting ideas, making sure that you listen to the artist or the band and understanding what the direction is.  If the artist and band have a distinct direction, you honor that and listen to that. And, if they didn’t have a direction, then you really try to connect with the artist or the band and see if you can find what that direction can be. Make sure that that’s discussed and everyone is in agreement. In all cases, having  abundant resources and a list of musicians who play all different kinds of music, so that you can cast a situation, either in a traditional aspect or a non-traditional aspect.

All these things were swirling around in my head. I’ve always loved music. I got my feet wet working on Yellowjackets’ records.  The early ones were produced by Tommy LiPuma and I took a lot of notes there.  He’s a famous guy and really knows what he’s doing. At a certain point, we started producing ourselves and that laid the groundwork for me to start honing in what it was all about in producing a record.  I have to say that being in a band and at a certain point being in a self-produced band, that’s what gave me the opportunity to organize myself and understand what a producer does, from beginning to end.  From finding a studio, getting an engineer, getting the material together, determine if there are any guest musicians, and the whole etiquette of talking with other people’s managers or even lawyers.  The whole nine yards including artwork and art direction. I’ve always been into all aspects of the creative process of making a record. I grew up in the ’60s when there were albums and artwork was very important and also gathering all the credits and making sure the t’s were crossed and i’s were dotted.

Do you think that being a bassist gave you any particular advantage? 

There’s something to that. There are a lot of producers who are bassists. But I don’t think it’s mandatory [laughs]. A lot of the producers weren’t even professional musicians. I think the door is wide open to anybody that is passionate about music and has hopefully some organizational skills, although I have worked with some producers that were unorganized, but they did have some assistants. They had it together enough to understand that maybe they weren’t so organized and that they needed to hire someone to help them get organized. You have to be organized.  On top of all I’ve mentioned, there’s a budget.  You have to allocate the money and know what’s being spent and where to spend it.  In my case, I’ve always wanted to come in under budget, so that the artist doesn’t have as much to recoup or whatever money is left over goes into the artist’s pocket.  So there’s that financial side in addition to getting the musicians, engineers, studios, music, arrangements, art direction and so on.  A producer has to wear a lot of hats. In some cases, I feel like a good producer is a good multi-tasker and I happen to fit that bill.  Also, I think it’s important for the producer to have a passion for the music and also have a rounded knowledge of music. And even in my case becoming an ethnomusicologist, where I actually study music from all over the world and therefore have a sense of what’s around me and what’s available.

How do you turn off your player instinct?  The “Wait, I could play that” impulse.

I think that being so passionate about music and understanding so much about the different kinds of music helps me to take a back seat in that sense.  How many records have I listened to in my lifetime?  I’m 57, so you can imagine that’s a lot of records. I’ve listened to records with maybe not technically astute musicians, but of course they had a lot of feeling or the right sort of grease that was necessary to make the song come to life. From my perspective, it’s not all about the chops. It’s about the song, for one. And then it’s about creating the right atmosphere for that song and making that song come to life.

How do you pick a project or artist to work with? Or do the projects pick you? Producing is, after all, a real commitment on your part.

It is a very serious time commitment when you take on a project. You want to be available. My problem especially in the last five or six years is the time factor. I have been involved in a lot of projects even at the same time. Recently, I’ve almost produced like five records simultaneously. That was a challenge [laughs]. Fortunately, I was able to allot time and because I am such a multi-tasker, I can jump from one thing to another and immediately be focused on what needs to be done. I pride myself on that. I don’t necessarily want to perpetuate doing five projects simultaneously, because it is challenging and it wore me down. I was producing my solo record with Joe Vanelli as co-producer. The fact that I had some co-producers on some projects really helped me because if I wasn’t physically able to be at, say, a mixing session, I could be on the phone or get MP3s.  I had a partner in the production team. That allowed me to multiple projects all at once, including my own solo record, and a couple projects with Jeff Lorber-a Norwegian saxophonist and a Las Vegas singer.  Plus, a record by guitarist Dave Hill.  And one with Robben Ford and Michael Landau for Shrapnel.  They were all different kinds of music.  I was really running around on a hectic schedule.

How do you decide what to work with?  What if the music is great, but the person is difficult?

Fortunately that hasn’t happened yet. I have worked as a sideman with people who are demanding or unreasonable or unfocused.  I know what that could be.  That’s not something that I would really be interested in unless the music was really amazing and there was an amazing vision for the project. I might put on my helmet so to speak.

There’s another element to production and that’s psychology. You have to be a therapist on a certain level.  And I mean that in a very positive fashion.  There is an etiquette when you work with certain artists and you don’t want to start throwing things out there that would upset people.  You have to have common sense. You have to edit yourself. You might be thinking about some things that you’d like to say to someone, but you can’t voice that, because you have to keep motivation at the top of the list.  If you’re on a schedule, everything has to keep moving forward and in a positive light.

I would think being in a real band has got to help in that regard, because you are used to dealing with band dynamics.  So many bands have broken up over recording sessions gone awry.

That’s true.  Things can get hairy. Egos can get in the way. Tempers can flare. Things are said and next thing you know there’s a blowout. I’ve been in some situations, though more as an observer than participant. I was in a session once where a fistfight broke out.

Did it involve a drummer?

Actually, no.  They were co-composers, the piano player and the singer.  They were having a riff from the very beginning of the session.  We thought it would just blow over once the music started.  And it was actually the drummer and I who broke up the fight [laughs].

Now that’s a rhythm section.

We were able to cool everybody out and stop brawling, but that session was over.  That’s the only experience I’ve had like that in the thousands of sessions I’ve done. Thankfully, it’s not a common occurrence.

I was going to ask you if you were the hands-on or hands-off type, but I didn’t expect to mean it literally.

Yea, when I’m involved in something, I’m ready to go the whole nine yards with it. To be involved creatively with ideas and input into the mix of things. And help the artist as much as I can, for better or worse. Obviously, not everything I suggest might not be acceptable or might not be a great idea, but to me if someone has ideas, it’s good to voice them and put them on the table.  Even if it’s a bad idea, it still may lead to a good idea. It’s all good food for thought.

What sort of learning curve did you have?  Were you pretty well-versed in the technical aspects? Some producers like the late Tom Dowd were very knowledgeable about the technical aspects.

Yes, he was incredible. I don’t quite have that depth of knowledge for engineering. I know quite a bit about it. More than anything, I’m in touch with about a dozen really great engineers who I work well together with.  I know that I can book an engineer who I have a relationship with but also who is on a high level of professionalism and expertise.

I have done thousands of sessions, so I think at this point in time I have a good idea of what needs to be done. In fact, at one time I had to fire an engineer. This was a project I was brought in on.  I had to go to another state that I’d never worked in before with people I’d never worked with in a studio I’d never worked in before. I was a fish out of water, so to speak.  That was a challenge. The demos of this band sounded great.  But when we got into the studio, the one thing that happened was that the drummer wasn’t working out.

Hah.  I told you.  It’s always the drummer’s fault, it seems.

Well, the drums are the most important element in making a record, especially if it’s a band playing tracks live. I tried using a click track but this particular drummer had no experience playing with a click track. The click became a moot point. Then the engineer wasn’t getting sounds that I thought were acceptable. I let it go through the recording process and this was a time when drum machines were prominent. I’m a frustrated drummer and I owned a Linn drum machine and I used to enjoy programming drums. So I rented a Linn drum machine and every night I’d program two or three tunes, staying up until 5 AM.  Then I’d go in the studio the next day and lay down the drum machine information and have the band play to the drum machine. I did that for five days and four nights and got the recording done. The mixing part was becoming a disaster and I took a shot at mixing the record myself. And that’s when I realized that mixing is an art form unto itself. I had no skill at that time. I knew what a record should sound like, but I didn’t have the skill to make it happen. That’s when I realized how important it was to have a mixing engineer, if not from the inception of the record, at some point when it was time to mix a record, if I didn’t feel confident about the tracking engineer, I needed to have a mixing engineer there to take over.

Over the last ten years or so, about how many albums have you produced? 

Starting in the ’80s when I began producing Marilyn Scott records, I was also producing Yellowjackets records, I’d have to say that I’ve produced almost 70 records in the course of about 23 years.

What albums do you think you made a difference with?

I’m really proud of. my first solo record Arc,  that I co-produced  with Vince Mendoza. I actually was the one who brought in Vince, because I was a big fan of his writing. To me, the songs are the most important aspect of a record. You can have great players and terrible songs and that’s not going to work. If I can find songs from outside that will work, I’m fine with that.  The objective is to try and find really good music.

There’s another record by a guitar player by Matthew Van Doren and I oversaw the project from top to bottom. All the music and casting the musicians and creating the atmosphere of the record came from my head. Although I have to say that the artist was the composer and he wrote some great music. When he came to me, he knew he wanted to play with some great musicians but that was the bottom line. After hearing his songs, I casted the record so that it had these pockets of musicians that created certain atmosphere with three or four songs each. Because it was a guitar player’s record, at first I didn’t want to have any keyboards on it, though I eventually decided to do three of the songs as an organ trio. There were no synths, no piano, no Rhodes.  I could really frame the guitar and that would be the main chordal instrument. I’m very proud of that record.

Listening to the last Jeff Lorber record Now is the Time and hearing that group live doing “Mysterious Traveler,” I thought that particular tune seemed to have your handiwork on it.

Yes, I came up with that idea. It came up from a conversation I had with Jeff at one point just hanging out. We had just listened to bunch of music he had written. He’s a very prolific writer and arranger. So I knew he was going to have plenty of material. And he had this idea to resurrect the Jeff Lorber Fusion. He had an idea to redo some of the older catalogue, which I thought was interesting. So we were listening to a lot of the older material and picking stuff. I had my favorites, like “Water Sign,” which was always a favorite of mine, so I knew that had to be on the list one way or the other.

That was a hit of sorts at least for a fusion record at that time.

It was and it stood out.  And it was also the title track of that record. There was no argument there. He completely agreed. He had some ideas for stuff that was a little more obscure, but I remembered the songs, like “Chinese Medicinal Herbs” and “Black Ice.”  There was some stuff he had written that was new. There was one thing he played me called “Dr. Moy” and he wasn’t too sure about that. But I loved it.  We also ended up writing two or three things and there was one of them that was hitting home with us, called “Pixel.”

And he asked me about musicians and he wanted me to suggest some musicians. He was interested in Vinnie Colaiuta and I’ve had a longstanding relationship with him so I contacted him.  He came in on three days of sessions.  We also had Dave Weckl, who played on “Chinese Medicinal Herbs.”  I also brought in Jimmy Branly, who is a drummer I’ve been playing with locally in LA. He’s from Cuba and I wanted to bring that element in, plus he plays timbales and percussion. He ended up playing drums on three tunes and hand percussion on three tunes.

He played me this track that he had heard and it was by this singer named Irene Bea. She had taken the essence of one of his tunes “Rain Dance” and she wrote a lyric to it and made this really cool R&B funk tune out of it. I thought it was brilliant, so I asked if there was any chance we could get her involved. We brought her in. She ended up writing lyrics to a couple other things, including another track he had buried in his backlog of tune ideas. It was called “Sugar Free.”

Anyway, we’re sitting around one day and I don’t know how we got on the subject, but both he and I have similar tastes.

Both of you worked at record stores at a young age.  

That’s right. For some reason we start talking about Weather Report and their record Mysterious Traveler.  I always loved that record and the vibe of it.  And Jeff told me this story that when that record came out, he couldn’t get enough of it and he could play the record in the store.  He played Mysterious Traveler just about all day and by the end of the day, the manager came over to him and said, “Will you please play something else?” He was really angry at Jeff. And Jeff always remembered that.  I worked in a Sam Goody’s in Long Island and that same thing would happen. “Take that Goddamn record off and put something else on!”

I went home that night and started thinking about that record. Of course, I have that record, so I put it on.  And I thought, “Wow, how cool could this could be if we did a cover of “Mysterious Traveler”?  There is something about the song that fit the concept of Jeff’s record and also had to do with what influenced him and what influenced him to put this band together called the Jeff Lorber Fusion back in the ’70s. When I brought it up to him, I think he might have been taken aback on some level, but he was interested. We did maybe a little more on the R&B or funky side version, but I also wanted to make sure that we had that spacious atmosphere.

I knew that Jeff was really into astronomy and so am I. It’s one of my hobbies. I used to have a telescope at one point. I love reading about the planetary system.  Same with Jeff. He’s even met Stephen Hawking. I’m envious of that. He’s like a rock star in that arena.  A song like “Mysterious Traveler” fit in that way too.

As far as records to be proud of, I’m very proud of that record with Jeff Lorber.  I also got to work with Bobby Colomby, who is legendary and who produced the first record by my teacher, Jaco Pastorius. And of course, he has a seriously deep background in music and was a great drummer.

Bobby has such an energy about him.

Yes, that’s true. Looking at that Jeff Lorber record, you can see how three people can work together to make something cool out of it. Bobby brought in the Blood, Sweat & Tears horn section, which is prominent on five or six of the tunes of the record.

Who are some other producers that you look up to in some way?

I’m a big fan of Daniel Lanois. I really like Peter Gabriel’s So which is a quintessential production for him. I also love Emmylou Harris’ Wrecking Ball album that he did. I had the pleasure of being hired to play on some tracks, that never saw the light of day, but I spent a couple of days in the studio with him and an engineer.  It was just me and a drummer overdubbing on some tracks.  That drummer was Terry Bozzio.  It was for a Robbie Robertson record.

I love Tom Dowd.  I also got to work with him on several projects, as a musician. I played on some recording with Rod Stewart and this band called Blackjack featuring Michael Bolton on vocals.  It was like a corporate hard-rock band in the ’70s.  I always compared it to a version of the Raspberries. We had elements of that pop-psychedelic thing and elements of Yes.  We actually did two records. The first one was with Tom Dowd and the second was with Eddy Offord, who was another guy I admired, because I loved those Yes records.  There are probably so many more.  It’s a long list.  I’m sure George Martin would be on that list though.

About ten years ago, I made a commitment to educate myself further than what I already knew, so I could become a better producer.  As I start moving along here age-wise in my life, it’s something I feel I can do without having to travel so much and be closer to my family. It’s all making sense to me as a career direction. Right now it’s 50/50 as far as doing live performances and producing, but at some point, I’d like to change that ratio to maybe 80/20 with playing live 20% of the time and the rest spent producing.

At this point I feel qualified to do any type of music. I grew up in the ’60s which was a renaissance era for eclectic music   There were so many different types of bands and all genres were accepted.

When I interviewed Bobby McFerrin recently, he pointed to radio during the ’60s as having a formative influence on him musically. 

That created a serious foundation for anyone. In my house, it was super eclectic.  I had my brother, who was ten years older than I was, listening to hardcore jazz and classical music. And my dad was listening to Tito Puente, Celia Cruz, Ray Barretto, Mongo Santamaria  and even the Jackie Gleason Show and Mantiovanni and Stan Kenton.  Then we had an aunt who lived with us and she was into crazy pop stuff like Jerry Vale, Johnny Mathis, Connie Francis.  That was in my aunt’s room.  And I was hanging with my peers, so there was Led Zeppelin, Beatles, Stones, Jethro Tull, Grand Funk Railroad, Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, Hendrix, Cream, Sly & the Family Stone, all the Motown stuff.  You can only imagine that all this music was flying around my house, sometimes simultaneously, like a Charles Ives vibe.

I was seriously into film as a kid. There was all that film music from Capra films and all the great black and white films from the ’30s, ’40s and ’50s. I had an endless resource of material.  Once I started focusing on producing, all those elements came into play and I saw that I was qualified on some level.  I just needed to build a resume.  At first it was word of mouth, but now people are recommended to me.

Given that you were doing five records at once, that balance you sought may have been out of whack and your wife may not have seen the benefits of you not touring. 

That’s a big part of that equation-my family. I would rather just do one project at a time and have time for my family and even for myself, to recharge the batteries. ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912204969.39/warc/CC-MAIN-20190326095131-20190326121131-00505.warc.gz

 Andrew Cyrille is one of the key figures involved in the expansion of the musical tradition and innovation of composition.   He helped usher the “once” vocabulary into the “now” vernacular of the language of “jazz” and drumming.  He has significantly contributed to the evolution of art.  Mr. Cyrille’s experiences run the gambit of marches, two-feels, gospel, bebop, Philly Joes and Cecil Taylors on down to dances and synthesized improvisation.  At a soon to be age 72, he has performed-and continues to perform-with a host of musicians across the world documenting, assimilating and communicating the factors of his existence and environment through sound.  The culmination relates sound as historically valuable in the evidence and celebration of the human experience.  This interview is an attempt to look at Mr. Cyrille’s ideas about composition, improvisation and the current and future state of art.  It will be released in two installments.  Part one deals mainly with Cyrille’s experiences and the development of his playing style.  Part two will dig into the concepts which inform, affect and shape his playing and musical sensibilities.

Dominic Fragman:  Can you talk about your thought process and actual physical process regarding your path to finding your individual voice as a player?  When did the idea start in your head that you knew it was important?

Andrew Cyrille:  Well, the first thing you have to do is you have to learn some rules.  The first basic rules that I learned about playing drums were to play rudiments.  The rudiments are like vocabulary.  With the vocabulary, you make sentences.  With the sentences you make paragraphs and the paragraphs become chapters and chapters become books, etc. etc.  So, in so far as learning to conceptualize your inner person, of course, you have to have the technique.  And you need to learn about what you’re going to do with those techniques.  So, if you’re in the drum and bugle corps you play marches, you see.  It’s for parades.  Actually, this stuff comes out of the military.  I started in grade school and played in high school.  I didn’t play in any kind of marching band when I was in college because the first and second college I went to had no football team.  Grade school was just something that a gentleman named Obdulio Jansen organized.  He resuscitated a corps that had been in existence some time before at that school.   He just thought he wanted to do something for the kids and at the particular time he came through, as luck of the draw goes, I just happened to be one of those kids who joined the corps.

Therein, in and around the neighborhood of the school were other musicians who wanted to come over and help the kids.  Some of them were people who had been in the corps years before and then there were also people who were professional “jazz” musicians.  Some of the people who had come around were musicians like Willie Jones, who had been working with Lester Young.  I think he also worked with Monk.  There was Lennie McBrown, another drummer who was really very good.  I think he used to work with Paul Bley.  There was another guy named Lee Abrams.  He worked with Dinah Washington.   As a result of them being around, they told some of us kids, there’s another way to play drums too, and that had to do with playing jazz because they were into jazz.  They started talking about people like Max Roach, Art Blakey and Shadow Wilson.  Also, Max Roach used to practice around the corner from where my grade school was about a block or so away.

On occasion, after drum and bugle corps rehearsal, someone like Willie Jones or Lennie McBrown, would take us around to this studio, it wasn’t really a studio it was like a bar and grill on the first floor and Max would practice up on the second floor.  I never really saw him playing but I would hear him.  And the reason I think we couldn’t go up there was because we were too young and there could have been alcohol sold in there or something like that.  So anyway, we used to stand out there and listen to him play.  After a while, I would go over to Willie Jones’ house and I got to play as they call it, the multiple percussion set, the drum set.  That sparked an interest in me to learn how to play with my hands and feet and make these things work together the way the older guys were doing–the way that Willie would show me: and the ride beat and the left hand, independently.

I also had another little buddy.  His name was Bernard Wilkenson.  Matter of fact, his sister, Mildred, married Max.  That was Max’s first wife.  Bernard and I would practice together and since Max was around it influenced Bernard, it influenced me.  When Max was on the road or something like that, he’d still have his drums set up in the basement of the house.  Bernard and I would go practice, play with each other, compare notes, etc.

Now, at that time, I had gone to high school and I was in the high school band.  In the high school band was another musician who became noteworthy as time went on, and that was Eric Gale.  A guitar player who eventually played with this group called, Stuff.  They had made some recordings with CTI Records.  It was a pretty popular group at the time.  That was of course, after we had left high school.  But, during the time we were in high school, we used to play jobs outside of the school band.  We would play at dances, proms, etc. or whatever.  So then, we thought about trying to get at little trio together on a permanent basis to play around the neighborhood.  We found a young piano player, around our age, named Leslie Brathwaite.  He was really into jazz, too.  We began rehearsing every Saturday.  Leslie was into cats like Horace Silver and Charlie Parker so we started learning those tunes, “But Not For Me,” “Senior Blues,” “Now’s The Time,” “Night In Tunisia,” you know, those kinds of tunes, and we started to work around the neighborhood.

Around that time too, I began meeting other musicians, older musicians and finding out about things they were doing and what the music was all about, not only the musical value but the political and social situation that the music was involved with, where the music came from.  They pointed us to the past to people like Louis Armstrong, Jelly Roll Morton.  Those names would come up. They were trying to inform us about the history of what it was we were about. So, when I first left high school, I was interested in chemistry.  I went to St. John’s University and was a chemistry major.  While I was there I was still gigging at night, a lot.  I had to make a decision as to what I was going to do with my life as far as a profession and being able to make a living was concerned.  So, I couldn’t go to school, carrying 16, 17, 18 credits, studying all of that academic stuff and at the same time be out at night playing music.  So I decided I had to make a choice.  Along with the fact that the older musicians were telling us about those things I had mentioned before, they were also taking about music school.  A couple music schools that were always mentioned were Juilliard and another was the Manhattan School of Music.  So, I remember one night I was invited to play at what they called the University Talent Night at St. John’s.  What I decided was to play a drum solo.  After I played, a lot of the students came up to me and said, “Hey man, if you can play like that what are you doing here?”  So I thought about that, and Leslie and Eric were talking about how they wished they could go to a music school.  It was always a positive attitude about learning more about music.  So, I decided I would take the test for Juilliard.  I took the test and to my satisfaction and amazement, I was accepted.

The thing about Juilliard is that it was great insofar as me getting my technique together, learning about literature and the materials of music, theory, ear training.  And of course, I was in the percussion department, that’s what my major was.  I was playing snare drum–you learn on the snare drum–then there’s xylophone/marimba, timpani and you had to be proficient at each.  I would have to prepare lessons on a weekly basis for my teacher, Morris Goldenberg.  He was big time in the area of studio work and a lot of stuff like that.  I was assigned to him at Juilliard.  He was my major teacher there.  But at the same time, in school with me were people like trombonist, Grachan Moncur, alto saxophonist, Gary Bartz, Bobby Thomas, the drummer, John Gordon the trombone player who did a lot of work with Lionel Hampton, and others.  All of us were interested in playing jazz.  We had this interest to learn about what Bird, Dizzy, Monk, Mingus, Bud Powell and Max Roach and all those guys were doing.  But that was not the program at Juilliard.  Their philosophy, at least in the percussion department with Morris Goldenberg, was that he was preparing his students to work in the studio, and symphony orchestras, which is not a bad way to make a living playing music.

You know, if you make something like The Tonight Show, that kind of thing is good because you make a lot of money, it’s steady employment, you’re playing the drums, etc.  And with Morris, who basically said to me, when you go to take an audition with the Cleveland Orchestra or the Buffalo Symphony or the Denver Symphony, and they hear you do your audition stuff, they’ll say, yeah, he’s from Morris Goldenberg because we recognize whatever he’s doing and his technique.  So, he’s qualified.  Or at least I would be in contention with anybody else if I was applying for those jobs.  But my head was to be able to play jazz, that’s why I went there-to expand my consciousness as far as playing jazz is concerned.  But that’s not where their heads’ were.  So as I was studying at Juilliard, I was also working on the outside with jazz groups.  I worked with Nellie Lutcher from Lake Charles, LA.  She wasn’t necessarily a jazz person but she had been moving around in those circles.  I think she had done some stuff with Charlie Barnett, you know those kinds of people.  And in a sense, even though it was like a very good and well-crafted club act with little or no improvising, she would sing the same songs with bass and drums accompaniment every night with prescribed arrangements.  There would be a certain way I’d have to play certain things.  So, with her I learned how to play in 2/2 you know.  “COME-ON-DOWN-TO-MY-HOUSE-BABY-AIN’T-NOBODY-HOME- BUT-ME,” “Fine Brown Frame” in a swinging 1&2&1&2& . . . at different tempos.  And you had to do that.  That’s just another way of being educated in terms of how you think in certain musical situations as a drummer.  So, I was doing that.  Around that time I played with people like Illinois Jacquet as well.

Eventually, I met Mary Lou Williams and started working with her.  Then, I used to see Cecil Taylor in studios and on the scene in clubs, etc.  We would say hello to each other.  We hadn’t started working together.  But we would be like, “Hey man, how’re you doing?  What’s going on?  Yeah, well, I heard you were playing so and so!  I like what you were doing.”  We just talked about stuff like that.  There were sessions at places like Count Basie’s.  Basie had a club up in Harlem.  I think it was up on 132nd and 7th Ave.  There were a lot of clubs up there and they would have sessions.  So that’s where I would go to meet a lot of the musicians who wanted or who were into playing jazz.  People like Lou Donaldson used to come up there, trumpeter, Bill Hardman, saxophone players like George Braith and Junior Cook used to come up there to play, Bruno Carr, a drummer.  So all those guys would go up there.  There was a big mix and it had a lot to do with playing sessions.  That’s how I began to build my business as far as jazz was concerned-when you met the musicians. There was really no Jazz employment office that you could go to like Local 802 on 52nd street.  The employment office was when you would go to these sessions, guys would hear you, they’d take your number and when a job would come up they’d call you or you’d call them.  That’s how the business was built.  And it still continues that way because when we’re on the scene and we’re on the road and we see each other we take each other’s phone number, etc., and we get together.

So, what I’m saying is that, at Juilliard I was doing these things, plus I was doing the stuff at Juilliard.  Then I just decided that . . . well, my money ran out.  Then I started working in the field and I was also learning from people like Jacquet, Mary Lou Williams and Babatunde Olatunji.  I was in Olatunji’s band for a while and I learned a lot of things.  I learned a lot about playing African rhythms.  Playing with a lot of African drummers.  Not necessarily from Africa, a couple were from Africa one guy named Ladji Camara, from Guinea, and there was Olatunji from Nigeria.  We were playing African songs and at the same time, I was on the trap set in the midst of these guys playing hand drums, learning all about what they were hearing and playing and what Olatunji wanted.  So I was learning how to play a lot of the African rhythms.  In another sense, that’s where I learned another concept and the idea to give to the music what it needed from the drumming department in order for it to work.

So you experienced a lot of stuff and you were exposed starting early on to people like Max and the type of folks who were coming to the drum and bugle corps.  When were you then introduced to the concept that it was about having your own voice and developing your own thing? 

From the very beginning.  I met Philly Joe Jones when I was about 17 and I spent a lot of time with Joe.  As a matter of fact, I was really closer to Joe in a sense then I was to a lot of the people who were established in the music.  I used to see a lot of the people when I’d hang out with him.  Going to sessions with Miles, Cannonball, Coltrane all those guys right there like Bud Powell, Stan Getz.  We went to sessions with all those guys.  I used to go see Joe in a lot of places.  He’d let me sit in sometimes with the bands he had been working with.  So, I was getting a hands on experience and learning how to play that music.  But, what I’m going to say to you is that, all of the time with all of those guys-and Max too-you know, I would go to the house and we used to talk.  He was a good guy in a lot of ways.  But anyway, they all would say you have to find your own voice, you have to find your own thing.  I’ll tell you this, one time I went to hear Max play.  It was at the club in Harlem called Small’s Paradise.  Max had really played some extraordinary stuff that night, I mean he was really burning.  And so, after the set, I went over to him and I said “Max, you played everything man!  That was some out of sight stuff!”  So, he says “Nah, I didn’t play everything.”  He said “There’s still some more stuff out there.  You just gotta go out and find it.”  See, with that and the stuff like Philly Joe was telling me, you know, you don’t come out here to sound like somebody else.  If you come out here to make a contribution, you gotta make a contribution from a vantage point of what you think, you know.

Paul [Murphy] has told me pretty much the same story in a situation with you.  He was playing after you and you said the same type of thing as a response to him. 

Right.  See, and what I did was I passed what Max said to me on to him.  See, and it could have been verbatim or in some paraphrased way.  So, all of the cats, they would always tell me, Frankie Dunlop, Charlie Persip, Roy Haynes, all of those people, it’s always been:  you find something to say, to contribute.  And of course, too, another big piece of my life as far as drumming is concerned, which really contributed to my understanding of how to play drums in a way that was not in an ensemble situation, had to do with playing with dancers.  I played for dance classes I don’t know how many years and with great dancers out there doing Broadway stuff.  Like, Jamie Rogers, Michael Bennett, JoJo Smith, Claud Thompson, Herman Howell, etc.

These things all contributed to the way you played and technique supplied the command of the instrument in order to express what you thought. 

Right, yeah the concept.  And see, every time you play something, in other words if you’re speaking French you speak French, if you speak German you speak German, if you speak English you speak  English . . .

What you put in your body, comes out.  The experiences that you have from whatever playing situations and whatever “educational” thing, bandstand or otherwise, that’s what’s going to come out and what shapes your voice . . . 

Yeah, well what comes out is your ability to solve problems.  I played shows also.  I was in a group called “Voices Incorporated,” in which the majority of the musicians in the ensemble were singers.  They were like these operatic type voices.  They were singing songs about the Negro experience.  That was in the 1960’s, with the civil rights movement going on.  They were singing “Amazing Grace” and different songs like that, “Lord Knows the Trouble I’ve Seen,” gospel type tunes.  I can’t remember the names of all of them.  It was just me and a piano player, and at the beginning of every show, there would be Ladji Camara, from the Olatunji stuff.  He would open the show and then I would join him in the introduction and then the show would begin.  Just speaking about the fact that our drumming in that sense and the experiences that we had as black people in this country, generally was from Africa and of course too with the combination of European culture, and here we are, American.  The African, European and all the cultures that come to the United States make all of us who we are.  So, as a result, playing with those singers, I learned in a sense, how to play shows.

I did another show with just me and a piano player.  It was a show headlined by the actress, Kay Ballard.  The show was called the “Rise and Fall of the Entire World As Seen Through the Eyes Of Cole Porter.”  Something like that.  We were playing all these Cole Porter songs and there was a whole stage cast.  We were like the pit band.  It was just me and the piano player.  People were singing and moving.  They had these gorgeous voices and they had scenes and, of course, we had to play what was appropriate for them to characterize what it was they were about.  So, what am I saying to you?  I’m saying that all of that stuff even sometimes when it’s a show and you cannot do what you want to do, whether it be in a jazz situation where you can express yourself in the moment with whatever it is that comes to mind, you still have to learn.  You learn, you discipline yourself.  Then when you learn how to discipline yourself in one way, you can also discipline yourself and think through problems in another way.  It’s all in a sense lateral to some degree.  It all depends on how you want to do it, what you need to do in order to get to the other side, in order to get to the solution.

 Mike Clark’s skills, creativity and groove communiqué from behind the drum set have long been the catalyst for many a drummers’ funk and jazz aspirations–whether said drummers are aware of the influence or not.  Clark’s syncopated sense of time has oozed out from Oakland onto countless records and tours.  He is widely known for his work with Herbie Hancock’s Headhunters, beginning with the 1974 record, Thrust and the sounds of “Actual Proof.” Clark is now a staple on the world’s music scene.  He keeps more than busy with a variety of musically varied projects and has established himself at home and abroad as a popular jazz-drumming bandleader.

Clark’s latest project , the Headhunters’ Platinum, will be released on June 14 on the Owl Studios label and will feature the group under the leadership of Clark and Bill Summers, with contributions from Snoop Dogg, George Clinton, Killah Priest, Donald Harrison, Patrice Rushen, Rob Dixon, Derrick Gardner and Richie Goods.

*****

Dominic Fragman:  Tell me about some of the projects you have been working on recently.  You’ve been running all over the place.

Mike Clark:  I’ll give you a little background of what’s been going on lately.  I had a record out about two years ago called Blueprints of Jazz.  It’s an all acoustic, all straight-ahead jazz record–hard bop.  It features Christian Mcbride on bass, Donald Harrison on alto, Patrice Rushen on piano, Christian Scott on trumpet and Jed Levy on tenor.  It was picked by DownBeat as one of the best jazz records of the decade–of course out of a couple hundred or so, but still, I’ll roll with that!

I had it in my mind to pattern a band after something close to Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers but with a modern sensibility.  So, the recording had all the elements of 1950’s and 60’s hard bop and post bop bands.  It was really fun.  We got everything in one take and walked out.  We were done in one day. So, that was cool.

I also just did an organ record this past year for Owl Studios called Carnival Of Soul.  I wanted to address the organ thing because I did a lot of those gigs as a kid and even here in New York in my later life with cats like Brother Jack McDuff and Lonnie Smith.  My first gigs as a leader were with an organ trio.  When I was about twenty years old, I had a four night a week organ trio gig for almost four years in California and we were killin!  We played everything I wanted! It was great. So, I did a lot of playing in the organ environment and I figured, let me be honest and instead of recording what I think might be the latest thing to get airplay, let me play something that reflects who I actually am.

The record just got picked by JazzWeek Radio as one of the best of 100 for 2010.  I had some great players out for the dates.  Lenny White came out to play on a track.  We did a two drum cut for Big Sid Catlett’s “Mop-Mop” and turned it into a funk groove.  It was a lot of fun.  We called it “Catlett Outta the Bag.”  That track is also on Lenny’s new CD, Anamoly.  I had three different organ players – Jerry Z, Jeff Pittson, Delbert Bump – Rob Dixon on saxophone, Tim Ouimette on trumpet and Delbert McClinton was a special guest.  He is an old friend of mine.  He came over and did a killer rendition of “Cry Me a River.”

Between Blueprints of Jazz and Carnival of Soul, I am going back and forth trying to book both bands.

 Right.  You just went over to Russia with one of your groups.  Who did you make that trip with?

Yeah, I just got back into town not too long ago.  I went with my organ trio with Jerry Z on B3 and Rob Dixon.  Rob Dixon is a great tenor player who comes out of Indianapolis.  We toured all throughout Russia, Siberia, everywhere.

How was that? 

It was killin! We drew 600 to 1000 people per night!  It was unbelievable!  I’m a drummer for crying out loud!  People know who we are over there.  They were really into it.  They were like, “We’ve been waiting 20 years to hear you!”  I just couldn’t believe the audiences because I’m not a front man.  And we didn’t play any fusion, just all jazz. They are way into it!

We also have a new Headhunters’ CD coming out on Owl Studio’s label that is really workin’. It features Snoop Dogg, George Clinton, Killah Priest, Donald Harrison, Patrice Rushen, Rob Dixon, Derrick Gardner, Richie Goods, Bill Summers, and myself. A cross generational effort, we mixed up a lot of genres–jazz, funk, African, latin, and even hip hop on several pieces–that was fun! I wrote or collaborated on most of the tunes.  Something else I am quite excited about is my new project, a sextet I am leading, called Indigo Blue, featuring me, of course, Christian McBride, Wallace Roney, Donald Harrison, Rob Dixon, and Antonio Farao. It is acoustic, straight-ahead jazz music, New York-style. We are recording it live at The Iridium at an upcoming date July 29th through the 31st in Manhattan. So that’s kind of what’s going on and also I’ve been going to Italy to play with the amazing, Antonio Farao.  I’ve done a lot of stuff with him over there–a lot of touring. I also did a recent tour overseas with Jeff Berlin, a brilliant bass player. I also am appearing on an episode of Treme this season, the HBO series about post Katrina New Orleans with Donald Harrison and The Congo Nation.

Do you still find time to practice every day? 

No, no. I don’t get to practice every day.  I practice when I’m home.  It’s a drag because I can’t play the drums in my apartment. Now, I do shed on the pad in the crib.  Unfortunately, it’s hard with my schedule lately to get downtown and practice things where I need hand and feet coordination or stuff where I need to develop new ideas on the kit.

I know that you do practice Buddhism and meditation.  How do you think that kind of focus and mental clarity affect your practice and playing?  Does it put these things in a better or higher place for you?  

Great question.  Herbie actually taught me Buddhism and taught me to chant “Nam Myōhō Renge Kyō.”  Buddhism postulates “Nam Myōhō Renge Kyō” is the law of the universe, of cause and effect through sound and rhythm.  So in chanting for your dream, you uncover the reason you have not yet obtained it and you do what they call your Human Revolution. You start changing the parts of your inner world that are not so attractive. Basically, if the universe is a mirror of your inner world that is telling you-no matter how subtly-“I can’t,” “I’m not this enough” or “I’m not that enough” the chanting will smash that away.  The Buddha nature is nothing mystic or supernatural.  It is just the point in your life that is positive.  The point that says “Yes I can.”  Once that is a part of your foundation then yes, you can!

That is why people get these great benefits.  For example, the tune “Actual Proof.”  When we were recording that tune they were not going to let me play those beats.  They wanted me to play a really simple thing.  When I said something to the upper managements folks it only turned into an argument.  So, I took what Herbie taught me about the chant and I snuck off into another room for about twenty minutes.  It was a far out thing because I was a young guy and my prayer was . . . well, everything else for the record was already finished and in the can and fairly pedestrian, I felt.  I said, man, this is Herbie Hancock.  Everybody in the world is going to hear this.  So I chanted that I would be immortalized by this one track in jazz history.  You know, I was 25 years old!  There was no use chanting to be the regular guy who’s playing down at the pizza joint.  I wanted the whole thing!

So, I chanted and something inside of me changed.  Instead of going back out there all confrontational and meeting the guy street style, I was very polite.  I even lied to him and said, “Hey that’s a great idea but why don’t you let me try it this way.”  By doing that and complimenting his idea I disarmed him. So he let me do it.  I could play what I wanted under the condition that I got it in one take, if not we did it his way.  I said “OK.”  Now, indeed everybody knows me from that track from that moment until the day I kick the bucket!

That’s what you wanted! 

Yeah and the track was credited with a drum innovation and many drummers that I know tell me the tune was a huge part of their roots.  I mean like three generations of guys because that record was made in 1974.  I have all kinds of really great drummers-guys who I think are fantastic-I don’t even know they know me and I’ll be sitting there checking out their gig talking about how great they are and they come up to me and say “Oh man, are you Mike Clark?” And they thank me for “Actual Proof.”  I am honored and happy to be able to make that kind of contribution.  And all of it came from that Buddhist prayer.  Without that, I would have probably knuckled under and just done it the other way. That is why they entitled that track “Actual Proof” because Buddhism says you get what you chant for through inner reformation.  That is what they call actual proof: a change within you made by you.

So I chant every morning and evening.  I do focus on my drumming and music goals but also other aspects of my life.

So along with the meditation, do you assess the place where music and drumming puts you within the universe and/or how it helps the universe? 

Well, music transcends all boundaries and languages.  It’s not like when you go from country to country and you can’t speak the language any longer.  Music is a language.  Musicians have this vocabulary that we speak and speak to other people even.  I think, being that music transcends this communication hurdle, it is a super positive force for bringing people together.  You don’t have to be from the same ethnic background or anything and we can still get down and play together right away.

Music also evokes all these creative emotions, which is the thing that most people gravitate towards.  There is a lot of value there because of how it makes us feel.  Life is made up second to second of feelings: how we feel about ourselves, how we feel about others.  And, we are always trying to polish and improve our inner world so that our art will be clearer and of service to others as opposed to just being an extension of our ego.  Ego is definitely involved because no one wants to get up and sound bad.  We want to present something that we believe in and that we like.  We-musicians-are also working on this inner picture by way of practice.  That is how we hide the blemishes in our personality.  It is not dishonesty.  We are really trying to present a better picture.  If you track it down further, we are trying to present-or be-a better person.  In that aspect, it is a hell of a contribution to our society and our world.

Through music and art, musicians and artists want to bring the most positive energy and causes in the world to the forefront.  Therefore, it is a great service that we perform.  Sometimes we are not paid correctly like a lawyer or a person on Wall Street but we do have the satisfaction of knowing we are doing the right thing. There is no doubt.

You were saying earlier, you get to check out drummers playing around the city sometimes.  Who are some of your favorite players right now? 

I get hit quite a bit with this, “which one of the new drummers are you listening to or do you like?”  Here is my answer.  I don’t listen to fusion drummers or chop electric drummers.  I listen to jazz drummers.  Some of the jazz drummers I like that are in the environment playing today are Billy Hart.  Billy is one of my all time favorites.  I love his improvisation and his sense of history and his innovation.  I love what he hears and what he brings to the music.  He is a master of improvisation.  He can really handle himself in the band.  I really love how he plays.

I love Lenny White.  I’m talking about jazz not fusion.  I love Lenny in any situation but I especially love him in jazz.  He’s fascinating to listen to.  You never know what he’s going to do.  And he has the filthiest, dirtiest, nastiest swing beat I have heard since the passing of Elvin Jones.  I can’t imagine anybody who has got a deeper groove when it comes to swingin’ than Lenny White.  Unfortunately, a lot of people don’t know that about him.  They know him from fusion and that’s a damn shame because he’s really a master of jazz music.  He makes a lot of records.

I also love Al Foster.  I think Al can really swing.  He’s got great ideas.  He’s got great hands and feet. He has got great chops and I love listening to him play.  He is another one where I don’t know what is going to happen next.

Those are the guys I listen to.  When I hear everybody else, I like them.  I don’t dislike them.  I like them.  But nobody knocks me out like those guys.  And then, of course, there are the heroes that we all have from yesteryear:  Elvin, Tony, Philly Joe, Max Roach, Roy Haynes.  We don’t have to go on and name everybody.

How would you define chops? 

For me, there is a difference between chops and technique.  Technique would be the mechanics of how to play certain figures or ideas.  Chops are what a guy does in the heat of the moment right on the spot.  When I say chops, I do not mean how fast I can play or how high I can jump or any of that.  What I mean is I am functioning at my best; hearing everything in a split second; translating what I am hearing into the music and having it be musical right away. Being able to play ideas that challenge my hands and feet and at the same time have that coming through the history; coming through the music.  My chops are good when all these things are present during the hit. You know what I mean?  Like when a tenor player tells me, “man, my chops feel good,” it does not mean he is blowing a mile a minute.  It means his technique, the way he feels with his horn, the way he is laying with the band, his phrases are all there. Now, it doesn’t mean he can’t play all the fast stuff.

All these qualities are all necessary factors for development as a player in drumming and music overall–what do you think the next step in music and drumming might be?  Where or what is the new thing? 

Well . . . I have no idea.  It’s a great question.  I wish I had an answer.  Here is why I think it may be a difficult question:  the contour, the shape, the history of jazz has shifted.  A lot of the younger musicians were not alive so they did not get to hear some of the great masters play.  As a result, when you hear these newer cats play you can tell they got it off the records.  That is not their fault.  There is nowhere else to get it.  For example, Jimmy Cobb is one of the last guys left.  So, because people are only able to get the stuff from records, it sounds different now.  Changes and shifts in the perceptions of playing have developed.  These changes are also a result of record companies and their attempts–and successes–at placing and creating whoever they want to make the latest hero.  When this kind of thing happens, it doesn’t mean that the guy they pick has any history, therefore, the real history is even further diluted and the tradition slips further away.  And, when I say the tradition, I don’t mean you have to play the same phrasing like the guys fifty years ago.  I mean that somewhere in the playing the tradition, the language is alive.  Now, however, in a lot of the music where there is “swingin” the jazz lexicon and language is absent.  Therefore, it can really go anywhere.

You could have any combination where different understandings of playing can come out.  Where it used to be there was Chick Webb, then Gene Krupa, then Buddy Rich and Louie Bellson; and that is on that side of the fence.  On the other side there was Big Sid Catlett and then Max Roach then Philly Joe then Elvin and Tony. Those guys were all logical extensions of what was going to happen next.  In fact, at times, if you were paying close enough attention, you could actually predict what kind of direction things were going to go.

Now I am not saying any of this is bad!  It is just what I see.  As a result, I just don’t know what’s going to happen.  That is all I am getting at.  I mean people are trying to assimilate anything from Buddy Rich to Elvin and more because there is so much information out now with computers and YouTube.  It is not like the old days where you had to go sit with and talk to Roy Haynes or Philly Joe or Elvin to try to understand what was going on.  Now you can just go online and even find it written out.

But, you will not get that life and feel from recordings and computers.  And based on all of this I haven’t got the foggiest idea what’s up!

Any idea where you would like to see it go? 

I would like to see a creative mind that has put some time into the instrument and has also put some time into the history.  This does not mean they have to play like somebody from long ago.  There is nothing I hate more than these bebop snobs that tell you if you are not playing like 1955 that you can’t swing.  Someone needs to take them out in the ally and kick the crap out of them because that is complete b.s.  And you can quote me on that!  That’s some bullshit!  Those guys don’t even sound like the cats from the 50’s.  I played with Sonny Stitt and a lot of the guys from back in that time period.  Trust me, these guys now are very good.  It does not mean they are any better or any worse.  It means they don’t sound like the guys that invented and came from bebop.  They are trying to play a music that was happening around fifty years ago based on what they think happened. There is nothing wrong with that.  It just does not ring true in my brain.

And there is nothing wrong with that either-not ringing true in my brain! Some of it does.  However, if you are going to say that this space that I understand is the only place where there is value, then what you are doing is acting like a dog.  You are peeing on territory.  Like an old caveman: marking off the area of your expertise and claiming that to be the only area.  That kind of behavior protects you from having to compete with somebody who understands a different area.  It is really some old business that is really territorial and fear-based.

As someone who has been dubbed as such–not just by a vote or because it was written somewhere, but because people continue to approach you and tell you that you are–what does it take to be an innovator? 

Well, I do not think I have played anything that has not been played before.  I think I have rearranged what was played before me in a sensibility that worked for my brain.  So it was not that I did not carry the tradition with me, it is that I studied it.  I studied all those drummers we have talked about and more-and not just the drummers but also the bands that went before me.  So, when I came up with those things I played with Herbie, it seemed to me a logical extension of the stuff that I had listened to and studied. But, instead of playing swing, we were going to play eighth note or sixteenth note patterns-whatever that funky thing is.  So I orchestrated my understanding in that direction rather than play it the way I heard everybody else play it.

I was never examining what other cats did technically or exactly how they played their beats.  I never copied them.  I just tried to play in that direction.  There was no, right right left left foot foot stuff.  Your hands and feet will just take you there and if they don’t then you work on it.  I worked on my own kind of technique by listening to guys and then trying to play the sound or direction of whatever it was they were playing.  So then I took that information and something like what is on “Actual Proof” just poured out of me.  I do not understand how another cat feels, thinks or breathes when he sits down behind the drums.  I just know me so I have just played my stuff.  But every record and drummer I have heard has influenced me.  Paul Murphy’s drumming has influenced me.  It is all in my brain and it can come out.  I played an avant garde gig not too long ago and drew on some of the things I knew Paul does-not exactly, just in that direction.  I tried to get my bass drum moving like he does and play a lot of rolls and make things thick like he can.  Although I do not know what his sticking is, I worked to create some kind of swell inside the music like I saw Paul do many times with Jimmy Lyons.  And it worked great! Everybody liked it!

115,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/solo/essential-ellington-an-excerpt-from-a-new-biography/,"A revelation of a jazz biography, arts critic Terry Teachout’s Duke: A Life of Duke Ellington (Gotham Books) succeeds in humanizing, with brutal honesty but also great respect, an American cultural deity. Teachout, author of 2009’s Pops: A Life of Louis Armstrong, pulls from a deep well of preexisting sources to shed light on the desires and motivations, both personal and artistic, of jazz’s peerless composer and bandleader. This excerpt, taken from the book’s prologue, is a representative sample of Teachout’s no-holds-barred look at the life and work of an unknowable genius.

Though he carried himself like a prince of the realm, he was the son of a butler and the grandson of a slave. Washington, D.C., where Edward Kennedy Ellington was born in 1899, was one of America’s most segregated cities, but it also had a black middle class that was proud and self-aware. Ellington’s parents belonged to it, and their only son, a high school dropout whose regal demeanor belied his poor grades and seeming lack of interest in music, went out of his way to acquire its manners. For all his polish, it was his artistry, not his personality, that was the source of his enduring appeal. But it was the personality that made white people who might not otherwise have done so give him a second glance, and in time it opened doors of opportunity through which few other blacks had been allowed to pass.

Ellington’s surface qualities were exploited to the hilt by Irving Mills, his manager during the 1920s and ’30s. “We wanted Duke to be recognized as someone more important,” Mills told an interviewer in 1984. By this he meant that the best way to position his client in a market full of talented black bandleaders was to present him to the world as a different kind of black man, fine-spoken and expensively tailored, a fellow whom broad-minded white folks could imagine introducing to their friends, even if they might not care to bring him home to meet their wives. Accordingly, Mills’ advertising manual stressed Ellington’s presentability as much as his talent: “He is as genial as he is intelligent, always creates a good impression upon newspaper people with whom he comes in contact and invariably supplies them with good copy for their stories.” Ellington himself was happy to play the game, for he saw his public image as a contribution to the welfare of his people. “Every time you walk out [on] the street and you’re exposed to a white citizen, you know,” he said, “you’re acting in behalf of the race.” That was why he never let his guard down: He knew that there would always be somebody looking.

Over time Mills’ strategy paid off beyond either man’s wildest dreams. Long before Ellington died in 1974, he had become, after Louis Armstrong, jazz’s biggest celebrity, as well as the first jazz musician to be widely hailed as an artist of consequence-and not just by his fellow jazzmen, but also by such distinguished classical musicians as Constant Lambert, Aaron Copland and Percy Grainger. Their praise gave his work a cultural legitimacy at which no posterity-conscious black artist would have been inclined to turn up his nose. Yet he was, like Armstrong, a popular entertainer whose music was meant to please a mass audience. Long before the swing era, his band was seen in films and heard on network radio, and long after most of the other bandleaders who followed him into the limelight faded into obscurity, Ellington continued to perform on network TV and girdle the globe, playing “Sophisticated Lady,” “Mood Indigo,” “Solitude,” “I Let a Song Go Out of My Heart” and the other hits that had made him famous (if never rich). Twelve-thousand people came to his funeral at the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine in New York City, his adopted hometown and the place that he loved best. By then his baggy eyes and sardonic flattery were almost as familiar to the mourners as his music.

Underneath his soigné exterior, Ellington was a self-centered hedonist who lived a nomadic existence in which everything was subordinated to his art-and, insofar as possible, his pleasure. “What you need to do is wake up after two o’clock, make phone calls, but don’t move an inch,” he told his son, Mercer Ellington. “Just lie flat on your back and phone, and tell everybody everything that has to be done, and lay all your plans without going out anywhere. … When you come downstairs you’ll have prepared your day, and you’ll be the Greatest!” After he died, Mercer found a handwritten note among his father’s papers in which Ellington summed himself up in three lapidary sentences: “No problem. I’m easy to please. I just want to have everybody in the palm of my hand.”

116,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/solo/how-did-you-get-into-jazz/," “So you’re really into jazz?” says the man, aghast. The man, and the context, are interchangeable. Old or young, at a party or the Newport Jazz Festival, it’s the same. A positive response to this patronizing question is never evidence enough; I will be vetted for my bona fides—regardless of his credentials—until the man realizes that, given the fact I write about music professionally, there’s a good chance I know more than he does. The incredulity, though, remains: “How did you get into jazz?” Because, you see, I’m a woman—someone who at least approximately resembles, as Robert Glasper put it in a recent interview on Ethan Iverson’s Do the Math blog, a “young, fine, Euro chick.” That indelicate description was prompted by a phrase that cuts right to the heart of the matter: his idea of “women you would think never listen to jazz.” I am, for better or worse, a woman you would think never listens to jazz—a fact that’s followed me since first joining my high school’s jazz band, where I fell in love with Sonny Rollins and Ella Fitzgerald and Thelonious Monk. This is not because some facet of my person presents as uniquely anti-jazz. No, it’s because all women are women you would think never listen to jazz—at least if you’re a man. Why? Glasper proposed an answer to Iverson: “They don’t love a lot of soloing.” For that reason, he explained, he focuses on the groove, searching for what he called a “musical clitoris.” “Something is there in your music that gives them entrance to jazz,” Glasper added. “Otherwise they’d never cross paths with it.” These statements are generalizations, and as such are fundamentally, obviously inaccurate. Even without dissecting the 19th-century assumptions Glasper is operating under—that women are oversexed creatures incapable of higher thought—one should not need evidence to know that there are both prolific women soloists and fervent women jazz fans in 2017, and that these women found the music all on their own. Nevertheless, the interview prompted an online fracas, including over-offended men listing women in jazz and under-offended men (including Glasper and Iverson, among many other musicians) explaining that, well, there aren’t that many women who listen to jazz, and Glasper actually meant what he said as a compliment to women’s intuition, and if you’re so offended by him making sexy music and talking about clitorises, then why don’t you see how you like what hip-hop artists are saying these days? And with all the problems in the world, you want to talk about a jazz interview!? To that I say yes, but not because Glasper’s comments are unprecedented, or because Iverson elected to publish the interview without any sort of critical commentary. In a perverse way, I’m happy they did what they did, as regrettable as it might seem now (both Iverson and Glasper have since apologized). Now we’re talking openly about a question that usually lingers on the fringes, discussed in all-women panel sessions attended by audiences of all women: Why aren’t there more women in jazz? All it takes is a glance at one of the many Facebook threads spawned by the controversy to see that the answer lies in the dialogue itself, a circus of men and women shouting down those who raised concerns. Those men and women made self-evident what every woman who’s spent time in the jazz world already knows: Women are underrepresented in jazz not because they’re incompetent or uninterested, but because they still have to fight for acceptance, legitimacy and agency. It’s not just that comments like Glasper’s are insulting—though they are, and the hordes rushing to his defense show that he was simply saying aloud what many others in the community think. It’s that in an art form that continually struggles to find an audience, they reflect an attitude of exclusivity: Jazz is for us and it’s not for you. This tone ensures that the genre will become, if not extinct, then at least hopelessly static. Fresh ideas from people who haven’t traditionally been welcomed make up rock’s vanguard—see Alabama Shakes’ Brittany Howard, or St. Vincent—essentially saving it from critical irrelevancy. Jazz is vital right now thanks to geographical and stylistic diversity. Imagine the possibilities if women were not just tolerated but encouraged, both as performers and as listeners. For too long, jazz has been functionally exempt from the diversity mandates that permeate just about every other art form. An obvious example is the fight required for the all-male Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra to hold blind auditions long after the practice was the industry standard. But as so many other communities have proven, just putting women in the room is all it really takes to prompt a sea change. In the case of jazz, that means putting women onstage and in the recording studio. It was shocking to realize, while watching Geri Allen and Terri Lyne Carrington take a brief duet during their performance with David Murray at the 2015 NYC Winter Jazzfest, that in a decade of attending jazz shows that was the first time I’d seen a band of all women. As more male bandleaders hire women (Darcy James Argue, Jon Irabagon, Igmar Thomas), and more female instrumentalists/bandleaders get taken seriously (Mary Halvorson, Melissa Aldana, Linda May Han Oh, Matana Roberts), things are changing, albeit too slowly. More open conversation about the sexism that pervades the scene will speed things up. We’re celebrating the centennial of the first jazz recording this year, and the genre won’t break by being held accountable for excluding 50 percent of the population. Indeed, that will make jazz even stronger and better than it is now.

117,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/solo/jazz-communism-cuba/,"The author (left) embraces trumpeter James Morrison at the White House in 2016 Since its first edition, organized by UNESCO and the Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz in 2012, International Jazz Day has presented and encouraged performances and jazz-education initiatives around the globe. Each year, IJD visits a host city with a grip of the world’s best musicians, to give master classes and perform in an all-star gala concert webcast. For 2017, leading up to the official IJD date of April 30, those players and singers converged on Havana, Cuba. As experienced by JazzTimes, the long weekend was a rousing success that saw plenty of enriching collaboration between a diverse jazz A-list and the exceedingly fertile Cuban scene.  More than anything, these inspired musical interactions came off as a portent of the brilliant things to come if interests of human goodwill were able to supersede politics. Nevertheless, and not surprisingly, the event incited pushback from musicians, especially Cuban-American expats, who questioned the wisdom of rewarding a controversial government like Cuba’s with an important event that employs jazz as a metaphor for democracy and fellowship. We present here a reaction from the renowned clarinetist, saxophonist and composer Paquito D’Rivera, who, it’s worth noting, performed at last year’s IJD concert at the White House, in an ensemble featuring his former Irakere bandmate Chucho Valdés. – JazzTimes *** “I don’t like jazz,” the Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev declared in the early 1960s. “I used to think it was static when I heard it on the radio.” That anecdote, among many others, can be found in S. Frederick Starr’s passionate 1983 book, Red and Hot: The Fate of Jazz in the Soviet Union. As a result of his objections, many jazz clubs in the Soviet Union closed, and the official musicologist in the Kremlin was removed from office, to be replaced by none other than Leonid Brezhnev! In the late 1940s, when Mao captured Shanghai, the city’s musical nightlife ceased to exist, simply because the Communists considered those “decadent” nightclubs antithetical to socialism. A similar argument was made in the early 1970s by José Llanuza, the man chosen by the Cuban government to get rid of the cultural hubs they viewed as dens of iniquity. In a few words, it is obvious that the music of Armstrong, the Duke, Dizzy, Bird and Goodman has not exactly been the favorite choice of extreme-Left dictators. And that is why I want to extend my gratitude to Herbie Hancock, Quincy Jones, Esperanza Spalding, Antonio Sanchez, Marcus Miller, Regina Carter and others for having brought a bit of music and joy to my impoverished native city of Havana for International Jazz Day—even if it could only mean a small Band-Aid applied to the profound and infected wound that Cuba has suffered during almost six decades of tropical communism. Still, I must confess I was glad to know that jazz—a musical genre for which musicians and music lovers of my generation suffered attacks, censorship and persecution—was present in the streets of (what is left of) Havana. A friend, almost in tears, told me over the phone that she saw Spalding play in a small bar while Quincy listened. Thanks to contemporary technology—much of it unavailable to the regular Cubans on the island—I was able to enjoy excerpts of the concert webcast, and saw that the interaction between local artists and visiting foreigners reached inspiring levels of excitement. The opening Afro-Cuban chant by vocalist-percussionist Oscar Valdés brought back memories of my younger days in Irakere, and the energetic rendition of “Manteca” was very touching, as was the beautifully articulated and constructed solo by Chilean tenor saxophonist Melissa Aldana on a swingin’ “There’s a Boat Dat’s Leavin’ Soon for New York” with Kurt Elling. It was very refreshing to see the multitalented Bobby Carcassés improvise with Esperanza, who also backed the extraordinary Youn Sun Nah on a unique version of “Bésame Mucho.” The ineffable Richard Bona brought a note of humor with his unique African version of “Bilongo,” and Ivan Lins reminded us about the huge contribution of Brazilians to the jazz language. And what about that impressive parade of great pianists of all ages, from Roberto Fonseca, Harold López-Nussa and John Beasley to Herbie, Chucho Valdés, Gonzalo Rubalcaba and many more? In other words, I have no doubt that UNESCO and the Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz put together a really great show in Havana. On the other hand, one could argue that celebrating music that represents democracy like no other, in a country that hasn’t held truly free elections in well over half a century, is a contradiction: a detail that did not prevent Irina Bokova—director-general of UNESCO and for a long time a member of the Bulgarian Communist Party—from using words such as “freedom” and “human rights” in her opening speech. So the music was great, in stark contrast to some inexplicable statements about peace, tolerance, unity, dignity and respect for the beliefs of others. And it was surreal to hear words of thanks for the hospitality provided by an illegitimate, dictatorial and intolerant government that for over half a century has divided Cuban families (mine included), starved its people and glorified subversion and war around the world while brutally silencing, incarcerating and oppressing those at home who disagree with its tyrannical regime. Nevertheless, I reiterate my friendship with and admiration for the musicians, and thank once again all my free colleagues from around the globe for their good intentions in my long-suffering homeland. Sadly, as that old proverb states, “The road to hell is paved with good intentions.” ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912203438.69/warc/CC-MAIN-20190324103739-20190324125739-00426.warc.gz

 Jazz is alive, and will never die.

Jazz is a unique American art form that affirms the noblest aspirations of our nation – individualism, discipline, perseverance, innovation…

As jazz saxophonist Charlie “Bird” Parker said, “Music is your own experience, your thoughts, your wisdom.  If you don’t live it, it won’t come out of your horn.”

Jazz has produced some of America’s leading artists and ranks as one of our greatest exports to the world.

With its’ international popularity, jazz music has become a universal language that brings people of all races, ages and backgrounds together.

I am one of those people.

As President of the US Conference of Mayors, and Mayor of my hometown, I am in a position to promote and expand the reach of jazz music in our cities, schools and neighborhoods.
 USCM

The first Jazz Appreciation Month celebration in the United States was held in April 2001, and organized by the curator of the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of American History.

Schools, organizations and governments big & small celebrate Jazz Appreciation Month with events ranging from free concerts to educational programs.

In 2008, my first year as Mayor of Philadelphia, the US Conference of Mayors adopted its first resolution calling for Mayors across the country to celebrate Jazz Appreciation Day.

USCM has continued to play an important role promoting the cultural sector as an economic driver for our national economy.

For those that aren’t familiar: the US Conference of Mayors is the official non-partisan organization of cities with populations of 30,000 or more.

Almost 1,300 American cities are represented in the Conference, and I have been proud to serve as the Conference’s President since June 2012. Cities and their metro areas represent more than 90% of the national GDP – and the creative sector is a large chunk of those cities’ economies.

In Philadelphia, we released a report in 2012 showing that more than 6% of our local economy is directly or indirectly linked with Arts & Culture, making it the 4th largest employment sector behind education, health care and retail.

That’s roughly 1 in every 15 jobs supporting the Creative Economy in Philadelphia – nearly 50,000.

Last spring – May 2012 – the US Conference of Mayors hosted the first city-focused World Cultural Economic Forum in New Orleans.

Mayors and cultural officials from more than 50 cities or countries from around the world attended to exchange ideas, build partnerships and shape the discussion on culture as an effective tool to spur innovation and economic growth.

Culture is about the heart and soul of a city, but the creative sector is about more than that.  It’s about real, tangible jobs and increased quality of life for residents – people want to live in places that have thriving creative & performing arts to enjoy. I’d like to recognize Mayor Landrieu of New Orleans, Chair of the USCM Committee on Tourism, Arts, Parks, Entertainment and Sports for his leadership on this issue.

The city of New Orleans plays an important role in our Nation’s cultural offerings – probably most notably through its central role in the history of jazz.

And while New Orleans is one of the most famous ‘jazz cities’, there are certainly many others.

Almost every major city in the America and around the world has some type of jazz festival, and there are hundreds of smaller towns that host events as well, some that you might not expect like:

–	Birmingham, Alabama
–	Davenport, Iowa
–	Burlington, Vermont
–	Reading, Pennsylvania

… along with all the ones we all know like Chicago, Detroit, New York, Los Angeles & Monterey, California, Montreal, and Newport, Rhode Island.

In addition to adding to the cultural life of the city, these festivals are huge economic growth generators adding millions of dollars to local economies through hotel rooms, meals, night-life and transportation providers.

Jazz is celebrated in every state in the nation and in almost every nation around the world.

I’m proud that Philadelphia has its own rich jazz tradition.  Let me tell you a little bit about it…
 Philadelphia 

For the first time in 2011, I designated April as Jazz Appreciation Month and signed a proclamation declaring April 11, 2011 “Jazz Day” in the City of Philadelphia.

The history of music in Philly runs the gamut – from South Philadelphia jazz legends Joe Venuti and Eddie Lang, to Gamble & Huff’s Philly International Records and the ‘Sound of Philadelphia’, to names known around the world as jazz pioneers and today’s working musicians:

Ethel Waters, the Heath Brothers, Billie Holiday, Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Rice, Stan Getz, Grover Washington Jr., Shirley Scott, Kevin Eubanks, Orrin Evans and of course, John Coltrane.

Last year, I had the honor of standing in front of John Coltrane’s house in the Strawberry Mansion section of the city to declare April ‘Jazz Appreciation Month’ in Philadelphia for the second time as Mayor.

I look forward to doing it this year, and every year that I am Mayor – not just because I love jazz, but because I know how important it is to our city and to our collective identity as Americans. Philadelphia’s jazz scene at the beginning of the 20th century developed like almost every other city’s scene – in the predominately African-American neighborhoods and clubs.

In Philly, that meant places along Columbia Avenue in North Philadelphia [re-named for civil rights activist Cecil B. Moore] and clubs like the Clef Club of Jazz and Performing Arts and Pep’s in South Philadelphia.

In 1970, Philadelphia become the home of Sun Ra’s band, which then helped lay the groundwork for the 80’s and 90’s and into the new millennium.

Today, Philadelphia still has places where you can hear great like Chris’ Jazz Café in Center City – which features nightly shows – and Relish in West Oak Lane, but we have far fewer than we used to.

We need to work to rebuild appreciation of jazz and promote innovate presentations of jazz music to build the audiences that clubs need to survive.

We also have a thriving jazz radio station – WRTI – sponsored by Temple University.  It’s hosts have included notables such as Bob Perkins [BP with the GM on RTI!] and late, great Harrison Ridley Jr. Bringing the jazz community together

Philadelphia has taken steps in the last few years to promote our heritage and preserve the art-form for future generations.

In 2010, the Philadelphia Jazz Coalition was formed to help promote Philadelphia’s celebration of Jazz Month in 2011.

The Coalition came together as an organization dedicated to the future of jazz in our city.

The members of the Coalition are caring, dedicated professionals hoping to address issues faced by jazz artists and producers across the board.

Issues like too few employment opportunities, low compensation for the opportunities that are available, lack of unity and cooperation among club owners and the musical community, and dwindling funding for music education programs.

And like the jazz community at large, the Coalition can come together to address these issues for the benefit of the future of jazz. Just like in the early days of the genre, jazz has the ability to bring us together and cause controversy at the same time.

In the 1920’s, jazz drew patrons – black and white – to illegal speakeasies and the clubs in urban areas.  At one time, jazz represented a threat to the moral order of America, according to some commentators.

Today, it is revered as the uniquely American art-form and appreciated the world over.  It is studied in universities and heard in concert halls once reserved for European classics.

Let us reflect upon that remarkable transformation to guide us in dealing with the challenges we face in preserving jazz music in the modern world.

Always evolving, jazz continues to transform itself as new musicians experiment with the sounds to express themselves and tell their unique stories – from stride and swing, to be-bop and cool jazz, the music has evolved. In the new millennium, jazz musicians have more options and more influences than ever before.  They are compelled to wrestle with new questions about musical crossover and integration.

But just as it always has, jazz will continue to reflect the moods and diversity of our nation – a melting pot genre for a melting pot society.

It has stood the test of time because it has been open and accessible to everyone. And regardless of where we fall on the spectrum, we all agree that the biggest challenge jazz music faces is remaining relevant.

In an economy where music programs are cut in schools and the popular music on the radio changes almost every day, jazz education is worth investing in.

Music and art must become standard parts of the school curriculum, like math, English & science, in every school in America.

Jazz music won’t endure unless young people pick up the torch.  It is our responsibility to teach them to love it.
 Looking forward – jazz education & promotion

In Philadelphia, many institutions offer jazz programs to talented students:

–	The Kimmel Center Youth Jazz Ensemble

–	Temple University Boyer School of Music’s Jazz Studies Program

–	Settlement Music School offers jazz classes

–	University of the Arts School of Music

–	Maplewood Music Studio in Germantown

–	The Clef Club’s jazz education program… and many more

In addition to these private institutions, the School District of Philadelphia is working hard to give every student a quality education that includes music instruction and appreciation in this difficult economy.

2013 marks the 15th year for the School District’s annual Jazz Fest.  Students in our high schools prepare for several months in advance of the festival.

The School District has recently expanded instrumental music programs in more high schools hoping to encourage even more students to participate.

Students play the music of Sonny Rollins, James Peterik, Dizzy Gillespie, Chant Ray Bryant, Victor Lopez, Lionel Hampton, Duke Ellington, and Shawn Carter among others. In 2012, the District hosted a week of concerts for students, performed by students visiting from the Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz.

	I know that one of my fellow presenters – Tom Carter – is with the Monk Institute.

Philadelphia students in five schools received master classes from Monk Institute members during their visit to Philadelphia.

One of those Institute members – Philadelphia’s own Christian McBride – was given a great surprise when he reunited with one of his childhood instrumental music teachers who was listening in the audience.

This teacher, Margie Keefe, is still teaching and mentoring students in our city after more than 35 years of service.

It is teachers like Margie that helped make Philadelphia’s jazz scene great.

Almost all of the musicians I mentioned earlier who claim Philadelphia as their hometown studied music in our schools.

Working with the School District and our Superintendent Dr. Bill Hite, I will do all that I can to protect these vital programs.

Conclusion

In closing, I’d like to share an excerpt of a poem: “Trumpet Player: 52nd Street” by Langston Hughes, a graduate of Lincoln University in Chester County, Pennsylvania.

The Negro
With the trumpet at his lips
Has dark moons of weariness
Beneath his eyes
Where the smoldering memory
Of slave ships
Blazed to the crack of whips
About his thighs…

The music
From the trumpet at his lips
Is honey
Mixed with fire.
The rhythm
From the trumpet at his lips
Is ecstasy
Distilled from old desire…

Although I think this poem speaks for itself, it reminds me of the reason we all love jazz and what has brought us together today.

Jazz is fire-y, spontaneous, riveting music that speaks to our souls.

We must do all that we can to sustain, nourish, preserve and promote the unique history and tradition of jazz in America.

Let me say it again, “Jazz is alive and will never die” – because we won’t let it! ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912205597.84/warc/CC-MAIN-20190326160044-20190326182044-00183.warc.gz

121,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/solo/t-j-english-latin-jazz/,"T.J. English (photo by Ilya Yamasaki) Back when I drove a taxi in New York City, in the mid-1980s, the cabs had not yet been outfitted with air conditioning. In the spring and summer, I left the windows open to create cross-ventilation. That meant that the noise from the street was a constant presence, an orchestral cacophony dominated by honking horns, sirens, jackhammers and music. The music that pierced through all the other sounds and soothed my urban soul was Latin-jazz. I had come from the West Coast and grown up on a mushy amalgam of mostly soft rock and whatever else was being played on local radio stations—music concocted by one corporate entity (the record companies) and peddled to another (radio stations that were often owned in part by those same corporations). American teenagers listened to what they were fed, and I was no different. Eventually, as I began developing my own tastes, I gravitated toward soul music, blues and R&B. By the time I was in my late teens, I had discovered jazz. When I was 22, I arrived in New York with a burning desire for the cutting edge—new cuisines, new languages, new sounds. By then I had cultivated a deep appreciation of jazz in all its many forms, though jazz was not exactly flourishing commercially. If you were a lover of this music, you had to seek it out. At a used record store, I came across a double album from Verve Records entitled Afro-Cuban Jazz. It included the seminal live recordings of Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker, along with Chico O’Farrill and Machito, playing the Afro-Cuban Suite, the Manteca Suite and other early masterpieces of what would eventually be called Latin-jazz. The music was recorded in the late 1940s and early 1950s; the double album was released in 1977, with insightful liner notes by Bob Blumenthal and a gorgeous cover design complete with watercolor illustrations by José Reyes. The packaging was seductive, and the music was a revelation. Gillespie, O’Farrill and many others took the tonal complexity of bebop and mixed it with lush orchestral arrangements and elements of Cuban folk and roots music. The results were a revolution as sonically profound as rock and roll or hip-hop. By the time I was driving a taxi, what I was hearing emanating from the streets was a new variation. Forms and styles from Puerto Rico and other Caribbean locales had taken the music on an evolutionary ride from bebop to a place of greater emphasis on the Latin side of things, utilizing not only Afro-Cuban rhythms such as son and guaguancó but also bomba and plena from Puerto Rico, cumbia and tango from South America and a host of other influences from el barrio. I was fortunate that my emerging love of the music happened to coincide with Salsa Meets Jazz, the legendary concert series at the Village Gate. Initiated by the club’s owner, Art D’Lugoff, the series took place every Monday night and continued from the ’70s until the club abruptly closed its doors in 1994. It was at the Village Gate that I saw many of the great practitioners of Latin-jazz, including Mongo Santamaria, Tito Puente and Ray Barretto. I vividly remember hearing Dizzy Gillespie play a searing version of “Manteca” on trumpet; I remember hearing pianist Eddie Palmieri play his compositions “Chocolate Ice Cream” and “Café.” I remember seeing and hearing the inimitable saxophonist and clarinetist Paquito D’Rivera, not long after he first defected from Cuba and settled in the U.S. I also saw the Fort Apache Band, led by two brothers from the Bronx, conguero and trumpeter Jerry Gonzalez and bassist Andy Gonzalez, as they brought the music to a new generation of players and listeners. Thanks to Salsa Meets Jazz, my love of the music deepened, and through the viewing of live performances at the Gate and elsewhere, it became a living, breathing thing. This love affair continued as I left cab driving behind and became immersed in my career as a journalist and writer of books. My writings about organized crime and the criminal underworld were informed by my love of Latin-jazz. The music was sultry, insinuating and sometimes dangerous; for me, it had come up from dark alleyways, and it reflected the romance and sensuality of urban landscapes from Havana and Miami to New York. Imagine, then, the sheer pleasure of my being contracted to write a book on the legendary era of the Mob in Cuba during the 1950s (Havana Nocturne: How the Mob Owned Cuba … And Then Lost It to the Revolution, released in 2008). On research trips to Havana, I soaked up the sights and sounds of a city that has contributed invaluably to the evolution of Latin-jazz. It was there that Pérez Prado turned the mambo into an international craze, while composer-conductors Mario Bauzá and Machito, along with the singer Graciela, adapted Afro-Cuban rhythms to the syncopation of jazz from the States. In 1950s Havana the seeds were planted for all that would come, and to explore this musical history was part of an ongoing seduction that was as sweet as any late-night assignation I had known. It continues to be an enduring passion, one that found fertile soil during the research and writing of my new book, The Corporation: An Epic Story of the Cuban American Underworld. In subject and tone, it is a sequel to Havana Nocturne. Set in the nightclubs, restaurants and back alleys of barrios in Union City, N.J., New York and Miami, the soundtrack for this story, in my mind and over my home-office streaming devices, is a greatest hits of Latin-jazz. Recently, Charles Carlini, who books groups at Zinc Bar, a club in the Village, asked if I would be willing to curate and host a Latin-jazz series at the club. He knew of my love for the music and thought that it might make an interesting tie-in with the release of my new book. Zinc is located a block away from the old Village Gate. I get to choose the musicians from among some of the best practitioners of contemporary Latin-jazz, to be showcased at the club every other Thursday. It began in April and, if the series proves successful, will continue indefinitely. Calling on a lifetime of appreciation for the music, this assignment is a dream come true. Latin-jazz and the musicians who play it have added incalculable joy to my existence. The music has provided solace and cultural enlightenment. I have explored its roots and felt the excitement and inventiveness of those who breathe new life into this tradition. Music can be as essential to the writing process as breathing or thinking. Long stretches of isolation can weaken the soul, and music may be the writer’s sole companion. Listening to and feeling the music can provide peace of mind, or inspiration, but sometimes the writer’s connection to the music can be even more expansive. Music is an expression of the soul, both for those playing it and those listening. If the musicianship is highly skilled and soulful, and the appreciation on the part of the listener is informed and profound, it is a cosmic relationship. T.J. English is the author of eight nonfiction books, including Havana Nocturne, The Westies and The Savage City. His latest book, The Corporation: An Epic Story of the Cuban American Underworld, was published this year by William Morrow. The music series “Dangerous Rhythms: T.J. English and His Latin Jazz Explosion” takes place every other Thursday night at Zinc Bar (82 W. 3rd Street in Manhattan).

122,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/solo/the-creative-imperative-and-font-music/,"Trumpeter Dave Douglas speaks at the Jazz Connect Conference, Saint Peter's Church, NYC, January 2016 I’m here to talk about the Festival of New Trumpet Music, which is an annual festival held here in New York. I helped co-found the festival in 2002 with the trumpeter Roy Campbell, Jr. We were at the bar of a club called Tonic. Surprisingly enough, as so many things do, it happened over a couple drinks.

To talk about FONT Music (which is how it’s become known) I have to talk about the creative imperative-it’s the driving force behind what we do at FONT Music. And my experiences learning jazz are a big part of learning about music in general, learning about the world, learning how to be a good citizen, and learning about creativity.

I was born an improviser. My first grade class and my teacher Mrs. Holt knew that. I was great on the “creative” aspects of reading. I was not so hot on the actual “technical aspects” of reading. We’d get small reading assignments, and she’d ask us to explain what we had read to the class. Of course, I didn’t know how to read… I would just make stuff up. Sometimes long stories that I’m sure made no sense at all and were much longer than the actual reading itself. She would just nod and say, “Well done.”

Pretty soon she opened an early morning “reading club” to which I was invited. I never felt my stories were “wrong,” more that they were “creative” and that was OK. And, yes, thank you, I did learn how to read.

But you might know that a little bit later, at Berklee College of Music, I had some major challenges on the trumpet. I had interesting musical ideas and I was trying to execute them, but to be honest my technical trumpet playing was pretty sad. And I had a teacher who, after the whole year of lessons, told me I should just quit and do something else. It was pretty rough.

I didn’t quit. I did transfer out of his studio.

In retrospect, I wish that teacher had been more like Mrs. Holt: accepting my challenges, appreciating my work-around, and conspiring to figure out a way forward-by encouraging my creativity!

I’m still figuring the whole trumpet thing out. But a few years later I did end up touring with Horace Silver. And a lot of things Horace said really stuck with me. One of them was when he said, “You young cats got the wrong message from Coltrane!”

He was talking about creativity. He was talking about us “young cats” trying to fit as many notes as we could over each chord and playing as complex as we could all the time. What Horace valued was how to get from one chord to the next, voice leading. He wanted the lines to be smooth, sleek, smart. He wanted the emotional content to come through in the creativity with which we constructed our lines. He wanted us to sound Hip. Hipness, along with Funk, were the ultimate goals for Horace Silver.

It’s why when I listen to emerging players today, and to colleagues, and to great pioneering masters, I’m always careful to valorize the creative innovations in the music. When I don’t understand the music I’m even more careful. At The Festival of New Trumpet Music we are especially attuned to the creative imperative behind the music, encouraging people to express themselves through their own creative impulses.

FONT Music tries to present everything, regardless of genre, style, or approach. We’re especially eager to overthrow our own biases. We trust the artists to define excellence in their own terms.

The festival has developed into a wide-ranging community of artists, volunteers and specialized curators, representing a multiplicity of views. And our mission is focused on seeking out and encouraging the creative impulse in music.

For that reason I would ask everyone to welcome new, creative, and unique attributes in music. Please don’t listen for how new music does not fit your expectations, but have an open mind to accept that artists need to go to entirely new places.

Listening and accepting with an open mind is crucial. You never know where new music is going to come from. It’s why the creative imperative is so important and drives us year after year at FONT Music.

Jazz is a great progressive tradition. It’s why we celebrate the legacy of Louis Armstrong, Bix Beiderbecke, Lester Young, Mary Lou Williams, Roy Eldridge, Billy Holiday, Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker, Clifford Brown, Lee Morgan, Gil Evans, Bill Evans, John Coltrane, Booker Little, Eric Dolphy, Mal Waldron, Joe Henderson, Woody Shaw, Carla Bley, Lester Bowie, Paul Bley, Wadada Leo Smith, Kenny Wheeler, Baikida Carroll, Bobby Bradford, and so many, many others.

We can only aspire to be as open and creative as all these great artists. It’s why we’re here. ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912203991.44/warc/CC-MAIN-20190325133117-20190325155117-00434.warc.gz
123,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/solo/westward-expansion-monterey-at-50/,"When it comes to jazz legacy, that oft-used and misused l-word, the Monterey Jazz Festival has an unusually bountiful supply. That fact rang clearly in the cool late-night air of the Monterey Fairgrounds arena on the closing Sunday night of its 50th annual festival in September. Sonny Rollins, one of many artists here who were present at the inaugural 1958 festival, served up one of his robust performances, capping off a stellar musical weekend. Earlier that evening, alumni from festival number one included Monterey regular Dave Brubeck, with fellow first-festival visitor Jim Hall sitting in.

Elsewhere during the weekend, the ’58 reunion guest list included vocalist Ernestine Anderson and vibraphonist Buddy Montgomery, who revisited the festival where he and his brothers, guitar legend Wes and bassist Monk, launched their career with the group called the Mastersounds.

More disarming on the list of ’58 visitors was Ornette Coleman, who had been on a bill with Ben Webster and Coleman Hawkins here, just before he headed to NYC and stunned and awakened the jazz world. Coleman’s set on Sunday afternoon in the arena was an ecstatic festival moment, even though the timing seemed strange, his loose and liberated sound following the tight, polished sound of youthful big bands. Coleman’s current three-bass project, despite the seeming oddity of instrumentation, has an uncanny ability to touch listeners, and beyond just the diehard Ornette-philes.

For the record, this set had a stronger impact than Ornette’s appearance with the electric Prime Time in 1994. That billing came soon after current director Tim Jackson took the reins, and vastly upped the then-staggering festival’s artistic credibility.

While it claims status as the world’s oldest continuously running jazz festival, Monterey was not the first. Festival founders Jimmy Lyons and sagacious scribe Ralph Steadman lifted the idea from Newport and transplanted it westward to the sprawling and agreeably rustic (or loveably funky) Monterey County Fairgrounds. Newport broke its continuity over the years, but Monterey has prevailed, and various European festivals followed in its shadow beginning in the early ’60s.

Personally speaking, the Monterey festival has had a strong emotional pull for me, as a fellow ’58 baby. For Californian jazz lovers, there is the matter of regional, proprietary pride casting a glow over Monterey, clearly the best in the west. Other West Coast festivals have distinguished themselves, including the mighty-though drawn-out and tourist-unfriendly-San Francisco Jazz Festival, celebrating its 25th anniversary this year. Seattle’s Earshot Festival and the Portland Jazz Festival have demonstrated venturesome programming, and the Vancouver Jazz Festival belongs in the upper echelon of the international festival circuit.

But Monterey is a beast of its own devising, with tricky, broad parameters and a surprising success rate, especially in the Jacksonian years. When I started making the pilgrimage to Monterey in the mid-’80s, the festival’s musical integrity was sagging. Then, it verged on irrelevancy, at least as an indicator of the myriad facets which make up jazz’s diversity and richness. That changed with the baton passing to Jackson, who has managed the feat of balancing multiple constituencies of audience tastes and the festival’s own heritage, while also carefully folding in sounds from jazz’s cutting edges.

This year’s festival opened with a respectful nod to the recently belated Joe Zawinul, as Zawinul’s “In a Silent Way” and “Walk Tall” kicked off the set by the Anthony Wilson Nonet. The irony is that Zawinul felt the chill of Monterey’s indifference for years. His classic band Weather Report never played here, an omission that seems almost culturally criminal. Zawinul finally showed up with the Zawinul Syndicate in 1998, and brandished a defiant, chest-thumping bravado as he faced the crowd at set’s end, standing tall while the curtain closed on him.

Too little mention was made this year of the passing of Max Roach, who had last visited here in ’94 with his innovative percussion group M’Boom. Drummer Benny Barth did pay respects to the great, dedicating “Hot House” to Roach.

As for the festival’s most poignant set, the honor goes to artist-in-residence Terence Blanchard’s “A Tale of God’s Will (Requiem for Katrina),” with a chamber orchestra fleshing out the eloquent sonic banquet of Blanchard’s tribute to his battered, proud hometown.

Veteran L.A.-based big-band leader Gerald Wilson, who first played Monterey in 1963, has been commissioned to write special pieces for the festival. This year’s theme-and-variations model, “Monterey Moods,” is similar to 1997’s “Theme for Monterey.” In this case, Wilson comes from different arrangemental/compositional angles on a simple 10-measure theme, with accents designed to accommodate the mantra “Mon-ter-ey.” Needless to say, boosterist spirit was in the air, and more than usual, at this 50th bash.

One of Monterey’s most celebrated boosters is jazz-loving director-actor Clint Eastwood, also a longtime neighbor. This year, Eastwood was given an honorary degree from the Berklee College of Music in a mock-academic ceremony onstage on Saturday night. Diana Krall gave him his degree and a kiss, and Eastwood shrugged, “I think the only reason they gave me this is because I know the difference between an A sharp and a B flat.” Eastwood also shared a panel discussion with independent-minded director John Sayles, on the subject of music-film liaisons and attitudes.

Life continues boldly after 50 for Monterey, now in a forward-looking and outreach-minded phase. They’re launching a new record label, issuing both archival recordings and new projects, and the Monterey festival brand goes on tour with both the ongoing Next Generation Jazz Orchestra and the road-ready Monterey 50th Anniversary All-Stars, featuring Blanchard, James Moody, Benny Green and Nnenna Freelon, coming soon to a city near you.

For this habitual festgoer’s money, the highlights of the 50th party came on the first night, unseasonable downpour notwithstanding. Opening the arena roster was a remarkable quartet assembled and commissioned for the occasion, with Chris Potter, Dave Holland, Gonzalo Rubalcaba and Eric Harland. On evocative, ink-still-wet originals, they played with the elusive, magical blend of exploration and assurance that represents this festival at its finest.

Later that night, around midnight in the Coffeehouse Gallery, keyboardist Craig Taborn issued some of the freshest piano-trio notions from either side of the Mississippi. Hearing both these projects, the clearly imparted message was that in the best jazz, of whatever era or stylistic badge, legacy mixes in with the living, breathing creative impulse.

 Every year around this time, some brave soul gets it into their head to jump the gun on holiday spirit and sends us their Christmas album for review.  Call it chutzpah or call it premature excitement. Or maybe just call it careful planning. After all, last year I did a story on singer Krisanthi Pappas who was the first artist in 2009 to send us a holiday album, in July, no less.  This year Charles Xavier didn’t get his album Xmas Vibe to us until early August, but nonetheless his was the first holiday album pitched to us and so he gets a story out of it.  Fair is fair.

Perhaps the timing has something to do with geography. Xavier, a vibes player who originally hails from the New England area, now finds himself in the Bay area where snow is a rare commodity.  And with the often cold summers on San Francisco, maybe he just got his seasons confused. Xavier says that is was merely expedience at work. “I just thought to get it to everybody early, knowing that print magazines and digital outlets have different deadlines,” Xavier explains.  “But it is cold today. I’m wearing a coat.”

And given how long he’s been working on this album, you can’t blame him for wanting to get it out there. “I first started the album in October 2005, when I did four songs,” he says. “At that point, it had piano, vibes and drums. I did all the instruments myself.  Then every year, I added a couple more songs.  In 2008, I decided to add the guitarist to all the songs, and add some balance with sampling and new technology.”

He did find that it helped to work on the material when he was in a holiday sort of mood. “I like to work on it before Christmas and put out a version for that year.  The final version, withl all the additions, was finished probably in May.”

The material is a combination of the traditional and non-traditional, including trance-like versions of John Lennon’s “Happy Xmas (The War is Over)” and the classic “God Rest Ye Merry Gentleman.”  And on the last song, “O Christmas Tree,” the vocals sound a bit like Tom Waits or Captain Beefheart, which frankly suits me fine.  What was the method to the madness of his picking tunes for the album? “They were just songs that rung out and I enjoyed listening to all my life,” Xavier explains. “And I thought they would work well with the mallets and the guitars. They’re not the happy-go-lucky thing but more of a melodic, yearning, creative, eclectic and abstract sound. I wanted a George Winston meets Vince Guaraldi meets Gary Burton soundscape to the holiday favorites.”

It certainly is atmospheric music and not your typical soloing-over-chord-changes jazz arrangements.  And unlike most holiday albums, the music is almost mournful. Xavier confirms that this was an intentional outcome. “I wanted it to be soothing, relaxing and reflective.”  He goes on to tell a story about the impact of the music. “I have a friend whose brother was sick. And they said that the music helped during that time because so much of Christmas music is so happy and upbeat that it can be hard to hear in that state of mind.” Xavier is not exactly a household name and although this project is deserving of a wider audience, you have to wonder how he can reach people given both the glut of holiday releases and the demise of brick and mortar record stores.  He tells me that he’s put together a team, with sales & marketing handled by Steffen Franz of Independent Distribution Company (IDC), West Coast promotion by Chris Buttner of PRthatRocks, East Coast promotion by Ginny Shea of Mixed Media, and social media by Todd Tate of 5thBeatle.net.  “We’ll be setting up some in-store performances at record stores on both coasts. And getting live gigs at clubs.  That’s my job contacting the club owners and promoters for bookings. I look forward to performing on the East Coast for two weeks.”

Who are some of his favorites?  “Some of mine include Christmas music from Louis Armstrong and Vince Guaraldi. George Winston’s holiday albums are very interesting and very soothing.  Phil Spector put out a Christmas album that’s hard to find.” I concur. In fact, Darlene Love and Ronnie Spector’s version of “Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree” is tentatively slated for the Mergner family’s holiday CD.

I explain to Xavier that I do a holiday mix CD in lieu of a Christmas card or one of those self-aggrandizing newsletters and that as the first holiday album received at the JT offices, he’ll get a spot on my low-fi production that has distribution handled by the U.S. Postal Service with an audience in the low three figures. Royalties or mechanical rights have to be waived though. Xavier laughs and says, “It would be an honor to be included. I’m really happy with the way it came out, when I added all those sounds – like the guitar, glockenspiel, choir, etc.”

Xavier confesses that he missed the winter season of New England. “It can be very magical. It makes the holidays feel so great when you’re out there.  That Christmas spirit.”

Xavier also plans on recording a non-holiday album soon for release in 2011. “It’s going to be a New Age or contemporary jazz session with a trio or quartet, sort of Cal Tjader meets electronica, mixing Latin jazz influences with the modern electronic sounds that are out there these days.”  The tentative title for that project is Bosco, named for Xavier’s Newfoundland dog, a breed known for its gentle nature.

 Dan Hicks digs Christmas tunes.  But it took him over 30 years in the music business to get around to doing his own album of holiday music. The singer/songwriter/guitarist and leader of the Hot Licks, a swinging band with a cult following in the rock world going back to the ’70s, has just released Crazy for Christmas on Surfdog Records and is on his way around the country on a tour he calls “Holidaze in Hicksville”.  The group will perform at a mix of theaters, clubs and coffeehouses, including the Barns at Wolf Trap in Vienna, Va., the City Winery in New York City and McCabe’s Guitar Shop in Santa Monica, Calif.

Talking via phone from his home in Marin County, California, Hicks says that he’s always done Christmas tunes during that time of year with his band, the Hot Licks. “I’ve been doing Christmas songs with the Hot Licks for a couple of decades. We did about eight or ten tunes, but we didn’t do them all at once.  We’ve been doing shows we call Holidaze in Hicksville.  We have a canvas backdrop with a cartoon scene of Christmas.”

During the holiday season, he also moonlights with a local group called the Christmas Jug Band. “It’s a group of professional guys that play once a year and we’ve been doing that since the late ’70s,” Hicks explains. That’s really where I got started doing the Christmas tunes. I think the first one I did is ‘Somebody Stole My Santa Suit.’ We started out with parodies and rewrites.  We’ve done about five albums through the years. It started out as vinyl, then cassette and later CDs.”

There are several of those parodies and rewrites on this album including “Santa Got a Choo-Choo” which uses the melody of “Choo Choo Ch’Boogie”  and “Christmas Morning” with new holiday lyrics for Hicks’ own “Where’s the Money.”  In addition, he covers a few Christmas classics, such as Steve Allen’s “Cool Yule,” made famous by Louis Armstrong, and “Here Comes Santa Claus.”   “There are a bunch of those that fit my style,” says Hicks. “I also try to make my style go into Christmas songs.”   Sure enough, Hicks’ rendition of “Run Rudolph” is a great example of refashioning a holiday song associated with a particular artist (in this case, Chuck Berry) and giving it the Hicks treatment, an easy-going swing style along the lines of Slim Gaillard or Leon Redbone, with warmth, humor and perhaps a touch of irony.

One tricky problem with Christmas albums is that in order to be released in time for the holidays they have to be recorded at a less than wintry time of year. Hicks says that he recorded Crazy for Christmas in April, but he didn’t find it too hard to get into the right state of mind for the material. “I knew the subject matter and I knew what we had to do,” says Hicks. “It was more like music, you know, rather than talking about Christmas.”  He also says that it may have helped that he started working on the album right after Christmas, doing arrangements and pre-production.  “Maybe it was still Christmas for me,” he adds.

Those arrangements feature your basic swing jazz band instrumentation (guitar, piano, bass and drums) with one noticeable addition: the kazoo.  Hicks chuckles when asked about the inclusion of that populist and often scorned instrument. “I swore once that the kazoo would never be on my bandstand,” he says. “But somehow the two girls doing kazoos makes it.  Now I got the kazoo every now and then with that ‘kazoo duo,’ but hardly ever a kazoo alone.  The kazoo is a staple of the jug band so I hear enough of it with that band. I hear enough, period.  Who doesn’t?  You never hear it and it’s still enough.”  Given that pronouncement, can he think of anything particularly positive to recommend the kazoo? He thinks for a moment. “It’s sort of like singing, though more like falsetto for a guy.  You can scat on it and get musical ideas going. You can play it like an instrument and take a solo.  That’s a plus.”

The kazoos are played by his back-up singers, the Lickettes, who are accomplished jazz singers in their own right: Daria and Roberta Donnay. Singing harmonies and counter melodies, the two provide an important complement to Hicks’ often idiosyncratic lead vocals.  Pre-bebop era jazz may be the foundation of the group’s sound, but Hicks himself has much broader interests. “Well, I’m glad to be talking with a jazz magazine,” he says, “because I’ve always wanted to be a jazz guy. I also do standards with a group called Bayside Jazz.  I was a jazz drummer way back in my history.”

The Hot Licks group is doing about a dozen shows on this tour, from Rhode Island to California.  That’s a whole lot of Christmas, but Hicks says he finds the shows work best if they’re not all painted in red and green, so to speak. “I’m going to sprinkle the set with Christmas stuff,” he says. “I always do the songs that are associated with me, ‘I Scare Myself’ or ‘How Can I Miss You When You Won’t Go Away?’ or ‘Canned Music.’  I couldn’t take it either if I had to do the whole night of Christmas music.”

For his own Christmas celebration when he returns home, Hicks admits that he doesn’t do anything particularly different from any of us.  “I’ll go over on Christmas day to my wife’s parents’ house. Most of my Christmas is wrapped up in the music, but I give presents to a couple of close people.  I send out a postcard every year to about 200 people. I either do a collage or graphic design drawing. For the last few years, I’ve been doing a takeoff on the word jumble that you see in newspapers.”  But no falsely modest yet boastful newsletter, right?  “No, I don’t do that. No newsletter like-‘Patty spent a year in Afghanistan and almost got arrested. Whew, that was close. She’s now at MIT.  Boy, are we proud.’ No, thanks.”

Hicks says that he has a few of his own holiday music favorites, including Charles Brown’s Christmas album [the singer/pianist, not the cartoon character] and a Django-style gypsy guitar Xmas CD.  He also confesses to owning the Chipmunks Christmas album.  He mentions one obscure album by an artist with whom he shares some sensibility. “I’ve got one by Harry the Hipster Gibson,” Hicks says.  “It features a lot of him singing just by himself.”

Speaking of hipsters, I tell Hicks about Armstrong’s reading of “Twas the Night Before Christmas,” said to be one of Pops’ last recordings, in the hopes that Hicks might consider working his magic with that piece. After all, with his languorous and sonorous voice, Hicks would be a perfect narrator for such a piece.  In the meantime, audiences can check out the Hot Licks getting Santa-fied at the shows listed below.  And we can all hope that that we won’t have to wait another thirty years for the followup to Crazy for Christmas.

 Pianist and singer Eliane Elias has always incorporated her Brazilian roots into her music.  Born in Sao Paulo, Brazil, Elias came to the US in 1981 and was soon working with the fusion band Steps Ahead.  She thereafter began her solo career as a jazz pianist, combining Brazilian music with improvisational jazz.  During that career spanning almost three decades, she’s also recorded and performed the music of Bill Evans and even classical composers.  Since 1984, Elias has recorded over 20 albums and established herself as an accomplished jazz pianist and increasingly as a singer.

The singing is front and center on her new album Light My Fire, which features an all-star supporting cast including Gilberto Gil, Romero Lubambo, Oscar Castro-Neves and Randy Brecker, as well as her husband and long-time collaborator, bassist Marc Johnson. The breezy and sensual album features Elias singing (and playing) originals, classic Brazilian compositions and some interesting covers, including Stevie Wonder’s “My Cherie Amour” and the title song by Jim Morrison and the Doors.

Elias talked with JazzTimes about the new album and how she has adapted to being a singer as well as pianist.

*****

B>JT: Many people view you as a jazz pianist who recently started singing, but in fact looking back at your career, you’ve always sung.

Eliane Elias:  The first time I did a record that had a lot of vocals was my very first one called Amanda which I recorded with Randy Brecker around 1984.  After that I did a lot of vocalese, but I never really wanted to pursue a career as a singer. I used my voice as an instrument, as a color doing parts. I did that for several years. When I did the Sings Jobim album that was all about singing, but I was in the mindset that the piano should be in front of the voice.  So if you listen to the mix of the record, the voice is mixed a little under or a little back, because I was not comfortable with the idea of the voice being in front of the piano. That record did very well. Even before that, I had done maybe one or two songs on every album where I sang. Then I went to RCA Victor, and they asked me to do a special project for them, because everybody seemed to like my singing. Live I usually would sing one or two songs in a set. In 1989, I did a ballad called “Don’t Ever Go Away” on Plays Jobim. The reason I sang on that is that I was showing Eddie Gomez and Jack DeJohnette how the tune went and I was singing it to them.  And they were saying, “You’ve got to sing on the record.”  And I said, “Okay, I’ll sing but let’s do the instrumental version and I’ll do a little singing on it.”  But that little arrangement became something that several music schools started using as an example of how to sing a ballad.  I couldn’t quite get my mind around it. Now I understand that they were looking for interpretation or a way of telling the story.  I ended up being asked to do a record and the executive producers told me, kind of joking, “Look, we’re going to tie your hands behind the piano bench this time. Don’t play…we want you to sing. Would you do that?”  So I had my few conditions, which were that I wanted to do Bossa Nova and I’d like to have a little orchestra like Joao Gilberto has done.  And I did the one record, called Dreamer, in 2003.

The record did so well.  It was my best-selling record, so I was faced with going out to sing and play.  So I started to do a lot of that live. It started becoming comfortable and personal for me.  Since that time, every record I’ve done as a leader has had a lot of vocals with the exception of the Bill Evans record [Something For You] that has maybe five out of 12 songs with vocals.  I actually enjoy it now and I feel bringing in the singing has opened up a whole new horizon with things I can do.  I have so many things now I want to do. It’s great in terms of adding another instrument and figuring out what can be done with that. It’s a whole new horizon that has opened up for me.

Nat King Cole had a similar experience where his vocals caught on and he ceased being known as a piano player who sang a little and became a singer who played piano too.  Nat had such a distinctive voice and I think that’s something that is very important for an instrumentalist who is also going to sing.  Or for any successful artist, really; having your own sound and your own voice.

Do you think your phrasing as a singer is similar to your phrasing as a pianist?  It’s hard for me to be the judge. But as a musician singing, I know that it’s very musical and I am very comfortable rhythmically, first of all being Brazilian and having that facility playing around my singing.  It’s the musician in me that is singing.

Are you like BB King who can’t easily play his guitar while singing?  I do a lot of playing with singing live-doubling the voice with the piano.  The two really became very independent. I have moments where I play and don’t sing. And moments where I sing and don’t play. And lots of moments where I accompany myself.

Going into that sort of unconscious zone is what most instrumentalists want to do, so maybe singing has helped you with that.  Maybe, because it has happened so effortlessly. The only [problem] is that the piano has such a wide range of notes when you’re soloing.  I don’t have such a big range with my voice [laughs].  But I can do a lot within my range.

Do you find yourself treating your body and voice differently now that you’re singing a lot? Singers have to be almost phobic about temperature and sickness and so on, because their instrument is in their throat.  I can go on and on about that-about dressing, eating, preparing and so on.  You really have to protect yourself.  When I was only playing, if I was tired or sick, I could still perform fine.  But when you’re singing, it’s so different as far as preparation. The soundcheck has to be this many hours before the performance.  I have to eat so many hours before the performance. And then there’s the kind of food I should eat.  I have certain way to warm up and I have to start the concert at most one hour after I warm up. Sometimes I’m bothering everybody in the car on the way to the gig, because I’m doing my [vocal] exercises. I barely know what it’s like to go out without a scarf now.

No wonder so many singers end up being divas!  I’m very easy-going and I’m the most down-to-earth person, but now I have to be obsessed about air-conditioning and temperature and everything. So I’m not so easy any more. And don’t eat this and don’t drink that.  It’s a trip. Some singers have the type of instrument that they can do anything before a show and still be great.  Not me. I have to include a workout to keep my stamina and strength up.

This vocal preparation was all new to you.  How did you learn to do it right?  Some of it I learned unfortunately by experience. I’ll give you an example.  I have a home in East Hampton and I love going outside and going for a walk.  I can’t now at this time of the year, because, with the pollen, I’ll get laryngitis.

 This album gave you a chance to sing with Gilberto Gil who I assume was a favorite of yours growing up.  And your voices blend so well together.  Yes, he has such a beautiful voice that blends so beautifully.  This whole record was so joyful to make.  It had and continues to have a life of its own.  The recording was natural and organic. Even what happened with Gilberto Gil was like that. A few weeks before the recording session, I had all this material ready to go and I knew what I wanted to do. There was a particular tune called “Samba Maracatu” that I really felt should have a male voice to do a duet. I had sent two or three e-mails to Gil’s management, but I didn’t hear back, so I was going to give up on the idea.  With one more effort,  I tried calling him from an old listing I had in my address book.  He answered the call. He was in the studio and he stopped everything.  He was so excited about it.

I had this tune that I wrote [in 1988] with Gonzagaguinha [who died in 1991]. He is the son of Luiz Gonzaga who was the creator of baião, the rhythm [sings] cha-kane, chi-ki-ki-cho, cha-kane.  That rhythm you hear when someone like Chick Corea plays more Brazilian. Gonzagaguinha’s father was the greatest influence in Gilberto Gil’s music. So when I brought up to him that I’d like to do this tune, he was totally into it.  Then I told him I was doing another song of his called “Toda Menina Baiana”, and we’re singing together over the phone and finding out keys.  So we’re both excited to do it . At that point, I asked him, “How are we going to do this?”  Because he’s in Brazil and I have the studio reserved for the recording for four days in October. Deep inside, I wasn’t very happy with the idea of doing it via overdubs and sending files back and forth, trying to make it sound together, because I really like being together in the moment with the musicians.  He said, “No, we’ll do it.”  I said, “But how?”  He said, “I’m going to be in New York.”  And I said, “When are you going to be in New York?”  He said, “Well, I have a concert in Princeton on October 16 and then I’m going to visit my daughter in New York City on October 17 through 20.”  The exact time I had booked the studio.  I thought, “This was meant to be.”  I had him come in on the 20th.  I quickly brought in these other tunes into the project, because I knew he was going to be in New York during that time. It was such a great experience. I know Gil for decades now.  I was in New York when we first met, but we have been together in tribute concerts, we did a cut together for Special Olympics, and I did musical direction for his Avery Fisher concert.  But this is the first time we were singing together, because with the other things, I was playing.

You also had Oscar Castro-Neves play guitar on the album. I have no words that can describe the way Oscar plays.  He plays this music so beautifully, with a lot of heart, a lot of beauty and such rhythm, to the point where I feel so comfortable not touching the piano and letting him have it.

There can sometimes be a clash with piano and guitar. Our rhythm empathy is so great with the same feel.  We get together before the recording session where we go over the harmonies and the voicings.  And there’s no clashing at all.  It was wonderful to have him play with us.  And we also have Romero Lubambo on guitar. He’s a beautiful player.  He did two tunes-“Take Five” and “What About the Heart (Bate Bate).”  And we added electric guitar by Ross Traut who is a very soulful player.  He played so beautifully on “Light My Fire.”  And Randy [Brecker] played great on “Take Five.”  And Marc Johnson, I can talk about him for 15 minutes, not just because he’s my husband [laughs].  He’s always been a player who goes so deeply into the interplay. But somehow through the years, he’s absorbed so much of the Brazilian music that he takes care of the rhythm business, too. I don’t know of a Brazilian player who could do what he does.  His virtuosity, his intonation, his taste… We work great together; he produces with me and we choose material together.  It’s really a fun collaboration.

The album certainly is a family affair. Your ex [Randy Brecker] sits in, your current husband [Marc Johnson] is the bassist and your daughter [Amanda Elias Brecker] sings. First, how do you manage working with someone with whom you’re also living?  We get along great.  We love the same things.  We live of course for each other, but also for the music. It’s fantastic because even as kids, though we grew up so far apart, our  musical influences and sensibilities are very similar. Our instruments go so well together.  And we do things that people think we must have rehearsed, but it’s just our interplay.  And we’re best friends. Marc and I have been together for 20 years, but it’s more like we’ve been together for 85 years, because most couples have their separate jobs and their lives and they see each other in the evenings or on the weekends.  But we are together 24/7.  We have two computers side by side, we travel together, we cook together.  It takes people who are sensitive and considerate to each other.  It may not work for everyone, but it works wonderfully for us. Next month we’re mixing Marc’s new record for ECM Records. It’s a beauty.  It’s the two of us with Joey Baron, and Joe Lovano plays on a few of the tunes too.  It’s all instrumental and all original, and it’s totally different than Light My Fire.  It’s like another side of us.  But, again, we do it together.  If I was married to a drummer [laughs], it might not work so well.  If he was a Brazilian drummer, and I wanted to do a straight-ahead thing, I’d probably prefer to have someone like Jack DeJohnette. And same thing if I was married to an American jazz drummer, I’d want a Brazilian drummer for my Brazilian projects. But Marc is special in doing both.

What led you to do the cover of the Doors tune “Light My Fire”?  That song was an international hit.  It was a hit in Brazil too. I heard both the Doors version and Jose Feliciano’s version.  And I heard Julie London’s version too.  It was a tune I thought with the right project, it would be great to do.  I thought that it could be a sexy, cool, slow thing-just the way we did it.

You also did “Take Five” a tune that it seems so many people have done, but you did something very different with it. Yes, it’s an iconic tune.  I feel very happy with what we did with it. First, it has a Brazilian groove to it.  But also, in place of the traditional ‘blowing section’ I created a whole new section for the tune and so it goes to a whole different place.  The original version has that solo [by Paul Desmond] and then that great drum solo from Joe Morello.   I replaced that soloing idea with a new interlude. It brings a different color to the tune.  It’s the only tune I’m doing with vocalese.  And I sing with Randy [on trumpet] as if we’re two instruments playing together.  Randy has a Brazilian heart.  He’s such an amazing player.  He’s always incorporated that Brazilian music into what he’s done.

It also speaks well of both of you that, as ex-spouses, you can still find the beauty in one another’s playing and can work together as you’ve done. 

We’re friends.  He’s a wonderful person.  We live very close to each other. It was so great to bring up our daughter this way, remaining friends and neighbors. It’s so important.

Your daughter Amanda Elias Brecker sings on this record, but it’s not the first time she’s done that.  How young was she when she first appeared on one of your records?  The very first one she was eight years old. It’s a recording called Fantasia.  She sang so beautifully.  We were all in tears.  It was that beautiful Milton Nascimento song “Ponta de Areia.” I remember when Milton heard it, he was in tears as well.  He called me to say that it was the most beautiful version he ever heard. Later she did a live performance with him. She’s doing her own thing now.  Her third CD comes out on June 18th.  She’s a singer-songwriter, with Brazilian, folk and pop influences.  She writes with the keyboards or guitar.  Her first two records have several originals.  This third one is a tribute to James Taylor and Carole King. It was produced by Jessie Harris.  It featured a lot of players who worked with James Taylor-Larry Goldings on piano, Anthony Wilson on guitar, Russ Kunkel on drums.  She’ll be doing a tour of Japan.  She has a beautiful voice with great intonation and rhythm.

You also did a Stevie Wonder tune-“My Cherie Amour.”  Jazz people generally love his songs. Yes, I love Stevie’s tunes. In fact, I recorded two of Stevie’s songs before.  One was “Bird of Beauty” for a Motown tribute for Blue Note. The other is “Superwoman” for my Bossa Nova Stories record.  This one just felt right.  Stevie’s songs always have a nice harmony and melody and they go so well with a Brazilian or Bossa Nova feel.  We also have a bonus track with a French language version of the tune that came out real nice.

You sing in both Portuguese and English. Portuguese seems like such a musical language.  How do you decide whether to sing in either language? It is a musical language. There are lots of vowels and the consonants are so soft-sounding. It’s a very pleasant sound to the ear. But if a tune has a lyric in English…
When I’m writing the song and lyrics myself, like for example with “What About the Heart?” the song that closes the record, I have English lyrics and Portuguese lyrics. It’s just a choice, but ultimately I like the way the Portuguese one sounded. When an American song is written in English or a Brazilian song is written in Portuguese, I’ll just keep the lyrics as they are.

Do you ever translate lyrics from Portuguese to English? No.  I have done an Ivan Lins tune that has English lyrics.  And Jobim has a song with lyrics by Gene Lees. But I prefer to keep the original lyric in its language.

Who produced the album?  It’s smooth without being slick and overly commercial.  It sounds produced but not overly so.  It sounds like the musicians are playing together. I produced it myself, with Marc Johnson and Steve Rodby co-producing.  I always produce my own records.  Every solo is played the way you heard.  We don’t go back and redo solos. That’s the spirit that people can hear in the music-how organic it is.

It’s the sort of thing that people think would be easy to do, but it actually can be hard. For us, it’s easy.  As far as playing a tune from beginning to end, it takes preparation.  It starts with picking the tunes and doing the arrangements and carefully considering the colors we want to add.  That architecture of the tune is done in advance. They’re great players, so when they’re presented with all of that, they take it from there.  We don’t want to do a lot of overdubbing.  This is not a jazz record.  It’s a Brazilian record, with moments of improvisation and colors and textures.  It’s not the sort of record that we just say, “Let’s count it off and see what happens.”

Probably because of the economics of the record industry, we don’t see as many well-crafted records these days, but this album does have a crafted quality and the preparation you did shows. Thank you.  If I don’t present something well, it’s all on me.  I will always do my best to bring the music at a level that I’m proud and happy as an artist, but also something that will touch people.  Something that they will want to listen to, that they will feel it.  Whether they want to drive with it, listen at home, or be romantic with it or have it at a party.  I want to bring something to everyone. *****

Here’s a video about the making of the album:

 As the son of noted jazz saxophonist Arnie Lawrence, you might think that Erik Lawrence was raised with a mouthpiece in place of a pacifier, but the saxophonist and co-leader of the Honey Ear Trio says that his father waited at least a few years before indoctrinating him and his siblings into the world of music and jazz. “There were four kids in our family,” explains Lawrence, “and when each one of us turned 5, he had this little curved soprano saxophone and he’d teach us how to play the saxophone, like other kids would be taught how to play ball or ride a bike.  I just stuck with it.” Lawrence’s sister, Marya, is a working jazz singer living in New York City, and his two other siblings also play music, though not professionally.

The saxophonist indeed stuck with it.  As one-third of the cooperative Honey Ear Trio, along with bassist Rene Hart and drummer Allison Miller, Lawrence is attempting to reinvent the saxophone trio format while holding down a chair in the horn section of drummer Levon Helm’s band. Lawrence has been playing with Helm for several years-in the studio, on the road and at home in Helm’s unique combination of house concert and R&B revue at his barn in Woodstock, N.Y.  It’s a balancing act that the 49-year-old saxophonist takes on with a passion nurtured by a supportive musical family.

His Father’s Son

Lawrence says that despite that early introduction and his father’s reputation as a jazz educator, much of his musical learning was on his own. “My dad was a real natural musician,” says Lawrence. “When he taught me how to play, he put the horn in my mouth and he taught me how to blow the notes and what the notes were.  And then he said, ‘Go play what you feel.’  I’ve always done that.  I just assumed that’s what you did. Over the course of time, I did learn how to play the right notes, if there are such things.”

Nonetheless, there were some lessons to be learned from a father immersed in the jazz scene. “The greatest learning I [received] from him was the influence. I was always around the music. I have pictures of me sitting on Clark Terry’s lap when I was 8 years old.  My dad does have a reputation of being a great teacher, but I think my learning was different because I was the only one in my family who wasn’t natural at picking up an instrument.  It didn’t come that easily to me. I think that was frustrating to him.  It made me all the more determined, especially because my brother, who was a couple of years younger than me, was so talented.  I didn’t want him to be better than me.  I was aware of what I was supposed to hear – the bassline, the chords, the time and the melody – and I just set about to learning how to do it. I would say that I was self-taught and that I was a perfect example of a student of my father’s.  I think he was frustrated that things didn’t come naturally to me that he didn’t really know how to teach me.  But I got there through determination. I don’t think I would be a musician otherwise if I didn’t have to work hard at it.”

Talented offspring aside, perhaps Arnie Lawrence’s greatest legacy in modern jazz is the steady stream of gifted jazz players from Israel.  Back in 1997, the senior Lawrence started the International Center for Creative Music in Jerusalem.  He was dedicated to not only bringing jazz to Israel, but also to bringing Israeli jazz musicians to the U.S. scene.  Although Lawrence died in 2005, his son is often reminded of the impact of his father’s work as a veritable pied piper of jazz in the Middle East.  “Israel has always turned out really fine musicians – both classical and jazz and folk. They’re great technicians and theorists.  What he brought it was that he started a school teaching improvised music. He just taught people to improvise and on a very high level.  I would say that most of the great Israeli-born jazz musicians came out of that tradition.  I don’t think a month goes by where I don’t hear from somebody on Facebook or at a club, where they give me a hug because I’m family. It used to be [older] guys in the jazz clubs greeting me and hugging me because of my dad, now it’s Israeli kids.”

Honey Ear Trio

For his part, Lawrence is most excited about the Honey Ear Trio, whose debut album Steampunk Serenade was released last week on the Foxhaven label.  The members of the group have been playing in various configurations for the last five to six years.  “Basically, every time we had a situation to play together, we would.  We have a natural and wonderful synergy and I think it’s based on a really interesting chemistry where we trade off on the traditional roles with time, chords and melody.  There’s a certain trust there.  There’s one tune where the bass player [Rene Hart] plays the melody and there are certain tunes where we’re very liquid with the rhythm feel.”

The legacy of the trio format of saxophone, bass and drums, sans a chordal instrument, is a powerful and heavy one that Lawrence is acutely aware of.  “I’ve been playing in the trio format ever since I heard Sonny Rollins’ Live at the Village Vanguard and every other sax trio recording.  I love the freedom of it.  But in some ways it’s more challenging and more structured than playing with a chordal player or another horn player, because you have to be defined and certain about where you’re going and how you’re going to complete your thoughts or how you’re going to tie them together.  This album is really interesting because we’ve introduced electronics and sampling, and that becomes another player in the band. “

Although he sees the Honey Ear Trio as more than a saxophone trio, Lawrence is true connoisseur of that sub-genre.  “There is a Dewey Redman album, Tarik, with Ed Blackwell and Malachi Favors that I love.  And the Joe Henderson ones are favorites of mine.  Sonny influenced me that way.  I’m not primarily a tenor player, though on this record I played mostly tenor.  But I also play alto, soprano and baritone, and I can’t say which I play primarily.  It’s interesting that the tenor has a great voice for the trio setting with an acoustic bass.”

Lawrence sees the saxophone trio as something evolving from the groundwork laid by Coltrane and Rollins.  “If you go back to 1968 and compare it with today, you’re going to be demoralized because back then there were so many amazing tenor and saxophone players. Besides Coltrane and Rollins, you had Pharoah Sanders, Booker Ervin, Dewey Redman, Wayne Shorter, Dave Liebman, Steve Grossman … the list goes on and on and it doesn’t get any weaker.  Everybody had a voice.  Everybody had something to say.  Everybody was doing their own thing. That was the lesson I learned from those guys.  Trane said, ‘Hey, let’s see how far we can go.’  If there’s a lesson, it’s that.”

In the Band

Another group that came along around that same time, albeit in a different genre, also changed the face of American music. The Band, with Robbie Robertson, Rick Danko, Richard Manuel, Garth Hudson and Levon Helm, blended all sorts of roots music styles into a distinctive mix that could be called Americana before there was such a thing.  The group, perhaps best known for its relationship with Bob Dylan and its FM radio hits “The Weight” and “The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down,” broke up in 1976, as documented in Martin Scorcese’s iconic concert film The Last Waltz.  Drummer Helm has been keeping that group’s music in the public eye with his recent albums and nearly constant live performances.  Lawrence has been playing in the horn section of Helm’s band for several years. Besides playing material from the Band repertoire, Helm’s group plays a cross-section of blues, R&B, country and rock, with a swinging horn section of Lawrence, Howard Johnson, Steven Bernstein, Jay Collins and Clark Gayton.

Although he has been playing with Helm for much of the last six or seven years, Lawrence says that his involvement with the drummer and his music started over a decade earlier.  “I used to be neighbors with John Simon who produced The Band’s records and many other great records.  He loved my playing.  In 1993, when Bill Clinton was first inaugurated, they brought up Arkansas’ other favorite son, Levon Helm, to play. John was enlisted to fill in the band so he invited me. It was one of those life-changing gigs that cost me money to do.”

Interestingly, having grown up on jazz and funk, Lawrence was not particularly a big fan of The Band and its music and so he was not cowed by their stature in the rock community. “I’d  met plenty of famous musicians and performers since I was a kid, so when John told me where to meet the bus and to say hello to Garth, Rick, Richard Bell, Jim Weider, Randy Ciarlante and Butch Dener, I just treated them like folks, musician folks. I was not awestruck.”

For fans of that group, it should be no surprise that multi-instrumentalist Garth Hudson immediately connected with the young jazz man.  “Garth asked me what horn players I listened to and I told him Ben Webster was a huge influence. He reached into his bag and pulled out a beautifully hand-rendered transcription of ‘Cottontail’ and we were instantly friends. All of those guys were great. Levon had driven down beforehand and met the bus when we got to DC. ‘Where’s Jack?’ was the first thing he said. Evidently he had met Jack DeJohnette the previous week who had agreed to come down and play, they even had a third drum kit set up on the stage, only somehow no one told Jack where to meet the bus! Dylan played, Dr. John, Steven Stills and Vassar Clements all played. The music blew my mind!”

The gig with Helm evolved from a generous offer the saxophonist made to help the drummer and his bandmates.  “Most of the guys in the Band had fallen into hard times, and two of them [Richard Manuel and Rick Danko] aren’t with us anymore. Garth had lost his house. I had moved to Vermont and I called their manager and said, ‘I know Levon is in trouble and lost his voice to throat cancer. If I’m free, I will come and play for him for nothing.’  I just wanted him to know that his friends were there for him. A few years after that, they started doing those ‘Rambles,’ and they called me for that.  I was probably the first horn player in the regular band.  Now it’s five horn players.”

When I ask Lawrence what it’s like for a jazz guy to play those iconic rock tunes, he reiterates that the Band weren’t part of his musical DNA.  “I grew up listening to jazz.  I didn’t listen to Hendrix until I was 25. Then when I was 28 I was playing with Buddy Miles. I also listened a lot to funk and blues. I am sure I heard the Band, but I didn’t have the typical kid growing up and listening to rock and roll experience. But once I got it, I really appreciated it.  There’s something that’s organic about the way that he makes his music feel that permeates everybody.

“My first trip to Europe was with Sonny Sharrock a few years before he died. He was doing this crazy doo-wop thing, where he still played the way he did … before that he was with a street corner group with his brother and friends.  So he hired those guys and me as a saxophone player to cross the line between modern avant-garde jazz and the old guys.  We did this concert and when we looked at the side of the stage, all these super hip progressive free-jazz players were line dancing.  And I realized that there’s something organically rooted in everything that everybody plays.  You listen to Ornette and you hear the blues and it’s the same blues that Levon adopted, because he grew up seven miles from the King Biscuit Flour show.”

Lessons Learned

Watching Lawrence perform in the horn section of Helm’s band, it’s clear that he’s having a good time with the arrangements and music.  “The thing that keeps everyone in Levon’s band is that, I’m not comparing them as far as greatness, but it reminds me of the Ellington band where everybody in that band is a virtuoso and don’t really get to play exactly like themselves. But they subsume themselves to the music and they’re perfectly happy doing it.”

He also gets to play tunes that the audience is excited to hear, such that they start singing the opening verse without so much as a cue.  “I can’t help feeling that I’ve learned something about the rhythm and I’ve tried to bring that into my own music. I still get chills every time I play ‘Ophelia.’  I have to admit that it’s a thrill to stand in front of anywhere from 200 to 60,000 people and play music, when you’re used to playing in jazz clubs most often for far fewer.”

And it’s not just the numbers.  Lawrence also loves the way that Helm’s audience is there for the performer, in part because they grew up with his music and in part because they know of his struggle with throat cancer.  “The musicians and the audience are fully engaged.  You don’t need to do a lot of drugs like you do at some rock shows from bands of that era. Levon has always said that he wanted to do music for everybody, for little kids and for old people.  Not a psychedelic experience.”

Lawrence says that even though the music he plays with Helm is entirely different from what the jazz he plays with the Honey Ear Trio, his approach is unchanged.  “The thing that’s the same is that my intention in music is to tell stories.  I feel like that’s something I learned from my father, because he had a wild improvisational thing but then he played with Doc Severinsen. And if you listen to it, he sounds the same.  I always thought that would be an amazing thing – to craft your style so that you could do that.  That is true of my playing and same with the other guys in the [Helm] horn section.  I can hear one note and I know it’s them. “

There’s plenty to learn from working with a drummer like Helm, Lawrence acknowledges.  “I’ve been really lucky because I’ve played with a lot of great drummers, including Chico Hamilton, Buddy Miles and Levon.  Each one of them had an incredible beat and an incredible way of tending to the feel of the music and playing to the song, more so than just playing a drum pattern.  And someone like Allison carries on that tradition, except that we could go anywhere with Allison.  The time is never lost and the feel is never lost.”

Playing Their Hearts Out

Lawrence is looking ahead with material he’s composed for both projects. “I’ve been writing songs and hopefully we’ll record another record with Levon. These songs have been strongly influenced by Levon, but I don’t know whether he’ll use them or I’ll figure out a way to organically incorporate them into a creative project of my own.  I’ve also been writing songs that to me sound classic and that I love to play.  I have a working quartet and we play together a lot.  I’d like to record them.  That would be more of a straight-ahead jazz thing with Rene Hart, Ben Perowsky and Rob Reich.

The Honey Ear Trio has been performing shows connected to the release of the album, and Lawrence notices the difference when the group is gigging.  “It was amazing to do six gigs in 10 days.  I can’t tell you how infrequently that sort of thing happens. Back in the days when the dinosaurs roamed the earth, they played for three or six months at one club and they sounded like it.  And now we’re very skilled, but we cannot pretend that we sound like we’ve been playing together for the last three months. I was pining that for six months it would be 1954 again.

 “One of the gifts I’ve gotten from playing with Levon is to bring this beautiful music that everybody’s dying to hear to all these different places and all these people are so excited to hear it.  It’s one of the joys of traveling as a musician is bringing your gifts to some place that you always wanted to be – to have them appreciate the music and to have some sort of exchange with the people based on the fact that you really have something to offer.  You’re not just some tourist.  Hopefully we’ll get to do more of that with the Honey Ear Trio. We’re artists and we really love to play for people. “

Here’s a video of a performance by Honey Ear Trio of “Eyjafjallajokull (Volcano Song) 1.”

 Lawrence is aware that his work with Honey Ear is not going to get the same reaction that Levon Helm and his band get when they perform a song like “The Weight” with a famous rock star guesting on vocals. “What a musical performance is supposed to do is make you feel something.  If somebody says that that’s not jazz or I don’t know what it is, but I like it, or I think I like that, at least they’re engaged. Jazz is the highest denominator art form. We’re not waiting for people to be ready to hear this stuff.  We’re just presuming that some people are ready to receive it, whether they intellectually know it or not. The response has been great so far.  You don’t have to pass a test to listen to it. Here’s the basic thing. We know what we’re doing. You give us a chance and we’re going to play our hearts out for you.  And that’s what we do.” ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912203438.69/warc/CC-MAIN-20190324103739-20190324125739-00421.warc.gz

 For those readers not familiar with my curious obsession with Christmas music, let me just say that you are in the sure and steady hands of a holiday music connoisseur-a man who every year sends out an eclectic CD sampler in lieu of a card or boasting newsletter. However, I can boast here that in narcissistic preparation for this column, I counted my collection of Xmas CDs and it came to just under 800 albums. What that really means is that I can start playing holiday music on November 22 and go 24/7 until Christmas morning without repeating one cut.  So I got that going for me, which is nice.  But enough about me and my collection. The holiday season is about giving and today I give you a rundown of holiday CDs released this year, adding another two dozen to the aforementioned total. Oops, not about me.  Right.  And since we can’t go in reverse order of age like at the Mergner house, we’ll stick to alphabetical order here. One at a time, kids. Emilie-Claire Barlow
Winter Wonderland
Compress Music Group
This glamorous chanteuse from Canada has a soft willowy voice with a slight edge, almost like Diana Krall in a higher register. And that’s a good thing.  The arrangements here are straight from the jazz singer playbook. She has great pitch control and simply sings beautifully.  However, Ms. Barlow clearly did not read my previous reviews of Christmas albums or she wouldn’t have attempted YET ANOTHER remake of Ray Charles-Betty Carter classic, “Baby, It’s Cold Outside.” Her duet partner is Marc Jordan and, well, Ray Charles he isn’t. I know, I know, who is?  Still, Barlow is a fine singer and likely has a great future as an interpreter of the Great American Songbook and hopefully some more modern material as well. If you’re looking for holiday music sung in a sultry and romantic jazz style, add this one to your collection.

Berlin Voices
About Christmas
Hanssler
This young vocal quartet is certainly influenced by Manhattan Transfer, but their almost squeaky clean sound owes as much to choral music traditions of European classical music, and maybe a few glee clubs, Euro style. Like an artful Ray Conniff singers album. The chipper foursome from Germany is backed by an able jazz group of Hendrik Soll on piano and keyboards, Bruno Muller on guitar, Christian von Kaphengst on bass and Martijn Vink, with the arranging done by some stalwarts in that field, including Darmon Meader and Peter Eldridge of the outstanding vocal group, New York Voices. The arrangements are very original and help to make the album imminently listenable. The music is by no means progressive jazz.  More like jazzy classical crossover music. Nonetheless, the music has a sublime quality in spots, particularly with ballads and hymns such as “The First Noel/A Child Is Born” and “Stille Nacht,” the latter done a cappella.  And ethnocentric Americans wondering if the singers handle English lyrics without awkward accents needn’t concern themselves with trifling matters, because the four sing equally well in English and German.  Regardless of your native language, this one is recommended for lovers of pure vocal music.

Izzy Chait
Live for the Holidays
Izzy Chait
Izzy Chait apparently likes to keep things moving. Chait is a good old swingin’ jazz singer in the tradition of Mel Torme or Tony Bennett, with a touch of the Beat poet.  In this live recording from the Jazz Bakery in 2005, the deep-voiced Chait leads an acoustic jazz quartet through a set of holiday classics, with a few curveballs thrown in, such as “If I Only Had a Brain” and two Chait originals, “If You Believe All That” and “Calling All Angels.”  He does his best to make the usual Xmas chestnuts his own. One way he does that is by shifting in mid-song not only his vocal approach, but also the time signature and mood, so the listener may be surprised by the twists and turns. For example, he opens “Silent Night” solemnly singing it like a jazz ballad in the mode of Johnny Hartman and after the opening verse, he shifts to a rollicking N’awlins style version more in the manner of Dr. John.  Similarly his “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” begins in a Nat King Cole vein, with even the piano, guitar and bass backing often associated with that iconic singer, but then heats up with the entry of the saxophonist Louis Van Taylor, as the group shift gears into more a Sinatra swing thing. Of course, as is often the case, it’s the curveballs to which you may find yourself attracted.  In Chait’s own “If You Believe All That,” the singer recalls a late ’70s era Tom Waits as he comically goes through all the crazy things that people end up believing for better or worse, accompanied by a soul-jazz arrangement.  And, on “Calling All Angels,” Chait preaches his music with a message like a jazz version of Screaming Jay Hawkins, as he implores his audience to “Someone save a life tonight,” and shifts it into a spoken-word piece briefly. Well, again, he does like to keep things moving.  Harmonica player Linda Moss makes a stirring cameo appearance on “Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow” which the band takes out at one point in a fast hardbop style. Intent on demonstrating his own considerable musicality and stagecraft, Chait keeps things interesting by paying tribute to the songs and some of their most famous interpreters without getting swallowed up by their legacy.

Bing Crosby
The Crosby Christmas Sessions
Collectors Choice
There’s no shortage of holiday music from Bing Crosby.  This is, after all, the guy who turned “White Christmas” into a holiday standard. And the same guy who hosted countless Christmas program on the radio, later moving to television, and all that implied.  In short, he had a veritable lifelong relationship with Christmas music thanks to those high-profile programs. This album, recently released along with a batch of reissues with his estate’s blessing, is a representative sampler of songs from Bing’s radio and television shows, nicely remastered to give them a more modern sheen.  One of the great things about Crosby’s holiday shows was the special guest appearance by a fellow singer or celebrity.  Among the artists making cameo appearances on this collection are Ella Fitzgerald, Peggy Lee, Frank Sinatra, and of course David Bowie, in a collaboration that once seemed like a put-on until its unique magic outlasted the irony.  Through it all, there’s Bing, one of the 20th century’s most distinctive and compelling voices, in any genre.

Lea DeLaria
Be a Santa
Warner Classics & Jazz
DeLaria comes to jazz from the world of Broadway and comedy clubs and therefore brings a certain panache to this collection of Christmas songs backed by a solid band of British jazz musicians and produced by pianist Janette Mason.  DeLaria and Mason did all the arrangements themselves and elected to go with a mainstream jazz approach throughout. As DeLaria says in the press materials, “I’ve always wanted to make a Christmas album. All the greats did it; Ella Fitzgerald, Louie Armstrong, Frank Sinatra, Mel Torme-I wanted mine out there too!”  The problem facing her, and so many modern singers of classic material, is that Ella she’s not.  In fact, she has limited range and occasionally wobbly intonation, most apparent in the uptempo songs.  Nonetheless, DeLaria scats well on “Santa Claus Is Coming to Town” and “White Christmas.”  And her comic flair helps with songs like “The Man With the Bag” and “Be a Santa.”  Interestingly, the cuts that resonate for me are the ballads-“Christmas Time is Here” and “Have Yourself a Merry Christmas”-in which DeLaria is backed by a basic piano trio plus vibes. Her simple and direct approach on those songs gets the job done nicely.

Allan Harris
Sings a Nat King Cole Christmas: Dedicated to You
Allan Harris Productions
A dusky-voiced jazz crooner very much in debt stylistically to Nat King Cole, Allan Harris doesn’t run from that influence in this set of traditional Christmas songs, including some made popular by Cole, as well as others he never touched.  The session was recorded live at KUVO radio station in Denver and, backed by a piano trio, Harris sounds like he is having fun revisiting this classic holiday repertoire.  He even does “All I Want for Christmas (Is My Two Front Teeth),” not exactly a standard in the Cole canon. The same goes for “Blue Christmas.” And although I have grown weary of remakes of the Ray Charles-Betty Carter duet of “Baby, It’s Cold Outside,” the combination of Harris doing Nat (not Ray) and the soulful and tuneful singer Rene Marie doing, well, Rene Marie produce a version that’s respectful of the original but with plenty of its own flair. They get a pass for breaking my hardfast, but seemingly pointless, rule of never redoing that song. All in all, a nice change of pace for Nat King Cole fans who may have already worn out his successful holiday album.

Dan Hicks and the Hot Licks
Crazy for Christmas
Surfdog
You get the feeling that Dan Hicks digs Christmas.  Or maybe it’s just the way his loosey-goosey scoobie-doobie [damn spell-check] vintage swing style meshes so well with the holiday material.  Leading his longtime group, the Hot Licks, who had several hits in the late ’70s, Hicks is the rare case of a rock era musician whose jazz influence comes almost entirely from the era before bebop.  He mixes Texas and Hot Club sounds into his swing, plus a good bit of Slim Galliard.  He turns “Run Rudolph Run,” a rocker made famous by Chuck Berry, into an uptempo acoustic romp, like something from an early Sam Phillips-produced Sun Studio session. And “Cool Yule” a song written by Steve Allen and popularized by Louis Armstrong, has a gentle country swing feel.  In a recent interview with JT, the wry Hicks confessed to strong ambivalence about the kazoo, but on more than one song he lets his two backup singers-Daria and Roberta Donnay, the Lickettes-loose on that often maligned instrument.  And it works, because it gives their scatting just the right vibe for this often tongue-in-cheek material. Hicks also earns considerable points for refashioning old tunes into Hot Licks style Xmas songs, such as “Santa Gotta Choo-Choo” (from “Choo Choo Ch’Boogie”) and “Somebody Stole My Santa Suit” (from Leo Wood’s “Somebody Stole My Gal”).  He even remakes his own “Where’s the Money” into “Christmas Mornin'” which opens the album. Hicks accrues more credits from the Christmas music judges by writing a few of his own, including “Old Fashioned Christmas” and “I’ve Got Christmas By the Tail,” both of which are likely to appear on a Mergner family Christmas CD in the next few years. (Sorry, Dan, no mechanical fees.)  Hicks has a laconic vocal style that is both droll and expressive. No Pavarotti or Al Jarreau, Hicks never overreaches and the end result sounds like a convivial party in a living room, which is an excellent goal for any Xmas record, in my less than humble opinion.

Cindy Horstman/Michael Medina
2Tone Christmas
Seahorse
Horstman, a Texas-based harpist, favors highly melodic renditions of Christmas music staples, accompanied by bassist Michael Medina (who also produced the album), along with various special guests including guitarist Andy Timmons, vocalist Jimi Tunnell and smooth jazz saxophonists Tom Braxton and Ron Jones. Horstman plays her harp almost as if an electronic keyboard and the result is a slightly New Age-ish sound not unlike one of those great Windham Hill records of the 80s.  Indeed, Medina’s fretless bass sound recalls Michael Manring, who was a ubiquitous presence on those old Windham Hill records.  Timmons is a modern electric guitarist with a melodic bent via processor ala Pat Metheny.  Drums are used sporadically and a bit too often of the electronic variety for my taste. And if they’re not electronic, then why do they sound like it?  Nonetheless, this is a thoroughly listenable Xmas album, well suited for a quiet Sunday morning, while recovering from a night of hard holiday drinking (see Sheldon, Jack).

Wynton Marsalis
Christmas Jazz Jam
Somerset
Although Wynton is listed alone as the artist, this album is very much a group effort, featuring several of his longtime bandmates, including saxophonists Walter Blanding, Wessel Anderson, Victor Goines, trombonists Wycliffe Gordon and Vincent Gardner, banjo player Don Vappie (who also sings “Blue Christmas”), with a rhythm section of Dan Nimmer, Reginald Veal and Herlin Riley. No question, this is a swinging session, albeit with a Crescent City accent, and it’s hard to think of any group working now that can swing quite like Marsalis and company.  The ten-piece band really kicks on the spiritual “Mary Had a Little Baby” which features the operatic Roberta Gumbel on vocals. The milieu here is steadfastly New Orleans, and often, such as on “Jingle Bells” or “Blue Christmas” the arrangements go straight to Bourbon Street or even the second line parades of the Ninth Ward.  Marsalis wears his influences on his sleeve-Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington and Doc Cheatham-and he’s developed a band sound that moves comfortably in that style.  And, as he would say himself, these guys can really play.  Throughout, whether it’s a corny song like “Rudoph the Rednosed Reindeer” or a gospel number like “Go Tell It On the Mountain,” the group stays faithful to its New Orleans roots. Jazz fans expecting to hear Wynton Marsalis, the virtuoso soloist, may be a little disappointed that he doesn’t hog the spotlight. In fact, you have to wait until cut number eleven before Wynton holds forth on “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” with a small ensemble and even then he plays with taste and restraint, rather than showing off all that virtuosity. It seems that sometimes leading the band has nothing to do with solos and chops.

Greta Matassa & Clipper Anderson
And to All a Good Night
Origin
In this beautifully recorded and produced album from the underrated Origin label, holiday music is given a set of exquisite and precise arrangements. The Seattle-based Matassa is the chief lead singer, although co-leader and bassist Anderson takes a turn in the spotlight on a few songs. The music could perhaps be described as West Coast cool jazz, but they mix up the rhythms pretty well. Matassa’s voice has a purity something like June Christy or Chris Connor and accordingly carries off the ballads with an austere beauty. In fact, austere beauty would be a good way to describe the entire session. The repertoire is not your usual group of songs, thanks to tunes like “November in the Snow” by Bill Mays and Mark Murphy, “Christmas Day” by Bacharach/David, and “Where Can I Find Christmas” by Doug Goodwin. This one may have to make an annual appearance in my household.

Irene Nachreiter with her Latin Jazz Band
A Hot and Spicy Christmas
Turquoise Water Music
Hot and spicy?  Well, not really. “Her Latin Jazz Band” is simply not the fiery Latin jazz of, say, Poncho Sanchez or Tito Puente.  The album does have an engaging and light Latin flavor, utilizing a variety of South American styles.  And the repertoire and arrangements are very different from the usual holiday fare.  Many of the songs feature lesser-known traditional songs done in a sort of acoustic world fusion style that is warm and appealing.  Nachreiter’s voice is restrained and very European, with a sing-song quality somewhat out of step with the music’s south of the border feel.  The playing, though not as hot and spicy as billed, is often beautiful and expressive.

Grant Osborne/Peter Innocenti/Jeff Crouse
Little Town: Carols for Christmas
Little Town
This relatively unknown piano trio from Cary, North Carolina has made a solid self-produced album of holiday favorites. With Grant Osborne on piano, Peter Innocenti on bass and Jeff Crouse on drums, this understated trio deftly performs a cross-section of tunes familiar and less so.  Singer Jeanne Jolly (what a great name for an appearance on a holiday music album!) joins in on two songs, also in understated fashion. The group came together after meeting at their local church for late night sessions and the music sounds like something that would be acceptable at a Jazz Vespers service.  Not that it’s particularly spiritual in theme and tone. After all, they open the album with a lyrical version of “The Chipmunk Song,” and also take on modern classics like “White Christmas” and “Christmas Time is Here,” done here even slower than usual. Elsewhere the focus is indeed on carols and the lyrical quality of the trio fits those like a glove. After an upbeat “Auld Lang Syne” with a New Orleans second line backbeat, the trio closes the album with a Pat Metheny song “Always and Forever,” dedicating it to their wives and families.  All in all, a restful and enjoyable piano trio album.

Martin Sasse
Still Still Still: A Christmas Collection
Nagel Heyer
Imagine if Bill Evans had recorded a Christmas album with his trio. Pianist Martin Sasse is his own man musically, but the effect of a piano trio taking the air out of holiday classics is much like what we would imagine Evans doing in 2010. No question, Sasse has considerable touch and taste.  His rhythm section of Henning Gailing on bass and Hans Dekker on drums acquit themselves well.  I love a jazz Christmas CD in which the artists treat the songs the same way as standards, as something to take off from.  We have enough crooning singers to handle the requisite melodicism and faithful renditions. Also, the German pianist isn’t married to the American canon, thankfully, and covers Deutsche holiday songs like, “Leise Rieselt der Schnee,” and “Susser die Glocken nie Klingen.”  Mein Deutsch ist nicht so gut these days, but I think those are Christmas songs.  In any case, Sasse and his trio treat every song as a point of departure for their modernist explorations and that makes this a Christmas record tailor-made for jazz fans.

The Brian Setzer Orchestra
Christmas Comes Alive
Surfdog
The former Stray Cats leader has remained faithful to that rockabilly and jump-swing sound and now fronts an 18-piece band that does indeed rock, jump and swing. Pounding out rapid-fire licks on his classic Gretsch guitar, Setzer has chops and shows them off throughout this live recording of holiday material performed during the group’s 2009 Christmas Extravaganza Tour. Setzer does his best to turn every tune into a rockabilly rave, perhaps most successfully with “You’re a Mean One, Mr. Grinch” and “Blue Christmas.”  If you like your jump-swing with a rockin’ edge, Setzer is your man and his orchestra is your band. Clear the living room for dancing if that’s your Santa bag.

Jack Sheldon
Ho Ho Ho
Mightycore
Do you like to have a little drink during the holidays?  Me too, although my Grinch of a doctor has recently ordered yours truly to stick to eggnog from the grocery store-the one without alcohol and with Vitamin D.  Apparently 40 years of moderate drinking can take its toll on a man’s liver. But now I can still experience a boozy Christmas vicariously thanks to this EP (that’s an album of less than 30 minutes, kids) from trumpeter and singer Jack Sheldon.  Like a character straight out of Man Men, Sheldon belts down a few (well, maybe more than a few) stiff drinks, then dons a Santa suit, picks up his trumpet and records multiple versions of “Jack’s in the House” and “Christmas in My Hometown.”  Think the Mad Men reference is gratuitous? In the former tune, big Jack sings/intones/slurs his spur-of-the-moment Christmas list of “One blonde, one brunette, some bourbon and some gin.”  He jokes about women of all sizes sitting on his lap and, well, he’s having a helluva Christmas, and I, for one, am not going to stop him.  For one thing, the music matches the ethos. They’re having a schwingingly good time and although you only get basically two tunes, the outtakes and alternate versions provide plenty of vicarious pleasure for those seeking such things. My loving feminist spouse aside, Jack is indeed in my house this holiday season, at least for these two uproarious tunes.

John Sheridan’s Dream Band
Hooray for Christmas
Arbors Jazz
This recording has two very special things going for it. First, it is a mainstream jazz record from the first note to the last, with no pretension of cross-genre experimentation. Enlisting the help of many of the mainstays of the Arbors Jazz record label, pianist John Sheridan did in fact recruit his dream band of mainstream and swing players including Warren Vache, Dan Barrett, Scott Robinson, Eddie Erickson, Phil Flanigan, Joe Ascione and other standouts. Rebecca Kilgore handles most of the vocal chores and acquits herself nicely, never oversinging and always blending well with the band. The second asset of this holiday recording is that it focuses on often-overlooked songs, such as “A Song for Christmas,” “Hooray for Christmas,” and “The Holiday Season.”  On Dave Frishberg’s rarely-performed “The Difficult Season,” Sheridan and company play the sad ballad straightforwardly, allowing Kilgore to wrest the odd combination of wit and melancholy from the lyrics and backing Randy Reinhardt in an expressive cornet solo. A great addition to the mainstream jazz holiday music catalog.

Frank Sinatra/Dean Martin/Sammy Davis Jr.
Christmas with the Rat Pack
Capitol
If your idea of a holiday party is hanging at a 60s era casino with cool cats and showgirls, this album might seem right up your alley.  However, to be fair, each of these guys have much to offer beyond that cooler-than-thou persona.  For instance, the album opens with Martin’s classic version of “Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!” and that’s a staple in this household and many others.  It’s followed by a Sinatra in peak form kicking “Mistletoe and Holly.”  Then Davis doing “Christmas Time All Over the World,” displaying the sadly frequent pairing of his great talent with somewhat hokey arrangements. Then it goes round again, with more classics by Sinatra and Martin and the occasional show tune version with Davis, an underrated vocalist.  In short, this is not a boozy party on stage at some Vegas nightspot.  Nearly every song in this compilation reflects three great American entertainers performing in the studio at the top of their game. And one of them is one of America’s most iconic vocalists. The breakdown of the 16 tunes: Sinatra gets seven, Martin six and Davis three.  Fair enough. It’s pretty seamless thanks to arrangements by Billy May and other orchestral masters. And there isn’t a clunker in the bunch.  This album is an essential addition to the collection of any serious fan of great Christmas music.

Take 6
The Most Wonderful Time of the Year
Heads Up
If you know Take 6, then you know exactly what this record sounds like.  From the very first note of the title tune to the end of the ballad “Christmas Time Is Here” that closes the album, their vocal virtuosity and intricate a cappella arrangements are on full display here.  Given the popularity of Glee and its unabashed regard for a cappella music, you’d hope that these six guys from Tennessee would get their due.  Somehow all those boy bands of the ’90s seemed to erase their visibility as one of the pre-eminent vocal groups of their time, along with Manhattan Transfer, New York Voices, and yes, the Four Freshmen. However, what’s separated Take 6 from those groups is the way they’ve always balanced R&B elements (particularly with its bass and rhythm parts) with classic vocal jazz.  Their beat boxing, for want of a better term, is singular and provides a unique foundation for their complex harmonies.  The entire album has an upbeat feel-good vibe, no matter the tempo. They even do a funny tip of the hat to the Chipmunks with their talk-in-the-studio intro on “The Grinch,” as two of the members argue over who gets the lead and best of all, one of them is named Alvin. The takeaway with Take 6 is that you don’t have to be an a cappella vocal nut to appreciate their considerable talent and verve.

Matt Wilson’s
Christmas Tree-O
Palmetto
Matt Wilson is a unique figure in jazz. The drummer/bandleader has a great sense of humor and invests even the most serious challenging music with a certain mischievous glee.  His band’s live performances always have an air of mirth and mayhem that is refreshing in the sometimes overly analytical world of creative jazz. Christmas music then, with its odd mix of novelty and devotion, is made to order for Wilson and his compatriots. For this holiday album, the drummer uses a stripped down version of his band with Jeff Lederer on saxophones and Paul Sikivie on bass. This trio powers its way through tunes traditional (“Hark the Herald Angels Sing” and “Angels We Have Heard on High”) and contemporary (“Happy Xmas – War Is Over” and “You’re a Mean One, Mr. Grinch”).  A loving father of four kids, Wilson’s populist nature allows him to take a hokey tune like “The Chipmunk Song” and treat it like an Ornette Coleman standard. This is, in short, serious fun and possibly the most creative holiday jazz album to come out this year.

Charles Xavier
Xmas Vibe
Happy Note
This year’s winner of the annual JazzTimes “Christmas in August” award, for sending the first holiday album to the JazzTimes office, Xavier is a vibist with new age roots and jazz expressionism.  Originally from New England, Xavier settled in the Bay area where he’s done plenty of TV and film soundtrack work.  It shows.  His approach is something like In A Silent Way meets electronica, which is to say that the tunes often float in a hazy sonic ether. At one point, I had to check the album cover to figure out that the song they were doing was “God Rest Ye Merry Gentleman.”  I kinda like that.  I wouldn’t say that the group is on the level of Miles’ Bitches Brew crew, but they have a very similar sensibility.  And that counts for plenty in my book.

Various Artists
World Christmas Party
Putumayo
Leave it to Putumayo to bring Xmas music around the world.  Or bring us around the world through Xmas music. This excellent compilation includes a broad swath of music styles-reggae, Latin, African, Brazilian, Hawaiian and even some good old American R&B and country. If your taste is eclectic, you’re likely to find plenty of interesting material on this set. Among my favorites are: Jamaican legend Jacob Miller doing “We Wish You A Merry Christmas”; Cape Verdean singer Maria de Barros performing “Deck the Halls” as a Brazilian samba; and Hawaiian uke duo Keahiwai swinging an island version of “Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree.”  There’s even a few chestnuts for the traditional jazz and blues fan, including the late Charles Brown’s “Christmas Comes But Once a Year” and the Heritage Hall Jazz Band’s “Barra de Navidad Blues.”  Best of all no one from another country tries to remake “Baby It’s Cold Outside.” It makes you root for Putumayo to do a worldly holiday collection every year.

The Year Without a Santa Claus
By Phyllis McGinley, as told by Boris Karloff
Capitol
A Christmas tale narrated by Boris Karloff?  Count me in.  What does it have to do with jazz?  I have no idea.  It arrived with the Rat Pack album, but this one, a reissue from 1968, is for kids, not hipsters. Oh well. Many people may forget that, back in the day,  Karloff narrated The Grinch Who Stole Christmas.  He’s actually a masterful reader and perfect for this charming cautionary tale by Phyllis McGinley.  There are also six Christmas songs added from everyone from Alvin & the Chipmunks to Peggy Lee. Nonetheless, for my Christmas list next year, I’m asking for a vampire Xmas tale read by Bela Lugosi.  Forget True Blood.  I roll old school.

Eugene Marlow’s Heritage Ensemble
Celebrations
MEH Enterprises
As Garrison Keillor once said, being Jewish at Christmas is a little like being downstairs from neighbors having a loud and raucous party.  You really want to tell them to turn it down a notch, but you know you neither can nor will do so. And the same goes for the music, which is dominated by either traditional Christian imagery or modern commercialization.  However, there are plenty of great Hanukah songs, from Adam Sandler’s “Hanukah Song,” to “Can I Interest You in Hanukah?” by Stephen Colbert and Jon Stewart.  Yes, I know, more like comic relief from that noisy party than classics from a traditional songbook.  That’s why this album has special merit. As described in the album’s subtitle, Eugene Marlow and his ethnically-diverse Heritage Ensemble interpret festive melodies from the Hebraic songbook.  From the very first tune, a hard-driving Afro-Cuban version of  “Chanukah, O Chanukah,” you know this is not someone’s Jewish grandmother’s music, at least in its performance.  Marlow has assembled an interesting and tight quintet of Latin and American jazz players, including Bobby Sanabria on drums, Michael Hashim on saxophones, Frank Wagner on bass, Cristian Rivera on percussion and Marlow on keyboards. The result is a churning Afro-Cuban brew, with Hashim’s phrasing providing just the right Middle-Eastern touch to remind you of the music’s origins.  Inspired by Latin jazz, the music of Hebraic culture and classic American jazz, Marlow has been working out this cross-cultural band sound for many years and the preparation shows in the music, which is both engaging and interesting.  It is a record that holds up well regardless of the season.  There’s even a final cut in which Marlow explains the group’s origins, methodology and goals. However, the music speaks for itself loud and clear. That’s all, folks.  Let us know what your favorite holiday jazz albums are.  Comment below.  You must be logged in as a user to comment.

 Many times in jazz the personnel that comes together in a special way is the result of second choices or just plain serendipity. So too with the pairing of Javon Jackson and Les McCann who have been performing together at clubs and festivals, including a recent concert at the Cape May Jazz Festival. Seeing the two mesh onstage, it would be hard to imagine that the legendary McCann was originally a sub or fill-in.

About three years ago, Jackson had an upcoming performance for his soul-jazz group scheduled at John Lee Hooker’s Boom Boom Room in San Francisco and his organist, the great Dr. Lonnie Smith, was unable to make it. Acting on a whim as much as anything, Jackson called  Eddie Harris’s widow and mentioned that he was in a bind and did she think Les McCann might be interesting in subbing for Smith in that gig in the Bay area. She encouraged him to call McCann at his home in Southern California and, as Hooker himself sang, “Boom Boom Boom” the two hit it off onstage and were soon performing other shows together and connecting across generations. Since that show in 2007, they’ve done about fifty shows together and jazz audiences are getting another look at the 75-year-old McCann, who appears rejuvenated by the collaboration.

Maybe that serendipity is fitting given that the McCann and Harris pairing that produced the Swiss Movement performance and recording was also a somewhat chance pairing. As Les McCann wrote in his Farewell tribute piece to Joel Dorn for JT, it was the producer Dorn who suggested that the two get together.  “He’s the guy who told me, ‘When you go to Switzerland, there’s a guy over there that I like very much named Eddie Harris,” wrote McCann. “Why don’t you guys see if you can get together and come up with something?’ And that’s how Swiss Movement came about. It was Joel’s idea. My trio was scheduled to play there at the Montreux Jazz Festival and Eddie’s band was supposed to play there as well, and since we were both on Atlantic Records Joel suggested that we get together for one set of music. He had already discussed it with [Montreux promoter] Claude Nobs and the higher-ups at Atlantic and they all thought it was a great idea. We never had a rehearsal. I did get together with Eddie ahead of time to discuss the tunes, but that record was almost 90-percent spontaneous on the stage. Between songs, I had to sing the chorus into the guys’ ears and remind them of the changes. And that’s how we did it. It was another case of divine intervention.”

Jackson acknowledges that he had absorbed that particular McCann & Harris album by osmosis. “I heard that recording my whole life and I always liked it,” he recalls. “My mother played that particular recording a lot in the house, so I’ve heard that as long as I can remember.”  Jackson’s group performs a few songs from that album, including “Compared to What” and “Cold Duck Time,” and Jackson had no problem stepping into the Harris role, in part because of his personal relationship with the late saxophonist and in part because of his own identity forged as a sideman with Art Blakey and other greats, and established as a bandleader all his own. Growing up in Denver, Jackson would check out Harris when he came to town and over the years the two developed a close bond, both musically and personally. “I’ve known Eddie my whole life so actually it’s an honor to be in the role,” Jackson says. “I don’t look at it as a particular challenge but I do come from that spirit anyway so when we play a song like “Compared to What” or “Cold Duck Time” or we do any of those kinds of songs that have that spirit on there, there may be some references to how he would attack a particular piece of music.”

To be fair, there is plenty of Javon Jackson in the way he plays tenor while leading his group that features McCann; he isn’t simply going up there and recycling Eddie Harris riffs. Also influenced strongly by John Coltrane and Wayne Shorter, Jackson established himself as a formidable player playing with another legendary bandleader-Art Blakey-who demanded that his sidemen play like themselves. Jackson would go on to his own solo career with over a dozen records as a leader on Criss Cross, Blue Note and Palmetto Records. He also has performed with several other legendary elders of jazz, including Freddie Hubbard, Cedar Walton, Elvin Jones and, most recently, Freddie Redd.  But it’s Blakey who seems to have had the greatest impact on Jackson, at least when it comes to the nuances of leading a band.

Asked about how people perceive Les McCann these days, Jackson quickly cites Blakey and his advice about keeping out there in front of audiences. “He would say, ‘If people don’t hear you, they forget about you,'” Jackson explains. “So, it’s good, because people haven’t seen his [McCann’s] name and he’s been kind of inactive largely due to the stroke he had about ten years ago. He’s starting to get back out again and we’ve been having a lot of fun.  People are saying about Les, ‘Hey, wow, we want to see you again.’  It’s a win for him, it’s a win for me, it’s a win for the audience.  When everyone wins, it’s even more special.”

Taking in a set by Jackson and McCann, audiences do seem to react as if they’ve won the lottery. In Cape May, McCann doesn’t even need to sing the chorus to “Compared to What.”  He merely points to the crowd who sing the lines perfectly on cue and in tune.  Jackson says that doing those old tunes is fun for the group and the audience.  “It allows Les to come out and for people to see him and for Les to get some flowers, if you will, and say what he wants to say. And it lets the audience hear some of those songs that they’re acquainted with. But you notice that the other night we did a song which was called ‘Vu Ja De,’ which is an adaptation of “De Ja Vu” from the record.  It’s updated in a way we had a lot of fun with it.  At some point you can’t live there just redoing old material. That’s why I respect a person like Wayne Shorter. Wayne’s always moving. Well, some people don’t really like that. They want him to play the way he played on this recording or that recording.  But he’s decided not to go back.”

However, it seems that the audiences that are connecting to Jackson’s band with McCann aren’t just older listeners viewing the show through the rose-colored tint of nostalgia. Jackson is finding that young people are responding as well, and doing it based solely on the sound and the feel of the music. “One thing about Les-it’s infectious. When there’s a pocket, when there’s a groove there, it doesn’t matter what age, people connect to it because this thing is so rooted in feelings and emotions and the church and all that. That kind of feeling gets to everybody, no matter what age.  They might not know the lyrics or even the tunes, but when you play a concert at, say, the Playboy Jazz Festival and you look down and you see all those young people, who may not know who Les McCann is, the minute that groove comes in, they’re all moving their heads and they’re all grooving to it.”

No question, McCann is still playing in the pocket and not just when soloing on his own tunes. What’s also interesting is how well McCann has fit in with the group. In the recent show in Cape May, McCann was locked in with the rhythm section during solos by Jackson or guitarist David Gilmore. Jackson says that many people don’t know how great an accompanist or ensemble player McCann is. “In some of his earliest trios, he would play standards-things he did long before ‘Compared to What.’ So he has that ability. He’s collaborated with a lot of great artists.  If you talk to him about pianists, he’ll start talking about Erroll Garner, he’ll talk about Art Tatum-because he’s a student of all that history.  For him, obviously, that ballooned into something because of a couple of recordings, but he’s really a vast individual in terms of different places that he can come from.”

In their performances, Jackson takes the role as the leader and virtual emcee and much of their stage patter is devoted to warm teasing between the saxophonist and McCann. Their mutual affection is very real and expressed in the way that close friends will ride each other about clothes, sports, food, hometown or whatever might get a reaction. Not much is off limits.  “Absolutely, that’s his nature. He’s very playful, he loves to crack jokes and he’s very sinister, but not in a bad way.  He’s definitely a person who likes to have fun.  You need to have thick skin around Les and not to take anything personal.”  Jackson again cites his old mentor. “It was the same way with Art Blakely-those kinda guys, they know when to let you know they love you and they know when to push some buttons and play with you.  Even though Art’s older than Les, it’s that same kind of generational thing. Les is that kind of person that loves to jab when possible to have some fun.”

And watching Jackson, during the gig in Cape May, get on McCann about his love for Kobe Bryant, it’s apparent that McCann can receive as well as he can give.  “Yea, he doesn’t give out anything that he can’t receive in return.  I get lots of comments from people who say that they can see the relationship, both in the music and the onstage back and forth, how close we are and what we feel for each other. We’ve never really discussed that, but there’s definitely a strong respect and admiration for each other.  I definitely get that from him.  Anytime we do a gig, the next day he’ll call me, ‘Hey man, great time,’ or ‘See you on the next one,” or we’ll discuss this or that, like, ‘Hey maybe one time we can try this or maybe one time I’ll count this off.’  I can honestly say that he and I have never had any kind of disagreements of the sort where, ‘I don’t wanna do this anymore’ or something like that.  In that respect, we’re the same-we both realize the music is bigger than both of us.”

Jackson says that he’s been too busy playing live to focus on a recording with the band.  In addition, he’s wary of doing a clone of Swiss Movement. “I can hear Art Blakey in my mind telling me, ‘Man, it’s never about what’s not happening…it’s about what you’re going to create.’  Things take on different forms and you have to be able to see the different form and be willing to move on with that change.  I do want to document us together so I’ve been working on it-trying to come up with something creative and thinking about a way for us to record together.  He’s thinking about it and I’ve been thinking about it, because we would really like to just document our time together.  He says, ‘Let’s just go and do something that’s never been played before.’ That’s how Les speaks.”

Jackson has a keen appreciation for McCann’s legacy in jazz history and credits him as an originator of a style that has grown in the last four decades. “He’s the godfather of what we know as funky jazz,” explains Jackson.  “And there are a ton of players that have come after him-people like Richard Tee or Donald Brown-who cite him as an influence. A lot of those soul jazz pianists, such as Ramsey Lewis and Joe Sample, might be influenced by him.  Because Les was in the ’50s and ’60s, he had an influence on a lot of those soul jazz pianists who came up in the ’70s and ’80s, whether they knew it or not.  You’ve got alto players and sax players coming up today and they don’t mention Charlie Parker. You might have gotten it from someone else but everyone’s influenced by Charlie Parker. Les is at the beginning of that gospel and jazz and the soul thing and now you got a zillion people who come from that.  What used to be the tree might have had seven branches and now it’s got about a hundred of them.  But they’re all still hybrids of three or four things.”

For his part, the 45-year-old Jackson is grateful for the opportunity to learn from McCann on the bandstand and off.  He explains that he’s never been afraid to learn from his elders.  “I’ve been fortunate. I have a successful relationship with Stanley Turrentine, I have a good relationship with George Coleman.  I’ve always tried to reach out and learn from these people who have done it before me and done it on a high level. To me it’s almost silly not to make some kind of connection with these various artists, whether it be Billy Harper or Jackie McLean. I’ve reached out to all those people and, believe it or not, they’re more than willing to share their input regarding the business or the saxophone or the lifestyle.”

Jackson says the group will continue to perform around the country in 2011. They’re even headed to a festival in Brazil.  For more information about upcoming performances by Javon Jackson with Les McCann, you can visit Jackson’s website.  Wherever they end up gigging, Jackson is happy to be part of a cross-generational project like this. “Even though he’s older than me, from a different generation, he’s willing to accept the music at a point that he can grow from it and I absolutely feel that way.  His generation has made it possible for our generation.” ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912203326.34/warc/CC-MAIN-20190324043400-20190324065400-00307.warc.gz

 Dave Burrell knows a lot about the Civil War.  Although no historian, the pianist has done enough research to support a doctoral thesis.  Recently, the Philadelphia-based pianist was commissioned by the Rosenbach Museum & Library to compose a piece of music in conjunction with its upcoming exhibit on the Civil War.  The exhibit is called The Civil War Begins and will feature:

• Eyewitness drawings by newspaper correspondents at the trial of John Brown.
• Robert E. Lee’s letter to Winﬁeld Scott resigning from the U.S. Army and vowing “save in the defense of my native State, I never desire again to draw my sword.”
• Contemporary newspapers relaying breaking news of the attack on Fort Sumter.
• The letter book of the Confederate Commissioners who were sent to Washington in 1861 to win recognition for the Confederacy.
• A detailed official report on the Battle of Manassas by the commanding Confederate general P.G.T Beauregard.

The result of over a year of thorough research and exploration, Burrell’s suite of music is Portraits of Civil War Heroes.  He will be performing the work at the opening of the exhibit on the evening of Wednesday, January 19 and a matinee on Saturday, January 22.

This is not the first time Burrell has worked with the Rosenbach on a cross-genre project, devoted to America’s past and their collection.  Four years ago, he was asked to compose music connected to their exhibition, “Slavery in the Americas.”  Burrell spent nearly a year researching the subject of slavery, looking at newspapers from the 18th and 19th centuries, with the result being a piece he called “Bill of Sale for a Slave.”  In addition to Burrell on piano, it featured two Nigerian drummers.  The response was so favorable that the Rosenbach then asked Burrell to be an artist-in-residence.  His next assignment was to write compositions on the poems of Marianne Moore and that was followed by a commission on the Western expansion of the United States. “Each project is a year long,” says Burrell.

For the current Civil War exhibit at the Rosenbach, Burrell wrote five compositions for piano and violin in the form of portraits of Civil War heroes, including John Brown (alive and dead), Robert E. Lee, Ulysses S. Grant and Elmer Ellsworth (the first man to die in the war).

Burrell clearly takes these commissions quite seriously in terms of research and preparation. “I hadn’t studied about the Civil War since high school and what I was able to do was to work with the excellent librarian, Elizabeth Ellen Fuller,” explains Burrell. “Elizabeth would come out of staff meetings and expose me to material in the reading room.  I stayed in the reading room two days a week for approximately six months and from my notes I would start developing motifs and concepts.  Myself, the librarian and the assistant director of education would throw the ideas back and forth.  They would come by my apartment, listen to my progress and make comments which I would then take very very seriously of course. And if anything needed to be collaborated on or if they felt something was extraordinarily good, we would continue from that point.”

Burrell is very much a modern jazz musician, who came up in the ‘6os avant garde era, alongside the likes of Ornette Coleman and Archie Shepp.  So how does a 20th or even 21st century jazz musician conjure up the personalities and lives of 19th century figures? “First I took from my own family history. My family was born in a little town in Ohio, but a lot of that family came from Kentucky on my mother’s side and on my dad’s side, from New Orleans and Alexandria, Louisiana and from Vicksburg, Mississippi.”

Burrell had to go beyond his own family background to get a real sense of the time, place and people. But it didn’t happen overnight. “After many many hours of research that was piling up on the left and in the center, I realized that I had my own thoughts and feelings-some of them pre-determined and many of them much needed to be expanded upon.  And then on the right, I had to figure out: How am I going to make this sound like it’s in fact a portrait of Elmer Ellsworth or a portrait of Robert E. Lee?  Well, after reading and interviewing and going up to the Historical Society of New York City and seeing the conditions and listening to the Civil War series from the great filmmaker, Ken Burns, I realized that the kind of chord structure that could be expanded on would be the kind of chord structure that’s basically a 1/4/5.  And I would put the violin in another key to have a distant motif of one of the buglers actually in the field-whether in the Union Army or in the Confederate Army-and have that dissonance in a rhythm of a march of that timeframe/time period.  So that was one approach.”

The figure of John Brown is one of the more complicated in this country’s history.  Martyr, visionary, lunatic, extremist…his role as catalyst has often been lost in the fog of the war that followed.  Burrell decided to get to the heart of the matter, literally.  “With John Brown’s hanging, I took his heartbeat as my central focus and from the heart beat came the lack of a heart beat.  I took into consideration the pros and cons of his hanging-the justices and the injustices that he had inflicted on Americans and I used the rhythms of hoofbeats.  I used the imagery of a rope swinging and so on. A lot of what is established in that kind of a portrait of a Civil War hero is the first the emulation of church fields and then that painful scenario of a public hanging.  By the time I had gotten three months into researching, I started actually to go to the piano with my motifs.”

Given the commission of “Portraits of Heroes,” Burrell was faced with having to narrow down the subjects in the face of a vast amount of material.  “Some of the heroes are very well-known while some of the others are less well-known.  The project was very interesting and revealing.  I was very honored and proud to be assigned to this project.  I’m actually now a lot better at it then when I started because now I can research it like a machine. When I first started, it was work, but now it’s very interesting to dive into any book about the Civil War.  For instance,  there was a book recommended to me about the music of the Civil War and how the blues came through the Civil War and was actually born through jazz and ragtime and how I could actually hear how that could be possible. It carried a lot more weight for me as a jazz musician and helped me with other areas of my international concert life.”

As an African-American and a native Northerner, it couldn’t be easy for Burrell to view the storied conflict with any objectivity.  The pianist and composer recognized that he had to look beyond his own heritage and his own values to musically represent those 19th century figures.  “Yes, I took that into consideration,” he confirms. “Many times I was shocked, surprised or even hurt personally. But professionally I realized that I wasn’t representing myself.  All of those feelings came to the surface. It was very emotional for me. Finally I said to myself, ‘Look, I’m not on either side-I’m researching…I’m looking at it from above and I’m looking down at both sides and I see the injustices of all wars.’ I was able to do that, although not immediately.  Thankfully I had support from some very giving and knowledgeable experts at the museum.”

Naturally, you can’t talk about the Civil War without talking about Abraham Lincoln, even if he isn’t one of the “heroes” portrayed in Burrell’s compositions. “I could hear stories about Lincoln’s power, about Lincoln’s feelings and about what they thought about him in a certain state.  And also why that conflicted with what I learned in high school. But I started from the very beginning and how he came out of the backwoods and became a lawyer and so on and ran for legislature in Illinois. I was very surprised that people didn’t like him in many instances and I started to see how it paralleled politics today.”

War is after all a sadly universal concept and Burrell eventually drilled down to that very tragic reality. “It went on and on-the reasons beyond the wars and the money that fuels the wars and the countries that were affected, not only the United States.  So I immediately stopped being thin-skinned to go on with my research and make portraits of Civil War heroes that could really be deeply truthful and acceptable to all Americans.”

As a Civil War buff myself, I can help but ask what revelations he may have had about those so-called heroes, as a result of his extensive research. “With Robert E. Lee, for example, I found out about the lineage of his family.  His family history was so rich and deep, going back to 5th and 6th century England.  Later the family spread out over Virginia and owned much of that state. And I learned how his father had been a hero before him and yet somehow ended up very much a disappointment in the eyes of the family.  So Robert had to come through all that-the pride and heritage that was so much more important to him than it seemed to be for Ulysses S. Grant, for example who never really dwelled on his family’s legacy. Everyone’s family had come basically from the same place and yet then had taken different turns.  There were differences and similarities with both of them going to West Point, with Lee becoming an engineer and Grant becoming a real soldier, during the Mexican War when they met for the first time. I was surprised to find out that Lee had even been asked by the White House to be the Commander-in-Chief for the Union Army.  But he couldn’t do that because of his pride and heritage. And of course, when the states started to secede, he knew exactly where this might lead.”

But in all his research Burrell also learned about the real-life men behind the headlines of history. “We forget that these statues and monuments and heroes are also human beings,” says Burrell. “But you see it clearly, when you read the letters back and forth from the families that the museum has preserved.”

Okay, enough talk about Civil War history.  This is a jazz magazine after all. Let’s talk about the music. How do you make music in this century about events in the 19th century?   “Before ragtime, blues, jazz and what eventually became labeled as gospel/spirituals, you had the marches and the European influence in the fiddle-something like what we’re now experiencing with one of America’s biggest and original gifts to the world.  I was really happy when I turned a corner. Having studied the music of Jelly Roll Morton a decade earlier and having the privilege to play at the Library of Congress and working with Anna Lomax, the daughter of Alan Lomax, I came to understand the way that the music of the Civil War evolved.  The strains and phrases and motifs in the musical sense were very interesting to me because the music that was played at the dances, before the young men went off to war. Say if you were up in Buffalo, you went to a dance and your young man was leaving, you’d dance all night to something that was very much a 32-bar waltz . You didn’t know if you were going to see him again when he went off as a volunteer with some company. And, the letters of the generals and the ranking officers that are in the Rosenbach’s collection were very revealing.”

Interestingly, Burrell has no specific plans to record all of this creative musical work.  In talking with him about the project, it becomes clear that he thinks only of the commission and the work at hand.  “The music is still very new. In many cases, I had written too much-it was a lot of fluff. Often I had to go back and listen and think: ‘Oh, this is going on too long a period of time – this is not necessary.’  For a portrait, I realized it should only be half that much.  Finally, it came to the point where I could call the violinist and have her come over and we would actually record it and listen to it and call the museum, sometimes over the telephone, with a motif for their approval.  I’ve enjoyed so much having been brought in to what often they already knew and yet were anxious to share with me because they saw I had such a passion for the work at hand.”

That passion on Burrell’s part led to a particular sort of enlightenment few musicians get to experience. “The takeaway on so many different levels is overwhelming and you don’t want to see the country do anything except prosper further,” says Burrell. “There are so many different sides to the passion.  As the centuries roll along, say, so many people are coming through with their new baggage and very few have the time or privilege to go back and see what we’re talking about in our conversation.”

Imagine trying to capture a war, a real war, with music.  Imagine what that really would sound like.  Burrell has done his best to do just that.  In the process he came to see that his background in avant garde music was an apt training ground for the cacophony of war. “It’s very significant for me to have a much stronger foundation. Sitting with the avant garde mindset it makes a lot more sense to me because there are avant garde solos within the context in these piece. Like the hoofbeats coming from a distance when they finally got to where they were surrounding the cavalry or the army.  And in some instances became deafening or the gunshots or the cannon.  The direct link and the imagery between music and what you want to extract from history and insert into the music was very revealing and a process that did not come very easily.”

The sound of brass and drums provided Burrell with a unique link between music and war. “I hadn’t thought about it in that way until I thought about the polytonality of the drum and bugle corps coming over the hill to announce that the army was right behind them.  War and music, especially in this war, went together like hand and glove.  You can imagine the cannon fire, the music, the shouting, the muskets, the terror and the emotions… the fear of the soldiers waiting in silence; waiting and hoping to succeed in an ambush or waiting to be massacred in many cases.  But how do you get that down into composition?”

Burrell drew upon his own past watching a friend go through the painstaking process of creating visual art, in order to understand how to construct these musical portraits. “When I was at Berklee College of Music in the early ’60’s, I had a friend in Boston who was in art school. I’d go over  to his place in the morning and I’d see him working on the anatomy of a human hand.  Later, I’d come back and see hundreds of balls of paper on the floor. They overflowed beyond the wastebasket where he was trying to perfect this hand that he had started early at breakfast.  I thought about that and realized that, well, okay, you just don’t get it the first time…you have to keep going.”

For this particular project, Burrell leaned heavily on the sound of a violinist-Odessa Balan-who collaborated with him every step of the way. “We had worked together at Temple University on a dance project. I thought this sound is good enough and interesting enough to be used on other projects.  She was very interesting then and even more so today.”

Even though a project like this involves such a large commitment of his time and focus, Burrell is grateful to the Rosenbach for the commission, which he believes furthers his own development as a creative musician and connects the dots between the other projects. “The Rosenbach Museum brought me a lot of closure on a lot of what I was looking at through the decades. They gave me an opportunity to really study the material deeply and build on some concepts that were just starting to get solidified at the beginning of this decade. It was a fascinating place for me to work as a jazz musician. I feel like I’ve come a long way over the last four years as a composer.”

So is pianist/composer Burrell now a pianist/composer/historian?  “I’d like to be thought of really as the first two. In order to be able to do these projects, I have to do research, but I don’t consider myself to be historian, at least in the way of the Ph.D. But if there’s enough trust in me as a composer to be able to present portraits of Civil War heroes and have the kind of feedback that I would like to get…well, I will be very satisfied after the upcoming concerts in January.”

The Rosenbach Museum & Library is located at 2008-2010 Delancey Place in Philadelphia and is open Tuesday through Sunday.

 On October 2, 2006, Katheryn Werner, the 16-year-old daughter of pianist Kenny Werner and his wife Lorraine, was driving home from her martial arts class not far from their home in upstate New York.  The young woman was killed when the car overturned on a nearby road. That’s a story with a tragic end. But for the pianist and his wife, it had to be the beginning of a new story, based on musical expression, collaboration with trusted friends and a strengthened marital bond.

A new album by Werner, No Beginning, No End, has been released on Half Note Records and features music inspired by that tragic accident. Werner wrote the large-scale work for voice, choir, wind ensemble, saxophone and jazz rhythm section and used his close friends-saxophonist Joe Lovano and his wife singer Judi Silvano-as pivotal voices in the music’s production.  Werner received a prestigious Guggenheim Fellowship award for Music Composition for No Beginning, No End and has hopes to present the suite live in a concert hall setting, appropriate to its sweep and grandeur.  It is arguably the most creatively ambitious project of Werner’s life and in the end its creation helped heal at least some of the wounds caused by that terribly traumatic time in his family’s life.
 Writing to Understanding

Although this piece of music was written in the wake of the tragedy, the initial assignment to write a large work had come much earlier. “I got the commission almost a year earlier,” says Werner. “It was simply to write a piece commemorating the 80th birthday of a major supporter of MIT’s arts programs, Bradford Endicott. My plan was to work on it in the fall because I also had a heavy playing schedule throughout the summer. And then in the fall, all this happened. It was left dormant because I couldn’t even think about it.”

The turning point came when Werner and his wife went to get away from their New York home and its memories, in the hope of some sort of rejuvenation or renewal.  Several months after the accident, some friends had given the couple an oceanside condo in Puerto Rico to stay for a few weeks and somehow recollect themselves. Naturally, it wasn’t so simple. “It was the first time we were alone,” he recalls. “Suddenly it hit us like a ton of a bricks, all over again, because we had had people all around us all the time until then. The first week we just slept. Every time we’d lift our heads, we’d see the ocean out there and our heads would fall back on the pillow. I’m not sure we even ate too much. We sat down on the couches and it was three or four days later when we finally got up. We were having a real hard time being in a vacation place being the only people who weren’t vacationing.”

Indeed, vacationing, at least of the resort variety, was not really in the cards for Werner and his wife at that time. Yet Werner feels that the couple’s spiritual practices enabled them to somehow get beyond their mourning to some sort of stage of, if not acceptance, then action, particularly for the pianist who had music as an outlet of expression. “As time went on, we meditated and chanted and did things that we’ve been doing for years now. That’s when it began to elevate my consciousness. In the middle of this pain, there would be these odd moments of inspiration.  Seeing the whole thing in a different way. And in one of those moments, I wrote the poem ‘No Beginning, No End.’ And that’s when it all unfolded for me. I would write lyrics based on some of the words in that poem, I’d have Judi sing it, because it was already a commission featuring Joe. And I would make her be the root or the Sa, as they say in Indian music, or the pedal, what I think of as the truth. And everything else would swirl around it. That’s how I got the template for the piece. The most sedate factor is Judi and everything else is moving emotionally or violently and that’s how it all unfolded.”

In listening to the very powerful music, one can’t help but hear that the vocal passages are offset by a singular voice of a different kind-the saxophone of Joe Lovano, whose playing is both powerful and expressive throughout. “He can’t be anything but expressive,” states Werner. “The great thing about writing for Joe Lovano is that I know his playing so well as a result of our collaboration since around 1970. Parts of those things particularly in the third and fourth movements are almost all written, but they still sound just like Joe playing. The reason they had to be written is that they intersect with the composition. You don’t feel a tempo, you just feel like a wind is blowing. He lands where they land. In order for that to happen, I had to write specifically what I wanted, but I still wanted it to sound like him. As easy as he makes it sound, it was actually quite tricky to play these complicated lines and land where he’s supposed to land, without a conductor. He played so expressive, that you can’t tell that (a) it’s difficult, and (b) it’s not just him blowing.  Which is exactly the effect I wanted.”

Because he hadn’t made much progress on the earlier commission and because he was unable to really focus on writing in the immediate aftermath of the accident, Werner had very little time to create this large work, which shifted from focusing on an MIT professor to dealing with his daughter’s sudden death. “Once I decided that this is the piece I was going to do, I had basically a month to write a piece I had been commissioned to do a year ago,” he says. “Out of necessity, I was pretty much writing day and night. If I was doing a gig, I would go back to my hotel room and write. There was no other option. And it was quite raw, because I was giving it to Fred Harris the conductor and he was trying to figure it out. There was no time to contemplate. I knew what I wanted.”

Things moved quickly once he set pen to paper, as much by necessity as anything, but that had its own reward. “I just had to get a raw version of it out,” Werner says. “I started writing in late February and they had to start rehearsing sometime in March. A raw version of this piece was done on May 6 or May 7. The mere fact that I was writing day and night kind of brought me out of my dark place. Of course it was cathartic. I think it was mostly cathartic to hear it at the concert at MIT. Then it all came together. Even in its raw form people were stunned by the piece and really affected by the piece and not just the reason for it, but it’s probably the most powerful music I’ve ever written, just as music.”
 Going on Record

Shortly after the concert, Werner played the music from the performance for Jeff Levenson, the longtime jazz industry exec and head of the Half Note Records label.  Most of the projects on that label are live recordings from the NYC Blue Note club, with which the label is associated. Nonetheless, Levenson took the creative and business leap and agreed to record the project, which promised to be the largest in scope and logistics in the label’s history. “The composition he did struck me as very large and significant,” explains Levenson, “coupled with the fact that it was born out of this most human of tragedies, the death of his daughter. So I either bravely or foolishly said that, ‘We have to do this, we have to figure out a way to do this.’ And that’s how the recording began.”

Indeed the project’s scope provided a tremendous challenge to the small label and its resources. “It was an unwieldy beast keeping in mind that the budgets we normally work with do not allow us to do master projects involving 100 musicians.” The project benefited from the help of two more allies of Werner-Dave Schroeder, head of the jazz program at New York University, where Werner is also an adjunct professor, and Rich Shemaria, a composer, arranger and educator, also at NYU.  Schroeder and Shemaria enlisted the help of students, faculty and musicians from all over the city to help make up the large ensemble, which included a 37-piece wind ensemble, string quartet, vocal choir and various instrumentalists. “They started calling people and inviting musicians to participate in this project, calling in favors,” explains Levenson.  “Out of the universe of musicians in New York, including kids who attend Julliard, Manhattan School of Music or NYU, some pros and amateurs, we assembled the cast of characters to perform Kenny’s music.” In addition, Schroeder arranged to record the project at NYU’s Frederic Lowe Theater, in order to capture the large and complex sound of this huge ensemble of musicians.

Apparently there were many factors involved in getting a community to come together to support Werner, including genuine respect for the work and its creator. But Levenson also sees the original inspiration for the piece as a critical factor in bringing people together. “The most noteworthy aspect of that part of the process was that everyone felt empathetic with the story. They understood that this was a project born out of great great tragedy and they wanted to participate. So the issue of money was fundamentally a non-issue. We were able to get people to really volunteer themselves in the service to getting this music recorded. And that extends to the musicians, the engineers, the filmmaker and everyone else who worked for either no bread or very modest bread to make it all happen.”

Further illustrating the community and family elements of this project, the album was recorded and mixed by the noted jazz recording engineer Paul Wickliffe, head of Skyline Productions, and who also has a close longtime relationship with the pianist. Wickliffe is married to singer Roseanna Vitro, who has performed and recorded with Werner, and the couple were like aunt and uncle to Werner’s daughter.
 A Different Way of Playing

For Werner, the author of several musical instruction books and a learning system called Effortless Mastery, the music is always greatest when it unfolds naturally and organically by getting inside the piece. “There’s a level where you go beyond playing it well, it plays itself. Once it plays itself, it comes to life. And for me, that’s where music begins. It’s not an option or a peak moment, that’s where it must begin.”

Werner is known as a great piano player, yet in this work, arguably his most affecting, Kenny Werner the piano player is not the focus for the piece.  If you’re looking for pianistic chops, you’ll want to check out some other recording. Werner recognizes that shift and believes it reflects his own growth as a creative musician. “I had been moving in that direction. That showing off of chops is so meaningless to me that I’m afraid I’ve been going more in the other direction. Even in my quintet records, people have said to me, ‘Jeez, you don’t dominate it’ and that’s because I’m more interested in the environment for the music. I share Miles’ vision of being more into the environment that you created and the mystique of that environment than in focusing on your own playing.  I just did a solo record that will be out soon, coming out in France, and the whole record is like that. I was surprised. I had some virtuosic stuff I recorded but when it came time to pick the cuts, I didn’t pick any of it. Instead I just picked stuff that just had this inner connection and I don’t know whether that’s a progressive thing, but all I know is that, in general, that kind of inner connection has all the meaning. That whole proving ground has zero meaning to me.”

Lately entering a zone beyond that competitive and demonstrative proving ground, Werner considers Herbie Hancock an effective role model for playing the piano. “Herbie is like Frank Sinatra to me,” Werner says emphatically. “I appreciate him more as I get older. His recent stuff is so wise, it’s like the very Zen philosophy he subscribes to. Sometimes, hearing him play solo piano is like watching a few leaves blow. Talk about someone that’s completely unconcerned with technique and showing off, but rather with just allowing the current of life to flow through him and manifest in music. That sure describes Herbie and Wayne Shorter.  I was talking with Chris Potter about this. Both of us could not conceal our amazement over what Wayne does with a few notes.  We both know that no matter fast we can play we cannot get close to that level of wisdom. With Herbie, I just think to myself when I hear him, you just have to be 70 to play like that.”

As great a work as this album seems, it clearly is not something that could be easily duplicated live, what with the choir, string section, distinctive sax and so on. Or could it? “It is possible to perform it live. We’re going to try and find the proper venue. It’s easier to do it locally because there’s a whole choir that’s already learned it and a whole wind ensemble that already learned it. And the string quartet could also make it. We are going to propose it for other places, but it may have to be on a classical program as just the wind piece or various school programs if they wanted to motivate their choir and their wind ensemble.  But in New York, I hope we do it in a major way. There we could do it all. To me that is a concert. You start with the wind ensemble piece, then you go to the choir, then the string quartet and then the coda. If we needed another set, perhaps Joe and I could play some duets.”

Listening to the opening section can be tough going if you know the back-story. Werner confirms that its intensity is a direct reflection of the accident and its effect. “Yes,” says Werner. “The way Joe, Judi and I are improvising at the very beginning is sort of a high, active, light-filled space. She [his daughter Katheryn] was in a very inspired state that day. The place where we do our spiritual practices, she got to spend time there every day. She was flying.” In a moment that he can never and will never forget, Werner talked by phone from California with his daughter that day.  And thankfully, it was neither a negative nor a superficial conversation. “I had a rare privilege of talking to my daughter the morning of that day,” he recalls, fondly. “She was telling me all this good stuff that was going on. And I finally got quiet and said, ‘You know, this is what I envisioned for you when we moved up here [upstate New York].’ She just quietly went, ‘Thank you, Dad.’ Those were the last words she ever said to me. That was very complete in our terms of communication.”

Werner says that her mental and emotional state that day set the tone for the beginning of the piece, which goes from flighty to intense to contemplative in a short span. “That state she was in…she was buzzing. That’s what I tried to create in the first part. The next thing that happens is the accident. For Joe’s playing, rather than musical markers on my piece, I put emotional prompting there, like a script for an actor. On Joe’s piece, it said, ‘After you hear this explosion, you’ve thrust into a web of angels and you’re confused.’ That was Joe’s instruction. From there it settles down and that’s where a guide takes Kathryn’s hands and begins to explain to her the universe and death, transition and life. The first movement is very much about that wisdom.  You know, sometimes they say you should tell a story with a piece. I’ve never been much for that. I kind of write from chaos and then I keep removing things until it sounds like there’s a story. This time I was telling a story. There’s no question about it.”
 Setting A New Standard

As the father of a teenaged daughter, talking with Werner was no easy task. After all, there is something rather special about the relationship between a father and daughter. Freudian psychology aside, it’s not something anyone can easily explain. “I know it’s historically like that-father-daughter and mother-son,” Werner says. “I don’t know why either. But it certainly worked that way in my family. The piece is very special for two reasons. One is the story that prompted the piece and the other thing is that it’s the strongest piece of art I’ve ever created.  It sets a new standard for me.”

Werner is clear that his new standard is about more than writing tunes to blow over or even reinventing jazz standards. “It’s always been one of my goals to get away from an art form and get it so personal that it’s just your own inner urge, to quote Joe Henderson.  I think I’ve been getting closer to that all my life. The closer I get to it, the more powerful my music is, not in cultural terms, but in emotional terms for the people who listen. This one went way beyond that. We have to see where I go next.”

But where does he go? Creating a major work like this begs the question for just about any artist: Where do you go from here?   In the case of Werner, he has created a masterpiece of composition based on the deepest and most traumatic event of his life. How does he move on musically from that?  “To tell you the truth, the thought of retirement has been half-kidding and half-not,” he says, chuckling. “The half-kidding is because that’s how I make my living. The half-not-kidding is that I’d be totally happy to recluse at this point and just study, instead of perform. All of my favorite musicians are more enthusiastic about what they’re studying, than by what they’re performing. Because it’s the constant growth that makes you feel young. I’m not conscious of age because every time I can do something new on the piano that I couldn’t do before, I get that same kick I had when I was twenty and that happened. It’s the same thing with writing. The place where I have the most space to grow is in the technical ability of orchestrating. To me that’s more of a technical expertise than it is just expression. That’s where I need the most amount of work. I’d be happy to spend the rest of my life trying to write orchestration of my own pieces on a higher and higher level”

Inspiring her father to write more sophisticated and intricate music is one of Katheryn Werner’s legacies. But finding a theme or focus will no doubt be a challenge as it would be for any father who has lost a daughter. Regardless, Werner knows that he wants to do more now than play standards. “That’s where I wanted to go originally, but I got way sidetracked.  The fact is: I will have to go on. Where do I go from here? I actually have a commission to write a concerto for piano and saxophone for a Danish orchestra in 2011. It won’t go anywhere near emotionally where it was, but I have to find a new topic and I have to be generally interested in the topic. That’s what different. I don’t want to make a piece of jazz or a piece of classical music. I don’t even want to make a piece of art. I just want to express something that has actual meaning for me as a human being. I know I have to go that way from now on. You cannot go back from there.”

For his part, Levenson prefers to accept the magnitude of the work in hand and not be too concerned about what Werner will do next. “The thing that captures my imagination is not so much where he goes from here, but what this project  represents,” says Levenson. “He’s always been regarded by musicians as a very advanced player and conceptualizer and thinker. He’s kind of the musician’s musician, a guy who operates on an extremely high level of authority among his peers.  Here, confronted with the creative challenge of how to repair himself emotionally, he creates what many people consider to be a masterwork. Those people in my immediate circle include Dave Liebman, Lee Konitz, Maria Schneider, Gil Goldstein and Randy Brecker, and all of whom have weighed in and heralded this piece as a significant creative milestone for Kenny and for us all. I don’t know where Kenny goes from here, other than that he has now been tested and he’s obviously risen to the challenge. He has made this great leap from piano player to composer. The nature of the work he composed is extremely serious and it represents a hybrid of sorts. It’s a symphonic work that utilizes jazz.”

Indeed, Levenson says that the project’s hybrid nature creates problems both good and bad for Half Note as marketers of the recording. “I submitted it for Grammy consideration in 22 categories and that alone underscored the challenge involved in marketing or selling this thing, but also as far categorizing it.  It’s symphonic, it’s classical, it’s jazz, it’s composed, it’s improvised. It’s a work that defies easy categorization and discussion. That’s a wonderful challenge for us to have, but at the same time it makes it a little difficult for people to absorb the magnitude of it because it’s so different.”
 A Daughter’s Legacy

Still very much a proud father, Werner doesn’t hesitate for a second when asked to talk about his daughter and her unique qualities.  It seems that the apple didn’t fall too far from the creative tree in this case. “She had started on piano, but she was playing guitar. She had been writing songs for awhile, but her songs were just starting to get really good. She’s got influences from early Joni Mitchell. Her early records were among my wife’s and my favorite music. She is a bigger influence on me than most jazz musicians, in fact.”

According to Werner, music was just one facet of this gifted young woman, who at a young age seemed to embody a deeper level of understanding. “She was also into writing. She had a lot of writings. I don’t know if I’ll ever put them out, but we had gathered them. The wisdom she was gathering already at this age, it also made us to understand why she was ready to go. Because she was expressing stuff that I know that I have had to try to learn all my life. I carried so much baggage to try to undo to learn this wisdom. For her, she didn’t have the baggage. She was already clear. For example, she thought that joy was service. And most kids don’t get to that, but the particular thing [spiritual practice] we follow, we learn that. Of course, I believe that, but I had so much baggage of self-centeredness that you have to peel the onion to get to that pure thought. She was grown into that thought. That’s why I was so happy she was near that wisdom. She was very wise and very articulate.”

Her talents ranged even farther than music and writing. “Her main passion besides music was photography. We still hope to do a show of her photography at some point, but there’s so much to organize. But she really had a great eye and a great imagination for photography. She was a very can-do person. Always helpful. Even when she was in kindergarten, she would try to help the other kids with whatever they were doing. I just wish I could have seen what she could have done with all that talent and decisiveness and not being afraid and genuine concern for other people. She embodied the best elements of us. My wife is the best humanitarian I know. And I am talented and clever. My daughter embodied both of these things. She had beautiful talent, and she was funny, but she had a real commitment to humanity that she got from her mother.”

Losing a child is perhaps the single most difficult thing for a marriage, but Werner says that in the case of his wife and himself, it brought them closer in the face of a trauma unimaginable for most parents.  “There is a very high percentage of people that divorce after something like this happens. I think the choices are that you lose touch with each other through the grief or the blame or whoever knows why, or you grow closer together than ever and that’s what happened with Lorraine and I. We share a bond that we’ll never share with anybody else: the creation of this child, the co-loving of this child and the loss of this child. I see her [his wife] now like I used to see my daughter. Anything that will make her life happy is what I’m committed to doing. We formed a stronger bond than ever fortunately.”

Perhaps what is most incredible is Werner’s contention that his eventual acceptance of the tragedy and loss wasn’t so unique or exceptional. “Everybody says, ‘I can’t imagine how you got through it.’ But you, God forbid, if it had happened to you, would have gotten through it and anybody else would. You just don’t know that unless something like that happens to you. It’s no heroics of any one person for getting through it. Anybody that has to gets through it. But you would never know that if you didn’t have to and, of course, God willing, you will never have to.”

After all he had been through emotionally and intellectually, Werner says that seeing the piece performed live had a very deep effect on him. “I was strangely like a spectator. It was almost like I wasn’t there and I was looking at the effect of all this. I realized that I’m empty in a good way for the first time in a long time. I’ve made my expression of grief here. And have, at least for a minute, peace.”

We can all hope that this project marks an end to his acute grief and the beginning of a new level of creative composition.  That would be a story worth reading and hearing. In the meantime, we can see much of this project on film, thanks to serendipitous involvement by Soren Jensen. The Danish filmmaker initially planned to shoot a documentary film about Werner and his teaching methods, but shifted to focus on No Beginning, No End.  He filmed Werner throughout much of the recording and performing stages of this recording and did interviews as well. You can preview footage here and learn more about the entire project.

 Kermit Ruffins is walking and talking. He’s speaking on the phone about his new album Happy Talk and other matters, while he makes his way through the French Quarter of New Orleans, heading for a soundcheck. At least a half dozen times, he has to interrupt the conversation to respond warmly to people greeting him. He invites a few to his gig, telling them “Come on by!” I tease him that he might as well run for mayor of the city. He laughs and says that if elected, it would be a very short term. “If I do become mayor one day, I’ll be fired right away, because I’ll be having festivals three times a day,” he says. “I’d have stages set up all over the city with free concerts that never stop until midnight. Yea, I’d be out of there within a day.”

Perhaps it’s better that Ruffins stays out of politics, despite a rising Q rating thanks to a recurring cameo role on Treme, the acclaimed HBO television series produced by David Simon, who also created The Wire.  Ruffins is unabashed in his appreciation for what the series has done for the city and the music. “Thank God for David Simon.  David told me about six years ago that he was trying to do this TV series.  Then that damn Katrina happened.”

Ruffins is a consultant to the series and he says he takes that role very seriously and is often suggesting story ideas to the writers and producers. “I just jot down ideas and hand them to the writers,” he explains. “Or if I get an idea in the middle of the night, I might leave it on their voice mail. Some story that happened after the storm.”

Although he’s quick to acknowledge the way Treme has affected New Orleans and the local music scene, Ruffins sees the series as having a larger impact on how jazz is perceived in American culture. “I’m interviewed a lot and they always ask me, ‘What can we do to get this music like it used to be before R&B and other music took over?’  Jazz used to be the only music in the world with hits. I always answer, ‘Put it on TV every day. Put the music on TV every day.’ And sure enough, it happened.”

Ruffins, who first started in the music world as a street musician in various brass bands, was a founding member of the Rebirth Brass Band.  He was just 17 in the summer before his senior year in high school when he formed the group with some friends. The group had more of a street feel and Ruffins believes that contributed to their influence later among younger players.  “Thanks to the Rebirth and the Dirty Dozen, all these young musicians have formed brass bands because we made it look a little cool, compared to the old guys wearing the old uniforms. And we started playing different music. And the younger guys jumped all over it like nothing. There are so many brass bands in the city it’s ridiculous.”

A completely self-taught musician, Ruffins is a little jealous that the younger musicians have received better musical training, at least formally, than he did. “There are so many music schools with kids being taught the real way to play, compared to when I grew up, when I didn’t have piano lessons. I learned how to read music, but I never learned about chord changes and theory and all that. These kids now are learning all that at nine, ten or eleven years old.”

Nonetheless, the trumpeter and singer revels as the host of a spirited engagement at Vaughan’s every Thursday night. I asked Ruffins to describe the weekly scene at the gig, which is one part concert, one part dance party and one part BBQ. “Imagine coming up to this place, looks like this ‘needle’ in the heart of the 9th Ward, a real neighborhood area,” he starts. “You see all these people standing outside and inside, lined up and waiting to see the show. Tourists, locals, musicians that aren’t working that night are all hanging. The red beans and rice is brewin’ in the back. Right at show time, the band cranks up nice and strong and everybody’s dancing their butts off for about an hour and forty-five minutes, maybe two hours, for the first set. Right at the break, some good old fresh red beans and rice is always guaranteed. Sometimes I’ll bring my barbecue grill and smoke it out, depending on the weather and how I woke up that morning. We have that long break, what we call the meet and greet break.  Hanging out with everybody. Then we do a second set that goes about 2:00 or 2:30 am.”

In New Orleans, music and food are like religion, it seems. And with his BBQ gigs, Ruffins gets to preach the gospel in both areas on a regular basis. At first in response to the question of who the best cook is in his family, he struggles to choose. “Between my auntie and my mom, both of them cook their butts off,” he says. “I think I’m the best cook overall as far as wild foods, Italian food, seafood, barbecue…”  And Ruffins explains that he learned from more than the women in his family. “I hung out with a lot of chefs down here in New Orleans. They gave me a lot of tips. I hung out at Maximo’s Italian Grill all the time. They taught me how to cook with that high heat. Sear it and pop it in the oven with the olive oil and red pepper and garlic.”

Ruffins also struggles at first to name his best dish as a cook. “Probably a good pot of gumbo or a good pot of beans,” he says eventually. “But my favorite grill food is quail.  I can put like 50 quails on my grill. I have a grill that’s about 12 to 15 feet long. I got it from Atlanta about a year and a half ago. I could even put about 70 quails on that thing if I want.”

Ruffins says that because of the area’s rich diversity, the barbecue style of New Orleans is not easily categorized. “Everybody’s so different down here in New Orleans when it comes to barbecuing, to the point where it’s hard to give it one unique thing. But I think that that the hot sausage on the grill is a New Orleans thing. I think I kinda kicked that off. Nobody was putting hot sausage on the grill until about 15 years ago. There was one guy out there – me – barbecuing every Sunday at the second lines only because I had my kids on the truck and I just wanted to make sure they had a bit to eat. Before you know it, now we have 20 trucks lined up doing barbecue before second lines.”

In recent years, Ruffins has moved his own music beyond that of brass bands, performing a more swinging and traditional style of jazz, perhaps more aligned to those of the second lines.  On the new album, Ruffins leads his group, the aptly-named Barbecue Swingers, playing an assortment of pop covers, standards and originals, all with a classic Bourbon street sound.  He says that the seeds for this shift were sown many years ago, not just on the streets of New Orleans, but on the small screen. “I was hooked on those black and white videos of Armstrong, Lionel Hampton, Duke Ellington, Dizzy, Monk.  Me and the Rebirth guys would watch that stuff all day long.  All of a sudden I was in Europe on stage in Nice watching Miles Davis perform and watching Lionel Hampton and watching Ray Charles.  Around 1985 through 1987 I was watching them on videos and then in 1989, I was sitting next to them on a tour bus going to the show.”

Since Ruffins left Rebirth, he has built a solo career based on his own talent and personality.  He says that he didn’t know he’d be successful, but that he knew he was ready to try to put his own stamp on traditional jazz.  “I figured if you want something real bad, because I wanted to do what I was seeing in those black and white videos and be able to do what I was seeing in the French Quarter in New Orleans [with the traditional jazz bands].  All those great trumpet players in their suits and ties, with the string bass and drums and the piano. I knew it would be a good chance because no young kids would be thinking like that. I really wanted to do that more than anything. I’d be playing for tips outside on Bourbon Street, I’d always be staring at those guys inside with the suits on playing that traditional music. I was already hooked on that music along with the brass band music. It just seemed more controllable almost. This is something I could do for a long long time. I just kinda jumped on it.”

Listening to the current album with its mix of swinging trumpet and ebullient vocals, it’s obvious that Louis Armstrong has been a big influence on Ruffins, who doesn’t deny the power of the New Orleans-born singer/trumpeter who took his music all over the world. “Nobody will ever be able to play on that technical level again. I definitely admire his spirit as being super happy onstage and being excited to perform. I think that’s what happened with him. He knew exactly what he was doing. He played on the highest technical level ever, and he played with the most spirit too, so it’s crazy.”

During a visit to Armstrong’s house in Queens, Ruffins noticed that the legendary trumpeter and he share an obsession with documenting their own lives in music. At home and on the road, Armstrong would record his thoughts and memories on reel-to-reel tapes. “I’m crazy like that with videoing,” notes Ruffins. “I have stacks of videos.  I can totally understand how he’d record like that.”

Also, very much in the spirit of Armstrong, Ruffins last year released a Christmas album, that included a track called “All I Want for Christmas (Is the Saints in the Super Bowl)” in which he begs the hometown team to make his holiday bright.  It turns out that the song initially was about something entirely different. “That tune was called ‘Let’s Take the Party to My House.’  Something crazy about Santa Claus wanting reefer. And Mark Samuels [of Basin Street Records] was, ‘Kermit, we want to make sure this is a family record.’ It was the middle of July or August and the Saints were about to start training camp. I was watching TV and they were showing the Saints training camp and I said ‘ah-hah!’ So I sat down and in about five minutes I had the words to the song. I got back to the studio, two hours after I wrote it and I told the producer Tracey Freeman, who is a big Saints fan like me, ‘Tracey, I got something for you.’  We watch all the games together. Everybody was excited. I said, ‘What if they win?'”  And, of course, they did, dispatching the Indianapolis Colts in a Super Bowl upset that sent the city into an epic celebration.

So, Nostradamus, who you got this year?  “I think the Saints are going back again. All our best players are on the bench and about seven weeks from now they’ll be out there in cold flesh.  They’ll be the freshest team in the league. All our starters will be brand new.”  Well, hope springs eternal.

Food, music, football, family…Ruffins lives and breathes the city and confesses that he finds it hard to stay away from The Big Easy for long stretches.  In fact, the longest time he was away was after Katrina when he went to Houston for four months. “I came back in January 2006,” he explains. “I wanted to get right back because my wife was going to have a baby in April and we wanted to make sure we had the baby in New Orleans.”  He goes on to explain that one way he makes sure that he’s not away too long is by charging a premium on gigs outside his hometown. “And if they say, yes, then I go.  I’ll be glad to go as often I can, but when we tell them my price, everybody turns us down.”

Given the impact of Treme, that out-of-town premium may soon cease to be an obstacle for more extensive touring outside the Big Easy.  Who knows?  Maybe he’ll even be able to bring those big old barbecue grills with him.  Now that would be a tour to follow.

 Jazz bassist and educator Dr. Lou Fischer is not afraid to use the F-word when talking about the music on his latest recording.  The album, Morning Walk, has been released on Summit Records, features a band called High Time, co-led by drummer Ndugu Chancler and they play “fusion” with a capital F.  Although the genre has taken its knocks from those critics and fans who find the chops-oriented approach off-putting, Fischer doesn’t see the word or the genre as a bad thing at all. “Fusion to me represents a juxtaposition of any and all genres of music,” says the 58-year-old bassist. “In the broadest sense, we play fusion music any time we play jazz.   Even in straight-ahead jazz, there’s a fusion of all elements-classical, African traditions and rhythms, Brazilian music.”

Of course, in that general sense, few people would have a problem with the genre, but what us jazz people are talking about when we talk about “Fusion” is something much more specific. We’re referring to the genre that evolved from the jazz-rock of the 70s to the contemporary jazz of the 80s and then split into either easy-going Smooth Jazz or the high-octane shredding of modern fusion. “Within the fusion genre of jazz, sure, we put those labels on,” says Fischer. “Going back to its beginnings, it all became electric.  Initially it started on acoustic bass and moved to electric bass. And it started with a multitude of keyboards and then it transitioned to one keyboard with all sorts of setting.  Yes, it’s electric and a fusion with rock elements. There’s still traditional Western harmony based.  I really think it’s groove-based more than anything.”

In his job as professor of music and jazz studies area coordinator at Capital University in Columbus, Ohio, Fischer even teaches fusion from all the different eras to his students. “We have a fusion ensemble here at Capital University. What I do with them is select a piece from each iconic group from within the genre from 1970.  We look at the mainstays of the initial era-Return to Forever, Weather Report, Mahavishnu Orchestra-and then on to the ’80s and ’90s and present.”

As one of the founders of the Jazz Education Network, Fischer himself is generally seen as a straight-ahead jazz player, but there’s more to him than his stature and most recent recordings. In fact, like many baby-boomer jazz fans and musicians, Fischer grew up with a strong affinity for the early progenitors of the genre. “I grew up in Texas so we knew all about the Jazz Crusaders.  I just loved their music.  I heard about them because of the R&B connection they had in the ’60s.  They figured if they dropped that bad word ‘jazz’ that they’d sell more records.  Joe Sample told me they went from selling 40,000 to 400,000 as soon as they dropped it.  And the music didn’t change.  Just the moniker.”

Indeed, the legacy of the Crusaders looms large in Fischer’s professional and personal life. Fischer’s new group can even be traced to his connection to that noted band. “Because they’re a groove-based band, I’ve always loved that group. Ndugu and I got together because of the connection to the Crusaders.  We were both in the group, though at different times. I was in the band during the Streetlife tour around 1979-1980.  Ndugu came in after that, replacing Stix Hooper.  We both had that connection but we hadn’t played together in that style. We played Latin, Afro-Cuban, big band and straight-ahead stuff but never fusion.  I said, ‘Hey, man, why don’t we go back to our roots and do something together.’  That’s how the album materialized.  I got some tunes, you got some tunes.” And suddenly, it was back to the 70s, except with shorter hair, thicker waistlines and families.

Pat Coil, the pianist in the group, worked with Carmen McRae for many years, but it was his time with the Woody Herman band that brought him together with Fischer way back in 1976.  After a nearly year-long stint on the road with Herman, the two decided to form an original jazz-rock band.  It was called High Rise.  Hey, it was the ’70s after all.  “It started out as a group of four, but it later turned into six pieces,” recalls Fischer.  “We almost signed to Inner City.  We were four guys who came from Woody Herman’s band.  Steve Houghton, Pat Coil, myself and a tenor player named Pete Brewer.”

Fischer says that they were all studio session players in Dallas and that they got together as a band in order to an outlet away from both the big band jazz they’d played on the road with Herman and the pop music they were playing in the studio. “As much as we loved playing in Woody’s band, after doing it every night for eight months, you want to get away from that for awhile. We wanted an outlet for our original music. We did a couple fairly experimental albums.” The group played together from 1976 through 1979, and played all over the Southwest.

Naturally, like virtually all jazz-rock musicians of that era, the band members sported very long hair.  How long was his hair?  “Pretty long.  My hair was about two inches below the neck, yep. It could easily be that now, but ….  It was part of the thing then.”

Also part of the thing was plugging in while still staying faithful to the spirit of jazz improvisation. “I played both electric and acoustic in the band.  I had a whole rack of pedals.  We were experimenting with sounds. Our woodwind guy doubled on six or seven instruments.  We didn’t cover anything.  We did all our own original stuff.  We added two instruments that were unique to us.  One was a steel guitar and the other was a percussionist.  We were working towards synthesizing or fusing folk music with what we were doing.  At some point Columbia were interested but they had Weather Report.”

Fischer recalls one performance by the group when they noticed the members of Weather Report outside the glass windows of the club, looking in.  Shorter, Zawinul and company came in and hung with the young guys from Texas.  Jaco Pastorius was with the group at that time, and so Fischer says that it was a real thrill for him and the entire band to meet and hang out with some of the great innovators of the genre.

The bass tradition in fusion is storied and in many ways the bassist helped define the genre, and in turn the genre’s popularity brought players like Stanley Clarke, Jaco Pastorius and Alphonse Johnson to a higher profile. Fischer says that back in the day he felt no undue pressure coping with that legacy. “I started on electric and moved to acoustic when I went to college.  I don’t remember ever consciously thinking about all that.  I do remember thinking that I don’t want to sound like someone else. Everyone strives to develop a signature of some sort. I’ve always heard melody real well. I hear all the parts of the music, not just the bass part. I’ve always been a composer in my approach to music. I think Mingus was that way.  You hear it in his playing.  I’d like to hope that people hear that compositional nature in my playing.”

Shortly after Fischer moved to Los Angeles in 1979, he was hired to play with the Crusaders. “My first concert with them was at the Hollywood Bowl with the Los Angeles Philharmonic behind us. I’m 26 years old and my first concert with them was playing with them at the Hollywood Bowl with Noel Pointer as conductor.  Alphonse Johnson played a tune with us.  I walk out on stage and look out at this crowd of 20,000 people and I wondered, how did this happen. We played that first tune and the crowd came alive, clapping and stomping their feet. Talk about connecting with an audience. That’s when it hit me how important the groove is.  I’ve never lost sight of that even when I’m playing with jazz.”

And that appreciation for the groove was one of the factors that connected Fischer and Chancler. “When you’re playing fusion, it becomes about the groove.  It’s not like my favorite bebop drummers don’t have a groove, it’s just a different kind of groove.  When Ndugu and I play bebop, it’s a different kind of groove. This group High Time evolved from that desire to play that kind of groove with him.  When I told him, he said, let’s do it.  I introduced him to Pat [Coil] and Fred [Hamilton].”  And a new fusion band was formed, this time with older and presumably wiser members.

Fischer decided to bring the group together for the festival he oversees each year: the  Capital University Jazz & World Music Festival, held in April of every year.  “I said, ‘Let’s just go into the studio and see what happens.’ And magic happened.” The group did not recycle old material from earlier projects, but rather performed all new material. “Each guy brought three pieces to the session and we listened to them all and did the ones we could. We basically went into the studio from 10 am until about 4 pm and did half of them, did a gig that night at the festival and then came back the next day and recorded for a full day.”

And what’s with the groovy band names-High Rise and now High Time?  You know, making references to the effect of illicit substances that were cool in the 70s doesn’t seem like such a good idea for a bunch of middle-aged guys with mortgages, jobs and grown children.  Fischer says that I got it all wrong. “We were kicking around a lot of titles.  I liked the title ‘High Time,’ because I thought it’s high time we revisit our roots.  It’s high time we pulled this together.  I miss it.”

Fischer says that the group was also encouraged by the response from the students who attended the festival.  “The students around here loved the group.  The music was fresh.” Perhaps one of the reasons for that response was because it was fresh to the players themselves who didn’t have the luxury of endless rehearsals and did the recording and performance somewhat on the spot. “The beauty of the album is the music is original.  It was fresh to everyone; nobody knew it but the composer. We talked for five or ten minutes about the song and then recorded it.  It’s not like we took the group out on a tour for six or eight months.  But I often felt that with fusion you sometimes fell into that trap where the improvisational elements weren’t there any more.  It became programmatic.  This music is totally improvisational, even though, just like bebop, there’s a framework you’re working with. “

Fischer is having a good time, but it’s not like he’s planning to quit his day job as educator and hop back into the van like it’s 1978 all over again. They all are, after all, men of a certain age.  However, he’s open to the group doing shows when it can work for all concerned.  “We’re all educators.  We all travel around doing festivals.  If we can get some gigs playing together doing this, then that will be even more fun. Mainly we did it just because we had the urge to do it.”

One of the misconceptions about jazz educators that they live in a protective bubble obsessed with pedagogy and the past, but in fact those educators are exposed to younger audiences a lot more than most jazz musicians. As a jazz educator, Fischer deals with young audiences all the time.  What do they think of 70s era fusion?  “What they really do react to is groove-based material,” he answers. “They’ll all react to the mix of the record.  They can hear the differences between early and late Weather Report.  And Heavy Weather still sounds good.  Though the drum sound has changed. What they gravitate to is the energy level.  And that energy level is one of the reasons those groups were so powerful. If the groove or vibe is there, it’s going to capture people.”

In the jazz program at Capital, Fischer says they try to expose the kids to virtually every genre of jazz that’s out there.  He thinks it’s critical for their long-term success. “I find that our students embrace all the different things that we unfold before them.  We have a fusion band, a world music band, a MIDI band, a jazz percussion ensembles, a rock ensemble.  We have all these ensembles because we purposely want to make sure that the musicians when they leave here can survive in the industry. You might think you know what you want to do when you’re in college, but you don’t.”

Fischer says he speaks from experience, having gone from Woody Herman to fusion to the Crusaders to LA session work to teaching at a university with plenty of starts and stops in-between. Yet looking back, he retains a certain fondness for that fusion period, as much because it was a time of experimentation. “When we did the fusion thing, we didn’t really care if we got paid or not. We did it because we wanted to do something new and unique and we were searching.  I think jazz picks people.  It picks individuals for the most part that are intuitive and inquisitive.  This music is very selective in who it picks. I really believe this music picks you, not the other way around.” ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912205597.84/warc/CC-MAIN-20190326160044-20190326182044-00411.warc.gz

 Bay Area bassist and bandleader Marcus Shelby knows exactly what he’ll be doing on Martin Luther King Day this year. “We’ll be playing our suite ‘Soul of the Movement’ for the San Francisco MLK Day Celebration at the Yerba Buena Gardens Theater,” he says.  “For the last several years I was part of the San Mateo MLK Day Parade Committee. They were the first ones who actually supported me in terms of dollars and commissioned the work.”  That work he’s referring to is an ambitious suite inspired by Martin Luther King, Jr. and the Civil Rights Movement of the ’60s: Soul of the Movement on Porto Franco Records.

The album features a 15-piece jazz orchestra working through Shelby’s arrangements of spirituals, originals and protest songs.  The music is both complex and accessible, due in large part to a foundation of spirituals and blues underlying all the improvisation and composition.

Shelby says that the reason he chose that subject was simple: He just wanted to learn more about the past-his and this country’s. “I wanted to know more than just the general information we get every year about Dr. King because of his birthday,” he explains.  “On top of that I wanted to know how the music played an important part of the movement.”

This isn’t the first time he’s ventured into the past for inspiration.  An earlier project focused on the legacy of Harriet Tubman and the research for that album sowed the seeds of creation for this new one. “I found music to be a very important part of how she communicated,” Shelby says. “So I knew that Dr. King had pointed to how abolitionists and runaway slaves like Tubman, Sojourner Truth and others used slave songs and blues hollers as a form of communication to get messages and also to inform those around them of their plight and basically just to empower folk.”

That was just the beginning of Shelby’s self-education. “I felt like I needed to know more about the music that happened in the civil rights movement-not only the spirituals or the freedom songs but also songs written by jazz musicians like Charles Mingus or Nina Simone or John Coltrane or Duke Ellington or those who spoke out against segregation like Louis Armstrong and Harry Belafonte.  So how jazz musicians used their music to speak about and to also be a part of movement of change, for social change was really inspiring to me. It’s something I really wanted to tap into and something I really wanted for the type of music that I was writing and orchestrating as well.”

Shelby also had a very personal connection to the Civil Rights movement, because his own family was involved with the “I’m a Man” sanitation workers strike in Memphis, during which Dr. King’s life was ended in 1968.  “I had gone to Memphis many times in the past but it had never occurred to me to ask members of my family certain questions-questions about history, questions about the Civil Rights Movement in particular.”  In fact, the demonstrators in Memphis included Shelby’s relatives. “I have two aunts (Katie Mae Greer and Lucille Greer) that were nurses at the time and participated in the Sanitation Workers Strike and when I interviewed them, they vividly remember (although being women) carrying the well known signs that read ‘I Am a Man’ in solidarity with the men.”

His family’s hometown of Memphis was not the only place he traveled to for research. Shelby also visited Mississippi, Alabama (Selma and Birmingham) and Arkansas (Little Rock).  He also spent a summer in Chicago doing research.  “I needed to go back and kind of learn and discover in a much more personal way and detail what my forefathers had done.  I’m not an historian with a PhD. I wasn’t necessarily trying to tell the story of the Civil Rights Movement but I was trying to find how the movement could inspire a movement within me today-as a teacher, as a creator, as a musician, as a father, as someone very close and active in my community. Because I’m a musician I felt I could be a voice and a part of what’s happening today.”

Ramsey Lewis, who recently composed a large-scale work on the legacy of Abraham Lincoln, talked about how he had to dig deeper into history in order to go beyond the superficial details, such as that Lincoln freed the slaves and was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth.  For his part, Shelby says that he thought he knew about the famous March on Washington, but found there was plenty more to learn. “I learned that it was not the first one. A. Philip Randolph had done the same thing in the ’40s.  The same thing with the Freedom Rides in the early part of the ’60s-that wasn’t the first one.  The first Freedom Rides were done in 1947 and they were called the Journey of Reconciliation and masterminded by A. Philip Randolph.  Also Bayard Rustin was the orchestrator of the March of Washington but he’s always forgotten in the history books because he was gay, at a time when it wasn’t accepted. Although he had friends in all circles, he was part of that intellectual underground New York scene in the ’30s where anyone involved was perceived as a communist.”

Shelby says that he himself learned plenty from the research he did for this album.  “You hear a lot about the successes-you know, that Rosa Parks doesn’t give up her seat and then the buses are integrated.  But you don’t learn it took a whole year…it took a lot of setbacks.  It even took them making some bad decisions and along the way, King having a major breakdown.  You learn about his humanity in a way that you might not get usually.  You discover he’s like you…that he makes mistakes just like you. He may have done great things but I think we all have the capacity to do great things.  So I learned a lot about how he persevered through those struggles.  We can look back and see all the success and the advance but for them, they didn’t know if they were going to be successful and in many cases they didn’t even know if they were going to be killed.”

Naturally, Dr. King was a focal point of Shelby’s research and final work. “I visited his house when I went to Montgomery. They showed me where the bomb was thrown into his house early on during his career.  He was just 25 years old when this happened. He had just graduated from Boston with his PhD and he had an opportunity to serve as a minister in any church he basically wanted in the North.   He chose to go down into the belly of the South because he really wanted to change the plight of African Americans there and that’s something that’s not really told as well.  He had a Phd, he came from a prominent family in Atlanta and yet he chose to go to Montgomery, which was very poor, very segregated, very racist-and he took over Dexter Baptist Church.  And a lot of what he learned was from Vernon Johns-a gentleman who preceeded him as the minister at Dexter Baptist Church.”

Did Shelby come away with a real sense of why did King, of all the people involved in the Movement, become the acknowledged leader way above all the rest? “He was like a lot of us but he was able to reach deep down,” Shelby says. “Obviously he had some gifts that many of us don’t have, like his oratorical gifts and his masterful intelligence. He was open-minded but he was also a human. You learn about his humanity.”

Shelby also came away impressed by other people less known to the general public, operating behind the scenes away from the media spotlight. “I didn’t know as much about Bayard Rustin until I studied King and then I became friends with Dr. Adam Green, whose father Ernest Green was one of the Little Rock Nine.  I got a chance to visit that school and I spent a summer and with Dr. Adam Green because he was one of my professors at the University of Chicago.”

However, Shelby points out that not all of the Civil Rights movement was based on people and events in the South. In particular, he came to see that Chicago had an important role in the Civil Rights Movement.  “Look at Emmett Till’s story. He came from Chicago and he was killed in Money, Mississippi. It sort of brought the South and the North together because of this horrible lynching.  It was publicized in the Chicago Defender [the large African-American newspaper].  So that was enriching to learn about all of those stories that weren’t just King’s stories.”

Even King was aware that his larger role often masked the many people who made contributions to social change. Shelby wanted to be sure to make them a part of his story and the music. “King always referred to everyone in the movement as the foot soldiers who don’t get any credit,” explains Shelby. “I wanted to learn about these foot soldiers.  All of these impressions don’t always turn into music so much but they become part of the story when I teach it. But at the same time, some of it does turn into music. When I visited Memphis, when I visited Birmingham, when I visited Montgomery, when I spent time in Chicago – some of these moments do turn into music.  Or I might find a song there or I might be inspired by a song that’s associated with a location and I think, ‘Oh, I want to re-orchestrate that.’  So that’s how some of that comes to life.”

Of course, the movement had a soundtrack of its own, mostly spirituals, thanks in part to the central role of the church, where large numbers of African-Americans would gather before, during and after big events.  Often a crowd would sit in the church for hours before the formal organizational meeting, singing and praying and congregating.  Shelby says that the reason they did that wasn’t just the fellowship. “You’ve got to ask yourself why. The answer is because that is the only place they can do that. Any time you saw a large assembly of black folk at that time in the segregated south, they were told to disperse. Let alone speak publicly about their injustices so church was on the one safe haven.”

Although the Soul of the Movement album includes a version of “Fables of Faubus” by Charles Mingus, much of the music Shelby re-arranged were spirituals.  “For me, I had to find songs that were personal to me. The spirituals were songs I had sung in church or they were songs I found that were close to King like, ‘There’s a Balm in Gilead.’ That was a spiritual that he quoted from often when he spoke and specifically he sings it at the end of his ‘Knock at Midnight’ speech.  While I was there with my family, we listened to that speech in Montgomery, visiting his parsonage at Dexter Church and we played that speech over and over and always at the end he would sing, ‘There’s a Balm in Gilead’ and so it just became part of that experience that I wanted to document musically.  And ‘Amen’ was a spiritual I sang in church, so I wanted to rearrange that in 7/4 and sort of put it against different harmonic backgrounds.”

Indeed, Shelby connects many of the songs to people and places in his own life.  “‘Go Tell It On the Mountain’ is my mom’s favorite spiritual and it’s also a musical experience me and my family had when we were in Selma because it was one of the songs they sang as they crossed over the Edmund Pettus Bridge during the voting rights marches.  So that experience I wanted to capture, because we kept crossing over that bridge as well, trying to imagine them met by dogs and policemen and being brutally and savagely beat the first time they tried to march from Selma to Montgomery.”

One of the secular songs on the album is a Curtis Mayfield tune, “We’re a Winner,” which Shelby rediscovered during his residency and research in Chicago.  “I learned about him as a musician and an artist and how he used his music to be a voice of unity and courage and strength.  He repeated this over and over and it reminded me of how King would constantly try to get black people to have self-respect, from cleanliness to education and just the way they interacted with other. This song is a musical testimony to what King was always trying to get our community to embody.  Even the lyrics of ‘We’re a Winner’ were important so I wanted to include that. I had heard that song before years ago, but it didn’t really mean that much to me then. But I began to learn more about Curtis Mayfield and other Chicago groups around that time, including Andrew Tibbs, who composed a piece called, ‘Bilbo is Dead’  probably one of the first records that was banned because it spoke out against the Governor of Mississippi.  I learned about this succession of musicians and how they all came up from the Mississippi Delta and how Chicago was one of the early places where they recorded. And, of course, Louis Armstrong went to Chicago for the same reason everybody else did-to escape the South and for money.”

The album ends with a solemn version of Thomas Dorsey’s “Precious Lord, Take My Hand,” which had particular meaning for King and therefore Shelby. “That’s the song King requested the night he was killed. He asked Ben Branch, his piano player, to play that song and he asked him to play it pretty.  Ben Branch was an NAACP piano player who lived in and around the Memphis area.  So I wanted to end our whole album with this piece, not necessarily as King requested it, but in the sense that it was the selection that he wanted to have performed.”

Shelby’s work with earlier projects of a large scale-Harriet Tubman and Port Chicago-gave him confidence to tackle a massive topic like the Civil Rights Movement.  It starts with inspiration followed by research. His first one was about Port Chicago, about the miscarriage of justice that occurred after a catastrophic explosion at a shipyard in 1944. “I went to the memorial for several years and met a gentleman who wrote the book and so all those resources where there. That was 10 years ago. I was developing how to approach this as an orchestrator and also as whatever kind of historian you want to call me, as someone very much interested and who wanted to capture that in music.”

After that came a suite inspired by Harriet Tubman, the legendary abolitionist and Underground Railroad activist. “I had a little bit more resources so I was able to travel to where she was born and where she died and to New York City where she had spent some time and met descendants of abolitionists and I was able to have that experience and then I spent six months at Stanford University doing research and teaching classes and developing the music.”

With Soul of the Movement Shelby had three years to work on the project. He traveled, did a residency in Chicago, and spent time at Stanford University at the Martin Luther King Papers Project.  “With each project I’ve tried to build on the capacity and the research and also try to grow the craft. I try to explore and absorb as much of the music as possible that is resonating and try to learn from that and try to keep it going forward.  Not so much re-creating the past musically-although I love that music and it’s very much a foundation-but also trying to capture what’s happening today.  I’m influenced and inspired by artists that are around me today-from those that live right here in San Francisco to those that are doing great things in New York and all across the land.  So I’m trying to stay as open-minded and try to learn as much and share what’s happening today.  So that the music is moving forward.”

Truly a man with a sense of community and place, Shelby isn’t alone with these projects dealing with bigger social issues. Shelby worked with Howard Wiley III on his Angola Project, about inmates in the infamous Louisiana prison.  Wiley in turn has been on Shelby’s albums.  And one of Wiley’s key contributors on the Angola Project was vocalist Faye Carroll, whom Shelby also used and whom Shelby credits for much musical inspiration in this largely instrumental suite. “For me, a voice is one of the instruments and hers is central,” says Shelby. “I’ve known Faye for over a decade.  I had the real great opportunity of recording with her and Billy Higgins and her daughter, right before Billy Higgins passed away.  So Faye and I have been friends for a long time. She’s a mentor of mine. She’s a mentor of all of ours. All of the young musicians who are around her, even though she’s on their projects in some cases-we all look up to her as a spiritual and musical mentor.  She’s very important to me – we talk all the time about concept, about history, about music.  Harriett Tubman was the first project that we extensively worked on.  I immediately thought of her because of what she can do with her voice-anything from yodeling to scat singing to basically just singing a lyric just as it is to the blues to singing bebop, singing funk, R&B, spirituals. There’s nothing that she can’t really do. And she has this amazing voice-timbre and color-that I imagine the type of voice that Harriett Tubman would have.  For that project I found all these connections that were inspiring and I just started there and everything else kind of grew out of her voice because I wanted her to be very central. She’s really inspiring. She can’t tell you what note you’re playing or what rhythm you’re playing, but she can tell you the right note or the just the right rhythm. She’s an incredible arranger-one of the best I know. She’s just intuitive. I feel real blessed to be around her.”

Shelby also worked with another vocalist from the Bay area-Kenny Washington. “He’s an amazing vocalist as well and he does things like what a horn can do,” says Shelby. “I wanted to involve him equally as much on this project as well.”

Although the recording features a large ensemble, Shelby has managed to perform the suite live off and on over the three years as the piece came together. “I spent time building it along the way. We did a premiere last year in May at the Yerba Buena Gardens Festival and then we did San Francisco Jazz Festival and Yoshi’s. In some cases, I’ve also cut one or two songs because I talk in between the sections, to put it into context. I talk a little bit about what the pieces are inspired by or noteworthy to add and then we perform it.  In some cases we might not do the whole suite.”

With all the traveling, research and musicians involved in a project like this, you have to wonder how he pulls it off during a time when most bandleaders are just hoping to get a few gigs. Shelby confirms that he did receive support from some non-profits and foundations. “Yes, I got a couple of large grants from foundations, including: the Center for Cultural Innovation, a California grant fund; the SF Arts Commission; and great support from the Yerba Buena Gardens Foundation. You try to work with what you can, but it really helped to piece this together.  I would have liked to spend some time in Atlanta which I didn’t get to do, but I’m very grateful for what we did get and the San Francisco Arts Commission, as well as the Creative Work Fund, the Gerbode Fund, the Hewlett Fund, have been investing in the artists here as much as they can when the economy has been totally broken.  Whenever I can get a grant, I want to be as ambitious as I can because I want to grow and I want to learn.”

Shelby has been so immersed in what King did do that it’s hard for him to consider what King could have done had he lived. “I haven’t really thought about it. You know, he was at an all-time low in popularity when he was killed.  He had very few friends and he had spoken out against the Vietnam War so the government had totally turned against him.  You know how some people, even progressive supporters, are heavily criticizing President Obama for not being aggressive enough? The same thing was happening to King within the black community.  He had turned his focus to the Poor People’s Campaign and he was becoming tired. So I have no idea. He wasn’t interested in politics, so it’s not like he would have gotten into politics.”

Naturally, a musician as curious and ambitious as Shelby has his eyes and mind on future projects.  “I’m working on two different ideas.  I’ve been studying the history of women in this country from the colonial period to today.  Not only their contributions to American life-say from the early Quakers such as Lucretia Mott who was an avid abolitionist, anti-slavery and strong proponent for women’s rights but also all the way up through to women who have made contributions in jazz music.  People like Mary Lou Williams, Clora Bryant, Dorothy Donegan.  Or if you take apart the Sweethearts of Rhythm or even if you just look at that band as a whole, you see that it was a breakthrough band because they integrated at a time when bands weren’t integrated. Nonetheless, they were an all women band, they were good and they had the best arrangers.  As someone who has two daughters, I want them to be inspired not only by singers but also by the Cindy Blackmans or Melba Listons of the world.  I go to schools and one of the first things I ask them to do is, ‘Name famous male jazz musicians’ and right away they name people like Louis Armstrong, Miles Davis, John Coltrane. Then I ask them to name a famous female who played an instrument, not a singer. And they can’t.  So that’s something I’ve been working on for the last year. ‘Women and Jazz’ is a
musical presentation for young people that honors the history of women in America from the colonial period to the present. I was inspired by a book I read by New York Times opinion writer Anne Collins called America’s Women: Four Hundred Years of Dolls, Drudges, Helpmates, and Heroines. ‘Women and Jazz’  is a combination of music, poetry, speeches and perspectives on the history of social progress of women in America. We also celebrate leading women in the history of jazz music through performing select compositions written by female composers or our own original compositions that honors them.”

The other idea Shelby has been considering involves green economics and sustainability. “There are a lot of musical relationships there,” says Shelby.  “I’m just starting to read and discover stuff that’s inspiring. But that’s more down the road.  There are a lot of other artists I know that are interested in this topic and I’d like to work with some kind of multi-artistic creation to kind of dig deeper into what that means. San Francisco is a prime place because that consciousness is here.”

Undaunted by the work required to pull off these big works, Shelby seems set on continuing the approach, with each one building on the one before.  “Every year I’ll find something. And I know it’ll mean more for me than in the past, because of this project.” ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912203326.34/warc/CC-MAIN-20190324043400-20190324065400-00397.warc.gz

136,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/tangents/pat-metheny-the-spirit-sound-of-music/,"Pat Metheny, Belgrade Jazz Festival, Oct. 2011 The folks at Entertainment Cruise Productions asked JT to interview Pat Metheny about his upcoming appearance on the  Contemporary Jazz Cruise during February 4-11, 2017.  Currently on tour in Europe with his Unity group, Metheny took a few moments to respond to questions via email.  The Q&A below features material from that email interview in which he talked about the cruise, as well as about his approach to his own music and to collaborating creatively with other musicians.

I’d have to think that one of the real advantages for you to perform at a festival or on a cruise is the hang with the other musicians, right? 

It’s true that very often the only time I get to see so many of my musician friends is backstage or at the hotel when we are sharing the bill on the same festivals around the world. Anytime I can see the people I admire the most on or off the bandstand is really a pleasure for me.

You travel so much for your music.  Is it still fun for you to visit places? 

It is one of the real privileges of my life that I have been to go all over the world and see so many amazing places and to meet so many incredible people. But it is always about the music for me first and foremost.

I always try to play each concert like it is the last time I will ever play no matter where it is or what the setting. I consider each opportunity to play as something unique and very special. I always get there really early and warm up and make sure we do a good sound check and do everything we can to make the night a good one for everyone. I try to put together programs that have a certain amount of variety as well as plenty of chances for which ever musicians I have brought with me during that period to shine and be inspired to do their best.

How do you manage all your different bands and projects? 

I really just try to honestly represent in sound the things I love about music.

I am not a huge fan of the whole idea of genre or dividing things up into various styles of music as a way of thinking. To me, music is one big universal thing and I always try to represent that. The musicians who I have admired the most are the ones who have a deep reservoir of knowledge and insight not just about music, but about life in general and are able to illuminate the things that they love in sound. When it is a musician who can do that on the spot, as an improviser, that is usually my favorite kind of player.

I feel like I am a musician in this broad sense first. And all the subsets of the way music often gets talked about in terms of the words people use to describe music is basically just a cultural/political discussion that I have found that I am really not that interested in in the same way I am interested in the spirit and sound of music itself.

As far as sound goes, I always try to let the music at hand decide what direction I go in in terms of orchestration. I am pretty happy to play in a really dense way, or a really sparse way, or really loud or really soft or all over the dynamic range, really inside the chords or outside the chords…it kind of doesn’t matter too much for me-it is whatever seems to sound best for what is happening at that particular moment.

One of the unique things about the cruise specifically and about jazz in general is the multigenerational aspect.  You were the “young guy” before with legendary elders like Ornette Coleman, Roy Haynes and Billy Higgins, but now you’re more senior. What’s that like to now be more of the “elder” in the band? 

From the beginning, I have always been kind of non-aligned within the community in general. It seems I have always worked across a lot of borders, although I haven’t really viewed it like that in musical terms. I keep my ears open for the kinds of things that interest me. As a result, I hang out and do projects with everyone across the board at different times, from the elder giants like Roy Haynes or Ron Carter to the generation immediately older than me, like Gary, Chick Corea, Herbie Hancock and Jack DeJohnette, to some of the guys that are a generation or so behind me like Joshua Redman and Brad Mehldau and even the really new guys like Logan Richardson. To me, the essential ingredient is always the same-a deep commitment and relationship to music. That is maybe the one constant thing that all the players I am attracted to seem to have. I always try to offer them the same. That has been always been the main thing for me.

How do you relate to your audience and fans? Do they inspire you? 

While I always feel my first and most important task is to answer to the music at hand as best I can, I have always tried to bring a basic level of consideration to the people who come to the concerts in terms of presentation. I always try to play in a way that I hope will clarify and illuminate the spirit and intentions of the music that I am interested in during that period in the best way I can. I do think people are much more willing to accept a much wider spectrum of possibilities than they are sometimes given credit for and I work under that assumption. You can’t get into the Museum of Modern Art on a weekend, it is packed. In a film score, you can write the most complex 12 tone thing imaginable and people have no problem with it if it fits with what is going on and has an intentional clarity to it. It only takes a few touches to invite people into a world, a few gestures of welcome and people will almost always be willing to go on trip and discover new things. I always assume the audience is at least as hip as the band. I might be right or I might be wrong, but I have found that that is a good place to start.

You’ve written so many great songs that have become like standards.  How do you balance performing the songs that people love and want to hear with new material? 

What is nice is that by this point along the way, people seem to know that I have never just done the same thing over and over and even kind of expect me to keep coming up with something new each time. I have many different ways of thinking about music myself, even as a fan of music, and I have always felt like it was an essential part of my thing to be very honest about all of it and really follow through with each idea to the best of my ability. So it is kind of a built in thing with me.

However, regarding older tunes, to me, they are all still fun to play. I don’t think there is anything from any period where I go, “Wow, what was I thinking there?” So yes, I quite freely draw from earlier periods if it seems resonant to a particular evening or performance or features the strengths of a particular musician that might be featured in whatever the current thing is. I always try to put together a program each day that will be challenging and fun to play and hopefully will be fun for the folks who come to check it out as it will be for me to be standing on the bandstand playing it.

137,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/the-gig/birds-unfinished-business/,"Verve's new ""Unheard Bird"" is a holy-grail collection for devotees of Charlie Parker  The first Charlie Parker collection I ever owned was a mixtape, dubbed onto both sides of a Maxell cassette. Made at my persistent urging by a Bird-crazy Latin teacher at my high school, the tape was an admirable survey of the alto saxophonist’s known discography. There were rough gems from his Savoy years, choice selections on Dial, a few confectionary morsels from Charlie Parker With Strings. And in what seemed at the time like a collector’s quirk, my teacher had littered the trail with false starts and incomplete takes: an off-kilter “Ko-Ko,” a thwarted “Parker’s Mood.” I didn’t give it much thought as I wore out the cassette in my car’s tape deck, but this tendency toward all-inclusiveness-toward a blinkered, warts-and-all voraciousness-was the best possible indoctrination to any life of Parker fandom.

I remembered that cassette recently while listening to Unheard Bird: The Unissued Takes, a new archival release on Verve. Pieced together from a trove of studio recordings on Mercury and Clef between 1949 and 1952, it features Parker’s alto saxophone in formats ranging from a quartet to a big band to an orchestra. Originally produced by Norman Granz, these sessions show Bird in generally fine form, working his quicksilver magic in ways that can feel workmanlike but somehow never fail to spark. Comprising 58 previously unavailable session takes-some of them only a few seconds long, and others amounting to full alternate tracks-it’s an alluring if rather undifferentiated heap of material from an indisputable giant of jazz.

If you have even a faint working knowledge of that giant’s music, you probably won’t be shocked to learn that Unheard Bird came about partly through the tenacity of Phil Schaap. A fact-scavenging jazz historian best known as the host of “Bird Flights,” the long-running (and longwinded) radio show on Columbia University’s WKCR-FM, Schaap has been involved in several other big ornithological releases in recent memory, including The Complete Dean Benedetti Recordings of Charlie Parker, a Mosaic box set from 1990.

Unheard Bird doesn’t approach that level of historic import, but it does sew up some unfinished business. In the liner notes, Schaap recalls his discovery of some mono reel-to-reel tapes in a PolyGram vault in the 1980s, rare bonus material that found its way onto Bird: The Complete Charlie Parker on Verve, a 10-CD set. This new material clearly would have been a part of that same box, had Schaap been able to track it down at the time. Its recent provenance is a little vague-Harry Weinger, vice president of A&R for Universal Music Enterprises, who coproduced the release with Schaap, acquired it from some former associates of Granz-but the music itself is bracingly clear. Whether or not you also find it compelling may depend on your relationship with “Bird Flights,” in all of its detail-mongering, hairsplitting glory.

When David Remnick, the editor of the New Yorker, profiled Schaap for that magazine in 2008, he assessed the discursive prolixities of “Bird Flights” as both a feature and a bug, “blurring the line between exhaustive and exhausting.” Early in the profile there’s a description of one particular show in which Schaap plays the 1949 recording “Okiedoke,” made by Parker with Machito and His Orchestra. He then goes on a seemingly endless tangent about how the saxophonist might have pronounced that slangy term. (“Perhaps it was at this point,” Remnick noted dryly, “that listeners all over the metropolitan area, what few remained, either shut off their radios, grew weirdly fascinated, or called an ambulance on Schaap’s behalf.”)

It so happens that “Okiedoke” accounts for the first five tracks of Unheard Bird, appearing in varying degrees of completion. Hearing them in chronological sequence, it’s easy to feel like a member of the “Bird Flights” audience, though Schaap’s pontifications are mercifully constrained to the CD booklet. Some of his statistical scholarship is valuable. But there’s also a good amount of forensic arcana that will only interest his fellow obsessives, like a sidebar concerning the likely date of a session in the spring of 1949. (Recalling that the conga player on the session once described it as a warm day, Schaap writes: “Historical weather records indicate May 4, 1949 the warmest day in NYC that month; it was still in the mid-70s the following day.”)

Forever caught between a low whistle of admiration and a barely stifled yawn, I harbor a diehard ambivalence about Schaap’s style as a jazz communicator. But I have only great respect for the purity of his quest, which certainly shines through here. For anyone so inclined, this is a great opportunity to hear about a dozen partial takes of a track labeled “Blues (Fast),” made in 1950 by a killer quartet with Parker, pianist Hank Jones, bassist Ray Brown and drummer Buddy Rich. (For each intro, Rich plays a slightly different rudimentary break on snare drum.) And Schaap rightly singles out the distinctions between master and alternate takes of “What Is This Thing Called Love?,” from a 1952 session with a big band, featuring arrangements by Joe Lipman. For me, one small fixation that emerges here is the way that Thelonious Monk slyly changes his piano part for every take of “Mohawk”-but sticks to a more consistent setup on “An Oscar for Treadwell,” from the same session in 1950.

Another tune from that session is “Bloomdido,” which was on my high school Parker mixtape. A few intriguing false starts of the tune appear on Unheard Bird, including one in which Parker fails to come in on the head. “Forgive me, I misunderstood it myself,” he says in his mellow Kansas City baritone. “OK, do it again.” By the third take, Rich is helpfully swishing a hi-hat behind Monk’s spiky intro; by the fourth take, they’ve nailed it.

138,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/the-gig/kurt-elling-man-in-the-air/,"Let’s come right out and say it: Kurt Elling is the most influential jazz vocalist of our time. Mercurial but ever-lyrical, a serenader as well as a searcher, he represents the higher instincts and aspirations of a field crowded with every sort of throwback. At 42, he’s a perennial poll winner and consummate insider, occupying a role that would have seemed far-fetched when he made his first album 15 years ago. But the state of jazz singing will be different in the coming decade than it was when he arrived, and I dare say it will be better. In no small part, that’s because of the ambitious standard he has set. “Among my jazz students, he’s the contemporary singer that I hear cited the most as an influence,” says David Thorne Scott, an associate professor in the voice department at the Berklee College of Music. “I always expect it from my guys, but it’s the women too.” Similar testimony comes from Dominique Eade, an accomplished jazz singerand revered faculty member at the New England Conservatory. “Technically he’s so impressive,” she says, “and I think students can feel the weight of musicianship behind what he does, in his transcription and his writing of lyrics to other people’s solos.” With a chuckle, she adds, “It’s sometimes hard for me to remember this, but I’m teaching kids who don’t know Mark Murphy and don’t know Eddie Jefferson, and may not know Annie Ross. There’s a direction that those people pointed toward that nobody really followed through on. It almost skipped a generation. Kurt took that idea and carried it forward.” Elling, a product of Chicago, had his basic agenda in place from the start. Close Your Eyes, his Blue Note debut, opens with the title track, one of two durable standards by Bernice Petkere. A study in smoldering crescendo, it begins as a dreamy reverie, shifts to assertive swing and crests with an expressionistic scat chorus. The following tune, “Dolores Dream,” presents Elling’s vocalese take on a Wayne Shorter composition, with clever use of onomatopoeia (“‘Bronk!’ went a taxicab outside”) and shrewd manipulation of timbre. Next comes “The Ballad of the Sad Young Men,” another standard, and “(Hide the) Salomé,” an original with implications both literary and faintly lascivious. And so it goes, on an album that invokes poet Rainer Maria Rilke alongside jazzmen like Herbie Hancock. Elling, supported throughout by his steadfast musical partner, pianist Laurence Hobgood, exudes spectacular confidence and élan. The ensuing years would find him both expanding and refining his portfolio, with two superb follow-up albums, The Messenger (1997) and This Time It’s Love (1998), and a worthwhile succession of others, both on Blue Note and Concord, his current label home. Along the way his core assets as a singer-intelligent phrasing, clear but pliable intonation, impeccable breath and pitch control-commingled freely with his literary and conceptual inclinations. His most recent release, Dedicated to You: Kurt Elling Sings the Music of Coltrane and Hartman, showcases his skills as a balladeer, even if it also confirms that his temperament skews more Coltrane than Hartman. He’ll be recording his next studio album in December; the veteran pop producer Don Was will be involved. I should note that Elling, who has lately been residing with his wife and daughter in Brooklyn, does have his share of detractors. My own reservations have revolved around various kinds of cerebral or sentimental excess. Sometimes it feels like each of Elling’s brilliant literary turns-like the role he fills so memorably in Leaves of Grass, a multimedia work by pianist Fred Hersch-has a corresponding moment of bathos or pretension. Nightmoves, his 2007 Concord debut, still strikes me as an unctuous flop, despite his vocalese response to a Dexter Gordon recording of “Body and Soul.” Still, it’s fascinating to learn that the Elling track most aspiring vocalists at Berklee want to transcribe is “In the Winelight,” a slow jam from the 2003 album Man in the Air. “The fact that he goes outside of your spang-a-lang swing rhythm is something they can tap into,” says Scott, suggesting that R&B inflection also plays a role in that equation. Given that Elling has prominently toured with Jon Hendricks and Mark Murphy, the two jazz-vocal masters who form the backbone of his style, it would seem that he still considers himself more of a pupil than a mentor. But I would venture to say he recognizes his own impact as a standard-bearer, which has been inexorably on the rise. Consider José James, a dashing young jazz singer with a pronounced footing in R&B, who has cited Elling and Cassandra Wilson as early influences. Among the signature moves in James’ fledgling repertoire is a spin on “Resolution,” from John Coltrane’s hallowed suite A Love Supreme. (Elling got there first, brilliantly. Find the studio result on Man in the Air, or a superior live track at kurtelling.com.) Even more telling is the example of Sachal Vasandani, a prepossessing recent arrival whose sophomore album, We Move (Mack Avenue), is among this year’s best vocal releases. On it he contributes several of his own tunes, pays homage to Hendricks and Murphy, and interacts sure-footedly with a dynamic working band. His take on the standard “Don’t Worry About Me” involves a lilting “Poinciana” groove, over which he phrases in long arcs; the whole package suggests Elling on “My Foolish Heart” a decade ago. And one of the originals, a near-bossa called “Royal Eyes,” incorporates a distinctly Elling-esque reading, complete with subtly multitracked background harmonies. Which is not to say that Vasandani sounds just like Elling-that would be beside the point, as both singers would surely agree. Eade sheds the best light on this facet of the elder’s influence. “One thing I have not encountered in my teaching,” she says, “is students who are slavishly imitative of Kurt. And I think in a way that’s his best gift. There’s so much to admire, but people use it as an inroad to something musical, rather than just a pose.” ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202496.35/warc/CC-MAIN-20190321051516-20190321073516-00498.warc.gz
139,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/the-gig/the-blue-egg/,"The Blue Egg was a jazz club on the south side of Chicago, lightly scuffed but lovingly tended, a neighborhood joint with a mixed clientele. Musicians gathered there to earn their pay and sharpen their trade, treating the place like a combination work site, grand lodge, corner bar and town square. It was, in other words, like so many other small-time establishments in urban communities across the country, nondescript in its adherence to type-unless you were one of the regulars who knew the place top to bottom, in which case “nondescript” was the furthest thing from the truth.

Jazz scholars and cultural anthropologists have excluded the Blue Egg from the historical record, though they can’t reasonably be faulted, since it never really existed. I conjured the club for a short story in a creative writing class during my junior year of high school. At that time I had been to Chicago just once, for a college-scouting trip, without actually visiting any jazz haunts.

But the Blue Egg was fantastically vivid to me nonetheless, right down to the ghostly chill in the air after the tables had been wiped down and the doors locked for the night. Its particulars, so clear in my mind’s eye, attest not only to the powers of the adolescent imagination, but also to jazz’s mythic sense of place. I couldn’t have explained it then, but the Blue Egg was probably an idealized composite of movie references, Herman Leonard photographs and the sonic atmosphere of albums like Art Blakey’s At the Café Bohemia and Miles Davis’ Cookin’ at the Plugged Nickel.

The jazz club, as a locus of creative and commercial exchange, has been with us almost since the origins of our music; there’s really no way to conceive of the last century’s stylistic developments without them. But their dominance may in fact be on the wane, depending on where you look or-more to the point-whom you ask. Witness the excitable chatter of Adam Schatz, a New York promoter in his early 20s whose indie operation Search and Restore utilizes a range of spaces, from black box theaters to Brooklyn dives. Writing about Schatz and his efforts recently, my colleague Ben Ratliff praised both his do-it-yourself ethos and his youthful disregard for preservation. “As a jazz critic for the New York Times,” wrote Ratliff, “the question I hear most is which club to visit.” The better question, he added, was which musicians to follow: “New audiences always need to be forming, but in the end the more important bonds of those audiences are the germinating, ever-changing ones, among listeners of similar musical interests, not the fixed and sentimental ones, between patrons and places.”

I understand that argument, and for the most part I subscribe to it. But a part of me flinches at the devaluation of the jazz club, the notion that its customs reek of a benign but archaic irrelevance. Certainly there’s not much to romanticize about the stiff cover charge, ironclad drink minimum and clear-the-house churn of the more touristy spots. And we risk resembling masochists when we praise the privations of our grittier joints. Back in 2007, when guitarist Wayne Krantz sent out an e-mail explaining his decision to stop playing Thursdays at the 55 Bar in Greenwich Village, his nostalgia felt tinged with a kind of trauma. “The audience-what little we had-was either falling off the barstools drunk or holed up in the bathroom conducting/consummating business transactions,” he wrote of his early years at the club, in the late ’80s. And yet Krantz credited the 55 Bar as a defining force in his musical development, partly for the relationships it engendered and partly for the home and workshop it became. You hear similar stories about the Green Mill and the Velvet Lounge in Chicago, Wally’s in Boston, and literally dozens of places in New York over the years, some still kicking and others long gone.

This being the Personal Farewells issue of JazzTimes, it’s only fitting to note the departure of one such hub in Philadelphia: Ortlieb’s Jazzhaus, which closed last April. During my college years, some weeks found me at Ortlieb’s almost every night, sipping pints of Yuengling at a table near the foot of the stage. The cigarette smoke in the room was usually stifling. The food was beige and iffy, the piano was a funky relic and the clientele was often noisy. The surrounding neighborhood, Northern Liberties, was still known for crack vials rather than tapas and microbrews.

And yet, like Krantz with 55, I find myself smiling fondly at my endless nights at Ortlieb’s, taking in hard-boiled sets by drummer Mickey Roker or tenor saxophonist Bootsie Barnes. I also spent a good deal of time back then at Chris’ Jazz Café, and at pop-up shows organized by my friend Mark Christman, who was then about to establish Ars Nova Workshop, a nonprofit avant-garde presenting organization now in its 11th year. But Ortlieb’s had the definitive sense of place, and it’s still the scene I picture when my thoughts turn to the semi-recent legacy of Philly jazz.

For that among other reasons, it’s transporting to hear the music on Keep the Faith, an album released last year on Imani Records, the label founded by pianist (and Ortlieb’s alumnus) Orrin Evans. Featuring the club’s longtime house rhythm section-pianist Sid Simmons, bassist Mike Boone and drummer Byron Landham-the album is a vivid snapshot and time capsule of that scene, its ethereality hammered home not only by Ortlieb’s shuttering but also, more painfully, by Simmons’ death late last year.

Keep the Faith was named after a tune by Simmons, and the whole album resonates now as an ad hoc memorial. Because I have virtually no context for Simmons’ playing outside of Ortlieb’s-and I should note here that I sat in with him and Boone, playing Landham’s drums, on too many occasions to number-the tracks recorded live at the club are especially bittersweet. During a version of “Soul Eyes” featuring Joe Magnarelli on flugelhorn, you can hear a party of young women talking, oblivious, at a table. (“Can I have a menu?” one chirps during Simmons’ piano solo.) This was the Ortlieb’s I knew and, however briefly, loved. Most of the album was recorded in 2009, but one track, “Just in Time,” was made “circa 1998,” which means I could easily have been there.

Ortlieb’s had its share of problems, surely more than I ever saw firsthand. Not unlike the Blue Egg, it now resides in a haze of reminiscence. But as our lives and livelihoods grow increasingly mobile, it’s worth standing up for the jazz club as a force for good, a shaper of experience. There’s something to be said, still, for those fixed and sentimental bonds. ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202496.35/warc/CC-MAIN-20190321051516-20190321073516-00492.warc.gz
140,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/the-gig/the-cabaret-card-and-jazz/,"Among the many curios in jazz’s epistolary record is a letter from Charlie Parker to the New York Liquor Control Board, dated Feb. 17, 1953. “My right to pursue my chosen profession has been taken away, and my wife and three children who are innocent of any wrongdoing are suffering,” Parker writes. ” … I feel sure that when you examine my record and see that I have made a sincere effort to become a family man and a good citizen, you will reconsider. If by any chance you feel I haven’t paid my debt to society, by all means let me do so and give me and my family back the right to live.”

Parker was referring of course to the status of his cabaret card, a license to work in city establishments serving alcohol-and thus, for a jazz musician trying to make ends meet at the time, probably the most crucial piece of identification in his or her possession. As you’re probably aware, the cabaret card could be revoked at the whim of the police, usually for narcotics infractions, however slight or untried. So it crops up regularly in jazz history, especially at midcentury, when that history was unfolding at breakneck speed. Parker was merely one of the card’s more expressive victims; its punitive restrictions also plagued Billie Holiday, Thelonious Monk, J.J. Johnson and Jackie McLean. A more comprehensive list could surely crowd the remainder of the page.

If the cabaret card seems from our present vantage like a nettlesome footnote in jazz lore, I’d argue that we’re underselling its influence, along with its larger implications. As an embodiment of the institutional distrust stirred up by jazz musicians, especially African-Americans, it’s a key to our understanding of the odds those musicians faced in civil society. The administration of the card, governed by a mysterious and often intransigent bureaucracy, more or less imposed the conditions of a police state in which music-making was cast as a privilege rather than a right. And because it kept some of jazz’s most important creative figures from active circulation in the music’s chief metropolitan hub, the cabaret card should be understood as an agent of historical disruption, its effects reaching not only lives and careers but also, by extension, the development of the art.

A cursory background of the legislation would note that New York cabaret licensing began as early as 1926, expanding in 1940 to make identification cards mandatory for entertainers, as part of a campaign to sanitize (and, by some accounts, deradicalize) the city’s nightlife. To get one of these cards, renewable every two years, a musician had to go to the police department’s license division to be photographed and fingerprinted-a process that by its nature could evoke the stigma of criminality.

Holiday, for one, lost her cabaret card after serving time for narcotics in 1947, near the height of her popularity; her comeback at Carnegie Hall the following year stood as a triumph. But the inability to play nightclubs was a blight even for someone of her stature. Insult was often added to injury. In one storied incident from the late ’50s, Holiday went to the Five Spot to lend support for her pianist, Mal Waldron, who was backing the poet Kenneth Koch. The club’s owner, Joe Termini, was hanging at the bar with an off-duty cop who recognized Lady Day. Asked to sing by Termini, she demurred, citing the police presence in the room, only to be informed that the police were behind the request. This reminder of the cruelly casual arbitration of the law would have a curious afterlife: It was apparently the same night Frank O’Hara describes in his poem “The Day Lady Died.”

Monk was an equally heartbreaking case. He first had his cabaret card revoked in 1948, after an arrest for marijuana possession; he lost it again in 1951, after a narcotics arrest with Bud Powell, and yet again in 1958, after an altercation with Delaware state troopers. Against a saga of chronic unemployability and financial hardship, he found the necessary workarounds: out-of-town bookings, where cabaret laws didn’t apply; unbilled gigs in the outer boroughs, where enforcement was lax; special arrangements like the one that yielded his 1959 concert at Town Hall.

There’s a silver lining here, in that much of this activity wouldn’t have happened without the cabaret card restrictions; even Monk’s legendary long-term run at the Five Spot with John Coltrane, starting in July of 1957, came about as a direct result. Another such example borders on dark comedy: At one point in 1960, unable again to work in New York, Monk took a booking at the Black Hawk club in San Francisco. With no steady drummer at the time, he poached Billy Higgins, who had just lost his cabaret card, from the Ornette Coleman Quartet. According to bassist Charlie Haden, this was what led to Ed Blackwell becoming the drummer in Coleman’s landmark band-and what freed Higgins up to initiate his historic run as a sideman on Blue Note Records.

But if we can recognize the upside of these contingencies, we have to acknowledge the cost. What opportunities were stymied by the cabaret card? How much sooner might Monk have found recognition, and what would the effect have been on his psyche? What if Miles Davis hadn’t lost his card in 1959, after being clubbed outside of Birdland: Might he have found more work for his sextet, fresh off the release of Kind of Blue? Think of the reputations that moldered, the engagements that never came to pass.

The cabaret law, as it pertained to musicians, finally met its end in 1967, after years of legal challenge, notably in cases involving Lord Buckley and Nina Simone. As for Parker and his letter, he was the rare musician whose appeal met with success, though it’s unclear whether this was cause and effect. (It’s just as possible that some midtown club owner, seeking to profit from his notoriety, worked his backroom connections.) Whatever the case, Parker’s plight was already underway. And while there’s no denying the clutch of his demons, who’s to say how much better he might have fared in a culture that didn’t legislate the execution of his art?

141,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/the-gig/the-gig-b-b-king/,"B.B. King, Montreal Int'l Jazz Festival, July 2014 B.B. King, who died in Las Vegas on May 14, at 89, will be forever remembered as one of the greatest bluesmen of any era, a guitar player of rough eloquence and a singer of dignified fervor. His irrefutable sobriquet, the King of the Blues, could hardly have been more fitting or just. And the shadow he cast on rock ‘n’ roll is a matter of settled fact, with proud inheritors like Eric Clapton, U2, Carlos Santana and Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top. But his artistry also resonated with jazz. More than any major blues hero of his generation-more than Jimmy Reed, more than Buddy Guy, more than his fellow surname sovereigns, the otherwise unrelated Albert and Freddie King-B.B. had a feeling for jazz musicians and jazz protocols, often giving them purchase in his music.

Born on a cotton plantation in Mississippi in 1925, he came up at the right time to understand jazz as a music of the people, with shining exemplars like Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington. (In 1960 he’d record a version of “Don’t Get Around Much Anymore,” as a guest vocalist with a studio band including only two noted Ellington alumni and no Duke; it was released a decade later, more than a bit misleadingly, as Stereophonic Sound of Duke Ellington.)

As for his jazz guitar influences, King was an aspiring young player when he first heard the Gypsy ace Django Reinhardt, on some 78-r.p.m. records that a friend had picked up in Europe during the war. He first heard the pioneering electric guitarist Charlie Christian, another formative figure, around the same time. Their shapely single-note lines, and the melodic thrust of their improvising, left more than a casual imprint on King’s emerging style, as did their fluency with chord arpeggios and diminished scales. Though his trademark as a guitarist was a straight-from-the-gut, vocal approach, you can hear the jazz influence in flashes across his career-say, in his phrasing on the original recording of “Woke Up This Morning (My Baby’s Gone),” from the early ’50s, or on subsequent live versions of “Sweet Little Angel,” including one played at the Village Gate in ’69.

Famously, King had a name for his guitar-Lucille, called out in many a song-and that personification got woven into the fabric of his music. It wasn’t just that he could make the guitar cry, whisper or shout, with his expressive touch and signature vibrato. There was a principle of dialogue, a call and response, in his performances. Hear him voice a complaint; hear “her” sympathetic or chiding reply. This was, of course, rooted in African-American musical custom going back at least as far as field hollers. But in King’s case, it was also probably informed, in part, by the cosmopolitan example of a lead singer entangled with a soloist’s obbligato: Jimmy Rushing and Ben Webster, Billie Holiday and Lester Young. “I’m kind of from the big-band era,” he told Blues Access magazine in 1999. “I was crazy about Benny Goodman, I liked Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Jimmie Lunceford and all the big bands that had blues singers with them.”

Through most of his career, King favored jazz-patterned horn sections, often clearing room for solos. He made his earliest records for the Bullet Recording and Transcription company in Nashville, with a murderers’ row of Memphis talent that included pianist Phineas Newborn Jr. and his guitarist brother Calvin. Once King became a touring act, in the ’50s, his band turned into a way station for jazz musicians. Half of this year’s class of NEA Jazz Masters, tenor saxophonists George Coleman and Charles Lloyd, had formative moments in King’s employ. “I went on the road with B.B. King in 1955,” Coleman told me recently; it was his first important gig outside of Memphis. After King’s death, Lloyd posted a note on Facebook: “I had the honor of playing with B.B. at [promoter] Sunbeam Mitchell’s Hippodrome in Memphis while I was still in high school,” he wrote.

There are traces of jazz on virtually any live recording by King, especially in his touring heyday. This is obviously true of Live at the Regal, his single finest album, recorded in Chicago in 1964. (And not just because one of its standout tracks-the slow-burn, excoriating “How Blue Can You Get?”-was credited to jazz critic Leonard Feather.) It’s maybe even clearer on a recording made at the Fillmore East on June 19, 1971. That concert begins with a funky jazz overture, with solos by most members of his band, which then included workhorses like the New Orleans saxophonist Earl Turbinton. Then, en route to delivering King’s smash “Every Day I Have the Blues,” the band slips in one chorus of “Blue Monk,” at a playfully bleary pace. When “Every Day” finally kicks in, it’s set as a galloping shuffle clearly meant to evoke Louis Jordan’s jump blues.

As he settled into elder-statesmanhood, King accepted the laurels and tributes that were his due. Clapton paid homage with the 2000 album Riding With the King-giving B.B. top billing, and sharing in the resulting Grammy win and multiplatinum sales. A few years later, King and Clapton were both guests of honor at a Jazz at Lincoln Center gala titled “Blowin’ the Blues Away,” hosted by Wynton Marsalis.

Early in May, when King was still hanging on in home hospice care, I saw Clapton play a 70th-birthday show at Madison Square Garden. There was no overt tribute, though the allegiance still rang clear. I did hear a proper dedication a week later at the Iridium, courtesy of bassist John Patitucci, who was once a member of King’s band. From his new album, Brooklyn (Three Faces), Patitucci played an original, “JLR,” clearly patterned after “The Thrill Is Gone.” The featured guitarist on the song was Adam Rogers, and he made his solo a brilliant referendum on the enduring greatness of King’s legacy: flinty and relaxed, with a formal architecture that only slowly revealed itself. King died the next day, and it was this act of pitch-perfect tribute that stuck with me. The King is dead, I couldn’t help but think. Long live the King!

 Jazz discourse often boils down to a narrative of progress. We talk about our art form moving forward, evolving, finding new ground. There’s a lot of sense in that approach but also a few pitfalls, as I like to remind myself from time to time. This fall I needed no reminder, owing to the contiguous release of two extraordinary albums made almost half a century apart: Offering: Live at Temple University (Resonance/Impulse!), a John Coltrane concert recording from 1966, and You’re Dead! (Warp), the latest opus from the electronic musician and producer known as Flying Lotus.

What struck me about these albums wasn’t just the music (though yes, it’s beyond striking in each case) but the commentary around their releases, which hit on a familiar note of progressivism. The odds are better that you’ve heard about the Coltrane album, whether or not you’ve actually heard it. Given the hurtling-meteor quality of the saxophonist’s mature career, and the fact that Offering was made a mere eight months before his death at 40, it’s no wonder so many reviewers got caught up in hypotheticals, musing about where he might have headed next. “What if Jazz Giant John Coltrane Had Lived?” read the headline to a piece by Ted Gioia on the website The Daily Beast. The novelist and critic Geoff Dyer, writing in The New York Review of Books, sniffed that this ecstatic, unruly music embodied “the momentum of what [Coltrane had] done before-and a situation he’d helped to create-carrying him towards a terminus, a brick wall, a dead-end or, in the cosmic scheme of things, some kind of interstellar void.”

My own feelings about Offering run more toward respectful curiosity, along with intermittent blushes of awe. But that isn’t my point here. Keep the example of Coltrane in mind as we turn to Flying Lotus, who let it be known over the last year that You’re Dead! would be his version of a modern jazz album-and, pointedly, a corrective to what he heard on the current scene. “The idea of jazz back in the day,” he told me recently, “is that it was supposed to grow and evolve and change, and be this great form of expression. I think it’s become stale over time. People stopped seeking; people stopped trying to take it further, and became obsessed with tradition.”

The natural instinct when faced with assertions like these is to spring into a defensive coil, or discredit the source out of hand. But Flying Lotus happens to come with meaningful pedigree: Born Steven Ellison in Los Angeles, he’s a great-nephew of Alice Coltrane, who can be heard playing piano on Offering. He has worked with his cousin Ravi Coltrane, and his stable of regular collaborators includes musicians like Kamasi Washington, an up-and-coming saxophonist loosely in the Coltrane lineage, and Thundercat, an electric bassist with all the flair of a young Stanley Clarke. Flying Lotus has also caught the ear of more than a few jazz artists-notably pianist Vijay Iyer, who covered one of the producer’s tunes, “MmmHmm,” on his acclaimed trio album from 2012, Accelerando.

Ellison made it clear, in conversation, that he was speaking in generalities about a perceived culture of stasis in jazz. But he reaffirmed that his new album was intended as a shot across the bow. “Just kind of being an outsider looking in, I saw an opportunity to make something new that I hadn’t really heard before,” he said. And on that point, I can find no reasonable grounds for argument; You’re Dead! is an audaciously original statement, a brilliant canvas stitched together from familiar scraps and shards, with plenty of live musicianship stirred into the mix. It could be seen as the latest in a line of hybridized electro-jazz projects that runs from Joe Zawinul to Jaga Jazzist, with varying degrees of success. For my money, it works far better than most, not by blurring the formal distinctions but by ratcheting up the tension.

Opening in an ominous hum, it ducks quickly into fusion overdrive, with tenor saxophone, electric bass and drums all scrambling for the upper hand. By the second track, “Tesla,” we encounter brushes shuffling fast across a snare drum, behind one of the album’s featured guests-Herbie Hancock, on Fender Rhodes, his swirling chords and slithery arpeggios amplifying an air of intrigue. Then comes “Cold Dead,” like a quantum leap from the original jazz-rock frontier, adrenalized and suggestively astral. And so it goes, each track making its impact within a couple of minutes before dissolving into the next.

But is it jazz? That strikes me as the least interesting of myriad questions you could ask about You’re Dead!, though for the record, Flying Lotus would answer in a guarded but dauntless affirmative. His musical influences behind the album ranged from the Miles Davis of Bitches Brew and In a Silent Way to the George Duke of The Aura Will Prevail, which places its frame of reference in the early-to-mid 1970s, a moment when jazz itself is often said to have run up against “a terminus, a brick wall, a dead-end,” to borrow Dyer’s turn of phrase. There have been a lot of rehabilitative efforts around the jazz crossover of that era, but few that so skillfully walk the tightrope between vintage appropriation and next-level experimentation.

You’re Dead! also features several Los Angeles rappers-the ascendant Kendrick Lamar, the avuncular Snoop Dogg and Flying Lotus himself, in the guise he calls Captain Murphy-and a lot of sonic elements that would seem to slot it as a hip-hop album. That shouldn’t be some kind of disqualifier for jazz listeners, though I’m sure it will be for some. Considering how many current jazz artists declare their admiration for the producer J Dilla, who made his mark along the hip-hop/jazz fault line more than a decade ago, it’s worth keeping an eye on the Flying Lotus nexus, and this album in particular. I suspect we’ll be talking about it for a while. ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912205597.84/warc/CC-MAIN-20190326160044-20190326182044-00338.warc.gz
143,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/the-gig/the-gig-lew-soloff-1924-2015/,"Lew Soloff He’s best remembered, out in the world, for 35 seconds of fire-breathing ingenuity on an epochal pop song. But Lew Soloff meant much more than his immortal trumpet solo on “Spinning Wheel,” which led off Side B of the 1968 LP Blood, Sweat & Tears.

A consummate lead player, a surefooted improviser, an impeccable technician and a generous mentor, Soloff occupied an important place in the New York jazz firmament for more than 40 years. He did this despite releasing fewer than 10 proper solo albums, and maybe just one-With a Song in My Heart (Milestone, 1999)-that saw widespread release. His legacy rests largely on the glowing work he did in large ensembles, typically as a first chair: a short list would include the Gil Evans Orchestra, the Carla Bley Big Band, the Carnegie Hall Jazz Orchestra and the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra. Among the earliest responses to his death was a tribute posted to Facebook by his fellow trumpeter and Jazz at Lincoln Center honcho Wynton Marsalis, who summed up by writing: “Tragic loss for music, irrecoupable loss for trumpet.” Soloff died in the early morning hours of March 8, after a massive heart attack. He was 71.

Word spread quickly among musicians, and social media made it possible to outline a crude topography of his influence. I learned of his death on Twitter, where alto saxophonist Jaleel Shaw had recalled playing alongside him in the Mingus Big Band. Ambrose Akinmusire memorialized him as “one of my favorite teachers and one of the baddest trumpeters ever.” Guitarist Jimmy Vivino, bandleader of choice for late-night talk show host Conan O’Brien, tweeted that “Gabriel will have to play 2nd chair now,” given that “Lew Soloff is on the job in Heaven’s Band.”

Another television bandleader-keyboardist Paul Shaffer, of Late Show With David Letterman-was among Soloff’s closest friends. “He could play anything with authority and credibility,” Shaffer said when I reached him. “And his ambition was always to be an artist, a soloist. But he had the kind of training that enabled him to become a number-one, first-call studio musician.”

Born in Brooklyn and raised in New Jersey, Soloff began playing the trumpet at age 10. As a teenager he spent his summers working at resorts around the Catskills, before studying at the Eastman School of Music, followed by Juilliard. His breakout gig in New York was with Machito, the first of many salsa and Latin-jazz legends who would seek out his services, including Mongo Santamaria and Tito Puente.

Soloff had a bright, clarion tone that he could harden at will, and his fluency on the horn was nearly absolute. He also had the ability to give a written line the breath of life, setting the pace for a section and, by extension, an entire band. By 1966 he was working not only with trumpeter Maynard Ferguson but also with the Gil Evans Orchestra. He played on a succession of Evans albums, including The Gil Evans Orchestra Plays the Music of Jimi Hendrix (RCA, 1974), and later hailed the wizardly composer-arranger as his “musical godfather.”

Few self-identified jazz musicians ever worked in as wide an array of settings. Soloff backed Frank Sinatra and Aretha Franklin, Paul Simon and Philip Glass. He played on countless television commercials and movie soundtracks. He was a founding member of the Manhattan Jazz Quintet, which released more than 30 years’ worth of albums on Japanese labels. And for the last decade he was a stalwart in Manhattan Brass, an acclaimed, broadminded classical quintet.

Soloff had been increasingly intent on his solo career in recent years, and one thing that stings about his loss is the sense that for all of his expansive accomplishments, he had something new to give. The only albums of his that I know well are With a Song in My Heart, with a rhythm section led by pianist Mulgrew Miller, and another Milestone release, Trumpet Legacy, co-credited to his fellow trumpeters Tom Harrell, Eddie Henderson and Nicholas Payton. Until I began writing this column, I’d never even heard of Soloff’s 1987 King album But Beautiful, with pianist Kenny Kirkland, bassist Richard Davis and drummer Elvin Jones.

The fact that Soloff is still most famous for his five-year tenure in Blood, Sweat & Tears should hardly be dismissed as the product of a glib cultural memory. “He downplayed it, but it was monumental,” said Shaffer, “and it opened up the boundaries of rock ‘n’ roll. It made people say, ‘Hey, there can be something called jazz-rock, where you incorporate more sophisticated elements but don’t lose the soul or the edge.’ He pioneered that.”

Soloff’s “Spinning Wheel” solo-which was edited out of the single version, but probably had something to do with the song’s Grammy Award for Best Arrangement Accompanying a Vocalist-is a compact tour de force. And it conveys his personality as a soloist, with a row of off-the-beat accents that melt into boppish swagger, and finally a stratospheric fanfare.

In the wake of Soloff’s death I stumbled across a clip on YouTube: video from Woodstock, where Blood, Sweat & Tears was the second-highest-paid act, after Jimi Hendrix. The trumpet solo in this “Spinning Wheel” is completely different; there’s hardly a lick in common with the album version. It’s less punchy but more searching, full of ideas, not remotely touched by compromise. In the end, it represents him well.

 One of the more remarkable albums to cross my path this spring is Wish the Children Would Come on Home (Songlines), a supremely assured debut by the Westerlies, whom you should really get to know. A repertory album devoted to the music of Wayne Horvitz-the astute pianist and composer who helped define New York’s downtown scene of the 1980s before he decamped to Seattle-it grabs the ear with a warm yet austere arrangement of timbres. The Westerlies, it so happens, is a brass quartet: Riley Mulherkar and Zubin Hensler on trumpets, and Andy Clausen and Willem de Koch on trombones. They grew up in Seattle, counting Horvitz among their mentors, and headed to New York for further training, at either the Manhattan School of Music or Juilliard. Two have since completed their studies; the other two are set to graduate next year.

My experience with these musicians falls slightly outside the usual critical purview, in that I first encountered them as seniors in high school. Four years ago, gathering intel for a story about the booming jazz ecosystem in Seattle, I paid visits to a pair of public schools there that tend to dominate Jazz at Lincoln Center’s Essentially Ellington High School Jazz Band Competition. I also stopped by Café Racer, a boho coffeehouse in the city’s University District, where I heard a disarmingly smart 10-piece band featuring students from both schools. This was the Split Stream Big Band, led by Andy Clausen, with Mulherkar and de Koch in the ranks. I was impressed enough-by the quality of Clausen’s writing, the vibrant clarity of the execution, and the initiative of all parties involved-to use that moment as a curtain-raiser for my piece, which ran in the New York Times. Of course it didn’t hurt that Mulherkar and Clausen each won awards of distinction at that year’s Essentially Ellington competition, or that Garfield High, the alma mater of every Westerly but Clausen, took first prize.

I made a mental note to keep my eye out for these musicians, knowing that it was just a matter of time before they entered active circulation. Clausen kept me looped in with the occasional e-mail, alerting me to the 2012 release of The Wishbone Suite (Table & Chairs), which featured his music for a clutch of hometown peers; its sprightly chamber-jazz aesthetic, with a palette including accordion and clarinet, revealed his admiration for the likes of John Hollenbeck’s Claudia Quintet. Aglow with youthful enthusiasm but also extremely savvy, that album squared with my initial impressions of Clausen.

Last spring, he sent out a press release announcing the Westerlies’ part in a Horvitz residency at the Stone. Had I been able to make one of those gigs, I might have had a better sense of what to expect from Wish the Children Would Come on Home. Consisting of roughly a dozen deftly reframed Horvitz compositions, sequenced as if to suggest a flowing continuity from track to track, it’s an impressive feat from almost any angle. The members of the group made their own repertory choices, drawing from across an intrepid body of original American music. Among the highlights are several tunes from Horvitz’s Otis Spann suite, previously recorded by the Seattle Chamber Players. “The Band With Muddy” becomes a tour de force of dynamics and breath control, with Mulherkar nailing a perilous series of pirouettes originally scored for flute or violins. A song from later in the timeline, “Waltz From Woman of Tokyo,” finds the trombones creating a hypnotic phase effect, in an echo of post-minimalist pianism.

When I checked in with Horvitz, he told me that two of the album’s shorter pieces, “Home” and “Triads,” had actually been adapted from études in his piano method book for children. The effect of the translation to brass, in each instance, is striking; “Home,” which rides something like a Gypsy oompah cadence, also features one of the album’s rare improvised solos. “I was there for the recording,” Horvitz said, alluding to a session last summer in Washington’s San Juan Islands, “and I remember saying, ‘Wow, this is almost weird. Each of you takes one solo on the whole record.'” Horvitz, who began teaching some of these players when they were in junior high, uses the word “egoless” to describe the ensemble’s interplay, and hearing the evidence, it’s hard not to agree.

Clausen, slightly more matter-of-fact, hit on the same idea. “Regardless of what instruments they played, we would still be making music together,” he said of his bandmates. “We all come from similar backgrounds and have similar musical agendas, and that’s what brings us together.” And what, I prodded, was at the heart of those agendas? “The music comes before any single person’s ego or ability,” he said. “There’s definitely a strong folk element,” he added, “and an interest in simplicity, which is a reaction to a lot of the other music happening in our generation, particularly in the conservatory.”

Given that the Westerlies formed as a showcase for the members’ original compositions, the new album could be said to suggest a departure as well as a declaration of arrival. Whatever the case, I’d urge you to do what I did four years ago in Seattle: Take note of these players. You’ll be hearing more from them soon.

 There is a Japanese visual art in which the artist is forced to be spontaneous. He must paint on a thin stretched parchment with a special brush and black water paint in such a way that an unnatural or interrupted stroke will destroy the line or break through the parchment. Erasures or changes are impossible. These artists must practice a particular discipline, that of allowing the idea to express itself in communication with their hands in such a direct way that deliberation cannot interfere.

You’re probably aware, astute reader, that the above text constitutes the first paragraph of Bill Evans’ liner notes to Kind of Blue, the immortal Miles Davis album from 1959. Reprinting it like so, without quotation marks or preamble, seemed the only fitting way to open this column, devoted as it is to Blue, an ingenious and preposterous new album by Mostly Other People Do the Killing. The latest in a series of sharply antic releases on bassist Moppa Elliott’s Hot Cup Records, it’s a painstakingly realized, note-for-note recreation of Kind of Blue. Close enough to the original article to hoodwink even a seasoned listener (go ahead, try it at home), the album is about as far from Evans’ articulated ideal of spontaneous mastery as a Buick Regal is from a bonsai tree.

For anyone familiar with the roughly decade-long trajectory of Mostly Other People Do the Killing-at its core a quartet with Elliott on bass, Peter Evans on trumpet, Jon Irabagon on saxophones and Kevin Shea on drums-this latest provocation should seem true to form. MOPDtK has made a habit of smartly hijacking jazz conventions. Whatever your gut feeling about their act-those deadpan nods to iconic album covers, that gleefully curdled air of lunatics running the asylum-it was always clear that they had a point to make about received wisdom in jazz culture. It was also apparent that they backed up their bluster with a hardcore musical command. All of which brings us back around to Blue and the most interesting question around it, which is “Why?” The band leaves a puckish clue in the form of a CD booklet-not a reprint of Evans’ Asiatic rumination, but a 1939 short story by the intellectually frisky Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges. First published in English in ’62, with the title “Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote,” it’s a bedrock text of postmodern literary theory, an examination of the very essence of authorship and meaning. In brief, it concerns a fictional writer who has, for complicated reasons, set out to compose whole sections of Miguel de Cervantes’ Don Quixote as if they were his own. “I have assumed the mysterious obligation to reconstruct, word for word, the novel that for him was spontaneous,” Menard is said to have declared.

Borges’ narrator, appraising this (ahem, cough) quixotic endeavor as “a task of infinite complexity, a task futile from the outset,” nevertheless hails it as a visionary act, partly because of its intentionality and partly because of Menard’s place in time. Recreating Don Quixote, a 17th-century canonical text, meant not only a conscious affectation of its antiquated style but also a challenge to his own historical view of the world, not to mention his context for the work itself: “The Quixote, Menard remarked, was first and foremost a pleasant book; it is now an occasion for patriotic toasts, grammatical arrogance, obscene deluxe editions. Fame is a form-perhaps the worst form-of incomprehension.”

At this point, we should all be able to draw the connection to Kind of Blue, a consensus masterpiece of recorded jazz, so valorized that it’s almost impossible to see clearly. Among its obscene deluxe editions, to borrow Borges’ wonderfully tart line, is a 50th anniversary box set on Columbia/Legacy, consisting of two CDs, a DVD and a 180-gram LP on blue vinyl, along with a glossy booklet, poster and mock-memorabilia (e.g., a reproduction of Evans’ liner notes, hand-scrawled in tidy blue cursive).

Embracing the irony, I recently put that blue LP on my turntable and Blue in the CD carousel, and simultaneously cued up both versions of “All Blues,” toggling between them every five seconds or so. The verisimilitude was stunning. At one point during the alto saxophone solo, I lost track: Was that Irabagon or Cannonball Adderley? I had some analogous moments with Evans’ poignantly Milesian intonation and with Shea’s drumming, which seemed to capture Jimmy Cobb down to the last grace note. As in the Borges story, what inspired my awe was the immaculate retracing of something that had originally been conjured whole.

Given that the improvisations on Kind of Blue have become, through a convergence of reputation and repetition, as familiar as many a well-known composition, it’s a clever trick to treat them as such. Still, nailing a transcription is one thing; Blue belongs to another order of accomplishment. We’ve heard endless tributes to Davis’ epochal album, but never one that so skillfully captures its aura, and flips the whole notion of tribute on its head. Listen carefully and you’ll catch the imperfections-say, how pianist Ron Stabinsky, who does a strikingly real Bill Evans, sounds shakier doing Wynton Kelly. But that’s beside the point.

What is the point, really? For me, it’s that an album so singular in the jazz imagination can in fact be credibly remade by musicians a world apart from Davis and his crew. Maybe that sounds cold and demystifying, but I found it strangely comforting. We in the jazz world often fret about whether young musicians are truly absorbing the language. Here’s your proof. In some appreciable way, they even helped me hear the old album anew. Returning to the metaphor of a line drawn on parchment, I’ll let Borges write my kicker: “I have reflected that it is legitimate to see the ‘final’ Quixote as a kind of palimpsest, in which the traces-faint but not undecipherable-of our friend’s ‘previous’ text must shine through.” ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912204969.39/warc/CC-MAIN-20190326095131-20190326121131-00410.warc.gz

 Sometimes a piece of music waits for its moment. Heroes + Misfits, the rock-and-R&B-steeped debut by pianist Kris Bowers, was released on Concord last March, and for a while I regarded it a bit warily: Though I admired its clarity of purpose and execution, I couldn’t fully embrace the album’s urgent, portentous air.

Then I saw Bowers and his band at the Charlie Parker Jazz Festival, in Harlem’s Marcus Garvey Park. More to the point, I heard them play an electrifying version of “#TheProtester,” track three on the album, with an imploring ad-lib vocal by Chris Turner.

“Who are we?” Turner sang plaintively. “What are we?/What are we to do?” He repeated those questions as a refrain, making meaningful tweaks-like “Who are we to you?”-before lowering the boom, with anguished allusions to the situation on the ground in an American city. It was late August, and I’m certain that no one in that age-diverse Harlem crowd needed to be told that Turner was invoking Ferguson, Mo., where citizen protests had been going strong in the wake of a police shooting, two weeks earlier, that took the life of an unarmed 18-year-old African-American, Michael Brown. Poignant and raw, the performance resonated with the national mood-and altered my perception of Bowers’ album, which no longer felt quite so overdetermined.

By almost any measure we’ve been living through an era of deep tensions in this nation, driven in large part by institutionalized racial injustice. The slaying of Michael Brown came only weeks after Eric Garner, another unarmed black man, was choked to death by a New York City police officer. Mass protests across the country, sparked by a grand jury’s decision not to indict Garner’s killer, found a rallying cry in “Black Lives Matter”-an activist movement launched the previous year, when a Florida jury acquitted George Zimmerman in the death of Trayvon Martin. That verdict, in turn, had arrived just as the movie Fruitvale Station, about the killing of Oscar Grant at the hands of Oakland transit police, was opening in theaters nationwide.

“Race happens in the gap between appearance and the perception of difference,” writes the cultural scholar Jeff Chang in Who We Be: The Colorization of America, a brilliant and ambitious new book from St. Martin’s Press. An interrogation of the rise of multiculturalism over the last 40 years, Chang’s study is dispassionate in tone but pointed in its stance. (Compare the declarative swagger of “Who We Be” with the pained ambiguity of Turner’s lyric “Who are we?”)

Three pages into the introduction of Who We Be, Chang cites an as-yet-unpublished essay by pianist-composer Vijay Iyer, making the case for music as an instrument of empathy, a means by which African-Americans have historically elided those stubborn perceptions of difference. It’s no coincidence that Iyer, perhaps more than any jazz artist of our time, has applied his musical output toward the cause of social justice.

The centerpiece of Wiring (Intakt), a superb recent album by the avant-garde collective Trio 3, featuring Iyer as a guest, is his “Suite for Trayvon (And Thousands More),” a three-part composition that opens in swinging angularity, proceeds to a Julius Hemphill-like groove section and concludes in a mournful dirge.

Late in 2014, during Iyer’s three-night residency at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, he began each concert with a striking tableau: human bodies lying strewn across the stage, and then engaging in a semaphore familiar from our long season of protests, notably the rhetorical gesture of both hands raised. “The music coalesced into rhythmic, tolling modal chords,” wrote Jon Pareles in his review for the New York Times. “‘Black Lives Matter’ read the screen overhead. It was an activist elegy.”

Of course, there’s ample precedent for social protest in jazz, notably during the civil-rights movement: Charles Mingus, Max Roach with Abbey Lincoln, Rahsaan Roland Kirk, Archie Shepp. One thing that has differentiated their contemporary heirs is the wildfire pace and viral potential of social media. (Bowers was really on to something when he settled on “#TheProtester” as a song title; its typographical flourish grew ever more relevant in the wake of #BlackLivesMatter and a related, Eric Garner-inspired Twitter hashtag, #ICantBreathe.) Another distinguishing factor has to do with the terms of debate: Our present moment is riven by bickering about whether a so-called “post-racial” society, one that has seen the reelection of a black president, could possibly be as troubled as it seems. That might be one reason why the commentators in jazz’s ranks fixate on specific, unequivocal tragedies rather than more nebulous, systemic problems.

I’m thinking not only of Iyer but also pianist Orrin Evans-and trumpeter Ambrose Akinmusire, whose 2011 Blue Note debut includes a track dedicated to Oscar Grant. Last year Akinmusire released The Imagined Savior Is Far Easier to Paint, an impressively assured follow-up that included “Rollcall for Those Absent,” a litany of names including Grant, Trayvon Martin and Amadou Diallo.

Akinmusire’s next album could well include a memorial tribute to Mike Brown and Eric Garner-and 12-year-old Tamir Rice, and 18-year-old Antonio Martin, and whoever follows in their grim example. There’s obvious reason to exhort Akinmusire, Iyer and Bowers to continue these efforts. And from this soapbox, I’d like to urge others in our ranks to join them. (Surely Wynton Marsalis, the influential force behind Blood on the Fields and Black Codes [From the Underground], has something to say at this juncture?) Art can be not only a mirror for society but also a catalyst. But only if we grant it those powers, and only if it finds a means of expression.

 The Thelonious Monk International Jazz Vocals Competition, held the first week of October in Washington, D.C., introduced the world to at least one promising new talent: Cécile McLorin Salvant, a 21-year-old Floridian who has spent the last several years honing her craft in Aix-en-Provence, France. As winner of the competition, the most prestigious of its kind, Salvant won a $20,000 scholarship and the potentially more valuable prize of a recording contract with the Concord Music Group. We’ll be hearing more from her.

Meanwhile, the competition and its attendant coverage invites a conversation about what really constitutes “jazz vocals” today. It’s a timely question, in light of the new book by Will Friedwald, A Biographical Guide to the Great Jazz and Pop Singers (Pantheon), reviewed in this issue. At a time when jazz itself slips past so many stylistic checkpoints, what distinguishes jazz singing from the other vocal arts? What are the criteria, and what do they reward? What, for that matter, do they exclude?

The Monk Competition, as always, did its best to establish a quantitative system. Among the guidelines for evaluation were such genre-blind fundamentals as pitch, intonation and tone, as well as stage presence and dynamics. Still, given a judges’ panel as jazz-literate and pop-savvy as this one-it included Patti Austin, Dee Dee Bridgewater, Kurt Elling, Al Jarreau and Dianne Reeves-there were endless subtleties and subjectivities also in play. Were the competitors judged on swing? On the ease and ingenuity of their scatting? On the hipness of their repertoire? We don’t know, but I’d guess so. And, by that token, there was no mistaking the bona fides of Salvant, whose performance at the semifinals I’ve studied carefully, albeit after the fact. (Footage is available at Ustream.tv.)

She opened by confidently scatting through a version of “Bernie’s Tune,” and then went on to tackle songs by Monk (“Monk’s Mood”) and Bessie Smith (“Take It Right Back”). Some of this was standard protocol: During the semis, everyone had to sing an uptempo piece, a ballad and a Monk tune. At one point Salvant went in for extra credit, juicing her “Bernie’s Tune” scat choruses with a quotation of Monk’s “Nutty.” Her projection was strong, either swoopingly Vaughan-like (as in Sarah) or stoutly Lincoln-esque (as in Abbey). She sounded prepossessingly aware of her lineage, and, whatever else you might say about her, she sounded clearly, unmistakably like a jazz singer.

But then so does Gretchen Parlato, who won the Monk Competition the last time it focused its high beam on vocalists, in 2004. Parlato, whom I hope you’ve heard-In a Dream (ObliqSound), her sophomore album, was one of last year’s standout vocal releases-sings in a sleek cadence, silvery but sure, and with the cosmopolitan gleam of our era. Her style inhabits the same plane as, say, bassist-turned-vocalist Esperanza Spalding, with whom she has memorably recorded. It’s an improviser’s style, sinuous and agile. Yet if you were to impose the strictest definition of jazz singing, one dependent on songbook extraction and rhythmic swing, it might not fit the bill.

What is jazz singing, anyway? Friedwald got into that rhetorical bramble some 20 years ago, in a previous book of his, Jazz Singing. (Originally published by Scribner’s, it was later reprinted on Da Capo.) “Definitions confuse as much as they illuminate,” were his very first words, in a preface that goes on to ponder the generally accepted parameters of jazz singing and the inexact nature of determining them. Despite the elegant drift of his argument, readers are left to shrug their shoulders and forge ahead. Jazz singing is apparently like hardcore pornography, insofar as you know it when you see it (and there’s occasionally an unseemly bit of grunting).

And as we’ve seen so many times, it’s easier to meet the outward requirements than it is to fulfill the inner ones. Rod Stewart just released Fly Me to the Moon … The Great American Songbook Volume V, on J Records. Volume V! All these standards later and he’s still no closer to being a jazz singer. I would argue that a similar artificiality suffuses the output of Nikki Yanofsky, the teenaged jazz-vocal phenom, whose fealty to Ella Fitzgerald skirts the edge of impersonation.

Meanwhile, on the other side of the fence, there’s a world of feeling in the output of the R&B singers Beyoncé and Bilal, or the indie-rock singer-songwriters Justin Vernon (Bon Iver) and Daniel Rossen (Grizzly Bear). Those artists were all jazz-trained, to one degree or another, and the training has fed their art. I’m thinking of a line from Friedwald’s preface: “There are many completely jazzless singers who have more to say to jazz as a whole than most jazz singers, such as Mabel Mercer and Edith Piaf.” (Friedwald, rarely on point when it comes to present-day pop, knows his mid-century warblers cold.)

All of which leads me to José James, a lithe and charismatic vocalist, and the subject of a cautionary tale. James, who competed against Parlato in the Monk semifinals six years ago, has made his career with a seductive strain of post-millennial soul, most winningly last year, on an album called Blackmagic (Brownswood). It wasn’t jazz; it wasn’t trying to be. Then, this year, he released For All We Know (Verve), with the Belgian pianist Jef Neve. Hailed in some quarters as a valentine to Johnny Hartman-esque balladry, the album is at best a tepid bath, not half as vital as James’ main line of work. It is obviously a jazz album, though; that much can be said, weakly, in its favor.

By contrast, consider the brilliant new album by Theo Bleckmann, a willowy fixture in the John Hollenbeck Large Ensemble. I Dwell in Possibility (Winter & Winter) is a solo-voice recital, with Bleckmann accompanying himself on an array of instruments, from autoharp to zither. The closest it comes to jazz orthodoxy is a debonair version of “Comes Love,” with upbeats creaked on an Indonesian frog buzzer. Yet I can’t help but imagine someone like Bleckmann (is there anyone else like Bleckmann?) onstage at the Monk Competition, bewitching and befuddling the audience. Possibility-now there’s one thing jazz singing shouldn’t do without. ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912206677.94/warc/CC-MAIN-20190326220507-20190327002507-00475.warc.gz
148,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/the-gig/why-jazztimes-matters/,"One day this June, jazz critic Peter Hum published an item on his blog, Jazzblog.ca, titled “Two reasons why YouTube is the new DownBeat.” Embedded in the post was a pair of video clips, each a few minutes long. Beneath one, Hum lobbed a rhetorical question: “Down the road, when Chris Potter’s Underground releases its next disc, perhaps DownBeat will have a preview story. But will it be any more revealing than this?”

Man, I sure hope so. Unless standards have declined more precipitously than I thought, such a story would shed light on Potter’s track record as a saxophonist and bandleader, and on the particulars of his band’s rapport. It would feature first-person testimony from Potter, his sidemen and maybe even an objective outsider or two. Depending on the writer, it might incorporate some acute critical perspective, thereby putting the band’s music in context and gauging its impact on the scene. In short, this hypothetical profile would reflect the deliberative values of proper journalism. So ideally, yes: It would be more revealing than a montage of rehearsal footage spliced together for promotional use.

I’m being a little unfair to Hum, whose main point seemed to be that the open access and fast metabolism of YouTube-and by extension, the Web itself-had overtaken a basic function of jazz periodicals. DownBeat was his target of choice, but he could just as well have picked the magazine you’re presently reading. And like most arguments about the obsolescence of print, this one has its merits. JazzTimes operates under the restrictions of a monthly publication, restrictions that affect its freshness and flexibility. Its content is more static than dynamic, to sling around some old jargon from my years in online media. Then there’s the financial picture: A little over a year ago, as you may recall, JazzTimes suspended operations while courting potential investors. After much hand-wringing by jazz folk, present company included, the story ended happily, with Madavor Media taking the reins and production clanking back into gear. But as some in the blogosphere mused, who still had any use for the thing?

Plenty of people, it turns out. Two days after Hum’s blog post appeared, JazzTimes won Periodical of the Year for the umpteenth time at the 2010 JJA Jazz Awards. (By the way, if for some reason you haven’t yet inoculated yourself against my subjectivity, now’s the time. Check? Check.) Those accolades, bestowed by the Jazz Journalists Association, recognized the general excellence of the magazine-and I’d suggest that “general” merits nearly as much consideration as “excellence” here. JazzTimes, like its archrival DownBeat, takes a knowingly broad approach to its subject. There are obvious reasons for such a practice, including a drive for market share. But it’s also the result of a philosophical stance, a conviction that the jazz populace deserves full-spectrum coverage of its art, which has come to involve so many different dialects and practices.

The jazz Internet doesn’t really work that way. Most blogs involve the musings of a single opinionator, or a handful of fairly likeminded ones. The Gig, my own corner of the blogosphere (thegig.typepad.com), hews to that ineluctable truth, as does Jazzblog.ca. And so for that matter does Rifftides (artsjournal.com/rifftides), the five-year-old online home of Doug Ramsey, which won the JJA Award for Blog of the Year. I’ve cited just three examples, all by writers who have toiled in the salt mine of print journalism, and who strive for a catholic range of coverage. Hum’s day job is with the Ottawa Citizen; Ramsey is a longtime newspaperman himself, and a former JazzTimes contributor.

There are admirable jazz blogs maintained by writers with no such training, but I’d call those an exception to the rule. And the jazz discourse on Twitter mainly strikes me as a vehicle for frothy hyperbole, self-promotion and virtual shouting matches, with the occasional flash of wit (and a lot of linkage to material generated by the brick-and-mortar jazz media). An echo chamber? Not exactly, but it does seem telling that of the four comments under Hum’s YouTube post (at this writing), three are by his fellow jazz bloggers, all Twitter regulars besides.

When I asked Ramsey to weigh in on the continuing value of oldfangled jazz periodicals, he began by homing in on the medium itself. “There are people who depend on print-and in fact prefer print, and the leisurely opportunities it provides to the helter-skelter online,” he said. “I hope that that desire for reflection and depth will never go away.” Hey, wait a minute: Was he implying that reflection and depth were relative scarcities on the jazz Internet? Long pause. “By and large, the reviews I read on Internet-only Web sites I find generally shallow,” he said. (“God, I’m going to pay for this,” he added, with a sigh.) “It’s quick hits, without much reflection, and frankly, in far too many cases, without any evidence that the writer has real understanding of the music, real depth of feeling for the music. There’s an awful lot of surface, publicity-like reviewing going on.”

I know what you’re thinking: Some of that goes on in the pages of JazzTimes too. Fair enough, but I’d go with its track record just about any day. And the art of the scrupulously sourced long-form article remains a print phenomenon, by and large. Consider the smart, deeply reported profiles often penned for this magazine by my colleague David R. Adler. You won’t easily find their like online, even at Lerterland (lerterland.blogspot.com), Adler’s estimable blog.

What’s needed now is merely a shift in perception on all sides. JazzTimes has been beefing up its online presence, a trend I hope will continue, even as I maintain my faith in the glossy that arrives in my mailbox every month. Meanwhile, a note to the skeptics and futurists, to anyone carping about this magazine’s relevance as it enters its 40th year: We’re all in this together. Yeah, you heard me. You too.

150,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/voices/al-jarreau-an-american-original/,"Al Jarreau (photo by Tony Adamo) Al Jarreau is a master of rhythms from around the world. His bag of sounds and improvisations is informed by a host of influences—the music of the church and Africa and Brazil, for example—administered with a taste of funk. He can take you on a magic carpet ride, high above the maddening static of tweets, cell phones and digital overload. (Though he’s not above referencing those sounds when he sings.) He thrills me with his spontaneous creativity and his humor, humanity and love. Al’s got a whole lot of it. I felt this up close in January 2015, at the Thelonious Monk Institute International Jazz Competition in Los Angeles. Al was a judge. When we met I began the process of arranging an interview for Voices in Jazz—no small task given his schedule. We witnessed a special competition that afternoon, won by New Jersey native Jazzmeia Horn. That evening, Al performed a magical rendition of Michael Jackson’s “Human Nature.” It was pure Jarreau, and it continues to echo in my dreams. Months later, after much back and forth, Al and I connected again. We talked and laughed for over an hour. Wisdom and great stories poured from his lips. I felt like I was in the presence of a sage. I learned about his history and how he developed one of the most original voices in jazz. I am proud to share this conversation with you. Sadly, on Feb. 7, Al canceled his remaining live dates and announced his retirement from touring via his website. The statement read: “Al Jarreau is in the hospital in Los Angeles, due to exhaustion. He is receiving excellent medical care, responding to treatments, and improving slowly. The medical team has instructed that he cannot perform any of his remaining 2017 concert dates. Therefore, with complete sorrow, Al Jarreau must retire from touring. He is thankful for his 50 years of traveling the world in ministry through music, and for everyone who shared this with him: his faithful audience, the dedicated musicians, and so many others who supported his effort.” Roseanna Vitro: What’s your earliest memory of music? Al Jarreau: Sitting on the bench by my mom, singing in church. I could feel my heart’s “echo-grams,” and it proved that music is immediate. I could feel it. I’m always listening to my body. Rhythm and the creative source are put into our lives. Singing is like painting. It’s deep in your core, your message. It starts early. If it ain’t music, people need to find something they love to do and then do it for free. Something that floats their boat, that completes their life, that makes it right. Even knitting or sewing! Find something that makes you enjoy life. RV: What touched you? How early did you know you wanted to be a singer? AJ: Always! As soon as I could remember singing “Jesus Loves Me.” RV: I know your mom was a pianist and your dad was a Seventh-day Adventist preacher. How much of an influence were your parents on your music? AJ: Everyone sang in the house. My sisters played piano, but not seriously. I was a baseball guy, but at 19 years old I gave it up. I was a free spirit, but didn’t study music; I sang in doo-wop quartets. I loved singing the basslines. I was always singing. In junior high school, I sang in big choirs with 90 singers, tunes like “Red Sails in the Sunset.” I learned everything by ear. RV: How did you master your percussive rhythms and original sounds? AJ:  In 1965 I was a rehab counselor in the Bay Area and I’d sing at night, but I wasn’t good at being a rehab counselor. It was too rigid. I felt like I was an ordinary singer, not original, not like a young Tony Bennett or Diana Krall. In ’64 through ’65 I began delving deep into Afro-Cuban rhythms, the music of Tito Puente and Cal Tjader. But when I heard the music, melodies and rhythms from Brazil—God, I fell in love. Here’s a story: I was in a shoemaker store to have a new belt made. You’ll never believe a man came over to me—and it was Sergio Mendes! Oh my goodness, one of my heroes. I could never get enough of Brazil ’66—the melodies, changes, the rhythm. I loved Astrud Gilberto. She was amazing, so beautiful but so simple. As a singer, you have to remember the lesson that it’s in your story. Minimal works. In 1965 I started singing with the George Duke Trio. I stood up in front of that trio for five years at the Half Note in San Francisco. The music was great and I loved my dear friend, but I decided it was time to go on my own. I wanted to work with only solo guitar. So it was guitar, me, my cabasa shaker, a microphone and a stand. I had decided that a keyboard, drums and bass take up a whole lotta space. This was my opportunity to sing everything I was hearing, to experiment. This was a very formative and fertile period for my technique. I was listening to music all the time, all the Brazilian percussion. RV: You were discovered shortly after this period. You performed on Johnny Carson, Mike Douglas, many of the popular television shows. What are your favorite memories from those days? AJ: Some of my favorite memories are working on We Got By, “We’re in This Love Together,” Breakin’ Away, “Blue Rondo à la Turk.” Man, there was a lot of overdubbing there. I was touring and life was good. There was “After All” in 1984; that was a good year. In 1986 I worked with my friend Nile Rodgers who produced L is for Lover in New York at Skyline Studios. RV: You’ve performed with the greats, and one of my favorites was the late Joe Sample. What are your memories of Joe? AJ:  Laughter, so much joyous laughter. Joe’s personality and his approach to life, you can hear it in the music. You have to hear Joe’s work on Children of the Sun with the NDR Big Band; it was all about slaves, plantations, the Caribbean, etc. We toured together. I sang some Gershwin, “Porgy and Bess.” I miss Joe Sample. RV: What was it like when you gigged with Chick Corea? AJ: Chick has a beautiful spirit. We connected. He’s very serious with spiritual notions. He’s very religious in his own way. The way he applies it, it’s always about the possibility of people doing better. There’s pure brilliance coming out of his hands. RV: What are your thoughts on Miles Davis? AJ: I know he listened all the time. He was about knowing the lyric. It’s a message for singers. Find the message and if you’re a writer, use your language. He sang through his horn. RV: Jon Hendricks is the Godfather of Vocalese. What was it like to sing on Jon’s historic album Freddie Freeloader? [Editor’s note: Godfather of Vocalese is also the title of a 1990 album by vocalist Eddie Jefferson.] AJ: Jon just called me up and asked, “Will you sing with Bobby McFerrin and George Benson?” I memorized all the lyrics and the Miles solo—yes, I learned it—walked into the studio and we just recorded it. I only had a few fixes. It was all done by ear. RV: What do you look for in a band? AJ: First, on piano, I need someone who knows simplicity and complexity, someone who listens well. A musician who can find those delicious additional notes in the chord that bring you to tears or make you jump up and dance. I love sophisticated chords around the melody, and like Bill Evans said, “Listen, always listen.” On bass, I like an upright bass player, a cat who finds the root and is sensitive to the foundation. Of course his time has to be good and, again, listen, always listen. The same for the drummer—lots of chops, but they shouldn’t forget they’re accompanying. Feeling the foot tapping on the floor is fine, but we’ve gotten beyond just that. Support! RV: As a master vocalist with years of service to the cause, do you have any advice for young singers? AJ: Sit down and shut up and sing your song. Do it because you love it. If you don’t love it, become a doctor. Sing because you love it and you can’t live without it. I’d advise all jazz singers and students to check out Al’s virtuosity on his recordings and YouTube clips. In particular: “Agua de Beber” – Glow (1976)
“Take Five,””Better Than Anything”  –  Look to the Rainbow (1977)
“Spain” – This Time (1980)
“(Round, Round, Round) Blue Rondo à la Turk” – Breakin’ Away (1981)
“Mas Que Nada” – Tenderness (1994)
“Compared to What” – The Best of Al Jarreau (1996)
“Cold Duck” – Accentuate the Positive (2004)   ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912203326.34/warc/CC-MAIN-20190324043400-20190324065400-00019.warc.gz
151,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/voices/bob-dorough-bebop-crusader-original-hipster/,"Bob Dorough Bob Dorough is as unique as the original Arkansas diamond. His lyrics are clever and his melodies are full of twists, turns and modulations, leading your ears on a roller coaster ride through several keys. There’s no better example than one of his most famous compositions, “Nothing Like You Has Ever Been Seen Before,” recorded with Miles Davis on The Sorcerer, lyrics by Fran Landesman. Bob’s voice is intense and hushed. Imagine a breathy Edward G. Robinson with a southern lilt, coated with buttermilk and cornbread soul. He caresses every word and draws you in with his energy and command of his craft.

I’ve been listening to Bob since 1978. In those days, the musicians who adopted me into jazz music in Houston turned me on to Blossom Dearie, Jackie Cain and Roy Kral and Bob. If you were good enough to channel your way through “Nothing Like You …” without changing keys, it was a mark of good musicianship. I took the challenge and recorded “Nothing Like You…” on my first album with Kenny Barron’s trio. A short list of Bob’s classics might start with: “Devil May Care,” “I’m Hip,” “Love Came on Stealthy Fingers,” “But For Now,” “Small Day Tomorrow,” and the coolest, “Blue Xmas.” They’re all classics and recorded by countless jazz vocalists around the world. In the ’70s, Bob became the voice of School House Rock. No one but Bob could have written, “Three is the Magic Number.” A new generation learned multiplication tables from the original Bebop Crusader, Mr. Bob Dorough. I spent two hours interviewing Bob recently and listened intently, knowing I’m hearing stories from a true original.

RV: What are your earliest memories of music that inspired you and was there anyone in your family who encouraged you to be a musician?

BD: Not my mother or father, even though they sang in church and Dad could play “The Old Rugged Cross” on the piano. My Uncle Fred, the youngest of the Lewis clan, was still at home those days. And he would sit on the front porch and play the guitar and sing songs, mostly cowboy tragedy songs. I’d sit and listen; he was like my big brother. Grandpa Lewis had a farm we used to visit on holidays and summers. It was what they called a hard luck farm, in the southwest corner of Arkansas, not far from Texarkana. In his house was an old pump organ, and that intrigued me a little.

My Dad was a salesman-cars and insurance mostly. He thought he was a city slicker, but he was a high-class country boy. We moved around a lot for his work. In my early childhood we lived briefly in Mena, Hot Springs, Little Rock, De Queen, Hope, and Texarkana, Arkansas. Eventually we moved to Plainview, Texas, and my real inspiration came in the Plainview High School Band.

Back in Arkansas, we used to go to the movies on Saturdays and they’d have an amateur contest. My Aunt Florence took me there to sing a couple of songs and I won second place. There was a fiddler who won first place. When I was four or five years old I used to sing two songs like, “My Blue Heaven,” verse and chorus a cappella and the second song was “When Annie Was a Little Girl,” a school song. When I sing “I Get the Neck of the Chicken,” I remember learning it as a five-year-old with my mother playing the radio. We didn’t have television or a record player. It was a pop tune and she said on the fifth day they played it, I sang along with them.

I played some violin and piano and I always played the mouth harp. There was a Mrs. Keene, the piano teacher who also owned a store and owed my dad money. He was selling bread and she was behind on her bread bill. She bartered lessons to pay my dad back. She had a piano in the back of her store and taught me piano on the barter system. She loaned me pop sheet music and she’d let me take the music home and bring it back the next week.

RV: So you discovered you had the discipline and desire to practice?

BD: I didn’t have the discipline to practice like the great instrumentalists and I don’t consider myself a great piano player. I practiced a little. She gave me five-finger exercises and sent me home with songs like “Underneath the Harlem Moon.” I was trying to read the sheet music but I couldn’t quite cut it reading, so I’d analyze the harmony and make up my own arrangements. Because we moved a lot, sometimes we would have a piano, and sometimes we wouldn’t. After we moved to Plainview, Texas, there was a spinet piano that was considered mine. I was twelve years old and in the eighth grade.

RV: Plainview is where you really started to develop. What style of music did you play in those early days?

BD: I sang simple songs like “Red River Valley”- it was Texas after all. The key of G was my favorite key. I could play in other keys but I was figuring out harmony on my own. I was drafted into the band. The director was a professional trumpet and clarinet player in Chicago who’d moved to Plainview for his asthma. It was a lucky blow for me. Robert Coleman Davidson was his name, but we called him Chief. There was an aptitude test in high school. It was an ear training profile test around 1938, and I scored high and Chief came to get me. He knocked on our door and said to my mom, “Your son is very talented and I think he ought to be in the band.” He looked at me and said, “I think you look like you could play clarinet.”  So, that’s what I played in high school. There was a huge marching band in football season and in the spring we had concerts and ensemble contests.

RV: Since Chief played trumpet and came from Chicago, did he play any jazz?

BD: He didn’t like jazz. He said, “That jazz stuff will ruin your lip.” He had me playing classical stuff, like Mozart and Verdi. Lucky for me, one of the drummers said, “Robert, let’s start a jazz band!” We were hearing Harry James and Benny Goodman on the radio. We had a Downbeat and ordered stock arrangements like “In the Mood” and whatever was popular. I didn’t have a sax, and I noticed that most of the solos were in the 2nd tenor part, so I’d play the 2nd tenor part on the clarinet. It was an octave higher, but we had fun.

RV: I can see this was your pivotal turn into jazz when you heard Benny Goodman and Harry James music. You were lucky, I didn’t hear any jazz until I left Arkansas in the early 70’s. How did your parents feel about your becoming a musician?

BD: In the band, everyone was playing something different, so I dug in and learned the 3rd clarinet part. Robert C. Davidson gave me free lessons and, after two weeks, I informed my parents, “I’m gonna become a musician.” They didn’t put up a fight. Mother said, “That sounds nice.” My father said, “Well, as long as you do it good, I guess that’s all right.”

Somehow I got hooked up with a combo, an attempt at a big band with two or three saxophones and a couple of trumpets. We actually played a gig in high school, more of a country thing. I played piano and was the rhythm section, because they needed a beat. I could play pretty well, especially if it was in G! I loved the band so much, that I stuck around and took a high school course after graduation. Chief had promised to institute a course in basic harmony, Bach, and the theory behind the stuff that I had been figuring out on my own.

Before being drafted, I moved on to Lubbock, Texas and majored in band at Texas Tech for three semesters. By this time I was writing music for the big band. In Lubbock there were these hot cats playing clarinet, trombone and rhythm. They played somewhere between Benny Goodman and Jack Teagarden-a little bit Dixie and a little bit Swing. I studied solfeggio at 18 and 19 years old.

RV: When you studied solfeggio, did you prefer  fixed do or moveable do? Do you sing numbers (1,3,5,7) or solfeggio syllables, do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do ?

BD: I like numbers, like 1-3-5-7-9-7-5. Did you ever hear my Pedigogical Round that was recorded by Spanky and our Gang? [He sings it.]  (check this out)

RV: The addition of scat singing books and programs are growing a new crop of very hip singers. What’s your first recollection of scat singing?

BD: Louis Armstrong started doing it because he couldn’t think of the words. Improvisation was already in my head. When you imitate a horn, you’re scatting.

RV: When I first tip-toed into scat singing, I remember Fred Hersch, (whom I believed could do no wrong at the time) telling me Ella Fitzgerald was singing a lot of licks she’d learned, clichés and wasn’t really improvising on the same level as a great instrumentalist. For me, Ella could do no wrong, but I’m grateful to the musicians who enlightened me along the way. Your musicianship and songwriting have always inspired me.

When did you first start composing? Did you study composing when you were in the Army Band or at North Texas State?

BD: When I was plowing in Plainview, alone with a horse and a plow-they call it harrowing-riding on a sled, spikes scraping the soil, and you’re standing on a platform. The first thing I wrote was:

Sittin’ on the doorstep, with my bride
Sittin’ on the doorstep side by side
Sittin’ on the doorstep
Tonight we’ll do the four-step
Sittin’ on the doorstep with my bride

I’d think about it while plowing then sit at the piano and try to work something out.

Later on, when I was writing songs with a guy in the Army Band, I took it more seriously. I wrote with a hip guy from Los Angeles. Then a guy gave me a Rodgers & Hart songbook and that stimulated my mind. That was a good study of song form. In the Army Band, there were guys from New York, Chicago and Los Angeles that were hipper than the Southerners. There was a quota thing where they had some folks from different regions. There was Black’s Chord Book, before the days of fake books, Blacks was a little book of songs, with chords and slashes for beats. The first song I remember playing was “Out of Nowhere.” Meanwhile a tenor man comes in and asks me what I’m playing and he started playing it with me. I thought it was such a neat chord progression.

RV: Today, a musician buys a fake book app and it’s right on your laptop, iPhone or iPad. (iReal Pro). It’s only the chords, but you can put your song in any key.

Didn’t you play in the Army Band and at what point did you attend college at North Texas?

BD: One of my buddies in the Army Band taught me how to drink. He was a one-eyed trombone player. He had a glass eye so he was unfit to go to war, but he could get into the band. I had a punctured ear drum so I was unfit, too, but I got into the band. One day he asked me what I was going to do when I got out of the Army. When I told him I would probably go back to college, he said, “Why don’t you go to a better one?” He told me about North Texas, in the Dallas-Fort Worth Area. So that’s how I ended up going there.

RV: UNT has a great reputation. Was this the time period you really got into Charlie Parker and bebop?  Your lyrics on  “Yardbird Suite” are known around the world. (“Yardbird Suite,” 1956 Devil May Care)

BD: After the war, I had a short stay at my folks’ home with my first wife in Amarillo from December 1945 until June 46 when I moved to Denton to matriculate at UNT. I was in Amarillo when I first heard about Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie. There was a tenor man whose mother owned a nightclub where we jammed. I was jamming with these two cats from the Air Force Band, who played trumpet and tenor from Chicago and New York. They said, “You play wild piano! Have you heard Bird and Diz?” I had heard about ’em but I hadn’t heard them. So they said, “Come over tomorrow and we’ll listen to records.” They played “Hot House,” and I thought-boy, is that weird! Then they told me it was the changes to “What Is This Thing Called Love.” I said, “Really? Yeah!” I went to North Texas thinking I was gonna snow everybody with my knowledge of bebop, but the first session I walked into, they were playing “Confirmation!” (laughing)

RV: Did you study voice at UNT ?

BD: When I was at North Texas I was in the Grand Chorus. They gave you the basics, but not a lot of voice teaching to the chorus members. We sang Verdi’s “Requiem,” Bach’s “Mass in B Minor,” and appeared with symphony orchestras in Texas. The Dean of the Music Department was a choral director when I was there from 1946-49. One of my buddies, a student, talked him into introducing jazz into the curriculum so you could major in Dance Band Music (a euphemism) and they started the One O’Clock Lab Band in 1947. However, I was majoring in composition and minored in piano, so I stuck with my major. But I unofficially took part in the One O’Clock Lab Band, sometimes subbing on piano and hearing them play my charts. I do believe that’s where it all started- jazz education.

In those days North Texas was NTSTC, a teacher’s college. I knew I didn’t want to be a teacher, so I avoided the education courses. The composition area wasn’t particularly strong at that time, but I did write and hear my compositions performed.

RV: UNT is still one of the best vocal jazz programs around the country. Jennifer Barnes (daughter of famed Swingle Singers member, Don Shelton) took Paris Rutherford’s chair as director of vocal jazz studies. Sounds like your studies at UNT prepared you for New York.

What was it like when you arrived in New York City?

BD: I was a different person in New York, because there, it was all about bebop. To sing would be corny. About the only time I would sing would be when the agent would ask if anyone in the band could sing. I’d sing “Route 66” or “Straighten Up and Fly Right.” But at jam sessions, I would just play. We were all trying to learn all the bebop literature. I came in 1949 as soon as I got my bachelor’s degree. I had a pal from Texas who came up a year before me. I was married to a girl from Arkansas and we’d sing together like Jackie and Roy. She was a natural talent, and learned anything I gave her to sing. I would write these fabulous head arrangements. We played with clarinet or a baritone sax. Often there was no bass player. We had a drummer who played French horn sometimes. That was our secret life. But we would have sessions there where I lived on East 75th St. for about 10 years and cats would come and play. That’s what the scene was about.

RV: Can you tell me about your method for composing? Do you remember your process for writing “Devil May Care?” The lyrics are the coolest to sing and improvise with and your melodies are always interesting and swinging.

BD: For me, the changes come with the melody most of the time, because I’m thinking about the harmony, too. Fran’s lyrics are so good and easy to write with. When you put music to a lyric that’s as brilliant as hers, it sort of writes itself.

I always thought of “Devil May Care,” as my number one song, and it’s one of my earliest. “Devil May Care” was recorded by The Les Elgart Big Band in 1953.

I lived in this fabulous cold water flat on East 75th Street and on the ground floor was LaNoue Davenport, a brilliant Texas cornet player who fell in love with early music. He was playing recorders, sackbuts, crumhorns (capped-reed instruments from the Renaissance period) and veilles (stringed instruments). He got me to sing in his a capella choir doing 13th-Century motets. On the second floor was another Texan, Terrell P. Kirk. He was sort of an amateur musician, and he made his own banjo and flew airplanes. I was on the fourth floor. T.P. would often knock on my door with his cup of coffee. He was in a composition class and he wanted to write pop songs. We wrote a lot of songs that never got out of the trunk. We’d go to the Brill Building with our commercial song ditties. One day he said he had an idea for a song-“Devil May Care.” I told him that had probably already been written. He went to the library and learned that there were six of them. I imagined they all said, “You don’t love me anymore, you’re so devil may care.” Right. Okay, we’ll write a different one. T.P. had a fragment of the melody-the first line-and I wrote most of the rest, but we shared it. We shopped it. TP stimulated my song writing abilities. When I divorced my first wife in 1952, I went home to Amarillo to cool it a little bit. I wrote the bridge on that visit to my folks’ place.

When I returned to New York, I’d write at 10 pm, the quiet hour. I had a damper on my piano so I could work quietly. I’d practice my singing. I still have the very piano I jammed with in New York. Lots of greats played it: Bill Evans, Tommy Flanagan, and Bob Brookmeyer, to name a few.

Anyway, that’s when I wrote “Love Came on Stealthy Fingers.” I had a little tape recorder so I would practice my singing and accompanying myself.

RV: When did you first meet Blossom Dearie?

BD: Well, I met Blossom in Paris. She came to hear me at The Mars Club and I already knew who she was (that girl who sang “Moody’s Mood” with King Pleasure). She asked me, that night, on the spot, to join her vocal group. That turned out to be the Blue Stars and we recorded 4 songs, one of which was “Lullaby of Birdland” en Francais, with Michel LeGrand at the helm of the big band. I came back home shortly after that and the group did more until they sort of ousted Blossom as the leader and evolved into other groups. Blossom and I went our own ways for years. She became a widow and returned to NYC. She told me she was hanging out with Bill Evans a lot and I’m sure she got some of her elegant piano voicings from him. On one occasion we did a radio show in Durham, North Carolina, with the three of us-Dave Frishberg, Blossom Dearie and me. There was some talk of doing a national tour, but we never could get our three acts together. We did work quite a few jobs in California and Europe with two of us at a time in various combinations: Bloss and me, Dave and Bloss, Dave and me. She spent her last years mostly at Danny’s Skylight and I saw her often and sometimes sat in for a duet. She devoted much energy to her label, Daffodil Records. I had four duets with her on her label. We hated to lose her but bad health took its toll. She was the consummate singer/pianist cabaret artist.

RV: Did you meet your best bass partner, Mr. Bill Takas, in New York City? I remember hearing you and Bill when I first arrived in New York City, in 79′. You guys were quite the team.

BD: Yes, Bill’s playing on “Devil May Care.” He was a wonderful, wasn’t he? Bill was a great guy. He would memorize everything I gave him. I never had to carry music with me when we were working together. Nowadays when I have a gig I always have to sort through the music and bring charts for everybody. With him everything was easy. He was so free.

In the summer of ’57, I paid money and went to a jazz camp in Lenox, Mass. Hod O’Brien was there along with Dizzy and Jimmy Giuffre. I had a few piano lessons with Oscar Peterson, who scared me to death. I studied composition with John Lewis. I’d been thinking about it for a while, so for my “thesis” (the performance project at the end of camp), I wrote three songs to the poetry of Langston Hughes and sang them on the concert with the Jimmy Guiffre Trio.

Jimmy’s bass player was Ralph Peña. When I got to LA, he heard about me being there and he called me up one day and said, “Hey man, I’m doing this jazz and poetry record with Lawrence Lipton, and I told him about your songs. He wants to talk to you.” Lipton was known as the “Poet of the Beats” and I talked with him and sent him a couple of things.  He said, “I keep telling the poets they should sing and their delivery should be musical.” I thought my things were more like art songs in a jazz mode or something, but he said he wanted them on his recording.

I asked him to let me do a jazz and poetry thing-what I think jazz and poetry is. He asked me what I would do and I told him “Dog” by Ferlinghetti. “The dog trots freely through the streets and sees reality. And the things he sees are bigger than himself. Like drunks on lamp posts, chickens in Chinatown windows, their heads…” It becomes very political. I used to read Evergreen Review and I saw that poem and thought, “Wow, that’s got rhythm!” So I just recorded a blues background and did 4 tracks on Jazz Canto Vol. 1. There was never a volume 2. The story of my life-(chuckling) every record company I worked for went out of business.

In 1958, I couldn’t get a job anywhere. The record producer Red Clyde, who’d been with Bethlehem Records, was producing on the West Coast for a new label, Mode Records. He said, “Why don’t you come on out to LA and make a new record?” I said, “Well, what about my contract with Bethlehem?” He said, “Aw, they’re going under.” They had just produced a big package of Porgy and Bess, with Mel Torme as Porgy and Frances Faye as Bess. We all laughed about it and said, “Mel should’ve been Bess and Frances should have been Porgy!”  So Red lured me to Los Angeles to go record with Mode Records, and ended up producing a lot of records. As it turned out, I never did that record for Mode.

I put in my transfer with the musicians union, so I started getting some work. It was a hot time out there. Paul and Carla Bley were married and playing modern music. I was in a session one day and suddenly I heard this saxophone with a sound like I’d never heard before. I turned around and it was Ornette Coleman, with a plastic alto. I asked the drummer who that was and he said, “That’s Ornette!”  He was putting his quartet together. We used to go to sessions with Billy Higgins and all those guys.

So I lived a double life out there, with the cabaret gigs and the bebop gigs. Jack Sheldon and Joe Maini were especially tight with Lenny Bruce.  I knew Lenny from a day when I was visiting the offices of Mode Records with a friend of mine from Philly, who’d moved to LA. Her name was Terry Morel, and we became buddies in my LA days. Lenny buzzed into the office that day and he was talking real fast and then abruptly left. I said, “Who was that?” She said, “That’s Lenny Bruce! He has a gig at a strip club in Hollywood.”  We’d all go there and hang out and jam with Joe Maini, Jack Sheldon, and those guys. It was special because I got to know Lenny. I opened for him several times on the West Coast.

One day Lenny said, “I got a job for you, Bob-the way you sing and play the piano!” He sent me down to the Twelfth Knight Club and I got myself a cabaret gig and worked there on the grand piano five nights a week for about six months. The owner was a drummer. He’d get drunk and play the last song every night, but it was worth it. It was a great gig! I was making about $70 a week and loving it. Meanwhile, I was practicing and doing a few gigs with a quintet that I joined, who were into Horace Silver’s music. I wrote some charts for them. I was having a lot of fun with the quintet and I did a lot of singles around LA. I went there to make a record and only made part of a record.

RV: When did you meet Miles Davis? Your association with Miles transformed your career.

BD: The same friend, Terry Morel, used to keep my album, Devil May Care, on her shelf in front of the others in her attic apartment above Roberta Bright’s place. Terry was a cabaret singer who had made a Bethlehem LP, and she knew everybody. Miles Davis knew her, and one day he was visiting her when he was in town on a three-week engagement. I wasn’t going to go hear him, because it cost so much money, and I’d heard him a lot in NYC. He saw my LP on Terry’s shelf, and said, “What’s that?” Terry said, “That’s my pal Bob Dorough. He plays piano and sings and writes some nice tunes. He said, “Play me a little.” She played it for him and told me the next day that he heard the whole album! I took her to his gig that night, and as we walked in, Miles was wandering around the club, having played his solo. Other cats in the band were blowing (John Coltrane, Cannonball Adderley, Jimmy Cobb, and Paul Chambers). Terry introduced me to Miles and you’d think he’d say something like, “I liked your LP, Bob” or, “Nice to meet you.” Instead, he whispered in my ear, “Bob, go up and sing ‘Baltimore Oriole.'” Dragging me up to the bandstand, he stopped the guys and told them to take a break because – “Bob’s gonna sing one.” I knew everybody in his band except him. So everybody but bass and drums left the stand and I did my version of “Baltimore Oriole.” That was the end of the set. We kind of became pals in LA while Miles was there for the three weeks. I gave him rides, and he gave me his number, and eventually we all ended up back in New York.

RV: Tell me about your relationship and writing with Fran Landesman? She was one of my favorite lyricists. “Spring Can Really Hang You Up the Most” (written with Tommy Wolf) is one of her best known works. Where did you meet?

BD: I’d been living in LA for almost three years when I met Tommy Wolf and I knew who he was. He said, “Fran and I are writing a musical out of this novel by Nelson Algren, A Walk on the Wild Side. You could play Dove Linkhorn.” He twisted my arm and I went to St. Louis to be in the play. I told him I wasn’t an actor, and was used to singing on a mic. But he wanted me to do it. So I studied voice with Giovanna D’Onofrio, who taught me about the diaphragm and gave me some exercises. She did give me some insight into vocal production. I only lived in St. Louis for three months because our play closed just after three weeks. I didn’t have much money, so I got a solo gig for a short while. Then I left to go back to NY. I had all my stuff in the car. That’s when I first worked with Fran, in 1959. As I was leaving St. Louis, Fran said, “Here, let me give you a few of these,” and she reaches into a bureau drawer and grabs four or five sheets of lyrics and pressed them into my hand. I said, “Won’t Tommy be jealous?” She said, “He can’t keep up with me. I write all the time.”  I put “Nothing Like You…” on top and I took it home with me. Later on, I put the music to it in New York. That was the first song of many I wrote with Fran.

RV: When did you first become associated with the famous Deer Head Inn, located in the Delaware Water Gap? You’ve been performing there for many years with your buddies Phil Woods and drummer, Bill Goodwin. It’s still a great scene. Keith Jarrett and countless great jazz musicians have performed at the Deer Head Inn and there are still jazz shows every week.

BD: When I got back to New York, the first thing I did was call my blowing buddy, Bob Newman, the tenor man. When I told him I was back from three years out in LA, he asked me if I was working. I said, “No man, I just got back in town.” Right then he had a gig for me at none other than the Mt. Airy Lodge. He was their first bandleader, and I was the first piano player. Later on, Dave Frishberg was in his band, and wrote a tribute to Bob. Then they started booking big bands and they’d call New York City, and get a bunch of cats to come out for one or two shows. That’s how a lot of people got turned on to the Deer Head Inn. We’d play the show and he’d say, “As soon as we play a cha-cha and a ballad for the dancers, we’re gonna cut out.” We’d pile into his VW bus and go over to Delaware Water Gap to hear John Coates, Jr.’s last set at the Deer Head Inn. Bob would sometimes sit in with Johnny, but I didn’t sit in, because John was too fantastic.

RV: Wasn’t it around this time period that you recorded your famous  “Blue Xmas” with Miles Davis?

BD: I finally quit the Mt. Airy Lodge and went back to New York City. I had returned for a summer gig in 1962 with my second wife and infant daughter. So I’m up there in the country and the phone rings. “Bob, it’s Miles, and I want you to write me a Christmas song.” It was for a composite for Columbia records. His lawyer came on the line and explained it to me. Columbia wanted Miles on this Christmas record, and he didn’t want to play “Jingle Bells,” so he called me. He said, “And I want you to sing it with me, Bob!” So I got the idea of calling it “Blue Xmas” instead of “Christmas.” Columbia records had everybody; Carmen McRae and Paul Horn. Paul Horn was a very good friend of Miles’ and we’d met in LA that night he made me sing “Baltimore Oriole.” We had picnics and swim parties at Paul’s house. Miles would drag me into the house and have me play and sing for him. That’s when I played him “Spring Can Really Hang You Up the Most.” He loved the way I did that and told me he thought I was the only one who should ever sing it. He would just say, “Sing me a song.” And then he wouldn’t say a word. That was just the way he was. He would just listen. You’d never know if you’re getting to him or not. He would listen, but he wasn’t the kind of a guy who would sit around long. Back East, I also played him my song, “Nothing Like You…” with Fran’s lyrics. I called Miles and told him I’d written the song, and he said, “Come over and play it for me.” When I got to his house on 77th St., there was Gil Evans. I already knew Gil, too, from days we played piano opposite each other in the Village. I played “Blue Xmas” over and over while Gil took notes. Then Miles said, “Do that other one! “Nothing Like You.”

Next day the session was at 12 noon at Columbia Records. So I’m there early, naturally, like I am always early. I see the cats coming in: Paul Chambers, Jimmy Cobb, and no piano player. I’m thinking, “Gee, maybe I’m gonna play.” He was supposed to have JJ Johnson but instead he had Frank Rehak on valve trombone. Instead of John Coltrane, in comes Wayne Shorter on his first date with Miles. He said, “What are you doing here?” I said, “Well, I guess I’m gonna sing with Miles. And you?” He said, “This is my first date with Miles.”  Looking back, I could’ve said, “This will be my first date, too. And my last one!”

So we recorded two tunes. We spent most of the time on “Blue Xmas,” then we did “Nothing Like You…” I’ve told this story in more detail in a little book I wrote called, “Blue Xmas.” It’s available and includes a CD track of my third recording of “Blue Xmas” with the Dave Liebman Group.

RV: What an incredible journey you’ve taken in your life. Your talent and spirit are inspirational to all who know you. Would you tell me a little bit about writing “Nothing Like You …,”? It cycles through so many keys.

BD: It moves through a lot of harmonies. But it’s famous because Miles put it on The Sorcerer. When I wrote it, I was thinking, “This is gonna be a fabulous long melody, and I want to write a melody that soars.” Once I got the beginning, that ascending scale, I had to pretty much find a way to get up and out there and find my way back. You gotta get back at the end.

RV: I watched you perform recently with Phil Woods’ big band at the Deer Head Inn. I was struck by your ability to reach out and grab the audience, pulling them into your lyrics. You phrase like a horn, but you deliver the story like an actor. Does this come naturally to you?

BD: Well, when I’m singing to a bunch of drunks that don’t want to hear it, I’m thinking, “How am I gonna get their attention?”  They’re all drunk, and don’t want to hear it. “Play something we know!” I played a lot of Hoagy Carmichael in New York trying to entertain in bars. “Old Buttermilk Sky” and “Up a Lazy River” are some good tunes they could get into. (Laughing) I recommend everybody go through a course of singing for a bunch of drunks.

RV: Ah, “Singing for Drunks 101!” Yes, people go through school and learn music theory and analysis, but there’s no course in singing for drunks or connecting with an audience that’s eating and drinking. Most musicians have a list of war stories. I recall singing with Fred (Hersch) at Christy’s Skylight Gardens in the West Village and a woman threw up right in front of me. Man! You just keep on singin’.

Who were the singers that influenced and inspired you?

BD: The blowers that sang: Jack Teagarden, Trummy Young, Louis Armstrong. Joe Mooney-singing musicians. Nat King Cole Trio gave me a lot of inspiration. It was great to hear a guy sing and play piano with arrangements like that and make it. I wanted to name my first LP A Jazz Man Sings because I wasn’t a very good singer back then, but we ended up calling it Devil May Care. That was in 1956. I put out a vocal album, and the producer said, “No, no. Let’s name it after one of the songs on the album. That had 3 of my songs: “Devil May Care,” “You’re the Dangerous Type of a Girl for Me,” and Charlie Parker’s, “Yardbird Suite,” with my lyrics.

RV: I know students of jazz will want to read your history and see the upcoming documentary about your life (Devil May Care).  I hope you talk about composing in the film.
What do you recommend for students who want to pursue songwriting today?

BD: It’s much harder now, I think. There are so many songwriters, songs, genres, styles and so many great writers. It’s harder to get an idea that hasn’t already been written. I think a songwriter who wants to write words and music must master the elements of music. We know Dave Frishberg studied English literature. So you must master words-the language-too. That may not mean Shakespeare; it could mean street language-whatever. But you’ve got to have it all at your disposal.

Then you have to find an idea that tempts you and inspires you and keeps your attention. You have to do the work. There’s always the Rodgers and Hart syndrome, i.e. the theatrical guys, where it’s usually two people writing words and music.

Then you have the case of a jazz musician who wants to collaborate. Like Ben Tucker came to me and said, “I got a hit tune. You gotta put a lyric to it.” And I wrote a song out of his blues riff, “Comin’ Home Baby.” It’s my most sellable song. There are over 500 recordings of it, not all of them vocal. But Ben and I share the money whether it’s vocal or instrumental. I worked really hard with that lyric, because nowhere in the riff can you say, Comin’ Home Baby. It was already an instrumental hit. I thought of Ray Charles and the Raelettes. So I wrote a counter melody and wrote lyrics for both, the counter melody and the main theme that was already known. That was a unique job.

Then I write for people who have lyrics, like when Dave [Frishberg] gave me “I’m Hip.” He said, “I can’t do anything with this. I don’t know if it’s just a joke, or what.” I took it home and came back three days later with my melody and he liked it. When he and I did our live recording for Blue Note (Who’s On First? ), we recorded another collaboration -“At the Saturday Dance.” We also wrote a song for Carol Fredette when she recorded Everything I Need-Songs of Dorough and Frishberg. That was “I Could Care Less.” Dave wrote the lyrics without my help, or me looking over his shoulder. Dave sent the lyrics to me and I wrote the melody. (That’s the way Fran and I worked.)

We tried to write together many times, but ended up with only three that worked. I ended up telling him, “You don’t need me, Dave.” He’s got them both covered. He knows the music. He knows the literature.

RV: I love your tune, “But for Now, (Let me say I love you). I first heard Marlena Shaw sexily purr it on her Blue Note recording in 1973, From the Depths of My Soul. What was your inspiration for writing that song?

BD: She had IT! Well, in 1962, I met Corine, the mother of my only daughter. I decided I was going to write a love song. I ended up writing two love songs (one is fast, and one is slow), “I’ve Got Just About Everything I Need,” and “But for Now,” both thinking of her. I wrote both lyric and melody. On “But for Now,” I just fooled around and found a melody I liked. Then I wrote the little refrain on the piano. When I had the line, “But for now I’ll just say I love you,” I had to go back to the verse that introduces that and find some words to go along with the little ostinato theme.

On “I’ve Got Just About Everything I Need,” I wanted to write a really hip, fast song that goes and goes and goes. I first got the lyric, then found a melody. Then it got thicker and thicker and more problematic, and I finally got one chorus, and I thought, “Oh, shit! I gotta have a second chorus. More work.” In a way, I’d say those are my two best songs. I don’t really think I’m a great songwriter, yet. I’ve had a lotta luck!

RV: I think you’re pretty good, Bob. I recall our old friend Ray Passman knew all of your songs.

BD: Well, thank you very much. I’d say my output is small.

RV: I have to mention your extended work with School House Rock. From 1973 to 1985 ABC television kept you quite busy. How did that experience shape your songwriting?

BD: That was one of the lucky breaks of my life. That came out of an ad agency. Ben Tucker and I were trying to earn some money doing jingles and he found this advertising agency whose president wanted to make an album of multiplication songs for his and others’ children. Ben had played them an album I’d made of found lyrics. I’d made these songs out of ordinary words, and named it This Is a Recording. Ben used it at the agency to prove that I could make songs out of anything. So I had an interview with David B. McCall and he told me of his desire. He said, “Let’s call it Multiplication Rock, okay? But don’t write it down.” He had approached the other jingle composers to do his bidding, but they all assumed somehow that children couldn’t handle anything heavy, and so they delivered dribble-drabble; little simple rhymes, rhythms, and lyrics. I always had a knack for numbers, and I loved being commissioned. I took about two weeks to write, “Three Is a Magic Number,” and that got me the gig. It took me about two years to write the whole album of multiplication songs. They gave me the money to record them: “Zero, My Hero; Two Elementary My Dear; Four-legged Zoo; Five, Ready or Not, Here I Come; I Got Six; Lucky Seven Sampson; Figure Eight; Naughty Number Nine; Good Eleven; and Hey Little Twelve Toes” -not necessarily in that order!

RV: Are there any books that you would recommend for today’s students?

BD: Books don’t mean as much anymore, because you’ve got the internet, right? If you want to learn orchestration, you can Google it.

RV: Yes, my home is full of books and music, but I can go online and find resources for any kind of scale I want to work on. Who are the singers performing today that speak to you and why?

BD: Roseanna Vitro, J.D. Walter, Carol Fredette, Mary Foster Conklin… Jamie Cullum is hip. He recorded “Devil May Care” and “But for Now.”

RV: Tell us about your new album, Eulalia.

BD: Joe Peine produced Eulalia. He asked me to write a new bebop tune for the project. I stole the title from Diz and wrote, “To Be or Not to Bop,” which is the title of his book, I believe.

RV: I highly recommend your new album. I listened to it in the car all the way back home from our interview. Thank you so much for all the time you put into this interview. Your story is a lesson; we never stop creating til’ the last chords are played. You’ve lived such an inspiring life. If we could bottle your energy and resolve, more artists would be happy and creative on stage. What you bring to the jazz table is what it takes to be a real Bebop Crusader.

152,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/voices/catherine-russell-queen-of-the-armstrong-blues/,"Catherine Russell Sitting in the audience of a Catherine Russell concert, one can’t imagine that this charismatic pro was once a shy child who only hoped to reach the heights of her distinguished parents (bassist Carline Ray and pianist Luis Russell). That’s how far she has come. Over the past few years, Russell has been at the top of her game, winning a Grammy for her participation in the 2012 soundtrack to the HBO series Boardwalk Empire, and a Grammy nomination for her own Harlem on My Mind in 2016. She appears regularly at Jazz at Lincoln Center in NYC and curates shows worldwide that explore the history of jazz. During the last year she’s been performing at festivals and theaters with John Pizzarelli, celebrating the music of Frank Sinatra and Billie Holiday. Harlem royalty and elegance radiate from her honeyed voice. Russell is a seasoned musician who has earned her place, a natural-born singer with perfect pitch, timing, and a gift for storytelling. Singers young and old can learn much from her. ***** Roseanna Vitro: You were born into a cradle filled with swing music, raised by two famed jazz musicians. At what age did you pick up your first instrument or start singing? Catherine Russell: I played the violin from fourth to sixth grade. But I was a dancer in Katherine Dunham’s dance company at the same time. We danced for four seasons of the opera Aida at the old (40th and Broadway) and new (Lincoln Center) Metropolitan Opera House. Where did you go to school? I went to a private nursery school called Virgie’s Tot Town in Harlem. I attended public elementary and junior high schools in New York City. I went to Music & Art High School. Then I left New York, went out to northern California to finish high school, and attended Santa Rosa Junior College and Sonoma State College. Did your parents set up private music lessons for you?  When I was a child I had a piano teacher named Mrs. King, whom I didn’t connect with, so those lessons were short-lived. My music education was primarily in school. I was too afraid to study with my mother, so the lessons basically ended up in tears—mine. Haha! All I could see in my mind were her degrees from Juilliard and Manhattan School of Music. But as time has passed, she is still my best music teacher. On stage or off, you always appear calm and focused. As a younger artist, were you naturally disciplined? If not, how did you develop these skills? Wow! Thank you, I’m glad I appear calm to you! Preparation is the key for me. I spend much of my time preparing in advance. I pick out the songs and decide the order of material for a show or an album, so I can provide a (hopefully) joyous and inclusive experience. I don’t start with a theme first. I start with songs I like to sing, then a theme may come out of the song list. It’s all about the songs I like. I was never able to cram for tests growing up, so I always need time to study. And as a bandleader, I must organize my charts for the musicians so the gig goes as smoothly as possible. But again, I do all of this in advance. As a young artist I had no idea what I was doing. Fortunately, I became a bandleader in later years. I learned from the tours that I’ve done with major artists. I learned from tour managers about organizing hotel rooms, meals, and all the nuts-and-bolts that make for a smooth gig. One thing goes wrong and the vibe goes dark, so I know by now that musicians want to know when they can go to their hotel rooms, eat, play the gig, and go back to their hotel rooms. In your formative years, what were the most important lessons you learned from your parents or teachers? Honestly, my formative years were a mess! I was depressed, with no direction and no way of knowing what I would do as an artist. I only knew that music was leading me. I was in choirs and bands through school; I was in a vocal jazz trio in junior college that worked independently of the school band because they didn’t want singers. I was in a gospel choir under the direction of the great Daryl Coley at the College of Alameda in California. I was in a country swing band called Smokin, where I sang and played mandolin. We played lots of gigs in clubs and in places where there was dancing. I just found different situations where I could learn and get better at my craft. I was shy and always nervous, never thinking I was good enough. I was always surprised that people would actually hire me. I had perfect pitch and desire, but not much else. Vibrations and personality affect an artist’s success as much as talent. Your persona is always warm and gracious. How did you handle putting yourself out there to land some of the high-profile groups you’ve performed with? Did you want to be the frontperson?  I never saw myself as the frontperson. Probably because my mother, as accomplished as she was, never saw herself as the frontperson, so that was my role model. But when I was a young adult, she took me to see Alberta Hunter. She also played bass with Ruth Brown for six years, so I went to many of those shows. I saw Etta James, Betty Carter, Anne Peebles, Koko Taylor, and Carmen McRae. I observed those great ladies, and modeled my shows after what they were doing. A mix of classic jazz, rhythm & blues, and fun with the audience. Those ladies made a great impression on me. Those ladies were always warm and gracious, as you say. Well, Etta James—not always. I feel like I’m giving a party, and the audience members are my guests, so I need to make them feel welcome in my home. You’ve garnered great success as a backup singer and instrumentalist sideman, performing with David Bowie, Steely Dan, Cyndi Lauper, Jackson Browne, Michael Feinstein, Levon Helm, Paul Simon, Rosanne Cash, Wynton Marsalis, and Dr. John. What are techniques and lessons you’ve learned for success as a vocal or instrumental sideman? First of all, I am honored and privileged to have worked with these iconic artists. The main lesson is, “It’s not about me!” I am in service to the artist who hired me. I am there to musically and spiritually support the artist so they feel comfortable and free to express themselves. Preparation is the key, so when I get a gig as a sideperson, I delve into that artist’s catalogue to get a flavor of their music overall. Then we usually get specific songs to learn before the first rehearsal. I listen to the songs multiple times. I dissect the parts so when I get to rehearsal I have a good idea of what I’m singing or playing. Writing helps me, so I physically write out lyrics or chord changes. In these days and times writing pen-to-paper is not so popular, but I believe this practice helps with learning songs. Everyone has a different way of learning; some learn aurally, some visually. My advice is to know how you learn, and come to the first rehearsal prepared so you are relaxed and open to the vibe of the person you’re working for. As a lead singer, your storytelling talent is as important as handling the audience and leading the band. Did you study theater and acting in school or did you come by this gift naturally? I studied theater at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. I wanted to get to know myself better and just … relax … on stage. This was not easy for me to do, especially when I started to work as a solo artist. The process took time. But I once listened to an interview with the great actress Angela Lansbury, and she talked about “letting the lyrics take you.” That is what I live by. I pick songs where I can express myself through the lyric. To me, the lyric comes first. Then the story is always fresh. Along with the lyric is a great melody. Then great chord changes that are fun for the musicians to play. All of these elements contribute to the band sounding cohesive so the audience receives one unified message. Scat singing in jazz music enjoys a long history, from Leo Watson through Louis Armstrong and Jon Hendricks on to Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan, and Betty Carter. You’re an excellent musician, sight-reading parts and playing instruments, so you have the knowledge to improvise. What is your thinking about scatting?  My role model for scat singing is Louis Armstrong. My understanding of scat singing is based in rhythm, so Satchmo’s ideas appeal to me. If I feel like emphasizing or extending an idea, I’ll do a chorus of simple scat after I’ve sung a chorus with words. I love Ella’s scatting, but it’s much more complex note-wise, and I have to listen to many more famous horn solos to grasp her vast knowledge of the vocabulary. She and Louis Armstrong are the gold standard because they always scat perfectly in tune. I of course love Lambert, Hendricks & Ross since they scatted with words, and I listened to their recordings back in the ’70s. Jon Hendricks was such a wonderful lyricist. My feeling is that one really has to pay attention to execute vocal scat ideas and sing in tune. I loved Sarah Vaughan’s vocal improv—very simple and easy to understand—so when I practice I also listen to Sarah. I would say, please don’t get ahead of yourself when you scat. Keep it simple. And it’s also not necessary to scat on every tune when you do a show. Fortunately for today’s vocal improvisers, there are more than a handful of high schools and college programs teaching improvisation to singers. As a result, school choral programs now feature young singers scatting and learning complex harmonies. Scat singing is almost compulsory. I feel the good news is this focus has spawned singers around the world who are capable of understanding improvisation. But group singing and scatting don’t promote lyric interpretation or phrasing. What class would you add to bring back a focus on the value of simply singing a song, interpreting the lyrics and the melody correctly with feeling? Would you promote a jazz history listening class or one or two sessions added to a choral class for this study? When I taught at Berklee College of Music, I taught all types of classes, including group singing. I feel that the emphasis these days is not so much on harmony group singing as it is on becoming a star. I hear very talented young people, but they have to find themselves in the music and what they want to express. So, yes, I would have classes on listening to the masters. Young people don’t get exposed to a broad scope of historical recordings, in my experience (jazz didn’t start in the 1950s). And singers are a marginalized group, so I feel that as much exposure as possible to historical recordings is crucial. It’s not just the notes, it’s the heart and soul that went into those performances. Sometimes I feel that song and dance have lost some of the heart and soul, and what the artists went through to achieve their results. It’s up to the next generation to find themselves in their music. That may be a personal journey that can’t be taught in school. While you were developing as an artist, what inspired you to sing works from the 1920s?  Since both my parents were professional musicians and high achievers, it took time for me to figure out my direction as an artist. I only knew what I liked to sing to: a good groove, good lyrics and a good melody, and the tune should be fun for the band to play. Female blues vocalists of the 1920s inspire me as much as the songwriters of that era. The lyrics are fun, the singing style allows for free expression and creates a kind of party atmosphere. I’ve listened to many of those singers starting with Bessie Smith, and I love that style of singing. I love good storytelling. You’ve carved a fresh niche with your talent and musical choices. Did you have guidance from others—from a producer, for instance?  I had no guidance for developing my “style” except trial and error, and good role models. Alberta Hunter was my main role model for singing vintage blues because she was one of the pioneers of that style. I’m soglad I got to experience Ms. Hunter in performance! I also listened to Koko Taylor for her Chicago blues style. I listen to soul singers like James Brown, Wilson Pickett, Sam Cooke, and Little Willie John. I listen to classic gospel singers like Shirley Caesar. If I like the sound of the singer, I listen to them and then I determine if I can find myself in their style. This takes a lot of listening and practice. Some things work and some don’t, and that’s fine. Leading and directing a band covers running rehearsals, handling the pay, taking care of tax forms, hiring accountants, finding an agent or manager, and designing sellable projects. It’s daunting. I don’t know how many singers have told me that at the end of the day, there isn’t enough time to practice. Could you provide a short list of suggestions for younger singers who desire to be the bandleader?  Yes, bandleading is a lot of work. But the reward is working with musicians who you love, and who support your vision. Finding the right combination of supportive musicians may take some time. But when you find that magic combination, there is nothing better. This is separate from practicing. There’s always time to practice. I practice in my kitchen, when I’m washing dishes after a good meal. In the shower. In my bedroom. I hear a riff that I want to learn, and I drill it over and over to see if I might be able to add it to my vocal vocabulary. There is always time to practice. How do you communicate and get the best from your band? In my 20 years of teaching, I’ve seen many vocalists who are afraid to assert themselves in a rehearsal or show. Do you have guidelines that have helped you through the years as a female bandleader?  If I encounter resistance to my bandleading, I do not call that person again. There are plenty of good musicians who want to work, so you don’t have to put up with that kind of thing. I have a young student who tells me that musicians are resistant to her giving them direction, and I say, “Well, you may have to stop calling that person if they are not supporting you the way you want them to.” That’s all. They just won’t get the call next time. Be organized in your rehearsals and recording sessions; know what you want. Try to be as clear as possible in communicating your ideas to your band members. Don’t waste time in rehearsals and recording sessions. Communicate firmly, but calmly.

She moved from Binghamton, New York to New York City in 1991, honing her craft and making fans everywhere she’s performed. At the age of 21, she was diagnosed with arthritis and carpal tunnel syndrome, which forced her to stop playing piano for almost two years.  The good news for jazz fans is the illness pushed Dena to develop her lovely singing voice.  In 2002, ’03 & ’06, Dena gained national recognition in the annual Downbeat’s Critics Poll for “Artist Deserving Wider Recognition.” She’s been performing, recording, teaching and earning accolades ever since that time.  We don’t see or hear Dena often enough since her move to Graz, Austria, seven years ago.  She is the vocal chair at The University of Music and Performing Arts in Graz.  I was lucky to catch Dena on tour promoting her new solo album, Live in Belgium on the MaxJazz record label (www.maxjazz.com/).

On September 14 and 15, New Yorkers have an opportunity to catch Dena in action at The Kitano Hotel Jazz Room. Her group consists of a beautiful rhythm section, Mr. Steve Williams on drums and bass master Ben Wolfe.  This coming weekend, September 8th & 9th,  Seattle’s vocal jazz fans have an opportunity to hear  Dena and I together in concert, plus a workshop on Saturday afternoon, as part of  Nich Anderson’s Vocal Jazz Series.

 This interview was part of  JVOICE, a jazz educators series I started on Facebook in 2009  to highlight programs and the educators who are inspiring and changing today’s landscape for young jazz vocalists.

Roseanna Vitro:  What is the most important quality for a singer to present in concert or on a recording?

Dena DeRose:  I think the most important quality for a singer to present in concert or on a recording is a feeling of sincerity. But, I also feel that a good sense of musicality, a confident, yet, non-ego or diva aura/vibe, and a love for what he or she is doing up there on that stage. When these are achieved, there is more communication between the musicians and audience to help create a positive musical experience for all.

RV:  Did you always want to be a musician?

DD:  I always knew that I was meant to be a musician. There were times when I thought I should be a basketball player, but knew that I was better at music, so I made the decision in high school to make music my main priority.

RV:  Were you a natural musician, playing off the top of your head or were you a studious musician?

DD:  I believe I am both a natural musician and a life-long student of music. I started out playing the piano ‘by ear’ before having formal lessons at the age of 3. And, with singing, I had been doing some in pop bands in my teens, but hadn’t had any vocal training until my early 20’s

RV:  I know you were a pianist first and foremost, but because of carpal tunnel syndrome and arthritis you began singing after sitting in with a group.  How do you feel your experience as a pianist shaped your singing?

DD:  Having played piano for many years before making singing a part of what I do, I feel it gave me the musical foundation needed in this day and age of being a jazz singer and provided me with the confidence, discipline, and vision of what it takes to be a vocal musician

RV:  Many great natural singers have a difficult time with ear training and theory. As a renowned vocal jazz teacher, what disciplines have you found particularly successful in training student’s ears?

DD:  Training the ear is something that I’m continually learning to develop in my teaching. The key is ‘correct repetition’ and routine practicing. Some things that have been successful for me have been:
a) Interval training by using various ‘flashcard’ games I made up, listening to a lot of music
b)  singing of scales over certain chords or chord progressions, chord recognition, chord progression recognition, and various other harmony and rhythm dictation
c) sight-reading ‘Modus Novus’ (an A-Tonal approach)
d) listening exercises which enable a singer to recognize chord qualities and chord progressions, the singing of ‘changes’ through tunes (naming chords when singing the roots, naming note names of roots and 3rds, or roots and 7ths, guide tone lines, and arpeggios, etc.)
e) Some students have found that the online ear training websites are helpful, too, and one that I’m familiar with is Music Theory Pro….but I am not too familiar with too many of them.

RV:  Do you believe singers should be required to study piano and theory before entering college or conservatory music programs?

DD:  I do believe having some basic knowledge of and ability to play a little piano before entering into a university vocal program is needed if you want to get as much as you can out of what is offered. Some people are excepted into jazz programs with not much knowledge of basic theory or piano skills and end up spending their first 2 years or more catching up or trying to keep up.

RV:   Do you advocate the use of solfege to learn solos?

DD:  I don’t require students to use ‘solfege’ unless they know it well. In the past, I’ve had some Italian students that found it very helpful as they grew up singing with solfege from an early age.

RV:   What method do you use to teach young singers how to swing and develop a solid sense of time?

DD:  Learning to have a solid sense of time can come from listening to a lot, and I mean a lot, of really great music, and it also grows deeper over time with listening and playing/singing. By working with a metronome, playing with musicians that have great time, and from listening to your ‘inner metronome’, one finds their own sense of time along with having ‘good time’.

I have found that having singers listen to a certain recording like “I Hadn’t Anyone But You” by Sarah Vaughan and singing along with it note for note, nuance by nuance, and not only learning how Sarah sings it, but also learning the horn lines and ensemble figures behind her singing is a great way to work on ‘swinging’ in an ‘audible’ way. For vocalists, Basie and Ellington are also what I ask singers to listen to to work on gaining a ‘swingin’ feeling and the jazz vocabulary in general.

Another thing I’ve found helpful to singers who need to learn to swing is learning to play the drums… If only learning to ‘ride’ the cymbal and keep the hi-hat on 2 & 4. It reeeeeally gives them a sense of the time and swing feel. Once the coordination for drums allows you to also song melodies of tunes, then your learning a lot!! Actually, learning any other instrument helps, too. Some of my students in Graz have taken drums, bass, saxophone, flute, viola, and other various instruments and have learned a great deal about ‘time’ (and pitch, dynamics, rhythmic ideas, phrasing, etc, etc) to apply to their voice.

RV:   Do you think that you’ll ever write a book on jazz singing?

DD: Yes, I’ve been in the process of writing a book, but it keeps changing as the years go by….but, soon, I will finish it for the last time and publish it (hopefully by next year!).

RV: Thank you Dena for taking time out to catch us up on your projects, history and teaching.  Warm regards for your continued success and happiness.

154,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/voices/jon-hendricks-poet-laureate-godfather-of-jazz-vocalese/,"Jon Hendricks If there was ever a more swinging bebop singer than Jon Hendricks, I don’t know who it was. He was clearly born to scat sing, easily maneuvering through difficult twists and turns in Charlie Parker solos, swinging through Count Basie’s book and singing Duke Ellington’s music with integrity and spirit. At 93, he’s still ready to meet life’s struggles as an artist, with a twinkle in his eye. He was raised in a family with fourteen siblings and developed strong survival skills from his father, a preacher at the Warren, OH A.M.E church. With Art Tatum living down the street, Jon’s ears were fed the right notes and feel from his youth forward.

In 1957, Jon teamed up with Dave Lambert and Annie Ross to form the most influential vocal jazz group the world has known. Jon discovered his talent for writing lyrics to jazz solos, as did the great Annie Ross. Hair-raising scat solos flowed with the speed of light from Dave Lambert and Jon. Lambert, Hendricks and Ross unquestionably remain an inspiration to all jazz singers around the world today.

I met Jon Hendricks when I first moved to New York City in 1980. My friend and great jazz singer, Marion Cowings, introduced us and we sang together one night at the Soho Club known as Greene Street. I’d studied Jon’s music and I was beyond thrilled to utter even one –ooh bop sha bam with Jon and Marion. It was a thrill to do this interview with Jon in his New York apartment. No one has better bebop stories than Jon as he sings solos while he’s talking! I also had the opportunity to catch up with his wife, vocalist, Judith Hendricks.

Roseanna Vitro: Jon, how would you describe your concept in jazz singing?

Jon Hendricks: I play the song, and then I put words to it, adding to something that already exists. But to take a type of music, and replay that type of music verbatim and think it’s a contribution-that’s wrong. The song that you play is a composition already. So leave the other guy alone, and do something on your own. I tend to speak in rhymes [laughing].

RV: I appreciate your concept. It’s one of the reasons I’m here. I recall our mutual friend, vocalist, Marion Cowings introducing us years ago. I could hear his improvisation was informed by yours. Marion’s a wonderful singer.

JH: Yes he is, and you are, too!

RV: Jon, you know you have a very special place in jazz history.

JH: I don’t want a place in history. I want a place in the House of Lords. They made me an honorary member of the House of Lords, and an honorary member of the House of Congress, and in France, they made me a member of the Legion D’Honneur, comprised of musketeers-the regiment who protects the King-Athos, Porthos and Aramis, the famous Three Musketeers, belonged to the Legion D’Honneur. That means I can go to the Mayors mansion in Paris and show them my pin, and go right into the Mayor’s office. They’ve given me much more than my own country.

RV: Yes, most jazz musicians and jazz lovers in the U.S. have very strong feelings regarding how jazz music is perceived and pigeonholed by the media in this country.

JH: We are the cultural arbiters of the nation. It’s disgraceful. You have to fight, because America is an ignorant country. My magazines are best sellers around the world. I just finished a magazine on the Miles Ahead album. I put words to that for jazz choirs to sing.

RV: Jazz choirs are very popular right now in high schools and colleges around the globe. Almost all vocal jazz directors know your book of vocaleses from Lambert, Hendricks and Ross recordings and your solo albums, such as Freddie the Freeloader.

JH: I have one in London waiting for me now. They’ve got the words and they’ve got the choir.

RV: I can’t wait to hear it! Freddie the Freeloader and Lambert, Hendricks and Ross, The Hottest New Group in Jazz are required listening.

JH: You have that Miles Ahead album, right? It’s got all those great tunes, plus that great JJ Johnson ballad-“Lament.” And I love to sing Miles. Miles is a singing teacher.

RV: Absolutely. You’re learning hip altered scales, note choices and phrasing when you sing with Miles. The space is as important as the note choices.

JH: I want to have everybody on it, all my friends, Bobby McFerrin, Al Jarreau. [Singing:]  “Every soul I encounter, I regard is just another me. It’s part of my heart constantly. Always, Always. Living like that rule can be a lonely life. If you taste the sweetness of life, while you’re avoiding the trials. The minute that I’m weeping, each tear that trickles down over my face, I see it for the whole human race. Another soul’s in trouble…so am I. That’s why I cry. Through each song I see a large desire, just the way it should be, If nobody ever sees me. I wanna be kissed…”

RV: Oh, that’s amazing. I could listen to you sing solos all day and I’m spellbound with inspiration. I’d like to ask some questions about your boyhood. What were you dreaming of when you were young?

JH: When I was young I was hoping for a time that I could learn to sing opera. I lived in a neighborhood in Toledo and learned to speak some Italian, because there were a lot of Italians there, and some of them were the Mafia. They came into the neighborhood without any problem. They wanted to have a place where they could have a good time, so they set up a club called the “Waiters and Bellman’s Club.” Those jobs-waiter and bellman-were two of the only jobs a Negro man could get in those days that had respect and could earn a living. Five houses from me was the home of Arthur Tatum. I was about 12 years old and I used to come out of junior high school past his house. One day I was walking by and he came out of his house and invited me in. He asked me what I was doing, and I told him I was coming from school. He said, “Oh, you go to Robinson? My brother goes there.” So I would stop and see him after school sometimes. After a time, I asked him what he was up to and he said he was playing all night in a little joint downtown where artists would stop and jam when they were crossing the country. So I was talking to him and I said, “You wanna work in your home town? You want to be close to your family? ” I told him he should get a gig at this after-hours joint over on Indiana Avenue that I was working in.  “You get the house bass and drummer and you have two sets, and you play my two numbers that I sing.” I was 12 or 13 years old at the time. I asked Art if I could mention his name to them. He said, “Sure! Mention my name to them.” I did, and they asked him to come in and play. They hired him immediately! At that time he couldn’t find singers that would stay, because they would come and stay two weeks and end up going and covering Cleveland, Columbus, Louisville, then back to New York. They never stuck around.

RV: When did you actually start singing?

JH: I started singing when I was 6. My father was the pastor at Warren A.M.E. Church, A.M.E is for African, Methodist, Episcopal Church. The Episcopal Church was the one that the English ship captain belonged to who transported and dumped over 180 slaves. When they came ashore, they had to provide the information about where they came from, and John Nelson, the ship’s captain, was found out. He was so sorry for what he did, and he started going to church and wrote the classic hymn, “Amazing Grace.”

RV: Many a good singer began their musical journey in a church choir. Tell me more about your working relationship with Art Tatum.

JH: My mother would save my supper for me, because she knew I was up at Art’s getting my nightly lessons. I’d leave about 9 p.m. and I wouldn’t come back until 2 or 3 a.m. the next morning. Everybody of any consequence who played an instrument, that means all the great bands, Benny Goodman’s entire band, was listening to Art Tatum.

Louis Armstrong heard me, and said, “Boy, you can sing!” I said, “Thank you very much.”

He said, “What are you doing tomorrow about 12 O’clock?” I said, “Nothing.” He said, “Come to the place I’m staying. (You know they couldn’t check into the White hotels, and there weren’t any hotels in the ghetto, so he had to get a room in a boarding house. So he said, “Come by and wake me up and I’ll take you for a walk.” So I got up and I went down to the boarding house where he was staying and he was dressed and ready-you know most people would make you wait, but he was dressed and ready. We walked down Indiana Avenue to the downtown area and across the street and all the way back down into the ghetto. He talked all the way down and all the way back. He said, “You know something? You remind me of me when I was the little cat. I knew all I wanted was to learn to play the trumpet.”

RV: How incredible that you met Art Tatum and Louis Armstrong. Louis, like you, was so entertaining and joyous. I recall reading some musicians didn’t dig his persona because he was entertaining.

JH: They called him an Uncle Tom because they thought that he was trying to make the white men happy. Well, of course he was!

RV: Well, everybody’s trying to make a living, right?

JH: That’s what entertainers do. I’m not going to come out on stage and say, “Ladies and gentlemen, I’m here to entertain only the black people.” No. I wasn’t going to do that. No, you can’t think like that. And that’s what those people were doing. Artists like Louis, Duke and Count Basie, talked them out of that. Everything they did involved white people.

RV: Fortunately, Benny Goodman broke a color barrier when he hired Teddy Wilson. Musicians began building the bridges even amidst the terrible racial climate.

What was the catalyst and inspiration that put your talent on the path of a bebop lyricist to jazz solos?  I’ve taught your lyrics to countless students and audiences on the road. “Everybody’s Boppin'” is fun for rhythm changes and “Centerpiece” for a twelve bar blues form.

JH: I would forget lyrics. I’d think, what is that next line? Then I’d make up my own, and nobody noticed. That’s exactly how it happened. I didn’t know what I was doing when I wrote them. I thought I was doing it for LH&R. It just flowed right out.

RV: So forming Lambert, Hendricks, and Ross was your inspiration. I’ll post a list of your vocalese catalog at the end of our interview. The scat solos you and Dave Lambert traded inspired generations of vocal improvisers. Annie Ross wrote some unforgettable lyrics, too: “Twisted,” “Jackie,” and “Farmers Market.” I look forward to chatting with Annie very soon.

JH: Yes, I needed to give Dave and Annie something to sing. It just flowed right out. I was an English major in school, all the way through college.

RV: So in school, you were reading a lot of good prose. Were you a big dreamer?

JH: Poverty can be valuable, because if you suffer like that, it strengthens you for all of the things you need to get through. That strength you get from hard times can be put into your work, and it helps you get through the work you need to do.

RV: I understand. I too, grew up with very little money, but big dreams. I advise my students to ignore the negative people. You must have a dream, a vision and work hard, focus and stay on your path.

JH: No. Never listen to them! My brother says, “Shurrup!” I also never say you can’t. Don’t tell me what I can’t do, because that’s what I will do. That’s the way I am about “Can’t.” “John, you can’t do this.” Then BOOM! “John, you did that?” Well, don’t tell me what I can’t do!

RV: A strong mindset is very important.

JH: You’ve got to have a positive mindset, especially if you want to be an artist, because you have to be in a position to be helped by ghosts. You know there are spirits who are all around us all of the time. The human family is surrounded by spirits at all times. And they actually are taking care of us. If we were paying attention to what they tell us, we wouldn’t have these tragedies that we go through.

RV: You’ve truly lived a magical life. Your ghosts have done a fine job watching over. What are a few of your favorite memories?

JH: Art Tatum’s mother scrubbed floors in a bank building downtown. One day she came home and said, “Arthur, I saw a piano roll and this fellow said he’d sell it to me cheap because nobody was buying them, so I bought it and brought it home.” I don’t know if you remember piano rolls, but there were player pianos set up to automatically play these pieces that were recorded on the paper rolls, while you pumped the pedals. When she heard this roll being played she said, “That’s pretty. I wonder if Arthur can play it.” She didn’t understand it was two guys playing the music on the piano roll. She took it home and said, “Arthur, I’d like to hear you play this when I come home from work tomorrow.” Art said, “Momma, I’ll be ready for you to hear it tomorrow. I’ll spend today learning it.” He didn’t know it was two guys. She came home the next day and she asked him, “How are you coming along with that?” He said, “I’m ready!” And he played it! I said, “Whoooo, look at that!” Then I whispered in her ear, and told her it was two guys playing. She said, “It is?” I said “Yeah!” She was so surprised. He not only played it, he learned it by ear and played it in a day. To this day, I’ll never forget that.

Do you know who Martha Raye is? I’m reminded of a story. Martha Raye came into this joint where we were jamming. She starts scatting, and she’s trying to cut me. That’s her job. I knew it; she knew it. I was laughing. She was scatting like, “Spack! Shog-in-dit Dit! Shadle-do-bom-bop dee-ter! Shpee-keee do-ah-da-wop! Then she put the huge old microphone completely in her mouth. Man-I got off the bandstand.

RV: What amazing stories. I never knew Martha Raye could scat sing! Sounds like a very funny moment. Art Tatum must have been blessed with a very focused mind. Meditation is a popular discipline for the mind. Do you meditate?

JH: Oh, yes.

RV: I noticed Judith making a healthy green drink for you guys when I walked in today. It’s obvious you guys are into a holistic life style. You look great!

JH: Oh, yeah. I’m 93. I’m not finished. I’m just on the third rail.

RV: I know you still teach in your hometown at the University of Toledo. What’s the first thing you tell a student who wants to learn to sing jazz?

JH: The first thing you need to know is… I wrote a jazz poem:
Nothing about hugging or kissing.
One word- Listen! 
You’ve got to listen. If you can hear it, you can sing it. If you can hear it and sing it, you can play it.

RV: Who were your biggest influences for developing your scatting?

JH: Louis Armstrong, Harry ‘Sweets’ Edison, and Dizzy. I always held my hands like I was playing a saxophone. If you move your hands like an alto or tenor player, that’s how you’re gonna sound. There are other cats who do that, too, like Al Jarreau. You’d be surprised how many notes come out.

RV: Did you ever study singing?

JH: No.

RV: Did you ever study the piano?

JH: No, but I know enough to play a few chords.

RV: So, the majority of your work is by ear. “Listen” is your first step.

JH: Yes, like my poem says:
Nothing about hugging or kissing.
One word- Listen! 

RV: Do you have any other pearls of wisdom you’d care to mention for the benefit of student singers? You’ve seen the jazz business go through many changes.

JH: I would say this: what you want to know, some person possesses. So you get as close to that person as you can. The way to do that, the way I did it, the way everybody I know does it, is: “Hey, I’m gonna hang out with you so that I can learn what you know and how you came to know it. In turn, I’m going to serve you in some way. If you need a person to run errands, or to be of help to you, I’m here for that, in order to learn what I need to know.” And nobody will turn you down, because you are offering to be a personal assistant. People are flattered by that. If you do that, you can get all the knowledge you want. Many band singers that I worked with helped me. I later asked them why they had taken the time to share with me. They told me that it was because they knew I was sincere, that I wanted to better myself, and I wasn’t trying to “out-star” them. So they gave me all the knowledge they could.

RV: That’s such good wisdom to pass along to younger musicians.

JH: It’s also a good way to hold your ego down. Some people have an attitude, “I don’t serve nobody!” I say, that’s okay. You don’t have to serve me. Then I’m gone. I wouldn’t say that’s a good friend to have.

RV: It pays to be humble and listen.

JH: Why, sure.

RV: Were you always disciplined? A lack of discipline has stopped many a good musician from completing their goals.

JH: I was always disciplined, thanks to my father. My father looked after me and looked out for me. He wouldn’t want me to work under the wrong circumstances. Now, in the club where Art played, there were guests all the time. They had one room downstairs for the dancing ladies. Nowadays, dancing ladies are very skinny, no meat on the bones. That’s not good, really. The best of the dancers had some meat on their bones. At the club, they put me in the room with the ladies. I was just 12 years old. They all knew me and my father, mother, all my brothers and sisters. I was one of 15 siblings, 9th child, 7th son, of 12 boys and 3 girls, born September 16, 1921. They were right givers, a lot of marijuana in the men’s room at the club, and I knew that was bad. But there were a lot of ladies in the ladies’ room. They would come in between acts to change costumes and rip off their blouses and their brassieres, and bare breasts would be flopping everywhere. They would say, “Oh, Jonny, come here! Come here, Jonny!” They would take my head and bring it to their bosoms and press. [He motions with hands squeezing face on both sides.] I’d be like, “Hey, bus driver! Open the door!” [laughter] Yes, these ladies would get me in trouble.

RV: Yes, I can see your introduction to women at such an early age was a young boys dream.

Let’s talk about your favorite piano players. In today’s college jazz programs, instrumentalists are taught very hip technique and improvisation theory. But seldom are they taught the value of lyrics and how to play with different styles of singers. What advice would you give to pianists?

JH: It’s called “accompaniment.”

RV: Some pianists bristle at that label, feeling it’s pejorative, and they are insulted if you call them an accompanist.

JH: Then take that cat’s name off the roles, and get yourself another cat that’s got more sense! “What do you mean, it’s what you want? You know, you’re not here to get what you want and just be here for that only. You get what you want, when you give something back.”

RV: Yes, a relationship with respect should be about give and take musically.

JH: That’s the only way to be in show business.

RV: When you’re performing on the road and sing one of your beautiful ballads, instead of a bebop song, what do you tell the pianist?

JH: I would explain to them what the word accompanist means. When you are accompanying a singer, you are playing the chords of the song in such a way that you never get in the way of the melody the singer is singing. You always lay it down, and then, 3 bars later, the next phrase, and then it becomes a marriage. It’s a work in which everybody takes part as an accompanist somehow, and it’s healthy. If it’s done right, it’s artistic as hell.

RV: Who’s one of your favorite pianists to sing with?

JH: Art Tatum. It was like I had the whole Philadelphia Symphony back there when I was singing with him.

RV: What do you look for in a bassist?

JH: In a bassist you look for thumpin’! BOOM! Ding! Ba-doom, dup, dup, [sings killin’ bass line].  You’re looking for that!

RV: How about the drummer? A drummer can make or break the band. Do you say anything to the drummer before you start?

JH: You’ve got a vocalist here. No instrument is weaker than the human voice. So to accompany something as weak as the human voice, you’ve got to stay under it. And you have to have the willingness to do that. Everybody knows you want to be heard, so you should have a solo to show the audience that you are an artist, and be heard. But all of that “being heard” should not be going on over the singer. If you feature the band and let them blow on something so they can shine, it’s good for them and for the audience.

RV: What is your favorite jazz club?

JH: I like the Blue Note. Arturo’s is fun here in NYC. But my favorite is Ronnie Scott’s club in London. The best way to teach singers is to sing. People ask me if I teach and I say, “No,” but I’m lying. Because I’m going to Ronnie Scott’s that night to perform and the students are all there studying what I do. They can learn from what they hear. We performers are teachers. That’s what we do.

RV: Many thanks to Jon and Judith Hendricks for opening up their home and taking the time to chat with me. This interview is a small peep into the life and history of a jazz icon. I believe all jazz students should hear Jon’s lyrics and solo’s on ballads and bebop. “Just Listen. “ Required listening:
1.	The Hottest New Group in Jazz – Lambert, Hendricks and Ross
2.	Sing a Song of Basie – Lambert, Hendricks and Ross
3.	Freddie the Freeloader – Jon Hendricks featuring Bobby McFerrin, Al Jarreau, George Benson

156,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/wilmeth/a-huge-hunk-o-herbie/,"Herbie Hancock SiriusXM satellite radio recently completed its four-day Herbie Hancock Radio special. It was a success. Beginning the morning of Friday, April 27, the network turned over its Real Jazz station to playing nothing but Herbie Hancock recordings. Hancock as group leader, as a sideman, with ensembles and solo-he was heard on famous recordings and on near-forgotten tracks, on electric keyboards and on the concert grand. The special was inspirational for its range of recordings and for the stunningly high level of musicianship heard throughout the weekend.

From the introductory announcement, it was clear that the Real Jazz station programmers would have their work cut out for them. A fluid voice called Hancock a “pure jazz artist” who is “also a bona fide rock star.” Is that possible? And could a traditional jazz radio format really do justice to the many parts of Hancock’s career? Short answer: Yes.

For SiriusXM, giving an existing channel a tightly focused four-day special such as this is different than creating a completely new outlet for one of their Limited Engagements. Because regular listeners to the Real Jazz station have expectations about the format, to make radical programming shifts would be risky. This special was successful in representing numerous works and styles of Herbie Hancock while still maintaining the established personality of the station.

Real Jazz was able to showcase both the diversity of this artist’s career and not alienate regular listeners by leaning a bit more toward Hancock’s traditional jazz selections during the daytime hours and letting the electronics flow a little more heavily during the night. There were exceptions to this, of course, and the station must be given credit for being willing to stretch the boundaries of its regular programming. Even so, Hancock’s Blue Note catalog as a group leader got a solid workout during the day, as did his recordings as sideman.

Announcements concerning the music were kept to a bare minimum, as is usual with the Real Jazz station. This was a smart decision. If listeners wanted to dive more deeply into a specific selection, they could easily see what was playing by looking at their radio and then search the web for information on the track, including the name of the album, the year of recording and featured players. Occasionally, guests such as Chick Corea and Terence Blanchard briefly introduced specific selections.

For those wanting a live announcer as a guide to the music, bassist Marcus Miller offered “Electric Herbie,” a self-explanatory program that aired twice a day, during which Miller would discuss the tracks being played. The station’s long running “Blue Note Hour” fit perfectly with the focused programming by offering music from Hancock’s tenure with that label, as chosen and discussed by host Bruce Lundvall. Two live programs also fit this Special Engagement weekend-Wayne Shorter’s performance at Lincoln Center had natural links to Hancock, as did Ron Carter’s 75th birthday concert, which even featured Hancock as a performer.

And while these self-contained programs offered some commentary and context, Herbie Hancock Radio was nearly four days of uninterrupted music. Credit must be given to station programmers for not taking tempting short cuts on this project. With just under 90 hours to fill, it would have been easy to re-run blocks of programming, taking a four-hour set of music from one part of the day, for example, and re-running it 12 hours later. This never happened. While individual tracks such as “Watermelon Man,” “Chameleon” and “Rockit” were of course repeated, the station did not repeat programming except for “The Blue Note Hour” and the two concerts.

There were only one or two parts of Hancock’s career that were downplayed, if not sidestepped completely. For example, I don’t recall hearing any tracks from the two overtly disco LPs, Feets Don’t Fail Me Now and Monster. At another end of Hancock’s catalog, a piece such as the 20-minute “Hornets” was aired only in the middle of the night, at least in its full version. Both decisions are understandable for the Real Jazz station format, if for very different reasons.

Because this special often showcased Hancock as a sideman on other artists’ albums, it would have been easy to let this weekend be overly tilted to his days with Miles Davis. But balance was maintained here as well. Miles’ second great quintet was only occasionally heard, and it was not until deep into the weekend that the lengthy “Right Off” was heard in its entirety late one night. Sparse use of these Miles tracks kept the focus firmly on Hancock himself, which made sense.

Listening to some of the selections was like reconnecting with an old friend, and I heard some things from this man’s career that I admittedly had missed. The station and its programmers should be pleased. And as much as I applaud the outcome, here are two suggestions I would like the station to consider for future endeavors dedicated to a featured artist:

* Because there are no on-air announcements about most of the selections being played, ongoing track by track information could be offered at the SiriusXM Real Jazz channel page. This could be constantly updated, much like the Twitter feeds that are posted on some of the other station pages. The effort would be labor intensive, to be sure, but would provide useful information for both the uninitiated and the long-time follower.

* As mentioned, the weekend featured two recent concerts focusing on Hancock’s colleagues Ron Carter and Wayne Shorter, and both were great. But I also wanted to hear some unreleased concerts by Hancock himself from varying points of his career. If these tapes are not available for broadcast because of performance rights, some of Hancock’s import-only live discs could be played as concert sets, such as 1977’s double LP Flood (available only in Japan) or the double live LP recorded around the time of Sextant, both on CBS Records.

A concert could easily be recreated by using the two live double LPs issued from the 1978 tour featuring Hancock and Chick Corea, both on concert grand pianos. This era was a much publicized return to the acoustic piano for both performers and was not much represented during the weekend. These are not complaints, of course, but are suggestions from a listener.

The Herbie Hancock Radio special was a worthy tribute. Real Jazz and SiriusXM should be congratulated for successfully presenting the unique career of this deserving musician. It could easily have come across as a promotion for his new releases or a self-congratulatory weekend over his Grammy-winning Joni Letters album and more recent Imagine Project CD. This never happened. The focus was on Hancock’s ability to create a wide variety of jazz music in multiple settings. And even though Herbie Hancock Radio concluded last week, I still have his albums sitting right by my turntable as I continue to rediscover his music.

157,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/wilmeth/a-portrait-of-leigh-kamman/,"Leigh Kamman is alive and well and living in Edina, Minn. Recently retired from the airwaves, Leigh (rhymes with say) had been a fixture on jazz radio for many years before I met him. That was in the summer of 1980, while interviewing for a board operator position at Minnesota Public Radio in St. Paul. Leigh had caught up with the person who was interviewing me to discuss a jazz event taking place that weekend in Minneapolis. Leigh’s program, The Jazz Image, was the late-night show which the statewide network of stations ran each Saturday from 10 P.M. until 4 on Sunday morning. It was a voice well known to me long before this meeting, and I quickly realized that this unerringly polite man was its source.

More striking than the familiar and well-articulated speech patterns of this announcer was his professional attitude, clearly evident in his manner and his clothes. While most everyone I encountered in the halls of the radio station on that hot July day wore shorts, t-shirts and sandals, Leigh Kamman had on a tailored three-piece suit. Since this was a job interview for me, we were the only two in sight formally dressed. Leigh’s professional attire fit his voice perfectly and, as I think back on it, I’m not sure I ever saw him in anything but a suit and tie.

I landed the job and was soon fulfilling the various functions of radio station board operator. Before long, Saturday’s late-night shift fell my way. Most thought this an unenviable position, but I was glad for the opportunity to serve as Leigh’s engineer. The near-empty station and Leigh’s jazz selections created a relaxed atmosphere compared with the frenetic pace of the broadcast day.

Leigh is a Minnesota native who spent some time in New York City in the early 1950s and then returned to St. Paul to work in radio and later for the 3M Corporation. That’s about all I knew about his past. His taste in jazz was a bit different than mine, but that was not surprising. Leigh was deep into Johnny Hodges and the big bands. I liked Paul Desmond and fusion. But to pigeonhole either of us by these narrow overviews would be a disservice, as I quickly came to see. As the weeks went by and my number of Saturday night shifts mounted, my interest in older jazz increased. Leigh played a mix of old and new, but largely stayed with the music of the 1940s and 1950s, which his listeners had come to expect.

As my father prized arrangements over solo virtuosity, I grew up hearing Tommy Dorsey, Harry James, Benny Goodman and, especially, Glenn Miller. Leigh played a little of the Dorsey Brothers and less of Miller. He too liked Benny Goodman, but was even more interested in bands that I knew little about. I was aware of the bigger hits of Duke Ellington, of course, and had even participated in two high school jazz clinics run by Stan Kenton, but Leigh played material from these artists that I had never heard before, deep catalogue stuff. I learned a lot about music on those Saturday nights, but was usually ready for 4 A.M. to roll around so I could start the syndicated Jazz Alive reels and head home to bed. It wasn’t until Leigh was assigned the task of recording individual jazz modules that my Master Class in Jazz Appreciation really began.

By the early 1980s, the Minnesota Public Radio empire had multiple FM stations positioned around the state and one AM station in St. Paul. I think the AM had been a donor’s gift, but it was sort of a white elephant for the place. We filled the signal with news and some simulcasting, but the FCC demanded that the station not just be a “repeater” of the FM signal. Leigh was asked to put together a series of one-hour shows that could be run on the AM station at night. These were to be self-contained shows that would fill time while providing original content. Leigh agreed to come in to record these shows after his 3M day was over, and I volunteered to be his board operator.

We were well aware that these were production-line shows, cranking out three or even four of them a night if we could do them in real-time without stopping. “Sausage links” is what Leigh called them, but he also knew that there was precious little space given to jazz on any radio station, so was glad for the opportunity to fill this void. He took the task very seriously. Because of repeats, these shows could ultimately have a larger audience than his Saturday night statewide broadcasts.

Every module needed to be exactly 55 minutes in length in order to allow for the five-minute newscast from AP at the top of each hour. No problem. We started with some basics, recording four hours on Louis Armstrong. Featuring only one artist per show, Leigh was able to give his listeners a well-rounded musical portrait of each artist.  While rolling tape in the control room, I learned of artists never heard in my youthful years: Jimmy Lunceford, the Sauter-Finegan Orchestra, Jack Teagarden, Benny Carter. Fascinating material, with each selection back-announced by Leigh’s informative but concise commentary. Sometimes he was reading liner notes, sometimes jazz reference books, but most often he was giving information from his own knowledge of jazz and from years of living with the music.

Leigh was open to suggestion, direct or circuitous. At one break between tapings, I asked about baritone sax man Gerry Mulligan and his unexpected tenure with Dave Brubeck. After answering my question, Leigh decided that we would next do a series of Mulligan modules. Fine. I think we did six hours. I even provided a couple of albums. And then we did two more hours of lesser-known material by the classic Brubeck quartet. It was work for both of us, but simultaneously a luxury to be able to record as many shows as we wanted on whichever artists struck Leigh’s fancy.

We were in the studio when the wire services reported the death of Earl “Fatha” Hines. We assembled a four-hour special on the great pianist that very night that was picked up the next day by the NPR network and distributed nationally. Leigh had the knowledge and the recordings; I knew how to operate turntables and tape machines. We flew.

Leigh Kamman was successful in providing jazz to the Minneapolis/St. Paul region and beyond.  As suspected from the first, those modules were aired frequently for a period of several years, but because there were so many of them we never had a listener complaint concerning duplication. Also, each hour would stand up to repeat listening. This is because Leigh would play the well-known material by an artist from the station’s music library, but he would also dig into his personal record collection and into that of his friend Ray Marklund. Together they would regularly come up with fascinating recordings from deep within their own archives.

Leigh consistently kept the focus on the music, and never on himself. He had spoken to Duke Ellington on numerous occasions, first as a 17-year-old fan at a train station! But he wouldn’t think of dropping this fascinating nugget into a conversation in order to impress. I had worked with Leigh close to three years before I heard him mention, in passing, about speaking with Charlie Parker. I froze at the tape deck with reel in hand. I asked him to expand a bit, but he drifted away to another subject.

It makes sense that Leigh would not stress his conversations with Charlie Parker. For one thing, hard bop was not his favorite form of jazz. And there weren’t a lot of upbeat aspects to address in Parker’s life during the 1950s, when they met. Leigh played Bird on the air, but not frequently. One time when I pressed him a bit, Leigh did say that he had talked to Charlie Parker, Billie Holiday and Oscar Pettiford. As I recall, Leigh said they were all together at his New York City apartment after their respective gigs. I asked Leigh if he had any overall remembrances of the conversation. He paused for a long while and then finally said, “They were all quite bitter about money.”

“You mean,” I asked, “they felt cheated?”

“Yes,” was all Leigh said, but this short response said worlds.

Leigh had very little to say about various musicians’ public struggles with substance abuse or their detrimental personality quirks unless these things had to do with the music itself. During his time in New York, I’m sure he had seen the darker side of the music alley up close and had no interest in lingering there.

If Leigh was a jazz fan first, he also knew the realities of the business side. He was slow to get involved with anything that might step on the rights of musicians, keenly aware that paying gigs were a professional musician’s lifeblood. I never knew Leigh to take a comp seat; this would hurt ticket sales and the bottom line for the performer. He was also very aware of who owned the rights to which recordings and was determined that no one was to be cheated out of a fair share. One night I showed Leigh a recent Joel Whitburn book that listed a record’s peak position and overall statistical performance on the Billboard charts. Leigh looked at it for a while and proclaimed it of limited use because it did not include the copyright holder for each song. Wow. But that’s what he wanted to know! Chart position and sales figures can be manipulated. Ownership is ownership.

Leigh was responsible for helping keep jazz not only on the airwaves but also on the stages of the Minneapolis/St. Paul area. Whether from weekly promotion on the radio or actual involvement with booking artists, he remained among the greatest supporters of jazz in the area. One time Leigh told me that an old friend from New York was coming to town and that he wanted the station to record his talk. I didn’t think much about it until he later casually mentioned that the name of his friend was John Hammond!

Some younger jazz aficionados, usually new to the genre, were critical of the playlist heard on the Saturday night show. True, it did not always reflect the latest trends, but that wasn’t because Leigh was unaware of them. I would regularly see him investigating the Minneapolis jazz scene, from locals like the Natural Life band and the talented Peterson family to touring individuals like Phil Woods, Howard Roberts and Jon Hendricks. I saw him at Minneapolis’ famous First Avenue club when Wynton Marsalis first played there in 1981, checking-out the new young lions. Leigh was easily identifiable in the packed house by his suit and tie, the only one so dressed except the band. Just as with his radio show, he was drawn to the music. He had a very open mind and a broad musical perspective; but he also knew what would and would not work well on his weekly Jazz Image broadcast.

When the numbers were counted, we did a total of 187 modules and I worked at least 150 Saturday nights with Leigh. After that, the MPR network acquired a long sought-after deal with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, and the need to fill time became less critical. We would plug into the CBC for long stretches. The modules project was suspended and even the length of Leigh’s Saturday night show was scaled back. Formats shifted.

In the fall of 1983 I made plans to depart Minnesota for Texas. I didn’t have direct contact with Leigh for several years after that. Even so, it was clear that he was keeping his ear to the ground. When I received an academic accolade, he sent congratulations through mutual friends. On the rare occasions when our letters did form a pre e-mail conversation, he was always encouraging me to return to radio-even going so far as to point out jobs he thought appropriate. His confidence was encouraging, of course. But I left radio, in part, because I had already enjoyed the good fortune of doing everything in broadcasting that I wanted to do, things almost exclusively related to music. I would later have other fine teachers in various fields of study, but Leigh Kamman’s lessons on jazz and on personal grace have stayed with me the longest.

158,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/wilmeth/concert-review-lou-menchacas-jazz-express-in-wisconsin/,"Lou Menchaca Let the jazz fit the room. A recent Saturday night in Thiensville, Wisc., saw Lou Menchaca’s quartet assembled in a tiny corner of the Cheel, a small restaurant that specializes in Nepalese fare. Well prepared for the gig, tenor saxophonist Albert Abena set aside his large horn in favor of flute and clarinet. The leader’s trumpet was traded for the softer sound of his flugelhorn, while an acoustic bass provided rhythm. Only the Roland piano required a power source, but this was certainly not the only electricity present within the group.

Using this impromptu stripped-down instrumentation, gentle music filled the room for late evening diners. It served as background ambience for those who chose to talk. But for the ones who came to listen, the quartet consistently provided rich rewards, as recognizable tunes and excellent solos filled several outstanding sets.

Benny Golson’s “Killer Joe” opened the night, with each player checking the atmosphere in the room. Satisfied that actual jazz would not only be tolerated but encouraged, Menchaca then led his group through what became a Miles Davis tribute set. Fine renditions of “My Funny Valentine,” “Freddie Freeloader” and “On Green Dolphin Street” were played. The leader was generous with the solo space for his other players, but he never allowed the tunes to get cumbersomely long or the solos self-indulgent.

Because of a chamber jazz approach to the instrumentation, the mix was good and each instrument could be clearly heard. Although Theo Merriweather’s keyboard was electric, it had the sound of an acoustic piano, fitting the tone of the other instruments. Clean and precise lines were heard all night from the bass of Tom McGirr, both as he offered rhythmic support and when embarking on an occasional solo.

The clarinetist took a few well-considered solos, but equally impressive were the tight harmony lines that Abena played with Menchaca’s flugelhorn during the heads of several pieces. The reed player’s less frequently heard flute also brought a fresh dimension to the music. I would like to hear this same band on a night when Abena is blowing his tenor, but in this intimate setting the clarinet did not seem like a replacement, but rather a logical instrument of choice.

The leader himself always knew right where the most interesting notes in a chord were hidden. Menchaca’s horn solos brought new life to these standards, reminding the listener why they are so durable in the first place. In addition to the Miles book, other selections included Stanley Turrentine’s “Sugar” and the standard “You Stepped Out of a Dream.”

The band, like the room itself, was calm; tempos remained relaxed. Menchaca allowed a great amount of freedom in this atmosphere, and sometimes tradition was laid aside. One of the players occasionally took a second solo on a tune, perhaps thinking of something he had forgotten to say in his first break, or maybe wanting to comment musically on a colleague’s previous solo.

If the first rule of public performance is to know the room and its audience, Lou Menchaca and his Jazz Express succeeded beautifully. The quartet did an excellent job of presenting high quality jazz to this sometimes attentive audience. ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912205597.84/warc/CC-MAIN-20190326160044-20190326182044-00492.warc.gz
159,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/wilmeth/concert-review-the-dan-nimmer-trio/,"Of course I was interested in checking out a live performance by Dan Nimmer. In fact, I had been waiting for just such a date. Here is a young man from the Great Midwest who had gone to New York City and found a way to audition for Wynton Marsalis’ open piano chair. And get the gig! I admired his ability as Wynton’s accompanist, but I wanted to hear him on his own. The opportunity arose on a cold January night in Milwaukee, when Dan Nimmer graciously agreed to close the Eastside Jazzfest, a day-long teaching seminar for the youth of his hometown.

Nimmer chose a balance of originals and standards for this set as group leader. The trio began with his own “Lu’s Bounce,” a 12-minute uptempo workout that showed the pianist unafraid to take chances. As the number’s head led into improvisation, Nimmer immediately dove for deep water. A confident player, he was apparently untroubled about whether he could completely pull off each idea. He refused to take the safe path during this entire set, starting with measure one. That’s jazz!

This strong beginning was followed by “Do You Mind?,” another fast original. A fine composer himself, Nimmer is obviously very aware of the vast music catalog that precedes his era. Brief quotes of various melodies from jazz’s past could be heard on these two openers, and at times the pianist could have been channeling Oscar Peterson or even Art Tatum.

With almost 20 minutes of virtuosity, the trio had immediately offered the audience what it came to hear. In fact, Nimmer sounded almost embarrassed as he said that for their third number, the group would now tone down the fireworks and play a ballad. Tad Dameron’s “If You Could See Me Now” was given a beautiful interpretation, during which the pianist lovingly caressed the keys. An atmospheric performance of Antonio Carlos Jobim’s “Corcovado” followed, after which the pianist returned to his own book with “Modern Day Blues.”

Nimmer’s full-hand chord work was impressive, as were his articulate single-line runs. The emphasis on melody during the set is noteworthy, as Nimmer never let his considerable chops dominate a piece for the sake of show. Here is a pianist who respects the song, a fact which became increasingly clear when hearing which non-original selections Nimmer chose to play.

This night was very much of a family affair. Nimmer was playing for an intimate hometown audience of about 80. His parents were in the second row, and former teachers and classmates could be seen throughout the hall. The set was scheduled for an hour, and as the final selections began, Nimmer introduced an original written for his nephew Ray. This must be one active kid, because “Ray” never stopped bouncing and featured a lot of staccato runs. Nimmer finally seemed to be having fun, or at least relaxing a bit. Sitting at a black Steinway grand in suit and tie, his attitude was sometimes hard to gauge. He traded exuberant fours on this last trio piece with drummer Brian Ritter and bassist Jake Vinsel, both up from Chicago for this one-off gig.

After a strong and deserved ovation, Nimmer dedicated a solo piece to his parents, Ellington’s “Reflections in D.” As before, his touch was so controlled that his fingers seemed to flutter above the keys more than actually play them. The Duke would have been pleased by the respect Dan Nimmer showed, both for the composer’s music and for the pianist’s own mother and father.

Bass and drums kicked back in for the break tune, during which the pianist acknowledged his band and the audience, and then bid us good night. ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912205597.84/warc/CC-MAIN-20190326160044-20190326182044-00420.warc.gz
160,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/columns/wilmeth/four-nights-with-jaco-pastorius/,"Jaco Pastorius is dead. I mean no disrespect by this statement. I point here to the lasting condition of the departed bassist neither to celebrate his birthday nor to lament his death anniversary. This article remembers Jaco because his was a gift that deserves regular accolades. Having become accustomed to his recordings, it might be easy to take his talent for granted. But it must be said and said often: Jaco Pastorius possessed a musical gift like no other. Ever.

What makes me think of Jaco today are my recollections concerning the death of George Harrison. At the time of the guitarist’s passing, nearly 10 years ago, I asked my college-age students if any of them knew who Harrison was. A hush fell. Absolutely no name recognition. I then told them that he was a member of the Beatles and asked if any of them knew what instrument he had played. Silence. I asked the question that day to three different classes. In the third, a young man sincerely ventured, “He played the trumpet?” I did not continue to probe my other classes’ knowledge of George. I couldn’t stand it.

Some years back I asked an elder statesman of country music how it was that so many of the greats could be forgotten by modern fans. It particularly surprised me that this was happening in the world of country which, like jazz, is an American musical style that supposedly reveres its own past. I had recently seen an Austin City Limits broadcast on public television by Hank Thompson and his Brazos Valley Boys. To its credit, the show gave him the entire hour. But as Thompson ran through his biggest hits, it was clear that even this Texas audience of music fans was unfamiliar with the songs. It was an uncomfortable set to watch, as this performer with over 60 Billboard chart entries drew only polite applause for even the largest of his many Top 10 hits. Even Johnny Cash-before Rick Rubin, Joaquin Phoenix and the Grim Reaper restored his legacy-had an hour on the same program with only a slightly better reception. This was in the mid-1980s, shortly after Cash had been unceremoniously dropped by Columbia.

When asked about this epidemic of amnesia concerning music’s past, I was told, “These performers are forgotten because they ain’t got no drummer.” After realizing that the assessment had nothing to do with percussion, I pondered this theory. Certainly, high-profile supporters, or “drummers” of promotion, could do wonders for a fading or forgotten career. Dwight Yoakam gave Buck Owens a complete reboot, even coercing Buck back on the road with him to reestablish his respectability after the long, albeit lucrative nightmare of co-hosting Hee-Haw .

Willie Nelson’s duet albums gave new life to the careers of many of his musical heroes, from Hank Snow to Webb Pierce. For those performers who Willie wanted to return to the spotlight but were no longer available for collaboration, such as Lefty Frizzell, he recorded tribute albums-just as Merle Haggard had previously done for both Bob Wills and Jimmie Rodgers when Merle’s sales figures were such that Capitol Records was willing to release anything he wanted.

Similar album-length projects are found in jazz. Louis Armstrong plays the music of Fats Waller. Sonny Fortune invokes the spirit of John Coltrane. Kenny Burrell honors Duke Ellington. Herb Ellis emulates Charlie Christian. Air remembers Buddy Bolden (if only for one tune). And in a most unexpected genre-crossing example, Rolling Stones drummer Charlie Watts offers his tribute to the recordings of Charlie Parker with Strings! This personal recognition of inspiration has certainly been true in other areas of music: Bette Midler honors Rosemary Clooney. Jeff Beck pays homage to Cliff Gallup. Eric Clapton respects Robert Johnson to a fault. Phish performs full albums by the Beatles and the Who. I can offer Jaco Pastorius no tribute album or collaboration project. But I can shout his name out loud in an effort to be his drummer.

I had the great fortune of seeing Jaco in concert on four occasions. At no time was he less than brilliant. It was impossible for me to look away from him for very long, even when he was not soloing. The following is an overview of my four nights with Jaco, beginning with the time I saw him by chance.

We were college students excited about a road trip, with the intent of going to see John McLaughlin. We all knew that McLaughlin had abandoned his electric guitar, but we fired up for the journey anyway-Cedar Falls, Iowa, to the great city of Minneapolis, Minn. It was already April, but spring was slow to arrive in 1976. We were going, really, on the off chance that McLaughlin would renounce his new acoustic band Shakti and plug in that twin-necked Gibson and turn up! Just for that one night. We knew it couldn’t happen, but we were such fans of the original Mahavishnu Orchestra that we made the trek anyway. Also on the bill was Weather Report. That was fine with us, but Weather Report was not the reason for this trip. Most of us knew their early records. Some thought they might perform “Orange Lady.” I wanted to hear their “Boogie Woogie Waltz.”

We bought tickets at the door and were told that we were purchasing good seats. Actually, they were at the far end of the arena. No matter. We had good sight lines of the stage and we were excited to be in the city! The concert was one of the early sports arena presentations for this era of jazz. The fact that so many tickets could be sold for such music is telling. An acoustic Indian music quintet playing an arena? Clearly we were not the only Midwesterners anxious to see John McLaughlin, no matter what style he played. And I’m certain that we were not alone in wanting John to whip out that screaming Gibson.

McLaughlin’s Shakkti opened the night, and the group emerged to sit on the stage floor. I like Ravi Shankar as much as the next guy-maybe more. I owned two of the Yehudi Menuhin/Ravi Shankar West Meets East LPs. I would actually listen to the Shankar side of Harrison’s Concert for Bangla Desh benefit album (if only occasionally). And I owned the obscure Ravi Shankar Live at the Woodstock Music & Arts Festival LP. As such, I wasn’t completely out of my element with this instrumentation. And since it soon became clear that there would be no “Noonward Race” played this night, we sat back to hear what McLaughlin’s new direction was all about. But in retrospect, it wasn’t completely new for him-if one goes back to listen to McLaughlin’s second album as a leader (My Goals Beyond, 1970) there is acoustic music aplenty. And even some tracks on the studio Mahavishnu LPs, such as “A Lotus on Irish Springs,” show that at no time in his career had McLaughlin been a complete stranger to his acoustic guitar.

As expected, John McLaughlin was lighting fast, and the sound was surprisingly clean considering the booming acoustics of the large room. But at the time, like most attending the concert that night, I was bound to be disappointed with McLaughlin’s new endeavor. And I was.

Shakti concluded their set. We all thought, yep, John’s still fast. Then we waited for the stage to be reset. The lights dimmed and the air filled with burning enhancement. Somebody leaned over and said to the collective row, “I hear that Weather Report is supposed to have some hot new bass player with them.” What had happened to their former bass man, Alphonso Johnson? Nobody knew. Weather Report kicked into their first tune. The group included the expected co-leaders Joe Zawinul on varied synthesizers and Wayne Shorter on tenor sax. But who was that electric bass player? Some were even expecting an acoustic bass, but of course that never happened. Nor did they play “Orange Lady” or “Boogie Woogie Waltz” that night.

In fact, I can’t tell you what numbers they did play-probably “Elegant People and “Scarlet Woman.” But individual selections didn’t matter for me. It was the sound that was the focus. My clear, indelible memory is one of an odd-looking young man bathed in a white spotlight. He was center stage holding a beat-up bass high on his chest, playing like it was an instrument on loan from Mount Olympus. I kept hearing these amazingly fluid solo runs. But that couldn’t be the electric bass. Still, Zawinul wasn’t even playing at this point. It hadto be the new guy! Playing those crystal clear harmonics-on a bass? And the speed and cleanliness of each line, even in that fidelity challenged hall.

I was stunned. It seemed they played about 10 minutes, but I’m sure they did a full set. The lights came up and I said something articulate like, “Wow.” Then I gushed about how that was the best bass player I had ever heard. Some of our group quietly agreed, clearly knocked out by what they had just witnessed. Others dismissed it as “all show.” I don’t know-it blew my mind. I couldn’t stop thinking about that bass man: his stage presence, his sound, and especially his chops. Like many others in the audience that night, the flame of my casual interest in Weather Report was immediately fanned into a blaze.

The next time the band came though the Midwest, Jaco Pastorius was a star. They were to play Iowa City’s Hancher Auditorium in late 1977 and I had good seats, about 14 rows back with Jaco directly in front of me. I came prepared for this one and taped the show, a typical mono audience recording of its day: low-fi but listenable. Even with questionable fidelity, that tape demonstrates the power of the entire band and Jaco’s place in it. “Black Market” and “A Remark You Made” were high points. Since this was after the release of Heavy Weather, they of course played “Birdland” near the end. The use of pre-recorded tapes to set distinctive moods, such as the sound of ships leading into and out of “Gibraltar,” may appear trite now. But these sonic settings worked well that night.

Midway through the set Jaco did his lengthy solo spot. Watching him perform this segment, seeing how engaged he was, and how he obtained the sounds from his dilapidated Fender, added a new element to admiring the technique he could display with seeming effortlessness. His physical antics were fun to watch, accompanied at times by the automatic rhythm track he was playing against. Even at this point, however, a backlash was setting in. I recall a review in Billboard magazine of a solo New York City performance taking him to task for too high a ratio of stage antics and showboating to actual playing, something Bill Graham had criticized Jimi Hendrix for (to his face) only a few years earlier. Nobody in the hall that night minded Jaco’s accompanying theatrics; this was the real deal of musical virtuosity. If he wanted to visually embellish his playing with some gratuitous showmanship, fine by us.

Like many of my music obsessive contemporaries, I was guilty of looking away from other bassists when Jaco came onto the scene. Most obvious, of course, is the oft-belabored comparison to the great Stanley Clarke. Before I became aware of Jaco, I had seen Return to Forever about half a dozen times, beginning with the Bill Connors era. The common saying is that after Jaco showed up, everybody forgot about Stanley. True, and yet … not quite.

The real problem was that, for me, I already was losing interest in Return to Forever about the same time Jaco arrived. RTF’s No Secret had not clicked with me, and the elaborate production of Romantic Warrior reduced the intense improvisational stretch sections that had made Where Have I Known You Before and especially Hymn of the 7th Galaxy so interesting.

I always felt that tension in the band could actually be heard on the later Columbia records of Return to Forever, especially after Stanley Clarke’s solo albums started outselling the new RTF group albums and Chick Corea’s own solo releases. When no less than three of a quartet’s members are intent on solo careers while also keeping a band together, something has to give. Just ask Ringo.

Individual side projects never seemed problematic for Weather Report. Perhaps it was the revolving door of personnel that surrounded Joe Zawinul and Wayne Shorter from the group’s inception. Zawinul, although releasing several solo records during his decade with Cannonball Adderley, had only one solo album during the time Weather Report was active. But this came out in 1971 and in no way served as competition for his newly formed band.  Five years later Jaco would also have an eponymous album released on the cusp of his joining Weather Report. But instead of that solo album competing with the group, this great record actually served to promote Weather Report and their new bassist. Shorter continued to release well received albums during the 1970s but, unlike Return to Forever’s fan base, these solo projects did not seem to distract or confuse Weather Report’s audience.

Speaking of side projects, the only time I saw Jaco outside of the Weather Report realm was when he played on the culminating tour of Joni Mitchell’s excursion into jazz in late summer 1979, beating Sting’s celebrated dip into these waters by half a decade. Joni’s ringing electric guitar and open tunings were accentuated by Pat Metheny’s distinctive electric guitar voice and Jaco’s unmistakable bass. Lyle Mays’ keyboards and Michael Brecker’s tenor sax rounded out this high-priced backing band. I have been told that Peter Erskine was originally slated to drum for the tour, but this would have violated a section of the Weather Report contract, which essentially stated that Zawinul’s sidemen could not depart en masse to form another band. Smart guy. As such, Don Alias was on drums for the tour.

Each of the band members had a solo feature, but this was Joni Mitchell’s show and she was the focal point. The set consisted mainly of tunes from the era of Hejira through her latest LP at that time, the heartfelt but problematic Mingus album, a genre-crossing tribute that cost Mitchell some of her longstanding audience. The touring band was excellent, of course, but during the concert there were times when Jaco’s physical acrobatics seemed to draw strained smiles of tolerance from both Metheny and Mitchell.

Because Joni Mitchell’s live Shadows and Light LP captured the tour’s standard set list, I have never regretted not taping that show. The same can’t be said of the last time I saw Jaco. Some critics have viewed the tour of 1980 as a holding pattern for this immensely popular line-up. Jaco’s talent was starting to be taken for granted. Most fans who wanted to see him had been given the opportunity by this time, with Weather Report playing parts of the country often bypassed by even major tours. But for me this was no concert of coasting. The band was playing harder than any time I had seen them and were presenting a lot of newly released material-this was not a hits review. I had balcony seats, and watching the band operate as a unit was actually better than staring at a single part of the whole, which had been the case for me in Iowa City. Breathtaking to the last! I distinctly remember a smokin’ version of “Brown Street,” and recall that “The Orphan” served as an especially strong finale for that February night.

And this concert also served as my own finale with Jaco and with Weather Report. I began to lose interest in the band shortly after the largely live 8:30 album and the follow-up Night Passage, which is odd in retrospect, since I thought that the studio material on side 4 of 8:30 was some of the strongest in the band’s catalogue. Weather Report continued to record and tour, with and then without Jaco Pastorius. But I no longer searched out their new releases even before Jaco’s departure. I heard that Zawinul retooled the band and changed the name to Weather Update, but I never checked that out either. Even the later days of Weather Report itself were off my radar. In fact, I recently came across an 8-track tape of their album Domino Theory, a post-Jaco release I had never even heard of.

Many defend the band after Jaco’s departure, and I don’t disagree. It was I who dropped out. I never felt too guilty for drifting from Weather Report, if I’d ever thought about it. I believed that I had band cred for being somewhat into them in their pre-Jaco days. I owned the import Live in Tokyo double album and had even interviewed drummer Eric Gravatt about his days in the band. But that’s another story.

In hindsight, the Jaco era was just one part of this great band’s timeline. It’s clear that Joe Zawinul felt this way, for when the 2002 Live and Unreleased collection came out, as producer he made sure that the two-CD set covered many (but not all) eras of the band’s performance spectrum. This selective overview is laudable, as this set could easily have become a Jaco Pastorius tribute, and likely would have sold better. Concerning sales figures, Columbia Records clearly has limited economic interest in the latter Weather Report LPs since the company has allowed several of these to go out of print.

Speaking of recordings that would sell, while some legitimate releases have dribbled out since Jaco’s death in 1987, I have been assured that many high-fidelity concert recordings remain locked away in various vaults. One that comes to mind for me is the performance by Jaco’s Word of Mouth big band at the Kool Jazz Festival of 1982, which was professionally recorded by National Public Radio for their Jazz Alive series. Most of this concert was broadcast, and these tapes are definitely worthy of official release. I’m certain there are others.

Jaco Pastorius does not need me to be his “drummer.” His recordings include all the proof required as a testament to his abilities. This article is written as I become increasingly aware of how fortunate I was to have attended concerts during the same short era that this virtuoso was storming world stages. But since no artist can really promote himself from the grave, even an incandescent light such as Jaco provided might not be clearly seen by subsequent generations. Individuals like Duke Ellington and Miles Davis enjoyed lengthy careers and have ample aural documentation for later admirers to pore over and posthumously appreciate. Jaco Pastorius, much less so. But the finite amount of music he has left is worthy of continued rediscovery, for we who know it well and for the uninitiated. What this article asks is that the recordings of Jaco Pastorius be a regular and inspirational part of any musical diet.

 I spoke with the great jazz pianist Oscar Peterson on a winter afternoon in 1979 at his Minneapolis hotel. He was in town to perform his own extended composition with the Minnesota Orchestra called “The Canadiana Suite,” a work originally released by Verve in 1964 as a trio recording. I believe now that Peterson had revived and rearranged this for performance because of his renewed interest in long-form pieces for jazz. These orchestral compositions would culminate in his 1981 album The Royal Wedding Suite, a celebration of the union of Prince Charles and Lady Diana. Although each suite shows Peterson’s abilities as a composer and an arranger, both are now largely forgotten.

In spite of his concert with an orchestra being only hours away, Mr. Peterson was happy to discuss his own solo and small group performances. However, he was also quick to draw parallels between jazz forms and classical music. As we began, I pointed out which of his albums I liked best and asked him to comment on some of his newer Pablo Records releases. He was happy to speak in specifics about albums from his entire career. As we neared the end of the brief amount of time his agent had set aside for me, I used one of my mainstay questions of that time, his interest in Duke Ellington. I asked this specifically because of the major orchestral jazz piece that he was about to perform, and I compared it with some of Ellington’s extended works. This discussion on the Duke led to some intense reaction, as did my later use of the names Art Tatum and Keith Jarrett in the same sentence.

As with any interview situation, there are certain conversational threads I regret not following. This is especially true with over 30 years of hindsight. What strikes me now is how Mr. Peterson went out of his way to stress that he is “not a musical bigot” about the electric piano. I can’t help but wonder what he thought of Chick Corea’s or Herbie Hancock’s use of the Rhodes as their primary instrument for several years in the mid-1970s. I would also have liked to hear what he thought of Miles Davis’ later records, Bitches Brew and beyond. But even if some of this had occurred to me during our discussion, this sort of questioning can seem confrontational. As the transcript makes clear, we made our way into some controversy without my seeking it. Fortunately, as I thought then and now, it was not directed at me.

I began by asking Mr. Peterson about his work with his various trios and if he missed that setting.

OSCAR PETERSON: For over 20 years I’ve had trios of one type of another. And as much as I’ve enjoyed them, it’s quite a long time to spend with one format. With Jazz being the creative and improvisational music it is, the solo [performance] gives me a chance to do whatever I feel like doing at the piano without having to worry about somebody coming with me. I’m not saying this to deride any of the trios, because I have loved each one for various reasons. The solo setting is selfish but it gives me a chance to really get with my instrument and do my own personal thing.

TOM WILMETH: You like having everything left up to you, the entire responsibility for the music.

OP : That’s right. And I think it’s no different for people going to hear a classical music recital. It’s a piano, it’s a player, and it’s their thoughts together.

TW: Do you ever go back and listen to your trio’s Verve label recordings at all? I really enjoy the We Get Requests album.

OP: Oh yeah, that’s a favorite with a lot of people.

TW: And your adaptation of the strong writing from West Side Story.

OP: That is strong music, you’re right. That was a challenge for us because the music is different. It doesn’t lay like ordinary jazz selections of that particular era. I like that album.

TW: I also like Trio Live From Chicago.

OP: I think that is one of our most powerful albums because it was [recorded] at a time when that particular trio of Ray Brown and Ed Thigpen had become saturated within itself and it had the confidence of its own professional quality. We all knew what we could do within the context of that trio and it worked well at that particular time. I’m hoping that one will be reissued soon.

TW: Could you point to any of your more recent Pablo albums that you are particularly pleased with?

OP: I like the Nightchild album-that’s the one where I use the electronic keyboards. There were questions asked about that because it was a departure. I thought it was time to put the question to rest and musically show that I’m not a bigot about the electric piano. I think it has its place, obviously, by all the marvelous things that have been done, not only with electronic piano, but with some of the other electronic instruments as well. It’s just another musical statement in a different medium, that’s all.

TW: Bobby Lyle maintains that the Fender Rhodes has a very locked-in sound.

OP: He’s right. That’s the problem with electric piano. You’re dealing with so many overtones and they are forever there. The acoustical piano has a much cleaner deliverance from an audio standpoint-when you hit a note, you hear the note. When you hit a note on an electric piano, it can filter off into other overtones and will roll on you, so to speak. No matter what you do it has a tremendous layover, note for note, that you don’t have on the acoustic piano unless you make it play that way. I feel I can do a lot more with the deviation of sound with an acoustic. As I say, I have nothing against the electric piano; once in a while it’s a nice change and it’s fun to play. They’re fine for the pop players who just use it for certain effects, but not for continual, serious playing in a jazz group.

TW: When you get the time, whose albums do you put on at home?

OP: I listen to everybody. I am a fan of certainly most of the pianists. That’s the broadest field of all. Guitar, I find, is a wide field. I like to listen to everybody from Lester Young and Dizzy right up to Freddie Hubbard. I love Hank Jones and what Joe Pass does. I’m not a musical bigot, totally. I have my likes and dislikes as everyone else does, but I listen to a wide range of music.

TW: Do you find yourself going back and putting on Ellington?

OP: Of course. You have to. I always try to include some Ellington in every concert that I do. I think it’s almost mandatory.

TW: Ellington’s major work “Black, Brown, and Beige,” drew a lot of criticism for trying to stretch the boundaries of traditional jazz. You have written some pieces for jazz and orchestra, including “The Canadiana Suite,” which you will be performing tonight. Do you have any thoughts on the idea that jazz should stay away from serious musical structures and only be considered light music?

OP: You have all kinds of heavy works [in jazz]. You can go through the Gil Evans book and find some pretty heavy pieces in there. Without getting into [listing] a vast number of players-Cecil Taylor’s work is pretty heavy, if you want to go that way. You get writers the magnitude of Ellington and Strayhorn-you can’t get much heavier than that for writing, I don’t care in what medium you want to write it. There are classical composers who admire these men. You’re talking about the validity of two geniuses that elect to [compose] that type of lengthy work. It has definite credibility.

TW: Leroy Jenkins came through town a while back and said that, to him, everything is passé except new, free jazz. I mentioned Ellington and he stopped and admitted that Ellington was perhaps the one exception.

OP: He said, “Everything“?

TW: It was a blanket statement that, for him, almost all jazz from the past is passé.

OP: Well, that’s a stupid statement. You can’t wipe away all that talent by saying that. That shows an inadequacy in his own make-up. One thing I teach new players is to respect those who have gone before them. They never would have arrived if the others hadn’t first paved the way. The easiest way to become a talented artist, if you have that kind of talent, is to be very open and receptive to what has gone before you. That gives you a bigger vocabulary and a larger understanding. When I had the Jazz School we insisted that all of the students listen to what had gone on before, whether it be Miles or Bird. You can’t negate a talent like Charlie Parker or Dizzy Gillespie and say it’s passé. It’s the fundamentals of jazz! And to be ignorant enough to say that this is passé … [long pause] You know, it’s people like that I can’t tolerate. I get very upset about that because it’s a form of musical racism that doesn’t exist with true artists. If you were to talk with any of the greats, certainly Duke Ellington or Dizzy Gillespie and so forth, they don’t look around and say, “This isn’t any good from here to here.” They just won’t do that. They are very intelligent and discerning in their likes and dislikes, and I think that’s what helps to make them great artists.

 [Note: After this impassioned and angry rebuttal to Leroy Jenkins, I thought it best to return to safe turf, such as discussing his primary idol of the piano.] 

TW: You are spoken of as the natural successor to Art Tatum. You certainly don’t need to be called the next anybody, but do you have any comments in this comparison?

OP: They probably say that because they know of my total involvement with the piano. I don’t know what being the next Art Tatum means. There never was and never will be another Art Tatum. If I’m an extension of his thinking, fine. But I didn’t set out to be that. It’s like who will the next Dizzy be? There won’t really be a next Dizzy, but there are people who are greatly influenced by him. If you were to ask me who the next Oscar Peterson will be, I really don’t know. I am aware of exerting some influence on some of the young pianists, but I believe in the individual. Consequently, I believe everyone is influenced by the people that precede them, whether they realize it or not. And this is why I say that it is important that you listen. Eventually you shed whatever shell that [you have] of influence, and you come out on your own. If you have talent. I hope that what I’ve been doing has helped to revitalize interest in the Grand Lady of the Acoustical Piano, which is sort of the definitive instrument.

TW: Speaking of Art Tatum, we can thank Norman Granz for recording Tatum heavily during the last three years of his life: the 13-album solo set and the eight-record group masterpiece set.

OP: That was Norman’s major project, a fantastic project, and I think the whole world owes him a debt for that one! Art, in many cases, was very hard to find on records. This was a concerted effort certainly by Art Tatum and by Norman to put together this group of recordings.

TW: Speaking of expansive projects, as a pianist who often gives solo concerts, do you have any thoughts on Keith Jarrett and specifically his recent 10-record set of solo performances? Art Tatum is a different story.

OP: He sure is!!

TW: …but does anybody warrant a 10-record set like that?

OP: I don’t think Keith Jarrett does. I don’t happen to be a Jarrett fan, I’ll be very frank with you. I think it’s a fad. Dizzy had a very astute saying that I quote many times: Before a concert one time Norman Granz asked the horns to keep their solos short because of time limitations. I remember Dizzy looked up and said, “Listen, I can play everything I know in four bars.” That is a comedic saying, true, but I watched a solo Keith Jarrett television special and … it was not necessary. He didn’t do anything. I don’t like to come down on somebody, but he’s kidding. I would sooner hear 15 minutes of Art Tatum than to listen to two hours of Jarrett. There is just so much you can do. I can play the piano and I can sit down and go through that kind of performance and buffalo X amount of people. I’m not trying to nail him to the cross; I just don’t believe in that type of performance. You have to be a little more concise, a little more selective in what you decide to do. Anything you have to say that bears saying, you don’t need two hours to say it in. You can say it very concisely within five minutes, believe it or not. This is what the great orators of the world maintain, and the same thing applies to music.

TW: Just to reiterate, you feel that Jarrett is kidding, and he plays as he does because it’s currently popular.

OP: It became popular, and as a one-shot thing I don’t put it down. But is this going to be a continuing thing? Are we going to have to listen to 10 more albums to find out what he does? With the exception of Tatum, who was such a magnanimous talent that he certainly deserved … well, if he did 13 albums, he deserved 40. I wouldn’t want to sit down with Jarrett’s 10-record project. I really wouldn’t. I think I’m fairly productive and I know how much thought has gone into each of my albums, and I wouldn’t hesitate to sit down and play against Jarrett on that same kind of thing. I think I could do a much better job than that if I really wanted to, but I wouldn’t want to sit down for two hours and ramble along the piano. I don’t see where it is any way necessary. [pause] Keith Jarrett is the Liberace of jazz. I’m not trying to hurt him, but it’s true-he doesn’t play anything!
 NOTES:
The televised solo piano performance by Keith Jarrett which Oscar Peterson saw was probably the August 1977 concert filmed in Shelburne, Vermont, and subsequently broadcast by PBS.

The 10-record set by Keith Jarrett is The Sun Bear Concerts, recorded in 1976 and issued by ECM Records in 1978. The sheer length of this album prompted such reaction as Musician Magazine’s review headline, “Would You Buy a Ten-Record Set from This Man?” Even 34 years later, in a world accustomed to long-form releases and boxed sets that include complete discographies and full-length concerts, the 400-minute running time of this release would completely fill five CDs. (For logistical reasons, it is issued as a six-CD set.)  No matter the format, it’s a whole lot of improvised solo piano.

 Resonance Records, with the cooperation of National Public Radio (NPR), will release Sarah Vaughan-Live At Rosy’s on March 25. The two-CD set comprises newly discovered recordings of Vaughan’s performance at Rosy’s Jazz Club in New Orleans on May 31, 1978.

Accompanying Vaughan on the recording are pianist Carl Schroeder, bassist Walter Booker and drummer Jimmy Cobb.

The release includes nearly 90 minutes of music, some of which has never been previously broadcast, along with a 36-page book, and is presented in a six-panel digi-pak designed by Burton Yount. The book includes historic essays, interviews and memoirs by producer Zev Feldman; author and journalist James Gavin; journalist, author and critic Will Friedwald and many others.

Just after the release of the album, the U.S. Postal Service will honor Vaughan’s legacy by issuing a commemorative Forever Stamp. The ceremony will take place at the Sarah Vaughan Concert Hall at Newark Symphony Hall, 1020 Broad Street, Newark, N.J., at 11:00am, March 29.  Confirmed participants at the ceremony include Tony Bennett, Rhonda Hamilton (host of WBGO Radio’s Midday Jazz), Mayor Ras Baraka of Newark, Dr. Gloria White (pastor of Mount Zion Baptist Church), Ronald Stroman (Deputy Postmaster General) and vocalist Melba Moore. Confirmed performers include the Mount Zion Baptist Church Choir, Carrie Jackson, NJPAC Jazz for Teen Ensemble, Jazzmeia Horn (winner of the 2013 Sarah Vaughan Jazz Vocalist Competition) and Moore. According to a press release, “In February 2011, Resonance producer Zev Feldman connected with Tim Owens, the former producer of NPR’s weekly syndicated radio program, Jazz Alive!, which aired from 1977 to 1983 and won a Peabody Award. Owens mentioned to Feldman that he had tapes from the original broadcasts of the Jazz Alive! series, and that among these tapes were recordings of Sarah Vaughan’s 1978 concert performance at Rosy’s. Over the course of nearly four years, Feldman … tracked down all of the appropriate parties to ensure that this release would be fully endorsed and cleared by the Sarah Vaughan estate, plus by Walter Booker’s widow Bertha Hope, as well as the living band members Carl Schroeder and Jimmy Cobb and NPR Music in Washington, D.C.

168,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/departments/artist-profiles/dimitri-vassilakis-saxophonist-vocalist-composer-educator/,"Dimitri Vassilakis' album cover Lilian Alexakou:  What is the story of your latest jazz album Across the Universe?

Dimitri Vassilakis:   After losing my house and possessions due to a fire, back in 2009, I decided to record this album (my 4th on Candid Records) and unify my favorite music in a traveling mood with the feeling of lightness, not belonging anywhere in particular and not needing a lot of stuff. Recording mates is my NY quartet. Since 2007 we are very good friends being together in festivals, recordings and gigs in USA. Same thing with my guests on the album, I recorded with great cats and friends, so that I will continue to love and listen to this recording after long time…I wanted it to come out bright and positive…

Is there a notice on your vocal talent as you sing ten songs? 

I chose to appear with my double face of the horn player-vocalist, something similar to Chet Baker who is one of my main vocal influences. Also it is a way to bridge my background rock influences, as I started in the 80’s – together with my brother Pantelis Vassilakis I was a bass player/vocalist/songwriter of the Greek new wave-rock band Art of Parties. After immersing me into the jazz world, singing was put aside in favor of the sax. I came back to it just after finishing the trio album with Jeff “Tain” Watts and Essiet Essiet (a jazz suite entitled “Parallel Lines”). So my repertoire got broader including almost all the standards in the book and many rock memories…

In your CD cover you are looking for a taxi in Manhattan while in its inset you are in Karitsa, a remote green village next to Lake Plastira – Central Greece. How do you combine so different landscapes? 

I love both places for different reasons. New York is the world stage for jazz, there I get inspired, and I contact the scene. I develop myself as a player; I breathe and live with the best cats and beloved friends.  Karitsa is a village on top of Agrafa Mountains famous for its complete autonomy, where I escape from everything. I contact with breathtaking nature and I fill spirit and body with pure energy.

Have you created an excellent cd «Jazz For Bentley» in collaboration with the new car model of Bentley Continental GT? 

This album consists of selected tracks from my discography on Candid for the 50th anniversary special edition and some tracks recorded especially for Bentley. Since 2007 we collaborate with worldwide festivals and the idea was to connect this luxury brand with jazz. My favorite is «The Long And Winding Road», hope a good version for the drive…

Do you use Greek elements and myths, for example the Cretan labyrinth in cd-concepts? 

In my album «Daedalus Project -Labyrinth» -which was recorded in New York and produced by David Liebman – I used quite a few Greek/Balkan elements, always under the jazz and swinging umbrella. It was presented at Birdland, Yale, Smithsonian, South Bank Centre etc.  BBC voted it as 2nd jazz album of the year.  My intention was to speak a universal language connecting the ancient myth with other references mainly from Joyce and Kafka. More info at my blog below, as this album has become a subject for research from Universities in the US.    http://dimitrivassilakis.blogspot.gr/2010/09/labyrinth-saved-as.html

You are the author of the most popular book on saxophone in Greece which received the prestigious Alexander Onassis award. What advice do you give your students? 

This book was published to help students more or less of all levels, something that was not in the market, so it is still quite successful as an educational tool in Greece. I completed it after years of teaching many students at Conservatory and University level. During the process I learned so much from my students, some of them already made a name in the scene. My advice: “Follow the path with love and devotion.”

Are you involved in an innovative project named «The Greek Gang! »?

That project is based on the platform tomorrows warriors, which is an award winning educational concept in Britain. Offers jazz education to young players from underprivileged ghetto areas of inner cities. Going back to the early jazz years when there was no formal jazz education and many jazz giants graduated from the Duke Ellington, Art Blakey, Miles Davis etc. “Universities”…
The Greek Gang! is a very active ensemble mainly in London, with some of my ex-students as basis, they grow in time as new Greek jazzers come on stage bringing new sounds and ideas.
My next appearance is a 3-day mini London tour (Ronnie Scott’s, Bulls Head, Arts Depot) for London Jazz Festival 2012, with the aim to bridge the communities through the arts.

Have you invented the Art Escape Movement? 

Under the broad title Art Escape I imagine that in nowadays young artist can go out and create without waiting for the institution to pay attention…So if a venue, festival, organization etc is not booking them, then why not unite and make a project together with artists of all kinds – actor, dancer, visual, designer, painter/sculptor musician etc.  Then they will present it by themselves and find their own venue, whatever that may be…a  park, a friend’s house, basement or loft. Maybe knock at a neighbor’s door and ask if they would like some jazz or Shakespeare or similar with his dinner??… Art is like a Pandora box, can escape institutions and the establishment and becomes a more integral part of life. I will post more on my site soon.

You are a cyclist and marathon runner and BBC Music Magazine called you “Greek god of Jazz”. How do you describe yourself? 

I love biking and running and have run the Athens Classic Marathon on its historic celebration year in 2010. Since then also participated in many other races and I keep regularly fit. This is my way to fill up with energy, come in contact with nature and clean spirit and body. Through meditation and energy therapies I find balance, project and transmit clearer.
I consider myself lucky to have been born in Greece! Our collective perception of what is Greece and how Greek people should contribute to the world has been seriously corrupted and damaged nowadays… Greece should still be one of the main sources for new ideas and not the cunning beggar.

I love nature I appreciate the history and language, often I am writing poetry, but in the end as an artist I feel a citizen of the world. Jazz gives me a purpose in life and I consider it a heart path
Sounds, images, poems, insights, tours…at these sites: http://www.dimitriosvassilakis.com/     http://dimitrivassilakis.blogspot.gr/
 What are your best influences and memorable tour moments? 

Playing with Abdullah Ibrahim and with local musicians at the South African ghettos…
Touring with Isadora Duncan dancers, writing music for the ballet and performing at ancient Greek temples…Zinc/Smalls/Fat Cat breathing the New York morning air after the jam…
And my best influences :Chet Baker, Nina Simone, Sonny Rollins, John Coltrane, Joe Henderson, Miles Davis, Charlie Parker, Elvin Jones…that list is huge…from pop and rock The Beatles and John Lennon in particular, Dylan, Bowie, Ferry…from soul and R&B Smokey Robinson and all the Motown sound…

Are there really great differences between the musical conception of European jazz and US jazz? 

Jazz in the US is based on swing and tradition, which musicians enhance and develop. US scene is always the basic source of inspiration, jazz musicians have absorbed the history and the tradition of this art form and in a sense they are a living reference of the old jazz giants. In Europe, on the other hand, we got jazz movements and styles that embrace national idioms and blend different idiomatic styles. Jazz is one of the most democratic, ecumenical and global art forms which accept no borders.

169,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/departments/artist-profiles/flecktone-jeff-coffin-constant-change/,"Jeff Coffin Saxophonist Jeff Coffin has recorded with his Mu’tet band every few years since joining Béla Fleck and the Flecktones in 1997, and arranged solo touring dates around that quartet’s schedule. Such was the plan this year after the release of his stellar new CD, Mutopia (Compass). Then, you could say, he got into a jam.

Two weeks before Mutopia’s July release date, with gigs lined up, Coffin received a frantic call to sub for saxophonist LeRoi Moore with jam-band icons the Dave Matthews Band.

“LeRoi had a bad ATV accident,” Coffin says. “He’s thankfully expected to fully recover after breaking a lot of bones and puncturing a lung. I got the call on July 1, was onstage with them July 2, and I’ll be with them through October. I hope to tour in support of my new record after that. I had about 50 songs to chart out and learn with Dave and the guys on the fly, but it’s been fun.” (Ed. Note: Shortly before presstime, LeRoi Moore died in Los Angeles on Aug. 19 from sudden complications related to his accident.)

The same can be said of Mutopia, an intoxicating set of Coffin compositions that blends traces of New Orleans, Herbie Hancock’s Headhunters, Joe Henderson, Alice Coltrane, Lee Morgan, Miles Davis and world music. Coffin has always mutated his group’s sound by rotating influences and personnel, featuring musicians like Kirk Whalum, Chris Thile, Jeff Sipe, Chester Thompson, Fleck and fellow Flecktones Victor Wooten and Roy “Future Man” Wooten. “The name Mu’tet comes from mutation, so the concept is that the only constant is change,” Coffin says.

Banjoist Fleck appears on one track, the aptly titled, 7/8-timed “Bubble Up,” and bassist Victor Wooten cameos during dueling bass solos on the hypnotic “Al’s Greens.” What’s more important is whom he’s trading bass solos with: Mutopia also features Felix Pastorius, the 26-year-old son of the late bass icon Jaco.

“Victor recommended Felix,” Coffin says. “And I hired him on Vic’s recommendation without ever hearing him play. He’s a young artistic force, and I hope this record gives people more of a chance to hear him play. If they’re expecting the next Jaco, that’s absurd. He can play his father’s stuff, but he really has his own voice.”

Coffin’s core quartet is rounded out by the Flecktones’ electric SynthAxe drummer, Future Man (Victor’s brother), who impressively switches to acoustic drums throughout, and the ever-versatile Kofi Burbridge, who provides the glue on piano, Hammond and Wurlitzer organs, and flute.

“Kofi is magical,” Coffin says. “People who’ve heard him play with the Derek Trucks Band will hear him in a way they never have before here. It’s the same thing with Roy, who sounds stunning on this record. People who see him play his electric ‘drumitar’ ask me, ‘Can he really play the drums?’ And I say, ‘Of course he can. Where do you think all of that stuff he does comes from?'”

The Massachusetts-born Coffin, 43, studied music at the University of North Texas. Upon graduation in 1991, he moved to Nashville, where many assume he met Fleck, who also lives there.

“I actually met Béla at a Flecktones gig in Aspen, Colo., of all places,” Coffin says. “I’d been running a jam session in Nashville, and a drummer who knew Béla came through. He called him and said, ‘There’s this horn player in town that you don’t know about.’ I was playing in Colorado, too, so we talked, and did a bit of playing once we both got home. He asked me to sit in at a club in Nashville, and it just kind of went from there. Things clicked, and I do a lot of composing, which appealed to the group.”

The Flecktones have all taken time off to work on other projects in recent years. They opened two shows during Return to Forever’s 2008 reunion tour this summer, but will take most of 2009 off after upcoming concerts to support their forthcoming holiday CD.

“It’s called Jingle All the Way,” Coffin says. “It’s not Nat ‘King’ Cole’s holiday record, even though that’s one of my favorites! We have some throat singers, some Jewish tunes, a track with five Christmas carols going at the same time, and ‘The 12 Days of Christmas’ in 12 different keys and time signatures. I just got an e-mail from Vic saying, ‘I think this is one of our best records ever.'”

Coffin has an additional new, largely improvised CD with keyboardist Charlie Peacock, Arc of the Circle (Runway), in addition to his ongoing work as an in-demand clinician and educator.

“I do a lot of clinics as a Yamaha- and Vandoren-sponsored artist,” he says. “I also do some private teaching, and I’m an adjunct professor at Cumberland University, just outside of Nashville. I feel like I can reach young players pretty quickly and develop a rapport, mainly by having fun with them.” ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912203326.34/warc/CC-MAIN-20190324043400-20190324065400-00270.warc.gz
170,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/departments/artist-profiles/francisco-mela-free-jazz-latin/,"Francisco Mela Like many musicians, drummer Francisco Mela is impatient with categories, but he’s willing to pin down his mercurial concept as “free jazz Latin.” With his second album as a leader, Cirio: Live at the Blue Note, the New York-based Cuban native continues what he started on Melao, his acclaimed 2006 debut, leading an all-star quintet through new compositions that draw strength equally from modern jazz harmony and Afro-Cuban rhythmic DNA. “I never want to lose that,” says Mela of his Cuban birthright, which guides him even as he embraces the legacy of drummer-bandleader heroes such as Elvin Jones and Roy Haynes.

The fact that Mela staffed his group with some of the strongest personalities in jazz today-guitarist Lionel Loueke, tenor saxophonist Mark Turner, pianist Jason Moran, bassist Larry Grenadier-speaks volumes about his own self-confidence as a leader. The goal with Cirio was to assert his own identity while featuring his sidemen to the fullest; hence his decision to include trio vehicles like “Channel 2” (for Turner), the romantic “Maria” (for Moran), and the trickily syncopated “Benes” (aka “Benny’s Tune,” for Loueke) in addition to full-band numbers such as “Tierra and Fuego” and “Afro Son.”

“Trio is the perfect number to do interesting and experimental things in music,” Mela notes. “I didn’t want the sound of a full quintet the whole time. In this band everyone is a strong leader, and I know they do their best leading their own trios. So that was my strategy, to make them feel good. If you make people around you feel good, they’re going to appreciate it and play your music the way you want to hear it.”

That intuition serves Mela well in his own sideman work, including current stints with Kenny Barron and Joe Lovano. “Mela is a very important part of my new quintet US 5 because of his open, flowing approach,” Lovano says. In this two-drummer band, Mela faces the added challenge of facing off with Otis Brown III. “At the beginning we thought it would be a competition,” Mela offers, “but Lovano didn’t want that. He said, ‘Otis, you play with Mela; Mela, you play with Otis. Don’t play against, play together.’ So now we’re trying to sound like one drummer.” At presstime, the group is scheduled to play an engagement at the Village Vanguard in November, followed by studio time to record.

Mela’s humility is more than evident when he talks about Kenny Barron. “Kenny is my light-he’s the light that I needed, the light I’d been dreaming of. Every day I learn something. You listen to him play a ballad, you say, ‘Wow, I gotta get my brushes together, my ride cymbal, my comping.’ This guy’s calling me to play with him when I don’t know if I’m ready. And this is the beauty. I’m just trying to do what I can do the best way I can.”

On a gig like this, Mela has to draw on swing and Latin vocabulary while avoiding all pigeonholes, as he demonstrates on The Traveler, Barron’s latest Sunnyside release. “When people like me play, everybody says, ‘Oh, this is a Latin-jazz guy,'” Mela reflects. “But if I want to play with people like Joe and Kenny and John Scofield, I need to make clear that what I’m playing is not Latin, is not jazz, it’s something very free with all that in it.”

As for his own compositional voice, Mela focuses on exactly that-his voice. And given how he generates ideas by singing them first, it’s logical that singing has figured into Mela’s performances as well. There are haunting Yoruba vocal passages on “Parasuayo” from Melao, “Urick Mela” from Cirio and “Phantoms” from The Traveler. With encouragement from Anat Cohen, Mela also opted to sing a full song for the first time on record, a rendition of Silvio Rodriguez’s “Pequeña Serenata Diurna” that features Loueke to great effect. (Miguel Zenón ventured his own arrangement on 2001’s Looking Forward.) Here especially, one can appreciate the ties that bind Loueke and Mela, two players from different poles of the African Diaspora who use vocals to advance their take on jazz and ethnic heritage. The two plan to start a duo project.

There are strong personal currents everywhere in Mela’s music. In his liner notes he describes Cirio as not just a CD, but “a family object.” The title track, full of tonal ambiguity and episodic abstraction, is named for his late father. “Maria” is for his mother, “Urick Mela” for his newborn son. As the father of 12-year-old Yadan as well, Mela is no boy wonder-he turned 40 this year. One could mistake him for a man 10 years younger, at least. “I just keep smiling and dancing and playing music,” he says. “That’s my secret.” ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912205597.84/warc/CC-MAIN-20190326160044-20190326182044-00393.warc.gz
171,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/departments/artist-profiles/mary-halvorson-fractured-guitar/,"Mary Halvorson Trio (L to R): Ches Smith, John Hebert, Mary Halvorson Mary Halvorson’s music is best described as “slightly off.” Indeed, that’s how she herself describes it: “I would say about my compositional style, and I think it’s true for my guitar playing as well, that I like to have things that are slightly off. Chords that aren’t complete chaos, but also aren’t completely straight. I like unexpected twists, something that might make it a little unusual without being completely abstract.”

The Brooklyn-based, 28-year-old electric guitarist and composer’s résumé bears out her fondness for idiosyncrasy. Her unique playing style-brittle, knotty and abrasive-has earned attention in the avant-garde community and work with ensembles led by Anthony Braxton, Taylor Ho Bynum and Trevor Dunn. Halvorson also has two duos, the rock-oriented People with drummer Kevin Shea and an acoustic project with violist Jessica Pavone. In October she released her first recording as a leader, the bewildering Dragon’s Head (Firehouse 12), with her trio featuring bassist John Hébert and drummer Ches Smith.

It’s also the first recording on which all compositions are Halvorson’s. “I really wrote for these specific musicians,” she says. “It’s a project I’ve been thinking about for a long time but was waiting to figure out the right people. I’ve been playing with Ches in various projects for years, so he was an obvious choice, but then when I met John I sort of formed an idea in my head.” She learned Hébert’s sound not by playing with him, but by listening to him play live and on record. “I wrote the first six compositions on the album without ever having heard the band. Then we played a gig and worked out the rough edges, and I wrote the rest of pieces after I knew what the band sounded like.”

If this seems a roundabout path to organizing and composing for a band, Halvorson’s development as a musician was similarly roundabout. A native of Brookline, Mass., she began playing the violin as a child, but switched to guitar in the eighth grade when she discovered Jimi Hendrix. “I went out and bought a black-and-white Stratocaster so I could be like Jimi,” Halvorson says. “Then I got a Hendrix tablature book. Before I played or took any lessons I’d learned how to play a bunch of his songs. That was my first introduction to guitar.”

The switch to jazz came because her first instructor happened to be a jazz player, and because Halvorson coincidentally discovered her father’s record collection at the same time. “Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Thelonious Monk; those were the things my dad had,” she says. “And then I got into Dolphy, Mingus and Ornette. Then I went on to Wesleyan University and met Anthony Braxton.” Ironically, though she would later study with Joe Morris and be influenced by Derek Bailey and Sonny Sharrock, none of the music that turned her toward jazz guitar was, in fact, jazz guitar.

Though she began performing within the small arts scene around Wesleyan in Middletown, Conn., it wasn’t until 2002, when she began studying at the New School in New York, that Halvorson really found her voice. “I figured out a lot, just by figuring out what I didn’t want to do,” she explains. “I realized pretty quickly that I didn’t want to play straightahead jazz. So in response to that I was able to figure out what I did want to do.” She soon began playing in a trio with drummer Mike Pride, and in 2004 joined Braxton’s 12+1tet, in which she still plays today.

Despite the formative influence of cerebral, deliberate composers like Braxton and Eric Dolphy, Halvorson describes her approach as intuitive. “If I start to overthink things, they don’t work,” she says. “I usually don’t think of larger forms first; I kind of write as I go. I’ll start and just keep going. But I don’t necessarily have an overarching structure in mind. I might, but I usually don’t.” The results are dynamic, dissonant labyrinths such as Dragon’s Head’s “Sank Silver Purple White” and “Old Nine Two Six Four Two Dies.” The unusual titles are another extension of Halverson’s intuition: “I just numbered them initially, but wanted to give them actual titles,” she explains. “So I started scribbling stuff down as I was falling asleep-whatever nonsense popped into my head. I didn’t think too much about the meaning. I’m sure there is one, but I don’t know what it is.”

If she composes on instinct, though, Halvorson’s compositions are also geared toward the musical instincts of her bandmates, Smith and Hébert. “They’re both amazing musicians,” she says. “We know each other’s music and playing styles pretty well. I think I would have to try pretty hard to make something they couldn’t follow.” Sometimes, it seems, being slightly off is right on the money.

Mavis “Swan” Poole: I don’t have the standard story. I wasn’t a singer that knew I could sing for a long time. I sang for years in a choir as a background singer. When I was a teenager, I had a friend who told me that I actually had a nice voice and that Sunday, they called me to the front of the church and made me sing in front of everyone. The reaction is what kind of showed me that is probably what I should pursue.

So you have a background in gospel music? 

Oh yes, born and raised in singing in the church. That was pretty much what I did and I eventually branched out into R&B and other styles of music, added on jazz at 21 as an undergrad. I actually started out for a few years as a psychology major and added on music while I was in school. I got my bachelors in music education and also vocal jazz studies. Not long ago, I graduated from Queens [College] with my masters in vocal jazz performance.

In addition to that, my mother was the biggest influence for me in music. She’s not a professional singer but she just has an amazing voice. I always heard beautiful music in my house with her singing in the kitchen on Sunday mornings. That was a big part of what affected me, or infected me, with music. My father’s also heavily into music. I’ve also been blessed to be in the church where there was always music. That opened me up to want to be a part of it, even as a background singer.

With your background in both the church and your jazz education, does your training give you the freedom to move around within the different genres of music? 

Definitely. The good thing about church was that a lot of things were impromptu. So it wasn’t always planned out. Some things you had to “fake it until you make it.” Sometimes you had to sing and you didn’t know it [until] the day before you found out that you had to sing, so always being ready definitely helped. And the training from being in school gave me the technical part and the vocabulary as far as dealing with Bill Lee and others in the jazz world. They both definitely prepared me for going between the borders and working within the different genres.

I first discovered you last summer on Soul Cycle’s fusion album Flipped, where you did this wonderful cover of Michael Jackson’s “I Can’t Help It.” Your vocals really captured the hauntingly beautiful melody of the song. Did you choose to cover that particular song on the album? 

Jesse [Fischer] actually asked me to do that particular song. He sent me the music and what he had in mind with the arrangement of it and I just spent a little time with it. We did a couple of takes in the studio and that was pretty much the birth of it.

You really made the song yours, so much so that it didn’t feel like a cover at all. 

I try to treat every song like that. I have to find myself in anything that I’m singing in order for me to let it come out of me. I have to be able to relate to it. Obviously, most Michael Jackson songs are classics anyway, but that particular one was one that I definitely enjoyed singing and had heard for so long. So it was kind of easy to put myself into it because it was a part of what I listened to coming up and part of my music collection.

In addition to the church and your family, who are some of your other musical influences? 

The Clark Sisters-definitely love Karen Clark. Donny Hathaway, Stevie Wonder, Michael, of course, Ella, Sarah and Mavis Staples, whom I was named after.

We now know that you were named after the great Mavis Staples, but where did the name “Swan” come from? 

I was sitting at the computer one day and I was definitely considering a stage name. I have been looking through different things and this Clip Art picture of a swan kept popping up on my computer. I kept closing it out and every time I would close it out, it continued to pop back up. After a while of it frustrating me, I picked up a dictionary and I saw that it was obviously within the bird family. (Laughs) But it also said that Mozart was considered the “swan” of classical music. That kind of caught me, so maybe there’s a reason that this thing kept popping up. And eventually, I just stuck it in the middle and became Mavis “Swan” Poole.

As a vocalist, how do you feel being compared to other jazz/non-jazz vocalists? 

I can’t say that it really bothers me. I just know that it wasn’t a thing that I patterned myself after anyone necessarily. I think people may hear [Erykah] Badu in just the timbre, but not in my approach to music or singing. It doesn’t bother me because I’m still who I am and people hear who they hear. I just try to create music that comes from within me the way that I hear it.

Well, there’s definitely a physical resemblance between you and one of my favorite jazz vocalists, the late Abbey Lincoln. Has anyone ever told you that before? 

Wow, I have never heard of the physical resemblance. I’m definitely not mad at that because I love me some Abbey! It’s funny because I did a performance in Detroit with Jeff “Tain” Watts, Geri Allen and Nicholas Payton. We did a tribute to Abbey but we didn’t get to do everything that we wanted to do. We really wanted do “Driva’ Man” from the Freedom Now Suite. She was one of those people who struck a nerve with me, but in a very good way-her life, her music. She changed how I looked at music, so I am honored by the comparison.

Are there any musicians that you would like to collaborate with? 

A large part of the people that I’d like to work with have already passed away, like I’m especially in love with Coltrane and Nina Simone, I would have loved to just watch her. I’ve been blessed to work with a lot of the people that I’ve wanted to work with. But I know that there’s more out there.

More artists that we probably haven’t even heard from yet. 

And to me, some of my true favorite singers are the ones that the world doesn’t know about. I’ve heard homeless people who have blown my mind, just standing outside singing and it brings you to tears. Some of the greatest people I know are names that the world may never know for whatever reason.

173,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/departments/artist-profiles/maysa-incognito-no-more/,"Maysa They call her Maysa. Just Maysa. And for the past 20 years, this smooth jazz vocalist with the deep soothing tone has enjoyed a storybook career just shy of that Prince Charming ending. She was a member of the world renowned Morgan State University Choir under the direction of the late great Nathan Carter during her college years complete with travel abroad, television appearances, and best selling recordings. Within weeks of graduating, she became a part of Stevie Wonder’s backup ensemble, Wonderlove. (Ask her about riding in a car with Stevie driving). And a few years after musically supporting the “musical genius,” she was auditioned by telephone for lead voice in the British soul collective, Incognito. Hired on the spot, she was on a plane, $10 in her pocket, to record with the band in London within the week. The first single with the new vocalist, “Don’t You Worry ‘Bout a Thing” in 1992, gave Maysa immediate international recognition. She was 26.

Today, 20 years and 16 group and eight solo CDs later, Maysa (whose last name is Leak) looks back on a full and accomplished career full of international tours, major television appearances, national awards, positive reviews, chart topping movie soundtracks and personal recordings, and musical collaborations with some of the best jazz and R&B musicians in the industry such as Stevie Wonder, Will Downing, Rick Braun, Kim Waters, Gerald Veasley and Jonathan Butler. Usually categorized as smooth jazz, other descriptions from soul, neo soul, R&B, funk, funk/jazz, jazz, jazz fusion and many others have been attached to her as well. Her latest CD, released the end of January 2010, Woman in Love, has climbed the charts steadily, and even gained her notice by mainstream jazz critics. With selections like “What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life,” ” ‘Round Midnight” and “When I Fall in Love” featured, she demonstrates her full bodied contralto can respectfully handle a classic or put a down home spin on it. But despite it all, it’s not quite the glass slipper…

“I love my life. It’s what I always wanted to do. After 20 years, here I am and I’m so grateful. The one thing I always prayed for, and God gave me, has been longevity,” says Maysa.

Quite an accomplishment for an artist who has guided much of her career on her own–no management company, no agent. Maysa has and continues to book and promote herself still living in her hometown of Baltimore. Turned off by the Los Angeles scene early on, she realized she wasn’t effective amongst those that schmooze their way into opportunities. Her plan–let her talent speak for itself.

“I lived in LA for about 10 months…oh no,” she laughs. “Not for me. I don’t talk much so it was hard trying to promote myself in that way. I just started managing myself and that worked.” She pauses. “Sometimes though, I do think I should be further along in my career by now.”

In December of last year, the critical buzz of Woman in Love had Grammy speak surrounding it. The anticipated nomination didn’t materialize but a Soul Train Music Award did. Maysa flew to Atlanta for the glitzy televised ceremony to be fabulous in her evening gown on the red carpet. She won, however, once back home with award in hand, she saw no photos, no press to announce the recognition.

“Winning the award was great but it made me realize that maybe the time has come to get some help in the publicity department. I hired a company after that so we’ll see what comes from it.”

Yet, without the extensive promotion machine during the first 20 years, Maysa has been able to gain an extensive and loyal audience, an audience that has traveled her life journey with her through her songs both professionally and personally. Today, they’re following her regularly on Facebook and Twitter. Similar to other one name persons of note, Maysa has become somewhat of an “every woman” in music, someone with whom female listeners identify, see themselves in and male listeners respect and often empathize. When she covers a tune, it’s something familiar and her audiences connect. When she writes, her lyrics speak of her experiences but reflect on their lives. When she sings, her voice expresses her emotions but gives sound to what’s in their hearts. Her live performances are like family reunions with audiences returning time and time again to see their friend and confidant. Audience members feel comfortable calling out songs from her past CDs, hits or not, current or from years gone by as requests. There’s talk from the stage between selections of old boyfriends, broken hearts, new loves, extra pounds, single parenting…. Maysa fans have seen her through a lot.

She’s in her element in live settings, moving from musical style to musical style, classics to originals, past to present, always in elegant flowing gowns and high heels eventually kicked to the side. In a recent Valentine Day’s concert in Baltimore, at the tail end of a record blizzard, a capacity audience pressed its way to hear the local diva. Her special spot and soon to be monthly performance home, the Eubie Blake National Jazz Institute and Cultural Center is run by her best friend from college and current tour manager Troy Burton. Her frequent presence and support of The Center has helped Troy promote jazz in the city and encourage young people not only to listen to the music but in performing it. Maysa is proud that her multi faceted sound sometimes helps youngsters make a musical connection and appreciate more straight ahead jazz. But for those in attendance Valentine’s night, she delivered, as always, with impeccable tone, surprising scats, moving renditions and quality musical back up–showing what 20 years of honing a skill and loving one’s craft can do.

Inspired by her recent industry recognitions, Maysa is ready to kick the remainder of her career in high gear. Thoughts of a new CD are already in her plans and with new and professional management assistance, her motivation for that Prince Charming ending-personally and professionally-in sight.

“When I was young, I used to listen to the greats, Sarah and Ella and want to talk to them, ask them questions. I promised myself early that if I ever made it in this industry, I would be approachable, an open spirit. I love what I do and as a friend told me recently, just let the audience come to you.” ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912203991.44/warc/CC-MAIN-20190325133117-20190325155117-00339.warc.gz

 Five years ago, soon after the release of Sonic Trance (Warner Bros.), trumpeter Nicholas Payton vowed never to record the same way again. He drew a line in the proverbial sand, marking a break from his critically acclaimed string of acoustic postbop discs for Verve as he embarked on riskier, decidedly more electric- and groove-funk-focused material.

It was a move than surely irked many fans, who viewed Payton as one of the last of his generation, steadfastly carrying the jazz tradition torch rather than attempting to incorporate modern touches of hip-hop, electronica, rock and pop. “When we put the record out, it was one of those things where either people loved it or they hated it,” he recalls. “A lot of people who were fans of my earlier work didn’t like it. But I also gained a new audience. So I learned a lot, not only musically, but also about being strong in the face of criticism. I’d never been criticized to that degree.”

Not all of the negative criticism rose from the instrumentation, though. Much of it concerned the material itself, and Payton admits it wasn’t his strongest. “I didn’t have tunes after the end of the Sonic Trance sessions. I had five days’ worth of music but no tunes. It was really stuff in a post-production atmosphere,” he says, comparing his process to someone trying to make a film out of non-sequitur footage. Indeed, as titillating and adventurous as Sonic Trance is, its parts are greater than its sum, a disadvantage that revealed itself on the bandstand. “Complete freedom is at times more restrictive than if we had some rules or guidelines. We had to really listen and be focused and make something happen out of thin air on every tune. Sometimes it would be beautiful; other times it would be a major disappointment.”

Payton soon realized that he needed to go back to the drawing board after two years of supporting Sonic Trance. In a way, he had to eat crow, because he did return to the acoustic, more straightahead setting, playing standards and some originals. He formed a quintet, then a quartet, featuring guitar, in which he would double on trumpet and piano. It was with his guitar-featured quartet that he decided he wanted to go back to the Sonic Trance vibe, but this time, with a slightly different approach, resulting in Payton’s newest disc, Into the Blue (Nonesuch), a comparatively more fulfilling outing wherein he superbly teeters between the world of electric and acoustic. “This new record is sort like the middle ground between the two extremes,” he explains. “I’ve found a way, a sound, and an instrumentation to be able to play all of the things without any sacrifices.”

Into the Blue certainly rewards with each repeated listen as Payton’s lustrous trumpet improvisations glide over Kevin Hays’ gleaming Fender Rhodes and shuffling, pneumatic rhythmic bed, concocted by bassist Vicente Archer, drummer Marcus Gilmore and Daniel Sadownick on the celestial “Let It Ride,” the mysterious, sometimes go-go-fueled “Triptych,” the pulsating Afro-Latin groover “The Charleston Hop (The Blue Steps)” and the Crescent City-flavored “Fleur De Lis.”  Even though Payton economizes his melodic improvisations and emphasizes groove more than swing, his tunes leave more lasting impressions than those on Sonic Trance. “All the melodies have very small ranges of notes and are singable and danceable but not very aggressive; I wanted everything to be very beautiful, melancholy and have the feeling of beauty,” Payton explains.

Produced by Bob Belden, Into the Blue documents the first time Payton has recorded a solo album in his native town of New Orleans. “All of my previous records were done in New York, because I didn’t want the temptations and distractions of home to interfere with my creative process. I wanted to be in an environment where I could only focus on music. With this music, I was going for a different thing. It was more important for me to be here, in an environment where I was more comfortable. I wanted the music to reflect that feeling of comfort,” Payton says.

Into the Blue also marks Payton’s first solo recording after surviving a car accident in 2006, which prompted rumors that he wouldn’t be able to play trumpet again. He says he never heard those rumors but confirms that the accident did affect his playing and that he took six months off due to embouchure problems. “Trumpeters tend to have the least longevity in terms of careers,” he says, citing the common knowledge that the trumpet tends to be the most demanding of jazz instruments. “Rarely do you find guys like Doc Cheatham or Clark Terry, who are able to sustain a career for that length of a period. The trumpet is also a very unforgiving instrument. Every trumpeter has to re-evaluate the way they play. Master trumpeters like Wynton Marsalis, Louis Armstrong, Dizzy Gillespie and Miles Davis all have had to re-address how they dealt with the instrument.”

Payton worked with various teachers to re-develop his chops back into shape, taking bits of advice from all of them to arrive at his own conclusion as to how best approach the trumpet. “This record is sort of coming out of that-not being able to play for about six months,” he says. “This point in my life, I’ve tried to interpret struggle and conflict as a means for me to get to the next wstage of development. Oftentimes we can’t go to the next phase unless we overcome a death of some sort. Life is always like that. This record is about that-a new way of approaching music with my instrument and my life.” ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202496.35/warc/CC-MAIN-20190321051516-20190321073516-00315.warc.gz
175,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/departments/artist-profiles/ruth-naomi-floyd-jazz-mass/,"On Root to the Fruit, her fifth recording for the Philadelphia-based Contour label, vocalist Ruth Naomi Floyd artfully blends Christian theology and jazz with the help of a world-class ensemble including the great flutist James Newton, tenor saxophonist Gary Thomas, drummer Ralph Peterson and pianist James Weidman, who also produced the session. Floyd’s unique repertoire ranges from soulful, strikingly original interpretations of traditional African-American spirituals like “Oh, Freedom” and “Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child” to stirring originals strewn with biblical references like “The Bottle of Tears” and “Open the Door to Him” to dramatic renditions of Randy Weston’s “Where?,” Mary Lou Williams’ “Act of Contrition” and Antonín Dvoržák’s “God Is My Shepherd.”

“I grew up with gospel music and absolutely love traditional gospel music,” says Ruth, “but I also just love this idea where someone takes a piece of music and they bring their own experience and expression and gifts to it. And jazz is a brilliant way of doing that.”

Through the courage of her convictions, Floyd is presenting a true jazz expression of her Christian faith on this bold outing, delivering the Holy Scriptures while embracing the all-important elements of swing and improvisation. The two separate rhythm tandems here swing forcefully throughout while the material is imbued with lots of provocative stretching by the principal soloists Thomas and Newton, whose brilliant solo on Floyd’s swinging 3/4 vehicle “Mere Breath” is one of the instrumental highlights.

Her beautiful, soulful voice comes across like a hush on the sparse opener, a 12/8 rendition of the African-American spiritual “No Hiding Place,” accompanied only by Ron Howerton’s congas. Weidman’s ambitious arrangement of another African-American spiritual, “Oh, Freedom,” is a high point of the session. Opening in stark fashion with Ruth’s voice accompanied only by Tyrone Brown’s upright bass, the piece evolves into a harmolodic whirlwind with Newton, Thomas, Weidman and drummer Mark Prince improvising simultaneously in provocative, freewheeling fashion. After building to a dissonant crescendo, the piece resolves to an uptempo swing section that Newton burns over with remarkable fluency before Thomas enters with his signature in-out lines cascading over a swinging pulse provided by Prince and Brown. Shifting gears, it moves into a soulful ballad section that Weidman solos over with tasteful lyricism before Floyd returns to sing the chilling refrain: “And before I’ll be a slave I’ll be buried in my grave and go home to my Lord and be free.”

Newton’s flute serves as a second voice to Floyd’s own soaring soprano on a calming rendition of Dvoržák’s “God Is My Shepherd” while Thomas’ edgy tenor voice shadows Ruth’s own on her swinging original “Mercy,” which builds in intensity over nine minutes. Newton also shines on the moving closer, “Goodbye for Now,” which Ruth wrote in loving memory of her maternal grandmother, Lois Olga Goldman Andersen.

“When you look at the historical roots of jazz, it really comes from African-American spirituals,” says Floyd. “So for me it’s such a powerful root, and when you look at the fruit that it produced over the many years and decades, from blues and gospel to jazz, it’s just amazing. So for me it just made sense to do a recording that was steeped in jazz improvisation but still profoundly connected to its root, which is the African-American spirituals.”

As the Reverend Dr. John Nunes states in his accompanying essay to Root to the Fruit: “Those who care deeply about theology often debate and deliberate over questions of what’s best and proper for Christian music. They inquire about what styles can carry sacred texts. After listening with ears wide open, I’m personally led to conclude that jazz may be the optimum creative form for proclaiming the unchanging Truth of God’s Word. Praise God for giving us jazz and Ruth Naomi Floyd.” ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912203991.44/warc/CC-MAIN-20190325133117-20190325155117-00063.warc.gz
176,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/departments/artist-profiles/tim-ries-not-only-rock-n-roll/,"Tim Ries Saxophonist Tim Ries turned some heads back in 2005 with The Rolling Stones Project, which featured jazzy interpretations of Stones staples like “Satisfaction,” “Gimme Shelter,” “Street Fighting Man” and a greasy organ trio rendition of “Honky Tonk Women” with Larry Goldings on Hammond B3 and the Stones’ Charlie Watts himself on drums. Some hardcore jazz folks were startled, but who better to interpret those familiar tunes than a member of the Stones’ horn section?

A graduate of North Texas State and a former member of the Maynard Ferguson Big Band, as well as a participant in large ensemble recordings by Joe Henderson, Bob Belden, Dave Liebman and Maria Schneider, Ries had already distinguished himself as an accomplished composer and distinctive soloist on both tenor and soprano saxes before getting the call 10 years ago from Mick and the boys to join “The World’s Greatest Rock ‘n’ Roll Band” on tour. “It really came out of the blue,” Ries recalls. “I knew the guys in the Stones’ horn section-trombonist Mike Davis, trumpeter Kent Smith and saxophonist Andy Snitzer. At some point Andy decided to leave the band and go out with Paul Simon. So they called me and I said yes.”

Ries flew to San Francisco for his first rehearsal with the Stones, and he came prepared. “I actually made myself a little Real Book of 80 Stones tunes,” he recalls. “I wrote the charts out and then shrunk it down to a little pocket-size Real Book that I carried with me to the audition.”

Needless to say, he passed with flying colors. “At some point as we were playing, Keith Richards came over to me and said, ‘Can’t you at least make one mistake like the rest of us!’ And I knew then that I had the gig.”

On his superb 1999 septet outing for the Criss Cross label, Alternate Side, Ries hinted at things to come with a jazzy interpretation of the Jagger-Richards tune “Moonlight Mile.” The Rolling Stones Project, recorded with a core group of drummer Brian Blade, guitarist Ben Monder, bassist John Patitucci and pianist Bill Charlap, along with such special guests as John Scofield, Bill Frisell, Norah Jones, Sheryl Crow and fellow Stones Watts, Richards and Ronnie Wood, was a fully realized concept that met with much acclaim. Now Ries takes it up a few notches with his wildly ambitious followup, Stones World: The Rolling Stones Project II. A massive undertaking involving 72 musicians recorded in 10 different countries, it’s a world music extravaganza that took Ries two years to complete. “The first one was fairly simple. This second one, on the other hand, was fairly exhausting and heavily funded by my children’s college education.”

Essentially recorded on off-days during the Stones’ A Bigger Bang world tour, this adventurous two-CD set (recorded for Ries’ own Tames Music Group and licensed to the Sunnyside label) features an array of musicians from around the world recording on their home turf, including Portuguese fado singer Ana Moura (“No Expectations,” “Brown Sugar”), Japanese vocalist Minako Yoshida and guitarist Kazumi Watanabe (“Baby Break It Down”) and the North African Tuareg band Tidawt (“Hey Negrita”). Stones drummer Charlie Watts appears on a lightly swinging jazz-waltz rendition of “Miss You” recorded in Paris; Richards provides his signature guitar licks on a soulful rendition of “Baby Break It Down” recorded in Tokyo; and Mick Jagger blows some mean blues harp alongside Ronnie Wood’s lap-steel guitar work on the entrancing “Hey Negrita.”

Salsa pioneer Eddie Palmieri appears with his band on a churning Latin-jazz rendition of “Under My Thumb,” Indian tabla master Badal Roy underscores the 15/8 groove on “Angie,” and a rousing flamenco version of “Jumpin’ Jack Flash,” charged with Spanish guitars, singers and dancers and underscored with cajon and palmas, was filmed in the studio and is viewable on a second enhanced CD.

The globetrotting continued in Rio de Janeiro, where Ries recorded a soaring 6/8 version of “Lady Jane” with Brazilian music icon Milton Nascimento. Back home in New York, he presided over a radical reinvention of “You Can’t Always Get What You Want” that is fueled by Jack DeJohnette’s drumming and tweaked by Bill Frisell’s atmospheric guitar work. And “Salt of the Earth,” sung in seven languages by vocalists from Mexico, Israel and Germany, features a cameo appearance in the choir by Tim’s 12-year-old daughter Jasia.

Says the saxophonist of the strong world music direction taken on Stones World, “I’ve been listening to flamenco and fado and Brazilian music for 30 years. This is stuff that I love and listen to at home all the time. And being out on the road with the Stones gave me the opportunity to find this music and record it where it lives indigenously. Luckily, most of the time, the musicians that I sought out in each city were able to do it. And pretty much every time it was a first take.”

Maybe Ries can always get what he wants. ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912203991.44/warc/CC-MAIN-20190325133117-20190325155117-00377.warc.gz

Little Girl Blue (Bethlehem, 1958)
Tootie Heath took the influence of Kenny Clarke and spread it to other kinds of black music besides straight-ahead jazz. His brushwork here shows remarkable depth for a 22-year-old, and his naturally undulating pulse helped some of these tracks become Simone’s biggest hits.

WES MONTGOMERY
The Incredible Jazz Guitar of Wes Montgomery (Riverside, 1960)
This wasn’t a working band, just a thrown-together assemblage for a record date, but many consider this to be the greatest jazz guitar LP ever made. Brothers Percy and Tootie Heath provide an immaculate rhythmic carpet.

THE BOBBY TIMMONS TRIO
In Person (Riverside, 1962)
This marvelous trio with Ron Carter had tight arrangements and smooth rhythm. The band is kind of like a funkier version of the classic Ahmad Jamal Trio with Israel Crosby and Vernel Fournier: Indeed, Tootie knew Fournier personally and credits him as an important influence.

KENNY DORHAM
Trompeta Toccata (Blue Note, 1965)
On Dorham’s last album as a leader-and one of his best-four long tracks with diverse feels give Tootie plenty to do. Tootie was almost the house drummer for Riverside, which may be why he isn’t on as many Blue Note LPs. At any rate, it’s nice to hear Rudy Van Gelder’s touch on the drum sound here.

CLIFFORD JORDAN
These Are My Roots: Clifford Jordan Plays Leadbelly
(Atlantic, 1965)
Tootie is heard giving his unique weight to a variety of folkloric beats, including an early appearance of his virtuosic tambourine. Jordan and Tootie both loved the old music and loved to experiment. They can change from being tricksters to intoning the deepest blues in a single phrase.

CHARLES MCPHERSON
Bebop Revisited!  (Prestige, 1965)
A great record that should be much better known, with Detroiters McPherson and Barry Harris partnering with Tootie, newcomer Carmell Jones and bassist Nelson Boyd for playful yet deadly serious bop.

SONNY ROLLINS
In Denmark I (Moon, 1992)
A bootleg, yes, but what a bootleg: the longest, most ferocious “Four” ever recorded, with Kenny Drew and Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen in 1968. Tootie kicks the Colossus along for over 40 minutes, neither giving the other any quarter.

HERBIE HANCOCK
The Prisoner  (Blue Note, 1969)
Tootie preceded Billy Hart in Herbie’s first working band, a sextet. All three Hancock/Heath discs are great, but The Prisoner may be the best, with some of Hancock’s most intricate writing, marvelous Tootie/Buster Williams interaction and Joe Henderson solos that are simply outrageous.

CLIFFORD JORDAN QUARTET
Half Note (SteepleChase, 1974)
A rough-and-tumble live date from 1974, when down-the-middle music like this was going out of fashion. With Cedar Walton and Sam Jones, Tootie shows he is among the elite New York drummers like Billy Higgins and Louis Hayes.

ALBERT “TOOTIE” HEATH
The Offering (Daddy Jazz, 1998)
Tootie’s own albums include a few group efforts with peers, several with his brothers and now Tootie’s Tempo. The neglected gem of the bunch is this ultra-rare solo album, a dedication to his late son, Mtume Patrick Heath. In the liner notes, Scot Ngozi-Brown explains: “For Heath, Mtume’s death is a source of meditative reflection on life’s complexity and brevity.” ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912206677.94/warc/CC-MAIN-20190326220507-20190327002507-00023.warc.gz
179,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/departments/artistchoice/artists-choice-avishai-cohen-on-egoless-performances/,"Ornette Coleman At concerts or jam sessions, I always like witnessing moments in which generosity suddenly rises to the surface and you experience an egoless musical act: someone skipping his or her own solo if the tune feels too long, a more experienced musician encouraging a younger player to solo first, or a musician truly serving the music with his or her playing, to name a few examples.

You can also hear egoless moments on recordings. In this list I’ve chosen artists-some of the great masters of this music as well as younger musicians-who represent the meaning of egoless playing for me. These are artists who, when I listen to them or play with them, make me feel immediately that their playing only exists to support the whole creation, to be part of the bigger picture.

Ornette Coleman
“Street Woman”
Science Fiction (Columbia, 1972)
Ornette, founder of free jazz, is indeed free, in the deepest sense of the word. In all of Ornette’s music you can feel the truth right away, the truth behind every note. This feeling bursts out of the music and proves that there is something bigger than the musicians themselves. On this track, I love how the melody starts right away with a sense of urgency, as if the world depends on it. As in many of Ornette’s tunes, the melody is over in less than 30 seconds, then Ornette dives straight into his solo. He’s playing from the gut, screaming out his story, yet he manages to be very bluesy, melodic and clear.

Third World Love 
“So”
(Yonathan Avishai, piano)
New Blues (Anzic, 2008)
Growing up with Yonathan Avishai, I can testify that his search for the truth was evident even at the age of 12. When he plays you can feel his patience and his admirable ability to play nothing but what the music calls for. On this track you can hear right away Yonathan’s affection for Duke Ellington. His solos always tell a story, and he isn’t afraid to be simple-very simple, in fact, as his chorus almost starts like a children’s song. The motivic development is beautiful, and within the heaviness of his self-restrictions he still manages to stay humorous, tuneful and soulful.

Jason Moran
“Kinda Dukish”
(Nasheet Waits, drums)
Black Stars (Blue Note, 2001)
Playing with Nasheet Waits over the years, I’ve found a musician who is connected to his truth at the highest levels. Every cymbal stroke is part of the big picture; every sound he makes is connected to the previous one, and to the next one. I’ve never heard Nasheet play any phrase that called attention to his chops. It’s always about the music. Starting with the drum solo, it feels as if he brings the music from a different world, as if it was there all the time and he just played it. This track is a great example of how seamless Nasheet’s playing is, switching quickly throughout the song between the open sections, the groove of the melody and the swinging parts. At no point do you hear the “brain”; rather, it’s all very intuitive and organic.

Billie Holiday
“I’ll Be Seeing You”
(Commodore, 1944)
For me, Billie Holiday is the ultimate example of singing nothing but the truth. You don’t hear thoughts, you don’t hear clichés and you definitely don’t hear ego. On this track, I love how, from the very first phrase until the last, each and every word is treated as if that’s the whole song. Just to hear her sing the words “café” or “wishing well” kills me. Singing at such a slow tempo must be quite difficult, but Lady Day makes it sound completely effortless.

Herbie Hancock
“Maiden Voyage”
(George Coleman, tenor saxophone)
Maiden Voyage (Blue Note, 1965)
My old teacher, the great Phil Wilson, used to say, “If you can’t tell your story in one chorus, you definitely can’t tell it in more than that.” I sometimes take this challenge and try this approach in my performances, only to find out yet again how hard it is. It always feels as if there’s more to say, and it takes humility to just “leave it at that.” I’ve been listening to Herbie’s Maiden Voyage a lot lately, and this solo by George Coleman gets me every time. Right away, from the brilliant opening statement, there’s a sense of patience about it, even though Coleman doesn’t necessarily hold back. Toward the end of the chorus you can definitely imagine him taking another chorus, but he goes to the final phrase, almost like he does it on purpose, sort of against the music, just to make a point.
 Avishai Cohen is a trumpeter and composer whose next album, Dark Nights, the third by his Triveni project featuring bassist Omer Avital and drummer Nasheet Waits, will be released in November on Anzic Records.

 Thad Jones is widely recognized for his writing and arranging, but he’s seldom given his due as a small-group soloist. If you ask a jazz musician to name a Thad Jones solo, they’ll probably point to the “Pop Goes the Weasel” quote on Count Basie’s “April In Paris.” After that, many would be at a loss. Jones was a terrific instrumentalist (he played lead with Basie on a few tunes, on cornet!) and one of the most creative soloists I’ve ever heard, recorded or live. Thad told me that ideas were there to be developed, just like they would be if you gave a speech. He influenced many, of course, and his playing and advice was what helped me learn to play as I spoke and to be myself.  All the examples I’ve chosen here are from LPs I’ve owned for many years. I’m sure many are available on CD, but if not, at least you’ll know what vinyl to look for. There’s lots of great stuff on Blue Note, also.

The Thad Jones/Mel Lewis Quartet
“BUT NOT FOR ME”    
The Thad Jones Mel Lewis Quartet (Artist House, 1978)
This is a live recording of a quartet Thad loved to play with. With pianist Harold Danko and Rufus Reid on bass he felt free to play anything at any time, and did. Where do I begin? Thad’s opening statement of the melody is stunning and the way he builds his solo off of it is absolutely fascinating. Especially great, however, is the surreal, march-like vibe he gets into before the out head.

Dexter Gordon
“TANGERINE”    
Tangerine (Prestige, 1975)
This solo is an example of Thad’s unpredictable phrasing and ability to obscure the underlying meter with the rhythms of his line. He even works in a quote from “I’ll Never Be the Same” in a way that seems totally natural.

Dexter Gordon
“AUGUST BLUES”    
Tangerine (Prestige, 1975)
If you want an example that captures Thad’s inventiveness and unique approach to harmony and line, this would be it. It’s a blues, but he plays it like a free-form poem. You can hear that Thad was a proponent of “three and out”… you play an idea three times, then move on. If you play it more than three, be prepared to play it, like, 17 times.

Bob Brookmeyer
“SWEET AND LOVELY”    
Back Again (Sonet, 1978)
Here Thad is combining lines of amazing speed and facility with slower sequences and melodies that exist for their own sake and don’t necessarily relate to the underlying harmony. The thing is, Thad actually heard that stuff in accurate detail.

Bob Brookmeyer 
“YOU’D BE SO NICE TO COME HOME TO”    
Back Again  (Sonet, 1978)
It’s only a couple of choruses, but Thad’s solo begins with some stop-time that he really turns into something interesting. Throughout the rest of the solo his lines are, again, truly remarkable and harmonically oblique, to say the least.

Thad Jones/Pepper Adams Quintet 
“CHANT”    
Mean What You Say (Milestone, 1966)
This is a nice Duke Pearson tune that Thad seems to like. The outstanding thing here is how he disguises the time at the beginning of his solo.

Thad Jones/Pepper Adams Quintet 
“WIVES AND LOVERS”    
Mean What You Say (Milestone, 1966)
I like this track because a) you get to hear Thad’s rhythmic approach to an up-tempo ¾ tune, b) the tune is by Burt Bacharach and Thad is playing it in 1966 and c) I’ve always liked playing on this tune myself. Tell no one.

Sonny Rollins & Thad Jones
“I GOT IT THAD”
Sonny Rollins & Thad Jones (Phoenix10, orig. rec. 1956) [this LP did not feature Sonny and Thad together, but was a compilation of two unrelated dates]
This is a slow blues from 1956, which is interesting for a lot of reasons. The first is that Thad is already straining to overcome the confines of the rhythm and harmony of the era, and yet he is paired with Jo Jones, who brings a decidedly swing-era vibe to the proceedings, especially in his fills. Another reason is that, when compared with the other trumpet players playing in 1956, Thad’s soloing is full of the kind of mordant phrasing that Miles was just getting to. I’ve always thought it would be great to know how much Thad really influenced Miles. For his part, Thad said simply, “Everybody influences everybody.” I have my own opinions.

181,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/departments/artistchoice/artists-choice-jason-miles-on-electric-keyboards/,"Jason Miles Growing up in Brooklyn I started early, playing the accordion at 7 and then switching to piano at 11. It didn’t take long before I discovered the organ. Players like Jimmy Smith and Groove Holmes really influenced me. I played the organ in a variety of bands during that period. However, it wasn’t until I heard the sound of the Wurlitzer and Fender Rhodes electric pianos that my path in music started to get defined. Here are some seminal cuts that had a major effect on my musical life. Cannonball Adderley
“Mercy Mercy Mercy!”
Live at “The Club” (Capitol, 1966)
The first time I heard this song I went out and bought the 45. I listened to Joe Zawinul’s funky vibe and how it really spoke. I never would have imagined that 10 years later we’d begin a friendship that would last for over 30 years. This is one of the only times you will hear Zawinul on Wurlitzer electric piano. Herbie Hancock
“Lil Brother”
Fat Albert Rotunda (Warner Brothers, 1970)
This is from the first album that really got me into the Fender Rhodes Suitcase model. Herbie found the sweet spot, and the sound and textures he was using really brought that instrument to light. Groove and funk mixed with jazz sensibilities, featuring a great sax solo by the late Joe Farrell. Miles Davis
“Spanish Key”
Bitches Brew (Columbia, 1970)
This was the song from the album that convinced me I had to dedicate my life to music and set me on the path to my goal of working with Miles Davis. The openness and dominance that the Rhodes had on that song was very hypnotic. The sound was deep and funky and it introduced me to Chick Corea. I had never heard someone play so open and free yet so focused. Cannonball Adderley
“The Black Messiah”
The Black Messiah: Live at the Troubadour (Capitol, 1972)
Cannonball Adderley was always incredibly hip, and his music and the people he worked with were always conscious of the times we lived in. Who can you get after having Joe Zawinul in your band for nine years? Well, the transition to George Duke was as smooth as silk and this song introduced us to George, who brought a whole other style to the quintet and his own original style to the Fender Rhodes. This track hits hard from the first note. George’s percussive style on the Mark 1 Rhodes brought Cannonball’s music to a younger audience, now known as baby-boomers. Hubert Laws
“Morning Star”
Morning Star (CTI, 1972)
This song introduced me to a new player: Bob James. “Morning Star” could be the most elegant and beautiful solo ever played on the Rhodes. Bob’s distinctive single-note style and musicality combined with Rudy Van Gelder’s amazing sound opened up a new world for the Rhodes. I became a huge Bob James CTI fan. Chick Corea
“Spain”
Light as a Feather (Polydor, 1973)
I still have a vivid memory of the first time I heard this in 1972. It was a spiritual moment. Chick was playing great, focused melodies and improvisations throughout this album, but this song was magic from its first note. The mix of the vocal with the Rhodes was something I hadn’t heard before. The whole vibe was perfection and made me realize that a certain musical technique was required to bring your own voice to this instrument. He had the Fender Rhodes singing. Weather Report
“125th Street Congress”
Sweetnighter (Columbia, 1973)
I had been listening to Weather Report’s first two albums, but this song from Sweetnighter, their third album, was in a whole other place. Joe Zawinul’s use of the wah-wah pedal and phase shifter on the Rhodes turned it into a different instrument, and the grooves on this song highlighted the new possibilities. I spoke to Joe a number of times about this song and we agree that it really could be the first hip-hop groove. Herbie Hancock
“Actual Proof”
Head Hunters (Columbia, 1973)
What can one say? It’s a song still worth studying today for the musicality and variety of new keyboard instruments that were used, and of course for the nine-plus minutes of pure bliss from an incredible Herbie solo. It still sets the standard. Kraftwerk
“Computer World”
Computer World (Kling Klang/Warner Brothers, 1981)
Minimalist monophonic synthesizers with tacky drum sounds with a message that resonates even today. When I listen to this track now I really see how ahead of their time Kraftwerk was. This was a huge influence on me with regard to how not to clutter up synthesizer tracks. The Pointer Sisters
“Jump (For My Love)”
Break Out (Planet, 1983)
This song really stretched what synthesizers could do in 1983. It was right before MIDI and digital synthesizers took over. The incredibly fat sounds provided mostly by the great sound of the Oberheim synthesizer all tied together with their “system” that used drum machine and sequencer. This was the last peak before the sounds started to change, thanks to the introduction of the Yamaha DX 7. It features perfect vocals. I learned a lot listening to this song. *** Jason Miles is a New York-based keyboardist, producer, composer, arranger and bandleader whose latest album is Kind of New 2: Blue Is Paris.

 A lot of these records incorporated effects on the piano (tape delay on Bent Fabric’s “Catsanova Walk,” modified tack piano on B. Bumble’s “Bumble Boogie”) and/or various organ sounds and electric piano sounds (pitch bend on the Lowrey Organ on Dick Hyman’s “The Liquidator” and Wurlitzer on Donny Hathaway’s “The Ghetto”). These jazz-rock records also had amazing production. The sounds that the engineers were able to get on the drums were incredibly warm, very analog sounding, and some sound overdriven (obviously many had been done straight to a tape machine). Some tracks have heavy spring reverb on the guitar that adds a lot to the sound as well. Many of the other pianists are more groove-oriented and their music lends itself more to the rock side or pop side of the incredibly broad spectrum of jazz (Sergio Mendes’ “Mas Que Nada” and Ramsey Lewis’ “The In Crowd”).

“The Liquidator”
DICK HYMAN
The Man From O.R.G.A.N. (Command, 1965)
Very catchy Lowrey Organ tune. The first 10 or so seconds of this tune make up Ben Vaughn’s theme song for his radio show, The Many Moods of Ben Vaughn. This tune incorporates a lot of different sounds: baritone guitar, timpani, various percussion. The organ solo is incredible; the interplay between Dick’s left hand and the guitar is very rhythmic and has an incredible bounce to it. LISTEN.

“Bumble Boogie”
B. BUMBLE AND THE STINGERS
(originally Rendezvous, 1962; currently available on Nut Rocker and All the Classics, Ace Records import, 1995)
Incredibly bright tack piano takes the lead on this track. The baritone guitar adds a lot to this as well. It’s Earl Palmer on drums too! B. Bumble and the Stingers were an American instrumental ensemble in the early 1960s, who specialized in making rock and roll arrangements of classical melodies. Their biggest hits were “Bumble Boogie” and “Nut Rocker.” The recordings were made by session musicians at Rendezvous Records in Los Angeles, but when they became successful, a touring group was formed led by R. C. Gamble as Billy Bumble.

“Coffee Cold”
GALT MACDERMOT
Galt MacDermot and His Mid Manhattan Rhythm Section (Kilmamock, 1966)
The grooviest of all-this features Bernard “Pretty” Purdie and Jimmy Lewis. Galt wrote all the music for Hair and not many people know about him, but those who do know that this record is one of the best!

“Catsanova Walk”
BENT FABRIC
Alley Cat (ATCO, 1962)
His full name is Bent Fabricius-Bjerre. He is more well know for his recording of “Alley Cat,” but this song features one of the first tape-delayed pianos ever recorded.

“Lonesome Traveler”
RAY BRYANT
Lonesome Traveler (Cadet, 1966)
Cool hi-hat-driven drum beat. Ray’s solo really gets more into the jazzier side of things than the rock. It’s very melodic and has some incredible little quick riffs here and there.

“The In Crowd”
RAMSEY LEWIS
The In Crowd (Argo, 1965)
I love the live vibe of this tune. You can hear people talking and hyping up the band. The band uses dynamics well and gets louder and quieter during some of those sweet live moments in the tune.

“Mas Que Nada”
Sergio Mendes & Brasil ’66
Herb Alpert Presents Sergio Mendes & Brasil ’66 (A&M, 1966)
What a catchy tune. The piano riff that opens is known by most people out there. I’ve always been a fan of Brazilian music, especially when it crosses over into the ’70s rock side of things. This tune has some of the most incredible comping! The piano pokes itself in and out between the vocal melody beautifully.

“The Ghetto”
DONNY HATHAWAY
Live (ATCO, 1972)
Incredible Wurlitzer electronic piano solo right out of the gate! The Wurlitzer electronic piano is one of my favorite electric pianos to play and has such a vibe. People think of Donny as soul, but he had so much jazz in his playing. Donny’s voice always gets me going too. Man, he can sing!

“Outa-Space”
BILLY PRESTON
I Wrote a Simple Song (A&M, 1971)
Ouch! This is definitely the funkiest thing on the list. What incredible clav work. Billy Preston is one my favorites mainly because of his rhythm and the incredible positive vibe that emits from the speakers when I hear it. The short wah-clav solo at the end is off the charts. It sounds like some singing!

“Soulful Strut”
YOUNG-HOLT UNLIMITED
Soulful Strut (Brunswick, 1968)
Yes, this is the same rhythm section as the Ramsey Lewis record. Salena Jones recorded a vocal version of this that’s incredible too. This song is so catchy, I feel like people should play it more at jam sessions and on gigs!

 The music industry spends a lot of time trying to organize the massive output of American artists into categories. There are broad categories and subcategories, but a certain percentage of artists still never quite fit into any of them. I am one of those, as are many of the musicians I listen to and collaborate with. So when JazzTimes asked me to write this column, I decided to focus on “crossover” players-i.e., those who perform and record in multiple genres. Here is a playlist featuring tracks by such fellow genre-benders.

“Little Girl”
BILL FRISELL
Disfarmer (Nonesuch, 2009)
It just wants you to put words to it.

“I Believe in You”
BLACK DUB
Black Dub (Jive/Red Ink, 2010)
Drummer Brian Blade’s intro is totally suspended, setting us up for super satisfaction when the groove comes in. It’s so loose and so grounded at the same time.

“16 Shells From a Thirty-Ought-Six”
TOM WAITS
Big Time (Island, 1988)
Tom Waits has long recruited artists from other fields to play in his band and on his albums, and bassist Greg Cohen was a defining sound on his great recordings from the 1980s. Compare this to something from Ornette Coleman’s Sound Grammar, where Greg stays mostly arco. It’s the same guy, straight and true.

“Old Man River”
MARC RIBOT TRIO
Live at the Village Vanguard (Pi, 2014)
Marc Ribot is a hack-and I mean that as a compliment! He can play passionately in any genre and is asked to do so all the time. Compare this to some of his work with Buddy Miller, T Bone Burnett or Tom Waits. It’s the same voice but totally at home within multiple contexts. I love the way the melody comes through the jagged lines of the arpeggiated chords on this live version of the old classic.

“Tiny Voices”
JOE HENRY
Tiny Voices (Anti-, 2003)
Joe Henry has a habit, much like Tom Waits, of inviting exotic sounds into his songwriting. Listen to Don Byron, on clarinet, and trumpeter Ron Miles on this track. They dance their way all over this album. And go back to Henry’s Scar record and listen for Ornette Coleman.

“Li’l Darlin'”
JULIAN LAGE
Sounding Point (Emarcy, 2009)
Julian Lage can do anything. His sense of lyricism, rhythmic feel and prodigious athleticism make anything possible. I’ve long loved this whole album and especially this track, but have recently been watching him on YouTube with Chris Eldridge (of Punch Brothers fame) and marveling at his comfort in styles other than jazz. Go to 2:30 and imagine every instrument replaced by those of a classic bluegrass quartet.

“You Noticed”
THE NELS CLINE SINGERS
Initiate (Cryptogramophone, 2010)
I could have picked a Wilco track to illuminate Nels’ unrestrained artistry, but it’s hard to find one you might not already know, so I went with this favorite. Also, check out the first track of my Mischief & Mayhem album: If it weren’t so obviously self-promoting I’d include it here as an example of Nels’ amazing ability to support whatever is going on around him, be it a song with words or a sound collage.

“Pork Belly”
ALLISON MILLER’S BOOM TIC BOOM
No Morphine No Lilies (Foxhaven/The Royal Potato Family, 2013)
Both the drummer Allison Miller and bassist Todd Sickafoose play around in all of the genres. On a track like this they refuse to box it in but never let that groove go. ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912202496.35/warc/CC-MAIN-20190321051516-20190321073516-00545.warc.gz

 Wordless singing is what I call it, but the absence of words doesn’t mean there is no story to tell. On the contrary, the artists I have chosen are masters of storytelling through song-no words needed. Their humanity emerges through both the vulnerability and the strength of their sound. They have opened a door for many of us who wanted to go beyond scat singing.

Milton Nascimento
“Minas”
Minas (EMI Brazil, 1975) 
I was a child when I heard Milton’s voice. It helped shape my own sound and kept my imagination expanding. Minas Gerais is Milton’s home state in Brazil, with wide-open skies and rolling green mountains. His falsetto on this song, which opens with a choir quoting another Milton tune on the album, exemplifies his musicality, intuition and powerful storytelling. He reveals what’s most primal as well as most sophisticated about a melody and makes it seem vital and noble. His recordings have always innovated in terms of sound and orchestration. Wayne Shorter’s album Native Dancer relies heavily on Milton’s sound and aesthetic, and is one of the most important recordings in jazz.

Kenny Wheeler
(Norma Winstone, vocals)
“Part 1-Opening”
Music for Large & Small Ensembles (ECM, 1990)
I first heard this record, which features Dave Holland, John Abercrombie, Evan Parker, Peter Erskine and John Taylor, when I was in school in Boston. I lived with it, breathing with Norma at the end of every one of her gorgeous phrases. She epitomizes the depth of Kenny’s music and reveals her intelligence and gentle strength, and from the record’s first notes you get the feeling that this will be a journey. Norma is weaved beautifully into the orchestration, and her sound remains a mystery for the many who ask, “Is there someone singing there or am I hearing things?”

Bobby McFerrin
“Selim”
Bang!Zoom (Blue Note, 1995)
Bobby McFerrin broke every barrier there ever was for singers. He showed us what was possible (and impossible, for us mere mortals) and continues to do so. On “Selim,” he teaches us a lesson in self-restraint. He could sing pirouettes around everything, but he remains reverent to the melody and exposes its bones like Miles would with his horn. The notes emanate from him as if they were born inside his soul, yet he has this instrumental approach to sound. It is rare, if not a miracle, for a singer to have a sound as gorgeous as his and huge knowledge and curiosity.

Theo Bleckmann/Ben Monder 
“Hymenium”
At Night  (Songlines, 2007)
Theo Bleckmann has explored and investigated so many possibilities in his voice, or voices, I should say, as he is so many things. His years working with the genius Meredith Monk ensured that Theo kept everything open and unfinished in his music-a constant and infinite exploration. Although he is one of the most adventurous singers I know, he is also disciplined and methodical. On this short and beautiful piece, you get a glimpse of his beauty and his devotion to the human sound.

Toninho Horta Com e Orquestra Fantasma
“Aquelas Coisas Todas (Sanguessuga)”
Terra Dos Pássaros (Odeon, 1980)
Toninho’s writing is extremely gorgeous and vocal, even when it is instrumental. His singing is so natural and unaffected-a guitarist’s or composer’s singing-and it matches his music impeccably. His orchestrations use the human voice as melody and counterpoint, making his music very distinguishable and incredibly personal and intimate. “Aquelas Coisas Todas” is an amazing composition with a memorable vocal melody that keeps unfolding.

Pat Metheny Group
(Pedro Aznar, vocals)
“Have You Heard”
Letter From Home (Geffen, 1989)
For so many people, this was probably their introduction to wordless singing. Pedro Aznar’s voice is timeless and makes complex music seem simple and singable. His sound is so expressive and emotional I sometimes hear him in places where I know there are no vocals; his sound lasts in my ears. Many of my generation were influenced by this music, and I think Pat’s inclusion of a voice elevated the possibilities of wordless singing and made his ensemble sound utterly unique.  Luciana Souza is a celebrated Brazilian singer and composer whose latest release is Speaking in Tongues (Sunnyside). Six of her previous albums were nominated for Grammy Awards.

 The role of the jazz musician who composes and performs protest music is an important one. Doing so automatically give others the courage to compose, play and sing his or her own. It is, however, becoming more difficult to find jazz musicians in general and jazz vocalists in particular who boldly give voice to social ills through their music-an unusual and unfortunate turn of affairs considering that jazz itself began as a form of protest music.

When the topic of jazz protest music is raised, there are some musicians who immediately come to mind: Oscar Brown Jr., Nina Simone, Gil Scott-Heron. We think of them as fearless as they put to music and offer to the public what the rest of us will talk about only in private-if we dare talk about it at all.
Some of these tracks are tough to listen to, like the Abbey Lincoln/Max Roach “Triptych,” Roy Campbell’s “Amadou Diallo” and Abel Meeropol’s “Strange Fruit.” Powerful stuff. But that is what protest music is meant to be: powerful. It is meant to move the listener to action, even if that action is simply re-thinking one’s firmly held beliefs.

 “Triptych: Prayer, Protest, Peace” 
Max Roach We Insist! Max Roach’s Freedom Now Suite
(Candid, 1960)
A brilliant, painfully haunting piece done by two musicians who obviously have complete trust in one another’s musicality, thereby allowing the tune its full expressions of emotion. Abbey Lincoln’s vocalese blends so perfectly with Roach’s percussion, it’s easy to forget you’re listening to a singer. But be warned: The second piece in the triptych is excruciating to listen to.

 “Why? (The King of Love Is Dead)” 
Nina Simone ‘Nuff Said!  (RCA Victor, 1968)
Most folks would expect “Mississippi Goddam” when they see Nina Simone’s name listed here. But her quieter, more poignant offerings can also grab one around the throat. Gene Taylor was Simone’s bass player and he composed this three days after Dr. Martin Luther King’s death, performing it live the same night in New York. When Nina whispers “mountain top” and yells/sings “violent man,” the presence of vocal genius is overwhelming.

 “Forty Acres and a Mule” 
Oscar Brown Jr.
Mr. Oscar Brown, Jr. Goes to Washington
(Verve, 1965)
Protest music is by nature serious and thought provoking. But when humor or sarcasm is included it possesses an extra bite. Oscar Brown Jr.’s “Forty Acres and a Mule” provides the necessary bit of truthful levity that helps maintain one’s sanity in the face of promises broken.

 “Winter in America” 
Gil Scott-Heron Winter in America (Strata-East, 1974)
In general I prefer Scott-Heron’s spoken-word pieces, but this man never failed to evoke stark imagery with his lyrics, regardless of how they came out of his mouth, as exemplified in this excerpt from a 2009 interview: “We felt as though we had come across something that people did not understand or did not recognize … the season that we were going into, not for three months, but for an extended period of time. A lot of the folks who represented summer and spring and fall had been killed and assassinated. The only season left was winter.” (Track available on 1998 TVT reissue.)

 “Original Faubus Fables” 
Charles Mingus Presents Charles Mingus
(Candid, 1960)
Mingus was one of the baddest motherfuckers, with scary-deep insight and an inimitable way of seeing and stating things. Here is another example of perfectly executed musical protest and sarcasm against Arkansas Governor Orval Faubus, who sent out the National Guard to prevent nine black students from integrating Little Rock Central High School in 1957. His first release of this tune (“Fables of Faubus”) didn’t include lyrics due to Columbia’s refusal. Mingus later released it on the Candid label as “Original Faubus Fables” with lyrics.

 “I Have a Dream” 
Mary Lou Williams Mary Lou’s Mass (Mary, 1975)
Mary Lou Williams once said she is praying through her fingers when she plays in an attempt to touch people’s spirits. Though this song, written in 1968 after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King and recorded the following year, isn’t blatantly protest music, it does nibble at the edges of social issues by quoting and paraphrasing portions of Dr. King’s speech. (Smithsonian Folkways reissued the album in 2005.)

 “Strange Fruit” 
Nina Simone Pastel Blues (Philips, 1965)
Though Billie Holiday implied in her autobiography that she’d co-written this song, Abel Meeropol is the real composer. I tried to use another version other than Nina Simone’s, but it was pointless. The stark chord accompaniment and understated horror of Simone’s quiet, sad voice leave me nothing less than traumatized by the time the song is over. But … is it ever over?

 “Amadou Diallo” 
Roy Campbell Ethnic Stew and Brew (Delmark, 2001)
Roy Campbell’s work is always visceral, and this selection is particularly captivating. Though this is an instrumental, it is more than a jazz-inflected selection named for the 21-year-old devout Muslim from Liberia who was shot dead in the doorway of his home in the Bronx. The 41 shots fired at the unarmed Diallo by four policemen-along with the tension, anger and unanswered questions incidents like this inevitably raise-are sonically captured all the way to the end of this piece.

 “You’ve Got to Be Carefully Taught” 
Ruthie Ristich Carefully Taught (Skydancer, 2002)
Who woulda thunk that this lovely song written by Rodgers and Hammerstein about racial prejudice could be snuck into South Pacific? Rodgers and Hammerstein were repeatedly pressured to remove the song from the musical, with lawmakers in Georgia actually going so far as to introduce legislation that would make illegal the performance of any creative works with ideas that stemmed from “Communist” thinking. According to James Michener (author of the book that inspired the musical), “The authors replied stubbornly that this number represented why they wanted to do the play in the first place. … [E]ven if it meant the failure of the production, it was going to stay in.”

 “(What Did I Do to Be So) Black and Blue” 
Ethel Waters Ethel Waters 1929-1939 (Timeless, 1998)
“All the race fellows crave ‘high-yellows’/Gentlemen prefer them light/I’m just another spade who can’t make the grade/Looks like there’s nothing but dark days in sight.” Originally one of the songs in the musical Hot Chocolates, these are the opening lyrics of “(What Did I Do to Be So) Black and Blue.” Lyricist Andy Razaf (the music was written by Fats Waller) sussed out the painful realities of racism and self-hatred within one’s own race, as the black girl continues to sing, “I’m white inside, but that don’t help my case/’Cause I can’t hide what is on my face.” This agonizing reality continues to be expressed via the song’s inclusion in the musical Ain’t Misbehavin’.

 “Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?” 
Andy Bey Ain’t Necessarily So (12th Street, 2007)
Though I didn’t know it at the time, this was probably the first protest song I learned, before I was 10. Written by Yip Harburg and Jay Gorney, it’s one of the songs from Peter, Paul and Mary’s album See What Tomorrow Brings. A few years ago, I heard Andy Bey do his bad-ass version of it and immediately thought of him as a kindred spirit. This song’s message competes aggressively as one of the most outspoken protest songs ever written: How can a country send its young men to war and have so little for them if they are lucky enough to come back alive? How can a government depend on the backbreaking work of young men and then discard them, allowing them to end up homeless or standing in breadlines? Written in the 1930s, it was an anthem for the Depression and continues to be, like most protest songs, applicable today.

 Jazz musicians have a strong tradition of building on the foundation of the giants who came before. We often hear about how we must listen to “the masters,” the key players during the developmental years of jazz. I agree with this 100 percent and have done a plethora of historical homework. But I also look to the musicians who are a generation or more younger than me for new concepts and innovations. Historically it’s been the young players who bring new ideas to the music.

I’m 59 years old and came of age in the late ’60s/early ’70s. My generation is stylistically quite diverse, from Terry Bozzio, Peter Erskine, Vinnie Colaiuta and Dave Weckl to Jeff Hamilton, Adam Nussbaum, Kenny Washington and Lewis Nash. We now have new generations of jazz drummers who are in tune with the tradition and have brought some fresh ideas to the music. Here are some songs featuring drummers, all younger than me, whom I listen to for inspiration and ideas.

“Opening Portals”
BILL STEWART
Incandescence (Pirouet, 2008)
Bill Stewart is blistering on this burner featuring a unique trio of drums, Larry Goldings on Hammond B-3 and Kevin Hays on acoustic piano. Bill’s ride-cymbal playing is focused, clear and expressive; the ride is well integrated into the rhythms being played on the rest of the kit. He uses a wide range of dynamics, which intensifies the peaks and valleys of both his comping and soloing. The solo sections of “Opening Portals” are in fact two duets, one with piano and the second with B-3. The drum solo starts alone and then Bill continues to develop his solo over Goldings’ walking bass. Bill has innovated some new sounds on the kit, such as virtuosic use of press rolls and extracting controlled overtones from the snare drum. Both are subtly used on this track in addition to some of his other trademarks, like the polyrhythmic foot ostinatos he maintains while playing over the bar lines with the hands.

“Treachery”
ERIC HARLAND
Voyager: Live by Night (Space Time/Sunnyside, 2011)
I’ve often heard Eric Harland play at a very low dynamic level in a controlled and understated way, an approach in which he excels. But “Treachery” features Eric pulling out all the stops like I hadn’t heard before, playing busy time with a seamless flow of rhythms. In this piece, his quintet improvises using interactive, empathetic principles: call and response, pedal points, multiple layers of simultaneous soloing-which generates controlled chaos-and individual solos with vigorous rhythm section support. Eric’s use of stacked “staccato” cymbals and rimshots on the toms, mixed with his legato cymbal hits, gives his playing a blend of jazz and funk, yet his style doesn’t sound like fusion drumming.

“Moanin'”
ARI HOENIG
Lines of Oppression (Ari Hoenig, 2011)
Ari Hoenig plays with a deep sense of swing and profound control of time and tone. His ability to play both song melodies and swinging time is expertly-and soulfully-demonstrated on his take of the Bobby Timmons classic “Moanin’.” You have to hear this to believe it! “Stadium Jazz”

DONNY MCCASLIN
(MARK GUILIANA, DRUMS)
Casting for Gravity (Greenleaf, 2012)
Mark Guiliana is another drummer with remarkable dynamic control; I’ve heard him burn at triple-pianissimo when playing in bassist Avishai Cohen’s trio. On “Stadium Jazz” we hear another side of his playing, full bodied with a heavy funk/groove approach. Mark’s kit is unique in that he uses only bass drum, snare drum, hi-hat, floor tom, stacked cymbals and one ride cymbal. He’s able to play with a full range of tones and textures with what can appear to be a limited setup. His solo over the 6/4 vamp is funky and rhythmically daring; he both respects and obscures the groove. Saxophonist Donny McCaslin gives Mark plenty of room to stretch out in the various sections of this Weather Report-inspired composition.

“Afro Blue”
ROBERT GLASPER EXPERIMENT
(CHRIS DAVE, DRUMS)
Black Radio (Blue Note, 2012)
Chris Dave also employs a unique drum setup, sometimes using multiple snare drums instead of toms. We hear various snare sounds and smooth, legato cymbal crashes on “Afro Blue,” which keep the drum track sonically interesting. What I find particularly fascinating here is the severe swing factor that Dave uses with the placement of his bass drum and hi-hat rhythms. His approach sounds influenced by drum computer programming but takes on new life when played by a drum-set virtuoso.

 These musicians changed jazz trombone in various ways: technically, expressively, harmonically or rhythmically, or combinations of the above. They are also people who affected me profoundly. Even though I may not play like them, my appreciation for them and their contributions runs deep.

Sidney Bechet
“IN A SENTIMENTAL MOOD” (Vic Dickenson, trombone)
Concert a l’Exposition Universelle de Bruxelles 
(Collection Sidney Bechet, 1958)
Rahsaan Roland Kirk played this for me, and I listened to how Vic Dickenson was using the slide. It sounds kind of loose, which it is, but it isn’t sloppy; it’s very controlled and deliberate and nuanced and articulate. I really appreciate his intonation and his phrasing, and the way he uses the slide for expressiveness.

Dicky Wells
“DICKY WELLS BLUES”
Dicky Wells in Paris
(His Master’s Voice, 1955; recorded in 1937)
The technical finesse that Dicky Wells played with was unbelievable. Here, he uses the slide coming out of the way Vic did, but with more sophistication, and he has a much greater range and incredible flexibility. Django Reinhardt plays guitar on this track.

Jack Teagarden
“BODY AND SOUL”
The Golden Horn of Jack Teagarden
(Decca, 1964; recorded in 1953)
There are a couple of dozen recordings of Jack Teagarden playing “Body and Soul.” But this one-which also has his brother Charlie playing trumpet-is the cream of the crop. His chops are all the way on; he’s at the peak of his form. His harmonic sense is ahead of its time. He has tremendous flexibility in his own unique way.

Lawrence Brown
“ROSE OF THE RIO GRANDE”
Slide Trombone (Clef, 1955)
Lawrence Brown was a master of ballads and the blues. This cut is surprising because it’s very modern yet it has the feelings and elements of earlier styles in there too; the harmonic and rhythmic things he plays are almost bebop but not quite. He leads the rhythm very much the way J.J. Johnson does.

Dizzy Gillespie
(Al Gray, trombone)
“DIZZY’S BLUES”
At Newport (Verve, 1957)
Besides being the grandmaster of the open horn plunger, Al Gray was also a grandmaster of the open horn. We all know him from Basie’s band, but on this cut he’s playing with Dizzy, so it’s very modern. He’s swinging hard and he’s got a big, powerful, full sound. He’s not one of those guys who whispers and puts the mic inside the bell. On this live recording, he’s just standing up in his section and blowing over the band.

Frank Rosolino
“ALL THE THINGS YOU ARE”
Fond Memories Of…
(Double-Time, 1996; music in recorded 1973, ’75)
Just about anything Frank Rosolino did was a gem. I chose this track because it’s readily available and is really incredible. It’s a good example of him. Frank had his own voice, and his flexibility was unique and unparalleled. It was effortless for Frank to play with this kind of flexibility and to play in the upper register.

The Jazztet
“IT’S ALL RIGHT WITH ME” (Curtis Fuller, trombone)
Meet the Jazztet (Argo, 1960)
All the guys I’m talking about are masters, but nobody can play fast like Curtis Fuller. He’s playing the rhythm, not just playing notes fast against the rhythm. This song is a reflection of his style. You say, “Goddamn, is that a saxophone?” No, it’s a slide trombone! It’s clean and smooth and the lines make sense. His articulation is clear and precise. He’s playing scales and arpeggios.

J.J. Johnson
“TEA POT”
Dial J.J. 5 (Columbia, 1957)
“Tea Pot” is based on “Sweet Georgia Brown.” For any of the naysayers who don’t think J.J. Johnson could play fast, this will put that to rest. A lot of guys play fast, but they play real soft, with a little wimpy sound and unclear articulation. J.J. is super clear. He has great range on this too. It’s all in there.

J.J. Johnson
“BLUES WALTZ”
Proof Positive (Impulse!, 1964)
What I appreciate about “Blues Waltz” is how J.J. leads rhythmically. He doesn’t just follow and float-he defines. His tone is robust and resonant and as perfect as the greatest orchestral trombone players, yet he doesn’t sound like an orchestral trombone player. What he’s doing harmonically is very sophisticated. He uses space. Most of his improvisations are more melodic than linear. It’s not speed for speed’s sake.

188,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/departments/artistchoice/christian-mcbrides-10-favorite-roy-hargrove-recordings/,"Roy Hargrove It was a difficult task for me to pick my 10 favorite Roy Hargrove tracks. He meant the world to me as a friend and as a musician, but he meant the world to everyone who knew him, so part of me felt like I should try to pick a “universal 10.” However, that would be too hard as everyone has their own favorites, so I’ve finally whittled it down to my personal 10. I hope you enjoy. Listen to a Spotify playlist featuring most of the songs mentioned below:  Bobby Watson & Horizon
“Country Corn Flakes” (comp. Bobby Watson)
No Question About It (Blue Note, 1988) Roy’s first appearance on record. This song led off the album and introduced the next major trumpet star to the world. Even at 19, Roy sounds quite developed. His signature sass and soul shine bright. Roy Hargrove
“All Over Again” (comp. Hargrove)
Diamond in the Rough (RCA Novus, 1990) From Roy’s debut solo album. Even by the time of this release, he had been making the rounds with a number of jazz legends, which made many aware of his fiery trumpet playing, but this is an amazing early showcase of his melodic composing. I’ve always loved this song. So hip and swinging, but sweet. Roy Hargrove
“Alter Ego” (comp. James Williams)
The Vibe (RCA Novus, 1992) Roy absolutely loved this close-to-being-a-standard by James Williams. From the time he first recorded it until the end of his life, he always kept it in his repertoire. I think I heard him play it with almost every band he ever had. Roy Hargrove Quintet
“Mental Phrasing” (comp. Hargrove)
With the Tenors of Our Time (Verve, 1994) Another example of Roy’s postbop, melodic, slick, hip writing. Roy and I shared a love of the compositional styles of Bobby Watson and James Williams, which always had a not-so-hidden trace of classic soul. Many of their songs sounded like a combination of Tadd Dameron and Gamble & Huff. While this is a hardcore swinger, it’s a wink to the harmonic sensibilities of not just Coltrane, but maybe Stevie Wonder too. Gladys Knight
“Good Morning, Heartache” (comp. Higginbotham, Drake, Fisher)
Before Me (Verve, 2006) For all of Roy’s fire, what clearly separated him from his peers was his ability to play ballads. Very few musicians of our generation thoroughly understood the melodic, lyrical, and emotional content of a ballad like him. He never seemed to belabor what to play or consciously channel some other great ballad player; it just flowed out of him. The solo he takes on this made me pull over in my car the first time I heard it. Christian McBride
“Sitting on a Cloud” (comp. McBride)
Gettin’ to It (Verve, 1995) Roy and I played on a LOT of recordings together. There was no way I couldn’t list something from one of them! Roy absolutely owned this song. And it has a story: In 1998, Roy called me and said, “Yo! I’m watching this movie and they got your tune ‘Sitting on a Cloud’ in it. It’s in the love scene.” I said, “What’s it called?” He said, “I don’t know, but it’s on the Lifetime channel. Hurry up and turn it on! You’ll miss my solo!” I’m thinking, “What are you doing watching the Lifetime channel?” Anyway, I couldn’t find it. Roy called back later and I told him I missed it. He said, “But it’s hip that your tune—and my solo—got in a movie!” I later found out the movie was called Mixing Nia. The Roy Hargrove Quintet
“Strasbourg/St. Denis” (comp. Hargrove)
Earfood (Decca, 2008) Perhaps the hardest thing for any jazz artist to accomplish in the last half-century has been to compose a standard. I think it’s safe to say that Roy did that with this song. There is not one single high school or college band I’ve heard that doesn’t play or list this song as one of their favorites. It’s managed to transcend every style of jazz. A combination of hip-hop groove and phrasing with unmistakable swing at its core. D’Angelo
“Spanish Joint” (comp: D’Angelo/Hargrove)
Voodoo (Virgin, 2000) Roy didn’t just participate on one of the most important pop/soul records of our time—he was one of the reasons why it became such an important record. When you think of horns in a funk or soul band, the standard has always been the razor-sharp styles of James Brown, Earth, Wind & Fire, Kool & the Gang, and Parliament/Funkadelic. Roy helped change that to a more mellow, sophisticated sound, while still remaining rhythmically unpredictable. Listen to any modern neo-soul or hip-hop tracks that are infused with multi-trumpet horn sections; the densely orchestrated sound you hear comes straight from Roy’s arranging on this album. Roy Hargrove
“Roy Allan” (comp. Hargrove)
Family (Verve, 1995) Another song of Roy’s that I believe is in the running to become a standard. He later, of course, wrote a big-band arrangement of this song, dedicated to his late father, which is breathtaking. It’s a fine example of Roy’s compositional amalgam of hardcore jazz with sensibilities of ’70s soul-jazz and, dare I say, a little smooth jazz. One of my favorites of his. Shirley Horn
“Take Love Easy” (comp. Ellington/ Latouche)
May the Music Never End (Verve, 2003) When we were on the road together in the early ’90s, Roy spent hours learning lyrics from recordings of Carmen McRae, Sarah Vaughan, Billy Eckstine, Betty Carter, and more. He understood that singers held the key to musical maturity. One of his favorite singers to play with was Shirley Horn—and who could sing a ballad like Shirley? With Roy being the lone horn on this record, I think it’s safe to say that Shirley loved him as much as he loved her. I picked this track but frankly, the entire album is a masterpiece. As we say goodbye to our friend Roy, let us also say—to quote the title of this, Shirley’s final studio album—“may the music never end.” ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912201996.61/warc/CC-MAIN-20190319143502-20190319165502-00396.warc.gz

“I Loves You Porgy”
Little Girl Blue (Bethlehem, 1958) I was 10 years old, in the ladies’ locker room at the pool, and this song was playing. I stopped what I was doing, sat there and listened. The way she sang that beautiful song, it impacted me so hard. Especially the voice, because I knew I had a deep voice like hers and I wondered if I could sing like that. Frank Sinatra
“Fools Rush In”
Nice ’N Easy (Capitol, 1960) I went to a piano bar with a girlfriend—she was the one who wanted to sing, but the pianist brought me up too, and handed me sheet music for “Fools Rush In.” “Sing this.” I knew Sinatra’s version. I loved the impeccable way he phrased it, and his swing, the rhythm and the tempo, just moved me. So we did the song the way Sinatra had done it. June Christy
“Midnight Sun”
Something Cool (Capitol, 1954) Just as I began singing jazz in L.A., a friend of mine who knew Joe Pass took me to a little club where he was working to say, “Hey, you’ve got to hear her sing.” I sat in and we did “Midnight Sun.” I’d learned the melody from listening to June Christy, whom I’d been told I sounded like; her approach was so graceful. Sammy Davis, Jr.
“I’ve Gotta Be Me”
I’ve Gotta Be Me (Reprise, 1968) This song was hugely popular at the moment in my life when I was trying to decide if I should become a full-time, professional singer. While I loved Sammy’s singing, it was the message of the song that grabbed me. It was true: I had to be me, I had to do this. I quit my day job. Nancy Wilson
“Here’s That Rainy Day”
From Broadway with Love (Capitol, 1964) I saw Nancy perform this song with Ray Brown in L.A. The way she phrased it and the way she delivered it, you believed every word she sang. She could really sell it. That was true with everything Nancy sang, of course, but her way with a ballad, and that one in particular, was wonderful. Lorez Alexandria
“Over the Rainbow”
Alexandria the Great (Impulse!, 1964) My singing coach recommended that I go see Lorez Alexandria, and she sang “Over the Rainbow” like I’ve never heard. It was a whole new approach: the difference between being a Doris Day singer, going out there and singing it straight, and being a singer like Lorez, a different concept, digging in really deep and figuring out what you have to offer. Sarah Vaughan
“Send in the Clowns”
Send in the Clowns (Mainstream, 1974)
“September in the Rain”
At Mr. Kelly’s (EmArcy, 1957) I was doing “Send in the Clowns” before Sarah recorded it; my brother saw the musical A Little Night Music and told me to learn it. I had a backer who wanted to record me at Capitol, but he wouldn’t let me do this tune, even after my conductor told him it would be a big hit. We blew it. Sarah, though, sings it the way it should be sung. She sings everything the way it should be sung. That live version of “September in the Rain,” at Mr. Kelly’s in Chicago, I just love. It’s a song that I recorded on Getting Sentimental, though I do it differently. I couldn’t do it like Sarah: The tempo, the band, the richness of her voice, it’s all perfection. Carmen McRae
“Detour Ahead”
At Ratso’s, Vol. 3 (Hitchcock Media, 2007)
“If the Moon Turns Green”
The Great American Songbook (Atlantic, 1972) This brings us to the present day. I’ve always loved Carmen McRae because you can feel her merely by the enunciation of her words. “Detour Ahead” is particularly resonant for me now. I picked up on it because it coordinates with some of the struggles I’ve had recently. I relate to it on a personal professional level. I’m also putting together a show in Chicago of her live recording of the Great American Songbook. “If the Moon Turns Green” is my favorite on that one. It’s an old Billie Holiday staple, but it’s Carmen McRae’s version that I think is the best. [as told to Michael J. West] Gayle Kolb has been a jazz singer for decades, performing in hotels and showrooms principally in Los Angeles and Chicago. But it was only recently, with the help of bassist/producer/arranger Dennis Carroll, that she finally got around to recording her first album. Titled Getting Sentimental, it was released by Jeru Jazz this past August.   ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912205597.84/warc/CC-MAIN-20190326160044-20190326182044-00479.warc.gz
190,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/departments/artistchoice/jamie-saft-spiritual-jazz/,"Jamie Saft Spiritual jazz is music that tries to invoke ecstatic, higher states of consciousness, whether it accesses them through religion or spirituality or in the music itself. People like John Coltrane and Pharoah Sanders got to these deep meditative states and higher realms by improvising within the structures they imposed on themselves. I find that all the deepest improvised music does that same thing. The higher states of improvising are themselves a higher state of consciousness. These people were looking for something more. Pharoah Sanders
“ASTRAL TRAVELING”
Thembi (Impulse!, 1971)
This was the first track from this genre that I heard and was inspired by. The whole record, Thembi, was a game-changer for me. It was one of the first electric-jazz records I heard. Free jazz was living right next to these groove feels. To me, that was a complete notion of what an improvised-music record could be. The prominent percussion, along with the meditative calm of this piece, transports the listener to a path toward a higher state of consciousness. John Coltrane
“NAIMA”
Live at the Village Vanguard Again! (Impulse!, 1966)
This version of “Naima” is an apex moment. Coltrane explodes the notion of how you deal with composed music and transforms one of his harmonic masterpieces with complete freedom; an open flow, adhering less strictly to the harmonic motion of the piece, yields new pathways. We never leave the harmonic world of “Naima”—the melody is always present, with important tonic stations—but the pace is now dictated by the improvisation. Alice Coltrane
“TURIYA AND RAMAKRISHNA”
Ptah, the El Daoud (Impulse!, 1970)
An amazing record. This track is a church hymn. It’s a very deep, focused piece of music. The acoustic piano-trio setting brings a classic tone and combines with the trancelike feel of the piece to create an alternate reality of sorts, transforming the past into something uniquely new. Albert Ayler Trio
“GHOSTS”
Spiritual Unity (ESP-Disk’, 1965)
“Ghosts” sounds like a hymn filtered through free jazz. It was always a clarion call to my ears. It woke me from my normal patterns and demanded something greater. Ayler always pushed his music into unknown realms and trusted in the transformative powers of improvisation. Sun Ra
“LANQUIDITY”
Lanquidity (Philly Jazz, 1978)
Sun Ra was certainly about astral traveling in a sense similar to what Pharoah was talking about: altering your state of mind within music. This title track, with its incredible melody, has a really creamy Fender Rhodes with some organ and puts him into a more electric zone. It really appeals to me as a keyboard player. “Lanquidity” is very onomatopoetic; it recalls a particular spiritual flow. This music is constantly searching, seeking deeper forms and new modes of thinking. Pharoah Sanders
“HARVEST TIME”
Pharoah (India Navigation, 1977)
No drums, just guitar, bass, saxophone and hand percussion. Two chords repeated over and over for 20 minutes. Long tones, deep soul and spiritual transformation are all in play here. Intimate and refreshing. Doug Carn
“PEACE”
Infant Eyes (Black Jazz, 1971)
He takes this Horace Silver tune and brings out the more ecstatic side of it. It’s classic early ’70s inner-seeking electric jazz, with Fender Rhodes. His wife, Jean Carn, is the singer on it.

It used to provoke discussion and dissent. Teddy Wilson was known as the Marxist Mozart! Hoagy Carmichael
“LAZYBONES” Co-written with Johnny Mercer
Stardust & Much More (Bluebird; rec. 1933, rel. 1989)
This might be one of the greatest protest songs ever written, because it’s about radical non-participation. There’s a line in Cat’s Cradle by Kurt Vonnegut where the woman who’s working as a relative underling wishes everyone would just stop thinking. That makes me think of this song. I have a friend who says, “If everyone would just do 10 percent less.” Edith Wilson
“(WHAT DID I DO TO BE SO) BLACK AND BLUE”
Music by Fats Waller with lyrics by Harry Brooks and Andy Razaf (Columbia, 1929)
I was able to perform this for a member of the original cast of Black and Blue. [The song was originally written for the 1929 Broadway show Hot Chocolates.] I was a little embarrassed because I knew I wasn’t playing it like Fats Waller. The song is more nuanced than one might think. Most people just know the chorus. I always thought it was about being black, and then I
thought about how you can see it as a woman who’s being beaten. When you hear Edith Wilson’s version you realize that it’s about being left for a lighter-skinned black woman. It’s about color but also about the vagaries and whims of love beyond only race. Charles Mingus
“FABLES OF FAUBUS”
Mingus Ah Um (Columbia, 1959)
I used this in my show about [the trailblazing conservationist] Rachel Carson [Silent Spring: It’s Not Nice to Fool Mother Nature], and we changed some of the shout-outs to be about chemical pesticides. It’s a protest song that can be used for so many movements. It has a wonderful feel; it’s the delight of protest. I felt it when I campaigned for Bernie Sanders in particular, but also at other moments in my life—that joy of revolt and of the genuine resistance, not the corporate, co-opted kind. The thrill of fighting back shouldn’t be underestimated. [Anarchist writer] Emma Goldman said something to the effect of, “I don’t want a revolution where there won’t be dancing,” and this is a catchy tune as well as a statement. Les McCann & Eddie Harris
“COMPARED TO WHAT” By Gene McDaniels
Swiss Movement (Atlantic, 1969)
The men wore suits back then and the women were all put together, and they wrote these songs of such emotion and so much range. Maybe the secret is to go to church and drink a lot on weekends. I love “Compared to What” because you find out where the truth lies. The ground is always shifting beneath you. There’s a term called “fake news” nowadays, but that can apply to so much, to the majority of the media we consume, which is corporate. We need mass movements of civil disobedience. Billie Holiday & Her Orchestra
“STRANGE FRUIT” By Abel Meeropol (Commodore, 1939)
Billie used to close her sets with this and not come back, even if people didn’t like it. There’s a wonderful documentary about the creation of this song [Strange Fruit, from 2002]. The song has so much resonance for me. It also applies to war. Civil rights used to be emphatically antiwar; it’s lost that international movement of solidarity. If you want to have progress at home as well as abroad, you really need that solidarity, for people and animals. Dave Frishberg
“MY COUNTRY USED TO BE”
Quality Time (Sterling, 1994)
I saw him at Birdland and he got booed for this song. But that was under [George W.] Bush. The song is beautiful and gets to what is still possible. I’ve spent some time with David over the years and he’s the truest artist I’ve ever met. There’s not a phony bone in his body. He also has “Listen Here,” which we also used in my Rachel Carson show. It’s about that inner voice that we all neglect. He can be so terribly witty but there’s a real earnest Midwesterner in him. [As told to Jeff Tamarkin] Nellie McKay’s seventh album, Sister Orchid, will be out May 18 on Palmetto Records. She has never won a Grammy. She is a recipient of PETA’s Humanitarian Award and the Humane Society’s Doris Day Music Award, recognizing her dedication to animal rights.

192,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/departments/artistchoice/penn-jillette-mike-jones-bass-songs/,"Mike Jones (left) and Penn Jillette (photo: Ezekiel Zabrowski) For those of us who grew up on rock and pop, and then graduated to jazz, one of the major transitions is in the approach to the bass. Rock and pop basslines are often riff-oriented; jazz tries to find a way to keep the same groove and feel but does so while staying constantly in motion with the details. When we started playing together, both of us started listening to bass more aggressively—Penn, who was initially a rock bassist, to learn how to make that transition, and Mike, a jazz pianist, to give Penn guidance. In the process we came to identify certain songs, both jazz and non, as “bass songs.”—PENN JILLETTE AND MIKE JONES Ray Brown with John Clayton and Christian McBride 
“Papa Was a Rolling Stone”
SuperBass 2 (Telarc, 2001)
Jillette: The person that Jonesy wanted me to listen to the most, and that I had the pleasure of seeing live, was Ray Brown. (He called me “a very heavy cat,” and I’ve never forgotten it.) And to hear Ray Brown and all these jazz guys doing a pop song was a revelation to me: The way Ray Brown hears soul after being the jazz bass player, the wink and the exuberance, destroys me. Jim Hughart 
“Step Right Up”
Tom Waits, Small Change (Asylum, 1976)
Jillette: “Step Right Up” is the closest I came to jazz before I started working with Jonesy. Tom Waits really allows for that pure beat poetry over the repetitious jazz bass, rather than the detail-oriented bass.
Jones: It sounds wonderful. It’s one of the best-sounding recorded bassists, especially at that time—pre-fancy equipment. Paul Chambers
“So What”
Miles Davis, Kind of Blue (Columbia, 1959)
Jones: Is there any more identifiable riff in jazz? But for me, the riff means nothing except as an identifier; it’s Paul Chambers walking when Miles comes in with the first chorus, the way that the tension releases in that moment when Paul digs in, that’s just incredible. Joe Mondragon
“Fever”
Peggy Lee, Things Are Swingin’ (Capitol, 1958)
Jones: I don’t know if Joe Mondragon came up with that line on the spot, or if someone else wrote it out, but it makes the song exactly what it should have been all along. When you think of “Fever,” you think of the bass line.
Jillette: “Fever” has that wonderful combination, probably wonderful because it’s so rare, of the single human voice with the upright bass. That kind of duet is very hard to pull off, but when you do, as they do here, it’s a beautiful thing. Teddy Smith
“Song for My Father”
Horace Silver, Song for My Father (Blue Note, 1964)
Jones: I mean, come on! It’s the root and the fifth! The drummer, the percussive element of the tune, is actually doing a lot of the work. But it’s one of the first tunes that I heard, when I was a little kid, that had that unison bass and piano together. Penn and I should start doing some of those bass-piano unison lines.
Jillette: We should! Herbie Flowers
“Walk on the Wild Side”
Lou Reed, Transformer (RCA, 1972)
Jillette: If you want to know what I love about bass, “Wild Side” has the electric doing the repetitive riff, almost a multitone drone in the simplest chord progression possible, and then you have the acoustic bass playing over that as if doing the work of the lead guitar. It came out when I was 18 and I had never heard that sound before. Paul McCartney
“Come Together”
The Beatles, Abbey Road (Apple, 1969)
Jillette: George Harrison is not really the lead guitarist of the Beatles; Paul McCartney is. Much of the interesting melodic stuff is happening on his bass, while George’s guitar is less melodic and more repetitive. They say that “Come Together” is a John Lennon song—a classic John Lennon song—but I was horrified to learn that what John brought to the band was “Come Together” without the bass line. Take out the bass line, and what John ripped off from Chuck Berry, and that song is absolutely and precisely nothing. Bob Moore
“King of the Road”
Roger Miller, The Return of Roger Miller (Smash, 1965)
Jones: To an extent, it’s that same bass-and-voice duet that Penn was talking about on “Fever.”
Jillette: But really, the only reason we chose “King of the Road” was just to get the name Roger Miller to appear in JazzTimes. I think it’s really, really important for all of us to celebrate Roger Miller’s influence on jazz. Jack Bruce
“Badge”
Cream, Goodbye (Atco, 1969)
Jones: The melodic figure on the bass is one that I love. It almost makes you forget that Jack Bruce, and Ginger Baker for that matter, thought of themselves as jazz musicians who were slumming it.
Jillette: Both Eric Clapton and Ginger Baker claim that Jack played so loud, and had the monitor on his vocal up so loud, that one night during “Badge,” neither Ginger Baker nor Eric Clapton played, and Jack didn’t notice. I so hope that story is true. The pretension of rock and roll is so beautiful. [As told to Michael J. West]  Listen to this Artist’s Choice playlist by Penn Jillette and Mike Jones in Spotify:  Penn Jillette is a bassist, as well as (the speaking) half of the magician duo Penn and Teller.

194,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/departments/at-home/bobby-hutcherson/,"Bobby Hutcherson loves the simple life. Golfing. Fishing. Chopping wood. Hanging with his family. Playing ballads at sensuously slow tempos. He’s always been among the most physical of vibraphonists, often delivering notes with a flourish of body English. Offstage, the 66-year-old is just as animated, an engaging raconteur who punctuates stories with sweeping gestures and a vivid repertoire of facial expressions. Laughing easily and often with undisguised pleasure, he likes to answer questions with stories, wringing deep truths out of small details.

The quintessential postbop vibraphonist and an inspired composer, Hutcherson has frequently chased big ideas in his music. Since his recording debut in 1960 with pianist Les McCann on a Pacific Jazz compilation, he’s produced one of jazz’s richest and most rewarding discographies. He made many of his most celebrated albums during an explosively creative streak for Blue Note in the mid-1960s, though he recorded for the label through 1977, longer than any artist besides Horace Silver. His latest CD, For Sentimental Reasons, on the Swiss-based label Kind of Blue, is an exquisite quartet session with pianist Renee Rosnes, bassist Dwayne Burno and drummer Al Foster in which Hutcherson lavishes attention on familiar melodies, a rare project devoted almost exclusively to American Songbook standards (besides ringers by his late musical partner, tenor saxophonist Harold Land, and Benny Golson).

“My wife Rosemary has always said to me, ‘Why don’t you do a recording of ballads? Because you really take your time when you’re playing ballads,'” says Hutcherson. “I’ve done all these albums where there’s crazy things going on, a lot of different time signatures, a lot of keys, taking on crazy theories and trying to make it sound like falling on my head. I said, ‘Let me go back to the really simple melodies.’ Those are the hard ones to get your personality through.”

It’s not hard to get a read on Hutcherson in the living room of his ranch-style house in the hamlet of Montara, set back a few hundred yards from the gleaming Pacific Ocean, about 20 miles south of San Francisco. His three sons all live within minutes, and just about every wall holds family photos, including one taken around 1906 in Georgia of his father as a youth surrounded by his formally dressed parents, aunts, uncles and cousins. A shrine with four lit votive candles occupies the fireplace, and a full-length window looks out back at a well-tended garden and 18-foot powerboat. Surrounded to the east by pines festooned with Spanish moss, the house sits on an acre of land that he bought after the release of San Francisco, his 1970 album with Harold Land, when Hutcherson found himself with a tidy sum in his pocket from his minor hit “Ummh.” At the time, the area was completely undeveloped.

“I’ve been to a lot of beaches around the world and to me this is the most beautiful,” he says. “It’s really long, panoramic. It’s got this really clean, granite sand. Everybody’s fishing and surfing. I used to come here all the time because I was living in the Haight. When ‘Ummh’ became a hit, I thought, what am I going to do with this money? I came down here, bought an acre of land for $10,000 and I built this house for $30,000. I’m 20 minutes from San Francisco, and about 20 minutes to the airport. For a long time I kept saying, ‘I think I made the right choice.'”

Born and raised in Pasadena, Hutcherson has been drawn to the beach since he was a kid. He first gained exposure in a combo with his high school buddy, bassist Herbie Lewis, when they landed a gig at a Sunset Strip coffee house called Pandora’s Box. At the end of the night, he’d drive the old family Cadillac west on Sunset to the Pacific Palisades and set up his vibes in the sand. “I’d sit there and play to the waves,” Hutcherson recalls. “I thought that was great. Then I started getting pulled over by this one cop. You could hear the car coming down the street, and he stopped me, saying, ‘Kid, what are you doing in this part of town?’ You know there’s no young little brothers who lived on that side of town. I said, ‘I’ve been to the beach.’ ‘Doing what?’ I said, ‘Playing my instrument, the vibraphone.’ ‘The what? What is that, like the saxophone?’ ‘No, let me open up the trunk and I’ll show you.’ So once a week I’d go to the beach, and I’d set the vibes up in the sand and play. The cop would always be at the same spot waiting and after a while he got used to me coming by. It would always be three o’clock in the morning and I’d wave and he’d wave, ‘Hey, yeah. Keep moving. Go back to Pasadena. Don’t make any stops.'” MUSIC @HOME

“I don’t listen to very much music, but if I do, I’ll listen to Ravel or Renaissance composers. Hardly any jazz. I don’t listen to myself at all, because you get programmed. You hear something [and think], ‘Oh, I like that,’ or, ‘I don’t like that.’ So every time you get to a certain point, you’ll find yourself playing those ideas. I want to keep it open.” The Pen is Mightier Than…

“I’m computer-illiterate. I’m still with the pen, piece of paper and a paper clip.” Vacation Destination

“We go to Lake Berryessa, about 35 miles south of here, four times during the season, from May through September. When the movie Zodiac came out, we said, ‘Look, one of the killings took place right there.’ My wife said, ‘Do you think he’s still alive?’ I said, ‘I don’t think so, but that was in the ’70s. He’s probably using a walker now. I think we have a chance.'” Biggest Catch

“I don’t know if it was the biggest, but a few years ago I got a 75-pound albacore. I caught him about 50 miles out. He fought me for about an hour. You just put your lines out, and I came back with a whole bunch of them. We barbecued them up and the kids just ate and ate.” The Links

“We love golf. We’ve played the Monterey Jazz Festival tournament every year since the beginning, and one year we won it. Rosemary’s my manager, so a lot of times when we travel, she’ll make sure the itinerary includes a game of golf. We’ve played at some really great courses.” Heart of a Poet

“Paul Laurence Dunbar’s writing has meant a lot to me. I read a lot of his poetry. When I first came to New York, it became very important. We’d be traveling to a gig, driving down the highway and all the guys in the car would be reciting the poetry and you’d get these great rhythms, and the poems would have a lot of fun in them.” ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912203326.34/warc/CC-MAIN-20190324043400-20190324065400-00516.warc.gz
195,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/departments/at-home/chuck-loeb/,"Chuck Loeb Main Street in Irvington, N.Y., slopes down a steep hill to offer a commanding view of the Hudson River. Chuck Loeb lives here with his wife, vocalist Carmen Cuesta, on a quiet side street, in a beautiful, cleanly appointed house with a deck overlooking the backyard. Their two daughters, Christina (19) and Lizzy (18), attend Tufts and Boston College, respectively. Because their mother is from Spain, the girls have dual citizenship and are bilingual. Loeb speaks Spanish as well, and when his schedule permits he spends summers with the family at their second home in Castellon (near Valencia). This year, Chuck and Carmen celebrate their 25th wedding anniversary. Their best man was a fellow musician by the name of Stan Getz. Loeb got his big break with Getz in 1979, joining a band that included Mitchel Forman, Mark Egan and Victor Lewis. Working with a jazz master and gaining exposure as a player and composer was reward enough, but while on tour, Loeb also happened to meet the love of his life. Sure enough, Getz is in the wedding photos, standing right next to the bride and groom. There’s a guitar in nearly every room of Loeb’s house, and this is deliberate: “So I don’t have any excuse not to practice,” he says. Downstairs is the home studio, where Loeb recorded his seventh and latest album for Shanachie, When I’m With You. He also does production work here, including tracks for Carmen’s CDs. “Even a lot of session dates have become home-based,” Loeb says. “They send me the files over the Internet and I add my [guitar] stuff. It’s very effective because I have all my sounds here and I can do it at three in the morning, in my pajamas.” Loeb’s recording credits span three pages on AllMusic.com. In addition to working with everyone from Steps Ahead and Eddie Daniels to Taylor Dayne, Loeb also wrote one of the most recognizable themes on TV: an ascending four-note fanfare capped by a staccato three-note riff, which serves as station identification for CNN to this day. He has also played on a number of movie soundtracks, including The Untouchables (under Ennio Morricone), You’ve Got Mail and the latest Will Smith vehicle, Hitch. But he always returns to his own music, and this season he’s playing out in support of When I’m With You. His road band features Mike Ricchiuti on keyboards, Brian Killeen on bass and Josh Dion on drums. (Killeen and Dion have made waves on the jam-band circuit with the group Ulu.) Despite his many years in the game, Loeb is far from jaded. He’s positively starstruck, in fact, when he recounts a recent guest appearance with Bob Dylan at New York’s Hammerstein Ballroom. Loeb sat in on “All Along the Watchtower,” “Mr. Tambourine Man” and two lesser-known songs. “The first song I ever learned on guitar was ‘Like a Rolling Stone,'” Loeb says. “Dylan turned to me after one solo and said, ‘Yeah, Chuck,’ and I thought, ‘OK, I can die now!'” Jamming with Dylan may be cool, but nothing beats the simple life in this idyllic Westchester County ‘hood. Loeb is in fact a member of what’s jokingly called the Westchester Jazz Mafia. Current or former residents of the area include Michael Brecker, John Patitucci, Tim Ries, Bob Mintzer, Alex Bugnon, Bob James and even Stan Getz himself. The Hudson waterfront beckons, even on a day as cold as this. After we wrap up the photo shoot and chat for a bit in the driveway, Loeb adjusts his hat and scarf, then saunters off to meet his wife, down by the riverside. JT Computer? “I’m an e-mail junkie, an Internet junkie,” Loeb says. He has a Mac-based HD3 Pro Tools system with “mirror image” monitors: one in the control room, one in the playing room. “I’ve been involved with home recording from its inception, and I’ve watched the whole thing shrink and shrink, and get more and more powerful.” Car? “We’re Swedish-car people; we’ve always had Saabs and Volvos. But we also have a Chevy Suburban and we love to take long drives-it’s part of our family lore.” Sports? The family is serious about tennis. “Often those are our vacations: We drive down to a tennis center in Hilton Head, South Carolina. My daughters teach tennis in Spain during the summer. Over there you can play on red clay.” Loeb is also a huge Yankees fan. “I like baseball on the radio, especially while I’m doing the dishes.” Food? “My wife’s the cook, and I’m a foot soldier in her army. We’re not vegetarian or anything. We like Mediterranean cuisine, I would say-all olive oil-based cooking, no butter.” Clothes? “I live with three women, so I don’t dress myself. Carmen has the final word.”   [Editor’s note: Chuck Loeb died on July 31, 2017.

196,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/departments/at-home/irvin-mayfield/,"Irvin Mayfield Irvin Mayfield is an animated, supremely self-confident 30-year-old with an easy laugh, a growing command of the trumpet and a soul-deep commitment to all things New Orleans. He lives in New Orleans’ uptown sector, in a comfortable yellow frame house with his wife and two young sons. Over the last few years he’s extended his reach beyond music to the cultural politics of his recovering city, and the push and pull of Mayfield’s civic profile continues to broaden. Pulling up in his black Range Rover, he was a bit late to our meeting, having been summoned to an assessment confab on homelessness. Ever since the calamity, which New Orleanians refer to as “the storm” (rarely “Katrina”), homelessness has been a mushrooming crisis; many people have taken to a growing encampment under the freeway overpass at Claiborne and Canal Streets.

“We’ve created so many homeless people post-Katrina,” says Mayfield, who lost his own father to the storm, an apparent drowning victim whose body was found weeks later on Elysian Fields Avenue. “So we were talking about mounting a campaign to really fix at least the outside homelessness because there are at least five different homelessness situations. So I may be a spokesperson for the effort.”

Mayfield’s other current civic passion is the New Orleans Public Library board, which he joined in December 2006. “My mama has always been a big literacy advocate and I learned how to play jazz a lot from the library. I would go to the public library and get all these jazz recordings to transcribe solos. After the storm the mayor tapped me for the library. I was more interested in the main branch and its proposed national jazz centerpiece downtown. I really didn’t want to get involved with the whole city system; I thought that was above my skill level. But the mayor said, ‘If you’re gonna do one piece you gotta do the whole piece.’ If you’re going to fix the culture of New Orleans, the library system was number one.”

Talk of his library board work turned to the stack of books in the room adjacent to his living room, which appears to have been transformed to a listening/rehearsal room encompassing his stereo rig, piano with a bass alongside, and a small set of covered drums. “I’m reading at least seven books; there’s a great book called Good to Great [by Jim Collins]. I’ve given it to all the board members of the library,” he says. “When I became chairman I implemented a new rule that at every board meeting everybody gets a book. Paolo Coelho’s book The Warrior of the Light is a great kind of follow-up to The Alchemist. And I just finished Salman Rushdie’s Shalimar the Clown. I’m reading [Chip Heath and Dan Heath’s] Made to Stick, which is another kind of marketing book, and I just read Madeleine Albright’s Memo to the President Elect; that was a phenomenal book. I’ve got this other book called Architecture as Experience [by Dana Arnold], which tells me why architecture is important.”

Pointing to the art on his walls, in particular five pieces that appear to be a series, Mayfield says, “Those are by a guy named Charles Palmer out of Minneapolis. Every piece has a spiritual designate. The closer you get to these pieces there’s so much hidden on the inside. Over here you’ve got ‘Bush destroyed democracy’ and if you look closer you see a slave ship in there, then you see old articles about slaves running away. I just love the power of his pieces.”

Regarding a vivid piece with musicians on the bandstand: “That’s a piece by a guy named Frenchy from New Orleans. He shows up and paints pictures on the gig; this is actually Los Hombres Calientes at the Howlin’ Wolf with Jason Marsalis, Bill Summers and Donald Harrison. Sometimes you can get caught up in the technique and forget the purpose.”

Los Hombres Calientes, a group Mayfield founded with Summers in 1998, was and is ambitious for combining Latin-jazz with NOLA music and postbop modernism, but in his solo work Mayfield appears to think even bigger. Check the trumpeter’s large-scale Strange Fruit album and recent post-Katrina requiem (both performed by his New Orleans Jazz Orchestra), as well as the Louisiana Philharmonic’s presence on some tracks on his current Basin Street Records collaboration with mentor Ellis Marsalis (Love Songs, Ballads and Standards).

But as it turns out, the new release, whose masters were damaged in the flood but thankfully preserved for release on Mayfield’s iPod, is the end of a cycle. The trumpeter yearns to return to the small group landscape, “getting back to the art of the quartet or quintet, a little more playing.” He elaborates: “I’m going to be looking for some energetic players. I want to get people who really know what they’re doing, who want to come together and make something happen. It’s harder to do it with a small group because everybody is so important, whereas with an orchestra if somebody has a weakness somebody else can make up for that.”

There is one key obligation Mayfield requires: “If you want to be playing part of my vision, you’ve got to respect New Orleans. You’ve got to know it, you’ve got to own it. That means you need to come and spend time here or start to investigate what it’s all about. I can’t have a band full of people who can’t see the New Orleans vision because it’s so important to me and so much of what I’m about. That’s what’s missing about a lot of jazz records.” The Personal File

Sounds

I’ve got this big system I spent probably $15,000 on, and I almost don’t use it anymore. I’m actually about to get rid of all of my equipment. I’m going to a simple stereo: It looks like it costs about $900, it’s got great sound, it’s sleek, and I can plug my iPod into it. The iPod has changed the game up so much you don’t need all that stuff anymore.” Flicks

“I saw Ratatouille the other day, all about the rat that could cook [laughs]. Man, that was one of the most powerful movies I’ve ever seen!” says Mayfield. “There Will Be Blood blew me away! I thought American Gangster was good too, especially the opening scene where they’re talking about the great American decline. We’re in a good period for movies.” Eats

Life in the Crescent City is a constant gastronomic bouquet, hazardous to those watching their weight but not to the compact but physically fit Irvin Mayfield: “Unfortunately I don’t cook,” says the trumpeter, “but as far as restaurants are concerned, Emeril’s would be my favorite; barbecue shrimp, gumbo and their bread pudding are the dishes I prefer.” It’s a Chopper, Baby

Mayfield, one of jazz’s few bikers, says, “Motorcycle riding is all about freedom. A lot like jazz, it requires a lot of form, structure and deep understanding before you can truly unlock the secrets of its freedom.” Holy Horn

“I had this trumpet made by Dave Monette called the Elysian Trumpet made for my dad and the other victims of Hurricane Katrina. It travels with two full-time sheriffs, it’s insured for $1.3 million. … It’s more important than me! You can’t bring it around just anywhere and I don’t keep it at home-it’s kept in a vault at a church. The whole idea is that the trumpet is only to be played for spiritual reasons or in spiritual places. … I like the idea of having an instrument that’s based in that, and also keeping in mind that jazz came out of the church.” ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912203991.44/warc/CC-MAIN-20190325133117-20190325155117-00222.warc.gz

 Tucked away in the scenic Hudson River Valley, about an hour drive from Manhattan, lies Villa Paradiso, the lush, four-acre home of saxophonist Joe Lovano and his wife of 24 years, singer-flutist-educator Judi Silvano. For big-city dwellers used to cramped conditions and precious few connections to nature, this place is indeed a paradise. But Lovano and Silvano were both Manhattan residents long before moving here. For nearly 20 years they lived together in a loft on 23rd Street that was party central for the jazz community. All that changed in 1998 with the fire.

Lovano was on the road with Paul Motian and Bill Frisell and Silvano was also away when the flames hit. Irreplaceable family pictures were burned, saxophones charred, gongs and cymbals melted into twisted metal sculptures, a lifetime’s collection of LPs destroyed. “It was challenging,” says the onetime Judi Silverman, a dancer and classical singer from Philadelphia who met her future husband at an impromptu jam in that very same loft they would later share. “It could’ve been tragic if we had to escape the fire. And because we had this little house already, we weren’t homeless. So in a lot of ways we were really fortunate.”

Picking themselves up from the ashes, Lovano and Silvano reinvented themselves as a country couple. Judi has become an exceptional gardener who rejoices at every new leaf, every new bud that pops up in any of her seven well-kept gardens. And Joe takes great pride in pointing out the gravel paths and sandstone patio that he’s built, the barn and the three tool sheds he’s painted and the stone wall he stacked down by the creek. “Yeah, I’m getting back to my Sicilian roots,” he laughs as we stroll past his wife’s vegetable garden. “Working is definitely a beautiful, meditative state and it feels great to be involved in nature in that way, where you feel really connected with your life.”

Two cardinals swoop overhead as we stroll past stalks of brilliant orange Asiatic lilies near the swimming pool, which is also a prime CD-listening area for sun-worshipping Lovano. “This is our new project for this season,” he says, pointing to the beginnings of a wooden pergola overhead. “It’s been fun working on that because it brings out some carpentry skills that I experienced growing up. My uncle Sandy had three acres out in East Lake, Ohio, and as a kid I’d help him do all kinds of stuff around his place. So this brings back a lot of memories for me.”

Silvano and Lovano acquired the property in 1993 from their longtime friend, alto saxophonist Dick Oatts, and for the first five years they used it strictly as a getaway pad. Since 1998, it’s been their only residence and they’ve invested huge amounts of time, energy and money into adding on to the original building and maintaining the property. “Sharing our space and property has always been a part of our life together,” says Lovano. “Our loft was a real center for our New York community and now we have little impromptu gatherings throughout the year out here.”

“People come up from the city with their families,” adds Silvano. “They bring their babies, their kids, their dogs … it’s like the company picnic.”

Each year, Lovano and Silvano plant a new tree on their property to commemorate another anniversary at Villa Paradiso. And now, after 15 years, they have their own little New York Botanical Garden. “Those are the three tenors,” laughs Judi, pointing to three gigantic white evergreens that they planted during their first year on the property. Huge willows, dogwoods, blue spruces and rose trellises also dot the grounds. And Silvano has arranged it all with a keen eye for composition, color and a touch of feng shui.

Inside their home one gets a sense of the importance that family plays in their lives. Framed photos adorn the walls: portraits of Judi’s parents when they were courting, a picture of Joe’s mom as a vivacious 14-year-old with a ’40s hairstyle, their wedding picture from 24 years ago. An office space down the hall from the kitchen is where Silvano and Lovano conduct business for their JSL Records label, now celebrating its 20th year. The office doubles as a guest room where a 1930s mirror from Lovano’s grandmother hangs on a wall near an array of his fedoras and stingy brims stacked on top of a dresser.

The spacious, soundproof music room, a fairly recent add-on to the original house, has been the scene of numerous rehearsals, jams and even a few recording sessions. A beautiful old set of Slingerland drums occupies a prominent place in the space. “After the fire, Paul Motian gave these drums to me,” says Lovano. “He played them on Bill Evans’ Sunday at the Village Vanguard and on all those Keith Jarrett Impulse recordings. He told me he also played them with Coleman Hawkins, so you know those are some magical drums.”

Maintaining Villa Paradiso seems like an all-encompassing full-time job, and yet Lovano has found a balance between his country life and his jazz life. “To go out on tour and then to come home and have this scene that Judi and I have developed and nurtured together … it’s so gratifying,” says Lovano. “We’re so lucky to have so much around us. And we give thanks every day.” The Personal File

His Other Car? A Tractor

Silvano drives a 2003 Nissan Maxima. Lovano drives a 2001 Cadillac Eldorado and is also the proud owner of a John Deere tractor. Hobbies

Lovano harbors a lifelong love of golf, going back to his boyhood days in Cleveland. “I always played with all my uncles. Later on, when I was in Woody Herman’s band, we used to keep our clubs with us. If we had a travel day, we would fly ahead or rent a car and go play golf before the gig. That was always fun. There were years when I fell out of touch with golfing, so coming back to that now has been really great.”  Flicks

The last movie that the couple saw together, at the nearby art house in Newburgh, was La Vie En Rose, the biopic of famed French singer Edith Piaf which earned a Best Actress Academy Award for Marion Cotillard. Tubin’

Silvano enjoys Law & Order while Lovano tends to be more of a news junkie. “I kind of lay up for Nightline,” he says. And together they get a kick out of CSI: Miami. Food

“We love cooking … together and for each other,” says Lovano. “A lot of the things that we cook, we took inspiration from other places that we’ve been to … simple things like pasta with beans.” Adds Silvano, “In Rome, we had bruschetta with white beans and garlic mashed like a paste on the bread and drizzled with olive oil. Unbelievable! That was back in January and we’re still talking about it.” ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912204969.39/warc/CC-MAIN-20190326095131-20190326121131-00042.warc.gz
198,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/departments/at-home/jon-faddis/,"Jon Faddis With its old-fashioned soda-fountain counter, vintage metal stools and antique decorations, Baumgart’s Cafe in Englewood, N.J., is a special place. Its eclectic menu includes ice-cream sundaes, fresh-squeezed carrot juice, grilled-cheese sandwiches, fried dumplings, sushi, Asian noodles and omelets. But it’s not just the food that draws trumpeter Jon Faddis from his nearby Teaneck home. It’s also the memories, a clue to which one can find near the front of the store, where you can see the requisite handful of autographed celebrity photos. Among them is one from Dizzy Gillespie.

“That’s one of the places I used to go with Dizzy,” Faddis says of the quaint restaurant a few blocks from a sign the town erected in Gillespie’s honor. The family-owned restaurant changed hands since Dizzy’s day, adding some Asian specialties to a menu that still carries diner and ice-cream-parlor staples.

“Dizzy used to love to go into this restaurant and eat. And he loved to eat, period. He would pile up food on his plate, dig in. ‘I’m still hungry,’ he would say after finishing two main courses,” Faddis laughs.

“One time at a restaurant in Atlanta, Georgia-it was a soul-food place-Dizzy said, ‘Well, I want the grouper.’ They brought out a platter with this gigantic fish on it, and he ordered one of every side dish they had. He ordered candied yams, collared greens, macaroni and cheese, potato salad-he had like six or seven side dishes around this fish. And then when he finished that he looked at the lady and said, ‘Yeah, that was good.  How much is that cake?’ It was a coconut cake.

‘It’s two dollars a slice, Mr. Gillespie.’

‘No, no, no. How much for the whole cake?'”

Faddis admits to watching his diet a lot more carefully than his mentor did, but that practice goes back to 1971, his senior year in high school, when he became a vegetarian. “What that meant to me at the time was I was just going to stop eating meat and I continued with my diet the way it was-French fries and Coca-Colas and milkshakes and things like that.

“One time, I was doing that stuff and this guy looked at me and said, ‘You’re a vegetarian? Come on with me.’ And he grabbed me and we went around to the health-food store and he bought me a book called Survival Into the 21st Century. It was a very extreme book about sprouts and raw foods and wheat-grass juice. I went from one extreme to the other. That was my main influence. Now I’m sort of straddling the fence.”

Faddis moved to Teaneck in 1989 in part because of high real-estate prices in New York City. Faddis and his wife, Laurelyn, describe their home as a “simple cottage-style built probably about 70 years ago” and it includes “birdfeeders and stones excavated from beneath Carnegie Hall, when construction of Zankel Hall was underway.”

Faddis said that visitors to his home often stop to look at photographs on the wall featuring him with presidents Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush from White House performances. “People get impressed about that stuff. But I think one of my favorites is a picture of Dizzy that he signed, autographed to me: ‘To Jon, two hearts as one, John.’ That’s one of my favorites.”

Besides being close to Gillespie, Faddis has also had other notable neighbors. “It’s actually closer to Milt Jackson’s place. It’s like a five-minute walk from his house,” he says. Jackson’s widow, Sandy, still lives there. “She gives great Thanksgiving dinners,” Faddis says. Other couples in the area are Ray and Susan Drummond, Robin Eubanks and Ana Sala, Earl and Cecilia Gardner, Rufus and Doris Reid and Clark and Gwen Terry. It’s also just a short drive from Bennett Studios in Englewood, where he recorded his latest album on Koch, Teranga. In his liner notes for the album, Neil Tesser writes that its title “is a Sengalese word that loosely translates as ‘hospitality.'”

“One of the best aspects about making Teranga is that I could record it close to ‘home,’ yet teranga itself embraces and embodies the philosophy of welcoming and being welcomed wherever in the world you are-being able to feel at home in the world,” Faddis says. He values that feeling, whether it means going down the block for Thanksgiving dinner or being invited to a local musician’s apartment while on the road.

Part of Faddis’ year is also spent at Columbia College in Chicago, where one of the school’s loft apartments makes it “easy to throw pizza parties and impromptu jazz jams for students.” If those spaces didn’t occupy enough of his time, there’s also his compact office at Purchase College in New York, which manages to house a Steinway baby grand, an Apple computer and posters from his many trips abroad.

To Faddis, home “is someplace you really look forward to returning to when you’ve been on the road a long time. Two weeks or more, and you’re looking forward to getting home.” Exercise?

“I used to have a very, very tough regimen. That was when I was studying karate during the early ’80s. I used to work out a couple of hours, and one time I went out on tour and playing basketball I sprained my ankle really badly. I was still doing concerts but I was really laid up for a while. It still hasn’t healed properly. I don’t have any regimen anymore. I sometimes just meditate.” Guilty Pleasures?

“Browsing bookstores. Watching 24, House, Law and Order, Pimp My Ride and cooking shows on television. Breitling watches and Alain Mikli eyewear and Issey Miyake shirts and coats-he’s an amazing designer. Gelato, gelato and more gelato! My good friend Lew Soloff was once in a town in Italy and went and tested out every gelato place. He was having gelato for breakfast. I’m not that extreme.” Books?

“One of the things I read is mystery novels. Anything by Lee Child, Barry Eisler, Arturo Perez-Reverte, Richard Stark and others too numerous to mention.” Audio?

“There’s nothing like being on the bandstand and listening to other musicians. But to me, one of my main hobbies is listening to music. The better it sounds, the better I feel. You can put on CDs and sometimes it can be more enjoyable than hearing something live. It’s all balanced, no distraction and you don’t hear someone at the next table drunk.”

Faddis always travels with his iPod, which currently includes “Art Tatum, Monk. A lot of Dizzy. A lot of Charlie Parker. A lot of Coltrane. A lot of Sonny Rollins.  A lot of Thad Jones and Mel Lewis. A lot of Count Basie. A lot of Duke Ellington. A lot of Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan. Some flamenco. I just found a list that Claudio Roditi made for me about 15 years ago and he had some recommendations for different Brazilian music to check out, so that’s going to be next. Brazilian music and the blues-cats like Memphis Slim, Tampa Red, Cousin Joe and B.B. King.”

For home listening, Faddis has “B&W 801 Matrix 3 speakers, a Cello preamp with six-band EQ, an old Meridian CD player, which needs to be upgraded to one that will read CD-Rs that you make on a computer, two Hafler transnova amps and a Roksan turntable.” Car?

“I drive a Saab Viggen, which they stopped making. We have an Acura MDX, which was highly recommended by drummer Jeff Hamilton and my mother-in-law. And I have a 1973 Mercedes. It has a rebuilt engine in it. I spend so much money trying to keep it running that it’s like a bottomless pit.” Sports?

A Punt, Pass and Kick champion as a boy in Oakland, Calif., Faddis admits to occasionally playing golf (“I wouldn’t call it that”) and watching the pros. “I like football. Basketball is not as much fun anymore because it’s so-you know, everybody’s so busy showing off. Sometimes I’ll turn on ESPN Classic and watch Magic Johnson’s Lakers against Larry Bird’s Celtics. I like watching good basketball. Sometimes the WNBA is more interesting to me than the NBA as far as a team sport. It’s more a team game in the women’s league.” ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912204969.39/warc/CC-MAIN-20190326095131-20190326121131-00437.warc.gz
199,jazztimes.com/,jazz,https://jazztimes.com/departments/at-home/jovino-santos-neto-2/,"Jovino Santos Neto To spend time with Jovino Santos Neto at his home in the Madison Park district of Seattle is to realize that an artist’s personal space is not defined by his living quarters. The apartment that Neto and his wife, Luiza, have shared for 10 years is small and unpretentious. But by any other measure-life experiences, intellectual commitments, linguistic skills, travels, passions-Neto’s universe is vast.

He was born 51 years ago in Rio de Janeiro and studied piano for six months with a private tutor when he was 12. He majored in biology in college: first in Brazil, then at McGill University in Montreal. “Music was my hobby. Science was always going to be my job,” he says. His native language is Portuguese, but he was already fluent in English when he went to Canada. “I also speak Spanish, and I’ve picked up French and Italian from traveling. If I go to China, give me a couple weeks and I’ll be talking Chinese.”

Montreal gave him new opportunities to meet jazz musicians and play. But when he graduated in 1977, he returned to Brazil fully intending to enter a master’s program and become a researcher living in the Amazon, working with primates or water mammals or river dolphins. “Then I met Hermeto Pascoal at his house. We shared a little music and suddenly he said, ‘I’ve got a gig this Friday. Can you read?’ I said ‘Yeah.’ It was bullshit. I mostly just played by ear. So he put a chart in front of me and I made a complete fool of myself. He laughed and said, ‘You come back tomorrow. We’re gonna work a little bit.’ ‘A little bit’ turned out to be 15 years.”

On one of his many international tours with Pascoal, in 1990, Neto discovered the Pacific Northwest and Seattle. “I was fascinated by the water and the greenery and the mountains. I remember telling Hermeto, ‘I could live in this place.'” When he left Pascoal in 1992, he moved to Seattle with his wife and two children. He began attending Cornish College of the Arts and after two semesters joined the faculty, teaching rhythm and ear training.

His two-bedroom apartment is in a large brick complex just south of where the Evergreen Point floating bridge over Lake Washington connects to the Seattle shoreline. The rooms lack the creative clutter that is typical of artists’ homes. The book and CD collections in the living room are small. There is a framed Earshot Jazz 2004 Golden Ear Award for Best Northwest Jazz Instrumentalist and a small photo of Pascoal. A Milton upright piano takes up one wall. “I write at home, but I practice on a really nice piano at Cornish. Seattle has been a good base.”

From that base Neto has recorded three albums and toured the Northwest and beyond with his Seattle quartet (saxophonist Hans Teuber, bassist Chuck Deardorf, drummer Mark Ivester). His ongoing projects include compositions for chamber music and big bands, jazz camps and collaborations with Native American musicians. But his single most important achievement to date may be his new album on Adventure Music, Roda Carioca. “It was the first time that I went back to Brazil to record my own music. It was a way of proving to myself that I had never cut the line, I had just stretched it.”

The album is built up from a core trio (with bassist Rogério Botter Maio and drummer Marcio Bahia) to which guests are added from a circle (“roda”) of exceptional Brazilian musicians. The outcome is a mosaic of the eclecticism unique to Jovino Santos Neto, configuring European classicism and layers of Brazilian rhythms and American on-the-edge jazz into an organic whole.

“Playing improvised music is about developing reflexes. You’ve got to sharpen your perception so that you catch the first idea. Most of the tracks on the new album are first takes.”  Food

“I’m a good cook. It’s like music. I like to walk up to a piano with no notes in my head. I like to go into the kitchen and say, ‘OK, I’m going to make a meal now and I have no idea what’s in the cupboard.'”

Audio/Video

“Challenged,” Neto admits with a rueful smile. He has a small Aiwa shelf system, a Philips 27-inch TV, a basic DVD player and a VCR he found in the dumpster of his apartment complex.

Books

“I read books on airplanes about the cognitive and evolutionary aspects of music. The Singing Neanderthals by Steven Mithen is amazing. So is Hearing in Time by Justin London. It talks about how the brain is organized to understand cyclic events, like rhythm.”

Cars

“Two older Toyotas. I have to be able to fold down the back seat to put a keyboard inside.”

Listening Pleasures

“Choros from the ’30s. Pixinguinha, Radamés Gnattalli, Cartola, Lúcio Alves, Ciro Monteiro. Compilations that I got in Brazil. Pretty obscure stuff.”

Movies

“We belong to Netflix. I love movies. I especially love Indian and Japanese films. I’m a big Kurosawa fan. Medieval Japan feels like home to me.”

Computers

“PC at home, Mac at school. I like them both. It’s like languages. I like to go back and forth.”

Sports

“I could never learn to kick a soccer ball straight.”

Guilty Pleasure

“I like to watch those medical shows, like E.R.” ",crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2019-13/segments/1552912203326.34/warc/CC-MAIN-20190324043400-20190324065400-00358.warc.gz
